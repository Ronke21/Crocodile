<text>Soil fertility refers to the ability of soil to sustain agricultural plant growth, i.e. to provide plant habitat and result in sustained and consistent yields of high quality. It also refers to the soil&#x27;s ability to supply plant/crop nutrients in the right quantities and qualities over a sustained period of time. A fertile soil has the following properties:
* The ability to supply essential plant nutrients and water in adequate amounts and proportions for plant growth and reproduction; and
* The absence of toxic substances which may inhibit plant growth e.g. Fe2+ which leads to nutrient toxicity.

The following properties contribute to soil fertility in most situations:
* Sufficient soil depth for adequate root growth and water retention;
* Good internal drainage, allowing sufficient aeration for optimal root growth (although some plants, such as rice, tolerate waterlogging);
* Topsoil or horizon O is with sufficient soil organic matter for healthy soil structure and soil moisture retention;
* Soil pH in the range 5.5 to 7.0 (suitable for most plants but some prefer or tolerate more acid or alkaline conditions);
* Adequate concentrations of essential plant nutrients in plant-available forms;
* Presence of a range of microorganisms that support plant growth.

In lands used for agriculture and other human activities, maintenance of soil fertility typically requires the use of soil conservation practices. This is because soil erosion and other forms of soil degradation generally result in a decline in quality with respect to one or more of the aspects indicated above.

Soil fertility and quality of land have been impacted by the effects of colonialism and slavery both in the U.S. and globally. The introduction of harmful land practices such as intensive and non-prescribed burnings and deforestation by colonists created long-lasting negative results to the environment. 

Soil fertility and depletion have different origins and consequences in various parts of the world. The intentional creation of dark earth in the Amazon promotes the important relationship between indigenous communities and their land. In African and Middle Eastern regions, humans and the environment are also altered due to soil depletion.

==Soil fertilization==

Bioavailable phosphorus (available to soil life) is the element in soil that is most often lacking. Nitrogen and potassium are also needed in substantial amounts. For this reason these three elements are always identified on a commercial fertilizer analysis. For example, a 10-10-15 fertilizer has 10 percent nitrogen, 10 percent available phosphorus (P2O5) and 15 percent water-soluble potassium (K2O). Sulfur is the fourth element that may be identified in a commercial analysis—e.g. 21-0-0-24 which would contain 21% nitrogen and 24% sulfate.

Inorganic fertilizers are generally less expensive and have higher concentrations of nutrients than organic fertilizers. Also, since nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium generally must be in the inorganic forms to be taken up by plants, inorganic fertilizers are generally immediately bioavailable to plants without modification. However, studies suggest that chemical fertilizers have adverse health impacts on humans including the development of chronic disease from the toxins. As for the environment, over-reliance on inorganic fertilizers disrupts the natural nutrient balance in the soil, resulting in lower soil quality, loss of organic matter, and higher chances for erosion in the soil.

Additionally, the water-soluble nitrogen in inorganic fertilizers does not provide for the long-term needs of the plant and creates water pollution. Slow-release fertilizers may reduce leaching loss of nutrients and may make the nutrients that they provide available over a longer period of time.

Soil fertility is a complex process that involves the constant cycling of nutrients between organic and inorganic forms. As plant material and animal wastes are decomposed by micro-organisms, they release inorganic nutrients to the soil solution, a process referred to as mineralization. Those nutrients may then undergo further transformations which may be aided or enabled by soil micro-organisms. Like plants, many micro-organisms require or preferentially use inorganic forms of nitrogen, phosphorus or potassium and will compete with plants for these nutrients, tying up the nutrients in microbial biomass, a process often called immobilization. The balance between immobilization and mineralization processes depends on the balance and availability of major nutrients and organic carbon to soil microorganisms. Natural processes such as lightning strikes may fix atmospheric nitrogen by converting it to (NO2). Denitrification may occur under anaerobic conditions (flooding) in the presence of denitrifying bacteria. Nutrient cations, including potassium and many micronutrients, are held in relatively strong bonds with the negatively charged portions of the soil in a process known as cation exchange.

Phosphorus is a primary factor of soil fertility as it is an element of plant nutrients in the soil. It is essential for cell division and plant development, especially in seedlings and young plants. However, phosphorus is becoming increasingly harder to find and its reserves are starting to be depleted due to the excessive use as a fertilizer. The widespread use of phosphorus in fertilizers has led to pollution and eutrophication. Recently the term peak phosphorus has been coined, due to the limited occurrence of rock phosphate in the world.

A wide variety of materials have been described as soil conditioners due to their ability to improve soil quality, including biochar, offering multiple soil health benefits.

Food waste compost was found to have better soil improvement than manure based compost.

==Light and CO2 limitations==

Photosynthesis is the process whereby plants use light energy to drive chemical reactions which convert CO2 into sugars. As such, all plants require access to both light and carbon dioxide to produce energy, grow and reproduce.

While typically limited by nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, low levels of carbon dioxide can also act as a limiting factor on plant growth. Peer-reviewed and published scientific studies have shown that increasing CO2 is highly effective at promoting plant growth up to levels over 300 ppm. Further increases in CO2 can, to a very small degree, continue to increase net photosynthetic output.

==Soil depletion==
Soil depletion occurs when the components which contribute to fertility are removed and not replaced, and the conditions which support soil&#x27;s fertility are not maintained. This leads to poor crop yields. In agriculture, depletion can be due to excessively intense cultivation and inadequate soil management. Depletion may occur through a variety of other effects, including overtillage (which damages soil structure), underuse of nutrient inputs which leads to mining of the soil nutrient bank, and salinization of soil.

=== Colonial Impacts on Soil Depletion ===
Soil fertility can be severely challenged when land-use changes rapidly. For example, in Colonial New England, colonists made a number of decisions that depleted the soils, including: allowing herd animals to wander freely, not replenishing soils with manure, and a sequence of events that led to erosion. William Cronon wrote that &quot;...the long-term effect was to put those soils in jeopardy. The removal of the forest, the increase in destructive floods, the soil compaction and close-cropping wrought by grazing animals, ploughing—all served to increase erosion.&quot; Cronon continues, explaining, “Where mowing was unnecessary and grazing among living trees was possible, settlers saved labor by simply burning the forest undergrowth...and turning loose their cattle...In at least one ill-favored area, the inhabitants of neighboring towns burned so frequently and graze so intensively that…the timber was greatly injured, and the land became hard to subdue...In the long run, cattle tended to encourage the growth of woody, thorn-bearing plants which they could not eat and which, once established, were very difficult to remove”. These practices were methods of simplifying labor for colonial settlers in new lands when they were not familiar with traditional Indigenous agricultural methods. Those Indigenous communities were not consulted but rather forced out of their homelands so European settlers could commodify their resources. The practice of intensive land burning and turning loose cattle ruined soil fertility and prohibited sustainable crop growth.

While colonists utilized fire to clear land, certain prescribed burning practices are common and valuable to increase biodiversity and in turn, benefit soil fertility. Without consideration of the intensity, seasonality, and frequency of the burns, the conservation of biodiversity and the overall health of the soil can be negatively impacted by fire.

In addition to soil erosion through using too much or too little fire, colonial agriculture also resulted in topsoil depletion. Topsoil depletion occurs when the nutrient-rich organic topsoil, which takes hundreds to thousands of years to build up under natural conditions, is eroded or depleted of its original organic material. The Dust Bowl in the Great Plains of North America is a great example of this with about one-half of the original topsoil of the great plains having disappeared since the beginning of agricultural production there in the 1880s. Outside of the context of colonialism topsoil depletion can historically be attributed to many past civilizations&#x27; collapses.

=== Soil Depletion and Enslavement ===
As historian David Silkenat explains, the goals of Southern plantation and slave owners, instead of measuring productivity based on outputs per acre, were to maximize the amount of labor that could be extracted from the enslaved workforce. The landscape was seen as disposable, and the African slaves were seen as expendable. Once these Southern farmers forced slaves to leach soils and engage in mass deforestation, they would discard the land and move towards more fertile prospects. The forced slave practices created extensive destruction on the land. The environmental impact included draining swamps, clearing forests for monocropping and fuel steamships, and introducing invasive species, all leading to fragile ecosystems. In the aftermath, these ecosystems left hillsides eroded, rivers clogged with sterile soil, and extinction of native species. Silkenat summarizes this phenomenon of the relationship between enslavement and soil, “Although typically treated separately, slavery and the environment naturally intersect in complex and powerful ways, leaving lasting effects from the period of emancipation through modern-day reckonings with racial justice…the land too fell victim to the slave owner’s lash”.

=== Global Soil Depletion ===
One of the most widespread occurrences of soil depletion is in tropical zones where nutrient content of soils is low. The depletion of soil has affected the state of plant life and crops in agriculture in many countries. In the Middle East for example, many countries find it difficult to grow produce because of droughts, lack of soil, and lack of irrigation. The Middle East has three countries that indicate a decline in crop production, the highest rates of productivity decline are found in hilly and dryland areas. 

Many countries in Africa also undergo a depletion of fertile soil. In regions of dry climate like Sudan and the countries that make up the Sahara Desert, droughts and soil degradation is common. Cash crops such as teas, maize, and beans require a variety of nutrients in order to grow healthy. Soil fertility has declined in the farming regions of Africa and the use of artificial and natural fertilizers has been used to regain the nutrients of ground soil.

== Dark Earths ==

=== South America ===
The details of Indigenous societies prior to European colonization in 1492 within the Amazonian regions of South America, particularly the size of the communities and the depth of interactions with the environment, are continually debated. Central to the debate is the influence of Dark Earth. Dark Earth is a type of soil found in the Amazon that has a darker color, higher organic carbon content, and higher fertility than soil in other regions of South America which makes it highly coveted even today. Dark Earth deposits have been found, through ethnographic and archaeological studies, to have been created through ancient Indigenous practices by intentional soil management.

Ethnoarchaeologist Morgan Schmidt outlines how this carbon-rich soil was intentionally created by communities in the Amazon. While Dark Earth, and other anthropic soils, can be found all throughout the world, Amazonian Dark Earth is particularly significant because “it contrasts too sharply with the especially poor fertility of typical highly weathered tropical upland soils in the Amazon”. There is much evidence to suggest that the development of ancient agricultural societies in the Amazon was strongly influenced by the formation of Dark Earth. As a result, Amazonian societies benefitted from the dark earth in terms of agricultural success and enhanced food production. Soil analyses have been completed on the modern and ancient Kuikuro Indigenous Territory in the Upper Xingu River basin in southeastern Amazonia through archaeological and ethnographic research to determine the human relation to the soil. The “results demonstrate the intentional creation of dark earth, highlighting how Indigenous knowledge can provide strategies for sustainable rainforest management”.

=== Africa ===
In Egypt, earthworms of the Nile River Valley contributed to the significant fertility of the soils. As a result, Cleopatra declared the earthworm a sacred animal to recognize the animal’s positive impact. No one, including farmers, was “allowed to harm or remove an earthworm for fear of offending the deity of fertility”. In Ghana and Liberia, it is a long-withstanding practice to combine different types of waste to create fertile soil that is referred to as African Dark Earths. This soil, contains high concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, and carbon.

== Humans and Soil ==
Albert Howard is credited as the first Westerner to publish Native techniques of sustainable agriculture. As noted by Howard in 1944, “In all future studies of disease we must, therefore, always begin with the soil. This must be gotten into good condition first of all and then the reaction of the soil, the plant, animal, and man observed. Many diseases will then automatically disappear...Soil fertility is the basis of the public health system of the future...”. Howard connects the health crises of crops to the impacts of livestock and human health, ultimately spreading the message that humans must respect and restore the soil for the benefit of the human and non-human world. He continues that industrial agriculture disrupts the delicate balance of nature and irrevocably robs the soil of its fertility.

==Irrigation effects==
Irrigation is a process by which crops are watered by man-made means, such as bringing in water from pipes, canals, or sprinklers. Irrigation is used when the natural rainfall patterns of a region are not sustainable enough to maintain crops. Ancient civilizations heavily relied on irrigation and today about 18% of the world&#x27;s cropland is irrigated. The quality of irrigation water is very important to maintain soil fertility and tilth, and for using more soil depth by the plants. When soil is irrigated with high alkaline water, unwanted sodium salts build up in the soil which would make soil draining capacity very poor. So plant roots can not penetrate deep into the soil for optimum growth in Alkali soils. When soil is irrigated with low pH / acidic water, the useful salts (Ca, Mg, K, P, S, etc.) are removed by draining water from the acidic soil and in addition unwanted aluminium and manganese salts to the plants are dissolved from the soil impeding plant growth. When soil is irrigated with high salinity water or sufficient water is not draining out from the irrigated soil, the soil would convert into saline soil or lose its fertility. Saline water enhance the turgor pressure or osmotic pressure requirement which impedes the off take of water and nutrients by the plant roots.

Top soil loss takes place in alkali soils due to erosion by rain water surface flows or drainage as they form colloids (fine mud) in contact with water. Plants absorb water-soluble inorganic salts only from the soil for their growth. Soil as such does not lose fertility just by growing crops but it lose its fertility due to accumulation of unwanted and depletion of wanted inorganic salts from the soil by improper irrigation and acid rain water (quantity and quality of water). The fertility of many soils which are not suitable for plant growth can be enhanced many times gradually by providing adequate irrigation water of suitable quality and good drainage from the soil.

==Fictional biography==
===The Darkness===
The Darkness is depicted as a cosmic entity predating recorded history. It is the embodiment of chaos that exists prior to God&#x27;s light – embodied in the comics as the Angelus. As the cosmos forms, the Darkness grows to resent God and His creation. Conjuring a legion of demons, the Darkness declares war upon the Angelus and her host. This lasts for eons until a truce is reached to prevent mutual destruction; to seal the truce, the two powers mate and conceive the &quot;Witchblade&quot;.

Sometime after this, the Darkness begins inhabiting human vessels – the sons of its chosen bloodline; the father passing the curse to his child at the moment of conception, dying as the force leaves his body. The power then awakens on the son&#x27;s 21st birthday. A wielder of the Darkness has been present in every major time period and continental power in history. These hosts are usually predisposed to be violent, and have been dictactors, murderers, thieves, and abusers.

The Darkness so far has 13 cosmic powers, known as &quot;Artifacts&quot;.

===Jackie Estacado===
Jackie Estacado is the vessel of the Darkness for the first run of the series. He is depicted as an antihero; often aligned with evil, but sometimes with remorse. He states his ethos in Vol. 2, #5: &quot;My whole life I&#x27;ve been kicked around, you know? I don&#x27;t know how to do anything but kick back&quot;.

The son of notorious mob associate Danny Estacado and an unnamed prostitute, Jackie is taken in by Saint Gerald&#x27;s Orphanage, where he is frequently abused by the orderlies. Despite his antisocial nature, Jackie protects his friend Jenny from their cruel treatment. At the age of six, Jackie is adopted by up-and-coming mob boss Frankie &quot;Kill-The-Children-Too&quot; Franchetti, who claims to be his uncle. Frankie does this after being persuaded by Sonatine of the Brotherhood of Darkness that bringing Jackie into his inner circle will make him powerful.

Raised as a hitman for the Franchetti mob family, Jackie has a penchant for murder and promiscuity. Despite his criminal lifestyle, Jackie follows a strict moral code of trust in those who earn it and fierce loyalty to family and allies. Early in the series, his main love interest is his childhood friend Jenny Romano. He later develops a romance with Sara Pezzini after the birth of their daughter, Hope Pezzini.

Life in the mob provides Jackie with a home and as a sense of safety and family, but also makes him more violent and prone to illegal activity. Losing his virginity at age fourteen to a female police officer during an interrogation, he disregards the law and develops a sex habit. Completing his first hit at age sixteen, Jackie soon becomes Frankie&#x27;s chief enforcer, skyrocketing the Franchetti family into one of the top mob families in New York City. Jackie often visits Jenny&#x27;s club to keep in touch.

Both the Angelus and Sonatine watch over Jackie throughout his life, waiting for him to manifest the Darkness – the Brotherhood wishing to exploit his power and the Angelus wishing to annihilate the wielder at his most vulnerable. Jackie is also watched by followers of the Church of the Angelus who have infiltrated various criminal operations. Among them is Regis Tyne, a mob accountant who associates with Jackie and attempts to assassinate him over a decade later.

When he turns 21, his dark powers awaken and he learns of his evil heritage. Jackie spend much of his time escaping from or fighting the Angelus and the Brotherhood of the Darkness. Jackie tries to quit the mob and Frankie kidnaps and kills Jenny. Jackie blows up a warehouse with Franchetti&#x27;s crew in it, killing Frankie and burning himself alive. Jackie spends two days wandering around Hell searching for Jenny until the former priest Tom Judge, bearer of an artifact called &quot;the Rapture,&quot; comes and gives him hope, allowing him to exit Hell. Jackie&#x27;s body is then reconstructed by the Darkness.

Jackie returns to find the Franchetti mob taken over by Frankie&#x27;s cousin, Paulie. Paulie discovers Jackie&#x27;s secret and blackmails Jackie into doing hits for him. Jackie turns on Paulie and takes control of the Franchetti family, fighting the Russian mafia in Atlantic City, where he is seduced by a woman created by his own unconscious. Siding with the Magdalena (the bearer of another artifact, the Spear of Destiny), he confronts the Angelus.

After an attack by the Angelus&#x27;s army on the Franchetti family, Jackie learns from an Angelus warrior that detective Sara Pezzini, former bearer of the Witchblade, is pregnant and that he is the father of the unborn baby. The Darkness, tired of the truce between the Light and the Darkness, had mind-controlled Jackie to have sex with Sara while she was in coma. The Angelus tries to get the baby to win the war. Jackie and Danielle Baptiste, the new bearer of the Witchblade, defend Sara from an attack by the Angelus&#x27;s army and get her to a safe house in a cavern. The Angelus army attacks again, defeating Jackie and the Magdalena, but they buy Sara enough time to give birth. Sara dies in the process, but her daughter&#x27;s power brings her to life again, giving her half of the power of the Witchblade, Dani keeping the other half. The Angelus defeats Sara and Dani, but is vanquished by the baby. Sara names her daughter Hope.

Jackie meets chemical engineer Professor Kirchner, who helps him develop his darkness abilities. Jackie usurps the power in the fictional banana republic of Sierra Muñoz, South America, in hopes of establishing a new empire. Jackie establishes a drug cartel in Sierra Muñoz with a narcotic made from his own bodily fluids, builds an impenetrable fortress, forms an army, and takes a lover, not knowing Kirchner is controlling her. The residents of Sierra Muñoz resist Jackie&#x27;s takeover with the help of the U.S. Department of Defense, which wants to capture Jackie for experimentation. He defeats them, but Kirchner and his pregnant lover turn against him, and she takes control of the Darkness, taking it from him. Dying, Jackie regains the Darkness by pure willpower. Confronting Kirchner, he learns that the baby is already born, and that it is an incarnation of the Darkness without human flaws like a conscience. It attacks him, but Jackie defeats it.

Jackie heads back to the United States, surviving an encounter with a dream-stealing witch in Mexico. He is captured by a devil named the Sovereign. The devil tells Jackie that when he went to hell, Jackie made a deal with the Sovereign, who promised, in return for several assassinations, to reunite Jackie&#x27;s body and soul. Jackie fulfills the Sovereign&#x27;s demands, killing a possessed nun, an immortal drug dealer, and a 10-year-old African warlord.

He visits New York, where he punishes some thugs of the Franchetti mob who caused the death of a 5-year-old girl and visits Sara and his daughter. The antagonists Glacier Stone and Ember Stone are introduced, Jackie learns that there is a total of 13 artifacts, and Jackie kills the current incarnation of the Angelus, and has his first kiss with Sara. The new bearer of the Glacier Stone, and of another artifact, the Sword of Blood, is Michael Finnigan, an Irish mobster Jackie hired to watch over Sara and Hope. Months after this, he saves Jackie, who was captured by a revenge driven Egyptian mob.

During Jackie&#x27;s missions for the Sovereign, he encounters a woman with a red ribbon who intrigues him. He also meets a past Darkness wielder named Aram, also known as the Foreigner, who explains that the Sovereign has been manipulating Jackie from the start and that his soul and the Darkness are still in him, repressed by his desire to be free of the Darkness&#x27;s influence. Ignoring the Foreigner, Jackie follows the woman and faces a resurrected djinn created by a shaman to kill Darkness wielders. Finding the djinn to be virtually invincible, Jackie is guided to strangle the woman to death with her own ribbon, breaking the curse of the djinn and freeing the woman from eternal servitude. Jackie is confronted by Aram, who intimidates him into summoning the full power of the Darkness. Aram disappears and Jackie realizes the Sovereign&#x27;s manipulations and intent on revenge with full control of his powers.

Jackie attacks the Sovereign, chases him away from his base, and conquers it for himself. He finds a list of statues of the Sovereign; to destroy all of them he gathers a crew of thieves, smugglers, and fighters, beginning with Leonard Kim, a surviving member of the Sovereign&#x27;s mercenaries. He has to escape from a team of government killers with the help of an army officer who decides that Jackie&#x27;s abilities should not be replicated. He walks into a trap that a Russian mafioso built with the help of a traitor on his team, which lures him with images of his sister Capris; he escapes from a machine that feeds on his magic energy. Next, he has to deal with a second traitor in his team, mob accountant Regis Tyne, a sleeper agent of a fanatical human Angelus army, who decides not to kill Jackie because there could be worse bearers to the Darkness, but is still killed by a surprised Jackie. He revives Regis with the help of the Darkness, now controlling him, hears his story and let him continue as part of the crew. In the last confrontation with the Sovereign, Jackie and his team, ensnared in illusion spells, win because of Leonard Kim&#x27;s sacrifice. Leonard declines Jackie&#x27;s offer to heal him with the Darkness.

==Powers and abilities==
The Darkness is an elemental force of chaos and creation. A Darkness wielder accesses another dimension through the shadows around them and exerts control over the demonic creatures that dwell there. These creatures, called Darklings, usually appear as serpentine or goblinoid fiends that can communicate with their master through telepathy. They possess supernatural strength and stamina as well as deadly claws and fangs.

Darklings emerge in different forms depending on the needs of their host. Some Darklings have wings and others can breathe fire. Darklings have also exhibited the ability to easily adhere to sheer surfaces as well as teleport through shadows with their bearer and produce corrosive chemicals through their saliva or excrement. While beholden to their vessel, Darklings do exhibit their own autonomy.

In battle, Darkness wielders envelop their bodies in an armor of shadowy metal. This gives them strength and durability as well as razored fingers and bladed tendrils emerging from their shoulders which can transform into wings. With practice, the wielder can use their armor to shapeshift. They can also instinctively fashion weapons and shields from their armor.

When a wielder is injured, the shadows surrounding them are absorbed into their body to regenerate cells at unnatural rates, even to regrow lost limbs. This renders the vessels impervious to disease and poisons as well as resistant to supernatural afflictions. This also allows them a degree of pseudo-immortality as the Darkness keeps them preserved over millennia.

Darkness bearers are typically hardened individuals whose lives have endowed them with considerable fighting prowess and survival skills. Wielders from older time periods were usually skilled swordsmen while modern hosts like Jackie are skilled marksmen. Jackie was trained in chemistry by Kirchner, enabling him to convert Darkness into water, corrosives, or narcotics.

==Significant characters==

Angelus
:The Angelus is the antithesis of the Darkness and a common enemy in the series. Jackie&#x27;s first confrontation with the entity ended with him as the victor. Sonatine would later conjure the spirit in hopes of it possessing Appolonia Franchetti in their mutual desire to take vengeance on Estacado. Instead, it inhabited the body of the latter&#x27;s catatonic mother, Lauren. Jackie managed to escape this encounter by creating a doppelganger of himself from the Darkness. This new Angelus would seek sanctuary in the Amazon where she would encounter then-Magdalena, Sister Mariella.
:Returning some time after Frankie&#x27;s death, the Angelus would again seek out Jackie - now Don of the Franchetti Mafia. At the same time, the newest Magdalena - Patience - was assigned to assassinate Jackie. During her hunt, she encountered the Angelus and followed her to Estacado. As Patience subdued Jackie, the Angelus took advantage and attacked. He was able to lure her into a tunnel to weaken her enough for Appolonia to kill her with the Spear of Destiny. The power then possessed Patience for only a few moments before being exorcised through sheer will.

Appolonia Franchetti
:The daughter of Frankie and Lauren Franchetti and Jackie&#x27;s adoptive cousin. When she was a child, she witness her father brutally torture and murder her mother&#x27;s lover. The trauma of this experience led to Appolonia&#x27;s resentment of Frankie as well as her own antisocial behaviors. Growing up with Jackie, they both grew to hate each other; him for Franchetti&#x27;s attention and her for her petty cruelty. Estacado was Frankie&#x27;s golden boy while he more or less ignored Appolonia and her now-catatonic mother. She eventually left New York to study abroad in Europe.
:Appolonia returned to the States shortly after Jackie inherited the Darkness. Bent on revenge and determined to take over the Franchetti Family without Estacado, she had Wenders kidnapped and tortured until he revealed everything he knew about Jackie, his powers, and the Angelus. Collaborating with Sonatine, she planned to become the next Angelus host. This plan misfired when the spirit inhabited her mother instead. She was left in a coma following this encounter and was only resuscitated back to consciousness by the severed blade of the Spear of Destiny.

Aram
:The oldest recorded host of the Darkness, Aram the Witch-King was a sovereign and warlock of Ancient Africa some ten thousand years prior to the Common Era. Willingly letting the curse into his body, he used its power to take entire regions of land to sate his lust for conquest. At some point after becoming disgusted with his cruelty, he used his mastery of sorcery to exorcise the Darkness from his body. Although effectively free from the curse, the Darkness condemned him with immortality; promising that he would wander the Earth until he let it back in.
:Over the centuries, Aram - known by then only as the Foreigner - would travel the globe watching over Darkness hosts from a distance. At some point during his trek, he would encounter and slay a djinn created to kill Darkness bearers and outwit the Sovereign.

Capris Castiglione
:Jackie&#x27;s twin sister and a minor ally in the first volume of the series and later a primary antagonist in or around the last volume. Separated from her sibling at birth, Capris inherited only a small portion of the Darkness&#x27;s power - being one of the only women to bear the curse. Raised by Father Brendan, Capris lived an idyllic life. This all ended after her 18th birthday when she found her longtime friend and college roommate - Blaire Dray - dead from an apparent suicide. It&#x27;s soon found out that Blaire was murdered as a cover for an illegal porn racket.
:Capris made her last appearance in the &quot;Outer Darkness&quot; storyline, where it was revealed that she had become fully seduced by the euphoric power of the Darkness and had been training and perfecting her powers. The Darkness chose her to be his new host and used her to try to kill Jackie. She attacked and overpowered him with her superior powers and would have killed him if not for Aram using his last bit of magic to shut down the Darkness. Jackie killed Capris using a magical crystal glove given to him by Aram. She is last seen as a damned soul in a strange afterlife for Darkness-wielders.
:While she did manifest Darkness powers upon turning 21, Capris&#x27;s abilities were significantly less than those of her brother when she first appeared in the series. She seemed to function as a repository of power which Jackie drew on during their encounter with the Cherub Hostile. She initially only showcased increased strength and resilience as well as the ability to conjure tendrils from the surrounding shadows. Over a decade later, her powers expanded exponentially to the point of manifesting her own armor and creating zombies by feeding them her blood.

The Doppleganger
:An evil clone of Jackie created by the Darkness after Aram purged him from it.

Sonatine
:The leader of the Brotherhood of Darkness and a recurring antagonist early in the series. Having followed Jackie&#x27;s bloodline since the days of their founder - Miguel Estacado - Sonatine was obsessed with remaking the world in the image he desired using the powers of the Darkness. Sonatine first met Jackie after he manifested the curse. While initially presenting himself as a mentor, Jackie&#x27;s refusal led to the Brotherhood kidnapping Jenny to force his cooperation. However, this plan backfired when the Angelus arrived, and they were forced to work together.
:Sonatine&#x27;s knowledge of the occult allowed him a degree of arcane ability and a prolonged lifespan. He carried a star talisman that compelled people to believe anything he said or to answer any question truthfully. It could also create light powerful enough to frighten Darklings. He was also schooled in ceremonial magic and possession. These were showcased when he ritualistically conjured the presence of the Angelus in an attempt to enslave its power, and later after being gravely wounded he transferred his consciousness into one of his servants, Wenders.

Sovereign
:The Sovereign was the Emperor of Rome roughly three thousand years prior to the Common Era. His reign was short-lived as he and his family were murdered by a bearer of the Darkness. Sentenced to Hell for his cruelties in life, he managed to deceive an angel into freeing his soul. Bargaining with the Fates to be spared an eternity of torture, he became a custodian of souls sent to Hell. Able to enter the living world only by possessing statues made in his image, the Sovereign became obsessed with taking revenge of any vessel of the Darkness he encountered.

Jenny Romano
:The childhood friend and girlfriend of Jackie.

Frankie Franchetti
:Frankie is one of the main antagonists of the series and a vicious mobster.

The Magdalena
:Descended from Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ, The Magdalena is an assassin born and bred to serve the Vatican in times of duress.

Nino Wenders
:A manservant of the Darkness working for Sontaine, who Jackie forces to help him battle the Angelus. He later becomes romantically obsessed with Jackie, who regards Wenders as cowardly and untrustworthy.

Angelus Warriors
:Servants of the Angeleous.

Elle
:An artificial human who becomes Jackie&#x27;s companion.

Paulie Franchetti
:The cousin of Frankie Franchetti and the Don of the Franchetti crime family after Jackie kills his cousin. Paulie is a vicious psychopath who has no morals, empathy, or regard for the lives of others. He has an extremely short temper, engaging in brutal retaliation against even the slightest offense.

The Brotherhood
:A cult who worships the Darkness.

Captain Eddie Shrote
:A deeply corrupt police captain in the NYPD and a business partner of Paulie Franchetti. Shrote is a ruthless sociopath who, in Jackie&#x27;s words, lives to exploit others. He commands a large precinct with hundreds of patrol officers and a platoon of New York ESU officers, many of whom are corrupt or psychotic, using them to do his dirty work.

<text>William Bernard Cheesbourg (June 12, 1927 Tucson, Arizona – November 6, 1995 Tucson, Arizona) was an American racecar driver who participated in six Indianapolis 500 races.

==Biography==
He was born on June 12, 1927, in Tucson, Arizona.

Cheesbourg started racing jalopies in Tucson and successfully moved into midgets racing all over Arizona after World War II. He drove in the USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1956-1962 and 1964-1966 seasons with 31 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 races in 1957-1959, 1961, 1964, and 1965. He successfully bumped his way into the Indy 500 field after initially being bumped out three times, which is the race record. He finished in the top ten in stock cars 8 times, with his best finish in 7th position in 1959 at Daytona and in 1966 at Fuji.

Cheesbourg returned to the local dirt short track racing scene after his Indy Car career was finished. He is known for the help he offered to many other racers. He won several Arizona Late Model Stock Car championships racing at Corona Speedway in Tucson, Manzanita Speedway in Phoenix and many other tracks. He was known equally for his ability to use his front bumper and his natural talents.

Even after he stopped traditional stock car racing, he continued helping others and eventually helped construct and drive a local high school&#x27;s entry in an electric car race held at Phoenix International Raceway. He even competed for a while in local figure eight racing just for the fun of it.

He died of cancer on November 6, 1995, in Tucson, Arizona.

<text>William Lawrence Schindler (March 6, 1909 – September 20, 1952) was an American racing driver.

== Racing career ==

Schindler began racing in 1931 in a sprint car. He was racing midget cars on the East Coast of the United States at their introduction in 1934. Schindler lost his left leg from above the knee while racing in a Champ car race in 1936 at Mineola, Long Island. He is one of three drivers to have participated in the Indianapolis 500 with a prosthetic leg, along with Al Miller and Cal Niday.

Schindler was part of a group determined to keep the AAA out of the East Coast in 1937. He was elected president of the &quot;outlaw&quot; group. Schindler briefly switched to the AAA in 1940, and won the Bronx Coliseum Indoor championship. He returned to his &quot;outlaw&quot; past when he was named the president of the newly formed American Racing Drivers Club (ARDC). He served as president for the club&#x27;s first six years. Schindler won ARDC championships in 1940, 1945, 1946 and 1948. In both 1947 and 1948 he won 53 midget car feature races, which helped bring popularity to midget car racing in the Northeastern United States.

Schindler rejoined the AAA so he could race in the Indianapolis 500 in 1950, 1951, and 1952.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Schindler participated in three World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. His best finish was 13th place, and he scored no World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Death ==

Schindler died in a sprint car racing crash in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 1952. Schindler was leading the race on the third lap when a car driven by Paul Becker lost a wheel and skidded into the fence. He did not see the &quot;go slow&quot; sign that was immediately waved after Becker&#x27;s crash and his black Offenhauser hit the wheel, crashed through the fence and tumbled down a 20-foot embankment. He was killed instantly.

== Awards and honors ==

*He was inducted in the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1998.
*He was inducted in the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 1985.
*He was inducted in the New England Auto Racers Hall of Fame in 2004.

<doc id="1251950" wikidata="Q171619" url="?curid=1251950" title="Bill Vukovich">
<text>William John Vukovich (; December 13, 1918 – May 30, 1955) was an American racing driver. He won the 1953 and 1954 Indianapolis 500, plus two more American Automobile Association National Championship races, and died while leading the 1955 Indianapolis 500.

Several drivers of his generation have referred to Vukovich as the greatest ever in American motorsport. He is generally considered one of the best racing drivers of his generation, and is the only driver to lead the most laps in three consecutive Indy 500s. 

== Early life ==

William Vukovich was born in Alameda, near Oakland, California. He was the fifth of eight children and the youngest of three sons born to John Vukovich, a carpenter mill hand, and Mildred (née Syerkovic). Vukovich&#x27;s parents had emigrated from Serbia, and had later Anglicized their name from &quot;Vacurovich&quot; to Vukovich upon suggestion of the judge presiding over their naturalization. During his childhood Vukovich was known to his mother as &quot;Vaso.&quot;

Not long after Vukovich&#x27;s birth, his family relocated to a 40-acre farm in Kerman, near Fresno, cultivating grapes and figs. The family earned modest income, and on one occasion Vukovich was hired out as a cotton picker to earn supplemental income. His family later moved from Kerman to nearby Sanger, where they made a down-payment on a 20-acre muscat grape vineyard. In 1932, after several years of heavy frosts and struggling to complete the final payments for their property, John Vukovich committed suicide. Vukovich, aged 14, left school to assist his brothers in operating the farm.

After being unable to make a final $200 payment, the Vukovich family lost possession of their land. They then rented a nearby vineyard, but after another year of bad weather conditions they were forced to leave the land. Most of the family moved into Fresno, where they sought out jobs. In 1939 Mildred Vukovich died in Del Rey, near Fresno, aged 51.

Vukovich displayed an interest in speed at an early age. He and his brothers were known to frequently arrive at school with their four-wheeled, horse-drawn cart on two wheels, leading to their father building a two-wheeled cart. The family owned a Ford Model T, and on Sundays when their parents left to go into town the brothers would race it around the farm, using a rake to clear their tracks. They overturned the car so often that eventually its top needed to be left down permanently, and on one occasion Vukovich suffered a sprained wrist after attempting to prevent a tip.

Vukovich was introduced to auto racing around the age of seven, when he and his brother Mike began attending races at Fresno Speedway, a board track located more than 20 miles from their home. The two brothers shared a bicycle, and sometimes arrived to races several days in advance in order to locate trees from which they could watch for free. The track was eventually torn down; during his teenage years Vukovich would sneak through holes in the fencing of the Fresno County Fairgrounds in order to attend races at the dirt track located there.

== Driving career ==

=== Early career ===

At age 17 Vukovich began driving a Chevrolet-powered roadster owned by Fred Gerhardt, finishing third in his first race. Vukovich won his third roadster event. He soon expressed an interest in midget car racing, and graduated to this level of competition within a year of racing.

The United States&#x27; entry into the Second World War saw a suspension of racing. During the war Vukovich relocated to Riverside, California, and found work maintaining Jeeps and other vehicles for the U.S. Army.

=== Post-war midget car career ===
Before he began Indy car racing, Vukovich drove midget cars for the Edelbrock dirt track racing team. He raced on the West Coast of the United States in the United Racing Association (URA), and won the series&#x27; 1945 and 1946 midget car championships. Vukovich won the 1948 Turkey Night Grand Prix at Gilmore Stadium, and six of the last eight races at the stadium track before it was closed for good. He also won the 1950 AAA National Midget championship.

Vukovich was known for racing midgets powered by Drake engines. The Drake was a Harley-Davidson V-twin engine with specially built Drake water cooled heads. His last Drake powered midget was a Kurtis Kraft that was built by Ed and Zeke Justice, the Justice Brothers, in their shop in Glendale from a Kurtis kit. Previous to this car, Vukovich drove a &quot;Frame Rail&quot; midget that was also powered by a Drake engine.

=== Indianapolis 500 ===

In 1952, his second year in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway&#x27;s 500-Mile Race, he quickly moved up from his starting position in the middle of the third row to take the lead, and led 150 laps in dominant fashion before suffering steering failure on the 192nd of the 200 laps. He returned to win the race in consecutive years, 1953 and 1954. He led an astounding 71.7% of laps that he drove in competition at the track, and remains the only driver ever to lead the most laps in the race three consecutive years.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship points and participation in addition to those which they received towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Vukovich participated in five World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He started on the pole once, won twice, recorded three fastest laps, and accumulated 19 World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Death ==

Vukovich was killed in a chain-reaction crash while holding a 17-second lead on the 57th lap of the 1955 Indianapolis 500. He was exiting the second turn, trailing three slower cars—driven by Rodger Ward, Al Keller, and Johnny Boyd—when Ward&#x27;s car hit the backstretch outer wall and flipped, resting in the middle of the track as a result of a broken axle. Keller, swerving into the infield to avoid Ward, lost control and slid back onto the track, striking Boyd&#x27;s car and pushing it into Vukovich&#x27;s path. After Vukovich&#x27;s car went over the outside wall and become airborne, it cartwheeled through the air multiple times landing on top of a group of parked cars before coming to rest upside down and bursting into flames. Boyd&#x27;s car also flipped over and landed upside down as well. As the car burned, Ed Elisian stopped his undamaged car and raced towards Vukovich in an attempt to save him. It did not matter; Vukovich had perished instantly. Two spectators were also injured when Vukovich&#x27;s car landed on their Jeep.

Vukovich was the second defending Indy 500 champion to die during the race, following Floyd Roberts in 1939, and the only former winner to have been killed while leading. Roberts&#x27; car was also thrown over the backstretch fence after exiting the second turn in his fatal accident. Since the 1955 race was counted as part of the Formula One World Championship, Vukovich is also the first driver to be killed during a World Championship race.

Bill Vukovich is buried at Belmont Memorial Park, Fresno, California. The Fresno Junior Chamber of Commerce established the &quot;Billy Vukovich Memorial Scholarship Fund&quot; to honor the two-time winner of the Indy 500 with a living memorial. The fund was directed to the Fresno State College and was open to young men interested in preparing themselves to teach automotive mechanics in high schools.

== Family and personal life ==

Vukovich married Esther Schmidt, the two meeting during a blind date several months previously. Vukovich was shy, and the couple&#x27;s early courtship saw him use Esther&#x27;s younger sister as a go-between when setting up dates. The couple had two children: a daughter, Marlene, born in 1941; and a son, William John, born in 1944. Vukovich&#x27;s son, known as Bill Vukovich II; and his grandson, Bill Vukovich III, also became racing drivers. Both competed in the Indianapolis 500, with Vukovich II finishing second in 1973, and Vukovich III being named the Rookie of the Year in 1988. Vukovich III died on November 25, 1990, in a crash during practice for a CRA race at Mesa Marin Raceway, in Bakersfield, California.

== Awards and honors ==

Vukovich has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame (1959)
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1972)
* National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1990)
* International Motorsports Hall of Fame (1991)

<text>Bislig, officially the City of Bislig (; ), is a component city in the province of Surigao del Sur, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 99,290 people.

It is the most populous among the cities and municipalities in the province of Surigao del Sur.

Barangay Mangagoy, the downtown area often dubbed by its residents as &quot;the little city within the city&quot;, is the center of trade and industry of Bislig which has a population of 32,464 as of the 2015 estimate. It is the largest barangay in the city and the entire province of Surigao del Sur in terms of population. Since Barangay Poblacion is often referred by the locals simply as &#x27;Bislig&#x27;, Mangagoy on the other hand is often mistaken as a separate town though it is only just one out of the 24 barangays that comprises the entire City of Bislig.

In 2000, Bislig was converted into a city per Republic Act 8804. It is geographically the easternmost city in the Philippines.

==Etymology==

The legendary allusions as to how Bislig got its name could be traced back to the era prior to the coming of the Spanish conquistadors. The town got its name from a forest vine of the rattan family that grew in abundance along the banks of its rivers. This vine was noted for its strength and became known for saving a royal couple who crossed the swollen river in one of their hunting expeditions and who almost died as they were carried downstream by the rushing current. The legend has it that these hunters had already lost hope of surviving until they were able to cling to a vine which was about 1/4 inch in diameter called Bislig. As a sign of thanksgiving, the ruler named this place Bislig.

Historically, Bislig derived its name from the word &quot;bizlin&quot;, a kind of gold, &quot;which is worth two pesos a tael. The weight of a tael is one and one-eight ounces&quot; in the 16th century, which the natives used for trade and barter. Prior to the coming of Spaniards, this terminology was understood in Luzon and in Mindanao. In the report of the Administrator of Royal Properties Andres Mirandaola dated September 8, 1573, sent to King Philip of Spain that &quot;much gold found in the island of Mindanao, District of Butuan, Surigao ...&quot; It is believed that this kind of gold found in the rolling hills and mountains of the southernmost portion of Bislig and Agusan Province.

However, historical records shows that the name has been variously spelled by the Spanish chroniclers. Conquistador Miguel de Loarca, in his extreme exploratory survey trip of the archipelago, first mentioned and spelled it &quot;Beslin&quot; in his historical accounts &quot;Relacion de los Yslas Filipinas&quot; in 1582, as well as in the Confirmaciones de Encomienda (1616–1700) which Bislig was under the encomienda of Alferez Juan delas Marianas in 1619. In the &quot;Historia general de los religiosos descalzos del orden de San Agustin&quot; of Fray Andres de San Nicolas in 1664 spelled it &quot;Bislin&quot; and also in the &quot;Historia general... del Orden de San Agustin&quot; of Fray Luis de Jesus in 1681. A Franciscan writer, Fray Juan de San Francisco de San Antonio spelled it &quot;Baslig&quot; in his &quot;Cronicas&quot; in 1738. Other Spanish chroniclers spelled it &quot;Bislic&quot; and &quot;Bisliq&quot;.

In the first detailed map of the Philippines in 1749, published in &quot;Historia de la Provincia de Filipinas&quot; by a Jesuit, Father Pedro Murillo Velarde spelled it Bislig, as did in the &quot;Historia General ...&quot; of Fray Pedro San Francisco de Assis in 1768 and in the &quot;Mapa dela Provincia de Caraga&quot; by Francisco Alegre in 1751. A complete statistical data of District of Caraga compiled in 1750 spelled as &quot;Bislig&quot;, and also in the document titled &quot;Provincia de San Nicolas de Tolentino de Agustinos descalzos dela Congregacion de España y Indias&quot; in 1879.

From the time on, it is known and spelled as Bislig.

==Geography==
Bislig is approximately northeast of Davao City, south of Tandag City (the provincial capital), south of Hinatuan, and southeast of Butuan.

Bislig has a land area of 40,503 hectares spread over 24 barangays, with close to half, which are tropical rainforests, is classified as &quot;public forest&quot;.

==History==

The first inhabitants of Bislig were believed to have come from the Agusan Valley in the hinterlands of Mindanao beyond the Magdiwata Mountains. These people used spears, bows and arrows and lived a semi-nomadic life and were called Manobos.

They were ruled during the later part of the seventeenth century by a native leader called &quot;Bagani&quot;, meaning a formidable leader. They were very brave, tough and war-like. They also introduced edible crops such as rice, corn and rootcrops to the area.

At the turn of the century, Spanish colonizers and missionaries imposed the rule of Spain and brought with them Tagalogs, Ilonggos, and Cebuanos from the north as members of their expeditionary forces.

Long before it became a town on January 1, 1921, per Executive Order No. 62 issued by Governor General Francis Burton Harrison on December 28, 1920 (with Primitivo A. Castillo as its first Municipal President, Vice-president: Sulpicio P. Laurente &amp; Councilors: Ciriaco Alba; Bartolome Alvar; Higino Basañez; Escolastico Carmen; Tomas Masancay; Basilio Dua; and Macario Tenchavez), Bislig was already an established political instrumentality or &quot;pueblo&quot; in the Province of Surigao (now Surigao del Sur and Surigao del Norte). Earlier, the province was a part of an even bigger territory stretching from northeastern Mindanao down to the island&#x27;s southeastern &quot;pueblo&quot; of Caraga and Man-ay in Davao Oriental. Caraga was originally the seat of political, military and religious authority.

Following its becoming a town, efforts were made to improve and develop Bislig until the advent of its citihood campaign in 1999; and by virtue of Republic Act No. 8804, Bislig was converted into a component city. This was duly ratified and approved in a plebiscite conducted on September 18, 2000.

==Demographics==

A local language, called Kamayo is sometimes used by the residents, though they usually use the more general Cebuano language of the region.

==Economy==
Bislig is the largest town on the eastern coast of Mindanao. Situated between Mati in the south and Surigao City in the north, it serves as a commercial center for Surigao del Sur and northern Davao Oriental. It is also accessible by road from the landlocked municipalities of Agusan del Sur and Davao de Oro. It markets itself as a center of organic high-value crops and aquamarine products.
Barangay Mangagoy is the center of trade and industry of the city which has a population of roughly 50,000 and is the largest barangay in population in the entire province of Surigao del Sur. Espiritu Street and the adjacent areas is colloquially often referred simply to as &#x27;Barrio&#x27; by the locals. It is where most of commercial activity in Mangagoy is located. It houses national and local banks, restaurants, and service centers. There are also accommodating inns and hotels, as well as motorized tricycles, jeepneys, and buses ply its concrete roads and highways.

Bislig was the location of the defunct company PICOP Resources, Inc. (PRI, or previously known as the &quot;Paper Industries Corporation of the Philippines&quot;), which was the largest paper mill in Asia and one of the largest in the world. Established in 1963, it was involved in both logging (raw material extraction) and paper &amp; pulp manufacturing, one of the first companies in the world to feature this integrated approach to paper &amp; pulp production. PICOP attracted workers from around the country and helped boost Bislig&#x27;s population, converting the then-sleepy outskirt barangay of Mangagoy into a boomtown. PICOP&#x27;s forest concessions extended into Barangay Tabon and included an area where the Philippine eagle lived. The company reached its peak in 1984. However, during the late 1980s the company started to falter caused by several issues, with political turmoil and mismanagement, to name a few. PICOP began to mount losses and in a couple of decades, concluded operations. It ended operations in 2001 and completely shut down by 2008. The closure caused massive problems in Bislig, whose local economy was deeply intertwined with the company.

In a televised press conference aired by the Presidential Communications in September 2020, construction firm JM McGregor Haggens, Inc. announced that they will be embarking in a multi-billion peso port complex in Bislig to be called &quot;The Maritime City&quot;, the first of its kind in the country. The hub will consist of at least 15 projects, including an oil refinery, oil depot, shipyard, container port, cold storage, food processing plant, power plant, water treatment facility, hospital, hotel, integrated market, convention center, and a government center. The first phase of construction is scheduled in early 2021. The said project will be funded by Aria Indonesia-Aria Asset Management of Luxembourg and nine other entities from different countries.
==Tourism==

Known for its ecotourism, Bislig&#x27;s main tourist attraction is the Tinuy-an Falls, known as the little &quot;Niagara Falls&quot; of the Philippines. It is a white water curtain that flows in three levels about 55 meters high and 95 meters wide. Its critically acclaimed majestic and unique natural formation was once appeared in the International Travel Magazine. It is also said to be the widest waterfalls in the Philippines.
Other known tourist attractions include: the white-sand beaches of Hagonoy Island; the various white sand beaches in Barangay Lawigan facing and considered a part of the Pacific Ocean; the underground river of the educational Delot and Hinayagan Cave; the Togonan Falls in Barangay Sibaroy which is a 30-minute ride a far from the city proper; the wild sanctuary of the Forester&#x27;s Park; the wide range waters of the Mone River and the man-made Lake 77 which offers a boat ride tour and a floating cottage ideal for picnic and fishing; the Kamayo Heritage Park; the Cawa-Cawa Sa Awog; the Sian Falls; the Bislig Hot Spring; the Florland Inland Resort in Barangay San Vicente; the Maria Regina Highland Farm and Resort in Dao-Dao, Barangay San Fernando; the Chocolate Beach ideal for the avid mud skim boarding enthusiasts; the newly developed Mabakat beach (the former Dampingan area) ideal for surfing aficionados; the International Doll House at the Ocean View Park in Barangay Comawas; and the City Baywalk Park. Trekking and bird watching could also be available in Bislig&#x27;s densely natural forested areas.

Bislig hosts an annual festival called &quot;The Karawasan Festival&quot; during the charter day of the city which features an inter-school ethnic dance competition. Karawasan came from a local dialect which means &quot;movement of the crabs&quot;. Karawasan is held every 17th day of September. It was replaced by the &quot;Tinuy-an (Sayaw) Festival&quot; since September 2013 and reinstated in 2019.

===Festivals and events===
* Tinuy-an Sayaw Festival : Bislig&#x27;s major festival celebrated every September 17. It is the city&#x27;s co-major event along with the Karawasan Festival.
* Charter Day Celebration : Celebrated from September 16 to 18, the city celebrate its cityhood.

* Poblacion Fiesta : Celebrated every September 22, the feast day of Santo Tomas de Villanueva.
* Uli Bislig : Celebrated every September 16, it literally means &quot;going back home to Bislig&quot;.
* Karawasan Festival : As part of the Charter Day Celebration, a dream come true for the City Government of Bislig. Karawasan is a festival of ethnic dances depicting the movement of crabs. Karawasan is actually a collective name given to the member of the crab family found to be great in the salty and freshwater of Bislig. The lavishness of such local marine resource has, in fact, made Bislig known to other places in the country. It was replaced by the &quot;Tinuy-an Sayaw Festival&quot; until it was reinstated in 2019.

==Transportation==
===Airport===
The concrete runway of Bislig Airport can accommodate light commercial planes of the Fokker 50 class, though most of the time the airport is only used for the occasional private plane.

Private and government charter planes and choppers still usually land at the airport.

The city had developed sea ports at Barangay Lawigan and Caramcam District in Barangay Mangagoy for the increasing demand of people travelling to other provinces. Currently, operations of the Lawigan sea port is placed on hold due to project constraints.

<doc id="1251964" wikidata="Q1479937" url="?curid=1251964" title="Stanford University Press">
<text>Stanford University Press (SUP) is the publishing house of Stanford University. It is one of the oldest academic presses in the United States and the first university press to be established on the West Coast. It is currently a member of the Association of University Presses. The press publishes 130 books per year across the humanities, social sciences, and business, and has more than 3,500 titles in print.

== History ==
David Starr Jordan, the first president of Stanford University, posited four propositions to Leland and Jane Stanford when accepting the post, the last of which stipulated, &quot;That provision be made for the publication of the results of any important research on the part of professors, or advanced students. Such papers may be issued from time to time as &#x27;Memoirs of the Leland Stanford Junior University.&#x27;&quot; In 1892, the first work of scholarship to be published under the Stanford name, &quot;The Tariff Controversy in the United States, 1789-1833&quot;, by Orrin Leslie Elliott, appeared with the designation &quot;No. 1&quot; in the &quot;Leland Stanford Junior University Monographs Series.&quot; That same year, student Julius Andrew Quelle established a printing company on campus, publishing the student-run newspaper, the &quot;Daily Palo Alto&quot; (now the &quot;Stanford Daily&quot;) and Stanford faculty articles and books. The first use of the imprint &quot;Stanford University Press&quot; was in 1895, with &quot;The Story of the Innumerable Company&quot;, by President Jordan. In 1915, Quelle hired bookbinder John Borsdamm, who would later draw fellow craftspeople to the press, including master printer and eventual manager Will A. Friend. In 1917, the university bought the printing works, making it a division of Stanford.

In 1925, SUP hired William Hawley Davis, Professor of English, to be the inaugural general editor at the press. In the following year, SUP issued its first catalog, listing seventy-five published books. University President Ray Lyman Wilbur established a Special Committee in 1927 comprising the editor, the press manager, the sales manager, and the comptroller in service of the press, whose &quot;principal object is to serve in the publication of University publications of all sorts and to promote human welfare generally.&quot;

The first press director, Donald P. Bean, was appointed in 1945. By the 1950s, the printing plant ranked seventh nationally among university presses with respect to title output. The head book designer in the late 1950s and 1960s was printer and typographer Jack Stauffacher, later an AIGA medalist.

In 1999, the press became a division of the Stanford University Libraries. It moved from its previous location adjacent to the Stanford campus to its current location, in Redwood City, in 2012–13.

Stanford Business Books, an imprint for professional titles in business, launched in 2000, with two publications about Silicon Valley. The press launched the Briefs imprint in 2012, featuring short-form publications across its entire list. With funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, SUP debuted a publishing program for born-digital interactive scholarly works in 2015. That same year, it launched its trade imprint, Redwood Press, with a novel by Bahiyyah Nakhjavani.

In April 2019, the provost of Stanford University announced plans to cease providing funds for the press, drawing widespread criticism. Following protests from Stanford faculty and students, as well as the wider academic and publishing community, the subsidy for the 2019–20 academic year was reinstated, with additional options for future fundraising on the press&#x27;s part to be discussed.

== 1933 murder case ==
In 1933, David Lamson, a sales manager at SUP, was accused of murdering his wife, Allene, at their home on the Stanford campus. Janet Lewis, wife of Stanford poet Yvor Winters, campaigning for Lamson&#x27;s acquittal, wrote a pamphlet emphasizing the dangers of using circumstantial evidence. Lamson was ultimately released after being tried four times.

<text>Princeton University Press is an independent publisher with close connections to Princeton University. Its mission is to disseminate scholarship within academia and society at large.

The press was founded by Whitney Darrow, with the financial support of Charles Scribner, as a printing press to serve the Princeton community in 1905. Its distinctive building was constructed in 1911 on William Street in Princeton. Its first book was a new 1912 edition of John Witherspoon&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on Moral Philosophy.&quot;

==History==
Princeton University Press was founded in 1905 by a recent Princeton graduate, Whitney Darrow, with financial support from another Princetonian, Charles Scribner II. Darrow and Scribner purchased the equipment and assumed the operations of two already existing local publishers, that of the &quot;Princeton Alumni Weekly&quot; and the Princeton Press. The new press printed both local newspapers, university documents, &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;, and later added book publishing to its activities. Beginning as a small, for-profit printer, Princeton University Press was reincorporated as a nonprofit in 1910. Since 1911, the press has been headquartered in a purpose-built gothic-style building designed by Ernest Flagg. The design of press&#x27;s building, which was named the Scribner Building in 1965, was inspired by the Plantin-Moretus Museum, a printing museum in Antwerp, Belgium. Princeton University Press established a European office, in Woodstock, England, north of Oxford, in 1999, and opened an additional office, in Beijing, in early 2017.

Princeton University Press joined The Association of American Publishers trade organization in the Hachette v. Internet Archive lawsuit which resulted in the removal of access to over 500,000 books from global readers.

==Pulitzers and other major awards==
Six books from Princeton University Press have won Pulitzer Prizes:
*&quot;Russia Leaves the War&quot; by George F. Kennan (1957)
*&quot;Banks and Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War&quot; by Bray Hammond (1958)
*&quot;Between War and Peace&quot; by Herbert Feis (1961)
*&quot;Washington: Village and Capital&quot; by Constance McLaughlin Green (1963)
*&quot;The Greenback Era&quot; by Irwin Unger (1965)
*&quot;Machiavelli in Hell&quot; by Sebastian de Grazia (1989)

Books from Princeton University Press have also been awarded the Bancroft Prize, the Nautilus Book Award, and the National Book Award.

==Papers projects==
Multi-volume historical documents projects undertaken by the press include:
* &quot;The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein&quot;
* &quot;The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau&quot;
* &quot;The Papers of Woodrow Wilson&quot; (sixty-nine volumes)
* &quot;The Papers of Thomas Jefferson&quot;
* &quot;Kierkegaard&#x27;s Writings&quot;

&quot;The Papers of Woodrow Wilson&quot; has been called &quot;one of the great editorial achievements in all history.&quot;

==Bollingen Series==
Princeton University Press&#x27;s Bollingen Series had its beginnings in the Bollingen Foundation, a 1943 project of Paul Mellon&#x27;s Old Dominion Foundation. From 1945, the foundation had independent status, publishing and providing fellowships and grants in several areas of study, including archaeology, poetry, and psychology. The Bollingen Series was given to the university in 1969.

<text>Robert Charles &quot;Bob&quot; Sweikert (May 20, 1926 – June 17, 1956) was an American racing driver, best known as the winner of the 1955 Indianapolis 500 and the 1955 National Championship, as well as the 1955 Midwest Sprint car championship – the only driver in history to sweep all three during a single racing season.

== Personal life ==

Robert Charles Schweikart grew up in pre-war Los Angeles. His surname was later changed to Sweikert to avoid anti-German sentiment before WWII. His mother had married his stepfather, an electrician for the state of California, when Bob was an infant. Bob was raised through his early teen years with his older stepbrother, Ed, who enlisted in the US Navy, and then soon died in 1942, at the onset of World War II. That year the family moved briefly to San Francisco, then across the bay to the rural town of Hayward, California. There in high school Bob met his future wife, Dorie.

From age 16 Sweikert worked after school as a mechanic at the local Ford dealership in Hayward. A naturally gifted mechanic, he frequently won street races throughout the East Bay. One of his frequent local competitors on the streets was Ed Elisian, a teenage boy from nearby Oakland, California. A dozen years later, Elisian and Sweikert were engaged in the racing duel that led to Sweikert&#x27;s fatal crash at Salem Speedway.

In late 1944, Sweikert enrolled in the US Army Air Force, but suffered a severe knee injury while training at Lowry Field in Colorado. With months to heal and the war over, he was honorably discharged in September 1945.

In 1947, Sweikert met his first wife, Marion Edwards, at a party at UCLA. During 1947 Sweikert began mailing monthly accounts of his life to Veda Orr, through April 1956. Karl &amp; Veda Orr built &amp; operated their own race cars. Veda wrote many racing articles.

Sweikert returned to Hayward and opened his own small business, Sweikert Automotive, an automotive repair shop based out of his parents&#x27; garage. There over the next couple years, he built his own track roadster. On Memorial Day, May 26, 1947 Sweikert ran his first race for prize money at the Oakland Speedway, and finished second.

Sweikert then quit automotive repair and became a full-time driver. He gained his first racing sponsorship in July 1947, when he became a track roadster race driver for Hubbard Auto Parts of Oakland.

In early 1948, he married Marion Edwards. They had a large family wedding in West L.A. The same year, Sweikert moved up to midget cars, and won his first training race with the Bay Cities Racing Association. He ran seventy-two races that first BCRA season, finishing 14th out of 130 active members in the annual point standings.

In late 1952 his first wife, Marion, started divorce proceedings. Sweikert fought for custody of their young daughter. Sweikert&#x27;s mother, Grace, often visited Bob&#x27;s firstborn until Grace died.

In January 1953, Sweikert married his high school sweetheart, divorcee Dorie with her two children, with whom he had recently become reacquainted. They settled in Indiana, to be close to the Speedway where Sweikert hoped to race and win.

== Driving career ==

On February 12, 1949 Sweikert won the first BCRA Indoor Midget Race Track championship, in Oakland, on the new 1/12 mile oval track.

Sweikert&#x27;s first chance at driving a Sprint car came next in 1949. He drove in northern California that year and later in Los Angeles.

After 1949 Sweikert became close friends with Johnny Boyd of Fresno, California when he met him on the California racing circuit. The two often raced together, and Boyd qualified for entry in the 1955 Indianapolis 500 when Sweikert helped him overcome mechanical handling problems in Boyd&#x27;s car.

In May 1952, Sweikert ran his first Indianapolis 500. He entered at the 32nd starting position and ran for 77 laps in the McNamara Special car.

On September 12, 1953 Sweikert became the first driver ever to break on a one-mile (1.6 km) oval track, at the Eastern Speed Dome, Syracuse, New York.

On September 26, 1953 Sweikert won the Hoosier Hundred, at the Indiana State Fairgrounds, a race which is chronicled by many as &quot;the greatest race ever&quot; run.

On September 11, 1954 Sweikert became the first driver ever to average in a race, with his win in the Lutes Truck Parts Special #17 car at the Eastern Speed Dome in Syracuse.

On May 30, 1955 Sweikert won the Indianapolis 500 from the 14th starting position in the Zink Kurtis roadster #6. That car now resides in the Museum at the Indianapolis racetrack. In the winner&#x27;s circle, Sweikert and Dorie celebrated with singer-actress Dinah Shore.

In September 1955 Sweikert became the only driver in history to win the Indianapolis 500, the AAA big car National Championship, and the Midwest sprint car championship in the same season.

In May 1956, at his final return to the Indianapolis 500, Sweikert began in the 10th starting position and came in for a 6th-place finish, with the team&#x27;s D-A Lubricant roadster.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship points and participation in addition to those which they received towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Sweikert participated in five World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He won once, and accumulated eight World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Death ==

Sweikert&#x27;s fatal sprint car crash occurred on June 17, 1956, at Salem Speedway. While completing the third lap, Sweikert was running near the outside wall in 4th place, side by side with his past teenage East Bay streets rival, Ed Elisian, in 5th. Coming out of the 4th turn, the two cars started down the straightaway in front of the grandstand. Running close to the wall, Sweikert&#x27;s right rear wheel clipped a steel beam sticking out onto the track from the wall at the end of the stands. The sprint car flew over the edge of the track, down the embankment, and landed a hundred feet below, where it briefly burst into flames. Sweikert was pronounced dead upon arrival at Washington County Hospital.

He is buried at Lone Tree Cemetery in Fairview, California.

Veith drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing from 1955 to 1968 with 63 starts. He finished in the top ten 37 times, with a best finish of 2nd twice, both in 1958.

Veith suffered bruises and abrasions in a practice crash at Daytona International Speedway on March 29, 1959. He was saved by the roll bar when sliding upside down. The accident was caused by the starter shaft, which had been left in the car.

Veith qualified for his first Indianapolis 500 in 1956, finishing 7th that year to win the Rookie of the Year award. After another top 10 finish the next year, he qualified 4th in 1958 but was knocked out of the race in a first lap accident that killed Pat O&#x27;Connor. He competed in the 500 eight more times, with his last start coming in 1968.

<text>The Beriev A-50 (NATO reporting name: Mainstay) is a Soviet-origin airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft that is based on the Ilyushin Il-76 transport plane. Developed to replace the Tupolev Tu-126 &quot;Moss&quot;, the A-50 first flew in 1978. Its existence was revealed to the Western Bloc in 1978 by Adolf Tolkachev. It entered service in 1985, with about 40 produced by 1992.

==Design and development==
===A-50===
The mission personnel of the 15-man crew derive data from the large Liana surveillance radar with its antenna in an over-fuselage rotodome, which has a diameter of Detection range is for air targets and for ground targets.

The A-50 can control up to ten fighter aircraft for either air-to-air intercept or air-to-ground attack missions. The A-50 can fly for four hours with a range of from its base, at a maximum takeoff weight of . The aircraft can be refuelled by Il-78 tankers.

The radar &quot;Vega-M&quot; is designed by MNIIP, Moscow, and produced by NPO Vega. The &quot;Vega-M&quot; can track up to 150 targets simultaneously within . Large targets, like surface ships, can be tracked at a distance of .

===A-50U===
Development work on a modernized version, the A-50U, began in 2003; state tests started on 10 September 2008, using a Russian Air Force A-50 &quot;37 Red&quot; as a prototype. It replaces analog avionics with a new digital avionics suite, made by NPO Vega, that speeds data processing and improves signal tracking and target detection. Crew rest, toilet and galley facilities are also included in the upgrade.

After completing the joint state tests, Beriev delivered the first A-50U to the Russian Air Force. The aircraft, &quot;47 Red&quot;, RF-92957, was handed over at Beriev&#x27;s facility in Taganrog on 31 October 2011. It was accepted by an aircrew serving with the 2457th Aviation Base for Combat Operation of Airborne Early Warning Aircraft (Aviabaza Boevogo Primeneniya Samolyotov Dal&#x27;nego Radiolokatsionnogo Obnaruzheniya) at Ivanovo Severny, which is the only base using the A-50 operationally (it operates 16 aircraft). The fourth A-50U, &quot;41 Taganrog&quot;, was delivered to the Russian Aerospace Forces on 7 March 2017. The fifth A-50U, &quot;45 Red&quot;, was delivered on 6 December 2018. Eight A-50U aircraft have been delivered .

The A-50U upgrade forms the basis of the concept for Beriev A-100 AEW&amp;C. Its configuration will be similar, but with a new Vega &quot;Premier&quot; active electronically scanned array radar.

It has been announced by Rostec that production of the A-50U will restart in 2024. However, it is likely that production resumption will be delayed for a few years.

==Operational history==
=== In peacetime ===
The aircraft entered service with the 67th Independent Aviation Squadron, Long-Range Airborne Surveillance (67 OAE DRLO) (в/ч 32457) in 1984 at Šiauliai in Lithuanian SSR. The unit was redesignated the 144th Independent Regiment DRLO, (в/ч 89449) and then later moved to Pechora Kamenka (often referred to as &quot;Berezovka&quot;) in 1998.

There was a detachment (two A-50s and one Il-76) as part of the 192nd Guards Kerch Red Banner Military Transport Aviation Regiment (в/ч 26212), Ukurey Airfield Chita Oblast in Russia from 1985 to 1995. It was formed at the Ulan-Ude (Vostochny) airfield in 1985, and flew to Ukurei in 1988. It was disbanded in 1995 and aircraft transferred to the 144th Independent Regiment. The 18th Independent Aviation Detachment DRLO (two A-50s and 1 Il-76) was established at the Vitebsk-Severny airfield from 1985. In 1993, the detachment was disestablished. 

Two aircraft &quot;operated round-the-clock over [the] Black Sea during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm of the Gulf War (1990–1991), monitoring United States Air Force operations from Turkey and keeping a watch for &quot;stray&quot; cruise missiles.&quot;

=== Syrian Civil War ===
In late December 2015, the A-50 started operations over Syria, flying from Russia, to support Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===
In December 2018, it was deployed to Crimea.

On 26 February 2023, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Association of Security Forces of Belarus (BYPOL), a partisan group, reported that it had conducted a drone attack and damaged a Russian A-50 at the Machulishchy air base near Minsk, Belarus. The attacked base also hosts MiG-31 fighters used to attack Ukraine. However, satellite imagery of the Machulishchy air base from 28 February showed no significant damage to the sole A-50 located there. The drone operators posted a video of a practice run of the alleged A-50U bombing on YouTube on 2 March 2023, which shows the drone flying into Machulishchy unopposed, then landing on the A-50&#x27;s rotodome. On 3 March 2023, the drone operators posted a second video showing a drone landing on the domed area on top of the fuselage just forward of the wings followed by a loss of video signal claimed to be due to the actual explosion.

On 17 November 2023, the British Defence Ministry believes that it is &quot;likely&quot; Russian forces are updating their A-50 early warning aircraft in anticipation of the West supplying modern fighter jets such as the F-16. The aircraft may also be integrated with the ground based S-400 missile systems.

Ukrainian forces claimed to have shot down an A-50 over the Sea of Azov on 14 January 2024 while it was on duty in the Kyrylivka area. The A-50 reportedly disappeared from radar and stopped responding to requests from tactical aviation. Later several Western and Ukrainian sources reported that the pilot of a Su-30 aircraft of the Russian Air Force detected the fire and crash of an unidentified aircraft in the area, presumably the A-50. &quot;Forbes&quot; journalist David Axe cited one analyst who claimed that Ukrainian Air Force first disabled Russian radars across Crimea, causing the Russians to reestablish radar coverage there by moving their A-50 north to near Berdyansk thus within range of a Ukrainian SAM battery. This claimed downing of an A-50 was further claimed to leave the Russian air force with just two serviceable A-50s. , the Kremlin had neither confirmed nor denied the downing of an A-50. Open source analysts later identified that the aircraft lost was A-50U &quot;37 red&quot; of the 610th Center for Combat Use and Retraining of Military Transport Aviation Flight Personnel (610th CBP i PLS), based at Ivanovo Severny.

On 23 February 2024, Ukrainian official sources claimed the downing of a second A-50U aircraft, over Krasnodar Krai, at 18:44 Ukraine local time.
Ukrainian armed forces claim to have used a long-range S-200 system to shoot down the A-50 in the evening of 23 February over the Sea of Azov. According to Ukrainian sources, 10 Russians were killed on the plane, including five majors. The aircraft was later identified as A-50U &quot;42 red&quot; of the 610th CBP i PLS. Kyrylo Budanov claimed, as of February 2024, Russia had six operational A-50s.

Also, the Taganrog Beriev Aviation Scientific and Technical Complex where the A-50 are repaired suffered damage overnight from March 8-March 9, 2024, possibly from a Ukrainian drone strike.

<text>Robert Kay Ball (August 26, 1925 – February 27, 1954) was an American racecar driver.

==Early life==
Ball&#x27;s parents divorced when he was a year old. He was raised by his grandmother, who enrolled him in a military academy as a teenager in an attempt to take his mind off cars and motorcycles.

==Racing career==
Ball began racing with the Arizona Roadster Association, subsequently switching from roadsters to midgets. He won the Arizona State Midget Association (ASMA) championship in 1949 and 1950. He finished fifth in the 1951 Indianapolis 500 and 32nd in the 1952 Indianapolis 500.

Ball won the AAA Championship race at San Jose in November 1952. On January 4, 1953, he was involved in an accident at Carrell Speedway in Los Angeles which left him with terrible head injuries. He remained in a coma, first at the UCLA Medical Center and then at home in Phoenix, but died 14 months later of an infection.

==Bobby Ball Memorial==

For many years, one of the two championship races held at Phoenix International Raceway was a memorial race dedicated to Ball. The Bobby Ball Memorial was first run in the fall of 1954 and 1955 as a 100-mile race on dirt, sanctioned by AAA at the Arizona State Fairgrounds. Driver Jack McGrath was killed in an accident during the 1955 race. Starting in 1956, the race was sanctioned by USAC, and continued as a 100-mile contest at the fairgrounds through its 1963 edition. In 1964, the race moved to the newly opened Phoenix International Raceway and was run at a distance of 200 miles. It continued as a 200-mile race through the 1969 edition, then was run at a 150-mile distance starting with the 1970 edition, which was won by Swede Savage. The October 1971 edition was won by A. J. Foyt, after which, the race was renamed through sponsorship from Best Western for its 1972 edition. Bobby Ball naming returned for the 1976–1978 editions, the last of which was title sponsored by Miller High Life.

<doc id="1251985" wikidata="Q1520588" url="?curid=1251985" title="Planar process">
<text>The planar process is a manufacturing process used in the semiconductor industry to build individual components of a transistor, and in turn, connect those transistors together. It is the primary process by which silicon integrated circuit chips are built, and it is the most commonly used method of producing junctions during the manufacture of semiconductor devices. The process utilizes the surface passivation and thermal oxidation methods.

The planar process was developed at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959 and process proved to be one of the most important single advances in semiconductor technology.

==Overview==
The key concept is to view a circuit in its two-dimensional projection (a plane), thus allowing the use of photographic processing concepts such as film negatives to mask the projection of light exposed chemicals. This allows the use of a series of exposures on a substrate (silicon) to create silicon oxide (insulators) or doped regions (conductors). Together with the use of metallization, and the concepts of p–n junction isolation and surface passivation, it is possible to create circuits on a single silicon crystal slice (a wafer) from a monocrystalline silicon boule.

The process involves the basic procedures of silicon dioxide (SiO2) oxidation, SiO2 etching and heat diffusion. The final steps involves oxidizing the entire wafer with an SiO2 layer, etching contact vias to the transistors, and depositing a covering metal layer over the oxide, thus connecting the transistors without manually wiring them together.

==History==
===Development===
In 1955 at Bell Labs, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick accidentally grew a layer of silicon dioxide over a silicon wafer, for which they observed surface passivation properties. In 1957, Frosch and Derick were able to manufacture the first silicon dioxide field effect transistors, the first transistors in which drain and source were adjacent at the surface, showing that silicon dioxide surface passivation protected and insulated silicon wafers. 

At Bell Labs, the importance of Frosch&#x27;s technique was immediately realized. Results of their work circulated around Bell Labs in the form of BTL memos before being published in 1957. At Shockley Semiconductor, Shockley had circulated the preprint of their article in December 1956 to all his senior staff, including Jean Hoerni. Later, Hoerni attended a meeting where Atalla presented a paper about passivation based on the previous results at Bell Labs. Taking advantage of silicon dioxide&#x27;s passivating effect on the silicon surface, Hoerni proposed to make transistors that were protected by a layer of silicon dioxide. 

Jean Hoerni, while working at Fairchild Semiconductor, had first patented the planar process in 1959. K. E. Daburlos and H. J. Patterson of Bell Laboratories continued on the work of C. Frosch and L. Derick, and developed a process similar to Hoerni’s about the same time. Together with the use of metallization (to join together the integrated circuits), and the concept of p–n junction isolation (from Kurt Lehovec), the researchers at Fairchild were able to create circuits on a single silicon crystal slice (a wafer) from a monocrystalline silicon boule.

In 1959, Robert Noyce built on Hoerni&#x27;s work with his conception of an integrated circuit (IC), which added a layer of metal to the top of Hoerni&#x27;s basic structure to connect different components, such as transistors, capacitors, or resistors, located on the same piece of silicon. The planar process provided a powerful way of implementing an integrated circuit that was superior to earlier conceptions of the integrated circuit. Noyce&#x27;s invention was the first monolithic IC chip.

Early versions of the planar process used a photolithography process using near-ultraviolet light from a mercury vapor lamp.
As of 2011, small features are typically made with 193 nm &quot;deep&quot; UV lithography. As of 2022, the ASML NXE platform uses 13.5 nm extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light, generated by a tin-based plasma source, as part of the extreme ultraviolet lithography process.

<text>The Gerstenslager Company was a maker of past model body panels for several major auto makers. In the 1950s the company was best known for making large custom vehicles such as bookmobiles, canteens and mobile television units.

==History==
The company started in 1860 as a carriage factory known as the Wehe Company in Marshallville, Ohio. In 1882 blacksmith George Gerstenslager went to work for the company, and by 1904 was the owner and eponym. In 1907, the company moved to Wooster, Ohio. In the early 1920s, Gerstenslager changed from production of buggies, surreys and wagons to van bodies and special truck bodies.

After World War II, Gerstenslager began producing custom-built mobile units such as Bookmobiles, fire rescue vehicles, dental units, canteens, mobile X-ray units, mobile hospitals, as well as mobile television units used by the major networks. The company also built vehicles for the United States Postal Service. In the early 1950s, Gerstenslager designed five Wienermobiles for the Oscar Mayer hot dog producer. In the 1960s, the company expanded to make parts for the automotive, truck and agricultural industries.

After expanding their sheet metal stamping capabilities in support of the custom truck division, the stamping division continued to grow through partnerships with most major automotive manufacturers to make aftermarket parts. In later years the stamping division became the larger part of the company and the custom truck division was shut down in 1986 so the company could focus all resources to the stamping division.

In 1997, Gerstenslager was acquired by Worthington Industries of Columbus, Ohio. In 2011, Worthington merged Gerstenslager into International Tooling Solutions to form ArtiFlex Manufacturing; Worthington remains a part-owner of ArtiFlex.

<text>The Bay Line Railroad is one of several short line railroad companies owned by Genesee &amp; Wyoming Inc. It operates between Panama City, Florida, and Dothan, Alabama, including a branch from Grimes to Abbeville, Alabama, reached via trackage rights on CSX&#x27;s Dothan Subdivision between Dothan and Grimes. The line interchanges with CSX at Cottondale, Florida and Dothan, Alabama, and with the Hilton &amp; Albany Railroad at Hilton, Georgia. 

A wide variety of commodities is carried, including aggregates, brick, cement, chemicals, coal, food and feed products, forest products, metallic ores and minerals, steel, and scrap.

==History==

The company&#x27;s main line between Panama City and Dothan was constructed in 1906–1908 by the Atlanta and St. Andrews Bay Railroad (ASAB). The Abbeville branch was constructed in 1887–1893 by the Alabama Midland Railway and came under the control of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. CSX Transportation, eventual successor to the ACL, sold the line to the Abbeville–Grimes Railway Company (AG) in 1989. This company was merged with the Bay Line Railroad on June 26, 1996.

The Stone Container Corporation had owned the ASAB since 1987. Effective January 1, 1994, it sold the assets of the railroad to Rail Management Corporation, which created the new Bay Line Railroad company to operate it. Genesee &amp; Wyoming acquired all the assets of Rail Management on June 1, 2005, including the Bay Line Railroad.

In 2016, the Bay Line Railroad entered into an agreement with the Panama City Port Authority to operate a transload facility at the port’s Intermodal Distribution Center approximately 15 miles from Port Panama City. Choice Terminals provide customers with delivery, storage, inventory management and transloading of bulk products. The Bay Line Choice Terminal features a 20-car rail yard and owns equipment to support bulk transfers. 

In 2017, the Bay Line Railroad was featured in the Panama City Living Magazine. 

As of 2023, Genesee &amp; Wyoming’s Bay Line Railroad has a total of 182 miles (44 in Alabama, and 138 in Florida (includes Chattahoochee Bay Railroad)), and has a maximum capacity of 286,000 lbs.

<doc id="1252011" wikidata="Q1761223" url="?curid=1252011" title="Alleghanian orogeny">
<text>The Alleghanian orogeny or Appalachian orogeny is one of the geological mountain-forming events that formed the Appalachian Mountains and Allegheny Mountains. The term and spelling Alleghany orogeny was originally proposed by H.P. Woodward in 1957.

The Alleghanian orogeny occurred approximately 325 million to 260 million years ago over at least five deformation events in the Carboniferous to Permian period. The orogeny was caused by Africa&#x27;s collision with North America. At the time, these continents did not exist in their current forms: North America was part of the Euramerica super-continent, while Africa was part of Gondwana. This collision formed the super-continent Pangaea, which contained all major continental land masses. The collision provoked the orogeny: it exerted massive stress on what is today the Eastern Seaboard of North America, forming a wide and high mountain chain. Evidence for the Alleghanian orogeny stretches for many hundreds of kilometres on the surface from Alabama to New Jersey and can be traced further subsurface to the southwest. In the north, the Alleghanian deformation extends northeast to Newfoundland. Subsequent erosion wore down the mountain chain and spread sediments both to the east and to the west.

==Continental collision==

The immense region involved in the continental collision, the vast temporal length of the orogeny, and the thickness of the pile of sediments and igneous rocks known to have been involved are evidence that at the peak of the mountain-building process, the Appalachians likely once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before they were eroded.

As the continents collided, the rock material trapped in-between was crushed and forced upward. With nowhere to go, rocks along the eastern margin of the North American continent were shoved far inland (the same occurred in the opposite direction along the margin of the African continent, forming the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and the western Sahara). Close to the boundary between the colliding plates, tectonic stresses contributed to the metamorphism of the rock (i.e. the transformation of igneous and sedimentary rock into metamorphic rock).

The sedimentary rock in the eastern Appalachian Basin region was squeezed into great folds that ran perpendicular to the direction of forces. The greatest amount of deformation associated with the Alleghanian orogeny occurred in the Southern Appalachians (North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia). In that region, a series of great faults developed in addition to the folds. As the two continents collided, large belts of rock bounded by thrust faults piled one on top of another, shortening the crust along the eastern edge of North America in the North Carolina and Tennessee region by as much as . The relative amount of deformation gradually diminishes northward. The fold belt extends northward through Pennsylvania and gradually fades in the vicinity of the New York border. The Kittatinny Mountains in northwestern New Jersey mark the northeasternmost extension of the high ridges of the Valley and Ridge Province. The influence of Alleghanian deformation on the regions east of the Valley and Ridge Province must have been even more intense; however, there is little evidence preserved. Rocks of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian age are missing along the Eastern Seaboard.

==Subsequent erosion==

The mountains formed by the Alleghanian orogeny were once rugged and high during the Mesozoic and late Paleozoic but in our time are eroded into only a small remnant: the heavily eroded hills of the Piedmont. Sediments that were carried eastward formed the coastal plain and part of the continental shelf. Thus, the coastal plain and Piedmont are largely the byproducts of erosion that took place from 150+ million years ago to the present. Sediments that were carried westward formed the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaux. Although people living in those respective areas sometimes refer to them as mountains, they are more accurately uplifted and eroded plateaux.

A portion of the Alleghanian mountain system departed with Africa when Pangaea broke up and the Atlantic Ocean began to form. Today, this forms the Anti-Atlas mountains of Morocco. The Anti-Atlas have been geologically uplifted in relatively recent times and are today much more rugged than their Alleghanian relatives.

<doc id="1252013" wikidata="Q661587" url="?curid=1252013" title="Yisrael Meir Lau">
<text>Yisrael (Israel) Meir Lau (; born 1 June 1937) is a Holocaust survivor who served as the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel from 1993 to 2003. He was previously Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv, Israel. After his tenure as chief rabbi, he was appointed chairman of Yad Vashem.

==Biography==
===Early life and World War II===
Lau was born on 1 June 1937, in the Polish town of Piotrków Trybunalski. His father, Rabbi Moshe Chaim Lau (), the last Chief Rabbi of the town, was murdered in the Treblinka extermination camp. Yisrael Meir is the 38th generation in an unbroken family chain of rabbis.

As a seven-year-old, after traumatic separation from his mother Chaya, Lau was imprisoned in a Nazi slave labor camp and then in Buchenwald concentration camp. He has attributed his unlikely survival to heroic efforts of his elder brother Naphtali Lau-Lavie who concealed him, at constant risk, and enlisted other prisoners in this effort. In 1945, Yisrael Meir was freed from the Buchenwald concentration camp. He became a poster child for miraculous survival, and the inhumanity of the Nazi regime, after U.S. Army chaplain Rabbi Herschel Schacter detected him hiding behind a heap of corpses when the camp was liberated. Lau has credited a teen prisoner with protecting him in the camp (later determined by historian Kenneth Waltzer to be Fedor Mikhailichenko). His entire family was murdered, with the exception of his elder brother, Naphtali Lau-Lavie, his half brother, Yehoshua Lau-Hager, and his uncle already living in Mandatory Palestine.

===Aliyah and studies===
Lau immigrated to Mandatory Palestine with his brother Naphtali in July 1945, where he was raised by an aunt and uncle, and studied in the yeshiva Kol Torah under Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach as well as in Ponevezh Yeshiva and Knesses Chizkiyahu. He was ordained as a rabbi in 1961.

===Rabbinical career===
He served as Chief Rabbi in Netanya (1978–1988), and at that time developed his reputation as a popular orator.

===Family===
Lau married Chaya Ita Frankel, a daughter of Rabbi Yitzchok Yedidya Frankel, the Rabbi of South Tel Aviv.

Lau is the father of three sons and five daughters. His eldest son, Moshe Chaim, took his place as Rabbi in Netanya in 1989; his son David became the Chief Rabbi of Modi&#x27;in, and later Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel; and his youngest, Tzvi Yehuda, is the Rabbi of North Tel Aviv. Lau is the uncle of Rabbi Binyamin (Benny) Lau, an educator and activist in the Religious Zionist movement, and Amichai Lau-Lavie, the founder and artistic director of the Jewish ritual theater company Storahtelling.

===Chairman of Yad Vashem===
In 2008, Lau was appointed chairman of Yad Vashem, succeeding Tommy Lapid.

==Rabbinical career==

Lau was ordained as a rabbi in 1961. His first rabbinic position was at the Ohr Torah synagogue in North Tel Aviv. In 1965 he was appointed as rabbi of the Tiferet Tzvi Synagogue in Tel Aviv, a position he held until 1971 when he was appointed rabbi of North Tel Aviv.

In 1978, Lau was appointed as chief rabbi of the city of Netanya. In 1983 Lau was appointed to serve on the Mo&#x27;etzet of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate. In 1988, after the death of his father-in-law, Lau was appointed to serve as chief rabbi of Tel Aviv, a position he held until 1993. When Lau met the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, in 1992, Schneerson told Lau to finish his work in Tel Aviv, as he would soon be chosen to become the Chief Rabbi of Israel. In 1993, Lau was elected Chief Rabbi of Israel. He served as Chief Rabbi till 2003.

On 9 June 2005, Lau was reinstalled as Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv returning to the post he served from 1985 until 1993.

Lau has often been characterized as the &quot;consensus rabbi&quot;, and has close ties to both Haredi and Modern Orthodox Judaism, particularly in regard to his politics, which have been characterized as moderate Zionist. One report described him as &quot;too Zionist to be considered Haredi.&quot;

He is one of the few figures in the Haredi world who has managed to gain the trust and admiration of both the Sephardic and Ashkenazic population. Lau has received some negative attention for his stances and remarks on non-Orthodox denominations of Judaism. When Lau was awarded the Israel Prize in May 2005, there were protests from the Masorti and Reform movements in Israel. Non-Orthodox leaders noted that it was ironic that Lau was being honored for &quot;bridging rifts in Israeli society&quot;. Lau&#x27;s spokespeople said that the fact that he had been approved by the (presumably heterogeneous) Prize Committee spoke for itself.

==Interfaith work==
In 1993, Rav Lau had an hour-long meeting with John Paul II at the Pope&#x27;s summer residence of Castel Gandolfo, seeking the Vatican&#x27;s moral support for the latest peace moves in the Middle East. The visit was the first between a Pope and one of Israel&#x27;s chief rabbis since the founding of the Jewish state in 1948. In 2009, he was critical of a speech given by Pope Benedict XVI during a visit to Israel. He applauded a later papal statement which gave more emphasis to the suffering of Jews during the Holocaust.

==Presidential candidacy==
In the spring of 2006, the Israeli media reported that Lau was being considered for presidency of the State of Israel. Some critics in the Israeli media wrote that Lau was more focused on maintaining his image as a progressive than in implementing such positions in the rabbinate&#x27;s policies, specifically major issues such as agunot, civil marriage, the status of Shabbat, and other divisive topics that continue to be relevant to many in the secular community vis-a-vis the Chief Rabbinate, which under Lau&#x27;s leadership usually sided with the Orthodox perspective.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2005, Lau was awarded the Israel Prize for his lifetime achievements and special contribution to society and the State of Israel.

On 14 April 2011, he was awarded the Legion of Honor (France&#x27;s highest accolade) by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in recognition of his efforts to promote interfaith dialogue.

==Views==
&quot;Let&#x27;s sit down together and let&#x27;s live together. We always knew how to die together. The time has come for us to know also how to live together, said Lau, calling for co-operation and dialogue between all Jews (Jerusalem, 14 February 1999).

At the 2006 commemoration of the massacre of Babi Yar, Lau pointed out that if the world had reacted, perhaps the Holocaust might never have happened. Implying that Hitler was emboldened by this impunity, Lau speculated: Maybe, say, this Babi Yar was also a test for Hitler. If on 29 September and 30 September 1941 Babi Yar may happen and the world did not react seriously, dramatically, abnormally, maybe this was a good test for him. So a few weeks later in January 1942, near Berlin in Wannsee, a convention can be held with a decision, a final solution to the Jewish problem. Maybe if the very action had been a serious one, a dramatic one, in September 1941 here in Ukraine, the Wannsee Conference would have come to a different end, maybe

<text>The Harbor Springs Railway was a narrow-gauge railway built at Harbor Springs, Michigan, on Little Traverse Bay on Lake Michigan. It was nicknamed the Hemlock Central because of the great numbers of hemlock trees growing in the area. The railway was chartered by Ephraim Shay, the inventor of the Shay locomotive, on February 2, 1902, but may have started construction as early as December 10, 1900.

== History ==
It was primarily a lumber-hauling operation, although summer vacationing tourists were carried for a fare of 25¢. It originally operated a route of to Stutsman and Race Mill; it was extended a mile to Carter&#x27;s Mill in 1904. Small temporary branches were also constructed as well as the moving of the right of way when logging operations moved, as was typical for a logging railroad.

The line was laid with very light rail of and worked by three locomotives built by the railroad to the design of its president and general manager, Ephraim Shay. They were geared locomotives of the typical Shay pattern but were unusual in that they had no frames, the boiler being the main structural component. The line was built and funded without debt (thanks to Shay&#x27;s royalties and licenses from his locomotive designs), and by 1906 the investment in physical plant was estimated at $51,346 (equivalent to $ in ).

The line ceased operations in 1910 and was dismantled in 1912. The company dissolved on January 17, 1912.

<doc id="1252017" wikidata="Q2880019" url="?curid=1252017" title="Baja Fresh">
<text>Baja Fresh is an American chain of fast-casual Tex Mex restaurants founded in Newbury Park, California, in 1990 and headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. It is owned by Canadian franchisor MTY Food Group. The chain emphasizes fresh ingredients, each restaurant featuring a self-serve salsa bar.

At the time of its acquisition by MTY in 2016, the chain operated 162 restaurants in the United States, Dubai, and Singapore, most of which are franchised.

==History==

===1990s===
In 1990, Jim and Linda Magglos took out a third mortgage on their home and opened the first Baja Fresh in Newbury Park, California in the Conejo Valley. Franchising began in 1995, and the chain had expanded to 31 outlets by 1997. In 1998, the Magglos worked with Greg Dollarhyde and Pete Siracusa, who recapitalized the parent company, acquired venture capital and bought shares from outside holders to take control of Baja Fresh. Dollarhyde became CEO with Siracusa as Chairman and Magglos as President, they then grew the chain from 45 locations in 1998 to 249 stores.

===2000s===
In 2002, Wendy&#x27;s International purchased Baja Fresh for $275 million. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Wendy&#x27;s, the 249 restaurant chain saw consistently declining same-store sales. In 2006, Wendy&#x27;s sold the roughly 300-location Baja Fresh chain for $31 million to BF Acquisition Holdings, a private investor consortium that had operated franchised restaurant units for such chains as Sweet Factory, Cinnabon and Denny&#x27;s. At the time of the firm&#x27;s acquisition by BF Acquisition Holdings in 2006, Baja Fresh had 144 company-owned and 154 franchised locations in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington as well as the District of Columbia. The consortium was led by David Kim, who took on the role of CEO, and later appeared on Season 2 episode 20 of the reality TV series &quot;Undercover Boss&quot;.

In 2009, Baja Fresh moved its corporate headquarters from Thousand Oaks to Cypress, California, and closed all locations in central Ohio.

===2010s===
Between 2009 and 2010, the chain closed stores in Berkeley, Pasadena and Torrance, California. When the chain opened its first international location in Dubai in 2010, the chain also had 255 restaurants in 28 U.S. states.

In late 2011, the company moved its main corporate office from Cypress to Irvine. In early 2012, the chain closed its store in Newbury Park, California, although this was a different location in Newbury Park than the original site of the first Baja Fresh.

On April 5, 2012, David Kim stepped down from his position as company CEO. His position was assumed by company president Chuck Rink, who began to hold both titles.

All five Phoenix-area locations were closed by a franchise operator without notice in mid-April 2013.

In September 2016, it was announced that Baja Fresh&#x27;s parent, BF Acquisition Holdings, was sold to MTY Food Group for $27 million. At the time of the acquisition by MTY, Baja Fresh had 162 restaurants and its sister company La Salsa had 23 restaurants with 16 of the combined 185 locations were franchised. It is unclear if the new owner would combine the two chains or keep them separate. In an earlier press release announcing MTY&#x27;s acquisition of Kahala Brands just two months previously, MTY gave the vague statement that &quot;Kahala will stay in Kahala&#x27;s current headquarters... while MTY&#x27;s US operations will move into Kahala&#x27;s offices&quot;. This statement could imply that Baja Fresh might become a subsidiary of Kahala instead of just sharing space with Kahala and reporting directly to MTY corporate headquarters in Canada. Published newspaper reports are not very clear about the exact relationship between Kahala and MTY units in the United States.

=== 2020s ===
As of late September 2024, Baja Fresh had 80 locations, 78 in the United States and 2 international ones. The majority are located along the western Coast of the United States.

==International expansion==
The first location outside of the United States was open inside the Dubai Mall in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in 2010 by franchise owner Vetra Investments. By the end of 2011, two additional locations were opened in Dubai at the Mall of the Emirates and Deira City Centre plus another location in Sharjah by the same franchisee. A fifth UAE location was opened at Mirdiff City Centre in Dubai in 2014. By the end of 2015, the lone location in Sharjah and the locations at the Dubai Mall and the Deira City Centre in Dubai were closed and replaced by a new location in the Yas Mall in Dubai. In August 2016, Vetra opened a food truck in Dubai. By 2019, Vetra had quietly abandoned its Baja Fresh UAE website and there is no news when the franchisee had finally closed all of its Baja Fresh restaurants in the Dubai.

The first location in East Asia opened in Singapore in 2012 by franchisee Gloria Foods Pte. Ltd. A second location in Singapore was opened in 2015.

The chain came to Portugal in 2020. It is also expected to come to Kuwait sometime around 2024 too.

==La Salsa==
La Salsa has been a subsidiary of Baja Fresh since 2007 when La Salsa was acquired from CKE Restaurants. Similar to Baja Fresh, La Salsa is a chain of fast-casual Tex Mex restaurants that has locations throughout the United States with most of the restaurants located in Southern California. Since its acquisition, the company had always shared corporate headquarters offices with Baja Fresh.

<doc id="1252019" wikidata="Q415744" url="?curid=1252019" title="Riluzole">
<text>Riluzole is a medication used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other motor neuron diseases. Riluzole delays the onset of ventilator-dependence or tracheostomy in some people and may increase survival by two to three months. Riluzole is available in tablet and liquid form.

==Medical use==

=== Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ===
Riluzole was approved in the United States for the treatment of ALS by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1995. A Cochrane Library review states a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year.

==Adverse effects==
* Very common (&gt;10% frequency): nausea; weakness; decreased lung function
* Common (1–10% frequency): headache; dizziness; drowsiness; vomiting; abdominal pain; increased aminotransferases
* Uncommon (0.1–1% frequency): pancreatitis; interstitial lung disease
* Rare (&lt;0.1% frequency): neutropenia; allergic reaction (including angiooedema, anaphylactoid reaction)

===Overdose===
Symptoms of overdose include: neurological and psychiatric symptoms, acute toxic encephalopathy with stupor, coma and methemoglobinemia. Severe methemoglobinemia may be rapidly reversible after treatment with methylene blue.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications for riluzole include: known prior hypersensitivity to riluzole or any of the excipients inside the preparations, liver disease, pregnancy or lactation.

== Interactions ==

CYP1A2 substrates, inhibitors and inducers would probably interact with riluzole, due its dependency on this cytochrome for metabolism.

==Mechanism of action==
Riluzole preferentially blocks TTX-sensitive sodium channels, which are associated with damaged neurons. Riluzole has also been reported to directly inhibit the kainate and NMDA receptors. The drug has also been shown to postsynaptically potentiate GABAA receptors via an allosteric binding site. However, the action of riluzole on glutamate receptors has been controversial, as no binding of the drug to any known sites has been shown for them. In addition, as its antiglutamatergic action is still detectable in the presence of sodium channel blockers, it is also uncertain whether or not it acts via this way. Rather, its ability to stimulate glutamate uptake seems to mediate many of its effects. In addition to its role in accelerating glutamate clearance from the synapse, riluzole may also prevent glutamate release from presynaptic terminals. Since CK1δ plays a key role in TDP-43 proteinopathy, a pathological hallmark of ALS, this could help to better decipher drug mechanism of action.

==Synthesis==

Riluzole can be prepared beginning with the reaction of 4-(trifluoromethoxy)aniline with potassium thiocyanate followed by reaction with bromine, forming the thiazole ring. 

== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===
Riluzole was approved for medical use in the European Union in October 1996.

==Research==
A number of case studies and randomized controlled trials have indicated that riluzole, which is neuroprotective and a glutamate modulator, may have use in mood and anxiety disorders. However, it failed in trials of Huntington&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Riluzole has been investigated in rodent models for its potential ability to protect against noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. These protective effects are believed to be caused by riluzole&#x27;s antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, but other mechanisms, including modulation of glutamate signaling, are also being investigated. However, further research, especially in human trials, is necessary to confirm these findings and establish riluzole&#x27;s clinical efficacy for treating hearing loss.

A sublingual reformulation of riluzole that originated at Yale University and is known by the code name BHV-0223 is under development for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and mood disorders by Biohaven Pharmaceuticals. A prodrug formulation of riluzole, troriluzole, has been researched as a potential treatment for several different conditions.

<text>The Irma Hotel is a landmark in Cody, Wyoming. It was built by William F. &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody, the city&#x27;s co-founder and namesake who named it after his daughter Irma Cody. A focal point is a famous back bar made of cherry that was a gift given by Queen Victoria to Buffalo Bill.

The Irma opened with a party on November 18, 1902, to which Cody invited the press and dignitaries from as far away as Boston. The hotel quickly became the social center of Cody. In the meantime, Buffalo Bill was under pressure from creditors and was forced to sign over the hotel to his wife Louisa in 1913, who was at that time on bad terms with him. After Cody&#x27;s death in 1917 the hotel was foreclosed upon and sold to Barney Link. Before the end of the year Link&#x27;s estate sold the property back to Louisa, who kept it until she died in 1925. The new owners, Henry and Pearl Newell, gradually expanded the hotel, building an annex around 1930 on the west side to accommodate automobile-borne visitors. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1940, Pearl Newell operated the hotel until her own death in 1965. She left the hotel&#x27;s extensive collection of Buffalo Bill memorabilia to the Buffalo Bill Historical Center, and stipulated that proceeds from the estate be used as an endowment for the museum.

The Irma Hotel is still open for business as both a hotel and restaurant. It is included on the National Register of Historic Places, listed in 1973.

<text>Paul Reaney (born 22 October 1944) is an English former international footballer. He played primarily as a right-sided full-back. He made 745 first-team appearances at Leeds United from 1962 to 1978, winning seven major trophies under Don Revie&#x27;s management. As a player of mixed race, Reaney became the second non-white footballer (after Frank Soo) to represent the men&#x27;s senior England national football team in 1968, when he gained the first of his three senior caps. Later in his career, Reaney played for Bradford City and Newcastle KB United.

==Career==
===Leeds United===
Reaney moved to the West Riding of Yorkshire from London as a child and left school at 15. He was briefly a car mechanic before Don Revie signed him for Leeds as an apprentice. He made his professional debut shortly before his 18th birthday, and went on to make 35 League appearances in his first season, and was part of the team that won the Second Division in 1964.

In the 1964–65 season, Reaney missed just one League game, and scored the first of his League goals as Leeds challenged for both the League championship and FA Cup; however, Leeds lost out on both trophies, with Manchester United winning the title, whilst Liverpool beat Leeds in the FA Cup final.

Reaney quickly earned a reputation as a fiercely competitive, disciplined defender, capable of closing out the most talented of attackers – George Best rated Reaney as one of the two best defenders he played against.

In 1967–68 Leeds won the League Cup and the Fairs Cup, and in 1968–69 they won the League championship. Leeds progressed in 1969–70 towards a &quot;treble&quot; of League championship, FA Cup and European Cup, but a broken leg suffered in a game against West Ham United meant that he missed the run-in to the end of the season – a factor that contributed to Leeds missing out on all three trophies. In addition, the broken leg meant that Reaney missed that summer&#x27;s World Cup in Mexico.

He eventually returned in the 1970–71 season to make 18 League appearances and be part of the team which won its second Fairs Cup, but which missed out on the League championship again. In the 1971–72 season he was part of the team that won the FA Cup, but which missed out the League Championship yet again. The following season saw more disappointment for Reaney as Leeds lost the FA Cup final to Sunderland and a controversial European Cup Winners Cup final to A.C. Milan.

Reaney&#x27;s career at Leeds passed 500 appearances in 1973–74 as Leeds embarked on a 29-match unbeaten start to the season to earn the League title for the second time under Revie, who then left to take over the England job. Reaney was in the team which duly progressed to the European Cup final the following season in 1974–75 but was controversially defeated 2–0 by Bayern Munich.

===Later career===
Reaney remained at Elland Road until the end of the 1977–78 season when he was given a free transfer after 745 appearances. He joined neighbours Bradford City and then completed his playing career in Australia with Newcastle KB United.

==International career==
In 1968, Reaney won his first England cap, when he came on as a substitute in a match against Bulgaria (and by doing so becoming the first player named &quot;Paul&quot; to play for England in a full international). Reaney&#x27;s appearance for England has assumed greater importance in recent years as even though he was regarded as &quot;white&quot; during his playing career, he is viewed by many as &quot;black&quot; or mixed race today. His England debut was nine years before that of Viv Anderson, who is widely credited as the first black player to appear for England.

From that point on, he was regularly selected for the England squad (albeit not as first choice full-back) until a broken leg in 1970 prevented him from playing in the World Cup. The following year, he made his third and final appearance for England in a match against Malta.

==Post-playing career==
Since returning to England from Australia, Reaney has been running coaching sessions during school holidays for children at Potters Leisure Resort in Hopton.

In 1993, burglars broke into Reaney&#x27;s home and stole a safe containing his collection of medals, though left behind his trophies, caps and other honours.

<text>Raetihi, a small town in the centre of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, is located at the junction of State Highways 4 and 49 in the Manawatū-Whanganui region. It lies in a valley between Tongariro and Whanganui National Parks, 11 kilometres west of Ohakune&#x27;s ski fields.

== Early history and economy ==
Evidence of Māori people living here in the fourteenth century has been found. Ngāti Uenuku dwelled at Raetihi and Waimarino (known now as National Park, located approximately 35 kilometres/22 miles north on Highway 4). There is little evidence of large permanent settlements but hunting parties were common during warmer months.

In 1887 the Government purchased the Waimarino block from local Māori, and the first European settlement, at Karioi, involved setting sheep to graze on open tussock land. Between 1908 and 1947 the area provided 700 million superficial feet of building timber. The remnants of 150 sawmills have been discovered, and the milling of rimu, tōtara, kahikatea, mātai, and beech trees employed many people. Only two major mills continue to operate, one at Tangiwai and one at National Park. 

Raetihi (originally called Makotuku due to the river flowing at the town&#x27;s edge) became the focal point for travellers going between Wanganui and Waiouru. A thriving town emerged to serve the timber workers and those passing through. A trip North from Wanganui was not for the faint-hearted. The scenic &quot;River Road&quot; passing through Pipiriki was treacherous with primitive tracks and long falls if you left the track. Those who completed the journey to Raetihi found hospitality, accommodation, blacksmiths and saddlers for weary horses and supplies for their further travels north.
The great fire of 1918 was a setback to many businesses and homeowners in Raetihi. The loss of numerous mills slowed the timber industry but it continued successfully into the 1940s, when the supply of strong native timber began running out. Replanting forests in fast-growing pine was a consideration, but at the time it was not possible to treat this relatively soft wood effectively to make it suitable for outdoor uses. 

Although farming was an option for some, it could not equal forestry as an employer. From the 1970s through to the 1990s, Raetihi, like many rural New Zealand towns, suffered from a depressed economy. As elsewhere in New Zealand, sheep farming has also declined, and the two most prominent agricultural activities are cattle farming and vegetable growing.

At present, tourist attractions such as the Dinosaur House Museum and Mountains to Sea Cycle Trail (part of Ngā Haerenga, New Zealand&#x27;s national network of cycle trails) and various commercial operations providing opportunities to explore the Whanganui River offer hope for a more diverse economic future. Its close proximity to Mount Ruapehu and popular ski-fields has led to the establishment of accommodation and cafes to cater for the increasing number of visitors.

The setting of John Mulgan&#x27;s classic novel Man Alone, particularly that of Stenning&#x27;s farm, is based on Raetihi.

== Railway and museum ==

From 18 December 1917 to 1 January 1968, Raetihi was served by the Raetihi Branch, a branch line railway that diverged from the North Island Main Trunk in Ohakune. The station building remains in the town today, relocated from its original site and restored as part of the Waimarino Museum. The museum holds an archive of documents and photographs from the broader Ruapehu area, some of which are available online. It was originally situated on Station Road near the Makotuku River bridge on the road to Ohakune. When the railway reached Raetihi in 1917, it played a vital part in the logging industry. Closed to passengers in 1951, the line ceased operations completely in 1968 due to the decline in tree felling and milling.

The railway station building was moved to its present site on Seddon Street in 1981, seven years after the formation of the museum society. Two more buildings, the jail cells and stables, were moved from their original location by the Makotuku River to the museum site in 1983. 

The museum holds documents, photographs, and items of daily life showing the progression of the town from its beginnings as a Māori settlement in the 19th century, the arrival of timber mills and large scale logging between 1900 and 1960, and the slow decline of the town following the end of the logging boom to the present.

The museum is run by volunteers and is open for viewing most weekends and by appointment. A number of archival photographs and documents are available for wider viewing on the museum&#x27;s website.

== Connection with New Zealand film production ==

Raetihi&#x27;s economic difficulties made it the perfect location for &quot;Skin Deep&quot; (1978; Geoff Steven), a black comedy and social satire about a town much like Raetihi. In the film, the local council, made up largely of local businessmen, decide that one way to improve the economy would be to hire a woman to come in from Auckland and provide massages at the local gym.

Larry Parr, writer, director, and producer of films and teleplays, as well as Chief Executive/Kaihautū of Te Māngai Pāho, grew up in Raetihi. In 1986 his New Zealand comedy starring Billy T. James, &quot;Came a Hot Friday&quot; (directed by Ian Mune), premiered there.

For &quot;Without a Paddle&quot; (2004; Steven Brill), an American film featuring Burt Reynolds, local traffic signs were replaced with American-style signs and cars drove on local roads as though in the United States. Raetihi also provided the closest access point for several scenes in Vincent Ward&#x27;s &quot;River Queen&quot; (2005); Horopito, setting for much of &quot;Smash Palace&quot; (1981; Roger Donaldson), another New Zealand film, is also nearby.

<doc id="1252036" wikidata="Q901382" url="?curid=1252036" title="Damask">
<text>Damask (; Arabic: دمشق) is a woven, reversible patterned fabric. Damasks are woven by periodically reversing the action of the warp and weft threads. The pattern is most commonly created with a warp-faced satin weave and the ground with a weft-faced or sateen weave. Yarns used to create damasks include silk, wool, linen, cotton, and synthetic fibers, but damask is best shown in cotton and linen. Over time, damask has become a broader term for woven fabrics with a reversible pattern, not just silks.

There are a few types of damask: true, single, compound, and twill. True damask is made entirely of silk. Single damask has only one set of warps and wefts and thus is made of up to two colors. Compound damask has more than one set of warps and wefts and can include more than two colors. Twill damasks include a twill-woven ground or pattern.

==History==
A damask weave is one of the five basic weaving techniques—the others being tabby, twill, Lampas, and tapestry—of the early Middle Ages Byzantine and Middle Eastern weaving centers. Damask was named after the city Damascus, Syria a large trading center on the Silk Road.

=== Damask in China ===
In China, draw looms with a large number of heddles were developed to weave damasks with complicated patterns. The Chinese may have produced damasks as early as the Tang dynasty (618–907). Damasks became scarce after the 9th century outside Islamic Spain, but were revived in some places in the 13th century. Trade logs between The British East India Company and China often demonstrate an ongoing trade of Chinese silks, especially damask. Damask is documented as being the heaviest Chinese silk.
===Damask in Europe ===
The word &quot;damask&quot; first appeared in a Western European language in mid-14th century French records. Shortly after its appearance in French language, damasks were being woven on draw looms in Italy. From the 14th to 16th century, most damasks were woven in one colour with a glossy warp-faced satin pattern against a duller ground. Two-colour damasks had contrasting colour warps and wefts and polychrome damasks added gold and other metallic threads or additional colours as supplemental brocading wefts. Medieval damasks were usually woven in silk, but weavers also produced wool and linen damasks.

===Damask and Nomads ===
In daily nomadic life this form of weaving was generally employed by women, specifically in occupations such as carpet-making. Women collected raw material from pasture animals and dyes from local flora, such as berries, insects, or grasses, to use in production. Each woman would create a specialized pattern sequence and color scheme that aligned with her personal identity and ethnic group. These techniques were passed down generationally from mother to daughter.  

==Modern usage==
In the 19th century, the invention of the Jacquard loom which was automated with a system of punched cards, made weaving damask faster and cheaper.

Modern damasks are woven on computerized Jacquard looms. Damask weaves are commonly produced in monochromatic (single-colour) weaves in silk, linen or synthetic fibres such as rayon and feature patterns of flowers, fruit and other designs. The long floats of satin-woven warp and weft threads cause soft highlights on the fabric which reflect light differently according to the position of the observer. Damask weaves appear most commonly in table linens and furnishing fabrics, but they are also used for clothing. The damask weave is prevalent in the fashion industry due to its versatility and high-quality finish. Damask is often used for mid-to-high-quality garments—associating itself with higher quality brands/labels.

<text>Dunnet is a surreal, cyberpunk text adventure written by Ron Schnell, based on a game he wrote in 1982. The name is derived from the first three letters of &quot;dungeon&quot; and the last three letters of &quot;ARPANET&quot;. It was first written in Maclisp for the DECSYSTEM-20, then ported to Emacs Lisp in 1992. Since 1994 the game has shipped with GNU Emacs; it also has been included with XEmacs.

The game has been recommended to writers considering writing interactive fiction.

The game starts out with the player standing at the end of a dirt road, but it turns to the surreal when players realize that they are actually walking around inside a Unix system, and teleporting themselves around the Arpanet. There are many subtle jokes in this game, and there are multiple ways of ending the game. Throughout the game the player moves through different areas and rooms trying to collect treasure to earn points.

==Legacy==
Dunnet is playable on any operating system with the Emacs editor. Emacs comes with most Unices, including macOS (prior to version 10.15 Catalina) and distributions of Linux. Several articles targeted to Mac OS X owners have recommended it as an easter egg as a game that can be run in Terminal.app. It can be run by running codice_1 in a shell or the key sequence codice_2 within Emacs, the former being the preferred and official way to run it. Dunnet was used as a benchmark in the effort to port Emacs Lisp to Guile, progressing from running standalone games to running the entire Emacs system in less than a person-year of work.

<text>In simulation, run-time infrastructure (RTI) is a middleware that is required when implementing the High Level Architecture (HLA). RTI
is the fundamental component of HLA. It provides a set of software services that are necessary to support federates to coordinate their operations and data exchange during a runtime execution. In other sense, it is the implementation of the HLA interface specification but is not itself part of specification. Modern RTI implementations conform to the IEEE 1516 and/or HLA 1.3 API specifications. These specifications do not include a network protocol for RTI. It is up to the implementors of an RTI to create a specification. Due to this, interoperability between RTI products and often, RTI versions, should not be assumed unless the vendor specifies interoperability with other products or versions.

<text>The Buffalo Bill Center of the West, formerly known as the Buffalo Bill Historical Center, is a complex of five museums and a research library featuring art and artifacts of the American West located in Cody, Wyoming. The five museums include the [[Buffalo Bill Museum]], the [[Plains Indians Museum]], the Whitney Western Art Museum, the Draper Natural History Museum, and the Cody Firearms Museum. Founded in 1917 to preserve the legacy and vision of Col. William F. &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody, the Buffalo Bill Center of the West is the oldest and most comprehensive museum complex of the West.

==Background==
The complex can be traced to 1917, when the Buffalo Bill Memorial Association was established after the death of William F. Cody, the original Buffalo Bill. Gradually other elements were added to what started as a historical center. The current seven-acre building has more than 50,000 artifacts and holds five museums.

Since 2008, the center has been part of the Smithsonian Affiliates program, the first museum complex in Wyoming to have this status. As an Affiliate, the Center of the West has hosted Smithsonian artifacts. It has also recently loaned some of its own vast collections to a Smithsonian exhibition in Washington, D.C.

The museums are connected by the unifying theme of the history, culture, art, and natural science of the American West. The Center of the West&#x27;s overall mission is to connect people to the American West. The institution includes the Buffalo Bill Museum, redesigned in 2012, which highlights Western ephemera and historic objects in telling the life story of W. F. &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody. Edward Rothstein of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote,

The exhibition [on Buffalo Bill] affirms what the center as a whole demonstrates: that behind the mythologizing is something worth cherishing, even if it is flawed, complex and still evolving. The old impulse to demolish the myth has been put aside.

== Buffalo Bill Museum ==

The inaugural museum opened in 1927 in a log cabin across from the current location. It was moved and reinstalled in 1968, and it is now part of a five-museum complex. The museum offers a wide-ranging view of the life and times of William F. Cody, as well as of the &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; character he created, which made him the world&#x27;s most celebrated person of his time.

The museum showcases the fame and success Cody attained through his &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West show,&quot; and addresses his influence on the economic and cultural development of the American West.

== Plains Indians Museum ==

The museum features the stories and objects of Plains Indian people, their cultures, traditions, values and histories, as well as the contexts of their lives today. The first curator was George Horse-Capture, an enrolled member of the A&#x27;aninin tribe. The majority of the collection is from the early reservation period, ca. 1880–1930. It contains artifacts primarily from Northern Plains tribes, such as the Arapaho, Lakota, Crow, Cheyenne, Blackfeet and Pawnee. The holdings also include important contemporary objects, ranging from abstract art to star quilts.

The museum also sponsors an annual Powwow held on the third weekend in June at the Robbie Powwow Garden at the Center of the West. This event attracts dancers, artisans, and visitors from all over North America.

== Whitney Western Art Museum ==

The museum features paintings and sculptures of the American West. The gallery first opened in 1959 and was later united with the Buffalo Bill Museum.

In June 2009, it re-opened following a re-installation. Replicas of the studios of both Frederic Remington and Alexander Phimister Proctor help visitors learn about the artists and their techniques. Included are works by other classic Western artists: George Catlin, Edgar Samuel Paxson, Alfred Jacob Miller, Thomas Moran, Albert Bierstadt, Alexander Phimister Proctor, Joseph Henry Sharp and N. C. Wyeth. Contemporary Western artists include Harry Jackson, James Bama, Deborah Butterfield, Fritz Scholder, and the sculptor Grant Speed. Interactive stations allow visitors to create their own works of art.

== Draper Natural History Museum ==

The museum features approximately of interactive exhibits highlighting geology, wildlife, and human presence in the Greater Yellowstone region. Videos, natural history dioramas, and photography replicate the sights, sounds, and smells of the area. Specimens of grizzlies, wolves, bighorn sheep, moose, elk and other wildlife are on display.

== Cody Firearms Museum ==

The Cody Firearms Museum was completely redesigned and reinstalled in 2019 and contains the most comprehensive firearms museum in the United States. The collection includes firearms ranging from 16th-century hand cannons to guns of modern manufacture. It explores firearms as &quot;tools of human endeavors&quot; and boasts a collection of 7,000 individual firearms—4,200 of which are on display—with approximately 20,000 additional related artifacts. The core of the museum is the Winchester Repeating Arms Company factory collection, which was transported from New Haven, Connecticut to Cody in 1976. The collection has grown to include firearms from many other manufacturers.

== Programming and Activities ==
The Center of the West offers a variety of programs for visitors, including lectures, family activities, chuckwagon dinners, based on availability.

== McCracken Research Library ==
The library houses a collection of 36,000 books, more than 600 numbered manuscript collections, and more than a million photographic images. Named in honor of Harold McCracken, writer, artist, and developer of the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, the library supports &quot;inquiry across many disciplines related to the American West.&quot; The library has strong collections relating to Buffalo Bill, the Wild West show, Plains Indians, cattle and &quot;dude&quot; ranching, the fishing and hunting industries, the oil industry, Yellowstone National Park, and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.

<doc id="1252047" wikidata="Q497082" url="?curid=1252047" title="Sneakers (1992 film)">
<text>Sneakers is a 1992 American heist comedy film directed by Phil Alden Robinson from a screenplay co-written with Walter Parkes and Lawrence Lasker. It stars Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell, River Phoenix, Sidney Poitier and David Strathairn. In the film, Martin (Redford) and his group of security specialists are hired to steal a black box but soon realize the job has nefarious and far-reaching consequences.

Lasker and Parkes first conceived &quot;Sneakers&quot; in 1981 during pre-production on &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983). Redford was the first actor attached to the project, and he helped recruit the remaining cast members, as well as Robinson. Several of the characters were inspired by members of the hacking and national defense communities, and the actors improvised several scenes during filming. Principal photography took place on location across California, with filming taking place in San Francisco, Oakland, Simi Valley, and the Courthouse Square backlot at Universal Studios Hollywood.

&quot;Sneakers&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on September 11, 1992, by Universal Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its humor, tone and plot. It grossed $105.2 million worldwide, becoming the 20th-highest-grossing film of 1992.

== Plot ==

In 1969, student hackers and long-time friends Martin Brice and Cosmo use their skills to reallocate money from causes they consider evil to noble but underfunded causes designed to help the world. Martin leaves for food just before the police arrive, arresting Cosmo and forcing Martin into hiding.

Decades later, in San Francisco, Martin, using the alias Martin Bishop, heads a penetration testing security specialist team that includes former CIA operative Donald Crease, technician and conspiracy theorist Darren &quot;Mother&quot; Roskow, hacking prodigy Carl Arbogast, and blind phone phreak Irwin &quot;Whistler&quot; Emery. After the team successfully infiltrates a bank to demonstrate their inadequate security, Martin is approached by two NSA agents. The men are aware of Martin&#x27;s true identity and offer to clear his name and pay him $175,000 to recover a Russian-funded black box device codenamed &quot;Setec Astronomy&quot; from mathematician Gunter Janek. With assistance from his ex-girlfriend Liz, Martin and his team secure the box. However, they discover the device is a code breaker capable of infiltrating the most secure computer networks including financial and government systems. Martin realizes &quot;Setec Astronomy&quot; is an anagram of &quot;too many secrets&quot; and locks everyone down in their office until the device can be delivered to the NSA.

The following day, Martin hands the box to the agents, but Crease warns him to run after learning that Janek was murdered the night before. The team learns the box was actually funded by the NSA and the agents are imposters. Martin&#x27;s friend Gregor, a spy in the Russian consulate, identifies one of them as a former NSA agent now working for a powerful crime organization. Men impersonating FBI agents arrive and kill Gregor, framing Martin by using his gun, before recovering Martin to an unknown location where it is revealed they are working for Cosmo. Because of his hacking talents, Cosmo had secured an early release from prison and was recruited by a crime organization to manage their illicit finances. Although the box could infiltrate their illegal networks, Cosmo wants it so he can finish what he and Martin started in 1969, destroying financial and ownership records to render the rich and poor as equals. He asks Martin to join him, but he refuses, considering Cosmo&#x27;s plan extreme. Cosmo uses the box to access the FBI&#x27;s systems and link Martin&#x27;s current and former identities, making him a fugitive again. Martin is knocked unconscious and returned to the city.

To conceal their presence, Martin relocates his team to Liz&#x27;s apartment. They contact NSA director of operations Bernard Abbott who will assist them if they recover the box. Whistler uses the sounds Martin can recall from his abduction to identify Cosmo&#x27;s office in the PlayTronics toy company. Researching the building&#x27;s security, the team identifies Werner Brandes, an employee, and manipulate a dating service to connect him with Liz. During the date she steals his access codes which allows Martin to infiltrate PlayTronics, but Brandes becomes suspicious of Liz and takes her to his office. Cosmo realizes she is involved with Martin and locks down the facility, taking Liz hostage. Martin surrenders and Cosmo pleads with Martin to join him, but he refuses after turning over the box. Unable to kill his friend, Cosmo allows Martin and his team to leave, but discovers Martin gave him an empty box.

On arriving back at their office, Martin&#x27;s team is surrounded by Abbott and his agents. Martin realizes that the box can only be used by the NSA to hack into systems belonging to the USA, such as the FBI and White House. To ensure their silence on the matter, Abbott acquiesces to the team&#x27;s demands, including clearing Martin&#x27;s record, sending Crease on a long holiday with his wife, buying Mother a Winnebago, and giving Carl the telephone number of an attractive NSA agent. After the agents leave, Martin reveals the box is useless because he has removed the core component.

A news report announces the sudden bankruptcy of the Republican National Committee and the simultaneous receipt of large anonymous donations to Amnesty International, Greenpeace and the United Negro College Fund.

==Cast==
== Production ==
Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes first conceived the idea for &quot;Sneakers&quot; in 1981, while doing research for &quot;WarGames&quot;. In early drafts, the character of Liz was a bank employee, rather than Martin&#x27;s ex-girlfriend. The role was changed because Lasker and Parkes believed that it took too long for her character to develop.

Once Robert Redford was attached to the picture, his name was used to recruit other members of the cast and crew, including the director Robinson, who had little initial interest in the project but had always wanted to work with Redford.

At one point during the project, Robinson received a visit from men claiming to be representatives of the Office of Naval Intelligence, who indicated that for reasons of national security, the film could not include any references to &quot;a hand-held device that can decode codes&quot;. Robinson was highly concerned, as such a device was a key to the film&#x27;s plot, but after consulting with a lawyer from the film studio he realized that the &quot;visit&quot; had been a prank instigated by a member of the cast, possibly Aykroyd or Redford.

Leonard Adleman was the mathematical consultant on this movie. The character of &quot;Bernard Abbott&quot; was named after Robert Abbott, the so-called &quot;Father of Information Security,&quot; who was also a consultant for the film. The character &quot;Whistler&quot; was based on Josef &quot;Joybubbles&quot; Engressia and John &quot;Cap&#x27;n Crunch&quot; Draper, well-known figures in the phone phreaks and hacking communities. &quot;Donald Crease&quot; was based on John Strauchs, a former CIA officer who founded the security consulting firm Systech Group. Dan Ackroyd&#x27;s brother Peter supplied conspiracy material on &quot;UFOS, cattle mutilations, the Tri-Lateral Commission, the staged moon landing, JFK, [and] Marilyn Monroe&quot; that was used to &quot;spice up&quot; his character.
=== Filming ===
Filming took place mainly on-location in San Francisco, Oakland and other parts of the Bay Area. The opening scene was shot at the &quot;Courthouse Square&quot; set on the Universal Studios Hollywood backlot, better known as &quot;Hill Valley&quot; in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; films. The &quot;Playtronics&quot; building was a former headquarters for Gibraltar Savings and Loan in Simi Valley, California.

&quot;I can&#x27;t remember having so much fun on a movie,&quot; Stephen Tobolowsky recalled in 2012 for a 20th-anniversary piece about the film for &quot;Slate&quot;. He had initially scoffed at the script based on its title alone, but his agent persuaded him to read it, and he reconsidered. Afterward, he told his agent, &quot;Now I know what a hundred million dollars at the box office reads like.&quot; &quot;It was one of the most spectacular casts I&#x27;ve ever been lucky enough to be a part of,&quot; Tobolowsky wrote. When he was shooting the scene where he and McDonnell eat at a Chinese restaurant, Robinson told him he could do anything he wanted to make her laugh. &quot;Dangerous words. It set the tone for the rest of the shoot,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I played with my food. I made up lines (including one about pounding chicken breasts in the kitchen during our second date).&quot; The rest of the cast and crew felt similarly. Near the end of the shoot, Robinson said the only way it could have been better would have been if the lab lost the film, so they would have had to do it all over again.

== Release ==
The film&#x27;s press kit was accompanied by a floppy disk containing a custom program explaining the movie. Parts of the program were quasi-encrypted, requiring the user to enter an easily guessable password to proceed. It was one of the first electronic press kits by a film studio.

== Reception ==
The film received positive reviews from critics upon its release. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan called &quot;Sneakers&quot; &quot;[a] caper movie with a most pleasant sense of humor,&quot; a &quot;twisting plot,&quot; and a &quot;witty, hang-loose tone.&quot; Turan went on to praise the ensemble cast and director Robinson, who is &quot;surprisingly adept at creating tension at appropriate moments&quot; and &quot;makes good use of the script&#x27;s air of clever cheerfulness&quot;. Roger Ebert, writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, was less impressed, giving the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it &quot;a sometimes entertaining movie, but thin.&quot; He went on to point out numerous clichés and tired plot devices recycled in the film.

Conversely, Vincent Canby, in a negative review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said the film looked like it had &quot;just surfaced after being buried alive for 20 years,&quot; calling it &quot;an atrophied version of a kind of caper movie that was so beloved in the early 1970&#x27;s&quot;. He singled out Redford and Poitier as looking and acting too old to be in this kind of film now. He calls the plot &quot;feeble,&quot; resulting in a film that is &quot;jokey without being funny, breathless without creating suspense&quot;. He calls the ensemble an &quot;all-star gang,&quot; but says the &quot;performances are generally quite bad.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 80% based on reviews from 55 critics. The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;There isn&#x27;t much to &quot;Sneakers&quot;″ plot and that&#x27;s more than made up for with the film&#x27;s breezy panache and hi-tech lingo.&quot;
On Metacritic the film has a score of 65 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.
Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A− on scale of A to F.
The film was a box office success, grossing over $105.2 million worldwide.

== Novelization ==
A novelization of the film written by Dewey Gram was published in English (Signet, 1992, ) and translated into German (Droemer Knaur, 1993, ).

==Potential TV series==
In October 2016, NBC was developing a TV series based on the film. Writer Walter Parkes was brought on as an executive producer.

<text>Carl Scarborough (July 3, 1914 – May 30, 1953) was an American racecar driver. He died from heat exhaustion during the 1953 Indianapolis 500, a race in which several drivers experienced heat-related illness. The race was Scarborough&#x27;s second entry in the Indianapolis 500. He had also been the national champion in both big car and midget car racing. After he died, race officials announced plans to inspect Indy 500 vehicles for suitable ventilation.

==Early life and career==
Scarborough was born in Benton, Illinois on July 3, 1914. Before his entries in the Indianapolis 500, he had participated in &quot;outlaw&quot; racing in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. Early in his racing career, Scarborough sat out for two years after sustaining injuries as the passenger in a car crash. In 1946, Scarborough was the national midget car racing champion. He also won the national big car title that year, becoming the first driver named the Central States Racing Association national champion in both categories.

While attempting to qualify for the 1951 Indianapolis 500, he ran the second fastest qualifying lap that had ever been recorded at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He finished 18th in that race; within four years, eleven of the 35 men in the 1951 race&#x27;s starting lineup had died, mostly in race-related incidents.

==Death and legacy==
Scarborough started the 1953 Indianapolis 500 on the seventh row. He qualified for the race with an average speed of . During Scarborough&#x27;s first pit stop, he felt sick from the heat and fumes at the race. After a fuel spill during the pit stop, a minor fire broke out involving the side of Scarborough&#x27;s car. Scarborough climbed over the pit wall and collapsed onto a chair. Bob Scott replaced Scarborough on the track. Scott&#x27;s own car had experienced mechanical difficulties early in the race. He finished the race for Scarborough in twelfth place.

Scarborough was taken to the speedway&#x27;s hospital, where he died. His temperature was recorded as on admission to the hospital. Physicians there unsuccessfully performed open-heart massage before Scarborough was pronounced dead. The temperature was in Indianapolis that day; nine drivers were treated for heat-related illness. Driver Pat Flaherty suffered minor injuries when he fainted and crashed into a wall later in the race. The track temperature reached .

Scarborough was the second person to die at that year&#x27;s event. Chet Miller died in a crash during a practice run before the official start of the race.

At the time of his death, Scarborough lived in Clarkston, Michigan with his wife and three children. He had been racing in some capacity for 18 years. After Scarborough&#x27;s death, Indy 500 officials instituted a new rule that cars would be inspected to ensure adequate ventilation before the following year&#x27;s race. Scarborough was elected to the Michigan Motor Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.

<text>Chester Joseph Miller (July 19, 1902 – May 15, 1953) was an American racing driver. He was killed in a crash in the south turn of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during practice for the 1953 Indianapolis 500. During his long Indianapolis racing career, Miller earned the nickname &quot;Dean of the Speedway.&quot;

Miller died at age 50 while driving a Novi-engined Special. He is interred at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ==

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Miller participated in two World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. His best finish was 25th place, and he scored no World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

Upon Miller&#x27;s death during practice for the 1953 Indianapolis 500, he became the first racing driver to die as a result of an accident during a World Drivers&#x27; Championship event.

It is also close to the volcanic peaks of Mount Tongariro and Mount Ngauruhoe. The building was completed in 1929 and, despite extensive refurbishment, still retains much of the style of the pre-Depression era. It is listed by Heritage New Zealand as a Category 1 historic place. The Chateau Tongariro Hotel closed permanently on 5 February 2023, largely because the building has significant seismic risks.

==History==
In 1923, the newly established Tongariro National Park Board investigated a site for a 100-bed hostel in order to encourage tourists to visit the newly formed park, but it was not until 1925 that New Zealand Government, via the National Park Board, followed up this initiative by offering to lease land and lend up to £40,000 to any private company that would build and operate a hotel on the site.

Rodolph Wigley (1881–1946), the managing director of the Mount Cook Tourist Company, took up the option. He formed the Tongariro Park Tourist Company with a vision to build what was at the time known as The Chateau, alongside the original Whakapapa ski huts, on a land lease of 63 acres. To raise capital for the undertaking the company was floated on the sharemarket, where it was poorly subscribed. The company signed a lease with the government on 9 November 1928, a condition of which was that the building had to be erected by 31 March 1930 (barely 17 months away) and that it &quot;cost not less than £40,000 or more than £60,000&quot;. Despite only £30,000 of shares being taken up, Wigley let a contract in late 1928 to Fletcher Construction Company, which also involved Fletchers buying 15,000 of shares in the Tongariro Park Tourist Company.

The Chateau was designed by Timaru-based Herbert Hall (1880–1939), architect to the Mount Cook Tourist Company, who modelled his design on the Canadian Resort of Lake Louise. Influenced by the hotels built by the Canadian Pacific Railway, such as the Château Frontenac, he designed a neo-Georgian structure of four stories and basement. The style of the building was not European, despite its name, but American Colonial Revival, a variant of the Georgian Revival style popular between the wars. It is possibly the only building in New Zealand made of reinforced concrete but designed to resemble a traditional Georgian brick building. 

The foundation stone was laid on 10 January 1929. Fletchers used a workforce of 120 carpenters and labourers, offering an incentive of free accommodation and a free suit to workers who stayed until the completion of the project. Most of the labourers were recruited from the Waikune Prison, which was the closest neighbour to the construction site. The building was open for guests by 1 August 1929, even though it was still unfurnished. It was officially opened on 13 November 1929 with Fletcher Construction still owed £28,000.
The hotel was lavishly appointed, with panoramic window views, hot and cold running water in every room, and custom-made high-quality furniture. Most of the staff were recruited from overseas. The innovative heating system used enormous boiling-water tanks in the basement and pumped hot water up five storeys; originally coal or oil heated, it was switched to electricity and still operates today. The total cost was £88,000 (well over the contract price) of which the hotel had cost £78,000, while at the request of the Tourist Company another £10,000 had been spent building extra wooden buildings, a garage and a golf course in the front of the hotel. The golf course was designed by an architect serving a prison sentence and built by prison labour. Wigley had led Fletchers to believe that if they overspent the company would be reimbursed by the Mount Cook Tourist Company. Unfortunately due to the Depression it was in difficulties and so would not pay for the increased expenditure. James Fletcher, the head of the company, approached the Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward and asked him to increase the government loan to £60,000. Ward agreed and Fletcher obtained a promise from Wigley that the bulk of this injection of money would go to pay Fletchers. The Tongariro Park Tourist Company was by now in serious financial trouble, which was not helped by spending lavishly fitting out the hotel. Wigley reneged on the deal and passed on only £10,000. The onset of the depression delayed hopes of a tourism boom; to secure their debt Fletchers put the Tongariro Park Tourist Company into receivership in February 1931, took control of the hotel, and ran it for 3 months before walking away with a loss of £19,000, (which included £1000 of losses incurred during their period of ownership).

===Government ownership===

In 1932 the hotel was taken over by the National Park Board, who quickly transferred the title to the Department of Tourist and Health Resorts, which owned and ran the hotel for the next 26 years. Over this period, the hotel manager not only ran the Chateau, but also Tongariro National Park. The sole park ranger, Alf Cowling, was told &quot;his services were to be at the disposal of the Manager of The Chateau, and that his horse was to be available when not otherwise required for hiring out to guests.&quot;

The numbers of skiing tourists declined during World War II, so in 1942 the Chateau was commandeered by the Health Department as an asylum when the Wairarapa earthquakes damaged Porirua Psychiatric Institution in Wellington. In late 1945 Ruapehu erupted over a ten month period, and the heavy showers of ash disrupted the Chateau&#x27;s power and water supply; the patients were evacuated to Ramarama. The Chateau then served as a rest and recuperation centre for Air Force personnel returning from service in World War II.

After the War was a boom time for Whakapapa skifield, with the installation of ski-tows, chair lifts, and new facilities. In August 1948, newly renovated, Chateau Tongariro reopened to provide accommodation for increasing numbers of visitors. In 1957, control of the hotel passed to the newly created Tourist Hotel Corporation (THC) of New Zealand, which also developed the Whakapapa skifield. The hotel rooms were gradually upgraded and reduced in number from 90 to 64, but the profitability of the Chateau declined.

===Power supply===
Power to the complex was initially provided by a coal-fired furnace that heated water, which was then circulated around the complex to provide heating, and a 100 kW hydro power station in the Whakapapanui Stream, which provided power for lighting and cooking.

By the early 1950s the power supplies at the complex were becoming inadequate. In June 1952 the Ministry of Works requested the King Country Electric Power Board to provide a 500 to 600 kW power supply to the Chateau. This resulted in an 8.5-mile long overhead 11 kV transmission line being constructed and commissioned in 1955. This not only supplied power to the chateau but also to the Whakapapa ski field and to several mountain huts on Mount Ruapehu. In the early 1960s a second line was constructed and commissioned in 1964 by the King Country Electric Power Board to improve the reliability of supply to the Chateau and other customers in the area.

===Private ownership===

In 1990, during a period of Government privatisation of assets, the Chateau was sold to Kah New Zealand Limited, a subsidiary of Oriental Holdings Berhad (OHB), a Malaysian-based conglomerate owned by the Loh family, with hotel and restaurant holdings in Singapore and Malaysia. The land belongs to the Crown, and was leased to Kah New Zealand. The new owners invested NZ$3 million in refurbishing the complex and renamed it The Grand Chateau (although it is still widely referred to as Chateau Tongariro). The ski area was sold to a separate company. In 2005 a new five-storey wing costing NZ$6 million and containing 40 rooms and replicating the style of the original building was opened. To avoid disturbing guests, the expansion used a Scandinavian system of modular construction, with the rooms built in Auckland and trucked to the site where they were installed using a crane. The Chateau was operated by Bayview International Hotels and Resorts, which is also a subsidiary of Oriental Holdings Berhad (OHB).

After the 2008 global financial crisis, skiing holidays dropped off, and Kah New Zealand posted losses for four straight years, totalling $1.9 million, before making a profit again in 2016. In 2020, in response to the loss of overseas tourists due to the coronavirus epidemic, the Chateau offered discounted ($70 a night) rooms and had over 3500 bookings over May and June, normally quiet months. Tourism New Zealand raised the possibility of resorts like Chateau Tongariro being purchased by the Government, as was done in 1932, but this was rejected.

===Closure===
When a long-term lease expired in April 2020, Kah New Zealand switched to monthly leases, rather than take a new long-term lease. On 27 January 2023, it became known that the hotel&#x27;s future was uncertain over required earthquake strengthening. Four days later, it was announced that Kah was to close the hotel permanently on 5 February due to seismic risks. The company handed over the keys to the Department of Conservation, However, despite Kah New Zealand not renewing the ground lease, as of September 2024 the buildings remain their property.

=== Seismic risk ===
A detailed seismic assessment indicated that the building represented a risk to occupants that was 25 times that of a building complying with standards for new builds. Deficiencies were identified with parapets and chimneys at risk of falling, inadequate bracing, unreinforced masonry infill, and under-strength foundations.

==Awards==
In 2023, the Western branch of the Te Kāhui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects recognised the Chateau Tongariro with its Enduring Architecture award. The award citation said:

<text>Charles Joseph &quot;Chuck&quot; Stevenson (October 15, 1919 – August 21, 1995) was an American racing driver who competed in various disciplines of motorsport. He is best known for winning the AAA National Championship in 1952. Stevenson also had two class victories in the Carrera Panamericana and won a NASCAR Grand National event.

== Early life ==

Charles Joseph Stevenson was born in Sidney, Montana on October 15, 1919, to Joseph Charles, a rancher, and Blanche (née Williams). The family later relocated to Fresno, California.

== Championship Car career ==

Stevenson drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1949–1954, 1960–1961, and 1963–1965 seasons with 54 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 races in 1951–1954, 1960–1961, and 1963–1965. He finished in the top ten 37 times, with four victories, two of them coming during the 1952 season when he won the AAA National Championship.

== Non-Championship Car career ==

=== Carrera Panamericana ===

In 1951 Stevenson drove a Nash-Healey course (pace) car that was supplied by the Mexican Nash automobile importer in the grueling Carrera Panamericana race. This endurance event is described as one of the most dangerous automobile races of any type in the world, and Stevenson had to be ahead of the racers to ensure the way was clear. In both 1952 and 1953 Stevenson won the sedan class driving a &quot;well-prepared&quot; Lincoln Capri. He is the only two-time winner in the history of the Carrera Panamericana.

=== Stock car career ===

Stevenson participated in no less than 40 AAA and USAC Stock Car events, finishing in the top-five no less than 14 times.

He also competed in two NASCAR events, picking up a win at Willow Springs Raceway in 1956 driving a Ford.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship points and participation in addition to those which they received towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Stevenson participated in five World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. His best finish was a 12th place, and he accumulated zero World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Later life ==

Stevenson died in Benson, Arizona on August 21, 1995.

== Awards and honors ==

Stevenson has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame (1963)

<text>Don Edmunds (September 23, 1930 – August 11, 2020) was an American racecar driver and car builder.

==Racing career==
He changed the nose on his first Kurtis midget car from Kurtis&#x27; design to his own. Indy car builder Eddie Kuzma hired Edmunds to fix the dent in Jimmy Bryan’s car after the driver kicked the car.

He had his first start at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1957. He won the 1957 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year after finishing nineteenth over Bill Cheesbourg, Elmer George, Mike Magill, and Eddie Sachs. Edmunds&#x27; Indy career ended with a serious practice accident at the Speedway in 1958.

He founded Autoresearch, Inc. in Anaheim, California, which specialized in building midget cars and sprint cars. Edmunds created the blueprints and did most of the fabrication work on the original Bill Thomas Cheetah prototype sports car racer. His chassis won several National Midget Championships in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the 1970s, Edmunds was a prolific constructor of Formula Super Vee cars. He became a collector and restorer of old race cars.

Edmunds built Evel Knievel&#x27;s Snake River Canyon Sky cycle.

<text>Dennis Clayton &quot;Duke&quot; Nalon (March 2, 1913 – February 26, 2001) was an American racing driver. He competed in midget car, sprint car, and Indy car races. Nicknamed &quot;The Iron Duke,&quot; Nalon was part of the &quot;Chicago Gang&quot; along with Tony Bettenhausen and others. These racers toured tracks in the Midwest and East Coast of the United States.

== Racing career ==

Nalon began as a pit crew member for Wally Zale. Nalon occasionally warmed up the car. When Walter Galven needed a driver, Zale convinced Galven to allow Nalon to race. Nalon won the feature event.

=== Midget cars ===

Nalon won races on the United States&#x27; East Coast in the 1930s. Nalon competed in midget cars throughout his career. He ran his final career race at the only midget race ever run at Terre Haute. He raced Johnny Pawl’s famous midget to victory. He ended his career the way he started it: with a win.

=== Sprint cars ===

Nalon won the 1938 East Coast AAA Sprint car championship; he won the Midwestern championship in 1941.

=== Indy cars ===

Nalon started ten Indianapolis races, finishing only three. He started from the pole twice, and was twice the fastest qualifier. In 1947, he competed in a Mercedes-Benz W154. He also competed in numerous other events on what was them termed the Championship car circuit. In 1949, Nalon was involved in a massive, fiery crash in Turn 3 of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He backed into the wall and the car burst into flames. He survived only because he held his breath (to prevent asphyxiation), and he jumped out of the car while it was still moving. He had severe burns to his legs which gave him trouble until his death in 2001.

==== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ====

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Nalon participated in three World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. His best finish was tenth place, and he qualified on the pole once. He scored no World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Awards and honors ==

* He was inducted in the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 1987.
* He was named to the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1991.
* In 2015, he was inducted in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America.

<doc id="1252070" wikidata="Q172598" url="?curid=1252070" title="Ed Elisian">
<text>Edward Gulbeng Eliseian (December9, 1926August30, 1959), commonly known as Ed Elisian, was an American racecar driver, mainly competing in the National Championship. He died in a crash at the Milwaukee Mile.

In the 1955 Indianapolis 500, he stopped his car in a futile attempt to help Bill Vukovich when Vukovich&#x27;s car crashed and burned during the race. He is one of only two drivers in Indy 500 history to stop a non-damaged car to help another driver, the other being Gary Bettenhausen in 1971. He received a sportsmanship award for his efforts, as well as the wrath of the car owner.

In June 1956, Elisian was engaging in a wheel-to-wheel duel with Bob Sweikert, who had won the race in which Vukovich was killed, in a Sprint car race at Salem Speedway when Sweikert made contact with the rail, overleapt it and rolled over outside of the track, suffering fatal skull injuries. Elisian was exonerated as no collision had taken place.

In the 1958 Indianapolis 500, Dick Rathmann and Elisian started the race on the front row, with Jimmy Reece on the outside of the front row. Elisian spun in Turn 3 of the first lap, and collected Rathmann, sending them both into the wall, and starting a 15-car pileup. Pat O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s car hit Reece&#x27;s car, sailed fifty feet in the air, landed upside down, and burst into flames. Although medical officials said that O&#x27;Connor was probably killed instantly from a fractured skull, he was incinerated in the accident, in full view of fans and drivers. Widely blamed for the accident, Elisian was suspended by USAC (reinstated a few days later), and was shunned by the racing community. Rumors spread that Elisian tried to lead the first lap in order to pay gambling debts owed to a syndicate.

In June 1958, Elisian collided with Jim Davis in a Sprint car race at New Bremen Speedway in Auglaize County, Ohio. After Davis had run over one of the wheels of Elisian&#x27;s spinning car when trying to pass him at the south turn, both cars flipped over and slid down the track. Elisian sustained minor injuries, but Davis, who suffered a skull fracture and chest injuries, died at Memorial Hospital in St. Marys, Ohio. While absolved of blame in the incident, Elisian&#x27;s unpopularity with drivers deepened.

In September 1958, Elisian was suspended for being charged with passing fraudulent checks among other things, but reinstated as of end of May 1959.

In August 1959, Elisian entered the USAC Indy car race at the &quot;Milwaukee Mile,&quot; - in West Allis, Wisconsin - known in those days as Wisconsin State Fair Park. Driving a metallic green Watson-style roadster owned by Ernie Ruiz, he crashed on lap 29 when he spun in oil from A. J. Foyt&#x27;s engine. The car hit the wall, rupturing the fuel cell, and rolled over. Some sixty gallons of fuel caught fire, and took over nine minutes to extinguish. The crash claimed the life of Elisian.

<doc id="1252072" wikidata="Q172472" url="?curid=1252072" title="Eddie Sachs">
<text>Edward Julius Sachs Jr, (May 28, 1927 – May 30, 1964) was a United States Auto Club driver who was known as the &quot;Clown Prince of Auto Racing&quot;. He coined the phrase &quot;If you can&#x27;t win, be spectacular&quot;.

==Early life==
Sachs was born May 28, 1927, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He served in the United States Navy during World War II.

==Professional racing career==
His career included eight USAC Championship Trail wins, 25 top-five finishes in 65 career AAA and USAC starts, including the 1958 USAC Midwest Sprint Car Championship. He was an eight time starter of the Indianapolis 500, 1957–64, winning the pole position in 1960 and 1961, with his best finish being second in 1961. Leading the race with only three laps to go, he saw his right rear tire begin to delaminate and pitted to replace it, handing victory to A. J. Foyt. Sachs never regretted his decision not to gamble on the tire, saying, &quot;I&#x27;d sooner finish second than be dead&quot;.

===Death at Indianapolis===

At the 1964 Indianapolis 500 on May 30, 1964, Sachs and sports car driver Dave MacDonald, an Indianapolis 500 rookie, were killed in a fiery crash involving seven cars on the second lap. MacDonald was driving a car owned and designed by Mickey Thompson, the #83 &quot;Sears-Allstate Special&quot;. Thompson had requested USAC officials to visit his shop in California to inspect the car while it was under construction so that he would not invest money in the car if there was a chance that it would be disqualified at the Speedway. 

USAC accepted the request and passed the car with its ground effects package. By the time the car reached the Speedway in May, USAC had changed their mind and failed it. Working in the cramped spaces of the garage area, Thompson and crew practically rebuilt the car to meet the new USAC specs. These changes, removal of the fenders, changing to larger tires and increasing the height from two inches to four, made the cars very unstable. Graham Hill tested the vehicle before Indy but refused to drive it in 1963. Masten Gregory crashed earlier in the month due to aerodynamic lift. After MacDonald had qualified and before the race, World Grand Prix Formula One Champion Jim Clark, who knew MacDonald and respected his ability, followed the Californian for several laps. After they pulled in, Clark emphatically urged MacDonald to get out of the car. &quot;Get out,&quot; Clark said, &quot;just get out and walk away.&quot; But MacDonald felt obligated to honor his contract with Thompson. Other drivers took Gregory&#x27;s advice and stayed away from the Thompson cars. Before the race, Gregory approached Formula One driver Jack Brabham, who was alongside MacDonald on the grid, and urged Brabham to allow the rookie a lot of room. Brabham credited Gregory&#x27;s advice with saving his life.

On the second lap, MacDonald lost control coming off the fourth turn. As the car began to slide, he came across the track and hit the inside wall, igniting the 45-gallon fuel load which erupted into a massive fire. His car then slid back across the track. Sachs, following Bob Veith, aimed for an opening along the outside wall that was soon closed by MacDonald&#x27;s burning car. Veith made it through by inches, but Sachs hit MacDonald&#x27;s car broadside causing a second explosion. Johnny Rutherford, following Sachs, having no place to go except into the inferno, decided his only chance was to power his way through. Going at full throttle, his Watson Roadster went under Sachs and over MacDonald taking the injectors off MacDonald&#x27;s engine. After clearing the wreckage, he was then broadsided by the NOVI of Bobby Unser. He then motored (on fire) down the main straight, through turns one and two, up the back straight and through turn three, stopping at a fire-truck station in turn four. Ronnie Duman, following Rutherford, went to the left to avoid the crash. It looked as if he was going to make it through when he was rear-ended by the out of control NOVI, which had lost its steering, splitting his fuel tank which also erupted. Duman then spun into the infield wall, where he received serious burns. 

He was transported to the Methodist Hospital&#x27;s burn unit in Indianapolis by helicopter to begin a lengthy recovery. Rutherford and Unser received minor burns and were released from the track hospital. MacDonald, whose lungs were scorched from inhaling the flames and who was burned over 75% of his body, was awake and alert when he was removed from his car. He was taken to the track hospital then transferred to the Methodist Hospital burn unit by ambulance, where he died two hours later. Chuck Stevenson and Norm Hall were also involved but escaped injury. 

Despite being trapped in his car, Sachs&#x27;s driver&#x27;s suit was only scorched, but he received critical burns on his face and hands. The car was covered with a tarp before being taken to the garage area for removal of his body. It has never been determined if he died of asphyxiation, burns or blunt force injury. One driver stated that he saw him struggling to get out of the car after the impact. A lemon that had been on a string around Sachs&#x27;s neck was found inside Rutherford&#x27;s engine compartment after the crash.

The crash was well documented on film and shown worldwide. For the first time in its history, the Indianapolis 500 was stopped because of an accident. Partially in response to media pressure, for subsequent races USAC required that cars carry less fuel and make a mandatory minimum of two pit stops. The new pit-stop rule negated any mileage advantage gasoline-powered cars would have had, so gasoline has not been used since. Every Indianapolis 500 race since 1965 has been run using methanol or ethanol-based fuels.

==World Championship career summary==
The Indianapolis 500 was part of the FIA World Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indy during those years were credited with World Championship points and participation. Accordingly, Sachs participated in four World Championship races. He started on the pole once, but scored no World Championship points.

==Awards==
Sachs was inducted into the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Personal life==
Sachs married Nance McGarrity of Coopersburg, Pennsylvania, on June 3, 1959, at the home of Harry Hamilton, a relative of his car owner, Peter Schmidt in Indianapolis, Indiana. Their son, Edward Julius Sachs, III was born on February 6, 1962. Nance Sachs died on September 28, 2005, at her home in Clinton Township, Michigan. She is survived by her son Edward III, and grandchildren, Edward IV and Meagan Sachs. Forty-one years after his death, she was buried next to her beloved Eddie in Holy Saviour Cemetery in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Using the name &quot;Eddie Sachs, Jr,&quot; Eddie III became a race car driver racing on the local dirt tracks in the Midwest. Unlike his famous father, he never raced in the Indianapolis 500. He has become a businessman as the owner of Sachs and Associates in Lake Orion, Michigan. He has been a part-time car owner in various levels of motorsport, currently in the USAC Silver Crown Series.

<doc id="1252074" wikidata="Q172552" url="?curid=1252074" title="Elmer George">
<text>Elmer Ray George (July 15, 1928 – May 31, 1976) was an American race car driver.

Born in Hockerville, Oklahoma, George died in Terre Haute, Indiana. He drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1956–1963 seasons with 64 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 races in 1957, 1962, and 1963.

He finished in the top ten 36 times, with one victory, in 1957 at Syracuse.

George was also the 1957 USAC Sprint Car Series champion.

==1962 Bobby Ball Memorial race==
On November 18, 1962, George suffered cuts and a left shoulder injury in a USAC Champ Car race held at the Arizona State Fairgrounds. Having hit another car&#x27;s bumper, George lost control of his HOW Special, hit the guard rail before the grandstand, slid and headed towards the stands where he broke through a chain-link fence, landing upside down. 22 spectators were injured as a result.

==Personal==
Elmer George was married to Mari Hulman George, daughter of Tony Hulman, owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Elmer and Mari had three daughters and one son, Tony George, founder of the Indy Racing League, and Ex-CEO of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Elmer had two children from a previous marriage, Joseph F. George and Carolyn Coffey.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, George was the director of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network.

On May 3, 1976, Mari filed for divorce. On the day of the 1976 Indianapolis 500 (May 30, 1976), Elmer George argued by telephone with Guy Trolinger, a horse trainer at the family farm near Terre Haute, and Mari&#x27;s alleged boyfriend. After the race, George drove to the farm, broke into the house and confronted Trolinger, then around 1:00 a.m., gunfire broke out, and George was shot and killed as a result of multiple gunshot wounds. A grand jury ruled that Trolinger killed George in self-defense, as George was armed and also discharged his firearm during the confrontation, at which point the charges were dropped.

==Award==
He was inducted in the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 2005.

<doc id="1252080" wikidata="Q4820471" url="?curid=1252080" title="Augsburg Fortress Publishers">
<text>Augsburg Fortress Publishers is the official publishing house of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Through various imprints, Augsburg Fortress Publishers publishes worship, music, curricular, and devotional resources and distinctive books for congregations, higher-education learning and scholars, children, and adult general readers. Tim Blevins has been the CEO since August, 2018. Beth Lewis was the CEO from September 3, 2002–July 2018.[1]

==History==
Augsburg Fortress was formed in 1988 when Fortress Press of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Augsburg Publishing House of Minneapolis merged, after their parent denominations, the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) and the American Lutheran Church (ALC) merged to form the ELCA.

Augsburg Publishing House was affiliated with the ALC. It had been founded in 1891 at Augsburg Seminary in Minneapolis Both the publishing house and seminary were part of the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America (UNLC). The publishing house left the seminary campus in 1894, relocating to the downtown area in 1908. By 1960 it had become the publishing house of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. With the 1960 merger of Lutheran denominations that formed the &quot;new&quot; American Lutheran Church, Augsburg was designated that church&#x27;s publishing arm. It absorbed the publishing houses of the other denominations participating in the merger, including Wartburg Press (established 1881) of the &quot;old&quot; American Lutheran Church in Columbus, Ohio, and the Danish Lutheran Publishing House (established 1893) of the United Evangelical Lutheran Church in Blair, Nebraska. When the Lutheran Free Church joined the ALC in 1963, its publishing house, Messenger Press (established 1922), was also added. 

Augsburg, and Wartburg before it, had published the old ALC denominational magazine &quot;The Lutheran Standard&quot;, which had ancestry back to the 1840s in the Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio.

Fortress Press was the publishing arm of the LCA, headquartered in northwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the Muhlenberg Building, a unique U-shaped brick building of Georgian architecture style. The building was named for Henry Melchoir Muhlenberg and other members of the Muhlenberg family who were important in American Lutheranism. Henry is considered the &quot;Patriarch of American Lutheranism&quot; and the prime organizer of the first Lutheran synod in America, the Pennsylvania Ministerium, in 1746.

The LCA came into existence in 1962 with the merger of several smaller Lutheran denominations. The largest forerunner of the Fortress Press was the Muhlenberg Press of the United Lutheran Church in America, the largest partner in the LCA merger. The oldest ancestor was the Henkel Press, started by the son of Paul Henkel, a famous late 18th and early 19th century Lutheran pastor, missionary, and evangelist in the Appalachian Mountains region.

Fortress published &quot;The Lutheran&quot;, the monthly magazine of the LCA and also of the earlier United Lutheran Church in America. The magazine had its beginnings in 1831 in publications of the General Synod.

Augsburg Fortress re-branded as 1517 Media from July 2016 to September 2024. In October 2024, the company reverted to its &quot;doing business as&quot; name, Augsburg Fortress Publishers—returning to a name that held resonance within the ELCA and connects them back to their roots. Augsburg Fortress continues to use its name as an imprint for church resources and Fortress Press as an imprint for academic and reference titles. Other imprints include Beaming Books, Broadleaf Books, and Sparkhouse. It also provides subscription fulfillment for &quot;Living Lutheran&quot;, the ELCA&#x27;s official magazine.

<doc id="1252085" wikidata="Q909558" url="?curid=1252085" title="Fuel cell vehicle">
<text>A fuel cell vehicle (FCV) or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) is an electric vehicle that uses a fuel cell, sometimes in combination with a small battery or supercapacitor, to power its onboard electric motor. Fuel cells in vehicles generate electricity generally using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen. Most fuel cell vehicles are classified as zero-emissions vehicles. As compared with internal combustion vehicles, hydrogen vehicles centralize pollutants at the site of the hydrogen production, where hydrogen is typically derived from reformed natural gas. Transporting and storing hydrogen may also create pollutants. Fuel cells have been used in various kinds of vehicles including forklifts, especially in indoor applications where their clean emissions are important to air quality, and in space applications. Fuel cells are being developed and tested in trucks, buses, boats, ships, motorcycles and bicycles, among other kinds of vehicles.

The first road vehicle powered by a fuel cell was the Chevrolet Electrovan, introduced by General Motors in 1966. The Toyota FCHV and Honda FCX, which began leasing on December 2, 2002, became the world&#x27;s first government-certified commercial fuel cell vehicles, and the Honda FCX Clarity, which began leasing in 2008, was the world&#x27;s first fuel cell vehicle designed for mass production rather than adapting an existing model. In 2013, Hyundai Motors began production of the Hyundai ix35 FCEV, claimed to be the world&#x27;s first mass-produced fuel cell electric vehicle, which was subsequently introduced to the market as a lease-only vehicle. In 2014, Toyota began selling the Toyota Mirai, the world&#x27;s first dedicated fuel cell vehicle.

, 31,225 passenger FCEVs powered with hydrogen had been sold worldwide. , there were only two models of fuel cell cars publicly available in select markets: the Toyota Mirai (2014–present) and the Hyundai Nexo (2018–present). The Honda Clarity was produced from 2016 to 2021, when it was discontinued. The Honda CR-V e:FCEV became available, for lease only, in very limited quantities in 2024. As of 2020, there was limited hydrogen infrastructure, with fewer than fifty hydrogen fueling stations for automobiles publicly available in the U.S. Critics doubt whether hydrogen will be efficient or cost-effective for automobiles, as compared with other zero-emission technologies, and in 2019, &quot;The Motley Fool&quot; opined: &quot;What&#x27;s tough to dispute is that the hydrogen fuel cell dream is all but dead for the passenger vehicle market.&quot;

A significant number of the public hydrogen fuel stations in California are not able to dispense hydrogen. In 2024, Mirai owners filed a class action lawsuit in California over the lack of availability of hydrogen available for fuel cell electric cars, alleging, among other things, fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation as well as violations of California’s false advertising law and breaches of implied warranty.

==Description and purpose of fuel cells in vehicles==

All fuel cells are made up of three parts: an electrolyte, an anode and a cathode. In principle, a hydrogen fuel cell functions like a battery, producing electricity, which can run an electric motor. Instead of requiring recharging, however, the fuel cell can be refilled with hydrogen. Different types of fuel cells include polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) Fuel Cells, direct methanol fuel cells, phosphoric acid fuel cells, molten carbonate fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells, reformed methanol fuel cell and Regenerative Fuel Cells.

==History==

The concept of the fuel cell was first demonstrated by Humphry Davy in 1801, but the invention of the first working fuel cell is credited to William Grove, a chemist, lawyer, and physicist. Grove&#x27;s experiments with what he called a &quot;gas voltaic battery&quot; proved in 1842 that an electric current could be produced by an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen over a platinum catalyst. English engineer Francis Thomas Bacon expanded on Grove&#x27;s work, creating and demonstrating various alkaline fuel cells from 1939 to 1959.

The first modern fuel cell vehicle was a modified Allis-Chalmers farm tractor, fitted with a 15 kilowatt fuel cell, around 1959. The Cold War Space Race drove further development of fuel cell technology. Project Gemini tested fuel cells to provide electrical power during crewed space missions. Fuel cell development continued with the Apollo Program. The electrical power systems in the Apollo capsules and lunar modules used alkali fuel cells. In 1966, General Motors developed the first fuel cell road vehicle, the Chevrolet Electrovan. It had a PEM fuel cell, a range of 120 miles and a top speed of 70 mph. There were only two seats, as the fuel cell stack and large tanks of hydrogen and oxygen took up the rear portion of the van. Only one was built, as the project was deemed cost-prohibitive.

General Electric and others continued working on PEM fuel cells in the 1970s. Fuel cell stacks were still limited principally to space applications in the 1980s, including the Space Shuttle. However, the closure of the Apollo Program sent many industry experts to private companies. By the 1990s, automobile manufacturers were interested in fuel cell applications, and demonstration vehicles were readied. In 2001, the first 700 Bar (10000 PSI) hydrogen tanks were demonstrated, reducing the size of the fuel tanks that could be used in vehicles and extending the range.

==Applications==
There are fuel cell vehicles for all modes of transport. The most prevalent fuel cell vehicles are cars, buses, forklifts and material handling vehicles.

=== Automobiles ===
Honda established the world&#x27;s first fuel cell vehicle dealer network in 2008, and at the time was the only company able to lease hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to private customers. The Honda FCX Clarity was introduced in 2008 for leasing by customers in Japan and Southern California and discontinued by 2015. From 2008 to 2014, Honda leased a total of 45 FCX units in the US. Over 20 other FCEV prototypes and demonstration cars were released in that time period, including the GM HydroGen4, and Mercedes-Benz F-Cell.

The Hyundai ix35 FCEV Fuel Cell vehicle was available for lease from 2014 to 2018, when 54 units were leased. In 2018, Hyundai introduced the Nexo. In 2024, Hyundai recalled all 1600 Nexo vehicles sold in the US to that time due to a risk of fuel leaks and fire from a faulty &quot;pressure relief device&quot;.

Sales of the Toyota Mirai to customers began in Japan in December 2014. Pricing started at (~) before taxes and a government incentive of (~). Former European Parliament President Pat Cox estimated that Toyota initially would lose about $100,000 on each Mirai sold. , global sales totaled 5,300 Mirais. The top selling markets were the U.S. with 2,900 units, Japan with 2,100 and Europe with 200.

In 2015, Toyota announced that it would offer all 5,680 patents related to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell charging station technology, which it has been researching for over 20 years, to its competitors free of charge in order to stimulate the market for hydrogen-powered vehicles.

The Honda Clarity Fuel Cell was produced from 2016 to 2021. The 2017 Clarity had the highest combined and city fuel economy ratings among all hydrogen fuel cell cars rated by the EPA that year, with a combined city/highway rating of 67 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe), and 68 MPGe in city driving. In 2019, Katsushi Inoue, the president of Honda Europe, stated, &quot;Our focus is on hybrid and electric vehicles now. Maybe hydrogen fuel cell cars will come, but that&#x27;s a technology for the next era.&quot;

By 2017, Daimler phased out its FCEV development, citing declining battery costs and increasing range of EVs, and most of the automobile companies developing hydrogen cars had switched their focus to battery electric vehicles. By 2020, only three car makers were still manufacturing, or had active manufacturing programs for hydrogen cars. In 2023, 3,143 hydrogen cars were sold in the US compared with 380,000 BEVs. The Clarity was later discontinued, but the Honda CR-V e:FCEV became available, for lease only, in very limited quantities in 2024.

A significant number of the public hydrogen fuel stations in California are not able to dispense hydrogen. In 2024, Mirai owners filed a class action lawsuit in California over the lack of availability of hydrogen available for fuel cell electric cars, alleging, among other things, fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation as well as violations of California’s false advertising law and breaches of implied warranty.

==== Fuel economy ====
The following table compares EPA&#x27;s fuel economy expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe) for the two models of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles rated by the EPA , and available in California.

=== Fuel cells powered by an ethanol reformer ===
In June 2016, Nissan announced plans to develop fuel cell vehicles powered by ethanol rather than hydrogen. Nissan claims this technical approach would be cheaper, and that it would be easier to deploy the fueling infrastructure than a hydrogen infrastructure. The vehicle would include a tank holding a blend of water and ethanol, which is fed into an onboard reformer that splits it into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen is then fed into a solid oxide fuel cell. According to Nissan, the liquid fuel could be an ethanol-water blend at a 55:45 ratio.

=== Buses ===
, 5,648 hydrogen fuel cell buses were in use around the world, with 93.7% of them in China.

From the late 1980s, concern regarding diesel emissions from buses led to experimentation with fuel cells to power them. After initial experiments with phosphoric acid fuel cells, hydrogen-powered fuel-cell buses were tested in cities in the late 1990s. In the 2000s, buses entered trial service in cities around the world; the European Union supported the research project Clean Urban Transport for Europe.

By the 2010s, commercial introduction of hydrogen fuel cell buses was underway around the world. However, many transit operators were purchasing battery electric buses instead, as these were cheaper to operate and purchase. However, battery electric buses lacked range compared to diesel buses, take time to charge (often overnight, compared with hydrogen fuel cell buses, which can be refilled quickly) and have reduced energy storage in cold weather. Some companies have proposed using the fuel cell as a range extender, combining it with a larger battery or a supercapacitor.

Hydrogen fuel cell buses have historically been significantly more expensive to purchase and operate than diesel, hybrid or electric buses. In recent years, costs have been reduced to levels comparable with diesel buses.

A variety of bus manufacturers are currently producing hydrogen fuel cell buses. Bus manufacturers usually work with a provider of hydrogen fuel cells to power the bus, such as Ballard Power Systems or Toyota.

=== Forklifts ===

A fuel cell forklift (also called a fuel cell lift truck or a fuel cell forklift) is a fuel cell-powered industrial forklift truck used to lift and transport materials. Most fuel cells used in forklifts are powered by PEM fuel cells.

In 2013, there were over 4,000 fuel cell forklifts used in material handling in the US of which 500 received funding from DOE (2012). As of 2024, approximately 50,000 hydrogen forklifts are in operation worldwide (the bulk of which are in the U.S.), as compared with 1.2 million battery electric forklifts that were purchased in 2021.

PEM fuel-cell-powered forklifts provide significant benefits over petroleum powered forklifts as they produce no local emissions. Fuel-cell forklifts can work for a full 8-hour shift on a single tank of hydrogen, can be refueled in 3 minutes and have a lifetime of 8–10 years. Fuel cell-powered forklifts are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. In design the FC units are often made as drop-in replacements.

=== Motorcycles and bicycles ===

In 2005, the British firm Intelligent Energy produced the first working hydrogen run motorcycle called the ENV (Emission Neutral Vehicle). It holds enough fuel to run for four hours, and to travel in an urban area, at a top speed of . There are other examples of bikes and bicycles with a hydrogen fuel cell engine. The Suzuki Burgman received &quot;whole vehicle type&quot; approval in the EU. The PHB was a hydrogen bicycle with an electric motor. It debuted in Shanghai in 2008, but it was discontinued due to lack of hydrogen fuel services. Its predecessor was a hydrogen bicycle called Palcan, based in Vancouver, Canada.

=== Airplanes ===
Boeing researchers and industry partners throughout Europe conducted experimental flight tests in February 2008 of a crewed airplane powered only by a fuel cell and lightweight batteries. The Fuel Cell Demonstrator Airplane, as it was called, used a Proton-Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell/lithium-ion battery hybrid system to power an electric motor, which was coupled to a conventional propeller.
In 2003, the world&#x27;s first propeller driven airplane to be powered entirely by a fuel cell was flown. The fuel cell was a unique FlatStack stack design which allowed the fuel cell to be integrated with the aerodynamic surfaces of the plane.

There have been several fuel cell powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). A Horizon fuel cell UAV set the record distance flown by a small UAV in 2007. The military is especially interested in this application because of the low noise, low thermal signature and ability to attain high altitude. In 2009, the Naval Research Laboratory&#x27;s (NRL&#x27;s) Ion Tiger utilized a hydrogen-powered fuel cell and flew for 23 hours and 17 minutes. Boeing is completing tests on the Phantom Eye, a high-altitude, long endurance (HALE) to be used to conduct research and surveillance flying at for up to four days at a time. Fuel cells are also being used to provide auxiliary power for aircraft, replacing fossil fuel generators that were previously used to start the engines and power on board electrical needs. Fuel cells can help airplanes reduce CO2 and other pollutant emissions and noise.

=== Boats ===
The world&#x27;s first Fuel Cell Boat HYDRA used an AFC system with 6.5 kW net output. For each liter of fuel consumed, the average outboard motor produces 140 times less the hydrocarbons produced by the average modern car. Fuel cell engines have higher energy efficiencies than combustion engines, and therefore offer better range and significantly reduced emissions. Amsterdam introduced its first fuel cell powered boat in 2011 that ferries people around the city&#x27;s canals.

=== Submarines ===

The first submersible application of fuel cells is the German Type 212 submarine. Each Type 212 contains nine PEM fuel cells, spread throughout the ship, providing between 30 kW and 50 kW each of electrical power. This allows the Type 212 to remain submerged longer and makes them more difficult to detect. Fuel cell powered submarines are also easier to design, manufacture, and maintain than nuclear-powered submarines.

===Trains===

In March 2015, China South Rail Corporation (CSR) demonstrated the world&#x27;s first hydrogen fuel cell-powered tramcar at an assembly facility in Qingdao. 83 miles of tracks for the new vehicle were built in seven Chinese cities. China had plans to spend 200 billion yuan ($32 billion) over the next five years to increase tram tracks to more than 1,200 miles.

In 2016, Alstom debuted the Coradia iLint, a regional train powered by hydrogen fuel cells. It was designed to reach and travel on a full tank of hydrogen. The train entered service in Germany in 2018 and is expected to be tested in the Netherlands beginning in 2019.

Swiss manufacturer Stadler Rail signed a contract in California to deliver a hydrogen fuel cell train in the US, the FLIRT H2 train, in 2024 as part of the Arrow commuter rail service.

===Trucks ===

For transport applications such as long-haul trucks, fuel cells are a potential solution for zero emission transport. A 2022 study in &quot;Energies&quot; magazine cites relatively fast refueling times compared with electric truck charging times and the current limitations of the energy density of batteries, but they note that &quot;operating constraints&quot; include the &quot;high amount of CO2 emissions [caused by] hydrogen production&quot;, the lack of storage and refueling infrastructure, H2 leakage and safety challenges, efficiency &quot;losses in compression, storage and dispensing&quot;, .

In 2020, Hyundai started to manufacture hydrogen powered 34-ton cargo trucks under the model name XCIENT, making an initial shipment of 10 of the vehicles to Switzerland. They are able to travel on a full tank and take 8 to 20 minutes to fill up. In 2022, Total Transportation Services (TTSI), Toyota Logistics Services (TLS), UPS, and Southern Counties Express (SCE) operated a 12-month &quot;Shore-to-Store (S2S) project&quot; running hydrogen fuel cell trucks on trips from Los Angeles area ports. The Kenworth T680 hydrogen prototype used in Los Angeles and Long Beach was unveiled in 2018 and also tested in the Seattle area.

==Hydrogen infrastructure==
Eberle and Rittmar von Helmolt stated in 2010 that challenges remain before fuel cell cars can become competitive with other technologies and cite the lack of an extensive hydrogen infrastructure in the U.S.: , there were 43 publicly accessible hydrogen refueling stations in the US, 41 of which were located in California. In 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed AB 8, a bill to fund $20 million a year for 10 years to build up to 100 stations. In 2014, the California Energy Commission funded $46.6 million to build 28 stations.

Japan got its first commercial hydrogen fueling station in 2014. By March 2016, Japan had 80 hydrogen fueling stations, and the Japanese government aims to double this number to 160 by 2020. In May 2017, there were 91 hydrogen fueling stations in Japan. Germany had 18 public hydrogen fueling stations in July 2015. The German government hoped to increase this number to 50 by end of 2016, but only 30 were open in June 2017.

==Codes and standards==
Under United Nations global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, specifically regarding hydrogen usage, there are international standards which define aspects of engineering and overall integrity, performance, safety, part lifecycle, and various other categories. One notable area of these regulations is regarding the compressed hydrogen storage systems that typically reach the end of qualified service life at 15 or fewer years in use.

==US programs==
In 2003, US President George Bush proposed the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative (HFI). The HFI aimed to further develop hydrogen fuel cells and infrastructure technologies to accelerate the commercial introduction of fuel cell vehicles. By 2008, the U.S. had contributed 1 billion dollars to this project. In 2009, Steven Chu, then the US Secretary of Energy, asserted that hydrogen vehicles &quot;will not be practical over the next 10 to 20 years&quot;. In 2012, however, Chu stated that he saw fuel cell cars as more economically feasible as natural gas prices had fallen and hydrogen reforming technologies had improved. In June 2013, the California Energy Commission granted $18.7M for hydrogen fueling stations. In 2013, Governor Brown signed AB 8, a bill to fund $20 million a year for 10 years for up to 100 stations. In 2013, the US DOE announced up to $4 million planned for &quot;continued development of advanced hydrogen storage systems&quot;. On May 13, 2013, the Energy Department launched H2USA, which is focused on advancing hydrogen infrastructure in the US.

== Cost ==
By 2010, advancements in fuel cell technology had reduced the size, weight and cost of fuel cell electric vehicles. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated that the cost of automobile fuel cells had fallen 80% since 2002 and that such fuel cells could potentially be manufactured for $51/kW, assuming high-volume manufacturing cost savings. Fuel cell electric vehicles have been produced with &quot;a driving range of more than 250 miles between refueling&quot;. They can be refueled in less than 5 minutes. Deployed fuel cell buses have a 40% higher fuel economy than diesel buses. EERE&#x27;s Fuel Cell Technologies Program claims that, as of 2011, fuel cells achieved a 42 to 53% fuel cell electric vehicle efficiency at full power, and a durability of over 75,000 miles with less than 10% voltage degradation, double that achieved in 2006. In 2012, Lux Research, Inc. issued a report that concluded that &quot;Capital cost ... will limit adoption to a mere 5.9 GW&quot; by 2030, providing &quot;a nearly insurmountable barrier to adoption, except in niche applications&quot;. Lux&#x27;s analysis concluded that by 2030, PEM stationary fuel cell applications will reach $1 billion, while the vehicle market, including fuel cell forklifts, will reach a total of $2 billion.

As of September 2023, hydrogen cost $36 per kilogram at public charging stations in California, 14 times as much per mile for a Mirai as compared with a Tesla Model 3. The average price in Germany in 2023 is 12.5 euro per kg.

== Environmental impact ==
The environmental impact of fuel cell vehicles depends on the primary energy with which the hydrogen was produced. Fuel cell vehicles are only environmentally benign when the hydrogen was produced with renewable energy. If this is the case fuel cell cars may be cleaner and more efficient than fossil fuel cars. However, they are not as efficient as battery electric vehicles which consume much less energy. Usually a fuel cell car consumes 2.4 times more energy than a battery electric car, because electrolysis and storage of hydrogen is much less efficient than using electricity to directly load a battery. In addition, a 2023 study by the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (CICERO) estimated that leaked hydrogen has a global warming effect 11.6 times stronger than CO₂.

As of 2009, motor vehicles used most of the petroleum consumed in the U.S. and produced over 60% of the carbon monoxide emissions and about 20% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, however production of hydrogen for hydrocracking used in gasoline production, chief amongst its industrial uses, was responsible for approximately 10% of fleet wide greenhouse gas emissions. A vehicle fueled with pure hydrogen emits few pollutants at the tailpipe, producing mainly water and heat, along with trace amounts of NOx, SOx, NO2, SO2, CO, hydrocarbons and particulates; the production of the hydrogen generally creates pollutants, except for the small amount that is made using only renewable energy.

In 2006, Ulf Bossel stated that the large amount of energy required to isolate hydrogen from natural compounds (water, natural gas, biomass), package the light gas by compression or liquefaction, transfer the energy carrier to the user, plus the energy lost when it is converted to useful electricity with fuel cells, leaves around 25% for practical use.&quot; Richard Gilbert, co-author of &quot;Transport Revolutions: Moving People and Freight without Oil&quot; (2010), comments similarly, that producing hydrogen gas ends up using some of the energy it creates. Then, energy is taken up by converting the hydrogen back into electricity within fuel cells. This means that only a quarter of the initially available energy reaches the electric motor&#x27; ... Such losses in conversion don&#x27;t stack up well against, for instance, recharging an electric vehicle (EV) like the Nissan Leaf or Chevy Volt from a wall socket&quot;. A 2010 well-to-wheels analysis of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles report from Argonne National Laboratory states that renewable H2 pathways offer much larger green house gas benefits. This result has recently been confirmed. In 2010, a US DOE well-to-wheels publication assumed that the efficiency of the single step of compressing hydrogen to at the refueling station is 94%. A 2016 study in the November issue of the journal &quot;Energy&quot; by scientists at Stanford University and the Technical University of Munich concluded that, even assuming local hydrogen production, &quot;investing in all-electric battery vehicles is a more economical choice for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, primarily due to their lower cost and significantly higher energy efficiency.&quot;

==Criticism of fuel cell cars==
In 2008, professor Jeremy P. Meyers, in the Electrochemical Society journal &quot;Interface&quot; wrote that fuel cells &quot;are not as efficient as batteries, due primarily to the inefficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction. ... [T]hey make the most sense for operation disconnected from the grid, or when fuel can be provided continuously. For applications that require frequent and relatively rapid start-ups ... where zero emissions are a requirement, as in enclosed spaces such as warehouses.&quot; Also in 2008, &quot;Wired News&quot; reported that &quot;experts say it will be 40 years or more before hydrogen has any meaningful impact on gasoline consumption or global warming, and we can&#x27;t afford to wait that long. In the meantime, fuel cells are diverting resources from more immediate solutions.&quot; In 2008, Robert Zubrin, the author of &quot;Energy Victory&quot;, said: &quot;Hydrogen is &#x27;just about the worst possible vehicle fuel. If hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy, &quot;it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in 2009, &quot;Any way you look at it, hydrogen is a lousy way to move cars.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; asked in November 2009, &quot;[W]hy would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor, when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over America and stored in auto batteries...?&quot;

&quot;The Motley Fool&quot; stated in 2013 that &quot;there are still cost-prohibitive obstacles [for hydrogen cars] relating to transportation, storage, and, most importantly, production.&quot; Volkswagen&#x27;s Rudolf Krebs said in 2013 that &quot;no matter how excellent you make the cars themselves, the laws of physics hinder their overall efficiency. The most efficient way to convert energy to mobility is electricity.&quot; He elaborated: &quot;Hydrogen mobility only makes sense if you use green energy&quot;, but ... you need to convert it first into hydrogen &quot;with low efficiencies&quot; where &quot;you lose about 40 percent of the initial energy&quot;. You then must compress the hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks, which uses more energy. &quot;And then you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss&quot;. Krebs continued: &quot;in the end, from your original 100 percent of electric energy, you end up with 30 to 40 percent.&quot;

In 2014, electric automotive and energy futurist Julian Cox wrote that producing hydrogen from methane &quot;is significantly more carbon intensive per unit of energy than coal. Mistaking fossil hydrogen from the hydraulic fracturing of shales for an environmentally sustainable energy pathway threatens to encourage energy policies that will dilute and potentially derail global efforts to head-off climate change due to the risk of diverting investment and focus from vehicle technologies that are economically compatible with renewable energy.&quot; In 2014, former Dept. of Energy official Joseph Romm concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an FCV fleet &quot;either now or in the future.&quot; GreenTech Media&#x27;s analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014. In 2015, &quot;Clean Technica&quot; listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

A 2017 analysis published in &quot;Green Car Reports&quot; found that the best hydrogen fuel cell vehicles consume &quot;more than three times more electricity per mile than an electric vehicle ... generate more greenhouse-gas emissions than other powertrain technologies ... [and have] very high fuel costs. ... Considering all the obstacles and requirements for new infrastructure (estimated to cost as much as $400 billion), fuel-cell vehicles seem likely to be a niche technology at best, with little impact on U.S. oil consumption. In 2017, Michael Barnard, writing in &quot;Forbes&quot;, listed the continuing disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell cars and concluded that &quot;by about 2008, it was very clear that hydrogen was and would be inferior to battery technology as a storage of energy for vehicles. [B]y 2025 the last hold outs should likely be retiring their fuel cell dreams.” A 2019 video by &quot;Real Engineering&quot; noted that using hydrogen as a fuel for cars does not help to reduce carbon emissions from transportation. The 95% of hydrogen still produced from fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, and producing hydrogen from water is an energy-consuming process. Storing hydrogen requires more energy either to cool it down to the liquid state or to put it into tanks under high pressure, and delivering the hydrogen to fueling stations requires more energy and may release more carbon. The hydrogen needed to move a FCV a kilometer costs approximately eight times as much as the electricity needed to move a BEV the same distance. Also in 2019, Katsushi Inoue, the president of Honda Europe, stated, &quot;Our focus is on hybrid and electric vehicles now. Maybe hydrogen fuel cell cars will come, but that&#x27;s a technology for the next era.&quot;

Assessments since 2020 have concluded that hydrogen vehicles are still only 38% efficient, while battery EVs from 80% to 95% efficient. A 2021 assessment by CleanTechnica concluded that while hydrogen cars are far less efficient than electric cars, the vast majority of hydrogen being produced is polluting grey hydrogen, and delivering hydrogen would require building a vast and expensive new infrastructure, the remaining two &quot;advantages of fuel cell vehicles – longer range and fast fueling times – are rapidly being eroded by improving battery and charging technology.&quot; A 2022 study in &quot;Nature Electronics&quot; agreed.

==Innovation==

Fuel cell patent fillings in the area of hydrogen fuel cells increased in the 1960s, partly due to NASAs space program; another increase in the 80s was driven by research for automobiles. This was followed by a surge in filings from 2000 to 2005 by inventors in Japan, US and South Korea. Since then, China has dominated patent fillings in the field, with a smaller number in Japan, Germany, South Korea and the US. Between 2016 and 2020, annual filings, particularly for transportation applications, increased by a further 23%.

Almost 80% of the patents in the area of fuel cells for transportation were filed by car companies. Academia is collaborating actively with the industry. Although filings related to road vehicles such as cars and trucks dominate, inventions in other areas like shipping, aviation, rail and other special vehicles is increasing. Airbus, a major aircraft manufacturer, has increased its patenting activity in the area since 2019. The number of fuel cell patents for shipping applications is comparable in size to the one for aviation and similarly slow in growth.

A 2022 World Intellectual Property Organization report argues that because heavy-duty vehicles, such as construction vehicles, forklifts, and airport tugs require a higher payload, the high energy density of hydrogen can make fuel cells a more advantageous solution than battery applications.

Born in New Madison, Ohio, Force died in Brooklyn, Michigan as a result a heart attack at Michigan International Speedway. He drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1951–1952, 1954, 1956, and 1958-1960 seasons with 33 starts, including the 1951 and 1960 Indianapolis 500 races. He finished in the top ten 16 times, with his best career finish in 3rd place occurring on 3 occasions.

The &quot;McKay Special&quot; #37 car that Force drove in the 1960 Indianapolis 500 was a 1959 Kurtis Kraft 500J, owned and entered by Roy McKay of Dayton, Ohio. Charlie Altfater was the mechanic. The car has survived in largely original condition and is now restored to appear as it did in the 1960 race, and can occasionally be seen participating in vintage races, as it did at the 2008 Monterey historics.

<text>Gerald Frederick Hoyt (January 29, 1929 – July 11, 1955) was an American racing driver from Chicago, mainly competing in the National Championship. He died on July 11, 1955, after crashing in a sprint car race at Oklahoma City.

Hoyt served in the 101st Airborne Division during the Second World War.

==Indy 500==
In the 1955 Indianapolis 500 Hoyt surprised many, including himself, by winning the pole (first starting position) in qualifications. His average speed for the run of 140.045 miles per hour was at the time the second fastest ever at the speedway. However an oil leak would force him to retire from the race after 40 laps. As the 500 was part of the FIA World Championship at the time, Hoyt was credited for being the youngest pole sitter in the history of the series to that point. In his four races at the speedway, he would never complete more than 130 laps in the 200 lap race.

==Death==
On July 11, 1955, two months after winning the pole at Indianapolis, Hoyt was entered into a sprint car race in Oklahoma City. On the first lap, his car made contact with a fence, causing it to overturn. The cars of the time provided little protection for the driver&#x27;s head, and Hoyt died the next morning of brain injuries. He had been married just two weeks earlier.

He is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

*Although Hoyt started the 1955 race from the pole position, his qualifying speed ranked tenth behind fastest qualifier Jack McGrath. This is the lowest speed rank for a pole sitter in the Indianapolis modern era.

<text>Peter Baumann (born 29 January 1953) is a German musician. He formed the core line-up of the pioneering German electronic group Tangerine Dream with Edgar Froese and Christopher Franke in 1971. Baumann composed his first solo album in 1976, while still touring with the band, and embarked on a solo career in 1977. He founded the record label Private Music. Since the early 2000s, Baumann has devoted his time to studying and promoting initiatives in science and philosophy that shed light on the human condition.

== Background ==
Peter Baumann was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1953, his father a composer, his mother an actress. When he was eight, the Berlin Wall was built, and Baumann entered the American/German Community School in Berlin, where he learned English and was first exposed to American culture. At age 14, Peter joined a cover band and performed at G.I. clubs. Then, in 1971, at age 18, he met Christopher Franke, and ended up joining Tangerine Dream as a replacement for their former organist Steve Schroyder.

Two years later, Tangerine Dream signed with Virgin Records and their first album on the label, &quot;Phaedra&quot;, became a Top 10 seller on the Melody Maker charts. As a result of this and other recording successes, Tangerine Dream toured the world for eight years. They also made successful forays into film scoring.

Baumann had temporarily left Tangerine Dream twice, first in 1973 (returning in time for Franke &amp; Froese to shelf their current work on &quot;Green Desert&quot; and the three to start anew on what was to become &quot;Phaedra&quot;), and again in 1975, leaving Michael Hoenig as a temporary substitute for an Australian tour. His departure in 1977, shortly after the completion of the band&#x27;s first U.S. tour, was final and led to a brief solo career.

During the 1980s, he founded a record label, Private Music, specializing in instrumental music in a style popularly referred to as new-age. Artists signed to the label included Yanni, Patrick O&#x27;Hearn, Jerry Goodman, Suzanne Ciani, and former bandmates Tangerine Dream. In 1996, the label was sold to Windham Hill Records&#x27; parent company, BMG, who continue to distribute some of the back catalogue of its more successful artists.

== The Baumann Foundation ==
Following his music career, Peter Baumann moved to San Francisco, where in 2009 he founded the Baumann Foundation: a think-tank that explores the experience of being human in the context of cognitive science, evolutionary theory and philosophy. The foundation pursues its fundamental mission, to foster greater clarity about the human condition, by organizing initiatives that facilitate scientific research and promote discussions between scientists, contemplatives, and the public. The Baumann Foundation&#x27;s main initiative is &quot;Beinghuman.org,&quot; a social website designed to spark a global conversation about how current developments in fields like behavioral economics, cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, genetics, anthropology, and philosophy can help people make sense of their experiences.

In 2012 the foundation sponsored Being Human 2012, an interdisciplinary conference held in San Francisco’s Palace of Fine Arts that brought together neuroscientists, philosophers, evolutionary theorists and meditation experts to hold a public dialogue about the nature of humanity.

Baumann is the co-author, with Michael W. Taft, of the 2011 book &quot;Ego: The Fall of the Twin Towers and the Rise of an Enlightened Humanity.&quot; The book draws on new research in neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and other scientific fields to examine the origin and history of the human ego and the evolutionary implications of the September 11 attacks.

== Personal life ==
Baumann has been married to Alison Baumann since 1983, and has three children. He is the director of several real estate and natural resource companies. In addition to creating the Baumann Foundation, he is on the board of directors of the California Institute of Integral Studies and is a fellow of the Mind and Life Institute.

<doc id="1252102" wikidata="Q172441" url="?curid=1252102" title="Jerry Unser Jr.">
<text>Jeremy Michael Unser Jr. (November 15, 1932 – May 17, 1959) was an American racecar driver. He was the 1957 USAC Stock Car champion.

Jerry was the first of the Unser family to compete at Indianapolis. In his only start, in 1958, he was caught up in a 13-car pileup on the first lap and flew over the turn three wall, emerging unhurt. He died in a practice crash before the 1959 Indianapolis 500, leaving behind a widow, Jeanne Unser, and two sons, Jerry and Johnny Unser.

His brothers Al and Bobby and his nephew Al Jr. have won the &quot;500&quot;. His son Johnny and nephew Robby have also competed in the race.

==Death==

On May 2, 1959, on the second day of qualifying for the 1959 Indianapolis 500, Unser lost control of his car coming out of turn 4 on a practice lap. The car hit the wall after spinning, then went end over end down the front straightaway, leaving behind a trail of parts. The car burst into flames as a result. Track officials estimated his speed just before the accident to be about 133 mph. He was conscious during his rescue, yelling &quot;My legs are on fire. Call my wife.&quot; Before he could be pulled from the vehicle, the fire had to be put out. Unser was taken to Methodist Hospital with a broken neck and 3rd degree burns over both legs and one arm. In critical condition, he suffered burns over 35 percent of his body, and was in a coma. Unser died from his injuries and pneumonia two weeks later on May 17, 1959. Following the accident, it became mandatory for drivers to wear fire-resistant driving suits. Most drivers already wore the suits, but some drivers at the time wore t-shirts.

<doc id="1252105" wikidata="Q172585" url="?curid=1252105" title="Jim Hurtubise">
<text>James Ernest Hurtubise (December 5, 1932 – January 6, 1989) was an American racing driver who competed in Championship Cars, sprint cars and stock cars. Hurtubise enjoyed much success in sprint cars, champ dirt cars, and stock cars, and was the winner of the 1966 Atlanta 500; however, he never achieved the success at the Indianapolis 500 which his rookie qualifying run promised, when he out qualified pole-sitter Eddie Sachs by three mph, nearly breaking the 150 mph mark. 

&quot;Herk&quot; was a fan favorite throughout much of his career because of his fun-loving attitude and his hard driving style.

==Championship Car career==

Hurtubise raced in the USAC Championship Car series in the 1959–1968 and 1970–1974 seasons, with 97 career starts. He finished in the top ten 38 times, with 4 victories, in 1959 at Sacramento, 1960 at Langhorne, and 1961 and 1962 at Springfield. In 1964, after suffering serious burns in an accident during the Rex Mays Classic at the Milwaukee Mile, doctors asked Hurtubise how he wanted his hands shaped permanently. Hurtubise told them to pin his hands so he cold hold a beer can, knowing that if he &quot;could hold a beer can, (he) could hold a steering wheel.&quot; Hurtubise would later be awarded the Ralph DePalma award for overcoming his injuries to return to racing.

Hurtubise ran in ten Indianapolis 500 races between 1960 and 1974. His best finish was a 13th in 1962. Hurtubise was named the 1960 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year.

In 1965, he qualified using a Novi engine, the last year that engine would be used in the race, having been considered 
obsolete several years before. The engine failed on the first lap, and he finished last.

In 1966, he entered a rear-engined car, which was taking over from the front-engined roadsters as the standard for the race, and finished 17th.

After failing to qualify in 1967, in 1968 he ran the last front-engined car to date in the race. He and his brother Pete designed and built the new roadster in their garage, naming it the &quot;Mallard&quot;. He claimed the car was lighter than previous roadsters, which would allow it to be competitive with the other rear-engine cars.

From 1969 through 1971, he would continue to attempt to qualify with the roadster, but failed to make the field, which was now fully rear-engined cars.

In 1972, he had qualified a rear-engine car 13th. However on &quot;bump day&quot;, he put the roadster, sponsored by Miller Beer in line to make a qualification attempt shortly before the closing deadline of 6:00 pm. The time expired before it was his turn to qualify. He then removed the engine cover to reveal that the car had no engine, but five chilled cases of his sponsor&#x27;s product, which he shared with the other pit crews and race officials

From 1973 through 1975, he attempted to qualify rear-engine cars, missing the field in 1973 and 1975, while qualifying 28th in 1974, finishing the race 28th after blowing the engine on lap 31. This would be the last year he would successfully qualify for the race.

For the 1976 and 1977 races, he was back with his front-engine Mallard roadster, but wasn&#x27;t quick enough to make the field. In 1978, he returned, once again attempting to qualify the Mallard, but Tom Binford, the chief steward, refused to allow him a qualifying attempt, stating the car had not showed it was capable of race speed during practice. He then sat in entrant Bob Harkey’s car for ten minutes refusing to move. After finally leaving the car he ran onto the track where he was tackled and apprehended by the police.

In subsequent years, he continued to attempt to get the Mallard into the field, with his final attempt in 1981. This was the final attempt for any front-engine car in the race, 13 years after the last time a car of that type had qualified for the race, and 17 years since the last time one had won.

===Final race for the Mallard===
In 1972, Hurtubise drove the Mallard in an IndyCar race at Michigan in 1972, qualifying 26th (last) and finishing 23rd. He drove the same car a year earlier at the Pocono 500, qualifying 33rd (last) and finishing 30th. This would be the last time a front-engine car would ever run in an IndyCar race.

==NASCAR career==

In 1957, Hurtubise started his NASCAR career running two races. Over the next twenty years, he would enter 36 races, winning one race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, and amassing eleven top ten finishes.

==Personal life==

Hurtubise was from the Buffalo suburb of North Tonawanda, New York.

Hurtubise died January 6, 1989, after suffering a heart attack near his home in Port Arthur, Texas. He was 56 years old. He is interred at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

==Awards and honors==

He was inducted into the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1993. Hurtubise was the 1998 pioneer selection for the Northeast Dirt Modified Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1252109" wikidata="Q172510" url="?curid=1252109" title="Jim Rathmann (racing driver)">
<text>Royal Richard &quot;Jim&quot; Rathmann (July 16, 1928 – November 23, 2011), was an American racing driver who competed primarily in Championship Cars. Rathmann is best known for winning the Indianapolis 500 in 1960, emerging victorious after a race-long duel with Rodger Ward – as recently as 2023, a panel of fans and historians voted Rathmann&#x27;s victory as the greatest &#x27;500&#x27; of all time. In Europe he is well-known for winning the 1958 Race of Two Worlds.

Rathmann and his older brother swapped names while teenagers. As a 16-year-old going by the name of Dick Rathmann, he wanted to start racing. To enter races, he borrowed his older brother&#x27;s I.D. and assumed the identity of &quot;[[Dick Rathmann|Jim Rathmann]].&quot; The name change stuck for life in public circles.

== Driving career ==

=== Championship Car career ===

Rathmann drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series in the 1949–1950 and 1952–1963 seasons with 38 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 during each of those seasons. He had 2 victories in addition to his Indianapolis 500 win, including the USAC Daytona 100.

Rathmann also participated in the two runnings of the Race of Two Worlds at Monza, Italy, winning the 1958 race, a non-championship event.

==== 1960 Indianapolis 500 victory ====

Starting in the middle of the first row, Rathmann ran in the front the entire race. From the midway point on, Rathmann and fellow driver Rodger Ward were locked in a neck and neck duel for first. Tire wear became an issue as the race wore on and Rathmann was able to keep his wheels fresh long enough to outrace Ward to the finish. The race featured the most recorded lead changes in Indianapolis 500 history, and has often been considered the greatest Indianapolis 500 ever run.

=== Stock car career ===

Rathmann competed in three NASCAR races from 1949 to 1951, competing in one race during each of those years. He debuted in 1949 at Langhorne, dropping out with mechanical issues. In 1950, Rathmann raced at the prestigious Daytona Beach Road Course. Starting 17th in this event, Rathmann finished 12th. In his final race in 1951, Rathmann started 9th at Detroit, but dropped out with mechanical issues.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship points and participation in addition to those which they received towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Rathmann participated in ten World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He won once, finished in the top three four times, recorded two fastest laps, and accumulated 29 World Drivers&#x27; Championship points. Rathmann&#x27;s points total is the largest number of World Drivers&#x27; Championship points earned by a driver competing solely in the Indianapolis 500.

== Post-racing career ==

Rathmann later owned a Chevrolet-Cadillac dealership in Melbourne, Florida, where he befriended astronauts Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, and Gordon Cooper. Rathmann convinced GM President Ed Cole to set up a program which supplied each astronaut with a pair of new cars each year. Most chose a family car for their wives and a Corvette for themselves. Alan Bean recalls Corvettes lined up in the parking lot outside the astronaut offices at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and friendly races between Shepard and Grissom along the Florida beach roads.

After retiring from the car business, Rathmann lived with his wife, Mary Kay, in Indialantic, Florida.

== Death ==

During the decades after his victory, Rathmann was a regular visitor to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during May each year. He drove the pace car several times. However, he missed the 100th-anniversary celebration in 2011 due to failing health. Rathmann died on November 23, 2011. He had reportedly suffered a seizure at his home days earlier and died at a hospice center in Melbourne, Florida.

== Awards and honors ==

Rathmann has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Florida Sports Hall of Fame (1978)
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1993)
* Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (2007)

<text>James Merriman Jackson (July 25, 1910 – November 25, 1984) was an American racing driver.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ==

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Jackson participated in two World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. His best finish was 15th place, and he scored no World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

==Personal life==
Jackson was a graduate of Arsenal Technical High School. He painted his 1946 Indianapolis 500 entry green, as gesture to the school&#x27;s colors, and finished second. This despite a superstition against painting race cars green at Indianapolis.

<text>James Garland Reece Sr. (November 17, 1929 – September 28, 1958) was an American racecar driver. He died in an accident during a 1958 Champ Car race at Trenton Speedway.

==1954 Bobby Ball Memorial race==
On November 8, 1954, Reece crashed during the Bobby Ball Memorial, an AAA Champ Car event held at the Arizona State Fairgrounds, sustaining &quot;a punctured lung, fractured right shoulder and possible internal injuries when his car flipped coming out of the south turn [...] and crashed into the east wall.&quot;

==AAA Championship Trail==
Reece and Bill Vukovich tied for 4th in the 1954 AAA championship standings. Reece scored 1000 points in 6 races by finishing 2nd, 3rd or 5th; Vukovich scored 1000 points for winning the Indianapolis 500.

==Death==
On September 28, 1958, Reece was killed during a USAC Champ Car race held at Trenton Speedway. On the first turn of the last lap, Reece&#x27;s inside wheels got into the dirt next to the concrete track, causing his car to change its direction and run up an embankment. After bursting through a two-foot wooden fence on the edge of the track, the Kurtis 500G spiraled through the air and smashed down on a hurricane fence, having ejected Reece, who died of multiple injuries in an ambulance.

<doc id="1252116" wikidata="Q366770" url="?curid=1252116" title="Johnnie Parsons">
<text>John Woodrow Parsons (July 4, 1918 – September 8, 1984) was an American racing driver in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series. He was the 1949 AAA national champion, and won the 1950 Indianapolis 500.

Parsons was known as a &quot;charger&quot; - needing others to compete against in order to bring out the best in him as a driver - frequently moving from near the back of the grid to the front in spectacular displays of driving ability. He drove for several seasons on a team owned by Frank Kurtis, owner of Kurtis Kraft, the leading constructor of AAA Championship cars during the early 1950s.

== Early life ==

Parsons was born in Los Angeles, California, to Harmon and Belle Parsons, who both made their living in show business. By the age of three, Parsons was a participant in his family&#x27;s song-and-dance act, working vaudeville theaters of the Orpheum Circuit. During these experiences Parsons developed a knack for showmanship that helped him become a fan favorite during his racing career. Parsons&#x27; parents separated in the mid-1920s, after which he went to live with his uncle, Jack Bridges, who owned a garage in Los Angeles.

Among those who leased space from Bridges included local legend dirt track driver Fred Lecklider, rising star Frank Lockhart, and Ralph DePalma, winner of the 1915 Indianapolis 500. Exposure to these drivers coupled with the experiences attending his first races at the Legion Ascot Speedway during the late 1920s inspired Parsons to aspire to a driving career for himself. As a teenager, he sold programs during midget races in the grandstands of venues such as Gilmore Stadium.

Parsons was heavily influenced by drivers such as Bob Swanson - a two-time winner of the Turkey Night Grand Prix - who were also skilled mechanics. Parsons, determined to emulate the career of Swanson, learned to weld and work on cars, becoming multi-talented within the sport. During junior high school he began working for some of the local drivers who had cars stored at his uncle&#x27;s garage. By the time of his graduation from Polytechnic High School, he had worked for drivers such as Curly Wetteroth and Kelly Petillo. He was then hired by an engineering firm in Glendale, where he did design layouts and worked as a welder.

== Driving career ==

=== Midget and Sprint car career ===

Parsons&#x27; open-wheel racing career began in 1940, competing in a midget race at Atlantic Boulevard Speedway in Los Angeles. Later that year, he scored his first victory at a race held in Colton, California. Around this time he began competing in semi-professional, United Midget Association (UMA) sanctioned midget races on the U.S West Coast. In 1942, Parsons won the UMA championship, winning 18 races during the season, which was interrupted by the Second World War. During the war, Parsons worked for the Douglas Aircraft Company.

Post-war, Parsons resumed racing in UMA sanctioned events throughout California. He also turned professional, in one week racing as often as five nights, and twice during Sundays. In 1947, Parsons raced out of state for the first time, relocating to the Midwest, where he competed in AAA-sanctioned events held throughout the United States. In 1948, Parsons claimed the AAA Midwest Midget championship, a year during which he won the prestigious third feature of the Night Before the 500 triple-header held at the 16th Street Speedway - located across from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. His successes during this year earned Parsons Championship Car opportunities.

Parsons continued racing midgets during his Championship car career. He won the 1955 Turkey Night Grand Prix midget car race, and also began racing sprint cars. In 1951, he finished third in the AAA Eastern Sprint Car championship.

=== Championship car career ===

Parsons began racing in the AAA after World War II. Parsons finished second in his first Indy 500 in 1949. He won the season championship that season. He also won the 1950 Indianapolis 500.

After he retired, he became the Chief Steward for the USAC Midget division on the West Coast in the 1970s.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship points and participation in addition to those which they received towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Parsons participated in nine World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He won once, recorded one fastest lap, and accumulated 12 World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

Parsons is one of only three drivers to win on their World Drivers&#x27; Championship début. The other two are Nino Farina, who won the inaugural World Championship race – the 1950 British Grand Prix, 17 days earlier – and Giancarlo Baghetti, who won the 1961 French Grand Prix.

== Personal life ==

Around 1942, Parsons met and married his first wife, Arza. Together they had two children; a son, John Wayne Parsons, and a daughter, Joan. John, commonly referred to as &quot;Johnny Parsons, Jr.,&quot; would grow up to also become a race car driver. Parsons, Sr. and Arza separated around 1947. Arza would later marry Duane Carter, having a son, Duane, Jr. - commonly known as &quot;Pancho&quot; - who coincidentally also grew up to be a race car driver.

In 1947, Parsons married his second wife, Lila, together having a daughter, named Patricia.

== Borg-Warner Trophy ==

Johnnie Parsons had the dubious distinction of being the only Indianapolis 500 winner to have his name misspelled on the Borg-Warner Trophy. The silversmith engraved &quot;Johnny&quot; instead of &quot;Johnnie.&quot; He had a son named Johnny who competed at Indy a dozen times. Evidence of the engraver&#x27;s mistake can be seen in MGM’s production, &quot;To Please a Lady&quot; (1950). When the camera pans across Johnnie Parsons&#x27; name and bust relief, while they’re doing a brief segment on the trophy, his misspelled name is revealed. In 1991, during a trophy restoration project, it was proposed to correct the spelling, albeit posthumously. However, it was decided to keep the error intact, as part of the trophy&#x27;s lore.

== Awards and honors ==

Parsons has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1984)
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1986)
* Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (2004)
* National Sprint Car Hall of Fame (2008)

=== Indianapolis 500 results ===



*Parsons initially failed to qualify for the 1957 Indianapolis 500. However, Dick Rathmann (who had qualified) was mugged the day before the race and therefore deemed unable to drive. Parsons was selected as replacement driver for the car and allowed to start from the position Dick Rathmann had qualified the car at (in later years such a driver change would see the car in question moved to the rear of the field).

<text>Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle is the debut album by Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, released in January 1976. Guest musicians on the album include Lowell George, Bobby Keys, Jay Ungar, and Tony Levin as well as family and friends such as eldest sister Jane McGarrigle, Anna McGarrigle&#x27;s husband Dane Lanken, and the siblings&#x27; old friend Chaim Tannenbaum.

&quot;Swimming Song&quot; was written and originally performed by Kate&#x27;s husband at the time, singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III, who is also referenced (without being explicitly named) in the song &quot;Go Leave&quot;.

==Reception==
In 2011, the British composer and television presenter Howard Goodall chose it as one of his &quot;six best albums&quot;, stating &quot;For me the two outstanding cuts are the utterly beautiful &#x27;Heart Like a Wheel&#x27; and the French-Canadian pseudo-folk song &#x27;Complainte pour Ste-Catherine&#x27;... the pair&#x27;s gentle harmonies are unmistakable and unforgettable.&quot;

==Awards==
On 25 December 1976, the album was voted Rock Album of the Year by London&#x27;s &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. It was also listed at #5 on the 1976 Pazz &amp; Jop poll. In 2016, the album was named as the jury winner of the Polaris Heritage Prize in the 1976-1985 division.

==Notable covers==
The album includes &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot; (by Anna McGarrigle), which was first recorded in 1972 by McKendree Spring, then by Linda Ronstadt in 1974. That song subsequently has been covered by several other artists, including Billy Bragg, Katie Moore, The Corrs, and June Tabor.

Another song from the album, &quot;(Talk to Me of) Mendocino&quot; (by Kate McGarrigle), was also covered by Linda Ronstadt on her 1982 album &quot;Get Closer&quot;, by the English singer-songwriter John Howard on his 2007 E.P. &quot;The Bewlay Brothers&quot;, by Nona Marie and The Choir on their 2011 eponymous album, and by Karine Polwart and Dave Milligan on their 2021 record &quot;Still As Your Sleeping&quot;. 

The song &quot;Complainte pour Ste-Catherine&quot; (by Anna McGarrigle and Philippe Tatartcheff) was covered by the British pop singer Kirsty MacColl in 1989.

The song &quot;Go Leave&quot; (by Kate McGarrigle) was covered by Anne Sofie von Otter with Elvis Costello.

Wallard was born in Schenectady, New York. He began competing in 1935, racing at dirt tracks and local fairgrounds. He endured a difficult start to his career, including an accident in which he broke his pelvis. He appeared in his first Championship Car event, Syracuse 100, in 1941.

Wallard enlisted in the U.S. Navy during the Second World War, serving with the U.S. Navy Seabees. He spent part of the conflict in Alaska, operating a bulldozer during the construction of numerous airfields.

== Post-war driving career ==

=== Championship car career ===

Wallard resumed his racing career following the war, competing more often at the AAA Championship level. He scored one victory in a &quot;big car&quot; event during the anomalous 1946 season. He scored his second, a regular &quot;Championship car&quot; victory, at DuQuoin during 1948.

==== Indianapolis 500 victory ====

In the 1951 Indianapolis 500 Wallard drove the Number 99 Belanger Special to victory, at age 40. Tony Bettenhausen had passed up the car, because he wanted to drive a newer front-wheel drive vehicle. 

Starting on the front row, Wallard dominated the event, setting a pace that his competitors and their equipment struggled to match. Wallard led 159 of the 200 laps, and became the first driver to complete the event in less than four hours.

=== Career-ending injury ===

A week after winning the Indianapolis 500, Wallard was injured during an auto race in Reading, PA. He was severely burned when his race car caught fire in the home stretch of that race. He required 27 skin grafts. In 1954 he attempted to compete in Indianapolis again. He retired before qualifications, discovering the loss of muscle tissue he suffered in his accident made it impossible for him to handle his car at a competitive speed.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Wallard participated in two World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He won once, and set one fastest leader lap. He scored nine World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Post-driving life ==

Wallard later moved to Florida, and died of a heart attack related to the injuries he had suffered in 1951.

== Awards and honors ==

Wallard has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1955)
* Schenectady City School District Athletic Hall of Fame (2013)

== Motorsports career results ==

=== AAA Championship Car results ===
* 1946 table only includes results of the six races run to &quot;championship car&quot; specifications. Points total includes the 71 races run to &quot;big car&quot; specifications.

<text>Len Sutton (August 9, 1925 – December 3, 2006) was an American racecar driver. He is best known for finishing second at the 1962 Indianapolis 500.

==Early racing career==
A lifelong resident of Portland, Oregon, Sutton became involved in auto racing after serving in the Navy during World War II. He spun out in the first corner on his first lap at a dirt track. Sutton won Oregon Racing Association championships in 1949, 1950, 1954, and 1955. He flipped his car to avoid cattle during the 1954 Carrera Panamericana road race (now Baja 1000). He was in a body cast for 4 months. He also won midget car racing championships in Portland before he headed east to become a national touring driver.

==National circuits==
He raced in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series from 1955 to 1965, with 76 career starts, 43 top ten finishes, and 3 victories.

Sutton completed his rookie test for the Indianapolis 500 in 1956. He flipped his car while attempting 140 miles per hour for the 1957 Indianapolis 500. He slide upside down with his helmet scraping the asphalt for nearly 1000 feet (300 m). A report in the following day&#x27;s Indianapolis News said &quot;Sutton was at first believed dead by observers on the scene.&quot; His injuries included broken shoulder, serious abrasions on his back, and a fractured skull. He returned to Indianapolis the following year and made his first start in the event. That year he finished 32nd after being eliminated in a multi-car accident during the first lap. He competed in the 500 six more times and had his best result in 1962. After starting the race 4th, he led 9 laps and finished second behind his teammate Rodger Ward. The next year, he set an unofficial Indianapolis Motor Speedway record when he went over during a tire test.

Known for his versatility as a driver, Sutton also competed in roadsters, midgets, sprint cars, and stock cars. He finished 31st in the 1963 Daytona 500. Sutton decided to retire from driving during a 1965 race at Langhorne Speedway. Fellow competitor Mel Kenyon was severely burned in the race.

==Broadcaster after retirement and death==
After retiring from driving, Sutton went into broadcasting and was a member of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network for many years.

Sutton died at his home in Portland at age 81 after a long battle with cancer.

<text>Marshall Pleasant Teague (February 22, 1921 – February 11, 1959) was an American race car driver nicknamed by NASCAR fans as the &quot;King of the Beach&quot; for his performances at the Daytona Beach Road Course.

He walked into fellow Daytona Beach resident Smokey Yunick&#x27;s &quot;Best Damned Garage in Town&quot;, and launched Yunick&#x27;s NASCAR mechanic career.

==Career==

Teague competed in 23 NASCAR Grand National Series races from 1949 to 1952, winning seven of them.

Teague approached the Hudson Motor Car Company by traveling to Michigan and visiting the automaker&#x27;s factory without an appointment. By the end of his visit, Hudson virtually assured Teague of corporate support and cars, with the relationship formalized shortly after his visit. This &quot;is generally regarded as the first stock car racing team backed by a Detroit auto manufacturer.&quot;

During the 1951 and 1952 racing seasons, Teague was a member of the Hudson Motors team and driving what were called the &quot;Fabulous Hudson Hornet&quot; stock cars.

Teague was also instrumental in helping Hudson tune the straight-6 powered Hudson Hornet to its maximum stock capability. When combined with the car&#x27;s light weight and low center of gravity, the Hornet allowed Teague and the other Hudson drivers to dominate stock car racing from 1951 through 1954, consistently beating out other drivers in cars powered by larger, more modern engines. Smokey Yunick and Teague won 27 of 34 events in major stock car events.

In 1953, Teague dropped out of NASCAR following a dispute with NASCAR founder William France Sr. and went to the AAA and USAC racing circuits.

The Indianapolis 500 was part of the FIA World Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indy during those years were credited with World Championship points and participation. Teague participated in three World Championship races, but scored no World Championship points.

==Death==
Driving a reconfigured Indy car at the newly opened Daytona International Speedway, Teague died while attempting to break the closed course speed record, which had been established by Tony Bettenhausen in qualifying for the 1957 Race of Two Worlds at about 177 mph. Teague was conducting test sessions in preparation for the April start of the 1959 USAC Championship Car season, piloting a &quot;Sumar Special&quot; streamliner, a Kurtis Kraft chassis with a 270 c.i. Meyer-Drake Offenhauser engine, streamlined fenders, and a canopy enclosing the driver, thus being classified as Formula Libre.

On February 9, 1959, Teague, clocked at , markedly improved Ed Elisian&#x27;s unofficial 148-mph-one-lap record for an American race track, which had been set in preparation for the 1958 Indianapolis 500.

The next day, the left rear tire was cut as a result of running over a foreign object, which forced Teague to pit.

Teague was trying to go even faster on February 11, 1959, 11 days before the first Daytona 500. &quot;Teague pushed the speed envelope in the high-powered Sumar Special streamliner – to an estimated .&quot; His car spun and flipped through the third turn and Teague was thrown, seat and all, from his car. He died nearly instantly, 11 days shy of his 38th birthday.

==Legacy==
Teague was the inspiration for Doc Hudson in the film &quot;Cars&quot;.

After serving in the Army during World War II, Magill raced in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series from 1955 to 1959, with 15 career starts. He finished in the top ten 7 times, with his best finish in 4th position in 1955 at Langhorne.

Magill competed in the Indianapolis 500 three times, with his first start coming in 1957. The next year, when racing legend Juan Manuel Fangio was unable to compete due to a contractual conflict, Magill drove the car in which Fangio had been practicing. He was involved in an accident in the first lap of the race but, after over an hour in the pits, he returned to the track to finish 17th. He drove in his final 500 in 1959, when he was eliminated from the race in a four-car accident.

<text>Myron William Fohr (June 17, 1912 – January 14, 1994) was an American racing driver, notable for his Indy car career. He finished runner-up in the American Automobile Association (AAA) National Championship in 1948 and 1949, and twice raced in the Indianapolis 500.

== Racing career ==

Fohr made 25 AAA Championship car starts from 1947 through 1950. He won four times, twice in 1948 (at Milwaukee and Springfield) and twice in 1949 (at Milwaukee and Trenton; back-to-back rounds of the championship). He finished second in the national championship in both 1948 and 1949. Aside from a good finish in the Indianapolis 500, Fohr endured a dismal 1950 season, failing to qualify several times. His last Championship car appearances came in 1951, when he failed to qualify for both the Indianapolis 500 and the following race at the Milwaukee Mile.

Fohr won a number of AAA-sanctioned stock car feature races at his hometown track, the Milwaukee Mile.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Fohr participated in one World Drivers&#x27; Championship race at Indianapolis. He finished in 11th place, and he scored no World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

<text>A [[gourmand]] is a person who takes great pleasure and interest in consuming particularly good food and drink. &quot;Gourmand&quot; originally referred to a person who was &quot;a glutton for food and drink&quot;, a person who eats and drinks excessively. 

==Etymology==
Gourmand was derived from a French word that has different connotations from the similar word gourmet, which emphasizes an individual with a , discerning palate and is more often applied to the preparer than the consumer of the food. But in practice, the two terms are closely linked, as both imply the enjoyment of good food. In his book &quot;Alamanach de las Gourmands&quot;, Grimod De la Reynière wrote that a gourmand is not only a person endowed with an excellent stomach and strong appetite, but also adds to these advantages a delight taste. Reynière concluded that the first principle lies in a single delicate palate, matured with a long experience. The French Academy dictionary suggested that the term &#x27;gourmand&#x27; was a synonym of &#x27;glutton&#x27; or &#x27;greedy&#x27;.
An alternative and older usage of the word is to describe a person given to excess in the consumption of food and drink, as a glutton or a trencherman.

Regarding the latter usage of the term, there is a parallel concern among the French people that their word for the appreciation of gourmet cuisine is historically included in the French Catholic list of the seven deadly sins. With the evolution in the meaning of (and ) away from gluttony and towards the connoisseur appreciation of good food, French culinary proponents are advocating that the Catholic Church update said list to refer to rather than . 

Another alternative use has gained popularity among perfume and cologne designers. In this field, &quot;gourmand&quot; refers not to a person but to a category of scents related to foods, such as cocoa, apple, and plum.

<text>George Francis &quot;Pat&quot; Flaherty (January 6, 1926 – April 9, 2002) was an American racing driver who won the Indianapolis 500 in 1956.

== Driving career ==

=== Early career ===

Flaherty began racing track roadsters in 1946, and in 1948 relocated to the Midwest to compete in Andy Granatelli&#x27;s Hurricane Hot Rod Association.

=== Championship car career ===

Flaherty drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1950, 1953–1956, 1958–1959, and 1963 seasons with 19 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 races in 1950, 1953, 1955, 1956, and 1959. He finished in the top ten 9 times, with victories in 1955 and 1956 at Milwaukee as well as the 1956 Indianapolis 500. Born in Glendale, California, Flaherty died in Oxnard, California.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship points and participation in addition to those which they received towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Flaherty participated in five World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He started on the pole once, won once, and accumulated eight World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Injury and later life ==

After winning the 1956 Indianapolis 500, Flaherty was severely injured in a race car crash less than three months later, which prevented him from racing at the 1957 500. Flaherty successfully raced pigeons for over twenty years after he retired from auto racing. He also built and publicised a portable go-kart track where he would race against all-comers.

== Awards and honors ==

Flaherty has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (2006)

<text>Patrick James O&#x27;Connor (October 9, 1928 – May 30, 1958) was an American racecar driver. He was killed in a 15-car pileup, after sustaining a fatal head injury after rolling his car and catching fire on the first lap of the 1958 Indianapolis 500.

==Champ Car==
O&#x27;Connor competed in 36 races in his champ car career. He took his first win in 1956 at Darlington Raceway. In 1957, he won the pole position for the Indianapolis 500 and he finished eighth. Later in the year, he won at Trenton Speedway.

He was on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in May 1958 (one week before the race), adding to the legend of the Sports Illustrated Cover Jinx.

==Death==

For the 1958 Indianapolis 500, Dick Rathmann and Ed Elisian started the race on the front row, with Jimmy Reece on the outside of the front row. Elisian spun in turn 3 of the first lap and collided with Rathmann&#x27;s car, sending them both into the wall, and starting a 15-car pileup.

According to A. J. Foyt, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s car hit Reece&#x27;s car, sailed fifty feet in the air, landed upside down, and burst into flames. Although O&#x27;Connor was incinerated in the accident, medical officials said that he was probably killed instantly from a fractured skull. In an interview after the race, winner Jimmy Bryan was quoted for saying &quot;It was a nightmare. I lived with it for 200 laps.&quot;

Widely blamed for the accident, Elisian was suspended by USAC for the accident (reinstated a few days later), and was shunned by many in the racing community.

Following the accident, race officials announced that they would change the starting procedure, abandoning the single-file trip down pit lane that was used in 1957 and 1958. Also, for the 1959 Indy 500, metal roll bars welded to the frame behind the driver&#x27;s head were mandated, and helmets were required to pass safety certification by Speedway medical officials.

==Awards==
He was inducted in the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1995.

==Legacy==
Salem Speedway honored him along with Joe James with an annual title event. The 2020 event was part of the USAC Silvercrown series.

<doc id="1252144" wikidata="Q1141263" url="?curid=1252144" title="Breechblock">
<text>A breechblock (or breech block) is the part of the firearm action that closes the breech of a breech loading weapon (whether small arms or artillery) before or at the moment of firing. It seals the breech and contains the pressure generated by the ignited propellant. Retracting the breechblock allows the chamber to be loaded with a cartridge.

Breechblocks are categorised by the type or design of the mechanism by which it is locked or closed for firing. The firearm action more fully refers to the mechanism by which the operator actuates the opening and closing of the breech.

==Variants==
A way of closing the breech or chamber is an essential part of any breech-loading weapon or firearm. Perhaps the simplest way of achieving this is a break-action, in which the barrel, forestock and breech pivot on a hinge that joins the front assembly to the rear of the firearm, incorporating the rear of the breech, the butt and usually, the trigger mechanism. A breechblock is a separate component and is not a feature of the break-action. A breechblock must close against the rear of the breech for firing but be able to be retracted or otherwise moved for loading or unloading or to remove a spent cartridge.

A breechblock is not a component of designs with multiple or moveable chambers such as revolvers, harmonica guns, Kalthoff repeaters, Kammerlader rifles or, split breech designs.

This article primarily addresses the matter of breechblock design, as opposed to the action, which relates more with how the mechanism is operated, even if the distinction is not always clear.

=== Rotating bolt ===
Usually referred to as a bolt rather than a breechblock, a rotating bolt is perhaps the most common variant. It is so called, because its operation is similar to a pad bolt or barrel bolt. The bolt slides in the receiver along the axis of the barrel and is rotated in the same axis to lock or unlock it against a closed breech. It is the basis for the bolt action, in which the bolt is rotated and retracted by a handle attached to the bolt. In some designs, the handle (sometimes called a cocking handle) rotates to lock against a shoulder in the receiver or body of the firearm. This type of locking is usually reserved for low-pressure applications such as the .22 cal rimfire series. More often, the bolt locks closed with two or more lugs that operate like a bayonet mount. Multiple lugs permit a smaller degree of rotation to lock and unlock the breech. Most types are front-locking and have the lugs mounted near the breech face. A notable exception is the rear-locking system used in the Lee–Enfield.

Rotating bolts can be adapted to automatic or semi-automatic designs and lever or pump actions. In these cases, the bolt is held by a bolt carrier. With the breech locked, an initial rearward movement of the bolt carrier causes the bolt to rotate and unlock. Similarly, when closing the breech, the final forward movement of the carrier causes the bolt to rotate and lock the breech. This action is commonly achieved by a slot cut in the carrier that engages a pin through the bolt perpendicular to the axis of the barrel. It is a type of linear cam.

Straight-pull bolt-action firearms do not require the operator to rotate the cocking handle to cycle the action. Some straight-pull designs may use a rotating bolt but other breech-locking mechanisms can be employed.

=== Sliding block ===
The breechblock in a sliding block slides across the face of the breech to close it. The sliding action is perpendicular to the axis of the barrel. When the breechblock slides down to expose the breech, it is referred to as a falling-block, as used in the Sharps rifle. A sliding block is common in artillery. A vertical sliding block rises and falls while a horizontal sliding block slides to one side. It is a strong design. The breechblock is well supported by the receiver within which it slides and the mechanisms for opening and closing the breech do not have to act to any extent against the forces generated on firing.

=== Side-hinged breechblock ===

A side hinged breechblock is used in the Snider-Enfield. Other firearms using this type of breechblock include the Warner carbine, the Joslyn rifle and the Tarpley carbine. The breechblock is hinged parallel to the axis of the barrel and swings away to the side to expose the breech. Firing force is contained by the rear of the breechblock bearing on the receiver.

===Rotating drum===

A rotating drum breechblock or rotary breech consists of a cylinder which rotates on an axis offset from the barrel. It is also known as a cannon breech because of association with some cannon designs. A longitudinal cut-out section or eccentric hole provides access to the breech. Rotating the cylinder then closes the breech. The geometry is not unlike the cylinder of a revolver. In the M1867 Werndl–Holub, the cylindrical breechblock is retained at the rear by the receiver. Mating faces can be profiled (i.e. not faced perpendicular to the axis of rotation) so that the breech tends to seal or fit more closely as it is closed.

the Nordenfelt eccentric screw breech is a variation of this design. Instead of holding the breechblock between the breech at one end and the receiver at the other, in this design the breechblock is threaded around its circumference and is screwed into the breech until it meets the rear of the chamber. The breech is opened by rotating it a fraction of a full turn, until a hole through the breechblock aligns with the bore. The Magnum Research Lone Eagle pistol is a single-shot pistol chambered for rifle cartridges that also uses a rotating drum breechblock.

=== Trapdoor breechblock ===

Commonly associated with the Springfield rifle, the breechblock is hinged above the breech face and lifts up like a trapdoor to expose the breech. The breech is locked by a catch operating at the end of the breechblock furthest from the hinge. It is similar in principle to a break-action.

=== Rolling-block ===

A rolling-block can be described as a quadrant which is hinged below the breech. The quadrant rotates through approximately 90° to provide access to the breech or close the breech. In the closed position, a number of different devices can be used to lock the quadrant and prevent it from opening. In the Remington Rolling Block rifle most closely associated with this type of breechblock, the hammer also has a quadrant which cams behind the breechblock and locks it.
=== Peabody-Martini ===
Initially used in the Peabody rifle, it saw more widespread use in the Martini–Henry and the subsequent Martini–Enfield. It employs a breechblock with a rear hinged falling block design, in which the breech is opened by permitting the front of the breechblock to drop down while pivoting on its hinge. Firing force is transmitted through the knuckle of the hinge and does not act directly on the hinge pin. The breechblock design as has been called a falling or tilting block but omitting the role of the hinge can lead to ambiguities. It is also used in the Krag–Petersson rifle.

=== Tilting block ===
As a tilting breechblock closes on the breech, it is tilted up at the rear but it drops into a recess at the end of its forward travel - thus locking the breech closed. Firing forces are transmitted to the locking shoulder at the rear of the recess. To unlock the breech, a slide or carrier moving rearward uses a wedge or ramp-like arrangement acting on the sides of the breechblock to tilt it up at the rear and lift it clear of the locking shoulder. The breechblock is then pulled rearward by the slide or carrier to expose the breech. In the closed position. the slide or carrier can also help locate the breechblock in its locking recess. The carrier or slide can be operated by lever or pump actions or by gas, for automatic and semiautomatic fire.

A tilting breechblock design is not confined to a tilt relative to the horizontal plane with the breechblock locking against the bottom part of the receiver (as described above). The FN Trombone uses a side locking design and the breechblock of the Bren gun locks against the top part of the receiver.

The M1895 Lee Navy is also of this type. The tilting action is achieved without a separate breechblock carrier but by the design of the cocking handle. When unlocking the breechblock, the cocking handle initially acts as a crank with a cam, which acts against the receiver to lift the rear of the bolt out of the locking recess. Further rearward pressure on the cocking handle then pulls the breechblock rearward.

=== In-line ===
The breech is opened by the breechblock moving in-line with the axis of the barrel and is locked in the closed position by an obstruction such as a cam, wedge, pawl or levers. A roller lock is commonly associated with firearms produced by Heckler &amp; Koch. This type of breechblock can be adapted to cycle by lever, cocking handle, gas or recoil. The mechanism is usually designed so that a single action unlocks and then withdraws the breechblock.

The Henry rifle and subsequent Winchester rifles use an arrangement of levers referred to as a toggle, similar in operation to locking pliers. The breechblock is held closed when the two levers forming the toggle are in-line.

The Mannlicher M1886 rifle is locked with a single pawl on the underside of the bolt assembly. The cocking handle is separate from the bolt and acts much like a bolt carrier. When the cocking handle is pulled rearward, it first lifts the pawl before retracting the bolt rearward. This system was adapted to recoil operation by Bernhard Müller in his 1902 prototype pistol and has subsequently been used in other pistols such as the Walther P38.

Flapper locking (as used in the Degtyaryov machine gun) uses metal plates (pawls) on either side of the breechblock that &quot;flap out&quot; like barbs on an arrow and lock into recesses in the receiver. The flaps can be retracted parallel to the block for unlocking.

The straight-pull Heym SR 30 uses ball bearings for locking, similar to an air fitting connector. The Blaser R93, another straight-pull action, is similar. It has a locking collet that consists claw-like segments instead of ball bearings. The multiple claws provide a large contact area to distribute load. These are arranged radially around the axis of the bolt. They extend to lock the bolt by engaging with an annular groove in the barrel behind the chamber and are retracted to unlock the bolt.

=== Blowback ===
Blowback actions use an in-line breechblock in which the breech is never locked and is held closed by spring tension alone. The force of the discharge is contained by a combination of spring force and the mass of the breechblock. They are used in semiautomatic and automatic firearms using low-powered cartridges. It is common in semiautomatic rifles and pistol chambered for .22 cal rimfire cartridges and many submachine guns. A variation is blow forward operation, in which the breechblock is fixed and the barrel moves. Delayed blowback uses additional mechanical devices that retard or delay the rearward movement of the breechblock; however, the breechblock is not locked in place by such devices. It allows a lighter mechanism compared with simple blowback.

=== Floating actions ===
In most longarms, the barrel is firmly attached to the receiver and does not move relative to the receiver during operations. Most semiautomatic pistols firing the higher powered pistol cartridges use a locked-breech design. The action is manually cycled by moving the slide rearward. The slide contains the breechblock and is initially locked to the barrel so that the combined assembly move together. A short movement trips the mechanism to unlock the barrel from the slide assembly, allowing the breech to open. When fired, recoil results in the same action. In many instances, the barrel and breechblock remain in-line. In the Browning Hi-Power and Colt&#x27;s M1911 pistol, the barrel is tilted slightly to release it from interlocking ribs, so in this respect, it may be likened to a tilting breechblock, even though it is the barrel and not the breechblock that tilts.

This type of floating configuration and recoil operation is not confined to pistols and may be found in machine guns and auto-firing cannons.

=== Interrupted screw ===

Perhaps a variation on the rotating bolt, an interrupted screw provides greater strength than simple lugs while requiring only a partial rotation to release the breechblock. The Welin breechblock is such a design and is used on weapons with calibres from about and larger in diameter.

The Ross rifle Mk III is a straight-pull design that has multi-thread locking lugs.

=== Falling screwed breechblock ===
The Ferguson rifle used a tapered screw plug inserted perpendicular to the axis of the barrel. It was charged with ball and powder and required only one rotation to permit loading. While novel and effective, cost was a factor for its limited acceptance.

<text>Ray Crawford (October 26, 1915 – February 1, 1996) was an American fighter ace, test pilot, race-car driver and businessman.

==Biography==

Born in Roswell, New Mexico, Crawford served as a U.S. Army Air Corps fighter pilot and flew the P-38 Lightning in combat over North Africa in 1943. He was tied as the top-ranking fighter ace of the 97th Fighter Squadron with six enemy aircraft confirmed destroyed and one probably destroyed. Rotated home, he eventually became an early jet pilot. At war&#x27;s end Crawford was evaluating the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star at Burbank, California and was to have flown the very aircraft that fighter ace Richard Bong was eventually killed in. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with fourteen Oak Leaf Clusters before separating from active duty as a Captain in February, 1946. Crawford remained in the Air Force Reserves until April 1953.
Crawford was introduced to racing by Sam Hanks, a former high school classmate, and competed notably with unlimited hydroplanes and automobiles. He drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1954-59 seasons with 9 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 races in 1955-56, and 1959. In 1954, he won the stock-car class of the Carrera Panamericana (a nine-stage, five-day race across Mexico) in a Lincoln. He also finished 7th and 4th in the invitational &quot;Race of Two Worlds&quot; events held at Monza Autodrome, Italy in 1957 and 1958, respectively.

In 1955, Crawford drove a Lincoln-Kurtis sports car at the 12 Hours of Sebring and finished the race in thirteenth position after running the entire length without a co-driver. To date, he is the only driver to have completed the race without relief of any kind.

Crawford&#x27;s family owned a successful supermarket chain based in El Monte, California which led to his nickname, &quot;The Flying Grocer.&quot; Crawford was one of the first owner-drivers of the post-war era at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and raced his own privately funded cars throughout his career. The only exception came in 1956, when Crawford raced the 12 Hours of Sebring for Chevrolet&#x27;s inaugural Corvette team. He was also the driver of Corvette&#x27;s experimental SR-2 at the Bahamas Speedweeks event that December. Cars owned by Crawford also qualified for the Indianapolis 500 with other drivers in 1953, 1954 and 1962.

Serious injuries received during a crash at the 1959 Indianapolis 500 curtailed Crawford&#x27;s driving career.

Speed legend Mickey Thompson cites Crawford as an early influence in his autobiography, &quot;Challenger&quot;. Crawford provided Thompson with his first exposure to the Indianapolis 500 as a member of his pit crew.

Crawford died in Los Angeles, California on February 1, 1996 after battling Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and is buried at Riverside National Cemetery, Riverside California. He is the subject of a 2015 biography by Andrew Layton titled &quot;Ray Crawford - Speed Merchant&quot;. Dick Wallen, a noted auto racing photographer and publisher, also contributed to the book.

<text>Samuel Dwight Hanks (July 13, 1914 – June 27, 1994) was an American racing driver who won the 1957 Indianapolis 500. He was a barnstormer, and raced midget and Championship cars.

== Racing career ==

Hanks was born in Columbus, Ohio and lived in Alhambra, California from the age of six. He attended Alhambra High School.

Hanks won his first championship in 1937 on the West Coast in the American Midget Association (AMA). He barnstormed the country, racing on the board tracks at Soldier Field in Chicago. Hanks reportedly won the first two board track races at Soldier Field in 1939. He won the 1940 VFW Motor City Speedway championship in Detroit. During the Second World War, Hanks served in the Army Air Corps.

After World War II, Hanks captured the 1946 United Racing Association (URA) Blue Circuit Championship. He won the 1947 Night before the 500 midget car race. He was the 1949 AAA National Midget champion. He won the 1953 AAA National Championship in the &quot;Bardahl Special&quot;. He won the 1956 Pacific Coast championship in the USAC Stock cars.

Hanks considered retiring following the 1956 Indianapolis 500, but agreed to return for the 1957 race at the urging of car owner George Salih. 1957 was his 13th appearance in the 500, although in 1941, he merely was credited with finishing 33rd despite not racing, he had been injured in a practice crash the day before the race and withdrew. In his twelfth race where he raced on the track, he finally won, setting a record for the most tries before becoming a winner at Indy and announced his retirement from racing in Victory Circle (Tony Kanaan would win his first Indy in his 12th Indy 500 appearance in 2013). He did not stop racing immediately following his victory, however, but completed his contract to run a stock car for the remainder of the 1957 season.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Hanks participated in eight World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He won once, and finished in the top three four times. He scored 20 World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Television appearance ==

Hanks portrayed himself in the episode &quot;The Comedians&quot; of the CBS situation comedy &quot;Mr. Adams and Eve&quot;, starring Ida Lupino and Howard Duff. The episode aired on November 8, 1957.

== Later life ==

He drove the pace car at the Indianapolis 500 from 1958 to 1963.

Hanks is believed to be the only Indianapolis 500 driver to participate in the race before World War II, serve in the war effort, then return to race again after the war. It has also been conjectured that Hanks may have been a distant relative to Abraham Lincoln.

Having experienced ill health for three years, Hanks died at his home in Pacific Palisades, California on June 27, 1994, aged 79.

== Awards and honors ==

Hanks has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1981)
* National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1984)

<doc id="1252151" wikidata="Q172636" url="?curid=1252151" title="Travis Webb">
<text>Travis Leon &quot;Spider&quot; Webb (October 8, 1910 – January 27, 1990) was an American racing driver. He was the 1948 American Automobile Association (AAA) Midwest Sprint Car champion. He raced in numerous AAA Championship Car races including six Indianapolis 500s.

Known as &quot;Spider&quot;, Webb transported a portable bar in the trunk of his car at all times and was known for his free spirit and his humor.

== Early life ==

Webb was born in Joplin, Missouri. His father made cabinets. Webb&#x27;s parents moved the family to Los Angeles, California in 1923.

== Racing career ==

Webb began racing on the Muroc Dry Lake (now known as Rogers Dry Lake) in 1928. His car owner gave him the nickname &quot;Spider&quot;.

Webb decided to stop racing on the long straightaways and decided to focus on dirt oval racing of Southern California. One of the tracks that he raced was Legion Ascot Speedway where he raced in the &quot;B&quot; class.

=== Sprint car career ===

In 1936, Webb and Jimmy Wilburn were offered rides in &quot;Big Cars&quot; in the Central States Racing Association (CSRA). Both accepted and moved to Indianapolis. Webb won the final CSRA race of the 1938 season at Winchester Speedway. Webb switched from the CSRA to the American Automobile Association (AAA) Midwest series in 1941 and finished fourth in the season points.

Racing was halted during World War II. In late 1947, Webb won three straight AAA Midwest races at Dayton Speedway, Salem Speedway, and Winchester. He won another race at Salem and finished second in 1947 AAA Midwest points to Johnny Shackleford. Webb started the 1948 season by winning seven times and finishing second in the first eight races. He missed a few races that season while running a Champ Car but still won the AAA Midwest championship. Webb started the 1949 season with a new sprint car that he co-owned; by June he had moved back to a car owned by Johnny Vance. He had a second-place finish at Michigan State Fairgrounds Speedway in Detroit and a third at the Syracuse Mile; he finished third in the final AAA Midwest points.

Webb finished fifth in the 1950 AAA Midwest points. After the racing season was over, he had a thumb injury at his friend&#x27;s shop and had to sit out the entire 1951 season.

=== Championship car career ===

In 1939, Webb made a one-off American Automobile Association (AAA) Champ Car start at the Milwaukee Mile; he started last in the 17 car field and finished seventh. Webb made two Champ Car starts in 1946; he finished tenth at the Indiana State Fairgrounds and eighth at Milwaukee. Webb was offered a ride from Mutt Anderson into the 1948 Indianapolis 500 but did not qualify. At the last minute, he was offered another ride and qualified the Bromme dirt champ car 30th. His race ended early after an oil line failure; he finished 27th after completing 27 of 200 laps. Webb qualified 26th for the 1949 Indianapolis 500 but finished last (33rd) after he transmission broke before he could complete one lap. He switched to a car owned by Charles Bowes starting with the ninth race of the 1949 season after Mel Hansen was unable to race. Webb started on the pole position for Syracuse race before finishing third. He finished second at Detroit and eighth at Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack (Springfield Mile).

Webb finished the 1950 Indianapolis 500 in 20th place after the race was shorted due to rain on lap 138. He did not qualify for four races and finished 18th in his only other Champ Car race at Springfield. Webb got bumped out of the field for the 1952 Indianapolis 500 but made the field in a last-minute qualifying attempt for Bromme. He finished 22nd after having to retire with an oil leak late in the race. In the 1953 Indianapolis 500, he started 29th and finished 22nd. He did not qualify for five events and finished 15th in the event that he did qualify (Springfield). Bromme called Webb in another last-minute deal for the 1954 Indianapolis 500; he qualified 29th and finishing 30th. Webb failed to qualify for the 1955 Indianapolis 500.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Webb participated in four World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. His best finish was 19th place, and he scored no World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Post racing career ==

After retiring from racing, Webb moved to Norwalk, California. He purchased earthmoving equipment and worked on the Los Angeles Zoo construction. He died at the age of 79 in McMinnville, Oregon.

== Awards and honors ==

* Webb was inducted in the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1997.

<text>Walter Charles Brown (December 30, 1910 – July 29, 1951) was an American racing driver. An Indy car specialist, his career in the big cars began in 1941, and he recorded one win, in 1948 at Langhorne Speedway.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ==

<text>Wayne Alois Weiler (December 9, 1934 in Phoenix, Arizona – October 13, 2005 in Phoenix, Arizona) was an American racecar driver.

Weiler started as a dirt track driver in Arizona in 1951. He drove in the USAC Championship Car series from 1958 to 1961 with 19 starts. He finished in the top ten 10 times, with his best finish in 3rd position, in 1960 at Phoenix.

Weiler competed in the Indianapolis 500 race in 1960 and 1961, with a best finish of 15th in 1961.

Weiler suffered a severe accident in a USAC sprint car race in Terre Haute, Indiana on June 11, 1961. Despite many erroneous reports stating the accident ended his career, he returned to race, just not nationally or in USAC any longer. He raced primarily in Arizona and in midgets, from the late 1960s through 1973. He remained active as an owner and manager in auto racing up until his death.

Weiler died at age 70 from a heart attack.

<doc id="1252158" wikidata="Q1852755" url="?curid=1252158" title="Trichiasis">
<text>Trichiasis ( , ) is a medical term for abnormally positioned eyelashes that grow back toward the eye, touching the cornea or conjunctiva. This can be caused by infection, inflammation, autoimmune conditions, congenital defects, eyelid agenesis and trauma such as burns or eyelid injury.

Standard treatment involves removal or destruction of the affected eyelashes with electrology, specialized laser, or surgery. In many cases, removal of the affected eyelashes with forceps resolves the symptoms, although the problem often recurs in a few weeks when the eyelashes regrow. Severe cases may cause scarring of the cornea and lead to vision loss if untreated. Mild cases may not require treatment.

Repeated cases of trachoma infection may cause trichiasis.

Posterior misdirection of normal lashes most frequently affects the lower lid.

==In dogs==
Trichiasis in dogs is hair from the eyelid growing in the wrong direction and rubbing on the eye, causing irritation. It usually occurs at the lateral upper eyelid, especially in the English Cocker Spaniel. Trichiasis also refers to hair from a nasal fold rubbing on the eye. This type of trichiasis can be flattened by rubbing petroleum jelly onto it, but surgery is sometimes necessary for permanent correction.

==Complications==
* Inferior punctate epitheliopathy
* Corneal ulceration 
*Pannus

==See also==
*Distichiasis
*Madarosis

<doc id="1252163" wikidata="Q7447645" url="?curid=1252163" title="Select Committee on Reserves (Reserve 43131) Bill 2003">
<text>The Select Committee on Reserves (Reserve 43131) Bill 2003 is an Australian select committee that investigated the eviction of the Swan Valley Nyungah Community (SVNC) from their traditional land through the use of the Reserves (Reserve 43131) Bill 2003. It investigated the motives of the Western Australian Gallop government in proposing and passing the bill.

==Background==
The Nyungah Aboriginal peoples have made attempts to reclaim their traditional land since 1919 when the Guildford Aboriginals were transhipped to the Moore River native settlement. Robert Bropho, an Aboriginal elder, and his extended family campaigned vigorously for the right to occupy the area which presently takes in Reserve 43131. The SVNC was established in 1977 and under the &quot;Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972&quot; they were given control of the reserve.

On 12 February 1999 a 15-year-old Aboriginal woman named Susan Taylor committed suicide in the reserve and on 22–30 October 2001 a coronial inquiry was held. The inquest investigated the circumstances in which Taylor and other Aboriginal young people lived. It accepted evidence that rape and sexual abuse of Aboriginal minors was widespread in Western Australia, that sexually transmitted diseases were higher than with non-Aboriginal children, that Aboriginal mortality rates are many times higher than that of the non-Aboriginal community, and that drug taking with Aboriginal people was a major problem. The Coroner also heard evidence &quot;regarding alleged sexual abuse taking place in locations near the Reserve by Caucasian males providing paint or glue to young people for sexual favours. Allegations were also made against Bropho of sexual misconduct, involving Taylor and her mother Lena Spratt. An allegation of indecent assault made by Taylor against Bropho&#x27;s son, Richard Bropho, was not pursued due to her death and a lack of corroborating evidence. Robert and Richard Bropho have strenuously denied these allegations.&quot; (2.28, page 57, &quot;Select Committee&quot;) The coroner found that government departments should not be restricted from Aboriginal reserves due to the alleged situation of abuse in Aboriginal communities. Allegations were also made that Robert Bropho had stopped the Aboriginal Medical Service from visiting the reserve due to the death of an infant, and in 1996 had also stopped the Department of Family and Children&#x27;s Services after a child had disclosed inappropriate touching by older boys.

===Gordon Inquiry===
In the aftermath of the coronial inquiry, the Western Australian government established an inquiry entitled &quot;Inquiry into Response by Government Agencies to Complaints of Family Violence and Child Abuse in Aboriginal Communities&quot;, or better known as the &quot;Gordon Inquiry&quot; after the chairwoman, Family Court Magistrate Sue Gordon. It was announced on 29 November 2001 by the Premier of Western Australia, Geoff Gallop. Its terms of reference were to examine the way that &quot;Government agencies dealt with issues of violence and child sexual abuse at the Swan Valley Nyoongar community&quot;, to examine &quot;how State Government agencies respond to evidence of family violence and child sexual abuse that may be occurring in Aboriginal communities generally&quot;, and to give &quot;recommendations on practical solutions for addressing incidents of sexual abuse in Aboriginal communities, including any necessary legislative and administrative measures&quot;.

Published on 31 July 2002 the &quot;Gordon Report&quot; made a number of recommendations in respect of the Swan Valley Nyungah Community and government agencies.

==Findings==
The Report of the Upper House Select Committee on Reserves (Reserve 43131) Bill 2003 found that Gallop&#x27;s decision &quot;to act rapidly, by-passing all normal processes, was justified on false information&quot;. It also found that the Government &quot;was not in a position to accommodate former residents of the SVNC quickly&quot; and had &quot;significantly underestimated the number of families and individuals requiring assistance&quot;. The Select Committee made findings against the conduct of Premier Gallop&#x27;s media adviser Kieran Murphy, who promised an exclusive story to newspaper journalist Colleen Egan. The report concluded that this &quot;made Mr Murphy’s active participation in decision making all the more improper&quot;, &quot;In particular, Mr Murphy’s obligation to deliver to Ms Egan a dramatic and media-worthy response mitigated against a considered and measured resolution&quot;. The Select Committee also found against Sean Walsh, Premier Gallop&#x27;s Chief of Staff. The Report concluded that he had &quot;completely bypassed the convention that public servants should advise vigorously and honestly and governments should decide in the light of their advice&quot;. It suggested that Walsh&#x27;s conduct constituted a disciplinary offence under section 74 of the 1994 Public Sector Management Act.

The Select Committee also made findings against Richard Curry, Director General of the Department of Indigenous Affairs and Jane Brazier, Director General of the Department of Community Development, who &quot;gave responses to the Premier based on incorrect, misleading and unsubstantiated anecdotal evidence&quot; and did not test &quot;the veracity of information given to them or their departments in areas that they should have known to be a government priority&quot;. Curry and Brazier had &quot;no proper basis for providing advice to the Premier&quot; as their departments were &quot;inactive in regard to the Lord Street Camp&quot;. The Directors General &quot;hadn&#x27;t checked what their departments were doing before making their decision&quot;.

Magistrate Sue Gordon, who was interviewed by the Select Committee and said: &quot;I would not single out the Swan Valley Nyungah Community. That was just in the media the most because of Mr Bropho and the allegations against him. There are allegations against a lot of other so-called leaders but they do not get as much publicity&quot;. Gordon, who said the Swan Valley Nyungah Community was &quot;an adequate and reasonably well maintained facility&quot; also said &quot;I do not think there are any similarities whatsoever between a management order and a memorandum of understanding&quot;.

<text>Apicophilicity is the phenomenon in which electronegative substituents of trigonal bipyramidal pentacoordinate compounds prefer to occupy apical (axial) positions (Lap).

The term &quot;apicophilicity&quot; was first proposed by Earl L. Muetterties in 1963 for the structural analysis of pentacoordinate phosphorus fluorides by 19F NMR. Since the apical bonding of a pentacoordinate typical (group 1, 2, 13-18) element compound consists of a 3-center-4-electron bond, in which the electron density is localized on two apical substituents, an arrangement in which electronegative substituents occupy apical positions is more stable.

The apicophilicity of a substituent is defined as the difference in energy between two isomeric structures in which the substituent occupies an apical position and an equatorial position (Leq). Experimentally, instead of direct measurement of the energy difference, which is usually difficult to measure, the relative energy barriers for pseudorotation of isomers are used for determination of the apicophilicity scale. Some experimental and theoretical studies have been made to measure relative apicophilicities for various substituents.

The apicophilicity of a substituent mainly depends on its electronegativity, but some other factors can also have an effect. A bulky substituent prefers equatorial positions, which are more distant from other substituents. A substituent with π-bonding ability also prefers equatorial positions. The use of multidentate ligands can also control the arrangement of substituents. For example, a bidentate ligand with a five-membered ring structure greatly stabilizes the arrangement in which their two coordination sites occupy equatorial and an apical position.

<text>Gary Chalk (born 1952) is an English illustrator and model-maker.

==Biography==
A native of rural Hertfordshire, Chalk began playing wargames at the age of fifteen. He took a BA in design and worked as a teacher of art and design before going freelance.

Chalk is perhaps best known for his contributions to the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; series of gamebooks written by Joe Dever. In addition to &quot;Lone Wolf&quot;, Gary has been involved in the artwork for a number of other notable games and books. These include the board game &quot;Talisman&quot;, and the first six volumes of the &quot;Redwall&quot; series of children&#x27;s books. He has also drawn maps for the entire selection of &quot;Warriors&quot; books by Erin Hunter.

Chalk and Ian Bailey created the game &quot;Fantasy Warlord&quot; (1990) to attempt to compete with Games Workshop&#x27;s &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot;.

In 2009–2010, Chalk illustrated Allan Frewin Jones&#x27; &quot;Sundered Lands&quot; books. He is also illustrating with original artworks the French edition of Mongoose Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; RPG. Chalk was one of the illustrators of &quot;The Secret History of Giants&quot; (2008), by Ari Berk.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 406 (pronounced &quot;four-oh-six&quot;), commonly referred to as Highway 406, is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The primary north–south route through the central portion of the Niagara Peninsula, Highway 406 connects Welland, Thorold and downtown St. Catharines to the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW).

Construction of Highway 406 began in 1963. The first section opened between St. Davids Road and Geneva Street on December 7, 1965, followed by a southward extension to Beaverdams Road in late 1969. The route was later extended south as a super two to Merritt Road where it became Highway 58. In 1977, construction began to connect the freeway with the QEW; this was completed in late 1984. Construction resumed in 1987 to extend Highway 406 further south to Welland, albeit as a super two, where it ended at a signalized intersection at East Main Street and this was completed in 1995.
In 2009 construction resumed on the highway to expand the remaining two-lane sections to a four-lane divided freeway, with the existing route becoming the southbound lanes of the new freeway. The southern terminus in Welland was converted to a roundabout while the remaining at-grade intersections were rebuilt as interchanges. 

== Route description ==
From 1987 until 2015, Highway 406 was unique as the only 400-series highway with two lane sections and with an at-grade rail crossing. The highway is heavily travelled within St. Catharines, but volumes drop considerably south of the city. Since late 2024, the speed limit on Highway 406 varies from to , with being on the stretch between Thorold and Welland. The highway is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police.

The 406 designation begins at East Main Street in Welland at a roundabout immediately west of East Main Street Tunnel beneath the Welland Canal. From here the now-four-lane divided road veers northeast and travels parallel to the canal. Two golf courses separate the canal. As the highway passes to the west of them, it jogs to the west and crosses a Trillium Railway spur (formerly at-grade, now over the railway), and meets Daimler Parkway and Woodlawn Road at a newly constructed interchange. Soon after, it crosses the Welland River and then the former channel of the canal, which was replaced by the current Welland By-Pass in the 1970s.

The highway curves to the northwest as it passes through thick forest, and meets another newly built interchange with Merritt Road (formerly Highway 58), which as of 2009 was being rebuilt as a grade-separated interchange.
After this, it returns to its northward orientation and passes the final former at-grade intersection, Niagara Regional Road 63 (Port Robinson Road).
North of Port Robinson Road, the forests break and the freeway continues straight north for through a mostly agricultural area. Along the straightaway are interchanges with former Highway 20 and Niagara Regional Road 67 (Beaverdams Road). The freeway crosses over Lake Gibson, and curves to the northeast. It passes beneath Niagara Regional Road 71 (St. Davids Road) and Highway 58 at a complicated interchange as it descends the Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, and enters St. Catharines.
Within St. Catharines, Highway 406 twists frequently, entering the Twelve Mile Creek valley south of a complicated interchange with Westchester Avenue and Geneva Street and curving west. Within the valley, the freeway features a lower design speed and reduced speed limit of .
It passes beneath the high-level St. Paul Street bridge, crosses the creek and intersects Fourth Avenue. Exiting the creek valley, the freeway parallels Fourth Avenue for a , gradually curves to the north and ends to the north, ending at a trumpet interchange with the QEW.

== History ==
Planning for Highway 406 began in early 1959, when Minister of Highways Fred M. Cass presented the &quot;Ontario Roads and Streets&quot; report to the Ontario Legislative Assembly on March 16, outlining highways needs for the province over 20 years. One of the planned routes was a freeway to link Highway 3 in Port Colborne with the QEW, travelling alongside the Welland Canal. By 1961, route studies and planning were well underway.
The future route was designated as Highway 406 despite construction not beginning until 1963;
the first section, between Geneva Street and St. Davids Road, opened December 7, 1965. This was followed several years later by an extension south to Beaverdams Road, which opened November 21, 1969.
During the early 1970s, the highway was extended south as a Super 2 to north of the Welland River, where it curved west along Merritt Road and became Highway 58.
This extension, which included the Beaverdams Road interchange and a signalized intersection, was opened on June 30, 1971.

In 1977, construction began on the section of Highway 406 between Geneva Street and the QEW.
This work included the construction of several large bridges over the widened ravine, a curving structure over Twelve Mile Creek, and the first single-point urban interchange (SPUI) in Ontario (the only other SPUI is located on Airport Parkway in Ottawa). The original design plans for Highway 406 called for this section to follow the creek valley the full distance to the QEW, interchanging with it east of Martindale Road. Instead, the alignment was moved west of the city. Realignments to several streets in St. Catharines were completed in advance of construction on overpasses, ramps and the bridges over Twelve Mile Creek; this work was finished in late 1983.
Grading contracts were awarded in mid-1983 for the entire extension. Paving took place during the summer of 1984, and the route was opened to traffic in October 1984.

Further work to extend Highway 406 as a Super two south towards East Main Street in Welland began during the fall of 1987, including an eastward extension of Woodlawn Road. Construction of the bridges that carry the extension over the Welland River and old canal began in mid-1988, and was completed during the fall of 1989. Work then began to grade and pave the Woodlawn Road Extension to Highway 406, which intersected with traffic signals. Grading and paving of Highway 406 also took place from Woodlawn Road to the route&#x27;s southern terminus at East Main Street, which was also a signalized intersection. The extension was completed by the mid-1990s.
=== Expansion ===
Highway 406 was the last 400-series highway that featured at-grade intersections and two lane sections.
The original intention was to twin this two-lane section shortly after it was constructed in the 1970s. Plans were deferred multiple times, until the project resumed in the early 2000s.
The first phase of this twinning opened to traffic in 2007, extending the four-lane highway from its previous convergence south of Beaverdams Road to a point north of Port Robinson Road.

On May 15 2009, Minister of Transportation Jim Bradley announced that the section from Port Robinson road to East Main Street in Welland would be converted to a full freeway;
this work included a roundabout at East Main Street to replace the existing signalized intersection.
Work on the Merritt Road overpass began in September 2009, and was scheduled for completion in mid-2011.
On August 19, 2011, full construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony.
The roundabout with East Main Street opened to traffic on September 5, 2013, featuring no central island. The existing signalized junction at Woodlawn Road was repurposed for the southbound off-ramp and on-ramp, as continuous Highway 406 traffic was rerouted upon new overpasses. By September 2015, all the at-grade intersections had been removed and Highway 406 was a minimum four-lane, controlled-access freeway for its entire length.
Despite requests from local politicians, there are no plans to extend Highway 406 to Port Colborne at this time.

<text>Russell Lowell Maughan (March 28, 1893 – April 21, 1958) was an officer in the United States Army and a pioneer aviator. His career began during World War I, and spanned the period in which military aviation developed from a minor arm of the Army Signal Corps to the huge Army Air Forces on the verge of becoming a separate service.

Maughan became a pursuit pilot and served in combat in France in 1918 with the United States Army Air Service. Following the war, he remained in the Air Service and became a test pilot. In 1924 Maughan completed the first flight across the continental United States within the hours of daylight of a single calendar day.

==Biography==
Maughan was born March 28, 1893, in Logan, Utah, to Peter W. and Mary (née Naef) Maughan. He graduated from Utah State Agricultural College in June 1917.

The United States had entered World War I and Maughan enlisted as an Army aviation cadet. Commissioned a first lieutenant in the Signal Officer Reserve Corps after flight training and rated a Reserve Military Aviator, he served in France with the 139th Aero Squadron, where he flew a Spad XIII. Maughan was credited with four aerial victories and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on October 27, 1918, the citation for which is given below.

He remained in the Air Service following the end of the war and was assigned to its Engineering Division at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, as a test pilot. Besides testing new designs, his responsibilities including public demonstrations of military aircraft and participation in air races. The Engineering Division had drawn the interest of Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell, Assistant Chief of the Air Service, who saw in it the opportunity for promoting the concept of an Air Force independent of the Army. On July 1, 1920, when the Air Service became a combat arm of the Army, Maughan received a Regular commission as a 1st lieutenant, Air Service. He transferred to Crissy Field at the Presidio of San Francisco in 1921 and joined the 91st Observation Squadron, then engaged in aerial forest fire patrol.

In 1922 the National Air Races were held at Selfridge Field, Michigan, where the Air Service entered the Pulitzer Trophy Race with ten aircraft it had solicited from various manufacturers for use as possible pursuit planes, with specification that they be capable of reaching a speed of or greater. Flying a Curtiss R-6 racer, a precursor of the PW-8 design, Maughan won the Pulitzer race with an average speed of , on October 14, 1922. On October 16, flying the 1-kilometer course, he averaged for eight circuits, for four, and reached on one. This established a new international record, but it was not observed by Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) officials and was not officially recognized.
The following year Maughan officially set a new international speed record of . He also made two attempts in July to fly coast-to-coast in a single day, using the new Curtiss PW-8, but mechanical problems thwarted both flights. On June 23, 1924, his third attempt succeeded, the first Dawn-to-dusk transcontinental flight across the United States. The flight was made in six legs, with an actual flying time of 18 hours and 20 minutes, at an average ground speed of more than 156 mph. In 1928 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for the flight.

Maughan served in the Philippines from 1930 to 1935, with duty as Secretary of Aviation and Consultant to the Philippine Cabinet from 1930 to 1932. In 1939 he surveyed and selected airfields in Greenland and Iceland for aircraft ferry routes to Britain.

Maughan, promoted to lieutenant colonel, commanded the 60th Transport Group, Pope Field, North Carolina, from July 28, 1941, to April 15, 1942. Promoted again to colonel, he was advanced to command of the 51st Troop Carrier Wing from June 1, 1942, to October 20, 1942, which included its deployment to England.

Colonel Maughan retired in 1946, and died April 21, 1958, at San Antonio, Texas, during surgery. He is buried in the Logan City Cemetery near the Utah State University campus in Logan, Utah. He is a member of the Utah Aviation Hall of Fame and is honored with a plaque in the Hill Aerospace Museum, Hill Air Force Base, Utah. A plaque commemorating the first &quot;Dawn-to-dusk transcontinental flight across the United States was erected on the Utah State University campus in Logan, Utah, on Veteran&#x27;s Day, 2006.

:The Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Russell L. Maughan, First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action near Sommerance, France, October 27, 1918. Accompanied by two other planes, Lieutenant Maughan was patrolling our lines, when he saw slightly below him an enemy plane (Fokker type). When he started an attack upon it he was attacked from behind by four more of the enemy. By several well-directed shots he sent one of his opponents to the earth, and, although the forces of the enemy were again increased by seven planes, he so skillfully maneuvered that he was able to escape toward his lines. While returning he attacked and brought down an enemy plane which was diving on our trenches.

<doc id="1252202" wikidata="Q4855789" url="?curid=1252202" title="Banishment Act 1697">
<text>The Banishment Act 1697 or Bishops&#x27; Banishment Act 1697 (9 Will. 3. c. 1 (I)) was a 1697 act of the Parliament of Ireland which banished all ordinaries and regular clergy of the Roman Catholic Church from Ireland. By 1 May 1698 all &quot;popish archbishops, bishops, vicars general, deans, Jesuits, monks, friars, and other regular popish clergy&quot; had to be in one of several named ports awaiting a ship out of the country. Remaining or entering the country after this date would be punished as a first offence with 12 months&#x27; imprisonment followed by expulsion. A second offence constituted high treason.

The act was one of the Penal Laws passed after the Williamite War to safeguard the Church of Ireland as the established church and from fears of Catholic clerical support for Jacobitism. It was foreshadowed by proclamations issued by the Dublin Castle administration in 1673 and 1678 with similar terms. The banishment was originally and most effectively applied to regular clergy, many of whom registered (under the Registration Act 1704) as parish priests to be treated as secular clergy and avoid deportation. The ban on bishops may have been intended to prevent ordination of new priests, which, coupled with a ban on clerical immigration, would lead to their eventual extinction. Of the eight Catholic bishops in Ireland when the act was passed, two left, one (John Sleyne) was arrested, and five went into hiding. The port authorities paid for the passage of 424 clerics who emigrated; Mary of Modena estimated that about 700 in total left, of whom 400 settled in France. Priest hunters were active in subsequent decades. Maurice Donnellan, Bishop of Clonfert, was arrested in 1703 but rescued by an armed crowd.

==Amendment and repeal==
The act was gradually less stringently enforced as the eighteenth century progressed. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1782 provided that its provisions could not apply to a priest who had registered and taken the oath of supremacy. The act was explicitly repealed by the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1878.

<text>The Atlanta and St. Andrews Bay Railroad , also known as the Bay Line, was a Class I railroad which operated in Alabama and Florida. The company was founded in 1906 and opened its mainline between Dothan, Alabama, and Panama City, Florida, in 1908. Later reclassified as a short-line railroad, its assets were acquired by the Bay Line Railroad in 1994.

== History ==
As with many railroads in the region, the A&amp;SAB began in the minds of timber investors and land developers seeking to access the agricultural resources of the Florida Panhandle and South Alabama. Chief among them was A. B. Steele, who created the railroad to build south out of Dothan towards the Gulf Coast. The company incorporated on February 14, 1906, and opened its line between Dothan and Panama City on July 15, 1908. Panama City was incorporated the following year at the terminus of the line. Plans were soon made to extend the railroad north to Atlanta, however financial difficulties and pressure from the Central of Georgia railroad put an end to any plans for extension.
World War II brought about a considerable increase in traffic on the A&amp;SAB. Several military bases in the vicinity of Panama City ensured the Bay Line would remain a hotbed of activity for the duration of the war. Shortly after the war in 1947, the A&amp;SAB was granted Class I status. The company offered sleeper and coach passenger train service nightly between Panama City and Atlanta Union Station via Albany and Macon. The trains went over Central of Georgia Railway tracks from Dothan, Alabama, to Atlanta. At some point between 1955 and 1956 A&amp;StA terminated all passenger service --coach and sleeping car service.

TOFC service began in 1962 with the construction of ramps at Panama City and Cottondale. Additional expansion came with the construction of a branch line to Graceville in 1971. In 1979 International Paper sold the railroad to Southwest Forest Industries, and the railroad changed hands again with the sale of Southwest Forest Industries to the Stone Container Corporation in 1987.

In 1989, Stone Container Corporation purchased from CSX Transportation a branch line from Grimes to Abbeville, Alabama. The new railroad, the Abbeville-Grimes Railway Company, was operated by the A&amp;SAB. On January 1, 1994, the Rail Management Corporation acquired the assets of the railroad and created a new company, the Bay Line Railroad, to operate it.

===Graceville branch===
Construction of the branch spanning from Campbellton, Florida, to Graceville was completed on July 14, 1971. Graceville was located at the terminus of the Georgiana branch of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. This allowed for interchange between the two railroads and access to a Southwest Forest Industries woodchip mill located in Graceville that supplied the Panama City paper mill. In addition to the woodchip mill, Gold Kist operated a peanut mill in Graceville.

The Seaboard System Railroad, successor to the Louisville and Nashville, abandoned the line into Graceville on January 16, 1984. The A&amp;SAB purchased the small yard and wye track in Graceville from the vacating Seaboard and continued serving the city. Declining traffic prompted the abandonment of the branch by the mid 1990s.

===Abbeville branch===

Stone Container Corporation purchased the line between Grimes and Abbeville on March 1, 1989. The primary source of traffic is a woodchip mill near Abbeville, which provides woodchips for the Panama City paper mill. The Bay Line accessed the Abbeville &amp; Grimes branch via trackage rights with CSX between Grimes and Dothan. The Abbeville branch was included in the sale to the Bay Line Railroad. The A&amp;G was formally merged into the Bay Line on June 26, 1996.

<text>The Registration Act (2 Anne c. 7 (I); long title An Act for registering the Popish Clergy) was an act of the Parliament of Ireland passed in 1704, which required all &quot;Popish&quot; (Roman Catholic) priests to register at their local magistrates&#x27; court, to pay two 50-pound bonds to ensure good behavior, and to stay in the county where they registered.

The act was one of a series of Penal Laws passed after the Williamite War to protect the victorious Protestant Ascendancy from a church seen as loyal to the defeated Jacobites and to foreign powers. Its second section stated that if an Irish Catholic priest was to convert to the established Church of Ireland, he would receive a 20-pound stipend, levied on the residents of the area where he had last practised. Unregistered clergy were to depart Ireland before the 20 July 1704 and any remaining after 24 June 1705 would be deported. Any that returned would be punished as under the Banishment Act 1697 (as high treason). These were sought by freelance &quot;priest hunters&quot;.

==Amendment and repeal==
A 1704 act (4 Anne c. 2 (I)) amended the Registration Act, Banishment Act and Popery Act, to close a loophole whereby they had not applied to priests ordained after the original act first came into force. The 1704 act, originally set to expire after the 1708–09 session of Parliament, was made permanent in that session. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1782 provided that these acts&#x27; provisions could not apply to a priest who had registered and taken an oath of allegiance. Daniel O&#x27;Connell drafted a comprehensive Catholic Emancipation bill in the 1820s which would have repealed all these acts; in the event the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 was more limited and the acts were not formally repealed until the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1878.

<text>The Bern Switzerland Temple (formerly the Swiss Temple) is a temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) located in Münchenbuchsee, Switzerland. It was the church&#x27;s first temple in Europe and the second outside of North America, after the Laie Hawaii Temple. The intent to build the temple was announced on 1 July 1952, by church president David O. McKay.

The temple was designed by church architect Edward O. Anderson, and the plans were redrawn into German specifications by Wilhelm Zimmer. The temple’s architecture uses a modern-contemporary style. A groundbreaking ceremony, to signify the beginning of construction, was held on August 5, 1953. 

== History ==
There have been church members in Switzerland since the mid-19th century. The church&#x27;s first missionary entered Switzerland in 1850, with the encouragement of Lorenzo Snow of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who was attempting to establish a mission in Italy and surrounding countries. Snow visited Switzerland in February 1851 to dedicate the land for missionary work, and in March 1851 the first Swiss converts were baptized. As of October 2024, there are over 9,000 church members in Switzerland.

The lot was selected in by LDS Church president David O. McKay and Samuel E. Bringhurst, then president of the Swiss-Austrian Mission. The architects were Edward O. Anderson and Wilhelm Zimmer. Groundbreaking and dedication of the lot were performed by McKay on 5 August 1953, who later dedicated the temple on 11 September 1955. The temple was known as the &quot;Swiss Temple&quot; until the current naming convention for temples was adopted in the late 1990s.

The Bern Switzerland Temple has four ordinance rooms, seven sealing rooms, and a total floor area of . Its temple district includes stakes in France, Switzerland, and the district in Jerusalem, Israel.

Originally, presentation of the endowment was particularly challenging, since it was the first international temple, requiring many different languages for its patrons. This was solved by using a film, dubbed in all required languages. Gordon B. Hinckley, as a church employee, supervised the initial making of the film and was responsible for transporting it to Switzerland. The Los Angeles California Temple, which was dedicated in 1956, was the last one designed for live endowments; since then all new temples have been equipped with recordings instead of live presentations by temple workers. For several decades, only the Manti Utah and Salt Lake temples used live presentations, but the church announced in 2021 that both temples would convert to the use of a film after extensive remodeling.

In early 1990, the temple closed for renovations. After the complete renewal of the interior, the temple was rededicated by Hinckley, who was then a member of church&#x27;s First Presidency, on 23 October 1992. In connection with the fiftieth anniversary of its dedication, a statue of the angel Moroni was placed on top of the tower on 7 September 2005.

The temple is featured briefly in the Woodkid music videos for &quot;Iron&quot; and &quot;Run Boy Run&quot;. Though the building is located in Münchenbuchsee, its postal address is assigned to the neighboring municipality of Zollikofen.

In 2020, like all the church&#x27;s others, the Bern Switzerland Temple was closed for a time in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Design and architecture ==
The building has a modern-contemporary architectural style coupled with a traditional Latter-day Saint temple design. Designed by Edward O. Anderson and Wilhelm Zimmer, the architecture reflects both the cultural heritage of Bern and its spiritual significance to the church.

The temple is on a 7-acre plot, and surrounding landscaping of gardens, hedges, trees, and grass fields. 

The structure is 140 feet tall, and is constructed with reinforced concrete with gray terracotta trimmed in white. The exterior has a single spire with a statue of the angel Moroni on its top. 

The temple includes a baptistry, four ordinance rooms, and seven sealing rooms, each designed for ceremonial use. 

The design has elements representing Latter-day Saint symbolism, which provide deeper spiritual meaning to its appearance and function. Symbolism is important to church members. The temple itself is a symbol, being a “house of the Lord” and as a symbol of faith. This temple in particular is one of “...the Church’s most visible and oldest structural manifestations of growth and dedication.”

== Renovations ==
Over the years, the temple has undergone several renovations to preserve its structural integrity, update facilities, and enhance its spiritual and aesthetic appeal. The most significant renovation project commenced in 1990.

Renovations focused on key areas, including expanding and modernizing the temple. These changes ensure its compliance with contemporary building standards and accommodates the needs of church members.

One aspect of the renovation was the addition of more ordinance rooms; the pre-existing single 250-seat auditorium was replaced by four 70-seat ordinance rooms. This allowed a new endowment session to begin every half hour instead of every two hours. The renovated temple was rededicated in 10 sessions from October 23-25, 1992, by Gordon B. Hinckley.

== Temple presidents ==
The church&#x27;s temples are directed by a temple president and matron, each serving for a term of three years. The president and matron oversee the administration of temple operations and provide guidance and training for both temple patrons and staff.

Serving from 1955 to 1957, the first president was Samuel E. Bringhurst, with Lenora K. Bringhurst being the matron. As of 2024, Franz R. Gaag is the president, with Fabiola D. Gaag serving as matron.

== Admittance ==
Following completion of the temple, the church announced that the public open house that was held from September 9-10, 1955. The temple was dedicated by David O. McKay in 10 sessions from September 11-15, 1955. After the temple’s 1990-1992 renovation period, another open house was held, from October 8-17, 1992. During that open house, almost 33,000 people toured the temple. The temple was rededicated from October 23-25, 1992, by Gordon B. Hinckley in 10 sessions.

Like all the church&#x27;s temples, it is not used for Sunday worship services. To members of the church, temples are regarded as sacred houses of the Lord. Once dedicated, only church members with a current temple recommend can enter for worship.

<doc id="1252211" wikidata="Q7229265" url="?curid=1252211" title="Popery Act">
<text>An Act to prevent the further Growth of Popery (2 Anne c. 6 (I); commonly known as the Popery Act or the Gavelkind Act) was an act of the Parliament of Ireland that was passed in 1704 designed to suppress Roman Catholicism in Ireland (&quot;Popery&quot;). William Edward Hartpole Lecky called it the most notorious of the Irish Penal Laws.

Inheritance in traditional Irish law used gavelkind, whereby an estate was divided equally among a dead man&#x27;s sons. In contrast, English common law used male primogeniture, with the eldest son receiving the entire estate. The 1704 act enforced gavelkind for Catholics and primogeniture for Protestants.

==Enactment==
Two separate bills &quot;to prevent the further Growth of Popery&quot; were introduced in the parliamentary session 1703–1704. One originated with the Irish Privy Council and was referred on 4 July 1703 to the Attorney-General for Ireland; the other was introduced as heads of a bill in the Irish House of Commons on 28 September 1703 and sent to the Lord Lieutenant on 19 November. Under Poynings&#x27; Law, both bills were transmitted to the English Privy Council for approval. Formally, one bill was vetoed and the other was returned to Dublin with amendments; a lack of surviving documentation makes it impossible to determine which of the two had which fate. The approved bill was engrossed on 20 January, presented in the Commons on 14 February, sent to the Irish House of Lords on 25 February, and given royal assent on 4 March.

Sir Toby Butler, the former Solicitor General for Ireland, a Roman Catholic, made a celebrated speech at the bar of the Commons denouncing the act as being &quot;against the laws of God and man... against the rules of reason and justice&quot;. Other eminent Catholic lawyers like Stephen Rice also denounced the measure but to no avail.

==Provisions==

* Section 1 defined as praemunire the encouragement or act of apostasy from Protestantism to Catholicism. It also prohibited Catholics under 21 from going abroad without licence, to help enforce the Education Act 1695&#x27;s prohibition on Catholic education overseas.
* Section 2 empowered judges to summon children to court to prove they had not gone abroad without licence under section 1.
* Section 3 empowered the Irish Chancery to take property from a Catholic parent to pay for their Protestant child&#x27;s education. If the child was an eldest son, up to one-third of the parent&#x27;s property could be transferred to him, the parent retained only a life interest.
* Section 4 prohibited Catholics from being legal guardians of Protestant children
* Section 5 extended the existing prohibition on Protestants marrying Catholics to include marriages abroad.
* Section 6 prohibited Catholics from buying land or leasing it for more than 31 years.
* Section 7 gave a Catholic acquiring title to real property six months in which to enter into possession of it, failing which it descended to the nearest Protestant relative. 
* Section 8 was a proviso to section 7, whereby a nearer Catholic relative could pre-empt the Protestant relative by conforming to Protestantism within the six-month window
* Section 9 was a proviso to section 7, whereby the Protestant wife of a dispossessed Catholic remained entitled to her one-third dower.
* Section 10 mandated that inheritance from a Catholic would be by gavelkind, that is divided equally between all sons. If the deceased had no sons, the estate was likewise divided between his daughters, or the next closest kin.
* Section 11 was a proviso to section 10 to allow provision for daughters from the estate before the residue was subdivided among the sons. 
* Section 12 was a proviso to section 10 to allow the eldest son to inherit the whole estate (by primogeniture) if he was a Protestant, or converted within three months of his father&#x27;s death. Thus, the law had the effect of reducing the size and thus the influence of Roman Catholic landed estates, which was the act&#x27;s ulterior motive.
* Section 13 mandated that inheritance from a Protestant would according to common law, that is primogeniture.
* Section 14 provided that debts of Catholics be registered with the Court of Exchequer, to ensure they were paid out of the estate before the application of gavelkind
* Section 15 required a putative Protestant to prove their religion by taking specified oaths of supremacy, abjuration and allegiance
* Section 16 required that, by August 1704, any person with an existing civil or military office must subscribe at quarter sessions to the declarations specified by the English Security of the Succession, etc. Act 1702 which rejected transubstantiation, abjured the Papacy and the Jacobite succession, and gave allegiance to Queen Anne. They must also &quot;receive the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper according to the usage of the Church of Ireland&quot;. As well as excluding Roman Catholics from office, the &quot;sacramental test&quot; excluded Protestant Dissenters, notably Presbyterians, and many had to step down from municipal corporations and other positions. For example, ten Aldermen and ten Burgesses had to resign from Londonderry Corporation.
* Section 17 required that, within three months of appointment, any person appointed to a civil or military office must take the same oath and sacrament as in section 16. 
* Section 18 provided that failure to comply with sections 16 or 17 would vacate the office and void acts done by the official, who would be fined £500 and subject to civil penalties.
* Section 19 provided for rolls of those subscribing to the oaths under section 15 to 17 be kept at the Four Courts. The surviving &quot;convert roll&quot; details are a valuable primary source for historians of 18th-century Ireland.
* Section 20 empowered the Four Courts to administer the prescribed oaths
* Section 21 allowed someone disabled under section 18 to be rehabilitated by subsequent conformity.
* Section 22 allowed Irish people in England to take the equivalent oath and sacrament under the equivalent English laws (the Test Acts) and allowed those abroad elsewhere to do so when next in Ireland or England
* Section 23 prohibited Catholics from moving to Galway or Limerick, and required those already living there to deposit bonds with the corporations as proof of their loyalty.
* Section 24 required Catholics voting in elections for the Irish House of Commons to take oaths of allegiance and abjuration
* Section 25 provided that any advowsons of the Church of Ireland owned by Catholics would vest in the Crown
* Section 26 declared that &quot;superstitious&quot; gatherings at Saint Patrick&#x27;s Purgatory or holy wells were punishable as unlawful assembly
* Section 27 declared that, for an assembly under section 26, the punishment for attending was a fine of 10 shillings, or public whipping in default; the punishment for hawking was a fine of 20 shillings by distraint, or debtor&#x27;s prison in default
* Section 28 made an exception to section 23 for &quot;seamen, fishermen, and day labourers&quot; in houses worth under &quot;forty shillings the year&quot;. A forty-shilling freehold qualified for the parliamentary franchise in a county borough constituency.

==Effect==
Charles Ivar McGrath says that while the Popery Act had &quot;evident ... negative effects&quot;, specific research is lacking, and that it was intended more to prevent an increase in Catholic landholding than encourage further decrease: the Catholic share of land had already fallen from 60% before the 1641 Rebellion to 22% before the Williamite War to 14% in 1704. The figure of 5% in 1776 given in Arthur Young&#x27;s &quot;Tour in Ireland&quot; is probably an underestimate, although in 1778 only 1.5% of rent was paid to Catholics.

Catholic gavelkind cemented a tradition of farm subdivision, which persisted beyond the act&#x27;s repeal and contributed to the Great Famine of the 1840s.

Lord Redesdale, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, remarked in an 1805 case, based on a disputed inheritance of an estate originally purchased before and after 1704 by a Catholic:

In 1866, Chancery Commissioners reported that the Law of Judgments was much more complicated in Ireland than in England, and traced the difference back to the steps introduced in Ireland to enforce the 1704 act and ensure property was not being secretly transferred from Protestants to Catholics.

==Amendment and repeal==
The act was &quot;explained and amended&quot; by a 1709 act, 8 Anne c. 3 (I), which specified certain time limits left ambiguous by the original act, and closed some loopholes used by Catholics to remain beneficial owners of nominally Protestant property.

A 1719 act, 6 Geo. 1. c. 9 (I) indemnified officials who had not thitherto subscribed to the oath required by the Popery Act. The time period for Dissenters subscribing to the oath was routinely extended, initially by an Indemnity Act at the start of each biennial parliamentary session. Similar acts were passed by the British parliament, and after the union the UK parliament continued the practice.

From the late 18th century Roman Catholic relief bills eased the Penal Laws, by explicit or implicit repeal and replacement. In 1772 Catholics were allowed to lease up to 50 Irish acres of bog-land for up to 61 years by the act 11 &amp; 12 Geo. 3. c. 21 (I). The 1704 oath of allegiance for Catholics was replaced in 1774 by 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 3. c. 35 (I). Gardiner&#x27;s Act, the Leases for Lives Act 1777 (17 &amp; 18 Geo. 3. c. 49 (I)) (the Irish re-enactment of the British Papists Act 1778 (18 Geo. 3. c. 60)) implicitly repealed many other provisions of the 1704 act. Some were replaced with less onerous restrictions; for example, the maximum lease for Catholic tenants was increased from 31 years to 999 years. The restrictions on inheritance and preference for a convert eldest son were abolished. The sacramental test was repealed for Dissenters in 1780. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1782 (21 &amp; 22 Geo. 3. c. 24 (I)) repealed section 23 of the 1704 act. Another act of 1782, 21 &amp; 22 Geo. 3. c. 62 (I), allowed lay Catholics to be guardians of Protestants. Most restrictions on intermarriage were removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1792 (32 Geo. 3. c. 21 (I)). Many Penal Laws were repealed in general terms by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1793; the sacramental test for Catholics was effectively replaced by the 1774 oath.

The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 (10 Geo. 4. c. 7) abolished the declaration against transubstantiation specified a new public oath for Catholics, explicitly permitted Catholics to hold Irish civil or military offices other than Lord Lieutenant and Lord Chancellor, with the same oaths as required of non-Catholics (in addition to the new Catholic oath).

The Criminal Law Commission&#x27;s 1845 report on oaths said sections 1, 3, and 6 of the 1704 act had fallen into disuse and should be repealed. The Religious Disabilities Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. 59), passed in consequence of the committee&#x27;s report, explicitly repealed provisions of sections 1, 3, and 4 of the 1704 act.

The Popery Act was explicitly repealed as obsolete by the Promissory Oaths Act 1871 (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. 48), with the exception of section 25, which was made redundant by the coming into force in 1871 of the Irish Church Act 1869, and was repealed by the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1878.

<doc id="1252212" wikidata="Q7808052" url="?curid=1252212" title="Tindersticks (1993 album)">
<text>Tindersticks is the debut album by the chamber pop band Tindersticks, released in the UK on 11 October 1993 on This Way Up. Following positive reviews for their early singles and live performances, it was released to widespread critical acclaim by the music press, eventually being named album of the year by the UK music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
The album was released on CD and as a double vinyl album which featured a bonus track, &quot;Fruitless&quot;, that was not included on the CD (on the CD&#x27;s track listing &quot;Fruitless&quot; is crossed out). The album included re-recorded versions of both sides of the band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Patchwork&quot; and &quot;Milky Teeth&quot;, and their second single &quot;Marbles&quot;, which had been released as a 10&quot; single only – both singles were originally released on Tindersticks&#x27; own Tippy Toes label.

The band&#x27;s new label This Way Up released &quot;City Sickness&quot; on 13 September 1993 as the third single ahead of the album, and the group made their first video to accompany the single with director Martin Wallace, marking the beginning of a long association between the band and Wallace. At the time Wallace was working with Pulp, and Jarvis Cocker co-directed the &quot;City Sickness&quot; video along with Wallace. The video features scenes of everyday life shot in and around London&#x27;s Hyde Park, focussing on keyboard player Dave Boulter pushing a buggy with singer Stuart Staples&#x27; baby daughter Sydonie in it.

By the time of the album&#x27;s release Tindersticks had already picked up critical acclaim in the music press and from BBC Radio 1 DJs John Peel and Mark Radcliffe, who named &quot;Tindersticks&quot; as his favourite album of the year. The band recorded several sessions for the programmes of both DJs, including the first night of Radcliffe and Marc Riley&#x27;s new late night Radio 1 show on 25 October 1993 (they also played on the show&#x27;s final broadcast on 6 February 1997).

In June 2004, Island Records reissued the first four Tindersticks albums as remastered 2-CD sets featuring the original album and a bonus CD. For &quot;Tindersticks&quot; the bonus CD featured twelve demo versions of tracks recorded during sessions for the album.

As of March 1994 it had sold over 20,000 copies in United Kingdom.

==Cover==
The first 1,000 copies of the album included a pack of four postcards, featuring the front cover of the album, the portrait of the band on the inner sleeve, and paintings of a boy and a girl (the painting of the girl had already appeared as the cover of &quot;Marbles&quot;). The cover is a reproduction of a painting, &quot;The Red Dress&quot;, by popular mid-20th-century Spanish artist Francisco Rodriguez Sanchez Clement.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Melody Maker&quot; said, &quot;Some might consider releasing a double album as your debut a mite ambitious, but Tindersticks have that much more to offer. This album moves like a camera through a night in the heart of town. Behind the lens, a stranger, a lover and a fighter ... There&#x27;s sweet romance at this album&#x27;s core, even though it&#x27;s tarnished by violence ... Their songs all invoke the uncomfortable claustrophobia of a big city ... So here it is, the main feature. &quot;Tindersticks&quot; is all I&#x27;ve said and more. And for Tindersticks, this epic movie is only the beginning.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; felt that &quot;&quot;Tindersticks&quot; may not be perfect, but there&#x27;s much on these four sides that warrants its alleged indulgence. For while the singles supplied a detailed sketch of the band&#x27;s musical worth, the album offers the full picture, freshly painted and beautifully framed. Tacky in places for sure, but, on the whole, massively moving and daring ... gut instinct dictates that &quot;Tindersticks&quot; will be recommended as required listening in the winter months to come. The full impact of this amazing, exasperating, but ultimately fascinating album will yet be felt.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the album &quot;draws inspiration from the playful narrative style of producer Lee Hazlewood (Duane Eddy, Nancy Sinatra), the Cinemascope orchestrations of John Barry and the twilight-zone claustrophobia of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.&quot;

AllMusic said of the album, &quot;A thrilling, revelatory debut, &quot;Tindersticks&quot; is a chamber pop masterpiece of romantic elegance and gutter debauchery. Within the framework of a remarkably consistent and mesmerizingly dank atmosphere, the group covers a stunning amount of ground ... Fascinatingly constructed and strikingly ambitious, &quot;Tindersticks&quot; is insidiously labyrinthine: the music speaks softly but carries tremendous weight, and its hold grows more and more unbreakable with each listen.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Tindersticks&quot; was named album of the year by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and placed at number 13 on the &quot;NME&quot;″s equivalent list. In the list of &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s singles of the year for 1993, &quot;Marbles&quot; was placed at number 7 and &quot;City Sickness&quot; made number 42, while &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named &quot;City Sickness&quot; the fourth best single of 1993.

In 2024, &quot;The Independent&quot; included the album in their list of 20 most underrated albums at number 19.

<doc id="1252215" wikidata="Q5215404" url="?curid=1252215" title="Dancer with Bruised Knees">
<text>Dancer with Bruised Knees is the second album by Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, released in 1977. It was produced by Joe Boyd. The album employed several notable folk musicians to contribute a bluegrass feel to many of the tracks. The album also includes three French songs, one by the McGarrigles with Philippe Tatartcheff, and two traditional numbers. The guest musicians included John Cale, Dane Lanken, Bill Monroe, Dave Mattacks and Pat Donaldson. &quot;Dancer with Bruised Knees&quot; peaked a No. 35 on the UK Albums Chart.

==Reception==

Robert Christgau said the album is &quot;not as tuneful as some might wish&quot; but is nonetheless &quot;even better than the debut&quot;. He particularly complimented the studio techniques. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; determined that &quot;their songwriting is serious business but the informality of their records remains their most charming asset&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;there is an element of coyness here that is slightly disconcerting... And the songs—Anna&#x27;s in particular—don&#x27;t match the great songs on the first album.&quot;

<doc id="1252219" wikidata="Q7196481" url="?curid=1252219" title="Pinsly Railroad Company (1938–2023)">
<text>Pinsly Railroad Company, based in Westfield, Massachusetts, was a short line railroad holding company. It was one of the oldest such companies in the United States, and has owned railroads continuously since its founding in 1938. Pinsly&#x27;s sole railroad subsidiary is the Pioneer Valley Railroad in Massachusetts. In August 2023, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners reached an agreement with Pinsly to acquire the railroad through its subsidiary Gulf &amp; Atlantic Railways.

== History ==
Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1899, Samuel M. Pinsly received degrees in engineering and law from Northwestern University before briefly serving in the U.S. Army during World War I. Pinsly founded his shortline operating company in 1938 with the purchase of the Hoosac Tunnel and Wilmington Railroad from his father-in-law, fellow shortline operator H.E. Salzberg. While the line was rebuilt and turned a profit, extensive line relocations due to a new dam forced the railroad to be abandoned in 1971. Pinsly went on to acquire a number of lines throughout New England and the Southeast until his death in 1977. He was succeeded by Marjorie &quot;Maggie&quot; Silver, one of the first women to own a railroad company in the United States.

Pinsly sold their 3 Florida shortlines (Florida Central Railroad, Florida Midland Railroad and Florida Northern Railroad) to 3i RR Holdings GP, LLC and subsidiaries (d.b.a. &quot;Regional Rail, LLC&quot;) in November 2019. Pinsly&#x27;s business development manager stated in 2022 that the company sold off its other subsidiaries to focus exclusively on the Pioneer Valley Railroad. Pinsly additionally owns Railroad Distribution Services, a company which handles distribution and transloading.

<text>Vampirella () is a vampire superheroine created by Forrest J Ackerman and comic book artist Trina Robbins in Warren Publishing&#x27;s black-and-white horror comics magazine Vampirella #1 (Sept. 1969), a sister publication of &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot;.

Writer-editor Archie Goodwin later developed the character from horror-story hostesses, in which capacity she remained through issue #8 (Nov. 1970), to a horror-drama leading character. The magazine was published continuously until 1983, when Warren Publishing ceased operations and its assets were bought by Harris Publications. &quot;Vampirella&quot; comics, both new and reprints, have continued through various publishers into the 21st century.

==Publication history==

===Warren Publishing===
Vampirella initially appeared in Warren Publishing&#x27;s black-and-white horror-comics magazine &quot;Vampirella&quot; #1 (Sept. 1969), running to issue #112 (March 1983), plus a 1972 annual reprinting stories from the series, and a 1977 special with color reprints of José González stories. The title was a sister magazine of Warren&#x27;s horror anthologies &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot;. Like those magazines&#x27; respective mascots, Uncle Creepy and Cousin Eerie, Vampirella hosted horror stories, though unlike them, she would also star in her own story, which would headline each issue. &quot;Vampirella&quot; was initially edited by Bill Parente. It was later edited by Archie Goodwin (issues #7–12, 34–35), Billy Graham (#13–16), Bill DuBay (#21–50, 87–95, 101–102) and Louise Jones (#51–86).

According to comics historian Richard J. Arndt, &quot;Forrest Ackerman created, or at least had a strong hand in creating, Vampirella and he clearly had a major influence in shaping the lighthearted bad-girl story style of this issue as well.&quot; Her costume and hair style were designed by comics artist Trina Robbins. The character&#x27;s first story artist was Tom Sutton. Artist Frank Frazetta&#x27;s first-issue cover was a substitute for the original cover by European artist Aslan.

José González became the character&#x27;s primary artist starting with issue #12. Other artists who drew Vampirella during her magazine&#x27;s original run included Gonzalo Mayo, Leopold Sanchez, Esteban Maroto, José Ortiz, Escolano, Rudy Nebres, Ramon Torrents, Pablo Marcos, Jim Janes, John Lakey, Val Lakey, and Louis Small Jr.

Backup features appearing in &quot;Vampirella&quot; included &quot;Tomb of the Gods&quot;, &quot;Pantha&quot; and &quot;Fleur&quot;. Vampirella herself also appeared in a story with fellow Warren characters Pantha and the Rook in &quot;Eerie&quot; #94–95, and with most of the Warren characters in a company crossover special in &quot;Eerie&quot; #130.

===Harris Publications===
Upon Warren&#x27;s bankruptcy shortly afterward, Harris Publications acquired the company assets at auction in August 1983, although legal murkiness and a 1999 lawsuit by Warren publisher James Warren resulted in his reacquisition of the rights to sister publications &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot;. Harris Comics published Vampirella stories in various series and miniseries from 1991 to 2007, beginning with &quot;Vampirella&quot; #113 (1988), a one-issue continuation of the original series, containing Vampirella reprints and one unrelated new story. Harris subsequently published the all-reprint one-shot &quot;Vampirella vs. the Cult of Chaos&quot;, and the four-issue miniseries &quot;Vampirella: Morning in America&quot; (Sept. 1991 - April 1992) by writer Kurt Busiek and penciler Louis La Chance. Three ongoing series followed: 
* &quot;Vampirella&quot; #1–5, followed by #0 (Nov. 1992 – Dec. 1994), primarily by plotter Busiek, scriptwriter Tom Sniegoski, and penciler Louis Small Jr.; 
* &quot;Vengeance of Vampirella&quot; #1–25 (April 1994 – April 1996) by writer Sniegoski and artist Aldrin Aw (under the pseudonym Buzz), and later pencilers including Kirk Van Wormer, Kevin Sharpe, David Perrin, Chris Batista, and Amanda Conner. 
* &quot;Vampirella Strikes&quot; #1–7 (Oct. 1995 – Oct. 1996) by writers Sniegoski, David Quinn, Mark Millar, and Ian Edginton, and pencilers including Ed McGuinness, Karl Moline, and Rudy Nebres.

The three-issue miniseries &quot;Vampirella Lives&quot; (Dec. 1996 – Feb. 1997) featured writer Warren Ellis and penciler Conner.

Additionally, Harris published several one-shots: &quot;Vampirella Summer Nights&quot; (title per its trademarked cover logo) / &quot;Vampirella&#x27;s Summer Nights&quot; (as in the indicia&#x27;s copyright information) (1992), by writer Steve Englehart and penciler Joe Brozowski (under the pseudonym J. J. Birch), &quot;Vampirella/Shadowhawk: Creatures of the Night&quot; (Feb. 1995), &quot;Vampirella Pin-Up Special&quot; (Oct. 1995), and &quot;Vengeance of Vampirella: The Mystery Walk&quot; (Nov. 1995).

Harris also published many reprints. The 1993 trade-paperback collection &quot;Vampirella: The Dracula War&quot; reprinted a serialized story from Harris&#x27; &quot;Vampirella&quot; #1–4. The 1994 &quot;Cain / Vampirella Flip Book&quot; reprinted a 1993 Vampirella story by writer Busiek and artist Arthur Adams from Harris&#x27; &quot;Creepy 1993 Fearbook&quot;. The five-issue &quot;Vampirella Classic&quot; (Feb.–Nov. 1995) reprinted Warren stories. &quot;Vengeance of Vampirella: Bloodshed&quot; (March 1995) reprinted a serialized story from the &quot;Vengeance of Vampirella&quot; series.

The publisher additionally reprinted Warren stories in the trade paperback &quot;Vampirella: Transcending Time &amp; Space&quot; (1992), &quot;Vampirella: A Scarlet Thirst&quot; (1993), and &quot;Vampirella &amp; The Blood Red Queen of Hearts&quot; (1996); and the series &quot;Vampirella of Drakulon&quot; #1–5, followed by #0 (Jan.–Nov. 1996).

At the Fangoria Weekend of Horrors convention in January 2007, Scott Licina, editor-in-chief of Fangoria Comics, announced his company had acquired the character from Harris. However, on April 30, 2007, Harris editor Bon Alimagno denied there had been such an arrangement in place and that Fangoria&#x27;s claim was &quot;not factual&quot;. Harris subsequently launched the title &quot;Vampirella Quarterly&quot;.

===Dynamite Entertainment===
On March 17, 2010, Dynamite Entertainment acquired the rights to Vampirella from Harris Comics. The publisher started a new ongoing series with &quot;Vampirella&quot; #1, in November 2010. A new monthly series, &quot;Vampirella and the Scarlet Legion&quot;, was released in May 2011 following the main title. The series lasted 38 issues before concluding in January 2014.

The title was rebooted in June 2014 with &quot;Vampirella&quot; vol. 2, #1 by author Nancy Collins. The 2014 series continued with Volume 3 in March 2016, which was noted for giving Vampirella a new costume.

A second reboot and fourth relaunch overall, &quot;Vampirella&quot; vol. 4, began in 2017. The series was first written by Paul Cornell, and later by Jeremy Whitley.

===Mike The Pike Productions===

On March 2, 2021, Mike The Pike Productions, Inc.&#x27;s subsidiary Arowana Media Holdings, Inc. acquired the worldwide film, television and streaming rights to Dynamite Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Vampirella&quot;. Including stories, characters, and derivative works of the Vampirella universe.

==Fictional character biography==

Vampirella originally hails from the planet Drakulon, a world where blood flows like water and where the natives, called the Vampiri, share traditionally vampiric characteristics. Drakulon orbits a binary star which causes continuous droughts throughout the year. These droughts gradually dry up the Vampiri&#x27;s blood supply; threatening them with extinction. Vampirella&#x27;s journey begins when an American space shuttle crashes on Drakulon. Hoping to save her people, she travels to Earth and begins hunting dark remnants of her own race. Earth&#x27;s vampires originate from Dracula, a forgotten member of the Vampiri race who left his homeworld centuries ago only to be corrupted by the demonic entity known as Chaos.

===Harris continuity===
After relaunching Vampirella with the miniseries &quot;Morning In America&quot;, written by Kurt Busiek, Harris Comics published the story &quot;Mystery Walk&quot;, which revised Vampirella&#x27;s origin. She learns she is, in fact, the daughter of Lilith, whom popular medieval Jewish lore depicts as the first wife of Adam. Lilith would not submit to Adam and, cast out of Eden by God, spawned demons. She later repented and went to Eden to bear children to fight the evil she had created. Her first attempt was Madek and Magdalene, who turned to evil; Vampirella was her second. Madek and Magdalene brainwashed her into believing she was from Drakulon.

Further retcons were presented in &quot;Vampirella Lives&quot; and in &quot;Blood Lust&quot;. Drakulon is real, but is a place in Hell. Vampirella was brought to Eden, not born there. It was Lilith, not Madek and Magdalene, who made believe Drakulon was another planet. Vampirella restores the rivers of blood to Drakulon, which weakens Lilith, who is killed by the hand of God.

A further revision in the &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot; storyline revealed Lilith did not really repent and raised Vampirella to be good because she wanted to release the Heart of Darkness (heart of the fallen angel Malkuth) from Metatron&#x27;s lance, which could only be done by a good person. Another retcon, in &quot;Vampirella: Revelations&quot;, reveals the reason Lilith raised Vampirella to be good was that the existence of vampires made Lilith weaker and she wanted someone to kill them. Lilith used a magic mirror to make Vampirella believe whatever variation on her origin was necessary at the time.

===Dynamite continuities===
In the initial Dynamite-published series, Vampirella works reluctantly with Dracula against a rebellious cult of his former followers. Acquiring Sofia Murray as her sidekick, Vampirella becomes involved in a plot by the Vatican that ultimately resurrects Von Kreist and leads to Sofia&#x27;s death. Vampirella severs her ties with the Vatican and finds herself working for the forces of Order again. Reuniting with a resurrected Van Helsing, Pendragon, and other characters from the Warren Magazine run, Vampirella visits the future and discovers the world destroyed by the supernatural. Trying to form a supernatural kingdom to contradict this, Vampirella falls prey to a conspiracy by Dracula and a group of vampire knights that result in reality becoming unraveled. Lilith banishes Vampirella from her universe in order to save her.

Vampirella was relaunched with &quot;Our Lady Of Shadows&quot; as an agent of the Vatican before being relaunched again with a new costume in &quot;Hollywood Horror&quot; under author Kate Leth. In this universe, Vampirella has recently come to Earth and become a Hollywood scream queen. She lives with her live-in boyfriend Tristan and butler Coleridge.

After falling into a thousand-year sleep, Vampirella awakes in a bizarre, dystopian future, where she meets her new sidekick and girlfriend, Vicki, and a black cat she names Grit. After going on a journey through her own mind, Vampirella learns she has absorbed all the memories and experiences of a hundred Vampirellas from parallel universes.

According to the &quot;Hack/Slash&quot; series, Vampirella currently works as a radio talk show host and has several times teamed up with Cassie and her partner Vlad to stop demons and vampires instead of the standard slashers the series is known for. She and Vlad have an intense physical attraction and relationship, but broke up because his nomadic lifestyle did not mesh with hers.

In the 2019 version by Christopher Priest, the writer incorporated all the previous versions of the character&#x27;s history to make a comprehensive revision of Vampirella&#x27;s back story. Vampirella has been on Earth for 50 years, and Draklon is an alternate version of Earth&#x27;s moon. The alternate version of Earth is called Arcadia. Drakulon and Arcadia were at war which caused Aracadia to die out and Drakulon became an archaic society. She has strained relationships with Lilith, Draculina, Victory (her one time girlfriend), and Chasity. After Vampirella married Dracula, she had his child; the baby was taken by Draculina but later returned to Vampirella.

===Powers and abilities===
Vampirella possesses many of the typical powers of mythological vampires. She exerts super-strength when facing her opponents and can move so fast that she appears as a blur of motion. Her senses are far beyond those of humans, allowing her to tell one&#x27;s emotional state through their scent, hear things imperceptible to humans, and see clearly in total darkness. She has increased athletic abilities and possesses stamina, reflexes, and agility beyond that of humans. Her healing factor grants her resilience, allows her to heal rapidly from her wounds, and makes her immune to Earthly illness and toxins. Feeding quickly restores her strength and health.

She has the power to grow a giant pair of chiropteran wings to allow self-propelled flight. She can make her stare and even her voice hypnotic. She has been seen as having the ability to induce sexual arousal in males simply by being in their presence. She is shown to have the power of telepathy as she was able to hear the voices of demons inside Jackie Estacado&#x27;s mind.

She is immortal. In addition to her supernatural abilities, Vampirella is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant and is shown to be skilled with modern-day firearms.

==Spinoffs==
Christopher Priest&#x27;s world of Vampirella has been expanded in spinoffs. The first is &quot;Sacred Six&quot; (2020), which follows Lilith, Vampirella&#x27;s mother, protecting a vampire city with a team consisting of Nyx, Chastity, Pantha, Victory (who takes on the name Draculina), and Katie (the real Draculina). Solo series were published for Nyx (2021), Pantha (2022), Draculina (2022), and Victory (2023).

==Characters==
===Main protagonists===
* Vampirella
:The heroine is a vampire, since she is the daughter of Lilith and needs blood to survive and has many of the typical vampiric powers, including superhuman physical abilities, shapeshifting into a bat, immortality, and a mesmeric stare. She is not prone to the race&#x27;s traditional weaknesses, such as daylight, holy water, garlic, or crosses. She does not attack people to drink their blood, except occasionally when she herself is attacked or desires to kill.

*Pendragon
:A former sorcerer, now a sideshow magician. Vampirella calls him &quot;Pendy dearest&quot; and treats him as she would a kindly old uncle. While occasionally his knowledge of magic is useful to her, Pendragon is often a liability. In the Warren stories they often travel together, seeking out evil-doers, but Pendragon is generally depicted as getting lost, getting drunk, falling asleep, or otherwise fumbling at a critical moment, thus causing a crisis. Vampirella is deeply loyal to him, however; he is the only real family she has.

* Conrad van Helsing
:A blind, psychic vampire hunter. He was pursuing Dracula and initially tried to destroy Vampirella, believing her to be kin to that vampire lord.

===&quot;Vampi&quot;===
In 2000 a comic book series entitled &quot;Vampi&quot; began circulation through Anarchy Studio. The series followed Vampi, an alternate futuristic version of Vampirella that seeks to find a cure for her vampirism. The main series ran for 25 issues. Several miniseries followed under the titles &quot;Vampi Vicious&quot;, &quot;Vampi Vicious Circle&quot;, &quot;Vampi Vicious Rampage&quot;, and &quot;Vampi vs. Xin&quot;. An omnibus edition collecting the first eighteen issues of the initial run was released in 2012 through Dynamite Entertainment.

===&quot;Li&#x27;l Vampi&quot;===
In January 2014 Dynamite Entertainment released &quot;Li&#x27;l Vampi&quot;, a one-shot comic book by writer Eric Trautmann and artist Agnes Garbowska. The comic followed a child version of Vampirella as she tries to uncover why monsters are destroying the town of Stoker, Maine.

== Media adaptations ==
In 1992 Canadian actor and award-winning screenwriter, Peter Jobin, created the production company Europa Production Investment Corporation and purchased the movie rights to the comic book character Vampirella. Based on the source material, Mr. Jobin wrote the first draft screenplay and began the process of securing financing. Promotional artwork was commissioned from graphic artist William (Bill) Rankine. Promotional and investment packaging was presented at the May 1993 Cannes Film Festival at the American Pavilion. A full page promotional poster was also featured in the May 18, 1993 Hollywood Reporter Cannes &#x27;93 Daily Satellite Edition - Day 5. Financing was never fully completed for &quot;Vampirella: The Motion Picture&quot; and the film rights lapsed.

In 1996, a &quot;Vampirella&quot; film adaptation was produced by Concorde Pictures, starring Talisa Soto in the title role. In 2021, Dynamite Entertainment announced a new feature film was in development in addition to plans for television adaptations based on the Vampirella Universe.

<text>The Disfranchising Act was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of Ireland debated in 1727 and enacted in 1728, one of a series of Penal Laws, and prohibited all Roman Catholics from voting in parliamentary elections. Its full title is &quot;An Act for the further regulating the Election of Members of Parliament, and preventing the irregular Proceedings of Sheriffs and other Officers in electing and returning such Members&quot; and its citation is . It received royal assent on 6 May 1728.

In the 18th century, elections were held at irregular intervals and at the beginning of a new reign. The Act followed the death of George I on 11 June 1727 but did not take effect until after the election of 1727, coming into force in 1728.

The act was repealed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1793, allowing the franchise in Ireland to all men holding a property with a rental value of at least two pounds annually.

<text>The Raurimu Spiral is a single-track railway spiral, starting with a horseshoe curve, overcoming a height difference, in the central North Island of New Zealand, on the North Island Main Trunk railway (NIMT) between Wellington and Auckland. It is a notable feat of civil engineering, having been called an &quot;engineering masterpiece.&quot; The Institute of Professional Engineers of New Zealand has designated the spiral as a significant engineering heritage site.

== Background ==
During the construction of the central section of the North Island Main Trunk, a major obstacle arose: how to cross the steep slopes between the North Island Volcanic Plateau to the east and the valleys and gorges of the Whanganui River to the west?
South of Taumarunui, the terrain is steep, but not unmanageable, with the exception of the stretch between Raurimu and National Park, where the land rises too steeply for a direct rail route. A direct line between these two points would rise in a distance of some , a gradient of 1 in 24. The area was thoroughly surveyed during the 1880s in an attempt to find a route with a lesser grade, but the only viable possibility seemed to require a detour and nine massive viaducts. Even then, the gradient would&#x27;ve been steeper than 1 in 50.

== Construction ==
The problem was solved in 1898 by a surveyor in the employ of Robert Holmes, Public Works Department engineer. He proposed a line that looped back upon itself and then spiralled around with the aid of tunnels and bridges, rising at a gradient of 1 in 52. Though costly and labour-intensive, the scheme was still cheaper than the previous plan by Browne and Turner which required 9 viaducts down the Piopiotea River. The most remarkable feature is that there is no place to view the complete line. By all accounts, Holmes visualised the layout in his imagination.

The railway forms an ascending spiral southwards, with two relatively short tunnels, a circle and three hairpin bends. From the north, trains pass Raurimu station before going round a 200° bend to the left in a horseshoe curve, climbing above the track on which they have just travelled. Two sharp bends to the right follow, after which the line passes through two short tunnels, the Lower Spiral Tunnel (384 m) and the Upper Spiral Tunnel (96 m). Trains then complete a full circle, crossing over the Lower Spiral Tunnel through which they have just passed which is below, before continuing towards Wellington. further on the line has two more sharp bends, to the right and then to the left.

After the second of these bends a train has risen and travelled from Raurimu– the straight-line distance is . Some of the sharp curves are only 7½ chains (150 m) radius.

Although spirals are relatively common in the Alps, particularly in Switzerland, they generally involve extensive tunnelling inside mountainsides. A masterly feature of Holmes&#x27; layout is the way in which it uses natural land contours so that no viaducts are needed, and only two short tunnels.

==Folklore==
Legend has it that a locomotive engineer once engaged the emergency brakes of his train upon mistaking the light of his own Guard&#x27;s Van on a nearby part of the spiral for the rear of a different train directly ahead of him.

<doc id="1252237" wikidata="Q610225" url="?curid=1252237" title="Artists and repertoire">
<text>Artists and repertoire (or A&amp;R for short) is the division of a record label or music publishing company that is responsible for scouting, financing and overseeing the artistic development of recording artists and songwriters. It also acts as a liaison between artists and the record label or publishing company. 

==Responsibilities==

===Finding talent===
The A&amp;R division of a record label is responsible for finding new recording artists and bringing those artists to the record company. A&amp;R staff may go to hear emerging bands play at nightclubs and festivals to scout for talent. Personnel in the A&amp;R division are expected to understand the current tastes of the market and to be able to find artists who will be commercially successful.

An A&amp;R executive is authorized to offer a record contract, often in the form of a &quot;deal memo&quot; – a short, informal document that establishes a business relationship between the recording artist and the record company. The actual contract negotiations will typically be carried out by entertainment lawyers.

A&amp;R executives rely mostly on the word of mouth of trusted associates, critics and business contacts, rather than on unsolicited demo tapes.

===Overseeing the recording process===
The A&amp;R division of a record label oversees the music style and recording process. This includes helping the artist to find the right record producer, scheduling time in a recording studio and advising the artist on all aspects of making a high-quality recording. They work with the artist to choose the best songs (i.e., ) to record. For artists who do not write their own music, the A&amp;R person will assist in finding songs, songwriters and arrangers. A&amp;R staff will help find session musicians for the recording. A&amp;R executives maintain contact with their counterparts at music publishing companies to get new songs and material from songwriters and producers.

As the record nears completion, the A&amp;R department works closely with the artist to determine whether the record is acceptable to the record company. This process may include suggesting that new songs need to be written, that existing songs need a new arrangement, or that some album tracks need to be re-recorded. A key issue is whether the album has a single – a particular track which can be used to market the record.

===Assisting with marketing and promotion===
Once the record is completed, the A&amp;R department consults with marketing, promotion, the artist and their management to choose one or more singles to help promote the record.

==History and influence==
The tastes of particular A&amp;R executives have influenced the course of music history. A&amp;R man John Hammond discovered Billie Holiday, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin and Bruce Springsteen. Hammond&#x27;s colleagues were initially skeptical of these artists because none of them appeared to be creating &quot;commercial&quot; music. Hammond&#x27;s instincts proved to be correct, and these artists went on to sell hundreds of millions of records. Gary Gersh signed the band Nirvana to David Geffen&#x27;s DGC Records at a time when alternative rock music was not considered commercial. Gersh was able to convince his co-workers to push the record in spite of their misgivings. In cases like these, A&amp;R people have radically changed the direction of popular musical tastes and introduced large numbers of people to new sounds.

This kind of prescience is the exception rather than the rule. Historically, A&amp;R executives have tended to sign new artists who fit into recent trends and who resemble acts that are currently successful. For example, Columbia Records&#x27; A&amp;R man in the 1950s, Mitch Miller, favored traditional pop singers like Guy Mitchell and Patti Page, and rejected early rock-&#x27;n&#x27;-rollers Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly.

This &quot;trend following&quot; mindset has generated several waves of narrowly defined genres, leading to a perception of triteness, including teen pop (1998–2001), alternative rock (1993–1996), glam metal (1986–1991) and disco (1976–1978). Trend following can be counter-productive, since it has often led to over-promotion followed by backlash (as happened to the disco genre for example). Towards the end of the life of each wave or trend, record companies have found themselves faced with enormous losses as consumers&#x27; tastes changed. For example, at the end of the disco boom in 1978, millions of records were returned by record retailers, causing a deep recession in the music business that lasted until 1982, when Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; finally brought the public back into record stores in large numbers.

The general move towards more conservative and business-minded signings from the 1980s onwards is seen to be symptomatic of an industry where the most powerful figures are no longer music fans or people with musical backgrounds, but are business executives, a group largely composed of individuals with uniform backgrounds. Traditionally A&amp;R executives were composers, arrangers and producers – Atlantic Records&#x27;s heads Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ertegun were producers and composers respectively – but an A&amp;R with musical ability and knowledge has become a rarity, with Ron Fair and Martin Kierszenbaum being notable recent exceptions. The composer and arranger Richard Niles has said,

What you&#x27;ve got now is huge multinational companies where most of their A&amp;R staff are businessmen. They&#x27;re people who look at music from the standpoint of marketing, not from the standpoint of music and talent. They will say, &quot;Go out and get me anything that&#x27;s popular now.&quot;

Hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan referenced this stereotype of the business-minded A&amp;R executive in their single &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot;, metaphorically likening them to &quot;mountain climbers&quot;.

==Regional variations==
According to Rhythm King Records and Lizard King Records founder Martin Heath, the A&amp;R community in the UK is more integrated than it is in the US, being very London-centric and encompassing a relatively small number of people. &quot;If scouts are chasing a band, you&#x27;ll see the same thirty people in one room. You get a herd mentality in the UK, but also some very diverse signings as well,&quot; he said in an interview with HitQuarters. Heath believes that in the US it is more typical for A&amp;R to wait until a band is established – having attracted other offers or achieved a level of sales – before taking action, a technique which often works out as being more expensive.

==2000s changes==

New forms of digital distribution have changed the relationship between consumers and the music they choose. Gerd Leonhard and others argue that the wide selection of music on digital services has allowed music consumers to bypass the traditional role of A&amp;R. In the wake of declining record sales, many A&amp;R staffers have been terminated.

<doc id="1252248" wikidata="Q1067723" url="?curid=1252248" title="Inspector Lestrade">
<text>Detective Inspector G. Lestrade ( ) is a fictional character appearing in the Sherlock Holmes stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle. Lestrade&#x27;s first appearance was in the first Sherlock Holmes story, the 1887 novel &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;. His last appearance is in the 1924 short story &quot;The Adventure of the Three Garridebs&quot;, which is included in the collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

Lestrade is a determined but conventional Scotland Yard detective who consults Holmes on many cases, and is the most prominent police character in the series. Lestrade has been played by many actors in adaptations based on the Sherlock Holmes stories in film, television, and other media.

==Appearances in canon==

Lestrade is also mentioned in the novel &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; (1890), though he doesn&#x27;t appear in it.

==Fictional character biography==
===History and personality===
Lestrade mentions his &quot;twenty years&#x27; experience&quot; in the police force in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;. In the story, Holmes says Lestrade is &quot;a well-known detective&quot;. It is observed by Holmes that Lestrade and another detective, Tobias Gregson, have an ongoing rivalry, and he identifies the two as &quot;the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and energetic, but conventional – shockingly so.&quot; Holmes regularly allows members of the police to take the credit for his deductions, including Lestrade in cases such as those in &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&quot;. Lestrade is able to write in shorthand.

Lestrade is initially doubtful about Holmes&#x27;s methods, and he suggests that Holmes is &quot;too much inclined to be cocksure&quot; in &quot;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&quot;. He is &quot;indifferent and contemptuous&quot; of Holmes&#x27;s exploration in &quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot;. Holmes is openly rude about Lestrade at times, such as in &quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot; when he tells Lestrade &quot;demurely&quot; that he is unskilled at handling facts, and refers to Lestrade as an imbecile. In &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot;, Holmes says that being out of his depth is Lestrade&#x27;s normal state (along with Inspectors Gregson and Athelney Jones). However, Holmes is generally more positive about Lestrade in later stories. In &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot;, Holmes remarks that Lestrade&#x27;s tenacity &quot;has brought him to the top at Scotland Yard&quot;. In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, he says that Lestrade is &quot;the best of the professionals&quot; (meaning the professionals employed by Scotland Yard as opposed to himself), and in the same story, Watson observes &quot;from the reverential way in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together.&quot;

By the time of the story &quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons&quot;, Lestrade is a regular evening visitor at 221B Baker Street, and &quot;his visits were welcome to Sherlock Holmes&quot; according to Watson. In the same story, Lestrade reveals the high regard in which Holmes is now held by Scotland Yard: &quot;We&#x27;re not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow, there&#x27;s not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn&#x27;t be glad to shake you by the hand&quot;. Holmes thanks Lestrade for this comment, and Watson notes that this is one of the few instances when Holmes is visibly moved. In &quot;The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax&quot;, Holmes refers to him as &quot;friend Lestrade&quot;. Lestrade&#x27;s involvement in the investigation in &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; suggests he has become one of Scotland Yard&#x27;s most trusted detectives.

He was described by H. Paul Jeffers in the following words:
He is the most famous detective ever to walk the corridors of Scotland Yard, yet he existed only in the fertile imagination of a writer. He was Inspector Lestrade. We do not know his first name, only his initial: &quot;G&quot;. Although he appears thirteen times in the immortal adventures of Sherlock Holmes, nothing is known of the life outside the Yard of the detective whom Dr. Watson described unflatteringly as sallow, rat-faced, and dark-eyed and whom Holmes saw as quick and energetic but wholly conventional, lacking in imagination, and normally out of his depth – the best of a bad lot who had reached the top in the CID by bulldog tenacity.
===Appearance and age===
Inspector Lestrade is described as &quot;a little sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow&quot; in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;. In &quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot;, Watson describes Lestrade as &quot;a lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking&quot;, and also says, &quot;In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard.&quot; Watson states that Lestrade is &quot;as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-like as ever&quot; in &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot;. He is described as &quot;a small, wiry bulldog of a man&quot; in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, and there is a description of him as having &quot;bulldog features&quot; in &quot;The Adventure of the Second Stain&quot;. According to Holmes in &quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot;, Lestrade&#x27;s tracks can be identified due to the &quot;inward twist&quot; of his left foot.

His age is not given in the stories. Lestrade works with Holmes as early as &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; (which according to Leslie S. Klinger takes place in 1881) and continues to do so as late as &quot;The Adventure of the Three Garridebs&quot; (which is set in 1902). According to Klinger, L. S. Holstein used this information to conclude that Lestrade is ten to twelve years older than Holmes. Klinger estimated that Holmes was born in 1854; together with Holstein&#x27;s theory, this would suggest that Lestrade may have been born between 1842 and 1844.

==Name origins and pronunciation==

Doyle seems to have acquired Lestrade&#x27;s name from a fellow student at the University of Edinburgh, Joseph Alexandre Lestrade, who was a Saint Lucian medical student. In &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot;, Lestrade&#x27;s first initial is revealed to be G. This initial may have been inspired by the Prefect of Police known only as &quot;G—&quot; in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot; (1845). Despite having an apparently French surname (there is a village named Lestrade-et-Thouels in France and &quot;l&#x27;estrade&quot; means &quot;the raised platform&quot; in French), Inspector Lestrade shows no overt French ties.

According to &quot;Everyman&#x27;s English Pronouncing Dictionary&quot;, the name Lestrade can be pronounced either &quot;Le&#x27;strayed&quot; (rhyming with &quot;trade&quot;) or &quot;Le&#x27;strahd&quot; . In &quot;The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Leslie S. Klinger writes that there is no consensus among scholars on the pronunciation of &quot;Lestrade&quot;. The original French pronunciation of the name would have been close to &quot;Le&#x27;strahd&quot;. However, according to the book &quot;The Sherlock Holmes Miscellany&quot; by Roger Johnson and Jean Upton (Holmesian scholars and members of The Baker Street Irregulars), Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s daughter Dame Jean Conan Doyle stated that her father pronounced the name with a long &quot;a&quot; sound (as &quot;Le&#x27;strayed&quot;).

The pronunciation of Lestrade as &quot;Le&#x27;strahd&quot; has been used in multiple adaptations such as the 1939–1946 film series, the 2009 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, and the television series &quot;Sherlock&quot; (2010–2017). The pronunciation of the name as &quot;Le&#x27;strayed&quot; has also been used in multiple canonical adaptations, including the 1931–1937 film series, the Granada television series (1984–1994), and the BBC radio series (1989–1998), as well as in some non-canonical works, including the 2020 film &quot;Enola Holmes&quot;.

==Depiction in derivatives and adaptations==
===Film===
* Arthur Bell played Lestrade in several short films released in 1921 as part of the Stoll film series. Tom Beaumont played Lestrade in a 1923 short film in the series.
* Philip Hewland played Lestrade in &quot;The Sleeping Cardinal&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Missing Rembrandt&quot; (1932).
* Alan Mowbray played Lestrade in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; (1933).&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyles 1986 https://archive.org/details/sherlockholmesce0000eyle/page/133 133&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charles Mortimer played Lestrade in &quot;The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1935).
* Lestrade was played by John Turnball in &quot;Silver Blaze&quot; (1937).
* Dennis Hoey played Lestrade in six of the Sherlock Holmes films in the 1939–1946 series from Universal Pictures starring Basil Rathbone as Holmes. This version had the Yard man as a well-meaning fool patronised by the detective, whose help he greatly appreciated, rather in the manner of that series&#x27; version of Doctor Watson (Nigel Bruce). Lestrade is nonetheless a capable officer, and Holmes never questions his honesty or his willingness to solve a case.
* Frank Finlay played him twice, in &quot;A Study in Terror&quot; (1965) and &quot;Murder by Decree&quot; (1979), both focusing on non-canon stories with Holmes investigating the Jack the Ripper murders.
* Ronald Lacey played Lestrade in the 1983 film &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, starring Ian Richardson as Holmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyles 1986 https://archive.org/details/sherlockholmesce0000eyle/page/140 140&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (Lacey would later play the Sholto Brothers in the Granada television production of &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; with Jeremy Brett as Holmes.)
* Roger Ashton-Griffiths played Lestrade in &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1985); his taking credit for solving the mystery earns him a promotion from Detective to Inspector.
* Jeffrey Jones played Lestrade in &quot;Without a Clue&quot; (1988).
* Eddie Marsan plays him in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s Warner Bros. adaptation &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, alongside Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law (2009). This incarnation of Lestrade expresses a high level of irritation for Holmes, who in turn regards him with affectionate mockery. Lestrade nevertheless depends on Holmes, calling him to crime scenes and even allowing a fugitive Holmes to escape police custody. He briefly reprised the role in the 2011 sequel &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;.
* Adeel Akhtar plays him in the 2020 Netflix film Enola Holmes and its 2022 sequel.

===Television films===
* Eustace Wyatt played Lestrade in the 1937 television production &quot;The Three Garridebs&quot;.
* Lestrade was played by Alan Caillou in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1972).
* Borislav Brondukov played him in all five television films of the Soviet series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot; (1979–1986) starring Vasily Livanov.
* Lestrade was played by Hubert Rees in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1982).
* Kenway Baker plays Lestrade in the television film &quot;Incident at Victoria Falls&quot; (1992), He makes a brief appearance in the film.
* William Huw portrays Lestrade in the 2010 direct-to-DVD Asylum film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. In this film, Lestrade does not seem to recognise Watson (Gareth David Lloyd), and often takes credit for Holmes&#x27;s accomplishments. He becomes involved in the chase of a criminal mastermind dubbed &quot;Spring-Heeled Jack&quot;, who uses several mechanical creatures to commit crimes across London.

===Television series===
* In the 1951 television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Lestrade was played by Bill Owen.
* Archie Duncan played Lestrade in the first American television adaptation of Holmes titled &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 1954–55. Much of the series was filmed in France. Duncan portrayed Lestrade in the same fashion as Dennis Hoey in the 1939–1946 films by Universal Pictures.
* Lestrade was played by two different actors in the 1965–1968 BBC series &quot;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes&quot;: Peter Madden opposite Douglas Wilmer as Holmes in the first series in 1965, and William Lucas opposite Peter Cushing as Holmes in the second series in 1968.
* Patrick Newell played him in the 1980 series &quot;Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson&quot; made in Poland. This had Geoffrey Whitehead as Holmes and Donald Pickering as Watson.
* Colin Jeavons played Lestrade in multiple episodes in the 1984–1994 Granada Television adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes stories, starting with &quot;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&quot; in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The character was portrayed as a capable, if slightly vain, career policeman with a prickly but ultimately affectionate relationship with Holmes – as evidenced in the dramatisation of the aforementioned &quot;We&#x27;re proud of you&quot; scene. So familiar did Jeavons become in the part that when he was unavailable for &quot;The Eligible Bachelor&quot;, Lestrade was replaced by another of ACD&#x27;s Yarders, Inspector Montgomery. Lestrade&#x27;s absence was explained as having gone to the Leamington Baths on vacation, and Holmes fumes that he hopes his wife was with him. This is an embellishment on canon, as Lestrade was never shown to be married or attached. In other episodes, Jeavons was given parts originally belonging to other detectives, such as &quot;The Adventure of the Creeping Man&quot; and extra scenes in &quot;The Master Blackmailer&quot; (their version of &quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot;). Lestrade was even mentioned off-screen in the scripts, emphasising his close relationship with 221B Baker Street. Jeavons&#x27; portrayal is considered the most faithful to the Canon. In &quot;Starring Sherlock Holmes&quot; David Stuart Davies wrote, &quot;Lestrade was played with great panache throughout the Granada series by Colin Jeavons, who humanised and enhanced Doyle&#x27;s sketchy portrait of the Inspector.&quot;
* John Colicos is credited as playing &quot;Lestrade/Moriarty&quot; in the 1989 episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; titled &quot;My Dear Watson&quot;. Late in the episode, it is revealed that &quot;Lestrade&quot; is actually Moriarty in disguise. The real Lestrade does not appear in person in the episode.
* In the TV show &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; (1999–2001) one of the main characters was Inspector Beth Lestrade, played by Akiko Morison. She is a descendant who is quite efficient in her own way and has inherited Doctor Watson&#x27;s diaries.
* In the 2010–2017 BBC TV series &quot;Sherlock&quot;, Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade is played by Rupert Graves. In this series set in contemporary London, Lestrade is depicted as a competent detective who uses Sherlock Holmes as a consultant on difficult cases.
* Sean Pertwee plays Lestrade in the 2013 season two premiere of &quot;Elementary&quot;, where his first name is given as Gareth. His character recurs later in the season, as well.
* Mikhail Boyarsky played the role of Inspector Lestrade in the Russian TV adaptation, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2013).
*In the 2014 NHK puppetry television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Lestrade is a tall, slender, and earnest blond schoolboy with the atmosphere of mod who lives in Cooper house of Beeton School. He often solves a trouble with Holmes for he is a member of life guidance committee. Though he and Holmes trust each other, Grimesby Roylott, who is in charge of the committee hates Holmes. In some cases, he requests Holmes to solve troubles. He is voiced by Daisuke Kishio. In the episode 6 of the series, he tells Holmes and Watson that his given name is Gordon.

Each episode had Lestrade team up with a different fictional Victorian detective, Sherlock Holmes&#x27; &quot;Rivals&quot; in the field. The series returned in 2013, but the role of Lestrade was recast and played by Tim Pigott-Smith due to James Fleet&#x27;s unavailability.

===Print===
* In the 1979 book &quot;Sherlock Holmes: The Man and His World&quot; by H. R. F. Keating, Keating notes that despite Holmes&#x27; accusations of his lack of observational skills, he knows Holmes craves the outré and uses this to collect his interest in the case of &quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons&quot;.
* The author M. J. Trow wrote a series of seventeen books using Lestrade as the central character, beginning with &quot;The Adventures of Inspector Lestrade&quot; in 1985. In these stories, Trow shows Lestrade to be a more than capable detective. He is given a first name, &quot;Sholto&quot;, a young daughter whom he seldom sees, and a series of adventures set against a historical backdrop. In one book Lestrade meets G. K. Chesterton and in another he suffers a broken leg in a fall from the gangplank of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.
* In the novel &quot;The Canary Trainer&quot; (1993), Sherlock Holmes uses &quot;Inspector Lestrade&quot; as an alias while investigating the phantom of the Paris Opera while incognito.
* Lestrade is a recurring character in the Moonstone Books versions of Sherlock Holmes adventures. His &quot;We&#x27;re proud of you&quot; speech is adapted for a scene in Holmes&#x27; birthday in &quot;Return of the Devil&quot; (2004).
* He appears in the book series &quot;The Boy Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2007–2012) as the son of a ferret-faced inspector by the same name who dislikes Sherlock greatly.
* Holmes also used the alias Inspector Lestrade in the pastiche, &quot;The Counterfeit Detective&quot; (2016) by Stuart Douglas.

* In the blaxploitation comic book series &quot;Watson and Holmes,&quot; Lestrade is re-imagined as Detective Leslie Straude, one of the series&#x27; few white recurring characters. Other than the gender swap and name change, she is very similar to the original character.

==In popular culture==
Agatha Christie modelled her police detective character Inspector Japp, who appears in the stories featuring private detective Hercule Poirot, after Inspector Lestrade. Similar to Lestrade, Japp is described as &quot;a little, sharp, dark, ferret-faced man&quot; in Christie&#x27;s 1920 novel &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;. In her autobiography, Christie stated that she wrote her early Poirot stories &quot;in the Sherlock Holmes tradition—eccentric detective, stooge assistant, with a Lestrade-type Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Japp&quot;.

A search engine, the Inspector Lestrade, is used by MacIntosh, a &quot;fast, lightweight meta searcher.&quot;

&quot;The Inspector Lestrade Award&quot; is a rising term among message boards for a person who is &quot;almost correct.&quot; It has shown up on zdnet and &quot;Bad Astronomy and the Universe Today&quot; forum.

The Peterson Pipes company has a Sherlock Holmes (Return) Series of handmade pipes with silverwork. Two Lestrade pipes are in the collection.

<doc id="1252253" wikidata="Q131383" url="?curid=1252253" title="Ceratosauria">
<text>Ceratosaurs are members of the clade Ceratosauria, a group of dinosaurs defined as all theropods sharing a more recent common ancestor with &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; than with birds. The oldest known ceratosaur, &quot;Saltriovenator&quot;, dates to the earliest part of the Jurassic, around 199 million years ago. Ceratosauria includes three major clades: Ceratosauridae, Noasauridae, and Abelisauridae, found primarily (though not exclusively) in the Southern Hemisphere. Originally, Ceratosauria included the above dinosaurs plus the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic Coelophysoidea and Dilophosauridae, implying a much earlier divergence of ceratosaurs from other theropods. However, most recent studies have shown that coelophysoids and dilophosaurids do not form a natural group with other ceratosaurs, and are excluded from this group.

Ceratosauria derives its names from the type species, &quot;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&quot;, described by O.C. Marsh in 1884. A moderately large predator from the Late Jurassic, &quot;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&quot;, was the first ceratosaur to be discovered. Ceratosaurs are generally moderately large in size, with some exceptions like the larger &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; and the significantly smaller noasaurs. The major defining characteristics of Ceratosauria include a robust skull with increased ornamentation or height and a shortening of the arms. Both of these characteristics are generally accentuated in later members of the group, such as the abelisaurs, whereas more basal species such as &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; appear more similar to other basal theropods. The highly fragmented nature of the ceratosaur fossil record means that the characteristics, relationships, and early history of Ceratosauria remain mysterious and highly debated.
== History of study ==

Ceratosauria was first described by O.C. Marsh in the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot; in 1884. Writing about the newly discovered &quot;C. nasicornis&quot;, he noted the similarities between the firmly united metatarsals of &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; and those of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. Since &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; was the only other dinosaur discovered at the time to share this trait, Marsh concluded that Ceratosauria must be placed very near &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and its related groups. Marsh also named the family Ceratosauridae in 1884 to contain &quot;C. nasicornis&quot;. Since then, a number of other species have been referred to this family, mainly from the genus &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;.

The idea of the Ceratosauria would be contested by Marsh&#x27;s rival, Edward Drinker Cope. Cope argued that the taxon was invalid. The idea of the Ceratosauria would regain some support more than thirty years later when Gilmore argued in its favor in 1920. Despite Gilmore&#x27;s support, few species were added to the group following World War I, and little emphasis was placed on it. In fact, the scientific community&#x27;s most common interaction with Ceratosauria throughout much of the 20th century was the disputation of its existence, performed by the likes of Romer, Lapparent, Lavocat, Colbert, and Charig amongst others.

Ceratosauria&#x27;s fortune changed in 1986 when Jacques Gauthier, in an attempt to clarify the evolution of birds, grouped the majority of theropods into either Ceratosauria or Tetanurae. In Ceratosauria, he placed the ceratosaurs and coelophysoids. Gauthier&#x27;s paper brought Ceratosauria&#x27;s use back in vogue, and by the early 1990s, Abelisauridae had also been included under Ceratosauria. The triumvirate model of ceratosaurs, coelophysoids, and abelisaurids would go unchallenged until the early 2000s. Beginning at the turn of the millennium, a large number of paleontologists began excluding coelophysoids from Ceratosauria. This view is now widely held thanks to several similarities between Ceratosauria and Tetanurae not found in coelophysoids.
== Phylogeny ==

Most paleontologists have postulated that Ceratosauria split off from other theropods in the Late Triassic or earliest Jurassic. Despite this, no ceratosaurs have been discovered prior to the Early Jurassic, and even in the Middle Jurassic, species are sparse. Many scientists, such as Carrano and Sampson, have postulated the lack of specimens is due to a poor fossil record, rather than an indictment on the abundance of ceratosaurs at the time. A similarly large gap of specimens exist in the lower Cretaceous, particularly for Abelisauridae. More recent discoveries have resulted in varying phylogenetic results concerning the relationships between &quot;Elaphrosaurus&quot; and the derived Cretaceous noasaurids. The precise relationship between &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and the abelisaurids is also not clearly resolved.

Currently, most paleontologists agree that Ceratosauria contains a slightly more exclusive clade, Neoceratosauria, which contains the groups Ceratosauridae and Abelisauroidea, with some variance as to which taxa are placed into basal polytomy. Abelisauroidea is further divided into the Abelisauridae and Noasauridae, with Abelisauridae, including Carnotaurinae. Recently, Rauhut and Carrano have placed Elaphrosaurinae inside Noasauridae while simultaneously moving the previous noasaurs into Noasaurinae. Into their new Noasauridae, they have uniquely included &quot;Deltadromeus&quot; and &quot;Limusaurus&quot;.

It is difficult to discern possible synapomorphies of Ceratosauridae from autapomorphies of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; because the remains of the related &quot;Genyodectes&quot; are so fragmentary; e.g. &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; is different from other ceratosaurians by the very prominent horn on its snout; &quot;Genyodectes&quot;, however, was not found with a complete skull; whether it had a horn is unknown, so it cannot establish that the horn was a shared derived feature of the group. However, due to the shared similarities between the teeth of the two genera, synapomorphies have been recognized in the teeth. The synapomorphies that do exist include: overlap of the second and third premaxillary alveoli in palatal view, largest crown in subadults/adults higher than six centimeters, subquadrangular mesial denticles at two-thirds of the crown in lateral teeth. Currently the only generally-recognized ceratosaurid species outside the genus &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; is &quot;Genyodectes&quot; from the Cretaceous or Patagonia. The taxa &quot;Eoabelisaurus&quot; and &quot;Ostafrikasaurus&quot; are also probable ceratosaurs, but it is unknown if they belong to Ceratosauridae. Delcourt (2018) defined Ceratosauridae as &quot;the most inclusive clade containing &quot;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&quot; but not &quot;Carnotaurus sastrei&quot;&quot;.

Abelisauroidea is a diverse superfamily of ceratosaurians and the sister taxon of Ceratosauridae. It is typically regarded as a Cretaceous group, though the earliest abelisaurid remains are known from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina (classified as the species &quot;Eoabelisaurus mefi&quot;) and possibly Madagascar (fragmentary remains of an unnamed species). Possible abelisaurid remains (an isolated left tibia, right femur, and right tibia) were also discovered in Late Jurassic Tendaguru Beds in Tanzania.

Abelisauroids flourished in the Southern hemisphere during the Cretaceous period, but their origins can be traced back to at least the Middle Jurassic, when they had a more global distribution (the earliest known abelisauroid remains come from Australian and South American deposits dated to about 170 million years ago). By the Cretaceous period, abelisauroids had apparently become extinct in Asia and North America, possibly due to competition from tyrannosauroids. However, advanced abelisauroids of the family Abelisauridae persisted in the southern continents until the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event million years ago.

In an assessment of the phylogenetic position of &quot;Eoabelisaurus&quot;, the analysis found it as the most basal member of the Abelisauridae. Abelisaurid synapomorphies include the laterally covered lacrimal antorbital fossa, broad cervical prespinal fossae, anteroposteriorly short anterior caudal neural spines, absence of a ventral groove in the anterior caudals, presence of rudimentary centrodiapophyseal laminae in the anterior mid-caudals, reduced distal ginglymus in the manual phalanges, and the presence of a flexor depression in the pedal unguals. Alternative phylogenetic placements of &quot;Eoabelisaurus&quot; are significantly suboptimal, except for a slightly more basal position. Noasaurids had longer arms than their relatives the abelisaurids, whose arms were tiny and diminished. Although by no means as large or specialized as the arms of advanced bird-like theropods, noasaurid arms were nevertheless capable of movement and use, possibly even for hunting in large-clawed genera such as &quot;Noasaurus&quot;. Some genera such as &quot;Limusaurus&quot; did have somewhat reduced arms and hands, but far from the extent that abelisaurids acquired. Noasaurids were also nimble and lightly built, with feet showing adaptations for running such as a long central foot bone. Noasaurids varied in size, from the small &quot;Velocisaurus&quot; under long, to much larger genera such as &quot;Elaphrosaurus&quot; and &quot;Deltadromeus&quot;, which were more than in length.

The oldest known ceratosaur currently described is &quot;Saltriovenator zanellai&quot; which is dated to the Early Sinemurian, 199-197 Ma. The origin of Ceratosauria could have been in Northern Pangea where &quot;Saltriovenator&quot;, its close relative &quot;Berberosaurus,&quot; and &quot;Carmelopodus&quot; footprints have been found.

The following family tree illustrates a synthesis of the relationships of the major theropod groups based on various studies conducted in the 2010s and demonstrates the position of Ceratosauria within theropods.
The following cladogram shows the internal relationships within Ceratosauria following an analysis by Diego Pol and Oliver W. M. Rauhut, 2012.

A different conclusion was reached in a 2017 paper on &quot;Limusaurus&quot; ontogeny. Unlike other analyses, Noasauridae was placed more basal than &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, with the latter being within Abelisauridae by definition. This was later expanded on in a 2018 paper on ceratosaur paleobiology, which named a new clade Etrigansauria, which contained the families Abelisauridae and Ceratosauridae. The following cladogram is a consensus tree of the latest phylogenies shown in the paper.
Similar results were shown by the phylogenetic analysis from the describers of &quot;Alpkarakush&quot; in 2024, where noasaurids were recovered outside a polytomy of ceratosaurids and abelisaurids.

== Paleobiology ==
=== Anatomy ===

Some of the defining characteristics of Ceratosauria include an increase in height and ornamentation of the skull, as well as a shortening of the forelimbs. Likewise, ceratosaurs fused their ilium, ischium, and pubis together, as well as the astragalus and calcaneum. For less derived members of the group, such as &quot;C. nasicornis&quot;, traits such as raising of the skull and shortening of the forelimbs were not as noticeable. The skull of &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; was rather similar to the basal theropod mold, with a distinguishing nasal crest to go along with lacrimal crests similar to the contemporary &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; had larger teeth than &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, and some paleontologists postulate that it would have had a difficult time attacking larger prey. Abelisaurids, however, carried many of these defining traits to their extremes. Most abelisaurids had largely shortened forelimbs, with &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; having shrunk them further than any large theropod. After analyzing the features of the newly discovered &quot;Rugops primus&quot;, Paul Sereno has postulated that many of these abelisaurid features may lend themselves to scavenging. Despite the huge reduction in size, no taxa in Ceratosauria ever lost a digit or any critical elements of the forelimb. Some joint variation has also been observed in Ceratosauria, and it has been postulated that they may have had better shoulder mobility than other large theropods.

There are two known types of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; teeth: one with longitudinal ridges and the other with veined enamel. Both types of teeth have crowns with a teardrop-shaped cross section and carinae running up the middle. The cross section of the tooth&#x27;s base depends on the position of the tooth in the mouth with front teeth having less symmetric cross sections.

Complete skeletons have been described only for the most advanced abelisaurids (such as &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; and &quot;Aucasaurus&quot;), making the establishment of defining features of the skeleton for the family as a whole more difficult. However, most are known from at least some skull bones, so known shared features come mainly from the skull. Many abelisaurid skull features are shared with carcharodontosaurids. These shared features, along with the fact that Abelisauridae seem to have replaced Carcharodontosauridae in South America, has led to suggestions that the two groups were related.
Noasaurids were considered to be distinctive abelisauroids with a peculiar &quot;sickle claw&quot; on the second toe of the foot, convergently developed with that of deinonychosaurians. Among noasaurids, the Argentinean genera &quot;Noasaurus&quot; (Later Cretaceous) and &quot;Ligabueino&quot; (Early Cretaceous) are known from incomplete specimens, including disarticulated non-ungual phalanges and in &quot;Noasaurus&quot;, a claw. A detailed overview of these elements indicates that the supposed raptorial claw of the second pedal digit actually belongs to the first or second finger of the manus, and the putative pedal non-ungual phalanges or both genera also pertain to the manus.
==Paleoecology==
=== Geography ===
Ceratosaurs appeared to have had a global population that diverged by the early Jurassic. However, they appear to have largely disappeared from Laurasia in the Cretaceous, with those few specimens that have been discovered having been possibly reintroduced from Gondwana. No confirmed specimens of ceratosaurs in North America during the Cretaceous have been found.

Abelisaurids in particular had great success in Gondwana, particularly in the Cretaceous. Some Gondwanan and Laurasian specimens have recently been found and dated to Late Jurassic, and possibly even the Middle Jurassic, greatly extending the abelisaurid timeline. Some paleontologists have postulated that a large desert may have kept abelisaurids locked in southern Gondwana until the late Jurassic. Whether correlation or causation, it has been largely observed that late Cretaceous ceratosaurs were found less in areas dominated by basal tetanurans (Africa) or coelurosaurs (North America and Asia). The below phylogeny follows a simplified cladogram of Hendrickx et al. (2015), limited to Ceratosauria.
=== Diet ===

As with most theropods, ceratosaurs were carnivores—except for some noasaurs like &quot;Limusaurus&quot; and &quot;Berthasaura&quot;, which were omnivores or herbivores with toothless beaks. &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; has been argued to have eaten a large amount of fish and other aquatic creatures, though this has been disputed by many paleontologists. Tooth marks on large animals such as &quot;Allosaurus&quot; indicate that &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; likely utilized scavenging often. The interesting jaws of the abelisaurids have drawn mixed dietary predictions. One study on &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; found that its bite, thanks to its shortened skull, was suited for hunting small prey, thanks to a quick, but relatively weak bite. On the other hand, other groups of paleontologists have found that the bite of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was relatively powerful, and more adept at hunting and wounding large prey. 

Others have postulated its skull was built for scavenging. The debate over the eating habits of ceratosaurs is quite active, particularly recently with the increase in abelisaur discoveries. Using three methods, namely a cladistic analysis performed on a dentition-based data matrix, and discriminant and cluster analyses conducted on a large dataset of theropod teeth measurements, three dental morphotypes which are confidently referred to abelisaurid theropods are identifiable. Whether the morphotypes represent different abelisaurid subclades or different positional entities within the jaw of the same abelisaurid species, is unknown. Such an identification, nevertheless, provides additional evidence of abelisaurids feeding on sauropod carcasses.

Studies of &quot;Majungasaurus&quot; indicate that it was a much slower-growing dinosaur than other theropods, taking nearly 20 years to reach adult size. Similar studies on other abelisaurid genera indicate that this slow maturation may have been a common trait to the whole of Abelisauridae. Noasaurines are Late Cretaceous noasaurids known exclusively from southern continents and islands such as South America, Madagascar, and India. Elaphrosaurines were lightly built theropods, with small skulls and long necks and legs. If &quot;Limusaurus&quot; is any indication, adult elaphrosaurines were completely toothless, and their mouths were probably edged with a horny beak. It is likely that &quot;Limusaurus&quot; and other elaphrosaurines were primarily herbivorous as adults, due to mature &quot;Limusaurus&quot; specimens preserving gastroliths and chemical signatures resembling those of herbivorous dinosaurs.
===Paleoenvironment===

Being found in the Morrison and Tendaguru put the family Ceratosauridae in the presence of other large predators. In North America, it is likely that members of the family such as &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; competed with allosaurids (&quot;A. fragilis&quot;) for food, such as sauropods common to the region at the time. In Africa and Europe members also competed with other large predators for similar food sources. The presence of &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry along with the remains of several allosaurids is a good indication of just how close members of this family and other predators coexisted.

Most abelisauroid ceratosaurs were found in Madagascar, Asia, or sometimes in Africa. Abelisauridae thrived during the Cretaceous period on the ancient southern supercontinent of Gondwana, and today their fossil remains are found on the modern continents of Africa and South America, as well as on the Indian subcontinent and the island of Madagascar. In Madagascar, &quot;Majungasaurus&quot; was discovered by French paleontologist Charles Depéret. &quot;Majungasaurus&quot; was the most common abelisauroid which we know. In South America, many abelisauroids such as &quot;Skorpiovenator&quot;, &quot;Quilmesaurus&quot;, &quot;Aucasarus&quot;, &quot;Ilokelesia&quot;, and &quot;Pyconemosaurus&quot; are known. &quot;Kurupi itaata&quot; represents the first formally named vertebrate of the Marília Formation (Bauru Group, Bauru Basin) and one of the few theropod records for the Maastrichtian of the Bauru Basin. Its abelisaurid affinities are well established based on the anatomy of the pelvis and anterior caudal vertebrae; however, closer relationships with other abelisaurids are still unclear. The specimens provide new information on abelisauroids, which are still poorly known in the Brazilian fossil record, and on the distribution of this group of theropod dinosaurs in South America. These discoveries indicate that abelisauroids were the most common large predatory dinosaurs where they lived.

<doc id="1252256" wikidata="Q3027672" url="?curid=1252256" title="Inelastic scattering">
<text>In chemistry, nuclear physics, and particle physics, inelastic scattering is a process in which the internal states of a particle or a system of particles change after a collision. Often, this means the kinetic energy of the incident particle is not conserved (in contrast to elastic scattering). Additionally, relativistic collisions which involve a transition from one type of particle to another are referred to as inelastic even if the outgoing particles have the same kinetic energy as the incoming ones. Processes which are governed by elastic collisions at a microscopic level will appear to be inelastic if a macroscopic observer only has access to a subset of the degrees of freedom. In Compton scattering for instance, the two particles in the collision transfer energy causing a loss of energy in the measured particle.

==Electrons==
When an electron is the incident particle, the probability of inelastic scattering, depending on the energy of the incident electron, is usually smaller than that of elastic scattering. Thus in the case of gas electron diffraction (GED), reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), and transmission electron diffraction, because the energy of the incident electron is high, the contribution of inelastic electron scattering can be ignored. Deep inelastic scattering of electrons from protons provided the first direct evidence for the existence of quarks.

==Photons==

When a photon is the incident particle, there is an inelastic scattering process called Raman scattering. In this scattering process, the incident photon interacts with matter (gas, liquid, and solid) and the frequency of the photon is shifted towards red or blue. A red shift can be observed when part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the interacting matter, where it adds to its internal energy in a process called Stokes Raman scattering. The blue shift can be observed when internal energy of the matter is transferred to the photon; this process is called anti-Stokes Raman scattering.

Inelastic scattering is seen in the interaction between an electron and a photon. When a high-energy photon collides with a free electron (more precisely, weakly bound since a free electron cannot participate in inelastic scattering with a photon) and transfers energy, the process is called Compton scattering. Furthermore, when an electron with relativistic energy collides with an infrared or visible photon, the electron gives energy to the photon. This process is called inverse Compton scattering.

==Neutrons==

Neutrons undergo many types of scattering, including both elastic and inelastic scattering. Whether elastic or inelastic scatter occurs is dependent on the speed of the neutron, whether fast or thermal, or somewhere in between. It is also dependent on the nucleus it strikes and its neutron cross section. In inelastic scattering, the neutron interacts with the nucleus and the kinetic energy of the system is changed. This often activates the nucleus, putting it into an excited, unstable, short-lived energy state which causes it to quickly emit some kind of radiation to bring it back down to a stable or ground state. Alpha, beta, gamma, and protons may be emitted. Particles scattered in this type of nuclear reaction may cause the nucleus to recoil in the other direction.

==Molecular collisions==
Inelastic scattering is common in molecular collisions. Any collision which leads to a chemical reaction will be inelastic, but the term inelastic scattering is reserved for those collisions which do &quot;not&quot; result in reactions. There is a transfer of energy between the translational mode (kinetic energy) and rotational and vibrational modes.

If the transferred energy is small compared to the incident energy of the scattered particle, one speaks of quasielastic scattering.

<text>Ekwendeni is a town in the Northern Region of Malawi. It lies about from Mzuzu, in the Mzimba District.
Ekwendeni was started by Scottish missionaries; in 1889 Walter Angus Elmslie opened a mission station at Ekwendeni. It has one of the oldest churches in Malawi belonging to the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian (CCAP), the local equivalent of the Church of Scotland.

The general hospital began in the 1890s as a ministry of the Free Church of Scotland. Ekwendeni Hospital is operated by the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian – Synod of Livingstonia, in partnership with the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Church of Scotland and the Presbyterian Church of Ireland.

The people of Ekwendeni have Tumbuka as the dominant language but other languages are spoken due to the high numbers of people from other parts of Malawi settling there. Residents of Ekwendeni were often attracted there because of the hospital, the theological college, the college of nursing and the technical training school.

Ekwendeni is largely surrounded by tobacco growing farms. It has a high HIV/AIDS prevalence rate as it is a favourite resting place for truck drivers travelling along the M1 road that connects Malawi with Tanzania, Kenya and beyond.

Ekwendeni is booming with small businesses. International donors are helping in the development of this area. The town has beautiful surroundings which make the area a good destination for tourists.

<text>is a 2002 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Masaaki Tezuka, with special effects by Yūichi Kikuchi. Distributed by Toho and produced under their subsidiary Toho Pictures, it is the 27th film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise and the fourth film in the franchise&#x27;s Millennium period, and is also the 26th &quot;Godzilla&quot; film produced by Toho. The film features the fictional giant monster character Godzilla, along with an updated version of the mecha character Mechagodzilla, who is referred to in the film as Kiryu. The film stars Yumiko Shaku, Shin Takuma, Kou Takasugi, Yuusuke Tomoi, Kumi Mizuno, and Akira Nakao, with Tsutomu Kitagawa as Godzilla and Hirofumi Ishigaki as Kiryu.

Like the previous films in the franchise&#x27;s Millennium era, &quot;Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla&quot; is a reboot that ignores the events of every installment in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; film series aside from the original 1954 &quot;Godzilla&quot;. A direct sequel, &quot;&quot;, was released on December 13, 2003.

==Plot==
In 1999, 45 years after the original Godzilla&#x27;s attack, maser-cannon technician Lieutenant Akane Yashiro is unable to kill a new member of Godzilla&#x27;s species during her first fight with it, leading to her commanding officer and some of her fellow soldiers being killed by the monster. As a result, Akane is demoted while scientists, including single father Tokumitsu Yuhara, are gathered to build a bio-mechanical robot from the original Godzilla&#x27;s skeleton. In time, the cyborg Godzilla, Kiryu, is finished and inducted into the Japan Self-Defense Forces along with its human pilots, the Kiryu Squadron, with Akane as the primary pilot. However, memories of Akane&#x27;s actions during the original fight still linger as one of her squadron mates, Second Lieutenant Susumu Hayama, holds her responsible for the death of his brother.

Four years later, Kiryu is unveiled in a global presentation where its remote systems, use of command aircraft, and Absolute Zero Cannon are shown. Simultaneously, Godzilla returns and Kiryu is launched into battle. In the midst of this however, Godzilla&#x27;s roar causes Kiryu to experience memories of the original Godzilla&#x27;s death and destroy the city while Godzilla retreats. The horrified Kiryu Squadron is powerless to stop the rampaging cyborg until it runs out of energy and is brought back to headquarters for repairs.

Meanwhile, Akane deals with Hayama&#x27;s attempts to make her leave and Tokumitsu&#x27;s attempts to get to know her despite her desiring solitude, though she begins to develop a bond with Tokumitsu&#x27;s young daughter Sara. As Godzilla mounts another attack, the repaired Kiryu is deployed and confronts Godzilla once more. Kiryu gains the upper hand, but as it prepares the Absolute Zero Cannon, Godzilla fires its atomic breath, knocking the cyborg away and diverting the blast. With Kiryu disabled and the remote piloting system taken off-line, Akane orders Hayama to land his command craft so that she can use Kiryu&#x27;s internal backup cockpit. Before she leaves, Hayama wishes her luck, forgiving her. Piloting Kiryu directly, Akane closes in on Godzilla, hoping to use the Absolute Zero Cannon a point-blank range. As the two monsters collide, Akane uses Kiryu&#x27;s thrusters to propel them out to sea before firing. In the aftermath, a wounded Godzilla retreats once more while Kiryu is heavily damaged. With the Kiryu Squadron successful in repelling Godzilla, Kiryu is taken back to base for repairs. In a post-credits scene, Akane agrees to have dinner with the Yuharas and salutes Kiryu.

==Cast==
==Production==
Following the successful revival of the monsters Mothra and King Ghidorah the previous year, Toho elected to bring back Mechagodzilla for the next installment in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise. Unlike previous iterations of Mechagodzilla, this version is mostly referred to by the name Kiryu (derived from &quot;Kikai-ryu&quot;, the Japanese word for &quot;machine dragon&quot;) throughout the film. This was done to differentiate the character from previous versions. It was, however, referred to as &quot;Mecha-G&quot; and &quot;Mechagodzilla&quot; in the English dubbing of the next film, &quot;&quot;.

Japanese baseball star Hideki Matsui has a cameo as himself in the film, due to his nickname &quot;Godzilla&quot;.

As has been done since the early 1970s, Toho had the international version of &quot;Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla&quot; dubbed in Hong Kong. This dubbed version was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in 2004.

== Soundtrack ==
&quot;Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla&quot; the first film of the series with a soundtrack recorded outside of Japan. Director Masaaki Tezuka once again turned to composer Michiru Oshima following their successful collaboration on &quot;Godzilla X Megagurius&quot;, with the score itself being recorded by Moscow International Symphonic Orchestra, under conductor Konstantin D. Krimets. Tezuka and Oshima would both return for the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;&quot;.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla&quot; was released in Japan on 14 December 2002. The film was released in select theaters in the United States for one day on November 3, 2022 via Fathom Events to commemorate the franchise&#x27;s 68th anniversary, dubbed &quot;Godzilla Day.&quot; It pulled $335,000 for the latter release, a respectable gross for a film released only for a single night with no major advertisement beforehand.

===Home media===
The film was released by Sony Pictures/Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment on DVD on March 23, 2004. It was released under the American title, &quot;Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla - International Version&quot;, which has new English opening and closing credits but is otherwise the same as the original Japanese version.

Its second release was on Blu-ray by Sony as part of the &quot;Toho Godzilla Collection&quot;. and was released on September 9, 2014 as part of a 2-disc double feature with &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot;.

===Critical response===
Reviews of &quot;Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla&quot; have been positive. Mike Pinsky of DVD Talk gave the film three stars out of five, saying: &quot;While I did have some minor complaints, [this is] a fine entry in the series.&quot; Pinsky said &quot;the plot is more interesting than most giant monster movies,&quot; and &quot;the battle scenes, which are the main reason anyone watches these films to begin with, were great.&quot; Giving the film a &quot;B+&quot; score, Mark Zimmer of Digitally Obsessed said that it&#x27;s &quot;a good deal of fun and one of the better entries in the series.&quot; Digital Monster Island gave the film a &quot;B&quot; score, calling it &quot;a fun and exciting film that should please most kaiju fans.&quot;

<doc id="1252264" wikidata="Q1462530" url="?curid=1252264" title="Gilf Kebir">
<text>Gilf Kebir () (var. Gilf al-Kebir, Jilf al Kabir, Gilf Kebir Plateau) is a plateau in the New Valley Governorate of the remote southwest corner of Egypt, and southeast Libya. Its name translates as &quot;the Great Barrier&quot;. This sandstone plateau, roughly the size of Puerto Rico, rises from the Libyan Desert floor. It is the true heart of the Gilf Kebir National Park.

The name Gilf Kebir was given to the plateau by Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein in 1925, as it had no local name. It is known for its rugged beauty, remoteness, geological interest, and the dramatic cliff paintings-pictographs and rock carvings-petroglyphs which depict an earlier era of abundant animal life and human habitation.

==Geography and climate==
The Uweinat mountain range at the very south of the plateau extends from Egypt into Libya and Sudan.

===Wadis===
The plateau is crisscrossed by Wadis (dry, seasonal riverbeds). These include:
* Wadi Hamra 
* Wadi Akhdar 
* Wadi Bakht 
* Wadi Dayiq 
* Wadi Firaq 
* Wadi Gazayir 
* Wadi Maftuh 
* Wadi Mashi 
* Wadi Sura 
* Wadi Wassa 
* Wadi Abd el-Malik 

===Climate===
Gilf Kebir Plateau lies in the heart of the eastern part of the vast Sahara Desert, and, thus, gets some of the most extreme climates on Earth. This is the driest place on the planet, not only because the area is totally rainless (the annual average rainfall amount hardly reaches 0.1 mm) but also because the geological aridity index/dryness ratio is over 200, which means that the solar energy received at the ground evaporates 200 times the amount of precipitation received. Rainfall may fall every twenty years in Gilf Kebir.

==History==
===Petroglyphs===

The Gilf Kebir is known for its prehistoric Neolithic petroglyphs
* Rock engravings in the upper part of wadi Hamra.
* Magharet el Kantara in the southern Gilf Kebir contains only one known rock art site, a cave discovered by Shaw &amp; party in 1936.
* Wadi Sura in the southwestern Gilf Kebir: the &quot;Cave of Swimmers&quot;, discovered by the Hungarian Count László Almásy (&quot;The English Patient&quot;), plus many other paintings nearby.
* In January 2003, Zerzura Expeditions and Jacopo Foggini independently discovered a major new rock art site in the Western Gilf Kebir (Foggini-Mestekawi Cave).
* The North-western half of the Gilf Kebir aside from Wadi Sura has only a few scattered engravings, of an apparently very ancient age.
* Karkur Talh and Karkur Murr: major eastern valleys of the Uweinat contain one of the richest concentrations of rock art in the whole Sahara.
* Western Uweinat: Shelters under the huge granite boulders in the western Uweinat contain numerous paintings, including the famous sites of Ain Doua.
* Jebel Arkenu, Jebel Kissu &amp; Yerguehda Hill, the lesser granite massifs around Uweinat have many smaller sites.

Saharan rock art has been found to resemble the art of Nile valleys. The Saharan area was wetter until mid-Holocene or about 4000 BC, when the monsoon retreated southwards, forcing humans to migrate. Some retreated eastward to the Nile valley, taking with them their beliefs and influencing Egyptian art.

===20th century exploration===

The hills of the Gilf Kebir were first seen from a distance by European explorers in 1910 - with W. J. Harding-King in 1910 and 1911, and Ball and Lieutenant Moore in 1918. The high southern part of the plateau was sighted for the first time by Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein in 1925, and on another expedition, in the following year, he fixed the eastern escarpment of the plateau and first realised the true size of the plateau. In 1930 an expedition headed by Ralph Alger Bagnold followed the same route. In the winter of 1930-1, P. A. Clayton surveyed some of the areas.

The western side of the Gilf Kebir was explored in 1932 by the Clayton-Almásy Expedition, headed by Sir Robert East Clayton and Count László E. Almásy, and accompanied by Patrick A. Clayton, Squadron Leader H. W. G. J. Penderel, three Arabian car drivers and a cook. The expedition explored the area by Gypsy Moth plane, by car, and on foot.

1933 Patrick Clayton and Ladislaus Almasy discovered the &quot;Aqaba-Pass&quot;, the only way up Gilf Kebir from the southern plains i.e. from wadi Sura.

===WWII archeology===
The plateau was the site for various British logistical operations during the Second World War, and due to the extremely dry conditions and lack of population, remains of this occupation are often found intact. A large airbase, including huge navigation arrows laid out in army petrol cans, can still be seen at the Eight Bells Hills spot in the southeast of Gilf Kebir.

It was also the site of the 2007 discovery of a bag that had been lost in the Second World War by a dispatch rider (Alec Ross) of the Long Range Desert Group, part of the British Army. This contained the rider&#x27;s personal letters and photographs and had been well preserved.

==Literary setting==
The Gilf Kebir is the setting for part of Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s novel &quot;The English Patient&quot;.
It also plays an important role in Paul Sussman&#x27;s &quot;The Hidden Oasis&quot;.

<text>Pronto Monto is the third album by Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, released in 1978. The title is an approximate pronunciation of the French phrase &quot;prends ton manteau&quot;, which means &quot;take your coat&quot;. The album did not meet sales expectations, and the sisters were dropped from Warner Bros. Records soon afterward. In 2016, the album was released on CD by Omnivore Recordings.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the album has a &quot;shiny gloss, and it robs their songs of some of the innocence that distinguished them before.&quot;
