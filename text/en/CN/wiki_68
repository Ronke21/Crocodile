<text>Michael George Holmgren (born June 15, 1948) is an American former football coach and executive in the National Football League (NFL). He began his NFL career as a quarterbacks&#x27; coach and later as an offensive coordinator with the San Francisco 49ers, where they won Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV. He served as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers from 1992 to 1998, where he won Super Bowl XXXI, and of the Seattle Seahawks from 1999 to 2008. His last role in the NFL was as team president of the Cleveland Browns from 2010 to 2012. Prior to his career in the NFL, Holmgren coached football at the high school and collegiate levels.

Holmgren is noted for his role in molding quarterbacks such as Steve Young, Brett Favre, and Matt Hasselbeck during his tenures in San Francisco, Green Bay, and Seattle, respectively. Joe Montana won his two MVP awards under the direction of Holmgren in 1989 and 1990.

Under Holmgren&#x27;s leadership and play-calling, the Green Bay Packers were consistent winners and never had a losing season. He was considered one of the best coaches in the NFL by many fellow coaches and players. He led the Packers to their 12th league championship in Super Bowl XXXI, a 35–21 win over the New England Patriots; and also reached Super Bowl XXXII. Under Holmgren the Seahawks also became a frequent playoff team, including five division titles and the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XL. In total, Holmgren won eight division titles as a head coach to go along with twelve playoff appearances, three NFC Championships and one Super Bowl.

As president of the Cleveland Browns, Holmgren failed to improve the team, which had a record of 5–11 the season before his arrival, and 14–34 in his tenure. Despite Holmgren&#x27;s reputation as a quarterback guru, the Browns fielded three different opening-day starters in his three years with the team. In the face of much criticism in the media and new ownership, he was released by the Browns in November 2012.

He is a weekday daily guest throughout the football season on Seattle radio station Sports Radio KJR across various shows. As of 2021, Holmgren also works as a guest analyst for Super Bowl broadcasts on Westwood One.

==Career==

===Playing career===
Holmgren started out as a tight end before becoming a standout quarterback and punter at San Francisco&#x27;s Abraham Lincoln High School where he was named &quot;Prep Athlete of the Year&quot; in 1965 and graduated in 1966.

Holmgren continued his playing career in Los Angeles as a quarterback at the University of Southern California from 1966 to 1969, and was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. As a sophomore, he was on USC&#x27;s national championship team of 1967. Holmgren played behind starter Steve Sogge in 1967 and 1968. A shoulder injury put him behind sophomore Jimmy Jones in 1969; he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1970.

Although a backup, Holmgren was selected in the 1970 NFL draft by the St. Louis Cardinals; taken in the eighth round (201st overall), he went to camp with both the Cardinals and the New York Jets that year.

===Coaching career===

====High school====
Holmgren&#x27;s coaching career began in 1971 at his alma mater, Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco, where he also taught history. One year later, he moved to San Francisco&#x27;s Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory as a teacher and assistant coach. He also coached at Oak Grove High School in San Jose, California, from 1975 to 1980 and won one Central Coast Section championship.

====College====

In 1981, Holmgren became the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the San Francisco State Gators, working for Vic Rowen.

From 1982 to 1985, Holmgren was the quarterbacks coach at Brigham Young University under LaVell Edwards. During his four-year tenure at BYU, Holmgren not only helped coach the team&#x27;s potent offense to a national championship in 1984, but in that period mentored and developed two of BYU&#x27;s future NFL quarterbacks, Steve Young and Robbie Bosco, and one future NFL head coach, Andy Reid.

Bosco would make it to Green Bay several years before Holmgren, but his eventual appointment as Packers head coach would bring him back into contact with Andy Reid and Steve Young.

Under Holmgren, Bosco led the Cougars to a national championship in 1984, finished third in Heisman Trophy balloting and was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in 1985. Bosco&#x27;s NFL career was cut short by an arm injury, and he returned to BYU as a quarterbacks coach.

In addition to mentoring quarterbacks at BYU, Holmgren also worked with Reid, at the time a graduate assistant. Reid went on to become an offensive line coach at Holmgren&#x27;s previous school, San Francisco State, and in 1992 rejoined Holmgren in Green Bay as offensive assistant coach. In 1998, Reid became quarterbacks coach and assistant coach, then in 1999 was named head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.

====Professional====

=====San Francisco 49ers=====
Holmgren began his NFL coaching career as an assistant coach of the San Francisco 49ers from 1986 to 1991. He coached the 49ers&#x27; quarterbacks from 1986 to 1988 under head coach Bill Walsh, working with Steve Young, whom he had coached at BYU, and Joe Montana. When George Seifert took over as head coach, Holmgren became the team&#x27;s offensive coordinator and served from 1989 to 1991. In this stretch, Joe Montana won his two MVP awards and had his best season in 1989. During his tenure with San Francisco, the 49ers posted a 71-–23–1 (74.7%) regular season record to reach the postseason each year except 1991. San Francisco won Super Bowl XXIII over the Cincinnati Bengals 20–16 and Super Bowl XXIV over the Denver Broncos 55–10, setting records for most points, most offensive points, and margin of victory in a Super Bowl. As offensive coordinator in 1989, Holmgren&#x27;s 49er offense was ranked number one in the NFL. His years with the 49ers have led to later success mentoring other young assistants and Holmgren is one of the larger branches of the Sid Gillman coaching tree, from which Walsh and Seifert descended.

=====Green Bay Packers=====
Holmgren was head coach of the Green Bay Packers from 1992 to 1998, which became one of the most successful coaching stints in NFL history. As head coach of the Packers, Holmgren posted a 75–37–0 (67.0%) regular-season record, a 9–5 (64.3%) postseason mark, and two Super Bowl appearances, including a 35–21 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI. By winning at least one game in five consecutive postseasons (1993–1997) Holmgren joined John Madden (1973–1977), John Harbaugh (2008–2012), Bill Belichick (2011–2018), and Pete Carroll (2012–2016) as the only coaches in league history to accomplish the feat. Holmgren&#x27;s Packers posted an NFL-best 48–16 (75.0%) record, finished first in the NFC Central Division three times and second once, and set a 7–3 mark in the playoffs between 1995 and 1998. By taking the Packers to six consecutive postseasons (1993–1998), Holmgren set a franchise record with a team that had had just two winning seasons in the 19 years before he was hired. Holmgren is well known for molding quarterback Brett Favre from a wild gun slinger to a three time MVP from 1995 to 1997.

Many of Holmgren&#x27;s 1992 coaches, including Andy Reid, Steve Mariucci, Dick Jauron, Ray Rhodes, and Jon Gruden, would go on to head coaching careers in the NFL. Marty Mornhinweg, an assistant hired later in Holmgren&#x27;s tenure at Green Bay, also became an NFL head coach, and was previously an offensive coordinator under Reid with the Philadelphia Eagles from 2006 to 2012. Doug Pederson, a backup quarterback for Holmgren&#x27;s Packers from 1996 through 1998, would also serve as an assistant under Reid in both Philadelphia and with the Kansas City Chiefs, later winning Super Bowl LII as the head coach of the Eagles in 2018.

=====Seattle Seahawks=====
Holmgren resigned from the Green Bay Packers after the 1998 season to accept an eight-year, $32 million head coach contract offered by the Seattle Seahawks. Originally, Holmgren was the executive vice president and general manager and head coach of the Seahawks. Following the 2002 season, Holmgren was terminated as general manager.

Holmgren took the Seahawks to their first postseason since 1988 during his first season with the club in 1999, breaking a 10-year playoff drought. Holmgren posted a 72–56 (56.3%) regular season record and a 4–6 postseason record, including an AFC West Division title (1999), one NFC Wildcard berth (2003), four consecutive NFC West Division titles (2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007), an NFC championship (2005), and the Seahawks&#x27; first-ever appearance in a Super Bowl.

Holmgren&#x27;s (and the Seahawks&#x27; until they won the Super Bowl in 2013) best season to date was 2005. The team posted the best regular season 13–3 (81.3%) record in franchise history, set a team record 11 consecutive wins, and won their first playoff game since 1984. Holmgren also molded former Green Bay backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck into a Pro Bowl and Super Bowl quarterback in the 2005 NFL season (much as he did with Favre in the 1990s), and coached Shaun Alexander to the NFL&#x27;s MVP, a 2005 rushing title, and an NFL record 28 touchdowns in a single season.

With the 2005 NFC Championship win, Holmgren became the fifth member of a small coaching fraternity that has taken two different NFL franchises to the Super Bowl, joining Bill Parcells, Dan Reeves, Don Shula, Dick Vermeil, and later John Fox and Andy Reid. Had the Seahawks won Super Bowl XL, he would have become the first head coach in NFL history to win a Super Bowl with two different franchises, however they fell short, losing 21–10 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

On January 22, 2008, Holmgren announced he would serve out the remaining year of his contract with a year and end his tenure as head coach of the Seattle Seahawks at the end of the 2008 NFL season. Jim L. Mora, the defensive backs coach, succeeded Holmgren upon his departure.

On December 19, 2008, Holmgren received the Steve Largent Award, becoming the first coach in Seahawks history to attain the accolade.

===Post-coaching career===
On February 1, 2009, Holmgren served as an analyst for NBC&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl XLIII.
Since 2012, He has served as an analyst for Seattle Sports station KJR 950AM and as a color analyst for Westwood One&#x27;s radio broadcast of Super Bowl LI.

On December 21, 2009, Holmgren accepted the job to be president of the Cleveland Browns. On January 3, 2011, Holmgren fired Browns coach Eric Mangini after a disappointing 5–11 record. On October 16, 2012, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam announced that Holmgren would leave the team at the end of the 2012 season.

In 2015, Holmgren was in consideration for the New York Jets head coaching job, but removed himself from speculation after entertaining the idea. The Jets would end up hiring Todd Bowles.

In 2020, he was named as a coaching finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;Centennial Slate&quot;. He was again up for the class of 2021, but was among the coaches part of the final cut.

He was inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor on October 31, 2021.

In 2024, he was named as a coach finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1253161" wikidata="Q3104935" url="?curid=1253161" title="Ghost (Dark Horse Comics)">
<text>Ghost is the fictional superhero of an eponymous comic book published by American company Dark Horse Comics. The character appeared in specials and monthly titles detailing the afterlife of Elisa Cameron and her search for the truth surrounding her (apparent) death.

Ghost first appeared in &quot;Comics&#x27; Greatest World&quot;, week three, in 1993. After a popular special in 1994, a monthly title devoted to the character began publication in 1995. It ran for 36 issues, followed by a six-month break and a second series of 22 issues. The second series was a continuation of the first with a number of changes, including new details about Ghost&#x27;s origin. The stories in both series were based in (and around) the city of Arcadia, in a self-contained fictional universe outlined in Dark Horse&#x27;s &quot;Comics&#x27; Greatest World&quot;.

Ghost continued appearing in her own titles (and others) into the 2000s, including several crossovers unrelated to &quot;Comics&#x27; Greatest World&quot;. Most notable among these were a two-issue crossover with Dark Horse&#x27;s Hellboy (&quot;Ghost/Hellboy&quot;), and a four-issue crossover with DC Comics&#x27; Batgirl (&quot;Ghost/Batgirl: The Resurrection Machine&quot;).

== Premise ==
The series takes place in Arcadia, which is intended to be a grim, yet Art Deco city, as reflected in the artwork of the early issues. The body of protagonist Elisa Cameron contains nanomites which give her spectral powers. She becomes an assassin and her memories are erased. Now having few memories, she believes she is an actual ghost and adopts the alias of &quot;the Ghost&quot; in order to carry out investigations.

====Storylines====
* &quot;Special&quot;, &quot;X #8&quot;, #1–12: Reporter Elisa Cameron is dead. She gradually reconciles with her sister Margo, and moves in with her and their newly-sober parents. Her parents are later murdered by a shadowy psionic to dissuade her from a news story she was investigating. Elisa has a fondness for jade, which prevents her from &quot;ghosting&quot; (passing through objects). She can teleport (which she calls &quot;jumping&quot;), but must pass a hellish region to do so. Elisa faces a number of psionics led by Dr. October, a woman who wanted to eliminate Elisa for her beauty even in death. She also must deal with a demon (Cameron Nemo), who escapes from her &quot;hell&quot; (causing a great deal of destruction), before King Tiger helps her defeat him. Elisa learns that her jumps, her hell and Nemo are figments of her imagination. She slowly introduces herself to Peter, a man she sees visiting the graveyard. Elisa&#x27;s alliance with Barb Wire (a bounty hunter from Steel Harbor) results in her receiving a warning that Archibald Scythe (a psionic from her past) is coming for her. Margo falls under Scythe&#x27;s spell, while an all-female paranormal team (the Furies) joins with Elisa to defeat him. Margo, driven by rage, summons up strange &quot;shade-like&quot; tears which defeat Scythe (but cost her her life).
* #13–25: Crux (the man responsible for the deaths of Elisa&#x27;s parents) tries to remove Elisa, causing a panic in the underworld and seriously injuring Peter. Shortly afterwards Cameron Nemo escapes from hell and takes over Scythe&#x27;s body, becoming a lurking presence in her afterlife. Aided by X, King Tiger and Focus (leader of the Furies), Elisa discovers a tape with evidence of her death. Tracing the tape to Crux (who is planning to invade a secret city beneath Arcadia and recover a key which will give him power), Elisa and her companions help the Goblins (living in the secret city) by defeating Crux. Just before his death, Crux admits that he caused everything—from her parents&#x27; murders to the psionic hunters and Elisa&#x27;s death. Elisa then becomes Sentinel of Arcadia.
* #26–36: Dr. October resurfaces, but is quickly defeated. Peter and Elisa slowly develop a relationship while Elisa, aided by the Goblins, tries to protect the city. She encounters Dr. Trouvaille, who experiments with the spirits of his victims; he calls her &quot;the failed one&quot;, hinting that he knows secrets unrevealed by Crux. Margo, somehow alive and possessed by a being known as Silhouette, tries to destroy Arcadia but is saved by Elisa.

===Volume two===
====Creators====
The series was re-launched in the fall of 1998 with a new creative staff. An attempt was made to make the artwork sleeker, sexier and more beautiful than the previous series. Like the first series, the second adapted a mini-series approach. The following is a list of the staff; when repeated, only the surname will be used:
* 1–6: Chris Warner (writer), Christian Zanier (pencils), Steve Moncuse (inks), Ryan Benjamin (covers)
* 7–10 (&quot;Shifter&quot;): Warner and Mike Kennedy (writers), Zanier (pencils), Moncuse (inks), Benjamin (covers)
* 11–15 (12–15, &quot;Red Shadows&quot;): Warner (writer), Benjamin (art)
* 16–17(&quot;When the Devil Daydreams&quot;): Kennedy (writer), Francisco Ruiz Valesco and Benjamin (art)
* 18–19: Kennedy (writer), Benjamin (art), Denis Beauvais (cover)
* 20: Kennedy (writer), Benjamin (art)
* 21: Kennedy (writer), Benjamin (art), Beauvais (cover)
* 22: Kennedy (writer), Benjamin and Lucas Marangnon (pencils), Moncuse and Mike Henry (inks), Benjamin (cover)

====Storylines====
* #1–6: Elisa learns from the mysterious Concordia Leveche that she is not really dead. Instead, her &quot;death&quot; is linked to Scythe and Trouvaille (who are conducting experiments in which souls are stripped from their bodies, &quot;rendered&quot; and replaced with beings from another dimension). Trouvaille captures Elisa, and shows her the tape. From it, she learns that she killed Crux. Trouvaille, aided by Scythe, tries ripping Elisa&#x27;s soul from her body, but during the procedure Cameron Nemo briefly appears. Elisa then vanishes. Silhouette is back in control of Margo&#x27;s body while Margo&#x27;s soul awaits rendering. Elisa escapes and fights Silhouette, who escapes (still controlling Margo&#x27;s body). Elisa then kills Trouvaille. She has learned that Focus was in league with Trouvaille, and soon discovers the same is true of Peter. She suggests that he commit suicide, while Focus informs Elisa that she had been one of the Furies. Soon, she finds Cameron Scythe. Nemo (who reveals that as part of Elisa&#x27;s subconscious he has always known her) is returned to Elisa&#x27;s hell. Margo (now a being like Elisa) appears and shoots Scythe through the skull, killing him.
* #7–15: Elisa, Concordia and Margo go to Hoyo Grande to ask King Tiger for help. Instead, they help a depressed Tiger regain his energy and battle the shape-shifting Szothstromael clan. Elisa has a revelatory encounter with the man from the vortex, who &quot;reboots&quot; her brain. This enables her to remember that her biological father (Dan Deerlane) was shot by her adoptive father before her eyes when she was very young; the pain deadened her to that of others, leading to her life as a Fury assassin. Silhouette returns, using Trouvaille&#x27;s technology to transfer more beings into the bodies of Scythe&#x27;s remaining followers. Sent as ghost-hunters, they attack Elisa and her friends. Failing that, Trouvaille (whose body is dead but whose essence exists within his armor) joins them to defeat Elisa and complete his experiments. They take Margo and Concordia, but Peter returns to aid Elisa in her battle. Margo&#x27;s body is recovered, Silhouette is defeated, and Trouvaille and the hunters appear to be eliminated. Giving Peter the brush-off, Elisa leaves with her newly revived sister.

==== Special issues ====
Two special issues were published after Eric Luke&#x27;s series ended, written by writers who did not contribute to the regular series:
* &quot;Ghost Special 2 (Immortal Coil)&quot; (1998): Written by Martin Lodewyk, pencils by H. M. Baker, inks by Bernard Kolle, cover by Dave Stewart (featuring model Yvonne Epstein). Set some time after Silhouette appears, the Goblins have yet to return to Arcadia and a worried Elisa must rescue Barb Wire from a South American businessman (Mr. Borazzon).
* &quot;Ghost Special 3 (Scary Monsters)&quot; (1998): &quot;Mayfly&quot; written by Tom Sneigoski, &quot;Secrets&quot; written by Lee Swank. Both sections have pencils by H. M. Baker and inks by Bernard Kolle; cover by Baker and Kolle. In &quot;Mayfly&quot;, Elisa battles large insect-like creatures controlled by a woman who wants revenge for an accident during her youth. In &quot;Secrets&quot;, Elisa reflects on the secrets of people in Arcadia. A man she calls &quot;Bookworm&quot;, while seemingly innocuous in breaking into the library to read ancient books every evening, is really planning to raise a demon.

=== &quot;Resurrection Mary&quot;===
&quot;Ghost&quot; was revived as part of Dark Horse&#x27;s Project Black Sky with a new storyline entitled &quot;Resurrection Mary&quot;, which launched the third series in &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; #13 cover-dated June 2012. In the three-part serialized story, Elisa&#x27;s spirit is revived when two investigators from a &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;-like TV series, armed with an experimental piece of paranormal technology, investigate a cemetery where a woman in white (called &quot;Resurrection Mary&quot;) has been spotted. Eliza appears to have lost her memory; she and the paranormal investigators she befriends cover up her self-defence killing and resolve to solve the mystery of her identity. A notable change for this reboot is that the traditional setting of Arcadia was replaced by Chicago, Illinois. The serial concluded with &quot;DHP&quot; #15, after which Dark Horse published &quot;Ghost&quot; #0 in September 2012; this reprinted the three DHP chapters as a prelude to a new series, &quot;Ghost: In the Smoke and Din&quot;.

===Volume Three (&quot;In the Smoke and Din&quot;)===

<doc id="1253168" wikidata="Q216585" url="?curid=1253168" title="Spa 24 Hours">
<text>The 24 Hours of Spa is an endurance racing event for cars held annually since 1924 at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Stavelot, Belgium. It is currently sponsored by CrowdStrike.

==History==
The Spa 24 Hours was conceived by Jules de Their and Henri Langlois Van Ophem just one year after the inaugural 24 Hours of Le Mans was run. It debuted in 1924 over a circuit on public roads between the towns of Francorchamps, Malmedy and Stavelot, under the auspices of the Royal Automobile Club of Belgium (RACB). The present circuit was inaugurated in 1979 with only slight variations since then.

The Spa 24 Hours was part of the European Touring Car Championship from 1966 to 1973, again in 1976 and from 1982 to 1988 (with the exception of 1987 when it was part of the inaugural World Touring Car Championship). The event also counted towards the World Sportscar Championship in 1953 and the World Endurance Championship in 1981. As on the Nürburgring, both a 24h and a 1000 km race is held at Spa, as the 1000 km Spa for sports car racing were introduced in 1966.

Cars entered have spanned from the Russian Moskvitch and models with sub-1 liter engines such as the NSU Prinz TT to the luxurious V8-powered Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3. Tuned by Mercedes-AMG, the 6834 cc and so-called &quot;Red pig&quot; finished as high as second in 1971.

During the 1975 race, Dutch driver Wim Boshuis and a track marshal were killed in two separate incidents. Boshuis was killed when his vehicle collided with other cars on the track, while the track marshal was killed 30 minutes later when Belgian driver Alain Peltier collided with a railing.

With the participation of Swiss Lilian Bryner on the victorious Ferrari 550 of the &quot;BMS Scuderia Italia&quot; team, the 2004 race marked the first time in history that a female driver was part of the winning team of a 24-hour endurance race in a Gran Turismo with more than .

The current version of the Spa 24 Hours is an event under the GT World Challenge Europe Powered by AWS and Intercontinental GT Challenge calendar, although it was previously run as part of the FIA GT Championship featuring GT1 and GT2 machinery, and by various touring car series. Currently, the cars run fall under the FIA GT3 and GT3 Cup classifications. It has also been a round of the SRO Group&#x27;s Intercontinental GT Challenge since its inaugural season in 2016.

2020 saw the race held behind closed doors for the first time due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2023 Belgian Grand Prix, which is part of the 2023 F1 calendar released by the FIA on 21 September 2022, was scheduled on the race weekend of 28 July to 30 July and clashed with the Spa 24 Hours. This forced the Spa 24 Hours in 2023 to reschedule from its traditional late July race weekend to the race weekend between 29 June to 2 July.

===Coupe du Roi===
The best manufacturer wins the Coupe du Roi (King&#x27;s Cup), which is not necessarily the race winners. The cup is won by the manufacturer with the most points, accrued by cars that are made by the same manufacturer. For example, Australian car manufacturer Holden won the Coupe du Roi in 1986 despite their cars finishing the race in 18th, 22nd and 23rd positions outright.

<doc id="1253178" wikidata="Q520631" url="?curid=1253178" title="William Baumol">
<text>William Jack Baumol (February 26, 1922 – May 4, 2017) was an American economist. He was a professor of economics at New York University, Academic Director of the Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and Professor Emeritus at Princeton University. He was a prolific author of more than eighty books and several hundred journal articles. He is the namesake of the Baumol effect.

Baumol wrote extensively about labor market and other economic factors that affect the economy. He also made significant contributions to the theory of entrepreneurship and the history of economic thought. He is among the most influential economists in the world according to IDEAS/RePEc. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971, the American Philosophical Society in 1977, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1987.

Baumol was considered a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Economics for 2003,
and Thomson Reuters cited him as a potential recipient in 2014, but he died without receiving the prize.

==Early life==
Baumol was born in the South Bronx. His parents, Solomon and Lillian, were both immigrants from Eastern Europe.

Baumol studied at the City College of New York and was awarded his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1942. After college, he served in the U.S. Army in World War II and later worked for the Department of Agriculture as an economist.

==Education==

He was initially denied entry to the doctoral studies at the London School of Economics and was instead admitted to the Master&#x27;s program. After impressing onlookers with his debating skills at Lionel Robbins&#x27; seminars, he was within weeks switched to the doctoral program and also admitted to the faculty as an Assistant Lecturer.

==Teaching==

While a professor at Princeton University he supervised some graduate students who would eventually become very well-known economists, including Burton Malkiel, William G. Bowen, and Harold Tafler Shapiro.

==Research==

Among his better-known contributions are the theory of contestable markets, the Baumol-Tobin model of transactions demand for money, Baumol&#x27;s cost disease, which discusses the rising costs associated with service industries, Baumol&#x27;s sales revenue maximization model and Pigou taxes. His research on environmental economics recognized the fundamental role of non-convexities in causing market failures.

William Baumol also contributed to the transformation of the field of finance, and published contributions to the areas of efficiency of capital markets, portfolio theory, and capital budgeting.

===Entrepreneurship===
The place of the disruptive innovations and innovative entrepreneurs in traditional economic theory (which describes many efficiency-based ratios assuming uniform outputs) presents theoretic quandaries. Baumol contributed greatly to this area of economic theory. The 2006 Annual Meetings of the American Economic Association held a special session in his name, and honoring his many years of work in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation, where 12 papers on entrepreneurship were presented.

The &quot;Baumol Research Centre for Entrepreneurship Studies&quot; at Zhejiang Gongshang University is named after William Baumol.

In 2003, Baumol received the Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research &quot;[f]or his persistent effort to give the entrepreneur a key role in mainstream economic theory, for his theoretical and empirical studies of the nature of entrepreneurship, and for his analysis of the importance of institutions and incentives for the allocation of entrepreneurship.&quot;

The British news magazine, &quot;The Economist&quot; published an article about William Baumol and his lifelong work to develop a place in economic theory for the entrepreneur (March 11, 2006, pp 68), much of which owes its genesis to Joseph Schumpeter. They note that traditional microeconomic theory normally holds a place for &#x27;prices&#x27; and &#x27;firms&#x27; but not for that (seemingly) important engine of innovation, the entrepreneur. Baumol is given credit for helping to remedy this shortcoming: &quot;Thanks to Mr. Baumol&#x27;s own painstaking efforts, economists now have a bit more room for entrepreneurs in their theories.&quot;

William Baumol&#x27;s book, &quot;The Microtheory of Innovative Entrepreneurship&quot; is the first formal theoretical analysis of the role of innovative entrepreneurs.

==Textbooks==
Baumol wrote several textbooks in economics, including an introductory textbook with Alan Blinder titled &quot;Macroeconomics: Principles and Policy&quot;. His economics textbook on operations research was internationally well-received:

In the 1960s and 1970s, nearly every economics department offered a course in operations research methods in economics, and the usual textbook used was &quot;Economic Theory and Operations Analysis&quot; by W. J. Baumol. An entire generation of economics students was familiar with this book ...

==Professional and philanthropic interests==
Baumol was a trustee of Economists for Peace and Security. Baumol was known for his interests in the economics of art, including the economics of the performing arts.

==Death==
Baumol died on May 4, 2017, at the age of 95.

<doc id="1253185" wikidata="Q6941004" url="?curid=1253185" title="Reading Museum">
<text>Reading Museum (run by the Reading Museum Service) is a museum of the history of the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire, and the surrounding area. It is accommodated within Reading Town Hall, and contains galleries describing the history of Reading and its related industries, a gallery of artefacts discovered during the excavations of Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester Roman Town), a copy of the Bayeux Tapestry, finds relating to Reading Abbey and an art collection.

== History of the museum ==
Reading Town Hall was built in several phases between 1786 and 1897, although the principal facade was designed by Alfred Waterhouse in 1875. In 1879, the foundation stone was laid for a new wing containing a library and museum, and the museum duly opened in 1883. The museum displayed a large eclectic collection from the late Horatio Bland. Three art galleries were added in further extension in 1897.

In 1975, the civic offices moved out of the Town Hall to Reading Civic Centre. They were followed in 1985 by the Reading Central Library which left only the museum and the concert hall in use. After some debate, plans to demolish the Town Hall and replace it with a new cultural centre were abandoned, and in 1986 refurbishment of the building started. The museum was closed for renewal in 1989, reopening in stages from 1993 (the &quot;Reading: People &amp; Place&quot; gallery) to 2000.

== Principal galleries ==
===Story of Reading Gallery===

This documents Reading&#x27;s history, from its origins as a Saxon settlement in the 6th century up to today, with a mixture of oral history presentations, interactive displays and a mix of real objects from the period. There is an emphasis on Reading Abbey.

===The Silchester Gallery=== 
The gallery features many archaeological finds from the excavations conducted at the nearby Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester Roman Town) together with explanatory models and other information on life in the Roman town. This includes the bronze Silchester eagle that was immortalised by Rosemary Sutcliff in her children&#x27;s book &quot;The Eagle of the Ninth&quot;, first published in 1954.

The Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum was excavated in the 1860s, unearthing a diversity of finds including jewellery, fine glass and pottery, sculpture, mosaics, iron tools and coins. Many items found during the excavation are displayed in the gallery. Items of particular note include the Silchester eagle, the Silchester Horse and the damaged head of Seraphis. A model of the Roman town is also on display.

===Atrium===
This space provides seating around a Roman pavement mosaic from the Silchester site, where a 4th-century Christian church is thought to have existed. On the wall are displays of two large mosaics from Silchester. The mosaics are juxtaposed with ceramics of Alan Caiger-Smith produced at his Aldermaston Pottery.

===The Bayeux Gallery===
Reading Museum&#x27;s Bayeux Tapestry Gallery exhibits an accurate replica of the Bayeux Tapestry, made by 35 women of the Leek Embroidery Society in 1885. The tapestry is the only known full size woven copy of the original tapestry in existence.

The tapestry is 70 metres long and depicts the events of the Norman Conquest of England by William, Duke of Normandy in 1066. This includes the preamble to conflict, followed by the preparations for war and decisive Norman victory in the Battle of Hastings. Information boards around the exhibit offer a translation of the original Medieval Latin, while providing the visitor with a historical description of the conquest. The final section of the Tapestry, which included William&#x27;s coronation at Winchester cathedral, was lost before the copy was made. The events have a local significance to Reading, for King William&#x27;s youngest son Henry I founded Reading Abbey in 1121 and was later buried there in 1136.

The exhibit is complemented by information on the history of Saxon migration and Viking raids in the local area.

=== The Green Space=== 

The Gallery explains the geology and natural history of the Reading area through a large display of specimens. Exploring the history of the Reading area from 400 million years ago to the present day, it explains what was in the area before people existed and how Reading&#x27;s landscape and environment have developed and been influenced by human activity since the Stone Age.

The Gallery also shows the animals and plants living in the Reading area today. Highlights in the display include a complete Iron Age dog skeleton discovered and excavated at Blewburton hillfort; and a royal red deer stag which was donated to the museum by George V from the royal herd at Windsor Great Park.

===Huntley &amp; Palmers Gallery=== 

This gallery reveals the history of the biscuit-making industry that was once one of the mainstays of the Reading economy, with special emphasis on the Huntley and Palmers company, Reading&#x27;s world famous biscuit makers. The display charts how Huntley &amp; Palmers pioneered the mass production of biscuits and explains why Reading became known as the &#x27;Biscuit Town&#x27;.

The display shows what factory life was like for Huntley &amp; Palmers&#x27; thousands of employees explained through oral recordings, photographs and historic film, including the earliest surviving film of a British factory in action. Highlights of the display include about 300 decorative biscuit tins as well as advertising material and other artefacts; an African thumb piano crafted from a Huntley &amp; Palmers biscuit tin; a biscuit supplied to Captain Scott&#x27;s final Antarctic expedition, and an example of the rude ‘Kate Greenaway’ biscuit tin that continues to embarrass the company today.

===The Windows Gallery=== 
This Gallery is named The Windows Gallery as it is a &#x27;window&#x27; on the museum&#x27;s wide collection of sculpture and decorative art, ranging from Romanesque stones from the 12th-century from Reading Abbey to modern pieces by Rodin and Epstein.

Originally, this section of the museum housed the Reading School of Art and as such was designed to be well-lit by natural daylight from the windows on either side. Highlights of the collection include: 12th century Romanesque capitals from Reading Abbey; sculpture by Rodin, Epstein and Gibbings, and Delftware plates and other ceramics.

===The Sir John Madejski Art Gallery=== 
This is a recreation of the museum&#x27;s original Victorian era art gallery and houses changing exhibitions of artworks. It is named after John Madejski, the chairman of Reading F.C.

===The Exhibition Gallery===
This space is designed to house changing exhibitions, both from the museum&#x27;s collection and external sources. As an example, in late 2004, the gallery contained an exhibition on the history of the Reading Festival.

== Access ==
The museum is free to visit. As of February 2020, it is open from 10:00 to 16:00 on Tuesday to Friday, 10.00 to 17.00 on Saturdays, and closed all day Monday and Sunday, with exceptions for holidays.

== Charitable ==
Reading Foundation for Art was set up in 1974 with the ambition of building an art collection to enrich the lives of the local residents and enhance the cultural fabric of Reading and the surrounding areas. It now has a collection of over 150 works on permanent loan to Reading Museum and is a registered charity.

<doc id="1253187" wikidata="Q1806330" url="?curid=1253187" title="Lockheed Have Blue">
<text>Lockheed &quot;Have Blue&quot; was the code name for Lockheed&#x27;s proof of concept demonstrator for a stealth fighter. &quot;Have Blue&quot; was designed by Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works division, and tested at Groom Lake, Nevada. The &quot;Have Blue&quot; was the first fixed-wing aircraft whose external shape was defined by radar engineering rather than by aerospace engineering. The aircraft&#x27;s faceted shape was designed to deflect electromagnetic waves in directions other than that of the originating radar emitter, greatly reducing its radar cross-section.

To design the aircraft, the Skunk Works&#x27; design team leveraged the mathematics published by Soviet physicist and mathematician Petr Ufimtsev regarding the reflection of electromagnetic waves. A stealth engineer at Lockheed, Denys Overholser, had read the publication and realized that Ufimtsev had created the mathematical theory and tools to perform finite element analysis of radar reflection.

The eventual design characteristically featured faceted surfaces to deflect radar waves away from a radar receiver. It had highly swept wings and inward-canted vertical stabilizers, which led to it being nicknamed &quot;the Hopeless Diamond&quot;—a pun on the Hope Diamond. The first operational aircraft made its maiden flight on 1 December 1977.

Two flyable vehicles were constructed. Both were lost due to mechanical problems. Nevertheless, &quot;Have Blue&quot; was deemed a success, paving the way for the first operational stealth aircraft, &quot;Senior Trend&quot;, or Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk.

==Background==
In the 1970s, it became increasingly apparent to U.S. planners that, in a military confrontation with Warsaw Pact forces, NATO aircraft would quickly suffer heavy losses. This came as a result of sophisticated Soviet defense networks, which used surveillance radars, radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM), and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) to seek and eliminate enemy aircraft. Consequently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started a study on low-observability aircraft, seeking to design and produce an operational stealth aircraft. Five companies were initially invited, three of which bowed out early. The remaining two were later joined by Lockheed.

==Design and development==
=== Origins ===
The Lockheed &quot;Have Blue&quot; was born out of a requirement to evade radar detection. During the Vietnam War, radar-guided SAMs and AAA posed a significant threat to US aircraft. For this reason, strike aircraft during the war often required support aircraft to perform combat air patrols and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The 1973 Yom Kippur War again highlighted the vulnerability of aircraft to SAMs – the Israeli Air Force lost 109 aircraft in 18 days. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union developed an integrated defense network, central to which were medium- to long-range surveillance radars. SAMs and AAAs would be set up around key locations to defend them from incoming enemy aircraft. If the loss ratio of Israel during the Yom Kippur War was experienced by NATO forces during a military confrontation with the Warsaw Pact, NATO aircraft numbers would be depleted within two weeks.

In 1974, DARPA secretly requested answers from five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first was about the signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable. The second point was whether these companies had the capability to design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.

=== Design effort and early testing ===
Lockheed, having been absent from the fighter aircraft industry for 10 years, was not approached by DARPA in 1974. Ed Martin, Lockheed California Companies director of science and engineering, became aware of the research into stealth during his work at the Pentagon and Wright-Patterson AFB. Martin and Ben Rich, who at that time had recently become Skunk Works&#x27; president, briefed Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson on the program. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) gave Skunk Works permission to discuss with DARPA the stealth characteristics of the A-12, M-21 and D-21. On behalf of the company, Rich and Martin formally requested permission from DARPA to participate in the program, but the agency initially refused because there were insufficient funds; after much debate, Lockheed was allowed entry, albeit without a government contract.
Preliminary designer Dick Scherrer requested possible shapes upon which he could base his low radar cross-section (RCS) design. He was introduced to Denys Overholser, who recommended an aircraft with flat surfaces. Overholser later recounted his discussion with Sherrer: &quot;When Dick Scherrer asked me ... I said &#x27;Well, it&#x27;s simple, you just make it out of flat surfaces, and tilt those flat surfaces over, sweeping the edges away from the radar view angle, and that way you basically cause the energy to reflect away from the radar.&#x27;&quot; Scherrer subsequently drew a preliminary low-RCS aircraft with faceted surfaces. At the same time, Overholser hired mathematician Bill Schroeder, with whom he had a prior working relationship – in fact, it was Schroeder who trained Overholser on mathematics relating to stealth aircraft. Kenneth Watson was hired as the senior lead aircraft designer.

During the next few weeks, the team created a computer program which could evaluate the RCS of possible designs. The RCS-prediction software was called &quot;ECHO 1&quot;. As tests with the program proceeded, it became apparent that edge calculations by the program were incorrect due to diffraction. To overcome this, Overholser incorporated elements of research by Soviet engineer Pyotr Ufimtsev into the software. (In 1962, Ufimtsev, as chief scientist of the Moscow Institute for Radio Engineering, published a seminal paper titled &quot;Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction&quot;. The work had been translated by the US Air Force Systems Command&#x27;s Foreign Technology Division.)
ECHO 1 allowed the team to quickly decide which of the 20 possible designs were optimal, finally settling on the faceted delta-wing design. However, many within the division were skeptical of the shape, giving rise to the name &quot;Hopeless Diamond&quot; – Kelly Johnson said to Rich, &quot;Our old D-21 drone has a lower radar cross-section than that goddamn diamond&quot;.

In May 1975, the Skunk Works produced an internal report titled, &quot;Progress Report No. 2, High Stealth Conceptual Studies.&quot; Within it was a concept study called &quot;Little Harvey,&quot; including Kelly Johnson&#x27;s drawing of an aircraft with smoothly blended shapes. Johnson advocated for the use of blended shapes as the best way to achieve stealth, while Ben Rich advocated for faceted angles. Rich won the argument with Johnson, a rare occurrence.

The design effort produced a number of wooden models. A 24-inch long model, made of balsa wood, demonstrated placement of internal structure and access doors. An &quot;Air &amp; Space&quot; article noted &quot;The model shop found it nearly impossible to make all the flat surfaces come to a single point in one corner. Engineers later encountered the same difficulty fabricating the prototype on the factory floor.&quot; For early tests of the design, two ⅓-scale wooden mock-ups were constructed. One model, coated in metal foil, was used to verify ECHO 1&#x27;s RCS calculations, while the other was earmarked for wind tunnel tests. Afterwards, a model was moved to the Grey Butte Range radar-testing facility in the Mojave Desert near Palmdale, which allowed more accurate tests of the aircraft&#x27;s RCS. In the event, the aircraft&#x27;s RCS level confirmed ECHO 1&#x27;s predictions. This meant Ben Rich won a quarter from Johnson, who previously insisted that the D-21 had less RCS than &quot;Have Blue&quot;.

=== Experimental Survivable Testbed ===
In the summer of 1975, DARPA informally invited Lockheed, Northrop and McDonnell Douglas to develop an aircraft under the name &quot;Experimental Survivable Testbed&quot; (XST). McDonnell Douglas, having identified the thresholds at which aircraft were deemed undetectable, was unable to design and produce such an aircraft. Phase 1 of XST would see both Lockheed and Northrop build full-scale models to test their RCS, construct flyable vehicles, and wind-tunnel test their designs. Following Phase 1, a sole contractor would be selected to continue with the construction and flight testing of two demonstrators as part of Phase 2. Northrop&#x27;s and Lockheed&#x27;s designs were generally similar, though the former&#x27;s submission featured more angular and flat surfaces. The company used &quot;GENSCAT&quot;, software similar to ECHO 1, to calculate the RCS of its designs.

On 1 November 1975, Lockheed and Northrop were each awarded $1.5-million contracts to proceed with Phase 1 of XST. During a four-month period, the two companies were each required to construct full-scale wooden mock-ups, which would then be evaluated at the USAF&#x27;s Radar Target Scatter (RATSCAT) test facility at White Sands, New Mexico. To test the design&#x27;s radar returns, Lockheed erected a $187,000 specially built pole upon which the model would be perched. In March 1976, a Lockheed model was transferred to the range before being tested; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winner because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS. DARPA, having realized the progress accumulated throughout the study, urged the Northrop team to remain together. The agency would later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX), which evolved into the Tacit Blue and, ultimately, the B-2 bomber.

=== Construction and further tests ===

Skunk Works now had to design, construct and flight test two crewed demonstrators as part of Phase 2, or &quot;Have Blue&quot;. To build the demonstrators, Ben Rich had to raise $10.4 million from the Lockheed management, which was secured by June. Phase 2 encompassed three main objectives, which were the validation of: reduced visibility in the radio wave, infrared, and visual spectrums and reduced acoustical observability; acceptable flying qualities; and the &quot;modeling capabilities that accurately predict low observable characteristics of an aircraft in flight&quot;.

Construction of both &quot;Have Blue&quot; demonstrators used leftover tools from the C-5 program. Final assembly of HB1001 was originally scheduled to be completed in August 1977, before being ground tested until mid-October. The secret roll-out was envisaged to occur on 23 October, after which the aircraft would be dismantled and transported to the test area. On 1 September, however, with HB1001 partially complete, Lockheed machinists went on a four-month strike. A group of managers took over the job of assembly, which was completed in six weeks, with ground tests beginning on 17 October.

While superficially similar to the later F-117, the &quot;Have Blue&quot; prototypes were smaller aircraft, about one quarter the weight of the F-117, with a wing sweep of 72.5° and inward-canted vertical tails (inverse V-tail). Radar-absorbent material (RAM), developed in a Lockheed laboratory, was applied to the aircraft&#x27;s flat surfaces – for the windscreen, special coatings were applied to give them metallic characteristics. The aircraft&#x27;s gross weight of 9,200–12,500 lb (4,173–5,669 kg) enabled the aircraft to use the landing gear from the Northrop F-5 fighter. The aircraft&#x27;s powerplants were two General Electric J85-GE-4As from the T-2C Buckeye. Because stealth took precedence above all else, the aircraft was inherently unstable. As a result, a quadruple redundant fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system was integrated into the aircraft to give it normal flying characteristics. The flight control system was borrowed from the F-16. The overwing engine inlet was covered by a low-RCS grid; blow-in doors were constructed at the upper fuselage to admit additional airflow during takeoffs, when more air is needed.

Throughout the one and a half months after the start of ground tests, HB1001, the first of two demonstrators, underwent tests in preparations for the first flight. Flight instrumentation was checked first, followed by a thorough shakedown of the aircraft. In early November, two semi-trailers were parked parallel to each other outside Building 82; a camouflage net was thrown over the top to cover the demonstrator during outdoor engine runs. During the engine tests, a local resident complained about the noise, but &quot;Have Blue&quot; retained its secrecy. HB1001 received a layer of iron-coat paint; during the weekend of 12–13 November, the aircraft received a camouflage scheme devised by Alan Brown, &quot;Have Blue&quot;″s chief technical engineer. The scheme, consisting of three colors, each with three tones, was used to deceive any casual onlooker from recognizing the design&#x27;s characteristic faceting. The aircraft was disassembled, loaded onto a C-5, and on 16 November, the aircraft was flown from Burbank Airport (since renamed &quot;Bob Hope Airport&quot;) to Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada. Upon touchdown, the aircraft was reassembled before undergoing another round of testing prior to the first flight. After four taxi tests, HB1001 was ready for test flights.

== Operational history ==

=== HB1001 ===
HB1001 made its first flight on 1 December 1977 at the hands of Lockheed test pilot, Bill Park. He would fly the next four sorties, all chased by a T-38 piloted by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Ken Dyson. Dyson, an F-15 Eagle pilot, was previously approached by United States Air Force personnel about the project in 1976. He made his first flight on HB1001 on 17 January 1978, chased by Park. In fact, the two would be the only test pilots of &quot;Have Blue&quot;, alternating between the demonstrator and the chase plane. Flight test results allowed engineers to refine the FBW system. At the same time, they verified predictions made earlier by aerodynamic engineers on the aircraft&#x27;s behavior.

Flight tests proceeded fairly smoothly until 4 May 1978, when HB1001 was making its 36th flight. The aircraft pitched up just as it made contact with the ground which forced the pilot, Bill Park, to abort the landing and make a second attempt. The impact had however been so hard that the landing gear had become jammed in a semi-retracted position. Efforts to lower the gear were unsuccessful and Bill Park was forced to climb again, and eject when his fuel ran out. The aircraft was destroyed on impact in the vicinity of the Groom Lake facility. Park survived, but suffered a concussion, forcing him to retire from further test flights. Dyson, who was in the chase plane, recounted: &quot;Just before touchdown the airplane pitched up... It seemed it slammed down on the ground real hard... He [Park] raised the gear on the go around, and when he tried to extend it on approach, only one of the mains and the nose wheel came down. All this time, gas was being consumed... I suggested he climb up to 10,000 feet for ejection... He started climbing, but the engine started flaming out, from the lack of fuel, so he ejected.&quot;

=== HB1002 ===

At the time of the crash, HB1002 was almost complete, with the lessons learned from the HB1001 incorporated into the aircraft, including the rebuilding of the aft fuselage. HB1002 was distinguished from the prototype in having a gray paint coat. It did not have the flight test instrumentation boom present on HB1001&#x27;s nose. As the aircraft was used to test RCS returns, the unstealthy spin recovery chute was removed, and the aircraft was covered in radar-absorbent material. It first flew on 20 July 1978 with Dyson at the controls, who would be the only pilot to fly the aircraft.

HB1002 was lost on 11 July 1979 during the aircraft&#x27;s 52nd flight. A hydraulic leak caused an engine fire, resulting in the loss of hydraulic pressure, which in turn caused severe pitch oscillations. The pilot ejected safely, and the aircraft was destroyed. It was later discovered that an engine exhaust clamp had loosened, allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right engine compartment. The heat built up there, causing the hydraulic lines to fail. The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis Air Force Base Complex. Despite the crashes, &quot;Have Blue&quot; was considered a success.

=== &quot;Senior Trend&quot; ===

In October 1977, just prior to Phase 2 of the XST competition, Lockheed was tasked with exploring possible operational aircraft. Just a month later, on the day HB1001 was transported to Groom Lake, the Air Force awarded the company a contract under the code name &quot;Senior Trend&quot;. The Air Force wanted to exploit the revolutionary technologies developed during the &quot;Have Blue&quot; program. Tactical Air Command ordered five full-scale development and twenty production aircraft.

Based on the &quot;Have Blue&quot; demonstrators, &quot;Senior Trend&quot; aircraft were different from their predecessors in several aspects. The wings exhibited less sweep to resolve a center-of-gravity problem discovered during tests. The front fuselage was shortened to give the pilot a better view, and the vertical stabilizers were canted outwards from the centerline. Additionally, provisions were made to include two weapons bays, each of which would accommodate a single laser-guided bomb, or the B61 tactical nuclear bomb.

Beset by early construction problems, the first FSD aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake in May 1981 inside a C-5. Further problems, this time with fuel leaks, delayed the first flight. Under the control of Harold Farley, the aircraft took off on 18 June for its maiden flight, eleven months after the July 1980 first flight originally envisaged. The first production F-117A was delivered in 1982, and operational capability was achieved in October 1983; the 59th and last F-117A was delivered in 1990.

<text>A Month in the Country is the fifth novel by J. L. Carr, first published in 1980 and nominated for the Booker Prize. The book won the Guardian Fiction Prize in 1980.

==Plot==
The plot concerns Tom Birkin, a World War I veteran employed to uncover a mural in a village church that was thought to exist under coats of whitewash. At the same time another veteran is employed to look for a grave beyond the churchyard walls. Though Birkin is an unbeliever, there is prevalent religious symbolism throughout the book, mainly dealing with judgement. The novel explores themes of England&#x27;s loss of spirituality after the war, and of happiness, melancholy, and nostalgia as Birkin recalls the summer uncovering the mural, when he healed from his wartime experiences and a broken marriage. 

== Critical reception ==
In an essay for &quot;Open Letters Monthly&quot;, Ingrid Norton praised the novel&#x27;s subtlety:
The happiness depicted in &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; is wise and wary, aware of its temporality. When he arrives in Oxgodby, Birkin knows very well life is not all ease and intimacy, long summer days with &quot;winter always loitering around the corner.&quot; He has experienced emotional cruelty in his failed marriage. As a soldier, he witnessed death: destruction and unending mud.

But the edges &quot;are&quot; brighter for it. Birkin&#x27;s idyll in the country is brought into relief by what Birkin has gone through in the past and the disappointments that, it is implied, await him. Carr&#x27;s great art is to make it clear that joy is inseparable from the pain and oblivion which unmake it.
== Background ==
Many of the incidents in the novel are based on real events in Carr&#x27;s own life, and some of the characters are modelled on his family.

The jacket illustration shows Tintagel Parish Church in Cornwall, but the story is set in Yorkshire. The grave outside the churchyard wall was suggested by Tintagel, where a number of early graves were encountered at Trecarne Lands and excavated.

The text finishes with the words &quot;Stocken, Presteigne, 1978&quot;. Although the book is set in North Yorkshire, Carr wrote early drafts while staying in his caravan in the top orchard at Stocken Farm, just outside Presteigne in Powys, Wales.

==Dramatisation==

With a screenplay by Simon Gray, the novel was made into a 1987 film, directed by Pat O&#x27;Connor and starring Colin Firth, Kenneth Branagh, Natasha Richardson and Patrick Malahide. Shortly before his death, Dave Sheasby completed a radio adaptation of the book, which was first broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 Saturday Play in November 2010 and repeated in May 2012.

<doc id="1253192" wikidata="Q4668515" url="?curid=1253192" title="Abortion–breast cancer hypothesis">
<text>The abortion–breast cancer hypothesis posits that having an induced abortion can increase the risk of getting breast cancer. This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific opinion and is rejected by major medical professional organizations; despite this, it continues to be widely propagated as pseudoscience, typically in service of an anti-abortion agenda.

In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is altered by an abortion, then more immature cells could be left behind, and that these immature cells could increase the risk of breast cancer over time.

The abortion–breast cancer hypothesis has been the subject of extensive scientific inquiry, and the scientific community has concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer; and that breast cancer should not be a concern for women who are having a miscarriage or considering having an abortion. This consensus is supported by major medical bodies, including the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the German Cancer Research Center, and the Canadian Cancer Society.

Some anti-abortion activists have continued to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion as a cause of breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.

The ongoing promotion of a link between abortion and breast cancer is seen by others as part of the anti-abortion &quot;woman-centered&quot; strategy against abortion. Anti-abortion groups maintain they are providing information necessary for legally required informed consent, a concern shared by some politically conservative politicians. The abortion–breast cancer issue remains the subject of political controversy.

== Views of medical organizations ==
Major medical organizations which have analyzed data on abortion and breast cancer have uniformly concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer. These organizations include the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the German Cancer Research Center, and the Canadian Cancer Society.

* The World Health Organization concluded in 2012 that &quot;sound epidemiological data show no increased risk of breast cancer for women following spontaneous or induced abortion&quot;, updating their earlier finding that &quot;induced abortion does not increase breast cancer risk&quot;.
* The American Cancer Society concluded: &quot;At this time, the scientific evidence does not support the notion that abortion of any kind raises the risk of breast cancer or any other type of cancer.&quot;
* The U.S. National Cancer Institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, found that &quot;induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk&quot;, assigning this conclusion the strongest possible evidence rating.
* The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that &quot;early studies of the relationship between prior induced abortion and breast cancer risk were methodologically flawed. More rigorous recent studies demonstrate no causal relationship between induced abortion and a subsequent increase in breast cancer risk.&quot;
* The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reviewed the medical literature and concluded that &quot;there is no established link between induced abortion or miscarriage and development of breast cancer.&quot; The college recommended in its official clinical practice guidelines that &quot;Women should be informed that induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk.&quot;
* The German Cancer Research Center concluded in 2013 that abortion and miscarriage pose no risk of breast cancer.
* The Canadian Cancer Society stated in 2013: &quot;The body of scientific evidence does not support an association between abortion and increased breast cancer risk.&quot;

== Proponents ==

Joel Brind, a faculty member at Baruch College in the Department of Natural Sciences, is the primary advocate of an abortion–breast cancer (&quot;ABC&quot;) link. Brind is strongly anti-abortion and began lobbying politicians with the claim that abortion caused breast cancer in the early 1990s. Brind found that his lobbying efforts were not taken seriously because he had not published his findings in the peer-reviewed medical literature. He therefore collaborated with two anti-abortion physicians and a statistician to publish a 1996 article in the &quot;Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health&quot;, arguing that induced abortion was a risk factor for breast cancer. The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: &quot;I have some doubts. I don&#x27;t think the issue has been resolved. When we were talking about the conclusions, he [Brind] wanted to make the strongest statements. I tried to temper them a little bit, but Dr. Brind is very adamant about his opinion.&quot;

Brind&#x27;s paper was criticized in the &quot;Journal of the National Cancer Institute&quot; for ignoring the role of response bias and for a &quot;blurring of association with causation.&quot; The amount of attention the study received prompted a cautionary editorial by a JECH editor. With the appearance of larger studies contradicting Brind&#x27;s finding, Brind failed to convince the scientific community that abortion caused breast cancer. In 2003, Brind was invited to the NCI workshop on abortion and breast cancer, where he was the only one to formally dissent from the workshop&#x27;s finding that there is no link between the two. Brind blames the lack of support for his findings on a conspiracy, arguing that the NCI and other major medical organizations are engaged in a &quot;cover-up&quot; for the purpose of &quot;protecting the abortion industry&quot;.

== Proposed mechanism ==
In early pregnancy, levels of estrogen, progesterone, and estradiol increase, leading to breast growth in preparation for lactation. Proponents speculate that if this process is interrupted by an abortion or miscarriage—before full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimester—then more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.

Breast tissue contains many lobes (segments) and these contain lobules which are groups of breast cells. There are four types of lobules:

*Type 1 has 11 ductules (immature)
*Type 2 has 47 ductules (immature)
*Type 3 has 80 ductules (mature, fewer hormone receptors)
*Type 4 are fully matured (cancer resistant) and contain breast milk

During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules quickly become type 2 lobules because of changes in estrogen and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs in the last few months of pregnancy. According to the abortion–breast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.

Later on, Russo &quot;et al.&quot; found that placental human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induces the synthesis of inhibin by the mammary epithelium. Bernstein &quot;et al.&quot; independently observed a reduced breast cancer risk when women were injected with hCG for weight loss or infertility treatment. Contrary to the ABC hypothesis, Michaels &quot;et al.&quot; hypothesize since hCG plays a role in cellular differentiation and may activate apoptosis, as levels of hCG increase early on in human pregnancy, &quot;an incomplete pregnancy of short duration might impart the benefits of a full-term pregnancy and thus reduce the risk of breast cancer.&quot;

== History ==
The first study involving statistics on abortion and breast cancer was a broad study in 1957 examining common cancers in Japan. The researchers were cautious about drawing any conclusions from their unreliable methodologies. During the 1960s several studies by Brian MacMahon &quot;et al.&quot; in Europe and Asia touched on a correlation between abortion and breast cancer. Their 1973 paper published in the &quot;Journal of the National Cancer Institute&quot; inaccurately concluded that &quot;where a relationship was observed, abortion was associated with increased, not decreased, risk.&quot; Research relevant to the current ABC discussion focuses on more recent large cohort studies, a few meta-analyses, many case-control studies, and several early experiments with rats.

=== Rat models ===
Russo &amp; Russo from the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia conducted a study in 1980 examining the proposed correlation between abortion and breast cancer. While analysing the effects of the carcinogen 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) on the DNA labeling index (DNA-LI) in terminal end buds (TEBs), terminal ducts (TDs) and alveolar buds (ABs) of Sprague-Dawley rats in various stages of reproductive development, they found that rats who had interrupted pregnancies had no noticeable increase in risk for cancer. However, they did find that pregnancy and lactation provided a protective measure against various forms of benign lesions, such as hyperplastic alveolar nodules and cysts. While results did suggest that rats who had interrupted pregnancies might be subject to &quot;similar or even higher incidence of benign lesions&quot; than virgin rats, there was no evidence to suggest that abortion would result in a higher incidence of carcinogenesis. A more thorough examination of the phenomenon was conducted in 1982, confirming the results. A later study in 1987 further explained their previous findings. After differentiation of the mammary gland resulting from a full-term pregnancy of the rat, the rate of cell division decreases and the cell cycle length increases, allowing more time for DNA repair.

Despite the fact that the Russos&#x27; studies found similar risk rates between virgin and pregnancy interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious.

== Epidemiological evidence ==
The results of prospective cohort studies on the relationship between abortion and breast cancer have been consistently negative. Such studies are considered more reliable than retrospective studies and case-control studies. The positive association between abortion and breast cancer risk observed in case-control studies may be accounted for by recall bias.

In 1996, Brind et al. published a meta-analysis of 23 studies which reported a positive association existed between induced abortion and breast cancer risk. The authors estimated the relative risk of breast cancer among women who had had an induced abortion to be 1.3, compared to women who had not had an abortion. It was criticized by other researchers for multiple reasons, including allegations that it failed to account for publication bias (positive studies tend to be more likely to be published). The meta-analysis was also criticized because the studies it included were almost all case-control studies, which are susceptible to recall bias, and for which it is difficult to select an appropriate control group.

In 1997, Wingo et al. reviewed 32 studies on the abortion-breast cancer relationship and concluded that the results of studies on this subject were too inconsistent to allow for definitive conclusions, for either induced or spontaneous abortions.

A 2004 analysis of data from 53 studies involving 83,000 women with breast cancer reported no increased risk among women who had had either an induced or spontaneous abortion. The relative risk of breast cancer for women who had a spontaneous abortion in this analysis was 0.98, and that for induced abortion was 0.93.

A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies found insufficient evidence to support an association between induced or spontaneous abortion and an increased risk of breast cancer.

== Politicization ==

By the late 1980s, national politicians recognized that a focus on reducing access to abortion was not a winning political strategy. Some anti-abortion activists grew more aggressive and violent in the face of political abandonment, culminating with the murder of Dr. David Gunn in 1993 and the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in 1994. With direct action discredited, anti-abortion organizations, including the National Right to Life Committee, came to the forefront of the movement. These focused on legal tactics, including lobbying against late-term abortions and access to mifepristone and demanding legislation based on the purported ABC link. More recently, anti-abortion organizations have turned to lobbying to increase obstacles to abortion, such as mandated counseling, waiting periods, and parental notification, and some feel that anti-abortion advocates treat ABC as simply another tactic in their campaign against abortion. There have been ongoing and incremental legal challenges to abortion in the United States by anti-abortion groups. In 2005, a Canadian anti-abortion organization put up billboards in Alberta with large pink ribbons and the statement: &quot;Stop the Cover-Up&quot;, in reference to the ABC hypothesis. The Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation was concerned by the misrepresentation of the state of scientific knowledge on the subject.

The continued focus on the ABC hypothesis by anti-abortion groups has fostered a confrontational political environment. Anti-abortion advocates and scientists alike have responded with criticisms. The claims by anti-abortion advocates are sometimes referred to as pseudoscience.

During the late 1990s, several members of the United States Congress became involved in the ABC issue. In a 1998 hearing on cancer research, U.S. Representative Tom Coburn accused the National Cancer Institute of misleading the public by selectively releasing data. In 1999, shortly after the House debated FDA approval of the abortion drug mifepristone, U.S. Representative Dave Weldon wrote a &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letter, enclosing an article from John Kindley. In it, Weldon expressed concern that the majority of studies indicated a possible ABC link and that politicization was &quot;preventing vital information from being given to women.&quot;

, abortion counseling materials in Alaska, Kansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas incorrectly assert a possible link between abortion and breast cancer, while Minnesota materials correctly report no link. Similar legislation requiring notification has also been introduced in 14 other states. An editor for the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; expressed concern that these bills propose warnings that do not agree with established scientific findings.

Bioethicist Jacob M. Appel argues that the mandatory disclosure statutes might be unconstitutional on &quot;rational basis&quot; grounds. Childbirth is significantly more dangerous than abortion, data that is not required in any disclosure law but which is necessary for a meaningful understanding of risks. According to Appel, &quot;[i]f the roughly fifty million abortions that have occurred in the United States since &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; had all ended in full-term deliveries, approximately five hundred additional women would have died during childbirth.&quot;

In May 2017, President Donald Trump appointed Charmaine Yoest, an anti-abortion activist and proponent of the abortion-breast cancer link, to the post of assistant secretary for public affairs in the Department of Health And Human Services.

=== National Cancer Institute ===
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has been a target of the anti-abortion movement for the conclusions presented on its website. A report from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform found that in November 2002 the Bush administration had altered the NCI website. The previous NCI analysis had concluded that, while some question regarding an association between abortion and breast cancer existed prior to the mid-1990s, a number of large and well-regarded studies had resolved the issue in the negative. The Bush administration removed this analysis and replaced it with the following:

This alteration, which suggested that there was scientific uncertainty on the ABC issue, prompted an editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; describing it as an &quot;egregious distortion&quot; and a letter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services from members of Congress. In response to the alteration the NCI convened a three-day consensus workshop entitled &quot;Early Reproductive Events and Breast Cancer&quot; on 24–26 February 2003. The workshop concluded that induced abortion does not increase a woman&#x27;s risk of breast cancer, and that the evidence for this had been well established. Afterwards, the director of epidemiology research for the American Cancer Society stated, &quot;[t]his issue has been resolved scientifically ... This is essentially a political debate.&quot;

Brind was the only attendee at the workshop to file a dissenting opinion as a minority report criticizing the conclusions. He contends the workshop evidence and findings were overly controlled by its organizers and that the time allotted was too short for a thorough review of the literature.

=== North Dakota lawsuit ===
In January 2000, Amy Jo Kjolsrud (née Mattson), an anti-abortion counselor, sued the Red River Women&#x27;s Clinic in Fargo, North Dakota, alleging false advertising. The suit, &quot;Kjolsrud v. MKB Management Corporation&quot;, alleged that the clinic was misleading women by distributing a brochure quoting a National Cancer Institute fact sheet on the ABC hypothesis. The brochure stated:

The case was originally scheduled for 11 September 2001, but was delayed as a result of the terrorist attacks. On 25 March 2002, the trial began. After four days of testimony, Judge Michael McGuire ruled in favor of the clinic.

Linda Rosenthal, an attorney from the Center for Reproductive Rights characterized the decision as a rejection of &quot;scare tactics&quot;. John Kindley, one of the lawyers representing Kjolsrud, highlighted the &quot;individual&#x27;s right to self-determination&quot;. Kindley also wrote a 1998 &quot;Wisconsin Law Review&quot; article outlining the viability of medical malpractice lawsuits based upon not informing patients considering abortion about the ABC hypothesis.

The decision was appealed and on 23 September 2003 the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled that Kjolsrud did not have standing and affirmed the lower court ruling dismissing the action. The appeal said that Kjolsrud had not read the materials, and that after the lawsuit was filed, the brochures were updated to refute the breast cancer link, citing the National Cancer Institute.

<text>Delia Scala (born Odette Bedogni; 25 September 1929 – 15 January 2004) was an Italian ballerina, actress and singer who played a leading role in the nascent &quot;commedia musicale&quot;.

== Career ==
Scala was born as Odette Bedogni in Bracciano, Lazio, Italy. When she was a young girl, her family moved to Milan where she studied ballet at &quot;La Scala&quot; Ballet School for seven years. She performed in numerous ballets until World War II, after which she began appearing in motion pictures using the stage name, Delia Scala. These include &quot;Difficult Years&quot; (&quot;Anni difficili,&quot; 1948)&quot;, Side Street Story&quot; (&quot;Napoli milionaria,&quot; 1950)&quot;, Rome 11:00&quot; (&quot;Roma ore 11&quot;, 1952), &quot;Touchez pas au grisbi&quot; (1954)&quot;, Gentlemen Are Born&quot; (&quot;Signori si nasce,&quot; 1960).

In 1954 Delia made her theatre debut with &quot;Giove in doppiopetto&quot; (Double-breasted Jupiter). The show is considered the first &quot;Commedia musicale&quot;, an italian musical genre created by playwrights Pietro Garinei and Sandro Giovannini with the collaboration of the musician and songwriter Gorni Kramer. Scala later starred in &quot;Buonanotte Bettina&quot; (Goodnight Bettina&quot;,&quot; 1956) with Walter Chiari, &quot;L&#x27;adorabile Giulio&quot; (The Adorable Giulio, 1957) with Carlo Dapporto, &quot;Un trapezio per Lisistrata&quot; (A Trapeze for Lisistrata, 1958) with Nino Manfredi and Paolo Panelli, &quot;Delia Scala Show&quot; (1960), &quot;Rinaldo in campo&quot; (Rinaldo into the Field, 1961) with Domenico Modugno, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964) with Gianrico Tedeschi and Mario Carotenuto, and &quot;Il giorno della tartaruga&quot; (The Day of the Turtle, 1965) with Renato Rascel.

In 1956 Scala appeared in the TV show &quot;Lui e Lei&quot; (Him and Her, 1956) with Nino Taranto. In 1959–60 she co-hosted &quot;Canzonissima&quot; with Nino Manfredi and Paolo Panelli.

After twelve consecutive years of performances in Italy and Europe, Scala began to experience fatigue. In 1965, at the height of her success (she had received offers from Broadway), she suddenly decided to drop out from live performances. In 1966 she married and temporarily retired to spend time with her family.

In 1968 Scala made a comeback with &quot;Delia Scala Story&quot;, a show written by Garinei and Giovannini. This was followed in 1970 by the very successful &quot;Signore e signora&quot; (Mr. and Madame) with Lando Buzzanca. After a nine-year break, she starred in the show &quot;Che combinazione&quot; (What a Coincidence) alongside Don Lurio.

From 1980 to 1983, Scala conceived and hosted the show &quot;Una rosa per la Vita&quot; (A Rose for Life) to raise funds to support cancer prevention and research at the Bussoladomani arena in Lido di Camaiore, together with Raimondo Vianello and Sandra Mondaini, .

In 1982 Scala returned to television with the RAI fiction &quot;Casa Cecilia&quot; (Cecilia&#x27;s Home), where she performed for three seasons. Her final TV role was in the sitcom &quot;Io e la mamma&quot;, (Mum and I) aired between 1996 and 1998 on Canale 5.

==Personal life==
Scala achieved great professional success, but her personal life was marred by misfortune and tragedy. In 1946, at the age 17, she married a Greek military officer who had come to Italy to join the partisan forces in the fight against the Nazi-fascists. They separated two years later, and she got the marriage voided in 1956.

During the mid-1950s Scala was engaged with Formula One race car driver Eugenio Castellotti. He died in 1957 when his Ferrari crashed while attempting a speed record at the Modena race track.

In 1967 she married Piero Giannotti.The marriage lasted until 1982 when Giannotti died of a heart attack while cycling along the beach in Viareggio. She married a third time in 1985 with industrialist Arturo Fremura. The marriage ended with her husband&#x27;s death of liver cancer in 2001.

In 1974 Delia Scala was diagnosed with breast cancer, and underwent a radical mastectomy. Although she appeared to have made a full recovery, in 2002 she was struck again with the same illness. Scala died in 2004 in Livorno, Tuscany. She rests in the Cimitero della Misericordia in Livorno.

At the time of her death, Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi called her a &quot;model of enthusiasm and rigorous professionalism&quot; and said he rated her among &quot;the most beloved and popular artists in the history of Italian entertainment&quot;.

<text>The Grandmother () is a novella written by Czech writer Božena Němcová in 1853–1854 and first published in 1855. It is her most popular work and is regarded as a classic piece of Czech literature. This most frequently read book of the Czech nation was published more than 300 times in Czech alone and translated into 21 other languages.

==Plot==
The book describes, in an idealized form, the childhood of Němcová. The plot weaves together a remembrance of the agrarian calendar and customs of the neighborhood with the love stories of several women, which reveal more of the history and customs of that area. The main action of the novel seems to take place during the first one or two years after the Grandmother has come to live at the Old Bleachery with her daughter&#x27;s family, to help manage the household. The father is frequently absent due to his job as equerry to the local noblewoman, which takes him away to Vienna during the winter. The principal action of the story is to tell the intertwining tales of Viktorka, Kristla, and the Countess. The author is identified with Barunka, the eldest daughter of the Prošek family; however, the novel is not told from her point of view.

<text>Junior Samples, born Alvin Samples Jr. (April 10, 1926 – November 13, 1983) was an American comedian best known for his 14-year run as a cast member of the television show &quot;Hee Haw&quot;.

==Early years==
A sixth-grade dropout, Samples was a stock car racing driver and carpenter by trade who went on the radio at the age of 40 and told a story about catching the largest fish ever seen in his hometown. The story was a humorous tall tale, and the recording of this radio story became a best-selling novelty record, &quot;World&#x27;s Biggest Whopper&quot;.

==&quot;Hee Haw&quot;==
He was asked to become part of the 1969 cast of &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and created a bumbling personality, often stumbling or slow-talking his way through delivery, messing up jokes, and forgetting lines. One sketch of the show he appeared in regularly was &quot;The Culhanes of Cornfield County&quot; in which Junior, Gordie Tapp, Grandpa Jones and Lulu Roman would sit on a sofa and engage in a comedic deadpan routine: For example, in one episode each would talk about the new color TV set that had just been bought, but that they could not watch it, because they forgot they had no electricity in the house.

His five children also appeared in episodes during the early years of the show, playing the children in the &quot;Schoolhouse&quot; sketches and themselves in quickies.

===BR-549===
Samples&#x27; most famous bit was as a used car salesman, inviting callers to call an older five-digit phone number, BR-549, which in the show&#x27;s later years was changed to BR-1Z1Z. In 1993, BR5-49 was also taken as a name by an American country music band as an homage to the skit. The BR stands for Brenda Reece. She was friends with several actors on &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and when they were trying to come up the skit, they had 549, but didn&#x27;t know what to put with it. She suggested her initials, BR.

==Politics==
In 1974, Samples announced that he was &quot;seriously considering&quot; running for lieutenant governor of Georgia on a Republican Party ticket with then-Macon mayor Ronnie Thompson, who was seeking the party&#x27;s gubernatorial nomination. The media at first presented Samples&#x27; announcement as a political story. However, Samples was pulling a practical joke for publicity purposes. Thompson remained in the race and was defeated in the general election by the Democrat George D. Busbee.

== Personal life and death ==
Samples was married to Grace Carrie Bolton (April 27, 1927 – July 9, 2015), and they had five children together. Grace occasionally used Bolden as her maiden name and it was an official alias in legal documents. Junior, whose weight periodically neared 400 pounds (180 kg), was on &quot;Hee Haw&quot; for fourteen years, until he died of a heart attack in 1983 at the age of 57. His funeral was officiated by close friend Rev. Douglas Collins.

==Discography==
Throughout the years Samples recorded several comedy albums. Although he was best known for his television appearances on &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, his recordings were often heard on radio. His first break came in 1966 with the recording of &quot;The Whopper&quot;. He was nominated for two Comedian of the Year Awards from the Country Music Awards in 1969 and 1970, and made a number of other comedy albums.

<text>Baconin Borzacchini (born Baconino Francesco Domenico Borzacchini, 28 September 1898 – 10 September 1933) was an Italian racing driver who often competed under the &quot;nom de course&quot; Mario Umberto Borzacchini.

== Biography ==

Born in Terni in the Umbria region of Italy, at age 14 Borzacchini began working in a garage, training as a repairman. After serving in the army artillery during World War I, he began racing motorcycles before turning to automobile competitions in 1926. During the next two years he won six Italian hillclimbing events driving a Salmson. He earned victories at three significant Italian races including the Etna Cup at Catania and the 1100cc class at the 1926 and 1927 Targa Florio where he beat fellow up-and-comer Luigi Fagioli. Borzacchini&#x27;s success ultimately led to an offer to join the Maserati racing team and driving for them, he won the 1927 &quot;Terni-Passo della Somma&quot; and the &quot;Coppa della Collina Pistoiese&quot;.&quot; In 1928 he drove a Maserati to first place in the &quot;Coppa Gallenga&quot; hillclimb at Rocca di Papa.

On 28 September 1929, Baconin Borzacchini set a new flying land speed record of in a Maserati V4. That same year, he finished second in the Circuito di Alessandria and in the Tripoli Grand Prix. 

In 1930, under the fascist government of Benito Mussolini, Borzacchini was pressured into racing under the Italian name, Mario Umberto, rather than his birth name of Baconin, which was based on that of Russian revolutionary anarchist, Mikhail Bakunin, who his parents had admired.

Maserati entered the 1930 Indianapolis 500. Designed with a swept-back aerodynamic front end, a radical innovation uncommon at the time but commonplace today, some felt that Borzacchini had a good chance to capture the prestigious American event. Unfortunately, magneto problems forced him out of the race after just seven laps. Later that year, Borzacchini and his Maserati claimed victory at the 1930 Tripoli Grand Prix and won another hillclimbing event, the &quot;Pontedecimo-Giovi&quot; at Genoa.

In 1931 he signed to drive Alfa Romeos for Scuderia Ferrari where he became a great friend of team-mate Tazio Nuvolari. Although he won the Circuito di Avellino, Borzacchini&#x27;s season was dogged by both bad luck and the brilliance of Nuvolari. He finished second at the Targa Florio, the Grand Prix of Monza, and the Italian, Belgian and French &quot;Grands Prix&quot;.

At the 1932 French Grand Prix and the Coppa Ciano, driving the new Alfa Romeo P3 Borzacchini finished second behind team mate Nuvolari and third at Germany&#x27;s Großer Preis von Deutschland. However, with co-driver Amadeo Bignami, he won the gruelling Mille Miglia and wound up the 1932 season finishing second overall to Nuvolari for the European Drivers Championship. When Alfa Romeo decided to withdraw from racing after the 1932 season and sold its cars to Enzo Ferrari, Borzacchini rejoined the Maserati team, uniting with Luigi Fagioli and Giuseppe Campari. In March 1933 Borzacchini picked up where he had left off the previous year, finishing second to Nuvolari at the Grand Prix of Tunisia. In April he took another second at the Monaco Grand Prix, this time to the Bugatti of Achille Varzi, and then earned a third-place finish at the Avusrennen in Germany, also won by Varzi. At the 1933 Targa Florio, held at the Circuito Piccolo delle Madonie, Borzacchini set the pace with the fastest lap before an accident forced him out of the race.

== Death ==

10 September 1933 at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza was one of the blackest days in racing history. The Italian Grand Prix was held in the morning without serious incident, and was won by Luigi Fagioli. In an effort by the organizers to attract the largest possible crowd, another event called the Monza Grand Prix, using only the banked oval circuit, was staged in the afternoon. On a track dampened by a light drizzle, Borzacchini was vying with his team-mate Giuseppe Campari for the lead when Campari&#x27;s vehicle slid on a patch of oil and crashed over the top of the banking and went into the trees, killing him. Borzacchini tried unsuccessfully to avoid the oil, and his car spun down to the infield and rolled over. Borzacchini was taken to the hospital, where he died later that day. After race officials restarted the event the third tragedy of the day occurred when the car of Polish driver Count Stanislas Czaykowski blew the engine, caught fire and crashed at the same location, burning him to death.

During his years of racing, Borzacchini participated in more than one hundred events. Although his number of victories is considerably less than some of the other Italian racing notables, he was much loved and respected by his countrymen. In his honor, the circuit in Magione in the Province of Perugia in Umbria, not far from where he was born, was named the &quot;Autodromo Mario Umberto Borzacchini&quot;.

Borzacchini is interred in the local cemetery in his native Terni.

<text>Thomas Harmon Patterson (May 10, 1820 – April 9, 1889) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy.

==Early life==
Patterson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on May 10, 1820. He was the second son of Commodore Daniel Todd Patterson (1786–1839), a War of 1812 U.S. Navy hero, and George Ann (née Pollock) Patterson (1787–1851). Among his siblings were Carlile Pollock Patterson (superintendent of the United States Coast Survey); Eliza Catherine Patterson, who married George Mifflin Bache Sr. (brother of Alexander Dallas Bache), and George Ann Patterson, who married fellow Naval officer David Dixon Porter.

His maternal grandparents were George Pollock and Catherine (née Yates) Pollock and his paternal grandparents were John Patterson and Catherine (née Livingston) Patterson. His grandfather was the younger brother of Walter Patterson, the first British colonial Governor of Prince Edward Island. Through his paternal grandmother he was a great-grandson of Robert Livingston, the 3rd Lord of Livingston Manor.

==Career==
Patterson saw action in the American Civil War and later served as commander of the Asiatic Squadron (1877–1880). While in this latter post, he participated in the lengthy 1879 visit of former president and general Ulysses S. Grant to Japan at the conclusion of Grant&#x27;s around-the-world tour that started in 1878.

Patterson&#x27;s commands included &quot;Chocura&quot;, &quot;Currituck&quot; and &quot;James Adger&quot;. &quot;Richmond&quot; served as his flagship in the Asiatic Squadron. From 1873 to 1876 he commanded the Washington Navy Yard, as his father had done in 1836–1839. On January 2, 1868, Patterson was elected as a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Patterson retired from the U.S. Navy in 1883.

==Personal life==
On June 5, 1847, Patterson was married to Maria Montresor Wainwright (1823–1881). Maria was the daughter of U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Robert Dewar Wainwright and Maria Montresor (née Auchmuty) Wainwright, the sister of U.S. Naval officer Richard Wainwright, and cousin of Commander Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright. They were the parents of one daughter and three sons who survived to adulthood, including:

* Robert Harmon Patterson.
* Thomas Wainwright Patterson (1854–1858), who died in childhood.
* Daniel Walter Patterson (1858–1912)
* Capt. Samuel Achmuty Wainwright Patterson (1859–1933), USN, who commanded the Great White Fleet battleship in 1905. He married Margaret Sprague Davis (1860–1936), daughter of General William Watts Hart Davis, in 1886.
* Georgeanne Pollock Patterson.

After a long and painful illness, Patterson died on April 9, 1889, at his residence, 2100 G Street in Washington, D.C. His remains were interred in the Wainwright vault of Congressional Cemetery, with his wife, father-in-law, and other Wainwright relatives. His father and mother are also buried in Congressional Cemetery but under a separate Patterson monument.

<text>Clickteam is a French software development company based in Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine. Founded by Francis Poulain, François Lionet and Yves Lamoureux, Clickteam is best known for the creation of Clickteam Fusion, a script-free programming tool that allows users to create video games or other interactive software using a highly advanced event system. They are most known for publishing the first seven titles in the &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; series.

== History ==
Before founding Clickteam, François Lionet was the programmer of STOS BASIC, a programming language released in 1989 for the Atari ST, and AMOS BASIC, a more advanced language released in 1990 for the Commodore Amiga. Both of these have since been released in open-source form on the Clickteam organisation website. Yves Lamoureux was also a successful game developer prior to co-founding Clickteam, working with multiple companies on games.

Clickteam&#x27;s debut software was &quot;Klik &amp; Play&quot;, released in 1994 as commercial, proprietary software. A version for educational use, dubbed &quot;Klik &amp; Play For Schools&quot;, was also released as freeware, to be used exclusively for school activities. &quot;Klik &amp; Play For Schools&quot; was available for download in Clickteam&#x27;s website during the course of 2006, now being available for the public in general. Subsequent releases included, released in 1996, Clickteam&#x27;s second product, &quot;Click and Create&quot; later renamed &quot;Multimedia Fusion Express&quot; which included more advanced features which the original &quot;Klik &amp; Play&quot; lacked, such as scrolling, and a timeline editor, 3D game-making tool &quot;Jamagic&quot;; &quot;The Games Factory&quot;; &quot;The Games Factory 2&quot;; and &quot;Multimedia Fusion&quot;.

Clickteam&#x27;s most recent application is &quot;Clickteam Fusion 2.5 (CF 2.5)&quot;. This title is the successor to &quot;Multimedia Fusion 2&quot;, the company&#x27;s most well-received software application to date.

In September 2016, Clickteam partnered with the Humble Bundle and offered a &quot;Fusion 2.5&quot; centered bundle. Around ten games and Fusion 2.5 with various export modules were offered in the &quot;Clickteam Fusion 2.5 Bundle&quot;. Notably, for several games the source code was included.

In 2019, Clickteam released a new DLC for Clickteam Fusion 2.5, named Clickteam Fusion 2.5+. It introduced new features such as child events, which only run if their parent events are true, support for DirectX11, new output window in the debugger, a profiler, and more. The aim of Clickteam Fusion 2.5+ was to make it easier to manage and organize large projects, as well as to improve performance of games created with the software.

The Fusion series was designed to be a user-friendly yet powerful drag-and-drop game and application creation program, easily accessible to either those well-versed or inexperienced in programming.

<text>Magic Bus was a brand of the Stagecoach Group for local bus operations in the United Kingdom, usually operated on routes with strong competition from other operators. Until the rollout of the Bee Network, the brand was most commonly used in Manchester, though in the past, it was also employed in Glasgow, Newcastle, Liverpool, and Rotherham. A similar brand Magic Mini was also used in Corby, Ayrshire and the Scottish Highlands.

==History==

The name was first introduced in Glasgow in 1986, where ex London Transport AEC Routemasters were used on a route to Castlemilk. In 1992 this operation was sold to Kelvin Central Buses.

The brand was used in Newcastle around 1997 when trying to eliminate smaller companies operating in the area. The buses were prone to breaking down due to their age and broken down Magicbuses in Newcastle were common sights.

The Magic Bus brand was reintroduced to Glasgow by Stagecoach West Scotland in 2002. At its peak it was used on three routes; one was withdrawn in 2005, and the remainder in 2006.

It was also used more recently in Liverpool by Stagecoach Merseyside.

In April 2012, Magic Bus was introduced in Rotherham by Stagecoach Yorkshire on route 22 to compete directly with First South Yorkshire&#x27;s service of the same route number, albeit a slightly different route terminating at Manvers instead of Barnsley. Dennis Darts were used on this service. This service has since ceased due to low patronage.

===Manchester===
Shortly following their takeover of GM Buses South in February 1996, Stagecoach Manchester introduced the Magic Bus brand along the Wilmslow Road bus corridor in Manchester on routes 142 and 143, painting some of the oldest double-deckers in its fleet into a blue livery with yellow fleetnames. With fares reduced to £1 on the three services, eventually increasing to £1.50 in 2017, Stagecoach&#x27;s Magic Bus services proved highly popular with students at the University of Manchester. Buses used in Manchester included Leyland Olympians, Volvo B10Ms, Volvo Olympians and Scania N113NRBs, as well as some 3-axle Leyland Olympians imported from Stagecoach&#x27;s Citybus operation in Hong Kong (via a stint with Megabus) and Stagecoach&#x27;s Kenya Bus operation.

In 2006, Stagecoach Manchester additionally introduced the Magic Bus brand on route 192 to counter a bus war started by UK North. Following UK North being delicenced, the Magic Bus ceased operating on route 192, with services provided by Stagecoach returning to standard liveried buses.

In April 2010, Stagecoach Manchester purchased competitor Bullocks Coaches&#x27; bus operations, but the sale of Finglands Coachways to First Greater Manchester has ensured competition remain on the corridor. In September 2014, route 141 commenced, funded by Manchester Metropolitan University, to serve its Birley Fields accommodation in Hulme. This route was withdrawn in September 2018, after funding from MMU ceased.

In 2018, Stagecoach started operating route 147, from Manchester Piccadilly railway station to West Didsbury, after the expiry of the previous contract with Bullocks Coaches, with the route being extended from its previous terminus at the Manchester Royal Infirmary to West Didsbury, but now omitting the hospital grounds.

As of June 2021, Stagecoach Manchester ran 51 Alexander Dennis Enviro400Hs and one conventional Enviro400 on Magic Bus services on Wilmslow Road routes 142, 143 &amp; 147. During the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, services 143 and 147 were temporarily withdrawn, but were reinstated on 1 June 2020. 

On 5 January 2025, Magic Bus services ceased their operations in Manchester as a result of the rollout of the Bee Network transferring routes 142, 143 and 147, along with most of their branded vehicles, to Metroline Manchester.

===Magic Mini===
The Magic Mini minibus brand was used in a small number of locations across the UK, including Corby and Ayr.

The brand was used in Corby as &quot;Corby&#x27;s Magic Mini&#x27;s&quot; operated using Iveco minibuses along lettered routes around the town centre. The service commenced in 1990 under the then-separate United Counties Omnibus Company, with the purpose of revitalising the bus network in the town from the previous downfall of bus travel due to an influx of Hackney carriages. The service was operated by United Counties until the 29 November 1999, when it was incorporated into the Stagecoach group. The livery used on the vehicles was a recoloured version of the Stagecoach &quot;Stripes&quot; paintwork. The main bodywork was black, with the stripes being recoloured to gold. The services ran a 5-6 minute frequency, and were free on Saturdays.

The brand was also used in Ayrshire for a time to compete against Ayrways in Ayr and T&amp;E Docherty in Irvine. The Ayr operation used minibuses and larger single-deck buses branded as &quot;Magic Mini&quot;, which were introduced in February 2004. The brand has since been dropped in Ayrshire when the competing operators withdrew their services.

The Magic Mini brand was also engaged in a miniature bus war on the Black Isle to Inverness route in the Scottish Highlands with local operator Scotbus, with Stagecoach in Inverness adopting aggressive tactics such as scheduling buses five minutes before the rival operator and undercutting fares. Competition between the two operators was acrimonious, climaxing in an arson attack on Stagecoach&#x27;s Inverness depot.

<text>The Liga ACB, known as Liga Endesa for sponsorship reasons, is the top professional basketball division of the Spanish basketball league system. Administered by the Asociación de Clubs de Baloncesto (ACB), Liga ACB is contested by 18 teams, with the two lowest-placed teams relegated to the Primera FEB and replaced by the top team in that division plus the winner of the promotion playoffs.

The competition was founded as the ACB Primera División on 1983 following the decision of clubs in the Liga Nacional, founded in 1957, to break away from the Spanish Basketball Federation and professionalize the league. The league&#x27;s accumulated revenues were worth around €30 million in 2020, with Endesa and Movistar Plus+ contributing 50% of the revenues of the league. The league is a corporation where president Antonio Martín is responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders. Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of €12 million in 2019–20.

A total of 52 teams have competed in Liga ACB since its inception in 1983. Seven teams have been crowned champions, with FC Barcelona winning the title a record 17 times and Real Madrid 15 times, though Liga ACB also saw other champions, including Baskonia, Joventut Badalona, Bàsquet Manresa, Baloncesto Málaga and Valencia Basket.

Liga ACB is one of the most popular professional indoor sports leagues in the world, with an average attendance of 6,236 for league matches in the 2018–19 season. This is the ninth-highest of any domestic professional indoor sports league in the world and the fourth-highest of any professional basketball league in the world, behind the National Basketball Association, the EuroLeague, and the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association.

==Competition format==

The competition format follows the usual double round-robin format. During the course of a season, which lasts from October to May, each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 34 games. Teams are ranked by total wins. The eight highest-ranked clubs at the end of the season advance to the playoffs. The winner of the playoffs is crowned champion.

===Relegation and promotion===
A system of relegation and promotion exists between the Liga ACB and the Primera FEB. The two lowest placed teams in Liga ACB are relegated to the Primera FEB, and the top team from the Primera FEB promoted to Liga ACB, with an additional club promoted after a series of playoffs involving the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth placed clubs. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league&#x27;s history:
====Controversies about promotion to Liga ACB====

Prior to 2012, in the 29 editions played of the Liga ACB, only three teams declined promotion, due to acting as reserve teams or for lack of funds: CB Guadalajara and CB Cornellà in 1993 and CB Cajabilbao in 1994.

Since 2012, due to the financial crisis that started in 2008, only two teams (Canarias and Andorra) of a possible 10 could promote to Liga ACB. This started a discussion about the promotion requirements of the ACB, considered by the LEB Oro clubs as &quot;disproportionate&quot;.

For clubs that promote and would make their debut in the ACB demands:
* An arena with a minimum capacity of 5,000 seats.
* An inbound of €3m. For clubs that return to the league after a promotion, an update of the inbound is demanded.
* A deposit of €1.7m that would be returned in case of relegation to LEB Oro. In case of a new promotion, this deposit is required to be restored.
* Conversion into a Sociedad Anónima Deportiva if the club remains in Liga ACB after its first season.

In 2012, Iberostar Canarias and Menorca Bàsquet achieved promotion to ACB, but neither could fulfill the requirements in order to promote. However, Canarias finally played in ACB after buying the berth in the league of Lucentum Alicante, previously sold to the association.

In 2013, neither CB Atapuerca, Ford Burgos by sponsorship reasons, nor Lucentum Alicante could promote. The latter resigned also to play in the second league and joined the fifth division.

In 2014 and 2015, CB Tizona, also Ford Burgos by sponsorship reasons, did not promote despite achieving the place two years in a row. After its second failed promotion, the third in the city of Burgos, the club sued the Association and accused it of &quot;distorting the reality&quot;. Also in 2015, despite having played in the league during the 1980s and 1990s, Club Ourense Baloncesto was not admitted into the league despite fulfilling all the requirements, after not passing an accounts audit. However, ACB would admit Ourense for the 2016–17 season if it fulfilled the requirements regardless of their position in the 2015–16 LEB Oro season.

On 24 April 2016, the National Commission of the Markets and the Competence argued that the inbound impedes, in an &quot;unjustified, disproportionate and discriminatory&quot; way, access of new clubs to Liga ACB.

In June 2016, the two promoted teams from LEB Oro (Palencia and Melilla) resigned promotion to the 2016–17 ACB season and requested to the ACB their sign-in before the 2017–18 season. However, as Gipuzkoa Basket, who finished in relegation positions in three of the last four seasons, resigned from ACB, the Association offered again its place to Palencia and Melilla under these conditions:
* An arena with a minimum capacity of 5,000 seats.
* An inbound of €2m. The second million delayed on the dates agreed between the club and ACB.
* A deposit of €1.6m that would be returned in case of relegation to LEB Oro. In case of a new promotion, this deposit is required to be restored.
* Conversion into a Sociedad Anónima Deportiva before the start of their second season in Liga ACB.

Palencia and Mellila refused the invitation, to reinforce their position against the inbound to play in the league.

In April 2017, the National Commission for Markets and Competition declared the entering inbound and the deposit for the regulation of promotions and relegations as illegal, as they consider it &quot;unjustified, discriminatory and excessive&quot; and imposed a fine of €400,000 to the ACB. Subsequently, the ACB replied that it would appeal the decision of the CNMC, contending that it infringed on the self-organizing capacity of professional leagues, as recognized in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and in the European jurisprudence, and which was unprecedented in Europe and in the rest of the world.

In May 2017, the ACB filed a contentious-administrative appeal and request for precautionary measures before the National Court, on the occasion of the resolution of the National Commission for Markets and Competition (CNMC), as well as to refuse any resolution or decision, present or future, which relates to that act. Also, the ACB approved to establish a negotiation plan with the CSD and the FEB regarding the number of participating teams and the conditions to access to the competition in the next seasons.

In June 2017, the ACB agreed not to require the promotion requirements that have been the subject of the resolution (entering inbound and the deposit for the regulation of promotions and relegations) and the participation fee. Also, the ACB agreed to continue negotiations with the CSD, the FEB and the CNMC to try to establish by mutual agreement new conditions for promotion. In view of the possibility of reaching an agreement that establishes economic and financial requirements in a consensual way before 5 July, the Assembly agreed to establish two new access criteria, provided that there was no pronouncement of the National Court on the precautionary measures regarding the resolution of the National Court, nor agreement with the different bodies that replace it. These conditions were:
* A deposit of €1.9m that would be returned in case of relegation to LEB Oro, guaranteeing at least the value contributed by the clubs in their moment of promotion.
* A minimum budget (for all clubs) of €2.3m to play in the league.

On 10 July 2017, the ACB ratified the agreement with the FEB endorsed by the CSD, to change the conditions to make them easier for promoted teams from LEB Oro. The ACB had also reached a principle of agreement with FEB and CSD regarding a reduction of competition to 16 clubs in 2019 and the model of promotions and relegations in the coming seasons. However, this text has not obtained the necessary support of the clubs in the General Assembly and has not been approved, agreeing to continue the negotiations to find the model of competition appropriate to the interests of the teams overall. These new conditions consist of:
* A deposit of €1.6 million, to be paid over four seasons, that would be returned in case of relegation to LEB Oro, guaranteeing at least the value contributed by the clubs in their moment of promotion.
* A minimum budget (for all clubs) of €2 million to play in the league.

Ten days later and two years after the denounce of CB Tizona, Gipuzkoa Basket and CB Miraflores, also from Burgos, were promoted to Liga ACB. These were the first promotions since the Andorra in 2014. Also, Miraflores became the first team to make its debut in ACB since 2009.

===Ranking of clubs on equal wins===
If wins are equal between two or more clubs, the rules are:

* If all clubs involved have played each other twice:
** If the tie is between two clubs, then the tie is broken using the point difference for the two matches those clubs have played against each other
** If the tie is between more than two clubs, then the tie is broken using the games the clubs have played against each other:
*** a) head-to-head wins
*** b) head-to-head point difference
*** c) head-to-head points scored
* If two legged games between all clubs involved have not been played, or the tie is not broken by the rules above, it is broken using:
** a) total point difference
** b) total points scored
* If the tie is still not broken, a new tiebreak process is initiated with only those teams that remain tied.

===Qualifying for European competitions===
The top teams in Liga ACB, apart from EuroLeague clubs, qualify for the EuroCup and the Champions League with no preference for any competition. Three teams have guaranteed spots in the EuroCup and four teams have guaranteed spots in the Champions League. In addition, other clubs could participate in the FIBA Europe Cup.

== History ==
The first basketball league in Spain was the Liga Nacional, organised by the Spanish Basketball Federation, whose first edition was played in 1957 by six teams from Madrid and the province of Barcelona. Until 1983 it continued being organised by the federation and consisting in only a round-robin tournament, where every teams faced all other twice, one at home and one away, with two points per win and one point in case of a draw.

In 1982, the Asociación de Clubs de Baloncesto was founded and one year later took the helm of the organisation of the league, with several changes in the competition format as they introduced the playoffs and the overtimes in case of draw.

<text>The Third Position is a set of neo-fascist political ideologies that were first described in Western Europe following the Second World War. Developed in the context of the Cold War, it developed its name through the claim that it represented a third position between the capitalism of the Western Bloc and the communism of the Eastern Bloc.

== History ==

The term &quot;Third Position&quot; was coined in Europe and the main precursors of Third Position politics were Italian fascism, Legionarism, Falangism, Prussian socialism, National Bolshevism (a synthesis of far-right ultranationalism and far-left Bolshevism) and Strasserism (a radical, mass-action, worker-based form of Nazism, advocated by the &quot;left-wing&quot; of the Nazi Party by brothers Otto and Gregor Strasser, until it was crushed in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934). Neo-fascist, neo-Nazi author Francis Parker Yockey had proposed an alliance between communists and fascists called the red-brown alliance (red being the color of communism and brown being the color of Nazism). Yockey lent support to Third World liberation movements as well.

== Germany ==
 (&quot;cross-front&quot;) was the cooperation between conservative revolutionaries in Germany with the far-left during the Weimar Republic of the 1920s.

Ernst Niekisch and others tried to combine communist and anti-capitalist nationalist forces to overthrow the existing order of the Weimar Republic. He called this merger &quot;National Bolshevism&quot;. During his early years in Nazi Party as , Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler worked briefly as a deputy of Gregor Strasser, then head of party propaganda department. Influenced heavily by Strasserist ideas, Himmler attacked capitalism and viewed socialism as &quot;the natural economic system&quot; during the 1920s. Germany&#x27;s Chancellor, General Kurt von Schleicher (in office 1932–33), attempted to induce the more left-wing Strasserist segment of the Nazi Party to merge with the trade unions as way of forcing Hitler to support his government, but his plan failed.

The term is also used today for mutual entryism or cooperation between left and right-wing groups. For example, at a Berlin peace rally on February 24, 2023, called by Sahra Wagenknecht, at the time a leading figure of Germany&#x27;s socialist Left Party, and feminist Alice Schwarzer in support of their manifesto calling for negotiations and stop of military support of Ukraine, far-right factions and pro-Russian supporters were in attendance.

== France ==
During the 1930s and 1940s, a number of splinter groups from the radical left became associated with radical nationalism. Jacques Doriot&#x27;s French Popular Party (from the French Communist Party) and Marcel Déat&#x27;s National Popular Rally (from the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International). Third Position ideology gained some support in France, where in 1985 Jean-Gilles Malliarakis set up a &quot;Third Way&quot; political party, Troisième Voie (TV). Considering its main enemies to be the United States, communism and Zionism, the group advocated radical paths to national revolution. Associated for a time with the Groupe Union Défense, TV was generally on poor terms with Front National until 1991, when Malliarakis decided to approach them. As a result, TV fell apart and a radical splinter group under Christian Bouchet, Nouvelle Résistance, adopted National Bolshevik and then Eurasianist views.

== Italy ==
In Italy, the Third Position was developed by Roberto Fiore, along with Gabriele Adinolfi and Peppe Dimitri, in the tradition of Italian neo-fascism. Third Position&#x27;s ideology is characterized by a militarist formulation, a palingenetic ultranationalism looking favourably to national liberation movements, support for racial separatism and the adherence to a soldier lifestyle. In order to construct a cultural background for the ideology, Fiore looked to the ruralism of Julius Evola and sought to combine it with the desire for a cultural-spiritual revolution. He adopted some of the positions of the contemporary far-right, notably the ethnopluralism of Alain de Benoist and the Europe-wide appeal associated with such views as the Europe a Nation campaign of Oswald Mosley (amongst others). Fiore was one of the founders of the Terza Posizione movement in 1978. Third Position ideas are now represented in Italy by Forza Nuova, led by Fiore; and by the movement CasaPound, a network of far-right social centres.

== United Kingdom ==
In the 1980s, the National Front, a British fascist party that had experienced the height of its success in the 1970s, was taken over by a Strasserist faction that referred to themselves as Third Positionist. The Strasserist-led National Front was also characterised by Baker as National Bolshevist in ideology. Reflecting the Nouvelle Droite&#x27;s influence, the Strasserist Official NF promoted support for &quot;a broad front of racialists of all colours&quot; who were seeking an end to multi-racial society and capitalism, praising black nationalists like Louis Farrakhan and Marcus Garvey. Their publication, &quot;Nationalism Today&quot;, featured positive articles on the governments of Libya and Iran, presenting them as part of a global anti-capitalist and anti-Marxist third force in international politics; its members openly acknowledged the influence of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his Third International Theory. This may have had tactical as well as ideological motivations, with Libya and Iran viewed as potential sources of funding. This new rhetoric and ideology alienated much of the party&#x27;s rank-and-file membership. It experienced internal problems, and in 1989 several of its senior members—Nick Griffin, Derek Holland, and Colin Todd—split from it to establish their International Third Position group. One of its leaders was Roberto Fiore, an ex-member of the Italian far-right movement Terza Posizione.

== United States ==
In the United States, Political Research Associates argues that Third Position politics has been promoted by some white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups such as the National Alliance, American Front, Traditionalist Worker Party, Patriot Front, and White Aryan Resistance, as well as some black nationalist groups, such as the Nation of Islam, since the late 20th century. In 2010, the American Third Position Party (later renamed American Freedom Party) was founded in part to channel the right-wing populist resentment engendered by the financial crisis of 2007–08 and the policies of the Obama administration.

<text>Baron Avro Manhattan (April 6, 1914 – November 27, 1990) was an Italian writer, historian, poet and artist. A born aristocrat who wrote about various political topics throughout his career, Manhattan is perhaps best remembered as the author of several works discussing the Vatican&#x27;s role in world politics and global affairs. Manhattan attended both the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics.

==Life and career==
Born in Milan, Italy, on April 6, 1914, to American and Swiss/Dutch parents of Jewish extraction, Manhattan was originally known as&quot;Teofilo Lucifero Gardini&quot; in his early days in Italy. Before his exile, Manhattan was known to spend his summers at the home of the artist, Paolo Troubetzkoy, in Verbania.

Manhattan, himself a painter, exhibited a number of his works at local Italian museums. The last of these exhibitions was at the Museo del Paesaggio, in Verbania, where two of his paintings remain to this day.

Manhattan was exiled to England from Italy during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. During World War II, he operated a radio station called &quot;Radio Freedom&quot; broadcasting to nations occupied by the Axis Powers. Manhattan officially changed residence to the United Kingdom in 1945 for &quot;political reasons,&quot; but not until 1953 did Manhattan legally change his name, relinquishing the names &quot;Teofilo Angelo Mario Gardini&quot; and &quot;Teophile Lucifer Gardini.&quot; At the time, he lived in Wimbledon, London.

In 1961, Manhattan met his future wife, Anne Manhattan &quot;née&quot; Cunningham Brown, in London, and two years later, they moved into a house on Henry Nelson Street in South Shields, North East England.

He is buried with his wife at Shotley Bridge in Benfieldside Cemetery, Consett, County Durham, England. Their gravestone reads:

His friends included H. G. Wells, Pablo Picasso, George Bernard Shaw, scientist Marie Stopes and the Rev. Ian Paisley.

<text>Ahmadou Kourouma (24 November 1927 – 11 December 2003) was an Ivorian novelist.

==Life==
The eldest son of a distinguished Malinké family, Ahmadou Kourouma was born in 1927 in Boundiali, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. Raised by his uncle, he initially pursued studies in Bamako, Mali. From 1950 to 1954, when his country was still under French colonial control, he participated in French military campaigns in Indochina, after which he journeyed to France to study mathematics in Lyon.
Kourouma returned to his native Côte d&#x27;Ivoire after it won its independence in 1960, yet he quickly found himself questioning the government of Félix Houphouët-Boigny. After a brief imprisonment, Kourouma spent several years in exile, first in Algeria (1964–69), then in Cameroon (1974–84) and Togo (1984–94), before finally returning to live in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

Determined to speak out against the betrayal of legitimate African aspirations at the dawn of independence, Kourouma was drawn into an experiment in fiction. His first novel, &quot;Les Soleils des indépendances&quot; (&quot;The Suns of Independence&quot;, 1970) contains a critical treatment of post-colonial governments in Africa. Twenty years later, his second book &quot;Monnè, outrages et défis&quot;, a history of a century of colonialism, was published. In 1998, he published &quot;En attendant le vote des bêtes sauvages&quot; (translated as &quot;Waiting for the Wild Beasts to Vote&quot;), a satire of postcolonial Africa in the style of Voltaire, with elements of the Epic of Sundiata, in which a griot recounts the story of a tribal hunter&#x27;s transformation into a dictator, inspired by president Gnassingbé Eyadéma of Togo. In 2000, he published &quot;Allah n&#x27;est pas obligé&quot; (translated as &quot;Allah is Not Obliged&quot;), a tale of an orphan who becomes a child soldier when travelling to visit his aunt in Liberia.

At the outbreak of civil war in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in 2002, Kourouma stood against the war as well as against the concept of Ivorian nationalism, calling it &quot;an absurdity which has led us to chaos&quot;. President Laurent Gbagbo accused him of supporting rebel groups from the north of the country.

In France, each of Kourouma&#x27;s novels was greeted with great acclaim, sold exceptionally well, and was showered with prizes, including the Prix Renaudot in the year 2000 and the Prix Goncourt des Lycéens for &quot;Allah n&#x27;est pas obligé&quot;. In the English-speaking world, Kourouma has yet to make much of an impression: despite some positive reviews, his work remains largely unknown outside university classes in African fiction. &quot;Allah Is Not Obliged&quot; received its first English translation in 2006.

At the time of his death, in Lyon, Kourouma was working on a sequel to &quot;Allah n&#x27;est pas obligé&quot;, entitled &quot;Quand on refuse on dit non&quot; (translated roughly as &quot;When One Disagrees, One Says No&quot;), in which the protagonist of the first novel, a child soldier, is demobilized and returns to his home in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, where a new regional conflict has arisen.

<doc id="1253254" wikidata="Q1887494" url="?curid=1253254" title="Battle of Uji (1180)">
<text>The , alternatively known as &quot;Mochihitos Raising of an Army&quot; in Japan is a battle which took place on June 20, 1180, following Prince Mochihito and Minamoto no Yorimasa&#x27;s plan to raise an army to overthrow the Taira clan and the issuing of an edict urging the Minamoto clan, major temples, and shrines in the country to revolt.

Due to lack of preparation, the plan was discovered by the Taira, and Prince Mochihito and Yorimasa were defeated, dying at the battle. However, this triggered multiple anti-Taira forces to raise their armies. The battle is famous for having begun the Genpei War.

== Background ==

Prince Mochihito, having been passed over twice in the succession of the Imperial Throne and believing Taira no Kiyomori was causing suffering in the country, coordinated with Minamoto no Yorimasa, who believed Mochihito to be the legitimate heir to the successors, and urged him to rebel. Minamoto no Yorimasa was an aristocrat, who dominated the Imperial Court in Kyoto. He was the most important Minamoto figure on the side of the Taira clan during the Heiji and Hōgen rebellion, leading to the Minamoto clan being banished and the Taira&#x27;s domination over Japanese politics. Due to his connections to Kiyomori, who was the de facto leader of Japan at this point (see Daijō-daijin), he became a high-ranking official, even though he preferred staying out of politics and being in positions that did not require taking sides. By 1179, however, he had changed his views on the Taira and began secretly hoping on the downfall of the Taira.

While at first Mochihito was against the idea of rebelling, after Yorimasa continued urging him, he eventually consented to issue an order. On May 1180, Minamoto Yoshimori was appointed Kurōdo (someone who takes care of the emperor&#x27;s imperial documents), and changed his name to Minamoto no Yukiie. On the 5th of May he set out with Mochihito&#x27;s Royal Order, which went as follows:&#x27;The pronouncement of His Excellency the Prince declares that Kiyomori, Munemori and others, using the prestige of their office and their influence, have invited rebellion and have overthrown the nation. They have caused the officials and the people to suffer, seizing and plundering the five inner provinces and the seven circuits. They have confined the Ex-sovereign, exiled public officials, and inflicted death and banishment, drowning and imprisonment. They have robbed property and seized lands, usurped and bestowed offices... They have despoiled the graves of Princes and cut off the head of one, defied the Emperor and destroyed Buddhist law in a manner unprecedented in history.

This being so, let those of the Minamoto, the Fujiwara and the brave now living in the provinces of the three circuits now add their efforts to the cause. If there be those who are not of like mind they shall be regarded as partisans of Kiyomori and they shall suffer pain of death, exile or imprisonment. If there be those who perform meritoriously, despatch missions to me and inform me of their names and deeds, I shall, without fail, following my enthronement, bestow rewards upon them according to their wishes. Proclaim this message in all the provinces and carry out the terms of this pronouncement. 5 May 1180.&#x27;After Yukiie set out, , who was under obligation of the Taira clan, had found out of Mochihito&#x27;s Royal Order and that Yukiie is carrying it, although the way he found out is unknown. He then set out with around 1,000 men against Yukiie, who had 1,500. The battle would go on for 3 days until most of Tanzō&#x27;s retainers were killed and he himself was injured.

After the battle, Tanzō sent a courier to Kyoto, notifying them of the upcoming Rebellion. Once Kiyomori heard of this, he immediately ordered Mochihito be arrested and banished to Tosa Province on Shikoku. At first, no one suspected Minamoto no Yorimasa to be behind the plot, as one of entrusted samurais that were to carry out the order of arrest was one of Yorimasa&#x27;s sons (Being Minamoto no Mitsunaga). Soon, Mochihito had gotten news of the order, and was told to flee to Mii-dera, one of the temples which opposed Kiyomori. He was told by his samurai that it would be easier to escape in women&#x27;s attire, so he let his hair loose, put on female clothing, and wore a wide straw hat, similar to one a townswomen would wear.

Soon, the Taira forces had made it to Mochihito&#x27;s palace, where there was a guard called Hasebe Nobutsura that was left behind while Mochihito fled. He was questioned by the Taira forces on the whereabouts of Mochihito, to which he responded that he had gone to a local shrine. The Taira forces, doubting this, ordered the palace be searched. Nobutsura, however, drew his sword (which had only been a ceremonial one) in response, beginning a battle in which he stood alone against 300 Taira men. He had wounded at least 56 of the Taira due to his knowledge of the palace. Since his sword was only ceremonial, it soon broke, causing him to be captured and examined in which he did not give the whereabouts of Mochihito away, and was banished to Hōki Province.

== Prelude ==
On the following morning, Mochihito arrived at Mii-dera, where the monks were extremely grateful for the prince&#x27;s presence. On the evening of the next day, Yorimasa also arrived with his sons Nakatsuna, Kanetsuna, and about 300 men. Soon too the Watanabe clan assembled at the temple of Mii-dera, as they were vassals of the Minamoto. One of the Watanabe clan members (Watanabe Kiou) had been late, and was caught by Taira no Munemori, who tried convincing him to serve the Taira. Kiou tricked him into giving him a horse to go to Mii-dera to ambush the Minamoto, however he used it to meet up with the Minamoto forces and fight for them. Munemori was greatly angered by this, and requested he be taken alive and that Munemori be able to &quot;saw&quot; his head off.

Mii-dera, knowing they cant alone defend against a Taira force, sent a letter to Nara and Enryaku-ji for assistance, the one sent to Nara went as following:&quot;A petition from Onjoji (Mii-dera) to Kōfuku-ji (A temple in Nara) to beg assistance that this monastery may not be destroyed. Know that the supreme excellence of Buddhism is to uphold the Monarchy; and the duration of the Throne therefore depends on the Law of Buddha. Now the Nyudo (someone who enteres priesthood), the former Daijō-daijin (Chancellor), Taira-no-Kiyomori Ko, whose priestly name is Jokai, does his will with the authority of the country and turns the government upside down, so that there is everywhere resentment and lamentation. And on the evening of the fifteenth day of this month the second son of the Ho-o (Emperor Takakura) hurriedly fled to our monastery to escape persecution, and though they have demanded repeatedly that we give him up, our priests unanimously refuse to do so, Therefore this Lay priest is collecting an army to enter our monastery, wishing to destroy at one time both Buddhism and the Monarchy. In ancient times in China, when the Emperor Bu-so attempted to destroy Buddhism by force of arms, the monks of Joryusen joined battle and repulsed him; if they thus upheld their rights against the monarch, how much more shall we not chastise this great rebel (Kiyomori), this transgressor of the first of the Eight Disobediences (Rebellion). Nara was the place where in unprecedented fashion the guiltless Kampaku was banished. If we do not act now, at what time shall we able to remove this reproach? Thus we pray you to lend us aid lest Buddhism be destroyed, and also that this evil revolt against the Monarchy may be put away. If we are of one mind we shall attain our object. Given at a council of the Chief Priests; eighteenth. day of the fifth month (12th of June) of the fourth year of Jisho (1180).&quot;A similar letter was then also sent to Enryakuji.

The Enryakuji monks read the letter, however didn&#x27;t give any response, as they had been bribed by Kiyomori so they stay by his side. Nara temple however, did reply on the 15th of June, accepting Mii-deras call to arms, telling them that they &quot;will await your sign to advance&quot;.

After this, the Mii-dera monks began fortifying the temple, and held another council, suggesting that they do a night attack , which was an important base for the Taira and where the , a major branch of the Taira, resided in. The idea was to split up their forces into 2, using old veterans to attack the back gate and the younger soldiers to attack the front gate of. While this was being discussed, a monk, along with 10 others who lived with him, and who had done priestly services for the Taira, suggested it was a bad idea as it could cause reputational damage to the temple and anger other temples while also calling the plan unrealistic. He continued to argue with the other monks, greatly delaying an expedition. Soon, one of the monks burst into the council and stated 

&quot;There is a saying that a man will have pity on a distressed bird that takes refuge in his bosom. I don&#x27;t know about the rest, but as for me and my followers we go down to attack Rokuhara tonight and die there!&quot;Another monk agreed with him, and so the army set off with around 1,500 men to Rokuhara. However soon an issue was faced, as when Mochihito had first entered the temple, Mii-dera had made a rampart, a moat, set up palisades, and thrown obstacles across the road, so the moat had to be bridged and the obstacles removed. It had taken the whole evening for it to be able to be crossed and the road be cleared. Noticing it had already been morning, the attack was called off, thinking it would be too risky to fight the Taira in broad daylight. Fault was put upon the Monk who had delayed the expedition by arguing, and he along with his followers were violently harassed and attacked by the other Monks. He eventually fled towards Rokuhara, where he told the story to the Taira, who were not concerned by it, as they had 10,000 men assembled at Rokuhara.

Then the Prince, seeing that Enryakuji had turned against them, that Nara had not yet sent any men, and that Mii-dera alone could not defend itself, decided on the 17th of June to leave the temple and headed for Nara. While the older monks stayed behind at the temple, the younger monks along with the Watanabe clan and Yorimasa went with Mochihito, meaning the army had around 1,500 men.

They marched down to Uji, crossing the Uji River and tearing up the planks of the bridge behind them to prevent the Taira from following. As Mochihito hadn&#x27;t gotten any sleep the night before, they entered the Byōdō-in temple to get some rest.

== Battle ==
As soon as the Taira at Rokuhara learnt of Mochihito&#x27;s escape to Nara, they immediately sent an army of roughly 28,000 men in pursuit. Soon the army arrived at the Uji river, and suspecting the enemy forces to be at Uji, they soon began their battle cry. The vanguard alerted the rest of the army that the bridge had been destroyed by the Mochihito forces, the rearguard however, ignored this, and called for an advance into the river. This led many (around 200 according to the Heike Monogatari) horsemen falling into the river and dying.

The two sides stood on opposite ends of the bridge, and they began an archery battle. The warrior monks were said to be very good archers, being able to shoot so powerfully that the arrows shaft pierced the wooden shields of the Taira. Three warrior monks in particular are named in the &quot;Heike Monogatari&quot;:

Gochi-in no Tajima, who is said to have strode alone on the bridge, dodging arrows and using his Naginata to cut through those that flew straight at him (leading to him being named &quot;the arrow cutter&quot;).

Tsutsui Jōmyō Meishū, who was said to have loosed off &quot;his twenty-four arrows like lightning flashes&quot; having slewn 12 Taira samurai and injured another 11; once his quiver only contained one more arrow, he threw his bow and quiver away, and using a &quot;naginata&quot;, &quot;tachi&quot; and dagger slew at least another 15. It is said that once the battle was over, he counted 63 arrows sticking out of his armor, which is not unlikely considering the structure and material composition of samurai armor

Ichirai Hōshi, who was behind Jōmyō and frustrated over him blocking the narrow bridge, meaning he could not fight alongside him. Ichirai then grabbed him by his neckpiece, vaulting over him, after which he fought bravely until he ultimately fell. Jōmyō, seeing Ichirai be killed, then retired from the battle to Byodo-in and went to Nara.

The fighting across the broken bridge continued for until sunset, until it was littered with dead bodies. Some fought across to the other side of the bridge and returned with the spoils of who they slew. Some, after being wounded, cut themselves open and jumped into the river. A retainer of the Taira force, seeing this, said to the commanders &quot;the battle on the bridge is very fierce; we ought to ford the river, but after the rains of this month, neither man nor horse can live in the stream&quot; and suggested they take a large detour to cross to the other side. , who led a contingent of 300 samurai, disagreed with this plan, stating that if they do not confront the enemy force here, the Prince will escape to Nara, and suggested trying to ford this river instead. And so, he and his force of samurai, shouting the Ashikaga warcry, crossed the river without losing a single man. Tadatsuna was the first warrior on the frontline and following a custom of the period is said to have proclaimed his name and lineage before charging his enemies. According to the Azuma Kagami, the 18-year-old Tadatsuna is supposedly remembered as having had the strength of one hundred men, a voice that echoed over 10 li (5 km), and teeth of 1 sun (3.03 cm) long. Kagami further stated that &quot;there will be no warrior in future ages like this Tadatsuna.&quot;

Taira no Tomomori, the commander, seeing this, sent the entire Taira force to ford the river and caught up with the Minamoto. Soon the Taira force had made it to the gates of the Byodo-in, and Mochihito wanted to try and escape. Yorimasa tried to help the Prince get away, but was struck with an arrow in the right elbow. His younger son, Kanetsuna was holding off a group of Taira soldiers who had wanted Yorimasa&#x27;s head, but he was hit by an arrow. Nakatsuna, Yorimasa&#x27;s older son, was also terribly injured. They both hold off the Taira long enough for Yorimasa, who was at the age of around 73, to commit &quot;seppuku.&quot; Kanetsuna was then killed by the group of Taira soldiers. Soon after Nakatsuna, being mortally wounded, also committed &quot;seppuku.&quot; On the back of Yorimasa&#x27;s war fan he wrote a farewell-poem, which read:Like a fossil tree from which we gather no fruits,&lt;br&gt;Sad has been my life, fated no fruit to produce.It is said that &quot;Yorimasa committed seppuku in a way that set the standard for generations to come.&quot;

With the main Minamoto leaders gone, the Taira quickly took control of the Temple. The Taira then went in pursuit of Prince Mochihito, who was trying to escape. With around 400-500 men they set off and found him at the Kōmyōzen torii and in a hail of arrows was thrown of his horse, and was afterwards decaptitated.&quot;&quot; Shortly after the battle, 7,000 Monks from Nara were on their way to the battleground, but had received news the battle had already ended in a defeat, and they all went back home.&quot;&quot;

<text>Jungle or dou shou qi () is a modern Chinese board game with an obscure history. A British version known as &quot;Jungle King&quot; was sold in the 1960s by the John Waddington company. The game is played on a 7×9 board and is popular with children in the Far East.

Jungle is a two-player strategy game and has been cited by &quot;The Playboy Winner&#x27;s Guide to Board Games&quot; as resembling the Western game &quot;Stratego&quot;. The game is also known as the jungle game, children&#x27;s chess, oriental chess and animal chess.

==Overview==
The Jungle gameboard represents a jungle terrain with dens, traps &quot;set&quot; around dens, and rivers. Each player controls eight game pieces representing different animals of various rank. Stronger-ranked animals can capture (&quot;eat&quot;) animals of weaker or equal rank. The player who is first to maneuver any one of their pieces into the opponent&#x27;s den wins the game. An alternative way to win is to capture all the opponent&#x27;s pieces.

==Board==
The Jungle , usually made of paper, consists of seven and nine of squares (7×9 rectangle = 63 squares). Pieces move on the squares as in chess, not on the grid lines as in xiangqi. Pictures of eight animals and their names appear on each side of the board to indicate initial placement of the game pieces. After initial setup, these designated squares have no special meaning in the .

There are several special squares and areas of the Jungle board: 
* Each player has one &quot;den&quot; () square located in the centre of their first row of the board and labeled as such in Chinese. 
* Three &quot;traps&quot; () border each den, to each side and in front. These are also labeled in Chinese. 
* Two water areas or &quot;rivers&quot; () are located in the centre of the board, each comprising 6 squares in a 2×3 rectangle, and labeled with the Chinese characters for &quot;river&quot;. There are single columns of ordinary land squares on the edges of the board, and down the middle between the rivers.

==Pieces==
Each player has eight game pieces representing different animals, each with a different rank, and in their own colour (blue versus red). The animal ranking, from strongest to weakest, is:

Pieces start on squares with pictures corresponding to their animal, which are invariably shown on the Jungle board.

==Rules==

===Movement===
Players alternate moves with Blue moving first. During their turn, a player must move. All pieces can move one square horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). A piece may not move into its own den. Animals of either side can move into and out of any trap square.

There are special rules related to the &quot;water squares&quot;:
* The &quot;rat&quot; is the only animal that may go onto (or off of) a water square.
* The &quot;lion&quot; and &quot;tiger&quot; can jump over a river vertically. The &quot;lion&quot; can also jump over a river horizontally. They jump from a square on one edge of the river to the next non-water square on the other side.
* If that square contains an enemy piece of equal or lower rank, the lion or tiger capture it as part of their jump.
* A jumping move is blocked (not permitted) if a rat of either color currently occupies any of the intervening water squares.

===Capturing===
Animals capture opponent pieces by &quot;killing/eating&quot; them (the attacking piece the captured piece on its square; the captured piece is removed from the game). A piece can capture any enemy piece that has the same or lower rank, with the following exceptions:

* The rat can &quot;kill&quot; (capture) an elephant, but only from a land square, not from a water square. Many published versions of the game say the rat kills the elephant by &quot;running into its ear and gnawing into its brain&quot;. 
* A rat in the water is invulnerable to capture by any piece on land. (Therefore, a rat in the water can only be killed by another rat in the water.) 
* A piece that enters one of the opponent&#x27;s trap squares is reduced in rank to 0. Thus the trapped piece may be captured by the defending side with any piece, regardless of rank. A trapped piece has its normal rank restored when it exits an opponent&#x27;s trap square.

==Minor variations==
There are some commonly played variations, as follows: 
* The elephant may not kill the rat under any circumstances.
* Some play the game with the lion and tiger being equally strong, whereby they can kill each other.
* Some versions have the tiger outranking the lion.
* The leopard may jump over the river horizontally but not vertically (due to its lesser strength than the tiger or lion). It can jump over a rat in the river.
* All traps are universal. If an animal goes into a trap in its own region, an opponent animal is able to capture it regardless of rank difference if it is beside the trapped animal. The rules for being on one&#x27;s own trap do vary.
* A variant has the wolf replaced by the &quot;fox&quot;, in which case the dog is stronger than the fox.
* There are variations in which the lion is not able to jump across the river horizontally.
* The rules for the rat to capture either the elephant or rat from or into the water do vary.
* There is a simplified version called animal checkers, which has no traps or rivers, and only the rat, dog, tiger and elephant.
* Amongst the many examples shown on BoardGameGeek there is at least one where the pieces are designed so that they are no longer visible by the opponent (mounted as a card on a stand like &quot;Stratego&quot; pieces). This change alters the game from one of stochastic &#x27;full-knowledge&#x27; to one of partial-knowledge.
* There is a version of the game that limits which animals (rankings 1–4) can move onto the trap squares.
* Some players prefer allowing the dog to move onto water squares.

Improve variances to reduce drawing games:

# Can jump vertical: lion, tiger, no blocking rule
# Can jump horizontal: lion, tiger, leopard
# Can swim: wolf, dog, rat
# Only rat, cat, and dog can move to home trap squares
# No piece can stay in water for more than 3 turns, on turn 4, if the piece cannot or does not move to land, it is drowned
# Limited food in den: if the home den is occupied by any piece for total of 30 turns in one game, the player the den belongs to loses.

<text>Frederick Nathaniel &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert, (8 December 1942 – 11 September 2020) was a Jamaican singer and songwriter who was the lead vocalist for the reggae and ska band Toots and the Maytals. A reggae pioneer, he performed for six decades and helped establish some of the fundamentals of reggae music. Hibbert&#x27;s 1968 song &quot;Do the Reggay&quot; is widely credited as the genesis of the genre name &quot;reggae&quot;. His band&#x27;s album &quot;True Love&quot; won a Grammy Award in 2005.

== Early life ==
Hibbert was born on 8 December 1942 in May Pen, Jamaica, the youngest of his siblings. Hibbert&#x27;s parents were both strict Seventh-day Adventist preachers so he grew up singing gospel music in a church choir. Both parents died young and, by the age of 11, Hibbert was an orphan who went to live with his brother John in the Trenchtown neighborhood of Kingston. While working at a local barbershop, he met his future bandmates Raleigh Gordon and Jerry Matthias.

== Career ==
=== 1960s ===
Hibbert, a multi-instrumentalist, formed Toots and the Maytals in 1961. He could play every instrument used in his band and would later cite Otis Redding, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, and James Brown as key influences. According to Hibbert, &quot;Maytals&quot; is a reference to the Rastafari term for &quot;do the right thing&quot;. There are also statements attributing the source of the name to Hibbert&#x27;s hometown of May Pen. The band was originally a trio with Gordon and Mathias, and later added Jackie Jackson and Paul Douglas.

Much of Hibbert&#x27;s early recorded output, such as &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (1963), reflects his Christian upbringing. He was also known to write about Rastafarian religious themes, and in an early Maytals song, &quot;Six And Seven Books of Moses&quot; (1963), he addressed the folk magic of obeah and its use of the occult literature of Biblical grimoires, such as the &quot;Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses&quot;.

The Maytals became one of the more popular vocal groups in Jamaica in the mid-1960s, recording with producers Coxsone Dodd, Prince Buster, Byron Lee, Ronnie Nasralla, and Leslie Kong. This success included winning Jamaica&#x27;s National Popular Song Contest three times with songs Hibbert wrote: in 1966 with &quot;Bam Bam&quot;, which won a national song competition, 1969 with &quot;Sweet and Dandy&quot; and 1972 with &quot;Pomps &amp; Pride&quot;.

In 1966, Hibbert was sentenced to 18 months in prison for possession of marijuana. This experience provided the inspiration for one of his best known songs, &quot;54-46 That&#x27;s My Number&quot;. Hibbert was one of the first artists to use the word &quot;reggae&quot; on a record, in 1968&#x27;s &quot;Do the Reggay&quot;.

In his 2016 &quot;The Rise of Reggae and the influence of Toots and the Maytals&quot;, Matthew Sherman wrote:
&quot;In the winter of 1968, the cool rocksteady beat gave way to a faster, brighter, more danceable sound. Reggae was born. Toots heralded the new sound with the seminal, complex groove monster &#x27;Do the Reggay&#x27; advertising &#x27;the new dance, going around the town.&#x27; Toots wanted &#x27;to do the Reggae, with you!&#x27; ...From &#x27;69 to &#x27;71, Toots could do no wrong recording for Leslie Kong. With the consistent nucleus of musicians, the Beverley&#x27;s All-Stars (Jackie Jackson, Winston Wright, Hux Brown, Rad Bryan, Paul Douglas, and Winston Grennan) and The Maytals&#x27; brilliant harmonizing, Toots wrote and sang his unmistakable voice about every subject imaginable.&quot;

=== 1970s ===
The first Toots and the Maytals album released and distributed by Chris Blackwell&#x27;s Island Records was &quot;Funky Kingston&quot;. Music critic Lester Bangs described the album in &quot;Stereo Review&quot; as &quot;perfection, the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released.&quot; Chris Blackwell had a strong commitment to Toots and the Maytals, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve known Toots longer than anybody – much longer than Bob [Bob Marley]. Toots is one of the purest human beings I&#x27;ve met in my life, pure almost to a fault.&quot;

In 1970, the band first charted overseas with &quot;Monkey Man&quot; reaching No. 47 in Britain.

Hibbert also appeared in the groundbreaking Jamaican film &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, in which his band sings &quot;Sweet and Dandy&quot;. The film&#x27;s soundtrack included the Maytals&#x27; 1969 hit song &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;. &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; features fellow musician and actor Jimmy Cliff in the leading role as Ivan, a character whose story resembles Hibbert&#x27;s.

On 1 October 1975, Toots and the Maytals were broadcast live on KMET-FM as they performed at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles. This broadcast was re-mastered and released as an album entitled &quot;Sailin&#x27; On&quot; via Klondike Records.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===

The band&#x27;s 1980 performance at Hammersmith Palais in London was released as an album, &quot;Live&quot;, less than 24 hours after it was recorded, making it into the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. The band released &quot;Knock Out!&quot; in 1981, after which the original Maytals trio broke. After a hiatus, Hibbert continued to tour as a solo artist. In 1988, he released &quot;Toots in Memphis&quot;, for which he earned his first Grammy nomination. Hibbert restarted his band in the mid-1990s without Gordon and Mathias.

=== 2000s ===
In 2004, Hibbert was featured in Willie Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Outlaws and Angels&quot;. Hibbert carried on touring the world, and his band&#x27;s &quot;True Love&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 2005. Nelson released a reggae album entitled &quot;Countryman&quot; (2005) which featured Hibbert on the song &quot;I&#x27;m a Worried Man&quot;. Hibbert was also featured in the music video for the song, which was filmed in Jamaica.

In 2006, Toots and the Maytals covered Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Let Down&quot; for the Easy Star All-Stars album &quot;Radiodread&quot;, a reggae version of the English rock band&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot;. At the end of the year, Hibbert joined Gov&#x27;t Mule for their New Year&#x27;s Eve concert, documented in their Dub Side of the Mule release.

In 2009, Hibbert collaborated with MCPR Music and Steel Pulse&#x27;s Sidney Mills, who produced Jamaican percussionist Larry McDonald&#x27;s album &quot;Drumquestra&quot;. His track is called &quot;What about the Children?&quot; The same year he also performed vocals with Iowa reggae band Public Property on their album &quot;Work to Do&quot;.

Hibbert was also a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

Hibbert collaborated with the U.S. southern rock/blues group, JJ Grey &amp; Mofro. He is featured in their song, &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot;, on their album, &quot;Georgia Warhorse&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
In 2011, Hibbert was featured in the documentary &quot;Reggae Got Soul: The Story of Toots and the Maytals&quot; which was airred on BBC. Described as &quot;The untold story of one of the most influential artists ever to come out of Jamaica&quot;, it features appearances by Marcia Griffiths, Jimmy Cliff, Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Willie Nelson, Anthony DeCurtis, Ziggy Marley, Chris Blackwell, Paolo Nutini, Paul Douglas, Sly Dunbar, and Robbie Shakespeare.

In May 2013, Hibbert received a head injury after being hit by a thrown bottle during a performance at the River Rock Festival in Richmond, Virginia, U.S.
forcing him to cancel several months of live shows. The bottle was thrown by William C Lewis. Lewis was facing a charge of malicious wounding, but he pleaded guilty to lesser charges. Despite Hibbert pleading in a letter to the judge, &quot;He is a young man, and I have heard what happens to young men in jail. My own pain and suffering would be increased substantially knowing that this young man would face that prospect,&quot; the judge gave Lewis a six-month sentence.

After a three-year hiatus following the incident at the River Rock Festival, in 2016 Toots and the Maytals returned to the stage and began touring again. Hibbert&#x27;s vocals appear in the Major Lazer and Bad Royale 2016 collaboration, &quot;My Number&quot;, which samples his band&#x27;s earlier song &quot;54-46 That&#x27;s My Number&quot;.

On 25 July 2018, Hibbert performed on the U.S. television show &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; with Toots and the Maytals where they debuted an original song entitled &quot;Marley&quot; as well as performing their classic hit song &quot;Funky Kingston&quot; in a live performance.

Toots and the Maytals have been cited as inspiration for other music artists as per career longevity. Jamaican artist Sean Paul explained this in saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen some great people in my industry, you know, people like Toots...Toots and the Maytals. Toots, he&#x27;s a great reggae artist and he&#x27;s still doing it...He&#x27;s up there in years and he&#x27;s doing it. Those kind of artists inspire me. I know I&#x27;m just going to keep on doing music as long as I can.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hibbert married Doreen as a teenager. They had seven children. Two of his songs, &quot;It&#x27;s You&quot; and &quot;Never You Change&quot; were written for Doreen when she was 18 years old. His son Clayton followed him into a career in music, performing and recording under the name &#x27;Junior Toots&#x27;. His daughter, Jenieve, also followed him into music, most popularly performing as one half of a gospel duo with now ex-husband, Robert Bailey.

== Death ==
In August 2020, it was reported that Hibbert was in hospital &quot;fighting for his life&quot; in a medically induced coma. On 12 September 2020, a statement on the band&#x27;s Facebook page announced that he had died, at the age of 77. &quot;The Gleaner&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; later confirmed the announcement, reporting that Hibbert had died at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, in a medically induced coma. It was later confirmed that COVID-19 during the pandemic in Jamaica was the underlying cause of his death.

== Honors ==
In 2010, Hibbert ranked No. 71 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;. In August 2012, it was announced that he would receive the Order of Jamaica, the country&#x27;s fifth highest honour.

<text>The United States Antarctic Program (or USAP; formerly known as the United States Antarctic Research Program or USARP and the United States Antarctic Service or USAS) is an organization of the United States government which has a presence in the Antarctica continent. Founded in 1959, the USAP manages all U.S. scientific research and related logistics in Antarctica as well as aboard ships in the Southern Ocean.

== United States Antarctic Program ==
The United States established the U.S. Antarctic Research Program (USARP) in 1959—the name was later changed to the U.S. Antarctic Program—immediately following the success of the International Geophysical Year (IGY). Today, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has a Presidential Mandate to manage the United States Antarctic Program, through which it operates three year-round research stations and two research vessels, coordinates all U.S. science on the southernmost continent, and works with other federal agencies, the U.S. military, and civilian contractors, to provide the necessary logistical support for the science.

The U.S. is a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty and the conduct of science is the principal expression of U.S. interest in the Antarctic.

In October 1970 President Richard Nixon stated U.S. policy for Antarctica to be:To maintain the Antarctic Treaty and ensure that this continent will continue to be used only for peaceful purposes and shall not become an area or object of international discord; to foster cooperative scientific research for the solution of worldwide and regional problems, including environmental monitoring and prediction and assessment of resources; and to protect the Antarctic environment and develop appropriate measures to ensure the equitable and wise use of living and non-living resources… Science has provided a successful basis for international accord, and the Antarctic is the only continent where science serves as the principal expression of national policy and interest.&quot;In 1970 and again in 1976 National Security Decision Memoranda (71 and 318) reaffirmed the &quot;importance of maintaining an active and influential U.S. presence in the Antarctic that is &#x27;responsive to U.S. scientific, economic, and political objectives.

In February 1982 President Ronald Reagan in White House Memorandum 6646 reaffirmed the prior policy and noted that the presence in Antarctica shall include &quot;the conduct of scientific activities in major disciplines&quot; and &quot;year-round occupation of the South Pole and two coastal stations.&quot;

On 9 June 1994 Presidential Decision Directive NSC 26 (&quot;United States Policy on the Arctic and Antarctic Regions&quot;) stated that U.S. policy toward Antarctica has four fundamental objectives: (1) protecting the relatively unspoiled environment of Antarctica and its associated ecosystems, (2) preserving and pursuing unique opportunities for scientific research to understand Antarctica and global physical and environmental systems, (3) maintaining Antarctica as an area of international cooperation reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes, and (4) assuring the conservation and sustainable management of the living resources in the oceans surrounding Antarctica.

An April 1996 report, &quot;U.S. Antarctic Program&quot;, by the President&#x27;s National Science and Technology Council, directed the establishment of the present Panel and reaffirmed that essential elements of U.S. national and scientific interests are well served by continued involvement in scientific activity in the Antarctic as carried out by the U.S. Antarctic Program. The report states that policies in the 1982 memorandum continue to be appropriate at the current funding level and that present U.S. policy and practice with respect to the U.S. Antarctic Program are well justified.

== Background ==

=== Early U.S. expeditions to Antarctica ===

The first Americans to work in the Antarctic were sealers and whalers who discovered many sub-Antarctic islands. They were first to explore parts of the great peninsula jutting out of the Antarctic mainland toward South America. Among them was Nathaniel Palmer, who was among the first to see Antarctica, while on board the &quot;Hero&quot; in 1820, though historians have not settled the question of who discovered Antarctica. James Eights, a geologist from Albany, New York, became the first U.S. scientist to work in Antarctica. In 1830, aboard the &quot;Annawan&quot;, Eights made investigations in the South Shetland Islands and westward along the Antarctic Peninsula.

Expeditions sponsored by several nations approached the Antarctic continent early in the 19th century. Among the leaders was Charles Wilkes, a U.S. Navy lieutenant who commanded an expedition in 1839–40 that was the first to prove the existence of the continent. His expedition mapped about of the Antarctic coastline in the Indian and Australian quadrants.

In 1928–1930 and 1933–1935, Admiral Richard E. Byrd led two privately sponsored expeditions, one that included the first flight over the South Pole in 1929, sparking U.S. interest in Antarctica. The U.S. Antarctic Service Expedition (1939–1940), under the leadership of the U.S. Navy, maintained bases at Marguerite Bay and Bay of Whales.

Operation Highjump in 1946–1947 was the largest single expedition ever to explore Antarctica, involving 13 naval vessels, numerous airplanes and more than 4,700 men. The next year, the Navy&#x27;s Operation Windmill used helicopters to complete some of the work begun during Highjump.

=== The International Geophysical Year and the Antarctic Treaty ===

In 1956–57 the U.S. Navy, during Operation Deep Freeze I, and in conjunction with research teams funded by the National Science Foundation, established seven research stations in Antarctica to prepare for the International Geophysical Year (IGY, 1957–58). The IGY was an intensive, multi-national, multi-disciplinary, global research effort designed to study a wide range of geophysical processes. Much of that effort took place in Antarctica and was crucial in establishing Antarctica as a continent for peace and science.

The international coordination that resulted from the IGY ultimately lead to the Antarctic Treaty, which was signed in 1959. Since then, Treaty nations have agreed to several addenda, including the 1991 Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty which establishes rules and procedures specifically designed to protect the Antarctic environment. The Protocol was ratified and went into effect in 1998.

== The U.S. Antarctic Program Today ==
The U.S. Antarctic Program operates three year-round research stations and two research vessels. Additional temporary field camps are constructed and operated during the austral summer.

=== McMurdo Station ===

McMurdo Station (77°51&#x27; S, 166°40&#x27; E), the largest U.S. station in Antarctica, is situated on barren volcanic hills at the southern tip of Ross Island, about south of Christchurch, New Zealand and north of the South Pole. The station sits on the eastern shore of McMurdo Sound, the southernmost body of seasonally open water in the world. Mount Erebus, a high active volcano, towers over Ross Island. On the west side of the Sound, the Royal Society Range and Mount Discovery, an extinct volcano, provide spectacular vistas. The mean annual temperature is . Temperatures may reach as high as in summer and in winter. The average wind speed is , but winds have exceeded .

McMurdo Sound is a historic area. In 1841, James Clark Ross brought his ships HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; and HMS &quot;Terror&quot; into the Sound, farther south than anyone had ever gone, before sailing eastward along a great wall of ice. He and his crew were the first humans to see the island and the ice shelf that both now bear his name. In 1902, Robert F. Scott wintered HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; in Winter Quarters Bay, adjacent to the station. Both of Scott&#x27;s (1901–1904 and 1910–1913) and Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s (1907–1909 and 1914–1916) expeditions used the area as a base to deploy sledging parties for both scientific exploration and attempts to reach the South Pole. The huts these expeditions built still stand today at Hut Point, Cape Evans, and Cape Royds.

The original station was constructed in 1955–1956. With many additions and modernizations over the years, today&#x27;s station is the primary logistics facility for airborne and overland resupply of inland stations and field science projects. The station is also the waste management center for much of the USAP.

McMurdo has two airfields. Phoenix Airfield, located about from McMurdo on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, accommodates wheeled aircraft. Williams Field Skiway, located about from McMurdo is for ski-equipped aircraft only. McMurdo also has a heliport to support helicopter operations.

Approximately 90% of USAP participants live in or pass through McMurdo Station. The austral winter population ranges from 150 to 200, with the summer population varying between 800 and 1,000. The station has routine weekly flights to and from New Zealand during the austral summer (October – February), a period called &quot;Mainbody,&quot; with fewer flights during the winter months (March – September).

=== Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station ===
South Pole Station is located at the geographic South Pole, on the polar plateau, at an elevation of 2,835 m (9,300 ft) above sea level. The station sits on an ice sheet that is 2,700 m (8,858 ft) thick and drifts with the ice at about 10 m (33 ft) a year toward the Weddell Sea.

The mean annual temperature is –49 °C (–56 °F). Average monthly temperatures range from –28 °C (–18 °F) in the summer to –60 °C (–76 °F) in winter. The record high of – 12.3 °C (9.9 °F) was recorded in December 2011, and the record low of –82.8 °C (–117 °F) was recorded in June 1982. The site has very low humidity, and precipitation is only about 20 cm of snow (8 cm water equivalent) per year. Drifting is the primary cause of snow accumulation around buildings. Average wind speed is 10.8 knots.

The original station was built in 1956-1957 and is buried beneath the ice. A second station, located under a geodesic dome, was completed in 1975. The Dome was dismantled in 2009-10 and removed from the continent. The current station was dedicated on January 12, 2008. The winter population is around 45, and the summer population averages 150.

Most Antarctic Program personnel and cargo reach the South Pole from McMurdo Station via LC-130 ski-equipped aircraft, whereas most fuel is transported via surface traverse from McMurdo Station. The short austral summer, when most activity occurs, is from late October through mid-February. The station is isolated for the rest of the year.

Research at the South Pole includes astronomy, astrophysics, aeronomy, auroral and geospace studies, meteorology, geomagnetism, seismology, earth-tide measurements, and glaciology.

=== Palmer Station ===

Palmer Station, on the Antarctic Peninsula region, is named after Nathaniel B. Palmer, the American sailor who pioneered the exploration of the Peninsula in 1820. The station is located on Anvers Island at 64°46&#x27; S, 64°03’ W and consists of two major buildings and several small ones. There is no airfield.

Located just north of the Antarctic Circle, the climate is milder than that of the other U.S. Antarctic stations. Temperatures in the summer range from just below freezing to above 4 °C (40 °F). Winter temperatures range from 0 °C (32 °F) to -10 °C (14 °F). Palmer Station is often windy and wet, with both snow and rain. The water equivalent in snow and rain averages 81 cm (32 in) per year. Wildlife is abundant near the station, which makes it superbly located for ecosystem research.

The station population is about 44 in the summer and 20 or more in winter. Unlike the South Pole and McMurdo stations, Palmer usually receives transportation year-round and does not generally have a period of winter isolation.

=== Research vessels ===
RVIB &quot;Nathaniel B. Palmer&quot; is long and is able to break of ice at a continuous forward speed of . &quot;Nathanial B. Palmer&quot; is a modern, multi-disciplinary research vessel containing six laboratories with a combined space of . It can accommodate 39 scientists and ASC personnel and operates throughout the Southern Ocean.

ASRV &quot;Laurence M. Gould&quot; is long and is capable of breaking of first-year ice while maintaining continuous forward progress. &quot;Lawrence M. Gould&quot; has berthing space to accommodate 28 scientists and ASC personnel. There are an additional nine bunks for passengers transiting to Palmer Station. &quot;Lawrence M. Gould&quot; transports personnel and cargo to and from Palmer Station and supports research in the Antarctic Peninsula region.

=== Field camps ===

Every season the Program establishes several dozen field camps to house researchers and support staff around the continent. These range in size from just two or three people in small pitched tents, to large camps of up to 60 people in temporary shelters, to permanent, hard-walled structures that teams return to year after year.

== Science ==

=== Astrophysics and Geospace ===
The Astrophysics and Geospace Sciences Program sponsors research areas that either use Antarctica as an observing platform or contribute to an understanding of the role played by the Antarctic upper atmosphere in global environmental processes.

=== Organisms and Ecosystems ===
The Organisms and Ecosystems Program supports research at all levels of biological organization, from molecular, cellular and organismal to communities and ecosystems.

=== Earth Sciences ===
The Earth Sciences Program provides insights into Antarctica&#x27;s geologic history and lead to increased understanding of processes shaping it today.

=== Glaciology ===
The Glaciology Program supports research concerned with the history and dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheet and its surrounding ice shelves. Studies of the processes controlling the mass balance and dynamics of the ice sheet are also important.

=== Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences ===
The Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences Program aims to advance understanding of the physics and chemistry of both oceanic and lower atmospheric processes, and environments at high southern latitudes, and their links at local, regional and global scales across the Antarctic continent and surrounding Southern Ocean.

=== Artists and Writers ===
The Artists and Writers Program supports participants whose work requires them to be in the Antarctic to complete their project, in particular projects that increase understanding and appreciation of the Antarctic and of human activities on the southernmost continent.

=== PolarTREC ===
PolarTREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating) is an NSF-funded program that brings teachers from the United States to the polar regions to spend three to six weeks participating in hands-on field research experiences. Managed by the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS), the goal is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing educators and polar researchers together.

== Logistics ==

Antarctica is the most remote region of the world, with no native inhabitants or infrastructure and nearly no vegetation. Working in such a hostile environment requires specialized systems to keep scientists and support staff safe and equipment operational.

=== Airplanes ===

The Antarctic Program uses a variety of aircraft to transport people and cargo to and from Antarctica, as well as throughout the continent. McMurdo Station maintains two landing strips on the adjacent McMurdo Ice Shelf: Williams Airfield for ski-equipped planes, and Phoenix Airfield for wheeled planes. U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes and unique New York Air National Guard ski-equipped LC-130s ferry people and cargo between Christchurch, New Zealand and McMurdo Station. During the peak of the Antarctic summer, the ice runways aren&#x27;t able to support the weight of wheeled aircraft and only planes that can take off and land on skis can operate.

For transportation across vast distances around the continent, the Program uses a combination of ski-equipped LC-130s and ski-equipped Basler BT-3 and Twin Otter planes through a contract with through Kenn Borek Air, Ltd.. Ski-equipped planes can land on groomed and maintained ski runways like those at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and other field camps, or in relatively smooth ungroomed snow.

=== Helicopters ===
The program maintains a small fleet of helicopters, under contract, at McMurdo Station to transport people and cargo around the immediate area of the station. Helicopters also carry scientific survey equipment and reconnoiter landing and scientific sites. Occasionally some of the helicopters will be temporarily set up at larger field camps to enable transport around an otherwise inaccessible region. The current helicopter support contract is held by Air Center Helicopters.

=== Traverses ===
Tractor-pulled convoys or “traverses” are used to transport large quantities of fuel and cargo across large distances. Every year three traverses carrying more than 100,000 gallons of fuel drive the from McMurdo Station to Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station to deliver fuel for the next year. Other &quot;science traverses&quot; transport heavy science equipment to field sites hundreds of miles from the station.

=== Vessels/boats ===

The program maintains two research vessels, RVIB &quot;Nathaniel B. Palmer&quot; and ASRV &quot;Laurence M. Gould&quot;. The ships are used to both transport people and supplies between Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula, and the port at Punta Arenas, Chile, and to embark on longer science-focused voyages to understand the Southern Ocean or visit other remote areas of the continent.

Smaller boats at Palmer Station, including inflatable rafts and larger rigid-hulled inflatable boats, are used to transport scientists around the islands near the station.

McMurdo Station is resupplied by ship at the end of every summer season. The U.S. Coast Guard heavy icebreaker Polar Star cuts a channel for a cargo ship to pass through and reach the ice pier at the station. A fuel tanker usually follows the cargo vessel to deliver fuel.

=== Vehicles and transport ===

The Program has a fleet of vehicles to meet a range of needs at each station. A variety of large and small loaders are used to move cargo and other heavy equipment around. Tracked vehicles, including PistenBullys and Hagglunds transport people and equipment over snow and ice covered regions. Smaller snowmobiles are also used for transport across snow and ice-covered areas as well. “Ivan the Terra Bus” and the large Kress are used to transport large numbers of people to and from the airfields over the ice roads of McMurdo Station. Passenger vans with wide tires are also used to transport people around McMurdo Station and Amundsen-Scott South Pole station as well. McMurdo Station also has a small fleet of pickup trucks.

=== Power/water/wastewater ===
Each station uses diesel fuel to generate electricity. At McMurdo Station, wind turbines installed by Antarctic New Zealand in 2010 supply about a third of the station&#x27;s electricity in a cooperative agreement with ANZ. Field camps have been increasingly using solar power, taking advantage of the 24 hours of daylight during the Antarctic summer.

Reverse osmosis is used to desalinate sea water for drinking at McMurdo and Palmer stations. Potable water at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, which sits atop an ice sheet nearly three kilometers (two miles) thick, is produced by melting ice.

Wastewater is treated by the base wastewater plant using the activated sludge process. The effluent is sterilized using ultra violet light and discharged back into McMurdo Sound. Waste sludge is dried by being processed with a belt filter press and then boxed up for shipment back to the United States for incineration.

=== Food ===
Each station has its own kitchen and cafeteria. Food is provided free-of-charge to program participants and official visitors. The cafeterias serve breakfast, lunch, dinners, and a midnight meal for the night shift. Each station has a range of rotating entrees. Fresh fruit and vegetables, known colloquially as “freshies,” are popular items, but because of their short shelf life are not always available.

Large field camps often have their own chef that cooks large group meals from shelf-stable supplies sent out at the beginning of their field season. At smaller field camps, cooking duties are often shared with other responsibilities amongst camp staff or researchers.

== Current Developments ==

=== AIMS ===
The Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) is a ten-year construction project to upgrade and update McMurdo Station&#x27;s infrastructure. Starting in 2021, the project will build about 370,000 square feet of new facilities, while razing several of the station&#x27;s aging structures.  

== Agencies and organizations involved ==

=== National Science Foundation ===
The NSF has overall management responsibility for U.S. activities in Antarctica. Organized through its Office of Polar Programs, it has responsibility for a range of day-to-day functions including preparing an annual budget and operational plans for consideration by the executive branch and for review and appropriation by Congress; obtaining advice from the scientific community, as needed, to develop scientific goals for NSF-supported research in Antarctica; evaluating and supporting proposals for research and education from U.S. universities, other research institutions, and federal agencies; detailed planning of logistics and transmitting logistics requirements, along with necessary funds, to elements of the Department of Defense and the United States Coast Guard; managing facilities, including the planning, design, engineering, construction, and maintenance of Antarctic infrastructure; developing a government support contract and managing a contractor charged with operating Antarctic stations and research vessels and providing related services, including construction; developing and implementing a comprehensive safety, environmental, and health program for U.S. activities in Antarctica; arranging cooperative scientific and logistics programs with other Antarctic Treaty nations; designating a senior U.S. representative in Antarctica and ensuring on-site management of field programs in Antarctica; and serving as a clearinghouse and source of information regarding Antarctic records, files, documents, and maps maintained within agencies and nongovernmental organizations.

=== Support contractors ===
Leidos is currently the prime contractor supporting the USAP. Leidos manages a team that includes partner companies performing specific support functions. Together, the companies comprising the support contractor are known collectively as the Antarctic Support Contract (ASC).
=== Department of Defense ===
The DoD provides logistical support to the Program, including airlift between Christchurch, New Zealand and McMurdo Station, continental transport aboard ski-equipped C-130s, weather forecasting, air traffic control and shipborne fuel and cargo delivery support.

=== NASA ===
NSF partners with NASA to conduct a range of scientific research in Antarctica, with the NSF-managed Antarctic Program providing the logistical support for this scientific work. It maintains a long-duration balloon facility at McMurdo Station to launch scientific payloads into the stratosphere suspended from large helium balloons. In addition, the McMurdo ground station downloads data from about a dozen polar orbiting satellites.

=== NOAA ===
NOAA maintains a facility at the South Pole that monitors the hole in the ozone layer and maintains long-term records of the relative balance of gases in the atmosphere. One of the longest and most complete record of gasses such as carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere comes from the South Pole. They also partner with the NSF for transportation to and from their penguin research facility in the South Shetland Islands.

=== Department of Homeland Security ===
The United States Coast Guard&#x27;s heavy icebreaker Polar Star breaks a channel from the sea ice edge to McMurdo Station every year and escorts the annual fuel and resupply ships.

=== Department of the Interior ===
The Department of the Interior&#x27;s Aviation Management Division provides procurement assistance, contract administration, and inspection for commercial aircraft providers contracted to the USAP. The U.S. Geological Survey holds geodetic data that support mapping in Antarctica and administers Antarctic place-name decisions.

=== Department of State ===
The Department of State is responsible for formulating foreign policy and providing foreign policy direction in regard to developing and implementing an integrated U.S. policy for Antarctica. This includes conducting foreign relations regarding Antarctica and adjudicating legal matters related to interpreting and implementing the Antarctic Treaty.

=== Department of Justice ===
The Department of Justice&#x27;s U.S. Marshals Service became the official law enforcement entity for the South Pole through an agreement with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Attorney for Hawaii. In 1989, the NSF approached the marshal for the District of Hawaii to assist in setting up a legal presence in Antarctica. The NSF sent two station managers from Antarctica to Glynco for training, and the Service appointed them as special deputies. The official swearing-in took place in Hawaii, the headquarters district for the American stations at the South Pole. The two special deputies rotate duty every other year. Special Deputy U.S. Marshals greet all visitors to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, with a lecture and warns that serious crimes committed on the continent by Americans can be prosecuted in the United States.

== SAHPR Report ==
In April 2021, the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs entered into an agreement with the Department of the Interior&#x27;s Federal Consulting Group to oversee a needs assessment of the USAP as relates to allegations of sexual harassment and assault. The Sexual Assault/Harassment Prevention and Response (SAHPR) Report was published on June 22, 2022. The report utilized focus groups and surveys from community members to paint a picture of the situation on-ice, and details response and prevention suggestions.

In response to the SAHPR report, the US Congressional Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held a hearing on December 6, 2022 called &quot;Building A Safer Antarctic Research Environment&quot;, and the NSF&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General released a related report on March 7, 2023 titled &quot;Law Enforcement Perspectives on Sexual Assault and Stalking Issues Pertaining to the United States Antarctic Program&quot;.

<doc id="1253270" wikidata="Q1343185" url="?curid=1253270" title="Alexandre Darracq">
<text>Alexandre Darracq (10 November 1855 – 1931) was a French investor, engineer, cycle manufacturer and automobile manufacturer. By 1904, Darracq was producing more than ten percent of all automobiles in France and he sold a substantial part of his business to British investors. He became fascinated by the possibilities of a rotary valve engine, put it into production and although it became a disaster for Darracq &amp; Cie, persisted in installing it in Darracq products. He was obliged to retire in June 1912 aged 56. After the Armistice his name was dropped from his Suresnes factory&#x27;s mass-produced products.

In 1906 he founded Società Anonima Italiana Darracq (S.A.I.D.) in Milan, Italy, which became [Società] Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili (A.L.F.A.) in 1910 and eventually Alfa Romeo.

==Sewing machines and cycles==
Born Pierre Alexandre Darracq in Bordeaux, France, of Basque parents, he trained as a draftsman at the Arsenal in Tarbes, in the Hautes-Pyrénées département. He later worked at the Hurtu factory manufacturing sewing machines. Darracq designed a machine that won a gold medal at the 1889 Paris exhibition. He established the Gladiator Cycle Company in 1891. He sold his very successful company in 1896 for a substantial amount and for a short time went into the business of manufacturing electric cars as well as acquiring an interest in rotary engined Millet motorcycles.

==Automobiles==
He established Automobiles Darracq France in Suresnes, near Paris where he pioneered the making of the chassis from pressed steel and the use of production machinery in place of hand labor. Despite his establishing an automobile business, and having taken driving lessons in July 1896, Darracq did not like driving cars or even being driven in them. For him, it was just pursuing his interest in manufacturing and making money.

By 1904, Darracq was producing more than ten percent of all automobiles in France. His company became involved with motor racing, winning a number of major races, including the 1905 and 1906 Vanderbilt Cup in the United States and twice setting a new land speed record in 1904 and 1905. Racing success raised the image of the Darracq marque so he was able to expand to England and form licensing partnerships.

==London==
In 1904 he sold his business to British investors who incorporated A Darracq and Co in which he held a substantial shareholding and was a director. He remained manager of the enterprise. The following year A Darracq and Company was listed on the London Stock Exchange but reformed for the purpose as A. Darracq and Company (1905) Limited. Thereafter financial control remained in London.

==Italy and Germany==
The company that became Alfa Romeo was founded by Darracq as Società Anonima Italiana Darracq (S.A.I.D.) in 1906. It became A.L.F.A. (&quot;[Società] Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili&quot;, &quot;Lombard Automobile Factory Company&quot;) on 24 June 1910, in Milan.

Darracq raised substantial capital through share issues with Cavaliere Ugo Stella, managing director of S.A.I.D and subsequently A.L.F.A., with Adam Opel in Germany and in Vitoria in the Basque region of Spain.
After personally insisting the new 1911 model employ the Henriod rotary valve engine, Alexadre Darracq resigned.

==Later life and death==
In mid-1912, Darracq resigned, having earlier sold out to British investors, and pursued other interests including running the Casino at Deauville. After World War I, he retired to the French Riviera where he joined with Belgian investors that took over the troubled luxury Hotel Negresco in Nice.

He died in 1931 at his home in Monte Carlo and was interred next to his wife Louise (1850–1920) in the family mausoleum in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

<text>(, &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot;), FP 159, is an opera in three acts, divided into twelve scenes with linking orchestral interludes, with music and libretto by Francis Poulenc, completed in 1956. Poulenc wrote the libretto for his second opera after the work of the same name by Georges Bernanos, itself based on &quot;The Song at the Scaffold&quot; by Gertrud von Le Fort. This is a fictionalized version of the story of the Martyrs of Compiègne, Carmelite nuns who, in 1794 during the closing days of the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution, were guillotined in Paris for refusing to renounce their vocation.

The world première of the opera occurred (in Italian translation) on 26 January 1957 at La Scala in Milan. The première of the French-language version took place in Paris on 21 June 1957. The United States première, in English, followed in San Francisco in September 1957.

==Development==
Bernanos had been hired in 1947 to write the dialogue for a film screenplay, through Raymond Léopold Bruckberger and the scenario writer Philippe Agostini, based on the novella &quot;&quot; (literal translation, &quot;The Last on the Scaffold&quot;, or &quot;Song at the Scaffold&quot;, the published title of the English translation) by Gertrud von Le Fort. The novella is based on the story of the Martyrs of Compiègne at the monastery of Carmelite nuns in Compiègne, northern France, in the wake of the French Revolution, specifically in 1794 at the time of state seizure of the monastery&#x27;s assets. It traces a fictional path from 1789 up to these events, when nuns of the Carmelite Order were guillotined.

The screenplay was judged unsatisfactory for a film. Bernanos died on 5 July 1948. Subsequently, his literary executor, Albert Béguin, found this manuscript. To assist Bernanos&#x27; surviving family, Béguin sought to have the work published, and requested permission from von Le Fort for publication. In January 1949, she agreed, and donated her portion of the royalties due to her, as creator of the original story, over to Bernanos&#x27; widow and children. However, von Le Fort requested that the Bernanos work be titled differently from her own novella. Béguin chose &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot; as the title for the Bernanos work, which was published in 1949. A German translation of the work, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Blessed Fear&quot;), was published in 1951, and Zurich and Munich saw productions of &quot;Die begnadete Angst&quot; that year. The French stage premiere was by Jacques Hébertot in May 1952 at the Théâtre Hébertot.

The genesis of the opera was in 1953. Margarita Wallmann took her husband, president of Ricordi, which was Poulenc&#x27;s publishing firm, to see the Bernanos play in Vienna. She had asked Poulenc to write an oratorio for her; through the commission from Ricordi, he developed the work as the opera. Wallman was the eventual producer of the La Scala première of Poulenc&#x27;s opera, and she later supervised the 1983 revival at Covent Garden. About the same time, M. Valcarenghi had approached Poulenc with a commission for a ballet for La Scala in Milan.

Separately, Poulenc had seen the Bernanos play, but the suggestion from Ricordi finalised the impetus to adapt the subject as an opera. Poulenc began to adapt the Bernanos text in the spring and summer of 1953, and to compose the music in August 1953. In October 1953, Poulenc learned of a literary rights dispute between Béguin and the American writer Emmet Lavery, who had previously secured all rights to theatrical adaptations of von Le Fort&#x27;s novel from her in April–May 1949. This was independent of the discussion, concluded in January 1949, between Béguin and von Le Fort. The two-year literary rights dispute between Béguin and Lavery reached arbitration by a jury from &quot;La Societé des Auteurs&quot; in Paris. On 20 July 1954, this jury ruled unanimously for Lavery, and ordered the Bernanos heirs to pay Lavery 100,000 FF for past contract infringements. In addition, the ruling required the Bernanos heirs to pay Lavery, with respect to all future productions of &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot;, 15% of the royalties from English-language productions, and 10% from productions in all other languages.

Poulenc had curtailed work on his opera in March 1954, in light of his understanding of the Béguin-Lavery dispute. Following the July 1954 decision, separate negotiations occurred between Béguin and Lavery, via his agent Marie Schebeko, on rights and royalties to allow Poulenc to write his opera. The formal agreement was dated 30 March 1955, and acknowledged Bernanos, Lavery, von Le Fort, Bruckberger, and Agostini. The terms stipulated that the Poulenc opera was adapted from Bernanos &#x27;with the authorization of Monsieur Emmet Lavery&#x27;, with Lavery listed in the credits after Bernanos and before von Le Fort, without any contribution of material by Lavery to the libretto. Poulenc then resumed work on the opera, and completed it October 1955.

At this time, Poulenc had recommitted himself to spirituality and Roman Catholicism, although he was openly gay and the church officially opposed homosexuality. Opera critic Alan Rich believes that Poulenc&#x27;s concern for the travails of post-World War II France, as it tried to reconcile issues related to the Holocaust, German occupation and the Resistance, was a subtext within the opera. Wallmann worked closely with Poulenc during the composition process and in evolving the structure, as well as later when she re-staged the production in other theatres. The libretto is unusually deep in its psychological study of the contrasting characters of Mother Marie de l&#x27;Incarnation and Blanche de la Force. 

Rodney Milnes describes Bernanos&#x27; text as &quot;concise and clear&quot; and that like &quot;all good librettos it suggests far more than it states&quot;.

==Analysis==
Poulenc set his libretto largely in recitative. His own religious devotions are particularly evident in the setting of the Qui Lazarum resuscitasti in Act II, Scene I, the &quot;Ave Maria&quot; in Act II, Scene II, and the &quot;Ave verum corpus&quot; in Act II, Scene IV. During the final tableau of the opera, which takes place in the Place de la Nation, the distinct sound of the guillotine&#x27;s descending blade is heard repeatedly over the orchestra and the singing of the nuns of the Salve Regina, who are taken one by one, until only Soeur Constance and Blanche de la Force remain.

Poulenc acknowledged his debt to Mussorgsky, Monteverdi, Verdi, and Debussy in his dedication of the opera, with the casual remark:

: &quot;You must forgive my Carmelites. It seems they can only sing tonal music.&quot;

Music critic Anthony Tommasini has commented on the opera:
: &quot;Poulenc&#x27;s subtle and intricate tonal language is by turns hymnal and haunting. Though scored for a large orchestra, the instruments are often used in smaller groups selected for particular effects and colorings. The most distinctive element of the score, though, is its wonderfully natural vocal writing, which captures the rhythms and lyrical flow of the libretto in eloquent music that hardly calls attention to itself yet lingers with you.&quot;

Opera historian Charles Osborne wrote:

: &quot;The inexorable dramatic movement of the work is impressive and, in the final scene in which the nuns walk in procession to the guillotine chanting the &quot;Salve regina&quot;, extremely moving. Poulenc also found an easy and effective style with which to carry forward without monotony the scenes of convent life.&quot;

Philip Hensher has commented on the unique place of this opera in its depiction of convent life:

: &quot;...unlike every other opera about nuns, it finds space for a serious discussion about religion and the workings of divine grace that is never saccharine or merely consolatory: how hard it is to be good, how unsure the rewards of virtue.&quot;

==Performance history==
Poulenc expressed a general wish that the opera be performed in the vernacular of the local audience. Thus the opera was first performed in an Italian translation at La Scala on 26 January 1957, with Romanian soprano Virginia Zeani in the role of Blanche. The original French version premiered on 21 June that year by the Théâtre National de l&#x27;Opéra de Paris (the current Opéra National de Paris), where Poulenc had chosen the Paris cast, which included Denise Duval (Blanche de la Force), Régine Crespin (Madame Lidoine), Rita Gorr (Mother Marie), and Liliane Berton (Sister Constance).

The United States premiere took place three months later, on 20 September, in English, at San Francisco Opera, which featured the professional opera stage debut of Leontyne Price (as Madame Lidoine). The opera was first presented in New York City on 3 March 1966, in a staging by New York City Opera. The Metropolitan Opera first staged the opera in 1977, in a production by John Dexter, sung in the English translation of Joseph Machlis. The 1980 revival of this production utilised the original French text. Subsequent performances, until 2013, were generally sung in the English translation. From 2013 revivals of this production used the original French text, with the 2019 series included as part of the Live in HD cinema series for that season.

The opera is among a comparatively small number of post-Puccini works that have never lost their place in the international repertory.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
:Place: Paris and Compiègne, 1789–94
:Time: during the French Revolution

=== Act 1 ===
The opera opens with Marquis and Chevalier de la Force talking about the general unrest in France and their worries about Blanche, at a time when crowds stop carriages in the street and aristocrats are attacked. The pathologically timid Blanche de la Force decides to retreat from the world and enter a Carmelite convent. The Mother Superior informs her that the Carmelite Order is not a refuge; it is the duty of the nuns to guard the Order, not the other way around. In the convent, the chatterbox Sister Constance tells Blanche (to her consternation) that she has had a dream that the two of them will die young together. The prioress, who is dying, commits Blanche to the care of Mother Marie. The Mother Superior passes away in great agony, shouting in her delirium that despite her long years of service to God, He has abandoned her. Blanche and Mother Marie, who witness her death, are shaken.

=== Act 2 ===
Sister Constance remarks to Blanche that the prioress&#x27; death seemed unworthy of her, and speculates that she had been given the wrong death, as one might be given the wrong coat in a cloakroom. She said that perhaps someone else will find death surprisingly easy. Perhaps we die not for ourselves alone, but for each other.

Blanche&#x27;s brother, the Chevalier de la Force, arrives to announce that their father thinks Blanche should withdraw from the convent, since she is not safe there (being both an aristocrat and the member of a religious community, at a time of anti-aristocracy and anti-clericalism in the rising revolutionary tides). Blanche refuses, saying that she has found happiness in the Carmelite Order. Later she admits to Mother Marie that it is fear (or the fear of fear itself, as the Chevalier expresses it) that keeps her from leaving.

The chaplain announces that he has been forbidden to preach (presumably for being a non-juror under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy). The nuns remark on how fear rules the country, and no one has the courage to stand up for the priests. Sister Constance asks, &quot;Are there no men left to come to the aid of the country?&quot; &quot;When priests are lacking, martyrs are superabundant,&quot; replies the new Mother Superior. Mother Marie says that the Carmelites can save France by giving their lives, but the Mother Superior corrects her: it is not permitted to choose to become a martyr; God decides who will be martyred.

A police officer arrives and announces to the community that the Legislative Assembly has nationalized the convent and its property, and the nuns must give up their religious habits. When Mother Marie acquiesces, the officer taunts her for being eager to dress like everyone else. She replies that the nuns will continue to serve, no matter how they are dressed. &quot;The people have no need of servants,&quot; proclaims the officer haughtily. &quot;No, but they have a great need for martyrs,&quot; responds Mother Marie. &quot;In times like these, death is nothing,&quot; he says. &quot;Life is nothing,&quot; she answers, &quot;when it is so debased.&quot;

=== Act 3 ===
In the absence of the new prioress, Mother Marie proposes that the nuns take a vow of martyrdom. However, all must agree, or Mother Marie will not insist. A secret vote is held; there is one dissenting voice. Sister Constance declares that she was the dissenter, and that she has changed her mind, so the vow can proceed. Blanche runs away from the convent, and Mother Marie goes to look for her, finding her in her father&#x27;s library. Her father has been guillotined, and Blanche has been forced to serve her former servants.

The nuns are all arrested and condemned to death, but Mother Marie is away at the time of the arrest. Upon receiving the news, the chaplain tells Mother Marie, when they meet again, that since God has chosen to spare her, she cannot voluntarily become a martyr by joining the others in prison.

At the place of execution, one nun after another stands and slowly processes toward the guillotine, as all sing the &quot;Salve Regina&quot; (&quot;Hail, Holy Queen&quot;). At the last moment, Blanche appears, to Constance&#x27;s joy, to join her condemned sisters. Having seen all the other nuns executed, as she mounts the scaffold, Blanche sings the final stanza of the &quot;Veni Creator Spiritus,&quot; &quot;Deo Patri sit gloria...&quot;, the Catholic hymn traditionally used when taking vows in a religious community and offering one&#x27;s life to God.

<text>The Hartle–Hawking state, also known as the no-boundary wave function is a proposal in theoretical physics concerning the state of the universe prior to the Planck epoch. It is named after James Hartle and Stephen Hawking.

==History==
According to the Hartle–Hawking proposal, the universe has no origin as we would understand it: before the Big Bang, which happened about 13.8 billion years ago, the universe was a singularity in both space and time. Hartle and Hawking suggest that if we could travel backwards in time towards the beginning of the universe, we would note that quite near what might have been the beginning, time gives way to space so that there is only space and no time.

== Technical explanation ==

More precisely, the Hartle-Hawking state is a hypothetical vector in the Hilbert space of a theory of quantum gravity that describes the wave function of the universe. 

It is a functional of the metric tensor defined at a (&quot;D&quot; − 1)-dimensional compact surface, the universe, where &quot;D&quot; is the spacetime dimension. The precise form of the Hartle–Hawking state is the path integral over all &quot;D&quot;-dimensional geometries that have the required induced metric on their boundary. According to the theory, time, as it is currently observed, diverged from a three-state dimension after the universe was in the age of the Planck time.

Such a wave function of the universe can be shown to satisfy, approximately, the Wheeler–DeWitt equation.

<text>Louis Delâge (22 March 1874 – 14 December 1947) was a French pioneer automotive engineer and manufacturer.

Born Pierre Louis Delâge to a family of modest means in Cognac. As an infant he lost the sight in one eye. At the age of 16 he went to study at Arts et Métiers ParisTech in Angers, graduating with an engineering degree in 1893. Delage then fulfilled his military obligation and was stationed in Algeria. Discharged in 1895, he found work with a railway company in southern France; in 1900 he moved to Paris. There he worked in the engineering and design department of a motor vehicle manufacturing concern until 1903 when he received an offer to join the fledgling Renault automobile company.

Delâge realized the enormous potential for the automobile as demand soon began to outstrip production. Filled with innovative ideas, in 1905 he raised enough money to open an assembly plant in a converted barn in Levallois at the outskirts of Paris. The Delage Automobile Company grew rapidly and their vehicles gained a reputation for stylish appearance and quality and as a dominant force in motor racing. The Great Depression of the 1930s took its toll and car sales plummeted. By 1935 his company was forced into liquidation, and the rights to the Delage name were auctioned to the Delahaye car company. The new owners unceremoniously dismissed Delâge with a penurious pension. 

Louis Delâge was nearly 60 when he found himself in a financial crisis worsened by his divorce. He sought solace in his Roman Catholic faith, and because he was too poor to afford a car, he often made the pilgrimage on foot or by bicycle to the sacred convent of Saint Thérèse in the city of Lisieux and to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes. In 1947, at the age of 73 and nearly impoverished, Louis Delâge died. He is interred in the cemetery in Le Pecq. 

In 1990, in his hometown of Cognac, an industrial school was dedicated as the &quot;Lycée professionnel Louis Delâge&quot; in his memory.

<text>Karl Münchinger (29 May 1915 – 13 March 1990) was a German conductor of European classical music. He helped to revive the now-ubiquitous Canon in D by Johann Pachelbel, through recording it with his Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra in 1960. (Jean-François Paillard made a rival, and also very popular, recording of the same piece at around the same time.) Münchinger is also noted for restoring baroque traditions to the interpretation of Bach&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot;, his greatest musical love — moderate-sized forces, judicious ornamentation, and rhythmic sprightliness, though not on &quot;period instruments&quot;.

Born in Stuttgart, Münchinger studied at the Hochschule für Musik in his home city. At first, he guest-conducted often, supporting himself also with other duties as an organist and church choir director. In 1941, he became principal conductor of the Hanover Symphony, a post he held for the next two years. He held no other conducting position until the end of World War II.

The year that the war ended, he founded the Stuttgarter Kammerorchester (Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra), which he built into an impressive touring ensemble; it made its Paris debut in 1949 and its American debut in San Francisco in 1953. Under his leadership the orchestra issued (for the Decca label) numerous recordings, mostly during the 1950s and 1960s, and mostly of Bach&#x27;s output; these included the &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot; (three times), the orchestral suites, the &quot;St. Matthew Passion&quot;, the &quot;St. John Passion&quot;, &quot;The Musical Offering&quot;, and the &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot;. Of his and the ensemble&#x27;s non-Bach releases, probably the best — and certainly the most famous, other than the Pachelbel performance mentioned earlier — is that of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot;.

In 1977, the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra became the first German ensemble to visit the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Münchinger retired in 1988, two years before his death.

Stylistically, Münchinger&#x27;s approach with his orchestra was rather similar to those of his somewhat younger contemporaries Raymond Leppard, Sir Neville Marriner, Claudio Scimone, and the above-mentioned Paillard, though displaying an extra element of tonal solidity — not to mention a fierce rigor during rehearsals as well as performances — which might be considered Teutonic. With the increased fashionability of 18th-century instruments, from the 1970s onward, Münchinger&#x27;s interpretations fell dramatically from critical favor and were often dismissed as &quot;passé&quot;, though he always showed himself to be a fine, tough, disciplined, and sensitive musician. There have been more profoundly imaginative German conductors than Münchinger, but there have been very few who matched his consistently high standards.

<doc id="1253292" wikidata="Q411417" url="?curid=1253292" title="Cefalexin">
<text>Cefalexin, also spelled cephalexin, is an antibiotic that can treat a number of bacterial infections. It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting the growth of the bacterial cell wall. Cefalexin is a β-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation cephalosporins. It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous cefazolin, but can be taken by mouth.
Cefalexin can treat certain bacterial infections, including those of the middle ear, bone and joint, skin, and urinary tract. It may also be used for certain types of pneumonia and strep throat and to prevent bacterial endocarditis. Cefalexin is not effective against infections caused by methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA), most &quot;Enterococcus&quot;, or &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;. Like other antibiotics, cefalexin cannot treat viral infections, such as the flu, common cold or acute bronchitis. Cefalexin can be used in those who have mild or moderate allergies to penicillin. However, it is not recommended in those with severe penicillin allergies.
Common side effects include stomach upset and diarrhea. Allergic reactions or infections with &quot; Clostridioides difficile&quot;, a cause of diarrhea, are also possible. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding does not appear to be harmful to the fetus. It can be used in children and those over 65 years of age. Those with kidney problems may require a decrease in dose.
Cefalexin was developed in 1967. It was first marketed in 1969 under the brand name Keflex. It is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 101st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6million prescriptions. In Canada, it was the fifth most common antibiotic used in 2013. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023.

==Medical uses==
Cefalexin can treat a number of bacterial infections including otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, bone and joint infections, pneumonia, cellulitis, and urinary tract infections. It may be used to prevent bacterial endocarditis. It can also be used for the prevention of recurrent urinary-tract infections.

Cefalexin does not treat methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; infections.

Cefalexin is a useful alternative to penicillins in patients with penicillin intolerance. For example, penicillin is the treatment of choice for respiratory tract infections caused by &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, but cefalexin may be used as an alternative in penicillin-intolerant patients. Caution must be exercised when administering cephalosporin antibiotics to penicillin-sensitive patients, because cross-sensitivity with β-lactam antibiotics has been documented in up to 10% of patients with a documented penicillin allergy.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
It is categorized in category A in Australia meaning that no evidence of harm has been found after being taken by many pregnant women. Use during breastfeeding is generally safe.

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse effects of cefalexin, like other oral cephalosporins, are gastrointestinal (stomach area) disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions. Gastrointestinal disturbances include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, the latter being the most common. Hypersensitivity reactions include skin rashes, urticaria, fever, and anaphylaxis. Pseudomembranous colitis and &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; have been reported with use of cefalexin. Less common and more serious side effects include bruising of the skin and yellowing of the skin or eye whites.

Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, trouble breathing, or red, blistered, swollen, or peeling skin. Overall, cefalexin allergy occurs in less than 0.1% of patients. Evidence suggests that it is seen in 1% to 10% of patients with a penicillin allergy.

== Interactions ==

Like other β-lactam antibiotics, renal excretion of cefalexin is delayed by probenecid. It is also not recommended to take cefalexin with dofetilide, live Cholera vaccine, warfarin, and cholestyramine. Alcohol consumption reduces the rate at which it is absorbed. Cefalexin also interacts with metformin, an antidiabetic drug, and this can lead to higher concentrations of metformin in the body. Histamine H2 receptor antagonists like cimetidine and ranitidine may reduce the efficacy of cefalexin by delaying its absorption and altering its antimicrobial pharmacodynamics. Zinc and zinc supplements also interact with cefalexin and may reduce the amount of cefalexin in the body.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Cefalexin is a β-lactam antibiotic of the cephalosporin family. It is bactericidal and acts by inhibiting synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. As cefalexin closely resembles d-alanyl-d-alanine, an amino acid ending on the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, it can irreversibly bind to the active site of PBP, which is essential for the synthesis of the cell wall. It is most active against gram-positive cocci, and has moderate activity against some gram-negative bacilli. However, some bacterial cells have the enzyme β-lactamase, which hydrolyzes the β-lactam ring, rendering the drug inactive. This contributes to antibacterial resistance towards cefalexin.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Cefalexin is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with oral administration. Absorption is slightly reduced when it is taken with food and the medication can be taken without regard for meals. Peak levels of cefalexin occur about 1 hour after administration. Maximal levels of cefalexin increase approximately linearly over a dose range of 250 to 1,000 mg.

Like most other cephalosporins, cefalexin is not metabolized or otherwise inactivated in the body.

The elimination half-life of cefalexin is approximately 30 to 60 minutes in people with normal renal function. Therapeutic levels of cefalexin with oral administration are maintained for 6 to 8 hours. More than 90% of cefalexin is excreted unchanged in the urine within 8 hours.

==Society and culture==
It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies cefalexin as highly important for human medicine.

===Names===
Cefalexin is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and the Australian Approved Name (AAN), while cephalexin is the British Approved Name (BAN) and the United States Adopted Name (USAN). Brand names for cefalexin include Keflex, Acfex, Cephalex, Ceporex, L-Xahl, Medoxine, Ospexin, Torlasporin, Bio-Cef, Panixine DisperDose, and Novo-Lexin.

== Veterinary uses ==
=== Dogs ===
According to Plumb&#x27;s Veterinary Medication Guides, cefalexin can be used in treating skin, respiratory tract, and urinary tract infections. Specifically, it can treat pyoderma in dogs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved it for use in humans and dogs but not for other species. Like other drugs approved for human use, cefalexin may be prescribed by veterinarians for animals in certain situations.

Cefalexin (Lexylan) is indicated for the treatment of cattle, dogs, and cats in the European Union.

<text>In mathematics and theoretical physics, the induced metric is the metric tensor defined on a submanifold that is induced from the metric tensor on a manifold into which the submanifold is embedded, through the pullback. It may be determined using the following formula (using the Einstein summation convention), which is the component form of the pullback operation:

:formula_1

Here formula_2, formula_3 describe the indices of coordinates formula_4 of the submanifold while the functions formula_5 encode the embedding into the higher-dimensional manifold whose tangent indices are denoted formula_6, formula_7.

==Example – Curve in 3D ==

Let
: formula_8

be a map from the domain of the curve formula_9 with parameter formula_10 into the Euclidean manifold formula_11. Here formula_12 are constants.

Then there is a metric given on formula_11 as

:formula_14.

and we compute

:formula_15

Therefore formula_16

<doc id="1253305" wikidata="Q1368870" url="?curid=1253305" title="Wheeler–DeWitt equation">
<text>The Wheeler–DeWitt equation for theoretical physics and applied mathematics, is a field equation attributed to John Archibald Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt. The equation attempts to mathematically combine the ideas of quantum mechanics and general relativity, a step towards a theory of quantum gravity.

In this approach, time plays a role different from what it does in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, leading to the so-called &quot;problem of time&quot;. More specifically, the equation describes the quantum version of the Hamiltonian constraint using metric variables. Its commutation relations with the diffeomorphism constraints generate the Bergman–Komar &quot;group&quot; (which &quot;is&quot; the diffeomorphism group on-shell).

== Motivation and background ==
In canonical gravity, spacetime is foliated into spacelike submanifolds. The three-metric (i.e., metric on the hypersurface) is formula_1 and given by
formula_2
In that equation the Latin indices run over the values 1, 2, 3, and the Greek indices run over the values 1, 2, 3, 4. The three-metric formula_1 is the field, and we denote its conjugate momenta as formula_4. The Hamiltonian is a constraint (characteristic of most relativistic systems)
formula_5
where formula_6, and formula_7 is the Wheeler–DeWitt metric. In index-free notation, the Wheeler–DeWitt metric on the space of positive definite quadratic forms &quot;g&quot; in three dimensions is
formula_8

Quantization &quot;puts hats&quot; on the momenta and field variables; that is, the functions of numbers in the classical case become operators that modify the state function in the quantum case. Thus we obtain the operator
formula_9
Working in &quot;position space&quot;, these operators are
formula_10

One can apply the operator to a general wave functional of the metric formula_11 where
formula_12
which would give a set of constraints amongst the coefficients formula_13. This means that the amplitudes for formula_14 gravitons at certain positions are related to the amplitudes for a different number of gravitons at different positions. Or, one could use the two-field formalism, treating formula_15 as an independent field, so that the wave function is formula_16.

== Mathematical formalism ==
The Wheeler–DeWitt equation is a functional differential equation. It is ill-defined in the general case, but very important in theoretical physics, especially in quantum gravity. It is a functional differential equation on the space of three-dimensional spatial metrics. The Wheeler–DeWitt equation has the form of an operator acting on a wave functional; the functional reduces to a function in cosmology. Contrary to the general case, the Wheeler–DeWitt equation is well defined in minisuperspaces like the configuration space of cosmological theories. An example of such a wave function is the Hartle–Hawking state. Bryce DeWitt first published this equation in 1967 under the name &quot;Einstein–Schrödinger equation&quot;; it was later renamed the &quot;Wheeler–DeWitt equation&quot;.

===Hamiltonian constraint===

Simply speaking, the Wheeler–DeWitt equation says

where formula_17 is the Hamiltonian constraint in quantized general relativity, and formula_18 stands for the wave function of the universe. Unlike ordinary quantum field theory or quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is a first-class constraint on physical states. We also have an independent constraint for each point in space.

Although the symbols formula_19 and formula_18 may appear familiar, their interpretation in the Wheeler–DeWitt equation is substantially different from non-relativistic quantum mechanics. formula_18 is no longer a spatial wave function in the traditional sense of a complex-valued function that is defined on a 3-dimensional space-like surface and normalized to unity. Instead it is a functional of field configurations on all of spacetime. This wave function contains all of the information about the geometry and matter content of the universe. formula_19 is still an operator that acts on the Hilbert space of wave functions, but it is not the same Hilbert space as in the nonrelativistic case, and the Hamiltonian no longer determines the evolution of the system, so the Schrödinger equation formula_23 no longer applies. This property is known as timelessness. Various attempts to incorporate time in a fully quantum framework have been made, starting with the &quot;Page and Wootters mechanism&quot; and other subsequent proposals. The reemergence of time was also proposed as arising from quantum correlations between an evolving system and a reference quantum clock system, the concept of system-time entanglement is introduced as a quantifier of the actual distinguishable evolution undergone by the system. 

===Momentum constraint===

We also need to augment the Hamiltonian constraint with momentum constraints
: formula_24
associated with spatial diffeomorphism invariance.

In minisuperspace approximations, we only have one Hamiltonian constraint (instead of infinitely many of them).

In fact, the principle of general covariance in general relativity implies that global evolution per se does not exist; the time formula_25 is just a label we assign to one of the coordinate axes. Thus, what we think about as time evolution of any physical system is just a gauge transformation, similar to that of QED induced by U(1) local gauge transformation formula_26 where formula_27 plays the role of local time. The role of a Hamiltonian is simply to restrict the space of the &quot;kinematic&quot; states of the Universe to that of &quot;physical&quot; states—the ones that follow gauge orbits. For this reason we call it a &quot;Hamiltonian constraint&quot;. Upon quantization, physical states become wave functions that lie in the kernel of the Hamiltonian operator.

In general, the Hamiltonian vanishes for a theory with general covariance or time-scaling invariance.

<text>Émile Delahaye (16 October 1843 – 1 June 1905) was a French automotive pioneer who founded Delahaye Automobiles.

Émile Delahaye was born in Tours, Indre-et-Loire. He studied engineering at Arts et Métiers Paris Technical trade school in Angers, the same educational institution later attended by Louis Delâge, another French automobile pioneer. 

For a time, Delahaye worked in Belgium, at the Crail Engineering works, a company known for making steam locomotives. He returned to Tours following the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, where he went to work for Monsieur Berthon, the proprietor of the Berthon Foundry And Machineworks, as his administrative assistant and senior engineer.

Delahaye married in 1873 but the couple were not young enough to conceive any children. In 1879 Delahaye assumed control of the Brethon Foundry and Machine-works, a business manufacturing brick kilns and related equipment for the ceramics trade. Delahaye experimented with steam and internal combustion engines, eventually converting part of the company&#x27;s production to manufacturing stationary petrol engines for pumps. 

In 1894, he displayed his first automobile at the inaugural Paris Motor Show, held in a large Paris art gallery. Aside from the myriad motorized bicycles and tricycles, Delahaye&#x27;s was one of only two automobiles entered.

To publicize his product, Delahaye raced one of his cars in the 1896 Paris–Marseille–Paris road race. Faced with health problems, and realizing the need for additional invested capital, better machine tools, and larger assembly space, Delahaye partnered with two Paris industrialists, brothers-in-law Leon Desmarais and Georges Morane. By 1898 the newly incorporated owners relocated their automobile production from Tours to the industrial building in the Gobelin district of Paris that Desmarais and Morane inherited. By 1901 Delahaye&#x27;s rapidly deteriorating health forced him to step down as President. He sold his shares to his partners, and retired to the French Riviera where he died in 1905.

The company Delahaye founded survived until 31 December 1954.

<doc id="1253317" wikidata="Q522408" url="?curid=1253317" title="Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)">
<text>Ruslan and Lyudmila ( ) is an opera in five acts (eight tableaux) composed by Mikhail Glinka between 1837 and 1842.

The libretto was written in Russian by Valerian Shirkov, with minor contributions by Mykola Markevych, Nestor Kukolnik, and the composer based on the 1820 narrative poem of the same name by Alexander Pushkin. Pushkin had planned to write the libretto himself but died in a duel before he could do so.

Today, the best-known music from the opera is its overture.

==Performance history==
The premiere took place in Saint Petersburg on 27 November(Old Style) 1842 at the Bolshoi Kamenniy Teatr. The initial lack of enthusiasm for this Russian-inspired production has been attributed to the Saint Petersburg&#x27;s audience&#x27;s growing taste at the time for Italian opera, which was so pronounced that in 1843, Tsar Nicholas I established an Italian opera company in the Bolshoi Kamenniy Teatr, and the Russian opera company lost its home. Four years later, the opera was given its Moscow premiere at the Bolshoi Theatre in 1846. The opera has been a mainstay of the Bolshoi, having staged over 700 performances in 9 different productions over the past 165 years.

The opera was first performed in the UK on 4 June 1931 at the Lyceum Theatre in London and in the US as a concert version in New York on 26 December 1942. It was given its first staged performance in the US by Sarah Caldwell&#x27;s Opera Company of Boston on 5 March 1977.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==

&quot;Time&quot;: The time of Kievan Rus&#x27; (9th to 13th centuries)
&quot;Place&quot;: Kiev; various imaginary and fantastic locations

===Act 1===
In Svetozar&#x27;s banquet hall, the wedding feast for Ruslan and Lyudmila is taking place. The guests listen to Bayan sing a song foretelling misfortune for the bride and groom, followed by happiness from true love. Lyudmila, saddened by the prospect of leaving her father, offers words of comfort to her unsuccessful suitors, Farlaf and Ratmir, and then pledges herself to Ruslan. Svetozar blesses the couple. All of a sudden everything goes dark and there is a crash of thunder. The people are paralysed by a spell while two monsters carry Lyudmila away. When light returns and everyone recovers, they panic over Lyudmila&#x27;s disappearance. Svetozar promises half his kingdom and Lyudmila&#x27;s hand to the man who brings her back. The three suitors ready themselves for the journey to find Lyudmila.

===Act 2===
&quot;Tableau 1&quot;

Ruslan comes upon the cave of the kindly wizard Finn, who tells him that the evil sorcerer Chernomor has absconded with Lyudmila and that Ruslan is the man who will destroy him. Ruslan asks Finn why he lives in this deserted place, and Finn relates the story of many years ago, when he was a shepherd in his distant homeland (he says he is &quot;a Finn&quot;) and fell in love with a beautiful girl named Naina. When she rejected his declaration of love, he went off to do battle with enemies for booty. Returning with this booty, he presented it to Naina, but she yet again spurned him. Then he resolved to study magic to win her; many years went by, and through sorcery he finally summoned an old, grey-haired, humpbacked woman – it was Naina, who now was mad with passion for him. He ran away from her and has been hiding from her ever since. For abandoning her, Naina is consumed by vengeful hatred, which will likewise fall upon Ruslan. Assuring him that Lyudmila will not be harmed, Finn instructs Ruslan to head north, and the two of them exit in opposite directions.

&quot;Tableau 2&quot;

In a deserted place, the cowardly Farlaf wonders whether he should continue searching for Lyudmila, when the decrepit Naina approaches him. She promises to get Lyudmila for him and send Ruslan far away. She disappears, and Farlaf rejoices in his triumph.
&quot;Tableau 3&quot;

Ruslan, having come upon a foggy desert strewn with weapons and bones from a past battle, wonders at the cause of this scene and whether he, too, may end up the same way. He chooses a new shield and spear from the ground to replace his broken weaponry, but cannot find a sword heavy enough to complete his new set of armor. When the fog lifts, a giant Head is revealed and blows through its lips to bring up a storm so as to drive Ruslan away. When Ruslan strikes the head with his spear, the Head falls back and reveals a sword underneath. He takes it and asks the Head whence it came. As it is dying, the Head explains that it once was a giant, and his dwarf brother is the evil sorcerer Chernomor. The sword was destined to kill both of them; so, in order to forestall fate, Chernomor tricked the giant, beheaded him, and flew his live head away to the distant desert to keep the sword protected underneath it. With the sword now in Ruslan&#x27;s hands, the Head calls for vengeance on Chernomor.

===Act 3===
Young maidens are luring passing travelers to enter Naina&#x27;s magical castle. Gorislava appears, looking for Ratmir, who had taken her captive and then abandoned her. After she goes away for a moment, Ratmir himself comes on the scene and falls under the spell of the maidens, who seduce him with dance. The final guest attracted to the castle is Ruslan, who finds himself forgetting Lyudmila upon seeing Gorislava. Suddenly Finn appears; and, after pronouncing a happy fate for Ratmir with Gorislava, and for Ruslan with Lyudmila, the castle turns into a forest as they resolve to rescue Lyudmila.

===Act 4===

Within Chernomor&#x27;s magical gardens, Lyudmila longs for Ruslan and resists the influence of the enchanted surroundings. Chernomor with his retinue arrives; dances are performed. A trumpet call signals a challenge from Ruslan. Chernomor puts Lyudmila under a sleeping spell and goes off to fight Ruslan, who shortly comes on the scene triumphantly wearing Chernomor&#x27;s beard around his helmet. Although he is disheartened by Lyudmila&#x27;s condition, Ruslan, along with Ratmir and Gorislava, resolve to return to Kiev with Lyudmila to seek the aid of the magicians there. Chernomor&#x27;s former slaves freely come along.

===Act 5===
&quot;Tableau 1&quot;

In a moonlit valley, Ruslan, Ratmir, and Gorislava, with Lyudmila, have camped for the night. Ratmir, who is standing guard, worries about Ruslan, and then expresses his happiness at his reunion with Gorislava. Suddenly the slaves report that Lyudmila once again has been abducted and that Ruslan has left in search of her. Finn appears, gives a magic ring to Ratmir that will awaken Lyudmila when she is brought back to Kiev.

&quot;Tableau 2&quot;

Lyudmila lies asleep in Svetozar&#x27;s banquet hall. It turns out that Farlaf, with Naina&#x27;s assistance, kidnapped Lyudmila and brought her to Kiev so as to appear to have been her rescuer. However, he cannot waken her. Horses approach, and Ruslan, Ratmir, and Gorislava arrive. Ruslan brings the magic ring to Lyudmila, and she awakens. As the tableau opens onto a view of Kiev, the people rejoice in their gods, their motherland, and the young couple.

==Analysis==

As with &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot;, &quot;Ruslan&quot; employs some aspects of Russian folk music; it is also noted for imaginative use of dissonance, chromaticism, and Eastern elements. Of particular consequence is the use of the whole tone scale for the first time in Russian music. It is particularly associated thematically with Chernomor and, as a result, became so popular among Russian composers for suggesting evil or ominous personages or situations, that even today Russian musicians refer to the whole tone scale as &quot;gamma Chernomora&quot;, or &quot;Chernomor&#x27;s scale&quot;.

The rollicking overture is one of the best known orchestral showpieces in the West and known for being a nightmare for bassists. An orchestral feature of act 1 is the use of piano and harp to suggest the timbre of the gusli. Glinka&#x27;s debt to Western operatic models is abundantly apparent in Farlaf&#x27;s Rondo, a Russian emulation of Figaro&#x27;s &quot;Largo al factotum&quot; from Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;.

Glinka&#x27;s variation treatment of folk melody crystallized in &quot;Ruslan&quot; into what has been called his influential &quot;changing background technique&quot;, used, for example, in Finn&#x27;s ballad and the Head&#x27;s narrative, but seen to best advantage in the Persian Chorus that opens act 3, where the tune remains intact through five statements while the orchestral background is changed completely on each repetition.

Along with its counterpart &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot;, this second opera by Glinka confirmed a Russian national operatic foundation that was to be built upon by the next generation of Russian composers. In particular, &quot;Ruslan&quot; served as the model for Russian operatic fairy tales, particularly those of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.

==In popular culture==
The 1992 video game &quot;Tetris Classic&quot; incorporated the opera&#x27;s overture as its title theme, and arranged selections of the opera are featured throughout the game. The overture was also used as the theme tune for the TV series &quot;Mom&quot;, the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Oscar&#x27;s Orchestra&quot;, and the BBC Radio 4 sitcom &quot;Cabin Pressure&quot;.

<doc id="1253318" wikidata="Q2890134" url="?curid=1253318" title="Ronald Pelton">
<text>Ronald William Pelton (November 18, 1941 – September 6, 2022) was a National Security Agency (NSA) intelligence analyst who was convicted in 1986 of spying for and selling secrets to the Soviet Union. One such top secret operation he compromised was Operation Ivy Bells.

==Early life==
Pelton was born in Benton Harbor, Michigan, and graduated in 1960 in the upper 25 percent of his high school class.

==Career==
Prior to his employment by the NSA, Pelton served in the United States Air Force. He was taught the Russian language by the Air Force and served for a time in the early 1960s in Peshawar, Pakistan, as a voice intercept processing specialist. After that 15-month tour, he was transferred to the National Security Agency, where he continued as a civilian employee upon discharge.

Pelton filed for personal bankruptcy in 1979 and resigned from his $24,500-a-year job ($ today) with the NSA A Group. From 1980 to 1984 he held several jobs, none within the intelligence community. In 1984, Pelton faced financial difficulties due to increasing homeowners&#x27; taxes and a mounting series of necessary repairs on his private residence.

===Defection to the Soviet Union===
Pelton contacted the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., on January 14, 1980, and arranged for a meeting at the embassy. The FBI had surveillance on the embassy and had tapped the phone. Therefore, it anticipated the arrival of the caller but was unable to observe him in time to determine his identity. He was debriefed by KGB officer Vitaly Yurchenko and disclosed Operation Ivy Bells, an NSA and United States Navy program to surreptitiously wiretap undersea communication cables to monitor Soviet military communications and track Soviet submarines.

On trips to Vienna in 1980 and 1983, Pelton stayed at the residence of the Soviet Ambassador to Austria and underwent debriefing sessions that sometimes lasted eight hours a day with KGB officer Anatoly Slavnov. Even though Pelton had left the NSA, he may have continued to be valuable to the Soviets as an intelligence consultant, helping them interpret data obtained from other sources. Pelton had no classified documents to offer but relied on his memory to provide information. He was paid about $37,000 by the Soviets.

===Capture and incarceration===
In 1985, KGB officer Vitaly Yurchenko defected to the United States and, among other things, recalled that he had met with a former NSA analyst in 1980 and described him as red-haired. The FBI scoured NSA personnel files until it had a pool of red-haired male analysts. They were thus able to identify Pelton&#x27;s voice and began surveillance on him in October 1985. Despite bugging his car and his home, they were unable to find any incriminating evidence against Pelton.

Therefore, the FBI decided to confront Pelton directly, playing the tape of his conversation with the Soviet embassy. Eventually Pelton revealed that he had provided answers to questions from the Soviets in return for $35,000. Pelton was tried and convicted of espionage in 1986 and sentenced to three concurrent life sentences plus ten years. He was also fined $100.

Pelton was federal inmate number 22914-037, incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution, Allenwood, a medium-security facility in Pennsylvania. Because the federal government still had parole at the time, he had the opportunity for release. Pelton was released from prison on November 24, 2015.

==Death==
Pelton died in Frederick, Maryland, on September 6, 2022, at the age of 80.

<doc id="1253327" wikidata="Q1069404" url="?curid=1253327" title="Chemical-mechanical polishing">
<text>Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) (also called chemical mechanical planarization) is a process of smoothing surfaces with the combination of chemical and mechanical forces. It can be thought of as a of chemical etching and free abrasive polishing. It is used in the semiconductor industry to polish semiconductor wafers as part of the integrated circuit manufacturing process.

==Description==

The process uses an abrasive and corrosive chemical slurry (commonly a colloid) in conjunction with a polishing pad and retaining ring, typically of a greater diameter than the wafer. The pad and wafer are pressed together by a dynamic polishing head and held in place by a plastic retaining ring. The dynamic polishing head is rotated with different axes of rotation (i.e., not ). This removes material and tends to even out any irregular topography, making the wafer flat or planar. This may be necessary to set up the wafer for the formation of additional circuit elements. For example, CMP can bring the entire surface within the depth of field of a photolithography system, or selectively remove material based on its position. Typical depth-of-field requirements are down to Angstrom levels for the latest 22 nm technology.

==Working principles==

===Physical action===
Typical CMP tools, such as the ones seen on the right, consist of rotating an extremely flat plate which is covered by a pad. The wafer that is being polished is mounted upside-down in a carrier/spindle on a backing film. The retaining ring (Figure 1) keeps the wafer in the correct horizontal position. During the process of loading and unloading the wafer onto the tool, the wafer is held by vacuum by the carrier to prevent unwanted particles from building up on the wafer surface. A slurry introduction mechanism deposits the slurry on the pad, represented by the slurry supply in Figure 1. Both the plate and the carrier are then rotated and the carrier is kept oscillating; this can be better seen in the top view of Figure 2. A downward pressure/down force is applied to the carrier, pushing it against the pad; typically the down force is an average force, but local pressure is needed for the removal mechanisms. Down force depends on the contact area which, in turn, is dependent on the structures of both the wafer and the pad. Typically the pads have a roughness of 50 μm; contact is made by asperities (which typically are the high points on the wafer) and, as a result, the contact area is only a fraction of the wafer area. In CMP, the mechanical properties of the wafer itself must be considered too. If the wafer has a slightly bowed structure, the pressure will be greater on the edges than it would on the center, which causes non-uniform polishing. In order to compensate for the wafer bow, pressure can be applied to the wafer&#x27;s backside which, in turn, will equalize the centre-edge differences. The pads used in the CMP tool should be rigid in order to uniformly polish the wafer surface. However, these rigid pads must be kept in alignment with the wafer at all times. Therefore, real pads are often just stacks of soft and hard materials that conform to wafer topography to some extent. Generally, these pads are made from porous polymeric materials with a pore size between 30 and 50 μm, and because they are consumed in the process, they must be regularly reconditioned. In most cases the pads are very much proprietary, and are usually referred to by their trademark names rather than their chemical or other properties.

Before about 1990 CMP was viewed as too &quot;dirty&quot; to be included in high-precision fabrication processes, since abrasion tends to create particles and the abrasives themselves are not without impurities. Since that time, the integrated circuit industry has moved from aluminum to copper conductors. This required the development of an &quot;additive patterning&quot; process, which relies on the unique abilities of CMP to remove material in a planar and uniform fashion and to stop repeatably at the interface between copper and oxide insulating layers (see Copper interconnects for details). Adoption of this process has made CMP processing much more widespread. In addition to aluminum and copper, CMP processes have been developed for polishing tungsten, silicon dioxide, and (recently) carbon nanotubes.

==Limitations==
There are currently several limitations of CMP that appear during the polishing process requiring optimization of a new technology. In particular, an improvement in wafer metrology is required. In addition, it was discovered that the CMP process has several potential defects including stress cracking, delaminating at weak interfaces, and corrosive attacks from slurry chemicals. The oxide polishing process, which is the oldest and most used in today&#x27;s industry, has one problem: a lack of end points requires blind polishing, making it hard to determine when the desired amount of material has been removed or the desired degree of planarization has been obtained. If the oxide layer has not been sufficiently thinned and/or the desired degree of planarity has not been achieved during this process, then (theoretically) the wafer can be repolished, but in a practical sense this is unattractive in production and is to be avoided if at all possible. If the oxide thickness is too thin or too non-uniform, then the wafer must be reworked, an even less attractive process and one that is likely to fail. Obviously, this method is time-consuming and costly since technicians have to be more attentive while performing this process.

==Application==

Shallow trench isolation (STI), a process used to fabricate semiconductor devices, is a technique used to enhance the isolation between devices and active areas. Moreover, STI has a higher degree of planarity making it essential in photolithographic applications, depth of focus budget by decreasing minimum line width. To planarize shallow trenches, a common method should be used such as the combination of resist etching-back (REB) and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). This process comes in a sequence pattern as follows. First, the isolation trench pattern is transferred to the silicon wafer. Oxide is deposited on the wafer in the shape of trenches. A photo mask, composed of silicon nitride, is patterned on the top of this sacrificial oxide. A second layer is added to the wafer to create a planar surface. After that, the silicon is thermally oxidized, so the oxide grows in regions where there is no Si3N4 and the growth is between 0.5 and 1.0 μm thick. Since the oxidizing species such as water or oxygen are unable to diffuse through the mask, the nitride prevents the oxidation. Next, the etching process is used to etch the wafer and leave a small amount of oxide in the active areas. In the end, CMP is used to polish the SiO2 overburden with an oxide on the active area.

<text>The Royal Military Canal is a canal running for between Seabrook near Folkestone and Cliff End near Hastings, following the old cliff line bordering Romney Marsh, which was constructed as a defence against the possible invasion of England during the Napoleonic Wars.

==History==

===Origin and construction===
The canal was conceived by Lieutenant-Colonel John Brown of the Royal Staff Corps of field engineers in 1804, during anti-invasion preparations, as a defensible barrier to ensure that a French force could not use the Romney Marsh as a bridgehead. It had previously been assumed that the marsh could be inundated in the event of an invasion, but Brown argued that this would take ten days to implement and would cause massive disruption in the event of a false alarm. At a meeting on 26 September 1804, the Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, the Duke of York, both enthusiastically endorsed the scheme. John Rennie was appointed consultant engineer, and Pitt personally persuaded the local landowners to agree to the new canal.

Construction was started at Seabrook, near Hythe in Kent on 30 October 1804. By May 1805 only six miles of the canal had been completed; William Pitt intervened and the contractors and Rennie were dismissed. The work was resumed by the Quartermaster-General’s department with Lt-Col. Brown in command. Civilian navvies dug the canal itself, while soldiers built the ramparts. It was constructed in two sections: the longer section starts at Hythe and ends at Iden Lock in East Sussex; the second, smaller section, runs from the foot of Winchelsea Hill to Cliff End. The two sections are linked by the River Rother (Eastern) and River Brede. Artillery batteries were generally located every , where the canal was staggered to create a salient, allowing the guns to enfilade the next stretch of water. A military road was built on the inland side of the canal, and crossings consisted of moveable wooden bridges. Any troops stationed or moving along the military road would have been protected by the earthen bank of the parapet, which was piled up with excavated soil. The canal was completed in April 1809 at a total cost of £234,000; it was hoped that tolls for use of the waterway and road would help to defray the cost. In addition to these works, a number of Martello towers were built to protect the vulnerable sluices that controlled the water level in the canal, being towers numbers 22 to 27 and 30, three of which are still standing.

===Peacetime use===

Despite the fact that the canal never saw military action, it was used to try to control smuggling from Romney Marsh. Guard houses were constructed at each bridge along its length. This met with limited success because of corrupt guards. Although a barge service was established from Hythe to Rye, the canal was abandoned in 1877 and leased to the Lords of the Level of Romney Marsh.

===World War II===

During the early stages of World War II, during preparations for a threatened German invasion, the canal was manned by 31st Independent Brigade Group, who fortified each salient with a concrete pillbox and barbed wire entanglements; numerous pillboxes survive today. In the German invasion plan, codenamed Operation Sea Lion, the paratroopers of the 7th Flieger-Division were tasked with a parachute landing to secure crossing points across the Royal Military Canal on the first day of the invasion.

==The canal today==

A public path runs alongside the entire length of the canal, forming part of the longer Saxon Shore Way. Aside from being historically significant in its own right, the path passes by numerous WW II pillboxes and the unusual acoustic mirrors, the historic cinque port towns of Hythe, Winchelsea, and Rye, the 12th century St Rumwold&#x27;s church, and Lympne and Camber castles.

The canal is an important environmental site, and passes through several Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The Environment Agency is the navigation authority and uses the waterway to manage water levels on Romney Marsh and Walland Marsh. It is important for fish and other wildlife, including kingfishers, dragonflies, and marsh frogs.

<text>Wordragen is a Dutch hamlet, north of Ammerzoden in the Maasdriel municipality of Gelderland province.

It was first mentioned in the 13th century as Vurdragen. The etymology is unknown, however it contains woerd (&quot;terp&quot;, an artificial living mound). Wordragen is not a statistical entity, and the postal authorities have placed it under Ammerzoden. In 1840, it was home to 94 people. Nowadays it consists of about 40 houses.

<text>Ralph Chandler (23 August 1829 – 9 February 1889) was a rear admiral of the United States Navy. He saw action during the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War, and later served as commander of the Asiatic Squadron.

==Biography==
Chandler was born in Batavia, New York, the son of Daniel Chandler, a lawyer. He joined the Navy as midshipman on 17 September 1845, and was sent to the Naval Academy. After graduation he was assigned to the razee , flagship of the Pacific Squadron. He took part in Pacific-coast operations of the Mexican–American War, being in two engagements near Mazatlán.

Chandler served in the sloop from 1849 to 1850, and was promoted to Passed midshipman in 1851. After a tour of duty at the Naval Academy in 1852, he served in the sloop in the Mediterranean Squadron till 1855, in which year he became successively master and lieutenant.

Between 1855 and 1859 Chandler was engaged on the coast survey and the survey of the Paraná River, and was serving in the sloop at the outbreak of the Civil War, seeing action in her at the battle of Port Royal in November 1861. The next year he was assigned to the steam-sloop of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, in which he was present at the engagement with the Sewell&#x27;s Point batteries and the capture of Norfolk, Virginia.

On 16 July 1862, he was promoted to lieutenant-commander and commanded the screw steamer in the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. Transferred to the steam-gunboat of the North Atlantic Squadron, Chandler fought his ship at the bombardment and fall of Fort Fisher and the capture of Wilmington in early 1865, receiving promotion to commander on 25 July 1866.

For two years he commanded the steamer , and was on ordnance duty at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1868. The next year Chandler commanded the steamer . He was promoted to captain in 1874, and then to commodore in 1884, serving as commandant of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

On 6 October 1886, Chandler was commissioned as rear-admiral and was ordered to relieve Rear-Admiral John L. Davis in command of the Asiatic Squadron. He died in Hong Kong of apoplexy in February 1889, and is buried in Hong Kong Cemetery.

He was married to Cornelia Redfield, with whom he had five children, three girls and two boys.

<text>Heartbeats Accelerating is the sixth album by Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, released in 1990. It was their first album in eight years, after &quot;Love Over and Over&quot; in 1982, and received favourable reviews from many music critics.

Bill Dillon, Pierre Marchand, Joel Zifkin and Kate&#x27;s son Rufus Wainwright appear as guest musicians.

The title track was covered by Linda Ronstadt on her 1993 album &quot;Winter Light&quot;. It was given a New Age treatment in the vein of Enya and became a worldwide hit. Issued as a single, Ronstadt&#x27;s version of the song reached the Top 30 at the Adult Contemporary format in America, number 12 on Billboard&#x27;s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart in the United States, and peaked at number 17 on Canada&#x27;s RPM 100 Hit Tracks (the Canadian equivalent of the Billboard Hot 100). Aided by a romantic music video, it was also successful in several other countries, including Australia.

The song &quot;I Eat Dinner (When the Hunger&#x27;s Gone)&quot; was covered in 2004 by Kate&#x27;s son Rufus Wainwright along with Dido for the film &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot; and it appears on the soundtrack album.

Cœur de pirate covered the album&#x27;s title track on the soundtrack album for the fifth season of the television drama series &quot;Trauma&quot;.

Emmylou Harris included a cover of the song &quot;Love Is&quot;, with backing vocals by Kate and Anna, on her 1989 album &quot;Bluebird&quot; - 2 years before it was included in the McGarrigle&#x27;s own album.

<text>David Helvarg (born April 10, 1951) is an American journalist and environmental activist. He is the founder and president of the marine conservation lobbying organization Blue Frontier Campaign. He is also a participant in the Seaweed rebellion, an informal marine environmentalist activist movement. He is an author; his writing is often related to marine environmental activism, such as his second book, &quot;Blue Frontier&quot;. His first book, &quot;The War against the Greens&quot;, argues that violent organized resistance is being orchestrated against the environmental movement.

Helvarg began his career as a freelance journalist, became a war correspondent, then returned to news journalism. He writes about politics, AIDS, and sea life. He has reported from every continent and been widely published. His experience of military conflict, civil conflict and marine biology is the basis of his lobbying.

==Early life==
Helvarg was born April 10, 1951, in New York City, the son of refugees; his mother left Nazi Germany and his father escaped civil war in Ukraine. He attended Boston University and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from Goddard College in Vermont, in 1974.

==Works==

===Journalism===
While still a student, Helvarg traveled to Northern Ireland in 1973. The civil warfare known as &quot;The Troubles&quot; was at a height, and Helvarg submitted reports on the conflict to the Liberation News Service. Helvarg focused on the role of women in the conflict, and highlighted allegations that agents of the British government had participated in sectarian murders. After graduating from college, he moved to San Diego to work as a freelance journalist. He published &quot;Ireland Diary; A Day in the Life&quot; in the underground publication &quot;San Diego Door&quot;, and wrote for the weekly newspaper &quot;San Diego Newsline&quot;.

From 1979 to 1983, Helvarg covered the U.S. role in Central American conflicts, initially as a radio reporter for The Associated Press and Pacifica Radio in Nicaragua and El Salvador. His exclusive reports included combat coverage of the first town to fall to Sandinista rebels, the first delivery of U.S. gunships to El Salvador, the first visit to Contra camps in Honduras, and the last interview with Sister Ita Ford before her murder by the Salvadoran military. He was arrested by the Salvadoran army and deported from El Salvador in 1983 while reporting on a massacre of civilians.

After returning to California, he qualified as a private investigator, and resumed freelance writing. He wrote reports on underwater technology, articles about John Hoagland after conducting the photographer&#x27;s last interview, and an interview with Jonas Salk. Helvarg became increasingly involved in television production, although he continued his freelance career. Throughout the late 1980s, his television topics were dominated by AIDS education, particularly for the Hispanic community.

In the early 1990s, he began to research the conflict between the US free-market environmentalist group Wise Use and the green movement, which was eventually published as &quot;The War against the Greens&quot; in 1994. The Wise Use movement alleged that the US environmentalist group Sierra Club commissioned Helvarg to write the book as an anti-Wise Use tirade and that his sponsors also sponsored a road show to tie Wise Use to an alleged far-right terrorist network. The same article described him as &quot;a private investigator&quot; without mentioning his role as a journalist.

A visit to Antarctica in 1999 became material for several articles and books, and a daily log was published in &quot;Slate&quot;, the online news magazine. His professional exposure to green activism and his ocean sports activities intersected in marine conservation, which became his focus. While researching his second book &quot;Blue Frontier—Saving America&#x27;s Living Seas&quot; (2001), Helvarg concluded that marine conservation needed its own focal point for activism in the United States, so he moved to Washington, D.C., and founded a lobbying organization: the Blue Frontier Campaign. He also became a member of the board of Reef Relief, a more specific marine conservation advocacy group, about which he had made a television documentary in 1994.

Helvarg attracted attention in early 2005 for a newspaper article in which he addressed comments made by conservative Christians (particularly James Dobson of the &quot;Focus on the Family&quot;) regarding perceived homosexual tendencies of SpongeBob SquarePants due to an explanation of the sexual biology of ocean life (&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; January 26, 2005). In response to suggestions by Dobson and others that the &quot;We Are Family Foundation&quot; was exploiting popular animated characters, including SpongeBob, to promote the acceptance of homosexuality among young people, Helvarg described the &quot;immorality&quot; in the oceans. 

=== Books ===

==== The Golden Shore - California&#x27;s Love Affair with the Sea ====
The Golden Shore &quot;The Golden Shore&quot; (in imprint of St. Martin&#x27;s) 2013. &quot;Boy, I loved this book. David Helvarg captures, in a really readable way, the quirky and head-over-heels love we have for our seas.&quot; - Ted Danson. 

&quot;Having lived in California for forty-four years, I was surprised by how much I learned from David Helvarg&#x27;s book The Golden Shore. It blew my mind. If you have the same love affair for the beautiful California coast and ocean as I do, this marvelous and compelling book is a must-read.&quot; - Jean-Michel Cousteau.

====Saved by the Sea -- A Love Story with Fish====
&quot;Saved by the Sea&quot;(an imprint of St. Martin&#x27;s) 2010. Ocean Explorer Sylvia Earle says, &quot;This book has the power to change the way you think about the world, about yourself, and the future of humankind.&quot; Helvarg writes what he knows about the changes in his life and our Ocean world over the last half century.

====&quot;Rescue Warriors - The U.S. Coast Guard, America&#x27;s Forgotten Heroes&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s 2009)====
Robert Kennedy Jr. says, &quot;David Helvarg&#x27;s terrific new book takes you to the cutting edge of adventure as he rides along with the men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard. This in-depth and lively look at the history and changing missions of America&#x27;s &#x27;Rescue Warriors&#x27; should be considered a must-read for anyone who loves the water or cares about the safety, security, and stewardship of our nation from sea to shining sea.&quot; 
Bill McKibben writes, &quot;They say that &#x27;I&#x27;m from the government and I&#x27;m here to help&#x27; is the ultimate oxymoron. But as this vivid book makes powerfully clear, in the case of the Coast Guard it&#x27;s the simple truth. Stow this volume next to the chart case.&quot;

====&quot;50 Ways To Save the Ocean&quot; (Inner Ocean, 2006)====
Sylvia Earle writes, &quot;Combining wisdom and humor, scientific accuracy and artistic genius, Helvarg and Toomey show why the ocean matters to us all...Everyone, from toddler to tycoon, can find inspiration for action in this must-have guide to ocean care.&quot;
&quot;This is a great book - it makes saving the oceans fun and doable (which it is, by the way)&quot; adds actor Ted Danson
&quot;This book is an important guide for the public to saving our oceans.&quot; - Leon Panetta, former chair - Pew Oceans commission &amp; co-chair of the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative, former Director of the CIA, current United States Secretary of Defense.

====&quot;The War against the Greens&quot;====
Helvarg&#x27;s book &quot;The War against the Greens&quot; (1994) describes organized opposition to the environmental movement in the United States. He investigated the Wise Use movement, which he characterizes as a network of anti-environmentalist groups. Wise Use aims to facilitate extensive use of natural resources and to privatize the National Park Service. The first edition explored the origins of the organization in 1988 and its covert support by the administration of U.S. President George H. W. Bush. Helvarg identified its funding and the multinational corporations and other powerful figures with which it was associated. He catalogued the use of violence that he believed to be organized by the movement against environmental activists, and the ineffective response of law-enforcement agencies. A revised edition published in 2004 extended this to cover the early years of President George W. Bush&#x27;s administration.

&quot;Wisconsin Stewardship Network News&quot; described it as a book that &quot;provides a fascinating and frightening insight into the violent fringe of the anti-conservation Wise Use movement [… and recommends it] in its entirety to readers who want a detailed examination of the origins, development and violent tendencies of Wise Use.&quot; The opposing view was put by Jesse Walker who, reviewing the book for &quot;American Enterprise&quot;, wrote that it &quot;offers environmentalists a conspiracy theory to account for the populist backlash against their movement&quot;. Helvarg had accused Wise Use of astroturfing; Walker described his book as &quot;a weapon in a propaganda war&quot;.

&quot;War against the Greens&quot; is widely cited by activists inside the environmental movement (for example Community Rights Counsel and Land Tenure Center ) and gave rise to numerous rebuttals from Wise Use and its supporters (including Ron Arnold).

====&quot;Blue Frontier—Dispatches from America&#x27;s Ocean Wilderness&quot;====
Helvarg&#x27;s second book, &quot;Blue Frontier— Dispatches from America&#x27;s Ocean Wilderness&quot; (2001, revised 2006), was named on the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; &quot;Best Books of 2001&quot; republished in 2006. In it Helvarg explores the effects of human activity in general, and of commerce and policy in particular, on marine life. He postulates a trend towards destruction, and suggests that it is possible to reverse this. He then describes some of the people and groups that are working to preserve or enhance the marine environment.

This book prompted Senator John Kerry to observe that &quot;David Helvarg underscores the full measure of the challenges before us: If we hope to explore the Blue Frontier, we must travel cautiously, repairing the damage we have done, understanding before we exploit, and always preserving the natural systems that have created it.&quot; It was also one of the catalysts for the establishment of the Blue Frontier Campaign and has become a definitive text for US marine conservation (characterized as &#x27;the Seaweed rebellion&#x27;).

====&quot;The Ocean and Coastal Conservation Guide&quot;====
Helvarg is the editor of Blue Frontier Campaign&#x27;s first major publication: &quot;The Ocean and Coastal Conservation Guide&quot; (2005), a directory for those interested in the protection and restoration of United States coastal lands and waters. Blue Frontier Campaign plans to publish a new edition of the guide every two years.

This reference book lists over 2,000 organizations involved in the conservation of the oceans and coastal areas that border the United States. Each entry includes contact information and a brief description of that organization&#x27;s activities. The directory is divided into four listings: a geographical listings of groups; relevant government agencies; academic marine programs; and marine and coastal parks, and protected areas.

====&quot;Feeling the Heat&quot;====
Helvarg contributed two chapters to &quot;Feeling the Heat—Reports from the Frontlines of Climate Change&quot; (2004): Chapter Eight &#x27;Australia, Florida and Fiji: Reefs At Risk&#x27; and Chapter 10 &#x27;Antarctica: The Ice is Moving&#x27; are about threatened ecosystems.

The book is a development of a suite of articles that appeared in the October/November 2000 edition of &quot;E/The Environmental Magazine&quot;. The publishers &quot;aimed to move beyond the scientific debate […] to document […] the evidence for a changing climate&quot;. Each chapter is a first person account of places threatened by global warming. According to Helvarg, warming waters are killing the world&#x27;s coral and threatening the extinction of Australia&#x27;s Great Barrier Reef and the reefs around the Florida Keys, while the rising waters threaten to engulf the entire ocean nation of Fiji. In Antarctica he observed scientists measuring the krill population and concludes that the reduction that they found is a consequence of increased water temperatures.

===Broadcasting===
Helvarg has produced more than 40 television documentaries broadcast by PBS, The Discovery Channel, and others. His 1986 documentary &quot;Sex Inc.&quot; was the highest rating show broadcast on the San Francisco PBS station KQED. Other documentaries focused on the military, politics, health and environmental topics. He is a commentator for the National Public Radio station Public Radio International&#x27;s program &quot;Marketplace&quot;.

His first documentaries drew upon his experiences as a war correspondent in Northern Ireland and Central America. When he moved to San Francisco he was commissioned to produce programs about AIDS awareness for the Hispanic community and these led to other documentaries about Hispanic health. In 1989 Globe TV commissioned a program about Greenpeace to coincide with the launch of the new &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; vessel. This brought Helvarg into contact with green activists, with whose cause he found he sympathized. He would return to green themes in 1991 and 1992 but in the meantime he continued to make series about health, and topical news. From 1992 onwards his energies were focussed on environmental programming with some health commissions.

As of 2005 he continues to plan a series of documentaries about ocean stewardship to support the work of the Blue Frontier Campaign.

===Blue Frontier Campaign===

In 2003 Helvarg founded the marine conservation activist organization Blue Frontier Campaign, of which he became the president. Originally entitled the &quot;Ocean Awareness Project&quot;, the Campaign has established a nationwide network of grassroots lobbyists. It is campaigning for an American Oceans Act to protect what the members call &quot;our public seas&quot; and is working to improve local, state, federal and global policies on marine conservation. Helvarg writes articles and books on its behalf. He edited the &quot;2005–2006 Ocean and Coastal Conservation Guide&quot; and (with Philippe Cousteau and &#x27;Sherman&#x27;s Lagoon&#x27; cartoonist Jim Toomey, the book, &#x27;50 Ways to Save the Ocean&#x27; and has organized several conferences: in Washington, D.C., in July 2004 and March 2009 and at the National Aquarium in Baltimore in April 2005 and San Francisco in 2005. These conferences brought together activists, academics, officials, and politicians in a series of seminars. The Campaign is based in Washington, D.C., and the San Francisco Bay Area where Helvarg lives.

==Awards==
Helvarg won his first national award in 1988 when he won an Emmy for community service in recognition of his work on AIDS Lifeline, a networked television AIDS awareness campaign. His subsequent awards include two National Association for Interpretation awards for Interpretive Communications (in 1989 and 1991), the Nike Earthwrite Award (1997), a National Health Information Award (1999) and a CINE Golden Eagle Award (1999). In 2005, &quot;Coastal Living&quot; magazine gave him their Leadership Award. In 2007 he won the Herman Melville Award.

<doc id="1253375" wikidata="Q4518649" url="?curid=1253375" title="Beluga caviar">
<text>Beluga caviar is caviar consisting of the roe (or eggs) of the beluga sturgeon &quot;Huso huso&quot;. The fish is found primarily in the Caspian Sea, which is bordered by Iran, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan. It can also be found in the Black Sea basin and occasionally in the Adriatic Sea. Beluga caviar is the most expensive type of caviar, with market prices ranging from .

==Harvesting==
The beluga sturgeon is currently considered to be critically endangered, causing the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to ban in 2005 the importation of beluga caviar which originated in the Caspian Sea and Black Sea basin. In 2006, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) suspended all trade made with the traditional caviar-producing regions of the Caspian and Black Seas (Beluga, Ossetra and Sevruga), (Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, China, Iran, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine) due to the producing countries&#x27; failure to apply international regulations and recommendations. Caviar from Iran is exempted from the ban. Iran is considered by CITES to practise effective conservation and policing of its fisheries. In January 2007, this ban was partly lifted, allowing the sale of 96 tons of caviar, 15 percent below the official 2005 level. CITES maintained the 2007 quotas for 2008, drawing criticism for doing little to protect the declining sturgeon population.

The beluga sturgeon can take up to 20 years to reach maturity. The fish harvested for caviar are often nearly . The eggs themselves are the largest of the commonly used roes, and range in color from dark gray (almost black) to light gray, with the lighter colors coming from older fish, and being the most valued.

The most expensive caviar is &quot;Almas&quot;, a golden caviar produced by very rare female albino sturgeon between 60 and 100 years old, which swims in the southern Caspian Sea near Iran where apparently less pollution exists. Very few of the albino variety are left in the wild since the lack of melanin is a genetic disorder that only affects a few members of the species. A kilogram (2 lb 3 oz) is regularly sold for £20,000. Any additions by producers diminish the value of the roe, and the caviar usually reaches the market without any additions or processing whatsoever.

==Legality==
In 2005, the United States made it illegal to import beluga caviar and beluga sturgeon into the country, because of the animal&#x27;s endangered status. However, caviar from beluga hybrid species are still for sale in the country. Many other countries allow for the import and export of beluga sturgeon caviar, as the fish has started making a comeback in recent years. Widespread farming and conservation efforts have allowed wild populations in the Caspian to redevelop.

In July 2016, Sturgeon Aquafarms in Bascom, FL became the first and only facility in the world to obtain a permit exemption for the trade in beluga sturgeon and its caviar in the USA. Since 2017, Sturgeon Aquafarms has assisted in beluga sturgeon repopulation efforts across the world by providing over ~160,000 fertilized beluga eggs to the Caspian Sea region.

==Service==
As with most caviars, beluga is usually handled with a caviar spoon made of mother of pearl, bone, or other nonmetallic material, as metal utensils are said to impart an unwelcome metallic taste to the delicate roe. Beluga caviar is usually served by itself on toast, unlike other less expensive caviars that can be served in a variety of ways, including hollowed and cooked new potatoes, on blini, or garnished with sour cream, &quot;crème fraîche&quot;, chopped onions, or minced hard boiled egg whites. These items can, however, be served with beluga as palate cleansers.

<text>Laury Jane McGarrigle (April 26, 1941 – January 24, 2025) was a Canadian musician and music publisher, known mainly for her work with her younger sisters, singers Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle. She was the co-author of a book about the three sisters&#x27; childhood and musical experiences.

== Early and personal life ==
McGarrigle was born and grew up in Montreal, Quebec, with her sisters Kate and Anna. She died on January 24, 2025, at the age of 83.

==Career==
When McGarrigle&#x27;s younger sisters formed a singer-songwriter duo, Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, Jane wrote and performed several songs with them. She produced their album &quot;Love Over and Over&quot;.

The song &quot;Love Is&quot;, which she co-wrote, has been recorded by Nana Mouskouri, Emmylou Harris, and Renato Russo (who also recorded the co-written &quot;Man Is an Island&quot;). She served as her sisters&#x27; music manager for a time, and also managed producers Pierre Marchand (Sarah McLachlan) and Robbi Finkel (Cirque du Soleil) and the group Three O&#x27;Clock Train. 

McGarrigle co-composed, with her sisters, the scores to the Canadian film &quot;Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Return of Tommy Tricker&quot;. 

She appeared in the 1999 film &quot;The McGarrigle Hour&quot;, a collection of concert footage.

McGarrigle was a member of the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN) and served on its board of directors from 1990 to 2000. She was also on the board of the Songwriters Association of Canada. In 2013, she was part of a SOCAN representative group for a streamed panel, &quot;Can the Music Industry be Saved?&quot;

With her sister Anna, she co-authored &quot;Mountain City Girls&quot;, a family memoir published in 2015 by Random House Canada. The book contains stories about the childhood and musical careers of the three sisters.

<doc id="1253386" wikidata="Q2911432" url="?curid=1253386" title="Christopher John Boyce">
<text>Christopher John Boyce (born February 16, 1953) is a former American defense industry employee who alleged CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal in Australia. After this, he attempted to sell United States spy satellite secrets to the Soviet Union in Mexico City in the 1970s.

==Early life==
Boyce is the son of Charles Eugene Boyce, former Director of Security for McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Corporation, and Noreen, née Hollenbeck. Along with his three brothers and five sisters, Boyce was reared in Southern California, in the affluent community of Rancho Palos Verdes, a suburb southwest of Los Angeles.

In 1974, Boyce was hired at TRW, an aerospace firm in Redondo Beach, California.

==Espionage==
Within months, Boyce was promoted to a highly sensitive position in TRW&#x27;s &quot;Black Vault&quot; (classified communications center) with a top secret security clearance, where he worked with National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) transmissions.

Boyce said that he began getting misrouted cables from the CIA discussing the agency&#x27;s desire to depose the government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in Australia. Boyce said the CIA wanted Whitlam removed from office because he wanted to close US military bases in Australia, including the vital Pine Gap secure communications facility, and withdraw Australian troops from Vietnam. For these reasons, John Pilger, Australian journalist and author, has written that US government pressure was a major factor in the dismissal of Whitlam as Prime Minister by the Governor General, Sir John Kerr, who, according to Boyce, was referred to as &quot;our man Kerr&quot; by CIA officers. Through the cable traffic, Boyce saw that the CIA was involving itself in such a manner not just with Australia but with other democratic, industrialized allies as well. Boyce considered going to the press, but believed the media&#x27;s earlier disclosure of CIA involvement in the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état had not changed anything for the better.

Instead, he gathered a quantity of classified documents concerning secure US communications ciphers and spy satellite development and had his friend Andrew Daulton Lee, a cocaine and heroin dealer since his high school days (hence his nickname, &quot;The Snowman&quot;), deliver them to Soviet embassy officials in Mexico City, returning with large sums of cash for Boyce (nicknamed &quot;The Falcon&quot; because of his longtime interest in falconry) and himself. According to a book that Boyce and his wife co-authored, the information was not valuable to the Soviet Union.

==Exposure==
Boyce, then 23, was exposed after Lee was arrested by Mexican police in front of the Soviet embassy on January 6, 1977. His arrest was &quot;almost by accident&quot;: Lee was arrested for littering. During his harsh interrogation, Lee, who had a top secret microfilm in his possession when arrested, confessed to being a Soviet spy and implicated Boyce. Boyce was arrested ten days later on January 16, when the FBI found him hiding out at the shack he was renting near Riverside, California. He was convicted on eight counts of espionage on April 28 1977, and sentenced by federal district judge Robert Kelleher on September 12 to forty years in prison, initially at Terminal Island, then the Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego. On July 10, 1979, he was transferred to the federal penitentiary in Lompoc, California.

==Escape==
On January 21, 1980, Boyce escaped from Lompoc. Boyce managed to evade the authorities and ended up in northern Idaho, where he found refuge in a cabin outside Bonners Ferry. While a fugitive, Boyce carried out 17 bank robberies in Idaho and Washington, hoping to pay for passage to the Soviet Union, and adopted the alias of &quot;Anthony Edward Lester&quot;. According to Boyce, he studied aviation, not to flee to the Soviet Union as some suspected, but to rescue Daulton Lee from Lompoc. On August 21, 1981, Boyce was arrested by U.S. Marshals while eating in his car outside &quot;The Pit Stop&quot;, a drive-in restaurant in Port Angeles, Washington. Authorities had received a tip about Boyce&#x27;s whereabouts from his former bank robbery confederates.

==Return to prison==
On January 26, 1982, in Los Angeles, Boyce was convicted of escape from federal prison in a nonjury trial before U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence Lydick, a proceeding which lasted three minutes. The following week he was flown to Idaho and was arraigned in Boise, where he pleaded not guilty to charges related to multiple bank robberies.

That spring, Boyce appeared before Judge Harold Ryan in U.S. District Court in Boise and was sentenced to three years for his escape and 25 years for bank robbery, conspiracy, and breaking federal gun laws. Given an aggregate total sentence of 68 years, he was transferred to United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth in northeastern Kansas.

Later that year, Boyce gave a television interview to Ray Martin for Australia&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; about the dismissal of Whitlam. After this he was assaulted by fellow inmates, an attack he believed was orchestrated by prison guards. After the attack, he was transferred to USP Marion in southern Illinois, where he was held in isolation.

In April 1985, Boyce gave testimony on how to prevent insider spy threats to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations as part of its Government Personnel Security Program.

With support from senators, he was transferred out of solitary confinement in 1988 to the Minnesota Correctional Facility – Oak Park Heights near the Twin Cities. At this prison in January 1993, Boyce was almost killed by Earl Steven Karr, a mentally ill fellow inmate and convicted pipe bomber. Karr had planned to blind Boyce with a mace-like concoction after luring him into his cell, then electrocute him using a homemade electric shock prod fashioned out of a rod and newspaper. The plot failed when Karr slipped on a puddle of mace, allowing Boyce time to escape. 

Boyce was transferred in 1998 to ADX Florence, the supermax facility in Colorado west of Pueblo; he believed this was punishment for a newspaper article he had written. In 2000, he was transferred to FCI Sheridan in Oregon, northwest of Salem.

==Release and subsequent life==
Boyce was released from prison on parole on September 16, 2002, after serving a little more than 25 years, accounting for his time spent outside from the escape. Shortly thereafter he married Kathleen Mills, whom he had met when she was working as a paralegal spearheading efforts to obtain parole for Lee. After her success with Lee, she turned her attention to securing parole for Boyce as well, and the two developed a personal relationship. Boyce is on good terms with his father and eight siblings, and was with his mother as well until her death in 2017.

In 2013, Boyce published a book titled &quot;American Sons: The Untold Story of the Falcon and the Snowman&quot;, which mainly discusses his time in prison and relationship with his wife, Kathleen, and writer Vince Font. At that time, he was living a relatively quiet life where he has resumed his participation in falconry as a frequent pastime. When interviewed at the time his book was released, Boyce expressed support for the actions of Edward Snowden in exposing information about the United States government&#x27;s surveillance programs.

==In popular culture==
The story of their case was told in Robert Lindsey&#x27;s best-selling 1979 book &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot;. This book was turned into a film of the same title in 1985 by director John Schlesinger starring Timothy Hutton as Boyce and Sean Penn as Lee.

Lindsey&#x27;s initial book was followed by &quot;The Flight of the Falcon: The True Story of the Escape and Manhunt for America&#x27;s Most Wanted Spy&quot; (1983), an account of Boyce&#x27;s escape from prison and subsequent bank robbing spree.

<doc id="1253388" wikidata="Q245126" url="?curid=1253388" title="Siófok">
<text>Siófok (; ; ) is a town in Somogy County, Hungary on the southern bank of Lake Balaton. It is the second largest municipality in Somogy County and the seat of Siófok District. It covers an area of about between Lake Balaton, the &quot;Mezőföld&quot; and the &quot;Outer Somogy-Hills&quot;. Lying at the firth of the Sió Channel, it serves as the most important logistic station for goods between Lake Balaton and the River Danube.

The town is Hungary&#x27;s second most popular holiday destination (after Budapest) due to its coast, over 1,000 hotels, and plenty of bars, restaurants and nightclubs. Siófok is one of the richest municipalities of Hungary due to tourism. Hungarians often call the town &quot;the capital of Lake Balaton&quot;, as it is the largest town on its shores and acts as the financial, cultural, media, commercial and tourist hub of the northern part of Somogy County and the southern shore of Lake Balaton.

==Etymology==
&quot;Fuk&quot; was first mentioned as a village name in 1137 among the taxpayer communities. In the Tabula Hungariae (published in 1528) it appears as &quot;Fok&quot;. The word composition &quot;Siófok&quot; has been in use since 1790.

==History==
===Ancient times===
The area of today&#x27;s Siófok was already inhabited during the Roman Empire. The Roman conquest came here in the 1st century AD. The town lay on the route leading from &quot;Sopianae&quot; (today Pécs) through &quot;Tricciana&quot; (today Ságvár) to &quot;Arrabona&quot; (today Győr). According to recordings of Sextus Aurelius Victor from the 3rd to 4th century AD, Emperor Galerius built a sluice in 292 AD to drain the &quot;Lacus Pelso&quot; (the Latin name of Lake Balaton) in the area of Siófok and cleared forests.

===Middle Ages===
After the Hungarian Conquest, the settlement is mentioned in the Tihany Abbey&#x27;s founding letter from 1055 as the following: &quot;Rivulus namque, qui dicitur Fuk fluens&quot; which means that a small brook, also called &quot;Fuk&quot; (today Sió) comes from the Lake Balaton. It also states that people had a passage through an older bridge and a ford as well.

After the Second Mongol invasion of Hungary, &quot;Fok&quot; was resettled.

In 1552, the Ottoman Empire took &quot;Fok&quot; and his surroundings. Siófok became a military outpost of the Ottomans who also built a fortress there. The &quot;Siófok Castle&quot; stood on the &quot;Granarium Hill&quot; near the place where the hospital is located today. Two years after the Siege of Buda (1686) the region was liberated from the Ottoman occupation. &quot;Fok&quot; became the property of the &quot;Chapter of Veszprém&quot;, who settled people there, and in 1693 built a wooden church for them.

===Habsburg times===
At the time of Rákóczi&#x27;s War of Independence, the famous &quot;Sió Defence Line&quot; of János Bottyán ended at the &quot;Fortress of Siófok&quot;. 1705 Francis II Rákóczi, Prince of Transylvania, donated a seal to the village which serves today as the coat of arms of Siófok.

The Baroque parish church was built in honor of the Immaculate Conception in 1736.

Major industrial progress began in the settlement during the 19th century. From 1810 the &quot;Transylvania-Adria Mail Coach Route&quot; already ran through Siófok. The first independent post office operated there since 1867.

Water regulation began in 1810 in the village. Then, based on the idea of &quot;József Beszédes&quot;, a water engineer, the bed of the Sió was cleaned, mills were re-operated, the water level of Lake Balaton dropped by one meter, recovering 51,000 acres of land from the water of Lake Balaton, and a further 6,000 acres of free land was created on the area of the Sió.

The establishment of the &quot;Balatoni Gőzhajózási Részvénytársaság&quot; (&quot;Balaton Steam Shipping Company&quot;) in 1846 brought a significant change in the life of the settlement. Lajos Kossuth, who personally wrote the charter of the business association, and István Széchenyi as the president of the company played a huge role in it. In the same year, on September 21, the first steamboat on the Lake Balaton, &quot;Kisfaludy&quot; was released into the water.

In 1861 the railway between Buda and Nagykanizsa was officially opened. The train station was completed in 1863 (although the train stopped there since 1861), and a year later, the first port protected by pier was built. In the same year, a new sluice on the Sió was opened, to control the water level of Lake Balaton. The wooden sluice was replaced by an iron one in 1893. The settlement was awarded the rank of market town in 1865, which meant a permit for holding national fair. At that time, Siófok was still small with 200 houses and 1,500 residents.

In Siófok, or as many people called it at that time, &quot;Zsidófok&quot; (&quot;zsidó&quot; meaning &quot;Jew&quot; in Hungarian, according to sources, it was more a descriptive than a pejorative expression) once lived a large number of Jewish community. At the beginning of the 1860s, their number was 347, with 70 merchants living here, who played a major role in making the city an attractive resort in Europe.

In 1866, the first advertisement of the settlement was published in the &quot;Zala-Somogy Bulletin&quot; entitled &quot;Balatontavi Fürdő Siófok&quot;. Ignác Vég&#x27; tenant made a 12-year bathing lease contract with the &quot;Chapter of Veszprém&quot;, which has been extended for another 12 years. Built in 1878, the &quot;Magyar Tenger&quot; (&quot;Hungarian Sea&quot;) bathhouse, created according to the plans of the &quot;Neuschlass&quot; construction company, in Swiss style, with an ornate façade, a hundred-person lounge, large windows that looked at the water, a double-deck viewing room, eighty bath cabins.

The Chapter of Veszprém began to parcel plots in 1885 and the construction of today&#x27;s bathing area began. It is an interesting attraction of the Balaton landscape that the majority of the first villa owners were painters: Mór Than, Pál Vágó, Tivadar Feledi-Flesch (Mihály Zichy&#x27;s son-in-law) and Artúr Tölgyessy&#x27;s villa were in Siófok at this time.

In 1888 Gábor Baross granted state aid for the reorganization of the &quot;Balatoni Gőzhajózási Részvénytársaság&quot; (&quot;Balaton Steam Shipping Company&quot;). In 1889, the new passenger ship, the &quot;Kelén&quot;, was launched, and in 1891 &quot;Helka&quot; and the new &quot;Kelén&quot; were completed.

In April 1891, the &quot;Siófok Balatonfürdő Rt&quot; (&quot;Siófok Balaton Bath Corporation&quot;) was founded which redeemed the bath rights from the &quot;Chapter of Veszprém&quot; and bought a 60-acre area to build houses and parks. From 1884 to 1905, the leader of the company was Henrik Glatz, founder of &quot;Franklin Irodalmi és Nyomdai Rt&quot;. Major hotels opened: &quot;Sió&quot;, &quot;Hullám&quot;, and later the &quot;Central Hotel&quot;.

In 1900, the &quot;Balatoni Halászati Részvénytársaság&quot; (&quot;Balaton Fishing Company&quot;) started its operations. In the same year, the horse racing venue was built with a stand for 1,500 people. The town was also the destination of the most visited swimming and tennis competitions at Lake Balaton.

Because of its busy lifestyle, Siófok became a popular place of residence for several Hungarian artists and actors (e.g. Frigyes Karinthy, Gyula Krúdy, Árpád Latabár, Gyula Kabos).

In 1904 the new railway station building was completed. On October 23, 1906, the railway connection with Kaposvár was established through the &quot;Mocsolád-Tab-Siófok railway&quot;.

=== During the world wars ===
In August 1919, Siófok stood at the center of national politics for a short time, after Miklós Horthy, preparing for the suppression of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, moved to the area of Siófok and established his headquarters there.

At the end of World War II, the settlement was heavily damaged because the frontline got stuck for two months there.

During World War II, nearly 500 Jews were deported in 1944, of whom only 72 returned.

===Soviet era===
In 1947, within the framework of the construction works of the Sió Channel, the new sluice was completed, which made it possible for ships to move through. From 1950, the settlement belongs to Somogy County and in the same year it became a district seat.

On December 31, 1968, Siófok became a city. Before that, the 400-bed hospital was built, and then the cultural center and town library. In 1971, the M7 motorway from the direction of Budapest reached the settlement. Later, Siófok became the most famous corporate holiday destination.

===After 1989===
After 1990, a local newspaper and open-air local television began to operate in the city. The first high-speed telegraphy World Championship was hosted in Siófok in 1995.

==Geography==

In Siófok, the canal Sió flows out of the lake.

==Climate==
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen climate classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfa&quot; (humid subtropical climate).
==Economy==
Although Siófok is known for its tourism and service sector there are some companies working in production. Several smaller firms and farmers are in the agricultural industry, especially in fruit production. The town&#x27;s famous products are the &quot;Sió&quot; fruit juices in several tastes. Their producer is the &quot;Sió-Eckes&quot; company (part of the German &quot;Eckes&quot;).

The Hungarian stationery producer &quot;SOMOGY REHAB&quot;, the Hungarian aluminium tent manufacturer &quot;Alutent&quot;, the Hungarian water supply infrastructure manufacturer &quot;Kristály&quot;, the Hungarian ready-mixed concrete producer &quot;TBG Interbeton&quot; (part of the Mexican Cemex) and the Hungarian plastic manufacturer &quot;Kaona&quot; are all based in the town.

The Norwegian cable producer Kongsberg Automotive and the Hungarian gas transport infrastructure manufacturer &quot;OV Industries&quot; have production facilities here.

Most of the companies can be found in the town&#x27;s industrial park, &quot;Adria Ipari Park&quot;.

Siófok is home to the headquarter of &quot;Bahart&quot; (&quot;Balatoni Hajózási Zrt&quot;, &quot;&quot;) which is the owner and operator of 11 sailing ports around Lake Balaton (Balatonföldvár, Balatonszemes, Balatonlelle, Balatonboglár, Fonyód, Szigliget, Badacsony, Balatonfüred, Csopak, Alsóörs and Siófok), as well as provider of scheduled cruise ship voyages, ferries, water taxis and organizer of regattas.

===Top companies===

===Services and public transportation===

<text>Miller is a lunar impact crater that lies amidst the rugged terrain in the southern part of the Moon. It is attached to the northern rim of the smaller crater Nasireddin, and the outer of the latter reaches almost to the central peak formation at the midpoint of Miller&#x27;s interior floor. Together with Huggins to the southwest and Orontius to the south-southwest, this foursome forms a chain of craters forming an arc that curves towards the north. The northwest rim of Miller in turn is attached to the satellite crater Miller C, forming the end of the arc. To the southeast lies Stöfler. The crater is named after British chemist William Allen Miller.

The rim of Miller is nearly circular with a system of s along the inner wall. The interior floor is nearly level with the aforementioned central peak formation located at the midpoint. The crater Stöfler H is attached to the exterior southeast rim and intrudes slightly into the interior. There are a few tiny craterlets lying within the crater, including one along the rampart of Nasiredden.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Miller.

<text>The Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard (&quot;anti-aircraft-gun tank &#x27;Cheetah, better known as the [[Flakpanzer]] Gepard) is an all-weather-capable West German self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG) based on the hull of the Leopard 1. It was developed in the 1960s, fielded in the 1970s, and has been upgraded several times with the latest electronics. It has been a cornerstone of the air defence of the German Army (Bundeswehr) and a number of other NATO countries.

In Germany, the Gepard was phased out in late 2010 and replaced by the Wiesel 2 Ozelot &quot;Leichtes Flugabwehrsystem&quot; (LeFlaSys) with four FIM-92 Stinger or LFK NG missile launchers. A variant with the MANTIS gun system and LFK NG missiles, based on the GTK Boxer, was also considered.

The Gepard has been widely used in combat in the Russo-Ukrainian War, mostly to shoot down drones.

==Developmental history==

The Gepard was developed during the 1960s as a replacement for the M42 Duster. Two projects were investigated. These were the ‘Matador’ (designed by Rheinmetall, AEG, Siemens, and Krauss-Maffei) and the ‘5PFZ-A’ (designed by Oerlikon, Contraves, Siemens-Albis, Hollandse Signaalapparaten and Kraus-Maffei/Porsche). In 1969, construction began of four A prototypes testing both 30 and 35 mm guns. In June 1970, it was decided to use the 35 mm type. In 1971, twelve second phase B prototypes were ordered. In 1971 the Dutch army ordered a CA preseries of five vehicles based on a parallel development that had used a West German 0-series Leopard 1 vehicle made available by the West German government in March 1970 as the C-prototype.
The Germans made a small preseries of both the B1 and B2R. In February 1973, the political decision was made to produce the type. In September 1973 the contract was signed with Krauss-Maffei for 432 B2 turrets and 420 hulls with a total value of DM 1,200,000,000. Each vehicle would be about three times the price of a normal Leopard 1. The first was delivered in December 1976. Belgium ordered 55 vehicles, which were identical to the German version. The Netherlands ordered 95 vehicles (designated Cheetah PRTL or &quot;Pantser Rups Tegen Luchtdoelen&quot;), split into three batches (CA1, CA2 and CA3), which were equipped with Philips radar systems.

Since the 1980s, Redeye and later Stinger MANPADS teams have been accompanying the Gepard units to take advantage of their long-range scanning capacity. To combine this capacity in a single unit, a missile system upgrade that mounts the Stingers in twin packs to the autocannons was developed. The system was tested by the German Bundeswehr but not bought due to budget restrictions. Instead, the Ozelot Light Air Defence System (LeFlaSys) was fielded for the three Airborne Brigades.

==Technology and systems==

The vehicle is based on the hull of the Leopard 1 tank with a large fully rotating turret carrying the armament—a pair of 35 mm Oerlikon KDA autocannons.

===Chassis and propulsion===
The Gepard is based on a slightly modified chassis of the Leopard 1 main battle tank, including the complete drive unit with a 37.4-liter 10-cylinder multi-fuel engine (type: MB 838 CaM 500) with two mechanical superchargers built by MTU Aero Engines. The V-engine with a cylinder angle of 90 degrees has 610 kW at 2200 RPM (830 PS) and consumes—depending on the surface and driving style—around 150 liters per 100 kilometers. To ensure a steady supply of oil, even in difficult terrain and under extreme skew, the engine is provided with a dry sump forced lubrication. Even the gearbox (type: 4 HP-250) from ZF Friedrichshafen and the exhaust system with fresh air admixture to reduce the infrared signature were taken from the Leopard 1 main battle tank.

The Gepard is equipped with a Daimler-Benz (type: OM 314) 4-cylinder diesel auxiliary engine for the energy supply system. This engine is on the front left of the vehicle, located where the Leopard 1 has an ammunition magazine. The engine, which has a 3.8 liter capacity, is designed as a multi-fuel engine and produces . It consumes between 10 and 20 liters per hour, depending on the operational status of the tank.

The auxiliary engine is coupled with five generators to operate at different speeds: Two Metadyn machines in tandem with a flywheel (which is used to store energy during the acceleration and deceleration of the turret) for the power of the elevation and traverse drives, two 380 Hz three-phase generators with a capacity of 20 kVA for the ventilation, fire-control and radar systems, and a 300 A 28 volt direct current generator for the electrical system. The fuel capacity is 985 liters, which ensures a combined operating time of approximately 48 hours.

The chassis and the track were taken directly from the Leopard 1. It has torsion bar spring-mounted roadwheels with seven roadwheel pairs per side. They are connected to the torsion bars on swing arms, whose deflection is limited by volute springs. Drive is through the drive sprockets located at the rear.

The rubber-mounted shocks were modified to achieve better stability during firing. The track is manufactured by the company Diehl, rubber track pads fitted, and is &quot;live&quot; track with rubber bushings between the track links and pins (type: D 640 A). Grouser/icecleats can replace the rubber pads on some track links to increase traction on slippery surfaces.

The hull only had slight modifications, i.e. a modified roadwheel distance (8 cm increased distance between the third and fourth roadwheel) and the transfer of additional batteries in battery boxes at the rear. The batteries and the electrical system operate at 24 volts DC.

===Radar and laser===
Vehicles delivered to the German Bundeswehr and Belgium were equipped with a Siemens MPDR 12 S-band search radar installed on a swing arm (lowered behind the turret for transit) on the rear of the turret, which provides a 15 km hemispherical detection range and has an integrated MSR 400 Mk XII interrogator for automated target discrimination. The Ku band tracking radar also developed by Siemens-Albis has a 15 km range and is mounted at the front of the turret, between the guns; its dome-covered antenna is mounted on a powered base which can traverse in a 180° arc. Additionally, the Gepard has a back-up optical sighting system for passive target acquisition and engagement, consisting of two stabilized, panoramic periscopes for both gunner and commander, with a variable magnification (1.5× and a field of view of 50° and 6× magnification with a narrow, 12.5° FOV). These periscopes can be mechanically engaged by the tracking radar and automatically aimed at the target for preliminary identification. A laser rangefinder was provided on vehicles upgraded to the B2L standard, and installed atop the antenna housing for the tracking radar.

===Guns===

The Gepard utilizes two Oerlikon GDF, 90 calibres () long, with a muzzle velocity of (FAPDS (Frangible Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot) rounds), giving an effective range of . The ammunition is 35×228mm calibre (STANAG 4516).

The KDA autocannon has a dual belt feed for two different ammunition types; the usual loading per gun is 320 AA rounds fed from inside the turret and 20 AP rounds fed from a small outlying storage. The 40 armour-piercing rounds are normally fired singly with the guns alternating; they are also intended for self defence against light armoured ground targets.
Each gun has a firing rate of 550 rounds/min. The combined rate of fire is 1,100 rounds/min, which – in unlimited mode – gives a continuous fire time of 35 seconds before running out of ammunition (with 640 AA rounds for both guns). It is standard to fire bursts against air targets, 24 rounds per gun for a total of 48 in limited mode and 48 rounds per gun for a total of 96 in normal mode. The Ukrainian air defence have found that the guns &quot;take an hour-and-a-half to reload&quot;, thus limiting their effectiveness.

The guns can be elevated to almost a 90-degree vertical angle.

===Variants===
There are two main variants of Gepard; the German Gepard and the Dutch CA1, nicknamed the &#x27;Cheetah&#x27;. The Dutch variant has a different radar installation. 

Gepard 1
*Search radar: S band, 15 km range
*Tracking radar: Ku band, 15 km range
Gepard 1A1
*Improved version with a laser rangefinder
Gepard 1A2
*Upgraded version to fire the FAPDS-T round

CA1 &#x27;Cheetah&#x27;
*Search radar: X band, 15 km range
*Tracking radar: X/Ka band, 13 km range

==Operational history==
===Invasion of Ukraine===

The Gepard has been deployed by Ukraine in its defense against the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 26 April 2022, the German government authorized Krauss-Maffei Wegmann to transfer around 50 refurbished Gepards to Ukraine, including in advance those vehicles that were sold to Brazil and Qatar as a security measure during mass sports events.

The first three Gepards arrived in Ukraine on 25 July 2022 and by the end of September thirty Gepards and 6,000 rounds had been delivered by Germany. On 2 December 2022, Germany recovered seven additional Gepard units from the scrapyard which they planned to refurbish and ship by spring but only 4 of them arrived to Ukraine as of 11 July 2023. In May 2023, 15 Gepards sold to Qatar in 2020 were purchased back by Germany for more than double the purchase price.

All 52 Gepards pledged by Germany were delivered to Ukraine by 22 December 2023. An additional 15 Gepards with 259,680 rounds of ammunition were pledged by Germany on 17 January 2024.

According to a Ukrainian defense attache in the United States the Gepard has been used to &quot;great effect&quot; against the &quot;relatively crude&quot; loitering munition believed to be Iranian-made Shahed-136. The Conflict Intelligence Team considers it likely that a Gepard destroyed a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile as it was targeting a Kyiv power plant on 18 October 2022. One unit is credited with destroying more than ten Shahed-136 drones and two cruise missiles. A system such as the Gepard is more effective and hence more cost-effective than more advanced and expensive air defence systems such NASAMS or IRIS-T missiles, while being less politically sensitive as they only have a limited effective range. The London-based think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) wrote: &quot;In general, gun systems are preferred over missiles where possible due to the much lower cost per engagement and higher availability of ammunition compared with SAMs and MANPADS&quot;. Gepard was considered superior to the Russian Pantsir system&#x27;s autocannon.

Ukraine allegedly suffered its first Gepard loss in April 2023 to a Lancet loitering munition, although the full video shows the Gepard relatively intact after the impact.
==== Delivery of ammunition ====
Obtaining ammunition was initially difficult as Switzerland – owing to its neutrality – forbade Germany and Denmark to transfer their stocks of Swiss-made rounds, and refused to supply its own surplus, forcing Germany to rely on other sources for ammunition.

A July 2022 delivery of ammunition manufactured in Norway was delayed as tests showed that they could not be fired by the Gepard. This issue was resolved by August and about 50,000 Norwegian-made rounds had been received by the end of September, according to Ukraine&#x27;s Armed Forces. Photos from the German tabloid of the Gepard with a Ukrainian crew include high-explosive incendiary (HEI) rounds (where the projectile is yellow with a red band) made by e.g. Norwegian Nammo.

In December 2022, Rheinmetall committed to a new factory in Germany to sidestep the Swiss re-export ban. A deal to start production was signed in February 2023 and the first shipment of new ammunition was delivered to Ukraine in September 2023. Germany delivered the last 3 pledged Gepards to Ukraine by 22 December 2023 along with an additional 30,000 rounds of ammunition.

==Operators==
===Current===
: 34 Gepard 1A2 as of 2024
: 41 as of 2024
: Suppliers:
:** 55 supplied
:** 15 additional to be supplied
:** 60 purchased from Jordan in November 2023 to be supplied to Ukraine for USD $110 million. The first systems started to be delivered in June 2024.

=== Former ===
: 55 delivered, withdrawn from service around 2006, and sold to private companies.
: 30 vehicles were ordered, in 2008 and after testing 4 vehicles, they were withdrawn from service in 2011. According to KMW&#x27;s regional director Stephan Straube, the vehicles were purchased from Belgian firm SABIEX (now OIP Land Systems) and were supposed to be upgraded by a joint effort of FAMAE and a private company, but it ultimately failed due &quot;a lack of proper knowledge about the system&quot; (FAMAE didn&#x27;t accept an offer from KMW of technical support), and costly logistical support.
: 420 originally built for the Bundeswehr (195 B2 and 225 B2L with additional laser rangefinder). During the 1980s they equipped the anti-aircraft artillery regiments of the eleven German mechanized divisions with six batteries each and one additional corps level battalion with three batteries for a total of 69 batteries of six Gepard each. About 220 B2L were later modernised to Gepard 1A2 and equipped five active and the same number of reserve battalions of three batteries with seven Gepard each. This number was further reduced with the planned fielding of MANTIS and the change in military strategy to out-of-area missions. The last 94 of these remained in service until 2010 when they were gradually phased out until 2012 due to high maintenance costs. many of Germany&#x27;s retired Gepards remain in outdoor storage with KMT&#x27;s subsidiary Battle Tank Dismantling GmbH Koch in Rockensußra, Thuringia.
: 60 were purchased from retired Dutch surplus for 21 million dollars. In May 2023, the Pentagon confirmed that an undisclosed number had been purchased by the U.S. for $118 million using funds from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, with an expected delivery date of May 30, 2024. According to the German Defense Ministry, the U.S. plans to deliver up to 30 of these to Ukraine before the end of 2023. In November it was confirmed that the USA had bought all 60 of Jordan&#x27;s Gepards for Ukraine as part of the $118 million deal, with the remaining 30 expected to be delivered by May 2024.
: 95 delivered, withdrawn from service and placed in storage as of 2006; 60 sold to Jordan in 2013.
: In December 2020, it was announced that a license had been issued for the export of a total of 15 Gepard anti-aircraft vehicles to Qatar. Furthermore, four automatic cannons, 30 barrels, 16,000 rounds of ammunition and 45 breechblocks will be delivered as spare parts. These were purchased in order to ensure air security for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In early 2023, German government officials began negotiating with Qatar the possible purchase of their 15 Gepards to send these to Ukraine. In May 2023, it was reported that all 15 Gepards were repurchased by Germany for Ukraine, with Ukraine&#x27;s ambassador for Germany later filmed in front of one of the ex-Qatari Gepards on a training site. Germany purchased the Gepards from Qatar for US$64 million, roughly double the price they were sold to Qatar for a few years earlier.

<doc id="1253395" wikidata="Q164948" url="?curid=1253395" title="Minamoto no Yorimasa">
<text> was a Japanese poet, aristocrat and samurai lord. His poetry appeared in various anthologies. He served eight different emperors in his long career, holding posts such as &quot;hyōgo no kami&quot; (head of the arsenal). As a general, he led the Minamoto armies at the beginning of the Genpei War. Even in later generations, the common name Genzanmi (げんざんみ) was passed down (Yorimasa was not the only person who was called “Genzanmi”, in the same period). Also, like his father, he used the surname “Baba” and was also called “Baba no Yorimasa”

== Biography ==
In the clashes between the Minamoto and Taira clans that had gone on for decades, Yorimasa had tried to stay out of politics, and avoided taking sides. He did participate in the Hōgen rebellion in 1156. For a time, he was even friends with Taira no Kiyomori. During the Heiji rebellion of 1160, he leaned just enough in favor of the Taira that it allowed them to overthrow the Minamoto. However, by the time he officially retired from military service in Kiyomori&#x27;s army in 1179, Yorimasa had changed his mind about opposing his own clan. He entered the Buddhist priesthood and in May 1180, he sent out an appeal to other Minamoto leaders, and to temples and monasteries that Kiyomori had offended.

In the following Genpei War, which began with the Battle of Uji in 1180, Yorimasa led Minamoto forces, along with warrior monks from Miidera, in defending the Byōdō-in temple. Despite the monks&#x27; having torn up the planks of the bridge leading to the temple, the Taira managed to break through their defenses, and take the temple. After suffering this defeat at Uji, he committed ritual suicide at Byōdō-in. Minamoto no Yorimasa&#x27;s suicide by seppuku may be the earliest recorded instance of a samurai&#x27;s suicide in the face of defeat, although Minamoto no Tametomo, who died in 1170, ten years before Yorimasa, may hold this distinction.

According to legend, after his death a retainer took Yorimasa&#x27;s head to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Taira. He then fastened it to a rock and threw it into the Uji River so it could not be found.

== Family ==
Yorimasa had several children including a daughter, poet Nijōin no Sanuki, and a son, samurai lord Minamoto no Nakatsuna.

==Poetry==
In a famous episode in the Taiheiki:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Samidare ni sawabe no makomo mizu koete/izure ayame to hikizo wazurau&quot;

The fifth-month rains swamp the water-oats along the shore,
making it hard to tell irises from one another and pull
just one&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;So, Yorimasa not only added to his reputation as an archer by shooting down a nue; he also proved himself a distinguished poet by winning with a single poem Lady Ayame, whom he had adored for years and months.&quot;

Yorimasa&#x27;s death poem was:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;umoregi no/hana saku koto mo/nakarishi ni/mi no naru hate zo/kanashikarikeru&quot;

Like a fossil tree
From which we gather no flowers
Sad has been my life
Fated no fruit to produce&lt;/poem&gt;

==The slaying of the Nue==
The &quot;Heike Monogatari&quot; and the &quot;Settsu Meisho Zue&quot; from the Settsu Province, tell the following tale of the killing of the Nue:

In the closing years of the Heian period, at the place where the emperor (Emperor Konoe) lived, the Seiryō-den, there appeared a cloud of black smoke along with an eerie resounding crying voice, making Emperor Nijō quite afraid. Subsequently, the emperor fell into illness, and neither medicine nor prayers had any effect.

A close associate remembered Minamoto no Yoshiie using an arrow to put a stop to the mystery case of some bird&#x27;s cry, and he gave the order to a master of arrows, Minamoto no Yorimasa, to slay the monster.

One night, Yorimasa went out to slay the monster with his servant Ino Hayata (written as 猪早太 or 井早太), and an arrow made from an arrowhead he had inherited from his ancestor Minamoto no Yorimitsu and the tailfeathers of a mountain bird. An uncanny black smoke started to cover the Seiryō-den. Yorimasa shot his arrow into it, there was a shriek, and a nue fell down around the northern parts of Nijō Castle. Instantly Ino Hayata seized it and finished it off.

In the skies above the imperial court, two or three cries of the common cuckoo could be heard, and it is thus said that peace had returned. After this, the emperor&#x27;s health instantly recovered, and Yorimasa was given the sword &quot;Shishiō&quot; as a reward.

<doc id="1253396" wikidata="Q1785566" url="?curid=1253396" title="2002 Major League Soccer season">
<text>The 2002 Major League Soccer season was the seventh season of Major League Soccer. It was also the 90th season of FIFA-sanctioned soccer in the United States, and the 24th with a national first-division league.

According to FC Dallas president Dan Hunt, the entire league nearly folded during the 2001 offseason. The owners agreed to shut down the league on a conference call in November 2001, but within two days Lamar Hunt convinced the other owners to give the league another year.

On January 8, 2002, the league folded two of its teams, both of which were in Florida. The Miami Fusion ceased operations after only four years of existence due to low attendance and an unfavorable stadium deal. The Tampa Bay Mutiny also ceased operations due to the lack of local ownership. Additionally, the league eliminated the Central Division and returned to the original two-conference alignment.

Two new stadiums opened this season. The Colorado Rapids moved into Invesco Field at Mile High and the New England Revolution moved into CMGI Field, which was renamed Gillette Stadium on August 5. Additionally, due to renovations at Soldier Field, the Chicago Fire played at Cardinal Stadium in the western suburb of Naperville.

In an effort to lower costs, the number of games was reduced from 32 to 28, marking the fewest games played in league history. The playoffs were also reformatted as the teams with the 8 highest point totals qualified regardless of conference affiliation.

The regular season began on March 23, and concluded on September 22. The 2002 MLS Cup Playoffs began on September 25, and concluded with MLS Cup 2002 on October 20. After three previous losses in the final, the Los Angeles Galaxy won their first MLS Cup with a victory over the New England Revolution.

==Overview==

===Season format===
The season began on March 23 and concluded with MLS Cup on October 20. The 10 teams were split evenly into two conferences. Each team played 28 games that were evenly divided between home and away. Each team played every other team in their conference, and one designated opponent from the opposite conference, four times, and the remaining teams in the opposite conference twice.

The top eight teams regardless of conference qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs. The first round and conference finals were played as a three game series, and the first team to 5 points advanced. The winners of the conference finals advanced to MLS Cup.

The team with the most points in the regular season was awarded the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield. Additionally, the winner of MLS Cup and the runner-up qualified for the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.

<text>Media Television is a Canadian television newsmagazine series created by Moses Znaimer, which aired weekly on Citytv and NewNet from 1991 to 2004. It was also syndicated internationally, airing in over 100 countries around the world at some point during its run.

The show, subtitled &quot;The Modern Art and Science of Persuasion&quot;, offered a behind the scenes examination of the worlds of media, marketing, technology, the internet, print, radio, and television.

It was one of the first syndicated programs to employ a videographer whose role was as camera, interviewer, and host all rolled into one. Media Television&#x27;s primary contribution was its unique examination of worldwide advertising in an intelligent manner.

<text>Cursillos in Christianity (, &quot;Short courses of Christianity&quot;) is an apostolic movement of the Catholic Church. It was conceived in Spain between 1940 and 1949 and began with the celebration of the so-called &quot;first course&quot; from January 7 to 10, 1949 at the Monastery of Sant Honorat, Mallorca.

==Description==
Cursillo is the original Catholic three-day movement, and has since been licensed for use by several denominations. Some of which have retained the trademarked &quot;Cursillo&quot; name, while others have modified its talks/methods and given it a different name. In the United States, Cursillo is a registered trademark of the National Cursillo Center in Jarrell, Texas.

The &quot;Cursillo&quot; focuses on showing Christian laypeople how to become effective Christian leaders over the course of a three-day weekend. The weekend includes fifteen talks, called &quot;rollos&quot;, which are given by priests and by laypeople. The major emphasis of the weekend is to ask participants to take what they have learned back into the world, on what is known as the &quot;fourth day.&quot; The method stresses personal spiritual development, promoted by subsequent group reunions after the initial weekend.

==History==
Cursillos first appeared in Spain in 1944. A layman named Eduard Bonnin and group of close collaborators started celebrating them on different places on Majorca at about one per year. When endorsed by the bishop in 1949, it picked up strength and began spreading to Spain and the rest of the world, to the point that it became an active renewal movement in the Church. In 1957, the movement had spread to North America, when the first American &quot;cursillo&quot; was held in Waco, Texas. In 1959, the Cursillo spread throughout Texas and to Phoenix, Arizona. In August of that year, the first national convention of spiritual directors was held, and &quot;Ultreya&quot; magazine began publication. In 1960, growth of the Cursillo quickened in the American Southwest, and weekends were held for the first time in the East in New York City and Lorain Ohio.

Until 1961, all weekends were held in Spanish. That year the first English-speaking weekend was held in San Angelo, Texas. Also in 1961, first weekends were held in San Francisco, California; Gary, Indiana; Lansing, Michigan; Guaynabo, Puerto Rico; and Gallup, New Mexico. In 1962, the Cursillo Movement came to the Eastern United States. Weekends were held in Cincinnati, Brooklyn, Saginaw, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Newark, Baltimore, Grand Rapids, Kansas City and Boston. In the West, the first weekends were held in Monterey, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Pueblo and Yakima. The movement spread rapidly with the early centers carrying the Cursillo to nearby dioceses. By 1981, almost all of the 160 dioceses in the United States had introduced the Cursillo Movement.

The Cursillo Movement in the United States was organized on a national basis in 1965. A National Secretariat was formed and the National Cursillo Office (currently in Jarrell, Texas) was established. It is joined to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops through an official liaison in the person of Bishop Emeritus Carlos A. Sevilla S.J. from the Diocese of Yakima, and through the Bishops&#x27; Secretariat for the Laity in Washington, D.C. The spiritual advisor for the movement in the United States is Rev. Alex Waraksa from the Diocese of Knoxville, Tennessee.

In 1980, the Cursillo Movement established a worldwide international office, the OMCC (&quot;Organismo Mundial de Cursillos de Cristiandad&quot;). The international office is located in Portugal for the 2014–2017 term.

Today, Cursillo is a worldwide movement with centers in nearly all South and Central American countries, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Great Britain, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Austria, Australia, New Zealand Aotearoa, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and in several African countries. The movement is recognized by the Holy See as member of the International Catholic Organizations of the Pontifical Council for the Laity in Rome.

==&quot;De Colores&quot;==
In the Cursillo movement, being &quot;in colors&quot; is to be in God&#x27;s grace. For that reason, Cursillo participants (cursillistas) greet each other with the phrase &quot;De Colores&quot; (in Colors).

A story from the early days of the movement in Spain tells of an occasion where a group of men were returning from a Cursillo weekend when their bus broke down. They began to sing &quot;De Colores&quot;, a traditional folk song. The use of the song in Cursillo took hold, and has held up as the movement has spread outside the Spanish-speaking world and to other denominations. The use of a multi-colored rooster as a symbol for the Cursillo movement is believed to have originated from one of the verses of that song.

==Use by other Christian denominations==

This retreat is also used by Episcopal Cursillo Ministry (Episcopal/Anglican, Presbyterian Pilgrimage &amp; Cursillo (Presbyterian, Via de Cristo (Lutheran), Way of Christ (Mennonite), Walk to Emmaus (Methodist), and &quot;Tres Días&quot; (ecumenical).

==Analogous retreats==

The Cursillo method is used by ACTS, Encounter, Antioch, Search, Awakening (college students), Cum Christo, DeColores (adult ecumenical), the Great Banquet, Happening, The Journey (United Church of Christ), Kairos Prison Ministry, Kairos (for older teenagers), Emmaus in Connecticut (for high school age teens), Gennesaret (for those living with a serious illness), Koinonia, Lamplighter Ministries, Light of Love, LOGOS (Love Of God, Others, and Self) (Lutheran teen), Teens Encounter Christ (teen ecumenical), Residents Encounter Christ (REC) (a jail/prison ministry), Tres Dias, Unidos en Cristo, Via de Cristo (Lutheran Adult), Chrysalis Flight (Methodist Youth), Walk to Emmaus (Methodist Adult), The Walk with Christ (interdenominational), Anglican 4th Day (Anglican Adult), The Way of Christ (Canadian Lutheran adult), Tres Arroyos (Charismatic Episcopal Church). and Journey to Damascus (Catholic hosted Ecumenical with weekly reunion groups for alumni) in the Corpus Christi, Houston, and Austin, TX, areas.

A derivative retreat for Catholics is called &quot;Welcome.&quot; It is a 2-day retreat, normally Saturday and Sunday, and therefore does not qualify for the term &quot;cursillo&quot; meant to apply to a 3-day retreat.

Another derivative movement called &#x27;An Emmaus Experience&#x27; was developed from the Cursillo at a Catholic parish in Miami, Florida, and has made some inroads. Its 3-day format borrows significantly from the Cursillo manual, but is primarily focused on the parish and not on the &#x27;environments&#x27; of the world. Emmaus also has no formal method of &#x27;4th day&#x27; continuity such as the Cursillo &#x27;friendship groups&#x27; and &#x27;service sheets&#x27; to keep members accountable in their practice of the method. This &#x27;Emmaus Experience&#x27; derivative movement is centered on the Roman Catholic faith (from which the Cursillo movement originated) and differs from the &#x27;Walk to Emmaus&#x27; version which emphasizes non-denominational practices for an ecumenical audience.

<text>Marc Alan Johnson (born October 21, 1953, in Omaha, Nebraska) is an American jazz bass player, composer and band leader. Johnson was born in Nebraska and grew up in Texas. He is married to the Brazilian jazz pianist and singer Eliane Elias.

== Career ==
At the age of 19, Johnson was working professionally with the Fort Worth Symphony, and while at the University of North Texas, he played in the One O&#x27;Clock Lab Band and was also the principal bassist in the NTSU Symphony.

In 1978, Johnson joined pianist Bill Evans in what would be Evans&#x27;s last trio. Johnson toured and recorded with Evans until the death of the pianist in 1980. In 2007 he released the tribute album &quot;Something For You&quot;—a tribute to Evans—together with his wife, pianist Eliane Elias.

His credits since then include albums with Joe Lovano, Michael Brecker, Stan Getz, Bob Brookmeyer, Gary Burton, John Abercrombie, Bill Frisell, Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays, Eliane Elias, Enrico Pieranunzi, Joey Baron, Philly Joe Jones, Jack DeJohnette, Peter Erskine, Paul Motian, Steps Ahead and many others. He has also appeared as a leader of his own bands, starting with Bass Desires, a quartet that featured Bill Frisell and John Scofield on electric guitar, with Peter Erskine on drums, which gained international recognition following two ECM recordings in the mid-1980s. He also recorded two albums of his group Right Brain Patrol for JMT Records, followed by his &quot;Sound of Summer Running&quot; release on Verve. His ECM release &quot;Shades of Jade&quot; was featured in &quot;Time&#x27;s&quot; October 17, 2005, issue &quot;5 CDs That Really Swing&quot;, as one of the five top jazz releases of the season. It was selected by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; as one of the 10 best jazz recordings of 2005 and also received the Danish Music Award for Best Foreign Release in 2005. It features his wife Eliane Elias on piano, Joe Lovano on tenor saxophone, John Scofield on guitar and Joey Baron on drums.

As a follow-up to &quot;Shades of Jade&quot;, in 2012, the ECM recording &quot;Swept Away&quot; was released. This album is a collaboration with pianist/composer Eliane Elias. It includes Joe Lovano on tenor saxophone and Joey Baron on drums. The music consists of all original compositions. As a producer, Johnson won two Grammy Awards for co-producing Eliane Elias&#x27; albums &quot;Made in Brazil&quot; (2016) and &quot;Dance of Time&quot; (2017) on Concord Records.

<text>The Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) is a major command (MAJCOM) of the United States Air Force, with its headquarters at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. It is the federal Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the U.S. Air Force, consisting of commissioned officers and enlisted airmen. Together, the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard constitute the Air Force element of the reserve components of the United States Armed Forces. AFRC also plays an integral role in the day-to-day Air Force mission and is not strictly a force held in reserve for possible war or contingency operations. AFRC also supports the United States Space Force through the 310th Space Wing, pending the creation of a space reserve component.

== Overview ==
The federal reserve component of the United States Air Force, AFRC has approximately 450 aircraft assigned for which it has sole control, as well as access to several hundred additional active duty USAF aircraft via AFRC &quot;Associate&quot; wings that are collocated with active duty Air Force wings, sharing access to those same active duty Air Force aircraft. The inventory, both AFRC-controlled and active duty Regular Air Force-controlled, includes the latest, most capable models of aircraft that are assigned to the U.S. Air Force. On any given day, 99 percent of AFRC&#x27;s aircraft are mission-ready and able to deploy within 72 hours. In addition to flying units, AFRC has numerous ground organizations ranging from medical units to civil engineers, intelligence, and security forces, just to name a few.

The purpose of the Air Force Reserve, as derived from Title 10 of the United States Code (Title 10 U.S.C.), is to:
&quot;Provide combat-ready units and individuals for active duty whenever there are not enough trained units and people in the Regular component of the Air Force to perform any national security mission.&quot;

Unlike the Air National Guard, which alternates between a &quot;state&quot; status and a &quot;federal&quot; status via both Title 32 of the United States Code (Title 32 U.S.C.) and Title 10 U.S.C., the Air Force Reserve is strictly a &quot;federal&quot; reserve component under Title 10 U.S.C. and operates as an independent Major Command (MAJCOM), i.e., Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). In combination with the Air National Guard, the Air Force Reserve comprises half of what is known as the Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the United States Air Force. AFRC forces are under the administrative control (ADCON) of the Commander, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC/CC). When activated or mobilized (e.g., under 10 U.S.C. §§ 12301(a), 12302, 12304, 12304a, or 12304b), combatant command authority (COCOM) transfers to the combatant commander to which the forces are assigned/attached and operational control (OPCON) transfers to the operational chain of command established by that commander. In addition, AFRC forces are also assigned to deployable Air Expeditionary Forces (AEFs) and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty Regular Air Force and part-time Air National Guard counterparts in their assigned deployment cycle window.

The Air Force Reserve also contains other specialized capabilities not found in regular active duty Air Force units. For example, the Air Force Reserve conducts two unique mission sets for which it possesses the sole USAF capability:

* Aerial Spray Missions
** At the request of local, state or federal agencies, the Air Force Reserve can conduct aerial spray missions employing insecticides or herbicides with specially-equipped C-130 aircraft.
* Hurricane and Weather Reconnaissance
** The Air Force Reserve maintains the Air Force&#x27;s sole aerial weather reconnaissance capability, to include hurricane and typhoon penetration by its own WC-130J aircraft, augmenting the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3D aircraft fleet.

A third unique mission set in the Air Force Reserve, Aerial Firefighting, is conducted in tandem with the Air National Guard and also has no counterpart in the Regular Air Force. Certain units of the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard can conduct forest fire and wildfire suppression missions using specially equipped C-130 Hercules aircraft using the palletized Modular Airborne FireFighting System (MAFFS).

Along with its Regular Air Force and Air National Guard partners, the Air Force Reserve also participates in national and international humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) missions as directed by higher authority.

Like their Air National Guard counterparts, the Air Force Reserve also supports counter-narcotics (CN) operations by performing detection and interdiction efforts outside the United States in coordination with the U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies.

== Reserve categories ==
There are several categories of service for personnel in the Air Force Reserve. Most Air Force Reservists are part-time Traditional Reservists (TR) who serve in the Unit Program, in which they are required to report for duty with their parent Air Force Reserve Command unit, typically a wing, group or squadron, at least one weekend a month and an additional two weeks a year (e.g., 38 days). However, many Air Force Reservists, especially those in an active flying status, serve well in excess of this minimum duty requirement, often in excess of 120-man-days a year.

A smaller but equally important category of TR is the Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA). IMAs are part-time Air Force Reservists who are assigned to active duty Air Force units and organizations, combat support agencies, Unified Combatant Commands and the Joint Staff to do jobs that are essential in wartime or during contingency operations, but do not require full-time manning during times of peace. They report for duty a minimum of two days a month and twelve additional days a year, but like their Unit Program counterparts, many IMAs serve well in excess of the minimum military duty requirement, providing multiple weeks or months of active duty &quot;man-days&quot; in support of active duty USAF and joint commands.

A smaller number of Reservists serve limited tours of extended active duty in an Active Duty Special Work (ADSW) status, usually at an Air Force headquarters staff level, in the joint combatant commands, or in other special assignments. Their job is to bring Air Force Reserve expertise to the planning and decision-making processes at senior levels within the Air Force, other services, and the Unified Combatant Commands.Like the Air National Guard, the Air Force Reserve Command also requires two categories of full-time personnel to perform functions that require full-time manning. These full-time positions are filled via the same two programs as employed by the Air National Guard: the Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) program and the Air Reserve Technician (ART) program.

Air Force Reservists who become members of the Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) receive full active duty pay and benefits just like active duty members of any branch of the armed forces. The majority of AGRs are former TRs and they serve four-year controlled tours of special duty that can be renewed. Many AGRs serve with operational AFRC flying and non-flying wings and groups; at active and reserve numbered air forces; on the staffs of other USAF Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Field Operating Agencies (FOAs) and Direct Reporting Units (DRUs); on the Air Staff at Headquarters, U.S. Air Force (HAF); on the staffs of Unified Combatant Commands; on the Joint Staff and in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). AFRC Recruiting is another field that employs AGR personnel. AGRs also have the option with good performance to serve 20 or more years on active duty and receive a retirement after 20 or more years, just like active members of the Regular Air Force.Another category of Air Force Reservists serving full-time are those in the Air Reserve Technician Program (ART). ARTs are accessed from either the active duty Regular Air Force, the AGR program, Traditional Guardsmen (TG) in the Air National Guard, or TRs in the Air Force Reserve. ARTs carry a dual status, working for the Air Force as both full-time civil service employees and as uniformed military members in the same AFRC units where they work as Department of the Air Force Civilians (DAFC), performing the same job duties. Although &quot;technically&quot; civil servants part of the time, all ART officers must maintain a reserve commission on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) as a TR and all ART enlisted personnel must maintain a current reserve enlistment as a TR as a precondition for both hiring and continued career employment as an ART. In addition, all ART officers and ART enlisted personnel wear their uniforms and utilize their rank titles at all times when on duty, regardless if they are in a DAFC status or in a drilling or active duty military status. Most ART personnel are assigned to operational AFRC flying wings, groups and squadrons in various operational flying, aircraft maintenance and other support positions and functions, up to and including wing commander. Because ARTs are not eligible for DAFC retirement until reaching age 60, and because a condition of their employment as an ART is contingent upon their maintaining an active reserve military status until reaching age 60, ARTs are not subject to the same maximum years of service limitations by pay grade that impact non-ART personnel. As such, ART personnel are permitted to remain in uniform until age 60, typically past a point that would otherwise require their retirement from military service based on rank, pay grade and years of service.Traditional Reservists (TR) are categorized by several criteria in either the Ready Reserve, Standby Reserve, Individual Ready Reserve or Retired Reserve:
* Ready Reserve
: Approximately 74,000 trained personnel who may be recalled to Active Duty to augment active forces in time of war, contingency operations, or other national emergency. This category also includes all full-time ART personnel. They are predominantly assigned to the Unit Program or as IMAs.
* Standby Reserve
: Includes Reservists whose civilian jobs are considered key to national defense or who have temporary disability or personal hardship. Most do not train, are not assigned to units and are typically not eligible for promotion/advancement.
* Individual Ready Reserve (IRR)
: Comprises members who no longer train with combat ready Reserve units, but are qualified in their fields and eligible to be recalled in the event of a national emergency.
: There is a small group labeled as Participating IRR (PIRR) who receive points toward military retirement, but not drill pay or Annual Training with pay and are under what the Air Force Reserve (and Air National Guard) designates as Category E (CAT E) status. Some PIRR members continue to participate with existing Air Force organizations in a non-pay status or in Unified Combatant Commands where they may be eligible to perform Active Duty for Training (ADT), Active Duty for Operational Support (ADOS), Active Duty Special Work (ADSW) ... also known as &quot;mandays&quot; ... or voluntary Mobilization to Active Duty (MOB) with full pay and allowances. CAT E Air Force Reservists also include some 1,000 USAF Academy Liaison Officers (ALOs), Civil Air Patrol Reserve Liaison Officers (RLOs), chaplains, and a few other positions that require military duty, but not a fixed schedule. These CAT E personnel can also earn active duty mandays with pay just like CAT A and B reservists, but on a more limited basis.
* Retired Reserve
: The Retired Reserve is made up of retired personnel who receive pay after retiring from Active Duty or a Reserve Component, or are Reservists awaiting retirement pay at age 60. Some exceptions are made for certain Reservists mobilized to Active Duty since 11 September 2001 who may receive retirement pay earlier on a sliding scale between ages 50 and 60. Eligibility for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Standard medical coverage for retirees and their families is delayed until the retiree reaches age 60.

== Associate Program ==
A USAF Associate Unit is a unit where active duty, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard members combine forces and missions using &quot;Total Force&quot; concept integration. The Air Force Reserve Command Associate Program provides trained crews and maintenance personnel for active-duty owned aircraft. This unique program pairs a Reserve unit with an active-duty unit to share a single set of aircraft and rests on the idea that there are more operational requirements than there are manpower to fulfill them. The Associate Reserve program is based on providing manpower to complement the Total Force.

Previously, an associate unit was one where the active duty (typically a wing level organization) owned the aircraft and the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard wing or group co-located with the active duty unit, providing only manpower. To take advantage of the synergies and aircraft, active duty units are now being stood up at what were previously Air Force Reserve Command or Air National Guard locations, where the Air Reserve Component organization technically &quot;owns&quot; the aircraft, but share them with an active duty squadron, group or wing that provides additional manning. This enables the Air Force to be more productive in meeting the global demands for primarily the Mobility Air Forces (MAF), the Air Force&#x27;s cargo and aerial refueling aircraft, although the concept is now being extended to the Combat Air Forces (CAF), the Air Force&#x27;s fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, rescue and special operations aircraft, as well. The result is a more cost-effective way to meet increasing mission requirements.

* In an active associate unit, the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard owns the aircraft, while the active duty Regular Air Force embeds a squadron, group or wing that provides air crews, aircraft maintenance and support personnel who share the responsibility of flying and maintaining the AFRC or ANG aircraft.
* In a traditional associate unit, Air Force Reservists fly and maintain aircraft owned by the active duty Regular Air Force. In many of these units, particularly in the MAF, the aircraft have been re-marked to include both Regular Air Force and Air Force Reserve Command or Air National Guard organizational and unit markings.
* A corollary unit is an Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard squadron or group attached to an active duty squadron or group.

Associate unit reservists are most heavily concentrated in the Air Mobility Command (AMC) and fly AMC&#x27;s largest airlifters, the C-5 Galaxy, and the newest AMC global airlifter, the C-17 Globemaster III, with Air Force Reserve associate crews accounting for nearly 50 percent of the Air Force&#x27;s total C-5 and C-17 air crew capability. AFRC also provides sole Formal Training Unit (FTU) functions in the C-5 for the Regular Air Force, the Air Force Reserve, and prior to the C-5&#x27;s retirement from that component, the Air National Guard.

AFRC also provides aerial refueling capability with aircrews operating AMC KC-10 Extenders in associate units and KC-135 Stratotankers in both associate and Air Reserve Component air mobility wings, air refueling wings and air refueling groups. Associate KC-10 units provide 50 percent of the KC-10 crews and contribute 50 percent to the maintenance force. Air Force Reservists also contribute about 13 percent of total KC-135 aerial refueling requirements.

In another alignment with AMC, more than 9,100 Air Force Reservists train in the C-130 Hercules theater airlift mission in a variety of aircrew, aircraft maintenance and support skills as both stand alone AFRC units and in &quot;Associate&quot; arrangements with Regular Air Force and Air National Guard C-130 units. In wartime, AFRC provides 23 percent of Air Force&#x27;s total C-130 theater airlift force, with nearly half of the Air Force Reserve&#x27;s airlift units flying their own unit-assigned C-130 Hercules aircraft, several of which have now integrated Active Associate units from the Regular Air Force. The C-130&#x27;s speed, range, load-carrying characteristics and capability to operate under difficult terrain conditions make it an invaluable and versatile aircraft, strong enough to deliver its cargo on unimproved landing strips.

Other AMC-aligned AFRC missions involve aeromedical evacuation and special air support operations.

Air Combat Command (ACC) F-22A Raptor air dominance fighters, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15E Strike Eagle multipurpose fighters, A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft, MQ-1 Predator remotely-piloted aircraft are jointly operated by ACC active duty personnel and AFRC aircrews via Associate units.

Several AFRC Air Operations Centers (AOCs) also operate as stand alone units or in associate augmentation to ACC, AMC, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and U.S. Air Forces Central (AFCENT) AOCs operating the AN/USQ-163 Falconer AOC weapons system.

In associate programs with the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), AFRC support undergraduate pilot training by providing instructor pilots in the T-6 Texan II, T-38 Talon and T-1 Jayhawk.

AFRC Space Operations associate units aligned with the United States Space Force also operate Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), Defense Support Program (DSP) and Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites as well as various cyber warfare systems.

== Unit Program with AFRC-owned Aircraft ==
AFRC also operates numerous F-16 and A-10 aircraft in stand-alone AFRC fighter wings that are operationally aligned with the Air Combat Command (ACC). AFRC&#x27;s HC-130 and HH-60 combat search and rescue (CSAR) aircraft are also assigned to stand-alone flying units that are operationally aligned with ACC. A single AFRC bomb wing is equipped with the B-52 and is operationally aligned with Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC).

AFRC also operates stand-alone C-5, C-17, C-130, C-40, KC-46 and KC-135 units that are operated by the Air Mobility Command (AMC). The Air Force Reserve also operates the WC-130 Hurricane Hunter in the weather reconnaissance mission and provides the sole USAF capability for this mission set.

In tandem with Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), AFRC previously operated the MC-130E Combat Talon I aircraft until its retirement in 2013. AFRC&#x27;s sole special operations wing currently operates the C-146A Wolfhound, C-145A Skytruck, and U-28A, providing Formal Training Unit (FTU) functions for both the active duty Air Force and the Air Force Reserve on those aircraft. The 919 SOW also operates the MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) in the attack and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) roles.

== Units ==

Nearly 70,000 reservists are assigned to specific Air Force Reserve units. These are the people who are obligated to report for duty for a minimum one weekend each month and two weeks of annual training a year, with most performing many additional days of military duty. Reserve aircrews, for example, average more than 120 military duty days a year, often flying in support of national objectives at home and around the world. Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs), the special group of reservists who work as Air Force civil service employees during the week in the same jobs they hold as reservists on drill weekends and active duty periods, provide a degree of continuity that serves to make the Air Force Reserve a relevant combat force. ARTs are the full-time backbone of the unit training program, providing day-to-day leadership, administrative and logistical support, and operational continuity for their units. More than 9,500 reservists, over 15 percent of the force, serve full-time as ARTs.

== History ==
=== Total Force concept ===
The Air Force Reserve (AFRES) was created as a separate operating agency (SOA) and replaced a major command – Continental Air Command – which inactivated in August 1968. Upon activation, AFRES assumed command of all personnel, equipment and aircraft previously assigned to ConAC.

As the 1970s unfolded, the challenge then was to find the right mix of forces for mission effectiveness. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird adopted the Total Force concept in August 1970 with Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger declaring it policy in 1973.

With the implementation of the Total Force Policy, the Air Force Reserve became a multi-mission force, flying the same modern aircraft as the active Air Force. Mobilization planning and operational evaluation were integrated with the corresponding active duty functions. With the same equipment and budget authority, the Air Force Reserve was held to the same readiness standards and inspections as regular Air Force units. Special operations, air refueling, weather reconnaissance, and, once again, fighter missions were added to the airlift, rescue, and mission support roles performed by the Air Force Reserve. The associate concept soon expanded to include the C-5 Galaxy.

=== Cold War era ===
Air Force Reserve participation in Air Force exercises and deployments perfected its mobility capabilities as demonstrated throughout the seventies. This was most notable during Operation Nickel Grass, the Israeli assistance airlift of 1973, with some 630 crew members volunteering for Middle East missions including flying into Ben Gurion Airport, Tel Aviv. Another 1,590 Reservists performed missions worldwide, freeing up additional active crews to support the airlift.

The 1980s saw the modernization and expansion of the Air Force Reserve program. KC-10 Extenders joined the associate force in 1981, expanding its air refueling capability. Fighter units obtained the more modern A-10 Thunderbolt II ground support aircraft and F-4 Phantom IIs, and in 1984, the Air Force Reserve received its first F-16A Fighting Falcon. Operationally, the Air Force Reserve participated in Operation Urgent Fury, the return of American students from Grenada in 1983, performed air refuelings of F-111 bombers during the El Dorado Canyon raid on Libyan-sponsored terrorists in 1986, and acted as a full partner in Operation Just Cause which ousted Panama&#x27;s General Manuel Noriega in 1989–1990. Air Force Reservists also supported humanitarian and disaster relief efforts, including resupply and evacuation missions in the aftermath of 1989&#x27;s Hurricane Hugo. The Reserve&#x27;s continual volunteering allayed the concerns of those who believed the Air Force Reserve would not be available when really needed.

=== Middle East and Yugoslav operations ===
Air Force Reserve airlift and tanker crews were flying within days of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. When ground operations commenced as part of Operation Desert Storm, Air Force Reserve A-10s from the NAS New Orleans–based 926th Tactical Fighter Group (926 TFG) operated close to the front lines along with Air Force Reserve special operations and rescue forces. A Reservist scored the first-ever A-10 air-to-air kill. When Operations Desert Shield/Storm ended, the Air Force Reserve counted 23,500 Reservists mobilized with another 15,000 serving in a volunteer capacity.

The Air Force Reserve had become indistinguishable from the active force in capability; there was no difference between an Air Force Reserve pilot and an active duty pilot, or a boom operator, or loadmaster.

In the aftermath of Desert Storm, Air Force Reservists continued to serve and were heavily involved in both Operation Northern Watch and Operation Southern Watch during the 1990s, enforcing the United Nations-mandated no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq as well as in humanitarian relief missions during Operation Provide Comfort to assist uprooted Iraqi Kurds. For over six years, Air Force Reserve C-130s performed these Provide Comfort missions on a rotational basis while F-16s and combat rescue HH-60 Pave Hawks deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, for the no-fly operations. In 1993, when tensions mounted in Bosnia, Air Force Reserve tanker and fighter units participated in enforcing the Operation Deny Flight no-fly zone while airlift units ensured logistical resupply.

Following Operation DESERT STORM in 1991, the Air Force increasingly relied on its Air Reserve Component, both AFRC and ANG, for a &quot;steady state&quot; of daily assistance, whether it was flying airlift channel; providing fighter, tanker and theater airlift support of &quot;no fly&quot; zone enforcement operations in Southwest Asia; aerial fire fighting; aerial spray; hurricane hunter missions; military air/sea rescue support of NASA Space Shuttle operations; or providing highly skilled medical and aeromedical personnel. As a result, Congress sought to clarify the organizational placement of the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) in the larger active duty Air Force organizational structure. Accordingly, in February 1997, the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) officially became the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), the Air Force&#x27;s ninth major command.

Between March and September 1999, Air Force Reservists volunteered and were also mobilized for Operation Allied Force operations over Serbia and Kosovo. The involuntary recall marked the ninth time the Air Force had requested a mobilization of Air Force Reserve units and personnel since 1950. In summary, Reservists provided 150,000 mandays of support that spanned the spectrum of Air Force missions. The Air Force Reserve once again proved itself as an adaptable and capable force, ready to perform the full range of Air Force operations on an integrated and daily basis in sync with the new Air Expeditionary Task Force (AEF) concepts.

=== Global War on Terrorism ===
When terrorists attacked the United States on 11 September 2001, Air Force Reservists responded in full measure. Air Force Reserve F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters flew Combat air patrols (CAPs) protecting America&#x27;s cities while AFRC KC-135 Stratotankers and E-3 Sentry AWACs aircraft supported with air refuelings and security. In October 2001, the United States initiated the Global War on Terrorism as military forces entered Afghanistan to combat the Taliban in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Air Force Reserve special operations MC-130 Combat Talon aircraft became the first fixed-wing aircraft to penetrate Afghan airspace while Air Force Reserve F-16 crews, already deployed in theater for Operation Southern Watch, performed the first combat missions.

Air Force Reservists made significant contributions by flying close air support, combat delivery, rescue, strategic airlift, and air refueling missions supporting operations in Afghanistan. They also provided B-52 Stratofortress, special operations, aeromedical, security forces, and civil engineering support. Air Force Reserve A-10s, HH-60s and C-130 Hercules continue to perform rotational tours in Afghanistan, and Air Force Reservists have been instrumental in building the Afghan National Army Air Corps.

When Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the war against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime in Iraq began in March 2003, Air Force Reserve combat-ready A-10, B-52, and F-16 aircrews flew numerous strike operations during the first hours of engagement and performed special operations and rescue missions. Air Reserve rescue personnel were among the first into Tallil Air Base as Reserve A-10s provided close air support. Part of the lead tanker force, Reserve tankers offloaded more than 21 million pounds of fuel to more than 1,000 aircraft. In late March 2003, fifteen C-17 Globemaster III Reserve associate crews supported the C-17 airdrop, which opened up the Northern Front in Iraq.

Additionally, Reservists supported Air Force Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) missions and space-based operations in Southwest Asia, providing essential data to battlefield commanders. During the combat phase (19 March-1 May) of OIF, Air Force Reserve aircraft and crews flew nearly 162,000 hours and deployed 70 unit-equipped aircraft in theater while aeromedical personnel provided 45 percent of the Air Force&#x27;s aeromedical crews that performed 3,108 patient movements.

The Air Force Reserve continues to expand its associate construct across the mission spectrum. Specific examples are the Air Force Reserve 477th Fighter Group associating at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, flying the F-22 Raptor jointly with the PACAF 3d Wing and the active duty associating with the C-40 Clipper-equipped 932d Airlift Wing with the 375th Air Mobility Wing at Scott AFB, Illinois, and the 433d Airlift Wing C-5 Galaxy at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas. On the horizon, associate units will include future weapon systems such as the F-35 Lightning II and the Next-Generation Bomber in the 2020s.

<text>Transmitter Berlin-Britz was a broadcasting facility for medium wave, shortwave and FM on the site of a former tree nursery in Berlin-Britz. It was established in 1946 and until 1993 it was the most important transmitter of RIAS. It was used by Deutschlandradio until 4 September 2013, and was finally demolished on 18 July 2015.

The Berlin-Britz transmitter initially used a wire supported between two tall wooden poles. This aerial was replaced in 1947 by a guyed insulated steel framework mast. This mast was replaced in turn in 1948 by two guyed insulated steel framework masts, each with a height of and which still exist today. These masts were extended in subsequent years so that today they are and tall and carry FM radio broadcasting antennas.

Since 1949 the Berlin-Britz transmitter has also been a shortwave transmission facility. A dipole aerial aligned in east–west direction was installed. A second shortwave broadcasting aerial in the form of a dipole with whole length was built in 1983.

A cross dipole aerial for the medium wave frequency 990 kHz was built in 1978 to provide better coverage to the former East Germany for RIAS’ first channel. This aerial for circular polarization radiated vertically in the ionosphere and permitted good reception of RIAS 1 in the entire former East Germany. This aerial was mounted on five guyed masts each with a height of and was shut down at the end of 1995.

<text>Matapédia is an album by the Canadian duo Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, released in 1996.

Kate&#x27;s daughter Martha Wainwright appears on the album as a backing vocalist; she is also directly mentioned in the lyrics of the title track.

The title &quot;Matapédia&quot; refers to the river in eastern Quebec that runs down to the town of Matapédia, Quebec, and then out into baie des Chaleurs. The rhythm of the river is supposed to be the inspiration for the loping beat of the album&#x27;s title track.

The album won the Juno Award for Roots &amp; Traditional Album of the Year - Group at the Juno Awards of 1997.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that the songs &quot;reflect on time&#x27;s passage with a mixture of haunting ambiguity and bittersweet longing—qualities that have defined the duo&#x27;s songbook from the beginning.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that &quot;the old-time folksiness of the McGarrigles&#x27; sound is in the foreground once more, carried by fiddles and accordions.&quot;

AllMusic wrote that the sisters &quot;return to their strengths by trimming back the synthesizers and sticking with direct, folky testaments.&quot;

<text>Pitiscus is a lunar impact crater that lies in the southern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side, just to the northwest of the larger crater Hommel. It was named after German mathematician Bartholomaeus Pitiscus in 1935. The crater is worn, but still forms a prominent feature upon the surface. The rim is roughly circular, but appears oval from the Earth due to foreshortening. There is an outward bulge to the south-southeast where the interior has slumped. The remainder of the inner wall still displays s, although they are worn and rounded due to erosion.

The interior floor is level and appears to have been resurfaced by lava. There is a low central peak formation at the midpoint of the interior, and the northern end of this ridge is overlaid by the circular crater Pitiscus A. A slumped and somewhat irregular crater, Pitiscus E, lies along the inner wall to the west-southwest. The interior floor is also marked by several other tiny craters alongside the eastern interior wall.

Pitiscus is a crater of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Pitiscus.

<text>Susie Ibarra (born Anaheim, November 15, 1970) is an American contemporary composer and percussionist who has worked and recorded with jazz, classical, world, and indigenous musicians. One of SPIN&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of Alternative Music,&quot; she is known for her work as a performer in avant-garde, jazz, world, and new music. As a composer, Ibarra incorporates diverse styles and the influences of Philippine Kulintang, jazz, classical, poetry, musical theater, opera, and electronic music. Ibarra remains active as a composer, performer, educator, and documentary filmmaker in the U.S., Philippines, and internationally. She is interested and involved in works that blend folkloric and indigenous tradition with avant-garde. In 2004, Ibarra began field recording indigenous Philippine music, and in 2009 she co-founded Song of the Bird King, an organization focusing on the preservation of Indigenous music and ecology.

==Early years==

The youngest of five children, Ibarra was born in Anaheim, California, and raised in Houston, Texas. Her parents Bartolome and Herminia Ibarra were both physicians who immigrated from the Philippines. She began playing piano at the age of four. In grade school she sang in church and school choirs and played in a punk rock band in high school. While at Sarah Lawrence College in the late 1980s, Ibarra attended a Sun Ra performance which she has credited with kindling her interest in jazz. She also attended the Mannes College The New School for Music and Goddard College, where she received her B.A. in Music.

Ibarra has lived in New York since 1989.

She has studied with notable jazz and avant-jazz drummers Vernel Fournier, Earl Buster Smith, and Milford Graves. She has studied Philippine Kulintang music with National Endowment for the Arts Heritage Artist and Danongan &quot;Danny&quot; Kalanduyan and the Kalanduyan family, both in the United States and in Cotabato, Mindanao Philippines.

==As a performer==

== Indigenous music and ecology ==
Ibarra began field recording kulintang gong music in the Philippines in 2004. In 2007, she received an Asian Cultural Council Fellowship to research indigenous and folkloric music in the Philippines. Ibarra and Roberto Juan Rodriguez researched, recorded, and filmed seven endangered indigenous tribes in the Philippines from 2008 to 2009 and documented the conservation efforts on behalf of the near extinct Philippine eagle. In 2009, they founded Song of the Bird King to concentrate on the preservation of indigenous music and ecology.

In 2018, the Asian Cultural Council gave Ibarra a fellowship to support her Himalayan Glacier Soundscapes project, during which she traveled along the Ganges River with a glaciologist and research team &quot;recording the sounds of glacial recession.&quot;
Ibarra received a 2010 TED Fellowship, a 2010 New York Foundation for the Arts fellowship for music composition, and a 2008 Asian Cultural Council Rockefeller fellowship. The Asia Society nominated her as a delegate of Asia 21 Young World Leaders Summit Unity Through Diversity in Jakarta in 2010.

== Mundo Niños==
With Cuban-Composer Roberto Juan Rodriguez, Ibarra co-founded Mundo Niños, a children&#x27;s group that performs and teaches music in multi-languages to disabled, indigenous, and orphaned children.

== Musical works as composer and performer ==

In 2004, Ibarra recorded &quot;Folkloriko&quot;, a cycle of 11 pieces dedicated to a day in the life of a Filipino migrant worker. The work was premiered at the Freer Gallery of Art of the Smithsonian Institution in conjunction with the first Filipino photography exhibit by Ricardo Alvarado. Recorded on Tzadik Records and performed by Jennifer Choi (violin), Craig Taborn (piano), Wadada Leo Smith (trumpet) and Ibarra (drums and percussion).

In 2006 Ibarra released, &quot;Dialects&quot; by Electric Kulintang on Plastic Records, a duo collaboration with Roberto Juan Rodriguez with compositions featuring electronics, kulintang gongs, percussion, drums and field recordings.

In 2007, American Composers Orchestra commissioned &quot;Pintados Dream/The Painted’s Dream&quot;, a drum concerto with Ibarra soloing, a chamber orchestra and visual art by Makoto Fujimura which world premiered at Carnegie Zankel Hall in October of that year.

In February 2007 she composed for a commission by Ars Nova Workshop in Philadelphia, &quot;Kit: Music for Four Pianists&quot;, eight-hand piano, in an evening work of Ibarra&#x27;s percussion music.

Also in 2007, her solo CD, &quot;Drum Sketches&quot;, was commissioned by The Brecht Forum and American Composers Forum on Innova Recordings. These solo pieces are performed and recorded by Ibarra on drum kit, sarunay and kulintang (Philippine xylophone and eight rowed gongs), also including field recordings. They are sonic sketches of Ibarra&#x27;s sound that include both traditional and avant-garde musical idioms.

In August 2008, MoMa Summergarden and Jazz at Lincoln Center commissioned Ibarra for a premiere of &quot;Summer Fantasy and Folklore&quot; at the MoMa Summergarden. Ibarra premiered the suite inspired by summers in Houston, New York and Manila with the debut of her quartet featuring Jennifer Choi (violin), Kathleen Supove (piano), Bridget Kibbey (harp) and Susie Ibarra (drumset and percussion).

Also in 2008, Ibarra composed and recorded the music for video installation art, &quot;Madre Selva: Homage to Ana Mendieta&quot;, created by Visual Artist and Guggenheim Fellow, Juan Sanchez for his exhibition at Lehigh University&#x27;s Zoellner Arts Center, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The art work is a tribute to the late Cuban American sculptor, installation and performance artist, Ana Mendieta.

In 2010 Music Theatre Group produced two residencies of &quot;Saturnalia&quot;, a new music theatre work, composed by Ibarra, written by Yusef Komunyakaa, directed by Daniel Fish and music directed by John diPinto. The new music work features 10 actor/singers, the Young Peoples Chorus of NYC, and a chamber ensemble. &quot;Saturnalia&quot; is a bicultural musical theatre work sung in English and Thai. The story is set in Thailand and portrays the illusion of Paradise that masks a psychological warfare in the minds of US soldiers, and business men and women enslaved in sex trafficking.

<doc id="1253436" wikidata="Q803672" url="?curid=1253436" title="Bahuchara Mata">
<text>Bahuchara Mata (; ) is a Hindu goddess of chastity and fertility in her maiden aspect, of the incarnation of the Hinglaj. The goddess grants favours, especially to male children, and cures diseases. Like other divinities in Gujarat and Rajasthan, Bahuchara is of Charan origin. She is also considered the patroness of the hijra community. Her primary temple is located in Becharaji town in Mehsana district of Gujarat, India.

== History and legends ==
Bahuchara was born in the Detha clan of Maru-Charanas in Ujala (Ujlan) village in present-day Jaisalmer district. Her father was Bapaldan Detha of Kharoda (Umerkot) while her mother Deval was from Ujlan. As per Gadhavi Samarthdan Mahiya, she lived around 1309 CE. Bahuchara was one of the eight sisters, thus named: Bahucarā, Būṭa, Balāla, Vīru, Hīru, Rāmeśvarī, Khetū, Pātū. Her mother Deval is herself considered a &quot;sagat&quot; and worshipped as a patron goddess by Detha Charanas and Sodha Rajputs.

Her father Bapaldan was a renowned poet who obtained a jagir in sasan in Saurashtra and founded Bapalka. After Deval&#x27;s passing in Kharoda, he sent his servants to bring Bahuchara, But, and Balal. While on the way, their caravan was attacked by Bapiya, a koli bandit, at Shankhalpur or Shakatpur in the Chunval region. Enraged at the attack, Bahuchara and her sisters proceeded to commit &quot;trāgā&quot;, a Chāraṇa practice of suicide by ritual mutilation, and thus cursing Bapiya to lose his manhood and become a eunuch. Bapiya begged to be forgiven, but the curse enacted through &quot;trāgā&quot; could not be undone. He went down on his knees and said beseechingly, &quot;It was not my fault. I lived out of robbery, but I never targeted Brahman and Chāraṇa. I unfortunately happened to target Chāraṇa’s carriage without knowing it.&quot;

Showing mercy, Bahuchara ordered him to build a shrine to her and worship her at the place, and proclaimed if a &quot;naturally emasculated man&quot; wearing women&#x27;s clothing worships her, then they would achieve her blessings and find a place in her abode after death. Bapiya built her shrine under a &quot;varakhada&quot; tree in Shankhalpur. Thus, Bahuchara came to be worshipped in the Chunwal town, now known as Becharaji; Būta-Bhavānī at Arnej, near Kot; and Balāla Devī at Bakulkoo, near Sihor.

== Temple ritualists ==
The ritual responsibilities at the shrine were divided among three groups, i.e. the Solanki Rajput landholders from the nearby village of Kalri, a Muslim group called the &quot;Kamalias&quot;, and the hijras (eunuchs) or &quot;Paviyas&quot;. A portion of the temple funds were distributed to these three types of traditional temple servants. Historically, a Rajput officiated over the rituals of the temple, whereafter in 1859, Sayajirao Gaekwad of Baroda appointed a southern Brahmin for the first time displacing the Rajput officiants. The primary followers of the goddess are traditionally Rajputs, Kolis, Charanas, Bhils, and Hijras. Bahuchara was the patron deity of Solanki rulers. Historically, animal sacrifices was performed at the shrine by Bhils, Kamaliyas, etc. The sacrifice held annually on Ashvin Vad 14 was described thus: &quot;The Kamalias used to bring the buffalo in front of the temple to a stone altar ... Kumkum was applied to the forehead of the sacrificial beast and it was worshipped with flowers. A white cloth was spread over the back of the beast and a garland of flowers from the &quot;angi&quot; of the goddess was put around its neck. A lamp filled from one of those burning day and night near the goddess was brought and placed on a stone in the chowk. The buffalo was then let loose and if it smelt the lamp, it was considered to be acceptable to the goddess, and was at once slain, if possible at one stroke of the sword by one of the Kolis of the temple villages. A blood-tipped flower was presented to the deity and the bystanders applied blood to their foreheads.&quot;

=== Solanki ===
The seventeenth century bhavai episodic text &quot;&#x27;Becharaji vesha&quot;&#x27; describes a legend. The story involves Solanki king of Kalri and the Cavada king of Patan who were close friends and who plan to have their children marry, but both end up having daughters. The Kalri king&#x27;s daughter is not announced, and during the wedding, she runs away on her mare. She stopped by a pond and then took a dip, and by goddess Bahuchara’s blessing, was transformed into a man and was able to fulfill her marital and Rajput duties. This saved the Solankis of Kalri from humiliation and they become loyal devotees of the shrine.

=== Kamaliya ===
The Kamalias, dressed partly as women and partaking partly of Muslim life-rituals, were crucial to the service of the goddess. They would serve as musicians and servants to the goddess. They were also been seen as her staunchest servants. The group claims their right as caretakers of the Mother-Goddess at a temple. They were formerly renouncers and had an authorized position in the temple for revenue management. The exclusive right system called ijara continued until 1954 when it was abolished. Kamāliyas used to visit several villages once a year to receive part of the harvest.

=== Paviya (Hijras) ===
&quot;Paviya&quot; is Gujarati word for Hijras. The Bahucharā Mātā narrative explains the genesis of Bahucharā Mātā and hijras’ devotion. Becoming a hijra is a consequence of the curse of the Mother-Goddess. Candidates hoping to become hijras often appear at the temple and are recruited after discussions with senior members. The hijras continue to wear special outfits and are always present within the temple grounds. Although they are not officially recognized as priests at the temple, Hijras play an important role in passing on the grace or āśīrvād of Mother-Goddess at the temple.

=== Changes in Gaikwad rule ===
In 1721, Pilajirao Gaekwad conquered eastern Gujarat, including Baroda. The Gaekwads kept their territories after concluding a treaty with the East India Company. However, both before and after the Gaekwad conquest, local land control was in the hands of powerful landholders or garasiyas including Kolis, Solankis and Thakardas. The Gaekwads granted villages for shrine maintenance in the mid-eighteenth century. Manajirao built a temple in the 1770s after being cured by the goddess. Subsequently, the Gaekwads became closely involved in site administration. In 1859, Sayajirao Gaekwad of Baroda appointed a southern Brahmin, Narayanarao Madhav, to conduct temple rituals instead of a Rajput. This marked the first time Brahmins led the temple ritual. Six Brahmins served the goddess, and twenty one other temple servants of different castes were also retained.

While the main worshippers of goddess were non-Brahmin groups, literature used by the temple in modern times is mostly written by Brahmins. Their accounts show discomfort with historical shrine practices despite acknowledging its power. One such author wrote a history of Bahuchara in 1919, attempting to associate the goddess with the story of Krishna, citing a verse purportedly from the Bhagavata Purana to suggest that the goddess was the infant born to Yashoda who was exchanged for Krishna. He also asserted that mention of the goddess can be found in other texts such as the Devi Bhagavata and the Veda. However, he also relates that the first shrine on the site was built by local pastoralists:Where Bahuchara’s temple now stands used to be a jungle, in which a mahant (religious mendicant or priest) lived. Cowherds (bharvad ane Rabario) grazed their cattle there. They would come to the mahant to smoke with him and sing songs praising the goddess (devi bhajano). They built a small brick temple there.The narrative of Bahucharā Mātā elucidates the genesis of Bahucharā Mātā and hijras’ devotion to her. Moreover, it explains that becoming a hijra is a consequence of the curse of the Mother-Goddess. This narrative is well-known among locals, but not among the temple administrators and official priests who are outsiders. They usually avoid mingling with locals, who lost hereditary authority over temple management.

== Depiction and symbols ==

Bahuchara Mata is shown as a woman who carries a sword on her bottom left, a text of scriptures on her top left, the abhayamudra (&quot;showering of blessings&quot;) on her bottom right, and a trident on her top right. She is seated on a rooster, which symbolizes innocence. This iconography symbolizes a balance between violence (sword), creation trinities (trishul), knowledge (Shri scripture), and blessing (abhay hasta mudra) in Bahuchara Mata&#x27;s mythology. The sword signifies her self-sacrifice, the trishul represents the balance of creation principles, and the scripture reinforces her legitimacy in the Charana caste. Moreover, the pseudo-divine status of the Charana community meant that Bahuchara’s curse was legitimized by virtue of her being a Charani and not only, in fact, because she was a Goddess.

==Temple==

Bahucharaji Temple is located in Bahucharaji town in Mehsana district of Gujarat, India. It is 82 km from Ahmedabad and 35 km west of Mahesana. According to the Bombay Gazetteer, the original shrine was built by a king called Sankhal Raj in 1152 CE and the first surviving mention of the shrine was found in an inscription dating 1280 CE. No major changes were made in the temple architecture until the eighteenth century.

There are three shrines of the Goddess within the temple complex. The oldest part of the shrine complex termed &#x27;Adyasthan&#x27; (the original site) is a small temple enclosing a sprawling, small-leafed varakhadi tree, believed to be the site where the goddess first appeared. Adjoining this is another small temple, the madhya sthan (second or intermediate place), which houses an incised plaque representing the goddess and has a locked silver door at its entrance. This part of the temple is believed to have been built by a Maratha named Fadnavis (or an official with that title) in the eighteenth century. In 1779 CE, Manajirao Gaekwad, the younger brother of the Maratha ruler of Baroda, built a third structure close to the original shrine after the goddess cured him of a tumor. The third is the main temple today and contains the Bala Yantra of quartz crystal representing the Goddess. Saint Kapildev and Kalari king Tejpal have also contributed to the construction and renovation of the temple. The temple complex is beautifully decorated with stone carvings and wall paintings. Though less well known outside of Gujarat and Rajasthan, the temple is considered a minor Shakta pitha and every year about 1.5 million pilgrims visit this temple.

<doc id="1253437" wikidata="Q567881" url="?curid=1253437" title="Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter">
<text>The Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (; FSSP) is a traditionalist Catholic society of apostolic life for priests and seminarians. It is in communion with the Holy See. It was founded in 1988 by 12 former members of the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX) who left following the Écône consecrations, which resulted in the SSPX bishops being excommunicated by the Holy See.

Headquartered in Switzerland, the society maintains two international seminaries: the International Seminary of St. Peter in Wigratzbad-Opfenbach, Bavaria, Germany, and Our Lady of Guadalupe Seminary in Denton, Nebraska, United States. The society is officially recognized by the Holy See and has 368 priests who celebrate the Tridentine Mass in locations in 147 worldwide dioceses.

==Canonical status==
According to canon law, the FSSP is a clerical society of apostolic life of pontifical rite. It is not, therefore, an institute of consecrated life and members take no religious vows, but are instead bound by the same general laws of celibacy and obedience as diocesan clergy and, in addition, swear an oath as members of the society. The fraternity&#x27;s pontifical-rite status means that it has been established by the Pope and is answerable only to him in terms of its operation (through the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life; prior to January 17, 2019, through the Pontifical Commission &quot;Ecclesia Dei&quot;), rather than to local bishops. A local bishop still governs the fraternity&#x27;s work within his respective diocese. In this sense its organization and administrative reporting status are similar to those of religious orders of pontifical right (for example, the Jesuits or Dominicans).

On 28 September 2024, the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life informed the FSSP that it had opened an apostolic visitation. According to the Fraternity, this is intended to &quot;enable the Dicastery to know who we are, how we are doing and how we live, so as to provide us with any help we may need.&quot;

==Mission and charism==

The FSSP consists of priests and seminarians who intend to pursue the goal of Christian perfection according to a specific charism, which is to offer the Mass and other sacraments according to the Roman Rite as it existed before the liturgical reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council. Thus, the fraternity uses the Roman Missal, the Roman Breviary, the Pontifical (&quot;Pontificale Romanum&quot;), and the Roman Ritual in use in 1962, the last editions before the revisions that followed the Council.

The 2007 &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; had authorized use of the 1962 Roman Missal by all Latin Church priests as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite without limit when celebrating Mass &quot;without a congregation&quot;. Its use for Mass with a congregation was allowed with the permission of the priest in charge of a church for stable groups attached to this earlier form of the Roman Rite, provided that the priest using it was &quot;qualified to do so and not juridically impeded&quot; (as for instance by suspension). That was abrogated by the 2021 &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot; that emphasized deference towards the Mass of Paul VI and added restrictions to which clergy could perform the Roman Rite according to the pre-Vatican II form.

On 4 February 2022, two priests of the fraternity were received by Pope Francis in private audience, who subsequently issued a decree confirming that the FSSP could continue to celebrate the traditional liturgy publicly in their own churches or oratories, or anywhere else with the consent of the local ordinary. The decree was dated 11 February 2022, the Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes and coincidentally the same day that the FSSP consecrated themselves to the Immaculate Heart of Mary after a nine-day novena. On 29 February 2024, the Superior General of the FSSP, Fr. Andrzej Komorowski, was received in private audience by Pope Francis, who assured them that the FSSP would continue to enjoy the right to celebrate the traditional liturgy.

Following from its charism, the fraternity&#x27;s mission is twofold: to sanctify each priest through the exercise of his priestly function, and to deploy these priests to parishes. As such, they are to celebrate the sacraments, catechize, preach retreats, organize pilgrimages, and generally provide a full sacramental and cultural life for lay Catholics who are likewise drawn to the rituals of the 1962 missal. In order to help complete its mission, the fraternity has built its own seminaries with the goal of forming men to serve the fraternity.

==Founding==


The FSSP was established on July 18, 1988, at the Abbey of Hauterive, Switzerland, by twelve priests and twenty seminarians, led by Josef Bisig, all of whom had formerly belonged to Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre&#x27;s Society of Saint Pius X; they were unwilling to follow that movement into what the Congregation for Bishops and Pope John Paul II declared to be a schismatic act and grounds for excommunication &quot;latae sententiae&quot; due to the consecration of four bishops without a papal mandate. Fr. Josef Bisig became the fraternity&#x27;s first superior general.

==Organization==

, the fraternity included 569 members: 368 priests, 22 deacons, and 179 non-deacon seminarians in 146 dioceses spread among Australia, Austria, Benin, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Nigeria, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Switzerland, the United States, and Vietnam. The fraternity&#x27;s membership represents 35 nationalities, and the average age of its members is 39. , the lay Confraternity of Saint Peter had 9,546 members enrolled, who spiritually support the fraternity&#x27;s charism.

===Superiors general===
The FSSP&#x27;s current superior general is Fr. John Berg, who was elected to a third (non-consecutive) term as superior general on July 9, 2024. Former superiors general include:
* Fr. Josef Bisig (1988–2000)
* Fr. Arnaud Devillers (2000–2006)

* Our Lady of Guadalupe Seminary, in Denton, Nebraska, United States (Diocese of Lincoln), was established in 1994 and serves English-speaking seminarians. Its current rector is Fr. Josef Bisig.

Ezechiel House, a house of formation for first-year seminarians, exists in the city of Sydney, Australia. The Director of Ezechiel House is Fr. Duncan Wong.

In 2015, the fraternity established in Guadalajara, Mexico, Casa Cristo Rey, an apostolate which it plans to develop into a house of formation for first-year seminarians for native Spanish-speaking postulants. Presently, Casa Cristo Rey serves as a priestly discernment program for young men from Spain and Latin America. In 2016 Casa Cristo Rey opened the Junipero Serra Spanish Institute, a program offering six or eight weeks of Spanish immersion for priests and seminarians.

<doc id="1253440" wikidata="Q224733" url="?curid=1253440" title="Ariel (poetry collection)">
<text>Ariel is Sylvia Plath&#x27;s second collection of poetry. It was first released in 1965, two years after her death by suicide. The poems of &quot;Ariel&quot;, with their free-flowing images and characteristically menacing psychic landscapes, marked a dramatic turn from Plath&#x27;s earlier &quot;Colossus&quot; poems.

Ted Hughes, Plath&#x27;s widower and the editor of &quot;Ariel&quot;, made substantial changes to her intended plan for the collection by changing her ordering of the poems, dropping some pieces, and adding others. The first American edition was published in 1966 and included an introduction by the poet Robert Lowell. This was appropriate, since, in a BBC interview, Plath had cited Lowell&#x27;s book &quot;Life Studies&quot; as having had a profound influence over the poetry she was writing in the last phase of her writing career. In the same interview, Plath also cited the poet Anne Sexton as an important influence on her writing during that time, since Sexton was also exploring some of the same dark, taboo, personal subject matter that Plath was exploring in her writing.

In 2004, a new edition of &quot;Ariel&quot; was published which for the first time restored the selection and arrangement of the poems as Plath had left them. The 2004 edition also features a foreword by Frieda Hughes, the daughter of Plath and Hughes.

==Contents (1965 version)==
Poems marked with an * were not in Plath&#x27;s original manuscript, but were added by Ted Hughes. Most of them date from the last few weeks of Plath&#x27;s life.

==Contents (Manuscript version / Restored 2004 version)==
Poems marked with an ** were included in Plath&#x27;s original manuscript, but were removed by Ted Hughes. 

==Reception==
American poetry scholar Marjorie Perloff said in her article &quot;The Two Ariels: The (Re)making of the Sylvia Plath Canon&quot; that &quot;The fact remains that Plath herself had arranged the future &quot;Ariel&quot; poems &#x27;in a careful sequence,&#x27; plotting out every detail including the first and last words of the volume.&quot; Another critic remarked that &quot;her poetry would have been valuable no matter what she had written about&quot;. In 2016, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked &quot;Ariel&quot; as the 16th best nonfiction book of all time.

<doc id="1253441" wikidata="Q1634499" url="?curid=1253441" title="Rabbi Levi (crater)">
<text>Rabbi Levi is a lunar impact crater that is located among the rugged highlands in the southeastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. Several notable craters are located nearby, including Zagut just to the north-northwest, the heavily impacted Riccius to the southeast, and Lindenau to the northeast next to Zagut.

This is a heavily worn and eroded crater formation, with several smaller craters lying along the incised rim and across the interior floor. A group of these craters form a cluster in the western part of the floor, consisting of the satellite craters A, L, M, and D, as well as lesser craterlets trailing away to the south-southeast. The largest of these craters is Rabbi Levi L, a bowl-shaped formation just to the northwest of the midpoint. The remainder of the floor is relatively level and nearly featureless. Clusters of craters also lay across the eastern and southwestern sections of the rim.

Attached to the northeast is the remnant of an old formation that intrudes into Rabbi Levi, producing a straightened section of rim along that face. This unnamed formation has been almost completely obliterated, and is overlain in the northwest by Lindenau, and along the outer northeast side by Rothmann.

The crater is named after the Medieval French Jewish scholar Levi ben Gershon, better known by his Graecized name as Gersonides.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Rabbi Levi.

<text>Poland has 42 high-rise buildings that stand at least tall, being one of 17 countries in the world to have a supertall skyscraper (building that rises at least ).

The country&#x27;s first high-rises started to be constructed in Warsaw, Katowice, Wrocław and Łódź in the first half of the 20th century. The PAST Building was the first such building in Poland. Built in 1908, it was at that time the tallest residential building in Europe at , as well as one of the earliest reinforced concrete structures of this type in the continent. Other early high-rises include the Drapacz Chmur, in Katowice, and the Prudential, in Warsaw, which was in its completion in 1933 the tenth tallest building in Europe at .

At the beginning of the post-war period, the tall Palace of Culture and Science was built in the centre of Warsaw at the behest of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. At the time of its completion in 1955, it was the eighth tallest building in the world and the second tallest in Europe, retaining these positions until 1961 and 1990, respectively.

Poland saw a major increase in the number of high-rise buildings following its political transformation of 1989 and throughout the 21st century. Most of the country&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers are located in the Śródmieście and Wola districts of Warsaw. In Śródmieście, a cluster of skyscrapers is arranged around the centrally located Palace of Culture and Science. Since the 1970s the district&#x27;s urban planning has been designed in a way that counterpoints the skyline domination by the Palace.

The tallest building in Poland is currently the tall Varso Tower, in Warsaw, which is also the tallest building in the European Union and the sixth tallest building in Europe.

<text>Tomato purée is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. The main difference between tomato paste, tomato purée, and tomato sauce is consistency; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce.

==Differences==
The definitions of tomato purée vary from country to country. In the US, tomato purée is a processed food product, usually consisting of only tomatoes, but can also be found in the seasoned form. It differs from tomato sauce or tomato paste in consistency and content; tomato purée generally lacks the additives common to a complete tomato sauce and does not have the thickness of paste.

The standard consistency of tomato puree is more than or equal to 7% but less than 24% natural total soluble solids.
 is an uncooked tomato purée, strained of seeds and skins. derives from the Italian verb , meaning &#x27;to go through&#x27;.

<doc id="1253459" wikidata="Q7562144" url="?curid=1253459" title="Sono Osato">
<text>was an American dancer and actress.

==Early life==
Osato was born in Omaha, Nebraska. She was the oldest of three children of a Japanese father (Shoji Osato, 1885–1955) and a Canadian mother of French-Irish origin (Frances Fitzpatrick, 1897–1954). Her family moved to Chicago in 1925 in order to be closer to Frances&#x27; family, and Shoji opened a photography studio there. In 1927, when she was eight, Osato&#x27;s mother took her and her sister to Europe for two years; while in Monte Carlo, they attended a performance of &quot;Cléopâtre&quot; by Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s famous Ballets Russes company, which inspired Osato to start ballet classes when she returned to Chicago in late 1929. She studied with prominent dancers Berenice Holmes and Adolph Bolm.

==Career==
She performed with ballet companies Ballets Russe de Monte-Carlo and the American Ballet Theatre. As an actress, she starred alongside Frank Sinatra in the film &quot;The Kissing Bandit&quot;.

Osato began her career at the age of fourteen with Wassily de Basil&#x27;s Ballets Russe de Monte-Carlo, which at the time was the world&#x27;s most well known ballet company; she was the youngest member of the troupe, their first American dancer and their first dancer of Japanese descent. De Basil tried to persuade Osato to change her name to a Russian name, but she refused to do so. She spent six years touring the United States, Europe, Australia and South America with the company, leaving in 1941 as she felt her career was stagnating. She went to study at the School of American Ballet in New York City for six months, then joined the American Ballet Theatre as a dancer. While at the ABT, she danced roles in such ballets as Kenneth MacMillan&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, Antony Tudor&#x27;s &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot;, and Bronislava Nijinska&#x27;s &quot;The Beloved&quot;.
As a musical theater performer, her Broadway credits included principal dancer in &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; (a performance for which she received a Donaldson Award in 1943), Ivy Smith in the original &quot;On the Town&quot;, and Cocaine Lil in &quot;Ballet Ballads&quot;.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Osato was encouraged to change her name to something more &quot;American&quot;, and for a short time she used her mother&#x27;s maiden name and performed as Sono Fitzpatrick. At around the same time, her father was arrested and detained in Chicago under the United States government&#x27;s Japanese American Internment policy. In 1942, when the Ballet Theatre toured Mexico, Osato was unable to join the tour as Japanese Americans were barred from leaving the country, and she had several months without work. She was also unable to perform in California and other parts of the western United States when the company toured there later in the same year, as these states were deemed military areas and were off-limits for people of Japanese descent.

In the late 1940s and 1950s, Osato briefly pursued a career as an actress, appearing on Broadway in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, in the film &quot;The Kissing Bandit&quot; with Frank Sinatra, and in occasional guest appearances on television series such as, &quot;The Adventures of Ellery Queen&quot; (1950).

In 1980, Osato published an autobiography titled &quot;Distant Dances&quot;. In 2006, she founded the Sono Osato Scholarship Program in Graduate Studies at Career Transition For Dancers to help former dancers finance graduate work in both the professions and the liberal arts. In 2016, Thodos Dance Company in Chicago presented a dance production based on her life, titled &quot;Sono&#x27;s Journey&quot;.

==Personal life==
Osato married real estate developer Victor Elmaleh in 1943, and they had two sons. Elmaleh died in November 2014, aged 95.

Osato died at her home in Manhattan on December 26, 2018, at the age of 99. She was the aunt of the installation artist of the same name, Sono Osato.

<text>El Centro de la Raza in Seattle, Washington, United States, is an educational, cultural, and social service agency, centered in the Latino/Chicano community and headquartered in the former Beacon Hill Elementary School on Seattle&#x27;s Beacon Hill. It was founded in 1972 and continues to serve clients in Seattle, King County and beyond. It is considered a significant part of civil rights history in the Pacific Northwest.

==History==
In the early 1960s thousands of Latinos in Seattle, nearly all of whom were seeking employment, found themselves lacking a traditional community center: a &quot;barrio&quot;, with a Latin American-style plaza. In early 1972, the ESL Program at South Seattle Community College suddenly found themselves without a physical home. Inspired by the 1970 occupation by Native Americans of the decommissioned Fort Lawton in Seattle&#x27;s Magnolia neighborhood, which resulted in the founding of the Daybreak Star Cultural Center, members of the ESL program occupied an empty school building originally built in 1904 in Seattle&#x27;s Beacon Hill neighborhood that had been closed due to declining student enrollment. On October 11, 1972 the group established itself as El Centro de la Raza.

Leaders of the building takeover quickly won a pledge from Seattle Public Schools superintendent Forbes Bottomly that no effort would be made to evict them by force. The school district even arranged to open a back door for fire safety. The school had a sprinkler system, but its water long had been cut off. After three months of occupying the building and numerous rallies, petitions and letters, the Seattle City Council agreed to hear their case. At one point, pressing for an audience, supporters of the occupation had laid siege to the City Council&#x27;s chambers. The people who occupied the building joked that they were simply implementing advice from Washington governor Dan Evans, &quot;advocating use of empty schools for community needs, such as child care&quot;. The City Council finally approved the lease, but mayor Wes Uhlman vetoed the action. Supporters then occupied the mayor&#x27;s office and were arrested. An accord was finally reached with a five-year lease signed January 20, 1973 at $1 rent annually.

Cofounder Roberto Maestas, executive director until 2009, worked with community leaders Larry Gossett, Bob Santos, and Bernie Whitebear, also known as the Gang of Four as they established a unique ethnic alliance that lead to the founding of El Centro de la Raza.

More than 20 years later, Maestas would remark, &quot;I found that the only way to get things done in this city is to do it -- and then work it out... It took five to six years for the building to become up to code. Everything had to be repaired, replaced or installed. With the help, love and dedication of the community, the organization&#x27;s building was refurbished piece by piece. Money was donated. Grants were awarded. Materials were donated, as well. Laborers volunteered time. Plumbers gave services. Heating and plumbing were installed. The roof was fixed. Vinyl siding was put in place. The classrooms were spruced up.&quot;

In 2007, El Centro celebrated its 35th anniversary with a gathering of nearly 1,000 people at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle.

== Social activism ==
During the early 1980s, when the Reagan Administration was supporting the Nicaraguan Contras, El Centro played a major role in convincing the Seattle City Council to adopt Managua as a sister city, despite strong initial opposition from Seattle City Council. El Centro&#x27;s bond with Nicaragua was forged before the Sandinistas took power in 1979. The relationship between El Centro and Managua began following the 1972 Nicaragua Earthquake and El Centro was able to coordinate relief efforts in the Seattle area.

The organization continued to practice direct action. When the Washington Natural Gas Company cut off El Centro&#x27;s heat, the teachers and children of the child-development center sat in the office of the CEO of Washington Natural Gas until the gas was restored.

==Affordable housing==

In 2015 El Centro de la Raza built moderately priced apartments south of its main building – 110 units, home to about 350 people. These apartments are designed for families making 30-60 per cent of the average median annual income in Seattle, or $24,000 to $49,000. The apartments have been built within easy access to El Centro de Raza and the Beacon Hill Light Rail station

<doc id="1253462" wikidata="Q3966175" url="?curid=1253462" title="Election Night Special">
<text>&quot;Election Night Special&quot; is a Monty Python sketch parodying the coverage of United Kingdom general elections, specifically the 1970 general election, on the BBC by including hectic (and downright silly) actions by the media and a range of ridiculous candidates.

This sketch was featured in Episode 19 of the &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; TV series, first broadcast on 3 November 1970. A somewhat different version of the sketch (leading into &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;) was also featured on the &quot;Monty Python Live at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane&quot; album. A longer edit of the &quot;Drury Lane&quot; version also appeared on the promotional flexidisc &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Tiny Black Round Thing&quot;. The sketch also provides the basis for an item in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book&quot; in the form of a mock pamphlet for the Silly Party, which alongside characters from the original sketch, also names both Paul Fox and Ian MacNaughton as Silly Party candidates.

Throughout the sketch, the linkman (John Cleese) and other commentators appear in a fixed sequence, either giving variations on their original statement or simply repeating it, as results are coming in from various constituencies. The election is mainly contested by two major parties, the &quot;Sensible Party&quot; and the &quot;Silly Party&quot;, though third-party candidates (a candidate for the &quot;Slightly Silly Party&quot; and a &quot;Very Silly&quot; Independent candidate) make appearances.

==Candidates and their vote totals==
The sketch focuses on election results from the following three constituencies:

At the end of the sketch, further results are given in short:
*Engelbert Humperdinck gains Barrow in Furness from Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip.
*Arthur Negus has held Bristols. &quot;That&#x27;s not a result, that&#x27;s a bit of gossip.&quot; (&quot;Bristols&quot; is rhyming slang for &#x27;breasts&#x27;: Bristol City = titty.)
*Mary Whitehouse taking (in reaction to the previous &quot;held Bristols&quot;).
*Wales isn&#x27;t swinging at all, which is &quot;no surprise&quot;.
*Monty Python holds the Credits.

The &quot;Drury Lane&quot; version gives a different set of results:
* A little pink pussycat gains Barrow in Furness, &quot;a gain from the Liberals, there&quot;.
* Rastus Odinga-Odinga has taken Wolverhampton South West; &quot;That&#x27;s Enoch Powell&#x27;s old constituency; an important gain for Darkie Power&quot;. 
*Arthur Negus has held Bristols. &quot;That&#x27;s not a result, that&#x27;s a bit of gossip.&quot; (see above)
* Sir Alec Douglas-Home has taken Oldham for the Stone-Dead Party.
* A small piece of putty about that big, a cheese mechanic from Dunbar, and two frogs (one called Kipper and the other one not) have all gone &quot;neep neep neep&quot; in Blackpool Central.

==Cultural references==

*The character Tarquin Fin-tim-lin-bin-whin-bim-lim-bus-stop-F&#x27;tang-F&#x27;tang-Olé-Biscuitbarrel seemingly made another appearance in the third season, episode twelve, of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; in the &quot;Spot the Looney&quot; sketch, although was not identified by name.
*In the 1981 Crosby by-election, candidate John Desmond Dougrez-Lewis, a 22-year-old student from Hayes in Greater London, changed his name by deed poll to &quot;Tarquin Fin-tim-lin-bin-whin-bim-lim-bus-stop-F&#x27;tang-F&#x27;tang-Olé-Biscuitbarrel&quot;. Thus the name was printed on the ballot paper, although the Returning Officer simply referred to him as &quot;Tarquin Biscuitbarrel&quot;. He received 223 votes and finished fifth out of nine candidates. He later participated in the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, which has some conceptual similarities with the &quot;Silly Party&quot; mentioned in the sketch.
*Jeremy Fox stood as a candidate for the Silly Party in Dover in the 1979 British general election, as a protest against the National Front. Fox outpolled the National Front candidate by 642 votes to 378.
*The original sketch includes the line, &quot;What do you make of the nylon dog cardigan and plastic mule rest?&quot; These items had been mentioned in &quot;The Goon Show&quot; episode, &quot;Tales of Old Dartmoor&quot; fourteen years prior. The linkman&#x27;s question is answered by a person off-camera who yells, &quot;There&#x27;s no such thing!&quot; and the linkman says, &quot;Thank you Spike,&quot; apparently in acknowledgement to &quot;The Goon Show&quot; creator and star Spike Milligan.
*In &quot;Small Gods&quot; by Terry Pratchett, a god called P&#x27;tang P&#x27;tang, who resembles a giant newt, is worshipped by a small nation of marsh-dwelling nomads totalling fifty-one people. The Great God Om persuades him to help him halt a war.

<text>Neustadt an der Weinstraße (; ; ; ), formerly known as Neustadt an der Haardt, is a town in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. With 53,300 inhabitants , it is the largest town called &quot;Neustadt&quot;.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

The town itself lies in the western park of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region between the Haardt mountains, the eastern edge of the Palatinate Forest, and the western edge of the Upper Rhine Plain in the middle of the Palatinate wine region, an area that is around 10 km wide and 85 km long. The Speyerbach river flows through the town from west to east as does the Rehbach, which separates from the Speyerbach within the town at the &quot;Winzinger Wassergescheid&quot; before emptying into the River Rhine several kilometres further north than the Speyerbach.

The borough, with its incorporated parishes, measures from west to east and from north to south. Its highest point is at the Hohe Loog House at the top of the Hohe Loog mountain and its lowest is in the village of Geinsheim.
=== Municipal divisions ===

==== Town and town quarters ====
Over time the original town and its surrounding settlements, hamlets and farmsteads have grown together, blurring the original boundaries of the town. Today these have become the town quarters of Branchweilerhof in the southeast, the Hambacher Höhe to the southwest, the Afrikaviertel (so named because its streets are named after researchers into Africa) and the Schöntal to the west. These quarters do not have any particular privileges and are not legally incorporated districts, although some voting precinct borders match part of the boundaries.

The best-known quarter is Winzingen which was first recorded in 774 and thus much older than the &quot;Neustadt&quot; or &quot;new town&quot; founded in the early 13th century. It was a wine growing village that lay below the Speyerbach, i.e. to the east of the new settlement. In 1892 it was incorporated into the then &quot;Neustadt an der Haardt&quot;. Since then the town has grown beyond Winzingen to the east.
Inclusive all its incorporated subdistricts, Neustadt covers an area of 11,713.5 hectares. Of that, 5,020.0 ha is woodland, 2,216.0 ha are vineyards, 2,300.0 ha are used for other agricultural purposes, 1,607.0 is built up and 50.0 ha are industrial and retail areas.

==== Subdistricts ====

In 1969 the villages of Diedesfeld, Geinsheim, Gimmeldingen, Haardt, Hambach, Königsbach, Lachen-Speyerdorf and Mußbach were incorporated into the borough, followed in 1974 by Duttweiler. These villages lie between one and ten kilometres from the main town. They are legally constituted subdistricts, are known as &quot;Ortsteil&quot; and have a parish chair (&quot;Ortsvorsteher&quot;) to whom some of the functions of the former mayors have been transferred.

==== Population in 2012 ====
=== Neighbouring communities ===
Neustadt&#x27;s neighbouring municipalities running clockwise from the north are the small town of Deidesheim the municipalities of Ruppertsberg, Meckenheim, Haßloch and Maikammer, the small town of Lambrecht and the municipality of Lindenberg.

=== Climate ===

Neustadt has an equable climate, like that of the whole of Anterior Palatinate: warm summers (around ; lower curve of the climatic diagram) during which most of the precipitation falls, albeit the annual total of (upper curve) is quite low, and mild, yet drier winters. Annual precipitation figures are in the lower quartile of those recorded in Germany; only 12% of the monitoring stations of the German Weather Service register lower values . The driest month is March; the most rain falls in June, 1.7 times more than in March. However, they vary only slightly and are very evenly distributed throughout the year; only 3% of the weather stations register lower seasonal variations in precipitation.

However, this climate chart is from a weather station at in the subdistrict of Haardt above the town, which is 25 metres lower. So the values differ, with temperatures being a little lower and rainfall higher. The chart shows an annual average temperatures of to in the summer months dropping during the winter. Its annual precipitation measured .

== History ==
=== Chronological table===
=== Chronology ===
===Early history===
The oldest traces of settlement and archaeological finds indicate that Celts used to live in the area of the present town. They have left behind ringworks, clay pots, coins and weapons that date to the time around 150 B.C. The Romans probably took possession of the land around 20 A. D. Around 400 it was taken by the Alemanni who were superseded in turn around 500 A.D. by the Germanic Franks.

There are no precise details for the centuries after the end of Roman rule, but it is known that villages already existed before the actual town of &quot;Neustadt&quot; was founded: Winzingen, today a town quarter, was already mentioned in 774. The subdistricts of Mußbach, Lachen-Speyerdorf, Geinsheim, Duttweiler and Hambach are also considerably older than the main town. In general it is fair to say that the history of Neustadt is closely linked to that of the Palatinate region.

===Middle ages===
Just a few decades after its foundation in the early 13th century, Neustadt was granted town rights on 6 April 1275 based on those given to Speyer.
====Town quarters====
In the Late Middle Ages Neustadt was divided into four town quarters, whose names indicate the status and occupations of their inhabitants or give important local information:

In the &quot;Lauerviertel&quot; (from &quot;Loheviertel&quot; = &quot;Tanbark Quarter&quot;) next to the Speyerbach worked the tanners. The &quot;Kesselringviertel&quot; was named after an influential family of the 14th century. In the &quot;Frauenviertel&quot; (&quot;Women&#x27;s Quarter&quot;) were ecclesiastical possessions under the patronage of Saint Mary&#x27;s. The Jewish community lived in the &quot;Judenviertel&quot; (&quot;Jewish Quarter&quot;).

Towards the end of the 15th century, other quarters were established outside the town fortifications: the &quot;Stadtgasserviertel&quot;, the &quot;Kirschgartenviertel&quot; and the &quot;Ägyptenvorstadt&quot;.

===Reformation===
In the Peasants&#x27; Uprising, rebellious peasant bands entered the town unopposed on 6 May 1525.

During the Reformation, Louis the Pacific ruled the Palatinate until 1544 and strove for reconciliation. His 1538 religion edict allowed Lutherans to preach and take communion. Equally even-handed was his brother and successor, Frederick the Wise. Not until his successor were there strict Protestant rulers. When Frederick III died in 1576, he left a clause in his will that his Lutheran son, Louis VI should not inherit the &quot;Ämter&quot; of Kaiserslautern and Neustadt, but that they should go instead to his Calvinist brother, John Casimir.
In 1578, Count Palatine John Casimir founded the Neustadt College that was named after him, the Casimirianum, because his Lutheran brother, Louis had cleared the university in Heidelberg of Calvinists; John Casimir was active as an advocate of the reformed faith and offered the exiled professors and students asylum. When he moved to Heidelberg in 1583 in order to take over the regency for his still under-age son there after the death of the brother&#x27;s reign, Neustadt&#x27;s short time as a university seat ended.

===17th century===

Denominational disputes over the following century were no longer pursued purely by argument, but with weapons, and the Palatinate was invaded by one campaign after another. Neustadt was conquered six times during the Thirty Years&#x27; War; in 1622 by the Spaniards, in 1631 by Sweden, in 1635 by Imperial troops, in 1638 by troops of Duke Bernard of Weimar, in 1639 by the French under Field Marshal Henri II d&#x27;Orleans, Duke of Longueville and 1644 again by the French. After each occasion the occupying forces attempted to enforce their confession.

Unlike other Palatine towns, Neustadt survived the War of the Palatine Succession (1689–1697) almost unscathed.

===18th and 19th centuries===
In 1744 of the town population of 2,496, 1,676 were reformed, 620 were Roman Catholics and 200 were Lutherans. Jews were not included in these statistics.

In the 18th century the town lost its medieval appearance, because its militarily obsolete and superfluous town walls were demolished. When, in 1722, the state road to Mannheim, the new residence of the Elector had been built (today the B 38), in 1723 the northern town wall was pierced.

Following the seizure of the Left Bank of the Rhine during the French Revolution in 1797–98, Neustadt became just an insignificant administrative centre, the canton capital of the département of Donnersberg. Napoleon passed through the town on his retreat from Erfurt to Paris and its official celebrated his visit. When, five years later, parts of the emperor&#x27;s army, defeated near Leipzig, marched through the town the sentiment was, however, quite the opposite.

In 1815, Neustadt became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria until 1945, along with the rest of the Palatinate which was one of 8 Bavarian districts (Rhine District). As of 1837 the district was renamed as &quot;Pfalz&quot;. As a result of this resubordination, in 1818 the town became the seat of a &quot;Landkommissariat&quot; (called a &quot;Bezirksamt&quot; from 1862 and a &quot;Landkreis&quot; from 1939). In 1832 the Hambach Festival took place near the town. In 1847, Neustadt was connected to the railway network by the Palatine Ludwig Railway.

===20th century===
A Workers and Soldiers Council was established during the German Revolution of 1918. Three delegates were sent to see Kurt Eisner, the premier of newly founded People&#x27;s State of Bavaria. These delegates consisted of a member of the Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany, a member of the emergent German People&#x27;s Party and a third linked to the interests of the local wine trade. However, Eisner failed to take notice of their concerns and despite his subsequent assertion that the Pfalz was an integral part of Bavaria, this indifference helped fuel separatist sentiment in the area.

According to the Armistice Agreement the Pfalz region fell within the French zone during the occupation of the Rhineland. The Siamese Expeditionary Forces occupied Neustadt following the end of World War I.

In 1920 Neustadt, like six others in the Palatinate, separated from its &quot;Bezirksamt&quot; and became an independent town.

Neustadt&#x27;s role during the Nazi era began in 1927 when it became the seat of the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; for the Nazi Party. It retained this function &quot;de facto&quot; until 1945, although in 1939 Kaiserslautern was nominated as the &quot;Gauhauptstadt&quot; (&quot;capital of the Gau&quot;) and the state authorities, who were formed in 1940 from the Palatine and Saarland administrations in Speyer and Saarbrücken and were led by the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; in personal union, were also not based in Neustadt. The town was given the function of a normal Palatine seat of administration on 8 September 1945, In 1946 it became the seat of the Rhineland-Palatinate province (&quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot;) of the Palatinate.

On 7 June 1969 the hitherto independent municipalities of Geinsheim, Gimmeldingen, Haardt an der Weinstraße, Hambach an der Weinstraße, Königsbach an der Weinstraße, Lachen-Speyerdorf, Mussbach an der Weinstraße and Diedesfeld were incorporated into the town&#x27;s borough. On 16 March 1974 they were followed by Duttweiler.

=== Etymology ===
Officially abbreviated as &quot;Neustadt a. d. Weinstr&quot;., the name can be shortened as &quot;Neustadt/Weinstrasse&quot; (as on train departure and arrival boards) or &quot;Neustadt (Weinstrasse)&quot;. The name literally means &quot;new town on the wine route&quot;, as it lies on the German wine route (Deutsche Weinstrasse), in Rhineland-Palatinate, in Germany.
It is one of several dozen German and Austrian places called &quot;Neustadt&quot;. These &quot;new towns&quot; are typically differentiated by the rivers upon which they lie (e. g., Neustadt (Aisch)), the regions they are located in (e. g., Neustadt/Hessen) or, in this case, a peculiar distinctive feature – namely &quot;Weinstraße&quot; – &quot;Wine Route.&quot;

== Culture, nature and sights ==

=== Culture ===
The following venues are available for cultural events: the Saalbau as a theatre and concert hall, the restored Herrenhof Mußbach as a cultural centre, the open air stage in the grounds of Villa Böhm, the &quot;Kleinkunstbühne&quot;, &quot;die reblaus&quot; in the Catacombe Theatre, the &quot;Theater in der Kurve&quot; in Hambach and the historic Steinhäuser Hof as the home venue of &quot;Jazzclub NW&quot;.

=== Nature ===
Neustadt&#x27;s borough extends from the Rhine Plain into the Palatine Forest Nature Park, the largest contiguous forest region in Germany and part of the Palatine Forest-North Vosges Biosphere Reserve. There is a total of twelve nature reserves in the borough: Am Wolfsberg, Lochbusch-Königswiesen, Mußbacher Baggerweiher, Haardtrand–Am Häuselberg, Haardtrand–Berggewanne, Haardtrand–Am Wetterkreuz, Haardtrand–Im Erb, Haardtrand–Am Klausental, Haardtrand–Schloßberg, Haardtrand–Am Heidelberg, Haardtrand–Am Sonnenweg und Rehbachwiesen-Langwiesen.

=== Structures ===

Neustadt&#x27;s main attraction is its historic &quot;Altstadt&quot; or Old Town. Notable buildings include its 14th century collegiate church, the former university of Casimirianum and the &quot;Steinhäuser Hof&quot;. More recently the Elwetritsche Fountain by Gernot Rumpf and the murals by Werner Holz have been added.

Outside the residential areas there are palaces and castles: Hambach Castle, the Wolfsburg, Winzingen Castle, Haardt Castle and the rather more distant Spangenberg Castle above the Elmstein Valley. In the quarter of Hambacher Höhe, by the edge of the Haardt, lies the Abbey of the Sacred Heart.

The outlying villages also have their sights; for example Mußbach with its Old Church of St. John, the manor house, White House and Carl Theodor Hof; or Gimmeldingen with St. Nicholas&#x27; Church, the Mithras Shrine, the Old Castle and King Ludwig&#x27;s Pavilion.

=== Monuments ===

In Neustadt, the artist, Gunter Demnig, has laid 41 so-called &quot;Stolpersteine&quot;, metal paving stones, in memory of the Jewish victims of Nazism. The first &quot;Stolperstein&quot; was laid on 6 December 2002 in front of the Kurfürst Ruprecht Gymnasium in &quot;Landwehrstraße&quot; in memory of Karl Strauß, a former teacher at the school.

On 10 March 2013 the Justice Minister for Rhineland-Palatinate, Jochen Hartloff, and Neustadt&#x27;s Lord Mayor, Hans Georg Löffler, opened the memorial site to Nazi victims which had been established in the prison building of the old Turenne Barracks by a friends&#x27; association founded in 2009. Eighty years earlier, on 10 March 1933, the Nazis had established a concentration camp in the barracks for several months under the title of &quot;Schutzhaft- und Arbeitslager&quot; (&quot;Protective Detention and Labour Camp&quot;). About 500 men from over 80 Palatine municipalities were detained here who, due to their political or religious activities, had fallen foul of the authorities.

=== Museums ===
The town is home to the following museums: the town museum, Villa Böhm, the Otto Dill Museum, the Palatine Bible Museum, the &quot;Getreidekasten&quot; Vineyard Museum in the Herrenhof and the Neustadt/Weinstraße Railway Museum.

=== Regular events ===
Since 1949, as part of the German Wine Festival, the German Wine Queen has been chosen and crowned in Neustadt. The high point of the festival, which traditionally takes place at the end of September/beginning of October, is the largest Vintners&#x27; Parade in Germany.

Other wine festivals take place regularly, usually at weekends from almond blossom time in March/April until October. Especially well known are the Gimmeldingen Almond Blossom Festival, the &quot;Eselshautfest&quot; in Mußbach and the &quot;Andergasser Fest&quot; in Hambach.

At the end of August the German Wine Road Adventure Day takes place, when the German Wine Road is closed to motorised traffic – even in Neustadt – and is only open to cyclists and pedestrians.

There&#x27;s also a Christmas festival at the Marktplatz square in the Altstadt. A large Christmas tree is usually put on the north side of the square.

=== Patronage ===
Neustadt was the patron of the U-boat U 26 in the German Bundesmarine. Since 1978 it has sponsored a Lufthansa Airbus and, since 2000, ICE train of the Deutsche Bahn. In March 2007 it took on the sponsorship of a train on the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn.

== Economy ==
The largest local employer is &quot;BASF&quot;, located in Ludwigshafen am Rhein – one of the largest chemical companies in the world.

== Symbols ==
The symbols of &quot;Neustadt&quot; are &quot;Elwedritsche&quot;, mythical animals of local folklore. Depictions of them are carved on a well in the town centre.

== Transport ==
Neustadt is less than an hour away from larger cities such as Mannheim, Ludwigshafen, Heidelberg and Frankfurt.

<text>Donald Grey Pierson (October 11, 1925 – March 30, 1996) was an American businessman and civic leader in Eastland, Texas. He founded the British pirate stations Wonderful Radio London, Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio during the 1960s. He also attempted to create free ports on the islands of Tortuga, Haiti and Dominica during the 1970s.

==Brief biography==

===Early life===
After graduating from Abilene High School in 1943, Pierson attended the University of Texas at Austin. He served as a gunnery instructor in the US Army Air Forces prior to the end of World War II. After the War, he continued his education at Baptist-affiliated Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene while he also worked as an automobile salesman.

===Business interests===
In 1948, he married the former Francis Annette Grubbs and, at the age of 21, acquired his first car dealership, a Dodge-Plymouth agency in Comanche. After opening his second dealership in 1953 for Oldsmobile-Cadillac in Eastland, he went on to establish a number of other automobile dealerships in Texas selling such makes as Volkswagen, Hillman, Renault, Triumph, Jaguar, Porsche, and BMW.

Don Pierson&#x27;s other business ventures included a department store, a bowling facility, cable television, restaurants, oil investments, home banking, a slot car raceway, and farming and ranching operations. In 1963, he established U.S. Telephonics, the world&#x27;s first computer telemarketing company and together, with a number of Abilene business leaders, he founded the Abilene National Bank (now Bank One - Abilene) in 1964 and served as the chairman of the board of the bank.

===Mayor of Eastland===
Although he was a soft-spoken individual, Pierson was also an untiring booster of his adopted hometown of Eastland. In 1957, he reopened the long-closed grass-strip Eastland airport which he renamed &quot;Eastland International Airport.&quot; Later, in the 1970s, he became the first person to land a jet aircraft in Eastland.

He attracted world headlines when, as mayor of Eastland in 1964, he convinced his fellow council members to pass a purported ordinance banning all smoking in Eastland, with a mandatory three-year jail penalty for violators. It was intended as a humorous response to the Surgeon General&quot;&#x27;s Commission on Smoking&quot;, whose recently issued report on the dangers of smoking had been accompanied by an official photo showing the commissioners&#x27; ashtrays overflowing with cigarette butts. The Eastland anti-smoking ordinance proved prophetic, although, at the time, it generated a deluge of hate mail from the outraged citizens of Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Soon after, Eastland again found itself in the headlines when, as president of the local Rotary Club, and at the height of the Cold War, Pierson managed to convince the Deputy Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Vladimir Alkimov, to appear as the featured speaker at the club&#x27;s weekly meeting.

===Pirate radio===
In 1964, his interests took him to the UK, after reading &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;. The newspaper carried a report of the start-up of Radio Caroline and Radio Atlanta from ships at that time anchored off the coastline of Southeast England.

In a 1984 interview, Pierson said he was captivated by the fact that these two offshore stations were the first and only all-day commercial radio broadcasters serving the UK. Pierson compared this with the number of stations then serving the population of his native Northwest Texas and realized that a UK radio operation could generate a lot of money. He caught the next available &quot;red eye&quot; flight to London from Dallas Love Field. On arriving, he chartered a small plane and flew over the two existing radio ships in the North Sea. After taking some photographs, he returned to Texas determined to create a station bigger and better than either of them.

The result was Radio London, which started transmitting on December 16, 1964, from the &quot;MV Galaxy&quot;, a former World War II United States Navy US Minesweeper. Radio London stopped transmitting August 14, 1967, when the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act came into effect in the United Kingdom. This law made it a criminal offence for any person to supply music, commentary, advertising, fuel, food, water or any other assistance (except for life-saving purposes) to any ship, offshore structure or aircraft used for broadcasting without a licence.

Between May 3, 1966, and November 13, 1966, Pierson ran radio stations Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio from the MV &quot;Olga Patricia&quot; (later renamed MV &quot;Laissez Faire&quot;), a World War II vessel built in the US as a supply ship. The two stations shared a studio and transmitter.

In the years that followed Don Pierson attempted to launch three more offshore radio station ventures. The first was off the coast of New York using the ship that had been the former home of &quot;Swinging Radio England&quot; and &quot;Britain Radio&quot; but under the call sign of &quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot;. He then engaged in plans to use a new ship as the home of &quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot; which would broadcast from off the coast of California.

Don Pierson re-entered the world of broadcasting during 1981 when he founded radio station KVMX-FM close to his home in Eastland, Texas. One of the local programs added to the station was the &quot;Wonderful Radio London Top 40 Show&quot; which by 1983 had evolved into a new company called Wonderful Radio London International with the intention of restarting the offshore station of the 1960s from a new ship off anchored once again off the coast of England. Although this plan failed to develop, a small syndicated programming network was formed using that name over XERF, KXOL in Fort Worth, Texas and KVMX.

===Haitian Freeport===
In 1967, during the time that Don Pierson was attempting to lease the ship which had been the former homes of &quot;Swinging Radio England&quot; and &quot;Britain Radio&quot;, he received a response from the Ambassador for Haiti in Washington, DC. Don Pierson&#x27;s original plan was to lease or sell the ship to the government of Haiti for it to establish two powerful 50 kW commercial radio stations aimed at American tourists visiting the old buccaneer stronghold of Tortuga island, which is located some 10 miles off the north coast of the main Haitian island of Hispaniola which is also shared by the Dominican Republic.

This offer became a plan to develop the island itself as a freeport and he was asked to assist the government of Haiti to encourage business investment in that poverty-stricken land. After years of research and negotiation, Don Pierson&#x27;s idea of a privately financed, privately managed free enterprise zone became a reality in 1971 when Haitian dictator François Duvalier (known as &quot;Papa Doc&quot;) and the Haitian government entered into a 99-year contract with Don Pierson&#x27;s company called Dupont Caribbean Inc. This contract provided for the establishment of Freeport Tortuga.

Within 18 months Don Pierson succeeded in building the island&#x27;s first airport, a loading dock for seagoing vessels, a rudimentary water and sewer system, an electricity generating facility, and six miles of paved road. Of equal importance. the project created jobs for some 400 previously unemployed Haitians and resulted in the establishment of a small school to teach various job skills. During this period he also became Honorary Consul of the Republic of Haiti to Texas from 1969 through 1974.

Tragically, the free port project came to abrupt end in 1974 when, after it was announced that Gulf Oil Corporation was contemplating investing more than $300 million to build a resort on the island, the government of Jean-Claude Duvalier (known as &quot;Baby Doc&quot;), summarily expropriated the project, resulting in its collapse.

A similar venture on the island of Dominica which was attempted in the wake of the failed project in Haiti, also met with disaster following governmental turmoil in Dominica.

==Pierson family==
In his personal and private life Don Pierson was a longtime member of the First Presbyterian Church of Eastland. He was preceded in death by his parents, Ryce and Hazel Pierson, and his brother Ryce Pierson Jr. and survived by his wife Annette; his sisters, his son, his daughter, and two grandchildren.

<text>Taylor is a lunar impact crater that is located to the south-southwest of Delambre. To the east is the smaller crater Alfraganus, and southeast of Taylor is Zöllner. It was named in honour of British mathematician Brook Taylor.

The worn outer rim of Taylor is elongated in the north–south direction, giving it an elliptical appearance. There is a break in the northern wall that forms a narrow valley, and the southern rim is relatively low compared to the peak rim heights along the eastern and western sides. The small satellite crater Taylor E is attached to the exterior of the southeastern rim. There is a central ridge at the midpoint that is slightly elongated in the north–south direction.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Taylor.

<doc id="1253470" wikidata="Q467062" url="?curid=1253470" title="Judah Leon Abravanel">
<text>Judah Leon Abravanel or Abrabanel () (c. 1460 Lisbon – c. 1530? Naples?), otherwise known by the pen name of Leo the Hebrew (in Latin: &quot;Leo Hebraeus&quot;; in Portuguese: &quot;Leão Hebreu&quot;; in Italian: &quot;Leone Ebreo&quot;; in Spanish: &quot;León Hebreo&quot;; in French: &quot;León l&#x27;Hebreu&quot;), was a Portuguese–Jewish philosopher, physician, and poet. His work &quot;Dialogues of Love&quot; was one of the most important philosophical works of his time.

==Biography==
The Abravanel (or Abrabanel) family was extraordinarily prominent among Jewish families in the Middle Ages, active in public service in the court of Castile. Judah (or Leon, as he is known in Spanish) was the son of Isaac ben Judah Abravanel (meaning Isaac “son of Judah” Abravanel) who, according to Soria was “the last great commentator of the Bible of Medieval Jewry” (12). Don Isaac was a statesman, financier, and a defender of the Jewish faith, who was also born in Lisbon in 1437 and spent most of his life in Portugal, eventually becoming a financial advisor to King Afonso V. However, in 1481 King Afonso V died and Don Isaac was suspected of conspiring to enthrone the Duke of Braganza, whom he had befriended earlier, over the son of Afonso, João II. Consequently, he had to flee without his family from Portugal to Seville, then Castile, finally settling in Toledo. Don Isaac eventually took refuge from his financial and political dealings in his other love—literature—while living with his family, with whom he was later reunited in Toledo.

Spain had recently seen the marriage of Isabel de Castilla and Fernando de Aragón, the Catholic Monarchs. Under their rule began the centralization of power in Spain, then fragmented by individual governance of its many regions. The monarchs desired to conquer the kingdom of Granada, which at that time was Muslim. Don Isaac Abravanel saw this as an opportunity and became a financier at the court. His son, Judah, joined him in service to the Catholic Monarchs in 1484 as personal doctor to the royal family.

The year 1492 brought a turbulent change to the Abravanel family and to all Jews in Spain, as Isabella and Ferdinand ordered the forced conversion or expulsion of all Jews in Spain. Don Isaac, in a desperate plea, threw himself at the feet of the Catholic Monarchs and begged them to revoke their decree, but to no avail. He made plans to move his family to Naples, Italy. To no avail he bribed King Ferdinand and even threatened Queen Isabella that the Jews were the eternal people and therefore could not be destroyed. A plot was hatched to kidnap Judah&#x27;s son as an attempt to persuade the Abravanel family to convert to Christianity and, ultimately, to remain in the service of the Catholic Monarchs. In an attempt to circumvent the plot, Judah sent his son to Portugal with a nurse, but by order of the king, the son was seized and baptized. This occurrence was a devastating insult to Judah and to his family, and was a source of bitterness throughout Judah&#x27;s life and the topic of his writings years later.

The Abravanel family chose exile over conversion, although it was not an easy choice, considering that there were not many places in Europe that Jews were welcomed and that living in exile required money, and the Jews were not allowed to take much with them. Originally intent on traveling to the Ottoman Empire, Don Isaac and his family settled in Naples. There, he became a financial advisor to the King of Naples, Ferrante, and his son Alfonso. The Abravanel family enjoyed a position of prestige in the court of Naples until 1494 when Charles VIII, king of France, invaded Naples. The Neapolitan royal family then fled to Sicily, accompanied by Don Isaac.

Judah, meanwhile, moved to Genoa, where he studied in an Italian humanist milieu and probably wrote the first two of his &quot;Dialoghi&quot;. There is evidence that he moved from Genoa to Barletta in 1501, where he became a servant of King Frederick of Naples, leaving in 1503 for Venice, where he rejoined his father Dom Isaac. Other sources say that he left Genoa for Naples in 1501 and remained there until 1506. While in Naples, Judah (apparently overlooking the injuries of the past) became the doctor of the Spanish viceroy, Don Gonsalvo of Cordoba, “The Great Captain.”

By 1506, the Neapolitan government was defeated, and Spain gained control of southern Italy. Judah left Naples for Venice, where he dedicated himself again to the study of philosophy until 1507. After this time, little is known about Judah&#x27;s life. His most famous work, &quot;Dialoghi d&#x27;amore&quot;, appears to have been written around 1501-02. In 1535, when his friend Mariano Lenzi discovered the manuscript and had it published in Rome, records indicate he had already died.

There are claims that Judah converted to Christianity at the end of his life; however, upon further investigation, these claims appear unfounded. One source states that allusions made to Saint John the Evangelist in the work indicate his Christian beliefs; however, the tendency of Jewish scholars to cite examples from both New Testament and the Classics was common during this time. However, the Venetian press that printed the second and third editions of his &quot;Dialoghi&quot; in 1541 and 1545 claimed on the first pages of the work that the author had converted to Christianity: “Dialoghi di Amore composti per Leone Medico, di Natione Hebreo, et di poi fatto Christiano” (Dialogues of Love, composed by Doctor Leon, of Hebrew heritage, and who later became Christian). This statement does not appear in the first edition, nor in later editions. Therefore, this “editorial note” was most likely included to promote the work and to persuade those who harbored hostilities against Jews at that time to purchase the book. Further evidence that Judah remained true to his Jewish faith can be found in &quot;Dialoghi&quot;, where Judah directly addresses his heritage and religion, stating that the book was written “according to Hebrew truth” and addresses “all of us who believe in the holy law of Moses.”

==Influences==
Through his travels, Judah was well-acquainted with many Italian humanists and with the Neapolitan Court. Some say he may have met Giovanni Pico della Mirandola while in Florence and composed for him a discourse on the “Harmony of the Skies.” If so, he also probably associated with Elia de Medigo, teacher of Pico della Mirandola, Yohanan Alemanno (a Jewish writer influenced by the Medici court and mysticism and author of &quot;Song of songs&quot;), Giovanni Pontano, Mario Equicola and monk Egidio da Viterbo.

Leon was surrounded by humanists interested in the topic of Love. The Chancellor of Florence, Marsilio Ficino commented on Plato’s &quot;Symposium&quot; (1474–75), while Girolamo Benivieni composed his &quot;Canzone d’amore&quot; (1486), which Pico della Mirandola analyzed soon after. Equicola’s &quot;Libro della natura d’amore&quot; (1495), Pietro Bembo’s &quot;Asolani&quot; and Francesco Cattani da Diacceto’s &quot;De amore&quot; were published while Judah was writing. Abravanel’s &quot;Dialoghi&quot; is regarded as the finest of these works. Menéndez Pelayo describes it as the most monumental work of Platonic philosophy since Plotinus&#x27;s &quot;Enneads&quot;. 

Similar to other humanist works, &quot;Dialoghi&quot; is strongly influenced by Plato and Aristotle. Menéndez Pelayo states that Abravanel employs Platonic ideals in his work, but filtered through his heritage. That is, his Neo-platonism derived from the Hispanic Jewish community, especially the works of Solomon ibn Gabirol and Maimonides. A disciple of these renowned Jewish scholars, Abravanel was also influenced by the Hellenic spirit of the Renaissance. Platonic notions of reaching towards a nearly impossible ideal of beauty, wisdom, and perfection encompass the whole of the work.

==&quot;Dialoghi d&#x27;amore&quot;==
The &quot;Dialoghi&quot; was an exceedingly popular book that enjoyed at least five editions in twenty years. First published in Italian, it was translated into French by Tyard, as well as into Hebrew and into Latin by Sarasin. The Inca Garcilaso de la Vega made one of its three translations into Spanish. Abravanel’s &quot;Dialoghi&quot; is notably one of the first original philosophical compositions to be published in the vernacular (as opposed to Latin). However, there is some controversy about the language in which it was originally written. According to Roth, although Abravenel had ample time to embrace and employ Italian, “the Dialogue read a little stiffly, [therefore] there is good reason to doubt whether [it] represents the original text” (xii). Also, the Hebrew text that remains was probably a translation, and while Spanish scholars also want to claim he wrote it in the language of the country from which he was exiled, it is possible that he wrote it in Judeo-Spanish, the language of many Spanish Jews and a mixture of Hebrew and Castilian. In the British Library, there is a manuscript (Or. Gaster 10688) of a Spanish translation written with Hebrew characters. This was once thought to have been the author&#x27;s original, or a copy of it; this is no longer accepted, and the text corresponds very closely to the 1568 Spanish translation. This translation was likely produced in order reclaim Abravanel&#x27;s Jewish identity and to encourage Spanish-speaking diaspora communities and as an appeal to the Spanish king to remember and reconsider the situation of the Sephardic exiles.

In his &quot;Dialoghi d&#x27;amore&quot;, Judah (Leon) Abravanel seeks to define love in philosophical terms. He structures his three dialogues as a conversation between two abstract and mostly undeveloped “characters”: Philo, representing love or appetite, and Sophia, representing science or wisdom, in other words, Philo+Sophia (philosophy).

The first dialogue, titled, “Philo and Sophia on Love and Desire” is a contemplation on the distinctions between love and desire, or the types of love and the true nature of love. In Sophia&#x27;s opinion, love and desire are exclusive; however, Philo argues that love and desire mix in things we find pleasurable, and that desire assumes knowledge of its object and, thus, its existence. Philo defines desire as that which seeks to become united with its object and love as that which, in union with its object, is enjoyed. When love and desire intersect, there are three different qualities of objects: useful, pleasant and good. Useful objects are not loved and desired together. Useful objects are those that are possessed. Meanwhile, love and desire of pleasant objects grows and perishes at the same time; pleasant objects exist because of privation. Good objects, on the other hand, exist when love and desire have no limit.

Sophia then asks Philo to distinguish love of God from love of friends. He posits that God is the fountainhead, reason and end of good in the world. However, as humans, we lack the knowledge to love God completely.

Happiness is the next topic of discussion, and the two determine that it exists not by gaining or enjoying a possession but rather in wisdom, when virtue is assumed. Wisdom is not omniscience, however, which is noted to be almost unreachable and can be found only in knowing God or communing with the Active Intellect. 
From there, Sophia asks Philo to clarify knowledge and love of God. Wisdom is born out of the love of God, he explains, and is the source of human happiness. Sophia then asks Philo to give a definition of the love that he feels for her, according to their discussion. He attempts to win her affection by stating that union increases love because of the physical aspect of human love, while injury does not. He adds that love is born of Reason (though it is not subject to it directly, or at least not to its “ordinary” form; rather, “heroic Reason” motivates it to seek the beloved as its object). At this point, Philo tells her that the hour is drawing late and she must rest while “my mind keeps it usual anguished watch.” However, she is not satisfied to end the discussion yet.

The second dialogue, titled, “Philo and Sophia on the Universality of Love” postulates that love is the dominant principle of all life and describes how love operates in human beings’ lives.

Sophia asks Philo to expound on his ideas of love&#x27;s origin and universality. As the translation by F. Friedeberg-Seeley and Jean H. Barnes in &quot;The Philosophy of Love&quot; reads,
 
The third and most lengthy dialogue, “Philo and Sophia on the Origin of Love” is a discussion about God&#x27;s love and how it encompasses all of existence, from the lowest creatures to the heavens and is the “cohesion of the universe.” A discussion of beauty and the soul follows, with an analysis of Plato&#x27;s ideas. The third dialogue is considered the most important at the aesthetic level.

In this dialogue, Philo and Sophia meet unexpectedly. After Philo apologizes for not recognizing Sophia because he was struck by her beauteous image, he begins to discuss a comparison between the soul and intellect. As the translation by F. Friedeberg-Seeley and Jean H. Barnes in &quot;The Philosophy of Love&quot; reads, &quot;The intellect is purely spiritual, whereas the soul is partly spiritual and partly corporeal, and is ever-moving to and fro between body and mind.&quot; 
Philo [later] defines the essence of love:

Philo then turns to Sophia&#x27;s first question, and shows her that love must have been created and is subject to birth, because it presupposes both lover and beloved, from whom it takes its origin.

The answer to the second question—when was love first born?—must depend on yet another—when was the world first created? The first love and procreative cause of the universe is that of God for Himself as eternal lover and beloved, and whenever the universe was first created, then love was first born.

As to the birthplace of love, this must have been the angelic world, which is the most perfect of all created being and has, therefore, the most perfect knowledge of the divine beauty it lacks.

In answer to the fourth question—who were the parents of love?—Philo tells Sophia of the allegorical meaning of the birth of Cupid, and that of the ancient and mythological figure, Androgynous, and of the creation of Adam and Eve and the fall of man. The universal father of all love is the beautiful, and the universal mother a knowledge of the beautiful together with privation. Beauty is the necessity a prior condition of all love, because it is upon the world. The supremely beautiful is God, the highest beauty is His intellect or wisdom, in the image of which the whole derives from the form that actuates their matter, and therefore all the forms or Ideas pre-exist in the eternal splendor. The end of all love is pleasure, and this is the same as the desire of the lover for union with the beloved, because pleasure consists in union with the pleasurable. The end of love of the universe is union with divine beauty, the final beatitude and highest perfection of all creation.

Philo, however is careful to point out that his love has no end but torment and grief, because Sophia is unwilling to grant him his desire and makes no return of his love. She persists in her refusal to recognize any save the love of the intellect, and finding that argument cannot avail her against the subtleties of Philo&#x27;s reasoning, reminds him of his promise to tell of the effects of love, for she would know further of the dangers into which he would lead her. And so the lovers part, and the tale of their promised meeting is as yet untold.

&quot;Dialoghi d&#x27;amore&quot; was an important work in Spanish culture as it brought Renaissance ideals to Spain. Otis Green argues in his &quot;España y la tradición occidental&quot; that in Abravanel&#x27;s work human love is spiritualized, placing it in connection with divine love, by posing the necessity of going beyond physical union to merge minds and souls.

Miguel de Cervantes refers to the &quot;Dialoghi d&#x27;amore&quot; in the Prologue to his &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.
