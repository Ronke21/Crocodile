<text>Elasmosaurus () is a genus of plesiosaur that lived in North America during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, at about 80.6 to 77million years ago. The first specimen was discovered in 1867 near Fort Wallace, Kansas, US, and was sent to the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who named it E.platyurus in 1868. The generic name means &quot;thin-plate reptile&quot;, and the specific name means &quot;flat-tailed&quot;. Cope originally reconstructed the skeleton of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; with the skull at the end of the tail, an error which was made light of by the paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, and became part of their &quot;Bone Wars&quot; rivalry. Only one incomplete &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; skeleton is definitely known, consisting of a fragmentary skull, the spine, and now lost pectoral and pelvic girdles, and a single species is recognized today; other species are now considered invalid or have been moved to other genera. A fragmentary specimen from Germany may belong to this genus.

Measuring in length, &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; would have had a streamlined body with paddle-like limbs, a short tail, a small head, and an extremely long neck. The neck alone was around long. Along with its relative &quot;Albertonectes&quot;, it was one of the longest-necked animals to have lived, with the second largest number of neck vertebrae known, 72, 4 fewer than &quot;Albertonectes&quot;. The skull would have been slender and triangular, with large, fang-like teeth at the front, and smaller teeth towards the back. It had six teeth in each premaxilla of the upper jaw, and may have had 14 teeth in the maxilla and 19 in the dentary of the lower jaw. Most of the neck vertebrae were compressed sideways, and bore a longitudinal crest or keel along the sides.

The family Elasmosauridae was based on the genus &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, the first recognized member of this group of long-necked plesiosaurs. Elasmosaurids were well adapted for aquatic life, and used their flippers for swimming. Contrary to earlier depictions, their necks were not very flexible, and could not be held high above the water surface. It is unknown what their long necks were used for, but they may have had a function in feeding. Elasmosaurids probably ate small fish and marine invertebrates, seizing them with their long teeth, and may have used gastroliths (stomach stones) to help digest their food. &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; is known from the Pierre Shale formation, which represents marine deposits from the Western Interior Seaway.

==History of study==

In early 1867, the American army surgeon Theophilus Hunt Turner and the army scout William Comstock explored the rocks around Fort Wallace, Kansas, where they were stationed during the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad. Approximately northeast of Fort Wallace, near McAllaster, Turner discovered the bones of a large fossil reptile in a ravine in the Pierre Shale formation, and though he had no paleontological experience, he recognized the remains as belonging to an &quot;extinct monster&quot;. In June, Turner gave three fossil vertebrae to the American scientist John LeConte, a member of the railway survey, to take back east to be identified. In December, LeConte delivered some of the vertebrae to the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP, known since 2011 as the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University). Recognizing them as the remains of a plesiosaur, larger than any he had seen in Europe, Cope wrote to Turner asking him to deliver the rest of the specimen, at the ANSP&#x27;s expense.

In December 1867 Turner and others from Fort Wallace returned to the site and recovered much of the vertebral column, as well as concretions that contained other bones; the material had a combined weight of . The fossils were dug or pried out of the relatively soft shale with picks and shovels, loaded on a horse-drawn wagon, and transported back to Fort Wallace. Cope sent instructions on how to pack the bones, which were thereafter sent in hay-padded crates on a military wagon east to the railroad, which had not yet reached the fort. The specimen arrived in Philadelphia by rail in March 1868, whereafter Cope examined it hurriedly; he reported on it at the March ANSP meeting, during which he named it &quot;Elasmosaurus platyurus&quot;. The generic name &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; means &quot;thin-plate reptile&quot;, in reference to the &quot;plate&quot; bones of the sternal and pelvic regions, and the specific name &quot;platyurus&quot; means &quot;flat-tailed&quot;, in reference to the compressed &quot;tail&quot; (actually the neck) and laminae of the vertebrae there.
Cope requested that Turner search for more parts of the &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; specimen, and was sent more fossils during August or September 1868. The ANSP thanked Turner for his &quot;very valuable gift&quot; at their meeting in December 1868, and Turner visited the museum during spring, at a time when Cope was absent. Turner died unexpectedly at Fort Wallace on July27, 1869, without seeing the completion of the work he began, but Cope continued to write him, unaware of his death until 1870. The circumstances around Turner&#x27;s discovery of the type specimen were not covered in Cope&#x27;s report, and remained unknown until Turner&#x27;s letters were published in 1987. &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; was the first major fossil discovery in Kansas (and the largest from there at the time), and marked the beginning of a fossil collecting rush that sent thousands of fossils from Kansas to prominent museums on the American east coast. &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; was one of few plesiosaurs known from the New World at the time, and the first recognized member of the long-necked family of plesiosaurs, the Elasmosauridae.

In 1869 Cope scientifically described and figured &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, and the preprint version of the manuscript contained a reconstruction of the skeleton which he had earlier presented during his report at an ANSP meeting in September 1868. The reconstruction showed &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; with a short neck and a long tail, unlike other plesiosaurs, and Cope was also unsure whether it had hind limbs. At an ANSP meeting a year and a half later, in March 1870, the American paleontologist Joseph Leidy (Cope&#x27;s mentor) noted that Cope&#x27;s reconstruction of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; showed the skull at the wrong end of the vertebral column, at the end of the tail instead of the neck. Cope had apparently concluded that the tail vertebrae belonged to the neck, since the jaws had been found at that end of the skeleton, even though the opposite end terminated in the axis and atlas bones that are found in the neck. Leidy also concluded that &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; was identical to &quot;Discosaurus&quot;, a plesiosaur he had named in 1851.

To hide his mistake, Cope attempted to recall all copies of the preprint article, and printed a corrected version with a new skeletal reconstruction that placed the head on the neck (though it reversed the orientation of the individual vertebrae) and different wording in 1870. In a reply to Leidy, Cope claimed that he had been misled by the fact that Leidy had arranged the vertebrae of &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot; in the reverse order in his 1851 description of that genus, and pointed out that his reconstruction had been corrected. Cope also rejected the idea that &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; and &quot;Discosaurus&quot; were identical, and noted that the latter and &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot; did not have any distinguishing features. Though Cope had tried to destroy the preprints, one copy came to the attention of the American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, who made light of the mistake. This led to antagonism between Cope, who was embarrassed by the mistake, and Marsh, who brought up the mistake repeatedly for decades. Marsh returned to the issue during their controversy in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; in the 1890s (Marsh claimed he had pointed out the error to Cope immediately), when their dispute gained widespread public attention. The argument was part of the &quot;Bone Wars&quot; rivalry between the two, and is well known in the history of paleontology.

Because of Cope&#x27;s reputation as a brilliant paleontologist, it has been questioned why he would make such an obvious anatomical error. It has been suggested that, as a unique specimen in 1868, the original &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; may have been hard to interpret based on the knowledge available at the time. Also, Cope initially thought it consisted of two specimens of different animalsin an 1868 letter to LeConte, Cope had referred to the supposed &quot;smaller specimen&quot; as &quot;Discosaurus carinatus&quot;. Cope was only in his late twenties and not formally trained in paleontology, and may have been influenced by Leidy&#x27;s mistake of reversing the vertebral column of &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot;. In 2002 the American art historian Jane P. Davidson noted that the fact that other scientists early on had pointed out Leidy&#x27;s error argues against this explanation, adding that Cope was not convinced he had made a mistake. Plesiosaur anatomy was sufficiently well known at the time that Cope should not have made the mistake, according to Davidson. Cope did little work on the specimen since his 1870 description, and it was kept in storage for nearly 30 years. It was only redescribed in detail in 2005 by the German paleontologist Sven Sachs.

===Known and possible fossil elements===
Today, the incomplete holotype specimen, cataloged as ANSP 10081, is the only definite specimen of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;. It was long exhibited, but is now stored in a cabinet with other assigned fragments. The specimen consists of the premaxillae, part of the hind-section of the right maxilla, two maxilla fragments with teeth, the front part of the dentaries, three more jaw fragments, two cranial fragments of indeterminable identity, 72 cervical vertebrae of the neck, including the atlas and axis, 3pectoral vertebrae, 6back vertebrae, 4sacral vertebrae, 18 tail vertebrae, as well as rib fragments. In 2013 an incomplete neck vertebra centrum of the holotype that had been mentioned by Cope but thought to have been lost was rediscovered in storage by Sachs, and the neck vertebra count was revised from 71 to 72. The neck vertebrae have been taphonomically distorted (changes occurring during decay and fossilization), with some parts being unnaturally compressed or displaced. In 1986 a three-dimensional reconstruction of the holotype skeleton was completed and is now displayed at the ANSP. This cast was later copied by the company Triebold Paleontology Incorporated, and replicas were provided to other museums. The replica at the Fort Wallace Museum measures about in length.
Though Cope described and figured the pectoral and pelvic girdles of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; in 1869 and 1875, these elements were noted as missing from the collection by the American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston in 1906. Cope had loaned these elements to the English sculptor Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins to help prepare them out of their surrounding concretions. At the time, Hawkins was working on a &quot;Paleozoic Museum&quot; in New York&#x27;s Central Park, where a reconstruction of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; was to appear, an American equivalent to his life-sized Crystal Palace Dinosaurs in London. In May 1871 much of the exhibit material in Hawkins&#x27; workshop was destroyed by vandals for unclear reasons and their fragments buried; it is possible that the girdle elements of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; were at the workshop and were likewise destroyed. Nothing was subsequently mentioned about their loss by Hawkins or Cope. In 2018, Davidson and Everhart documented the events leading up to the disappearance of these fossils, and suggested that a photo and drawing of Waterhouse&#x27;s workshop from 1869 appear to show concretions on the floor that may have been the unprepared girdles of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;. They also noted that conceptual sketches of the Palaeozoic Museum show that the model &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; was originally envisioned with a long &quot;tail&quot;, though later updated with a long neck. Davidson and Everhart concluded that the girdle fossils were most likely destroyed in Hawkins&#x27; workshop.
Fossils that may have belonged to the holotype were found by the American geologist Benjamin Franklin Mudge in 1871, but have probably been lost since. Additional plesiosaur fossils were recovered near the original locality in 1954, 1991, 1994, and 1998, including back vertebrae, ribs, gastralia (belly ribs), and gastroliths. As none of these elements overlap with those of the holotype specimen, in 2005 the American paleontologist Michael J. Everhart concluded they belonged to the same individual, and that the parts had been separated before burial of the carcass. He also noted that a small stone wedged in the neural canal of one of the tail vertebrae of the holotype may be a gastrolith, based on its polished appearance. In 2007 the Colombian paleontologists Leslie Noè and Marcela Gómez-Pérez expressed doubt that the additional elements belonged to the type specimen, or even to &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, due to lack of evidence. They explained that elements missing from the holotype may have been lost to weathering or simply not collected, and that parts may have been lost or damaged during transportation or preparation. Gastroliths may also not have been recognized as such during collection, since such stones were not reported from a plesiosaur until ten years after.

In 2017 Sachs and Joachim Ladwig suggested that a fragmentary elasmosaurid skeleton from the upper Campanian of Kronsmoor in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, and housed in the Naturkunde-Museum Bielefeld, may have belonged to &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;. Additional parts of the same skeleton are housed at the Institute for Geology of the University of Hamburg, as well as in private collections. Combined, the specimen consists of neck, back and tail vertebrae, phalanges, a tooth, limb elements, 110 gastroliths, and unidentifiable fragments.

==Description==

Though the only known specimen of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; (holotype specimen ANSP10081) is fragmentary and missing many elements, related elasmosaurids show it would have had a compact, streamlined body, long, paddle-like limbs, a short tail, a proportionately small head, and an extremely long neck. The neck of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; is estimated at in length; thus, &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; and its relative &quot;Albertonectes&quot; were some of the longest-necked animals ever to have lived, with the largest number of neck vertebrae of any known vertebrate animals. In spite of their many neck vertebrae, the necks of elasmosaurids were less than half as long as those of the longest-necked sauropod dinosaurs. Initially, in his 1869 description of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, Cope estimated the length of the animal by summing up vertebral lengths and estimations of missing parts, resulting in a total length of ; he believed that the living animal would have been slightly larger due to cartilage present between the vertebral bodies, and was estimated at roughly . However, in 1952, the American paleontologist Samuel Welles estimated the body length to have been , a number that was repeated by José Patricio O&#x27;Gorman in 2016.
Like other elasmosaurids, &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; would have had a slender, triangular skull. The snout was rounded and almost formed a semi-circle when viewed from above, and the premaxillae (which form the front of the upper jaw) bore a low keel at the midline. It is uncertain how many teeth &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; had, due to the fragmentary state of the fossils. It probably had six teeth in each premaxilla, and the teeth preserved there were formed like large fangs. The number of premaxillary teeth distinguished &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; from primitive plesiosauroids and most other elasmosaurids, which usually had fewer. The two teeth at the front were smaller than the succeeding ones, and were located between the first two teeth in the dentaries of the lower jaws. The known teeth of the front part of the lower jaw were large fangs, and the teeth at the back of the jaws appear to have been smaller. The dentition of elasmosaurids was generally heterodont (irregular throughout the jaws), with the teeth becoming progressively smaller from front to back. The maxillae (largest tooth bearing bone of the upper jaw) of elasmosaurids usually contained 14teeth, whereas the dentaries (the main part of the lower jaws) usually contained 17 to 19. The teeth interlocked, and their tooth crowns were slender and rounded in cross-section. The mandibular symphysis (where the two halves of the lower jaw connected) was well ossified, with no visible suture.

The pectoral and pelvic girdles of the holotype specimen were noted as missing by 1906, but observations about these elements were since made based on the original descriptions and figures from the late 19thcentury. The shoulder blades (scapulae) were fused and met at the midline, bearing no trace of a median bar. The upper processes of the shoulder blades were very broad, and the &quot;necks&quot; of the shoulder blades were long. The pectoral girdle had a long bar at the middle, a supposedly advanced feature thought to be absent from juvenile plesiosaurs. The ischia (a pair of bones that formed part of the pelvis) were joined at the middle, so that a medial bar was present along the length of the pelvis, a feature usually not found in plesiosaurs. Like other elasmosaurids (and plesiosaurs in general), &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; would have had large, paddle-like limbs with very long digits. The paddles at the front (the pectoral paddles) were longer than those at the back (the pelvic paddles).

===Vertebrae===
Unlike those of many other long-necked animals, the individual neck vertebrae were not particularly elongated; rather, the extreme neck length was achieved by a much increased number of vertebrae. &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; differed from all other plesiosaurs by having 72 neck vertebrae; more may have been present but were later lost to erosion or after excavation. Only &quot;Albertonectes&quot; had more neck vertebrae, 76, and the two are the only plesiosaurs with a count higher than 70; more than 60 vertebrae is very derived (or &quot;advanced&quot;) for plesiosaurs.

The atlas and axis bone complex, consisting of the first two neck vertebrae and articulated with the back of the skull, was long, low, and horizontally rectangular in side-view. The centra, or &quot;bodies&quot;, of these vertebrae were co-ossified in the holotype specimen, which indicates it was an adult. The neural arches of these vertebrae were very thin and rather high, which gave the neural canal (the opening through the middle of the vertebrae) a triangular outline when seen from the back. The lower part of the neural canal was narrow towards the back by the axis, where it was half the breadth of the centrum. It became broader towards the front, where it was almost the same breadth as the centrum of the atlas. The neural arches were also more robust there than in the axis, and the neural canal was higher. The neural spine was low and directed upwards and back. The centra of the atlas and axis were of equal length, and had a quadratic shape in side view. The surface (or facet) where the axis articulated with the next vertebra had an oval outline, and an excavation for the neural canal in the middle of its upper edge. A distinct keel ran along the lower middle of the atlas and axis vertebrae.
Most of the neck vertebrae were compressed sideways, especially at the middle of the neck. A crest (also termed ridge or keel) ran longitudinally along the side of the neck vertebrae (a feature typical of elasmosaurids), visible from the third to the fifty-fifth vertebrae, at the hind part of the neck. This crest was positioned at the middle of the centrum in the front vertebrae, and at the upper half of the centrum from the 19th vertebra and onwards. The crest would have served to anchor the musculature of the neck. The centra differed in shape depending on the position of the vertebrae in the neck; that of the third vertebra was about as long as it was broad, but the centra became longer than broad from the fourth vertebra and onwards. The centra became more elongated at the middle of the neck, but became shorter again at the back of the neck, with the length and breadth being about equal at the 61st vertebra, and those of the hindmost vertebrae being broader than long. The articular surfaces of the vertebrae in the front of the neck were broad oval, and moderately deepened, with rounded, thickened edges, with an excavation (or cavity) at the upper and lower sides. Further back in the front part of the neck, around the 25th vertebra, the lower edge of the articular facets became more concave, and the facet shaped like a quadrate with rounded edges. By the 63rd vertebra, the articular facet was also quadratic in shape with rounded edges, whereas the centra of the hindmost vertebrae had a broad oval outline.

The neural arches of the neck vertebrae were well fused to the centra, leaving no visible sutures, and the neural canal was narrow in the front vertebrae, becoming more prominently developed in the hind vertebrae, where it was as broad as high, and almost circular. The pre-and post-zygapophyses of the neck vertebrae, processes that articulated adjacent vertebrae so they fit together, were of equal length; the former reached entirely over the level of the centrum whereas the latter reached only with their back half. The neural spines of the neck vertebrae appear to have been low, and almost semi-circular by the 20th vertebra. The facets where the neck ribs articulated with the neck vertebrae were placed on the lower sides of the centra, but were only placed higher in the last three vertebrae, reaching around the middle of the sides. The neck ribs were semicircular to quadratic in side view, and were directed rather straight down. The bottom of each neck vertebrae had pairs of nutritive foramina (openings) at the middle, separated by a ridge, which became progressively more prominent and thickened towards the back of the neck.
The vertebrae that transitioned between the neck and back vertebrae in the pectoral region of plesiosaurs, close to the front margin of the forelimb girdle, are often termed pectoral vertebrae. &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; had three pectoral vertebrae, which is a common number for elasmosaurids. The rib facets of the pectoral vertebrae were triangular in shape and situated on transverse processes, and the centra bore pairs of nutritive foramina in the middle of the lower sides. The back vertebrae had rib facets level with the neural canal, and the front and back part of the transverse processes here had distinct ridges on their margins. Here the rib facets where placed higher than the transverse processes, separating the two, and were oval to rectangular in outline. The pre-zygapophyses here were shorter than those in the neck and pectoral vertebrae, and only reached above the level of the centrum with the front third of their length. The post-zygapophyses reached over the level of the centrum with the back half of their length. Back vertebrae are not useful for distinguishing between elasmosaurids, since they are not diagnostic at the genus level.

&quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; had four sacral vertebrae (the fused vertebrae that form the sacrum connected to the pelvis), a number typical of elasmosaurids. The transverse processes here were very short, and the rib facets increased in size from the first to the fourth sacral vertebra. A ridge ran along the top of these vertebrae, and the lower sides of the centra were rounded, and bore pairs of nutritive foramina, separated by low ridges. The first tail (or caudal) vertebra could be distinguished by the preceding sacral vertebra by having smaller rib facets, and by being positioned in the lower half of the centrum. These vertebrae were almost circular in shape, and the first two bore a narrow keel in the middle of the upper side. The rib facets of the tail vertebrae were located on the lower side of the centra, and their oval shape became larger and broader from the third vertebra and onwards, but became smaller from the 14th vertebra. Here, the pre-zygapophyses also reached over the level of the centra for most of their length, while the post-zygapophyses reached over this level by half their length. The lower part of the centra were rounded from the first to the third tail vertebrae, but concave from the fourth to the 18th. The usual number of tail vertebrae in elasmosaurids is 30. Since the last tail-vertebrae of elasmosaurids were fused into a structure similar to the pygostyle of birds, it is possible this supported a tail-fin, but the shape it would have had is unknown.

==Formerly assigned species==

Following the description of the type species, &quot;E. platyurus&quot;, a number of other &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; species were described by Cope, Williston, and other authors. However, none of these species are still definitely referable to the genus &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; today, and most of them either have been moved to genera of their own or are considered dubious names, &quot;nomina dubia&quot;that is, with no distinguishing features, and therefore of questionable validity.

Accompanying his 1869 description of &quot;E. platyurus&quot;, Cope named another species of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, &quot;E.orientalis&quot;, based on two back vertebrae from New Jersey. He distinguished &quot;E.orientalis&quot; from &quot;E.platyurus&quot; by the more strongly developed processes known as parapophyses on the vertebrae, in which he considered it to approach closer to &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot;; however, he still assigned it to &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; on account of its large size and angled sides. The first of these vertebrae was used as a doorstop in a tailor&#x27;s shop, whereas the other was found in a pit by Samuel Lockwood, a superintendent. Cope gave the name &quot;orientalis&quot; to the new species, on account of it possibly having a more easterly distribution than &quot;E.platyurus&quot;. Leidy subsequently moved &quot;E.orientalis&quot; to the now dubious genus &quot;Discosaurus&quot; in the following year. In 1952 Welles considered the species a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, given how fragmentary it was.

In 1869 Cope also published an article about the fossil reptiles of New Jersey, wherein he described &quot;E.orientalis&quot; as an animal with a &quot;long neck&quot;. Yet, in an accompanying illustration Cope showed a short-necked &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; confronting a &quot;Dryptosaurus&quot; (then &quot;Laelaps&quot;), with a plesiosaur-like &quot;Mosasaurus&quot; and other animals in the background. According to Davidson, it is uncertain which species of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; is depicted, but if it is &quot;E.orientalis&quot;, the short neck contradicts Cope&#x27;s own text, and if &quot;E.platyurus&quot;, he showed the animal with a short neck after acknowledging this was incorrect. Davidson has suggested that even though Leidy had pointed out Cope&#x27;s error in 1868, Cope may not have accepted this. In an 1870 reply to Leidy, Cope himself stated that the generic placement of &quot;E.orientalis&quot; was in doubt, and that he had illustrated it with a short neck due to believing this was the condition of &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot;. If more remains showed &quot;E.orientalis&quot; to have had a long neck like &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, he stated the image may instead represent &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot; better.
In the same 1869 publication wherein he named &quot;E. platyurus&quot; and &quot;E.orientalis&quot;, Cope assigned an additional species, &quot;E.constrictus&quot;, based on a partial centrum from a neck vertebra found in the Turonian-aged clay deposits at Steyning, Sussex, in the United Kingdom. It was described by the British paleontologist Richard Owen as &quot;Plesiosaurus constrictus&quot; in 1850; Owen named the species after the extremely narrow breadth of the vertebra between the pleurapophyses, or the processes that articulate between the ribs. He considered this to be partially an artifact of preservation, but could not understand how the compression affected only the central portion and not the articular ends of the centrum. Cope recognized this as a natural condition, and considered &quot;constrictus&quot; to be &quot;a species of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; or an ally&quot;. In 1962 Welles considered &quot;P.constrictus&quot; to be a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, given its fragmentary nature. Per Ove Persson retained it as valid in 1963, noting the longitudinal ridge on the sides of the centra as an elasmosaurid trait. In 1995 Nathalie Bardet and Pascal Godefroit also recognized it as an elasmosaurid, albeit indeterminate.
Cope discovered another elasmosaurid skeleton in 1876. He named it as a new species, &quot;E.serpentinus&quot;, in 1877, and differentiated it by the lack of compression in the rear neck vertebrae, the presence of few sessile ribs among the first few dorsals, and the presence of &quot;weak angles&quot; below the front tail vertebrae. Cope had also discovered another large skeleton that bore great resemblance to the known remains of &quot;E.orientalis&quot; from the black shale of the &quot;Cretaceous bed No.4&quot;; he excavated it with the help of George B. Cledenning and Capt. Nicholas Buesen. In 1943 Welles removed &quot;E.serpentinus&quot; from &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, and placed it in a new genus, &quot;Hydralmosaurus&quot;. Subsequently, all &quot;Hydralmosaurus&quot; specimens were moved to &quot;Styxosaurus&quot; in 2016, rendering the former a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. Williston published a figure of another &quot;E. serpentinus&quot; specimen in 1914; Elmer Riggs formally described it in 1939. Welles moved this specimen to the new genus and species &quot;Alzadasaurus riggsi&quot; in 1943. Kenneth Carpenter reassigned it to &quot;Thalassomedon haningtoni&quot; in 1999; Sachs, Johan Lindgren, and Benjamin Kear noted that the remains represented a juvenile and were significantly distorted, and preferred to retain it as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; in 2016.

Subsequently, a series of 19 neck and back vertebrae from the Big Bend region of the Missouripart of the Pierre Shale formationwere found by John H. Charles. Cope, upon receiving the bones at the Academy of Natural Sciences, considered them yet another species of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;. The vertebrae were, according to Cope, the shortest among members of the genus (approaching &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot; in this condition), but he still considered them as belonging to &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; due to their compressed form. He named it &quot;E.intermedius&quot; in 1894. However, in his 1906 revision of North American plesiosaurs, Williston regarded the vertebrae as &quot;all more or less mutilated&quot;, and found no distinct differences between the remains of &quot;E.intermedius&quot; and &quot;E.platyurus&quot;. In 1952 Welles opined that, if &quot;E.intermedius&quot; was valid, &quot;it must be referred to a pliosaurian genus&quot;; however, he proceeded to label it a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; in 1962. Three shorter vertebrae found alongside &quot;E.intermedius&quot;, assigned by Cope to the new genus and species &quot;Embaphias circulosus&quot;, were also considered by Welles to be a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; in 1962.

Williston named a number of other new &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; species in his 1906 revision. In 1874 he and Mudge discovered a specimen in Plum Creek, Kansas. While he initially assigned it in 1890 to a new species of &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot;, &quot;C.snowii&quot;, he subsequently recognized the elasmosaurid nature of its humerus and coracoids. Thus, he renamed the species &quot;E.snowii&quot;. A second specimen, discovered by Elias West in 1890, was also assigned by him to &quot;E.snowii&quot;. In 1943 Welles moved &quot;E.snowii&quot; to its own genus, &quot;Styxosaurus&quot;, where the species has remained. However, the West specimen was assigned to &quot;Thalassiosaurus ischiadicus&quot; (see below) by Welles in 1952; Carpenter returned it to &quot;S.snowii&quot; in 1999. Williston also reassigned the species &quot;E.ischiadicus&quot; from the genus &quot;Polycotylus&quot;, where he had initially placed it when he named it in 1903. The type remains were discovered by him in the same 1874 expedition with Mudge. Williston assigned another specimen discovered by Mudge and H.A. Brous in 1876. In 1943 both specimens were assigned to the new genus &quot;Thalassiosaurus&quot; by Welles, who then assigned the latter to the new genus and species &quot;Alzadasaurus kansasensis&quot; in 1952. Glenn Storrs considered both to be indeterminate elasmosaurids in 1999; in the same year, Carpenter assigned both to &quot;Styxosaurus snowii&quot;.
An elasmosaurid specimen was found by Handel Martin in Logan County, Kansas in 1889. Williston named this as a new species, &quot;E.(?)marshii&quot;. He bore reservations about its referral to the genus, and he recognized that it possibly pertained to another genus. In 1943 Welles moved &quot;E.(?)marshii&quot; to a genus of its own, &quot;Thalassonomosaurus&quot;; however, Carpenter sunk &quot;T.marshii&quot; into &quot;Styxosaurus snowii&quot; in 1999. Another species, &quot;E.nobilis&quot;, was named by Williston from very large remains discovered by Mudge in 1874 in Jewell County, Kansas. Welles named &quot;E.nobilis&quot; as a species of &quot;Thalassonomosaurus&quot;, &quot;T.nobilis&quot;, in 1943, but it too was considered to be part of &quot;S.snowii&quot; by Carpenter. Finally, two exceptionally large dorsal vertebrae collected by Charles Sternberg in 1895 were named &quot;E.sternbergii&quot; by Williston, but were considered indeterminate by Storrs. Williston mentioned three additional &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; species, which he would figure and describe at a later date. He again made reference to a new species of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, from Kansas, in 1908.

Several Russian species, based on poorly preserved vertebral remains, were assigned to &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; by Nikolay N. Bogolubov in 1911. One was &quot;E.helmerseni&quot;, which was first described by W.Kiprijanoff in 1882 from Maloje Serdoba, Saratov, as &quot;Plesiosaurus helmerseni&quot;. Some material from Scania, Sweden, was assigned to &quot;P. helmerseni&quot; in 1885 by H.Schröder. Vertebral and limb remains from Kursk initially assigned by Kiprijanoff to &quot;P.helmerseni&quot; were also moved by Bogolubov to the new species &quot;E.kurskensis&quot;, which he considered to be &quot;identical with &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; or related to it&quot;. He also named &quot;E.orskensis&quot;, based on &quot;very large&quot; neck and tail vertebra remains from Konopljanka, Orenburg; and &quot;E.serdobensis&quot;, based on a single neck vertebra from Maloje Serdoba. However, the validity of all these species has been questioned. Welles considered &quot;E.kurskensis&quot; as an indeterminate plesiosaur in 1962. Persson noted in a 1959 review of the Swedish &quot;&quot;E.&quot;helmerseni&quot; material that, while the species was probably closely related to &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; proper, it was too fragmentary for this hypothesis to be assessed; he later remarked in 1963 that, regarding the latter three species, &quot;their generic and specific definition is questionable&quot;, although he declined to specifically label them as invalid on account of not having seen the fossil material. Similarly, in 1999, Evgeniy Pervushov, Maxim Arkhangelsky, and Alexander Ivanov considered &quot;E.helmerseni&quot; to be an indeterminate elasmosaurid. In 2000 Storrs, Archangelsky, and Vladimir Efimov concurred with Welles on &quot;E.kurskensis&quot;, and labelled &quot;E.orskensis&quot; and &quot;E.serdobensis&quot; as indeterminate elasmosaurids.

Two additional Russian species were described by subsequent authors. Anatoly Riabinin described a single phalanx from a flipper in 1915 as &quot;E.(?)sachalinensis&quot;; the species was named after the island of Sakhalin, where N.N. Tikhonovich found it in 1909. However, this specimen cannot be identified more specifically than an indeterminate elasmosaurid, which was followed by Persson and Pervushov and colleagues. Storrs, Arkhangelsky, and Efimov were less specific, labelling it as an indeterminate plesiosaur; this classification was followed by Alexander Averianov and Vasilii Popov in 2005. Then, in 1916, Pavel A. Pravoslavlev named &quot;E.amalitskii&quot; from the Don River region, based on a specimen containing vertebrae, limb girdles, and limb bones. Persson considered it a valid species, and a relatively large member of the elasmosaurids; however, like &quot;E.(?)sachalinensis&quot;, Pervushov and colleagues considered &quot;E.amalitskii&quot; an indeterminate elasmosaurid.
In a 1918 review of the geographic distribution and evolution of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, Pravoslavlev provisionally assigned three other previously named species to &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;; his taxonomic opinions have not been widely followed. One of these was &quot;E.chilensis&quot;, based on the Chilean &quot;Plesiosaurus chilensis&quot; named from a single tail vertebra by Claude Gay in 1848. In a work published in 1889, Richard Lydekker assigned this species to &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot;. Wilhelm Deecke moved &quot;chilensis&quot; to &quot;Pliosaurus&quot; in 1895, a classification which was acknowledged by Pravoslavlev. Edwin Colbert later assigned the type vertebra in 1949 to a pliosauroid, and also assigned other assigned remains to indeterminate elasmosauroids; the type vertebra was recognized as potentially belonging to &quot;Aristonectes parvidens&quot; by José O&#x27;Gorman and colleagues in 2013. Another was &quot;E.haasti&quot;, originally &quot;Mauisaurus haasti&quot;, named by James Hector in 1874 based on remains found in New Zealand. Although its validity was supported for a considerable time, &quot;M.haasti&quot; is regarded as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; as of 2017. Pravoslavlev recognized another species from New Zealand, &quot;E.hoodii&quot;, named by Owen in 1870 as &quot;Plesiosaurus hoodii&quot; based on a neck vertebra. Welles recognized it as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; in 1962; Joan Wiffen and William Moisley concurred in a 1986 review of New Zealand plesiosaurs.

In 1949 Welles named a new species of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, &quot;E.morgani&quot;. It was named from a well-preserved skeleton found in Dallas County, Texas. However, part of the specimen was accidentally thrown out during the relocation of the Southern Methodist University&#x27;s paleontological collections. Welles recognized &quot;E.morgani&quot;″s similarity to &quot;E.platyurus&quot; in its shoulder girdle, but maintained it as a separate species due to its shorter neck and more robust rear neck vertebrae. In 1997 Carpenter reconsidered the differences between the two species, and found them sufficient to place &quot;E.morgani&quot; in its own genus, which he named &quot;Libonectes&quot;. Despite its reassignment and the loss of its material, &quot;L.morgani&quot; is often considered an archetypal elasmosaurid. Data based on these lost elements were unquestionably accepted in subsequent phylogenetic analyses, until a redescription of the surviving elements was published by Sachs and Benjamin Kear in 2015.

Persson assigned another species to &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; alongside his 1959 description of &quot;&quot;E.&quot;helmerseni&quot; remains from Sweden, namely &quot;E.(?)gigas&quot;. It was based on Schröder&#x27;s &quot;Pliosaurus(?) gigas&quot;, named in 1885 from two dorsals; one was found in Prussia, the other in Scania. While they were incomplete, Persson recognized that their proportions and the shape of their articular ends differed greatly from pliosauroids, and instead agreed well with elasmosaurids. Given that, at the time of Persson&#x27;s writing, &quot;there [was] nothing to contradict that they are nearest akin to &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;&quot;, he assigned them to &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; &quot;with hesitation&quot;. Theodor Wagner had previously assigned &quot;gigas&quot; to &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; in 1914. As of 2013, this questionable attribution remains unchanged. Another species from Russia, &quot;E.antiquus&quot;, was named by Dubeikovskii and Ochev in 1967 from the Kamsko-Vyatsky phosphorite quarry, but Pervushov and colleagues in 1999, followed by Storrs and colleagues in 2000, reinterpreted it as an indeterminate elasmosaurid.

==Classification==

Though Cope had originally recognized &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; as a plesiosaur, in an 1869 paper he placed it, with &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot; and &quot;Crymocetus&quot;, in a new order of sauropterygian reptiles. He named the group Streptosauria, or &quot;reversed lizards&quot;, due to the orientation of their individual vertebrae supposedly being reversed compared to what is seen in other vertebrate animals. He subsequently abandoned this idea in his 1869 description of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, where he stated he had based it on Leidy&#x27;s erroneous interpretation of &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot;. In this paper, he also named the new family Elasmosauridae, containing &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; and &quot;Cimoliasaurus&quot;, without comment. Within this family, he considered the former to be distinguished by a longer neck with compressed vertebrae, and the latter by a shorter neck with square, depressed vertebrae.

In subsequent years, Elasmosauridae came to be one of three groups in which plesiosaurs were classified, the others being the Pliosauridae and Plesiosauridae (sometimes merged into one group). Charles Andrews elaborated on differences between elasmosaurids and pliosaurids in 1910 and 1913. He characterized elasmosaurids by their long necks and small heads, as well as by their rigid and well-developed scapulae (but atrophied or absent clavicles and interclavicles) for forelimb-driven locomotion. Meanwhile, pliosaurids had short necks but large heads, and used hindlimb-driven locomotion. Although the placement of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; in the Elasmosauridae remained uncontroversial, opinions on the relationships of the family became variable over subsequent decades. Williston created a revised taxonomy of plesiosaurs in 1925.

In 1940 Theodore White published a hypothesis on the interrelationships between different plesiosaurian families. He considered Elasmosauridae to be closest to the Pliosauridae, noting their relatively narrow coracoids as well as their lack of interclavicles or clavicles. His diagnosis of the Elasmosauridae also noted the moderate length of the skull (i.e., a mesocephalic skull); the neck ribs having one or two heads; the scapula and coracoid contacting at the midline; the blunted rear outer angle of the coracoid; and the pair of openings (fenestrae) in the scapula–coracoid complex being separated by a narrower bar of bone compared to pliosaurids. The cited variability in the number of heads on the neck ribs arises from his inclusion of &quot;Simolestes&quot; to the Elasmosauridae, since the characteristics of &quot;both the skull and shoulder girdle compare more favorably with &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; than with &quot;Pliosaurus&quot; or &quot;Peloneustes&quot;.&quot; He considered &quot;Simolestes&quot; a possible ancestor of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;. Oskar Kuhn adopted a similar classification in 1961.

Welles took issue with White&#x27;s classification in his 1943 revision of plesiosaurs, noting that White&#x27;s characteristics are influenced by both preservation and ontogeny. He divided plesiosaurs into two superfamilies, the Plesiosauroidea and Pliosauroidea, based on neck length, head size, ischium length, and the slenderness of the humerus and femur (the propodialia). Each superfamily was further subdivided by the number of heads on the ribs, and the proportions of the epipodialia. Thus, elasmosaurids had long necks, small heads, short ischia, stocky propodialia, single-headed ribs, and short epipodialia. Pierre deSaint-Seine in 1955 and Alfred Romer in 1956 both adopted Welles&#x27; classification. In 1962 Welles further subdivided elasmosaurids based on whether they possessed pelvic bars formed from the fusion of the ischia, with &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; and &quot;Brancasaurus&quot; being united in the subfamily Elasmosaurinae by their sharing of completely closed pelvic bars.

Carpenter&#x27;s 1997 phylogenetic analysis of plesiosaurs challenged the traditional subdivision of plesiosaurs based on neck length. While polycotylids had previously been part of the Pliosauroidea, Carpenter moved polycotylids to become the sister group of the elasmosaurids based on cranial similarities, thus implying that polycotylids and pliosauroids evolved their short necks independently. The content of Elasmosauridae also received greater scrutiny. Since its initial assignment to the Elasmosauridae, the relationships of &quot;Brancasaurus&quot; had been considered well supported, and an elasmosaurid position was recovered by O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s 2004 analysis and Franziska Großmann&#x27;s 2007 analysis. However, Ketchum and Benson&#x27;s analysis instead included it in the Leptocleidia, and its inclusion in that group has remained consistent in subsequent analyses. Their analysis also moved &quot;Muraenosaurus&quot; to the Cryptoclididae, and &quot;Microcleidus&quot; and &quot;Occitanosaurus&quot; to the Plesiosauridae; Benson and Druckenmiller isolated the latter two in the group Microcleididae in 2014, and considered &quot;Occitanosaurus&quot; a species of &quot;Microcleidus&quot;. These genera had all previously been considered to be elasmosaurids by Carpenter, Großmann, and other researchers.

Within the Elasmosauridae, &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; itself has been considered a &quot;wildcard taxon&quot; with highly variable relationships. Carpenter&#x27;s 1999 analysis suggested that &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; was more basal (i.e. less specialized) than other elasmosaurids with the exception of &quot;Libonectes&quot;. In 2005 Sachs suggested that &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; was closely related to &quot;Styxosaurus&quot;, and in 2008 Druckenmiller and Russell placed it as part of a polytomy with two groups, one containing &quot;Libonectes&quot; and &quot;Terminonatator&quot;, the other containing &quot;Callawayasaurus&quot; and &quot;Hydrotherosaurus&quot;. Ketchum and Benson&#x27;s 2010 analysis included &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; in the former group. Benson and Druckenmiller&#x27;s 2013 analysis (below, left) further removed &quot;Terminonatator&quot; from this group and placed it as one step more derived. In Rodrigo Otero&#x27;s 2016 analysis based on a modification of the same dataset (below, right), &quot;Elamosaurus&quot; was the closest relative of &quot;Albertonectes&quot;, forming the Styxosaurinae with &quot;Styxosaurus&quot; and &quot;Terminonatator&quot;. Danielle Serratos, Druckenmiller, and Benson could not resolve the position of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; in 2017, but they noted that Styxosaurinae would be a synonym of Elasmosaurinae if &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; did fall within the group. In 2020, O&#x27;Gorman formally synonymized Styxosaurinae with Elasmosaurinae based on the inclusion of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; within the group, and also provided a list of diagnostic characteristics for the clade.

==Paleobiology==

Elasmosaurids were fully adapted to life in the ocean, with streamlined bodies and long paddles that indicate they were active swimmers. The unusual body structure of elasmosaurids would have limited the speed at which they could swim, and their paddles may have moved in a manner similar to the movement of oars rowing, and due to this, could not twist and were thus held rigidly. Plesiosaurs were even believed to have been able to maintain a constant and high body temperature (homeothermy), allowing for sustained swimming.

A 2015 study concluded that locomotion was mostly done by the fore-flippers while the hind-flippers functioned in maneuverability and stability; a 2017 study concluded that the hind-flippers of plesiosaurs produced 60% more thrust and had 40% more efficiency when moving in harmony with the fore-flippers. The paddles of plesiosaurs were so rigid and specialized for swimming that they could not have come on land to lay eggs like sea turtles. Therefore, they probably gave live-birth (viviparity) to their young like some species of sea snakes. Evidence for live-birth in plesiosaurs is provided by the fossil of an adult &quot;Polycotylus&quot; with a single fetus inside.

Elasmosaurid remains provide some evidence they were preyed upon. A humerus of an unidentified subadult elasmosaurid was found with bite marks matching the teeth of the shark &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;, while a crushed &quot;Eromangasaurus&quot; skull has tooth-marks matched to the pliosaur &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;.

===Neck movement and function===

Cope, in 1869, compared the build and habits of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; with those of a snake. Although he suggested that the vertebral column of the trunk did not allow for much vertical movement due to the elongated neural spines which nearly form a continuous line with little space between adjacent vertebrae, he envisaged the neck and tail to have been much more flexible: &quot;The snake-like head was raised high in the air, or depressed at the will of the animal, now arched swan-like preparatory to a plunge after a fish, now stretched in repose on the water or deflexed in exploring the depths below&quot;.

Although followed by many common media depictions, more recent research showed that &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; was incapable of raising anything more than its head above the water. The weight of its long neck placed the center of gravity behind the front flippers. Thus, &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; could have raised its head and neck above the water only when in shallow water, where it could rest its body on the bottom. Also, the weight of the neck, the limited musculature, and the limited movement between the vertebrae would have prevented &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; from raising its head and neck very high. The head and shoulders of the &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; probably acted as a rudder. If the animal moved the anterior part of the body in a certain direction, it would cause the rest of the body to move in that direction. Thus, &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; would have been unable to swim in one direction while moving its head and neck either horizontally or vertically in a different direction.
One study found that the necks of elasmosaurids were capable of 75–177˚ of ventral movement, 87–155° of dorsal movement, and 94–176° of lateral movement, depending on the amount of tissue between the vertebrae, which probably increased in rigidness towards the back of the neck. The researchers concluded that lateral and vertical arches and shallow S-shaped curves were feasible in contrast to the &quot;swan-like&quot; S-shape neck postures that required more than 360° of vertical flexion.

The exact function of the neck of elasmosaurids is unknown, though it may have been important for hunting. It has also been suggested that the long necks of plesiosaurs served as a snorkel and allowed them to breathe air while the body remained underwater. This is disputed as there would be large hydrostatic pressure differences, particularly for the extremely long-necked elasmosaurids. The neck anatomy of elasmosaurids was capable of making a gentle slope to allow them to breathe at the surface but would have required them to engage in energy-expensive swimming at the sub-surface. In addition, the longer neck would also have increased dead space, and the animals may have required larger lungs. The neck could have had other vulnerabilities, for example being a target for predators. 

Simulation of water flow on 3D models showed that more elongated necks, such as those of elasmosaurids, did not increase drag force while swimming compared to shorter necked plesiosaurs. On the other hand, bending the neck sideways did increase drag force, more so in forms with very long necks. Another study found the long necks of elasmosaurs would normally increase drag during forward swimming but this was cancelled out by their large torsos, and hence large body sizes may have facilitated the evolution of longer necks.

===Feeding===

In 1869 Cope noted that scales and teeth of six species of fish had been discovered directly beneath the vertebrae of the &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; holotype, and theorized that these fish would have had formed the diet of the animal. From these remains, Cope named a new species of barracuda, &quot;Sphyraena carinata&quot;.

The flexion ranges of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; necks would have allowed the animal to employ a number of hunting methods including &quot;benthic grazing&quot;, which would have involved swimming close to the bottom and using the head and neck to dig for prey on the sea floor. Elasmosaurids may also have been active hunters in the pelagic zone, retracting their necks to launch a strike or using side-swipe motions to stun or kill prey with their laterally projected teeth (like sawsharks). It has also been suggested that the predatory abilities of elasmosaurids have been underestimated; their large skulls, big jaw-muscles, strong jaws, and long teeth indicate they could prey on animals between and long, as indicacted by stomach contents including those of sharks, fish, mosasaurs, and cephalopods.

It is possible that &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; and its kin stalked schools of fish, concealing themselves below and moving the head slowly up as they approached. The eyes of the animal were at the top of the head and allowed them to see directly upward. This stereoscopic vision would have helped it to find small prey. Hunting from below would also have been possible, with prey silhouetted in the sunlight while concealed in the dark waters below. Elasmosaurids probably ate small bony fish and marine invertebrates, as their small, non-kinetic skulls would have limited the size of the prey they could eat. Also, with their long, slender teeth adapted for seizing prey and not tearing, elasmosaurids most certainly swallowed their prey whole.

Although elasmosaurids are commonly found with several gastroliths, &quot;Elamosaurus&quot; has only been found uncontroversially with a pebble lodged in the neural arch of one of its hindmost tail-vertebrae. A specimen of the closely related &quot;Styxosaurus&quot; contained fragmented fish bones and stones in the abdominal region behind the pectoral girdle. The fish remains were identified as &quot;Enchodus&quot; and other clupeomorph fish. The stones match rock from away from where the specimen was found. Several different functions have been proposed for gastroliths, including aiding in digestion, mixing food content, mineral supplementation, and storage and buoyancy control.

==Paleoecology==

&quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; is known from the Sharon Springs Member of the Campanian-age Upper Cretaceous Pierre Shale formation of western Kansas, which dates to about 80.64 to 77million years ago. The Pierre Shale represents a period of marine deposition from the Western Interior Seaway, a shallow continental sea that submerged much of central North America during the Cretaceous. At its largest, the Western Interior Seaway stretched from the Rockies east to the Appalachians, some wide. At its deepest, it may have been only deep. Two great continental watersheds drained into it from east and west, diluting its waters and bringing resources in eroded silt that formed shifting river delta systems along its low-lying coasts. There was little sedimentation on the eastern margin of the Seaway; the western margin accumulated a thick pile of sediments eroded from the western land mass. The western shore was thus highly variable, depending on variations in sea level and sediment supply.

The soft, muddy sea floor probably received very little sunlight, but it teemed with life due to steady rains of organic debris from plankton and other organisms farther up the water column. The bottom was dominated by large &quot;Inoceramus&quot; clams, which were covered with oysters; there was little biodiversity. Clam shells would have accumulated over the centuries in layers under the sea floor&#x27;s surface, and would have provided shelter for small fish. Other invertebrates known to have lived in this sea include various species of rudists, crinoids and cephalopods (including squids and ammonites).

Large fish known to have inhabited the sea include the bony fishes &quot;Pachyrhizodus&quot;, &quot;Enchodus&quot;, &quot;Cimolichthys&quot;, &quot;Saurocephalus&quot;, &quot;Saurodon&quot;, &quot;Gillicus&quot;, &quot;Ichthyodectes&quot;, &quot;Xiphactinus&quot;, &quot;Protosphyraena&quot; and &quot;Martinichthys&quot;; and the sharks &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;, &quot;Cretolamna&quot;, &quot;Scapanorhynchus&quot;, &quot;Pseudocorax&quot; and &quot;Squalicorax&quot;. In addition to &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, other marine reptiles present include fellow plesiosaurs &quot;Libonectes&quot;, &quot;Styxosaurus&quot;, &quot;Thalassomedon&quot;, &quot;Terminonatator&quot;, &quot;Polycotylus&quot;, &quot;Brachauchenius&quot;, &quot;Dolichorhynchops&quot; and &quot;Trinacromerum&quot;; the mosasaurs &quot;Mosasaurus&quot;, &quot;Halisaurus&quot;, &quot;Prognathodon&quot;, &quot;Tylosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ectenosaurus&quot;, &quot;Globidens&quot;, &quot;Clidastes&quot;, &quot;Platecarpus&quot; and &quot;Plioplatecarpus&quot;; and the sea turtles &quot;Archelon&quot;, &quot;Protostega&quot;, &quot;Porthochelys&quot; and &quot;Toxochelys&quot;. The flightless aquatic bird &quot;Hesperornis&quot; also made its home there. The pterosaurs &quot;Pteranodon&quot; and &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot;, and the bird &quot;Ichthyornis&quot;, are also known far from land.

<text>Athenaeum was an alternative pop rock four-piece band from Greensboro, North Carolina, US, formed in 1990 at an eighth grade dance by Nic Brown and Mark Kano.

== Overview ==

Classmates Mark Kano and Nic Brown formed the band, Athenaeum, in highschool. After several personnel changes, vocalist/guitarist Kano and drummer Brown with bassist Alex McKinney and lead guitarist Grey Brewster the band home-recorded demos in 1994, &quot;The Unofficial Demo&quot;, and later a self-titled eight-song EP in 1995, widely known as &quot;Green Album&quot;. Selling approximately 10,000 copies, &quot;Green Album&quot; was self-released and self-distributed, soon distributed by Redeye Distribution.

In 1996 the band was signed by Atlantic Records, releasing their major label debut, &quot;Radiance&quot;, in 1998. The first single, &quot;What I Didn&#x27;t Know&quot;, was a minor hit in the United States. The song &quot;Flat Tire&quot; from &quot;Radiance&quot; was a hit and enjoyed wide radio airplay in the Philippines, particularly the radio station NU 107. Though it didn&#x27;t appear on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, the song &quot;Un-noticed&quot; was briefly featured in the MTV Films feature &quot;Varsity Blues&quot; (1999). During the recording phase for their next album, Brown left the band to attend Columbia University. He was replaced by Jeremy Vogt, who performed with the likes of Tonic and The Connells. Brewster also dissolved his membership with the group and was replaced by Mike Garrigan, the lead singer and songwriter of Collapsis.

This new line-up played their first show March 31, 2001, at Ziggy&#x27;s in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The new set included Garrigan&#x27;s Collapsis anthem, &quot;October&quot;. Athenaeum&#x27;s second major label album, &quot;Athenaeum,&quot; (originally titled &quot;Plurabelle&quot; until weeks before its official release), was released September 18, 2001; however, it received little promotion in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks.

Eventually dropped by Atlantic Records, the band toured independently for an additional three years and released their final record, &quot;Hourglass&quot;, a collection of rare outtakes &amp; demos, before performing their last show December 28, 2004, at Ziggy&#x27;s in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Kano and Garrigan subsequently formed the band mg4 with McKinney and Vogt, releasing an EP &quot;Gravity Affects Me&quot; in mid-2004. Garrigan has since stepped back into his solo career and production work.

Brown went on to record and perform with bands/artists such as Ben Lee, Longwave, Skeleton Key, Eszter Balint, and Claire Holley. He has also published three novels, &#x27;In Every Way&#x27; (2015), &#x27;Floodmarkers&#x27; (2009), and &#x27;Doubles&#x27; (2010), and is now an English professor at Clemson University.

Brewster went on to form a local Greensboro, cover band, playing for several years before he finally settled in Charlotte, North Carolina, to begin work as a singer-songwriter and session musician.

In February 2009, Kano released a solo album, &quot;Walking on Broadway&quot;, produced and engineered by Garrigan. Gavin MacKillop, who also produced Athenaeum&#x27;s releases on Atlantic Records, did the mixing for the album.

<doc id="1264222" wikidata="Q2663697" url="?curid=1264222" title="Ostoja coat of arms">
<text>Ostoja is a Polish coat of arms that probably originated from Sarmatian Tamga and refer to Royal Sarmatians using Draco standard. Following the end of the Roman Empire, in the Middle Ages it was used by Ostoja family in Lesser Poland and later also in Kujavia, Mazowsze and Greater Poland. It is a coat of arms of noble families that fought in the same military unit using battle cry &quot;Hostoja&quot; or &quot;Ostoja,&quot; and that applied their ancient heritage on the coat of arms, forming a Clan of knights. Later, when the Clan expanded their territory to Pomerania, Prussia, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania they also adopted a few noble families of Ruthenian origin that in 14-15th century settled down in Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine, finally turning into the Clan of Ostoja. As different lines of the clan formed surnames after their properties and adding the adoptions, Ostoja was also recognized as CoA of several families that was not necessary connected to the original Clan, forming Heraldic clan.

==History and notable members==



==Blazon==
Original version: the coat of arms of the medieval version differed significantly from the generalized form in later times. The following reconstruction appearance comes from Josef Szymanski: 
&quot;Gules, between an increscent and a decrescent a cross in pale point downwards, all Or. On a helmet a dragon Sable, exhaling fire Gules, on two crescents pointing up, Or. Mantling Sable, lined Or&quot;

Modern version from the 17th century replaced a cross between crescents with the sword in pale point downwards. On a crowned helmet, five ostrich feathers.

The last image is of the seal of Dobieslaw de Koszyce from 1381 that is identical to an early sign found on the entry of the church in Wysocice of Nicolaus Ostoja de Sciborzyce (Lesser Poland) from about 1232.

Those coat of arms as below are of noble families and linked &quot;en masse&quot; to Ostoja simply because the moon or the sword in the shield. The list of imaginary Ostoja coats of arms might be longer than here presented. There are also Russian families that were ennobled and given the coat of arms that also looked like Ostoja during the partition time and that some call Ostoja. It is also possible that coats of arms were painted with error during the nobility verification process in the time of partition.

Below, CoA from the left: Błyszczanowicz - ancient family noted in 1497, error in 1806 by Russian authorities in Kiev that painted the coat of arms in the wrong way. Miklaszewski – this family was adopted to the Clan of Ostoja in 1569 when the family received nobility. Supposed to sign original Ostoja coat of arms. Third from the left is Ochocki coat of arms that received nobility in 1683 and was adopted to the Clan of Ostoja and sign modern version of Ostoja with sword instead of a cross. Fourth from the left, Gawłowski family of ancient origin and with a coat of arms that is simple error of foreign authorities, supposed to be original version of Ostoja. Strzałkowski (Strzałka) family is of ancient origin, also here the coat of arms is modified during partition of the Commonwealth but here most probably family helped authorities to change their original coat of arms. Purpose or reason of that is not known. Finally the coat of arms of Nagorski family that received nobility in 1590 and was adopted to the Clan of Ostoja. Note that there is another family of Nagorski of Ostoja of ancient origin but it is almost impossible now to separate those families from each other.

Second row from the left: Bogorajski, received nobility in 1775 and a crown as a display of a baron rank, although they never have been barons; this incorrect depiction is here since no other paintings of the correct coat of arms are available yet. Next coat of arms is of Raczewski (Racięski) family that also received nobility in 1775. The coat of arms of Kleczewski family followed by Mokrzewski family that are not members of the clan but show similar coats of arms to Ostoja. Last three coats of arms in this row are of families Orda, Plat and Wasilewski – none of them are members of the Clan, coat of arms have been simply added to Ostoja and are called a variant of Ostoja coat of arms.

Third row from the left: coat of arms of Fincke von Finkenthal family that received nobility in 1805, followed by the coat of arms of the Ostaszewski family that received nobility in 1785, most probably the name is wrongly spelled, and should be Ostarzewski. The third coat of arms from the left is of Krall family that received nobility in 1768 followed by the coat of arms of the Szyszko family that should be not mixed up with the ancient Szyszkowski de Szyszki family. The coat of arms of the Turkuł family that received nobility in 1676, this family is extinct. The last two coats of arms in third row are of Wysocki and Zawadzki families. Both families have never been considered as members of the Clan of Ostoja but also here their coat of arms became recognized as a variant of the Ostoja coat of arms. In the case of Wysocki family belong to the Clan of Kolumna with a modified coat of arms called &quot;Kolumna ze skrzydlami - Kolumna with wings&quot;.


Finally, below is the coat of arms of ancient German family von Finkenstein, also written as Fink von Finkenstein referring to the family of Fink that is noted in German records already in the 13th century. This family moved at that time to the land occupied by Teutonic Knights. In time this family became prominent.

It is not known who decided to call this coat of arms Ostoja Pruska but it is a significant example of breaking every possible heraldic rule in the name of Polish clan tradition where clan members used same coat of arms. It seems that this coat of arms was added to Ostoja almost by force. There are two families that where part of the Clan of Ostoja in the 14th century according to the records of Teutonic Knights, they lived in Pomerania and that have been given this coat of arms by all publications - the families of Lniski and Skrzyszewski vel Skrzeszewski. Here it is notable that the Skrzyszewski vel Skrzeszewski line in the 18th century suddenly changed their name to Lniski. It is not known if there is any blood relation between those families around the 14th century.

It is presumed that both families with roots dating back to the 14th century used the original Ostoja coat of arms and just because this family lived in Pomerania or Prussia, they have been given the coat of arms of the Finck family and called it &quot;Ostoja Pruska&quot;.

<text>Auerbach () is a town in the Vogtlandkreis, Saxony, Germany. It is the regional centre of the eastern Vogtland. The economy is mainly based on textile manufacturing, food processing and machine industry. After Plauen and Reichenbach, Auerbach is the third most populous town in the Vogtlandkreis.

Auerbach was mentioned for the first time in 1282. The town is situated at the declivities above the river Göltzsch at the foot of a castle tower from the 12th century. Landmarks include the towers of the St. Laurentius church, the Catholic &quot;Zum Heiligen Kreuz&quot; church and the tower of the castle. The three tall buildings give Auerbach its nickname “the Three Towers Town”.

<doc id="1264239" wikidata="Q1076414" url="?curid=1264239" title="Reaction coordinate">
<text>In chemistry, a reaction coordinate is an abstract one-dimensional coordinate chosen to represent progress along a reaction pathway. Where possible it is usually a geometric parameter that changes during the conversion of one or more molecular entities, such as bond length or bond angle. For example, in the homolytic dissociation of molecular hydrogen, an apt choice would be the coordinate corresponding to the bond length. Non-geometric parameters such as bond order are also used, but such direct representation of the reaction process can be difficult, especially for more complex reactions. 

In computer simulations collective variables are employed for a target-oriented sampling approach. Plain simulations fail to capture so called rare events, because they are not feasible to occur in realistic computation times. This often stems from to high energy barriers separating the reactants from products, or any two states of interest. A collective variable is as the name states only a set, a collection, of individual variables () contracted into one:

with a transformation matrix. The collective variables reduce many variables to a lower-dimensional set of variables, that still describe the crucial characteristics of the system. Many collective variables than span the reaction coordinate with a continuous function :

An example is the complexation of two molecules. The distance between both of them is the collective variable, where the atomic positions are the individual variables and the reaction coordinate would be the full path of association and dissociation. By applying a bias to the collective variables the simulation can be &#x27;steered&#x27; towards the desired destination. These kinds of simulations are called enhanced simulations.
Special collective variables that help to distinguish reactants from products are also known as order parameters, terminology that originates in work on phase transitions. Reaction coordinates are special order parameters that describe the entire pathway from reactants through transition states and on to products. Depending on the application, reaction coordinates may be defined by using chemically intuitive variables like bond lengths, or splitting probabilities (also called committors), or using the eigenfunction corresponding to the reactant-to-product transition as a progress coordinate. 

A reaction coordinate parameterizes reaction process at the level of the molecular entities involved. It differs from extent of reaction, which measures reaction progress in terms of the &quot;composition&quot; of the reaction system.

(Free) energy is often plotted against reaction coordinate(s) to demonstrate in schematic form the potential energy profile (an intersection of a potential energy surface) associated with the reaction.

In the formalism of transition-state theory the reaction coordinate for each reaction step is one of a set of curvilinear coordinates obtained from the conventional coordinates for the reactants, and leads smoothly among configurations, from reactants to products via the transition state. It is typically chosen to follow the path defined by potential energy gradient – shallowest ascent/steepest descent – from reactants to products.

<text>Dandeny Muñoz Mosquera (born August 27, 1965), also known as &quot;La Quica&quot; (Colombian slang for &quot;the fat girl&quot;, a childhood nickname), is a former sicario (hitman; paid assassin) for the Colombian Medellín Cartel, a prominent drug trafficking enterprise in Colombia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was described at one point as the &quot;chief assassin&quot; for the Cartel&#x27;s leader Pablo Escobar.

He was believed to be responsible for the deaths of an unknown number of people with official estimates ranging in the hundreds. US authorities currently link him to the deaths of more than 220 people, having supposedly murdered members of both his own organization the Medellín Cartel and the rival Cali Cartel, as well as police officers and government officials. Colombian authorities connect him to the deaths of more than 40 police officers.

Arrested in 1991, he is serving multiple life sentences in a US prison. He was the first person to be convicted under a 1956 federal law that made bombing a civilian aircraft a crime and the 1986 terrorism statute that allows the trial of foreign citizens in the United States if at least one victim was an American citizen. Among his convicted crimes is the 1989 bombing of Avianca Flight 203, which killed 110 civilians.

==Early life==
Born in Medellin, Muñoz Mosquera&#x27;s father was a police officer and his mother an evangelist. He was raised in the church. He is believed to have joined the Medellín Cartel in 1978 at the age of twelve after being drawn into the gang by his brother Brance (also known as Tyson due to his resemblance to boxer Mike Tyson) before becoming a gunman in his teens. He was given the nickname &quot;La Quica&quot; (Colombian slang for &quot;the fat girl&quot;) from a young age due to his resemblance to his great-aunt. He rose to become one of Pablo Escobar&#x27;s highest ranking enforcers. However, Muñoz Mosquera has claimed that he joined the Colombian army as a teenager before leaving in 1986 and was jailed on &quot;three or four&quot; occasions on minor theft charges.

In 1991, he was arrested and convicted of being one of the main conspirators in the assassination of New Liberalism founder Luis Carlos Galán, a candidate in the Colombian presidential election set to be held in May 1990. Galán was murdered by an unknown gunman as he took the stage at a political rally to deliver a campaign speech in Soacha. He was jailed in the capital city, Bogotá, but escaped in April 1991 after paying more than $500,000 in bribes, the second time he had escaped from a Colombian prison.

He was wanted in connection with the murder of over 40 police officers in Colombia after Pablo Escobar began offering a $4000 reward for the murder of any officer in Medellín. Colombian authorities also believe that he was directly involved in the bombing at the headquarters of the Administrative Department of Security in December 1989 and a rocket attack on the US Embassy. He was also believed to run a training camp for teenage potential &quot;sicarios&quot; (hitmen) for the Cartel. He has two children.

==US arrest and subsequent legal actions==
In September 1991, Muñoz Mosquera travelled to the United States, landing in Miami before travelling to Los Angeles and New York. After federal agents received a tipoff from Colombia, on September 25, 1991, Muñoz Mosquera was arrested along with two other men while using a payphone in the Jackson Heights area of Queens, New York, for traveling with a fake passport. Officials stated that none of the men were armed and offered no resistance when challenged by officers. Muñoz Mosquera initially lied to agents, stating his name as Esteban Restrepo-Echavarria, before his identity was confirmed by fingerprint records provided by Colombian officials. He was presumed to have travelled to the United States on an assassination mission and was held without bail as a result. One of his suspected targets was believed to be Max Mermelstein, a former drug smuggler who had worked for Escobar but had entered witness protection and was expected to implicate Escobar in the murder of Barry Seal.

He was convicted one month later of lying to a federal officer and possessing a fake passport and sentenced to the maximum term of six years in jail. While he was in jail, federal prosecutors claimed that he was a major player in the Medellín Cartel and was responsible for the bombing of Avianca Flight 203 on the orders of Pablo Escobar. On 27 November 1989, the flight took off from El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá bound for Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport in Cali but exploded in mid air minutes after takeoff, killing all 101 passengers and 6 crew members. Although the bombing had occurred in Colombia, he was eligible to be tried by the United States as two passengers on the flight, Carlos Andres Escobí and Astrid del Pilar Gómez, were American citizens.

Muñoz Mosquera was charged with &quot;conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine, substantive importation of cocaine, participating and conspiring to participate in a racketeering enterprise, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, various offenses relating to the bombing of a civilian airliner and the extraterritorial murder of two citizens of the United States&quot;. His first trial in 1994 lasted two months but was declared a mistrial after the jury were unable to reach a verdict. In his second trial, in the same year, he was convicted on all thirteen counts and sentenced to 10 life sentences plus 45 years in United States Penitentiary, Marion, all to be served consecutively. He became the first person to be convicted under a 1956 Federal law that made bombing a civilian aircraft a crime and the 1986 terrorism statute that allows the trial of foreign citizens in the United States if at least one victim was an American citizen. Before sentencing, Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. commented &quot;Not only are you an evil man, but the things you did, you enjoyed doing.&quot; Johnson also stated his belief that Muñoz Mosquera was fortunate that the prosecution had not sought the death penalty as &quot;these acts cry out for the death penalty.&quot; Following his conviction, he became one of the first inmates housed at ADX Florence, a supermax prison in Colorado. He is currently incarcerated at United States Penitentiary, Lee, in Virginia.


While Muñoz Mosquera was convicted of the Avianca bombing, his involvement in the bombing was questioned by Colombian Attorney General Gustavo de Greiff, who sent a letter to Judge Sterling Johnson before the final trial, stating:

De Greiff was accused by United States officials of being involved financially in the cocaine trade.

The Colombian government initially suspected Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha a.k.a. &quot;The Mexican&quot;. Carlos Mario Alzate had also been blamed for the bombing and had confessed to the crime before Muñoz Mosquera was put on trial.

Many witnesses testified in court about Muñoz Mosquera&#x27;s brutal acts as a high-ranking member of the Medellín cartel. Many of those witnesses were convicted felons with links to the Medellín and Cali Cartels. Muñoz Mosquera claims that he did not recognize the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses, and his defense hinged on the insistence that he was a small-time thief and not even a &quot;sicario&quot; (contract killer), let alone Escobar&#x27;s chief assassin. He did not deny that his brother Brance, known as &quot;Tyson&quot;, later shot dead by Colombian forces, was involved in the Cartel (some, such as the anonymous informant whose tip led to Tyson&#x27;s death, have claimed was the Medellín &quot;Chief of Security&quot;).

==In popular culture==

*Rapper Nicki Minaj mentions &quot;La Quinta&quot; in her 2016 hit &quot;Black Barbies&quot;.
*In the 2012 Colombian television series &quot;Escobar, El Patrón del Mal&quot;, Manuel Viveros portrays the character of Daniel Muñoz &#x27;Quico&#x27;.

==Musical career==

===1987–1997: Early years and country albums===
The Moffatts consists of Scott Moffatt and his brothers Bob, Clint, and Dave, who are triplets.

Growing up in Faro, Yukon, Tumbler Ridge and later Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, the Moffatts learned to sing early in their lives. Their first recording was at Studio 86 in West Edmonton Mall, where they sang the song &quot;Grandpa&quot; by the Judds in 1987. They began singing country music with their mother, Darlana and father, Frank Moffatt. The boys first appearing on-stage in 1988 at the Timmy&#x27;s Springtime Telethon. In 1992, after performing at a number of large-scale country music festivals, the group was nominated for five awards by the British Columbia Country Music Association.

In 1992, the Moffatt family moved to Branson, Missouri where they performed with The Osmonds at the Osmonds Family Theatre. In March 1993 they moved to Nashville, Tennessee where they became regulars on TNN&#x27;s &quot;Nashville Now&quot; with Ralph Emery. In October, they joined the cast of the Country Tonite Show at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. In 1994 Country Tonite opened a new theatre in Branson and the Moffatts became a part of that cast. In 1995, they appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and performed &quot;Guns of Love&quot;. In 1996, their parents divorced and they lived primarily with their father, who also managed the group until their 2001 break up.

===1998–2000: &quot;Chapter I: A New Beginning&quot; and &quot;Submodalities&quot;===
In their teens, the group dropped out of the country music genre and recorded a new album, &quot;Chapter I: A New Beginning&quot;, and began singing pop/rock music. Prior to their teenage years the band would only sparingly perform their own instruments and had a back-up band, but now chose to do it alone with Scott on lead guitar, Clint on bass guitar, Dave on keyboards and Bob on drums. Lead vocals on the album were shared between Scott and Dave, however live they all took their turns. &quot;Chapter One&quot; sold more than six million copies worldwide and went double platinum in their native Canada. Many industry insiders say that the band sold that many again on the black market in Asia. &quot;Chapter One&quot; was also very popular in Europe. It was produced in part by the Berman Brothers (who also worked for Hanson and Real McCoy) in New York City and Toronto. The Ottawa-based radio station Hot 89.9 declared them the best new band of 1998.

One single on the US version of &quot;Chapter One&quot;, the Glen Ballard-produced &quot;Until You Loved Me&quot;, appeared in the Drew Barrymore film, &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;. &quot;Misery&quot;, on the US version of &quot;Chapter I: A New Beginning&quot; is on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot; starring Katie Holmes. In 1999, the band appeared on the NBC TV show &quot;Hang Time&quot;, performing the song &quot;Girl of My Dreams&quot; for the school. In the same year, The Moffatts also did an episode of TV show &quot;Campbell Scramble&quot;, a show that Calgary&#x27;s CTV sports newscaster Glenn Campbell made featuring his three daughters Kate, Maddy, and Amy Campbell. That year, the band performed at the Juno Awards show in Hamilton.

In 2000, they appeared on the Disney Channel show &quot;So Weird&quot; in the episode &quot;Destiny&quot;. The Moffatts also appeared frequently on &quot;The Sally Jessy Raphael Show&quot; and &quot;The Maury Povich Show&quot;. During their stay in Köln, Germany, The Moffatts met a young German guitar player, and German teen idol Gil Ofarim and co-wrote with him what was to be his breakout first single, &quot;If You Only Knew&quot;. The Moffatts sang O Canada at the 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In 1999 The Moffatts were awarded Fan Favourite Band of the Year at the iHeartRadio Much Music Video Awards.

The follow-up album &quot;Submodalities&quot; was released in October 2000, and contained a more classic/harder-edged rock flavor than typical &quot;boy band&quot; fare. The transition between the bubblegum pop of their prior album and the harder edge of the new was captured in the 2001 documentary, &quot;The Moffatts: Closing of Chapter One&quot;. The Moffatts wrote or co-wrote almost all of the songs on the album. Bob Rock, who has produced albums for such superstars as Metallica and Bon Jovi, produced &quot;Submodalities&quot;. The album was also certified platinum by the CRIA for selling over 100,000 copies. The first single, &quot;Bang Bang Boom&quot; at that time was the fastest rising single to No. 1 in Canadian music history and topped the retail singles chart in Canada. The Moffatts sang O Canada at the 2000 NBA All-Star Game. The Moffatts hosted the Juno Awards of 2000.

From 1998 to 2000 The Moffatts were one of the biggest selling act in South East Asia. The band stayed at the top of the charts in the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Indonesia throughout this period of time. They also completed a couple of firsts - The band shared the stage with Aqua for the first ever paid concert by an international artist in Shanghai, China, and the first ever out door stadium show in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. At the time The Moffatts were the biggest selling international band of all time in the Philippines, a title they will likely never relinquish as record sales are now a thing of the past.

===2001–2011: Breakup and post-breakup ventures===
On August 25, 2001, the group broke up following their concert in London, Ontario. Thirteen years of touring, over 5,000 concerts, different tastes in music, and the fact that they were all now 18 years of age weighed heavy on their decisions to go their own way.

After the break-up, Bob and Clint Moffatt briefly joined a group called Pusch and performed at the 2002 Winter Olympics. The band was later renamed Hidell, and lasted slightly over a year and released one album, which featured the single &quot;Going Down In Flames&quot;. On September 27, 2003, the band reunited to perform at the &quot;Fire On The Mountain&quot; benefit concert in Kamloops. In 2004, the Canadian Pacific Railway announced in a press release that Bob and Clint were &quot;reunited&quot; and appeared under the name &quot;The Moffatts&quot; for the railway&#x27;s Holiday Train program, a mobile fundraiser for community food banks. In 2005, Scott also joined the tour.

Bob eventually relocated to Ban Phe, Thailand, where he began working on an English singing contest with an educational organization called TEFL International. Bob convinced Clint to join him in Thailand and start a band called Same Same under the Sony BMG Music Entertainment label in 2006. As of 2011, Bob and Clint Moffatt reside in Nashville, Tennessee. They had been writing songs and performing under the name Two Bullet Parade, but later changed their name to Like Strangers. They performed in venues around the Nashville metropolitan area. In 2016 Clint and Bob released their new EP under the name Endless Summer, with the debut single &#x27;Amen For Women&#x27;.

Scott Moffatt resurfaced in an Ontario-based band The Boston Post, named after the newspaper. The original lineup included Shawn Everett on drums, Jon Gant on guitar and Neal Gupta on bass. They released an EP titled &quot;It&#x27;s 99PM&quot; in 2003. A video interview with Scott Moffatt from the Holiday Train show in Sparwood, BC on December 13, 2005 indicated that he planned to go solo and was recording in LA. On April 10, 2006, song previews from the upcoming independent release &quot;The Allegory of the City&quot; were put up on his music page along with the promise of a limited edition version soon being available for pre order. Scott has been credited as the producer that opened the door for Thailand&#x27;s biggest rock band Slot Machine.

Dave Moffatt eventually relocated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, at first with aspirations of attending the University of Winnipeg and then deciding to launch an acting and modeling career. Dave appeared in a 2005 Winnipeg production of &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; and was a contestant on &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, making it into the top 32 before being eliminated.

===2012: Reunion===
Beginning November 2012, The Moffatts were featured in LG&#x27;s online campaign, &quot;Life&#x27;s Good&quot;. The campaign features their song &quot;Bang Bang Boom&quot; with altered composition and lyrics.

The Moffatts reunited for the first time in over ten years for an online Christmas show on Stageit on December 22, 2012. The set list included Christmas carols and songs picked by fans from the entire Moffatts&#x27; catalog, including solo records and Like Strangers/Same Same.

===2016–2017: The Farewell Tour===
On October 30, 2016, Bob and Clint Moffatt announced on their Facebook page that they would be reuniting once again for a one-time concert with Scott Moffatt as The Moffatts sans Dave Moffatt, and would be returning to Manila for the first time in 16 years as part of a farewell tour.

In February 2017, Scott, Bob and Clint Moffatt embarked on an extensive promotional tour in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore for The Moffatts Farewell Tour. On February 18, 2017 they performed at the Araneta Coliseum, approximately 19 years after their first concert in the Philippines at the same venue. They sang songs from their past albums, Chapter I: A New Beginning, Tour Souvenir Package, Submodalities and Same Same&#x27;s The Meaning of Happy, and current projects such as Endless Summer.

Scott Moffatt has recorded a solo EP in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and has produced an album for country music singer Luke Combs. while Bob and Clint Moffatt are staying in Nashville, Tennessee, as the country duo Music Travel Love. Dave Moffatt was a yoga instructor in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and came back from retirement by holding his own farewell tour concert in Manila, Philippines on May 27, 2017.

===2018–present: Chapter II===
In November 2017, it was announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that a new single has been recorded by The Moffatts called &quot;Secrets&quot;. The group has also signed a record deal with Bec-Tero Music, Thailand. The song &quot;Secrets&quot; was released worldwide on January 10, 2018. Two further singles, &quot;Like I Love U&quot; and &quot;So In Love&quot; were released during 2018. The band also played live for the first time in 2 years on &#x27;The Reunion Tour 2018&#x27;.

A 6 track EP &quot;Chapter II&quot; was released in November 2018.

<doc id="1264263" wikidata="Q525030" url="?curid=1264263" title="Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport">
<text>Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport ) is an international airport serving Abuja, in the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria. It is the main airport serving the Nigerian capital city and was named after Nigeria&#x27;s first President, Nnamdi Azikiwe (1904–1996). The airport is approximately southwest of the city centre, and has an international and a domestic terminal that share its single runway.

==History==
A new airport terminal was built in 2000 by Julius Berger, located near the existing terminal that served both domestic and international flights. The new terminal opened in 2002 and serves international flights. The existing terminal now serves domestic flights.

In November 2006, the Abuja Gateway Consortium signed a US$101.1 million contract for the management of the airport over the next 25 years. The contract included the construction of an airport hotel, private car parks, shopping malls, and a bonded warehouse, totalling US$50 million during its first five years, and additionally an upfront payment of US$10 million. According to the business plan, total investments would have amounted to US$371 million during the period of the contract. However, then-President Yar&#x27;Adua revoked the contract in April 2008.

In June 2009, Delta Air Lines began a route to New York City via Dakar. The following June, the carrier introduced seasonal nonstop service to New York. It was reported in 2012 that Delta had suspended flights to Abuja due to the high cost of fuel and diminished passenger counts.

Plans were invited for the construction of a second runway. The contract was awarded to Julius Berger Construction Company for US$423 million, but was revoked due to the high cost. The Federal Government approved fresh bids for the construction of the second runway.

On 4 January 2017, Nigeria&#x27;s Federal Executive Council backed the Ministry of Aviation&#x27;s decision to close the airport for six weeks to enable repairs on the runway, which was said to be dysfunctional. The Nigerian government also approved N1 billion for the conclusion of the Kaduna Airport terminal, which had been debated as an alternative for Abuja Airport. Several airport users, including the Nigerian Senate, opposed the planned closure. It was believed that the closure of the airport would cause hardship for international and local air travellers alike.

On 8 March 2017, the Federal Airport Authority in Nigeria, stated that the airport will shut to commercial traffic for at least six weeks to bring needed repairs to the runway. On 18 April 2017, the airport was reopened following the completion of the project.

On 20 December 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari commissioned a new terminal building. The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria says the newly completed terminal building can process up to 15 million passengers annually.

==Other facilities==
The Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) has its head office on the airport grounds.

The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has its head office on the airport. Previously the agency had its Abuja office on the airport grounds, though before that it had the authority&#x27;s head office.

The airport operates a private jet wing that serves businesses, diplomats and politicians in the city. In 2016, the Ministry of Transportation announced plans for a new terminal for private Jet operations. The General Aviation Terminal project will cost N258 million naira and will include a new protocol Lounge and rehabilitation of the fire station at the Airport. It will serve non-scheduled flights.

== 2017 runway reconstruction ==
In 2017, the Nigerian Government awarded a contract to Julius Berger for the emergency rehabilitation of the airport&#x27;s only runway. It had been built to last for 20 years but had been in use for nearly 40 years at that time. The airport&#x27;s runway was starting to show signs of fatigue and disrepair. The Airport was closed for 6 weeks, and flights were diverted to neighboring Kaduna airport. The Airport reopened with the completion of the Runway on 17 April 2017, 2 days ahead of schedule.

==Airlines and destinations==



==Statistics==
These data show number of passengers movements into the airport, according to the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria&#x27;s (FAAN) Aviation Sector Summary Reports.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On October 29, 2006, ADC Airlines Flight 053 crashed into a corn field on takeoff from Abuja. 96 of the 105 people on board died. *On 21 February 2021 a Nigerian Air Force Beechcraft B300 King Air 350i crashed shortly after takeoff while attempting to return to the airport.

<text>The Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) is the largest of the ten faculties that constitute Harvard University.

Headquartered principally in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and centered in the historic Harvard Yard, FAS is the only faculty responsible for both undergraduate and graduate education. FAS administers the courses offered at Harvard College, the Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Harvard Division of Continuing Education. It was headed by interim dean Emma Dench until August 1, 2023, when Hopi Hoekstra became Dean of FAS.

As of Fall 2019, FAS comprised 1221 total faculty, including 719 tenured and tenure-track professors as well as 502 other professors, lecturers, preceptors, and visiting faculty in some 30 academic departments in the arts and humanities, the social sciences, the natural sciences, and the engineering and applied sciences. There are approximately 6,800 undergraduates (Harvard College) and 4,500 graduate students (Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Science). The Harvard Division of Continuing Education has 795 admitted undergraduate students and 3,100 admitted graduate students. Furthermore the Harvard Division of Continuing Education welcomes more than 30,000 students annually in its open enrollment courses. In 2019, FAS had a budget of $1.6 billion and a revenue of $1.6 billion.

As of 2019, the FAS endowment had a market value of $17.5 billion. Harvard&#x27;s total endowment stands at $40.9 billion.

==History==
While Harvard College traces its origins to 1636, the body called the Faculty of Arts and Sciences only came into existence in the late nineteenth century. From 1820 until 1872, Harvard University consisted of the college and three professional schools (in law, medicine, and divinity). The governing boards established a Graduate Department in 1872 to administer and recommend candidates for the degrees of Master of Arts, Master of Science, Doctor of Philosophy, and Doctor of Science. In 1890, the governing boards merged separate faculties of the Lawrence Scientific School and the College into a single Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Graduate Department later became the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

The Lawrence Scientific School opened in 1847 and marked Harvard&#x27;s first major effort to offer a formal program in science and engineering. In 1948, the School merged with the Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Physics in FAS to form the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In 2007, the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences formally became the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. On June 3, 2015, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences was renamed the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, following a $400 million gift by Harvard Business School alumnus John A. Paulson.

In 2023, following a $300 million unrestricted donation by hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was renamed Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS).

==Organization==
FAS consists of the following divisions:

# Harvard College (established 1636)
# Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) (established 1872)
# The John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) (established 1847)
# The Division of Continuing Education (DCE) (established 1871)
# Arts &amp; Humanities Division (established 2004)
# Division of Science (established 2007)
# Division of Social Science (established 2004)
# Athletics (established 1780)
# Harvard Library (established 1638)
# Museums of Science and Culture (established 2012)

In addition, FAS includes 35 research centers, institutes, and interdisciplinary programs, eleven museums, and numerous libraries.

The dean of FAS serves as the chief administrative and academic officer, responsible to the president and provost of Harvard University for all aspects of the division&#x27;s operations, including budgets, planning, support services, faculty appointments, curricula, student affairs, and fundraising. The dean is appointed by the president with the approval of the university&#x27;s two governing boards, the Harvard Corporation and the Harvard Board of Overseers, and serves at the pleasure of the president. The dean of FAS is invariably drawn from the ranks of the tenured faculty in the division.

The deans of Harvard College, GSAS, SEAS, and DCE report to the dean of FAS, as do various academic deans, administrative deans (including those responsible for finance, development, faculty personnel policy, undergraduate admissions and financial aid), and the directors of various research centers and institutes.

From 2018 to 2023, the FAS was headed by Claudine Gay. Following Gay&#x27;s ascension to president of the university, Hopi Hoekstra was announced to become the new dean of FAS beginning August 1st, 2023.

<text>The Columns of Gediminas or Pillars of Gediminas (, ; , &#x27;Columns&#x27;) are one of the earliest symbols of Lithuania and its historical coats of arms. They were used in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, initially as a rulers&#x27; personal insignia, a state symbol, and later as a part of heraldic signs of leading aristocracy.

==Appearance==

The symbol appears in the following form: Horizontal line at bottom, vertical lines extend up at both ends. The square at the middle of the horizontal line is about half as tall as the vertical lines. Another vertical line rises from the top center of the square, giving an overall appearance that is close to a trident. This form is the one usually seen in modern times, often drawn on walls and fences as protest against the Soviet occupation of Lithuania.

It is notable that the ancient pre-Christian symbols of Lithuania did not follow the same strict rules of heraldry as their Western counterparts. Thus this symbol was used in or and argent, usually on the field gules, and was depicted in various shapes on flags, banners and shields.

Some Belarusian historians claim that the Columns directly go back to the symbol of the Rurikids, which was the trident.

==Name==

The name &quot;Columns of Gediminas&quot; was given in the 19th century by historian Teodor Narbutt, who supposed that the symbol was Gediminas&#x27; insignia. The more exact name of the symbol is the Pillars of Gediminids, since there is no direct evidence of its connection with Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas.

==History==

=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===
According to the historical and archaeological evidence, the Columns were used by Grand Duke of Lithuania and Duke of Trakai Kęstutis. They appear on the Lithuanian coins issued by him. The symbol was also used by Vytautas as his personal insignia since 1397 and appeared on his seal and coins. It was suggested by historian Edmundas Antanas Rimša, who analyzed the ancient coins, that the Columns of the Gediminids symbolizes the Gates of the Trakai Peninsula Castle. According to the accounts of Jan Długosz, it was derived from a symbol or brand used to mark horses and other property. The Columns were adopted by descendants of Kęstutis as their family symbol, equivalent to a coat of arms. Another user of the Columns of Gediminas was Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund Kęstutaitis. At first, the Columns signified the family of Kęstutis, in contrast to the Vytis which was used by Algirdas&#x27; descendants. Later on, as a symbol of a ruling dynasty, it was adopted by Jagiellons and the two symbols became state symbols of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Columns of Gediminas remained in use over the following centuries.
=== In the Interwar Republic of Lithuania ===
During the period between World War I and World War II they were used by the Lithuanian Republic as a major state symbol, e. g. on Litas coins, monuments and military equipment. The Columns of Gediminas are featured on the Lithuanian Presidential Award Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas, which was started in 1928.
=== In the Soviet Union ===
After the annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, the symbol was officially banned. During the Singing Revolution of the late 80s, it became the iconic sign of the reform movement Sąjūdis.

== Modern usage in Lithuania ==
The Columns of Gediminas appears in the coat of arms of Seimas and in the emblems of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, Land Force, Air Force, Navy, Military Police, National Defence Volunteer Forces and Grand Duke Gediminas Staff Battalion. The Columns of Gediminas are also featured in the coat of arms of Old Trakai, Trakai District Municipality and Šimkaičiai. The Columns of Gediminas is used by various Lithuanian sports teams such as BC Rytas and FK Žalgiris as well as the Lithuanian National Olympic Committee. The symbol is also added on to many monuments throughout the country.
The official logo of the EuroBasket 2011, which took place in Lithuania, is composed of the Columns overlaid on a basketball board.

The Columns of Gediminas with post horn are also the official logo of the Lithuanian postal company — Lietuvos paštas. The company uses the columns on its official stamps.

A combination of the Columns of Gediminas and the Menorah are used by the Litvak community as a symbol meant to identify Lithuanian Jews with content expressing the history of the Jews in Lithuania.

== Usage in Belarus ==

In modern Belarus, the columns of Gediminas, alongside the Pahonia, are occasionally used as a symbol of national pride.

The columns of Gediminas are in the coat of arms of Brahin in southeastern Belarus.

The symbol is featured on the monument to the Grand Duke Gediminas in Lida. which was unveiled in 2019.

== Usage in Ukraine ==
In Ukraine, the coat of arms of Zhytomyr Oblast adopted an archaic form of the Vytis (Pohonia) on the second quarter, with the Columns of Gediminas on knight&#x27;s shield.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine started, the Pahonia Regiment was formed as part of the International Legion of Territorial Defence of Ukraine, which used the Columns of Gediminas on their emblem.

== In art ==
The Columns of Gediminas are displayed at &quot;Battle of Grunwald&quot; by Jan Matejko.
The Columns of Gediminas are also displayed at &quot;Baptism of Lithuania&quot; by Władysław Ciesielski and &quot;Funeral of Gediminas&quot; by Kazimierz Alchimowicz.

<text>A science book is a work of nonfiction, usually written by a scientist, researcher, or professor like Stephen Hawking (&quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;), or sometimes by a non-scientist such as Bill Bryson (&quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot;). Usually these books are written for a wide audience presumed to have a general education rather than a specifically scientific training, as opposed to the very narrow audience that a scientific paper would have, and are therefore referred to as popular science. As such, they require considerable talent on the part of the author to sufficiently explain difficult topics to 
people who are totally new to the subject, and a good blend of storytelling and technical writing. In the UK, the Royal Society Prizes for Science Books are considered to be the most prestigious awards for science writing. In the US, the National Book Awards briefly had a category for science writing in the 1960s, but now they just have the broad categories of fiction and nonfiction.

There are many disciplines that are well explained to lay people through science books. A few examples include Carl Sagan on astronomy, Jared Diamond on geography, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins on evolutionary biology, David Eagleman on neuroscience, Donald Norman on usability and cognitive psychology, Steven Pinker, Noam Chomsky, and Robert Ornstein on linguistics and cognitive science, Donald Johanson and Robert Ardrey on paleoanthropology, and Desmond Morris on zoology and anthropology, and Fulvio Melia on black holes.

The roots of popular science writing can be traced back to the didactic poetry of Greek and Roman antiquity. During the Age of Enlightenment, many books were written that spread the new science to both experts and the educated public, but Mary Somerville&#x27;s &quot;On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences&quot; (first edition 1834) was arguably the first book in the modern genre of popular science.

<doc id="1264281" wikidata="Q3408374" url="?curid=1264281" title="The Clerk's Tale">
<text>&quot;The Clerk&#x27;s Tale&quot; is one of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, told by the Clerk of Oxford, a student of what would nowadays be considered philosophy or theology. He tells the tale of Griselda, a young woman whose husband tests her loyalty in a series of cruel torments that recall the biblical Book of Job.

==Plot==

&quot;The Clerk&#x27;s Tale&quot; is about a marquis of Saluzzo in Piedmont in Italy named Walter, a bachelor who is asked by his subjects to marry to provide an heir. He assents and decides he will marry a peasant, named Griselda. Griselda is a poor girl, used to a life of pain and labour, who promises to honour Walter&#x27;s wishes in all things.

After Griselda has borne him a daughter, Walter decides to test her loyalty. He sends an officer to take the baby, pretending it will be killed, but actually conveying it in secret to Bologna. Griselda, because of her promise, makes no protest at this but only asks that the child be buried properly. When she bears a son several years later, Walter again has him taken from her under identical circumstances.

Finally, Walter determines one last test. He has a papal bull of annulment forged which enables him to leave Griselda, and informs her that he intends to remarry. As part of his deception, he employs Griselda to prepare the wedding for his new bride. Meanwhile, he has brought the children from Bologna, and he presents his daughter as his intended wife. Eventually, he informs Griselda of the deceit, who is overcome by joy at seeing her children alive, and they live happily ever after.

==Narrator==
The tale is told by the Clerk of Oxford, who is a scholar of logic and philosophy. In the General Prologue, he is described as thin and impoverished, hard-working and wholly dedicated to his studies:

The Clerk claims that he heard the tale from Petrarch in Padua.

==Sources==
The story of patient Griselda first appeared as the last chapter of Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;, and it is unclear what lesson the author wanted to convey. Critics suggest Boccaccio was simply putting down elements from the oral tradition, notably the popular topos of the &quot;ordeal&quot;, but the text was open enough to allow very misogynistic interpretations, giving Griselda&#x27;s passivity as the norm for wifely conduct.

In 1374, it was translated into Latin by Petrarch, who quotes the heroine, Griselda, as an &quot;exemplum&quot; of that most feminine of virtues, constancy. Circa 1382–1389, Philippe de Mézières translated Petrarch&#x27;s Latin text into French, adding a prologue which describes Griselda as an allegory of the Christian soul&#x27;s unquestioning love for Jesus Christ. As far as Chaucer is concerned, critics think he used both Petrarch&#x27;s and de Mézières&#x27;s texts, while managing to recapture Boccaccio&#x27;s opaque irony. Anne Middleton is one of many scholars to discuss the relationship between Petrarch&#x27;s original and Chaucer&#x27;s reworking of the tale.

<doc id="1264286" wikidata="Q704641" url="?curid=1264286" title="1998 German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in Germany on 27 September 1998 to elect the members of the 14th Bundestag. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) emerged as the largest faction in parliament for the first time since 1972, with its leader Gerhard Schröder becoming chancellor. The Christian Democrats had their worst election result since 1949.

== Issues and campaign ==
Since German reunification on 3 October 1990, the unemployment rate in Germany had risen from 4.2% to 9.4% in 1998, with the Federal Labor Office registering more than 4 million unemployed. The unified Germany had to fight economic and domestic difficulties even as it actively participated in the project of European integration. Most people blamed the centre-right coalition government of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) for the economic difficulties. Longtime Chancellor Helmut Kohl&#x27;s government was regarded by many as not having fully implemented the unification after eight years, in view of the mass protests in many eastern German towns due to job losses and social welfare cuts.

The 1998 campaign began with both the CDU and SPD working out who would lead their parties. There had been rumours that Kohl would resign and allow Wolfgang Schäuble to take the reins of the CDU, but these rumours were rendered obsolete when Kohl announced in April 1997 that he would seek the chancellorship for a sixth term. The two contenders for the SPD nomination were Oskar Lafontaine, the party&#x27;s chairman, and Gerhard Schröder, Minister-President of Lower Saxony.

On 1 March 1998, Schröder led the SPD to a huge victory in the Lower Saxony state election, gaining an unusual absolute majority for the second time and effectively receiving the SPD nomination for federal chancellor. Schröder had announced he would withdraw his bid for the nomination if he received below 42 percent of the popular vote. In the 1998 general elections, Schröder received 47.9 percent. Following this election, Lafontaine withdrew his bid and Schröder was inaugurated in the May 1998 convention. For the SPD, Schröder offered a new face for the party. He gave the party a new vigor, one that was lacking in the CDU after Kohl proclaimed his nomination. Many in the CDU questioned if Kohl had made the right choice for the party.

The CDU campaign was based on the experience and reputation of Kohl. One of the CDU&#x27;s main slogans was &#x27;Safety, not Risks.&#x27; &quot;Kohl exploited his familiarity and experience, as well as his status as Europe&#x27;s longest serving head of government.&quot; The SPD on the other hand ran the campaign using strategies developed in the United States and the United Kingdom. The SPD set up election headquarters and introduced &#x27;rapid rebuttal units&#x27; not unlike those used by Bill Clinton of the United States in his successful presidential bid in 1992. The SPD avoided direct attacks at Kohl, but rather focused on their message of a &quot;new center&quot;.

The FDP had usually ridden on the coattails of the CDU, and was mostly disapproved in the polls. With the SPD well ahead in the polls, many of the voters from the CDU had fewer incentives to vote for the FDP. The FDP was also having trouble projecting a coherent platform to voters. The Greens too were having issues concerning their platform.

The two factions in the Greens, the fundamentalists and the pragmatists, had problems settling on their platform since the founding of the Green party.

The major issue of the 1998 campaign was unemployment. In 1996, the unemployment rate in Germany surpassed the government&#x27;s &quot;limit&quot; of 4 million unemployed people. Both parties blamed high labor costs, high taxes and the high welfare costs as the causes of the problem. During the campaign, Schröder used this issue against Kohl, calling him &#x27;the unemployment chancellor.&#x27; Unemployment was worst in the former East Germany. While the national rate stood at 9.4 percent, former East Germany was suffering with unemployment at 20 percent. Many in the former East Germany blamed Kohl for the slow economic recovery.

Another issue at hand were Germany&#x27;s tax and welfare reforms. While the CDU/CSU had offered proposals to reduce benefits in healthcare and pensions, the SPD controlled Bundesrat secured the passage of the bill. The proposed bill also offered tax cuts that were to benefit the rich, something the SPD opposed. While Kohl continually pushed the issue of European integration, the issue fell short from voters&#x27; minds. Schröder, on the other hand, almost ignored the issue. Many voters in Germany had other concerns besides the European Union.

===Results===
Toward the end of the campaign, polls placed the CDU/CSU and FDP coalition in a tie with the SPD and Green coalition. Despite these polls, the final numbers told a different story. The SPD-Green coalition won an unexpectedly large victory, taking 345 seats and earning a strong majority in the Bundestag—the first centre-left absolute majority in post-World War II Germany. The SPD won 40.9 percent of the vote, due to an increase of 4.5 percent from 1994.

The CDU/CSU-FDP coalition had gone into the election with a solid majority and 341 seats, but was cut down to 288 seats. The CDU/CSU lost 6.2% of its 1994 vote, and lost 109 electoral districts to the SPD. Germany&#x27;s mixed-member proportional system, in which a slate of statewide delegates are elected alongside the electorate delegates, softened the blow somewhat, so the CDU/CSU only suffered a net loss of 49 seats. It was still the CDU/CSU&#x27;s worst defeat ever. By contrast, their junior coalition partner, the FDP, netted a loss of just 4 seats.

The SPD swept all single-member constituency seats in the states of Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Saarland, Bremen, Hamburg and (for the first and last time) Schleswig-Holstein. Kohl lost his own constituency of Ludwigshafen, though he was still re-elected to the Bundestag through the Rhineland-Palatinate CDU party list, and he had not won the seat in the 1983 and 1987 elections. Future Chancellor Angela Merkel only narrowly won her constituency of Stralsund – Rügen – Grimmen with only 37.3 percent of the vote; the only time she got less than 40 percent of the vote.

A new government was formed by a coalition between the SPD and the Greens, with the SPD&#x27;s Gerhard Schröder as chancellor and Greens leader Joschka Fischer as vice-chancellor and foreign minister. It was the first red-green coalition government at the federal level in Germany, as well as the first purely centre-left government in post-World War II Germany.

Kohl stepped down as chairman of the CDU, as did CSU chairman Theodor Waigel.

===Legacy===

The 1998 German election was historic in many ways. It resulted in a centre-right government being succeeded by a left-wing one—the first in postwar Germany (the SPD&#x27;s previous term in government had been at the helm of a centre-left coalition).

In addition, it brought to an end the sixteen-year rule of Kohl – the second-longest of any German chancellor, and the longest tenure for a democratically elected head of government in German history. It has been compared to the defeat of Winston Churchill in 1945 – both were seen as conservative wartime leaders, and in both cases both were turned out of office by the electorate once the war was over. Churchill was ousted before World War II was even over, while Kohl managed to hang onto power for two more terms after the reunification of Germany (which is often considered to be the end of the Cold War).

<text>Port Harcourt International Airport (, , ) is an international airport located in Omagwa, a suburb of Port Harcourt, the capital city of the Rivers State in Nigeria. The airport has two terminals for both international and domestic flights. The new International terminal was commissioned by the executive president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on 25 October 2018. In 2009, the airport served 1,081,587 passengers, making it the third-busiest airport in Nigeria. The manager of the Port Harcourt international airport is Mrs Ifesinachi Ezike.

==History==
In 1997, Air France started flights to Paris.

On 18 August 2006, the airport was closed for repairs. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority stated that the emergency shutdown was in order to overhaul the runway and build a fence around the facility. Such maintenance had been in planning stages for several months, but an electrical fire on 17 August 2006 made repairs immediately necessary. All domestic flights were diverted to Sam Mbakwe Airport (Owerri), Akanu Ibiam International Airport (Enugu) and Margaret Ekpo International Airport (Calabar), while international flights were diverted to Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (Abuja) or Murtala Mohammed International Airport (Lagos). Repair work started in January 2007, while re-opening was originally expected to be in August 2007. In June 2007, work was suspended due to safety concerns of the engineers. In December 2007, the airport was reopened to a limited capacity. Operations were restricted to daytime until the first quarter of 2008, by which time the new CAT III lighting system became fully operational.

In 2015, the airport gained notoriety for having been declared the worst in the world; amid this, the construction of a new passenger terminal was underway, which later opened in 2018.

==Other facilities==
The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has its Port Harcourt office on the airport grounds.

<doc id="1264300" wikidata="Q1164281" url="?curid=1264300" title="Mamertines">
<text>The Mamertines (, &quot;sons of Mars&quot;, ) were mercenaries of Italian origin who had been hired from their home in Campania by Agathocles (361–289 BC), Tyrant of Syracuse and self-proclaimed King of Sicily. After Syracuse lost the Seventh Sicilian War, the city of Messina was ceded to Carthage in 307 BC. When Agathocles died in 289 BC it left many of his mercenaries idle and unemployed in Sicily. Most of them returned home but some, liking the climate and the prospect of adventure on a foreign island, remained. They played a major role in the lead-up to the First Punic War.

In 280 BC, the Syracusans appealed to King Pyrrhus of Epirus for help against the Mamertines.

==Capture of Messina==

The then-small band of desperados came across the walled Greek settlement of Messina built on a strategic location on the north-eastern tip of Sicily on the strait between Sicily and Italy. Together with the fort Rhegium on the toe of Italy, it was the crossing point between Italy and Sicily. Being a peaceful people, the inhabitants allowed the travelling mercenaries into their homes. After a time, the mercenaries became restless and plotted to capture the town. One night, the mercenaries betrayed their hosts and killed most of the population, who were unprepared. In this way, they claimed Messina for themselves in 288 BC. The surviving Messinians were thrown out and the property and women divided. After their victory, the mercenaries named themselves the Mamertines after the Oscan war-god Mamers.

==Dominion over northeastern Sicily==

The Mamertines held the town of Messina for over 20 years. They changed it from a bustling town of farmers and traders to a raiding base. The Mamertines became pirates on land and sea. Taking advantage of the war-weary Sicilians, they looted the nearby settlements and captured trade ships on the strait, carrying their plunder back to their base. They captured prisoners and demanded tribute. During this period, they struck coins featuring their name and images of their gods and goddesses. Their exploits made them rich and powerful. They began travelling further inland, even as far as Gela, and demanding tribute.

==Decline==
The Mamertine presence did not go unchallenged forever. In around 270 BC, the Mamertine exploits came to the attention of Syracuse, by word of the refugees from the settlements. Hiero II, tyrant of Syracuse, began to gather an army of citizens with which to rid the land of the destroyers of the peace and rescue his Greek kinsmen. Hiero met with the Mamertines when they were nearing Syracuse. Marching out his troops, he first sent his unruly mercenaries forward and allowed them to be butchered by the Mamertines. The faithless part of his army disposed of, Hiero marched his citizen soldiers back to the city where he drilled them to a better fighting condition. Leading his confident army north, he found the Mamertines again at the Longanus River on the plain of Mylae where he easily defeated them, and proclaimed himself king. The Mamertines were not accustomed to large pitched battles and had become reckless after beating Hiero&#x27;s mercenaries. In the battle, Hiero captured the Mamertine leaders and the remnants fled back to the safety of Messina. Hiero had restricted the Mamertine activity and placed them in a dire situation.

When Hiero returned to besiege their base at Messina in 265 BC, the Mamertines called for help from a nearby fleet from Carthage, which occupied the harbour of Messina. Seeing this, the Syracuse forces retired, not wishing to confront Carthaginian forces. Uncomfortable under the Carthaginian &quot;protection,&quot; the Mamertines now appealed to Rome to be allowed into the protection of the Roman people. At first, the Romans did not wish to come to the aid of soldiers who had unjustly stolen a city from its rightful possessors. However, unwilling to see Carthaginian power spread further over Sicily and get too close to Italy, Rome responded by entering into an alliance with the Mamertines. In response, Syracuse allied itself with Carthage, imploring their protection. With Rome and Carthage brought into conflict, the Syracuse/Mamertine conflict escalated into the First Punic War.

==Legacy==

Once the scale of the conflict had escalated beyond them, the Mamertines were lost to the historical record and their fate is lost, swallowed up in the larger events of the Punic wars. After the First Punic War, however, their name was not quite forgotten in the ancient world since &quot;Mamertine wine&quot; from the vineyards of north-eastern tip of Sicily was still known and enjoyed in the 1st century. It was the favourite of Julius Caesar and it was he who made it popular after serving it at a feast to celebrate his third consulship.

Even centuries after the Mamertine occupation, the inhabitants of Messina were still called Mamertines.

In his novel &quot;Salammbô&quot;, Gustave Flaubert writes of the Greeks singing the &#x27;old song of the Mamertines&#x27;: &quot;With my lance and sword I plough and reap; I am master of the house! The disarmed man falls at my feet and calls me Lord and Great King.&quot;

<text>New Norway is a hamlet located in central Alberta, Canada within Camrose County. Named in 1895, it is located on Highway 21, approximately southeast of Edmonton and southwest of Camrose.

New Norway is home to a number of small businesses, and has an elementary and secondary school, local fire protection and municipal services provided by Camrose County.

== History ==
In 1892, travelling first on the newly constructed Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) line, the Ole M. Olstad family disembarked in Wetaskiwin and made their way to the Duhamel settlement, which had been established for some years. The family quickly filed &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; homesteads a few miles south for themselves and several relatives and friends in the United States. In addition, they purchased available CPR land for $3.00 per acre ($7.41/ha).

For a time the area was known as the &quot;Olstead District&quot;. However, as other Norwegian families (along with those of other nationalities) settled in the area, the name changed to New Norway around 1895. By 1903 the fledgling community had a school, general store, and a blacksmith shop to its credit.

In the fall of 1909, in anticipation of the new Grand Trunk Pacific rail line being built nearby, the community was moved (by the use of skids and seven oxen) to its present location NW-11-45-21-W4 (see Dominion Land Survey). According to the &quot;Camrose Canadian&quot;, the townsite of New Norway was put on sale on October 14, 1909, with 14 businesses filing an intent to establish within the first month. Commercial lots sold from $100 to $250, and residential lots were priced from $50 to $150.

New Norway incorporated as a village on May 6, 1910, and its first council was elected on May 9, 1910, with Norman M. Smith, James F. Willows and Evan O. Olstad serving.

Over a century later, the Village of New Norway was dissolved to hamlet status under the jurisdiction of Camrose County effective November 1, 2012.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, New Norway had a population of 307 living in 129 of its 138 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 320. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

As a designated place in the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, New Norway had a population of 320 living in 126 of its 136 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 278. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

<doc id="1264313" wikidata="Q547438" url="?curid=1264313" title="Skids (band)">
<text>Skids are a Scottish punk rock and new wave band, formed in Dunfermline in 1977 by Stuart Adamson (guitar, keyboards, percussion and backing vocals), William Simpson (bass guitar and backing vocals), Thomas Kellichan (drums) and Richard Jobson (vocals, guitar and keyboards). Their biggest successes were the 1979 single &quot;Into the Valley&quot; and the 1980 album &quot;The Absolute Game.&quot; In 2016, the band announced a 40th-anniversary tour of the UK with their original singer Richard Jobson.

==History==
===Early years (1977–1979)===
Skids played their first gig on 19 August 1977 at the Bellville Hotel in Pilmuir Street, Dunfermline, Scotland. Within six months they had released the &quot;Charles&quot; EP on the label No Bad records. The record brought them to the attention of national BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. This led to a local gig supporting The Clash. Virgin Records then signed up Skids in April 1978. The singles &quot;Sweet Suburbia&quot; and &quot;The Saints Are Coming&quot; both made commercial inroads, before &quot;Into the Valley&quot; reached the top 10 in the UK Singles Chart in early 1979. The band released their debut studio album, &quot;Scared to Dance&quot;, the same year. It was recorded at The Townhouse Studios in London, England with production and keyboards by David Batchelor. Adamson walked out towards the end of the sessions before all the guitar overdubs were completed. Session guitarist Chris Jenkins was chief maintenance engineer at Townhouse Studios and completed the album using Adamson&#x27;s studio set up, adding additional guitar to four tracks – &quot;Into the Valley&quot;, &quot;Integral Plot&quot;, &quot;Calling the Tune&quot; and &quot;Scared to Dance&quot;. In the meantime, Adamson returned to Scotland when the recording was finished. He rejoined the band for the live concert tour promotion of the album. The record included &quot;The Saints Are Coming&quot;, which was later covered in late 2006 as a charity single by U2 and Green Day.

Skids enjoyed a further year of chart success as &quot;Masquerade&quot; and &quot;Working for the Yankee Dollar&quot; reached the top 20 in the UK chart. The latter came from their second album, also released in 1979, &quot;Days in Europa&quot;, with the record&#x27;s production and keyboards by Bill Nelson. Just before recording of the album commenced, Kellichan left the band and was temporarily replaced on drums by Rusty Egan (ex-Rich Kids, then with the band Visage and a New Romantic 1980s dance DJ at the Blitz club). Egan played on the album and later on the live concert tour of the record. Keyboard player Alistair Moore also temporarily joined the band to perform live with them. He had been recruited to play Bill Nelson&#x27;s keyboard parts from the record. In November 1979, Mike Baillie, ex-Insect Bites, was recruited as a permanent band member, taking care of the drums, backing vocals and percussion). He slowly took over from Egan, while the band was still touring &quot;Days in Europa&quot;. Some of Jobson&#x27;s lyrics as well as the album cover caused controversy. It showed an Olympian being crowned with laurels by an Aryan-looking woman, and the lettering was in Gothic script. Some, including DJ John Peel, felt that this glorified Nazi ideology and it was indeed similar to posters from the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Germany. After the original version of the album had already been released, Canadian record producer Bruce Fairbairn was brought into the project. The original cover and the track &quot;Pros and the Cons&quot; were removed. The sleeve was completely re-designed and the song &quot;Masquerade&quot; added. The album was also remixed and the tracks re-sequenced. This second version was released in 1980. One updated track, &quot;The Olympian&quot;, was released on a flexi-disc single as a free gift with a March 1980 issue of &quot;Smash Hits&quot;.

===&quot;The Absolute Game&quot;, &quot;Joy&quot; and break-up (1980–1982)===
In February 1980, one of Skids&#x27; founding members, William Simpson, left and was replaced by Russell Webb (bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards, percussion, and guitar). Webb joined as a permanent band member and immediately started work on the recording of the band&#x27;s third album &quot;The Absolute Game&quot;, released in 1980 and produced by Mick Glossop. It proved to be the band&#x27;s most commercial release, reaching the top 10 of the UK Albums Chart and contained the minor hit single &quot;Circus Games&quot;. A few of the tracks on the album also included a collection of fourteen adult and child backing vocalists, along with a lone didgeridoo player. Initial copies of &quot;The Absolute Game&quot; came with a free limited edition, second album entitled &quot;Strength Through Joy&quot;, echoing the band&#x27;s previous controversial themes. Jobson claims to have got the title from Dirk Bogarde&#x27;s autobiography.

Soon after the release and live concert tour of &quot;The Absolute Game&quot; Baillie left the band, shortly followed by Adamson (but Adamson did stay around long enough to play on one more song for the next album, &quot;Joy&quot;, called &quot;Iona&quot;). Baillie moved back to Scotland to live and Adamson went on to launch his new band, Big Country. This left Jobson and Webb to write and record the band&#x27;s fourth and final album &quot;Joy&quot;, which Russell Webb also produced. The pair played multiple instruments on the album, and also invited a collection of seventeen musical friends to perform on various tracks with them. Skids dissolved in 1982, with the compilation &quot;Fanfare&quot; posthumously issued by Virgin. It was a mixture of most of the band&#x27;s singles and some B-sides, though it omitted any tracks from the &quot;Joy&quot; period.

Jobson and Webb then went on to form a new band called The Armoury Show. The group recorded just one album, &quot;Waiting for the Floods&quot; in 1985 before splitting up. Jobson went on to pursue a solo career as a poet, songwriter, television presenter and most recently, as a film director. He released albums on the Belgian record label Les Disques du Crepuscule and the UK&#x27;s own Parlophone Records. Webb proposed a solo career and, according to Armoury Show fan page, later joined Public Image Ltd in 1992 (but played only on their last tour), and is now a video game designer.

===Reunion concerts, &quot;Burning Cities&quot;===
In 2007, Richard Jobson, William Simpson and Mike Baillie, along with Bruce Watson (guitar and backing vocals), Jamie Watson (guitar), Brian Jobson (backing vocals) and Jane Button (backing vocals), got together to play three gigs. They were to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the group&#x27;s formation and as a final tribute to Stuart Adamson, who had died in 2001. The shows on 4 and 5 July were at Dunfermline&#x27;s Glen Pavilion (where they were supported by Rosyth band The Draymin), outside which Skids had previously played only their second gig, according to Jobson, and on 7 July at the T in the Park festival.

Skids returned to the stage on 28 November 2009 as one of the headlining acts in Homecoming Live, a series of gigs held around the SECC complex in Glasgow to celebrate the end of the Year of Homecoming in Scotland. The line-up mirrored the 2007 gigs, with members of The Gospel Truth Choir joining Button on backing vocals for &quot;A Woman in Winter&quot; and &quot;Working for the Yankee Dollar&quot;.

The same line-up performed a concert on 5 March 2010 at the ABC in Glasgow, with support from The Law and Bruce &amp; Jamie Watson, and lastly a concert on 6 March 2010 at the Alhambra Theatre, Dunfermline with support from Beatnic Prestige and Bruce &amp; Jamie Watson. This final concert was to conclude a week of events celebrating the works, past and present, of Richard Jobson as part of The Fifer Festival 2010 on 6 March 2010.

The band undertook another reunion tour in 2017 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of their formation. It had a more extensive set of venues than the 2007 reunion with concerts throughout the UK and Ireland, and headlining the 2017 Rebellion Festival on the final night. The lineup included Richard Jobson, Bill Simpson, Mike Baillie, Bruce Watson and Jamie Watson.

In 2018 &quot;Burning Cities&quot; included four songs co-written by Martin Metcalfe, formerly of Goodbye Mr Mackenzie. The album reached number 28 in the UK Albums Chart.

===&quot;Songs from a Haunted Ballroom&quot;===
After issuing an acoustic album in 2019, the band (including Big Country&#x27;s Bruce and Jamie Watson) returned in 2021 with a covers album called &quot;Songs from a Haunted Ballroom&quot;. The album was recorded as a tribute to a music venue called the Kinema Ballroom in Dunfermline, Scotland (opened in 1938 but now the Kinema Restaurant Global Fusion Buffet) and features covers of tracks by The Clash, The Adverts, Sex Pistols, Magazine and Ultravox! as well as re-recordings of their own &quot;The Saints Are Coming&quot; and &quot;Into the Valley&quot;.

===&quot;Destination Düsseldorf&quot;===

A new album, &quot;Destination Düsseldorf&quot;, has been announced for March 2023, then postponed to 30 June.

On 27 September 2023 Richard Jobson released a statement on the bands official website announcing that for the foreseeable future Bruce and Jamie Watson would be stepping down to focus on their work with Big Country. Replacing them would be long time collaborators and friends Martin Metcalfe and Fin Wilson (The Filthy Tongues). Both had written material for the recent albums Burning Cities and Destination Düsseldorf. Nick Hernandez continues on drums and Dunfermline born Connor Whyte takes over on guitar.

The changes allow the Skids to honour upcoming tours of the UK, Australia and Europe.

<doc id="1264322" wikidata="Q702017" url="?curid=1264322" title="1994 German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in Germany on 16 October 1994 to elect the members of the 13th Bundestag. The CDU/CSU alliance led by Helmut Kohl remained the largest faction in parliament, with Kohl remaining Chancellor in a narrowly re-elected coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FDP). This elected Bundestag was the largest in history until 2017, numbering 672 members.

Even though this election did not lead to a switch in government, it saw the election of many people to the Bundestag who would play an important role later. Future CDU leaders Friedrich Merz and Armin Laschet were first elected to the Bundestag in 1994, as were future cabinet ministers Norbert Röttgen and Peter Altmaier. This was the last election until 2009 that a centre-right government was elected.

==Issues and campaign==
The Social Democratic Party (SPD) let its members elect a candidate for chancellor against Helmut Kohl after SPD leader Björn Engholm and chancellor candidate-designate had to resign in 1993 amid scandal. Rudolf Scharping, Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate, beat Gerhard Schröder and Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul in the SPD&#x27;s internal election. Scharping was only elected with 40 percent of the vote and relied on campaigning with other SPD leaders and rivals such as Oskar Lafontaine and Gerhard Schröder, both self-confident and outspoken, in a &quot;troika&quot;. Tension between them greatly hurt his campaign. In addition, Scharping was seen as a weak leader due to his lack of charisma and media skills, and therefore did not induce a lot of enthusiasm.

For the first time in their existence, Alliance 90/The Greens seemed to be willing to join a government in case a centre-left SPD–Greens coalition had a workable majority in the Bundestag.

The election also saw a &quot;red socks&quot; campaign used by the centre-right, including the CDU/CSU and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), to scare off a possible red–red–green coalition (SPD–Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS)–Greens). Analysts have stated that such a strategy likely paid off, as it was seen as one of the decisive elements for the narrow victory of Kohl for the CDU/CSU–FDP. The campaign was criticized as an obvious attempt to discredit the whole political left; the PDS reinterpreted it for itself by printing red socks.

==Results==


===Results by state===
Second vote (&quot;Zweitstimme&quot;, or votes for party list)

==== Constituency seats ====
==== List seats ====
== Post-election ==
The coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP was able to continue in power with Helmut Kohl as chancellor.

The PDS won four constituency seats in its power base of the former East Berlin, qualifying it for proportional representation even though the party won 4.4 percent of the vote, just short of the 5% electoral threshold required for full parliamentary status. Under a longstanding electoral law intended to benefit regional parties, any party that wins at least three constituency seats is entitled to its share of proportionally-elected seats, regardless of vote share.

This was the first time in the history of the Federal Republic that the FDP was not the third-largest party in the chamber.

<text>James Paget University Hospital is at Gorleston-on-Sea, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England, on the A47 Lowestoft Road. It is managed by the James Paget University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

==History==
The hospital, which replaced Great Yarmouth General Hospital and Gorleston-on-Sea Cottage Hospital, opened on 21 July 1982. It was named after Sir James Paget an English surgeon and pathologist who was born in Great Yarmouth and is best remembered for naming Paget&#x27;s disease.
The Louise Hamilton Centre, which was built to provide palliative care for people with cancer and other life-limiting and progressive illnesses, was officially opened by Princess Anne in April 2013.

== Services ==
James Paget University Hospital provides a full range of clinical services for a population of 230,000 residents across Great Yarmouth, Lowestoft, and Waveney.

==Performance==
In March 2007, there was an outbreak of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; at the hospital which killed 17 people. In December 2010 and into 2011, the hospital was put on black alert as it saw a rise in patient numbers. Patients were urged to relieve pressure on the hospital by seeking treatment elsewhere such as at pharmacies, GP surgeries and Minor Injury Units.
In March 2011, the hospital had an outbreak of group A streptococcal infection which resulted in the death of a patient. As a preventative measure, staff and patients were screened. In June 2011, a Care Quality Commission inspection found that the hospital was in the moderate concern category with respect to meeting the needs of some patients in nutritional and patient dignity standards. The inspection followed allegations that the care of some elderly patients was lacking in some respects earlier during the year. In August 2012 the Care Quality Commission published a report mentioning one remaining minor concern about the hospital&#x27;s record-keeping. Compliance in record-keeping meant that the hospital was now fully compliant on all the care standards.
The Trust was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time, it had 2511 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 3.25%. 65% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 64% recommended it as a place to work.

<doc id="1264353" wikidata="Q637080" url="?curid=1264353" title="Tantalite">
<text>The mineral group tantalite [(Fe, Mn)Ta2O6] is the primary source of the chemical element tantalum, a corrosion (heat and acid) resistant metal. It is chemically similar to &quot;columbite&quot;, and the two are often grouped together as a semi-singular mineral called coltan or &quot;columbite-tantalite&quot; in many mineral guides. However, tantalite has a much greater specific gravity than columbite (8.0+ compared to columbite&#x27;s 5.2). Iron-rich tantalite is the mineral tantalite-(Fe) or &quot;ferrotantalite&quot; and manganese-rich is tantalite-(Mn) or &quot;manganotantalite&quot;.

Tantalite is also very close to &quot;tapiolite&quot;. Those minerals have the same chemical composition, but different crystal symmetry: orthorhombic for tantalite and tetragonal for tapiolite.

Tantalite is black to brown in both color and streak. Manganese-rich tantalites can be brown and translucent.

==Occurrence==

Tantalite occurs in granitic pegmatites that are rich in rare-elements, and in placer deposits derived from such rocks. It has been found in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia (Guainía and Vichada), Egypt, northern Europe, Madagascar, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, The Democratic Republic of Congo, the United States (California, Colorado, Maine, and Virginia), and Zimbabwe. Brazil has the world&#x27;s largest reserve of tantalite (52.1%).

==Applications==
The tantalum metal extracted from tantalite is used in alloys for strength and higher melting points, in glass to increase the index of refraction, and in surgical steel, as it is non-reactive and non-irritating to body tissues. Much like glass, it is not suitable for use in hydrofluoric acid and strong hot alkali applications.

==Sustainability==
The mining of tantalite causes many environmental and social problems in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

<doc id="1264354" wikidata="Q704648" url="?curid=1264354" title="1990 German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in recently united Germany on 2 December 1990 to elect the members of the 12th Bundestag, within the regular time of nearly four years after the January 1987 West German federal election. Due to the accession of the former East German states on 3 October, after which the Bundestag was expanded with East German Volkskammer delegates, the elections were first democratic all-German elections since the early 1930s.

The result was a comprehensive victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his governing coalition of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), which was reelected to a third term (and a fourth in 1994). The &quot;second vote&quot; (preferred national party, &quot;first vote&quot; is for a local candidate) result of the CDU/CSU, 20,358,096 votes, remains the highest ever total vote count in a democratic German election.

The elections marked the first since 1957 that a party other than CDU/CSU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) won a constituency seat (Direktmandat), breaking up the dominance of the two &quot;Volksparteien&quot;. The first (and only) time since 1957 that FDP won a constituency seat was by Uwe Lühr in Halle, home of Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the &quot;architect of German reunification&quot;. In addition, Gregor Gysi (PDS) won Berlin-Marzahn – Hellersdorf.

==Campaign==

This was the first election conducted after German reunification which took place on 3 October. Previously, the had selected 144 of its members which were then co-opted as Members of the German Bundestag and served until the end of the 11th Bundestag.

Almost 150 seats had been added to represent the re-established eastern states of Germany, without reducing the number of western members. The euphoria following the reunification gave the ruling CDU/CSU–FDP coalition a dramatic advantage in both Western and Eastern Germany throughout the campaign.

For this election only, the country was divided into two areas for the purposes of the five-percent threshold: the former West German states and West Berlin, and the former East German states and East Berlin. Second votes were counted separately in each area, and passing the threshold in either area was sufficient to enter the Bundestag and receive list seats. As a result, while the Western Greens (4.8% of western second votes) did not gain representation, their ideologically-similar Eastern Alliance 90 (6.2% of eastern second votes) did, with both merging to form Alliance 90/The Greens in 1993. The Party of Democratic Socialism also entered the Bundestag with 11.1% of eastern second votes, despite receiving just 0.3% of the western second vote (and only 2.4% nationwide). However, the distribution of seats to state lists was not divided in this manner and still calculated on the national level, which resulted in the PDS receiving a list seat (Ulla Jelpke) in the most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

The German Social Union (DSU) under leader Hansjoachim Walther, a right-wing party modeled after the Bavarian CSU running only in former East Germany, failed to achieve the separate 5% threshold, only receiving around 1% of the vote in the eastern states, mostly in the southeast. As part of the co-option, the DSU had previously had eight Members of the Bundestag, who sat as guests in the CDU/CSU caucus. The CSU, which had heavily supported the DSU financially, severed its ties in 1993 and the party fell into irrelevancy. After a law allowing a linkage of the lists of the CSU and DSU was overturned by the Federal Constitutional Court, the CSU tried to convince the CDU to stand down in several single-member constituencies to enable the DSU to enter the Bundestag separate from the 5% threshold, but Kohl adamantly refused.

==Results==
All change figures are relative to the pre-existing West German Bundestag.


===Results by state===

<text>Al Palladini (December 24, 1943 – March 7, 2001) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2001, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris.

==Background==
Palladini was born in Prossedi, Italy. He was the owner of Al Palladini&#x27;s Pine Tree Lincoln Mercury automobile dealership in Woodbridge, Ontario becoming locally famous for the slogan, &quot;Any Palladini is a pal of mine&quot; in a series of ads conceived by CHUM Radio&#x27;s Larry MacInnis, and voiced by a young Rick Moranis when he was an announcer at CHUM FM radio in Toronto. He was named Canadian World Auto Marketer of the Year in 1994, and was the Vaughan Outstanding Business Achievement Award the same year. Palladini also served as Chair of the York-Finch General Hospital Foundation, and was a Director of the York University Scholarship Alliance Board.

==Politics==
He was elected in the riding of York Centre in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Mario Ferri by more than 8,000 votes (the riding had previously been held by high-profile Liberal Greg Sorbara). On June 26, 1995, he was named Minister of Transportation. Following a cabinet shuffle on October 10, 1997, he was named Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism.

Palladini was re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Tony Genco by about 7,500 votes in the redistributed riding of Vaughan—King—Aurora. After the election, his portfolio was renamed &quot;Economic Development and Trade&quot;.

In office, Palladini presented himself as a populist while presenting legislation which reduced government services. He was often accused of anti-intellectualism. When he cut back on snowplowing budgets for provincial highways, he suggested that stranded drivers could simply use their cell phones to call for help.

===Cabinet posts===

==Resignation and death==
Palladini resigned from cabinet on February 7, 2001, citing personal difficulties. One month later, he unexpectedly died of a heart attack on a golf course while vacationing in Mexico.

==Legacy==
His son Franco and family continued to operate his car dealership for several years until bankruptcy in 2009. There is a community centre named Al Palladini Community Centre in Woodbridge, in his honour.

Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Energy, Stephen Lecce, gives Al Palladini credit for launching his political career through his effort on his 1999 re-election campaign.

<doc id="1264368" wikidata="Q2469707" url="?curid=1264368" title="Neil Mellor">
<text>Neil Andrew Mellor (born 4 November 1982) is an English retired professional footballer who played as a striker. He began his career at Liverpool in the Premier League. He made his name in 2004 by scoring a stunning last-minute goal from long range to give Liverpool a 2–1 victory over Arsenal at Anfield. Mellor also scored a vital goal and set up another during Liverpool&#x27;s match with Olympiacos at Anfield during the group stage of the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, which Liverpool went on to win. He later played for Preston North End. In December 2011, a knee injury sustained following a tackle by Milton Keynes striker Jabo Ibehre resulted in Mellor being forced into announcing his retirement on 9 May 2012. Since his retirement, Mellor has been doing media work, including match updates for Sky Sports News and work for LFC TV.

==Career==

===Liverpool===
The son of former Manchester City, Norwich City, Sheffield Wednesday and Brighton and Hove Albion player Ian Mellor, Mellor was born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. A strong, physical, centre forward, Mellor was top scorer in Liverpool&#x27;s run to the FA Youth Cup semi-final during the 2000–01 season scoring eight goals in four games. He was also the top scorer for the under-19 team and Joe Corrigan&#x27;s reserves during the 2001–02 season and in total scored 46 goals (56 including friendlies). Mellor progressed through the ranks at Liverpool and in the 2002–03 season he scored 20 goals for the reserve team. He made his first team debut in the same season and played a total of six games and scored in a League Cup semi-final match against Sheffield United. Although the Reds lost the match 2–1, Mellor showed promise and was rewarded in March 2003 with a new three-year contract running to 2006. Despite his goal he was left out of the squad for the victorious 2003 Football League Cup Final.

Manager Gérard Houllier sent Mellor on a year-long loan to West Ham United in August 2003. He scored two goals in the 3–0 win over Crystal Palace at the end of September, but an injury hit spell at Upton Park, in addition to playing under three different managers and being forced to play out of position, proved unsettling. Mellor was soon back at Anfield and hit 10 goals in just four games for the reserves. Before the start of the 2004–05 season, Mellor suffered a knee injury but regained fitness and a return to the first team in the 3–0 League Cup victory at Millwall. In the next round he scored two goals to knock out holders Middlesbrough, and in late November he started a UEFA Champions League game at Monaco.

After becoming a fixture in first team squad, Mellor burst into the starting team with some style. With Liverpool and Arsenal level at 1–1 with 90 minutes gone at Anfield in November 2004, he cracked in a sensational 30-yard volley to win the game for Liverpool. Things got better still for Mellor ten days later when Liverpool were being held 1–1 by Olympiacos in a game they had to win by two clear goals to progress to the Champions League knock out stages. He was brought into the game to replace Milan Baroš and within two minutes, he scored with a typical goal poacher&#x27;s finish. Then, a cushioned header from Mellor set up Steven Gerrard to rifle in the third Liverpool goal and seal Liverpool&#x27;s place in the last 16. He scored his second and what proved to be his final league goal for Liverpool in December 2004 in the 3–1 win over Newcastle at Anfield.

In March 2005, Mellor was ruled out for the remainder of the 2004–05 season after undergoing surgery on both knees. This robbed the young striker of his chance of European glory as his teammates succeeded in bringing a fifth European cup back to Anfield. Although Mellor played no part in the knock out stages, his contribution to that year&#x27;s success was massive. Mellor returned to action for the Liverpool reserve side in the 2005–06 season coming on as a substitute in their 2–0 victory at Manchester United in December 2005. He was back on the scoresheet in his first start in a year as Liverpool cruised into the quarter-finals of the Liverpool Senior Cup after a 3–0 win over Runcorn.

In January 2006, Mellor joined Wigan Athletic on loan for the remainder of the season. In his first match against Middlesbrough, he scored the winner during injury time in a 3–2 victory. However, further knee injuries that required more surgery ended his spell at Wigan after three games.

In 2006, despite a relative lack of first-team football at Liverpool, Mellor was voted into 90th position in a poll to find 100 Players Who Shook the Kop, ahead of such players as Mohamed Sissoko and Nigel Clough.

After his retirement from professional football, Mellor returned to Liverpool to do media and commentary work with their in-house television company LFC TV.

===Preston North End===
In August 2006, Mellor signed a three-year contract with Football League Championship club Preston North End for an undisclosed fee, thought to be in the region of £1.5m. Manager Paul Simpson said, &quot;Neil is a goalscorer and hopefully that will continue to be the case. He is a tremendous signing. He has had his injury problems but we are happy he is over those and it&#x27;s just a case now of building up his fitness levels.&quot; Another knee injury suffered in a pre-season friendly against Bolton Wanderers required more surgery and delayed Mellor&#x27;s debut for Preston. Mellor finally got his first goal for Preston in the 3–1 victory over Southampton in March 2007. Out of favour under the Paul Simpson managerial era, Mellor had to prove himself over again to new P.N.E boss Alan Irvine. Under Irvine, Mellor finally got going and scored nine goals under him after Christmas 2007. Mellor again showed his panache for the 30-yard volley on 30 July 2008 by scoring in similar fashion for Preston North End in their friendly against Motherwell at Fir Park, which earned a 1–1 draw for Preston. During pre-season 2008–09 Mellor scored eight goals.

Despite the promising pre-season and Mellor being a favourite amongst sections of the Deepdale crowd, indifferent form led to him losing his place to new signing Jon Parkin. Mellor regained his place in the team in time to score in Preston&#x27;s 3–1 victory away at local rivals Blackpool, but another injury saw him miss a number of games. He regained fitness for a match against former club Liverpool in the FA Cup 3rd round, which Preston lost 2–0.

Mellor scored his first goal for Preston North End since March 2010 on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, scoring their first goal in a 4–2 defeat to Colchester United at Deepdale. In the December of that season, Mellor picked up a knee injury in the 1–0 win over Milton Keynes and was ruled out for three months. After an injury-plagued season at Preston, Mellor announced his retirement on 9 May 2012.

===Sheffield Wednesday===

On 2 July 2010, Mellor rejoined former manager Alan Irvine at Football League One side Sheffield Wednesday on a season long loan. Mellor played his first league game for The Owls on 7 August 2010 against Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, coming on as a substitute in place of Clinton Morrison. He scored his first professional career hat-trick for Sheffield Wednesday on 10 November 2010 in a 4–1 win at Hillsborough over Hartlepool United in the Football League Trophy. He then repeated this feat just 10 days later in another 4–1 win, this time away against MK Dons in the league.
After he sustained a minor injury against Carlisle United, Mellor struggled to regain form, and rarely started games. Mellor was eventually recalled to first team action against Colchester United in a game where he scored two goals in a 2–1 victory for the Owls. A few days later, he started another home match, this time against Tranmere Rovers setting up two first half goals, before winning a penalty, of which Owls captain Tommy Miller duly converted. Mellor scored the final goal of the match from a tight angle at the 90-minute mark.

<text>Tephroite is the manganese endmember of the olivine group of nesosilicate minerals with the formula Mn2SiO4. A solid solution series exists between tephroite and its analogues, the group endmembers fayalite and forsterite. Divalent iron or magnesium may readily replace manganese in the olivine crystal structure.

It was first described for an occurrence at the Sterling Hill Mine and Franklin, New Jersey, United States. It occurs in iron-manganese ore deposits and their related skarns. It also occurs in metamorphosed manganese-rich sediments. It occurs in association with: zincite, willemite, franklinite, rhodonite, jacobsite, diopside, gageite, bustamite, manganocalcite, glaucochroite, calcite, banalsite and alleghanyite. It can also be found in England and Sweden.

Tephroite has a hardness of 6 and a specific gravity of approximately 4.1, which is heavy for non-metallic minerals. Its name comes from the Greek &quot;tephros&quot;, &quot;ash gray&quot;, for its color. It can also be found olive-green, greenish-blue, pink, or brown. Other names for tephroite include mangan olivine and mangan peridot.

<text>Federal elections were held in West Germany on 25 January 1987 to elect the members of the 11th Bundestag. This was the last federal election held in West Germany before German reunification.

==Issues and campaign==

The SPD nominated Johannes Rau, their vice chairman and the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, as their candidate for Chancellor. However, the SPD suffered from internal divisions and competition with the Greens. It was also unclear as to how they would form a government, as the Greens were divided over whether to take part in governments.

One of the major issues in this election was the environment, after the Chernobyl disaster and other accidents.

==Results==


=== Results by state ===
==== Constituency seats ====
==== List seats ====
==Aftermath==
The coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP returned to government, with Helmut Kohl as Chancellor. The Greens came into parliament for the second time and seemed to be established on federal level.

===Co-option of East German Volkskammer after reunification===
In order to determine the composition of the East German representatives in the Bundestag between German reunification and the first post-reunification elections in December 1990, the results of the 1990 East German general election were recounted, using the new states of Germany as constituencies. This was possible since the original election results were declared on the Kreis level, and the states were re-established by simply amalgamating Kreise together. The results in each Kreis forming a state were summed up to determine the statewide result. The recount fixed the number of Volkskammer members from each party who would be co-opted into the Bundestag elected in 1987. The 22 Non-voting representatives of West Berlin already became full voting members on 8 June 1990, in advance of unification.

<doc id="1264378" wikidata="Q715909" url="?curid=1264378" title="Louis-Léopold Boilly">
<text>Louis-Léopold Boilly (; 5 July 1761 – 4 January 1845) was a French painter and draftsman. A creator of popular portrait paintings, he also produced a vast number of genre paintings documenting French middle-class social life. His life and work spanned the eras of monarchical France, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Empire, the Bourbon Restoration and the July Monarchy. His 1800 painting &quot;Un Trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; introduced the term &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; (&quot;trick the eye&quot;), applied to the technique that uses realistic imagery to create the optical illusion that the depicted objects exist in three dimensions, though the &quot;unnamed&quot; technique itself had existed in Greek and Roman times.

==Life and career==
Boilly was born in La Bassée in northern France, the son of a local wood sculptor. A self-taught painter, Boilly began his career at a very young age, producing his first works at the age of twelve or thirteen. In 1774 he began to show his work to the Augustinians of Douai who were evidently impressed: within three years, the bishop of Arras invited him to work and study in his diocese. While there, he produced a cascade of paintings – some three hundred small works of portraiture. He received instruction in &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; painting from (1743–1820) before moving to Paris around 1787.

At the height of the revolutionary Terror in 1794, Boilly was condemned by the Committee of Public Safety for the erotic undertones of his work. This offence was remedied by Boilly&#x27;s eleventh-hour production of the more patriotic &quot;Triumph of Marat&quot; (now in the Musée des Beaux Arts, Lille) which saved him from serious penalties.

Boilly was a popular and celebrated painter of his time. He was among the first artists to produce lithographs, and became wealthy from the sale of his prints and paintings. He was awarded a medal by the Parisian Salon in 1804 for his work &quot;The Arrival of a Mail-coach in the Courtyard of the Messageries&quot;. In 1833 he was decorated as a &quot;chevalier&quot; of the nation&#x27;s highest order, the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;.

Boilly died in Paris on 4 January 1845. His youngest son, Alphonse Boilly (1801–1867), was a professional engraver who apprenticed in New York with Asher Brown Durand.

==Style and works==

Boilly&#x27;s early works showed a preference for amorous and moralising subjects. &quot;The Suitor&#x27;s Gift&quot; is comparable to much of his work in the 1790s. His small-scale paintings with carefully mannered colouring and precise detailing recalled the work of seventeenth-century Dutch genre painters such as Gabriël Metsu (1629–1667), Willem van Mieris and Gerard ter Borch (1617–1681), of whose work Boilly owned an important collection.

After 1794, Boilly began to produce far more crowded compositions that serve as social chronicles of the urban middle class. In these works, his observation of contemporary customs is slightly sentimental and often humorous.

Boilly was also well respected for his portraiture. By the end of his lifetime he had painted about 5,000 portraits, most of which were painted on canvases measuring 22 cm x 17 cm (8 5/8 in. x 6 5/8 in.). He worked quickly, and boasted of requiring only two hours to complete a portrait. He painted both middle class sitters and prominent contemporaries such as Robespierre. Boilly&#x27;s portraits strongly characterize the sitters as individuals, and are usually painted in a sober range of colors.

Boilly used his great skill in depicting textures to produce numerous illusionistic works, including paintings in grisaille that mimic prints. In the Salon of 1800 he exhibited a painting that depicted layers of overlapping prints, drawings, and papers, covered by a sheet of broken glass in a wooden frame. His title for the work, &quot;Un trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; (&quot;a trick played on the eye&quot;), marked the first use of that term to describe an illusionistic painting. Although art critics derided the painting as a stunt, it caused a popular sensation, and &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; entered the language as a name for an entire genre.

His interest in caricature is most apparent in his suite of 98 lithographs titled &quot;Recueil de grimaces&quot;, published between 1823 and 1828.

Boilly remains a highly regarded master of oil painting. A major exhibition of his work, &quot;The Art of Louis-Léopold Boilly: Modern Life in Napoleonic France&quot;, travelled to the United States where it was shown at both the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth and the National Gallery of Art in Washington (1995). The Musée des Beaux Arts in Lille held a large-scale exhibition of Boilly&#x27;s work during the winter season of 2011–2012.

<doc id="1264398" wikidata="Q1017238" url="?curid=1264398" title="Hyperbolic coordinates">
<text>In mathematics, hyperbolic coordinates are a method of locating points in quadrant I of the Cartesian plane

:formula_1.

Hyperbolic coordinates take values in the hyperbolic plane defined as:

:formula_2.

These coordinates in &quot;HP&quot; are useful for studying logarithmic comparisons of direct proportion in &quot;Q&quot; and measuring deviations from direct proportion.

For formula_3 in formula_4 take

:formula_5

and

:formula_6.

The parameter &quot;u&quot; is the hyperbolic angle to (&quot;x, y&quot;) and &quot;v&quot; is the geometric mean of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

The inverse mapping is

:formula_7.

The function formula_8 is a continuous mapping, but not an analytic function.

==Alternative quadrant metric==
Since &quot;HP&quot; carries the metric space structure of the Poincaré half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry, the bijective correspondence 
formula_9 brings this structure to &quot;Q&quot;. It can be grasped using the notion of hyperbolic motions. Since geodesics in &quot;HP&quot; are semicircles with centers on the boundary, the geodesics in &quot;Q&quot; are obtained from the correspondence and turn out to be rays from the origin or petal-shaped curves leaving and re-entering the origin. And the hyperbolic motion of &quot;HP&quot; given by a left-right shift corresponds to a squeeze mapping applied to &quot;Q&quot;.

Since hyperbolas in &quot;Q&quot; correspond to lines parallel to the boundary of &quot;HP&quot;, they are horocycles in the metric geometry of &quot;Q&quot;.

If one only considers the Euclidean topology of the plane and the topology inherited by &quot;Q&quot;, then the lines bounding &quot;Q&quot; seem close to &quot;Q&quot;. Insight from the metric space &quot;HP&quot; shows that the open set &quot;Q&quot; has only the origin as boundary when viewed through the correspondence. Indeed, consider rays from the origin in &quot;Q&quot;, and their images, vertical rays from the boundary &quot;R&quot; of &quot;HP&quot;. Any point in &quot;HP&quot; is an infinite distance from the point &quot;p&quot; at the foot of the perpendicular to &quot;R&quot;, but a sequence of points on this perpendicular may tend in the direction of &quot;p&quot;. The corresponding sequence in &quot;Q&quot; tends along a ray toward the origin. The old Euclidean boundary of &quot;Q&quot; is no longer relevant.

==Applications in physical science==
Fundamental physical variables are sometimes related by equations of the form &quot;k&quot; = &quot;x y&quot;. For instance, &quot;V&quot; = &quot;I R&quot; (Ohm&#x27;s law), &quot;P&quot; = &quot;V I&quot; (electrical power), &quot;P V&quot; = &quot;k T&quot; (ideal gas law), and &quot;f&quot; λ = &quot;v&quot; (relation of wavelength, frequency, and velocity in the wave medium). When the &quot;k&quot; is constant, the other variables lie on a hyperbola, which is a horocycle in the appropriate &quot;Q&quot; quadrant.

For example, in thermodynamics the isothermal process explicitly follows the hyperbolic path and work can be interpreted as a hyperbolic angle change. Similarly, a given mass &quot;M&quot; of gas with changing volume will have variable density δ = &quot;M / V&quot;, and the ideal gas law may be written &quot;P = k T&quot; δ so that an isobaric process traces a hyperbola in the quadrant of absolute temperature and gas density.

For hyperbolic coordinates in the theory of relativity see the History section.

==Statistical applications==
*Comparative study of population density in the quadrant begins with selecting a reference nation, region, or urban area whose population and area are taken as the point (1,1).
*Analysis of the elected representation of regions in a representative democracy begins with selection of a standard for comparison: a particular represented group, whose magnitude and slate magnitude (of representatives) stands at (1,1) in the quadrant.

==Economic applications==
There are many natural applications of hyperbolic coordinates in economics:
* Analysis of currency exchange rate fluctuation:The unit currency sets formula_10. The price currency corresponds to formula_11. For formula_12 we find formula_13, a positive hyperbolic angle. For a &quot;fluctuation&quot; take a new price formula_14 Then the change in &quot;u&quot; is: formula_15 Quantifying exchange rate fluctuation through hyperbolic angle provides an objective, symmetric, and consistent measure. The quantity formula_16 is the length of the left-right shift in the hyperbolic motion view of the currency fluctuation.
* Analysis of inflation or deflation of prices of a basket of consumer goods.
* Quantification of change in marketshare in duopoly.
* Corporate stock splits versus stock buy-back.

==Trigonometry==

The hyperbolic functions sinh, cosh, and tanh can be illustrated with hyperbolic coordinates. Let
:formula_17
Then BCAO forms a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at formula_18. The hyperbolic cosine is defined as formula_19 so &quot;M&quot; = ( cosh &quot;t&quot;, cosh &quot;t&quot;).

The semi-diagonal MA is equipollent to formula_20. Evidently the diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles. 

The angle MOA is the hyperbolic angle parameter &quot;t&quot; of cosh and sinh, and formula_21 and has a value in (–1, 1).

==History==
The geometric mean is an ancient concept, but hyperbolic angle was developed in this configuration by Gregoire de Saint-Vincent. He was attempting to perform quadrature with respect to the rectangular hyperbola &quot;y&quot; = 1/&quot;x&quot;. That challenge was a standing open problem since Archimedes performed the quadrature of the parabola. The curve passes through (1,1) where it is opposite the origin in a unit square. The other points on the curve can be viewed as rectangles having the same area as this square. Such a rectangle may be obtained by applying a squeeze mapping to the square. Another way to view these mappings is via hyperbolic sectors. Starting from (1,1) the hyperbolic sector of unit area ends at (e, 1/e), where e is 2.71828…, according to the development of Leonhard Euler in &quot;Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite&quot; (1748).

Taking (e, 1/e) as the vertex of rectangle of unit area, and applying again the squeeze that made it from the unit square, yields formula_22 Generally n squeezes yields formula_23 A. A. de Sarasa noted a similar observation of G. de Saint Vincent, that as the abscissas increased in a geometric series, the sum of the areas against the hyperbola increased in arithmetic series, and this property corresponded to the logarithm already in use to reduce multiplications to additions. Euler’s work made the natural logarithm a standard mathematical tool, and elevated mathematics to the realm of transcendental functions. The hyperbolic coordinates are formed on the original picture of G. de Saint-Vincent, which provided the quadrature of the hyperbola, and transcended the limits of algebraic functions.

In 1875 Johann von Thünen published a theory of natural wages which used geometric mean of a subsistence wage and market value of the labor using the employer&#x27;s capital.

In special relativity the focus is on the 3-dimensional hypersurface in the future of spacetime where various velocities arrive after a given proper time. Scott Walter explains that in November 1907 Hermann Minkowski alluded to a well-known three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry while speaking to the Göttingen Mathematical Society, but not to a four-dimensional one.
In tribute to Wolfgang Rindler, the author of a standard introductory university-level textbook on relativity, hyperbolic coordinates of spacetime are called Rindler coordinates.

<text>CKNC-TV (channel 9) was a television station in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The station was in operation from 1971 to 2002 as a private affiliate of CBC Television, and then continued until 2012 as a network-owned rebroadcaster of CBLT in Toronto.

==History==
CKNC was established on October 8, 1971 by J. Conrad Lavigne, the owner of CFCL in Timmins. On the same day, the existing television station in Sudbury, CKSO, switched its affiliation to CTV. A rebroadcaster with the call sign CKNC-TV-1 went to air in Elliot Lake on the same date. That transmitter was sold to the CBC in 1982, although it continued to air CKNC&#x27;s signal for the remainder of the station&#x27;s existence.

Until 1980, CICI and CKNC aggressively competed with each other for advertising dollars, leaving both in a precarious financial position due to the Sudbury market&#x27;s relatively small size. In 1980, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved the merger of the two stations, along with their co-owned stations in North Bay and Timmins, into the MCTV twinstick.

In 1990, the MCTV stations were acquired by Baton Broadcasting, which became the sole corporate owner of CTV in 1997.

In the early 1990s, CKNC-TV decreased its effective radiated power from 168,000 to 115,500 watts; and changing the transmitter location to a new site located approximately 1.5 kilometres to the southwest of the present location. 

===End of operations===
CTV subsequently sold its four CBC affiliates in Northern Ontario, CKNC, CHNB in North Bay, CJIC in Sault Ste. Marie and CFCL in Timmins directly to the CBC in 2002. All four ceased to exist as separate stations on October 27, 2002, becoming rebroadcasters of Toronto&#x27;s CBLT, with CKNC&#x27;s call sign changing to CBLT-6. These transmitters would close on July 31, 2012, due to budget cuts affecting the CBC.

==Transmitters==
==Other notes==
CKNC was also the original callsign, in the 1920s and 1930s, of a radio station in Toronto that now uses the callsign CJBC. The CKNC currently belongs to a radio station in Simcoe, Ontario, as CKNC-FM.

<text>Federal elections were held in West Germany on 6 March 1983 to elect the members of the 10th Bundestag. The CDU/CSU alliance led by Helmut Kohl remained the largest faction in parliament, with Kohl remaining Chancellor.

==Issues and campaign==
The SPD/FDP coalition under Chancellor Helmut Schmidt was returned to power in the 1980 West German federal election. The coalition parties grew more and more apart over economic policies. Schmidt asked for and won a motion of no confidence on 5 February 1982. The FDP cabinet ministers resigned on 17 September 1982 and the SPD formed a minority government. On 1 October, Schmidt and the SPD government were dismissed from office by a constructive vote of no confidence by the votes of the CDU/CSU Union parties and a majority of the FDP deputies in the Bundestag. The Leader of the Christian Democratic Union and Leader of the CDU/CSU Group in the Bundestag Helmut Kohl succeeded Schmidt. The new coalition had a majority in the Bundestag but early elections were arranged to legitimize it. Neither the Bundestag itself nor the Chancellor has a right to dissolve the Bundestag, so Kohl did this by deliberately losing a vote of no confidence on 17 December 1982. Federal President Karl Carstens then dissolved the Bundestag and held new elections. The Federal Constitutional Court upheld the constitutionality of the dissolution.

The FDP was split by its change of coalition partners. The party leadership under Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Otto Graf Lambsdorff drove the new policy, but they were rejected by a minority under Gerhart Baum, Günter Verheugen and Ingrid Matthäus-Maier. The FDP was defeated in the 1982 Hessian state election on 26 September 1982, losing half its voters by gaining only 3.1 percent of the vote and failing to enter the state parliament thanks to an SPD campaign against the FDP&#x27;s &quot;betrayal in Bonn&quot;. The FDP was defeated again and lost all of its seats in the 1982 Bavarian state election on 10 October 1982.

Helmut Schmidt renounced his chancellor candidacy and was replaced by former Federal Minister of Justice Hans-Jochen Vogel. The SPD encountered difficulties because of the emergence of the Greens. A major issue in this election was the armament question after the NATO Double-Track Decision, something the SPD was deeply split on.

==Results==

== Post-election ==
The coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP returned to government, gaining 55.7% of the vote and 55.8% of the seats, with Helmut Kohl as Chancellor. This was the first election in which the Greens secured representation in the Bundestag, and the first which saw a fourth (fifth) party in the parliament since 1960.

<doc id="1264426" wikidata="Q7753766" url="?curid=1264426" title="The New 3 Stooges">
<text>The New 3 Stooges is an American animated television series that ran during the 1965–66 television season starring the Three Stooges. The show follows the trio&#x27;s antics both in live-action and animated segments. The cast consisted of Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Joe DeRita (as Curly-Joe), with actor and close friend Emil Sitka co-starring, as well as Margaret Kerry. The stories took place in varied settings, including Newport Beach and sailing as buccaneers on the Spanish Main.

==Production==
Forty-one live-action sequences were executively overseen by cartoonist Norman Maurer, son-in-law of Moe Howard, serving as their film agent during this period. Additionally, Edward Bernds, who directed the team at Columbia Pictures from 1945 to 1952 (predominantly during the Shemp era), was enlisted to both script and direct the series. Emil Sitka, a familiar figure from numerous Stooges comedies, was slated to feature in these wraparound segments, assuming the role of a straight man to the Stooges.

Under the auspices of Cambria Studios, 156 short Stooge cartoons were produced, under the supervision of Lee Orgel. Notably, four cartoons were meticulously crafted to thematically align with each of the 40 live-action Stooge opening and closing sequences. Consequently, a single live-action segment could seamlessly transition as a wraparound for four distinct cartoons. However, this format posed a challenge for viewers, as articulated by Joe DeRita:

The majority of the cartoons culminated with the trio fleeing into the horizon following inadvertent chaos at their various employments and ensuing predicaments. Remarkably, these cartoons diverged from Cambria&#x27;s customary employment of Syncro-Vox, a patented technique involving filmed footage of voice actors&#x27; mouths over still frames. The inaugural cartoon, &quot;That Little Old Bomb Maker&quot;, featured a distinctive live-action wraparound that remained exclusive to that particular cartoon.

A number of the cartoons featured recurring characters, such as Badman, a juvenile antagonist sporting a Batman-esque attire, who paradoxically is a benevolent 5-year-old boy. Another recurring character was the western outlaw named Getoutoftownbysundown Brown.

To preclude potential licensing entanglements, Cambria abstained from employing any of the Stooges&#x27; theme songs, including &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; and &quot;Listen to the Mockingbird&quot;, despite their lapse into the public domain. Similarly, the on-screen titling employed a numeral &quot;3&quot; to circumvent potential infringement on any trademark held by Columbia Pictures regarding the name &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;.

&quot;The New 3 Stooges&quot; represented a subsequent endeavor at animating the trio. In the late 1950s, Norman Maurer sought to market &quot;Stooge Time&quot;, a hybrid live-action/rotoscope animation half-hour series for television. In 1960, Maurer and the Stooges filmed a pilot for &quot;The Three Stooges Scrapbook&quot;, a half-hour series incorporating a five-minute Stooge cartoon. The Stooges later revisited animated form for Hanna-Barbera, contributing to two episodes of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; (1972–74) and the series &quot;The Robonic Stooges&quot; (1977–78), the latter developed posthumously following the demise of both Moe Howard and Larry Fine.

==Lawsuit==
The series posed significant financial challenges for the Stooges. Per the terms of their contract, Cambria Studios&#x27; distributor was obligated to furnish quarterly financial statements to the trio, ensuring transparency regarding the show&#x27;s earnings. However, Norman Maurer recalled receiving only one or two statements throughout a span of five years, precipitating legal action. In the ensuing lawsuit, the presiding judge, lacking substantial familiarity with the intricacies of the film and television industry, ruled in favor of Cambria.

Undeterred, the Stooges pursued an appeal in 1975, ultimately securing a favorable verdict. Nonetheless, this legal triumph failed to rectify the distributor&#x27;s persistent failure to furnish requisite profit statements to Normandy Productions. By the time the litigation concluded, both Moe and Larry had passed away.

==Home media==
Several episodes are currently available on VHS and DVD (often in cheap &quot;dollar packages&quot; with the cartoons and live action sequences being in poor quality) as the majority of the series fell into the public domain.

Using the original 16mm acetates, Rhino Entertainment issued a restored version in 2002 of 28 live action segments, and 32 of the cartoons over two volumes. Each volume contains a Spanish audio option, and Volume one has a near 7 minute retrospective interview with Lee Orgel. During it, he mentions only 39 live action segments being produced which added confusion to some claims of there being 40 or 41. 

In 2004, EastWest DVD released a slim case volume of episodes. In 2007 and 2008, Mill Creek Entertainment released a number of episodes as part of their &quot;Ultimate 150 Cartoon Festival&quot;, their &quot;Giant 600 Cartoon Collection&quot; and their &quot;200 Classic Cartoons – Collector&#x27;s Edition Label&quot; formats. 

On October 15, 2013, Image Madacy Entertainment released &quot;The New 3 Stooges: Complete Cartoon Collection&quot; on DVD in Region 1 making it the first time a complete set was released. The five-disc set features all 156 cartoons and 39 live action sequences on four discs, with the bonus disc being an audio CD by the Stooges which combines tracks from two of their albums.

On October 17, 2017, Mill Creek Entertainment released all 156 cartoons and 40 live action segments as part of &quot;The Three Stooges: The Big Box of Nyuks&quot; box set.

==Reception==
&quot;The New 3 Stooges&quot; was well received upon initial airings, despite the use of limited animation. However, the Stooges were visibly aging during this time (Moe was 68 and Larry was 63), so the team&#x27;s patented slapstick routines were subdued in the live action segments. Orgel later stated that the Stooges&#x27; penchant for violence was kept to a minimum due to the concerns of parental groups. In addition, Larry&#x27;s motor skills had become somewhat sluggish, resulting in occasional slurred dialogue. To compensate, most of the comedy being divided between Moe and Curly-Joe, with Larry only chiming in when necessary. In retrospect, this altered comedy dynamic was a throwback to the Stooges&#x27; prime years in the 1930s when Curly Howard dominated the team&#x27;s films and Larry was relegated to an occasional line of dialogue.

&quot;The New 3 Stooges&quot; lasted for a single season. Although animated portions of the show were last aired in syndication on WGN-TV in the Chicago area in the early 1980s and 1990s, repackaged, redubbed, new music and distributed at the time by DIC Animation City and Jeffrey Scott Productions, it is occasionally seen on Me-TV. It also aired in Japan on TV Tokyo.

&quot;The New 3 Stooges&quot; became the only regularly scheduled television series in the Stooges&#x27; history. Unlike other film shorts that aired on television like &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot;, the Stooges&#x27; short films never had a regularly scheduled national television program to air in, neither on network nor syndicated; the film shorts, at roughly 20 minutes apiece, were of ideal size to be run as a stand-alone television series in and of themselves. When Columbia/Screen Gems licensed the film library to television beginning in 1958, local stations aired the shorts when they saw fit, either as late-night &quot;filler&quot; or marathon sessions.

<text>ACTS University (ACTS abbreviated from Asian Center for Theological Studies and Mission) is an interdenominational evangelical Christian school in South Korea. It has two primary campuses: the smaller original location in Seoul, a larger new campus in Yangpyeong County, east of Seoul in central Gyeonggi province. It hosts undergraduate and graduate programs on a number of campuses.

==History==

The school traces its roots to an evangelical conference in Singapore in 1968. The campus was opened in Seoul&#x27;s Seodaemun-gu on May 1, 1974, with six students. At that time it existed only as the Asia Center for Theological Studies and Mission; it received permission to form an educational corporation in 1981, at which time the formal entity of Asia United Theological College was established. Shortly thereafter the Yangpyeong campus was acquired. The college became a university in 1993.

<text>The San Bernard River is a river in Texas.

== Course ==
San Bernard River flows from a spring near New Ulm, Texas to its mouth on the Gulf of Mexico, some to the southeast of the source. It passes through portions of Austin, Brazoria, Colorado, Fort Bend, Matagorda and Wharton counties. It passes alongside the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge, which shelters one of the last populations of the critically endangered Attwater&#x27;s prairie-chicken, a ground-dwelling grouse of the coastal prairie ecosystem.

The San Bernard River is one of a small number of rivers in Texas which empties directly into the Gulf. Its mouth was impeded in 2005 causing it to drain into the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, but was later corrected. Shortly after being opened back up, the entrance silted in again, and remains so at this time.

== Watershed ==
The San Bernard drains approximately 1,850 square miles (4800 km2) of land, and its basin area is home to approximately 87,000 people according to the 1990 census. The region was once the home of the Karankawa Indians. The river runs near several communities, including West Columbia, Texas and along the San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge. The basin receives approximately of rainfall annually.

<doc id="1264439" wikidata="Q704634" url="?curid=1264439" title="1980 West German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in West Germany on 5 October 1980 to elect the members of the 9th Bundestag. Although the CDU/CSU remained the largest faction in parliament, Helmut Schmidt of the Social Democratic Party remained Chancellor.

==Issues and campaign==
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of the SPD-FDP coalition wanted to be re-elected. The CDU/CSU candidate for Chancellor was CSU leader Franz Josef Strauß. It was the first time that their candidate was from the CSU. Strauß, immensely popular in Bavaria, found it difficult to appeal to people in other parts of Germany. One important reason for Strauss&#x27;s unpopularity compared to Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, was his tendency to talk sharply and militantly about his political opponents. Schmidt, by contrast, was still seen by many West German voters as a moderate and practical manager and doer, who focused on getting concrete political and economic results more than on political rhetoric.

==Results==

=== Results by state ===
==== Constituency seats ====
==== List seats ====
==Post-election==

The coalition between the SPD and the FDP returned to government, with Helmut Schmidt as Chancellor. In 1982, the FDP quit the government, which led to the government&#x27;s collapse and replacement with a new CDU/CSU – FDP coalition under Helmut Kohl.

<doc id="1264444" wikidata="Q1268987" url="?curid=1264444" title="Hardpan">
<text>In soil science, agriculture and gardening, hardpan or soil pan is a dense layer of soil, usually found below the uppermost topsoil layer. There are different types of hardpan, all sharing the general characteristic of being a distinct soil layer that is largely impervious to water. Some hardpans are formed by deposits in the soil that fuse and bind the soil particles. These deposits can range from dissolved silica to matrices formed from iron oxides and calcium carbonate. Others are man-made, such as hardpan formed by compaction from repeated plowing, particularly with moldboard plows, or by heavy traffic or pollution.

==Formations==
Soil structure strongly affects its tendency to form a hard pan. One such common soil condition related to hardpan is soil pH. Acidic soils are most often affected due to the propensity of certain mineral salts, most notably iron and calcium, to form hard complexes with soil particles under acidic conditions.

Another major determinant is the soil particle size. Clay particles are some of the smallest particles commonly found in soils. Due to their structure the space between individual clay particles is small and already restricts the passage of water, reducing infiltration and hence drainage. Soils with a high clay content are also easily compacted and affected by man-made discharges. Clay particles have a strong negative electrostatic charge and will readily bond to positively charged ions dissolved in the soil-water matrix. Common salts such as sodium ions contained in wastewater can fulfil this role and lead to a localized hardpan in some soil types. This is a common cause of septic system failure due to the prevention of proper drainage in field.

==Problems and workarounds==
Hardpan can be a problem in farming and gardening by impeding drainage of water and restricting the growth of plant roots. In these situations, the hardpan can be broken up by either mechanical means such as digging or plowing, or through the use of soil amendments. The broadfork is a manual tool specifically designed for this task; a digging fork or a spade might also be used. The chisel plow does a similar job with the help of a tractor.

The use of soil amendments can also be employed to alter the soil structure and promote the dissolution of the hard pan. It has been observed that increasing the amount of soil organic matter through the working-in of manure, compost or peat can both improve local drainage and promote the proliferation of earth worms that can, over time, break relatively thin hardpan layers.

More difficult hardpans may be further improved through the action of both adjusting the soil pH with lime if the soil is acidic, and with the addition of gypsum. This combination can help loosen clay particles bound into a hardpan by the actions of hard salts such as iron, calcium carbonate and sodium, by promoting their mobility through a higher pH while proving a suitable source of exchanging minerals (the gypsum). This works because gypsum salts, although not &quot;soft&quot;, are still water permeable and have a larger, more open structure, the results of which do not promote as hard a matrix as was replaced. However, unlike when employing mechanical means, breaking a hardpan through the use of amendments may require action over the course of years, and even then one is by no means assured success. The results are primarily determined by how extensive and / or intractable the hardpan is.

<text>Nigerian Breweries Plc, is the largest brewing company in Nigeria. It serves the Nigerian market and West Africa.

==History==
=== Early years ===
The idea to establish a brewery in Lagos was first promoted by Frank Samuel of UAC before World War II. But it was not until the war ended that concrete steps were taken to kick-start such a project. Market leaders in the sector were all imported brands without a locally produced beer. UAC did not have a technical history in beer-making, leading the firm to enter into a technical agreement with Heineken and investments from other merchandise companies in Nigeria, including John Holt, GBO, SCOA, CFAO and UTC who all took some equity interest in the new company. Nigerian Breweries was incorporated in 1946.

Construction of the brewery began at Iganmu, Lagos, in 1947 and was completed in 1949. The first bottle of its brand, the STAR Lager, rolled off the bottling lines of its Lagos brewery in June 1949. NBL utilized consumer market research to understand the demands of the market and developed a marketing strategy around STAR Lager that used advertisements to show a link between drinking beer and modernity. It was one of the early companies to use sophisticated market research skills and to advertise a Nigerian brand heavily.

===Development===
Star attained market leadership in 1960, which created a need to build more factories in Nigeria. To get products to consumers, the company gave rights to sell its brand to select distributors and built depots at strategic locations within the country. As the company expanded into other regions, it established more breweries, such as Aba Brewery in 1957 and Kaduna Brewery in 1963. By 1971, the company was one of the largest industries in the country in terms of capital investment. In 1982, another brewery was added in Ibadan. In September 1993, the company acquired its fifth brewery in Enugu, and in October 2003, its sixth brewery, sited at Ameke in Enugu. Ama Brewery began brewing on 22 March 2003 and, at 3 million hectolitres, is the largest brewery in Nigeria.

In addition, NBL introduced assorted non-alcoholic mineral and flavored drinks under the Rainbow brand, including Krola, Tip Top Tonic Water, and Sundowner soda water. It also introduced Gulder into the market and acquired rights to market Schweppes bitter lemon in the country. In 1972, it sold its non-alcoholic drink franchise.

In the 1980s, NBL gradually increased its market share in the alcoholic beverage market at the expense of smaller breweries. In 1988, NBL facilities had to undergo a conversion process when the government banned barley imports. The firm employed Heineken&#x27;s technical assistance with the conversion process and also established a grain farm in Niger State to supply locally produced grains for the breweries.

===21st century===
In 2010, NB Plc acquired beer factories from Sona Group, makers of maltonic malt drink and franchise owners of Goldberg beer. The factories included Sona Breweries at Ota and Kaduna and Life Breweries at Onitsha. In 2014, the firm merged with Consolidated Breweries, producers of 33 export and Williams Dark Ale, a merger led by the company&#x27;s leading shareholder Heineken.

In December 2018, a Nigerian court ruled that Nigerian Breweries misled its consumers by selling Amstel Malt as a low-sugar product, which was an inaccurate statement. In March 2019, a Nigerian Federal High Court dismissed Nigerian Breweries&#x27; suit against the National Lottery Regulatory Commission (filed in 2018) which asked the Court to look into the authority of the Lottery Commission regarding sales promotion to consumers. The Lottery Commission had nailed Nigerian Breweries for running illegal lottery operations as part of a marketing promotion. 

In December 2020, Nigerian Breweries launched the tequila-flavored beer Desperados. In August 2021, Hans Essaadi became the new CEO of Nigerian Breweries.

==Products==
Most of the products are packed in returnable bottles, and all products are now available in cans. Fayrouz, Maltina, and Amstel Malta are also produced in P.E.T Bottles.

The company&#x27;s head office is located in Lagos.

<text>A windrow is a row of cut (mown) hay or small grain crop. It is allowed to dry before being baled, combined, or rolled. For hay, the windrow is often formed by a hay rake, which rakes hay that has been cut by a mowing machine or by scythe into a row, or it may naturally form as the hay is mown. For small grain crops which are to be harvested, the windrow is formed by a swather which both cuts the crop and forms the windrow. 

By analogy, the term may also be applied to a row of any other material such as snow, earth or materials for collection.

* Snow windrows are created by snow plows when clearing roads of snow; where this blocks driveways the windrow may require removal. Snow windrowed to the centre of the street can be removed by a snow blower and truck. In preparing a pond or lake for ice cutting, the snow on top of the ice, which slows freezing, might be scraped off and windrowed.
* Earth windrows may be formed by graders when grading earthworks or dirt roads
* Leaf windrows may be required for municipal collection.
* Fossil windrows are a grouping of fossils that have been deposited together as a result of turbulence or wave action in a marine or freshwater environment. Fossils of similar shape and size are commonly found grouped or sorted together as a result of separation based on weight and shape.
* Seaweed windrows form on sea or lake surfaces because of cylindrical Langmuir circulation just under the surface caused by wind action.

Windrow composting is a large scale vermicomposting system where garden and other biodegradable waste is shredded, mixed and windrowed for composting.

<doc id="1264461" wikidata="Q1660399" url="?curid=1264461" title="Junta (game)">
<text>Junta is a board game designed by Vincent Tsao, first published in 1978 by Creative Wargames Workshop and published, as of 1985, by West End Games. Players compete as the corrupt power elite families of a fictional parody of a stereotypical banana republic (specifically &quot;Republica de los Bananas&quot;) trying to get as much money as possible into their Swiss bank accounts before the foreign aid money runs out. Fighting in the republic&#x27;s capital during recurrent coup attempts encompasses most of the game&#x27;s equipment, rules and playtime. This game-within-the-game is however actually tangential to the players&#x27; main goal.

The length of the game depends on how often coups are declared, but can often exceed six hours.

The game&#x27;s title is taken from the Spanish term &quot;Junta&quot; that originally referred to the executive bodies that frequently came to power after a military coup in 20th century Latin America (the Spanish version is called &quot;Golpe&quot;, which means coup d&#x27;état). In the game, the term refers to the players who declare &quot;Rebel&quot; at the beginning of the coup phase, and—if the coup is victorious—to the players who declare &quot;pro-Junta&quot; at the end of the coup phase to elect a new president.

==Players==
The players of &quot;Junta&quot; represent corrupt and powerful Banana republic families. Although players are often executed or assassinated in the course of gameplay, the only real implication of a player&#x27;s death is the loss of cash and Junta cards the player is carrying and a temporary inability to participate until the next turn, when another member of the family steps up to assume the responsibilities of the deceased. Each player is given a family token to underscore this permanent identity, although the token has no effect on game play. Cabinet positions, however, which are denoted by cards, are reassigned each turn.

==Game play==
Each game turn represents a year, which takes place during seven stages represented on the board&#x27;s &quot;political track&quot;. The game ends when the President cannot draw eight bills from the foreign aid money at the beginning of a turn. This event is disguised by the blank bills placed at the bottom of the foreign aid deck and by the &quot;used&quot; bills which are placed under the blanks when spent as part of a card action. A typical game will have 9–11 rounds. The winner is the player who has the most money in their Swiss bank account at the end of the game. Money on one&#x27;s person is irrelevant.

Each player not in exile has the ability to draw and play &quot;Junta&quot; cards, direct the votes he controls via cabinet positions, influence, and vote cards on the President and the budget votes, carry out the abilities listed on his influence cards and cabinet positions, command his troops during a coup, and manage his money. In all votes, each player commands one vote representing himself and whatever votes he can garner from influence or voting cards. The only exception is the Presidential election after a successful coup in which each &quot;rebel&quot; player commands one and only one vote.

===Upkeep phase===
Junta cards are drawn and &quot;El Presidente&quot; is elected, if necessary. Each player&#x27;s vote in the Chamber of Deputies as well as influence and vote cards are used. An &quot;errata&quot; later clarified that if a player declines a nomination votes may be recast with the exception of vote cards which are discarded. &quot;El Presidente&quot; retains this position until the event of assassination, a successful coup, or resignation. All three events have the effect of liquidating the President&#x27;s assets and delivering the cash to the assassin or successor.

===Cabinet phase===
&quot;El Presidente&quot; assigns cabinet positions to the other players. El Presidente cannot hold a cabinet position and must assign each other player at least one position. If fewer than seven players are playing, or if players are in exile, players may hold two positions, but no more than one Generalship. Each cabinet position (note: not each player) holds one vote in the Chamber of Deputies. Cabinet positions are as follows:
; Minister of Internal Security : The commander of the secret police, who may deliver a &quot;free&quot; assassination each turn. The Minister also may force a budget to pass if it fails and has the option of assassinating any player returning from &quot;exile.&quot;
; Generals of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd armies : Generals control their respective armies in the event of a coup.
; Chief of the Air Force : Controls airstrikes and paratroopers in the event of a coup.
; Admiral of the Navy : Controls naval bombardment and marines in the event of a coup. The rulebook makes reference to the &quot;ceremonial shelling of the Presidential Palace&quot; at the beginning of a coup.

===Budget phase===
El Presidente draws 8 bills from the foreign aid money deck. Bills come in denominations of 1, 2, or 3 million pesos in order of decreasing probability. Thus, the President may draw between 8 and 24 million pesos on a given turn. El Presidente then assigns the budget by declaring how much money each player is intended to receive. Only the President knows the amount drawn, but must reveal how much each other player is intended to be given. The budget is then voted on. If the budget fails the President keeps all the money, unless the Minister forces the budget to pass. Forcing the budget to pass has the effect of distributing the foreign aid money as if the budget had passed, consolidating the police units in the Chamber of Deputies, and making a coup justified that turn.

===Assassination phase===
A round of assassinations takes place. First each player chooses his location using the location tiles in a secret yet binding fashion. Locations are as follows:
*Home (causes the player to be killed if a &quot;burglars&quot; assassination card is played against him)
*Mistress (leaves a player vulnerable to a &quot;character assassination&quot; card)
*Nightclub
*Headquarters (allows the player to start a coup without an excuse)
*Bank (allows the player to access his Swiss bank account, should he survive to the banking phase)
Then each player declares their assassinations. The Minister of Internal Security gets to use the secret police for one assassination and any player may order one with an assassination card. To declare an assassination, a player must name the player who is the target and the location at which the assassination will be attempted. Once all assassinations are declared, they are resolved in order. An assassination is successful if a player&#x27;s location is guessed correctly, although some assassination cards require a successful dice roll as well and some cards may be used to thwart an assassination.

If multiple assassination attempts are declared against a single player, they are resolved in the order they were declared (a player cannot be killed more than once). An assassinated player discards their hand, turns over their cash to the assassin, and is inactive for the rest of the turn. Assassinations are transitive: if A assassinates B and B assassinates C, A gets both B and C&#x27;s money. If players kill each other — assassinates B and B assassinates A – then both players&#x27; money is discarded to the bottom of the foreign aid deck (under the blanks). The same holds true for larger mutual assassinations (A assassinates B, B assassinates C, C assassinates A). If all players die during the assassination phase, then the game ends with no winner.

Assassination attempts by the Minister&#x27;s secret police may not take place at the Bank two turns in a row. After an assassination attempt has taken place at the Bank, an indicator on the board is changed to indicate that the &quot;Bank is Safe&quot; from the secret police for a turn. The &quot;Bank is Safe&quot; indicator does not affect assassin cards.

If the President has been assassinated, a new President is elected immediately after the last assassination has been resolved. Assassinated players may not take any action until the beginning of the next turn.

===Banking phase===
A player who chose the Bank as his location and who escaped assassination may deposit or withdraw money from their Swiss bank account unless the budget failed. If the budget failed but was forced through by the Minister of Internal Security, the bank is closed for lunch until after the coup phase. If the budget failed altogether, leaving the President with the entire foreign aid, no banking may take place at all this turn.

===Coup phase===
Coups are a tactical game within the game that may result in the replacement of the President and unfortunate players being sent to the firing squad. Which side a player supports is often unclear during a coup. A scheming player can benefit by concealing their true objectives to gain a favourable position to negotiate from. Others may find it easier simply being a turncoat.

====Starting a coup====
To start a coup there must exist a coup excuse, which is kept track of by an indicator on the board. Coup excuses are as follows:
*The budget failed.
*The Minister of Internal Security seized the Chamber of Deputies.
*Any player was assassinated.
*Any player plays a card providing a coup excuse.

Also, any player who chose &quot;Headquarters&quot; as their location in the Location phase may start a coup without an excuse to do so.

If allowed, any player may start a coup, thus becoming &quot;First Rebel&quot;, by playing a card to place units on the board, moving any unit or bombarding the presidential palace. If no player does this, no coup takes place. The risk a player takes in becoming the &quot;First Rebel&quot; is that the player might become the &quot;only&quot; rebel, and suffer reprisals in the wake of an unsuccessful coup.

====Rebel phase====
The first phase of a coup is called the rebel phase. After the &quot;First Rebel&quot; has initiated the coup, all players in turn are given a chance to act. Any player who chooses to move or fire during the rebel phase becomes a &quot;rebel&quot;. Players who refrain from acting in the rebel phase remain &quot;loyalists&quot;.

====Coup phases====
Following the rebel phase comes six coup phases. The players battle for control of five buildings, shown in red on the map, vital for the post-coup resolution. They are:
*The Presidential Palace
*The Radio Station (WZAP)
*The Chamber of Deputies
*The Treasury
*The Railway Station

Although there officially are the two sides of &quot;rebels&quot; and &quot;loyalists&quot;, in-faction fighting may take place as players change sides or seize opportunities of gaining a stronger position. Should a &quot;loyalist&quot; attack a Palace Guard unit, that player turns into a &quot;rebel&quot;. A &quot;rebel&quot;, however, cannot become a &quot;loyalist&quot;.

The combat rules are fairly complex. Units first move, and then volleys can be fired between opposing units that are in the same area. The side that loses the most units from combat must retreat to an unoccupied adjacent area.

====Coup victory====
After the end of the final coup phase, the players negotiate and must declare themselves either &quot;Pro-President&quot; or &quot;Pro-Junta&quot;. A &quot;rebel&quot; may choose to be &quot;Pro-President&quot;, and a &quot;loyalist&quot; may see reasons to become &quot;Pro-Junta&quot;. The side controlling three or more of the vital buildings is victorious.

If the President prevails, any one &quot;rebel&quot; may be sent to the firing squad. In the case of a Junta victory, the &quot;rebels&quot; elect a new President. A &quot;Pro-Junta&quot; &quot;loyalist&quot; takes no part in the election. The &quot;First Rebel&quot; breaks a tied vote. The new President may then send any player, regardless of whether they were &quot;rebel&quot; or &quot;loyalist&quot;, to be executed. An executed player discards their political cards and hands over their pocket money to the President.

===Exile===
A player may go into exile during the Location phase by placing a location marker on one of the embassies on the map, to indicate the country to which the player fled. It is also possible to flee the republic during a coup, provided that the player controls an embassy with their forces.

A player in exile is safe from executions and assassinations, but is very limited in all but the social aspects of the game. A player may return from exile at any time, but normally the Minister of Internal Security may have the returning player executed by the secret police at will. It is only safe to return from exile when the President is dead, before a new one has been elected, during a coup provided that a friendly player controls the relevant embassy, or if the Minister&#x27;s position is &quot;frozen&quot; (see below).

===Brother-in-law===
A dead or exiled player may not use any of their family&#x27;s cabinet positions. The President may control one such position through their &quot;brother-in-law.&quot; Any other positions of dead or exiled players are considered &quot;frozen&quot;.

==Reception==
Aaron Allston reviewed &quot;Junta&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 33. Allston commented that &quot;Overall, &quot;Junta&quot; is highly recommended to all gamers who enjoy backstabbing.&quot;

In the December 1993 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 200), Allen Varney gave &quot;Junta&quot; a thumbs up: &quot;Do you like casual corruption, hilarious doubletalk, and soldiers who can’t shoot straight? We got them all. &quot;Muy bien&quot;, I think!&quot;

In Issue 25 of &quot;Phoenix&quot; (May–June 1980), Roger Musson found the map and counters &quot;quite attractive&quot;, but thought the cards were too thin and likely to wear. Nonetheless, he found &quot;Junta&quot; &quot;a very enjoyable game, well worth playing, and likely to appeal to a very wide range of players.&quot;

&quot;Junta&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Darren Watts commented, &quot;&quot;Junta&quot; isn&#x27;t one of the 100 greatest hobby games because of its rules and mechanics — they&#x27;re good, each of them, but not brilliant. It&#x27;s a great hobby game because it creates a mood and captures a theme brilliantly, and integrates every single design element to that cause. With its wonderful sense of comical menace, political instability, and institutionalized corruption, &quot;Junta&quot; is a hoot and a half to play.&quot;

<text>On January 1, 1953, the New Jersey Highway Department renumbered many of the State Routes. This renumbering was first proposed in 1951 in order to reduce confusion to motorists. A few rules were followed in deciding what to renumber:
*No state route and U.S. Route could have the same number; this eliminated 1 (which was also eliminated by other criteria), 22, 30, 40 and 46. While Route 1 was broken into several pieces, the other four were renumbered as Routes 59, 69, 70 and 77, respectively. Route 69 later became Route 31 after frequent theft of road signs due to the sexual connotation of the number.
*Concurrencies were highly discouraged; this included U.S. Routes and meant that U.S. Route numbers would now be referred to directly by NJDOT.
*No State Route could have a lettered prefix or suffix unless it was unsigned. (U.S. 9W remained an exception.)
*A State Route that ended at a state border was renumbered to match the number assigned by the adjacent state.
*The New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway, and Palisades Interstate Parkway were not to have route numbers.

New numbers assigned semi-arbitrarily included 15 and 20 (13-20 were not assigned in the 1927 renumbering), the sequence from 57 to 93, and 152 to 165 for minor routes (continuing from pre-renumbering 151).

In the table, S routes (like S1 and S1A) is shown with the S after the number (like 1S and 1SA) for sorting reasons.

<text>Federal elections were held in West Germany on 3 October 1976 to elect the members of the 8th Bundestag. Although the CDU/CSU alliance became the largest faction in parliament, Helmut Schmidt of the Social Democratic Party remained Chancellor.

==Campaign==
The coalition of the SPD and the FDP wanted to be re-elected, with the SPD, since 1974 led by Helmut Schmidt, the party&#x27;s candidate for Chancellor. The CDU and the CSU tried to achieve an absolute majority of the votes to make CDU chairman Helmut Kohl Chancellor, but they fell six seats short of their target.

===Opinion polls===
==Results==

==== Constituency seats ====
==== List seats ====
==Aftermath==
The coalition between the SPD and the FDP remained in government, with Helmut Schmidt as Chancellor. Between the &quot;sister parties&quot; of CDU and Bavarian CSU there emerged a critical conflict, as the CSU leader Franz Josef Strauß wanted to break both the united Bundestag group of the parties and the agreement not to compete against each other in any Land. Later, this attack was withdrawn, while Strauß became candidate for chancellor for the 1980 elections.

<text>CBWFT-DT (channel 3) is an Ici Radio-Canada Télé station in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, serving the province&#x27;s Franco-Manitoban population. It has common ownership with CBC Television station CBWT-DT (channel 6). The two stations share studios on Portage Avenue and Young Street in Downtown Winnipeg; CBWFT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located atop the Richardson Building.

==History==
The CBC announced on February 17, 1959, that they would appear before the BBG (predecessor to the CRTC) in Ottawa on March 18 to apply for a license to extend Radio-Canada&#x27;s television signal into the Winnipeg area.
CBWFT first signed on at 3 p.m. on April 24, 1960, using channel 6 with an ERP of 2,800 watts. At the same time two VTRs, worth $75,000 each were installed at the station. It was the first francophone television station west of Ontario. Its opening broadcast was a ceremony held at the Notre Dame Auditorium in St. Boniface. Dignitaries included in attendance were Lieutenant-Governor Errick Willis; Premier Duff Roblin; CBC President Alphonse Ouimet; Marcel Ouimet, general manager of Radio-Canada; J. R. Finlay, CBC Prairie Region Director; and Leo Remillard, CBWFT&#x27;s program director.

At first, CBWFT&#x27;s broadcast day ran between 6 and 12 hours, with a longer programming day on weekends. Over the years, this was extended to encompass most of the day. Initially, Radio-Canada&#x27;s microwave link did not reach as far as Winnipeg. Instead, videotapes and films were &quot;bicycled&quot; from Montreal and delayed by one week, except for news and live events like &quot;La Soirée du hockey&quot;.
On November 15, 1964, it swapped frequencies with CBWT and a higher-powered transmitter was installed at the new site near Starbuck. From 1964 till the early 1980s, it referred to itself simply as &quot;CBWFT canal 3 Winnipeg&quot;. During the early 1980s, CBWFT was known as &quot;CBWFT 3/10&quot;, signifying its position on Channel 3, Cable 10 in Winnipeg. On January 1, 1986, it became known as &quot;Radio-Canada Manitoba&quot;.

By October 31, 1966, CBWFT was connected to the Radio-Canada microwave signal, allowing the live feed of &quot;Le Téléjournal&quot; at 6 p.m. Prior to this the newscast consisted of Radio-Canada&#x27;s radio news with locally inserted images. Several months after the first Anik A satellite was launched in 1972, CBWFT switched to the satellite feed of Radio-Canada and dropped the microwave feed, except to distribute its signal within its coverage area, Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario, and part of Saskatchewan. In 1976, a rebroadcaster of CBWFT programming in Regina became CBKFT. In 1985, CBKFT was issued a separate license to broadcast its own regional news program.

==News operation==
In 2005, the long-running news program was renamed to , which is the same name of the French national news program on Radio-Canada. The local edition is normally 30 minutes in length; however, the Wednesday edition is 60 minutes. The program is also rebroadcast at 11 p.m.

As of 2023, the Monday to Thursday bulletins are presented by Godlove Kamwa and Friday to Sunday by Cédrick Noufele. 

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CBWFT switched from analogue to digital television broadcasting on December 9, 2011, from its Winnipeg transmitter atop the Richardson Building, after several delays, due to an &quot;unforeseen delay that is outside of the Corporation&#x27;s control,&quot; involving antenna erection. CBWFT&#x27;s digital signal operates on UHF channel 32, using virtual channel 3.

===Transmitters===
CBWFT operated 11 analogue television retransmitters in Manitoba (e.g. Brandon) and Northwestern Ontario (in the parts of that region which fall in the Central Time Zone, e.g. Kenora). Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analog transmitters on July 31, 2012. None of CBC or Radio-Canada&#x27;s television rebroadcasters were converted to digital.

<text>The broadfork, also called a U-fork or [[:fr:Grelinette|grelinette]], is a garden tool used to manually break up densely packed soil, including hardpan, to improve aeration and drainage. Broadforks are used as part of a no-till or reduced-till seedbed preparation process because they preserve the soil structure and avoid the resurfacing of weed seeds.

It consists of five or so metal tines, approximately eight inches long, spaced a few inches apart on a horizontal bar, with two handles extending upwards to chest or shoulder level that form a large U-shape.

The operator steps up on the crossbar, using full bodyweight to drive the tines into the ground, then steps backward while pulling backwards on the handles, causing the tines to lever upwards through the soil. This action leaves the soil layers intact, rather than inverting or mixing them, preserving the topsoil structure.

A broadfork can be used in a garden, or practically for one to two acres (4,000 to 8,000 m2). For larger areas, a tractor- or animal-powered chisel plow or similar tool is usually employed.

==U-bar==
A u-bar is similar to a broadfork but has longer tines - up to - for deeper cultivation, since it is meant to be used in beds that have already been double dug at least once. A u-bar also has &quot;elbows&quot; that allow the tines to be raised above soil level when the handles are tilted all the way back. Thus, clumps of soil that get caught on the tines can be broken up by shaking the handles up and down, rocking the tool on its elbows.

Whereas double digging a one hundred square foot (9.3 square meter) bed can take several hours, tilling the same bed with a u-bar can often be done in a half hour or so.

<doc id="1264507" wikidata="Q701799" url="?curid=1264507" title="1972 West German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in West Germany on 19 November 1972 to elect the members of the 7th Bundestag. In the first snap elections since the resumption of democratic elections in 1949, the Social Democratic Party became the largest party in parliament for the first time since 1930, winning 230 of the 496 seats. The coalition with the Free Democratic Party was resumed.

==Campaign==

The Social-liberal coalition of SPD and FDP had lost its majority after several Bundestag MPs (like former FDP ministers Erich Mende and Heinz Starke or SPD partisan Herbert Hupka) had left their party and become members of the CDU/CSU opposition to protest against Chancellor Willy Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Neue Ostpolitik&quot;, especially against the &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of the Oder-Neisse line by the 1970 Treaty of Warsaw.

On 27 April 1972 the opposition had tried to have CDU leader Rainer Barzel elected new chancellor in a constructive vote of no confidence, but Barzel surprisingly missed the majority of 249 by two votes. Rumours that at least one member of the CDU/CSU faction had been paid by the East German &quot;Stasi&quot; to abstain (in effect, voting against Barzel) were confirmed by Markus Wolf, former head of the &quot;Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung&quot;, in 1997. Nevertheless, the following budget debates revealed that the government&#x27;s majority was lost and only the upcoming organisation of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich delayed the arrangement of new elections. On 22 September 1972 Chancellor Brandt asked for a vote of confidence, which required the same majority of 249 &quot;yes&quot; votes: it failed with 233 &quot;yes&quot; votes to 246 &quot;no&quot; votes. The members of the government did not participate (in effect, voting no) to ensure the vote would fail, however it would have regardless. This allowed Brandt to advise President Gustav Heinemann to dissolve the Bundestag and call new elections the same day.

In the tense campaign, the CDU/CSU attacked Brandt as being too lenient towards Eastern Europe and having the wrong ideas on the economy. SPD and FDP benefited from the enormous personal popularity of the chancellor, laureate of the 1971 Nobel Peace Prize. He gained the support by numerous celebrities of the West German culture and media scene (e.g. Günter Grass), expressed by the slogan &quot;Willy wählen!&quot; (&quot;Vote for Willy!&quot;).

=== Opinion polls ===
==Results==
Voter turnout was 91.1%, the highest ever since 1949. In 1970 the voting age had been lowered from 21 to 18.

The SPD celebrated their best result ever, representing the largest faction in the German parliament for the first time since the 1930 Reichstag elections. It enabled the party to nominate Annemarie Renger for President of the Bundestag; she was the first Social Democrat and also the first woman to hold this office.

===Results by state===
==== Constituency seats ====
==== List seats ====
== Post-election ==

On 14 December 1972 the Bundestag MPs of the social-liberal coalition re-elected Willy Brandt chancellor. His Cabinet Brandt II returned to government the next day, again with FDP chairman Walter Scheel as vice-chancellor and foreign minister. Defeated Rainer Barzel resigned as CDU chairman on 9 May 1973; he was succeeded by Helmut Kohl.

On 7 May 1974, Brandt would resign in the course of the Guillaume Affair, after one of his personal aides had been unmasked as a &quot;Stasi&quot; agent. The coalition continued under his party fellow Helmut Schmidt, while Brandt remained SPD chairman until 1987.

<text>Philippe Deane Gigantès (August 16, 1923 – December 9, 2004) was a veteran of the Second World War, journalist, war correspondent, POW of the Korean War, author, television commentator, Greek minister of culture, and Canadian senator.

==War and journalism==
Gigantès served in the British Royal Navy during the Second World War. After the war, he became a journalist, working for the &quot;London Observer&quot;, in Greece, North Africa, and South Asia, from 1946 to 1961.

Gigantès covered the Korean War as the war correspondent from International News Service.

Whilst covering the Korean War he was taken prisoner, and spent 33 months in a North Korean prison camp. During this time he was interned with George Blake. After his release he wrote the book &quot;I was a Captive in Korea&quot; and returned to his career in journalism. He became the Washington correspondent for the &quot;London Observer&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

From 1965 to the 1970s, he was a journalist in Canada. During the 1970s he was speech writer and top aide to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

==Greek Minister of Culture==

He worked as a United Nations official. In 1964 he was appointed to the post of associate Greek Minister of Culture, serving until 1965. He later resumed his career in the media as a television commentator from 1965 to 1970s.

==Academic career and Canadian civil servant==

From 1965 to 1968 completed his Bachelor of Arts, Master and PhD at the University of Toronto.

After his graduation he served as Dean of Arts at Bishop&#x27;s University and Dean of Arts and Science at University of Lethbridge.

In the 1970s he served with the Official Languages Commission and the Treasury Board.

==Canadian Senator==

In 1980 he ran for MP in the Canadian riding of Broadview-Greenwood, but was defeated by Bob Rae. In 1984 while working as an editorialist at the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; he was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Pierre Trudeau, for whom he had worked between 1978 and 1980 as a researcher then head of the Liberal Caucus Research Office. He served in the Senate until his 75th birthday in 1998.

While in the Senate he served on many committees but was particularly proud of his work as chair of an adhoc committee on the future of work. His report of this work was published by Parliament under the title &quot;Only Work Works&quot; and in French under the title &quot;&quot;Il n&#x27;y a que le Travail qui Vaille&quot;.

==Electoral record==
==Author==
He was the author of 15 books including &quot;I Should Have Died&quot;, &quot;Is the Free Trade Deal Really for You?&quot; (1988) and &quot;Power and Greed: A Short History of the World&quot; (2002).

In his book &quot;Nice Work: The Continuing Scandal of Canada&#x27;s Senate&quot;, journalist and author Claire Hoy wrote that Gigantes, during a filibuster in the Senate, read one of his books into the record; another senator suggested that he did this to get the work translated into French for free by parliamentary staff responsible for Hansard.

==Death==
Gigantès died on December 9, 2004, of prostate cancer in Montreal. He left behind his wife Susan, his first wife Molly, three daughters Eleni, Claire and Eve Marie, two grandsons and a granddaughter. He was predeceased by his second wife Sylvie. His ashes were scattered in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea near Kefalonia, Greece.

<text>Violadores del Verso (), formerly also known as Doble V, are a rap music group from Spain. 

== History ==
Violadores del Verso was started in 1997 in Zaragoza, Spain by David Gilaberte (&quot;Lírico&quot;), Sergio Rodriguez (&quot;Sho-Hai/Hate&quot;), Rubén Cuevas (&quot;R de Rumba&quot;) and brothers Javier (&quot;Kase.O&quot;) and Sergio Ibarra (&quot;Brutal&quot;). 

They released their first LP &quot;Genios&quot; in 1999. In 2001 they released two further albums as Doble V, a name they used until asked to desist to avoid association with Doble V whisky, a trademark owned by the Pernod Ricard drinks concern. In 2006, they released their fourth LP &quot;Vivir para contarlo&quot;, which went gold after ten days. In 2007 the group won the regional award for Spain in the MTV Europe Music Awards. 

The group has been on hiatus since 2010 while its members pursue solo projects. The group&#x27;s last concert before the pause was aired in August 2011 as a 3D transmission by national TV broadcaster Televisión Española (TVE), to pilot of the 3D technology involved.

In 2022, the group rejoined to record the track &quot;Únicos&quot; that appeared on Sho-Hai&#x27;s solo album &quot;Polvo&quot;.

<text>CBFT-DT (channel 2) is a television station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, serving as the flagship station of the French-language service of Ici Radio-Canada Télé. It is owned and operated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (known in French as ) alongside CBC Television outlet CBMT-DT (channel 6). The two stations share studios at Maison Radio-Canada on René Lévesque Boulevard East in Downtown Montreal; CBFT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Mount Royal.

==History==
CBFT was the first permanent television station in Canada (an experimental station, VE9EC, had been on the air in Montreal from 1931 to 1935). It launched on September 6, 1952, at 4 p.m., beating CBLT in Toronto by two days. The station went on the air with the movie &quot;Aladdin and His Lamp&quot;, followed by a cartoon, and then a French film, a news segment and a bilingual variety show. The station aired programming in both French (60 percent) and English (40 percent), a practice common for many stations in Quebec at the time.

This continued until January 10, 1954, when CBMT was launched on VHF channel 6. At that time, all English programming moved to CBMT, while CBFT became a purely French-language station as the flagship of the network for francophone viewers. CBMT&#x27;s sign-on was hastened by the planned launch of television stations across the border in Burlington, Vermont, and Plattsburgh, New York.

Prior to the digital transition, CBFT operated a translator network that stretched across most of Quebec, parts of Ontario, and most of northern Canada (Northwest Territories and Nunavut). 

In recent years, Radio-Canada&#x27;s network feed has largely become a retransmission of CBFT. Due to a lack of sources for alternative programming, most Radio-Canada stations&#x27; schedules are largely identical to those of CBFT, other than commercials and regional news. This was the case for privately owned Radio-Canada affiliates before the last such station closed in 2021.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CBFT began broadcasting its digital signal on March 22, 2005. On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on UHF channel 19, using virtual channel 2.

==Former rebroadcasters==
CBFT had over 30 analogue television rebroadcasters throughout rural Quebec and Labrador. Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analogue transmitters on July 31, 2012. None of CBC or Radio-Canada&#x27;s rebroadcasters were converted to digital.

<doc id="1264519" wikidata="Q1979892" url="?curid=1264519" title="Nicolas Bourriaud">
<text>Nicolas Bourriaud (born 1965) is a French curator and art critic, who has curated a great number of exhibitions and biennials all over the world.

==Career==
Bourriaud was the Paris correspondent for &quot;Flash Art&quot; (1987–1995) and the founder and director of the contemporary art magazine &quot;Documents sur l&#x27;art&quot; (1992–2000). He was also one of the 13 co-curators of the “Aperto” section of the 1993 Venice Biennale.

With Jérôme Sans, Bourriaud cofounded the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, where he served as codirector from 1999 to 2006. During his time at Palais de Tokyo, he also served on the team behind the first and second editions of the Moscow Biennial, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

Bourriaud was the Gulbenkian curator of contemporary art from 2007 to 2010 at Tate Britain in London. In 2009 he curated the fourth Tate Triennial, titled Altermodern. 

===École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, 2007–2010===
Bourriaud was the Director of the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, an art school in Paris, France, from 2011 to 2015. During his time in office, he organized the 2011 edition of the Athens Biennale, the 2014 edition of the Taipei Biennial, and the 2015 edition of the Kaunas Biennial. In 2014, he was part of the selection committee that chose Giuseppe Penone, Nedko Solakov and Liam Gillick as the winners of the European Central Bank’s international competition for site-specific artworks at its new premises. By 2015, he was dismissed from his post by the city, for “reasons related to a change of direction,” according to a Facebook status posted by Bourriaud at the time.)

===MO.CO., 2015–2021===
In 2015, Bourriaud was appointed director of the La Panacée art centre (a.k.a. MO.CO.PANACÉE) and the director of the Contemporary Art Center of Montpellier, France (aka MO.CO.); In 2018, he joined a group of arts professionals — among them the artists Christian Boltanski and Jean-Luc Moulène – in signing an open letter published by the newspaper &quot;Libération&quot;, calling on the city of Paris to abandon the installation of &quot;Bouquet of Tulips&quot; by Jeff Koons. By 2021, he was ousted as director of MO.CO. after months of growing political tensions between Bourriaud and the city’s mayor, Michaël Delafosse.

==Writing==

Bourriaud is best known among English speakers for his publications &quot;Relational Aesthetics&quot; (1998/English version 2002), &quot;Postproduction&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Exform&quot; (2015/ English version 2016). &quot;Relational Aesthetics&quot; in particular has come to be seen as a defining text for a wide variety of art produced by a generation who came to prominence in Europe in the early 1990s. Bourriaud coined the term in 1995, in a text for the catalogue of the exhibition &quot;Traffic&quot; that was shown at the CAPC contemporary art museum in Bordeaux.

In &quot;Postproduction&quot; (2001), Bourriaud relates deejaying to contemporary art. &quot;Radicant&quot; (2009) aims to define the emergence of the first global modernity, based on translation and nomadic forms, against the postmodern aesthetics based on identities. In &quot;The Exform&quot; (2016), Bourriaud examines the dynamics of ideology, specifically as it was developed in the work of Louis Althusser, to account for distinctions between the productive and unproductive, product and waste, and the included and excluded in their relation to society and art production.

<doc id="1264537" wikidata="Q699580" url="?curid=1264537" title="1969 West German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in West Germany on 28 September 1969 to elect the members of the 6th Bundestag. The CDU/CSU remained the largest faction and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) remained the largest single party in the Bundestag, winning 237 of the 518 seats. After the election, the SPD formed a coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the former&#x27;s leader Willy Brandt became the first Social Democratic Chancellor in West Germany&#x27;s history, bringing an end to 20 years of CDU/CSU rule.

==Campaign==
After the resignation of Chancellor Ludwig Erhard on 1 December 1966, a grand coalition of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats had governed West Germany under Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger (CDU), with SPD chairman Willy Brandt as vice-chancellor and foreign minister.

Minister of Economic Affairs Karl Schiller (SPD) had proposed revaluing (increasing the external value of) the Deutsche Mark, West Germany&#x27;s currency, to reduce the country&#x27;s inflation rate and the rate of growth of the country&#x27;s businesses&#x27; income. He also sought to reduce West Germany&#x27;s economic dependence on the exports. However, Finance Minister Franz-Josef Strauss (CSU) rejected the Deutsche Mark&#x27;s revaluation because Bavarian farmers, an important part of his constituency, opposed it. The European Economic Community&#x27;s food commodity prices were paid in U.S. dollars, and the Deutsche Mark&#x27;s revaluation would have made West German exports less competitive (i.e. more expensive for other Western Europeans to buy).

The coalition had already effectively ended before the election because of the revaluation dispute. In addition, enough West German voters were willing to give the Social Democratic leader, Foreign Minister Willy Brandt, a chance to govern West Germany. Brandt, who ran for the third time after 1961 and 1965, had shown sympathy towards groups, including left-wing intellectuals and activists of the German student movement, who had felt ignored by the Christian Democrat-led coalition governments. In addition, his intellect, self-control and reputation for honesty appealed to ordinary West Germans.

==Aftermath==

Willy Brandt, against the will of several party fellows like Herbert Wehner or Helmut Schmidt, chose to leave the grand coalition with the CDU/CSU, forming a social-liberal coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FDP) instead. On 21 October 1969 he was elected Chancellor of Germany, the first SPD chancellor in the postwar period, after the last Social Democrat holding this position had been Hermann Müller from 1928 to 1930. FDP chairman Walter Scheel succeeded Brandt as vice-chancellor and foreign minister. Brandt&#x27;s government proceeded with the revaluation Schiller had proposed, raising the value of the mark by 9.3% in late October.

Disappointed Kiesinger bitterly complained about the faithless liberals. Though he had again achieved the plurality of votes for the CDU, he had to lead his party into opposition. He was succeeded as chairman by Rainer Barzel in 1971.

However the Cabinet Brandt I could only rely on an absolute majority (&quot;Kanzlermehrheit&quot;) of twelve votes in the Bundestag. Several party switches in protest against Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; of FDP and SPD members resulted in the snap election of 1972.

<text>Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma(Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma / Heineken México) (English: Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewery) is a major brewery based in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, founded in 1890. It is a subsidiary of Heineken International.

The company operates brewing plants in Monterrey, Guadalajara, Toluca, Tecate, Orizaba, Navojoa and, beginning in 2017, Meoqui. The plants produce, among other brands, Dos Equis, Sol, Bohemia, Superior, Carta Blanca, Noche Buena, Indio, Casta and Tecate. It has an annual production of 3.09 Gl (gigalitres).

==History==
The Cuauhtémoc brewery was founded in Monterrey in 1890 by José A. Muguerza, Francisco G. Sada Muguerza, Alberto Sada Muguerza, Isaac Garza Garza (brother in-law of Francisco and Alberto, married to their sister Consuelo Sada Muguerza), and Joseph M. Schnaider, with the capital of 150,000 pesos, starting with the Carta Blanca brand. The Cuauhtémoc brewery produced its first beer barrel in 1893 and won first prize in the Chicago and Paris world fairs. The &quot;Cervecería Moctezuma&quot; was founded near Orizaba during the late Porfiriato by German brewer Wilhelm Hasse.

In 1909 Cervecería Cuauhtémoc started to expand vertically. To provide glass bottles, in 1909, Vidrios y Cristales de Monterrey, S.A., later Vidriera Monterrey, S.A. later Grupo Vitro, was founded. In order to produce boxes, bottle caps, and packaging materials, Fábricas de Cartón Monterrey was founded in 1900. In 1929, Malta, S.A. was established to produce malt for the brewery. The cardboard box department would eventually become Titán Company.

During the Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910, its original founders supported Victoriano Huerta. As a consequence, his rival Venustiano Carranza seized the brewery, so the founders&#x27; families fled to Texas. They re-acquired the brewery through the intervention of U.S. and Russian diplomats.

The Sociedad Cuauhtémoc was founded in 1918 to provide medical and educative services to the workers&#x27; families; the final objective was to provide a welfare system to avoid strikes. The working day was reduced from twelve to nine hours in 1907.

By 1936 the holdings of the Garza, Calderón, and Sada families and their associates were divided into two groups: the Cuauhtemoc (brewery) group and the Vidriera (glass) group. In that year, the family&#x27;s holdings were reorganized, creating Valores Industriales S.A. (VISA) as a controlling the majority of shares of the firms formerly held by Cuauhtemoc, especially Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc and Famosa.

During the 20th century, Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma was headed by José Calderón Muguerza and the two Garza Sada brothers Eugenio Garza Sada (assassinated in 1973 in a kidnapping attempt by Mexican left-wing guerrillas) and Roberto Garza Sada. In 1943, company executive Eugenio Garza Sada with his brother and other prominent people, founded the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM), and in 1973, the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame was opened at the site of the company headquarters.

After Eugenio Garza Sada&#x27;s assassination, VISA, the Cerveceria Cuauthtemoc Moctezuma&#x27;s holding, was split into two units: Visa and Grupo Industrial Alfa. Alfa received Hylsa and cash, while Visa retained the brewery business and its stake in the Banco de Londres and its affiliated institutions, and Eugenio Garza Lagüera, a son of Eugenio Garza Sada, was named CEO of Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma, and Bernardo Garza Sada a son of Roberto Garza Sada was named CEO of Alfa.

When oil prices fell in 1981, Mexico&#x27;s economic boom, financed with borrowed money, abruptly halted. Visa found itself more than $1 billion in debt the following year, and the federal government nationalized Banca Serfin—the nation&#x27;s third-largest bank—in which Visa held a 77 percent stake. The nondeposit banks and associated financial companies in Grupo Financiero Serfin, not nationalized, were reorganized into a new financial-services group called Valores de Monterrey (Vamsa). Vamsa&#x27;s life-insurance subsidiary, Seguros Monterrey, was the largest in Mexico.

With the integration of the Moctezuma brewery in 1985, the Dos Equis, Superior, Sol, and Noche Buena brands were added to the Carta Blanca, Tecate, Bohemia and Indio brands.

In 1988 Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A. de C.V. was formed as the main subsidiary of Visa containing beer and other companies. In 1994 FEMSA sold a 22 percent share of its beer business to John Labatt Ltd. of Canada and signed an agreement with Labatt to associate their respective companies in the United States. FEMSA became the successor of Visa in 1998. On 11 January 2010, the Dutch brewing company Heineken International announced it would acquire the beer activities of FEMSA, including Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewery.

In 2017 Heineken Mexico (Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma) and Molson Coors signed a deal to import Cerveza Sol to areas in the US where Heineken didn’t already import Sol. This deal also allowed Heineken Mexico (Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma) to import Molson Coors Miller and Coors brands to Mexico, a deal similar to Molson Coors importing Heineken France&#x27;s Killian&#x27;s to the US.

==Breweries==
The company operates plants in Monterrey, Tecate, Navojoa, Guadalajara, Toluca, Orizaba and for 2012 one in Chihuahua.

The company has an annual production of .

==Beers==
The company produces several types of pale and dark lagers, some of which are available only in Mexico.

===Carta Blanca===
The brewery&#x27;s original premium beer. Carta Blanca takes its name from the French &quot;&quot;.

===Sol===

Introduced in the 1890s, originally called El Sol. Sol is for sale in four sizes in Mexico: , -not refundable aluminium can, bottles and , this last is known as a &quot;Caguama&quot; (English: &quot;Sea turtle&quot;). New variations from Cerveza Sol include: Sol Brava (a dark beer in a light dark bottle), Sol Light, Sol Sal y Limón (Sol with lime and salt) Sol Clamato (Beer mixed with Clamato) and Sol Cero (non-alcohol beer).

===Indio===
Indio beer has six sizes: Aluminium can , -not refundable and bottles plus a refundable and not-refundable bottle, a refundable bottle and a refundable bottle.

===Bohemia===
Bohemia 4.9% alc. takes its name from the Czech region. It is pale pilsner, although recently a new dark Vienna beer has been launched as Bohemia Obscura (see Image gallery below). In addition, Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma has added a craft-style wheat beer to the line – &quot;Bohemia Weizen&quot; a German Kristallweizen was released in summer 2011.

===Dos Equis===
Dos Equis () is a lager that was brewed by the German Wilhelm Hasse in Mexico who originally founded the brewery and named it after the Aztec ruler Moctezuma.
The brand was named &quot;Siglo XX&quot; (&quot;20th century&quot;) to commemorate the arrival of the new century, and the bottles were marked with the Roman numeral for 20 (&quot;XX&quot;), thus &quot;Dos Equis&quot; which is Spanish for &quot;two Xs&quot;.

The main brand Dos Equis XX Special Lager is a 4.45% abv pale lager sold in green bottles. Dos Equis XX Amber (in Mexico, Dos Equis Ambar) is a 4.7% Vienna-style amber lager sold in brown bottles, and was first exported to the United States in 1973. In November 2020, Dos Equis Lager Salt &amp; Lime was introduced into limited markets (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Louisiana, and Hawaii) in 24 oz. cans, with 12 oz. six-packs available beginning in Spring 2021.

Dos Equis XX Mexican Pale Ale (MPA) is a 5.5% traditional pale ale with a Mexican twist, released in late 2018 on draught to various restaurants and bars across the United States. As of February 2019 it could be purchased as a six pack of bottles or a twelve pack of cans.

The packaging received a redesign in August 2020, with increased focus on the XX symbol and the brand&#x27;s colours.

===Tecate===

Tecate and Tecate Light are popular pale lagers named after the city of Tecate, Baja California, where they were first produced in 1943. Originally brewed by a local company, Tecate was acquired by Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma in 1955. Tecate is sold in both distinctive red and blue aluminium cans and in twist-top bottles. Tecate Light was launched in 1992 by Héctor Emilio Ayala, who was the project manager.

In 2013, Tecate Titanium, containing a greater amount of alcohol, was launched as a new product of the company. In 2019, Tecate Titanium, which contains 7.5% ABV, became available in a 24 oz. can. The campaign, &quot;We Are Bold&quot;, targets males, specifically Hispanic C-store shoppers, according to Tecate Brand Director, Belen Pamukoff.

In 2017, Heineken announced that Tecate would be exported worldwide.

==Advertising==

===Dos Equis===
In 2007, Dos Equis inaugurated its &quot;The Most Interesting Man in the World&quot; advertising campaign.

The advertisements feature a bearded, debonair older gentleman (originally portrayed by actor Jonathan Goldsmith) with &quot;Frontline&quot; narrator Will Lyman conducting voiceovers. As Ottmar Liebert&#x27;s &quot;Barcelona Nights&quot; plays in the background, the advertisements featured a montage of daring exploits involving &quot;the most interesting man&quot; when he was younger. The precise settings are never revealed, but he performs feats such as: freeing an angry bear from a painful-looking bear trap; shooting a pool trick shot before an audience; catching a marlin while cavorting in a Hemingway-esque scene with a young woman; winning an arm-wrestling match in a South American setting; surfing a rogue wave; and bench pressing two young women in a casino setting, each woman being seated in a chair.

In the commercial he says, &quot;I don&#x27;t always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis.&quot; Each commercial ends with the sign-off: &quot;Stay thirsty, my friends.&quot;

After nearly a decade of being the mascot for the beer, Goldsmith&#x27;s version of the character was sent on a one-way trip to Mars in a commercial. From September 2016, &quot;The Most Interesting Man in the World&quot; is a French actor named Augustin Legrand.

The campaign was ended in 2018, and replaced with a new campaign called &quot;Keep It Interesante&quot;.

===Tecate===
Tecate beer has begun advertising heavily in the United States; initially in the Spanish-language media and more recently in the English-language media. Their tag lines are &quot;Con Carácter&quot; (&quot;With Character&quot;) and &quot;It&#x27;s not beer, it&#x27;s cerveza&quot;.

Tecate was the primary sponsor of Mexican race driver Adrián Fernández during his career in CART in the 1990s and early 2000s.

In the mid 2000s, Tecate became a major sponsor in boxing. It partnered with Golden Boy Promotions in 2006, then switched to Top Rank, then returned to Golden Boy in 2016, sponsoring TV Azteca and Solo boxeo shows, and signing world champions Manny Pacquiao and Canelo Álvarez.

In 2009, Tecate Light launched a television ad campaign targeted at the Mexican-American community, which features boxer Oscar de La Hoya and wrestler Rey Mysterio Jr. Also in 2009, Tecate announced a sponsorship agreement with ESPN sports.

In the 2007 movie &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot;, Hellboy is shown drinking Tecate Light with Abraham Sapien and in a locker room with Krauss.

In the 2014 movie &quot;That Awkward Moment&quot;, with actors Zac Efron and Miles Teller, Efron&#x27;s character is shown drinking Tecate with his friends in their New York apartment.

In 2015 a series of ads were recorded with the action actor Sylvester Stallone in his role of Rocky Balboa, in this campaign Rocky appears saying the phrase &quot;Te hace falta ver más box&quot; (In English &quot;You need to watch more boxing&quot;) in which he gives a cold stare to some men that are not acting so &quot;manly&quot; (e.g. listening to pop music or putting on too many clothes for cold weather). In the end Stallone says that &quot;&quot;Somos box&quot; (&quot;We are box&quot;&quot;) while retired boxers are shown and &quot;Eye of the tiger&quot; from Survivor) is played. In Mexico the word is changed to &quot;Bax&quot;, as Stallone uses the American English pronunciation for the sport. At the end of the commercial, Rocky looks moved by the progress of the people he helped only to receive a cold stare from Stallone himself.

Stallone later led another Mexican ad campaign with soccer players and even his rival from &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, Dolph Lundgren, to help some Mexican fans to support the National Team in the World Cup 2018.

Tecate signed Mexican boxer Canelo Álvarez in 2016.

During the 2016 presidential election campaign, Tecate ran a television ad mocking Donald Trump&#x27;s proposal to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. The &quot;Tecate Beer Wall&quot; is &quot;a wall that brings us together, and it&#x27;s going to be huge. You&#x27;re welcome, America&quot;.

In February 2020, the new campaign, &quot;Mexico Is in Us&quot; was launched. While the brand is moving away from &quot;macho marketing&quot; campaigns, it remains unapologetically, a Mexican-American beer.

<text>William R. Hoel (7 March 1824 – 23 May 1879) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. A native of Butler County, Ohio, Hoel was a Mississippi River steamboat pilot when he entered the United States Navy 19 October 1861.

==Family life==
Hoel&#x27;s first wife was Mary Riley, daughter of Daniel Riley, of Cincinnati. His second wife was Elizabeth Hunt, eldest daughter of Dr. Samuel Pancoast Hunt and his wife Elizabeth Thomas, of Morrow, Warren County, Ohio. Captain Hoel and Elizabeth Hoel had two children: Sarah Elizabeth Hoel and Rion Hoel.

==Opening the Mississippi==
On 6 February 1862, while serving as the First Master of , Hoel was wounded during the Battle of Fort Henry. Less than two months later, on 4 April, he volunteered to pilot gunboat &quot;Carondelet&quot; in her famous run past the Rebel batteries at Island Number 10 to reach Maj. Gen. John Pope&#x27;s Army at New Madrid. The gunboat&#x27;s valiant dash through a hailstorm of Confederate fire enabled Union forces to cross the river and to take this key island with quantities of cannon, equipment and stores. It thus opened the Mississippi for operations by Union gunboats bringing the Federal armies in a long stride to within sight of Memphis.

Hoel&#x27;s courageous and skillful service on this occasion won the praise of Flag-Officer Andrew H. Foote, the thanks of the Navy from Secretary Gideon Welles, and promotion to the rank of Acting Volunteer Lieutenant effective 29 April 1862.

On 10 May 1862 Hoel assumed command of &quot;Cincinnati&quot; when serious wounds incapacitated her captain, Commander Roger N. Stembel. The new commander of the Western Flotilla, Captain Charles Henry Davis, took this opportunity to express his admiration of Hoel. &quot;I can not praise more than they deserve his high valor and ability. He sets the highest example to those below him, and if it were possible to give him a permanent position worthy of his merits, the Navy would be the gainer ...&quot;

==The Vicksburg campaign==
On 29 October, Hoel then took command of USS &quot;Pittsburg&quot; on which he served with distinction in the campaign to take Vicksburg. One of Lieutenant Hoel&#x27;s exploits during this campaign is of special interest since it foreshadowed the heroism of the World War II destroyer which bore his name, USS &quot;Hoel&quot;.

On 29 April 1863, as Acting Rear Admiral David D. Porter&#x27;s flotilla was bombarding the Confederate Batteries at Grand Gulf, his flagship, USS &quot;Benton&quot;, became unmanageable and was caught under heavy fire in a position where she could neither steer nor reply to the enemy guns. On seeing Porter&#x27;s predicament, Hoel slipped the &quot;Pittsburg&quot; in between &quot;Benton&quot; and the flaming Rebel batteries to protect her by taking the fire himself. In the next 10 minutes his heroism cost the &quot;Pittsburg&quot; 6 men killed and 8 wounded, but the sacrifice allowed &quot;Benton&quot; to extricate herself from the deadly trap.

The bombardment was so successful that the next day General Ulysses Grant safely moved his troops across the Mississippi to begin the operations which at long last isolated and captured Vicksburg.

Hoel was promoted to Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Commander on 10 November 1864.

==In command of USS &quot;Vindicator&quot;==
Detached from &quot;Pittsburg&quot;, he then took command of USS &quot;Vindicator&quot; 1 March 1865 on which he served until 7 July 1865. He was honorably discharged on 30 December 1865.

==Postwar==
Hoel returned to piloting, was active in the Grand Army of the Republic, and eventually served as master of the lighthouse tender &quot;Lily&quot;.

In 1867, Hoel traveled on the Quaker City ship to Europe and the Holy Land along with other tourists, including Mark Twain, which Twain wrote about in his book The Innocents Abroad.

==Death==
He married a second time but became suspicious of his wife Elizabeth&#x27;s relationship with a local doctor. He confronted them with a pistol in May 1879 but was shot and killed in the struggle. After an inquest, the doctor was not charged with any crime.

<doc id="1264560" wikidata="Q699569" url="?curid=1264560" title="1965 West German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in West Germany on 19 September 1965 to elect the members of the 5th Bundestag. The CDU/CSU remained the largest faction, while the Social Democratic Party remained the largest single party in the Bundestag, winning 217 of the 518 seats (including 15 of the 22 non-voting delegates for West Berlin).

==Campaign==
Federal Chancellor Ludwig Erhard was initially popular as the acclaimed &quot;father&quot; of West Germany&#x27;s economic miracle of the 1950s and early 1960s. West Germany&#x27;s economy still seemed solid in 1965, and thus not enough West German voters wanted to change the party of Federal Chancellor. To ensure his victory in this Bundestag election, Erhard promised to cut income tax and to increase social program spending.

==Results==
===Results by state===
==== Constituency seats ====
==== List seats ====
== Aftermath ==
The coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP returned to government, with Ludwig Erhard as Chancellor. In 1966, the FDP left the coalition over budget issues, and Erhard resigned. Kurt Georg Kiesinger (also CDU) formed a new grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SPD which lasted until the next election.

<doc id="1264568" wikidata="Q327142" url="?curid=1264568" title="Yaşar Kemal">
<text>Yaşar Kemal (; born Kemal Sadık Gökçeli; 6 October 1923 – 28 February 2015) was a leading Turkish writer of Kurdish descent and human rights activist from Turkey. He received 38 awards during his lifetime and had been a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature on the strength of his 1955 novel &quot;Memed, My Hawk&quot;.

An outspoken intellectual, he often did not hesitate to speak about sensitive issues, especially those concerning the oppression of the Kurdish people. He was tried in 1995 under anti-terror laws for an article he wrote for &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; highlighting the Turkish Army&#x27;s destruction of Kurdish villages during the Turkish–Kurdish conflict. He was released but later received a suspended 20-month jail sentence for another article he wrote criticising racism in Turkey, especially against the Kurds.

==Early life and education==

Yaşar Kemal was born Kemal Sadık Gökçeli to Sadık and Nigâr on 6 October 1923 in Hemite (now Gökçedam), a Turkmen hamlet in the province of Osmaniye in southern Turkey. He was born into the only Kurdish family in the village but didn&#x27;t face discrimination despite his ethnic difference. Kemal had a difficult childhood, and his family had to flee from Van province to Diyarbakır province. From there, they were deported to Adana province. He lost his right eye in a knife accident while his father was slaughtering a sheep for Eid al-Adha. When he was five years old he witnessed his father being stabbed to death by his adoptive son Yusuf while praying in a mosque. These traumatic experiences left Kemal with a speech impediment, which lasted until he was twelve years old. At nine, Kemal began school in a neighbouring village; he continued his formal education in Kadirli in Osmaniye province.

Kemal was a locally noted bard even before he began school but was unappreciated by his widowed mother until he composed an elegy on the death of one of her eight brothers, all of whom were bandits. He became interested in writing as a means to record his work after talking to an itinerant peddler, who was doing his accounts. His village paid his way to university in Istanbul.

He worked for a while for rich farmers as a labourer in the Çukurova cotton fields, ostensibly guarding river water against poor farmers&#x27; unauthorised use for irrigation. However, he actually taught the poor farmers how to steal the water undetected, by taking it at night. Later he worked as a letter-writer, then as a journalist, and finally as a novelist. The Turkish police confiscated his first two novels. In 1950, Kemal was imprisoned for alleged communist activities. He visited Akdamar Island in 1951, where he saw the beginning of the planned demolition of the island&#x27;s Holy Cross Church. Using his contacts, he helped stop the demolition (the church was restored by the Turkish government in 2005).

== Professional and political career ==
He then moved to Istanbul to work for the &quot;Cumhuriyet&quot; newspaper, where he adopted his pen name.

In 1962, Kemal joined the Workers Party of Turkey (TİP) and &quot;served as one of its leaders until quitting after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968&quot;. In 1967, Kemal established the Marxist magazine &quot;Ant&quot; together with Dogan Özgüden and . The magazine published articles about Engels, Marx, Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara. In the aftermath of the military coup in 1971, the magazine was closed during the crackdown on left-wing politicians. Because of the spate of political assassinations during the 1976–1980 political violence in Turkey, Kemal moved to Sweden for a time. He was often arrested for his political activities. In 1995, he was prosecuted for making separatist propaganda after writing an article for Index on Censorship, because of his support for Kurdish dissidents. He was sentenced to 20 months and received a suspended sentence in March 1996. In December 2000, he was involved in negotiations over the hunger strikes against the F-Type prisons.

==Later years and death==
On 14 January 2015, Kemal was hospitalised at Istanbul University&#x27;s Çapa Medical Faculty, due to respiratory insufficiency. During the afternoon of 28 February 2015, he died in the intensive care unit, where he had been admitted for multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Following a religious funeral service held at Teşvikiye Mosque, attended by former Turkish president Abdullah Gül, political party leaders, high-ranking officials and an enormous assembly of mourners, he was buried on 2 March 2015 beside his first wife Thilda&#x27;s grave in Zincirlikuyu Cemetery. Kemal was survived by his wife Ayşe Semiha Baban and his adoptive son, visual artist Ahmet Güneştekin.

==Works==
In 1943 Kemal published his first book &quot;Ağıtlar&quot; (&quot;Ballads&quot;), a compilation of folkloric themes. This book brought to light many long-forgotten rhymes and ballads, which he had begun to collect at the age of sixteen. He penned his first tale &quot;Pis Hikaye&quot; (&quot;The Dirty Story&quot;) in 1944 while serving in the military in Kayseri. His stories &quot;Bebek&quot; (&quot;The Baby&quot;), &quot;Dükkancı&quot; (&quot;The Shopkeeper&quot;) and &quot;Memet ile Memet&quot; (&quot;Memet and Memet&quot;) were published in 1950. Then he published a book of short stories &quot;Sarı Sıcak&quot; (&quot;Yellow Heat&quot;) in 1952. His books initially focused on the lives, sufferings and toil of the people of the Çukurova plain. Kemal used the legends and stories of Anatolia extensively as the basis for his works.

In 1955 he received international acclaim with the publication of &quot;Memed, My Hawk&quot; (). In this book, Kemal criticised the fabric of society via a protagonist who flees to the mountains as a result of the oppression of the ağas. Kemal won nineteen literary prizes over his lifetime, and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973 by Dag Strömbäck and Per Wästberg. The novel was adapted into a 1984 film of the same name, starring Peter Ustinov.

His 1955 novel &quot;Teneke&quot; was adapted into a theatrical play, which ran for almost a year in Gothenburg, in Sweden, the country in which he lived for about two years in the late 1970s. Italian composer Fabio Vacchi adapted the same novel with its original title into a three-act opera, which premiered at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Italy, in 2007.

== Personal life ==
In 1952, Yaşar Kemal married Thilda Serrero, a member of a prominent Sephardi Jewish family in Istanbul. Her grandfather, Jak Mandil Pasha, was the chief physician of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. She translated seventeen of her husband&#x27;s works into English. In 2001 Thilda predeceased Yaşar, dying, aged 78, from pulmonary complications in an Istanbul hospital. She was buried in Zincirlikuyu Cemetery. Thilda was also survived by her son Raşit Göğçel and a grandchild.

Yaşar Kemal remarried on 1 August 2002. His second spouse was Ayşe Semiha Baban, a lecturer in public relations at Istanbul Bilgi University in Istanbul who had been educated at the American University of Beirut, Boğaziçi University and Harvard University.

<text>Attwater&#x27;s prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri) is a highly endangered subspecies of the greater prairie-chicken that is native to coastal Texas and formerly Louisiana in the United States.

==Description==
Attwater&#x27;s prairie-chicken measures 17–18 in (43–45.5 cm) and weighs roughly 1.5 to 2.0 lb (0.7 to 0.9 kg). It has a 28-in (70-cm) wingspan. These grouse have strong vertical bars of dark brown and buff-white pattern over the mantle, flanks, and underparts. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the males having elongated feathers, called pinnae, erected to form what looks like ear-like structures. The male also has as a bright orange or golden air sac on either side of his neck, which he inflates during mating displays. They have a lifespan of 2–5 years.

==Habitat and range==
&quot;T. c. attwateri&quot; is endemic to the Western Gulf coastal grasslands. Its range historically stretched west from Bayou Teche in Louisiana to the Nueces River in Texas, possibly as far south as Tamaulipas, Mexico, and inland for . This covered an area of 6 million acres (24,000 km2). Today, populations exist in the wild at two locations: the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge near Eagle Lake, Texas, and on private lands in Goliad County.

==Reproduction==
The mating display can be seen January through mid-May, peaking in mid-March, when the birds gather in small groups on short grass, bare ground, or hilly areas to choose a mate. This area is called a lek or &quot;booming ground.&quot; In these areas, the females watch the males and choose their mate. The male emits a booming, &quot;woo-woo&quot; sound from his neck sack, causing it to inflate, and struts around to attract a female. Some of the traditional dances of the North American Plains Indians are based on this booming display.

In late spring, the hens lay 10 to 14 eggs in nests on the ground, hidden in tall grass. The eggs hatch about 26 days later. Only about 3 in 10 eggs hatch and the others are lost to predators. The chicks stay with the hen for about six weeks.

==Diet and predation==
This species has a diverse diet, eating grass shoots, petals of flowers, seeds, and insects such as grasshoppers. Their predators include hawks, owls, coyotes, raccoons, skunks, opossums, and snakes. Chicks are susceptible to flooding.

==Conservation==
In 1900, up to 1,000,000 Attwater&#x27;s prairie-chickens inhabited the coastal grasslands. Loss of habitat is believed to be the prime reason for their decline. One of the major factors contributing to the habitat loss was the widespread planting, beginning in the early 1900s, of Chinese tallow trees (&quot;Triadica sebifera&quot;) to establish a soapmaking industry. Since that time, &quot;T. sebifera&quot; has proven to be an aggressive invader of the coastal grasslands, where it displaces the diverse native plant assemblage that was dominated by prairie grasses and forbs with dense, near-monospecific stands that significantly alter biotic and abiotic ecosystem processes. Coastal prairies have also declined with the invasion of non-native grasses such as Old World bluestems which create monocultures and change the structure of native grasslands. Urbanization has further contributed to habitat loss. As a result of these changes over the last 100 years, the grassland ecosystem where Attwater&#x27;s prairie-chicken once thrived exists in small, scattered patches whose continued existence is threatened. Where once grazing plains bison and periodic wildfires due to lightning reduced brush, the birds now have difficulty making their way through thick undergrowth. Other, less-apparent changes in the ecosystem possibly have had an effect as well.

A 1937 study recorded about 8,700 Attwater&#x27;s prairie-chickens remaining in four Texas counties. Attwater&#x27;s prairie-chicken has been on the endangered species list since March 1967 when an estimated 1,070 birds were left in the wild. By 2003, fewer than 50 birds remained in the wild.

In 1999, The Nature Conservancy decided to permit new drilling close to primary breeding grounds on Texas land owned by the Conservancy. That harmed the prairie-chicken population at that location in the view of some organizations, including the Wildlife Society. The number of Attwater&#x27;s prairie-chickens nesting on the land owned by the Conservancy fell from 36 in 1998 to 16 in 2003. Attwater&#x27;s
prairie-chickens have since disappeared from the site.
In 2014, an estimated 260 birds remained, with about 100 living in the wild. Captive-breeding programs are underway at places such as Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, Abilene Zoo, and Caldwell Zoo (Tyler, TX). Through a partnership with the Houston Zoo, a captive-breeding flock is residing on the grounds of the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center near Clear Lake.

In 2016, the population declined to 42 birds following heavy spring floods, which wiped out an entire generation of eggs. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was even more disastrous, likely killing at least 32 birds, with only five females found during the post-hurricane survey of the area. However, in the spring of 2018, the estimated wild population was 12. As of February 2019, with the Houston Zoo having released many individuals the previous year, the wild population was around 200. Since then, the wild population has decreased again. A count done later that year indicated only 108 birds remaining and a report from February 2021 stated fewer than 100.

== In popular culture ==
In 2023 Attwater&#x27;s prairie-chicken was featured on a United States Postal Service Forever stamp as part of the &quot;Endangered Species&quot; set, based on a photograph from Joel Sartore&#x27;s &quot;Photo Ark&quot;. The stamp was dedicated at a ceremony at the National Grasslands Visitor Center in Wall, South Dakota.

<text>Himatangi is a small settlement in the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is located at the junction of State Highways 1 and 56, 25 kilometres west of Palmerston North, and seven kilometres east of the coastal settlement of Himatangi Beach.

The area has two marae:
* Motuiti Marae and its Rakau or Paewai meeting house is affiliated with the Rangitāne hapū of Ngāti Mairehau and the Ngāti Raukawa hapū of Ngāti Rākau.
* Paranui Marae and its Turanga meeting house is affiliated with the Ngāti Raukawa hapū of Ngāti Te Au and Ngāti Tūranga.

About 50 Māori land blocks are located between Himatangi and Foxton to the south.

==History==

The area was largely undeveloped with rough terrain in 1942, according to a photograph held in the National Library of New Zealand.

Himatangi was once the location of the junction between the New Zealand Railways Department&#x27;s Foxton Branch railway and the Manawatu County Council&#x27;s Sanson Tramway. Both lines are now closed; use of the Tramway ceased in 1945, followed by the Branch in 1959.

In 2005, a study found agricultural pesticides were being rapidly leached into the sandy soil at Himatangi.

In 2009, planning approval was granted for the building of a piggery after the landowner agreed to reduce from what he originally proposed.

In 2014, the community was used as a trial community for the Horizons Regional Council&#x27;s emergency readiness plan. The landowner and New Zealand Pork Board had been considering legal action through the Environment Court.

In 2019 a regional bus service between Levin and Palmerston North was introduced, providing a weekly return service between Himatangi and Foxton.

<text>Stanard &quot;Stan&quot; Ridgway (born April 5, 1954) is an American singer-songwriter, and film and television composer known for his distinctive voice, dramatic lyrical narratives, and eclectic solo albums. He was the original lead singer and a founding member of the band Wall of Voodoo.

==Early life==
Stan Ridgway was born in Barstow, California, in the &quot;high desert&quot;, and raised in Los Angeles. He claims to have been a budding ventriloquist who spent his first night in jail at the age of 12 for stealing street signs. Ridgway also had a childhood fascination with folk music, pestering his parents until they bought him a banjo at the age of 14.

==Wall of Voodoo==
The band was named by Ridgway before their first show, in reference to a comment made by a friend, while recording and overdubbing a Kalamazoo Rhythm Ace drum machine, which was a gift from voice actor Daws Butler. While listening to some of the music created in the studio, Ridgway jokingly compared the multiple-drum-machine and Farfisa-organ-laden recordings to Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound, whereupon the friend commented it sounded more like a &quot;wall of voodoo&quot; and the name stuck.

Wall of Voodoo&#x27;s music was a mix of new wave and Ennio Morricone&#x27;s Spaghetti Western soundtracks of the 1960s. Adding to the music&#x27;s distinctiveness was percussive and textural experimentation, i.e. mixing drum machines with unconventional instruments such as pots, pans and various kitchen utensils, raw electronics with interlocking melodic figures as well as twangy spaghetti-western guitar. On top of the mix was Ridgway&#x27;s unusual vocal style and highly stylized, cinematic narratives heavily influenced by science fiction and film noir, sung from the perspective of ordinary people and characters wrestling with ironies inside the American Dream.

==Solo career==

Ridgway embarked on a solo career in 1983, shortly after Wall of Voodoo&#x27;s appearance at the US Festival. He collaborated on the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Box Me In&quot; with Stewart Copeland for the soundtrack to Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;. In 1986 he released his first proper solo album, &quot;The Big Heat&quot;, which included the top 5 European (including UK) hit &quot;Camouflage&quot;. This was followed by numerous other solo recordings: &quot;Mosquitos&quot; (1989), &quot;Partyball&quot; (1991), &quot;Black Diamond&quot; (1995), &quot;Anatomy&quot; (1999), &quot;The Way I Feel Today&quot; (1998), a collection of big band standards, and &quot;Holiday in Dirt&quot; (2002), a compilation of outtakes and previously unreleased songs. Ridgway&#x27;s album &quot;Snakebite: Blacktop Ballads and Fugitive Songs&quot; (2005), features the narrative song, &quot;Talkin&#x27; Wall Of Voodoo Blues Pt. 1&quot;, a history of his former band in song.

Ridgway&#x27;s album &quot;Holiday in Dirt&quot; was a quasi-cinematic project, with the release of the album accompanied by a showing of 14 short films by various independent filmmakers, each film a visual interpretation of one of the songs on the album. A compilation DVD of the films was released in February 2005.
In 1994, Ridgway began work on a new project in the form of a trio called Drywall, the other members of the trio being Ridgway&#x27;s wife, keyboardist/vocalist Pietra Wexstun of the band Hecate&#x27;s Angels (who had previously worked with Ridgway on &quot;Mosquitos&quot; and &quot;Partyball&quot;), and former Rain Parade drummer Ivan Knight. In 1995, Drywall released its first album (first of a &quot;trilogy of apocalyptic documents&quot;), titled &quot;Work the Dumb Oracle&quot;. A short film directed by Carlos Grasso, titled &quot;The Drywall Incident&quot;, was released the same year. An extended, instrumental soundtrack album for &quot;The Drywall Incident&quot; was released in 1996.

Ridgway and Wexstun also collaborated and forayed into new musical territory, composing a suite of mostly instrumental and orchestral pieces to accompany an exhibition of postmodern surrealist artist Mark Ryden&#x27;s paintings after being introduced by a mutual friend, Sean P. Riley, who toured with Wall of Voodoo on their 1982 &quot;Call of the West – Tour of Virtue&quot; as the band&#x27;s merchandiser. The album was released on CD in 2003 as &quot;Blood – Miniature Paintings of Sorrow and Fear&quot; in a unique 3-panel packaging design by the artist, which quickly sold out of its limited pressing of 7,500. Ridgway plays banjo and harmonica in Wexstun&#x27;s group Hecate&#x27;s Angels.

Ridgway and Drywall regrouped in 2006 to release the album &quot;Barbeque Babylon&quot;, the third &quot;apocalyptic document&quot; with the single &quot;The AARP Is After Me&quot;. The new Drywall lineup features Rick King on guitars and bass and Bruce Zelesnik on drums and percussion. In 2008, Ridgway and Wexstun released &quot;Silly Songs for Kids Vol. 1&quot;, a collection of children&#x27;s songs that feature the duo and also saxophonist and woodwind player Ralph Carney.

Ridgway has also contributed to albums and projects by producer Hal Willner, Frank Black and the Catholics, the Flesh Eaters, the Divine Horsemen, The Ray Campi Quartet, the Fibonaccis, and Roger McGuinn.

<text>David S. Young (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2003. He represented the riding of Willowdale and served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.

==Background==
Young was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. He was educated at Osgoode Hall Law School of York University in Toronto, and practised law after his graduation. He worked at the firm of &quot;Benson McMurtry&quot; from 1981 to 1987, and has been a partner in &quot;Benson Percival Brown&quot; since 1987. Young has also served as a director of the Canadian Society for Yad Vashem, and was for ten years an executive member of the Ratepayer&#x27;s Association.

In 2021, David was awarded the Gold Key Achievement Award by the Osgoode Hall Alumni Association. The award recognizes exceptional professional success and leadership and is bestowed upon candidates that have demonstrated a record of professional accomplishment, leadership and contribution to the community.

He and his wife Ellen live in Toronto, Ontario, where they raised three children.

==Politics==
He began his political career as a school trustee, serving on the North York Public School Board from 1991 to 1997. In the provincial election of 1999, he was elected to the Ontario legislature for the north Toronto riding of Willowdale, defeating Liberal candidate Fahimeh Mortazavi by about 3,500 votes.

Young was named Attorney General and Minister responsible for Native Affairs in the government of Mike Harris on February 8, 2001. He was generally regarded as one of the more centrist figures in Harris&#x27;s government, and supported Ernie Eves to replace Harris as Premier in 2002. When Eves was sworn into office on April 15, 2002, he kept Young in the Attorney-General&#x27;s portfolio.

In 2002, Young introduced the Legal Aid Services Amendment Act (Bill 181), which permitted Legal Aid Ontario to hire staff lawyers and contract with individual lawyers and law firms. The Bill was intended to improve Ontario&#x27;s justice system by granting Legal Aid Ontario enhanced flexibility to permit them to enter into fee-for-service agreements with qualified lawyers and law firms to provide legal aid services in a given community, and expand the functions of family and criminal law duty counsel. Critics argued against the intermingling of the private and public sectors, and suggested that the Bill would lead to a two-tiered legal system in Ontario. Young also increased the hourly payment rates of Legal Aid Ontario workers by 5% an hour.

After a cabinet shuffle on February 25, 2003, Young became the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.

Many expected that Young would be re-elected in the provincial election of 2003, despite a general decline in Tory support throughout Toronto. Young&#x27;s performance in cabinet was generally respected, and he was sometimes described as a possible successor to Eves as party leader. The provincial trend, however, was too much to overcome: the Tories were defeated in all of their Toronto seats, and Young lost the Willowdale riding to Liberal candidate David Zimmer by 1,866 votes.

In 2014, David served as a senior advisor, executive committee member and legal counsel to the successful John Tory campaign for Mayor of Toronto.

<text>Malvaviscus is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. Common names for species in this genus include Turk&#x27;s cap mallow, wax mallow, sleeping hibiscus, and mazapan. It belongs to a group of genera that differ from the closely related &quot;Hibiscus&quot; in possessing a fruit divided into 5 separate parts (a schizocarp), and having a style surmounted by 10, rather than 5, capitate or capitellate stigmas. Among those genera &quot;Malvaviscus&quot; is distinguished by having auriculate petals and red, fleshy fruits.
The generic name is derived from the Latin words &quot;malva&quot;, meaning &quot;mallow,&quot; and &quot;viscus&quot;, which means &quot;sticky,&quot; referring to the mucilaginous sap produced by members of the genus.
The fruit can be used to make jelly or syrup. Both the fruit and flowers are used to make herbal teas.

<doc id="1264590" wikidata="Q699574" url="?curid=1264590" title="1961 West German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in West Germany on 17 September 1961 to elect the members of the fourth Bundestag. The CDU/CSU remained the largest faction, winning 242 of the 499 seats. However, the loss of its majority and the All-German Party losing all its seats led to the CDU having to negotiate a coalition with the long-term junior coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, leading to a demand for long-term chancellor Konrad Adenauer to leave office in 1963, halfway through his term.

==Campaign==

The election campaign occurred in the context of the Berlin Crisis and the erection of the Berlin Wall.

For the first time, the SPD announced a Chancellor candidate who was not chairman of the party: Willy Brandt, the Governing Mayor of West Berlin. After the building of the Berlin Wall, he gained more and more sympathy, while chancellor Konrad Adenauer was criticised for not showing enough support for the people of West Berlin. Adenauer had to save the absolute majority of CDU and CSU, but, considering his age and his long term as chancellor, there were big doubts if he should lead the country in a fourth term.

==Results==
===Results by state===
==== Constituency seats ====
==== List seats ====
== Aftermath ==
The absolute majority was lost by the conservative union due to the gains of the liberal FDP under Erich Mende. From 1961 on, the Union, SPD and FDP established an electoral &quot;triopoly&quot; in the Bundestag that would last until 1983.

Konrad Adenauer remained Chancellor, building a coalition between the CDU/CSU-FDP. In 1962 he had to announce a fifth cabinet: The FDP had temporarily left the coalition after the secretary of defense, Franz Josef Strauß (CSU), had ordered the arrest of five journalists for publishing a memo detailing alleged weaknesses in the German armed forces (known as the Spiegel scandal). In 1963 Adenauer finally retired; Ludwig Erhard took over his position as head of the coalition government.

<doc id="1264596" wikidata="Q1496614" url="?curid=1264596" title="Ngazargamu">
<text>Ngazargamu, Birni Ngazargamu, Birnin Gazargamu, Gazargamo or N&#x27;gazargamu, was the capital of the Bornu Empire from ca. 1460 to 1809. Situated west of Lake Chad in the Yobe State of modern Nigeria, the remains of the former capital city are still visible. The surrounding wall is long and in parts it is still up to high.

The capital city was built in , during the reign of Mai Ali Gazi (1476–1503). It was located in the fork of the Komadugu Gana River and the Komadugu Yobe, near present-day Geidam.

The city became Bornu&#x27;s leading center for Islamic education under Idris Alooma.

In 1808, Gazargamo was taken by the Fulani Jihad.

== Toponymy ==
The first segment of N&#x27;gazargamu, which is &quot;N&#x27;gasar&quot;, indicates that the earlier residents of the area were known as either N&#x27;gasar or N&#x27;gizim. The latter segment of the word, &quot;gamu&quot; or &quot;kumu&quot;, shares similarities with the initial portion of the name &quot;Gwombe&quot; and can signify either (i) a leader or monarch or (ii) a revered ancestral spirit.

Based on the Kanuri pronunciation, the correct spelling of the city is &quot;Birni Gazargamu&quot;. The spellings &quot;N&#x27;gazargamu&quot; or &quot;Birnin Gazargamu&quot; are likely of Hausa origin.

== History ==
During the late 14th-century, the Sayfawa dynasty, which had ruled Kanem for centuries, fled their capital of Birni Njimi due to a civil war. They settled in Bornu, a southern province of Kanem. The civil war continued throughout much of the 15th-century until the reign of Ali Gaji, who succeeded in defeating his rivals and brought an end to the war. Ali Gaji then established Birni Gazargamu, a fortified city that served as the capital of Kanem-Bornu until the 19th-century.

Little is known of the physical appearance or population of the city. The city was surrounded by a circular wall spanning approximately two kilometers in diameter, with the Mai&#x27;s palace, constructed of red bricks, occupying its center. A description of the city was given by one Mallam Salih ibn Ishaku and translated by H R Palmer:At N&#x27;gazargamu [sic] there were six hundred and sixty roads cleared and widened, called Le. Sixty of these roads were well known to the Amir [Mai], for he traversed them, but many of the roads were unknown to the Amir since he did not traverse them and so did not know them . . . There were four Friday mosques. Each of these mosques had an Imam for Friday who led the Friday prayer with the people. At each mosque there were twelve thousand worshippers. Gazargamu emerged as a major trading hub within the Sudan region. By the 17th-century, the city&#x27;s markets attracted caravans from various directions: Tunis, Tripoli, and Cairo in the north; Timbuktu, Awdaghust, Agades, and Gao in the west; and Kordofan and the Nile regions in the east. These trade caravans transported a variety of goods, including silk, carpets, weapons, and books from the Middle East; paper and glass beads from Venice; leather products, copperware, and tobacco from the Maghreb; and gold and kola nuts from Ashanti in the south.

<doc id="1264598" wikidata="Q4818758" url="?curid=1264598" title="Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge">
<text>Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge is a federally protected refugium encompassing one of the largest remnants of coastal prairie habitat remaining in southeast Texas, United States, and home to one of the last populations of critically endangered Attwater&#x27;s prairie chickens, a ground-dwelling grouse of the coastal prairie ecosystem.

The 10,528-acre (43-km2) refuge, located in eastern Colorado County, about 60 miles (100 km) west of Houston, Texas, was established in 1972, and is one of a handful of national wildlife refuges managed specifically for an endangered species. In 1968, Attwater Prairie Chicken Preserve was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

In the mid-1960s, the World Wildlife Fund purchased of land to preserve some remaining coastal prairie for Attwater&#x27;s Prairie Chicken. The land was transferred to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1972, which brought the refuge up to its current acreage.

Many of the Attwater&#x27;s prairie chickens in the refuge are hatched at captive-breeding programs at Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, Texas A&amp;M University, SeaWorld San Antonio, Abilene Zoo, Caldwell Zoo, Houston Zoo, and San Antonio Zoo. Chicks are fitted with a radio transmitter and released at the refuge once they are capable of independent survival.

To maintain the prairie ecosystem, the refuge staff does prescribed burns of annually in January or February. The burns help invigorate the grasses by removing dead stems, and control the growth of brush and invasive species of plants. The staff also converts formerly cultivated land in the refuge back to prairie by replanting native grasses.

Over 250 species of birds in addition to Attwater&#x27;s prairie chicken have been observed in the refuge. Some of these include the fulvous whistling duck, black-bellied whistling duck, white-tailed hawk, crested caracara, scissor-tailed flycatcher, dickcissel, roseate spoonbill, anhinga, Sprague&#x27;s pipit, and sandhill crane. Mammals in the refuge include plains bison, thirteen-lined ground squirrel, bobcat, coyote, nine-banded armadillo, and white-tailed deer. American alligators share the ponds with softshell turtles. American bullfrog and 
upland chorus frog calls are heard in the refuge.

Indian paintbrush, bluebonnets, and butterfly milkweed are some of the many wildflowers that bloom in the park.

The refuge has an auto tour and two hiking trails. The auto tour loop winds through 5 miles (8 km) of coastal prairie habitat. The Pipit Trail to the Refuge Lake is 1.5 miles. The Sycamore Trail transects of coastal prairie and a section of forest in the Coushatta Creek bottomland.

The San Bernard River runs on the eastern boundary of the refuge.

<doc id="1264623" wikidata="Q93840" url="?curid=1264623" title="Mental As Anything">
<text>Mental As Anything are an Australian new wave and pop rock band that formed in Sydney in 1976. Its most popular line-up (which lasted from 1977 to 1999, and recorded all of their charting singles and albums) was Martin Plaza (birth name Martin Murphy) on vocals and guitar; Reg Mombassa (birth name Christopher O&#x27;Doherty) on lead guitar and vocals; his brother Peter &quot;Yoga Dog&quot; O&#x27;Doherty on bass guitar and vocals; Wayne de Lisle (birth name David Twohill) on drums; and Andrew &quot;Greedy&quot; Smith on vocals, keyboards and harmonica. Their original hit songs were generated by Mombassa, O&#x27;Doherty, Plaza and Smith, either individually or collectively; they also hit the Australian charts with covers of songs by Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, and Chuck Berry.

Their top ten Australian singles are &quot;If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too?&quot; and &quot;Too Many Times&quot; (both from 1981), &quot;Live It Up&quot; (1985) and &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (1988). Internationally, &quot;Too Many Times&quot; made the Canadian top 40 in 1982, and &quot;Live It Up&quot; peaked at No. 3 in the UK, No. 4 in Norway, and No. 6 in Germany, after it featured in the 1986 Australian film &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;.

All of the early members are visual artists and have had combined studio displays, some have had solo studio displays with Mombassa&#x27;s artwork also used as designs by the Mambo clothing company. The majority of the group&#x27;s record covers, posters and video clips have been designed and created by the band members or their art school contemporaries. On 27 August 2009, Mental As Anything was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside Kev Carmody, The Dingoes, Little Pattie and John Paul Young. Most of the original group members left during the 2000s, and Andrew &quot;Greedy&quot; Smith—the only original band member still touring with Mental As Anything—died on 2 December 2019, aged 63, after a heart attack. This effectively ended the band; although various surviving group members from the classic 1977-2000 era have participated in interviews for a book-length study of the Mentals and an upcoming film documentary, Mental As Anything has not been active as a recording or performing unit in the years since Smith&#x27;s death.

==Style==
Mental As Anything&#x27;s music is characterised by poppy, accessible and well-crafted melodies and lyrics, and their work showcases an ironic, satirical and self-deprecating sense of humour. They are a typically &quot;Australian&quot; rock group, with their music and their satirical, good-time image deeply rooted in the milieu of Australian suburbia, although two key members (the O&#x27;Doherty brothers) were in fact immigrants from New Zealand. The group&#x27;s art school background and visual design skills also made them pioneers of the music video form in Australia in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and their videos rank as some of the funniest and most imaginative produced in Australia at that time.

==History==
===1976–1979: Formation and early years===
The group formed at an art school in Sydney in 1976 when Martin Murphy (Martin Plaza) met fellow student, New Zealand-born Chris O&#x27;Doherty (Reg Mombassa) at Alexander Mackie College at East Sydney Technical College, now known as the National Art School. The duo was soon jamming in guitarist and vocalist O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Darlinghurst flat. Murphy, on guitar and vocals, brought in his college friend Steve Coburn (son of artist, John Coburn) on bass guitar, while another student, David Twohill (Wayne de Lisle), was recruited on drums.

They were first billed as Mental as Anything on 14 May 1976, after some early party appearances without a name. Prior to the gig at a Chippendale Settlement Dance, they provided the promoter, Paul Worstead, with a list of possible names. Worstead chose Mental As Anything—which was how fellow artist Ken Bolton described them after one of their earlier party performances—and designed an accompanying poster featuring an image of a truck hauling a giant cabbage. The phrase &quot;mental as anything&quot; is late 1970s Australian slang for being crazy, outlandish, having extreme fun, or &#x27;going off&#x27;.

Late in 1976, another fellow East Sydney Tech student, Andrew Smith (Greedy Smith) made guest appearances with the band on harmonica whilst still a member of another band, and by year&#x27;s end Smith had joined full-time and he also played keyboards. Coburn left the fledgling band in 1977 and Mombassa&#x27;s younger brother Peter &quot;Yoga Dog&quot; O&#x27;Doherty joined on bass guitar completing the &quot;classic&quot; line-up. The first performance of the new line-up was at the National Art School&#x27;s Cell Block Theatre on 17 August, the day news broke in Australia of the death of Elvis Presley. They played numerous Elvis covers and two original songs, together with their usual set of Blues, Rockabilly, Country and 1960s covers including Roy Orbison and The Monkees. The band built up a live following in Sydney with their residencies at the Unicorn Hotel in inner-city Paddington on Mondays and the Civic Hotel in the CBD on Thursdays. At the Unicorn Hotel, their stage was on top of the pool table to free up floor space.

The band was spotted by film-makers Cameron Allen and Martin Fabinyi, who founded their own independent record label, Regular Records, in September 1978 to record and release the group&#x27;s music. Fabinyi&#x27;s brother Jeremy Fabinyi became Mental As Anything&#x27;s manager. Their debut release was a three-track EP, &quot;Mental As Anything Plays at Your Party&quot;, in December. It featured all original tracks, and is their only release on which Plaza and Mombassa were credited by their original names, Martin Murphy and Chris O&#x27;Doherty, respectively. Sydney radio station Double Jay (now Triple J), gave airplay to its most popular track, &quot;The Nips Are Getting Bigger&quot;, a drinking song written by Plaza, which showed a stylistic debt to British new wave. Soon after the EP&#x27;s release, the Australian arm of Festival Records took over distribution of Regular Records and released a remix of &quot;The Nips Are Getting Bigger&quot; as a single in July 1979. This was followed on 1 November by the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Get Wet&quot;, with Allen producing. With support from nationwide TV pop show &quot;Countdown&quot;, &quot;The Nips Are Getting Bigger&quot; became the group&#x27;s first Australian Kent Music Report top 20 hit, and also made No. 1 on the UK alternative charts when released there by Virgin Records and remains one of the group&#x27;s most popular songs. &quot;Get Wet&quot; achieved a top 20 position on the Kent Music Report albums chart.

By the time of the LP&#x27;s release in November, all but Peter O&#x27;Doherty had adopted a pseudonym: Chris O&#x27;Doherty became Reg Mombassa; Murphy became Martin Plaza—his name copied from the title of the pedestrian plaza in central Sydney, also known as Martin Place; Smith&#x27;s voracious appetite saw him dubbed &quot;Greedy&quot;; and Twohill became Wayne &quot;Bird&quot; Delisle. (Starting in 1995, Twohill was later billed under his birth name). Shortly before the names had been settled, Peter O&#x27;Doherty was using the pseudonym Ouzo Pork, but he elected to keep his birth name for professional purposes. His nickname, as used in interviews, was Yoga Dog, but he was never billed as such. The band completed their first national tour in late 1979, supporting British rockers Rockpile, with members Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe.

===1980–1984: Success in Australia===
Mental As Anything&#x27;s next two singles—Plaza&#x27;s &quot;Possible Theme for a Future TV Drama Series&quot; (November 1979) and Mombassa&#x27;s &quot;Egypt&quot; (January 1980)—did not reach the top 50. Their second LP, &quot;Espresso Bongo&quot;, released in July, was named after the Cliff Richard movie, and it peaked into the top 40. Their fourth single, &quot;Come Around&quot;, returned them to the top 20 in June, and it was followed by a top 30 hit with &quot;(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet&quot;, an upbeat cover of the 1964 hit by The Reflections, as a non-album single in November 1980.

They scored a No. 4 national hit with Plaza&#x27;s &quot;If You Leave Me Can I Come Too?&quot;, released in May 1981. Smith penned the follow-up, &quot;Too Many Times&quot;, which became a No. 6 hit. It was accompanied by a music video shot on a building block in a Sydney seaside suburb and brought Mental As Anything international exposure by becoming a top 40 hit in Canada in July 1982, when they toured North America in support of Men at Work.

The next single, &quot;Berserk Warriors&quot; (December 1981), was a satirical tribute to ABBA, although the concurrent release of the pop hit &quot;Swords of a Thousand Men&quot; by British band Tenpole Tudor prevented Mental As Anything from realising their plan to make a Viking-themed music video to promote it, although they did eventually make the clip as planned and included it on their subsequent video album compilation. All of the 1981 singles were included on their Bruce Brown and Russell Dunlop produced &quot;Cats &amp; Dogs&quot;, which became their biggest success to date, reaching No. 3 nationally. Mombassa&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Cook&quot; (April 1982) was a radio-only single. &quot;Let&#x27;s Cook&quot; was also an MTV Video. Mental As Anything members were also visual artists and held their first exhibition of their works in May. In June, during his tour of Australia, Elvis Costello heard them and produced their next single &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Mean to Be Mean&quot; (August 1982), written by Plaza.

A compilation album, &quot;If You Leave Me&quot;, was released in September 1982 in the United States and Men at Work, then at the peak of their popularity, had included Mental As Anything as a support act on their US tour. Peter O&#x27;Doherty wrote the band&#x27;s next single, the sentimental &quot;Close Again&quot; (November), from their fourth album, &quot;Creatures of Leisure&quot;, released in April 1983 and produced by Brown and Dunlop, which peaked at No. 8. It provided two more singles, the Smith and Mombassa collaboration &quot;Spirit Got Lost&quot; (March), which was accompanied by an imaginative animated video clip, and Pete O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s &quot;Brain Brain&quot; (September). To promote, &quot;Spirit Got Lost&quot;, Mental As Anything performed the single on &quot;Countdown&quot; with the episode&#x27;s director, Kris Noble, using a dry ice-filled coffin with a band member due to emerge; complaints from within the coffin were ignored by Noble with &quot;It&#x27;s only another 30 seconds&quot;, until a crew member remembered that dry ice could cause nausea, choking or even death.

Their final 1983 single was a cover of Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Working for the Man&quot; (November), produced by Mark Moffatt and Ricky Fataar. Internationally, &quot;Creatures of Leisure&quot; was altered to drop three Australia-only tracks and replace them with both sides of the &quot;Working for the Man&quot; single.

It was another year before their next single, Mombassa and Plaza&#x27;s blackly humorous Christmas release, &quot;Apocalypso (Wiping the Smile off Santa&#x27;s Face)&quot; appeared in December 1984, which was one of the first Australian recordings to be remixed as a 12&quot; &#x27;disco&#x27; version. The innovative stop-motion video by B Sharp Productions to promote &quot;Apocalypso&quot; later shared the &quot;Best Promotional Video&quot; award—with INXS&#x27; &quot;Burn for You&quot; by Richard Lowenstein—at the 1984 &quot;Countdown&quot; Awards held in 1985.

===1985–1989: International success===
Greedy Smith began to gain prominence with his songwriting success and became the lead vocalist on several songs. Plaza&#x27;s deep, sultry vocals contrasted well with Smith&#x27;s higher pitched pop and falsetto. Smith penned and sang the next two singles, both from their &quot;Fundamental&quot; album produced by Richard Gottehrer and released in September 1985, which peaked at No. 3. &quot;You&#x27;re So Strong&quot; (March 1985) reached No. 11 in Australia and also charted in the top 30 of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It was followed by the band&#x27;s biggest Australian hit &quot;Live It Up&quot; (May 1985) which climbed to No. 2 and remained there for three weeks behind Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Angel / Into the Groove&quot;. The single also reached No. 3 in the UK in 1987, and was a hit in Europe, after being included in the soundtrack of the hugely successful Australian 1986 film &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;.

The band performed three songs in the 1985 Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program) – &quot;Live It Up&quot;, &quot;If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too? &quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re So Strong&quot;. It was broadcast both in Australia and on MTV in the US. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Date With Destiny&quot; (September 1985) peaked into the top 30 but Plaza&#x27;s &quot;Big Wheel&quot; (November 1985) did not reach the top 50. In December 1986, they performed under the pseudonym, The Death Barrels, in a competition sponsored by Mambo, Battle of the Surf Bands at Selina&#x27;s Coogee Bay Hotel.

1986 saw the release of &quot;Greatest Hits Volume 1&quot; which reached number 2 on the Australian charts. &quot;Sloppy Croc&quot;, an instrumental that featured on the Crocodile Dundee Soundtrack alongside &quot;Live It Up&quot;, was released as a single in Australia but with little promotion, failed to chart.

From late in 1986 to early 1987, Mental As Anything were the opening act on the multi-group Australian Made concert tour where they were joined by former Dynamic Hepnotics keyboardist Mike Gubb. The tour started with claims of mateship and cooperation; however arguments ensued between various band managers over the proposed concert series film. At the Sydney concert, Peter Trotter, playing trombone for Mental As Anything, collapsed on stage and died a week later. The tour ended in acrimony with two managers, Chris Murphy (for INXS) and Jeremy Fabinyi (for Mental As Anything), arguing backstage in Sydney and coming to blows. A film of the tour, &quot;Australian Made: The Movie&quot;, directed by Richard Lowenstein, was released in July 1987, but contained no footage of Mental As Anything performing. They followed the Australian Made tour by extensive touring of Europe and the UK on the back of the success of &quot;Live It Up&quot; and to promote their album of that year &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot;, again produced by Gottehrer

Mouth to Mouth charted in the top 20 in Australia and the two singles lifted from it, &quot;He&#x27;s Just No Good For You&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Now&quot; both charted in the Top 40, as did a further single at years end, a cover of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;. The music video for &quot;He&#x27;s Just No Good for You&quot; was filmed on Scarborough Street in Monterey, New South Wales.

In late 1988, a cover of the Chuck Berry chestnut &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;—recorded for the Yahoo Serious movie &quot;Young Einstein&quot;—went top 5 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Charts. The single appeared on their next album, &quot;Cyclone Raymond&quot;, produced by Steve James, Mark Moffatt, Mark Opitz and Robyn Smith; which peaked into the top 40 ARIA Albums Charts in October 1989. A planned first single for 1989, &quot;Love Comes Running&quot; was cancelled from release in Australia, instead appearing in New Zealand only. The first single released in 1989 from the album, &quot;The World Seems Difficult&quot; was a top twenty hit, but polished up for the overseas market, sounded unlike anything the band had previously released. Two further singles, &quot;Baby You&#x27;re Wild&quot; and &quot;Overwhelmed&quot; did not peak into the top 50, and promotion of the album was hindered after Smith injured his arm in a horse riding accident, and was hospitalised, which forced tour concerts to be postponed or cancelled. By early 1990, Mental As Anything members agreed to take a sabbatical to work on solo work and side projects. Then Deputy Prime Minister, Paul Keating, opened their second group studio art exhibition in 1990.

===1990–1993: Side projects and sabbatical===

In 1986 Plaza released a solo single, a cover of the 1960s Unit 4 + 2 song &quot;Concrete and Clay&quot;, which was a No. 2 hit; the subsequent solo album, &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;, also charted. In 1991, during his sabbatical from Mental As Anything, Plaza collaborated with former member of Models, James Freud. As Beatfish, they released the self-titled album, &quot;Beatfish&quot;, which was one of the first Australian dance or house flavoured albums. Plaza&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Andy&#x27;s Chest&quot; was composed almost entirely of Lou Reed covers. Another collaboration with Freud occurred in 1996 and resulted in the Hawaiian inspired Moondog project, with Plaza appearing on some tracks of the album &quot;Postcard from Hawaii&quot;.

Mombassa and O&#x27;Doherty formed the duo Reg &amp; Peter/Peter &amp; Reg (they alternated names whenever interviewed) and released a single, &quot;Jean&quot; in March 1991, before adopting the band name Dog Trumpet and releasing the album &quot;Two Heads One Brain&quot;. Studio musicians were Mike Gubb on keyboards (ex-Dynamic Hepnotics, Mental as Anything), John Bliss on drums (ex-The Reels) and Mark Honeybrook on bass guitar. Further releases followed with the EPs &quot;Kiss a Gun Down&quot; in October 1992 and &quot;Strange Brew&quot; in October 1993. After returning to Mental As Anything, they continued with their Dog Trumpet side project and provided three further album releases.

Mombassa also designed innumerable T-shirts, posters, videos and record covers for Mental As Anything and other bands. His most recent album cover is for Public Image Limited&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits So Far&quot;. Johnny Lydon spied Reg&#x27;s work on Mambo clothing and sought him out to do their album cover. Reg&#x27;s talents extend to illustrations and writings for, among others, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Stiletto&quot;, &quot;RAM&quot;, &quot;Dolly&quot; and &quot;FMG&quot;.

Smith performed with his band, Greedy&#x27;s on the Loose, during 1992 but there was no recorded output, while Twohill returned to art college and finished his degree.

===1993–1999: Return from sabbatical===
During the sabbatical, Mental As Anything still played short tours and one-off gigs, but by 1993 they were back on record, providing the song &quot;Ride&quot;, produced by Tim Farriss, for the soundtrack to the Yahoo Serious film &quot;Reckless Kelly&quot;. They released a compilation of rare album tracks and b-sides, &quot;Chemical Travel&quot;, in November.

By mid-1994 the band had recorded an album&#x27;s worth of self-produced material but were having difficulty getting a release deal. They self-released an EP of songs, &quot;Bicycle&quot;, and gave it away on their summer 1994/95 tour of NSW and Queensland. Radio station Triple J received a copy of the &quot;Bicycle&quot; EP on Christmas Day 1994 and put the lead track &quot;Mr Natural&quot; on immediate heavy rotation. Other stations followed and the demand led to the track being given a commercial release as a single and reaching the top 30 on the ARIA Charts (although charting higher in the States where the tour and free EP didn&#x27;t reach). The resulting album, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Liar, Liar Pants on Fire&quot;, reached the top 40, with Mombassa&#x27;s cover taking the &#x27;Best Cover Art&#x27; award at the 1996 ARIA Music Awards.

Three further singles were lifted off &quot;Liar Liar&quot; in 1995 and 1996: Mombassa&#x27;s &quot;Nigel&quot; which just failed to chart, a cover of Wreckless Eric&#x27;s &quot;Whole Wide World&quot; which landed just out of the Top 50 (Top 30 in Victoria) and O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s tribute to Ms Faithful, &quot;Marianne&quot;, which was released as the band supported Chris Isaak on his 1996 tour of Australia.

On 16 August 1997, Mental As Anything celebrated 20 years together with the same line-up with a free birthday show at the Hopetoun Hotel in Surry Hills, Sydney. Late 1997 saw the band put together their third group art exhibition, Mentals III, which was opened by former Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, at the Manly Art Gallery (Paul Keating had opened their second group exhibition in 1990). Their 21st anniversary in 1998 was marked with the release of the last album by this line-up, &quot;Garàge&quot;, which did not reach the top 50, nor did the two singles lifted from it, &quot;Just My Luck&quot; and &quot;Calling Colin&quot;. December 1999 saw the release of &quot;Best of Mental As Anything&quot; which was accredited by ARIA with a gold certificate by 2001, and a seasonal single &quot;White Christmas&quot;, that was given away at their &quot;Yule Party&quot; gig at Sydney&#x27;s Metro Theatre.

===2000–2019: Line-up changes===
In April 2000, Mental As Anything announced the first official change to their line-up since 1977. Brothers Peter O&#x27;Doherty and Reg Mombassa left to pursue their own musical projects, including their band Dog Trumpet, and their art careers. The last tour by this line-up was a short trip to Vietnam organised by the Australian Government. They were replaced by David &#x27;Duck&#x27; Barraclough (ex-The Exponents) and Murray Cook (ex-Leah Purcell, Mixed Relations). Cook (no relation to Murray Cook of The Wiggles) left the band after the &quot;Beetroot Stains&quot; album (2000) and was replaced by New Zealand born Mike Caen, who had worked with Jenny Morris, Margaret Urlich, Rick Price, Daryl Braithwaite and Tina Arena. At the &quot;Gimme Ted&quot; benefit concert on 10 March 2001, Mental As Anything performed three songs. The &quot;Road Case&quot; album by this line-up appeared late in 2002.

In 2003 the band started recording favourite covers that had inspired the band in its early days, including songs such as &quot;Ruby, Don&#x27;t Take Your Love to Town&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Train&quot;, &quot;Hangin Five&quot;, with a view to releasing an album under the title &quot;Songs the Lord Tortoise&quot;. Although the album was completed in 2004 it has not been released.

The next line-up change occurred in September 2004 when Twohill was sacked from the band by Plaza and Smith. Upon return to Sydney following a tour of Western Australia by the band Twohill was told at the airport that he had played his last show for the band. Twohill lodged a wrongful dismissal case against his former bandmates with the NSW Industrial Relations Commission in 2007. At the hearing, he said he had &quot;no inkling&quot; that his bandmates were dissatisfied with his performances and his attitude, whereas Plaza advised that the band had been discussing Twohill&#x27;s future for some time and had issued the drummer with a warning after alleged unprofessional behaviour during a gig at Ettalong, north of Sydney, in December 2003.

This was not an undisputed claim; in evidence given earlier, the band&#x27;s stage technician
Darren Brain, said Twohill &quot;played quite well&quot;. Twohill was ultimately successful in his claim, with Justice Frank Marks stating that the band gave &quot;no basis&quot; for the expulsion.

Twohill was replaced by Robbie Souter, a veteran of Dynamic Hepnotics, Slim Dusty band and other country and roots music combos. This line-up recorded the acoustic &quot;Plucked&quot;, released in November 2005. In 2007 they toured Papua New Guinea for the first time to play three gigs in the capital Port Moresby as part of &quot;Australia Week&quot;.

In May 2009 the band released the compilation album &quot;Essential as Anything&quot;, celebrating thirty years since the release of their first EP and national tour of their debut album. The album also included a DVD of all the video clips released by the band. Additionally Mental As Anything re-issued all ten of the band&#x27;s albums as digital downloads. The band also released a new studio album, &quot;Tents Up&quot;, in June and toured nationally in support of both releases. On 27 August 2009, Mental As Anything was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside Kev Carmody, The Dingoes, Little Pattie and John Paul Young. Mombassa said that it was an honour to be inducted and thanked fans and industry supporters. At the ceremony they were inducted by Roy Slaven and they performed &quot;Live It Up&quot;, &quot;The Nips are Getting Bigger&quot; and &quot;If You Leave Me Can I Come Too&quot; with Mombassa and O&#x27;Doherty rejoining them onstage.

On 18 September 2009 the band appeared live in Sydney&#x27;s Apple Store with a digital download EP in the &quot;iTunes Live from Sydney: Aussie Legends&quot; series appearing the next day. An extensive pictorial biography of Mombassa, titled the &quot;Mind of Times of Reg Mombassa&quot; appeared in November, and by virtue of the subject served as a de facto biography of Mental As Anything up to Mombassa&#x27;s departure in 2000. The Summer of 2009/2010 saw a national tour for the current line-up supporting the B-52s and Proclaimers. In 2010, children&#x27;s entertainers The Wiggles, released their &quot;Let&#x27;s Eat&quot; album with the lead track being a collaboration with Smith, Plaza, Mombassa and O&#x27;Doherty on a re-recording of &quot;Let&#x27;s Cook&quot;.

The band continued to tour regularly, playing smaller venues throughout Australia&#x27;s cities and regional centres. In 2012 both Barraclough and Souter departed the band due to ill health; and were replaced by Zoltan Budai and Jacob Cook, respectively. Souter died in 2017 due to liver failure, aged 68, and Barraclough died in 2018 due to pancreatic cancer, aged 58. Further changes occurred when Caen departed in late 2013 and was replaced by Martin Cilia in early 2014; and when Budai departed the band in 2015 and was replaced by James Gillard.

Martin Plaza has been battling kidney cancer since 2013 and has had extended periods off the road, with Caen and Craig Gordon variously standing in. Plaza played with the Mentals throughout 2014, and for a few dates in October 2016, but his health forced him to thereafter permanently retire from the group&#x27;s touring schedule.

During this time, the band released newly recorded material: Smith&#x27;s &quot;Shake Off Your Sandals&quot; (2015), Plaza&#x27;s &quot;Goat Tracks in My Sandpit&quot; (2016) and a 5 track EP called &quot;5 Track EP&quot; (2017) which collected these two songs and three others. The EP was timed for release for the band&#x27;s appearance on the 2017 APIA Good Times tour. Additionally back catalogue was reissued both physically and digitally in the UK/Europe via Demon/Edsel and in Australia via Universal Music Group.

Mental As Anything, now consisting of Greedy Smith (vocals/keyboards), Martin Cilia (guitars), Jacob Cook (drums), Craig Gordon (vocals/guitars) and Peter Gray (vocals/bass), played a special 40th anniversary show at Surfersaurus in Sydney, during October 2018. Smith was by this point the only original member of Mental As Anything to still be playing with the group. The concert was released as the live CD &quot;At Play&quot; in early 2019.

Andrew &quot;Greedy&quot; Smith died of a heart attack on 2 December 2019, in Sydney. Smith&#x27;s final show with the band – and the band&#x27;s last show to date – took place on 30 November in Tathra, New South Wales.

===2023–present: book and documentary===
In 2023, journalist Stuart Lloyd wrote a book about the band, &quot;Started Out Just Drinking Beer: The Mental As Anything Story&quot;. The book focuses on the five members of the classic line-up, and Mombassa, O&#x27;Doherty and Twohill appeared at the book launch and at other related promotional events. In addition to being sold in both stores and online, copies of the book (autographed by Mombassa, O&#x27;Doherty, Twohill and Lloyd) are available for sale at various Dog Trumpet shows.

In 2024 it was announced a feature length documentary on the band, to be broadcast in 2025, was in development.

From the beginning, Season of Mist focused on releasing more extreme metal records by stylistically diverse bands like Oxiplegatz, Bethzaida and Kampfar. With the signing of Norwegian legends Mayhem in 1999, the label&#x27;s profile clearly shifted towards black metal and attracted internationally renowned artists like Carpathian Forest, Rotting Christ, Arcturus, and Solefald, with the latter two representing a marked progressive and avant-garde side to Season of Mist.

While staying close to its black metal roots with the creation of the Season of Mist Underground Activists division in 2007, the label widened its musical range and added to its black, death, doom (Saint Vitus) and thrash metal roster bands playing progressive death metal (Morbid Angel, Cynic, Atheist, Gnostic, Gonin-ish), sludge (Kylesa, Outlaw Order Black Tusk), industrial metal (Genitorturers, The CNK, Punish Yourself), hard rock (Ace Frehley), gothic rock (Christian Death), mathcore (The Dillinger Escape Plan, Psykup), garage rock (1969 Was Fine), groove metal (Dagoba, Eths, Trepalium, Black Comedy) and metalcore (Eyeless, The Arrs).

==History==
Season of Mist was formed in 1996, while founder Michael S. Berberian was completing his scholarships in &quot;International Economics Sciences&quot; initially, according to Berberian, to avoid the compulsory national military service in France. Since his graduation the label has become a full-time job for Michael and achieved a steady growth with Season of Mist now employing 20 staff members. In 2002 Season of Mist also started out as a distributor for the French territory, which includes other metal labels like Spinefarm Records or Napalm Records on their roster.

Season of Mist&#x27;s name originates from &quot;The Sandman: Season of Mists&quot;, which in turn comes from the opening phrase of John Keats&#x27; &quot;To Autumn&quot;.

<text>Al McDonald is a politician in Ontario, Canada, who was mayor of North Bay, Ontario from 2010 to 2022. He was previously a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2002 to 2003, and ran unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2004 federal election.

==Background==
McDonald was born in Marville, France.

==Politics==
McDonald was politically active on North Bay City Council before entering provincial politics, serving as the deputy mayor of that city for a time. He also served on the North Bay Economic Development Commission, the North Bay Police Services Board, and other local programs.

When former premier Mike Harris resigned as the member for Nipissing in early 2002, McDonald won the Progressive Conservative nomination to replace him. In a by-election held on May 2, 2002, he defeated Liberal candidate George Maroosis, also a city councillor, by 19 votes, as confirmed by a recount. McDonald served as a backbench supporter of new Premier Ernie Eves.

His tenure in office was brief. The Liberals won a majority government in the provincial election of 2003, and McDonald lost his seat to Liberal candidate Monique Smith by about 3,000 votes.

In the federal election of 2004, McDonald ran for the Conservatives in the redistributed riding of Nipissing—Timiskaming, but lost to Liberal Anthony Rota by 2,253 votes.

On August 26, 2010 McDonald announced his intention to run for mayor of North Bay in the 2010 municipal election. He won 87 per cent of the vote on election day over challengers Valerie Chadbourne and Harvey Villneff. He was elected to a second term as mayor in the 2014 municipal election.

<text>The Pepsi Challenge is an ongoing marketing promotion run by PepsiCo since 1975. It is also the name of a cross country ski race at Giant&#x27;s Ridge Ski Area in Biwabik, Minnesota, an event sponsored by Pepsi.

==Method==

The challenge originally took the form of a single blind taste test. At malls, shopping centers, and other public locations, a Pepsi representative sets up a table with two white cups: one containing Pepsi and one with Coca-Cola. Shoppers are encouraged to taste both colas and then select which drink they prefer. Then the representative reveals the two bottles so the taster can see whether they preferred Coke or Pepsi. The results of the test leaned toward a consensus that Pepsi was preferred by more Americans. The Pepsi Challenge has been featured in much of Pepsi&#x27;s TV advertising.

==History==
The challenge launched in 1975, as part of the ongoing Cola wars between Pepsi and The Coca-Cola Company.
In his book &quot;Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking&quot; (2005), author Malcolm Gladwell presents evidence that suggests Pepsi&#x27;s success over Coca-Cola in the &quot;Pepsi Challenge&quot; is a result of the flawed nature of the &quot;sip test&quot; method. His research shows that tasters will generally prefer the sweeter of two beverages based on a single sip, even if they prefer a less sweet beverage over the course of an entire can. Additionally, the challenge more often than not labeled the Pepsi cup with an &quot;M&quot; and the Coca-Cola cup with a &quot;Q,&quot; suggesting letter preference may drive some of the results. Donald M. Kendall of Pepsi promoted the Pepsi Challenge. 

When the preference in blind tests is compared to tests wherein cups are labeled with arbitrary labels (e.g., S or L) or brand names, the ratings of preference change. Scientific findings do support a perceptible difference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi, but not between Pepsi and RC Cola.

In his book &quot;Bad Habits&quot;, humorist Dave Barry describes the Pepsi challenge as, &quot;Pepsi’s ongoing misguided attempt to convince the general public that Coke and Pepsi are not the same thing, which of course they are.&quot;

In 2015, Pepsi relaunched the Pepsi Challenge on social media. As part of this year long promotion, Pepsi signed various celebrity ambassadors to advertise their product on their social media accounts under the hashtag #PepsiChallenge.

In 2025, Pepsi said that they were going to do the Pepsi Challenge starting with New Orleans for Super Bowl LIX. In March they will start a run for the entire country in major cities from Los Angeles, Dallas, and Houston. But instead of Regular Pepsi it&#x27;s Pepsi Zero Sugar and Coca Cola Zero Sugar

==Contest==
In 1981, Pepsi ran a &quot;Pepsi Challenge Payoff&quot; contest that would hand out a large prize to anyone who could gather Pepsi bottle caps that spelled out the word “Challenge&quot;.

<doc id="1264641" wikidata="Q699774" url="?curid=1264641" title="1957 West German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in West Germany on 15 September 1957 to elect the members of the third Bundestag. The Christian Democratic Union and its longtime ally, the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, won a sweeping victory, taking 270 seats in the Bundestag to win the first–and, to date, only–absolute majority for a single German parliamentary group in a free election.

This was the first West German federal election to take place in the Saarland, which–as Saar protectorate–had been a separate entity under French control between 1946 and 1956.

Only four parties won seats in the 1957 election, which was a consolidation of the party system relative to the 1953 and 1949 elections where six and ten parties won seats respectively. As the CDU/CSU won a majority of seats, it formed a government without coalition partners.

==Campaign==
===Economy===
Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer had some solid advantages over his Social Democratic Party (SPD) opponent, Erich Ollenhauer; West Germany had become fully sovereign in 1955 and The Law on Pension Reform (backdated to 1 January 1957) was enormously popular when passed in the spring of 1957, while the economy had been growing on average 7% per year since 1953 in part due to young, skilled and highly educated workers immigrating from East Germany keeping productivity high and earnings growth low. West Germany had joined the European Economic Community in March 1957. Its economy was growing steadily with very low unemployment, and most West Germans felt more prosperous and more secure than in 1949 or 1953.

===Defence===
Although Adenauer had said that he would confine the Bundeswehr to conventional weapons, on 5 April he said &quot;Tactical atomic weapons are nothing but the further development of artillery... it goes without saying that... we cannot dispense with having them for our troops... we must follow suit and have these new types – they are, after all, practically normal weapons.&quot; On 12 April eighteen physicists from the Max Planck Institute released the Göttingen Manifesto calling on West Germany to not produce, test or use nuclear weapons. Adenauer at first tried to brush the matter aside, but under heavy criticism from the press decided instead to meet with five of the physicists in Bonn. After a seven-hour meeting a joint communique was issued saying &quot;The Federal Republic will not produce its own nuclear weapons, and consequently the Federal Government has no reason to approach German nuclear scientists about their participation in the development of nuclear weapons.&quot; The row continued, having been fuelled by an aggressive note from the Soviet Union in April and ended at the NATO Spring conference in May. Ultimately the row was too far away from the election itself to damage a surprisingly healthy looking Adenauer&#x27;s prospects.

==Results==
The All-German Bloc lost all of their seats, but the ideologically similar German Party maintained theirs. The 1957 election was the last time that a right-wing populist party would return members to the Bundestag until Alternative for Germany&#x27;s entrance in 2017. The election also marked the last time until 1990 that any party other than CDU/CSU or SPD won any constituency seats.

=== Results by state ===
==== Constituency seats ====
==== List seats ====
== Aftermath ==
Konrad Adenauer led the CDU-CSU coalition to a landslide victory. The CDU-CSU won an outright majority— the only to date. Since the CDU and the CSU form a single bloc in the Bundestag, this is the only time that a political party in Germany has been elected to a majority government in a free election.

<doc id="1264643" wikidata="Q2975528" url="?curid=1264643" title="Janusz I the Old">
<text>Janusz I of Warsaw (pl: &quot;Janusz I warszawski&quot;), also known as Janusz I the Old (pl: &quot;Janusz I Starszy&quot;) (c. 1347/52 – 8 December 1429), was a Polish prince member of the House of Piast in the Masovian branch, from 1373/74 Duke of Warsaw and after the division of the paternal inheritance between him and his brother in 1381, ruler over Nur, Łomża, Liw, Ciechanów, Wyszogród and Zakroczym. In addition, he was a vassal of the Polish Kingdom since 1391 for the fief of Podlachia (only during his lifetime).

He was the eldest son of Siemowit III, Duke of Masovia and his first wife Euphemia, daughter of Nicholas II of Opava. Due to an error of chronicler Jan Długosz was previously assumed that Janusz I was born c. 1329, and it wasn&#x27;t until modern time that this date could be corrected until a much later one, c. 1346. Evidence of this fact was that only in 1373/74 he received his own duchy (with its capital in Warsaw).

As the result of the partition of Masovia between him and his younger brother Siemowit IV after the death of their father on 16 June 1381, Janusz I finally obtain the totally of his domains: Warsaw, Nur, Łomża, Liw, Ciechanów, Wyszogród and Zakroczym.

==Policy with the Kingdom of Poland==
In this area, Janusz I faithfully maintained a close cooperation with the successive Polish rulers: Louis of Anjou, Jadwiga and Władysław II Jagiełło. One expression of this were the three homages performed by him in the years 1373, 1383 and 1387. In this way, Janusz I was directly opposed to the policy of his brother Siemowit IV, who tried to take advantage of the difficulties in the Angevin dynasty and wanted to obtain the Polish crown for himself. After the death of King Louis of Poland and Hungary, Janusz I recognized the rights of Jadwiga to the Polish crown. To this end, in 1383 he went to Buda, where he offered support forces, in return for which he received a salary of 24,000 florins per year taken from the salt mines of Bochnia. His pro-Angevin policies soon caused that Janusz would be protected from the army of the future Sigismund of Luxemburg, the future Holy Roman Emperor, in his way to rescue his future wife Mary, Queen of Hungary and Jadwiga&#x27;s sister.

==Policy towards Lithuania and seizure of Podlachia==

The preference for the Polish interests in Władysław II Jagiełło in detriment of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania caused a civil war between him and his uncle Kęstutis. Janusz I took advantage of this situation in 1382 to capture the towns of Podlachia and Drohiczyn, claiming them as a part of the dowry of his wife Danutė (a daughter of Kęstutis), with he had married around 1371/73. This acquisition, however, wasn&#x27;t permanent, because later in that year, the Polish King, after finally defeated his uncle, managed to recover this lands. Janusz I, not wanting to further complicated the situation, received with extreme coldness the fugitive Vytautas, despite being his brother-in-law, and after his refusal to accept baptism sent him to the Teutonic Knights.

The relations between Władysław II Jagiełło and Janusz I where repaired only in 1387, when the Duke of Warsaw after the election of Władysław II as King of Poland, formally recognized him recognized and then took part in the royal trip to Vilnius, the first step of the Christianization of Lithuania. His good relations with Władysław II where became even more notorious in 1389 during a visit of Vytautas to Masovia, during which Janusz I, in the middle of a feast, declined a golden cup offered to him by Vytautas, which was considered as an insult. On 2 September 1391 Władysław II Jagiełło formally gave Janusz I the previously disputed lands of Podlachia and Drohiczyn in perpetuity, and with them he also received the towns of Mielnik, Bielsk Podlaski and Suraż (&quot;terram nostram Drohiczensen, Melnyk, Surasz, Byelsko ac omnibus villis in eisdem districtubus&quot;).

==Policy towards the Teutonic Knights==
The friendly relations between Janusz I and Władysław II Jagiełło caused a permanent state of hostility between Masovia from the Teutonic Order. In 1393, and for unknown reasons, Janusz I was captured during a visit to the border castle in Złotoria near Narew by the komturs of Balga and Ragnit and imprisoned at Malbork Castle by orders of the Grand Master, Konrad von Jungingen. Probably with this actions they wanted to provoke the Polish for war with the Order. As a result of the intervention of Władysław II Jagiełło, who sent deputies to the Teutonic Knights, Janusz I was released. In 1404 the Knights again captured Janusz I, this time with his wife and sons, and kept them in Saxony. Again, only the intervention of the Polish King could release them.

In August 1409 the komturs of Ostróda and Pokarmin invaded Janusz&#x27;s domains. In retaliation, Janusz I&#x27;s son Bolesław destroyed Działdowo and 14 surrounding villages.

Between 1409-1411 Janusz I continued his support to Władysław II Jagiełło in the great war against the Teutonic Order and fielded a banner of cavalry to aid the Polish King. In the village of Czerwińsk nad Wisłą, Janusz I designated the place of concentration of the united Polish-Lithuanian army. From there him, at the head his army organized their squadrons of knights and went to Grunwald, where on 15 July 1410 took place the battle. Janusz I then participated in the rest of the campaign. Władysław II, as way to recompensate his fidelity, give to him the Teutonic castles of Nidzica, Ostróda and Olsztyn. However, this acquisitions weren&#x27;t permanent, because seven months later (1 February 1411) after the sign of the Peace of Thorn, he was forced to return the castles to the Teutonic Order.

When in 1414 another war broke out with the Teutonic Knights (the called &quot;Hunger War&quot;), Janusz I again decided to support the King. This time, however, probably because of his advanced age, he didn&#x27;t participated directly in the campaign but send his son Bolesław.

==Internal policy and reforms==
In domestic politics, Janusz I took a thorough reform of the economic policies of the principality given the German Kulm law to 24 cities including Czersk (1383), Ciechanów (1400), Różan (1403), Warsaw New Town (1408), Drohiczyn (1408), Łomża (1418), Grójec (1419), Maków Mazowiecki and Mińsk Mazowiecki (1421), Kolno and Tykocin (1425), Przasnysz and Ostrołęka (1427) and Kamieńczyk (1428). An extremely important step took place in 1406, when he moved his capital from Czersk to newly developing strategic town of Warsaw and actively worked to develop his towns, fortified his castles and strongholds. A clear sign of this develop was the creation of a Collegiate at St. John Church and the build of a castle (who was later known as the oldest part of the future Royal Palace). Among the most notorious castles fortified during this time are the former capital Czersk, Liw and Ciechanów.

==Marriage and issue==
Around 23 November 1371/73, Janusz I married the Lithuanian princess Danutė (c. 1358 - c. 24 November 1424) -who in baptism took the name &quot;Ana&quot;-, a daughter of Kęstutis and sister of Vytautas, both Dukes of Trakai and Grand Dukes of Lithuania; in consequence, she was a first-cousin of the later King Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland (born Jogaila, son of Algirdas, a brother of Kęstutis). The union produced at least four children:
* Daughter (Olga?) (1373/76 - c. 8 December 1401), who married firstly in 1388 to Voivode Petru I of Moldavia and secondly with the Moldavian magnate Wilczę.
* Janusz (1376/81 - c. 18 October 1422).
* Bolesław (1385/86 - c. 4 May 1424).
* Konrad (c. 1400 - 9 December 1412/13).

Janusz I survived all his children and passed, by testament, his domains to his eldest surviving grandson, Bolesław IV (son of the second son, Bolesław).

He died on 8 December 1429 at Czersk, and was buried at St. John&#x27;s Archcathedral, Warsaw.

<text>A nightshirt is a garment intended for wear while sleeping, often with a nightcap. It is longer than most regular shirts, reaching down below the knees, leaving some of the legs uncovered. It is often referred to as a nightgown for men, but nowadays, nightshirts are an optional sleepwear for women too.

In the US, it also sometimes means a shirt, slightly longer than a regular shirt, reaching down to the thighs, worn as loungewear and nightwear. Traditional nightshirts are used just for nightwear, removed and stored away for next use upon waking. This other, non-traditional type is worn with pajama bottoms.

Until the 16th century men slept naked or in a day-shirt . Nobles in the 16th century then wore embroidered shirts or &quot;wrought night-shirts&quot;. By the 19th century the nightshirt resembled a day-shirt with a loose, turned-down collar and similar length to a nightgown. Historically, nightshirts were often made of ruined or very cheap fabric, but most are now made of normal cloth.

Like nightgowns, it is recommended to wear a robe or a dressing gown over them when expecting guests.

<doc id="1264652" wikidata="Q798904" url="?curid=1264652" title="Bathrobe">
<text>A bathrobe, also known as a housecoat or a dressing gown, is a loose-fitting outer garment (a robe) worn by people, often after washing the body or around a pool. A bathrobe is considered to be very informal clothing, and is not worn with everyday clothes.

A bathrobe is a dressing gown made from towelling or other absorbent fabric and may be donned while the wearer&#x27;s body is wet, serving both as a towel and a body covering when there is no immediate need to fully dress.

==Fabrics and fibre types ==
===Fabrics===
Bathrobes can be categorized by the weave of their fabric:

*Flannel: Flannel is a soft woven fabric, made from loosely spun yarn, usually cotton or wool.
*Terrycloth: Terrycloth is a pile fabric, usually woven of cotton, with uncut loops on both sides, used for bath towels and robes. The longer and denser the loops are, the more absorbent the bathrobes are.
*Velour: Velour is a pile fabric where the loops woven into the fabric have been cut. Velour bathrobes are typically made with a terrycloth lining, as terrycloth absorbs water better than velour. Velour can make a bathrobe appear more luxurious, cosier, and makes the garment soft to the touch.
*Waffle fabric: Waffle fabric has good water absorbency, with a lightweight weave and a distinctive &quot;gridlike&quot; appearance. These bathrobes are designed for their light weight over their absorbency.

Bathrobes and bathrobe fabrics can also be categorised for their fibre types, and are generally made of four different fibres:

*Cotton: Cotton is a natural fibre consisting primarily of cellulose and is one of the most commonly used fibres in textile manufacturing. Due to the hydrophilic nature of cellulose, cotton absorbs water easily and is frequently used by the beach, pool, or following a shower. Cotton robes are especially suited to use in hot climates because cotton tends to absorb perspiration. 
*Silk: Silk dressing gowns are popular because of their look and feel, but can be relatively expensive. Silk robes are very thin and lightweight, and are not particularly suited to wet situations because they lack the surface area and polarity necessary to absorb water. However, silk dressing gowns are the traditional choice, since they are not worn after bathing.
*Microfiber: Microfiber is an extremely fine synthetic fiber, typically made of cellulose or polyester, that can be woven into textiles to mimic natural-fiber cloth. Modern microfibers are developed to maximize breathability and water absorption and can be thinner than the width of human hair. Much like silk, robes made out of microfiber are light in weight and are very soft to the touch. Microfiber is flammable.
*Wool: Wool bathrobes are common in colder climates.
*Nylon: Nylon is a synthetic fibre occasionally used in inexpensive dressing gowns. It is valued for its ability to be cleaned easily.

==Design and construction==

Most bathrobes are designed as a wrapped-front garment with belt loops and a matching belt, intended to be tied around the waist to hold the garment closed.

However, bathrobe designs vary, typically in collar and closure design, with some garments featuring an open front or fastened closures in place of a belt. Varieties of collar design include:

*Shawl collar: So-called because the collar closes around the neck like a shawl. The shawl collar is borrowed from its use on men&#x27;s evening wear on the dinner jacket and smoking jacket, and is common on traditional dressing gowns.
*Kimono collar: Similar to the collar found on the kimono, a traditional Japanese garment, the collar forms a thin strip of consistent width, wrapping around the front in a Y-shaped manner.
*Hooded: A hood is sewn into the neckline, which can be worn over the head to keep it warm and help to dry wet hair.

<doc id="1264660" wikidata="Q5430696" url="?curid=1264660" title="Fairport's Cropredy Convention">
<text>Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention (formerly Cropredy Festival) is an annual festival of folk and rock music, headed by British folk-rock band Fairport Convention and held on the edge of the village of Cropredy in Oxfordshire, England. The festival has taken place in August annually since 1976.

Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention attracts up to 20,000 people each year. The festival features a single stage at the lower end of the sloping arena field. There are also ancillary events, such as Morris dancing in the streets and live music at the village&#x27;s two pubs.

==History==

The festival began as a private performance to about 750 people by the British folk rock band Fairport Convention in a village back garden in July 1976. The next year the performance was repeated and opened up to the public. In 1978 it was properly organised and moved to a larger site behind the Cropredy village school. It became a significant event in the band&#x27;s history as they played their farewell performance there on 4 August 1979 to around 4,500 people, who were cheered by a promise to continue with annual reunions. From this point the festival became the main mechanism for preserving the identity of the band and for their many fans to show their appreciation.

At the first reunion in 1980 the festival was expanded from a one to a two-day event with increasing numbers of guest acts. In 1981, lacking a suitable site at Cropredy, it was shifted to the grounds of Broughton Castle, a performance released as &quot;Moat on the Ledge – Live at Broughton Castle&quot; (1982).

The festival returned to Cropredy the next year (and has remained there ever since although the actual site has expanded over the years). Despite the fact that Fairport Convention was not active as a band from 1980 to 1985, the festival continued to grow. After the band reformed in 1985, the festival became Fairport&#x27;s major platform for showcasing new material as well as revisiting the old.

Between 1981 and 1999, the festival was a two-day event. From 2000, it was expanded to three days—Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The festival takes place on the second full weekend in August. Originally known as just &quot;the Cropredy reunion&quot;, the event was branded Cropredy Festival until 2005 when it was retitled Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention. In 2007, all available tickets were sold in advance for the first time (this would not happen again until 2014).

In 2008, a live on-stage video screen was introduced. The year was also notable because, for the first time, not a single theft from the campsites was reported to festival control over the whole three days, underlining the unique and friendly atmosphere for which the festival is famous.

In 2010, highlights of the festival were televised on Sky Arts for the first time, with a documentary presented by radio DJ and television presenter Bob Harris. This continued through to 2012. In 2013 and 2014 the Whispering Bob Broadcasting Company uploaded highlights of the festival on their YouTube channel. From 2015 onwards, highlights from Fairport Convention&#x27;s Saturday night set have been uploaded on their official YouTube channel. In 2020 the festival did not take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic and so a broadcast of Richard Thompson and Fairport Convention&#x27;s full sets from the 2019 festival was streamed on the official YouTube channel.

To celebrate forty years of the festival, a documentary called &quot;Summer by The Cherwell&quot; was released in 2020.

===Outline of the festival===
The event is organised largely by Gareth Williams, the Festival Director, and also Simon Nicol and Dave Pegg, both members of Fairport. Fairport themselves open the festival on the Thursday evening with an acoustic set, and close the festival on the Saturday night.

The majority of attendees camp for the duration of the festival. There are eight separate camping fields adjacent to the arena, one of which is reserved for family parties. Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention is aimed at all ages with an emphasis on families and has developed a reputation as a particularly friendly and safe festival.

As well as a wide range of live music, the event features three dozen stalls selling clothing, books, CDs and food. It also boasts a very large bar which specialises in cask ale which was formerly provided by Wadworth, a brewery based in Devizes, Wiltshire until 2020. Hook Norton Brewery took over the bar for the 2021 festival, serving their real ales, real cider, wines and spirit. 

The bar is used by festival-goers and performers alike (there is no back-stage bar), making Cropredy one of the few major festivals where the public can mingle with the musicians playing there.

In recent years, the running times for live music have been 4 p.m. until 11 p.m. on the Thursday and noon until midnight on the Friday and Saturday.

Also recently, there has been a wider spread of genres of music, expanding out from the original folk roots of the festival. Status Quo, the Buzzcocks, Dreadzone and Supergrass have played at Cropredy in recent years. Among many well-known acts appearing in recent years are Robert Plant, Alice Cooper, Lonnie Donegan, Procol Harum, Steeleye Span, Eliza Carthy, Yusuf Islam and Oysterband (see below for others).

===The pre-Cropredy &quot;warm-ups&quot;===
On the Monday and Tuesday before the festival each year, fans get a foretaste of what is to come at the festival when Fairport Convention stage &quot;warm-up&quot; concerts at a local club venue. Until 2007 these concerts were held at the Mill Arts Centre in Banbury. From 2007 until 2010 the concerts were held at Woodford Halse Social Club (Woodford Halse is a village in Northamptonshire approximately nine miles northeast of Cropredy) but returned to The Mill in 2011.

In 2017 the warm-ups moved from The Mill to Banbury Trades And Labour Club, following in the footsteps of P J Wright (fellow band-member with Dave Pegg in the Dylan Project) who had moved his annual TRADarrr pre-Cropredy Wednesday gig to the same venue in 2016.

&quot;These performers are generally listed with the headline act last.&quot;

=== 2023 ===
On 12 December 2022 it was announced that the festival would be happening on 10, 11 and 12 August 2023 with headliners 10cc on the Friday and other sets by Toyah &amp; Robert Fripp, Kiki Dee &amp; Carmelo Luggeri, Gilbert O’Sullivan and the UK farewell performance from Strawbs.

<text>Daisy Miller, A Study is a novella by Henry James that first appeared in &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot; in June–July 1878, and in book form the following year. It portrays the courtship of the beautiful American girl Daisy Miller by Winterbourne, a sophisticated of hers. His pursuit of her is hampered by her own flirtatiousness, which is frowned upon by the other expatriates when they meet in Switzerland and Italy.

==Plot summary==
Annie &quot;Daisy&quot; Miller and Frederick Winterbourne first meet in Vevey, Switzerland, in a garden of the grand hotel, where Winterbourne is allegedly vacationing from his studies (an attachment to an older lady is rumoured). They are introduced by Randolph Miller, Daisy&#x27;s nine-year-old brother. Randolph considers their hometown of Schenectady, New York, to be absolutely superior to all of Europe. However, Daisy is absolutely delighted with the continent, especially the high society she wishes to enter.

Winterbourne is at first confused by her attitude, and though greatly impressed by her beauty, he soon determines that she is nothing more than a young flirt. He continues his pursuit of Daisy in spite of the disapproval of his aunt, Mrs. Costello, who spurns any family with so close a relationship to their courier as the Millers have with their Eugenio. She also thinks Daisy is a shameless girl for agreeing to visit the Château de Chillon with Winterbourne after they have known each other for only half an hour. Two days later, the two travel to Château de Chillon, and although Winterbourne had paid the janitor for privacy, Daisy is not quite impressed. Winterbourne then informs Daisy that he must go to Geneva the next day. Daisy feels disappointment and chaffs him, eventually asking him to visit her in Rome later that year.

In Rome, Winterbourne and Daisy meet unexpectedly in the parlor of Mrs. Walker, an American expatriate, whose moral values have adapted to those of Italian society. Rumors about Daisy meeting with young Italian gentlemen make her socially exceptionable under these criteria. Winterbourne learns of Daisy&#x27;s increasing intimacy with a young Italian of questionable society, Giovanelli, as well as the growing scandal caused by the pair&#x27;s behaviour. Daisy is undeterred by the open disapproval of the other Americans in Rome, and her mother seems quite unaware of the underlying tensions. Winterbourne and Mrs. Walker attempt to persuade Daisy to separate from Giovanelli, but she refuses.

One night, Winterbourne takes a walk through the Colosseum and sees a young couple sitting at its centre. He realises that they are Giovanelli and Daisy. Infuriated with Giovanelli, Winterbourne asks him how he could dare to take Daisy to a place where she runs the risk of catching &quot;Roman fever&quot; (malaria). Daisy says she does not care and Winterbourne leaves them. Daisy falls ill and dies a few days later.

== List of characters ==
*Annie P. Miller (Daisy) - A beautiful young American girl. Despite her exact age not being informed, the common sense tells she is about 18 years old.
*Frederick Winterbourne - 27- year-old American expatriate and gentleman raised in Europe. Lives in Geneva.
*Mrs Costello - Frederick&#x27;s aunt, a reserved &quot;widow with a fortune&quot;. 
*Randolph C. Miller - Daisy&#x27;s 9-year-old electric brother, responsible for introducing her to Frederick.
*Mrs Miller - Daisy and Randolph&#x27;s mother.
*Eugenio - Miller&#x27;s courier.
* Mrs Walker - An American lady living in Rome since long. Friend of Daisy and Frederick.
*Giovanelli - Daisy&#x27;s intimate friend in Rome.
* Ezra B. Miller - The rich husband of Mrs Miller, father of Daisy and Randolph. Mentioned by the latter in the first chapter, he does not appear in the story.
*The 3 sons of Mrs Costello - In chapter 2, the omniscient narrator lets us know that Mrs Costello has 3 sons, two living in America, one in Germany. None of them appear in the story and remain unnamed.
*A friend in the street - In chapter 4, Frederick meets a friend at Via del Corso. This unnamed friend tells him that he had just seen Miss Daisy Miller with a companion at the Palazzo Doria, a famous museum nearby. In hearing this, Frederick heads immediately to see Mrs Miller, who apologies for receiving him in Daisy&#x27;s absence.
*Dr Davis - Mrs Miller&#x27;s physician in America (only mentioned).
*Mrs Sanders and Mrs Featherstone - Teachers, considered to support Randolph during the Millers&#x27; long term travel through Europe (only mentioned).

==Key themes==
This novella serves as both a psychological description of the mind of a young woman and as an analysis of the traditional views of a society where she is a clear outsider. Henry James uses Daisy&#x27;s story to discuss what he thinks Europeans and Americans believe about each other and more generally the prejudices common in any culture. In a letter, James said that Daisy is the victim of a &quot;social rumpus&quot; that goes on either over her head or beneath her notice.

The names of the characters are also symbolic. Daisy is a flower in full bloom, without inhibitions and in the springtime of her life. Daisy contrasts sharply with Winterbourne. Flowers die in winter and this is precisely what happens to Daisy after catching &quot;Roman fever&quot;. As an objective analogue to this psychological reality, Daisy catches the very real Roman fever, the malaria that was endemic to many Roman neighbourhoods in the 19th century.

The issue on which the novella turns is the &quot;innocence&quot; of Daisy, despite her seemingly scandalous behavior.

John Burnside, writing for &quot;The Independent&quot;, said,

Daisy Miller arrives in Frederick Winterbourne&#x27;s staid world the way that an angel arrives at an Annunciation, as both promise and challenge. From their first meeting at Vevey, to the story&#x27;s dramatic conclusion in Rome, Winterbourne&#x27;s interest in Daisy is subject to constant censure from his carefully &quot;exclusive&quot; aunt, Mrs Costello, and her forensically respectable social circle: the girl is &quot;not nice&quot;, they say; she is overly familiar with her family&#x27;s courier, she has been observed in inappropriate situations with dubious young &quot;gentlemen&quot; and Winterbourne would clearly do well to distance himself, before the inevitable scandal unfolds.

At first sight, it seems that Winterbourne is genuinely torn between romantic attachment and his suffocating social milieu – and that might have made for an engaging, but not uncommon study of love versus convention; however, James&#x27; keen observation reveals something deeper than that, for even as he protests his aunt&#x27;s attacks on Daisy&#x27;s character (yes, she is uncultivated, he admits, but she is not the reprobate for which the entire world has decided to mistake her), he is less disappointed than relieved when a nocturnal encounter with the girl and her suitor, Giovanelli, appears to prove Mrs Costello right: &quot;Winterbourne stopped, with a sort of horror; and, it must be added, with a sort of relief. It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of Daisy&#x27;s behaviour and the riddle had become easy to read. She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect.&quot; Though the novella&#x27;s final act has yet to unfold, we cannot help but conclude that the real tragedy lies here, in Winterbourne&#x27;s relief.

==Critical evaluation==
&quot;Daisy Miller&quot; was an immediate and widespread popular success for James, despite some criticism that the story was &quot;an outrage on American girlhood&quot;. The story continues to be one of James&#x27; most popular works, along with &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; and &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;. Critics have generally praised the freshness and vigor of the storytelling.

In 1909, James revised &quot;Daisy Miller&quot; extensively for the &quot;New York Edition&quot;. He altered the tone of the story, and many modern editions (Penguin; Broadview) prefer to print the original edition, their editors believing that the later edition is a diminution of the original, rather than an improvement.

==Derivative works==
James converted his story into a play that failed to be produced. He published the play in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1883, and it showed many changes from the original story. In particular, a happy ending was inserted to please what James believed to be the preferences of theatre-goers.

In the 1890s, a short walking-skirt called the rainy daisy, supposedly named for Daisy Miller, was introduced.

A 1974 film adaptation was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, with Cybill Shepherd as Daisy, Barry Brown as Frederick Winterbourne, Cloris Leachman as Mrs. Ezra Miller, Duilio Del Prete as Mr. Giovanelli, and Eileen Brennan as Mrs. Walker. Frederic Raphael wrote the script; the film follows the structure of the original story without significant changes, and even uses portions of James&#x27; dialogue from the novella.

The novella was adapted in 2017 as a five-part radio drama on BBC Radio 4 for its &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot;″s &quot;Love Henry James&quot; series.

<text>Warning Forever is a freeware fixed shooter for Microsoft Windows written by Japanese developer Hikoza T Ohkubo and released under the name of his software house, Hikware.

==Gameplay==
The game is broken into stages; each stage is a single boss battle, resulting in a constant stream of bosses. To progress to the next stage, the boss must be completely destroyed within the time limit. The game starts with a default time limit of 180 seconds, with 30 seconds rewarded for every boss defeated and 20 seconds lost for each time the player is destroyed.

The player flies a small green ship. There are no power-ups - the player&#x27;s only weapon is a very rapid-fire revolving cannon which is fired by holding down the shoot button (Z key by default). By default, it fires straight ahead with a small spread. Alternatively, after the switch button (D key by default) is pressed, a green arc is displayed originating from the ship and widening as distance increases. This arc represents the spread of the weapon fire and does not change while the weapon is firing. It can, however, be modified based on the ship&#x27;s motion while not firing. The arc will rotate slowly to face the direction opposite the ship&#x27;s motion. Also, the arc will widen as the player moves toward the enemy and vice versa.

The main gameplay feature is the bosses change from stage to stage. Based on how a boss is destroyed, the next boss will adapt itself to defend against previously used strategies and force the player to change tactics. For example, if the front section of one boss is destroyed the next boss will have increased armor in that area. If the player&#x27;s ship is hit by a certain kind of weapon, but still defeats the boss, the next boss is likely to have more weapons of that type.

The game does not include music, but provides instructions in the read me file on how to provide one&#x27;s own music. It also includes sound effects.

==Reception==
Download.com awarded the game a 5-star editor&#x27;s rating and described the game as a classic in the making, &quot;Warning Forever will entice nearly every gamer who enjoys a space shootout&quot;. The staff of Computer Gaming World, writing for gaming blog 1up.com said &quot;This game is among the most addictive platform shooters in the business&quot;.
Eurogamer&#x27;s Jim Rossignol named &quot;Warning Forever&quot; among a top 20 list of &quot;Summer of PC&quot; Freeware games in 2006. Other reviews are from IGN and Rock, Paper, Shotgun. This game is part of the permanent collection of the travelling exhibition Game On 2.0, shown for instance in the Ontario Science Centre 2013, as example in the category Indie games.

<text>Malignant transformation is the process by which cells acquire the properties of cancer. This may occur as a primary process in normal tissue, or secondarily as &quot;malignant degeneration&quot; of a previously existing benign tumor.

==Causes==

There are many causes of primary malignant transformation, or tumorigenesis. Most human cancers in the United States are caused by external factors, and these factors are largely avoidable. These factors were summarized by Doll and Peto in 1981, and were still considered to be valid in 2015. These factors are listed in the table.
a Reproductive and sexual behaviors include: number of partners; age at first menstruation; zero versus one or more live births

==Examples of diet-related malignant transformation==

===Diet and colon cancer===

Colon cancer provides one example of the mechanisms by which diet, the top factor listed in the table, is an external factor in cancer. The Western diet of African Americans in the United States is associated with a yearly colon cancer rate of 65 per 100,000 individuals, while the high fiber/low fat diet of rural Native Africans in South Africa is associated with a yearly colon cancer rate of &lt;5 per 100,000. Feeding the Western diet for two weeks to Native Africans increased their secondary bile acids, including carcinogenic deoxycholic acid, by 400%, and also changed the colonic microbiota. Evidence reviewed by Sun and Kato indicates that differences in human colonic microbiota play an important role in the progression of colon cancer.

===Diet and lung cancer===

A second example, relating a dietary component to a cancer, is illustrated by lung cancer. Two large population-based studies were performed, one in Italy and one in the United States. In Italy, the study population consisted of two cohorts: the first, 1721 individuals diagnosed with lung cancer and no severe disease, and the second, 1918 control individuals with absence of lung cancer history or any advanced diseases. All individuals filled out a food frequency questionnaire including consumption of walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, and peanuts, and indicating smoking status. In the United States, 495,785 members of AARP were questioned on consumption of peanuts, walnuts, seeds, or other nuts in addition to other foods and smoking status. In this U.S. study 18,533 incident lung cancer cases were identified during up to 16 years of follow-up. Overall, individuals in the highest quintile of frequency of nut consumption had a 26% lower risk of lung cancer in the Italian study and a 14% lower risk of lung cancer in the U.S. study. Similar results were obtained among individuals who were smokers.

==Due to tobacco==

The most important chemical compounds in smoked tobacco that are carcinogenic are those that produce DNA damage since such damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. Cunningham et al. combined the microgram weight of the compound in the smoke of one cigarette with the known genotoxic effect per microgram to identify the most carcinogenic compounds in cigarette smoke. These compounds and their genotoxic effects are listed in the article Cigarette. The top three compounds are acrolein, formaldehyde and acrylonitrile, all known carcinogens.

==Due to infection==

===Viruses===

In 2002 the World Health Organizations International Agency for Research on Cancer estimated that 11.9% of human cancers are caused by one of seven viruses (see Oncovirus overview table). These are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or HHV4); Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8); Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV); Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1); Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV); and a group of alpha Human papillomaviruses (HPVs).

===Bacteria===

==== &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; and gastric cancer====

In 1995 epidemiologic evidence indicated that &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection increases the risk for gastric carcinoma. More recently, experimental evidence showed that infection with &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; cagA-positive bacterial strains results in severe degrees of inflammation and oxidative DNA damage, leading to progression to gastric cancer.

====Other bacterial roles in carcinogenesis====

Perera et al. referred to a number of articles pointing to roles of bacteria in other cancers. They pointed to single studies on the role of &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; in cervical cancer, &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot; in gallbladder cancer, and both &quot;Bacteroides fragilis&quot; and &quot;Fusobacterium nucleatum&quot; in colon cancer. Meurman has recently summarized evidence connecting oral microbiota with carcinogenesis. Although suggestive, these studies need further confirmation.

==Common underlying factors in cancer==

===Mutations===

One underlying commonality in cancers is genetic mutation, acquired either by inheritance, or, more commonly, by mutations in one&#x27;s somatic DNA over time. The mutations considered important in cancers are those that alter protein coding genes (the exome). As Vogelstein et al. point out, a typical tumor contains two to eight exome &quot;driver gene&quot; mutations, and a larger number of exome mutations that are &quot;passengers&quot; that confer no selective growth advantage.

Cancers also generally have genome instability, that includes a high frequency of mutations in the noncoding DNA that makes up about 98% of the human genome. The average number of DNA sequence mutations in the entire genome of breast cancer tissue is about 20,000. In an average melanoma (where melanomas have a higher exome mutation frequency) the total number of DNA sequence mutations is about 80,000.

===Epigenetic alterations===

====Transcription silencing====

A second underlying commonality in cancers is altered epigenetic regulation of transcription. In cancers, loss of gene expression occurs about 10 times more frequently by epigenetic transcription silencing (caused, for example, by promoter hypermethylation of CpG islands) than by mutations. As Vogelstein et al. point out, in a colorectal cancer there are usually about 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker, or passenger, mutations. In contrast, the frequency of epigenetic alterations is much higher. In colon tumors compared to adjacent normal-appearing colonic mucosa, there are about 600 to 800 heavily methylated CpG islands in promoters of genes in the tumors while the corresponding CpG islands are not methylated in the adjacent mucosa. Such methylation turns off expression of a gene as completely as a mutation would. Around 60–70% of human genes have a CpG island in their promoter region. In colon cancers, in addition to hypermethylated genes, several hundred other genes have hypomethylated (under-methylated) promoters, thereby causing these genes to be turned on when they ordinarily would be turned off.

====Post-transcriptional silencing====

Epigenetic alterations are also carried out by another major regulatory element, that of microRNAs (miRNAs). In mammals, these small non-coding RNA molecules regulate about 60% of the transcriptional activity of protein-encoding genes. Epigenetic silencing or epigenetic over-expression of miRNA genes, caused by aberrant DNA methylation of the promoter regions controlling their expression, is a frequent event in cancer cells. Almost one third of miRNA promoters active in normal mammary cells were found to be hypermethylated in breast cancer cells, and that is a several fold greater proportion of promoters with altered methylation than is usually observed for protein coding genes. Other microRNA promoters are hypomethylated in breast cancers, and, as a result, these microRNAs are over-expressed. Several of these over-expressed microRNAs have a major influence in progression to breast cancer. BRCA1 is normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissue, where it helps repair damaged DNA, or destroy cells if DNA cannot be repaired. BRCA1 is involved in the repair of chromosomal damage with an important role in the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks. BRCA1 expression is reduced or undetectable in the majority of high grade, ductal breast cancers. Only about 3–8% of all women with breast cancer carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. &quot;BRCA1&quot; promoter hypermethylation was present in only 13% of unselected primary breast carcinomas. However, breast cancers were found to have an average of about 100-fold increase in miR-182, compared to normal breast tissue. In breast cancer cell lines, there is an inverse correlation of BRCA1 protein levels with miR-182 expression. Thus it appears that much of the reduction or absence of BRCA1 in high grade ductal breast cancers may be due to over-expressed miR-182. In addition to miR-182, a pair of almost identical microRNAs, miR-146a and miR-146b-5p, also repress BRCA1 expression. These two microRNAs are over-expressed in triple-negative tumors and their over-expression results in BRCA1 inactivation. Thus, miR-146a and/or miR-146b-5p may also contribute to reduced expression of BRCA1 in these triple-negative breast cancers.

Post-transcriptional regulation by microRNA occurs either through translational silencing of the target mRNA or through degradation of the target mRNA, via complementary binding, mostly to specific sequences in the three prime untranslated region of the target gene&#x27;s mRNA. The mechanism of translational silencing or degradation of target mRNA is implemented through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).

==DNA repair gene silencing==
Silencing of a DNA repair gene by hypermethylation or other epigenetic alteration appears to be a frequent step in progression to cancer. As summarized in a review, promoter hypermethylation of DNA repair gene &quot;MGMT&quot; occurs in 93% of bladder cancers, 88% of stomach cancers, 74% of thyroid cancers, 40%-90% of colorectal cancers and 50% of brain cancers. In addition, promoter hypermethylation of DNA repair genes &quot;LIG4&quot;, &quot;NEIL1&quot;, &quot;ATM&quot;, &quot;MLH1&quot; or &quot;FANCB&quot; occurs at frequencies of between 33% and 82% in one or more of head and neck cancers, non-small-cell lung cancers or non-small-cell lung cancer squamous cell carcinomas. Further, the article Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase indicates the DNA repair gene &quot;WRN&quot; has a promoter that is often hypermethylated in a variety of cancers, with &quot;WRN&quot; hypermethylation occurring in 11% to 38% of colorectal, head and neck, stomach, prostate, breast, thyroid, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma cancers.

Such silencing likely acts similarly to a germ-line mutation in a DNA repair gene, and predisposes the cell and its descendants to progression to cancer. Another review points out that when a gene necessary for DNA repair is epigenetically silenced, DNA repair would tend to be deficient and DNA damages can accumulate. Increased DNA damage can cause increased errors during DNA synthesis, leading to mutations that give rise to cancer.

==Induced by heavy metals==

The heavy metals cadmium, arsenic and nickel are all carcinogenic when present above certain levels.

Cadmium is known to be carcinogenic, possibly due to reduction of DNA repair. Lei et al. evaluated five DNA repair genes in rats after exposure of the rats to low levels of cadmium. They found that cadmium caused repression of three of the DNA repair genes: XRCC1 needed for base excision repair, OGG1 needed for base excision repair, and ERCC1 needed for nucleotide excision repair. Repression of these genes was not due to methylation of their promoters.

Arsenic carcinogenicity was reviewed by Bhattacharjee et al. They summarized the role of arsenic and its metabolites in generating oxidative stress, resulting in DNA damage. In addition to causing DNA damage, arsenic also causes repression of several DNA repair enzymes in both the base excision repair pathway and the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Bhattacharjee et al. further reviewed the role of arsenic in causing telomere dysfunction, mitotic arrest, defective apoptosis, as well as altered promoter methylation and miRNA expression. Each of these alterations could contribute to arsenic-induced carcinogenesis.

Nickel compounds are carcinogenic and occupational exposure to nickel is associated with an increased risk of lung and nasal cancers. Nickel compounds exhibit weak mutagenic activity, but they considerably alter the transcriptional landscape of the DNA of exposed individuals. Arita et al. examined the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of eight nickel-refinery workers and ten non-exposed workers. They found 2756 differentially expressed genes with 770 up-regulated genes and 1986 down-regulated genes. DNA repair genes were significantly over-represented among the differentially expressed genes, with 29 DNA repair genes repressed in the nickel-refinery workers and two over-expressed. The alterations in gene expression appear to be due to epigenetic alterations of histones, methylations of gene promoters, and hypermethylation of at least microRNA miR-152.

==Clinical signs==

Malignant transformation of cells in a benign tumor may be detected by pathologic examination of tissues. Often the clinical signs and symptoms are suggestive of a malignant tumor. The physician, during the medical history examination, can find that there have been changes in size or patient sensation and, upon direct examination, that there has been a change in the lesion itself.

Risk assessments can be done and are known for certain types of benign tumor which are known to undergo malignant transformation. One of the better-known examples of this phenomenon is the progression of a nevus to melanoma.

<text>The Blue Sky with a White Sun () is the national emblem of the Republic of China, both during its history in mainland China and on Taiwan.

In the &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; symbol, the twelve rays of the white Sun representing the twelve months and the twelve traditional Chinese hours (), each of which corresponds to two modern hours and symbolizes the spirit of progress.

==Official description==
The national emblem of the Republic of China is officially described in the &quot;National Emblem and National Flag of the Republic of China Act&quot;:

==History of the Blue Sky White Sun design==
The &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; flag was originally designed by Lu Hao-tung, a martyr of the Republican revolution. He presented his design to represent the revolutionary army at the inauguration of the Society for Regenerating China, an anti-Qing society in Hong Kong, on February 21, 1895.

During the Wuchang Uprising in 1911 that heralded the Republic of China, the various revolutionary armies had different flags. Lu Hao-tung&#x27;s &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; flag was used in the southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, while the &quot;18-Star Flag&quot;, &quot;Five-Colored Flag&quot;, and other designs were used elsewhere.

When the government of the Republic of China was established on January 1, 1912, the &quot;Five-Colored&quot; flag was adopted as the national flag, but Sun Yat-sen did not consider its design appropriate, reasoning that horizontal order implied a hierarchy or class like that which existed during dynastic times. Thus, when he established a rival government in Guangzhou in 1917, he brought over the &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; flag for the party and the &quot;Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth&quot; () flag, which was then the naval ensign, for the nation. This officially became the national flag in 1928 while the &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; flag was adopted as the naval jack.

The &quot;Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth&quot; flag has remained the flag of the Republic of China to this day.

== National emblem and history ==

===Beiyang period===


The national emblem of the Republic of China was derived from the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. The emblem was designed by He Yingqin at Whampoa Military Academy in 1924 and was set as the national emblem by the &quot;Law of national flag and national emblem of the Republic of China&quot; in 1928.

On the national emblem rays of sun have some distance to the edge, symbolizing the broadness of the sky, while on Kuomintang emblem the rays reach the edge, symbolizing the spirit of revolution is as powerful as the sun.

The national emblem of the Republic of China from 1913 to 1928 is called Twelve Symbols national emblem, based on the traditional symbols on clothes of ancient Chinese emperors. It was designed by Lu Xun, Qian Daosun and Xu Shoushang on August 28, 1912, and was set as national emblem in February 1913. It remained as the national emblem during the Empire of China from 1915 to 1916. After the Northern Expedition it was replaced by the Blue Sky with a White Sun national emblem in 1928.

===Nationalist period===

Since 1928, under the KMT&#x27;s political tutelage, the Blue Sky with a White Sun Flag shared the same prominence as the ROC flag. A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of National Father Sun Yat-sen displayed in the center. After the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China, the party flag was removed from such a display and the national flag was moved to the center.
To promote a sense of national identity, the design of the national emblem was freely available to use and was featured prominently in corporate logos, art during the era.

===Taiwanese period===
Since the ROC government moved to Taiwan and especially in the years since the end of martial law the KMT flag has lost some of its prominence. However, it is still frequently seen on KMT party buildings, in political rallies and other meetings of KMT and the pan-blue coalition.

The flag and the symbol made news during the ROC legislative elections of 2004, when President Chen Shui-bian suggested that the Kuomintang&#x27;s flag and party emblem violated the ROC&#x27;s National Emblem Law for being too similar to the national emblem of the Republic of China. Chen stated that the law forbids the ROC&#x27;s emblem and flag from being used by non-governmental organizations and warned that the KMT would have three months to change its flag and emblem if his Democratic Progressive Party won a majority of seats in the legislature. The KMT responded by asking the government to change the national emblem, saying the KMT emblem existed first. However, the pan-green coalition failed to win a majority, and Chen took no action for the remainder of his presidency.

On 29 January 2021, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution proposed by the New Power Party on 29 January instructing the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) to look into ways of addressing the issue of the similarity between the national emblem, in use since 1928 for all of China, and the KMT party flag. The MOI responded that through their analysis of the current situation, the change &quot;should not be taken lightly,&quot; though suggesting that symbols of political parties could be changed.

==Use in other countries==
The design of &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; was used in the unit insignia or coats of arms of some units of the United States Army that fought in World War II. The most famous unit was Merrill&#x27;s Marauders (officially named the &quot;5307th Composite Unit (Provisional)&quot;), which has the &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; as part of its badge. The usage by US troops was a result of cooperation between US and Chinese Expeditionary Force in the China Burma India Theater. Postwar US military units stationed in Taiwan, including the United States Taiwan Defense Command (USTDC) and the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), also used the design in their badges.

Up to now, the &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; can still be seen in the emblem of the US Army 75th Ranger Regiment.

==Other emblems==
===Historical Taiwanese emblems===
Taiwan&#x27;s earliest emblems were used during the European periods.

In 1895, Taiwan was annexed by Japan. The emblem was worn as an official clothing of the Governor&#x27;s Office in Taiwan which featured a Daijishō with a Sycamore leaf and chrysanthemum branch in a brown circle.

After the end of Japanese period, Taiwan was transferred to the Republic of China which adopted the Blue Sky with a White Sun emblem. This symbol remains in use to this day in Taiwan and by the Kuomintang.

===Chinese Taipei===
After the People&#x27;s Republic of China became an IOC member, the ROC was forced to use the name Chinese Taipei for its competitions. The crest of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee includes symbols of the Olympic Committee and the Chinese Taipei team. At the periphery is a stylized plum blossom that symbolizes the National Flower of the Republic of China. The center of the emblem contains the Olympic rings and the Blue Sky with a White Sun (the proportion of the blue field is between that of the National Emblem of the Republic of China and the Party Emblem of the Kuomintang). The Olympic flag of Chinese Taipei depicts the emblem on a white field.

<text>Kenneth Lofton (born May 31, 1967) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) center fielder. Lofton was a six-time All-Star (1994–1999), four-time Gold Glove Award winner (1993–1996), and at retirement, was ranked 15th among all-time stolen-base leaders with 622. During his career, he played for the Houston Astros, Cleveland Indians, Atlanta Braves, Chicago White Sox, San Francisco Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Texas Rangers.

Lofton attended the University of Arizona on a basketball scholarship. The Wildcats made it to the Final Four in 1988. He did not join the school&#x27;s baseball team until his junior year.

Lofton made 11 postseason appearances, including World Series appearances in 1995 and 2002 with the Indians and Giants, respectively. From 2001 to 2007, Lofton did not spend more than one consecutive season with a team. For his career, the Indians were the only team he played with for longer than one season and the only franchise he played for more than once. Lofton played seasons with the Indians, helping the organization win six division titles. In 2010, he was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame.

During his professional baseball career, Lofton&#x27;s single-season stolen-base count led the American League (AL) on five occasions and all of MLB three times. In 1994, he led the AL in hits, and in 1995, he led the majors in triples. Lofton holds the all-time postseason stolen-base record with 34, having broken Rickey Henderson&#x27;s record in 2007. Of his base running, Frank White said, &quot;Lofton has out-thought a lot of major-league players&quot; and later, &quot;a smart, complete baseball player.&quot;

==Early life==
Lofton was raised by his widowed grandmother, Rosie Person, in East Chicago, Indiana. His mother, Annie, had Lofton while she was in high school; he weighed just at birth. His mother moved to Alabama after she graduated and lost contact with Lofton during his childhood. Of his father, Lofton said, &quot;We, as a family, don&#x27;t even talk about it.&quot; Person had glaucoma, and because of her failing eyesight, was unemployed. She refused to go on welfare, but did collect Social Security as a result of her husband&#x27;s death in 1960 (of bronchial pneumonia). When Lofton made the majors, he built a new home in East Chicago for his grandmother and other family members.

Lofton attended Washington High School in East Chicago and played on the school&#x27;s baseball team as a pitcher and center fielder. He was an all-state basketball player.

Lofton is the uncle of the actor Cirroc Lofton, who played Jake Sisko in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

==College basketball and baseball==

Lofton accepted a scholarship from the University of Arizona to play college basketball for the Arizona Wildcats. For the Wildcats, Lofton was the backup point guard (to Craig McMillan and Steve Kerr) on a team that made it to the Final Four of the 1988 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. He was the starting point guard the following year when the Wildcats made it to the Sweet Sixteen. Lofton is one of only two men to play in a college basketball Final Four (1988) and an MLB World Series. (The other is fellow East Chicago Washington High School alumnus Tim Stoddard.) He left as the Wildcats&#x27; leader in career steals (a record eventually broken). &quot;In strength and agility drills, he just killed it. He&#x27;s a guy who could have played pro football or basketball or baseball,&quot; said former Wildcats teammate Bruce Fraser.

Lofton decided to try out for the Arizona Wildcats baseball team during his junior year. He played in just five baseball games and recorded only one official at-bat while at Arizona, but his speed and potential were recognized by baseball scouts, including the Houston Astros&#x27; Clark Crist. The Astros later selected Lofton in the 17th round of the 1988 MLB draft. He played minor-league baseball during the summer while completing his basketball eligibility at Arizona. The Astros organization asked Lofton to play minor-league baseball in the Florida Instructional League, but Lofton declined, citing a promise he had made to his grandmother to obtain his degree.

Lofton earned a degree in studio production at the University of Arizona while playing minor-league baseball for the Houston Astros. He credits his post-MLB success, as owner of FilmPool, Inc., to that education. Lofton is also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

==Minor league career==
Lofton struggled early in his professional baseball career in the Astros&#x27; farm system. He hit .214 in 48 games as an outfielder for the Auburn Astros of the New York–Penn League, but recorded 26 stolen bases in 30 attempts. Lofton returned to Auburn in 1989 and hit .263 with 26 steals in 34 games. He then hit .329 with 14 steals in 22 games for the Asheville Tourists in the South Atlantic League. As his college basketball career came to an end, Lofton was able to concentrate on baseball, and he improved rapidly, finishing second in the league in hitting at .331 while adding 62 steals for the Osceola Astros in the Florida State League. He also drew 61 walks and improved defensively (.974 fielding percentage) and played in 123 games with Osceola.

After spring training in 1991, he went directly to the Triple-A Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League. His 168 hits led the league. He hit .308 with 30 steals and 52 walks for Tucson with 19 doubles and a team-high 17 triples. The Toros won the PCL championship and Lofton made the league&#x27;s All-Star team. On September 14, 1991, the Astros promoted Lofton to the majors.

==Major league career==

===MLB season debut===
In his major league debut with the Houston Astros on September 14, 1991, he went 3-for-4 with a double and scored three runs against the Cincinnati Reds. He hit .203 in 20 games for the remainder of the Astros&#x27; regular season. With Steve Finley already entrenched as Houston&#x27;s centerfielder, Lofton was traded during the off season to the Cleveland Indians with Dave Rohde for catcher Eddie Taubensee and right-handed pitcher Willie Blair. &quot;I know they gave up on me and now I&#x27;m glad they did. One man&#x27;s trash is another man&#x27;s treasure&quot;, Lofton said of the Astros&#x27; trading him.

===Cleveland Indians===

During his first season with Cleveland, in 1992, Lofton hit .285. His 66 stolen bases broke the all-time record for an AL rookie and was the most by an MLB rookie since Vince Coleman stole 110 in 1985. His season&#x27;s stolen-base count, which led the AL, also broke a franchise record (previously set by Miguel Diloné in 1980). Indians first-base coach Dave Nelson helped Lofton refine his baserunning technique and helped him learn how to be successful with bunting. Over his career, Lofton became one of the best bunters in baseball history. Lofton finished second (to the Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; Pat Listach) in AL Rookie of the Year balloting. After one season with Cleveland, Lofton agreed to a four-year, $6.3 million contract. The following season, Lofton broke his own Cleveland single-season stolen-base record, recording 70 (which led MLB). Lofton was selected to his first career All-Star Game during the 1994 season.

His development and impact in the league led Brewers manager Phil Garner to say, &quot;I remember how raw he was, and I&#x27;ve never seen anybody develop into that type of player that fast.&quot; Garner, who saw Lofton play in the minors, added, &quot;He went from a guy who could hardly get the ball past the infield to a guy who could hit the ball consistently. He always had good speed, but got lousy jumps and didn&#x27;t run the bases well. He has turned into a dominant player.&quot; The regular season was stopped abruptly with the MLB strike, which also led to the cancellation of the World Series. For the season, Lofton again led the AL with 60 stolen bases. His 160 hits on the season were highest in the AL and his .349 batting average was a career-best. He finished fourth in Most Valuable Player Award voting. When the strike began in August, the Indians were in second place by one game in the AL Central to the Chicago White Sox. Indians general manager John Hart said of Lofton, &quot;What a representative for our team and our city. He has the opportunity to be a George Brett-type player here, someone who is synonymous with a franchise.&quot; Lofton joined fellow Indians Carlos Baerga, Albert Belle, and Jim Thome to form &quot;the backbone of some Indians teams that were as dominant as any.&quot;

In 1995, Lofton was one of six Cleveland starters who batted .300 or higher (.310). He also had an MLB-best 13 triples. His 54 stolen bases led the AL for the third consecutive season. The Indians faced the Seattle Mariners in the 1995 ALCS. In the eighth inning of game six, Lofton had an infield bunt, stole second base, and scored from second on a passed ball between pitcher Randy Johnson and catcher Dan Wilson. The Indians won the game 4–0. It was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;the run that demoralized the Mariners.&quot; Fifteen years after Lofton&#x27;s crossing of home plate, the &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; recalled: &quot;Of all the electrifying moments on the Kenny Lofton highlight reel, none captures the essence of the player any better than his 180-foot dash to glory on October 17, 1995.&quot; As a result of winning the game, the Indians had won the ALCS and in so doing, Lofton and the Indians had brought the AL pennant to Cleveland for the first time since the 1954 season. &quot;I&#x27;m glad for the city of Cleveland to be able to experience this, because they haven&#x27;t experienced this for a long time. The city of Cleveland has grown a lot, and it&#x27;s improving, and we tried to do this for the city&quot;, Lofton said. The Indians lost the World Series to the Braves in six games despite finishing the regular season with a major league-best 100–44 record in the strike-shortened year. Lofton finished with a .200 batting average and six stolen bases in his first World Series appearance. In 2010, a few years into his retirement, Lofton stated he felt it was the toughest postseason loss of his 11 career playoff appearances, namely because he felt the umpires had favorable strike zones for Braves pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.

The following season in 1996, the Indians again had the best record in baseball (99–62) and Lofton&#x27;s stolen-base total (75) led MLB for the second time in four years. He hit .317 and had a career-high 67 RBIs. The Indians lost in the 1996 ALDS to the Baltimore Orioles in four games. 

Near the end of spring training in 1997, Lofton was traded to the Atlanta Braves. On trading Lofton, Hart said, &quot;We had to make this trade based on the fact that Lofton could be a free agent at the end of this season. We went through it with Albert Belle last year, and Albert left and we had nothing in return. We were not prepared to do that again.&quot; Lofton, described as &quot;an emotional and offensive catalyst&quot; with the Indians, appeared in three consecutive All-Star games (1994–1996) and won four straight Gold Glove Awards (1993–1996) with the Indians. He led the AL in stolen bases for five straight seasons (1992–1996) and set the single-season Indians&#x27; franchise stolen base record (75).

===Atlanta Braves===

The Atlanta Braves&#x27; Marquis Grissom and slugger David Justice were part of a Braves roster that, heading into the 1997 season, was MLB&#x27;s highest-paid. Grissom ($4.8 million annual salary) and Justice ($6 million) were traded to the Indians in return for Lofton ($4.75 million) and Alan Embree ($206,000). &quot;This is a trade of enormous magnitude for two very, very good franchises. We&#x27;re talking about franchise-type players&quot;, Hart said. For Lofton, considered &quot;the centerpiece of the Indians&#x27; 1990s revival&quot;, it was a return to the National League. &quot;The trade will be in the back of my mind for a long time, but it&#x27;s baseball. It happens to nearly everybody. I&#x27;m [in Atlanta] to play every day. It&#x27;s all Braves from now on&quot;, Lofton said. By April 19, the Braves were 13–3 and Lofton&#x27;s hitting (.453 batting average) had won favor with his new Braves teammates. &quot;If he keeps hitting .400, he&#x27;ll fit in just fine&quot;, said Chipper Jones. For the season, Lofton&#x27;s .333 batting average and 27 stolen bases were team highs (his stolen-base total was to that point a career low). He was caught stealing 20 times, an MLB high. Atlanta won the NL East division with an MLB-best 101–61 record. The Braves swept the Houston Astros in the 1997 National League Division Series (NLDS), three games to none. In the 1997 National League Championship Series (NLCS), the Braves lost to the Florida Marlins, four games to two (the Marlins later defeated the Cleveland Indians in the World Series). For the NLCS, Lofton batted .185 and was one of three Braves&#x27; hitters who recorded seven strikeouts in the series. For Lofton, who was eligible for free agency at the end of the season, it was his only season with the Braves.

===Return to Cleveland===
Lofton, who was considered the &quot;most sought-after free agent&quot; following the 1997 season, returned to the AL and Cleveland Indians when he signed a three-year, $24 million contract. Happy to return to Cleveland, Lofton said, &quot;It&#x27;s like I was a ghost for a year. But now I&#x27;m back.&quot; In 1998, Lofton&#x27;s batting average dropped to .282, but his 87 walks were a career high, and his 54 stolen bases were double his previous year&#x27;s 27. The Indians won the AL Central with an 89–73 record and their match-up against the Boston Red Sox, three games to one, in the 1998 ALDS. In the series against the Red Sox, Lofton&#x27;s .375 batting average led the Indians, as did his two stolen bases and six hits. The Indians lost the 1998 ALCS in six games to the New York Yankees, who had won 114 games in the regular season. Lofton tied for third-most number of hits and strikeouts and his 27 at-bats led the Indians. Lofton finished the 1999 season with a .301 batting average, but stole only 25 bases. The AL Central-winning Indians (97–65) lost in the 1999 ALDS to the Boston Red Sox, three games to two. The Indians had led in the series two games to none before losing three games in a row and the series. Lofton and Roberto Alomar each had two stolen bases in the series, but Lofton recorded just two hits in 16 at-bats. In Game 5, Lofton dislocated his left shoulder and tore his rotator cuff while diving into first base.

On September 3, 2000, in a 12–11 win over the Baltimore Orioles, Lofton tied an MLB record previously held by Red Rolfe when he scored in 18 consecutive games. He tied an Indians&#x27; franchise single-game record with five stolen bases and won the game with a 13th-inning walk-off home run. He finished the 2000 season batting .278, recording 30 stolen bases and 107 runs (the sixth time crossing home plate 100 times or more in nine seasons), as well as a career-high 15 home runs and 73 runs batted in. The Indians finished the regular season 90–72 and one game out of the wild card. After missing the postseason in 2000, the Indians returned in 2001 after winning the AL Central with a 91–71 regular-season record. Before winning the division, however, Lofton scored the game-winning run during an August 5 game against the Seattle Mariners; the Indians were down by 12 runs, and became just the third team in MLB history to overcome such a deficit, winning 15–14 in 11 innings. Indians catcher Eddie Taubensee, who was involved in the trade that sent Lofton from Houston to Cleveland at the beginning of his MLB career, caught Lofton after he slid into home plate and jumped with excitement after discovering he had just scored the game-winning run. &quot;I caught him and wasn&#x27;t going to let him go&quot;, Taubensee said. Cleveland won that game against Seattle, but lost their match-up with the 116-win Mariners in the 2001 ALDS. He hit 66 RBIs on the regular season (second-most in his career), but failed to record 20 stolen bases for the first time in his major-league career and batted a career-low .261. Lofton had been treated for a rib-cage problem that had affected his play before the All-Star break. His second stint with Cleveland lasted through 2001, in which his salary was for $8 million in his final contract year with the club. He became a free agent at the conclusion of the season.

===World Series ring pursuit===
A free agent in 2002, Lofton signed a one-year, $1.025 million contract with the Chicago White Sox. &quot;I looked at the different opportunities that I had and this was a team that won 83 games last year while they were banged up. Cleveland lost four good players from last year&#x27;s team, and that&#x27;s going to be hard to replace. This was an easy decision&quot;, Lofton said on signing with the White Sox. White Sox general manager Kenny Williams had stated when Lofton was healthy, like he was during the second half of the 2001 season, Chicago had obtained one of the best leadoff hitters in the game. When the White Sox were paired against the Indians in April during a three-game series at Chicago, the Indians were on a 10-game winning streak and at 11–1, had the best record in the majors. The White Sox ended the streak, and for the series, Lofton was 6-for-14 with six runs scored. &quot;You can&#x27;t say enough about him, his effort, his intensity. He&#x27;s been simply amazing&quot;, said White Sox manager Jerry Manuel. Lofton appeared in 93 games with the White Sox and hit .259 with 42 RBIs and 22 stolen bases. On July 28, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants of the NL for minor leaguers Ryan Meaux and Félix Díaz.

In the Giants&#x27; match-up with the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2002 NLCS, Lofton delivered a key hit to help the Giants win their first pennant since 1989. In the ninth inning, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa summoned left-handed reliever Steve Kline to face Lofton, who had already notched two singles in the game. Giants manager Dusty Baker considered bringing a right-handed hitter to pinch-hit for Lofton, but decided against doing so on the advice of his three-year-old son. Lofton hit a first-pitch single to the outfield, scoring David Bell from second base and creating a 2–1 Giants victory. After the game, Baker remarked, &quot;I just knew Kenny was focused and I know you can&#x27;t keep Kenny down for too long. That&#x27;s why we got Kenny over here. He&#x27;s a big-game player and he&#x27;s been great in the playoffs.&quot; The Giants held a five-run lead in the seventh inning of game six of the World Series against the Anaheim Angels, but eight outs away from winning the World Series, the Angels rallied to win 6–5. The Angels took game seven the following night, with Lofton flying out to Darin Erstad in center to end that game and the World Series, and for the second time in his career, Lofton had lost a World Series.

The Pittsburgh Pirates signed Lofton to a one-year, $1.025 million contract to begin the 2003 season. With the Pirates, he hit .277 and stole 18 bases in 84 games before being traded to the Chicago Cubs, where he was reunited with manager Dusty Baker. When Lofton joined the Cubs in July, he was joining a team that just one season before had lost 95 games. &quot;With Kenny Lofton, we got a quality lead-off man&quot;, said Cubs general manager Jim Hendry. In 56 regular-season appearances with the Cubs, Lofton stole 12 bases and hit .327. Lofton and the Cubs won the NL Central division (88–74). The Cubs&#x27; postseason berth was just the sixth time since the divisional series format was introduced (1969) that a team made the postseason after having lost 95 games or more the previous season. Chicago beat the Atlanta Braves three games to two in the 2003 NLDS. Lofton hit .286 in the series and led the Cubs with three stolen bases and 21 at-bats. The Cubs, who were up in the series three games to one, held a three-run lead in the eighth inning of game six of the 2003 NLCS. The Florida Marlins scored eight unanswered runs, all in the eighth inning, to win game six and won game seven the following night to eliminate the Cubs. Lofton&#x27;s .323 against the Marlins led the Cubs&#x27; starting line-up, as did his 31 at-bats, and he had the team&#x27;s only stolen base of the seven-game series.

Lofton was again on the move when on December 23, 2003, the New York Yankees signed him to a two-year, $6.2 million contract. During a Yankees&#x27; road game at Cleveland, Lofton recorded his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton&#x27;s single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I figured I&#x27;d get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook way for me to get it, to get it in Cleveland, it was something to remember.&quot; New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 101–61. To begin the postseason, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 2–0 series lead when Lofton stated, &quot;My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I&#x27;m at a point in my career – I&#x27;ve been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again.&quot; Then the Yankees went up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 3–0 series lead.

Lofton, who appeared in 83 games with the Yankees, felt manager Joe Torre did not use his skills appropriately. Lofton finished the regular season with a .275 batting average and a career-low seven stolen bases. With the Yankees looking to reshape their roster and the Philadelphia Phillies looking for a player with postseason experience, Lofton was dealt on December 3, 2004, which as part of the deal also had the Yankees sending $1.525 million to Philadelphia and the Phillies giving up reliever Felix Rodríguez. After the trade, Lofton stated, &quot;It&#x27;s been very tough. I&#x27;m the kind of guy who likes to be settled down. It&#x27;s been very tough the last three or four years. Everyone in New York understood I wanted to play. I just wanted an opportunity to perform and be a part of the team. I didn&#x27;t feel as much of a part of the team.&quot;

With the Phillies, Lofton hit .335 in 110 appearances, his batting average a team high. He also recorded 22 stolen bases. The Phillies finished 88–74, two games from the NL East division winners and one game out of the wild card. Toward the end of his career, Lofton was featured in a DHL Express TV commercial, where the international shipper comically portrayed Lofton&#x27;s frequent city changes and subsequent moves.
On December 12, 2006, the Texas Rangers signed Lofton to a one-year contract. By signing with the Rangers, Lofton tied Todd Zeile for most teams played for by a position player. In 84 games with the Rangers, he hit .303 with 16 doubles.

On July 27, 2007, Lofton was traded by the Rangers to the Indians in exchange for minor-league catcher Max Ramírez. &quot;That&#x27;s my biggest thing right now. I&#x27;m trying to get a World Series ring,&quot; Lofton said on joining the Indians for the third time in his career. The Jacobs Field crowd greeted Lofton with a standing ovation during his first at-bat for this tour of duty with the Indians. Lofton noted, &quot;I missed being in Cleveland... I enjoy Cleveland. It&#x27;s the city that got me going.&quot; In game one of the 2007 ALDS against the Yankees, he went 3-for-4 with four RBIs and one stolen base, which tied him with Rickey Henderson for MLB&#x27;s all-time postseason stolen-base record (33). In game two, he went 2-for-3 with two walks and scored the winning run in the 11th inning. Then, in game three of the 2007 ALCS, the 40-year-old Lofton hit a two-run home run against the Boston Red Sox&#x27; Daisuke Matsuzaka, becoming the seventh-oldest player to hit a postseason home run. Lofton earned his 34th career postseason stolen base in game four of the 2007 ALCS, setting a new MLB record for playoff steals. The Indians, who at one point had a 3–1 game lead over the Red Sox, eventually lost the series. In game seven, Lofton was called out while attempting to steal second base, but the replay showed that he was safe. He was also held up at third base while attempting to tie the game, in a call that was criticized by Cleveland fans for years. Lofton became a free agent at the end of the season, but did not sign a contract with an MLB team. He expressed interest in playing before the 2009 season.

From 2002 to 2007, Lofton played for eight teams and made it to the postseason with four of them. Joe Torre said, after Lofton had been to the playoffs in 11 of the past 13 seasons and played for 11 clubs in his career, &quot;He bounced around a lot of clubs for a reason: They felt he could help them. He did a hell of a job.&quot; As Rollie Fingers wrote, &quot;On one hand, Lofton could be seen as a catalyst who magically sparked his teams into playoff contention, but others could say that it was simply a case of top playoff contenders repeatedly seeing him as the final piece of their puzzle.&quot;

===Retirement and Indians Hall of Fame===
His 622 stolen bases rank him 15th all-time. He holds the Indians&#x27; record for stolen bases with 452. Lofton had tallied a .299 career batting average with 130 home runs, 116 triples, and 1,528 runs in 2,103 games. He was also a three-time MLB Player of the Week. Lofton played in 95 postseason games. In the playoffs for his career, he hit .247 with seven home runs and 34 RBI. Baseball historian Bill James named Lofton the &quot;fastest player&quot; and &quot;best bunter&quot; of the 1990s.

On January 27, 2010, Lofton was announced as being selected as a member of the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame. He was inducted on August 7.

Lofton was eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013, and some have written his career numbers &quot;will likely put him in the conversation of being Hall of Fame worthy&quot;. He did not receive the necessary number of votes to remain on the ballot for 2014 and beyond. In 2015, Pedro Martínez, one of the most dominant pitchers of Lofton&#x27;s era, named Lofton as among the most difficult hitters to pitch against in his career. Lofton falling off the BBWAA ballot after one year despite his career statistics, accolades, and relatively clean reputation during the steroid era has often been considered by baseball fans as one of the most egregious Hall of Fame exclusions in history, and has been used as an example of criticism towards the election process.

==Post-playing career==
Lofton has his own television production company, FilmPool, Inc. In 1997, he appeared as a guest star on &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;, and in 2004, he appeared as a guest star on &quot;George Lopez&quot;. Lofton co-wrote the song &quot;What If&quot; on Ruben Studdard&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Soulful&quot;. In 2008, Lofton qualified for the American Century Celebrity Golf Classic. He played golf in the off season during his playing days. For the 2011 spring-training season, Lofton was hired by the Indians to coach baserunning and outfield work. He also served as a commentator on the Fox Sports West postgame show for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Lofton considers himself a perfectionist. &quot;I love cleaning. I clean up, wash dishes, and make a good bed. I&#x27;m pretty neat. I&#x27;m a perfectionist. People come to my house and they&#x27;re like, &#x27;Man, do you actually live here?&#x27;&quot;

In August 2022, Lofton was sued by a former employee of Lofton&#x27;s investment company, who claimed that he was fired by Lofton for complaining that Lofton had sent sexually explicit photos of himself to women in the company. The former employee alleged that he was fired in retaliation for complaining about the photos to the company&#x27;s in-house attorney, and the former employee also claimed that he was not paid for his work.

<doc id="1264756" wikidata="Q1216239" url="?curid=1264756" title="Les Shadoks">
<text>Les Shadoks () is an animated television series created by French cartoonist Jacques Rouxel (26 February 1931 – 25 April 2004) which caused a sensation in France when it was first broadcast in 1968–1974.

==Synopsis==
The Shadoks were bird-like in appearance (in the tradition of cartoon birds they had beaks with teeth), were characterised by ruthlessness and stupidity and inhabited a two dimensional planet. This planet was of irregular shape, which was continuously changing - causing major earthquakes - hence their desire to find a new home world.
There was a series of caves on the Shadok planet, known as the &quot;Gulp&quot; which was essentially a prison for undesirables.

One Shadok who stood apart from the others was the pirate - who was habitually drunk - and instead of the popular hobby of putting ships into bottles - he liked to put bottles into his ship.

Another set of creatures in the Shadok canon are the Gibis, who are the opposite to the Shadoks in that they are intelligent but vulnerable and also inhabit a two-dimensional planet. The Gibis were polite, always greeted each other formally, and kept their brains inside their bowler hats. The Gibi planet was a flat disc, finely balanced that if one Gibi went to one end of the planet; another would have to go to the far end to keep the planet balanced. Thus, the Gibis also wanted to find a new home world.

Ultimately, both saw the Earth as their ideal home - and both began to construct rockets to reach it.

The Shadoks were eventually able to leave their world thanks to the improved intelligence of one of their number; who happened to find a hat which one of the Gibis had lost.

Once both races reached Earth, much mayhem followed and they eventually realised it was not the ideal home they first thought.

==Production==
Rouxel claims that the term Shadok obtains some derivation from Captain Haddock of Hergé&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and the Gibis (who wear Bowler hats, which unlike their heads, contain their brains) are essentially GBs (Great Britons).

==Legacy==
The Shadoks were a significant literary, cultural and philosophical phenomenon in France.

Even today, the French occasionally use satirical comparisons with the Shadoks for policies and attitudes that they consider absurd. The Shadoks were noted for mottos such as:
* &quot;Why do it the easy way when you can do it the hard way?&quot;
* &quot;When one tries continuously, one ends up succeeding. Thus, the more one fails, the greater the chance that it will work.&quot;
* &quot;If there is no solution, it is because there is no problem.&quot;
* &quot;To reduce the numbers of unhappy people, always beat up the same individuals.&quot;
* &quot;Every advantage has its disadvantages and vice versa.&quot;
* &quot;If there is one chance out of a 1000 to succeed, rush failing the 999 first tries.&quot;
* &quot;And the shadoks pumped, pumped, pumped...&quot;

==About the Shadoks==
The Shadoks have four monosyllabic words in their language: &quot;Ga&quot;, &quot;Bu&quot;, &quot;Zo&quot;, &quot;Meu&quot; (French spelling). But their brain have only four cells, so if they had to learn a new word (e.g. &quot;Ni&quot;), they would only remember the last four ones heard.

The Shadoks were also noted for their seemingly useless and endless pumping — as the Shadok say: &quot;Better to pump even if nothing happens than to risk something worse happening by not pumping&quot; and &quot;When the Shadoks pumped, nothing happened; and the more they pumped, the more nothing happened.&quot;

==Broadcast==
In 1973, The Shadoks appeared on Thames Television, London&#x27;s ITV company (later replaced by Carlton Television), in the early evening. Kenneth Robinson provided the narration in English. His narration to The Shadoks is very fondly remembered by those who heard it.

On 18 September 2007, Les Shadoks was shown on Gulli&#x27;s flagship retro block, &quot;Télégrenadine&quot;.

==Google Doodle==
On April 29, 2016, four animated Google Doodles were shown on the Google.fr homepage for Les Shadok&#x27;s 48th anniversary.
