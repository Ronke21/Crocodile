<text>Maria Teresa de Filippis (11 November 1926 – 8 January 2016) was an Italian racing driver, and the first woman to race in Formula One. She participated in five World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 18 May 1958, but scored no championship points. Though her Formula One racing career was brief, she won races in other series and is remembered as a pioneer in the sport.

==Biography==

De Filippis was born on 11 November 1926 in Marigliano, Italy. She was the youngest of five children of an Italian count, Serino Francesco De Filippis, and a Spanish noblewoman, Narcisa Anselmi Balaguer Roca de Togores y Ruco y Perpignan. De Filippis&#x27; father owned the 16th-century Palazzo Marigliano in Naples, where she grew up. She started displaying an interest in sport since her teenage years, being a keen horse rider and tennis player.

===Early career===

In the late 1940s, at the end of World War II, de Filippis developed an interest in motorsport. Despite some reservations from her intimate circle of friends and relatives (two of her brothers told her that she would not be able to go very fast, goading her and making a bet that she would be slow), at the age of 22, de Filippis began her racing career. She won her first race, driving a Fiat 500 on a 10 km drive between Salerno and Cava de&#x27; Tirreni. This result gave her the confidence to compete in the Italian sports car championship, where she finished second in the 1954 season. Seeing her potential, Maserati brought her in as the works driver.

In the following years, de Filippis took part in various motor racing events, including hillclimbing and endurance racing. She finished second in a sportscar race supporting the 1956 Naples Grand Prix, driving a Maserati 200S.

===Formula One===

In 1958 de Filippis was given the chance to drive a Formula One car. Although Maserati was a successful Formula One chassis manufacturer in the 1950s, supplying several teams and winning numerous races (in Juan Manuel Fangio won the drivers&#x27; title in a Maserati 250F, his fifth and final championship win), by 1958 the team had officially withdrawn from the sport but many of the cars remained available to privateers. On 18 May 1958 de Filippis was given the opportunity to enter the Monaco Grand Prix, the second round of the 1958 Formula One season, in one of the 250Fs. Of the 31 entrants only half set a time good enough to qualify, with de Filippis missing out alongside fellow debutant and future Formula One Management and Formula One Administration president Bernie Ecclestone. Ecclestone and de Filippis forged a friendship on the occasion, and remained on good terms for the years to come. De Filippis&#x27;s time of 1:50.8 was 5.8 seconds behind the qualifying time of the fastest 16 which included future world champions Mike Hawthorn, Jack Brabham, and Graham Hill in his first race. Fangio gave de Filippis plenty of advice during the season. In a 2006 interview, she recalled that Fangio told her, &quot;You go too fast, you take too many risks.&quot;

The 1958 Belgian Grand Prix allowed all drivers to compete with no cut-off for a qualifying time. De Filippis qualified in 19th place, nearly 34 seconds off Tony Brooks&#x27; pole position time and only ahead of a mechanically-hindered Ken Kavanagh. Although she was lapped twice in the 24 lap race she managed to finish, albeit in 10th and last place after nine other cars failed to finish. This would prove to be her only race finish.

At the following race, the French Grand Prix at Reims-Gueux on 6 July 1958, de Fillipis was prevented from competing. In a 2006 interview she claimed that the race director dismissed her by telling her that &quot;the only helmet a woman should wear is the one at the hairdresser&#x27;s&quot;.

On the occasion of the 1958 Portuguese Grand Prix in August, de Filippis qualified in last place, more than 15 seconds slower than the car ahead of her. Her race lasted only six laps before her engine failed. On 7 September 1958, she started her home Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza from last place. She completed 57 of the 70 laps before having to retire with engine problems. As the 14th and final retirement out of 21, she was classified as eighth.

In de Filippis joined the Behra-Porsche RSK team. She entered the Monaco Grand Prix but failed to qualify, her time of 1&#x27;47.8 being three seconds off the lowest qualifying pace and a further one second behind teammate Wolfgang von Trips. It turned out to be her final attempt at Grand Prix qualification.

===Retirement===

Following the death of Porsche team leader Jean Behra in a racing accident on 1 August 1959 while driving in the sports car support race for the 1959 German Grand Prix at AVUS, de Filippis, devastated by the event, left the circuit and retired from professional racing.

===Later career and death===

Around 1960 de Filippis married Austrian chemist Theodor Huschek, and started a family. She kept away from all forms of motor racing until 1979 when she joined the International Club of Former F1 Grand Prix Drivers. In 1997 she was appointed Vice-President. She was also a founding member of the Maserati Club in 2004 and went on to become its chairperson. De Filippis died in January 2016 at the age of 89.

==Legacy==

De Filippis was a pioneer in motor racing, a sport traditionally dominated by men. No woman would race in Formula One again for a further 15 years until fellow Italian Lella Lombardi competed between 1974 and 1976. Lombardi went on to become the first and only female driver to have finished a World Championship Formula One race in a point-scoring position. Three other women have since then tried to enter a Formula One race, albeit unsuccessfully – Giovanna Amati, Divina Galica and Desiré Wilson.

<doc id="1237440" wikidata="Q7430876" url="?curid=1237440" title="Schabir Shaik">
<text>Schabir Shaik (born ) is a South African businessman from Berea, Durban, who rose to prominence due to his close association with former South African President Jacob Zuma during Zuma&#x27;s time as Deputy President. On 2 June 2005, he was found guilty of corruption and fraud, which also led to Zuma&#x27;s dismissal by then President Thabo Mbeki.

==Early life and career==
Shaik was born in Johannesburg in the former Transvaal and grew up in Greenwood Park in Durban in the former Natal province. His father was an Indian South African from Pietermaritzburg in Natal; his mother was half-white and died in a car accident when he was a child. He is one of six brothers – his elder brothers are Salim and Faisal, and his younger brothers are Yunus, Moe, and Chippy – and also has a sister. In the early 1980s, his brother Yunus recruited him into an underground cell of the anti-apartheid African National Congress (ANC). In later years, his work for the ANC reportedly included transferring donor funds from London to South Africa.

At the same time, Shaik worked as a lecturer in the electrical engineering department at Peninsula Techikon until he resigned in 1986 because the institution raised questions about the veracity of his claim to hold a Hawaiian degree certificate. He pursued a Master&#x27;s diploma in engineering at the ML Sultan Technikon but left in 1990 after he was suspended for one year because, according to the institution, he cheated on an exam.

== Post-apartheid career ==

=== Nkobi Holdings ===
After the ANC was unbanned by the apartheid government in 1990, Shaik became an adviser to Thomas Nkobi, who at the time was ANC Treasurer-General. In early 1995, the year after apartheid ended, Shaik founded Nkobi Holdings and Nkobi Investments, named after Thomas Nkobi, who had recently died. Shaik had initially claimed that the Nkobi family trust held shares in Nkobi Holdings, justifying his use of Nkobi&#x27;s name; the Nkobi family denied that they held such shares or that any such family trust existed.

Shaik&#x27;s companies were based in the new province of KwaZulu-Natal and ultimately encompassed broad interests in defence, information technology, and infrastructure. Several sources told the &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; that during the mid-1990s Shaik attempted to use his ANC affiliation to further his business interests. Shaik later said that he and Nkobi had admired Malaysia&#x27;s &quot;bumiputera&quot; economic policy and that the Malaysian policy had inspired him to offer the ANC shares in his companies, an offer rejected by the ANC in 1995.

==== Transport contracts ====
Under Mac Maharaj, who was Minister of Transport from 1994 to 1999, the Department of Transport granted a R264-million contract to Prodiba, a consortium of companies which included a stake for Thomson-CSF (now Thales) and a 33 per cent stake for an Nkobi Holdings subsidiary called KobiTech. The contract was to produce South African driving licenses in a new card format and it was cancelled in 2013, although KobiTech was expelled from the consortium before then in 2007. During Maharaj&#x27;s tenure, another major contract – dealing with upgrades to the N3 highway – was granted to another consortium, the N3 Toll Road Consortium, of which Nkobi was a member. The Scorpions investigated Maharaj for several years on suspicion that the transport contracts had been granted improperly.

==== Arms Deal contracts ====

Shaik&#x27;s relationship with Thomson-CSF extended beyond their partnership in the driving license consortium. Nkobi Investments owned shares in Thomson-CSF and in Thomson-CSF Holdings, a joint venture with Thomson incorporated inside South Africa. He also had a significant stake in Altech Defence Systems (ADS, later renamed African Defence Systems), which Thomson-CSF acquired between April 1998 and February 1999. In the latter half of the 1990s, Shaik held directorships at Thomson-CSF, Thomson-CSF Holdings, Nkobi Holdings, Nkobi Investments, and ADS. Shaik thus acquired a substantial interest in the 1999 Arms Deal, a major defence procurement project of the South African government: both Thomson and ADS submitted bids for several defence contracts under the deal. Ultimately, when the deal was finalised in 1999, both companies were awarded subcontracts for the four Valour-class frigates which were to be procured for the South African Navy – in the case of Thomson-CSF, the subcontract was to provide the combat suites for the frigates.

=== Relationship to Jacob Zuma ===
Shaik was a personal friend of Jacob Zuma, an ANC stalwart who had known Shaik and his brothers during apartheid and who was appointed Deputy President of South Africa in 1999. In 2002, a Zuma spokesman said that their friendship was rooted in their shared experiences in the ANC in the 1980s. By that time, Shaik was also Zuma&#x27;s personal financial adviser.

In May 2002, Shaik appeared in court on charges that he illegally possessed classified minutes of President Thabo Mbeki&#x27;s cabinet; the documents were seized in a Scorpions raid.

He had a long-standing friendship with Jacob Zuma, who needed assistance with his finances after returning from political exile in Mozambique in 1990. Zuma had been elected Chairperson of the African National Congress, and Shaik assisted him financially, mostly in the form of interest-free loans with no date of repayment.

Nkobi Holdings was initially wholly owned by Shaik. The shareholding went through various permutations subsequently, however Shaik was at all relevant times a director of, and exercised effective control over, all the corporate entities within the Nkobi group.

His brother, Chippy Shaik, was in charge of arms acquisition at the Department of Defence, which allowed Shaik to bid on a lucrative contract to supply Valour class patrol corvettes to the South African Navy.

==Fraud and corruption==
By 2002, Shaik was under investigation by the Scorpions in connection with his relationship to Zuma and Thales. He was put on trial for fraud and corruption at the Durban High Court from 11 October 2004. During the course of the trial, Shaik admitted that he falsified his qualifications and business achievements.

The trial ended on 4 May 2005, with Judge Hilary Squires delivering his verdict on 2 June. Shaik was found guilty on two counts of corruption and one count of fraud, with judge Squires stating in his 165-page verdict that there was &quot;overwhelming&quot; evidence of a corrupt relationship between Shaik and Zuma. The fraud charge related to testimony by Ahmed Paruk, Shaik&#x27;s auditor, that Shaik held a meeting with him and Shaik&#x27;s financial manager, where it was agreed that false journal entries be made to alter Nkobi Holdings&#x27; financial statements. The second corruption charge relates to alleged attempts to solicit a bribe to Zuma from Thomson CSF.

On 8 June 2005 he was sentenced to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment on each of the two counts of corruption, as well as 3 years on the count of fraud. The sentences were to run concurrently, giving him an effective 15-year prison term. He was given leave to appeal against his sentence on 26 July; his bail was extended until then. His appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal failed on 6 November 2006.

As a consequence of the ruling, Zuma was dismissed from his post as deputy president by President Thabo Mbeki on 14 June 2005.

On 2 October 2007, Shaik&#x27;s appeal to the Constitutional Court of his conviction and sentence for corruption and fraud was turned down, with the court ruling that &quot;An appeal against conviction and sentence does not bear any reasonable prospect of success&quot;.

However, the court ruled that there might be a constitutional issue related to the seizure of assets belonging to him and his company, and granted leave to appeal on that point. The court dismissed this appeal in April 2008.

==Parole==
On 3 March 2009 Shaik was released on medical parole, after serving two years and four months of his 15-year prison term. The head of cardiology at Inkosi Albert Lutuli hospital in Durban, Professor DP Naidoo, personally discharged Shaik in December 2008 because he was considered well enough to leave. However, Shaik remained in the ward until his parole. There have been several accusations of Shaik violating the terms of his parole – including staying at Thanda Private Game Reserve for three nights in June 2009. The Department of Correctional Services said Shaik&#x27;s parole officer had given him permission to recuperate in a luxury lodge.

==References in popular culture==
In November 2006 the South African comic strip Madam &amp; Eve ran a series of strips lampooning Shaik&#x27;s arrival in prison, followed in March 2009 by a series lampooning Shaik&#x27;s dismissal.

<text>Mário Manuel Veloso de Araújo Cabral (; 15 January 1934 – 17 August 2020), commonly known by the nickname &quot;Nicha&quot; Cabral (), was a racing driver from Portugal. He participated in five Formula One World Championship Grands Prix (four starts), debuting on 23 August 1959. He did not score any championship points. In 2009, at the age of 75, Cabral came out as bisexual.

==Racing career==
Son of the second marriage of the 1st Count of Vizela, Cabral was regarded as Portugal&#x27;s outstanding driver of the late 1950s and competed in the Portuguese Grand Prix in 1959 and 1960 finishing in tenth place and retiring respectively.
In the 1959 Grand Prix at the Circuito de Monsanto, Jack Brabham claimed Cabral was responsible for causing the accident which left future triple world champion lucky to escape with his life. According to Brabham, Cabral collided with the Australian while he was being lapped, causing Brabham to spin and then somersault into a telegraph post. Brabham was thrown out of the car, which landed in the middle of the circuit, but was avoided by the other drivers. Cabral, in his biography &quot;Nicha - Mário de Araújo Cabral&quot;, made it very clear that he kept his racing line and it was Brabham that tried to overtake at a dangerous place. Cabral&#x27;s car was not damaged and finished the race in 10th place, 4 laps down. He was the first Portuguese driver to start a Formula One race.

Cabral did not pursue a full-time racing career but drove for Scuderia Centro Sud in the 1961 Pau Grand Prix. His career was then interrupted by National Service which he spent as a paratrooper in Angola. He returned to Formula One with Centro Sud in 1963 retiring from the German Grand Prix and failing to qualify at Monza. His Formula One career ended with a retirement from the 1964 Italian Grand Prix in the Derrington-Francis-ATS.

Cabral was seriously injured in the 1965 Formula Two Rouen-Les-Essarts Grand Prix and was absent from competition until 1968 when he returned to race sportscars and occasionally in Formula Two before retiring in 1975.

<doc id="1237444" wikidata="Q1780541" url="?curid=1237444" title="Soil Stradivarius">
<text>The Soil Stradivarius (pronounced ) of 1714 is an antique violin made by Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari of Cremona (1644–1737). It is one of 700 known extant Stradivari instruments. The instrument was made during Stradivari&#x27;s &quot;golden period&quot; and is named after the Belgian industrialist Amédée Soil. The current owner of the violin is violinist Itzhak Perlman.

==Ownership==
&quot;The Soil&quot; was acquired by Yehudi Menuhin in 1950, who played on it for several decades. It was sold in 1986 to its current owner, Itzhak Perlman, who played this instrument while recording the &quot;Cinema Serenade&quot; with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 1997.. The extended provenance of this violin includes the French luthier and collector Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume and the Viennese collector Oscar Bondy, who also owned the &quot;Hellier Stradivarius&quot; of 1679.

==Characteristics==
A product of Stradivari’s golden period, it is considered one of his finest. One of two Stradivari violins named after Belgian industrialist Amédée Soil, this instrument is characterized by its brilliant red varnish and a two-piece maple back with the flames of the grain joined, descending from the edges toward the center.

Other sobriquet &quot;Soil&quot; violins are the Stradivari of 1708 and two by Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesù, 1733 and 1736.

<doc id="1237445" wikidata="Q172106" url="?curid=1237445" title="Masahiro Hasemi">
<text>is a former racing driver and team owner from Japan. He started racing motocross when he was 15 years old. In 1964 he signed to drive for Nissan. After establishing himself in saloon car and GT races in Japan, he participated in his only Formula One race at the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix for Kojima on 24 October 1976. He qualified 10th after an error which cost him his chance of a pole position and finished 11th, seven laps behind the winner. Contrary to a widely propagated but mistaken result, however, he never set a fastest lap in a Formula One championship race. Along with compatriots Noritake Takahara and Kazuyoshi Hoshino, he was the first Japanese driver to start a Formula One Grand Prix.

Hasemi became the Japanese Formula 2 champion in 1980, and got two titles in the Fuji Grand Champion Series in 1974 and 1980. After that he reverted to racing Skylines, which he became heavily synonymous with in Group 5, touring cars and JGTC. He won the Japanese Touring Car Championship in 1989, 1991 and 1992. He also won the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship in 1990, with the controversial win at the Guia Touring Car race at the Macau Grand Prix in 1990 and Daytona 24 hour in 1992. Hasemi retired from driving in 2001 and now runs NDDP Racing, a Super GT team that currently competes in the GT500 class. Hasemi also owns Hasemi Sport, a former Super GT racing team that ran under the Hasemi Motorsport banner and Nissan aftermarket parts company.

Hasemi is the most recent Japanese driver to win his home Grand Prix, winning it in 1975, when it was a non-championship race.

== Note on fastest lap in Formula One ==
It was initially announced that Hasemi set the fastest lap at the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix, but it was a measurement mistake, and, several days later, the circuit issued a press release to correct the fastest lap holder of the race to Jacques Laffite. This press release was promptly made known in Japan, and the Japan Automobile Federation (JAF) and Japanese media corrected the record. But this correction was not made well known outside Japan, thus, Hasemi remains credited with a fastest lap in many record books.

<text>Michael George Hartwell MacDowel (13 September 1932 – 19 January 2016) was an English racing driver who participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, the 1957 French Grand Prix on 7 July 1957, sharing his car with Jack Brabham. MacDowel did not score any championship points as he finished seventh (having qualified 15th and last), and points were only awarded to the first five finishers.

MacDowel was a keen amateur racer. After a break, he competed in hill climb events from 1968 until well after his 60th birthday. He set what was then the course record at Shelsley Walsh in 1973 (28.21 seconds for the 1000 yard course); further in both that season and the following year, he won the British Hill Climb Championship.

He died on 19 January 2016.

<text>Michael John Clifford Taylor (24 April 1934 – 4 April 2017) was a British racing driver. He participated in two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 18 July 1959. He scored no championship points. He also participated in several non-Championship Formula One races.
His racing career effectively ended when his steering column weld failed on his Lotus 18 in the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix at . He was thrown from the car, cutting down a tree with his body and broke several bones (Alan Stacey and Chris Bristow were killed and Stirling Moss was also injured at the event, crashing his Lotus 18 in practice). He was paralysed, but after therapy was able to regain the ability to walk.

Because of his car failure Taylor later sued Lotus successfully, one of the few successful actions against the makers of a racing car.

After his accident, Taylor sporadically competed in long distance rallying, finishing third in the London–Sydney Marathon in 1977 in a Citroën CX with Paddy Hopkirk and Bob Riley. Taylor also had a career in property speculation. He died on 4 April 2017 after a battle with cancer.

<text>A [[tram]]-train is a type of light rail vehicle that both meets the standards of a light rail system, and also national mainline standards. Tramcars are adapted to be capable of running on streets like an urban tramway but also be permitted operation alongside mainline trains. This allows services that can utilise both existing urban light rail systems and mainline railway networks and stations. It combines the urban accessibility of a tram or light rail with a mainline train&#x27;s greater speed in the suburbs.

The modern tram-train concept was pioneered by the German city of Karlsruhe in the late 1980s, resulting in the creation of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. This concept is often referred to as the Karlsruhe model, and it has since been adopted in other cities such as Mulhouse in France and in Kassel, Nordhausen and Saarbrücken in Germany.

An inversion of the concept is a train-tram – a mainline train adapted to run on-street in an urban tramway, also known as the Zwickau Model.

==Technology==
The tram-train often is a type of interurban — that is, they link separate towns or cities, according to George W. Hilton and John F. Due&#x27;s definition.

Most tram-trains are standard gauge, which facilitates sharing track with main-line trains. Exceptions include Alicante Tram and Nordhausen, which are metre gauge.

Tram-train vehicles are dual-equipped to suit the needs of both tram and train operating modes, with support for multiple electrification voltages if required and safety equipment such as train stops and other railway signalling equipment. The Karlsruhe and Saarbrücken systems use &quot;PZB&quot; or &quot;Indusi&quot; automatic train protection, so that if the driver passes a signal at a stop the emergency brakes are applied.

==History==
The idea is not new; in the early 20th century, interurban streetcar lines often operated on dedicated rights-of-way between towns, while running on street trackage in town. The first interurban to emerge in the United States was the Newark and Granville Street Railway in Ohio, which opened in 1889. In 1924, in Hobart, Australia, sharing of tracks between trams and trains was proposed.

The difference between modern tram-trains and the older interurban and radial railways is that tram-trains are built to meet mainline railway standards, rather than ignoring them. An exception is the United States&#x27; River Line in New Jersey, which runs along freight tracks with time separation; passenger trains run by day, and freight by night.

<text>Robert O&#x27;Brien (April 11, 1908 – February 10, 1987) was a racing driver from the United States. He participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, the 1952 Belgian Grand Prix.

==Career==
O&#x27;Brien was born in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. He mostly raced sports cars in the US, finishing fourth in the 1952 12 Hours of Sebring in a Ferrari 166 MM shared with Richard Cicurel.

He later made a few appearances in Europe through his contacts in Belgium. This included an appearance at the 1952 Belgian Grand Prix driving a Simca-Gordini T15 at Spa-Francorchamps. Qualifying slowest of the 22 entrants, 1 minute 23 seconds slower than the fastest time of Alberto Ascari, O&#x27;Brien circulated at the back and finished 14th of the 15 finishers. He subsequently drove (and retired) the same car in a race at the Grenzlandring in Germany before returning to the US.

O&#x27;Brien is one of the more obscure drivers to have participated in the Formula One World Championship, and unsubstantiated rumours arose that he was involved with the CIA and operated as a spy. He was later involved in the motor industry in his home state and in New York.

O&#x27;Brien died in Hackensack, New Jersey in 1987.

<text>Takachiho &quot;Taki&quot; Inoue (井上 隆智穂 &quot;Inoue Takachiho&quot;, born 5 September 1963) is a Japanese former racing driver.

==Biography==
Inoue was born in Kobe. He competed in the British Formula Ford Championship in 1988, followed by a spell in All-Japan Formula Three from 1989 to 1993 and a season in the International Formula 3000 championship in 1994.

===Formula One===

He participated in 18 Formula One Grand Prix races. His first appearance was a one-off race for Simtek at the 1994 Japanese Grand Prix, from which he retired. For the next year he moved to Footwork Arrows. Over the course of his career he scored no championship points. He is perhaps best remembered for two bizarre incidents while driving for Footwork in 1995. The first occurred after a practice session at Monaco, when his stalled car was being towed back to the pits when it was hit by a course car, driven by Jean Ragnotti, causing it to roll into the barriers, although Inoue was fit to race the next day. The second happened on Hungarian GP on live TV worldwide – attempting to assist the marshals in putting out the engine fire which had forced him out of the race, a safety car Tatra 623 driven to the scene by a marshal hit him, injuring his leg, although he recovered for the next race.
For most of the season his team-mate was Gianni Morbidelli, but late in the season Max Papis replaced Morbidelli, and was sometimes outpaced by Inoue. Entering the season, Inoue lobbied Tyrrell for a drive, but the team chose Ukyo Katayama with his Mild Seven sponsorship money from Japan Tobacco. Instead, he was announced in January to drive for the Minardi team. However, one of his personal sponsors pulled out at the last minute and Inoue withdrew from F1. Minardi took on Giancarlo Fisichella instead. Fisichella, the team&#x27;s test driver in 1995, had backing from Marlboro Italy.

With his sponsorship reduced, Inoue was out of a drive in Formula One. After a brief switch to sportscars, he retired from racing at the end of 1999 and now manages drivers in his own country. He is also known for his self-deprecating humour, as Inoue publicly proclaimed himself as the &quot;worst driver in Formula One&quot;, admitted that he initially had no idea what a pit stop was, and in an interview with the &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine in 2015 stated that he was &quot;not good enough to drive in F1&quot;.

<text>Timothy Andrew Mayer (February 22, 1938 – February 28, 1964) was a racecar driver from Dalton, Pennsylvania in the United States. He participated in one World Championship Formula One Grand Prix, on October 7, 1962. He retired with ignition failure and scored no championship points.

==Career==
Mayer&#x27;s older brother Teddy was one of the founders of the McLaren team, with Bruce McLaren. Both brothers travelled from the United States to Europe in the early 1960s with future Grand Prix winner Peter Revson. The McLaren team&#x27;s first championship series entries were for the 1964 Tasman Series, running Timmy Mayer and team-leader McLaren in custom-built Cooper T70 cars. However, Mayer was killed in practice for the final race of the series, at Longford, Tasmania, when he lost control at over and spun and hit a tree next to the course. His car disintegrated, and wreckage narrowly missed young children who were spectators. Mayer died instantly from the impact. There was a memorial stone placed on the side of the road where Mayer had died, but it was moved, and is now to be seen, with his helmet, at the Country Club Hotel in Longford.

In his eulogy of team mate and friend Tim Mayer, Bruce McLaren wrote:
&quot;The news that he had died instantly was a terrible shock to all of us, but who is to say that he had not seen more, done more and learned more in his few years than many people do in a lifetime? To do something well is so worthwhile that to die trying to do it better cannot be foolhardy. It would be a waste of life to do nothing with one&#x27;s ability, for I feel that life is measured in achievement, not in years alone.&quot;

<doc id="1237469" wikidata="Q172214" url="?curid=1237469" title="Toni Branca">
<text>Antonio Branca (15 September 1916, Sion, Switzerland – 10 May 1985, Sierre, Switzerland) was a Formula One racing car driver from Switzerland who competed in three World Championship races. His motor racing career was allegedly financed by an admiring Belgian countess, the Vicomtesse de Walkiers. Branca mainly competed in privately owned Maserati 4CLT, in Formula One and Two races.

Branca made his Formula One debut at the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix, finishing 11th, and briefly led the non-championship Formula One race in Circuit des Nations at Geneva in a Simca-Gordini. He scored a number of top-six placings in other minor races, his best finish being fourth at a Formula Two race at the Aix les Bains Circuit du Lac, before entering the and finishing in 10th place. Branca continued to race in 1951, retiring from the Formula One and finishing sixth in the non-championship Pescara Grand Prix, but finished competing in Grand Prix racing at the end of the year.

Branca competed at a lower level until the mid-1950s, racing in hillclimbs and competed twice in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Racing with a Moretti 750cc, in 1955 the car was not ready and did not get to the starting line in time, and in 1956 the car broke down before his turn to drive.

<doc id="1237471" wikidata="Q41926" url="?curid=1237471" title=".la">
<text>.la is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Laos.

Although the .la domain is officially assigned to the country of Laos, subdomains have been delegated to some organizations outside Laos.

==History==
The LA Names Corporation, based in Guernsey, has gained the rights to market .la registrations, and they had used the registry services of Afilias and, formerly, the registrar services of DreamHost. However, DreamHost has discontinued .la registrar services . LA Names and CentralNic, Ltd. completed the transfer of the .la domain name to the CentralNic system in 2007. Cabel Sasser of Panic created &quot;Poopla&quot; (xn--ls8h.la), &quot;The World&#x27;s First Emoji Domain&quot; on April 13, 2011. A company based in of Hong Kong by the name of Sterling Holdings originally purchased the TLD from Laos, and marketed it towards users in Louisiana and Los Angeles.

==Popular use==

The domain is used by organizations in the state of Louisiana (whose postal abbreviation is LA) and the city of Los Angeles. No official or unofficial association exists between the .la domain and any government in the United States (see .gov and .org). It also sees limited use for businesses in Latin America, such as Intel&#x27;s site for the region.

The .la domain is also used for domain hacks in the French language and the Chinese language. &quot;&quot; means &quot;there&quot; in French and in Italian, and in other Romance languages; &quot;&quot; () is a common modal word at the end of a sentence or a phrase in Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese.

Mozilla Foundation&#x27;s URL shortener uses it with the &quot;mzl.la&quot; domain hack.

Tesla Motors uses &quot;ts.la&quot; domain hack as a shortener and a redirect.

Digikala, an e-commerce startup in Iran and the Middle East uses the &quot;dgka.la&quot; domain hack as a shortener.

The Network information center of .la is oriented to pages based in Los Angeles.

The Digital Public Library of America uses dp.la.

==Lao language domain==

In 2008 a preliminary application was made to open the internationalized top level domain (the name of Laos in the Lao language). In 2019 this top level domain was approved. Web sites will come at a later stage. It is intended for usage with domain names in Lao script.

<text>Abraham Goldfaden (; born Avrum Goldnfoden; 24 July 1840 – 9 January 1908), also known as Avram Goldfaden, was a Russian-born Jewish poet, playwright, stage director and actor in Yiddish and Hebrew languages and author of some 40 plays. Goldfaden is considered the father of modern Jewish theatre.

In 1876 he founded in the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia what is generally credited as the world&#x27;s first professional Yiddish-language theatre troupe. He was also responsible for the first Hebrew-language play performed in the United States. The Avram Goldfaden Festival of Iaşi, Romania, is named after him and held in his honour.

Jacob Sternberg called him &quot;the Prince Charming who woke up the lethargic Romanian Jewish culture&quot;. Israil Bercovici wrote of his works: &quot;we find points in common with what we now call &#x27;total theatre&#x27;. In many of his plays he alternates prose and verse, pantomime and dance, moments of acrobatics and some of &quot;jonglerie&quot;, and even of spiritualism...&quot;

== Early life ==
Goldfaden was born in Starokonstantinov (Russian Empire; present day Ukraine). His birth date is sometimes given as 12 July, following the &quot;Old Style&quot; calendar in use at that time in the Russian Empire. He attended a Jewish religious school (a &quot;cheder&quot;), but his middle-class family was strongly associated with the &quot;Haskalah&quot;, or Jewish Enlightenment, and his father, a watchmaker, arranged that he receive private lessons in German and Russian. As a child, he is said to have appreciated and imitated the performances of wedding jesters and Brody singers to the degree that he acquired the nickname &quot;Avromele Badkhen,&quot; &quot;Abie the Jester.&quot; In 1857 he began studies at the government-run rabbinical school at Zhytomyr, from which he emerged in 1866 as a teacher and a poet (with some experience in amateur theatre), but he never led a congregation.

Goldfaden&#x27;s first published poem was called &quot;Progress&quot;; his &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary described it as &quot;a plea for Zionism years before that movement developed&quot;. In 1865 he published his first book of poetry, &quot;Tzitzim u-Ferahim&quot; (in Hebrew); The &quot;Jewish Encyclopaedia&quot; (1901–1906) says that &quot;Goldfaden&#x27;s Hebrew poetry ... possesses considerable merit, but it has been eclipsed by his Yiddish poetry, which, for strength of expression and for depth of true Jewish feeling, remains unrivalled&quot;. The first book of verse in Yiddish was published in 1866, and in 1867 he took a job teaching in Simferopol on the Crimean Peninsula.

A year later, he moved on to Odessa. He lived initially in his uncle&#x27;s house, where a cousin who was a good pianist helped him set some of his poems to music. In Odessa, Goldfaden renewed his acquaintance with fellow Yiddish-language writer Yitzkhok Yoel Linetzky, whom he knew from Zhytomyr and met Hebrew-language poet Eliahu Mordechai Werbel (whose daughter Paulina would become Goldfaden&#x27;s wife) and published poems in the newspaper &quot;Kol-Mevaser&quot;. He also wrote his first two plays, &quot;Die Tzwei Sheines&quot; (&quot;The Two Neighbours&quot;) and &quot;Die Murneh Sosfeh&quot; (&quot;Aunt Susie&quot;), included with some verses in a modestly successful 1869 book &quot;Die Yidene&quot; (&quot;The Jewish Woman&quot;), which went through three editions in three years. At this time, he and Paulina were living mainly on his meagre teacher&#x27;s salary of 18 rubles a year, supplemented by his giving private lessons and taking a job as a cashier in a hat shop.

In 1875, Goldfaden headed for Munich, intending to study medicine. This did not work out, and he headed for Lvov/Lemberg in Habsburg-ruled Galicia, where he again met up with Linetsky, now editor of a weekly paper, &quot;Isrulik&quot; or &quot;Der Alter Yisrulik&quot; (which was well reputed, but was soon shut by the government). A year later, he moved on to Chernivtsi in Habsburg Bukovina, where he edited the Yiddish-language daily &quot;Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt&quot;. The limits of the economic sense of this enterprise can be gauged from his inability to pay a registration fee of 3000 ducats. He tried unsuccessfully to operate the paper under a different name, but soon moved on to Iaşi in Moldavia on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850–1930), a young wealthy community activist interested in theatre.

== Iaşi ==

Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was fortunate to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu&#x27;s wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was just a way to starve and suggested that there would be a lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theatre. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde (&quot;the Green Fruit-Tree Garden&quot;).

Instead of a simple recital, Goldfaden expanded the program into something of a vaudeville performance; either this or an indoor performance he and his fellow performers gave later that year in Botoşani is generally counted as the first professional Yiddish theatre performance. However, in the circumstances, the designation of a single performance as &quot;the first&quot; may be nominal: Goldfaden&#x27;s first actor, Israel Grodner, was already singing Goldfaden&#x27;s songs (and others) in the salons of Iaşi. Also, in 1873, Grodner sang in a concert in Odessa (songs by Goldfaden, among others) that apparently included significant improvised material between songs, although no actual script.

Although Goldfaden, by his own account, was familiar at this time with &quot;practically all of Russian literature&quot;, and also had plenty of exposure to Polish theatre, and had even seen an African American tragedian, Ira Aldridge, performing Shakespeare, the performance at Grădina Pomul Verde was only a bit more of a play than Grodner had participated in three years earlier. The songs were strung together with a bit of character and plot and a good bit of improvisation. The performance by Goldfaden, Grodner, Sokher Goldstein, and possibly as many as three other men went over well. The first performance was either &quot;Di bobe mitn einikl&quot; (&quot;Grandmother and Granddaughter&quot;) or &quot;Dos bintl holts&quot; (&quot;The Bundle of sticks&quot;); sources disagree. (Some reports suggest that Goldfaden himself was a poor singer, or even a non-singer and poor actor; according to Bercovici, these reports stem from Goldfaden&#x27;s own self-disparaging remarks or from his countenance as an old man in New York, but contemporary reports show him to have been a decent, though not earth-shattering, actor and singer.)

After that time, Goldfaden continued miscellaneous newspaper work, but the stage became his main focus.

Later that summer, the famous Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu, then a journalist, saw one of the Pomul Verde performances. He recorded in his review that the company had six players. (A 1905 typographical error would turn this into a much-cited sixteen, suggesting a grander beginning for Yiddish theatre.) He was impressed by the quality of the singing and acting, but found the pieces &quot;without much dramatic interest. His generally positive comments would seem to deserve to be taken seriously: Eminescu was known generally as &quot;virulently antisemitic.&quot; Eminescu appears to have seen four of Goldfaden&#x27;s early plays: a satiric musical revue &quot;Di velt a gan-edn&quot; (&quot;The World and Paradise&quot;), &quot;Der farlibter maskil un der oyfgeklerter hosid&quot; (a dialogue between &quot;an infatuated philosopher&quot; and &quot;an enlightened Hasid&quot;), another musical revue &quot;Der shver mitn eidem&quot; (&quot;Father-in-law and Son-in-Law&quot;), and a comedy, &quot;Fishl der balegole un zayn knecht Sider&quot; (&quot;Fishel the Carter and His Servant Sider&quot;).

== Searching for a theatre ==
As the season for outdoor performances was coming to a close, Goldfaden tried and failed to rent an appropriate theatre in Iaşi. A theatre owner named Reicher, presumably Jewish himself, told him that &quot;a troupe of Jewish singers&quot; would be &quot;too dirty.&quot; Goldfaden, Grodner, and Goldstein headed first to Botoşani, where they lived in a garret and Goldfaden continued to churn out songs and plays. An initial successful performance of &quot;Di Rekruten&quot; (&quot;The Recruits&quot;) in an indoor theatre (&quot;with loges!&quot; as Goldfaden wrote) was followed by days of rain so torrential that no one would come out to the theatre; they pawned some possessions and left for Galaţi, which was to prove a bit more auspicious, with a successful three-week run.

In Galaţi they acquired their first serious set designer, a housepainter known as Reb Moishe Bas. He had no formal artistic training, but he proved to be good at the job, and joined the troupe, as did Sara Segal, their first actress. She was not yet out of her teens. After seeing her perform in their Galaţi premiere, her mother objected to her unmarried daughter cavorting on a stage. Goldstein – who, unlike Goldfaden and Grodner, was single – promptly married her and she remained with the troupe. (Besides being known as Sara Segal and Sofia Goldstein, she became best known as Sofia Karp, after a second marriage to actor Max Karp.)

After the successful run in Galaţi came a less successful attempt in Brăila, but by now the company had honed its act and it was time to go to the capital, Bucharest.

== Bucharest ==
As in Iași, Goldfaden arrived in Bucharest with his reputation already established. He and his players performed first in the early spring at the salon Lazăr Cafegiu on Calea Văcărești (Văcărești Avenue, in the heart of the Jewish quarter), then, once the weather turned warm, at the Jignița garden, a pleasant tree-shaded beer garden on Str. Negru Vodă that up until then had drawn only a neighbourhood crowd. He filled out his cast from the great pool of Jewish vocal talent: synagogue cantors. He also recruited two eminently respectable classically trained prima donnas, the sisters Margaretta and Annetta Schwartz.

Among the cantors in his casts that year were Lazăr Zuckermann (also known as Laiser Zuckerman; as a song-and-dance man, he would eventually follow Goldfaden to New York and have a long stage career), Moishe Zilberman (also known as Silberman), and Simhe Dinman, as well as the 18-year-old Zigmund Mogulescu (Sigmund Mogulesko), who soon became a stage star. Orphaned by the time he reached his teen years, Mogulescu had already made his way in the world as a singer – not only as a soloist in the Great Synagogue of Bucharest but also as a performer in cafes, at parties, with a visiting French operetta company, and even in a church choir. Before his voice changed, he had sung with Zuckerman, Dinman, and Moses Wald in the &quot;Israelite Chorus&quot;, performing at important ceremonies in the Jewish community. Mogulescu&#x27;s audition for Goldfaden was a scene from &quot;Vlăduţu Mamei&quot; (&quot;Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot;), which formed the basis later that year for Goldfaden&#x27;s light comedy &quot;Shmendrik, oder Die Komishe Chaseneh&quot; (&quot;Shmendrik or The Comical Wedding&quot;), starring Mogulescu as the almost painfully clueless and hapless young man (a role later famously played in New York and elsewhere by actress Molly Picon).

This recruiting of cantors was not without controversy: Cantor Cuper (also known as Kupfer), the head cantor of the Great Synagogue, considered it &quot;impious&quot; that cantors should perform in a secular setting, to crowds where both sexes mingled freely, keeping people up late so that they might not be on time for morning prayers.

While one may argue over which performance &quot;started&quot; Yiddish theatre, by the end of that summer in Bucharest Yiddish theatre was an established fact. The influx of Jewish merchants and middlemen to the city at the start of the Russo-Turkish War had greatly expanded the audience; among these new arrivals were Israel Rosenberg and Jacob Spivakovsky, the highly cultured scion of a wealthy Russian Jewish family, both of whom actually joined Goldfaden&#x27;s troupe, but soon left to found the first Yiddish theatre troupe in Imperial Russia.

Goldfaden was churning out a repertoire – new songs, new plays and translations of plays from Romanian, French, and other languages (in the first two years, he wrote 22 plays, and would eventually write about 40) – and while he was not always able to retain the players in his company once they became stars in their own right, he continued for many years to recruit first-rate talent, and his company became a &quot;de facto&quot; training ground for Yiddish theatre. By the end of the year, others were writing Yiddish plays as well, such as Moses Horowitz with &quot;Der tiranisher bankir&quot; (&quot;The Tyrannical Banker&quot;), or Grodner with &quot;Curve un ganev&quot; (&quot;Prostitute and Thief&quot;), and Yiddish theatre had become big theatre, with elaborate sets, duelling choruses, and extras to fill out crowd scenes.

Goldfaden was helped by Ion Ghica, then head of the Romanian National Theatre to legally establish a &quot;dramatic society&quot; to handle administrative matters. From those papers, it is known that the troupe at the Jigniţa included Moris Teich, Michel Liechman (Glückman), Lazăr Zuckermann, Margareta Schwartz, Sofia Palandi, Aba Goldstein, and Clara Goldstein. We also know from similar papers that when Grodner and Mogulescu walked out on Goldfaden to start their own company, it included (besides themselves) Israel Rosenberg, Jacob Spivakovsky, P. Şapira, M. Banderevsky, Anetta Grodner, and Rosa Friedman.

Ion Ghica was a valuable ally for Yiddish theatre in Bucharest. On several occasions he expressed his favourable view of the quality of the acting, and even more of the technical aspects of the Yiddish theatre. In 1881, he obtained for the National Theatre the costumes that had been used for a Yiddish pageant on the coronation of King Solomon, which had been timed in tribute to the actual coronation of Carol I of Romania.

== Turning serious ==
While light comedy and satire might have established Yiddish theatre as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden&#x27;s higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as &quot;the Yiddish Shakespeare.&quot; As a man broadly read in several languages, he was acutely aware that there was no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature – that his audience was used to seeking just &quot;a good glass of Odobeşti and a song.&quot; Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatregoer of the time as saying to him: &quot;We don&#x27;t go to the theatre to make our head swim with sad things. We have enough troubles at home... we go to the theatre to cheer ourselves up. We pay up a coin and hope to be distracted, we want to laugh from the heart.&quot;

Goldfaden wrote that this attitude put him &quot;pure and simply at war with the public.&quot; His stage was not to be merely &quot;a masquerade&quot;; he continued: &quot;No, brothers. If I have arrived at having a stage, I want it to be a school for you. In youth you didn&#x27;t have time to learn and cultivate yourself... Laugh heartily if I amuse you with my jokes, while I, watching you, feel my heart crying. Then, brothers, I&#x27;ll give you a drama, a tragedy drawn from life, and you, too, shall cry – while my heart shall be glad.&quot; Nonetheless, his &quot;war with the public&quot; was based on understanding that public. He would also write, &quot;I wrote &quot;Di kishefmakhern&quot; (&quot;The Witch&quot;) in Romania, where the populace – Jews as much as Romanians – believe strongly in witches.&quot; Local superstitions and concerns always made good subject matter, and, as Bercovici remarks, however strong his inspirational and didactic intent, his historical pieces were always connected to contemporary concerns.

Even in the first couple of years of his company, Goldfaden did not shy away from serious themes: his rained-out vaudeville in Botoşani had been &quot;Di Rekruten&quot; (&quot;The Recruits&quot;), playing with the theme of the press gangs working the streets of that town to conscript young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated &quot;Desolate Island&quot; by August von Kotzebue; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although &quot;Shmendrik&quot; and &quot;The Two Kuni-Lemls&quot; were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious Yiddish-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being &quot;Shulamith&quot;, also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. Nahma Sandrow suggests that it may have had equally as much to do with the arrival in Romania, at the time of the Russo-Turkish War, of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated Russian language theatre. Goldfaden&#x27;s strong turn toward almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to Odessa.

Goldfaden was both a theoretician and a practitioner of theatre. That he was in no small measure a theoretician – for example, he was interested almost from the start in having set design seriously support the themes of his plays – relates to a key property of Yiddish theatre at the time of its birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of the Jewish community, Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theatre in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden&#x27;s company – Iaşi, Botoşani, Galaţi, Brăila, Bucharest – could as easily have been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. Yiddish theatre may have been seen from the outset as an expression of a Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden&#x27;s company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theatre of the time. Also, Yiddish was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in Moldavia (and Transylvania), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about Yiddish theatre was Romania&#x27;s national poet, Mihai Eminescu, is testimony that interest in Yiddish theatre went beyond the Jewish community.

Almost from the first, Yiddish theatre drew a level of theatre criticism comparable to any other European theatre of its time. For example, Bercovici cites a &quot;brochure&quot; by one G. Abramski, published in 1877, that described and gave critiques of all of Goldfaden&#x27;s plays of that year. Abramski speculated that the present day might be for Yiddish theatre a moment comparable to the Elizabethan era for English theatre. He discussed what a Yiddish theatre ought to be, noted its many sources (ranging from Purim plays to circus pantomime), and praised its incorporation of strong female roles. He also criticized where he saw weaknesses, noting how unconvincingly a male actor played the mother in &quot;Shmendrik&quot;, or remarking of the play &quot;Di shtume kale&quot; (&quot;The Mute Bride&quot;) — a work that Goldfaden apparently wrote to accommodate a pretty, young actress who in the performance was too nervous to deliver her lines — that the only evidence of Goldfaden&#x27;s authorship was his name.

== Russia ==
Goldfaden&#x27;s father wrote him to solicit the troupe to come to Odessa in Ukraine, which was then part of Imperial Russia. The timing was opportune: the end of the war meant that much of his best audience were now in Odessa rather than Bucharest; Rosenberg had already quit Goldfaden&#x27;s troupe and was performing the Goldfadenian repertoire in Odessa.

With a loan from Librescu, Goldfaden headed east with a group of 42 people, including performers, musicians, and their families. After the end of the Russo-Turkish War he and his troupe travelled extensively through Imperial Russia, notably to Kharkov (also in Ukraine), Moscow, and Saint Petersburg. Jacob Adler later described him at this time as &quot;a &quot;bon vivant&quot;,&quot; &quot;a cavalier,&quot; &quot;as difficult to approach as an emperor.&quot; He continued to turn out plays at a prolific pace, now mostly serious pieces such as &quot;Doctor Almasada, oder Die Yiden in Palermo&quot; (&quot;Doctor Almasada, or The Jews of Palermo&quot;), &quot;Shulamith&quot;, and &quot;Bar Kokhba&quot;, the last being a rather dark operetta about Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt, written after the pogroms in Russia following the 1881 assassination of Czar Alexander II.

A Frenchman named Victor Tissot happened to be in Berdichev when Goldfaden&#x27;s company was there. He saw two plays – &quot;Di Rekruten&quot;, first premiered in Botoşani, and the later &quot;Di Shvebleh&quot; (&quot;Matches&quot;), a play of intrigue. Tissot&#x27;s account of what he saw gives an interesting picture of the theatres and audiences Goldfaden&#x27;s troupe encountered outside of the big cities. &quot;Berdichev,&quot; he begins, &quot;has not one cafe, not one restaurant. Berdichev, which is a boring and sad city, nonetheless has a theatrical hall, a big building made of rough boards, where theatre troupes passing through now and then put on a play.&quot; Although there was a proper stage with a curtain, the cheap seats were bare benches, the more expensive ones were benches covered in red percale. Although there were many full beards, &quot;there were no long caftans, no skullcaps.&quot; Some of the audience were quite poor, but these were assimilated Jews, basically secular. The audience also included Russian officers with their wives or girlfriends.

In Russia, Goldfaden and his troupe drew large audiences and were generally popular with progressive Jewish intellectuals, but slowly ran afoul of both the Czarist government and conservative elements in the Jewish community. Goldfaden was calling for change in the Jewish world:

: &quot;Wake up my people&quot;
: &quot;From your sleep, wake up&quot;
: &quot;And believe no more in foolishness.&quot;

A call like this might be a bit ambiguous, but it was unsettling to those who were on the side of the status quo. Yiddish theatre was banned in Russia starting September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.

== The prophet adrift ==
While Yiddish theatre continued successfully in various places, Goldfaden was not on the best terms at this time with Mogulescu. They had quarrelled (and settled) several times over rights to plays, and Mogulescu and his partner Moishe &quot;Maurice&quot; Finkel now dominated Yiddish theatre in Romania, with about ten lesser companies competing as well. Mogulescu was a towering figure in Bucharest theatre at this point, lauded on a level comparable to the actors of the National theatre, performing at times in Romanian as well as Yiddish, drawing an audience that went well beyond the Jewish community.

Goldfaden seems, in Bercovici&#x27;s words, to have lost &quot;his theatrical elan&quot; in this period. He briefly put together a theatre company in 1886 in Warsaw, with no notable success. In 1887 he went to New York (as did Mogulescu, independently). After extensive negotiations and great anticipation in the Yiddish-language press in New York (&quot;Goldfaden in America,&quot; read the headline in the 11 January 1888 edition of the &quot;New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung&quot;), he briefly took on the job of director of Mogulescu&#x27;s new &quot;Rumanian Opera House&quot;; they parted ways again after the failure of their first play, whose production values were apparently not up to New York standards. Goldfaden attempted (unsuccessfully) to found a theatre school, then headed in 1889 for Paris, rather low on funds. There he wrote some poetry, worked on a play that he didn&#x27;t finish at that time, and put together a theatre company that never got to the point of putting on a play (because the cashier made off with all of their funds). In October 1889 he scraped together the money to get to Lvov, where his reputation as a poet again came to his rescue.

== Lviv ==
Lviv was not exactly a dramatist&#x27;s dream. Leon Dreykurs described audiences bringing meals into the theatre, rustling paper, treating the theatre like a beer garden. He also quotes Jacob Schatzky: &quot;All in all, the Galician milieu was not favourable to Yiddish theatre. The intellectuals were assimilated, but the masses were fanatically religious and they viewed Jewish &#x27;comedians&#x27; with disdain.&quot;

Nonetheless, Iacob Ber Ghimpel, who owned a Yiddish theatre there, was glad to have a figure of Goldfaden&#x27;s stature. Goldfaden completed the play he&#x27;d started in Paris, &quot;Rabi Yoselman, oder Die Gzerot fun Alsas&quot; (&quot;Rabbi Yoselman, or The Alsatian Decree&quot;), in five acts and 23 scenes, based on the life of Josel of Rosheim. At this time he also wrote an operetta &quot;Rothschild&quot; and a semi-autobiographical play called &quot;Mashiach Tzeiten&quot; (&quot;Messiah Times&quot;) that gave a less-than-optimistic view of America.

Kalman Juvelier, an actor in Ber Ghimpel&#x27;s company, credited Goldfaden with greatly strengthening the calibre of performance in Lviv during his brief time there, reporting that Goldfaden worked with every actor on understanding his or her character, so as to ensure that the play was more than just a series of songs and effects, and was respected by all.

== Bucharest ==

Buoyed by his success in Lvov, he returned to Bucharest in 1892, as director of the Jigniţa theatre. His new company again included Lazăr Zuckermann; other players were Marcu (Mordechai) Segalescu, and later Iacob Kalich, Carol Schramek, Malvina Treitler-Löbel and her father H. Goldenbers. Among his notable plays from this period were &quot;Dos zenteh Gebot, oder Lo tachmod&quot; (&quot;The Tenth Commandment, or Thou Shalt Not Covet&quot;), &quot;Judas Maccabaeus&quot;, and &quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot; and a translation of Johann Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Gypsy Baron&quot;.

However, it was not a propitious time to return to Romania. Yiddish theatre had become a business there, with slickly written advertisements, coordinated performances in multiple cities using the same publicity materials, and cut-throat competition: on one occasion in 1895, a young man named Bernfeld attended multiple performances of Goldfaden&#x27;s &quot;Story of Isaac&quot;, memorised it all (including the songs), and took the whole package to Kalman Juvilier, who put on an unauthorised production in Iaşi. Such outright theft was possible because once Ion Ghica headed off on a diplomatic career, the National theatre, which was supposed to adjudicate issues like unauthorised performances of plays, was no longer paying much attention to Yiddish theatre. (Juvilier and Goldfaden finally reached an out-of-court settlement.)

Cutthroat competition was nothing to what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and a rising tide of anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in politics than in theatre: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting &quot;Der Veker&quot; (&quot;The Awakener&quot;).

Goldfaden left Romania in 1896; soon Juvilier&#x27;s was the only active Yiddish theatre troupe in the country, and foreign troupes had almost entirely ceased coming to the country. Although Lateiner, Horowitz, and Shumer kept writing, and occasionally managed to put on a play, it was not a good time for Yiddish theatre – or any theatre – in Romania, and would only become worse as the economy continued to decline.

Goldfaden wandered Europe as a poet and journalist. His plays continued to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he was running out of money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorising him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.

== New York City ==

In America, he again tried his hand at journalism, but a brief stint as editor of the &quot;New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung&quot; resulted only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met a group of young people who had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play &quot;David ba-Milchama&quot; (&quot;David in the War&quot;), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.

He also wrote the spoken portions of &quot;Ben Ami&quot;, loosely based on George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot;. After Goldfaden&#x27;s former bit player Jacob Adler—by now the owner of a prominent New York Yiddish theatre—optioned and ignored it, even accusing Goldfaden of being &quot;senile&quot;, it premiered successfully at rival Boris Thomashefsky&#x27;s People&#x27;s theatre December 25, 1907, with music by H. Friedzel and lyrics by Mogulescu, who was by this time an international star.

Goldfaden died in New York City in 1908. A contemporary account in &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated that 75,000 people turned out for his funeral, joining the procession from the People&#x27;s theatre on Bowery to Washington Cemetery in Brooklyn; in recent scholarship the number of mourners has been given as 30,000. In a follow-up article &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;both a poet and a prophet&quot;, and noted that &quot;there was more evidence of genuine sympathy with and admiration for the man and his work than is likely to be manifested at the funeral of any poet now writing in the English language in this country.&quot;

In November 2009, Goldfaden was the subject of postage stamps issued jointly by Israel and Romania.

== Zionism ==
Goldfaden had an on-again off-again relationship with Zionism. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist &quot;avant la lettre&quot; and one of his last plays was written in Hebrew; several of his plays were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (&quot;Shulamith&quot; set in Jerusalem, &quot;Mashiach Tzeiten?!&quot; ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for Palestine); he served as a delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900. Still, he spent most of his life (and set slightly more than half of his plays) in the Pale of Settlement and in the adjoining Jewish areas in Romania, and when he left it was never to go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.

<text>.lb is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Lebanon.

== History ==
The Lebanese Domain Registry (LBDR) was established in 1993. It offered domains free of charge directly to registrants, without the use of a registrar model. Since 1 February 2021, they introduced a registrar model and registrants can&#x27;t directly register their domains at the registry anymore. At the same time the registry also introduced a yearly fee for domains and removed the trademark requirement for registrants. On 13 July 2023, ICANN took over the registry management of .lb in a caretaker role due to the death of the registry manager. On 21 January 2024, ICANN approved the transfer of .lb to the new registry Internet Society Lebanon.

== Second-level domains ==

* com.lb – commercial
* edu.lb – educational
* gov.lb – government
* net.lb – network infrastructure
* org.lb – organizations

<text>.lc is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Saint Lucia, sponsored by the University of Puerto Rico and created on September 3, 1991. The registry is operated by Afilias and markets towards companies structured as LCs, LLCs or PLCs due to the possibility of a domain hack, such as CompanyName.L.LC (companyname.l.lc uses the open SLD l.lc) and supposedly better names.

== Second and third level domains ==
Registrations take place directly at the second level or at one of the following third level domains. There are a number of registrars, but .gov.lc and .edu.lc can only be registered at the NIC.
* .co.lc
* .com.lc
* .org.lc (local non-profit organizations get this domain free of charge)
* .net.lc
* .l.lc (domain hack for LLCs)
* .p.lc (domain hack for PLCs)
* .gov.lc (restricted to government departments, agencies, ministries, etc.)
* .edu.lc (restricted to educational institutions)

== Rules ==
All domains must be between 1 and 63 characters long, excluding the TLD. In addition, domains may not contain anything other than letters, numbers, and a hyphen. .lc does not support internationalized domain names, and domain names may not start or end with a hyphen. Domain names considered offensive by the registry may not be registered.

<text>.lk is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Sri Lanka. Foreign companies who do not have a local presence can only reserve their top-level and corresponding open second-level domains (either through the LK Domain Registry or agents). In order to register and use a name they must have a contact address in Sri Lanka (which may be obtained through an agent or law firm).

== Second-level domains==

Registrations are taken at the second level and also at the third level beneath various categorized second level names. A second-level registration automatically blocks the name from registration by anybody else under any of the third-level names.

These second-level names are available for registrations within them:

Restricted registration:
* .gov.lk: Governmental departments of Sri Lanka (automatically reserves name at second level and under all other second level names)
* .ac.lk: Research and higher education institutions in Sri Lanka
* .sch.lk: Registered schools in Sri Lanka
* .net.lk: Licensed internet service providers in Sri Lanka
* .int.lk: International treaty organizations

Open registration:
* .com.lk: Commercial entities
* .org.lk: Noncommercial organizations
* .edu.lk: Educational sites
* .ngo.lk: Non-governmental organizations
* .soc.lk: Registered societies
* .web.lk: Web sites
* .ltd.lk: Limited liability companies
* .assn.lk: Associations
* .grp.lk: Groups of companies
* .hotel.lk: Hotels

==Internationalized top-level domains==


In September 2010 two new internationalized top-level domains were registered for Sri Lanka. They became active during 2011.
* .ලංකා (for domain names in the Sinhala language)
* .இலங்கை (for domain names in the Tamil language)

<text>John Malcolm Taylor (23 March 1933 – 8 September 1966) was a racing driver from England. He participated in five World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, and also participated in several non-championship Formula One races. His Formula One debut was on 11 July 1964, at the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch driving the Formula One/Formula Two hybrid Cooper–Ford T71/T73. He finished fourteenth, 24 laps down, after an extended pit–stop due to a gearbox problem. Taylor did not compete in the Formula One World Championship in 1965, but continued to drive in non–championship races. He returned to Grand Prix racing in 1966, driving a two-litre Brabham–BRM for privateer David Bridges. His first race that season was the French Grand Prix at Reims, where he scored his one championship point. There followed eighth places at both the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch and the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.

Taylor died following a crash during the 1966 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, when his Brabham collided with Jacky Ickx&#x27;s F2 Matra on the first lap of the race. He emerged from the wreckage badly burned, and died from his injuries four weeks later.

<doc id="1237502" wikidata="Q3366265" url="?curid=1237502" title="Arab Socialist Action Party – Arabian Peninsula">
<text>The Arab Socialist Action Party – Arabian Peninsula ( &quot;Ḥizb al`Amal al Ishtirākiy al-`Arabiy-Al-Jazīra al`Arabiyyah&quot;), was an underground oppositional political party in Saudi Arabia. It was founded in 1972 by elements of the erstwhile Arab Nationalist Movement.

==Profile of the party==
The party was able to attract a following amongst intellectuals and middle class elements, and became a prominent force of the secular opposition. Ideologically it adhered to Marxism and Arab nationalism. It considered armed struggle as the only option to overthrow the ruling system of Saudi Arabia. The membership was predominantly Shi&#x27;ite.

The party was able to attract former members from the People&#x27;s Democratic Party, which ceased to function in the mid-1970s.

The party raised three main demands, introduction of political liberties, nationalization of oil resources, and the end to foreign military presence in Saudi Arabia. It also opposed discrimination against Shi&#x27;ites.

==Press==
The party published &quot;al-Masira&quot; as its central organ. It was printed inside Saudi Arabia clandestinely on an irregular basis. Moreover, until the 1982 crackdown, the cadres of the party were well represented amongst the staff of the legal newspaper &quot;al-Yaum&quot; (اليوم).

==Relations with PFLP==
The party was a section of the Arab Socialist Action Party, a Pan-Arab party led by the PFLP general secretary Dr George Habash. But unlike other sections of the Arab Socialist Action Party, the linkage to PFLP was weaker due to the lack of a strong PFLP presence in Saudi Arabia. By 1975, the linkage between the Saudi party and PFLP began to decline and in 1978 the Saudi party broke its affiliation with PFLP. Instead the party began orientating itself towards cooperation with other groups in the region. In 1981, the party established relations with the Communist Party in Saudi Arabia and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Bahrain in exile.

==Mecca Siege of 1979==
Five days after Islamic insurgents had seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca on 20 November 1979, the party issued a statement in Beirut, clarifying the demands of the insurgents. The party, however, denied any involvement in the act.

==1982 crackdown==
In April 1982 the party was dealt a severe blow, as Saudi state forces arrested hundreds of its members. Many of the arrested were journalists connected to the &quot;al-Yaum&quot; newspaper. In the end of 1982 an amnesty was declared for the arrested. However, several of the released had problems returning to government services or were denied travel abroad. &quot;Al-Yaum&quot; was closed down. Following the 1982 crackdown, the party critically reviewed its past performance. In January 1984 a provisional leadership was reconstituted.

By 1987 there were reports that the party had begun to reconstruct its organizational structure.

==Amnesty and dismantling==
In the 1990s, the party agreed with the government to disband, in exchange for amnesty of political prisoners. Five jailed party members were pardoned in April 1990. A group of militants of the party were pardoned on Eid-ul-Adha 1991.

<text>.ls is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Lesotho.

==Second-level domains==

Registration to .ls domains are provided through accredited registrars. 

There are also registrations on third level as shown below.

==History==

The .ls domain was established and first delegated on 13 January 1993, with the National University of Lesotho as the sponsoring authority. Initially, Rhodes University acted as the registry and hosted the primary name server, a situation that continued until September 2012.

In April 2012, the sponsoring authority changed from the National University of Lesotho to the Lesotho Communications Authority, the national communications regulator, in line with the newly promulgated Communications Act (No. 4 of 2012). In January 2016, a non-profit company, the Lesotho Network Information Centre (LsNIC) was established to take over registry operations. Re-delegation of the zone was completed by IANA in March 2017.

<text>Polymers and plastics known as polymer substrates are used for banknotes and other everyday products. The banknote is more durable than paper, won&#x27;t become soaked in liquids and is harder to counterfeit, though not impossible. Countries whose whole banknote production is in polymer are: Australia, Romania, Vietnam, United Kingdom and New Zealand. Other countries that have partial polymer and paper issue include Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Mexico, Zambia, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, Nigeria, Chile, and Nepal. The material is also used in commemorative notes in some other countries. The process of polymer substrate creation was developed by the Australia CSIRO.
Countries like Bulgaria have issued a combination of paper and polymer as the 200 Lev banknote.

<doc id="1237510" wikidata="Q16343677" url="?curid=1237510" title="King Street, Newtown, Sydney">
<text>King Street is the central thoroughfare of the suburb of Newtown in Sydney, Australia. The residents of the area, including a higher-than-average concentration of students, LGBT people and artists, are most visible on this street, sealing Newtown&#x27;s reputation as Sydney&#x27;s premier hub of subcultures. The street can be divided geographically into two sections, North and South. King Street is particularly notable for the many picturesque Victorian era and Edwardian era commercial buildings that line the street.

King Street forms part of the Princes Highway officially and is allocated route A36.

==History==
Like Parramatta Road, King Street is believed to follow the line of ancient Aboriginal track that led from the Sydney Cove area south-west across to Botany Bay. Prior to European settlement, the local Aboriginal population kept the Sydney area well cleared with regular low-level fires. Colonial officer Watkin Tench recorded that during the early years of the colony, the area beyond the settlement was, in effect, open parkland, and that it was possible to walk easily across country from Sydney Cove to Botany Bay.

From the late 19th century onwards, King Street developed into a thriving retail precinct. After its initial prosperity, it became run down for much of the 20th century, when Newtown was a low-income blue-collar suburb, often denigrated as a slum; at the crucial time when Victorian era buildings were being demolished elsewhere, Newtown was too unfashionable to make development profitable. By this sheer luck, King Street, as a whole, is the best-preserved Victorian era high street in Sydney, and despite gentrification since the late 20th century, development controls ensure that this will not change. 

King Street was served by a busy tramway until the system&#x27;s closure in 1957 . The buildings are still predominantly late Victorian, to early Federation, although there are some art deco buildings as well.

==North King Street==
North King Street, running east-north-east to west-south-west from the University of Sydney (where it joins with City Road) to Newtown railway station at the junction with Enmore Road, is a very busy thoroughfare, with heavy vehicular and pedestrian traffic the rule rather than the exception. This is the stretch that most people associate with King Street, featuring a profusion of restaurants, cafés and pubs, alongside bookshops, fashion stores and homeware retailers.

==South King Street==

South King Street, often known as &quot;the Paris end&quot;, running southwards from Newtown railway station to St Peters railway station, is by contrast the down-market section, with slightly less traffic. Businesses that have been established in this stretch of King Street include cafés, antique shops and assorted small businesses. The southern end of South King Street, between Alice Street and St Peters railway station, features three theatres (New Theatre, King Street Theatre and Sydney Independent Theatre Company) and three pubs (Union Hotel, Botany View Hotel and Sydney Park Hotel).

==In popular culture==
* The 1985 song &quot;King St&quot; by John Kennedy&#x27;s Love Gone Wrong references the street and name-checks various local landmarks and characters of the time including the Coles&#x27; New World supermarket (which occupied the building which is now the Dendy Cinemas), &quot;The Wire Man&quot; (a local eccentric who collected wire coat hangers and scrap metal), Maurice&#x27;s Lebanese restaurant (still extant) and The Hub cinema (which was operating as a pornographic cinema at the time). The music video features extensive footage of King St as it looked in 1985.
* The 1999 Australian drama film Erskineville Kings starring Marty Denniss and Hugh Jackman features King Street in its opening sequence.
* The 2006 Australian drama film Candy starring Heath Ledger and Abbie Cornish features Advance Loan Office on King Street, in the scene where the female lead prostitutes herself for money to fund her and her boyfriend&#x27;s drug addiction.
* The Whitlams band became popular for its performances at The Sandringham Hotel on King Street
*King Street is referenced in The Lemonheads song &quot;My Drug Buddy&quot;
*In 2013, Sydney band Sticky Fingers filmed a music video for their song &quot;Australia Street&quot; on King Street between Church and Brown Streets
*In June 2014, English band Coldplay filmed a music video for their song &quot;A Sky Full of Stars&quot; on King Street between Mary and Australia Streets

<doc id="1237517" wikidata="Q6964465" url="?curid=1237517" title="Nanyang Girls' High School">
<text>Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School (NYGH) is an independent girls&#x27; secondary school in Bukit Timah, Singapore. Founded in 1917, it is one of the oldest schools in the country. NYGH offers a six-year Integrated Programme, which allows students to skip the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examinations and proceed to take the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations at the end of Year 6. Students would study in NYGH from Years 1 through 4, before proceeding to the College section of Hwa Chong Institution in Years 5 and 6.

==History==

=== Founding ===
NYGH was founded in 1917 as the Singapore Nanyang Girls&#x27; School by Tan Chor Lam and Teo Eng Hock. The first principal was Yu Pei Gao, and its first premises was a shophouse at 7 Dhoby Ghaut.

In 1921, Yu Pei Gao resigned as principal and six principals took occupancy of the post over a short period of time.

Lee Chin Tien, the chairman of the school&#x27;s board of directors, and Liew Yuen Sien, the principal, developed the school further in 1927. The school was renamed Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School in 1930 and began operations at its new premises at King&#x27;s Road in Bukit Timah the next year. The school system was altered to provide three-year Junior Middle and Senior Middle School courses.

During World War II, the school premises were taken over by the British military and became a field office. The Japanese military took control of the school premises during the Battle of Singapore in 1942 and caused great damage to its facilities.

=== Post-war development ===
After the war ended in 1945, the school&#x27;s board of management, teachers, students and alumni worked together to rebuild the school and resume operations at the YMCA Building on Selegie Road.

In 1957, NYGH was chosen for the NJH Face Aided School Scheme. Subsequently, Nanyang Kindergarten began operating independently in 1960 as the Government-Aided School Scheme excluded the school&#x27;s kindergarten section.

In 1978, the primary section of the school gained autonomy and became a separate but affiliated school, Nanyang Primary School.

=== Attainment of SAP status ===
In 1979, NYGH was designated as a Special Assistance Plan school, in which English and Chinese were offered as first-language subjects. The school was the first to implement the Art Elective Programme for artistically proficient students in 1984. NYGH became an independent school in 1993 and started offering the Gifted Education Programme in 1999. It moved to a new campus at Linden Drive on 6 June 1999. The school&#x27;s chairperson, Ling Siew May, officiated the ceremony. Nanyang Girls&#x27; Boarding School on Linden Drive began operating in December 1999.

=== Launch of Integrated Programme ===
In 2005, the school began the six-year Integrated Programme in partnership with Hwa Chong Institution to enable academically able students to skip the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examinations and proceed to take the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations at the end of Year 6.

In 2013, NYGH became the first girls&#x27; school in Singapore to be conferred the Singapore Quality Award (SQA). It was also named an Apple Distinguished School in 2015.

Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School introduced the Humanities Programme (HP) in 2008, training students who are identified to be talented in the humanities. HP students are offered Philosophy, Advanced Literature, Advanced Geography and Advanced History as well as the opportunity to participate in national and international humanities-based competitions and projects. Such competitions include the Humanities and Social Science Research Programme (HSSRP), Moot Parliament Programme (MPP), Leadership Development Programme (LDP) and various Model United Nations conferences (MUN).

The Science and Math Talent Program (SMTP) was introduced in 2009, for students who are gifted in Sciences and Mathematics. They are offered the Stanford EPGY Mathematics Course as part of the program.

In 2012, Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School initiated the formation of the Strategic Alliance of Global Educators (SAGE) with nine other schools from Singapore, the United States, Australia, China and the United Kingdom, and organised the inaugural SAGE conference for educators from all parts of the world in August 2012. In 2014, it initiated the Strategic Educational Alliance of Southeast Asia (SEA2) with nine other founding schools from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Thailand and Brunei, and hosted the inaugural three-day regional conference learning journey at NYGH. The National University of Singapore&#x27;s Department of Southeast Asian Studies was the conference partner of the event.

== List of NYGH Principals ==
==School culture and identity==
The first school logo of NYGH was a diamond-shaped motif with the school&#x27;s name in Chinese printed in white against a light blue background. It was designed by Chen Jun Wen, an art teacher at the school.

In 1968, the diamond-shaped motif was superimposed on top of a yellow ring emblem with the words &quot;Nanyang Girls&#x27; High&quot; printed on it. The ring emblem was positioned above a yellow banner printed with the school motto, in Chinese. The school motto &quot;Qín Shèn Duān Pŭ&quot; (勤·慎·端·朴) means &quot;Diligence, Prudence, Respectability and Simplicity&quot;.

==Affiliation==
NYGH is a partner school of Hwa Chong Institution, which was formed in 2005 by the merger of the former Hwa Chong Junior College and The Chinese High School. The two schools frequently conduct joint programmes and activities, such as the annual Combined Sports Meet. NYGH is also affiliated with Nanyang Primary School and Nanyang Kindergarten, which are part of the Nanyang family of schools. Despite its name, Nanyang Junior College is not affiliated with NYGH or NYPS.

==Campus==
The campus at 2 Linden Drive (off Dunearn Road) has an area of 36,400 square metres and can accommodate about 1,700 students. It is divided into nine blocks.

===Nanyang Girls&#x27; Boarding School===

Nanyang Girls&#x27; Boarding School provides activities such as formal dinners, enrichment, performances and sports. They also benefit from cultural exchange with boarders from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and China.

The school is able to house a maximum of 500 boarders in 190 rooms comprising 2-4 bedded units, air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned.
== Academic Information ==
=== Bi-cultural Studies Programme (BSP) ===
The Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP) is taken by students under the Special Assistance Plan Scholarship, which is offered by the Ministry of Education to encourage outstanding students who have the interest and capacity to engage both western and eastern cultures and contemporary society.

==Co-curricular activities==
NYGH has around 39 co-curricular activities (CCAs) for the students. The activities consist of sports, performing arts, clubs and societies and uniformed groups. Students undergo rigorous training and practices in preparation for any competitions or performances depending on the CCA.

The school has done well in the past years, repeatedly clinching titles in sports championships in inter-school competitions. The school also excels in the performing arts. In the 2011 Singapore Youth Festival, NYGH clinched eight Gold With Honours and one Silver for its nine performing arts CCA in total (Gold with Honours: Choir, Chinese Dance, Chinese Orchestra, Guzheng, Modern Dance, Chinese Drama, String Ensemble, Theatre; Silver: Band). Students of the school&#x27;s Infocomm Club often take part in infocomm-related competitions, winning prizes in various competitions such as RoboFest, Robocup Singapore Open, Code Xtreme, National Software Competition and the School Digital Media Awards.

NYGH&#x27;s Uniformed Groups CCAs, namely Girl Guides, National Police Cadet Corps and St. John Ambulance Brigade are also available.

The Nanyang Debate Club won runner-up at The Arena, a televised national debate competition as well as in 2008&#x27;s Julia Gabriel&#x27;s Debate Competition. Also, they have emerged as Champions in Hwa Chong Debate Invitationals and done reasonably well at the recent NUS Challenge Shield 2009. Three speakers from the team in the Victoria Junior College Invitationals have been ranked in the Top 5 Best Individual Speakers, with one clinching the Overall Individual Best Speaker award.

The Nanyang Chinese Debate Club has also done well since the club started operation in 2006. NYGH is the two-time champion of the annual Chinese Debating Championships, first in 2007 and in 2012. It is also the only school in Singapore to have obtained the Chinese Debate Championship title twice.

Nanyang is also home to Nanyang Dragon and Lion Dance Troupe cum 24 Drums Ensemble. The troupe started operation as a CCA when it left the National Police Cadet Corps in 2007. They hold annual &quot;caiqing&quot;s during the Chinese New Year where they go around Singapore performing, and also take part in lion dance competitions.

<text>The Whig government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland that began in November 1830 and ended in November 1834 consisted of two ministries: the Grey ministry (from 1830 to July 1834) and then the first Melbourne ministry.

==History==
The first wholly Whig government since 1783 came to power after the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Tory government lost a vote of no confidence on 15 November 1830. The government, led by the Earl Grey, passed the Great Reform Act in 1832, which brought about parliamentary reform, and enacted the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, bringing about the abolition of slavery in most of the British Empire.

However, King William IV dismissed Grey&#x27;s successor Lord Melbourne in 1834 and asked Sir Robert Peel to form a government. Peel was out of the country at the time, so the Duke of Wellington formed a caretaker government.

<doc id="1237519" wikidata="Q13219858" url="?curid=1237519" title="Newtown railway station, Sydney">
<text>Newtown railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Main Suburban line, serving the Sydney suburb of Newtown, in New South Wales, Australia. It is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West Line and T3 Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line services. The railway station and the Newtown Tram Depot were jointly added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

==History==

The original Newtown station opened on 26 September 1855 with the opening of the Main Suburban line. It was located to the west of King Street, about where the former Crago&#x27;s Flour Mills now stand. Mortuary facilities were provided from 1875.

The line through Newtown was quadruplicated in 1892, and a new station was built at the present location. This station consisted of two side platforms and an island platform in the centre. The site of the original station became a goods yard.

In 1927 the line was further expanded to six tracks (four with electrification) and Newtown Station was demolished and replaced by the present station which served only the up and down local tracks. The new station was opened on 29 May 1927. The original overhead booking office was retained and its platform access was modified to serve only this new platform. The bookstall for NSW Bookstall was constructed in 1937. In the original roof of the platform building was removed and replaced with a lower profile roof. In 1989 the station was refurbished.

On 29 October 2012, a new entrance to the station was opened, constructed as part of a major upgrade to the station and surrounding precinct. The upgrade work included demolition of the existing platform building, replacing the platform surface and canopies, and the construction of a new concourse featuring lifts and enhanced stair access to the platform.

The existing access to the platform, via a single narrow flight of stairs connected to a heritage entrance building on King Street, was closed but retained as an emergency exit.
Several buildings were refurbished and converted to retail use, including the former entrance building.

==Configuration==
The station features a single island platform located in a shallow cutting, served by one pair of tracks. The entrance is adjacent to a small public plaza located just off King Street. The area used to be the forecourt of the former Newtown Tram Depot, the tram shed lies disused to the east of the station entrance.

==Description==

===Overhead booking office and station concourse (1892)===
The overhead booking office is constructed in English bond brickwork. On the King Street elevation, the brick walls are painted and have a cement rendered coating about 1500mm high along the footpath. Decorative engaged pilasters remain on either side of the original opening. The south and east elevations have been completely rendered. The hipped roof is covered in shingle terracotta tiles and surmounted at the centre by a square louvre-vented bellcote, which is clad with ribbed lead, and capped by a helmet dome. The finial from the top of the dome is missing. The eastern side of the hip (where the building meets Bridge House) is clad in corrugated steel roofing. A chimney is built at both ends and at the north this abuts the adjoining &#x27;Bridge House.&#x27;

The timber-framed windows are Edwardian double hung sash windows with large glass panes to lower sashes and multi-panel sashes with coloured glass. The semicircular window to King Street has anti vandalism reinforced fibreglass fitted to most of the panes and security bars to the inside. The northern window retains original glazing as well as hardware.

To King Street is a timber framed veranda, supported on six cast iron columns, with a skillion roof with corrugated steel sheeting. The columns have the name &quot;G.Fletcher and Son, Waverley&quot; cast into the bases. The King Street veranda was built in 1902 as an early station building addition. It appears in its original configuration. Still present are early 20th century glass sphere incandescent pendant footpath lights as well as later fluorescent fittings. Early photos show a tram lookout on this elevation which no longer exists. To the railway side (east) is a small concourse, partly sheltered by a cantilevered awning with standard double bowed steel brackets supported on decorative cement haunches. The soffit lining of this awning is corrugated steel fixed to intermediate exposed purlins. Vertical timber boards form a valance at each end of the awning and a timber fascia runs along the front. There is also a simpler corrugated steel skillion roof awning, supported on steel posts, projecting out from the entrance to the Station Manager&#x27;s office adjacent to Bridge House.

The remainder of the area is covered by a flat roofed awning of ribbed steel decking supported on steel frames and circular steel posts. There is also a fire escape stair leading to the first floor of the adjacent building. The stair has a painted brick enclosure under the landing which is the toilet facilities for the shop (on the northern side of the booking office). It has aluminium framed windows and a flat steel roof. The concourse once contained the 1891 iron passenger footbridge leading to the platforms (which have now been removed) and it was replaced in 1927 by the present concrete deck on steel girders and a face brick balustrade. The edge of the concourse to the railway side is screened near the entrance with glazed aluminium framed panels and patent steel fencing (typical arched design) which extends along the edge of the concourse and out onto King Street to the south of the booking office. On the southern elevation, to the rear of the building, is an entrance directly onto the concourse. This elevation has a mass of poorly executed service runs and conduits which have an extremely negative impact on the building.

Internally, the building generally has painted brick walls laid in English bond, a concrete floor covered with a variety of contemporary finishes and painted timber boarded ceilings with stepped cornices between arched timber roof trusses (which appear to remain for the full length of the building). In the centre of each main ceiling space are original circular filigree-vented ceiling roses. Lighting generally is provided by either circular or strip tube type fluorescent fittings.

;Booking hall
Formerly the parcels and ticket office, and converted in 1927 into its present configuration with widened doorways each side which are now fitted with modern heavy hinged and fixed steel grilles. The north boarded wall has been fitted with two modern security ticket windows with 19th century inspired architraves to the public side. Services and conduits are fixed to the walls. The floor is covered in tiles and a large bookstall installation with shutters on the south side.
An early 20th century indicator board is placed near the doorway

;Ticket office
Originally part of the main public booking hall, this space was converted in 1927 into the ticket office. Generally is a contemporary fitout. Carpets have been laid on the floor.

;Staff office and kitchenette
it was originally part of the booking hall. Converted in 1927 into part of the parcels office and in recent years the staff office and kitchenette with contemporary fittings dating from . Partitioning for new adjoining spaces and the false ceiling is formed by plasterboard sheeted timber studs. Above the staff office is a small mezzanine area for staff toilets and the housing of the computer rack. The plasterboard false ceiling to the mezzanine rooms allegedly conceals the higher original ceiling. The floor is finished with vinyl tiles. The toilet facilities have compressed fibre cement sheeting on timber framed walls and ceilings. The floor and skirtings are finished with ceramic tiles. The fittings are contemporary. The stair was built as a timber two-flight stair with a steel pipe handrail.

;Shop to the north

This was originally part of the booking hall and converted in 1927 into the parcels office, this space was converted (pre-1990) into a shop with modern sliding aluminum framed doors for the full width to the street. The brick walled addition to the east (under the fire stair) provides toilet facilities for this shop.

===Platform building (1927)===
This is a rectangular (painted) face brick building, originally with a gabled roof and integral shallower sloped single cantilevered awning. The roof was replaced with the present ribbed steel roof which follows the low-pitched line of the platform awnings. The building is seven bays in length, with the bays defined by engaged brick piers which coincide with the awning supports. The original chimneys have been removed (presumably when the roof was replaced). The awnings have standard double bowed steel brackets supported on decorative cement haunches and bolt fixings to the station building brick walls. The soffit lining is corrugated steel fixed to intermediate exposed purlins and follows the roof slope. The building has simple bargeboards and fascias which have replaced the original vertical timber boards which formed a valance at each end of the awning. The awning roof is continuous from the main roof, and is corrugated steel.

The external walls rise from a projecting brick plinth three/four courses high with simple detailing, such as arched brick heads and brick on edge sills, to the doors and window openings. The original timber windows were double hung with a single paned lower sash and a six paned upper sash featuring coloured glass. A large number of the doors and windows have now been partially or completely bricked up, with some new windows and doors in existing, modified, openings. Most of these new windows have been painted out. Security grilles and flyscreen doors have been installed on the north elevation. Original door openings featured fanlights matching the upper window sashes. All the original timber panelled doors have been either removed or modified, and some original slate thresholds remain. The brick privacy screen to the eastern end of the building has been removed.
The platform building was one of the earliest to have the face brickwork painted due to vandalism.

Internally, the original building consisted of an &quot;out of&quot; room, a station master&#x27;s office; general waiting room; ladies room and ladies toilets, a store and men&#x27;s toilets. The internal usage has now changed and is predominantly storage. The toilets have a modern fitout and finishes. All of the ceilings and cornices were replaced when the roof was rebuilt. Original plaster wall finishes remain, with evidence of dado moulding in some instances, and with some original vents. The former Station Manager&#x27;s office has the original staff moulding to the chimney breast. The floor finish to the toilets is vinyl and is painted concrete in the other rooms.

===Platforms (1927)===
Platform 1 (Up) and Platform 2 (Down) is an island platform arrangement. The platforms are brick faced with a concrete surface. There is painted signs on the platform surface (mostly directional).
===Canopies and stair (1990s)===
Connecting the platform to the rear concourse is a steel framed stair with pre-cast concrete steps. The stair is contained within brick walls with a bull-nosed capping and has modern tubular steel handrails, which continue on to the platform.

The stair is covered by a 1990s steel framed flat roofed awning. This awning continues along the platform, to meet the platform building, and is supported by a series of steel post and beams. The roof of the canopy is designed to line up with the building&#x27;s roof profile.

===King Street Overbridge (1892/1927)===
This large overbridge, constructed in 1892 and modified in 1927, carries in part the overhead booking office, King Street and part of the Enmore Road intersection over five railway lines. It is constructed of reinforced concrete decking supported on a combination of wrought iron and steel girders and at the western end pre-cast concrete beams. The beams and girders are supported in turn by a series of massive load bearing brick structures containing rooms now unused. These rooms would have been accessed from the previous platforms (now demolished). At street level the roads at the western end are screened by brick balustrades with sandstone cappings.

== Heritage listing ==
Newtown Railway Station is of state significance, representing three significant historical phases in the development of the NSW railways. The original Newtown Station to the west of the existing site was one of only five original intermediate stations on the first railway line in NSW between Sydney and Parramatta Junction. The subsequent two stations built on the existing station site date from the 1891 quadruplication and 1927 sextuplication of the line representing the expansion of the railways in the late 19th and early 20th Century to accommodate increasing rail services.

The station is significant in terms of its 1892 overhead booking office which is an important and recognisable element in the streetscape, and is a rare structure being one of only three similar structures in the state representing the earliest use of above-platform buildings. The building along with the King Street overbridge collectively demonstrates a former era of travel.

Newtown railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Newtown Railway Station is historically significant as the existing station along with the former station which existed on site and the original one which occupied a site to its west, represent three significant historical phases in the development of the NSW railways. Established during the first phase of NSW railway construction in the 1850s the original Newtown Station is significant as it was one of only five original intermediate stations on the first railway line in NSW between Sydney and Parramatta. The subsequent (second) building of the station on the present station site was a result of the 1891 quadruplication of the line and the extant overhead booking office and King Street overbridge dating from this time period represent the expansion of the railways in the late 19th century to accommodate increasing rail services. The existing (third) station arrangement with its extant platforms, platform buildings and extensions to the overbridge dates from the 1927 sextuplication of the line and with the extant 1890s structures it collectively demonstrates a former era of travel, communication and trade.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history.

Newtown Railway Station is significant for its association with railway contractor James Angus who was responsible for the design of the overhead booking office at the station. Angus set up the company Angus &amp; Co. which played a major role in railway construction in New South Wales and Victoria notably the duplication of the Granville-Picton line in 1888–92.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

Newtown Railway Station has aesthetic significance with its 1890s overhead booking office which has characteristic features of this type of station building namely the use of brick for construction, the smaller size of the building and its location above the platforms on the King Street overbridge. The overhead booking office is an important and recognisable element in the streetscape. The 1920s &quot;initial island&quot; platform building is a typical but altered example of this type of station building, as the replacement of its original roof with a new roof with a gentler pitch has resulted in a single gable roof without the typical integrated awnings.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

The place has the potential to contribute to the local community&#x27;s sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community&#x27;s history.

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Newtown Railway Station has rarity in terms of its 1892 overhead booking office which is one of only three known examples of similar pre1910 overhead booking offices in the state, the others being at Homebush and Redfern Railway Stations.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

While the platform building is representative example of a common railway standard design, the building has been altered with the replacement of its original roof with a new roof and the partial bricking in of its windows and doors, reducing its ability to represent this type of building.

The King Street overbridge with most of its original fabric intact is a good representative of deck-style plate girder bridge construction.

{ &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ExternalData&quot;, &quot;service&quot;: &quot;geoshape&quot;, &quot;ids&quot;: &quot;Q1375426&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: { &quot;fill&quot;: &quot;#73a3f0&quot;}}

Parengarenga Harbour is a natural harbour close to the northernmost point on the North Island of New Zealand. Located at the northern end of the Aupōuri Peninsula, it extends inland for over 10 kilometres, almost severing the northern tip of the island from the rest of the peninsula. The harbour&#x27;s mouth is towards the northern end of Great Exhibition Bay. The island&#x27;s northernmost point, at the North Cape is only about 10 kilometres north of the harbour. Te Hāpua is a settlement at the western side of the harbour.

== History ==

The harbour was an important location for the kauri gum digging trade in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries, as some of the highest quality kauri gum could be found around the harbour. The Parenga Gumfield Company was formed to harvest this resource.

The white sand of Kokota Sandspit, at the southern head of Parengarenga Harbour, has provided a source of high purity silica sand for glassmaking. Dredging continued here until 1997. While smaller or lower purity deposits are found elsewhere in Northland, the Parengarenga area holds the region&#x27;s largest silica sand resource by far.

Samuel Yates and his wife, Ngāwini Yates, were prominent landowners in the area in the later part of the 19th century and had a homestead on the southern side of the harbour, at Paua.

== Ecology ==

The water is a habitat for Green sea turtles and dolphins, while Orca, and Pilot whales visit the adjacent areas.

<text>The Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) system is an analog image transmission system developed for use on weather satellites. It was introduced in the 1960s and over four decades has provided image data to relatively low-cost user stations at locations in most countries of the world. A user station anywhere in the world can receive local data at least twice a day from each satellite as it passes nearly overhead.

== Transmission ==

=== Structure ===
The broadcast transmission is composed of two image channels, telemetry information, and synchronization data, with the image channels typically referred to as Video A and Video B. All this data is transmitted as a horizontal scan line. A complete line is 2080 pixels long, with each image using 909 pixels and the remainder going to the telemetry and synchronization. Lines are transmitted at 2 per second, which equates to a 4160 words per second, or 4160 baud.

=== Images ===
On NOAA POES system satellites, the two images are 4 km / pixel smoothed 8-bit images derived from two channels of the advanced very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) sensor. The images are corrected for nearly constant geometric resolution prior to being broadcast; as such, the images are free of distortion caused by the curvature of the Earth.

Of the two images, one is typically long-wave infrared (10.8 micrometers) with the second switching between near-visible (0.86 micrometers) and mid-wave infrared (3.75 micrometers) depending on whether the ground is illuminated by sunlight. However, NOAA can configure the satellite to transmit any two of the AVHRR&#x27;s image channels.

=== Synchronization and telemetry ===
Included in the transmission are a series of synchronization pulses, minute markers, and telemetry information.

The synchronization information, transmitted at the start of each video channel, allows the receiving software to align its sampling with the baud rate of the signal, which can vary slightly over time. The minute markers are four lines of alternating black then white lines which repeat every 60 seconds (120 lines).

The telemetry section is composed of sixteen blocks, each 8 lines long, which are used as reference values to decode the image channels. The first eight blocks, called &quot;wedges,&quot; begin at 1/8 max intensity and successively increase by 1/8 to full intensity in the eighth wedge, with the ninth being zero intensity. Blocks ten through fifteen each encode a calibration value for the sensor. The sixteenth block identifies which sensor channel was used for the preceding image channel by matching the intensity of one of the wedges one through six. Video channel A typically matches either wedge two or three, channel B matches wedge four.

The first fourteen blocks should be identical for both channels. The sixteen telemetry blocks repeat every 128 lines, and these 128 lines are referred to as a frame.

=== Broadcast signal ===
The signal itself is a 256-level amplitude modulated 2400Hz subcarrier, which is then frequency modulated onto the 137 MHz-band RF carrier. Maximum subcarrier modulation is 87% (±5%), and overall RF bandwidth is 34 kHz. On NOAA POES vehicles, the signal is broadcast at approximately 37dBm (5 watts) effective radiated power.

== Receiving images ==

An APT signal is continuously broadcast, with reception beginning at the start of the next line when the receiver is within radio range. Images can be received in real-time by relatively unsophisticated, inexpensive receivers during the time the satellite is within radio range, which typically lasts 8 to 15 minutes.

 there were almost 5,000 APT receiving stations registered with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It is unclear what percent of the total user-base this represents, since registration is not a requirement, and was only available after 1996.

=== Radio receiver ===
The bandwidth required to receive APT transmissions is approximately 34 kHz. Most older scanners (police and fire type receivers) are the standard 15 kHz bandwidth which were designed to support voice transmissions. Newer VHF general coverage receivers are equipped with multiple IF bandpasses; some are, but not limited to: 6 kHz, 15 kHz 50 kHz &amp; 230 kHz(broadcast FM). Use of a receiver with too narrow a bandwidth will produce pictures that are saturated in the blacks and whites, as well as possible inversion. Too wide, and the noise floor of the receiver will be too high to acquire a good picture. For the amateur enthusiast, a computer controller receiver is the best option to allow the software to automatically tune and set the required modes for proper reception. There are also dedicated APT receivers made specifically for computer control and APT reception. Specifically, ICOM PCR1000, PCR1500 &amp; PCR2500 will produce excellent results. Searching on the web for &quot;NOAA APT (RECEPTION or RECEIVER)&quot; will produce a wealth of information on receivers, software, and antennas.

=== Antenna ===
APT images from weather satellites can be received with a right-hand circular polarized, 137 MHz antenna. Normally, there is no need to have the antenna follow the satellite and a fixed position antenna will provide good results.

The two most frequently recommended antennas are the crossed dipole and the quadrifilar helix antenna (QHA or QFH).

=== Displaying the images ===
Years ago, to receive APT images, a specialized decoder was required in addition to the receiver to display or print images, much like HF WEFAX (serving the maritime community). Often both receiver and decoder were combined into one unit.

Nowadays, with the advent of personal computers, all that is required is dedicated software such as WXtoIMG (many of which offer &quot;free&quot; versions ) and a sound card. The sound card acquires and digitizes the slow scan video (in the audible range) coming from the speaker, phones, or line-out of the receiver, and then the software will process the various visible and infrared channels of the AVHRR sensor. Most software will automatically save every image and publish processed image onto the website of choice, putting up a new image on every pass of an APT satellite.

==== Enhanced images ====
Since each channel of the AVHRR sensor is sensitive to only one wavelength of light, each of the two images is luminance only, also known as grayscale. However, different materials tend to emit or reflect with a consistent relative intensity. This has enabled the development of software that can apply a color palette to the images which simulates visible light coloring. If the decoding software knows exactly where the satellite was, it can also overlay outlines and boundaries to help in utilizing the resulting images.

== History ==
* Developed by the National Earth Satellite Service
* Tested on TIROS-8, launched December 21, 1963
* Nimbus 1, launched August 28, 1964, was the first application satellite
* First NOAA polar-orbiting vehicle to use it was TIROS-N, launched on October 13, 1978, and it has flown on all NOAA polar-orbiting vehicles since then.
* Also flown on the Soviet METEOR, Sich, Resurs and Okean weather satellites.

== Current status ==
Due to APT being phased out, there are very few satellites that still transmit APT. Previous satellites such as Sich-1 and the METEOR series of satellites operated on APT, but have since reached the end of their operational lifespans. 
;NOAA satellites transmitting APT
* NOAA-18
* NOAA-15
* NOAA-19

== Future ==
With improvements in electronics, analog transmission systems have given way to digital transmissions systems. NOAA-19, called NOAA-N&#x27; prior to its launch on 6 February 2009, is the last satellite to carry an APT system. The MetOp program, a collaboration between NOAA and EUMETSAT, has switched to Low Rate Picture Transmission (LRPT) for its new polar-orbit satellites.

<doc id="1237527" wikidata="Q4262337" url="?curid=1237527" title="Lin Wang">
<text>Lin Wang (; 1917 – 26 February 2003) was an Asian elephant that served with the Chinese Expeditionary Force during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) and later relocated to Taiwan with the Kuomintang forces. Lin Wang lived out most of his life in the Taipei Zoo and was the most famous animal of the zoo. Many adults and children alike affectionately called the bull elephant &quot;Grandpa Lin Wang.&quot;

==History==
===Sino-Japanese War===
After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, the Sino-Japanese War, which began in 1937, became a part of the greater conflict of World War II. When the Japanese proceeded to attack British colonies in Burma, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek formed the Chinese Expeditionary Force under the leadership of General Sun Li-jen, to fight in the Burma Campaign. After a battle at a Japanese camp in 1943, Lin Wang, along with twelve other elephants, were captured by the Chinese. These elephants were used by the Japanese army to transport supplies and pull artillery pieces. The Allied forces also used these elephants to do similar tasks. At this time, Lin Wang was named &quot;Ah Mei&quot; (阿美), meaning &quot;The Beautiful&quot;.

In 1945, the Expeditionary Force was recalled to China. The elephants and their handlers marched along the Burma Road, and six elephants died during the difficult trek. By the time they arrived in Guangdong, the war had ended. However, the elephants&#x27; service with the army was not over. They participated in building some monuments for the martyrs of the war, and in the spring of 1946, they also performed for a circus to raise money for famine relief in Hunan province.

Later, four elephants in the group were sent to the zoos of Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Changsha. The remaining three elephants, including Lin Wang, were relocated to a park in Guangzhou.

===In Taiwan===

In 1947, Sun Li-jen was sent to Taiwan to train new troops. He took the three elephants with him, though one sick elephant died during the trip across the strait. The two remaining elephants were used to transport logs and accomplish other simple tasks near the army base in Fongshan, Kaohsiung. In 1951 the other elephant died and Lin Wang became the only one left of the original thirteen elephants from the Burmese days.

In 1954, the army decided to give Lin Wang to Taipei Zoo at Yuanshan (圓山), where he met his lifelong mate Malan (馬蘭). At this time, Lin Wang was still named &quot;Ah Mei&quot; and the keeper of the zoo felt that the name was too feminine. Thus, his name was changed to &quot;King of the Forest&quot; (森林之王), abbreviated &quot;Lín Wáng&quot; (林王). However, a reporter misheard the name and published his name as Lín Wàng (林旺, different character and different intonation), and this name stuck forever.

Lin Wang became the most famous and popular animal in Taiwan, and in 1983 the zoo threw the first birthday party for his sixty-sixth birthday. Since then, his birthday was celebrated every year on the last Sunday of October at the zoo, attracting thousands of visitors, including visitations from Taipei mayors. In 1986, the zoo relocated from Yuanshan to Mucha and many Taipei citizens crowded along the streets to see the animals, particularly Lin Wang, move house.

In early 2003 Lin Wang suffered arthritis on his left hind leg. He started to lose appetite along with other complications. His condition deteriorated and he died on 26 February.

His memorial service, which lasted several weeks, was visited by tens of thousands of people, many of whom left cards and flowers for the elephant. Lin Wang was posthumously made a Honorary Taipei Citizen by Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou. President Chen Shui-bian sent a wreath, with a card addressing &quot;to our forever friend, Lin Wang.&quot;

==Legacy==

Compared to the average life expectancy of 70 for a typical Asian elephant, Lin Wang lived much longer, dying in his eighty-sixth year. He is the longest-living elephant in captivity, surpassing Lakshmikutty from India who reached the age of 84 before she died in 1997.

In addition to his service to the army, Lin Wang also became a cultural icon and an inseparable part in the memories of many. His life mirrored important events in history, such as the wars in China and later the economic miracle of Taiwan, and three generations of people remember him fondly as a part of national identity. In 2004 Lin Wang was immortalised in a life-size specimen in Taipei Zoo credited to taxidermist, Lin-Wen Lung (林文龍).

<doc id="1237528" wikidata="Q16093151" url="?curid=1237528" title="Brian Walden">
<text>Alastair Brian Walden (8 July 1932 – 9 May 2019) was a British journalist and broadcaster who spent over a decade as a Labour politician and Member of Parliament (MP). He was considered one of the finest political interviewers in the history of British broadcasting, tenacious and ruthless. He won awards for broadcasting including the BAFTA Richard Dimbleby Award for television in 1986, and in 1991 was named ITV Personality of the Year. He was known for interviews of politicians, especially Margaret Thatcher. He was said to be her favourite interviewer, although he gave her tough interviews.

==Early life==
Born in West Bromwich, Walden was the son of a glassworker and attended West Bromwich Grammar School. He won an open scholarship to study history at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. In 1957 he was elected president of the Oxford Union. After Sir Oswald Mosley was invited to speak at a debate held on 24 October 1957, Walden was asked by a fellow undergraduate why Mosley had been invited. He replied, &quot;This society was founded many years ago to enshrine a very great principle, that of free speech. The society has had to fight against many authorities to ensure that minority points of view shall be put&quot;. Walden apparently &quot;narrowly missed a first&quot; in history in his finals. The following year he undertook a speaking tour of the United States with Stuart Griffiths, during which he took part in 47 debates.

Walden began a doctorate at Nuffield College, Oxford about Lord Randolph Churchill; however, he never finished it.

==Political career==
Walden unsuccessfully contested the safe Conservative constituency of Oswestry in the 1961 by-election, coming third for Labour.

At a debate at the Oxford Union held on 11 June 1964, Walden caused uproar by calling Lord Beaverbrook, who had died two days previously, &quot;evil and repellent&quot; and for attacking the &quot;evil and despicable influence&quot; of his &quot;Express&quot; group of newspapers.

At the 1964 general election Walden was elected MP for Birmingham All Saints in an election where race dominated the Birmingham campaign. He was re-elected in the general elections of 1966 and 1970. When All Saints was abolished, Walden sought and gained the Labour nomination for Birmingham Ladywood, and was elected there in February 1974 and October 1974.

In the aftermath of Enoch Powell&#x27;s November 1968 Eastbourne speech advocating the repatriation of immigrants, Walden urged Prime Minister Harold Wilson not to waver in his opposition to Powell&#x27;s proposals: &quot;If the Government did waver and harass and bully some of Her Majesty&#x27;s subjects towards the boats, British politics would sink to the gutter&quot;. In January 1970, Walden introduced his unsuccessful private member&#x27;s bill, the Right of Privacy Bill, which was designed to protect people&#x27;s right to privacy from the press.

In October 1971, Walden told an anti-EEC meeting in Brighton that Roy Jenkins and others in the Labour movement favoured Britain joining because they despaired of their country: &quot;They have grown sick of crisis after crisis and they do not believe that Britain, as an independent country, can solve her own problems... But they are wrong&quot;. After Jenkins resigned from the deputy leadership in April 1972, Wilson appointed Walden to a junior position on Labour&#x27;s shadow treasury team. In October 1972, Walden attacked Dick Taverne&#x27;s &quot;apostasy&quot; for leaving the Labour Party: &quot;Of course an MP must have strong opinions of his own, and I have defied the Labour Party whip more than Dick Taverne has. We owe the Labour Party an unpayable debt and Dick has ratted on a lifetime of obligation&quot;.

At a December 1973 meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on the party&#x27;s state, Walden doubted whether party unity and getting policies across to the public would alone suffice. The party&#x27;s failure lay in not answering the questions ordinary people were asking. After Edward Heath called the February 1974 general election, Walden called it a &quot;fraudulent and rather ridiculous election&quot;: &quot;The fault lies with the Prime Minister. I have as yet read no explanation of why the national interest requires that there should be a strike and an election before miners can be paid money they could be given without either taking place&quot;. Walden lamented that &quot;the nation has been invited to nourish its fear and express class malice... I am living through the death of all my hopes of what this country could be&quot;. He called Heath&#x27;s belief that the election was called to ensure moderation &quot;the most staggering misjudgment of my political lifetime&quot;.

After Labour&#x27;s return to office after the election, Walden declined the office of Minister of State for Industry by citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;. The Selly Oak Constituency Labour Party passed a resolution criticising his &quot;massive consultancy fees&quot;, which Walden earned as a parliamentary consultant to, among others, the Business Equipment Trades Association, the Amusement Trades Association and the Amusement Caterers Association.

The Birmingham pub bombings of 21 November 1974 occurred in Walden&#x27;s constituency. The Commons soon debated whether the death penalty should be restored for terrorist murderers. Walden opened the debate by opposing capital punishment and declaring it to be &quot;judicial execution&quot; and &quot;a cold-blooded act of the state to take a life&quot;. During the 1975 referendum on Britain&#x27;s membership of the EEC, Walden spoke in favour of Britain remaining a member. Walden told the Commons: &quot;I think that the anti-Market campaign will in the end... degenerate into narrow nationalism, the plea for a siege economy, for Socialism in one country. I was never very enchanted by the rhapsodies of the Eurofanatics but I certainly prefer their version of the future to that grim and barren alternative which it seems to me the anti-Marketeers will end up with&quot;.

Walden became disillusioned with the Labour Party by the rise of the left and in May 1975, after Margaret Thatcher was elected Conservative leader, told Conservative Chief Whip Humphrey Atkins that he could bring six Labour MPs with him in crossing the floor. According to a Thatcher biographer, Charles Moore, Walden was &quot;considered the most eloquent of his generation of Labour MPs&quot; and was &quot;more clear-sighted than most in seeing that Mrs Thatcher stood for real change&quot;. He also wrote that &quot;as a grammar school meritocrat who had originally looked for social progress from the Labour Party, Walden recognized her as offering what he sought&quot;.

At a meeting of the Warley East Labour Party in February 1976, Walden defended the government&#x27;s policy and the benefits of the mixed economy against Stuart Holland&#x27;s proposals for more socialist policies. In the Labour leadership election that was held after Harold Wilson announced his resignation, Walden voted for Michael Foot, rather than James Callaghan, because he considered Foot &quot;a man of principle&quot;. After the first 100 days of Callaghan&#x27;s premiership, Walden remarked: &quot;If I had thought he was going to be as good as this I would have voted for him&quot;.

In November 1976, Walden joined the fellow right-wing Labour MP John Mackintosh in abstaining on the vote for the government&#x27;s Dock Works Regulation Bill and thereby wrecked its passage through Parliament. The Bill would have ensured that dock workers within five miles of any port or important inland waterway belonged to the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union. The executive committee of Walden&#x27;s constituency Labour Party supported his stance although left-wing demonstrators criticised him. After the 1977 Budget, Walden said, &quot;Our level of direct taxation—income tax—is ludicrously high, and our rate of indirect taxation is not taking enough of the burden&quot;.

He campaigned for the liberalisation of cannabis and gambling laws. He was nicknamed by some &quot;the bookies&#x27; MP&quot; when he was revealed to be receiving more from the National Association of Bookmakers than his parliamentary salary.

On 16 June 1977, Walden resigned from the House of Commons by taking the Chiltern Hundreds to become a full-time journalist and broadcaster. Walden said, &quot;I am not leaving because of any disenchantment with the Government. I have gone for positive, not negative reasons&quot;.

==Journalistic career==
Walden went on to present television programmes, mostly for London Weekend Television, such as &quot;Weekend World&quot;, &quot;The Walden Interview&quot; and &quot;Walden&quot;. He was also a member of the board of Central Television between 1981 and 1984.

In 1978, Walden told Conservative MP Bernard Weatherill that &quot;the only way the Tories can lose the next general election is if they are not Conservative enough&quot;. By 1979, Walden passionately believed that trade union power should be broken, telling Margaret Thatcher that &quot;the trade unions have become an estate of the realm, above the law&quot;. The week after this conversation, Walden&#x27;s programme focused on the necessity of legislation against secondary action by trade unions.

In 1981, Geoffrey Wansell claimed that &quot;Weekend World&quot; had become &quot;the flagship of national current affairs shows, quietly stealing the title from its more august rival at the BBC, Panorama&quot;:

The secret of Weekend World&#x27;s success, I suspect, lies in the character of its presenter and interviewer. Lacking the suave public school confidence of his predecessor in the job, Peter Jay, Walden runs on adrenalin and a determination to wring a bit of political revelation and a slice of history out of whichever politician happens to be in the studio with him. In spite of his voice, which vibrates on eardrums like a buzz-saw, Walden has become the second best political interviewer on television—only Sir Robin Day is better. ... Explaining his success, Walden simply says: &quot;I know I understand politicians, but even more I detest ambiguity. It&#x27;s always my instinct to ask people exactly what they mean&quot;.

During an interview with Thatcher in 1983, Walden coined the term &quot;Victorian values&quot; to describe her beliefs, which she accepted and repeated on numerous occasions. Walden wrote Thatcher&#x27;s speech to the Wembley rally during the 1983 general election campaign. In 1988, he called Thatcher &quot;a unique politician...the master spirit of our age&quot;.

After Rupert Murdoch moved the production of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; from Fleet Street to a new plant in Wapping in January 1986, the print unions voted to strike in protest. Many journalists deserted the paper, but Walden lent it his support by becoming one of its senior columnists. He wrote to the paper&#x27;s editor, Andrew Neil: &quot;I don&#x27;t &quot;need&quot; to write for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. I &quot;want&quot; to&quot;. In April 1988, Walden joined Norman Tebbit, Lord Chapple and Lord Marsh in founding the Radical Society, designed to combat &quot;privilege, hierarchy, bureaucracy and collectivism&quot; and to put in their place individualist solutions.

On 26 October 1989, the Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, resigned because Thatcher was unwilling to sack her economics adviser, Sir Alan Walters. Although the interview had been planned months in advance, Walden interviewed Thatcher for the 29 October edition of &quot;The Walden Interview&quot;. Walden told Thatcher&#x27;s confidante Woodrow Wyatt on the day Lawson resigned that he wanted Wyatt to ask Thatcher what questions he should put to her so that he could phrase them in a helpful way. However, as John Campbell notes, Walden&#x27;s &quot;journalistic instinct and her lack of candour made for a devastating exposé, watched by three million people with their Sunday lunch&quot;. Although Thatcher repeatedly claimed that Lawson&#x27;s position was &quot;unassailable&quot;, she floundered when Walden asked what Campbell calls &quot;the killer question&quot;:

Later in the interview, Walden put to her:

Though Thatcher and Walden were described as &quot;old friends&quot;, and Walden was on the record confirming that Thatcher was his favourite interviewee, the pair reportedly never spoke again after this interview. The following Sunday, Walden interviewed Lawson. In his memoirs, Lawson said that Walden was &quot;at that time probably the most formidable and serious political interviewer in the business&quot;.

Upon leaving &quot;Weekend World&quot; as presenter in 1986, Walden was succeeded by Matthew Parris, formerly Conservative MP for West Derbyshire; the series came to an end two years later. The programme was axed by LWT director of programmes Greg Dyke, who needed to save money. In his autobiography, Dyke noted that the Walden one-on-one interview was the most popular part of the programme, and was also the cheapest to make. As a result, Walden was brought back to LWT to host the Sunday lunchtime programme &quot;The Walden Interview&quot; in 1988–89, which was renamed &quot;Walden&quot; and ran between 1990 and 1994 in the same slot. 

In 1998 Brian Walden presented a series of essays on prominent figures, giving his own take, uninterrupted and directly to camera, on Winston Churchill, Abraham Lincoln, Alexander the Great, John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi.

In 2005, Walden presented 10-minute programmes, &quot;A Point of View&quot;, on BBC Radio 4, in a spot formerly occupied by Alistair Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Letter From America&quot;.

==Political satire==
As a well known public figure, Walden appeared in cameo as an interviewer for political comedy shows such as &quot;The New Statesman&quot;. He was the subject of parody in &quot;Spitting Image&quot; as a puppet with a slight speech impediment, voiced by impressionist Steve Nallon.

==Personal life and death==
Walden lived in Guernsey in retirement. He was married three times; to Sybil Blackstone, Jane McKerron, then Hazel Downes (for 43 years). He had four sons, including the actor Ben Walden. He opposed the ban on fox-hunting, and was a strong supporter of Brexit.

Walden died on 9 May 2019 aged 86 at his home in Guernsey from complications connected to emphysema.

Following his death, colleagues paid tribute. Andrew Neil wrote: &quot;... A wonderful interrogator of politicians, especially on &quot;Weekend World&quot;. With Robin Day, he invented the British political interview style. Emulated but not matched to this day.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Walden&#x27;s 1989 interview with Thatcher, and the years leading up to it, were dramatised in James Graham&#x27;s 2025 Channel 4 series &quot;Brian and Maggie&quot;, with Steve Coogan portraying Walden.

<text>King William IV had dismissed the Whig government of Lord Melbourne on 14 November 1834 and asked Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, to form a government but he declined, instead recommending Sir Robert Peel. Peel was in Sardinia at the time, so the Duke of Wellington took control of the government in a caretaker capacity until Peel returned and was able to form his government on 10 December.

==List of ministers==
During the caretaker government there was no Cabinet.

===Notes===
* Wellington was the only Secretary of State.
* As no separate Chancellor of the Exchequer had been appointed, Denman held the post &quot;pro tempore&quot; by virtue of being Lord Chief Justice.
* Most offices were in commission.

<text>UVC-based preservation is an archival strategy for handling the preservation of digital objects. It employs the use of a Universal Virtual Computer (UVC)—a virtual machine (VM) specifically designed for archival purposes, that allows both emulation and migration to a language-neutral format like XML.

==Background to the development of a UVC approach ==
===Digital preservation problem===
Preservation of digital resources is of a paramount importance for deposit libraries, research libraries, archives, government agencies, and actually most organizations. The dominant approach to digital preservation is migration. Migration entails making periodic transformations of archived information into new logical formats as their native formats, or the software or hardware on which they depend becomes obsolete. The notable danger of migration is data loss, and possible loss of original functionality or the ‘look and feel’ of the original format. Furthermore, digital migrations are time consuming and costly as the process requires converting the format of every document, in addition to copying converted bit streams to new media as necessary. 

===Emulation theory===
Jeff Rothenberg caused a bit of stir in organizations concerned and responsible for digital preservation with his report in 1999: &quot;Avoiding technological quicksand: Finding a viable technical foundation for digital preservation&quot;. He states that there are no viable solutions to ensure that digital information will be readable in the future. The proposed solutions of relying on standards and migrations are labeled time consuming and ultimately incapable of preserving digital documents in their original form. He suggests:

&quot;an ideal approach should provide a single, extensible, long-term solution that can be designed once and for all and applied uniformly, automatically, and in synchrony (for example, at every future refresh cycle) to all types of documents and all media, with minimal human intervention.&quot;

He proposes that the best way to satisfy the above criteria is Emulation by; developing an emulator that will run on unknown future computers; developing techniques to capture the metadata needed to find, access and recreate the document; developing techniques for encapsulating documents, their attendant metadata, software, and emulator specifications.

In 2000, he suggests implementing an emulation-based preservation approach in which emulator specification are expressed as programs and interpreted by an emulator specification interpreter program written for an emulation virtual machine.

Rothenberg&#x27;s approach was met with skepticism and considered too technically challenging, too expensive and too time consuming, and therefore an economic risk (without the support of empirical evidence). (See further reading section)

===UVC concept development===
====Role of IBM====
Raymond A. Lorie, during his employment at IBM Research Centre Almaden, initiated the development of a UVC-based solution to long-term digital preservation. He describes the approach as ‘Universal’ because its definition is so basic that it will endure forever, ‘Virtual’ because it will never have to be physically built and it is a ‘Computer’ in its functionality.

IBM (NL), the asset owner of the UVC, continues to develop the UVC concept within the PLANETS project. Raymond van Diessen is responsible for extending the application of the UVC concept to preserve more complex objects.

====Role of the National Library of the Netherlands====
The National Library of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Bibliotheek, KB) played a major role in demonstrating that emulation based on the UVC concept is a viable option for long-term digital preservation.

In 2000, the emulation advocate, Jeff Rothenberg participated in a study with the KB to test and evaluate the feasibility of using emulation as a long-term preserving strategy. His method was to use software emulation to reproduce the behaviour of obsolete computing platforms on newer platforms offering a way of running a digital document’s original software in the far future, thereby recreating the content, behaviour, and ‘look and feel’ of the original document. Rothenberg was criticized for trying to preserve the wrong thing by suggesting to emulate the behavior of old hardware platforms and operating systems to access the original data through the original software program associated with it. Raymond A. Lorie recognized the difficulties in trying to create a program to emulate a &#x27;real&#x27; machine on a future platform and realised that this approach was overkill for the purpose of preserving digital objects. Instead he introduced a novel approach of data/program archiving using a ‘Universal Virtual Computer’. The concept of the UVC-based preservation strategy was implemented by the KB and tested on PDF files as part of a KB/IBM ‘Long Term Preservation’ (LTP) study. Creating a UVC for PDF documents is more complex. Instead the KB decided on developing a UVC for images because this approach would also cover PDF documents (a PDF file can easily be converted to a series of images). The UVC-based approach resulted in the UVC as one of the permanent access tools for JPEG/GIF87 images within the Preservation Subsystem of the KB’s e-Depot.
Following the successful implementation of the UVC, the KB has continued to develop their emulation strategy for long-term digital preservation by focusing on &#x27;full&#x27; or hardware emulation. This approach delivered a durable x86 component-based computer emulator: Dioscuri, the first modular emulator for digital preservation.

== UVC-based preservation ==
The Universal Virtual Computer is part of a broader concept, called the UVC-based preservation method. This method allows digital objects (like text documents, spreadsheets, images, sound waves, etc.) to be reconstructed in its original appearance anytime in the future. The methods are programs written in the machine language of a Universal Virtual Computer (UVC). The UVC is completely independent of the architecture of the computer on which it runs.

The UVC itself is a program which contains a set of instructions rather than a physical computer.
It will run as a software application on a future platform. Because we do not know at this time which hardware is available in the future, the UVC must be created at the time we want to access a particular document from the repository. This UVC then forms the platform on which programs can run that have been specifically written for such UVC in the past. Creating an emulation program for the UVC in the future is much simpler than trying to emulate a &#x27;real&#x27; machine.

===Application description===
The method of a UVC-based preservation strategy differentiates between data archiving which does not require full emulation, and program archiving which does. For archiving data, the UVC is used to archive methods which interpret the stored data stream. The methods are programs written in the machine language of a Universal Virtual Computer (UVC). The UVC program is completely independent of the architecture of the computer on which it runs.

====Data archiving====
Data archiving reconstructs the &#x27;look and feel&#x27; of the original file but not the functionality of the original format. If the electronic form of the document is only used for compact storage or if the way the document looks to the human eye is all there is, then it suffices to archive the document as an image. If additional functionality is needed, such as text searching, storing only the image is not enough. In this case the text also needs to be archived along with the image of the document. 
By restoring the original appearance of a file as an image a future user can see what the original file looks like in page layout, style, font etc. The text itself needs to be exported i.e. in ASCII format and can be saved as a sequence of homogeneous elements (all presentation attributes like font, size, etc. are the same for all characters) because the page image shows the exact look of the page. In this case the UVC program of the data has two parts, one to decode the text and one to decode the image.

 What it entails

The data contained in the bit stream is stored with an internal representation, extracted from the data stream, of logical data elements that obey a certain schema in a certain data model. A decoding algorithm (method) extracts the various data elements from the internal representation and returns them tagged according to the schema. An additional schema (schema to read schemas) with information of the schema is similarly stored with the data together with a method to decode the schema to read schemas.

=====Logical Data View=====

The logical data model is kept simple in order to minimize the amount of description accompanying the data and to decrease the difficulty of understanding the structure of the data. The data model chosen for the UVC-based preservation method linearizes the data elements into a hierarchy of tagged elements organized using a XML-like approach.
The tagged data elements are extracted from the data stream of the digital file. A tag specifies the role that the data element plays in the data structure. The element tags hold the specific information about the content of the data in a technology-independent manner. Furthermore, the data elements tagged according to the schema are returned to the client in a Logical Data View (LDV)

Example of Logical Data View

=====The schema (format decoder)=====

More information is needed about the various data elements in order to humanly understand what each element means, information such as the place of the tags in the hierarchy, the type of data (numeric, characters), together with some information on the semantics of the data. For example, the image has two attributes, width and heights, indicating that width times height pixels follow; but are these pixels stored line by line or column by column? Or, for colored pictures, how to interpret the RGB values in order to recreate the right color? This extra information is also called metadata. The schema is clearly application-dependent as it describes the structure and meaning of the tags as parts of a specific information type.

=====Schema to read the schemas (Logical Data Schema (LDS))=====

If in the future a user gets the tagged data elements, he/she will generally not understand the meaning of the data and the relationships between them and the future user will need additional information on the logical structure. In other word, a schema to read the metadata schema is needed. A simple solution adopted for the UVC approach is a method for the schema similar to the method for the data: the schema information is stored in an internal representation, and accompanied by a method to decode it.

At this point, what will be included in the archive is: the data itself, the metadata, a UVC program to decode the data, and a UVC program to decode the metadata.

==== Program archiving ====

The UVC method for data archiving can be extended for program archiving. Program archiving involves archiving the behavior and functionality of a program and may involve archiving the operating system as well.
Archiving the operating system may not be needed if the program is only a series of native instructions of the operating system. 
However, the operating system must be archived if the digital object is a full-fledged system with Input/Output interactions.
If no Input/Output interactions are needed it suffices to archive the operating system&#x27;s program.
In this case, using a similar method as described above, the following needs to be stored at archiving time:
* the program
* a UVC program that emulates the instruction sets of the operating system on which the original program (i.e. software application) runs.

&quot;In the future&quot; - the UVC interprets the UVC code which will yield the same result as the original program running on the original operating system.

When Input/Output interactions are involved things become more complicated as an additional UVC program that mimics the functioning of the Input/Output device processor must be archived. This UVC program will produce an Input/Output data structure. 

&quot;In the future&quot; - a mapping of the data structure needs to be written to the actual device.

The UVC method replaces the need for a multitude of standards (one for each format) by a single standard on the UVC method. That standard should cover: the UVC functional specifications, the interface to call the methods, the model for the schema and for the schema to read schemas

===Specification===
The central idea of UVC-based preservation is that digital objects preserved in an archive can be reconstructed anytime in the future without losing the meaning of that object.
The UVC architecture is influenced by the characteristics as a real existing computer. It contains a memory, registers and a set of low-level instructions. The architecture differs from a &#x27;real&#x27; computer in that it never has to be physically implemented. Consequently there are no actual physical cost. 
The core element of the UVC is its segment-based memory. It uses segments of memory to store distinct parts of the data. This segment-based design prevents the allocated memory to be accidentally overwritten by other applications as it does not share its memory space.

====Conceptual model====
Together with the original data it is possible to reconstruct the meaning of each particular digital object. The UVC can be seen as the heart of the system. Like the Java Virtual Machine and the Common Language Runtime, the UVC is actually an emulator which allows a program to run on virtual instances of the necessary, usually obsolete, hardware, and will continue to emulate the necessary hardware as technology continues to evolve. Because we do not know at this time which hardware is available in the future, the UVC must be created at the time we want to access a particular document from the repository. The UVC forms the platform on which programs specifically written for the UVC can run.

==== What needs to be done ====

Different steps must be taken at archiving time (present) and retrieval time (future).

=====At archiving time=====
&quot;Step 1&quot; - Define the appropriate logical schema for a given application

&quot;Step 2&quot; - Choose an internal representation and associate a UVC program P with the data. This is part of the normal design of an application

&quot;Step 3&quot; – Write the UVC program for data interpretation

&quot;Step 4&quot; - Archive the schema information by storing an internal representation of the schema information in the bit stream together with a UVC program Q to decode it. Since the structure of the schema is the same for all applications, a schema to read schemata is chosen once and for all.

===== At retrieval time =====
&quot;Step 1&quot; - Create an emulator on the current platform. Because of the simplicity of the UVC concept, it is fairly easy for skilled software developers to construct a UVC emulator for a particular platform of the time

&quot;Step 2&quot; - Develop a Logical Data Viewer (a restore program to restore the data). This is an application program that reads the UVC object code and the bit stream and invokes the emulator to execute the UVC program i.e. the program controls the UVC and all input/output interaction between it

&quot;Step 3&quot; - Write a restore program to restore the schema. Since the logical view for the schema information is fixed a single restore program may actually support all applications. If the future client already knows the logical view for the documents being restored then the schema does not necessarily needs retrieving. Furthermore, the schema only needs to be requested once for a collection of documents of the same type

===UVC convention===
The UVC convention includes the information items that need to be archived today, and preserved indefinitely to enable the retrieval of digital objects in the future.
Included in the convention are;
* The UVC architecture document
* The interface to the UVC emulator (Logical Data Viewer)
* The definition of the logical data schema or LDS (the schema to read schemata)

The convention must be &#x27;written in stone&#x27;. It can be saved digitally, on paper and/or in micrographic media.

===Preservation system===
====Components====
UVC-based preservation as the central idea of the UVC-based preservation method is based on four different components. These are:
* UVC program (format decoder)
* Logical data Schema (LDS) with information type description
* Universal Virtual Computer
* Logical data viewer (UVC interface)
** UVC interpreter
** Restoration program
Fig. 2 UVC and its components
====Description of method====
The UVC program decodes the file format of a digital object. This format decoder program runs on the UVC, which is the platform-independent layer, independent of future hard- and software changes. Executing the format decoder delivers the element tags. These elements build the Logical Data View (LDV) of the data, which is quite similar to XML. The LDV is an instantiation of the LDS, describing the structure and meaning of the tags as parts of a specific information type.

All these components are controlled by a Logical Data Viewer simply called viewer. For reconstruction, the viewer starts the UVC and feeds it with the data of the digital object to a format decoder running on top of the UVC. In return it retrieves an LDV and reconstructs a specific representation of the original object’s meaning.

====Performance====

The architecture relies on concepts that have existed since the beginning of the computer era: memory, registers and basic instructions without secondary features often introduced to improve the execution performance. The performance is of secondary concern as the UVC programs are run mostly to restore the data and not work with them.

Speed is not a real concern either as future machines will be much faster, and an emulation of the UVC on a future machine will consequently run much faster. Furthermore, the flexibility of the UVC is more important than the speed of execution. Even so, performance can always still be improved.

==Implementation==
The UVC for data archiving i.e. the archiving of static files, is proven to work in an operational digital archiving environment. The UVC is one of the permanent access tools for images at the KB.
===UVC for images===
The UVC is proven to successfully restore digital objects in their original form. The application is simple because with images no functionality is needed. The approach to develop a UVC for JPEG images is justified as most formats can be converted to this format. For example, a PDF document can be displayed as a series of JPEG images thereby retaining the &#x27;look and feel&#x27; of the original digital object but sacrificing the functionality. Furthermore, the application for JPEG images can be easily adopted to emulate TIFF images by making a small adjustment to the Logical Data Schema.

The approach can also be applied to all other objects which do not contain behavioral aspects.
For example, interpreters have been written (partially) for Excel, Lotus 1-2-3 and PDF. However, these applications only handle the static features of the formats.

==UVC-based emulation==
UVC-based emulation uses the UVC as a universal platform on which a platform independent emulator can be built. The UVC (software program) recreates a simple general purpose computer and can be easily implemented on any computer platform now and in the future. With this strategy future users should always be able to access and view the original object. The official UVC specification must be preserved at preservation time. Also decoders must be developed for each specific file format and a LSD is required for each type of digital object, defining object types by image, sound, spreadsheet, text, etc. And of course the original objects should be preserved as well.
===Complex objects/dynamic content===
As mentioned before, the UVC-based approach has only been effectively implemented for static files.
The technology continues to be developed by Raymond van Diessen (IBM) to include dynamic objects by exploiting the communication facility between the UVC program and a future application.

===Alternative emulation approaches===
Other emulation approaches are stacked emulation, migrated emulation and Emulation Virtual Machine (VM).

&quot;Stacked emulation&quot;

Stacked emulation is platform dependent emulation that requires, over time, multiple emulators running on top of each other to reconstruct a historic platform. This brings better performance and functionality but lacks compatibility between platforms. This approach can mainly be found in the gaming industry.

&quot;Migrated emulation&quot;

Migrated emulation involves creating a platform dependent emulator that must be migrated (adapted) to subsequent newer hosts. When the particular operating system on which the emulator is created becomes obsolete, the emulator is translated to run on the new current platform. This approach is a strategy with high risks

&quot;Emulation Virtual Machine (EVM)&quot;

The EVM was presented by Jeff Rothenberg in 1999 and involves introducing an additional layer between the host platform and emulator and is said to be platform and time independent.
This approach uses a virtual machine, and an emulator specification interpreter. It is said to be platform and time independent.
It is quite complex as an emulation specification needs to be written for the computer platform on which the original software runs. The specification is then interpreted by an emulation specification interpreter that creates an emulator for the old platform. Both the interpreter and the created emulator run on the EVM.

==Cost implications==

==Copyright issues==
Copyright issues for this approach are not expected to be different from those of any other approach.

If intellectual property rights exist for a format this issue has to be taken up with the format owners. Similarly, to &#x27;UVC-enable&quot; applications the source code is required from the developer and therefore permission from the owner. Lastly, for hardware emulation, all the relevant licenses of the software running on the system are required.

<doc id="1237541" wikidata="Q1165401" url="?curid=1237541" title="Toyota Century">
<text>The is a lineup of full-size luxury cars and limousines produced mainly for the Japanese market, serving as Toyota&#x27;s flagship car within Japan; globally the unrelated Lexus LS series is Toyota&#x27;s flagship luxury model. Production of the Century began in 1967, and the model received only minor changes until redesigns in 1997 and 2018.

The Century derived its name from the 100th birthday of Sakichi Toyoda (born 14 February 1867), the founder of Toyota Industries. It is often used by the Imperial House of Japan, the Prime Minister of Japan, senior Japanese government leaders, and high-level executive businessmen. The Century is comparable in purpose to the Austin Princess/Daimler DS420, Cadillac Series 70, Mercedes-Maybach, Hongqi, Rolls-Royce Phantom, and Russian ZIS/ZIL limousines.

The first-generation Century was available with only a V8 engine (the third post-war Japanese-built sedan so-equipped) at its introduction in 1967 until a full platform redesign in 1997. The second generation was only installed with a Toyota-designed and -built V12, an engine bespoke to the Century, until 2018, when the power-train reverted to a V8 with the addition of Toyota&#x27;s hybrid technology.

While the Century is a premium, full-size luxury sedan, it is not available at Japanese Lexus dealerships; it can only be purchased at specifically identified &quot;Toyota Store&quot; locations. The gold phoenix logo used throughout is called the or from Sinospheric mythology, representing the Imperial House of Japan, and the image can be found throughout Asia, such as the Kinkaku-ji in Kyoto.

The exterior styling of the Century has, with some modifications, remained unchanged since its introduction, primarily due to its perception as denoting conservative success. Its appearance is iconic in Asian countries and is usually painted black. The closest Japanese competitor was the Nissan President, with a similar status reputation although, during the 1960s and 1970s, the high market positioning was also shared with the Mitsubishi Debonair. In the 1970s, two other Japanese competitors introduced large sedans — the Isuzu Statesman de Ville and the Mazda Roadpacer (both derived from General Motors-Australia products) — which were short-lived.

The Century nameplate introduced the SUV body style in 2023.

== First generation (G20/G30/G40; 1967) ==
The original Century was based on the 1964 Crown Eight, which featured the 2.6 L V8 &quot;Toyota V engine&quot;, and appeared almost two years after the October 1965 introduction of the 4-liter Nissan President. Apart from minor cosmetic changes and engine upgrades, the design remained largely untouched during its 30-year production run. This appearance has also inspired the designs of subsequent versions, as it remains desired by its clientele. The Century used an electromagnetic door latch that integrated a door lock, and the interior and exterior door handles were electrically operated. The Crown Eight used a button for interior use to release the latch mechanism, while the Century provided a conventional door release handle that remained electrically operated.

The 1967 Century was equipped with an upgraded version of the Crown Eight engine, the 3.0 L &quot;3V&quot;. 1973 saw the introduction of the 3.4 L &quot;4V&quot;, replaced by the &quot;4V-U&quot; two years later, benefitting from the installation of emission control technology Toyota called &quot;TTC&quot;. Only column shifters were available at first, with a manual being the base option. The manually shifted versions (Type A and Type B) were discontinued in 1973 and August 1974 respectively. The 3.4-liter V8 received fuel injection in November 1978 (&quot;4V-EU&quot;), enabling the car to meet the 1978 Emissions Standards. This also meant that the chassis code was changed, to VG35. The engine was once again changed to the 4.0 L &quot;5V-EU&quot; in November 1982 (VG40), along with an all-new exterior appearance. Note that the &quot;3V&quot;, &quot;4V&quot;, and &quot;5V&quot; do not refer to the number of valves in the engine but simply denote model names in the Toyota V engine range. On the &quot;C&quot; pillar there is a badge in blue with a gothic-style &quot;C&quot; for Century with a label &quot;V8&quot; below. The suspension used trailing arms for the front and rear wheels with airbag support springs.

In 1971, automatic climate control became available, an innovation. Along with the change of engine in April 1973 (VG21) a host of other changes took place. The electromagnetic locks were updated, and taillights were changed from a three-bulb sequential turn signals, adding an amber turn signal bulb on the outer edge and front disc brakes. In September 1987, the Century received another light makeover, changing from a hydraulically operated three-speed to an electronically operated four-speed automatic transmission. A floor-mounted shifter became available on a model called the D-type, which also had front bucket seats rather than a full-width bench. The grille received detail changes and the cornering lamps were integrated into the headlight surrounds.

During Japan&#x27;s Bubble Economy, sales of the Century doubled (from 1,027 in 1985 to 2,117 in 1989). The Century sedan wasn&#x27;t enough for those heady days, and in October 1989, the Century Limousine appeared. This was longer for an overall length of , on a wheelbase, approximately the same dimensions as a Cadillac de Ville series, Lincoln Town Car, Mercedes-Benz S-Class, or a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit. The Limousine also received a standard padded vinyl roof and an opera window in the centre pillar, where the stretch was placed. It also uses 150 mm wider rear doors, for a more balanced design and ease of entry. An annual production of 60 was planned. As of September 1990, there was also an L-type stretched version of the Century sedan — length is with a wheelbase of ; this model uses the same larger rear doors as were fitted to the Century Limousine. In December 1992, the Century received its last makeover, with some very minor changes taking place in late 1994.

A Century with a GT45 gas turbine and electric motor was shown as the Century gas turbine hybrid concept vehicle at the 1975 Tokyo Motor Show.

=== Chassis codes ===

* VG21: 3.4 L &quot;4V&quot; V8, 1973–1975
* VG30: 3.4 L &quot;4V-U&quot; V8, 1975–January 1977
* C-VG30: January 1977–November 1978 (1977 Emissions Standards)

* VG45: 4.0 L &quot;5V-EU&quot; V8 (L-type) 1990–1997

== Second generation (G50; 1997) ==
The Century received a complete redesign in April 1997, although the new model was visually very similar to the previous generation. This model is powered by a 5.0 L &quot;1GZ-FE&quot; V12, rated at in Japanese models and at 5200 rpm in export models. Torque was rated at at 4000 rpm for both Japanese and export versions. It was initially equipped with a 4-speed &quot;A342E&quot; automatic, until a 6-speed &quot;intelligent&quot; transmission arrived in 2005. The suspension was upgraded to double wishbone control arms for the front and rear wheels with airbag support springs. The Century remains the first and only Japanese front-engine, rear-wheel-drive production car equipped with a V12, and it has Toyota&#x27;s first V12 engine. 

This generation no longer offered a selection of level of equipment preferred, and has either a floor-mounted or column-mounted transmission selector. From 2003 through 2004, the V12 engine was briefly offered with the ability to use CNG fuel. 

Toyota began limited official exports of the G50 Century to Europe and other Asian markets including China and the Middle East in November 1998, positioning it as an executive car for company and government officials. About 100 left-hand drive cars were produced for export, with some going to the United States for promotional and testing purposes. Several were in use as corporate cars for Toyota&#x27;s North American executives. , the G50 remains the only generation of the Century sedan to have officially been exported and sold outside of Japan.

The Century was Toyota&#x27;s most luxurious model at its inception in 1967, and maintained this status throughout the 20th century. Today, it is positioned above the Lexus line-up, and is the most luxurious and prestigious Toyota. In contrast to other luxurious cars (such as the Maybach or Rolls-Royce), the Century has not been positioned and marketed as a sign of wealth or excess. Marketing literature states roughly that, &quot;the Century is acquired through persistent work, the kind that is done in a plain but formal suit.&quot;

Like other cars in the top of the luxury class, the Century is designed with the rear passengers in mind. Hence, the rear seats recline and the front passenger seat (in right-hand drive cars only) has a fold-down center section so that a passenger in the back may stretch their feet forward. The rear seats are equipped with a massage system. The doors are equipped with a soft-close mechanism, allowing the door to pull itself completely closed electrically when the latch makes contact with the striker.

The Century was priced at – approximately . In comparison, the base price for the full-size luxury 2008 Lexus LS 460 is approximately (), with the LS 600h L at ().

The second generation Century was discontinued on 4 February 2017, after almost 20 years of production. 9,573 vehicles were built from 1996 (the launch year was 1997) to the final figure of 100 cars in 2016.

=== Century Royal (G51; 2006) ===
The Century Royal is the official state car currently used by the Emperor of Japan, being a specially prepared Century, a one-off () custom car. This special version has wool cloth upholstery, internal granite entry steps and Japanese &quot;washi&quot; rice paper headlining for the passenger compartment, as well as undisclosed security measures. The front passenger compartment is upholstered in leather. 

The suspension consists of double wishbones for both the front and rear wheels, supplemented by air-bag support springs. The engine used is the 5.0 L-V12 shared with the standard Century with power rated at and of torque at 4000 rpm. For various state functions, additional conventional Century sedans are used with a designated &quot;Imperial&quot; number roundel.

The limousine stretches around 20 feet in length and 6.5 feet across.

=== Chassis codes ===
* GZG50: 5.0 L &quot;1GZ-FE&quot; V12
* GZG50L: 5.0 L &quot;1GZ-FE&quot; V12 (LHD export)
* GZG50R: 5.0 L &quot;1GZ-FE&quot; V12 (RHD export)
* GZG51: 5.0 L &quot;1GZ-FE&quot; V12 (Century Royal)

== Third generation (G60; 2018) ==
The third generation Century was unveiled at the October 2017 Tokyo Motor Show. The car then went on sale on 22 June 2018, with prices starting from (approximately at June 2018 exchange rates) to the top grade Century Limousine at . The Century&#x27;s production is limited to 50 per month, and it is built in a &quot;nearly hand-made&quot; fashion. Unlike the previous generation, the G60 Century is no longer available outside of the Japanese market due to the G50&#x27;s failure to sell overseas.

It shows that its appearance was influenced by the Century Royal, which was produced at the request of the Japanese Imperial Household Agency to be used by senior members of the Imperial House of Japan in 2006. The full model update maintains the visual tradition of the Century model, while incorporating appropriate technological upgrades and advances such as Toyota Safety Sense P-series collision avoidance support, and Toyota T-Connect. The traditionally installed side-view mirrors above the front wheels, a standard feature that started with the first generation, have been replaced with door mounted units, incorporating turn signal lights. 

As with previous generations, rear passenger comfort and convenience is made a priority. The rear seats have a recline feature, with integrated heaters and massage function, as well as an adjustable power leg rest for the rear seat opposite the driver. The sound system comes standard with 20 speakers. A 20-inch LCD screen is installed for rear seat passengers that let occupants control many aspects and features as a convenience as well as playing video content. The standard upholstery fabric continues to be offered in three color choices using 100% wool with a unique heather pattern, with leather remaining available optionally in two different color combinations. Both upholstery choices include two different wood inlay selections. The transmission selector, which on previous generations was either floor mounted or steering column installed, is now only available on the floor.

The powertrain is Hybrid Synergy Drive including the &quot;2UR-FSE&quot; 5.0-litre V8 petrol engine, maintaining the displacement of the prior V12 engine but adding an electric drive system for fuel economy improvement to , compared to the prior generation&#x27;s . The powertrain package is the same as the 2008-2017 Lexus LS 600h &amp; LS 600h L; however, as the fifth-generation LS does not feature this powertrain, it is now unique to the Century. The suspension has been upgraded from the previous double wishbone to a multi-link suspension with supplemental air bags to further enhance ride quality. Toyota first displayed a hybrid engine in the Century at the 1975 Tokyo Motor Show in the Century gas turbine hybrid, with a GT45 gas turbine and electric motor.

===Production transfer===
From 1967 to 2020, the Century was assembled at the Higashi-Fuji plant (Susono, Shizuoka) owned by Kanto Auto Works and its successor Toyota Motor East Japan. On 10 December 2020, Toyota Motor East Japan ceased car production at Higashi-Fuji. Toyota moved the Century assembly operations to Toyota City&#x27;s Motomachi plant.

== Century SUV (G70; 2023) ==
The Century-badged SUV model was unveiled on 6 September 2023. It is built on the front-wheel drive-based GA-K platform shared with the North American market Grand Highlander and the Lexus TX. A 3.5-litre &quot;2GR-FXS&quot; V6 engine with plug-in hybrid drivetrain is standard.

Development was led by Yoshikazu Tanaka as chief engineer, along with Design Division General Manager Tatsuya Sonoda. In its marketing materials and official releases, Toyota avoided the &#x27;SUV&#x27; label to the vehicle. The company described it simply as the &quot;New Century&quot;, and according to Tanaka, a &quot;new concept for chauffeur-driven mobility.&quot; He explained that the G70 Century adopts this body style to maximise backseat space.

In January 2024, Toyota unveiled a unique Century SUV convertible model during the Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo, designed to accompany athletes during Sumo competitions in Japan.

=== Markets ===

==== Japan ====
The Century SUV launched in Japan on 6 September 2023, with orders beginning the same day. In Japan, the SUV is sold alongside the G60 sedan at select Toyota dealerships employing specialized sales and service staff called &quot;Century Meisters&quot;.

==== China ====
The Chinese-market version of the Century SUV was introduced at Auto Guangzhou 2023 on 17 November 2023. Slated to be sold through the Lexus dealer network as an imported model, it is the first Century model to officially be exported and sold outside of Japan with a left-hand drive configuration since the G50 sedan, which was discontinued in 2017.

<text>.lu is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Luxembourg. .lu domains are administered by RESTENA. Since 1 February 2010, the administrative contact no longer needs to be based in Luxembourg.

==History==

For many years, applications for .lu domains could be made only via postal mail or fax. The fees for a .lu second level domain are €40 for the creation (or modification of a contact) and €40 yearly (including VAT). On 18 September 2006, the registry introduced a domain name registrar model. While the classic paper registration is possible, registering with a certified registrar is preferred by RESTENA.

<text>Fourth-generation warfare (4GW) is conflict characterized by a blurring of the distinction between war and politics, and of the distinction between combatants and civilians. It is placed as succeeding the third generation in the five-generation model of military theory.

The term was first used in 1980 by a team of United States analysts, including William S. Lind, to describe warfare&#x27;s return to a decentralized form. In terms of generational modern warfare, the fourth generation signifies the nation states&#x27; loss of their near-monopoly on combat forces, returning to modes of conflict common in pre-modern times.

The simplest definition includes any war in which one of the major participants is not a state but rather a violent non-state actor. Classical examples of this type of conflict, such as the slave uprising under Spartacus, predate the modern concept of warfare.

==Elements==

Fourth-generation warfare is defined as conflicts which involve the following elements:
* Complex and long term
* Terrorism (tactic)
* A non-national or transnational base – highly decentralized
* A direct attack on the enemy&#x27;s culture, including genocidal acts against civilians. 
* All available pressures are used – political, economic, social and military
* Occurs in low-intensity conflict, involving actors from all networks
* Non-combatants are tactical dilemmas
* Lack of hierarchy
* Small in size, spread out network of communication and financial support
* Use of insurgency tactics as subversion, terrorism and guerrilla tactics
* Decentralised forces

==History==
The concept was first described by the authors William S. Lind, Colonel Keith Nightengale (US Army), Captain John F. Schmitt (USMC), Colonel Joseph W. Sutton (US Army), and Lieutenant Colonel Gary I. Wilson (USMCR) in a 1989 &quot;Marine Corps Gazette&quot; article titled &quot;The Changing Face of War: Into the Fourth Generation&quot;. In 2006, the concept was expanded upon by USMC Colonel Thomas X. Hammes (Ret.) in his book, &quot;The Sling and The Stone&quot;.

The generations of warfare described by these authors are:
* First generation: tactics of line and column; which developed in the age of the smoothbore musket. Lind describes First Generation of warfare as beginning after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 ending the Thirty Years&#x27; War and establishing the state&#x27;s need to organize and conduct war. 1GW consisted of tightly ordered soldiers with top-down discipline. These troops would fight in close order and advance slowly. This began to change as the battlefield changed. Old line and column tactics are now considered suicidal as the bow and arrow/sword morphed into the rifle and machine gun.
* Second generation: tactics of linear fire and movement, with reliance on indirect fire. This type of warfare can be seen in the early stages of World War I where there was still strict adherence to drill and discipline of formation and uniform. However, there remained a dependence on artillery and firepower to break the stalemate and move towards a pitched battle.
* Third generation: tactics of infiltration to bypass and collapse the enemy&#x27;s combat forces rather than seeking to close with and destroy them; and defence in depth. The 3GW military seeks to bypass the enemy, and attack his rear forward, such as the tactics used by German Stormtroopers in World War I against the British and French in order to break the trench warfare stalemate (Lind 2004). These aspects of 3GW bleed into 4GW as it is also warfare of speed and initiative. However, it targets both military forces and home populations.

The use of fourth-generation warfare can be traced to the Cold War period, as superpowers and major powers attempted to retain their grip on colonies and captured territories. Unable to withstand direct combat against bombers, tanks, and machine guns, non-state entities used tactics of education/propaganda, movement-building, secrecy, terror, and/or confusion to overcome the technological gap.

Fourth-generation warfare has often involved an insurgent group or other violent non-state actor trying to implement their own government or reestablish an old government over the current ruling power. However, a non-state entity tends to be more successful when it does not attempt, at least in the short term, to impose its own rule, but tries simply to disorganize and delegitimize the state in which the warfare takes place. The aim is to force the state adversary to expend manpower and money in an attempt to establish order, ideally in such a highhanded way that it merely increases disorder, until the state surrenders or withdraws.

Fourth-generation warfare is often seen in conflicts involving failed states and civil wars, particularly in conflicts involving non-state actors, intractable ethnic or religious issues, or gross conventional military disparities. Many of these conflicts occur in the geographic area described by author Thomas P.M. Barnett as the Non-Integrating Gap, fought by countries from the globalised Functioning Core.

Fourth-generation warfare has much in common with traditional low-intensity conflict in its classical forms of insurgency and guerrilla war. As in those small wars, the conflict is initiated by the &quot;weaker&quot; party through actions which can be termed &quot;offensive&quot;. The difference lies in the manner in which 4GW opponents adapt those traditional concepts to present day conditions. These conditions are shaped by technology, globalization, religious fundamentalism, and a shift in moral and ethical norms which brings legitimacy to certain issues previously considered restrictions on the conduct of war. This amalgamation and metamorphosis produces novel ways of war for both the entity on the offensive and that on the defensive.

==Characteristics==
Fourth-generation warfare is normally characterized by a violent non-state actor (VNSA) fighting a state. This fighting can be physically done, such as by modern examples Hezbollah or the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In this realm, the VNSA uses all three levels of fourth generation warfare. These are the physical (actual combat; it is considered the least important), mental (the will to fight, belief in victory, etc.,) and moral (the most important, this includes cultural norms, etc.) levels.

A 4GW enemy has the following characteristics: lack of hierarchical authority, lack of formal structure, patience and flexibility, ability to keep a low profile when needed, and small size. A 4GW adversary might use the tactics of an insurgent, terrorist, or guerrilla in order to wage war against a nation&#x27;s infrastructure. Fourth generation warfare takes place on all fronts: economical, political, the media, military, and civilian. Conventional military forces often have to adapt tactics to fight a 4GW enemy.

Resistance can also be below the physical level of violence. This is via non-violent means, such as Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s opposition to the British Empire or the marches led by Martin Luther King Jr. Both desired their factions to deescalate the conflict while the state escalates against them, the objective being to target the opponent on the moral and mental levels rather than the physical level. The state is then seen as oppressive and loses support.

Another characteristic of fourth-generation warfare is that unlike in third generation warfare, the VNSA&#x27;s forces are decentralized. With fourth generation warfare, there may even be no single organization and that smaller groups organize into impromptu alliances to target a bigger threat (that being the state armed forces or another faction). As a result, these alliances are weak and if the state&#x27;s military leadership is smart enough they can split their enemy and cause them to fight amongst themselves.

Fourth-generation warfare goals:
* Survival.
* To convince the enemy&#x27;s political decision makers that their goals are either unachievable or too costly for the perceived benefit.

Yet, another factor is that political centers of gravity have changed. These centers of gravity may revolve around nationalism, religion, or family or clan honor.

Disaggregated forces, such as guerrillas, terrorists, and rioters, which lack a center of gravity, deny to their enemies a focal point at which to deliver a conflict ending blow. As a result, strategy becomes more problematic while combating a VNSA.

It has been theorized that a state vs. state conflict in fourth-generation warfare would involve the use of computer hackers and international law to obtain the weaker side&#x27;s objectives, the logic being that the civilians of the stronger state would lose the will to fight as a result of seeing their state engage in alleged atrocities and having their own bank accounts harmed.

Three principal attributes of the new-age terrorism were held to be their hybrid structure (as opposed to the traditional microscopic command and control pattern), importance given to systemic disruption vis-a-vis target destruction, and sophisticated use of technological advancements (including social media and mobile communications technology). A terrorist network could be designed to be either acephalous (headless like Al-Qaeda after Bin Laden) or polycephalous (hydra-headed like Kashmiri separatists). Social media networks supporting the terrorists are characterized by positive feedback loops, tight coupling and non-linear response propagation (viz. a small perturbation causing a large disproportionate response).

== Criticism ==
&quot;Fourth-generation warfare&quot; theory has been criticized on the grounds that it is &quot;nothing more than repackaging of the traditional clash between the non-state insurgent and the soldiers of a nation-state.&quot; 

Strategic Studies Institute writer and United States Army War College professor Antulio J. Echevarria II, in his article &quot;Fourth-Generation War and Other Myths&quot;, argues what is being called &quot;fourth generation warfare&quot; are simply insurgencies. He also claims that 4GW was &quot;reinvented&quot; by Lind to create the appearance of having predicted the future. Echevarria writes: &quot;The generational model is an ineffective way to depict changes in warfare. Simple displacement rarely takes place, significant developments typically occur in parallel.&quot; The critique was rebutted by John Sayen, a military historian and retired Lt. Col. in the Marine Corps Reserve.

Lieutenant General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., USMC, characterizes &quot;fourth-generation warfare&quot; theory as &quot;elegant irrelevance&quot; and states that &quot;its methods are unclear, its facts contentious and open to widely varying interpretations, and its relevance questionable.&quot;

Rod Thornton argues that Thomas Hammes and William S. Lind are &quot;providing an analytical lens through which to view the type of opposition that exists now &#x27;out there&#x27; and to highlight the shortcomings of the current US military in dealing with that opposition.&quot; Instead of fourth generation warfare being an explanation for a new way of warfare, it allows the blending of different generations of warfare with the exception that fourth generation also encompasses new technology. Fourth generation warfare theorists such as Lind and Hammes wish to make the point that it &quot;is not just that the military&#x27;s structure and equipment are ill-suited to the 4GW problem, but so is its psyche&quot;.

<text>.lv is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Latvia. It was introduced on 29 April 1993, two years after the country&#x27;s independence.

Registration is permitted at the second level, and this is the form of registration currently encouraged by the registry; however, registrations are also accepted at the third level beneath a number of subdomains:

* .com.lv - commercial entities
* .edu.lv - educational institutions
* .gov.lv - government and semi-government entities.
* .org.lv - various forms of affiliation groups
* .mil.lv - defense/military entities of Latvia
* .id.lv - individuals
* .net.lv - network infrastructure providers
* .asn.lv - associations
* .conf.lv - conferences and exhibitions requiring short duration Internet connectivity

Registration is open to foreigners, though the dispute policy says that precedence is generally given to domestic users. There does not appear to be much non-Latvian use of this TLD; exceptions include a few sites apparently using it to suggest Las Vegas—much as [[.la]] is used for Los Angeles—or “love”—as in “my.lv,” “we.lv,” or “true.lv”—and “live”—as in “xbx.lv” used by Microsoft for shortening links to their Xbox Live service—but these types of uses are not widespread.

The gambling site Bovada, formerly known as Bodog, moved to an .lv domain after the United States Department of Homeland Security confiscated its former domain, bodog.com, in 2012.

Internationalized domain names may also be registered.

<text>TED Karadeniz Ereğli Koleji (TED Karadeniz Ereğli College) is a combined co-educational school including a primary (elementary) division and a high school division located in Karadeniz Ereğli near the Black Sea in Turkey. The school is a part of the Turkish Education Association (TED) schools.

== History ==
The college was opened in 1967 with the efforts of the locals, the state, and Erdemir officials. In 1974, the school saw its first graduates, and the elementary school division opened. In 1981, the high school division went under the control of the Ministry of National Education. In 1986, the high school division re-opened, and the event was named &quot;The Second Birth&quot;. In 1993, the re-opened high school division saw its first graduates. In 1998, the elementary school division became the primary school division and this has brought the need for a new building, which was completed in 2004.

<text>Brenda Burnside (born March 20, 1963) is an American former women&#x27;s boxing &quot;journeywoman&quot;. Despite being given such title by boxing fans and critics (a journeyman or woman in boxing is someone who takes fights, usually on short period, and loses to other fighters), she was well known in the boxing world for the quality of opposition she faced; and she contended for a world title once. She fought in the Super Flyweight division.

== Career ==
Burnside began her professional boxing career on August 8, 1997, at the relatively old age (for a boxer) of 32, losing a four-round decision to Gloria Ramirez, in Houston, Texas. Burnside lost her first four fights, but her opposition included Valerie Troike (twice) and future world champion Sandra Yard.

Her first win came on March 12, 1998, when she outpointed Jayla Ortiz over four rounds in Santa Fe. On her next fight, she defeated Dolores Lira.

Burnside began to show a promising future when she dealt Sue Chase a fifth round knockout defeat on June 3 of that year, in the Worley, Idaho. Sixteen days later, she and Gloria Ramirez were rematched, in Coachella, California. Their second bout resulted in a four-round draw.

Burnside went on to win two more fights in a row, when she and Jayla Ortiz were rematched, on October 17, at Las Vegas, Nevada. The second time , Burnside and Ortiz fought to a six-round draw.

On January 23, 1999, Burnside beat former world champion Imelda Arias by a second-round knockout. On March 13, she made her Madison Square Garden debut, dropping an eight-round split decision to Bridgett Riley. On June 16, she lost to future world champion Margaret Sidoroff for the WIBF&#x27;s intercontinental Super Flyweight title, by a ten-round unanimous decision, in New Orleans, Louisiana. On August 14, she lost to Kathy Williams, but she got a break on her next fight, beating Rosie Johnson by a four-round unanimous decision on November 18. She finished 1999 by dropping another four-round decision, to Kelsey Jeffries, on December 14.

By 2000, Burnside was already contemplating retirement from boxing. Nevertheless, an opportunity to face the well known, two time world champion Para Draine came by, and Burnside accepted it. On February 17, at Worley, she lost to Draine by an eight-round split decision.

Burnside was considering retirement again after this fight, but there still would be one more fight in her career.

She received a world title shot after losing two fights in a row, which is a very unusual circumstance in boxing. With the opportunity of becoming a world champion offered to her, she accepted to fight Daisy Lang in what also was her first and last fight abroad. Fighting for the WIBF&#x27;s world Super Flyweight championship, Burnside lost a ten-round unanimous decision in Germany and later retired from boxing.

Her boxing record was 7 wins, 11 losses and 2 draws, with 4 knockout wins.

<text>.ly is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Libya.

== Registration ==
A .ly registration is the process of registering a user domain name within the ccTLD for Libya. The .ly domain, introduced in 1997, is administered by the registry LYNIC on behalf of the Libyan Post Telecommunications &amp; Information Technology Company (formerly the General Post and Telecommunication Company). This domain is mainly for the use of the general public of Libya.

LYNIC appoints recognized registrars to offer .ly domain names, and these registrars perform all the domain registration tasks on behalf of LYNIC. Libya Telecom &amp; Technology (ltt.ly) is one of those that offer .ly domains to companies and organizations. Sub-domains are also provided within the .ly domain, at the second and third levels beneath various second levels.

According to the registration site, registered .ly domain names must not be &quot;obscene, scandalous, indecent, or contrary to Libyan law or Islamic morality&quot;.

LYNIC registers domain names on a first-come, first-served basis. Applicants may apply for domains with a registration fee of $75 for each domain. Before registration, the domain name, company name, trademark registration, and other legal documents must be provided. In addition, the .ly domain names being registered should not violate any rules set forth by the registrar. Domain names may be registered for a minimum of one year.

Applicants may register domains online or through official registrars list. After completing the registration process, an email is sent to the applicant&#x27;s billing contact address. The .ly domain name becomes active within a few minutes of that email notification.

=== Second-level domains ===
The second-level domains which are open to third-level registrations are:
* .com.ly — commercial services
* .net.ly — Internet-related services
* .gov.ly — government and ministries
* .plc.ly — state-owned companies
* .edu.ly — educational and training institutions
* .sch.ly — schools
* .med.ly — health-related services
* .org.ly — non-profit organizations
* .id.ly — individuals.

Strings shorter than four symbols long are to be registered only through Libya Telecom and Technology to guarantee that registrants have local presence.

== History ==
IANA delegated registration authority for .ly to Khalil Elwiheishi at the Alshaeen for Information Technology in April 1997.

During the weekend of 20 August 2011 at the start of the Battle of Tripoli, the main nic.ly registration site appeared to have been defaced by hackers on the side of the National Liberation Army, though other sites such as bit.ly remained unaffected.

== Domain hacks ==
Many Libyan domains were reserved for English words that end with the suffix &quot;-ly&quot;, such as name.ly, musical.ly (now TikTok) and sincere.ly, so-called domain hacks. As the annual fee for .ly domains remains high ($75 a year), many domain names remain available on the domain prime market, and some popular ones can be bought on the domain secondary market, the result of the domain name speculation.

Many popular URL shortening services are registered in the .ly domain, such as bit.ly (formerly default for use on Twitter).

In October 2010, the domain of &quot;sex-positive&quot; URL shortening service vb.ly, which had been registered in 2009 by American journalist Violet Blue and Ben Metcalfe, was seized by the Libyan web authorities for not being compliant with the law of Libya. A Libya Telecom spokesman stated to Blue: &quot;Pornography and adult material aren&#x27;t allowed under Libyan Law ... Therefore, we removed the domain.&quot; According to one blogger, as of 2014 this was the only known domain seized by nic.ly, and it was seized only after several failed attempts to contact the registrant.

<text>Poets and Madmen is the 11th studio album by American heavy metal band Savatage, released in 2001. It was their last album before their 12-year hiatus, which lasted from 2002 to 2014. The album has a loose concept inspired by the career and death of journalist Kevin Carter, but has much less narrative in the lyrics than the previous two rock operas (&quot;Dead Winter Dead&quot; and &quot;The Wake of Magellan&quot;) penned by Paul O&#x27;Neill. Everything said in the album is fiction, except with regards to what is sung about Carter. The album is also noted as it is the only Savatage album to not feature a title song from the album, although the title was taken from lyrics to the track &quot;Symmetry&quot; from the band&#x27;s 1994 album, &quot;Handful of Rain&quot;.

The album was the first since &quot;&quot; in 1991 to feature the band&#x27;s original vocalist Jon Oliva on lead vocals for all songs after the amicable departure of Zachary Stevens. It is also the first Savatage album to have guitarist Chris Caffery playing the majority of the guitar solos. This is partly due to the departure of Al Pitrelli, who left to join Megadeth prior to the album&#x27;s release. However, Pitrelli was credited with the outro of &quot;Stay With Me Awhile,&quot; the main solo of &quot;Morphine Child,&quot; the main solo of &quot;The Rumor,&quot; and the first part of the main solo and the outro of &quot;Commissar&quot;. The United States bonus track &quot;Shotgun Innocence&quot; was originally a bonus track on the Japanese release of &quot;Edge of Thorns&quot; in 1993 and features Zachary Stevens on lead vocals, and the late Criss Oliva on guitar.

The album cover was drawn by Edgar Jerins, who was responsible for the covers of &quot;Dead Winter Dead&quot; and &quot;The Wake of Magellan&quot;.

<text>.ma is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Morocco (). A local registrar with a local Moroccan company as administrative contact is needed to register a .ma or .co.ma domain name. Further restrictions are imposed on the registering of other second-level domains (such as .net.ma or .gov.ma).

==History==
In 1993, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) approved a request for delegation of the .ma ccTLD for administrative and technical contact to École Mohammadia d&#x27;ingénieurs.

In 1995 the technical management of the .ma domain was taken over by Maroc Telecom, who is still the (not formal) technical maintainer.

On 12 May 2006 IANA redesignated the administrative and technical contact for the domain, and made the &quot;Agence nationale de réglementation des télécommunications&quot; (ANRT) the only official registrar for the .ma ccTLD.

Within some years the ANRT will request the market to bid on a &quot;Technical maintainer&quot; license which is valid for five years. The new party will get 12 months to implement a provisioning system based on Extensible Provisioning Protocol. Automatic provisioning of .ma domains cannot be expected until 2013.

March 2015 the ANRT took official control of .ma and launches new automatic provisioning.

==Practical information==
* Total registered domains under .ma: 118,471 (2024-07-03)
*Total internet users in Morocco: approx. 19,021,000 (2016)
*Total ADSL connection in Morocco: approx. 550,000 (2007)

==Second-level domains==

Registration can be done directly at the second level, or at the third level beneath these names:

* المغرب.: Arabic right-to-left internationalized ccTLD for Morocco; General use
* .ma: General use
* net.ma: Internet providers
* ac.ma: Educational institutions
* org.ma: Organizations
* gov.ma: Governmental entities
* press.ma: Press and publications
* co.ma: Commercial entities

==Second top-level domain==
A second top-level domain will be used for Morocco intended for domain names in the local language using Arabic characters. The string المغرب. has been registered and approved for this purpose, and was delegated to Morocco in April 2011, but it is not yet active (2015) and second level domains have not been granted yet.

<text>.mc is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Principality of Monaco. Registrations are made directly at the second level and require a company registration in Monaco. Registration for individuals is not allowed. Domains need to have a minimum length of 3 characters and no unicode domains are possible.

== History ==
On 28 January 2022 a new domain name charter was published; since then all SLDs are retired and no new registrations are allowed for:
* .tm.mc
* .asso.mc
* .dentiste.mc
* .consul.mc
* .experts-comptables.mc
* .comptables-agrees.mc
* .architectes.mc
* .avocat.mc
* .notaire.mc.
Existing domains in these zones continue to function.

On 1 March 2022 the registry introduced a registrar model and domains can only be registered by registrars since then.

<doc id="1237575" wikidata="Q4804328" url="?curid=1237575" title="Ash, Dover District">
<text>Ash is a village and civil parish in the Dover district of east Kent about three miles west of Sandwich.

The civil parish has a population of 2,767, increasing to 3,365 at the 2011 Census, and includes the villages of Ash, Westmarsh, Ware, Hoaden and Richborough. The Ash Level, by the River Stour, takes up the northern part of the parish.

==History==
Ash was once on the main thoroughfare from Canterbury to the channel port of Sandwich. It takes its name from the Old English æsc (ash) and shows its toponymy in its first recorded form, Æsce, in about 1100.

A variation may be Esch in 1418.

Ash was once part of the Royal manor of Wingham and having been given to the See of Canterbury in 850 AD by King Athelstan, it became a separate parish in 1282, one of the largest in Kent at that time.

The Harflete or Harfleet family were Lords of the Manor for many years. The family died out in the late seventeenth century.

The Grade I listed parish church, is dedicated to St Nicholas and probably built on the site of an earlier Saxon church, dates partly from the 12th century and has a 15th-century tower with a lead spire (once used as a navigation aid for ships), which now houses a ring of ten bells. It also has the best collection of medieval monumental effigies in Kent, including one to Jane Kerriel (c. 1455) which reveals a unique horseshoe head-dress.

Ash is known for its market gardens, and at one time had its own brewery and organ maker. There are two vineyards nearby.

There are many medieval buildings in the village, including &#x27;Molland House&#x27; which is named as a &quot;Historic Building of Kent&quot; and eleven of the twelve original manor houses. In the same lane are a number of Tudor cottages. &quot;The Chequer Inn&quot; began life as a timber-framed hall house, dating from about 1500.

From 1916 to 1948 it had a station (&quot;Ash Town&quot;) on the East Kent Light Railway, one of Colonel Stephens&#x27; lines, which ran between Shepherdswell and Wingham.

== Notable features ==
The village has a primary school (named Cartwright and Kelsey), a prep school (named St Faiths), doctors&#x27; surgery and several corner shops.

The village is also on the Miner&#x27;s Way Trail. The trail links up the coalfield parishes of East Kent.

<doc id="1237578" wikidata="Q40324" url="?curid=1237578" title=".md">
<text>.md is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Moldova introduced on March 24, 1994.

The price of domain registration is 450 lei or US$39 (including VAT) per year.

The TLD is currently administered by STISC (Service for Information Technology and Cyber Security); before being merged into STISC, the Moldovan state company MoldData had an exclusive agreement to administer and distribute domain names within the .MD domain.

== Second-level domain names ==
The official regulations list a number of second-level domain names for official state and local government use, as well as a list of generic second-level domain names:
* – Commercial entities
* – Private limited companies
* – Publicly traded companies
* – Companies which offer Internet services
* – Other organizations, including NGOs and not-for-profit organizations
* – Academic and educational institutions

.com.md, .org.md, .info.md, and .pro.md third-level domain names can be registered via MoldData for US$12.

==History==

The establishment of the .md TLD was approved in March 1994 by the University of Southern California&#x27;s Information Sciences Institute (IANA&#x27;s predecessor). The first Moldovan Internet server, mdearn.md, became operational on January 1, 1994. In May 1995, .md was fully delegated to RCI (the Moldovan Republican Centre for Informatics, established September 1, 1993).

In 1998, RCI entered into a contractual agreement with Domain Name Trust, a US-based company, granting it the rights to operate and oversee the TLD. Domain Name Trust then proceeded to sell its rights to operate .md to DotMD, a US-based LLC, which went bankrupt in October 2002. During the resulting bankruptcy court proceedings, authority over .md was ordered to be returned to the state of Moldova in February 2003.

RCI was renamed into MoldData on 12 July 2001, formalizing its transformation and succession on 19 September. On 30 August 2019, by order of the Moldovan government, MoldData was absorbed into STISC (Service for Information Technology and Cyber Security), which took over the responsibility of the national registrar for the .md TLD.

In November 2007, the number of domains registered under the .md TLD reached 12,000.

<text>The Battle of Tel El Kebir (often spelled Tel-El-Kebir) was fought on 13 September 1882 at Tell El Kebir in Egypt, 110 km north-north-east of Cairo. An entrenched Egyptian force under the command of Ahmed ʻUrabi was defeated by a British army led by Garnet Wolseley, in a sudden assault preceded by a march under cover of darkness. The battle was the decisive engagement of the Anglo-Egyptian War.

==Background==
===Bombardment and invasion of Alexandria===

On May 20, 1882, a combined Franco–British fleet arrived at Alexandria. At the same time, Egyptian troops were reinforcing the coastal defenses of the city in anticipation of an attack. These events heightened tension in Alexandria, and eventually triggered tumultuous rioting with loss of life on both sides. As a result of the riots, an ultimatum was sent to the Egyptian government demanding they order Urabi&#x27;s officers in Alexandria to dismantle their coastal defence batteries. The Egyptian government refused. Meanwhile, tension increased between Britain and France over the crisis, as most of the losses had been non-French, the principal European beneficiaries of the revolution would be the French. Thus, the French government refused to support this ultimatum and decided against armed intervention.

When the ultimatum was ignored, Admiral Seymour gave the order for the Royal Navy to bombard the Egyptian gun emplacements at Alexandria. On July 11 at 7:00 am, the first shell was fired on Fort Adda by and by 7:10, the entire fleet was engaged. The coastal defenses returned fire soon after, with minimal effect and minimal casualties to the British fleet. No British ships were sunk. On July 13, a large naval force landed in the city. Despite heavy resistance from the garrison for several hours, the overwhelming firepower of the smaller British forces eventually forced the Egyptian troops to withdraw from the city.

==Prelude==

Lieutenant General Garnet Wolseley was placed in charge of a large force with the aim of destroying Urabi&#x27;s regime and restoring the nominal authority of the Khedive Tawfiq. The total force was 24,000 British troops, which concentrated in Malta and Cyprus, and a force of 7,000 Indian troops which staged through Aden.

Wolseley first tried to reach Cairo directly from Alexandria. &#x27;Urabi deployed his troops at Kafr El Dawwar between Cairo and Alexandria and prepared very substantial defences. There, attacks by British troops were repelled for five weeks at the Battle of Kafr El Dawwar.

===Securing the canal===
Wolseley then decided to approach Cairo from a different route. He resolved to attack from the direction of the Suez canal. &#x27;Urabi knew that Wolseley&#x27;s only other approach to Cairo was from the canal, and he wanted to block it. Ferdinand de Lesseps, upon knowing of Urabi&#x27;s intentions, assured him the British would never risk damaging the canal, and would avoid involving it in operations at all costs according to Lutsky, he even &quot;gave his word of honour to Urabi not to permit the landing of British troops in the Canal Zone, and Urabi trusted de Lesseps. By so doing, Urabi committed a grave military and political mistake&quot;. &#x27;Urabi listened to his advice and did not block the canal, leaving it open for an invasion by British forces.

When Wolseley had arrived at Alexandria on 15 August he immediately began to organise the movement of troops through the Suez Canal to Ismaïlia. This was accomplished so quickly, Ismailia was occupied on 20 August without resistance.

Ismailia was quickly reinforced with 9,000 troops, with the engineers put to work repairing the railway line from Suez. A small force was pushed along the Sweet Water Canal to the Kassassin lock arriving on 26 August.

===Egyptian attack at Kassassin===
&#x27;Urabi attempted to repel the advance and attacked the British forces near Kassassin on 28 August. The British troops were caught by surprise, as they did not expect an attack. Fighting was intense but the two British battalions, with their 4 artillery pieces, held their position.

The British Heavy Cavalry, composed of the Household Cavalry and the 7th Dragoon Guards had been following the infantry and were encamped away. When the cavalry arrived, the British went onto the offensive and causing heavy casualties on the Egyptians, forced them to retreat .

A further attack by Egyptian forces at Kassassin was repulsed and the Egyptians retired to their lines to build defences.

===Capture of Mahmoud Fehmy===
At around the same time as the first battle at Kassassin, the British scored a major success with the capture of the Egyptian chief military engineer, General Mahmoud Fehmy. The exact circumstances of his capture are unclear - according to one account, he had changed into civilian clothes due to the heat, and had gone for a walk accompanied by only one other officer when he was ambushed by a group of British cavalrymen. The loss of Fehmy was &quot;a blow to the defence of Tel-el-Kebir for which there was no remedy&quot;, for the highly-regarded General had only recently arrived to oversee the construction of fortifications at the site.

==Battle==
&#x27;Urabi had redeployed to defend Cairo against Wolseley. His main force dug in at Tel El Kebir, north of the railway and the Sweetwater Canal, both of which linked Cairo to Ismailia on the canal. The defences were hastily prepared, but included trenches and redoubts. Urabi&#x27;s forces possessed 60 pieces of artillery and breech loading rifles. Wolseley made several personal reconnaissances, and determined that the Egyptians did not man outposts in front of their main defences at night, which made it possible for an attacking force to approach the defences under cover of darkness. Rather than make an outflanking movement around Urabi&#x27;s entrenchments, which would involve a long march through waterless desert, or undertake formal bombardment and assault, Wolseley planned to approach the position by night and attack frontally at dawn, hoping to achieve surprise.

Wolseley began his advance from Ismailia on the night of 12 September, with two infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade. A brigade of Indian troops covered the flank on the southern bank of the Sweetwater Canal. The approach march of the main forces was made easier because the desert west of Kassassin was almost flat and unobstructed, making it look like a gigantic parade ground. Even though there were repeated halts to maintain dressing and alignment, the British troops reached the Egyptian position at the time Wolseley intended.

At 5:45 a.m. Wolseley&#x27;s troops were six hundred yards from the entrenchments and dawn was just breaking, when Egyptian sentries saw them and fired. The first shots were followed by multiple volleys from the entrenchments and by the artillery. British troops, led by the Highland Brigade on the left flank, and the 2nd Brigade on the right flank with the Guards Brigade (commanded by Queen Victoria&#x27;s third son, Prince Arthur, the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn) in support, charged with the bayonet.

The British advance was shielded from view by the smoke from the Egyptian artillery and rifles. Arriving in the trenches at the same time, all along the line, the resulting battle was over within an hour. Most of the Egyptian soldiers were tired from having stood on the alert all night. Because of the haste with which Urabi&#x27;s forces had prepared their defences, there were no obstacles in front of them to disrupt the attackers. Several groups stood and fought, mainly the Sudanese troops in the front of the Highland Brigade, but those not overwhelmed in the first rush were forced to retreat. In the end, it was a crushing defeat for the Egyptians. Official British figures gave a total of 57 British troops killed. Approximately two thousand Egyptians died. The British army had more casualties due to heatstroke than enemy action.

British cavalry pursued the broken enemy towards Cairo, which was undefended. Power was then restored to the khedive, the war was at an end and the majority of the British Army went to Alexandria and took ship for home, leaving from November, just an army of occupation.

Lieutenant William Mordaunt Marsh Edwards was awarded a Victoria Cross for his gallantry during the battle.

<text>.mh is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Marshall Islands. Its registry website has been inactive since the end of 2021, and prior to that had not been updated since 1997. The mechanism of registering domains listed on that site involved downloading an InterNIC template form that had been a dead link for at least several years. 

, a search showed three active websites using a .mh domain: one for the government&#x27;s Natural Disaster Management Office, one for the school system, and one for a telecommunications company. The Natural Disaster Management Office website went offline a year later. In 2022, the Office of Commerce, Investment &amp; Tourism created a site under the domain, but moved to .org in late 2023. The same year, Wahoo, a store based in Majuro, opened a website under the domain.

Most of the people who govern a site from the Marshall Islands usually register it under .com, .net or .org. Almost all sites registered to entities in the Marshall Islands are hosted in other countries.

<text>.ml is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Mali.

== History ==
The domain was initially managed by Sotelma, a Malian telecommunications company. After Sotelma was privatised in 2009, the .ml zone was redelegated by IANA to the Agence des Technologies de l’Information et de la Communication (AGETIC), a Malian government agency, and the process completed in 2013. The agency then announced that it would give away &quot;.ml&quot; domains for free in partnership with Freenom with a view to improve the usage and the knowledge of the IT industry in Mali. It was the first African nation to start giving away domains for free. The ten-year contract with Freenom expired on 17 July 2023. Since then the registry is operated by AGETIC itself and the free domain offer was discontinued. All paid Freenom .ml domains were migrated to the new system.

== Second-level domains ==
Registrations are possible at the second level and at the third level beneath these names:

* .com.ml: Companies
* .net.ml: Internet providers
* .org.ml: Associations (must show registration); international organizations permitted, but must be registered with the local administration
* .edu.ml: Local schools
* .presse.ml: Local press
* .gov.ml: Governmental organisations
Domain names of between one and three characters are considered premium domain names with a higher price.

== Military emails ==
Employees for the United States Armed Forces regularly misspell emails—suffixed with the .mil TLD—with .ml. In 2013, Dutch internet entrepreneur Johannes Zuurbier took on the .ml TLD. He attempted to contact the United States government about classified information being sent to army.ml and navy.ml in 2014 through Dutch diplomats. The contents of these emails include crew and staff lists, maps and photos of installations, naval inspection reports, and passwords. Emails that were sent to the .ml TLD include the travel itinerary of chief of staff James McConville on a trip to Indonesia in 2023, information about Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party efforts in the United States, and Australian Department of Defence documents detailing issues with Australian F-35s . On 17 July 2023, Zuurbier&#x27;s contract expired and control was reverted back to the Malian government.

<text>Odakkali, located at 10.09 North and 76.54 Eastis a village in the Perumbavoor Ernakulam district of Kerala State, in southern India. Odakkali is 26.8 km away from Aluva in Aluva Munnar Road.

==Temple==
The Kallil Temple is 2 km away from Odakkali.

==Research station==
The Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Research Station
 of Kerala Agricultural University is located at Odakkali. This research station has attracted international attention in the field of aromatic technology. It has identified sources of rose aroma, which are less expensive and are of great demand in the perfume industry. The Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Research Station was established in 1951 as &#x27;Lemon Grass Breeding Station&#x27; under the Department of Agriculture of the erstwhile Travancore- Cochin government. Later, it was brought under the direct administrative control of the Associate Director of Research (Central Region) of the Kerala Agricultural University in 1982 and was renamed the Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Research Station (AMPRS). The United Nations Industrial Development Organization directs entrepreneurs to this centre for advice regarding their research and development needs on lemongrass.

===Herbs===
The Research Station has been recognized at the national level as one of the leading centres for research on aromatic plants. Scientists here have identified two herbs rich in geranyl acetate, giving off the smell of rope. They are found in the hills of Munnar and Thathamangalam near Palakkad. OD 468 is the technical name of the plant identified at Munnar and OD 455 of the one at Thathamangalam. &#x27;OD&#x27; stands for Odakkali, the place where the Institute is located. Studies have revealed that the average yield of the variety was nearly 10 tonnes of herbage per harvest. Hydro-distillation of the leaf produced 0.4 percent of essential oils and 79.8 percent of geranyl acetate.

===Lemongrass===
The most significant contribution of AMPRS is the &#x27;Sugandhi&#x27; (OD19), a variety of lemongrass of high yield and quality. It has been nationally accepted as the most significant variety of East Indian lemongrass. Diverse soil and climatic conditions ranging from hot, humid tropics of Kerala to sub-tropical conditions of sub-Himalayan regions have not been unfavourable to its growth. A prized collection of 450 varieties of this species of India and abroad can be found in this Institute. 
A great deal has been done by the institute for the conservation of aromatic plants. A phytochemical laboratory upgraded to regional Analytical Laboratory for medicinal and aromatic plants has been established. It is sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India.

===Herbal garden===
The station has a herbal garden comprising 350 species of medicinal herbs. The garden serves the purpose of providing genuine plant species used in indigenous systems of medicine, conserving and propagating endangered species, educating and demonstrating as well as functioning as a reference centre. The farm also has provision for cultivating around 15 species of medicinal herbs. A nursery centre contains planting parts like seeds of medicinal herbs, which are distributed among cultivators. Demands for these come in from all over the country from Jammu to Kanyakumari to the Bay of Bengal to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is a matter of pride for the Kerala Agricultural University that the station has found a place in the world seeds catalogue of the F.A.O.

<text>In machine learning, the delta rule is a gradient descent learning rule for updating the weights of the inputs to artificial neurons in a single-layer neural network. It can be derived as the backpropagation algorithm for a single-layer neural network with mean-square error loss function.

For a neuron formula_1 with activation function formula_2, the delta rule for neuron formula_1&#x27;s formula_4-th weight formula_5 is given by

formula_6

where
* formula_7 is a small constant called &quot;learning rate&quot;
* formula_2 is the neuron&#x27;s activation function
* formula_9 is the derivative of formula_10
* formula_11 is the target output
* formula_12 is the weighted sum of the neuron&#x27;s inputs
* formula_13 is the actual output
* formula_14 is the formula_4-th input.

It holds that formula_16 and formula_17.

The delta rule is commonly stated in simplified form for a neuron with a linear activation function as 
formula_18 

While the delta rule is similar to the perceptron&#x27;s update rule, the derivation is different. The perceptron uses the Heaviside step function as the activation function formula_19, and that means that formula_20 does not exist at zero, and is equal to zero elsewhere, which makes the direct application of the delta rule impossible.

==Derivation of the delta rule==
The delta rule is derived by attempting to minimize the error in the output of the neural network through gradient descent. The error for a neural network with formula_1 outputs can be measured as 
formula_22

In this case, we wish to move through &quot;weight space&quot; of the neuron (the space of all possible values of all of the neuron&#x27;s weights) in proportion to the gradient of the error function with respect to each weight. In order to do that, we calculate the partial derivative of the error with respect to each weight. For the formula_4th weight, this derivative can be written as 
formula_24

Because we are only concerning ourselves with the formula_1-th neuron, we can substitute the error formula above while omitting the summation:
formula_26

Next we use the chain rule to split this into two derivatives:
formula_27

To find the left derivative, we simply apply the power rule and the chain rule:
formula_28

To find the right derivative, we again apply the chain rule, this time differentiating with respect to the total input to formula_1, formula_12:
formula_31

Note that the output of the formula_32th neuron, formula_13, is just the neuron&#x27;s activation function formula_34 applied to the neuron&#x27;s input formula_12. We can therefore write the derivative of formula_13 with respect to formula_12 simply as formula_34&#x27;s first derivative:
formula_39

Next we rewrite formula_12 in the last term as the sum over all formula_41 weights of each weight formula_42 times its corresponding input formula_43:
formula_44

Because we are only concerned with the formula_4th weight, the only term of the summation that is relevant is formula_46. Clearly, 
formula_47
giving us our final equation for the gradient:
formula_48

As noted above, gradient descent tells us that our change for each weight should be proportional to the gradient. Choosing a proportionality constant formula_7 and eliminating the minus sign to enable us to move the weight in the negative direction of the gradient to minimize error, we arrive at our target equation:
formula_50

<text>.mp is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Northern Mariana Islands. There are a few sites related to the Northern Mariana Islands in this domain (such as governmental sites under .gov.mp and a few sites in .org.mp and .co.mp). The get.mp site allows users to register and manage .mp domains. The .mp name comes from ISO 3166 which specifies MP as the two letter designation for the Northern Mariana Islands.

== Official registry site ==
Domain name registry services for .mp domains are operated by Saipan DataCom, a local ISP. Domains with four or more characters may be purchased for $20. Premium domains under four characters range in price, with two-character domains running $5,000 for a three-year registration. There are some sites related to the Northern Mariana Islands under third-level domains .gov.mp and .co.mp.

== Whois services ==
The MP Domain does not have public whois services available. Saipan DataCom will provide whois data in cases of potential trademark infringement. Although ICANN documents specify whois.nic.mp as of July 2018 this host does not resolve.

==Chi.mp==
Saipan DataCom formerly operated chi.mp, a content hub and identity management platform providing .mp domains and websites. Old free .mp registrations provided earlier by chi.mp were terminated without a notice and the chi.mp web site has been defunct since at least May 2013. As of August 2021 get.mp is offering chi.mp for sale for $20,000.00. Mailchimp uses .mp as a domain hack (mailchi.mp) to redirect to its main website.

<text>.mr is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Mauritania.

.mr domains can be registered by Mauritanian citizens, residents, and legal entities with a local representation.

==History==
The management of the Internet Top-Level-Domain Names in Mauritania was delegated by ICANN to the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST) of the University of Nouakchott in April 1996. As the country was not connected to the internet at that time, IRD (Montpellier, France) hosted the .mr name servers.

Once the required infrastructure is established by April 2000, Network Information Center was created within the Faculty of Science and Technology and started hosting the .mr name servers.

==Structure==
Registrations are taken directly at the second level, under .mr. However, a number of second level domains exists for different purposes.

==Internationalized domain name==
On 27 January 2019, ICANN approved a request for delegation of the internationalised country-code top-level domain representing Mauritania in Arabic script to Université de Nouakchott Al Aasriya. As of December 2022, no information regarding the registration under this TLD is available on the registry website.

<text>Tāne Mahuta, also called &quot;God of the Forest&quot;, is a giant kauri tree (&quot;Agathis australis&quot;) in the Waipoua Forest of Northland Region, New Zealand. Its age is unknown but is estimated to be between 1,250 and 2,500 years. It is the largest living kauri tree known to stand today. It is named after Tāne, the Māori god of forests and of birds.

The tree is a remnant of the ancient subtropical rainforest that once grew on the Northland Peninsula. Other giant kauri are found nearby, notably Te Matua Ngahere. Tāne Mahuta is the most famous tree in New Zealand, along with Te Matua Ngahere. It was discovered and identified in early January 1924 when contractors surveyed the present State Highway 12 route through the forest. In 1928, Nicholas Yakas and other bushmen, who were building the road, also identified the tree.

In April 2009, Tāne Mahuta was formally partnered with the tree Jōmon Sugi on Yakushima Island, Japan.

During the New Zealand drought of 2013, 10,000 litres of water from a nearby stream was diverted to Tāne Mahuta, which was showing signs of dehydration.

In 2018, the tree was considered threatened by kauri dieback, a generally fatal disease caused by a fungus which has already infected many nearby kauri trees.
New Zealand&#x27;s Department of Conservation initiated a plan to protect and save the tree from kauri dieback.

== Measurements ==

The measurements above were taken in 2002 by Dr. Robert Van Pelt, a forest ecology researcher and affiliate assistant professor at the University of Washington. Former measurements taken in 1971 by the New Zealand Forestry Service may be found on The New Zealand Tree Register.

== Name ==

In 2012, Lady Davina Lewis, daughter of Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester and Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester, and her husband, the New Zealander Gary Lewis, named their son Tane Mahuta, after the tree.

<doc id="1237638" wikidata="Q214811" url="?curid=1237638" title="Argeș (river)">
<text>The Argeș () is a river in Southern Romania, a left tributary of the Danube. It is long, and its basin area is . Its source is in the Făgăraș Mountains, in the Southern Carpathians and it flows into the Danube at Oltenița. Its average discharge at the mouth is .

The main city on the Argeș is Pitești. Upstream, it is retained by the Vidraru Dam, which has created Lake Vidraru. Its upper course, upstream of Lake Vidraru, is also called &quot;Capra&quot;.

==Name==
The river is believed to be the same as Ὀρδησσός &quot;Ordessus&quot;, a name mentioned by Ancient Greek historian Herodotus. The etymology of Argeș is not clear. Traditionally, it was considered that it is derived from the ancient name, through a reconstructed term, *&quot;Argessis&quot;. The capital of Dacian leader Burebista was named &quot;Argedava&quot;, but it appears that it has no link with the name for the river.

An alternate etymology derives the name of the river from a Pecheneg word, transliterated into Romanian as &quot;argiș&quot; (meaning &quot;higher ground&quot;). The earliest recorded variants of the name, referring to the city of Curtea de Argeș (lit. &quot;The Court on the Argeș&quot;), also suggest a derivation from this word: &quot;Argyas&quot; (1369), &quot;Argies&quot; (1379), &quot;Arghiș&quot; (1427), the river probably taking the name of the city. 

==Localities==
The following localities are situated along the river Argeș, from source to mouth: Căpățânenii Ungureni, Căpățânenii Pământeni, Arefu, Poienarii de Argeș, Corbeni, Rotunda, Albeștii de Argeș, Curtea de Argeș, Băiculești, Merișani, Bascov, Pitești, Găești, Bolintin-Deal, Adunații-Copăceni, and Oltenița.

==Hydro energy==
The river Argeș and some of its tributaries are used for hydro energy. The hydroelectrical system consists of several dams, lakes, tunnels and power plants. The lakes built on the Argeș River are: Vidraru, Oiești, Cerbureni, Curtea de Argeș, Zigoneni, Merișani, Budeasa, Bascov, Pitești, Călinești (or Golești), Zăvoiu (near Mătăsaru), Ogrezeni and Mihăilești. There are dams also on its tributaries.

==Tributaries==
The following rivers are tributaries to the river Argeș (from source to mouth):
*Left tributaries: Braia, Mândra, Buda, Valea cu Pești, Valea Lupului, Berindești, Valea Iașului, Sasu, Vâlsan, Râul Doamnei, Vrănești, Râncăciov, Cârcinov, Budișteanca, Sabar, Dâmbovița, Rasa, and Luica.
*Right tributaries: Paltinul, Lespezi, Modrugaz, Cumpăna, Valea lui Stan, Arefu, Bănești (Cicănești), Valea Danului, Tutana, Schiau, Bascov and Neajlov.

<text>.mu is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Mauritius. It is administered by the Mauritius Network Information Centre and registrations are processed via accredited registrars. Some registrars market it as the .music and .museum TLD.

== Usage ==
A number of musical groups have started to use this domain, with .mu being used to indicate music. Some examples are the rock band Athlete, the country band Lonestar, the British progressive rock bands Muse and Pendragon, the New Age musical project Amethystium and the 80s influenced hardcore metal band Blessed By A Broken Heart. In addition, the UK-based record label Planet Mu also uses the .mu domain, with the .mu forming the second half of the label&#x27;s name. The world&#x27;s largest direct seller of musical instruments, (Musician&#x27;s Friend), also uses a .mu URL (frnd.mu) as a link shortener for several of their social media channels, including Twitter. The French webpage for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (Radio-Canada) uses the .mu domain for its Music network&#x27;s web-only personalised music streams.

== Recent events ==
In 2009, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Internet Direct and the Government of Mauritius. In 2012, the agreement was not renewed by the Ministry of IT. In July 2013, Internet Direct Limited stated that they would no longer provide services to the Government of Mauritius unless the arrears for domain name registrations and renewals are settled. The National Computer Board of Mauritius refused to pay, claiming that it should be free because they are the Government.

The Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA Mauritius) published a consultation paper in September 2011 and April 2012, with a view to forcing a re-delegation. At the public consultation meeting held on 12 April 2012, the international consultant informed ICTA that their proposal was clumsy and the Government does not have a case for re-delegation, because their proposed model is inappropriate and no proposal will be possible without working together with the current sponsoring organization &quot;Internet Direct Ltd&quot;.

In October 2014, the portal of the government of Mauritius was no longer accessible outside the Orange network. Orange is a subsidiary of Mauritius Telecom, the state-owned telecom operator. Various IT experts including staff of AfriNIC, Google and the local Linux Group found that the DNS servers set up by Orange contained incorrect entries, thereby hiding from the Mauritius public the true situation when in fact the services were already disconnected. The Ministry of Information and Communication Technology of Mauritius was not aware of the issue. All the websites hosted on the gov.mu domain name were no longer accessible. It turned out that the Government, despite numerous extensions given to settle the renewal fees, still did not pay for the services and requested the Supreme Court to order Internet Direct Ltd to provide the service for free in perpetuity. Both the Ministry of IT and Internet Direct Ltd have declined to provide any comments about the matter, since the case was still being disputed in court.

In January 2015, the Government formally withdrew their case against Internet Direct Ltd and are in discussion for an amicable settlement for the amount owed by the Government. There has been several meetings since between the various advisers.

<doc id="1237643" wikidata="Q1540200" url="?curid=1237643" title="Te Matua Ngahere">
<text>Te Matua Ngahere is a giant kauri (&quot;Agathis australis&quot;) coniferous tree in the Waipoua Forest of Northland Region, New Zealand. The tree&#x27;s Māori name means &quot;Father of the Forest&quot;. Although not as massive or tall as its neighbour Tāne Mahuta, Te Matua Ngahere is stouter, with a girth just over . It is believed to be the second largest living kauri tree, and to have the biggest girth of any kauri in the country. According to &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, it has the biggest girth of any tree in New Zealand.

As there is no means of reliably measuring the tree&#x27;s age, it has been variously estimated to be between 1,200 and 2,000 years old; or between 2,000 and 3,000 years old; or even 4,000 years old. One resource, published by National Geographic Books, claims that Te Matua Ngahere may be the oldest tree in New Zealand, while another suggests that it is the oldest rainforest tree on Earth.

Greatly revered by the Māori, Te Matua Ngahere is watched over by many local Māori Guardians. The tree, a remnant of the ancient rainforest that once grew on the North Auckland Peninsula, has a relationship with other flora, such as orchids, clubmoss, and a rata tree that grew on it. Unfortunately, the Te Matua Ngahere suffered severe damage in July 2007, due to extreme winter storms in Northland when the rata, which was growing on top of Te Matua Ngahere, was felled by strong storm winds, and took with it the central leader of Te Matua Ngahere plus several of its branches, thus shortening its expected lifespan by hundreds of years.

==History==

The ancient tree is considered to be a natural heritage of New Zealand. It is generally considered to be over 1500 years old, and was first discovered in February 1937. Forest conservationists estimate that such trees live for about 4000 years, but the life span of Te Matua Ngahere should shorten due to the damage from the 2007 storm winds. This storm also resulted in the fallen rata tree and other plants which are expected to provide excellent clues to the scientific ecological study of the fallen wood and plants.

==Geography==
The Te Matua Ngahere is situated in the Waipoua forest reserve, next to contiguous forest tracts of Mataraua and Waima, an area of international significance. These forests are within the largest residual region of the native forests in Northland of New Zealand. The nearest populated place is Wekaweka at a distance of .

The tree is well situated in an open space clearing. It is approached from State Highway 12 through the Waipoua Forest up to the car park, close to the site of the tree. From this point, a winding walk of about 20 minutes along a well-maintained track, surfaced with boardwalks, has marked signs leading directly to the Te Matua Ngahere. The boardwalks protect tree roots from being subjected to human feet. As the roots of the kauri tree are sensitive to frequent trampling by foot, it is advisable to avoid walking over the roots to ensure the long life of the trees.

The walk through the tract gives an educative exposure to the rich variety of tree species of genuine kauri, mixed podocarp, and several varieties of plants. The plants that are seen in abundance belong to the kauri grass, kiekie, neinei and ferns. A viewing tower provides excellent vistas of the rich forest cover. This ancient tree is stated to be the mother of 50 species of trees which grow on it. The largest tree in this forest reserve is Tāne Mahuta, which is named after the Māori god of the forests. It is situated further north of the Te Matua Ngahere. Though very high, it is not as striking as the Te Matua Ngahere which has a larger girth. Nearby is a cluster of four trees growing close together known as “Four Sisters”.

;Waipoua forest reserve
The largest kauris and the largest area of intact kauri forest are found in the Waipoua forest. Waipoua forest was declared a sanctuary in 1952 to stop logging operations. It is stated to be the largest remnant of the extensive kauri forests of northern New Zealand. It is here that Te Matua Ngahere is located. An road runs through the forest passing medium-sized mature kauri high girth trees. A toatoa point here provides excellent views of the forest. The Park Visitor Information Centre disseminates information on the “Kauri trees, gum industry and native birds and other wild life.” The car park from where the Te Matua Ngahere could be approached through a track is about from the Visitor Information Centre.

==Measurements==

The reticulated trunk, which is about 16.41/pi or in diameter, hardly tapers an inch in the area between a man&#x27;s chest height and the next 10 metres, although some books may confuse these figures (e.g. 50 feet.). With an estimated volume of , it is stated to have the second biggest trunk by volume; however, the biggest tree by volume is the Tāne Mahuta, which is also in the Waipoua Forest with a volume of . Its measurements are listed in the table below.

Important note: all the measurements above were taken in 1971. The most recent measurements may be found on the New Zealand Tree Register.

==Tourism==
The tree attracts about 50,000 visitors every year. To help prevent the spread of the kauri dieback disease, &quot;Phytophthora agathidicida&quot;, tourists must clean their footwear at a wash station before and after visiting the bush, and keep to the tracks.

<text>.na is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Namibia corresponding to the two letter code from the ISO-3166 standard.

The registry accredits both Namibian and foreign registrars. Registrars access the Registry and register domains using either a web-based GUI or the industry standard EPP protocol.

The domain was established on 8 May 1991. The ccTLD manager is NA-NiC (Namibian Network Information Centre). The Namibian Parliament passed a Communications Act in 2009 containing various provisions regarding the ccTLD; however, as of the end of 2017, they had not yet entered into force.

Registrations are available at both the second level or at the third level beneath various names that include some apparently redundant choices (e.g., both .co.na and .com.na for commercial entities).

== Domain registration costs ==

Domain registration prices to the end-user are now set by registrars in competition with each other. Wholesale prices (the cost to the registrars) depend on the level at which a registration is made (i.e. whether at second-level or a third-level registration) and also whether the registrant is domestic or foreign. The second-level is considered &#x27;premium&#x27;, so the cheapest domains would be a registration by a local organisation at third-level (such as the NamNumbers telephone directory at TELECOM.COM.NA) whilst the highest prices are paid by non-Namibian entities registering at the second-level (such as BRITISHCOUNCIL.NA).

NA-NiC is a member of the Council of Country Code Administrators and uses their Dispute Resolution.

== Secure DNS ==

.na is an early adopter of the Domain Name System Security Extensions, with the .na root zone having been signed with DNSSEC since 1 September 2009.

<text>Louis Joshua Washkansky (12 April 1912 – 21 December 1967) was a South African man who was the recipient of the world&#x27;s first human-to-human heart transplant, and the first patient to regain consciousness following the operation. Washkansky lived for 18 days and was able to speak with his wife and reporters.

Washkansky was the second human recipient of a heart transplant overall, in that James Hardy had done a transplant in 1964 in which Boyd Rush received a chimpanzee&#x27;s heart, although the patient in that case only survived an hour and did not regain consciousness.

==Biography==
Washkansky was a Lithuanian Jew, the youngest of the four children of Abe Washkansky and his wife, Chana Yentel Kemelgor. In 1912, when Washkansky was three months old, his father emigrated to South Africa without his family and started a business as a produce merchant. As a result of World War I and its aftermath, Chana and the children were not able to re-unite with Abe in Cape Town until 1923. Washkansky attended Cape Town High School, where he passed the standard eight, before entering the grocery business in Cape Town. He saw active service in World War II in East and North Africa and Italy.

Washkansky was an avid sportsman. He took part in football, swimming, and weightlifting. Later on in life, he suffered heart problems and required a heart transplant.

==Medical background==
Washkansky&#x27;s health declined substantially: he was diabetic, and had an incurable heart disease, causing him to suffer three heart attacks. The last of these heart attacks led to congestive heart failure.

In April 1966, Washkansky visited Groote Schuur Hospital due to his pre-existing illness. He was first seen by Barry Kaplan, who in July 1966 had asked if Christiaan Barnard would be willing to treat Washkansky. Barnard had performed a number of laboratory tests and an in-depth examination on Washkansky and came to the conclusion that nothing could be done to help him. In January 1967, Washkansky was referred to Mervyn Gotsman, a cardiologist at the Cardiac Clinic in Groote Schuur Hospital, due to refractory heart failure. Washkansky underwent cardiac catheterisation confirming severe heart failure, and was subsequently referred to Barnard for possible surgery.

Washkansky was re-admitted to Groote Schuur on 14 September 1967, which was also the Jewish New Year. As a result of heart attacks in 1965, approximately only one third of his heart was still functioning. In late October, he went into a diabetic coma, but regained consciousness. Once, when he was swollen with fluid and in considerable pain, his wife Ann asked him in a whisper how he was doing. He managed a smile and whispered, &quot;I&#x27;m on top of the world.&quot; He was also suffering from kidney and liver failure. On 10 November, Val Schrire put forward Washkansky as a possible heart transplant candidate.

When Barnard met with Washkansky, Barnard explained the possibility of a transplant and Washkansky was agreeable to the possibility. Afterwards, Ann found her husband Louis to be &quot;oddly buoyant.&quot; When Barnard later explained the possibility of a transplant to both of them, the idea was so new that Ann initially worried her husband might absorb some of the personality of the donor heart. Barnard stated to Ann and Louis Washkansky that the proposed transplant had an 80% chance of success, which has been criticised as &quot;misleading&quot;. Part of the pre-op procedure was to take swabs from Washkansky&#x27;s skin, nose, mouth, throat, and rectum to find out what bacteria lived on and in his body, so that the most effective antibiotics could be given after the transplant. He was also frequently washed down with Phisohex.

==Potential transplant in November 1967==
In late November 1967, a potential donor was identified. A young black man had fallen off a truck and suffered a catastrophic head injury. Although the Chief of Cardiology, Val Schrire, had previously expressed a strong preference to avoid a &quot;coloured&quot; donor, police approached the young man&#x27;s family for permission for him to be a heart donor. McRae writes that the family was &quot;in shock after they were confronted by a policeman&quot;. The EKG of the donor heart, however, showed depressed ST segments, meaning that it might have been damaged or was not receiving enough oxygenated blood and gave the reluctant Val Schrire a medical reason not to continue with the transplant of a &quot;coloured&quot; donor heart in apartheid South Africa. Washkansky, who had been cleaned and shaved for the possible attempt, felt let down and disappointed when it did not go forward. He felt his future chances were slim.

==Operation and outcome==
Washkansky received his heart transplant on 3 December 1967, at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. The operation lasted approximately six hours, beginning at 01:00, with Christiaan Barnard leading a team of thirty surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and technicians. His brother Marius Barnard assisted with the surgery.

25-year-old Denise Darvall and her mother had been struck by a drunk driver while crossing a busy street on a Saturday afternoon. Her mother died at the scene. Denise was taken to Groote Schuur. Peter Rose-Innis, the hospital&#x27;s senior neurosurgeon, attended to her. A skull X-ray showed two serious fractures. She showed no sign of pain when ice water was poured in her ear. In addition, her brain had no sign of electrical activity. A blood transfusion and respirator maintained the beat of her heart. Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman were the doctors who approached Denise&#x27;s father Edward Darvall and asked for permission to use her heart for a possible transplant. He had been at the scene of the original accident and had been sedated after being brought to the hospital. As he waited, he thought they were still trying to save his daughter&#x27;s life. Bosman told him there was a man in the hospital who was desperately ill and in need of a heart transplant, and perhaps Edward could do him a great kindness if they would allow them to transplant his Denise&#x27;s heart. Bosman and Venter withdrew from the room, saying that he should take as long as needed to consider their request and that they would understand if he declined to give his consent.

In the four minutes Edward Darvall took to reach his decision he thought of his daughter, a birthday, and a gift she had given to him from a first salary. He began to cry and decided what needed to be done. He composed himself and summoned the doctors back to the small room. He told them that if they could not save his daughter, they must try to save this man.

Although Washkansky died of pneumonia eighteen days after the transplant because of a weakened immune system, Barnard regarded the surgery as a success because the heart was &quot;not being stimulated by an electrical machine&quot;. As Barnard related in his book, &quot;One Life&quot;, a decision was made on the fifth postoperative day to bombard Washkansky&#x27;s system with immunosuppressants to guard against a potential rejection of the new heart. As later heart transplants would reveal, the signs noted at that time were part of a resettling program for the new heart and not necessarily an indication of rejection.

<text>.ne is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Niger.

Unrelated to the .ne top-level domain, &quot;ne&quot; is sometimes used as a second-level domain within other country-code domains, in which registrants may register second-level domains of the form .ne.xx, where xx is the ccTLD. Two examples are Japan (.ne.jp) and South Korea. &quot;.ne&quot; domain names can be registered via certain accredited registrars.

<text>Augusto Valdes Pangan, Sr. (March 12, 1932 – July 1, 1997), professionally known as Chiquito, was a Filipino actor and comedian.

==Biography==
Chiquito was born Augusto Valdes Pangan in Manila. His entertainment career began at the age of 13, when he appeared in a major musical production at the Manila Grand Opera House. In the next several years, he was a fixture in the Manila bodabil circuit, popular for his skill in dancing the boogie-woogie.

Chiquito was befriended by Fernando Poe, Sr., and with Poe&#x27;s assistance, started a film career. He broke into films with &quot;Sanggano&quot; from Palaris Pictures. He would star in over a hundred films, mostly comedies, over the next five decades. He established his own production company, Sotang Bastos Productions, named after his favorite film role from the 1950s. He would ride on the crest of ever popular comedy spoofs of Hollywood genres such as the gangster film and the western.

In one of these Western spoofs, &quot;The Arizona Kid&quot; (1971), he co-starred with Hollywood sex symbol Mamie Van Doren. Chiquito portrayed the very first male version of Darna in the film &quot;Teribol Dobol&quot;, preceding Dolphy, who only later came out with his own &quot;portrayal&quot; of the superheroine in &quot;Darna, Kuno?&quot;. By the 1980s, his brother Rene served as president and general manager of their production companies Sotang Bastos and Archer Productions.

In 1984, Chiquito was nominated for a FAMAS Best Supporting Actor Award for his role in &quot;Lovingly Yours, Helen&quot;, a film dramatization of the radio and GMA television show hosted by Helen Vela. In 1988, a film reuniting Chiquito with Dolphy titled &quot;Basura Gang&quot; was planned but did not push through.

Chiquito also entered local politics. He was elected three times as member of the municipal council of Makati, serving from 1969 to 1972, 1988 to 1989, and from 1995 until his death. He served a brief stint as appointed Vice Mayor of Makati from 1989 to 1992. In 1992, Chiquito made an unsuccessful bid to the Senate of the 9th Congress. He was a member of the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan during his political career. 

In 1994, Chiquito made a brief showbiz comeback when he teamed up with rapper-comedian Andrew E. in the film &quot;Pinagbiyak Na Bunga (Lookalayk)&quot; under Viva Films. The movie was a big success and later on had a television spin-off that same year entitled &quot;Puno&#x27;t Bunga&quot; aired over GMA Network. He later had supporting roles in films like &quot;Ang Pagbabalik ni Pedro Penduko&quot; (opposite Janno Gibbs), &quot;Bangers&quot; (with Joey de Leon and Andrew E.), and &quot;Strict ang Parents Ko&quot; (with Amanda Page).

==Personal life==
He was survived by his widow, Vilma Isidro-Pangan. The couple had seven children.

==Death==
Chiquito died at age 65 due to liver cancer at the Makati Medical Center on July 1, 1997. Philippine media called the day of his death &quot;the day the laughter died&quot;.

<text>.ng is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Nigeria. It is overseen by the Nigeria Internet Registration Association (NIRA).

== History ==
The top-level domain was first delegated in 1995 to Ibukun Odusote at the Yaba College of Technology. She was made a life patron of the Nigeria Internet Registration Association in 2013 for her work.

Operations were initially handled by an organization in Italy, the &quot;Instituto per le Applicazioni Telematiche&quot; (today known as the &quot;&quot;), but were later transferred to Randy Bush. In 2004, .ng was re-delegated to a Nigerian organization, the National Information Technology Development Agency, and then in 2009, to the Nigeria Internet Registration Association.

==Second level domains==
* com.ng – open domain, commercial entities and businesses
* org.ng – semi-open domain, non-commercial organizations
* gov.ng – closed domain, governmental organizations
* edu.ng – closed domain, degree awarding institutions
* net.ng – closed domain, ISP infrastructure
* sch.ng – closed domain, secondary schools
* name.ng – open domain, individuals
* mobi.ng – open domain, suitable for mobile devices
* mil.ng – closed domain (Nigerian military establishments only)
* i.ng – open domain, any purpose

In addition, NIRA themselves reserve the right to register &#x27;premium&#x27; top level domains under .ng (for example, &quot;google.ng&quot;).

==Statistics==
As of March 2022, there are 75 registrars accredited by NIRA. The most popular domain zone is .com.ng, having almost 70% of all national domains registered. The .ng domain comes next (17%) although within the zone a domain name is shorter, domain registration here costs several times more than in .com.ng while .org.ng, which is usually used by non-profit organisations, ranks third (7%).

<doc id="1237673" wikidata="Q1945784" url="?curid=1237673" title="Monte Cazazza">
<text>Monte Cazazza (January 23, 1949 – June 27, 2023) was an American artist and composer best known for his seminal role in helping shape industrial music through recordings with the London-based Industrial Records in the mid-1970s.

==Career==
Cazazza, based primarily in San Francisco during his early career, is credited with coining the phrase &quot;Industrial Music for Industrial People&quot;. This was later used to encapsulate the Industrial Records label and the artists representing it. Later, the noise collages and experimental sound manipulation coming out of Industrial Records came to be known as industrial music. Cazazza had built up an underground reputation as a particularly volatile performer with a potentially dangerous and antisocial aesthetic. Re/Search Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Industrial Culture Handbook&quot; described his work as &quot;insanity-outbreaks thinly disguised as art events&quot;. The Futurist Sintesi show near the end of 1975 was heralded on a promo flier as &quot;Sex - religious show; giant statue of Jesus got chainsawed and gang raped into oblivion&quot;.

Cazazza did not limit his &quot;performances&quot; to the familiar dynamic of stage, audience, and audience reaction. Much of his work involved acts designed for maximum shock value. While a student at the Oakland campus of the California College of Arts and Crafts, Cazazza created a cement waterfall that disabled the main stairway of the building for his first sculpture assignment. He was expelled shortly afterwards. As a statement piece he once created a 15&#x27;x15&#x27; screw-together metal swastika and was known to visit his friends with a dead cat and formaldehyde that he would use to set the cat alight.

Much of his early work is considered obscene and virtually impossible to find. He worked with both print and sound collage, film, performance, and presentation. He was also heavily involved in the Mail art movement of the mid-1970s to early 1980s. Some of his early output was collected and released by The Grey Area of Mute in 1992 on the album, &quot;The Worst of Monte Cazazza&quot;.

Cazazza worked frequently with Factrix, an early industrial and experimental group from San Francisco, and recorded soundtracks for Mark Pauline and Survival Research Laboratories. His later work included co-creating the independent distribution and film company MMFilms with Michelle Handelman and various soundtrack recordings.

Cazazza sent out photos of himself in an electric chair on the day of convicted murderer Gary Gilmore&#x27;s execution. One of these was mistakenly printed in a Hong Kong newspaper as the real execution. Cazazza was also photographed alongside COUM Transmissions/Throbbing Gristle members Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti for the &quot;Gary Gilmore Memorial Society&quot; postcard, in which the three artists posed blindfolded and tied to chairs with actual loaded guns pointed at them to depict Gilmore&#x27;s execution.

Monte spent the last 14 years of His Life with Partner/Collaborator and Artist Meri St. Mary, they produced numerous projects in various stages of development including Radio, Photography, Books. Film and Live Shows that coined the title &quot;Dueling Theremins&quot;. Meri is keeping Monte&#x27;s Legacy Alive featuring his work exclusively upcoming in 2025 and 2027.

Cazazza died on June 27, 2023.

<text>Denise Darvall (27 February 19423 December 1967) was the donor in the world&#x27;s first successful human heart transplant, performed at Groote Schuur Hospital, South Africa, by a team of surgeons led by Christiaan Barnard.

==Accident and death==
=== Injuries ===
Denise Darvall was seriously injured in a car accident on Main Road in Observatory, Cape Town. She and her family were visiting friends for afternoon tea and went shopping for cake. She and her mother, Myrtle Ann Darvall, were run over by salesman and police reservist Frederick Prins, who failed to see them. This was due to a large truck that obscured his view of them, and their view of his car. Her mother died immediately. Denise Darvall sustained a skull fracture and severe head injuries after the car flung her across the road; her head hit the wheel cap of her car. She required life support to remain alive, and was essentially brain dead by the time she made it into the hospital. At 9 p.m. on the day of the accident, the resuscitation team stopped attempts to revive her.

=== Father gives permission ===
Edward Darvall arranged for his fourteen-year-old son, who had witnessed the accident, to be taken away from the hospital. The 66-year-old Edward was also given a sedative, and he waited while doctors attempted to save his daughter. Two doctors, Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman, informed him that there was nothing further they could do for Denise. Bosman explained that there was a man in the hospital they might be able to help (Louis Washkansky), and asked Edward if he would consider allowing them to transplant Denise&#x27;s heart.

Edward Darvall later said that, after thinking about his daughter for four minutes, he reached his decision and gave permission.

=== Declaration of death ===
Surgeons had a serious ethical problem because death then could only be declared by whole-body standards. The Harvard Criteria of brain death were not developed until 1968, nor were they adopted in South Africa or elsewhere for some years. The problem in this case was that, although Denise&#x27;s brain was damaged, her heart was healthy. Various reports over the years attributed conflicting reasons for her heart stopping. For 40 years, Marius Barnard kept a secret: rather than wait for her heart to stop beating, his brother, Christiaan Barnard, who led the transplant team, had injected potassium into Denise&#x27;s heart to paralyze it at Marius&#x27;s urging. This rendered her technically dead by the whole-body standard.

=== Organ donation ===
After her father gave his consent, Darvall&#x27;s heart was donated to Louis Washkansky. Her kidneys were given to 10-year-old Jonathan van Wyk. Due to apartheid, the kidney donation to Van Wyk was controversial because he was khoi, while Denise was white. Washkansky lived 18 days before succumbing to pneumonia.

==Burial and trial==

Edward Darvall arranged for his wife and daughter to be cremated at the Maitland Crematorium, Maitland, Cape Town. The joint ceremony took place on Wednesday, 6 December, and their ashes were later placed into a niche on site. Edward Darvall died in 1970 and was also cremated there.

Darvall was present at the trial of the drunk driver who was convicted of murder. He made a statement through a lawyer, asking the magistrate to show the &quot;greatest possible mercy&quot; to the driver. &quot;The tragic death of his daughter was not meaningless, but benefited humanity,&quot; he said.

<doc id="1237690" wikidata="Q5373766" url="?curid=1237690" title="Emotional Design">
<text>Emotional Design is both the title of a book by Donald Norman and of the concept it represents.

==Content==
The main topic covered is how emotions have a crucial role in the human ability to understand the world, and how they learn new things. In fact, studies show that emotion influences people&#x27;s information processing and decision-making For example: aesthetically pleasing objects appear to the user to be more effective, by virtue of their sensual appeal. This is due to the affinity the user feels for an object that appeals to them, due to the formation of an emotional connection with the object. Consequently, It is believed that companies and designers should not rely on pricey marketing; they should link their services to customers&#x27; emotions and daily lives to get them &quot;hooked&quot; on a product.

Norman&#x27;s approach is based on classical ABC model of attitudes. However, he changed the concept to be suitable for application in design. The three dimensions have new names (visceral, behavioral and reflective level) and partially new content .

The first is the &quot;visceral&quot; level which is about immediate initial reactions people unconsciously do and are greatly determined by sensory factors (look, feel, smell, and sound). Norman argued that attractive products work better because they can engage multiple senses to evoke emotional responses and bonds through use of visual factors of color, texture, and shape. He contends that beautifully designed products make people feel good. This is where appearance matters, and first impressions are formed, and the texture and surface of an object become important in evoking a specific emotional reaction. Thus, viscerally well-designed products tend to evoke positive emotions and experiences in the consumers.

The second is &quot;behavioral&quot; level which is all about use; what does a product do, what function does it perform? Good behavioral design should be human centered, focusing upon understanding and satisfying the needs of people who use the product. This level of design starts with understanding the user&#x27;s demands, ideally derived from conducting studies of relevant behavior in homes, schools, places of work, or wherever the product will be used.  

The third is &quot;reflective&quot; level at which the product has meaning for consumers; the emotional connections which are formed over time using the product and are influenced by cultural, social, and personal factors. Via good reflective design, people will feel a sense of personal bond and identity with an object, and it will become a part of their daily lives. It is how we remember the experience itself and how it made us feel.

In summary, the visceral level concerns itself with the aesthetic or attractiveness of an object. The behavioral level considers the function and usability of the product. The reflective level takes into account prestige and value; this is often influenced by the branding of a product.

In the book, Norman shows that design of most objects are perceived on all three levels (dimensions). Therefore, a good design should address all three levels. Norman also mentions in his book that &quot;technology should bring more to our lives than the improved performance of tasks: it should be richness and enjoyment.&quot; (pg 101) He stresses the importance of creating fun and pleasurable products instead of dull and dreary ones. By mixing all three design levels and the four pleasures by Patrick W. Jordan, the product should evoke an emotion when the user is interacting with the product. The interaction of these three levels of design leads to the culmination of the &quot;emotional design,&quot; a new, holistic approach to designing successful products and creates enduring and delightful product experience.

Emotional design is an important element when generating ideas for human-centered opportunities. People can more easily relate to a product, a service, a system, or an experience when they are able to connect with it at a personal level. Rather than thinking that there is one solution for all, both Norman&#x27;s three design levels and Jordan&#x27;s four pleasures of design can help us design for each individual&#x27;s needs. Both concepts can be used as tools to better connect with the end user that it is being design for. This viewpoint is gaining a lot of acceptance in the business world; for example, Postrel argues that the &quot;look and feel&quot; of people, places, and things are more important than we think. In other words, people today are more concerned with the look and feel of products than with their functionality.

==Cover==
The front cover of &quot;Emotional Design&quot; showcases Philippe Starck&#x27;s Juicy Salif, an icon of industrial design that Norman heralds as an &quot;item of seduction&quot; and the manifestation of his thesis.

== Concept ==
Emotions are a fundamental aspect of human experience, and our emotional responses to people, places, and objects are shaped by a complex interplay of factors. As Peter Boatwright and Jonathan Cagan point out, &quot;emotion is human, and its reach is vast&quot;. In the current marketplace, successful companies are not just creating good products, but also producing captivating ones that not only attract consumer attention, but also influence their demands and increase their engagement based on both the product&#x27;s performance and how it makes them feel.

Emotional design is also influenced by the four pleasures, identified in &quot;Designing Pleasurable Products&quot; by Patrick W. Jordan. In this book Jordan builds on the work of Lionel Tiger to identify the four kinds of pleasures. Jordan describes these as &quot;modes of motivation that enhance a product or a service. Life is unenjoyable without appreciating what we do, and it is human intuition to seek pleasure.&quot; The idea of incorporating pleasure into products is to provide the buyer with an added experience. Jordan points out in his book that a product should be more than something functional and/or aesthetically pleasing and it should evoke an emotion through the use of pleasures. Although it is hard to achieve all four pleasures into one product, by simply focusing on one, it might be what can bring a product from being chosen over another. The four pleasures that could be implemented into products or a service are:

Physio-pleasure deals with the body and pleasure derived from the sensory organs. This includes taste, touch, and smell, as well as sexual and sensual pleasure. In the context of products, these pleasures can be associated with tactile properties (the way interaction with the product feels) or olfactory properties (the leather smell in a new car, for example).

Socio-pleasure is the enjoyment derived from the company of others. Products can facilitate social interaction in a number of ways, either through providing a service that brings people together (a coffee-maker enabling a host to provide their guests with fresh coffee) or by being a talking point in and of itself.

Psycho-pleasure is defined as pleasure which is gained from the accomplishment of a task. In a product context, psycho-pleasure relates to the extent in which a product can help in task completion and make the accomplishment a satisfying experience. This pleasure may also take into account the efficiency with which a task can be completed (a word processor with built-in formatting decreasing the amount of time spent on creating a document, for example).

Ideo-pleasure refers to pleasure derived from theoretical entities such as books, music, and art. It may relate to the aesthetics of a product and the values it embodies. A product made of bio-degradable material, for example, can be seen as holding value in the environment which, in turn, may appeal to someone who wishes to be environmentally responsible.

== The use of emotional design ==

=== In film ===
People mostly know film as an entertainment but film can do more than that. Gianluca Sergi and Alan Lovell cite a study in their essays on cinema entertainment that the film users (the viewers) see films as an escape from reality and a source of amusement, relaxation and knowledge, meaning films also function as an educational tool and a method of stress relief. Specifically, comparing to emotional design, film fulfills the requirements it needs. Firstly, movies have an attractive appearance. Whether movies start with a black and white concept like in Oz the Great and Powerful or an oddly colorful, but serious theme as in Suicide Squad, they usually capture the audiences&#x27; attention, who then want to continue watching the whole show. The &quot;wow&quot; reaction that viewers have is the visceral reaction, according to how Don Norman explains the three levels of design in his book &quot;Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things&quot;, &quot;[w]hen we perceive something as &quot;pretty,&quot; that judgment comes directly from the visceral level.&quot; (65–66) Secondly, the behavioral level: in a literal sense, the only function of movies is to be watched. With the advancement of technology, movies now have high resolution, as well as various lighting dynamics and camera angles. Lastly, applying Don Norman&#x27;s statement on how products can add positively to the self-image of the users and how good the users feel after owning the products, film does influence its viewers greatly and affect the way they act. Trice and Greer indicate that &quot;we identify with characters on the screen who are like us in terms of age, sex and other characteristics; we also identify with people we would like to be like.[...] We tend to imitate &quot;good&quot; characters&quot; (135). That being said, movies do not label any of their characters good or bad in a straightforward manner; the viewers only learn about the characters through the narrative, which production design is a part of.

=== In physical space design ===
Emotional design is one of the important aspects of creating a successful and enjoyable experience for customers in a physical space such as Starbucks. Emotional design refers to the ability of design elements to evoke certain emotions or feelings in customers. [13] One example of emotional design at Starbucks is the use of warm lighting, comfortable seating, and relaxing music to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. This creates a sense of comfort and relaxation, which can be particularly appealing to customers who are looking for a place to unwind or catch up with friends. Another example of emotional design at Starbucks is the use of distinctive and recognizable branding elements, such as the green logo, the mermaid icon, and the signature cup design. These elements create a sense of familiarity and loyalty among customers, who often associate the Starbucks brand with a certain lifestyle or personality.

== Relationship between emotion and design ==
Emotion and design are intricately linked in the field of emotional design, which is concerned with creating products, interfaces, and experiences that engage users on an emotional level. Emotions design involves the intentional use of design elements to evoke specific emotional responses in users.

The relationship between emotion and design in emotional design is rooted in the idea that emotions are a key driver of human behavior. People are more likely to engage with products and interfaces that evoke positive emotions such as joy, excitement, and delight, while negative emotions such as frustration and anger can lead to disengagement and avoidance.

In emotional design, designers use a variety of techniques to evoke emotions in users. These may include the use of color, typography, imagery, sound, and motion, among others. For example, a website might use bright, cheerful colors and playful animations to create a sense of fun and whimsy, while a meditation app might use soft, calming colors and soothing sounds to create a sense of relaxation and tranquility.

<text>The State of Guanabara (, ) was a state of Brazil from 1960 to 1975, which included the city of Rio de Janeiro. It was named after Guanabara Bay to the east of the state. It was created from the territory of the old Federal District when the federal capital moved from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília and a new Federal District was erected around the new capital. In 1975 the State of Guanabara was merged with the surrounding State of Rio de Janeiro, within which its territory became the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro.

==History==
In 1834, the city of Rio de Janeiro was elevated to Imperial capital of the Empire of Brazil, and was included in the Neutral Municipality (). The surrounding Province of Rio de Janeiro (which did not include the city) had its capital city in Niterói. When Brazil became a republic in 1889, the city of Rio de Janeiro remained the national capital, and the territory of the Neutral Municipality became the Federal District (), while the surrounding homonymous province became a state, still with Niterói as its capital.

In 1960 the Fourth Brazilian Republic moved the national capital to Brasília and a new Federal District was created for it. The old Federal District became a state, named Guanabara.

Throughout its 15-year existence, Guanabara was a unique state in many ways. Comprising only one city (albeit a large one), Guanabara was the smallest Brazilian state by land. It also had the peculiarity of being the only Brazilian state that was not divided into municipalities. There was no mayor, municipal legislature or any other municipal government institution there, as the city of Rio de Janeiro was directly administered by the state government of Guanabara. On the other hand, that also meant that the Guanabara state government had some functions that were normally assigned to municipalities elsewhere, such as regulating urban zoning, inspecting the safety of buildings, or issuing licenses for commercial venues, for example.

All the characteristics disappeared in 1975, when the military dictatorship merged the state of Guanabara into the state of Rio de Janeiro. (Legally, the merger dissolved both Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro, creating a new state, also named Rio de Janeiro.) The capital of the reconstituted state of Rio de Janeiro was changed from Niterói back to the city of Rio de Janeiro, as had been the case until 1834. 

==Electoral history==
In gubernatorial elections held on 3 October 1965, , a candidate supported by a coalition formed by PTB and PSD and a close associate of former President Juscelino Kubitschek, won the race to be the state&#x27;s governor, garnering 52% of the votes cast.

<doc id="1237694" wikidata="Q7728236" url="?curid=1237694" title="The Croydon Advertiser">
<text>The Croydon Advertiser (with locally branded editions) is a paid-for weekly newspaper with five editions covering the London Boroughs of Croydon, Sutton and two neighbouring towns and with a free up-to-the-minute maintained web presence.

==History==
The Croydon newspaper was founded by Jesse Ward in 1869, and it and the other &quot;Advertiser&quot; publications later became part of the Northcliffe Media Group, which is owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust during its existence the largest newspaper publisher in the United Kingdom. The paper converted from a broadsheet to a compact (tabloid) format on 31 March 2006.

In September 2010 the Advertiser adopted a short-lived hybrid part-paid, part free strategy, with 70,000 copies delivered to homes across Sutton and Croydon.

===&quot;Lillian&#x27;s Law&quot;===
In June 2010, 14-year-old Lillian Groves was killed by a speeding car driver who had been smoking cannabis. Lillian had been in the street outside her New Addington home when she was hit by the car. In August 2011, the Advertiser launched a campaign alongside Lillian&#x27;s family calling on the Government to reform the law on drug driving. 

In November that year Lillian&#x27;s family met with Prime Minister David Cameron, who promised to introduce new legislation, adding that her death &quot;proved the need for roadside drugs testing&quot; and that the then driving legislation, which relied on police to prove impairment by other means, was &quot;all wrong&quot;. In early 2012 the Department for Transport, announced the creation of an expert panel to explore the implications of the new law (&quot;Lillian&#x27;s Law&quot;, as it became known). 

In May 2012, a new drug driving offence was included in the Queen&#x27;s Speech as part of the Crime and Courts Bill, adopted in the Crime and Courts Act 2013. Prime Minister David Cameron credited the campaign and the bravery of the Groves family.

===Broad ownership===

In 2012, ownership broadened as a result of a co-venture enterprise Local World between media groups: Daily Mail and General Trust, Yattendon Group, Trinity Mirror and others, taking over Northcliffe Media.

<doc id="1237700" wikidata="Q5957770" url="?curid=1237700" title="Hyperbolic 3-manifold">
<text>In mathematics, more precisely in topology and differential geometry, a hyperbolic 3-manifold is a manifold of dimension 3 equipped with a hyperbolic metric, that is a Riemannian metric which has all its sectional curvatures equal to −1. It is generally required that this metric be also complete: in this case the manifold can be realised as a quotient of the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space by a discrete group of isometries (a Kleinian group).

Hyperbolic 3-manifolds of finite volume have a particular importance in 3-dimensional topology as follows from Thurston&#x27;s geometrisation conjecture proved by Perelman. The study of Kleinian groups is also an important topic in geometric group theory.

== Importance in topology ==

Hyperbolic geometry is the most rich and least understood of the eight geometries in dimension 3 (for example, for all other geometries it is not hard to give an explicit enumeration of the finite-volume manifolds with this geometry, while this is far from being the case for hyperbolic manifolds). After the proof of the Geometrisation conjecture, understanding the topological properties of hyperbolic 3-manifolds is thus a major goal of 3-dimensional topology. Recent breakthroughs of Kahn–Markovic, Wise, Agol and others have answered most long-standing open questions on the topic but there are still many less prominent ones which have not been solved.

In dimension 2 almost all closed surfaces are hyperbolic (all but the sphere, projective plane, torus and Klein bottle). In dimension 3 this is far from true: there are many ways to construct infinitely many non-hyperbolic closed manifolds. On the other hand, the heuristic statement that &quot;a generic 3-manifold tends to be hyperbolic&quot; is verified in many contexts. For example, any knot which is not either a satellite knot or a torus knot is hyperbolic. Moreover, almost all Dehn surgeries on a hyperbolic knot yield a hyperbolic manifold. A similar result is true of links (Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem), and since all 3-manifolds are obtained as surgeries on a link in the 3-sphere this gives a more precise sense to the informal statement. Another sense in which &quot;almost all&quot; manifolds are hyperbolic in dimension 3 is that of random models. For example, random Heegaard splittings of genus at least 2 are almost surely hyperbolic (when the complexity of the gluing map goes to infinity).

The relevance of the hyperbolic geometry of a 3-manifold to its topology also comes from the Mostow rigidity theorem, which states that the hyperbolic structure of a hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume is uniquely determined by its homotopy type. In particular, geometric invariants such as the volume can be used to define new topological invariants.

== Structure ==

=== Manifolds of finite volume ===

In this case one important tool to understand the geometry of a manifold is the thick-thin decomposition. It states that a hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume has a decomposition into two parts:
*the &quot;thick&quot; part, where the injectivity radius is larger than an absolute constant; 
*and its complement, the &quot;thin&quot; part, which is a disjoint union of solid tori and cusps.

=== Geometrically finite manifolds ===

The thick-thin decomposition is valid for all hyperbolic 3-manifolds, though in general the thin part is not as described above. A hyperbolic 3-manifold is said to be geometrically finite if it contains a convex submanifold (its &quot;convex core&quot;) onto which it retracts, and whose thick part is compact (note that all manifolds have a convex core, but in general it is not compact). The simplest case is when the manifold does not have &quot;cusps&quot; (i.e. the fundamental group does not contain parabolic elements), in which case the manifold is geometrically finite if and only if it is the quotient of a closed, convex subset of hyperbolic space by a group acting cocompactly on this subset.

=== Manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group ===

This is the larger class of hyperbolic 3-manifolds for which there is a satisfying structure theory. It rests on two theorems:
*The tameness theorem which states that such a manifold is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold with boundary; 
*The ending lamination theorem which provides a classification of hyperbolic structure on the interior of a compact manifold by its &quot;end invariants&quot;.

== Construction of hyperbolic 3-manifolds of finite volume ==

=== Hyperbolic polyhedra, reflection groups ===

The oldest construction of hyperbolic manifolds, which dates back at least to Poincaré, goes as follows: start with a finite collection of 3-dimensional hyperbolic finite polytopes. Suppose that there is a side-pairing between the 2-dimensional faces of these polyhedra (i.e. each such face is paired with another, distinct, one so that they are isometric to each other as 2-dimensional hyperbolic polygons), and consider the space obtained by gluing the paired faces together (formally this is obtained as a quotient space). It carries a hyperbolic metric which is well-defined outside of the image of the 1-skeletons of the polyhedra. This metric extends to a hyperbolic metric on the whole space if the two following conditions are satisfied: 
*for each (non-ideal) vertex in the gluing the sum of the solid angles of the polyhedra to which it belongs is equal to formula_1; 
*for each edge in the gluing the sum of the dihedral angles of the polyhedra to which it belongs is equal to formula_2. 
A notable example of this construction is the Seifert–Weber space which is obtained by gluing opposite faces of a regular dodecahedron.

A variation on this construction is by using hyperbolic Coxeter polytopes (polytopes whose dihedral angles are of the form formula_3). Such a polytope gives rise to a Kleinian reflection group, which is a discrete subgroup of isometries of hyperbolic space. Taking a torsion-free finite-index subgroup one obtains a hyperbolic manifold (which can be recovered by the previous construction, gluing copies of the original Coxeter polytope in a manner prescribed by an appropriate Schreier coset graph).

=== Gluing ideal tetrahedra and hyperbolic Dehn surgery ===
In the previous construction the manifolds obtained are always compact. To obtain manifolds with cusps one has to use polytopes which have ideal vertices (i.e. vertices which lie on the sphere at infinity). In this setting the gluing construction does not always yield a complete manifold. Completeness is detected by a system of equations involving the dihedral angles around the edges adjacent to an ideal vertex, which are commonly called Thurston&#x27;s gluing equations. In case the gluing is complete the ideal vertices become cusps in the manifold. An example of a noncompact, finite volume hyperbolic manifold obtained in this way is the Gieseking manifold which is constructed by gluing faces of a regular ideal hyperbolic tetrahedron together.

It is also possible to construct a finite-volume, complete hyperbolic manifold when the gluing is not complete. In this case the completion of the metric space obtained is a manifold with a torus boundary and under some (not generic) conditions it is possible to glue a hyperbolic solid torus on each boundary component so that the resulting space has a complete hyperbolic metric. Topologically, the manifold is obtained by hyperbolic Dehn surgery on the complete hyperbolic manifold which would result from a complete gluing.

It is not known whether all hyperbolic 3-manifolds of finite volume can be constructed in this way. In practice however this is how computational software (such as SnapPea or Regina) stores hyperbolic manifolds.

=== Arithmetic constructions ===
The construction of arithmetic Kleinian groups from quaternion algebras gives rise to particularly interesting hyperbolic manifolds. On the other hand, they are in some sense &quot;rare&quot; among hyperbolic 3-manifolds (for example hyperbolic Dehn surgery on a fixed manifold results in a non-arithmetic manifold for almost all parameters).

=== The hyperbolisation theorem ===

In contrast to the explicit constructions above it is possible to deduce the existence of a complete hyperbolic structure on a 3-manifold purely from topological information. This is a consequence of the Geometrisation conjecture and can be stated as follows (a statement sometimes referred to as the &quot;hyperbolisation theorem&quot;, which was proven by Thurston in the special case of Haken manifolds):

A particular case is that of a surface bundle over the circle: such manifolds are always irreducible, and they carry a complete hyperbolic metric if and only if the monodromy is a pseudo-Anosov map.

Another consequence of the Geometrisation conjecture is that any closed 3-manifold which admits a Riemannian metric with negative sectional curvatures admits in fact a Riemannian metric with constant sectional curvature -1. This is not true in higher dimensions.

== Virtual properties ==

The topological properties of 3-manifolds are sufficiently intricate that in many cases it is interesting to know that a property holds virtually for a class of manifolds, that is for any manifold in the class there exists a finite covering space of the manifold with the property. The virtual properties of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are the objects of a series of conjectures by Waldhausen and Thurston, which were recently all proven by Ian Agol following work of Jeremy Kahn, Vlad Markovic, Frédéric Haglund, Dani Wise and others. The first part of the conjectures were logically related to the virtually Haken conjecture. In order of strength they are: 
#(the surface subgroup conjecture) The fundamental group of any hyperbolic manifold of finite volume contains a (non-free) surface group (the fundamental group of a closed surface). 
#(the Virtually Haken conjecture) Any hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume is virtually Haken; that is, it contains an embedded closed surface such that the embedding induces an injective map between fundamental groups. 
#Any hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume has a finite cover with a nonzero first Betti number. 
#Any hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume has a finite cover whose fundamental group surjects onto a non-abelian free group (such groups are usually called &quot;large&quot;). 
Another conjecture (also proven by Agol) which implies 1-3 above but a priori has no relation to 4 is the following : 
: 5. (the virtually fibered conjecture) Any hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume has a finite cover which is a surface bundle over the circle.

== The space of all hyperbolic 3-manifolds ==

=== Geometric convergence ===

A sequence of Kleinian groups is said to be &quot;geometrically convergent&quot; if it converges in the Chabauty topology. For the manifolds obtained as quotients this amounts to them being convergent in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff metric.

=== Jørgensen–Thurston theory ===

The hyperbolic volume can be used to order the space of all hyperbolic manifold. The set of manifolds corresponding to a given volume is at most finite, and the set of volumes is well-ordered and of order type formula_4. More precisely, Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem implies that a manifold with formula_5 cusps is a limit of a sequence of manifolds with formula_6 cusps for any formula_7, so that the isolated points are volumes of compact manifolds, the manifolds with exactly one cusp are limits of compact manifolds, and so on. Together with results of Jørgensen the theorem also proves that any convergent sequence must be obtained by Dehn surgeries on the limit manifold.

=== Quasi-Fuchsian groups ===

Sequences of quasi-fuchsian surface groups of given genus can converge to a doubly degenerate surface group, as in the double limit theorem.

<text>George Lopez (born October 23, 1966), known by his stage name DJ Keoki or Keoki Franconi, is a Salvadoran-American electronic musician and DJ. Born in El Salvador and raised in Hawaii, Keoki began advertising himself as &quot;superstar&quot; shortly after moving to New York City.

==Biography==
Keoki Franconi was born in El Salvador. He moved to Kihei, Maui, when he was 8. After graduating from Kailua High School, he moved to the mainland to study at an airline school in California. Franconi worked at several airlines in New York City, among them the now defunct Trans World Airlines. He also was a busboy at Danceteria club during this time. That was where he began to start DJing. He recalls,

===Club Kids and Michael Alig===

While in New York City, he met and began a romance with Michael Alig. Alig rose to international notability as the head of the Club Kids, a group of diverse people who would dress in costumes each night and form parties in New York and across the United States.

Dance music writer Jennifer Warner remembers,

While DJing at &quot;Disco 2000&quot;, Alig&#x27;s party night at the Limelight, Franconi was alleged to have passed out on the turntables while performing a set. He has completely denied the allegation, stating that it indeed never happened.

Franconi had a successful career during the late 1990s and early 2000s as DJ Keoki; he released a number of CDs over that decade and was hired to play for thousands of people at massive raves. In 2006 and 2007, he toured in the United States and Europe on the Club Party Monster Tour, a tribute to the film &quot;Party Monster&quot; (2003) as well as a nod to the Club Kid scene that shot him into stardom. During the tour, he was known for dressing extravagantly, wearing makeup, and sporting a number of tattoos.

Keoki toured and performed at The Viper Room in Los Angeles, California, Shag in Denver, Colorado, Club Tantra in Tampa, Florida, VIA Afterhours in Houston, Texas, Amazura Concert Hall in Queens, New York, Hard Rock Cafe in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He also makes annual appearances in Moscow at the Gaudi Fest during Halloween, and has played at the Love Parade in Berlin, Germany. In January 2017, he was arrested in New York City after a man in his apartment died of a drug overdose, when the officers entering his apartment found it contained illegal narcotics. Following the incident, he entered a rehabilitation program and announced the cancellation of all of his upcoming events.

<doc id="1237726" wikidata="Q45820" url="?curid=1237726" title="Rutherford Appleton Laboratory">
<text>The Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) is one of the national scientific research laboratories in the UK operated by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). It began as the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory, merged with the Atlas Computer Laboratory in 1975 to create the Rutherford Lab; then in 1979 with the Appleton Laboratory to form the current laboratory.

It is located on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus at Chilton near Didcot in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. It has a staff of approximately 1,200 people who support the work of over 10,000 scientists and engineers, chiefly from the university research community. The laboratory&#x27;s programme is designed to deliver trained manpower and economic growth for the UK as the result of achievements in science.

==History==
RAL is named after the physicists Ernest Rutherford and Edward Appleton.

The National Institute for Research in Nuclear Science (NIRNS) was formed in 1957 to operate the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory established next to the Atomic Energy Research Establishment on the former RAF Harwell airfield between Chilton and Harwell. The 50 MeV proton linear accelerator was transferred from the Atomic Energy Research Establishment to the new laboratory to become a national facility for particle physics as the Nimrod. Some components of this linear accelerator are still operating as part of the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source injector linac over 50 years after their first use. Since then the laboratory has grown both with the expansion of its established facilities, and the incorporation of facilities from other institutions to provide the benefits from economies of scale. The major mergers were in 1975 with the adjacent Atlas Computer Laboratory creating the Rutherford Laboratory, and then in 1979 with the Appleton Laboratory to form the current Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. With the closure of the Royal Greenwich Observatory in 1998, some small offices also moved to RAL. Similarly, laser technology moved to RAL from Joint European Torus at Culham to become the foundation of the Central Laser Facility.

To be able to decide the priorities for government funding across all areas of scientific research, the Science &amp; Technology Act of 1965 created the Science Research Council (SRC) which took over management of the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory from NIRNS along with many other previously disparate UK science bodies. To prioritise economic impact over blue skies research, the SRC became the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) in the early 1980s, and in 1994, the SERC was eventually divided into three Research Councils (the EPSRC, PPARC and the CCLRC – which took responsibility for RAL from EPSRC in 1995), so that each could then focus its development around one of three incompatible business models – administratively efficient short duration grant distribution, medium term commitments to international agreements, long-term commitments to staff and facilities provision. To unify the planning of the provision for UK scientists to access large national and international facilities, in 2007 the CCLRC merged with PPARC and incorporated the nuclear physics discipline from EPSRC to create the Science and Technology Facilities Council which then took responsibility for RAL.

==Facilities==
The site hosts some of the UK&#x27;s major scientific facilities, including:

* the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source (1984), a spallation neutron source.
* the Central Laser Facility, providing access to large scale laser systems for researchers from the United Kingdom and other EU countries.
* the Diamond Light Source synchrotron, which officially opened in January 2007.

Also hosted are:
* Microelectronics Support Centre (MSC)
* NGS UK national academic computing grid
* GridPP&#x27;s Tier1 computing centre
* Energy Research Unit
* various other resources and services in microelectronics, atmospheric sciences, spectroscopy and renewable energy research.

==Programmes==
In addition to hosting facilities for the UK, RAL also operates departments to co-ordinate the UK programme of participation in major international facilities. The largest of these are the areas of particle physics, and space science.

In particle physics the largest international project is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, but RAL has a major role in the UK participation in several other projects such as:

* the MINOS – Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search,
* the T2K – to measure the third type of neutrino oscillation,
* experiments to measure the electric dipole moment of the neutron at the Institut Laue–Langevin,
* International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment,
* the UK Dark Matter Collaboration experiment at the Boulby Mine in Yorkshire.

In space science, RAL builds components for, and tests satellites, as well as receiving, analysing and curating the data collected by those spacecraft. Satellite missions in which RAL has a significant role include:

* the STEREO Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory,
* the SOHO Solar and Heliospheric Observatory,
* Solar-B investigating the Solar Corona,
* Galileo European satellite navigation system,
* MSG-2 meteorological satellite,
* Venus Express investigating the atmosphere of Venus,
* TopSat taking high resolution pictures of the Earth,
* Double Star (Polar) investigating the interaction of the Earth and the Sun,
* EOS-Aura monitoring the global temperature of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere,
* Rosetta (spacecraft) investigating the composition of comets,
* Chandrayaan-1 mission to investigate the moon,
* Herschel Space Observatory and Planck (spacecraft) space telescope.
*Badr-B, developed the CCD cameras for the satellite.

==Economic impact==

In recent years, there has been an increasing political drive towards requiring that the science undertaken at RAL and the technology created there result in a proportional economic benefit to the UK to justify the investment of public funds in the laboratory. RAL management has argued that this is achieved in various ways, including:

* From the commercial products and services resulting from the scientific results which are achieved on the facilities at RAL (e.g., through new materials, new drugs etc.).
* Through the early warning of disasters predicted from terrestrial and space data acquired and analysed at RAL (e.g., radio/mobile phone interference predictions, severe weather predictions etc.).
* Through the training of specialist scientists and engineers at RAL, who then move into commercial companies.
* Through the standardisation of technologies which has resulted in the acceleration of economic growth through interoperability and interchangeability of products — especially in computing.
* By the enthusiasm generated in science by the results of large facilities (e.g., from astronomical images or from particle physics experiments), which leads to schoolchildren choosing scientific training and scientific careers in many fields.
* By technologies developed at RAL during the development of facilities themselves, which are then licensed to UK companies, or spin-out companies.

==Decommissioning==
According to its Annual Report from 2017 to 2018, STFC expects the end of the ISIS pulsed neutron source and the associated Second Target Station to be in 2040 and anticipates decommissioning to take 55 years. The cost of radioactive waste disposal could range between £9 million and £16 million.

==In popular culture==
RAL was used as a set for the filming of an episode of Terry Nation&#x27;s BBC TV series &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;.

The computer-generated imagery (CGI) for Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot; were created at the Atlas Computer Laboratory which is now part of RAL.

The Space Science department featured in the &quot;In the Box&quot; episode of the CBeebies series &quot;Nina and the Neurons&quot;.

<text>The second Lord Melbourne ministry was formed in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by the Viscount Melbourne in 1835.

==History==
Lord Melbourne&#x27;s second government came to power after Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s minority government resigned in 1835. Lord Palmerston returned as Foreign Secretary while Lord John Russell held his first major office as Home Secretary.

In 1837 Queen Victoria succeeded to the throne, and as was usual for a queen regnant, the Royal Household was appointed by the Prime Minister. The young Queen was so attached to her Whig ladies of the bedchamber that after Melbourne&#x27;s resignation in 1839, she refused to let Sir Robert Peel replace them with Conservative ladies. This was known as the Bedchamber Crisis, and led to Peel&#x27;s refusal to form a government. Melbourne therefore resumed, and continued in office until the Conservatives finally won a House of Commons majority in the General Election of 1841. He was succeeded by Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s second government.

== 1841 votes of no confidence==

The 1841 votes of no confidence against the government of Viscount Melbourne were votes of no confidence in the government of William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne which occurred on 7 June 1841. Melbourne lost the vote by only one vote and dissolved Parliament leading to an election in July 1841. Melbourne lost a second vote of confidence shortly after the election in August, leading to his resignation.

<doc id="1237763" wikidata="Q6529845" url="?curid=1237763" title="Les Patineurs (waltz)">
<text>Les Patineurs (&quot;The Ice Skaters&quot;, in German &quot;Der Schlittschuhläufer-Walzer&quot;), Op. 183, is a waltz by Émile Waldteufel.
It was composed in 1882, inspired by the (rink of skaters) at the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. The introduction to the waltz can be likened to the poise of a skater, and the rapid runs invoke scenes of a wintry atmosphere. Bells were added for good measure to complete the winter scenery.

It was published by Hopwood &amp; Crew and was dedicated to Ernest Coquelin, the younger brother of two celebrated actor brothers of the Comédie-Française.

&quot;Les Patineurs&quot; has featured in dozens of films, from the earliest talkies to the present, including &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot;, &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, &quot;A Simple Wish&quot;, &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot;, and &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot;. It was also played at Rose&#x27;s &quot;coming-out&quot; ball in London in the last episode of season 4 of the TV show &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, as well as in the episode &quot;Secret Shopper&quot; of the kids&#x27; TV show &quot;Fanboy &amp; Chum Chum&quot;. It was used in the original version of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Pingu&quot; in the third episode, &quot;The New Arrival&quot;. It is also on the compilation &quot;Andy Williams Christmas Show&quot; DVD in a scene from his 1967 Christmas show on television. A music-box version is used in the Japanese film &quot;Himizu&quot;, the piece is hummed by Rabbit (voiced by Junius Matthews) while he is skating in Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too. In the 2019 Elton John biopic &quot;Rocketman&quot;, a young Reggie plays along on the piano as the waltz plays on the wireless, sparking the recognition of his musical talent.

The music is played in every level of the NES game &quot;Antarctic Adventure&quot;.

A small part of it is played in the TV series &quot;Daredevil&quot; and its spin-off &quot;The Punisher&quot;.

&quot;The Skaters&#x27; Waltz&quot; is also a music record in &quot;Nintendogs + Cats&quot;.

This piece was remixed in Nintendo&#x27;s 2005 video game &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix&quot;, as a song called &quot;Rendezvous on Ice&quot; that plays when Mario is skating away from an avalanche down a mountain.

This piece was shortened in Sega&#x27;s 2009 Wii video game &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games&quot;.

&quot;The Skaters&#x27; Waltz&quot; is used in the 1985 BBC children&#x27;s television show &quot;Galloping Galaxies!&quot;.

&quot;The Skaters&#x27; Waltz&quot; is used, briefly, towards the end of Paul Hindemith&#x27;s 1925 parody &quot;Ouvertüre zum &quot;Fliegenden Holländer&quot;, wie sie eine schlechte Kurkapelle morgens um 7 am Brunnen vom Blatt spielt&quot;, a very dissonant spoof of Wagner&#x27;s overture to &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;. Waldteufel&#x27;s music suddenly appears, perfectly consonant, as the players &quot;forget&quot; what they were playing and then they &quot;remember&quot; what they were supposed to be playing and return to the dissonant spoof on Wagner.

<text>Polarizability usually refers to the tendency of matter, when subjected to an electric field, to acquire an electric dipole moment in proportion to that applied field. It is a property of particles with an electric charge. When subject to an electric field, the negatively charged electrons and positively charged atomic nuclei are subject to opposite forces and undergo charge separation. Polarizability is responsible for a material&#x27;s dielectric constant and, at high (optical) frequencies, its refractive index.

The polarizability of an atom or molecule is defined as the ratio of its induced dipole moment to the local electric field; in a crystalline solid, one considers the dipole moment per unit cell. Note that the local electric field seen by a molecule is generally different from the macroscopic electric field that would be measured externally. This discrepancy is taken into account by the Clausius–Mossotti relation (below) which connects the bulk behaviour (polarization density due to an external electric field according to the electric susceptibility formula_1) with the molecular polarizability formula_2 due to the local field.

Magnetic polarizability likewise refers to the tendency for a magnetic dipole moment to appear in proportion to an external magnetic field. Electric and magnetic polarizabilities determine the dynamical response of a bound system (such as a molecule or crystal) to external fields, and provide insight into a molecule&#x27;s internal structure. &quot;Polarizability&quot; should &quot;not&quot; be confused with the intrinsic magnetic or electric dipole moment of an atom, molecule, or bulk substance; these do not depend on the presence of an external field.

==Electric polarizability==

===Definition===

Electric polarizability is the relative tendency of a charge distribution, like the electron cloud of an atom or molecule, to be distorted from its normal shape by an external electric field.

The polarizability formula_2 in isotropic media is defined as the ratio of the induced dipole moment formula_4 of an atom to the electric field formula_5 that produces this dipole moment.

:formula_6

Polarizability has the SI units of C·m2·V−1 = A2·s4·kg−1 while its cgs unit is cm3. Usually it is expressed in cgs units as a so-called polarizability volume, sometimes expressed in Å3 = 10−24 cm3. One can convert from SI units (formula_2) to cgs units (formula_8) as follows:

:formula_9 ≃ 8.988×1015 × formula_10

where formula_11, the vacuum permittivity, is ≈8.854 × 10−12 (F/m). If the polarizability volume in cgs units is denoted formula_8 the relation can be expressed generally (in SI) as formula_13.

The polarizability of individual particles is related to the average electric susceptibility of the medium by the Clausius–Mossotti relation: 
:formula_14
where &quot;R&quot; is the molar refractivity, formula_15 is the Avogadro constant, formula_16 is the electronic polarizability, &quot;p&quot; is the density of molecules, &quot;M&quot; is the molar mass, and formula_17 is the material&#x27;s relative permittivity or dielectric constant (or in optics, the square of the refractive index).

Polarizability for anisotropic or non-spherical media cannot in general be represented as a scalar quantity. Defining formula_2 as a scalar implies both that applied electric fields can only induce polarization components parallel to the field and that the formula_19 and formula_20 directions respond in the same way to the applied electric field. For example, an electric field in the formula_21-direction can only produce an formula_21 component in formula_4 and if that same electric field were applied in the formula_24-direction the induced polarization would be the same in magnitude but appear in the formula_24 component of formula_4. Many crystalline materials have directions that are easier to polarize than others and some even become polarized in directions perpendicular to the applied electric field, and the same thing happens with non-spherical bodies. Some molecules and materials with this sort of anisotropy are optically active, or exhibit linear birefringence of light.

===Tensor===
To describe anisotropic media a polarizability rank two tensor or formula_27 matrix formula_2 is defined,

:formula_29

so that:

:formula_30

The elements describing the response parallel to the applied electric field are those along the diagonal. A large value of formula_31 here means that an electric-field applied in the formula_21-direction would strongly polarize the material in the formula_24-direction. Explicit expressions for formula_2 have been given for homogeneous anisotropic ellipsoidal bodies.

=== Application in crystallography ===

The matrix above can be used with the molar refractivity equation and other data to produce density data for crystallography. Each polarizability measurement along with the refractive index associated with its direction will yield a direction specific density that can be used to develop an accurate three dimensional assessment of molecular stacking in the crystal. This relationship was first observed by Linus Pauling.

Polarizability and molecular property are related to refractive index and bulk property. In crystalline structures, the interactions between molecules are considered by comparing a local field to the macroscopic field. Analyzing a cubic crystal lattice, we can imagine an isotropic spherical region to represent the entire sample. Giving the region the radius formula_35, the field would be given by the volume of the sphere times the dipole moment per unit volume formula_36

:formula_4 = formula_38 formula_36

We can call our local field formula_40, our macroscopic field formula_5, and the field due to matter within the sphere, formula_42 We can then define the local field as the macroscopic field without the contribution of the internal field:

:formula_43

The polarization is proportional to the macroscopic field by formula_44 where formula_45 is the electric permittivity constant and formula_46 is the electric susceptibility. Using this proportionality, we find the local field as formula_47 which can be used in the definition of polarization

:formula_48

and simplified with formula_49 to get formula_50. These two terms can both be set equal to the other, eliminating the formula_5 term giving us 
:formula_52.

We can replace the relative permittivity formula_53 with refractive index formula_54, since formula_55 for a low-pressure gas. The number density can be related to the molecular weight formula_56 and mass density formula_57 through formula_58, adjusting the final form of our equation to include molar refractivity:

:formula_59

This equation allows us to relate bulk property (refractive index) to the molecular property (polarizability) as a function of frequency.

==Atomic and molecular polarizability==
Generally, polarizability increases as the volume occupied by electrons increases. In atoms, this occurs because larger atoms have more loosely held electrons in contrast to smaller atoms with tightly bound electrons. On rows of the periodic table, polarizability therefore decreases from left to right. Polarizability increases down on columns of the periodic table. Likewise, larger molecules are generally more polarizable than smaller ones.

Water is a very polar molecule, but alkanes and other hydrophobic molecules are more polarizable. Water with its permanent dipole is less likely to change shape due to an external electric field. Alkanes are the most polarizable molecules. Although alkenes and arenes are expected to have larger polarizability than alkanes because of their higher reactivity compared to alkanes, alkanes are in fact more polarizable. This results because of alkene&#x27;s and arene&#x27;s more electronegative sp2 carbons to the alkane&#x27;s less electronegative sp3 carbons.

Ground state electron configuration models often describe molecular or bond polarization during chemical reactions poorly, because reactive intermediates may be excited, or be the minor, alternate structures in a chemical equilibrium with the initial reactant.

==Magnetic polarizability==
Magnetic polarizability defined by spin interactions of nucleons is an important parameter of deuterons and hadrons. In particular, measurement of tensor polarizabilities of nucleons yields important information about spin-dependent nuclear forces.

The method of spin amplitudes uses quantum mechanics formalism to more easily describe spin dynamics. Vector and tensor polarization of particle/nuclei with spin are specified by the unit polarization vector formula_4 and the polarization tensor &quot;P&quot;`. Additional tensors composed of products of three or more spin matrices are needed only for the exhaustive description of polarization of particles/nuclei with spin .

<text>The Rote Flora is a former theatre in the Sternschanze district of Hamburg, Germany. It has been squatted since November 1989 as a self-managed social centre. The collective said in 2001 &quot;We are the &#x27;UFO in the neighbourhood.&#x27; The black hole in public space. The City won&#x27;t get rid of us because we are a part of what life is.&quot;

== History of the building ==
The Flora theatre was constructed on Schulterblatt in 1835. It was used for concerts, operettas, revues, and boxing matches. It became a variety theatre until it shut down after World War II. It was used as a cinema and then became a bargain store called 1000 Töpfe.

In the late 1980s, local people were alarmed by the plans of Friedrich Kurz to gentrify the theatre by making it a venue for performances of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, fearing it would attract tourists and change the area; they proposed to turn it into a community centre instead. The alternative plans were ignored by the city and the rear of the building was demolished in April 1988. Sabotage attacks began on the construction site and bowing to the local pressure, the community was given a temporary lease to use the building. When the lease expired on 1 November 1989, the occupiers stayed and the building was squatted. It was a week before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the new inhabitants said it was a &quot;free space for realizing an autonomous life.&quot; It has remained squatted ever since.

== Social centre ==
At the beginning the occupiers were very much focused on local struggles and as time went by, the Rote Flora has developed into a self-managed social centre connected to left-wing, anarchist activism, with links to similar projects in Amsterdam, Berlin and Copenhagen. Its structures of internal organisation and self-governance can be compared to a form of radical sovereign self-rule. The building provides a music venue, an infoshop, a social movement archive, a bar, a cafe, rehearsal rooms and a bicycle repair workshop. The Government of Hamburg offered to give the project a contract in the early 1990s but the offer was refused. Later, it decided to sell the building to a developer called Klausmartin Kretschmer for 370,000 DM, with the proviso that it would remain a social centre. When a well-known neo-Nazi was given a social housing apartment in a block behind the project in the 1990s, Rote Flora organised demonstrations against his tenancy.

The collective said in 2001 &quot;We are the &#x27;UFO in the neighbourhood.&#x27; The black hole in public space. The City won&#x27;t get rid of us because we are a part of what life is.&quot; Regarding the new owner, it said &quot;We neither asked Kretschmer to buy the Flora almost nine years ago, nor are we in the slightest interested in his opinions about the political ideologies and the work of the Rote Flora&quot;. The contract Kretschmer had signed with the city expired in 2011, the Rote Flora started a campaign of resistance called &quot;Flora remains incompatible&quot; (German: &#x27;Flora bleibt unverträglich&#x27;) to campaign against possible eviction. The city offered him 1.1 million euros to buy back the building, but he requested 5 million euros. In December 2013, the city&#x27;s decision to redevelop the Rote Flora site became the focus of large and sometimes violent demonstrations. Ultimately, in mid-January 2014, the borough of Altona announced a change in plans for the site that would ensure the building would not be demolished and could remain a cultural centre. Mayor Olaf Scholz agreed to pay Kretschmer 820,000 euros, whilst two security guards swore under oath that Kretschmer had wanted to pay them to burn the building down to get rid of it. Later in 2014, the Rota Flora celebrated 25 years of existence.

During the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit, the Rote Flora was a major hotspot and following riots in the Schanzeviertel rightwing commentators demanded that the Rote Flora be closed down. The Rote Flora distanced itself from the rioters, with a spokesperson saying that &quot;that a form of militancy was brought onto the streets which was intoxicated with itself, and we find that both politically and in terms of content wrong&quot; (&quot;dass hier eine Form von Militanz auf die Straße getragen wurde, die sich selbst berauscht hat und das finden wir politisch und inhaltlich falsch&quot;). A former police officer who studies left-wing politics wrote that activists spend a lot of time maintaining and organising the Rote Flora, time which then takes them away from other political projects.

As well as being a centre of left-wing activism, the Rote Flora has become a destination for alternative tourism, since the Schanzeviertel is gentrifying. Rules posted at the door of the centre in 2018 state: &quot;We will not tolerate any kind of sexism, racism, anti-Semitism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, lookism or any kind of boundary-crossing behaviour here.&quot; The Rote Flora collective gave the building the address of Achidi-John Platz 1 to commemorate a man, Achidi John, who died in 2001 after being forced by police officers to swallow an emetic.

<text>The Kuss-Walzer (Kiss Waltz), Op. 400 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II composed in 1881. The waltz was originally dedicated to his second wife, Angelika Dittrich (1850–1919), but Strauss withdrew that dedication after their divorce in 1882. The waltz comprises melodies from Strauss&#x27; popular operetta &quot;Der lustige Krieg&quot; (The Merry War) and is an orchestral treatment of the act 2 aria &quot;Nur für Natur&quot; which was a hit when first performed. Eduard Strauss, the composer&#x27;s brother, first conducted the orchestral piece at the Court Ball in Vienna in 1882.

The introduction consists of arresting chords in the key of G major before proceeding discreetly into a quiet yet poignant waltz theme. The Kiss Waltz differs from Strauss&#x27; other waltzes in that the first theme recurs very often, and there are only three other waltz sections of which the first theme would be played again after concluding those successive sections. Despite being of such an economical structure, the waltz was well received at its first performance.

<text>The United Kingdom first participated in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest at the inaugural which took place in Copenhagen, Denmark. ITV, a member organisation of the United Kingdom Independent Broadcasting (UKIB) and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), was responsible for the selection process of their participation from 2003 to . The United Kingdom used a national selection format, broadcasting a show entitled &quot;Junior Eurovision Song Contest: The British Final&quot;, for their participation at the contests. The first representative to participate for the nation at the 2003 contest was Tom Morley with the song &quot;My Song For The World&quot;, which finished in third place out of sixteen participating entries, achieving a score of one hundred and eighteen points. The United Kingdom withdrew from competing after the , but returned to the contest in in Yerevan, Armenia, with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) replacing ITV as the country&#x27;s broadcaster. The country withdrew again from the 2024 contest in Madrid.

==History==
The United Kingdom is one of the sixteen countries to have made its debut at the inaugural Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2003, which took place on 15 November 2003 at the Forum in Copenhagen, Denmark. Child-singer, Tom Morley, was the first participant to represent the United Kingdom with the song &quot;My Song For The World&quot;, which finished in third place out of sixteen participating entries, achieving a score of one hundred and eighteen points. Morley and Cory Spedding () sang both for the peace in the world and Joni Fuller () described her feelings. The country&#x27;s best result at the contest was placing second in 2004 with the song &quot;The Best is Yet to Come&quot;. The remaining British entrant finished in fourteenth position in 2005.

In 2003, the contest was broadcast live on the main channel ITV1, however the broadcaster decided to relegate it and the national final to digital channel ITV2 for the next two years due to poor viewing figures that year, before their complete withdrawal in . A delayed broadcast, consisting of highlights, was aired the following afternoon on the main channel in 2004 and 2005. The inaugural contest, broadcast live on ITV1, averaged 5 million viewers. 1.9 million watched the 2004 contest on delay on ITV1 (221,000 watched the live coverage on ITV2). In 2005, the contest was watched by 700,000 viewers on ITV1 (down 63.16% compared with 2004 viewing figures), with 171,000 watching live on ITV2 (down 22.62% compared with 2004).

The contest originally should have been organised by Carlton Television for ITV in Manchester. In May 2003, it was confirmed that the UK would take part in Copenhagen and host the next edition. ITV then announced in May 2004 that due to financial and scheduling reasons, the contest would in fact not take place in the United Kingdom after all. In August 2004, it was reported that Granada Television, who would have co-produced the show with Carlton, had decided to pull out of the deal claiming that the original allocated budget of to produce the contest was too small. The EBU reportedly offered a further of funding to produce the contest, but ITV stated that it would have cost almost to do so, and they asked the EBU to find a new host broadcaster. It is also thought that another factor to their decision was the previous years&#x27; audience ratings for ITV which were below the expected amount.

===Radio broadcasts===
On 21 November 2013, it was revealed that Edinburgh-based 98.8 Castle FM (a non EBU member) would broadcast the live to listeners in Scotland. The broadcasting rights had been offered by the EBU to its members, however when no-one in the UK took up the offer, Castle FM – previously known as Leith FM – moved in. The commentators were Ewan Spence and Luke Fisher.

It was announced on 16 October 2014 that the contest would be broadcast on a radio station across the United Kingdom. Five local radio stations broadcast the contest, one in England (103 The Eye, delayed) and Wales (Oystermouth Radio), and three in Scotland (K107 in Kircaldy, Radio Six International in Glasgow and Shore Radio in Edinburgh). Cotswold FM, Fun Kids, Oystermouth Radio, Radio Six International and Shore Radio transmitted the contest live with commentary again provided by Ewan Spence.

On 9 November 2016, Radio Six International announced that they would broadcast the contest live. Ewan Spence, Lisa-Jayne Lewis, Sharleen Wright and Ben Robertson provided the commentary for the radio stations Radio Six International, Fun Kids and 103 The Eye.

===Welsh debut===
The Welsh broadcaster Sianel Pedwar Cymru (S4C) had shown interest in participating for the UK in , hoping to share the Welsh language with a wider audience. Before the digital switchover, the contest would therefore be a bilingual broadcast that would be broadcast in Wales on analogue, and on S4C Digidol in the rest of the UK. In the end, S4C chose not to broadcast the contest. S4C announced on 9 May 2018 that they would debut at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018 to be held in Minsk, Belarus. However, S4C withdrew from the contest in , citing the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason for their withdrawal, and have not returned to the contest since.

It was also reported that Scottish broadcaster BBC Alba had also been in talks with the EBU to enable Scotland to participate in , having previously debuted in Eurovision Choir in . However, on 29 June 2019, BBC Alba announced that they would not debut in 2020.

===UK return===
In July 2020, it was reported that the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) were considering participation in the upcoming contest in Warsaw. The UK did not appear on the official list of participants as released by the EBU on 8 September 2020. At a Junior Eurovision press event in May 2021, the EBU stated that they were working to bring the United Kingdom back to the contest, possibly for the 2021 edition. However, once again the United Kingdom did not appear on the final list of participants for the 2021 contest which took place in Paris. On 17 December 2021, at a press conference between France Télévisions and the executive supervisor of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest Martin Österdahl, Österdahl stated that he was positive about talks between the European Broadcasting Union and the BBC about a potential return of the UK to the contest in the future. On 11 January 2022, it was speculated that the BBC were looking to return to the contest in 2023, the year marking the 20th anniversary of the first contest. On 25 August 2022, it was confirmed that the United Kingdom would return to the contest in , with the BBC replacing ITV as the country&#x27;s broadcaster. The BBC internally selected Freya Skye to represent the United Kingdom with the song &quot;Lose My Head&quot; after an audition process held by the broadcaster. The British return proved successful, with Skye placing fifth with 146 points, winning the online vote. In 2023, the BBC continued the internal process, selecting girl group Stand Uniqu3 to represent the United Kingdom in Nice, France with the song &quot;Back To Life&quot;. At the contest, the UK improved on the fifth place position, placing fourth overall with 160 points, the best result for the United Kingdom since 2004.

===Second withdrawal===
Despite two top-5 placings in and , on 21 June 2024, the BBC announced that the United Kingdom would withdraw from the contest. According to an article posted by The Euro Trip Podcast on the same day, a spokesperson from the BBC stated the following, &quot;We sometimes have to make difficult decisions and the BBC will not participate in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest this year. We would like to thank the artists and creative teams who represented the UK for the last two years.&quot; It has also been suggested that low viewership of the junior contest in the UK, which moved from BBC One to BBC Two in 2023, could also be a reason that supported the country&#x27;s withdrawal in 2024. Furthermore, the CBBC channel, which aired both contests after the BBC&#x27;s return in 2022, was scheduled to close in 2025 and transition to an online service. This change may have influenced the decision to withdraw, as the contest is a live event. However, the BBC&#x27;s Annual Report for 2024–25 did not reference the closure, and in January 2025, the head of children&#x27;s programming at the BBC confirmed that the channel had been saved from closure.

<text>Man lebt nur einmal! (, &quot;You Only Live Once!&quot;) is a waltz by Johann Strauss II written in 1855. The piece was marked as &quot;im Ländlerstyle&quot; which in other words means &quot;in the same style as the Ländler&quot;, which is an Austrian folk dance. The title was a quotation from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s 1774 play &quot;Clavigo&quot;, but it raised a few eyebrows at that time as Vienna was just recovering from a disastrous cholera epidemic and many of the stricken populace may have been superstitious of such a title. Nonetheless, Strauss performed it at the Sperl Ballroom to great acclaim and this waltz has endured lasting appeal even in a simple string arrangement for a quintet consisting of two violins, one viola, one cello, and a double bass.

The introduction is a rustic Austrian countryside evocation, with flutes announcing the first bars. The first waltz section is undoubtedly Viennese in character however, with a similar mood second part of the first section. The sections 2 to 4 are genial and unsurprisingly cheerful whereas the fifth section is an excellent landler adaptation. The coda is short with the first waltz theme making a quiet reentry. As the waltz proceeds to its close, a short snatch from the introduction melody comes in again before its anticipated ending.

<text>Field (1991) is a sculpture by British artist Antony Gormley. It consists of approx. 35,000 individual terracotta figures, each between 8 and 26 cm high, installed on the floor of a room facing the viewer. The figures were sculpted in Cholula, Mexico by about 60 members of a Texca family of brickmakers, under the supervision of the artist. The sculpture received a lot of media attention upon its first display, and many affectionate parodies.

&quot;Field&quot; has been installed and displayed at various locations. The specific configuration is changed to suit each location, but the miniature figures are always placed to form a dense carpet with each figure looking towards the viewer. Ideally the Field is extended through a doorway or round a corner, so that the figures going out of sight leave the impression of an unlimited horde.

Several other versions of &quot;Field&quot; have subsequently been created, including
*&quot;Amazonian Field&quot; (1991) made in Porto Velho, Brazil (approx. 24,000 figures)
*&quot;Field for the British Isles&quot; (1993) made in St Helens near Liverpool in the UK (approx. 40,000 figures)
*&quot;European Field&quot; (1993) made in Östra Grevie, Sweden (approx. 40,000 figures)
*&quot;Asian Field&quot; (2003) made in Xiangshan County, Guangdong, Guangdong province, People&#x27;s Republic of China (approx. 190,000 figures)
*&quot;Field for the Art Gallery of New South Wales&quot; (1989) 

&quot;Field for the British Isles&quot; was typical in recruiting some 100 volunteers from the pupils and their extended families, of two local schools in St Helens. Each volunteer was given a portion of the 30 tonnes of clay required, along with some loose instructions specifying the rough size and proportions for the figures. An accidental feature of the original Field was that Texca family involved people aged from 6 to 60 working on the figures, and Gormley felt that the involvement of three generations of a family should be continued in all the subsequent versions.

Gormley has also made several other works entitled &quot;Field&quot;, but these are smaller groups of life size figures more typical of Gormley&#x27;s earlier work.

In 1994, Gormley won the Turner prize with a collection of his work, including &quot;Field for the British Isles&quot;, shown at the Tate Gallery.

<text>The Battle of Modlin took place during the 1939 German invasion of Poland at the beginning of the Second World War. Modlin Fortress was initially the headquarters of the Modlin Army until its retreat eastwards. From 13 to 29 September 1939, it served as a defensive citadel for Polish forces under the command of General Wiktor Thommée against assaulting German units. The fighting was closely linked with the strategic situation of the Battle of Warsaw.

The Polish forces defending the fortress included the armoured train &quot;Śmierć&quot; (&quot;death&quot;) and the Modlin anti-aircraft battery, which was credited with shooting down more &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; planes than any other in the entire September campaign.

Fortress Modlin capitulated on 29 September, one of the last to lay down its arms in the campaign, and surrendered 24,000 troops. Several days earlier, Rochus Misch had attempted to negotiate the surrender of the fortress despite being wounded, an act for which he was awarded the Iron Cross.

Soldiers of the Panzer Division Kempf committed the Massacre in Zakroczym on 28 September 1939.

<text>Wiener Frauen or &#x27;Viennese Ladies&#x27; op. 423 is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II in 1886.

The waltz was originally titled &#x27;Les dames de St. Peterburgh&#x27; when Strauss was invited by the &#x27;Russian Red Cross Society&#x27; to conduct in St. Petersburg in that year.

Strauss first performed the piece at the riding school of the Horse Guards Regiment in that city to great acclaim and was thoughtful enough to re-christen the waltz &#x27;Wiener Frauen&#x27; in a homage to his Viennese admirers when he had it performed in Vienna later that year.

The piece was among Strauss&#x27;s last great waltzes and it brims with youthful vigour yet with hints of pensiveness and poignant moments as was common among his last works. The waltz was also first performed with its lesser-known &#x27;sister work&#x27; Adele-Walzer op. 424 in the same hall and was dedicated to the composer&#x27;s third wife Adele Strauss.

<text>Skënder Gjinushi (born 24 December 1949 in Vlorë, Albania) is an Albanian politician and academic. He has served in several high-ranking positions in the Albanian government, including as Speaker of Parliament and Deputy Prime Minister. He founded the Social Democratic Party of Albania and served as its chairman from 1991 to 2019. He is currently serving as the president of the Academy of Sciences of Albania.

== Early life and academic career ==
Skënder Gjinushi was born 24 December 1949 in Vlorë. He was educated at a high school in Tirana, and graduated from the University of Tirana in 1972 with a degree in mathematics. He completed postgraduate studies at Pierre and Marie Curie University in France, earning a doctoral degree in functional analysis. He has published several articles in mathematics.

== Political career ==
Gjinushi was Minister of Education from 1987 to 1991, during Albania&#x27;s communist regime. In 1991, after the fall of communism, he founded the Social Democratic Party of Albania (PSD), and served as the party&#x27;s first chairman.

Gjinushi was elected to Parliament in the 1992 elections. He served as Speaker of Parliament from 1997 to 2001. He then had a stint as Deputy Prime Minister from 2001 to 2002, in the Meta II and Majko II governments. During this period, he also served as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs.

In 2000, &quot;Koha Jonë&quot; published an interview with Dhori Kule, a former secretary-general of the PSD. In the interview Kule accused PSD leaders of corruption and nepotism, and was particularly critical of Gjinushi. Gjinushi responded to the interview, which referred to him as a &quot;dangerous mafioso in politics&quot;, by bringing libel charges against the reporter who conducted it. The case has been cited as an example of the Albanian government&#x27;s failure to protect press freedoms.

== Return to academics ==
Gjinushi was elected president of the Academy of Sciences of Albania on 24 May 2019. This election was accused of being a political appointment by Prime Minister Edi Rama, who threatened to withhold funding if Gjinushi was not elected. For several years prior, Gjinushi had been a member of the Academy in violation of the law, which states that no one holding a political position may be a member. At a press conference immediately after his election was announced, Gjinushi sexually harassed a female journalist.

President of Albania Ilir Meta refused to approve Gjinushi&#x27;s election, citing his leadership of the PSD while competing for the position. The day after Meta&#x27;s statement, the Academy called his refusal &quot;absolutely invalid&quot;. Consequently, Parliament passed a law stating that the Academy can override the president&#x27;s veto, giving it the power to complete Gjinushi&#x27;s nomination. Gjinushi was ultimately confirmed as president of the Academy.

As a result of his election, Gjinushi resigned from the PSD, and was replaced as party leader by Ëngjëll Bejtaj.

== Personal life ==
Gjinushi is married and has two children.

<text>The Stone Soupercomputer was a Beowulf-style computer cluster built at the US Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the late 1990s.

A group of lab employees including William W. Hargrove and Forrest M. Hoffman applied for a grant to build a cluster in 1996, but it was rejected. 
They decided to build a cluster anyway, using desktop personal computers that had been discarded as being too slow. The name was derived from the story of stone soup.
The developers used freely available and open source software such as Linux operating system, the Parallel Virtual Machine toolkit, and the Message Passing Interface library.

By early 1997 the first applications were running on the cluster. By May 2001 it had 133 nodes. They included Intel 80486 and Pentium-based machines as well as a few DEC Alpha workstations. Low-cost Ethernet networking was used for interconnection instead of any special-purpose network. The cluster was the subject of an article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine in 2001. Many applications were developed on this system that could then be deployed on other, faster clusters. The stone cluster was no longer in use by August 2003.
This approach was used as a model for other educational cluster projects.

<text>Elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly were held on 25 November 1917. Organized as a result of events in the February Revolution, the elections took place two months after they had been originally meant to occur. They are generally recognised as the first free elections in Russian history, though they did not produce a democratically elected government, as the Bolsheviks subsequently disbanded the Constituent Assembly and proceeded to rule the country as a one-party state with all opposition parties banned.

Various academic studies have given alternative results. However, all indicate that the Bolsheviks were clear winners in the urban centres, and also took around two-thirds of the votes of soldiers on the Western Front. Nevertheless, the Socialist-Revolutionary party topped the polls, winning a plurality of seats (no party won a majority) on the strength of support from the country&#x27;s rural peasantry, who were for the most part one-issue voters, that issue being land reform.

Some modern Marxist theoreticians have contested the view that a one-party state was a natural outgrowth of the Bolsheviks&#x27; actions. George Novack stressed the initial efforts by the Bolsheviks to form a government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and bring other parties such as the Mensheviks into political legality. Tony Cliff argued the Bolshevik-Left Socialist Revolutionary coalition government dissolved the Constituent Assembly due to a number of reasons. They cited outdated voter-rolls that did not acknowledge the split within the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the assembly&#x27;s conflict with the elected Russian Congress of the Soviets as an alternative, democratic structure. The dissolution of the Constituent Assembly was also approved by the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and anarchists; both groups were in favour of a more extensive democracy.

== Background ==
The convocation of a Constituent Assembly had been a long-standing demand of the democratic and popular movements in Tsarist Russia. In the later phase of the February Revolution, Tsar Nicolas II abdicated on March 2, 1917. The Russian Provisional Government was formed and pledged to carry through with holding elections for a Constituent Assembly. Consensus emerged between all major political parties to go ahead with the election. Nevertheless, the various political parties were divided over many details on the organization of the impending election. The Bolsheviks demanded immediate elections, whilst the Socialist-Revolutionaries wanted to postpone the vote for several months for it not to collide with the harvest season. Right-wing forces also pushed for delay of the election.

On March 19, 1917 a mass rally was held in Petrograd, demanding female suffrage. The march gathered some 40,000 participants. The protest was led by Vera Figner and Poliksena Shishkina-Iavein. It moved from the Petrograd City Duma to the Tauride Palace, and the demonstrators refused to vacate the palace grounds before the Provisional Government and the Soviet committed to female suffrage. On July 20, 1917, the Provisional Government issued a decree awarding voting rights for women aged 20 years and above.

In May the political parties agreed on main principles of the election (proportional representation, universal suffrage and secret ballot). A special electoral commission was set up, composed of multiple lawyers and legal experts. The following month September 17, 1917 was set as the election date. The new Constituent Assembly was supposed to have its first meeting on September 30, 1917.

In July the left-wing parties increased their pressure on the Provisional Government, reaching a nearly insurrectionist situation. In the end, the following month the left consented to a further postponement. On August 9, 1917 a new date for the election was set by the Provisional Government: voting on November 12 and the first session of the Constituent Assembly would be held on November 28, 1917.

Between the finalization of candidate lists and the election, the October Revolution broke out. The October Revolution ended the reign of the Provisional Government. A new Soviet government took charge of the country, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. Nevertheless, the new government pledged to go ahead with the election and that its rule remained provisional until its authority would be confirmed by the Constituent Assembly.

== Electoral system ==

81 electoral districts () were formed by the Provisional Government. Electoral districts were generally set up on (pre-revolutionary) governorate or ethnic oblast boundaries. Moreover, there were electoral districts for the different army groups and fleets. There were also an electoral district assigned for the workers at the Chinese Eastern Railroad and one electoral district for the soldiers of the Russian Expeditionary Corps in France and the Balkans (with some 20,000 voters).

No official electoral census exists. The estimated population of eligible voters at the time (excluding occupied territories) has been estimated at around 85 million; the number of eligible voters in the districts where polling took place has been estimated at around 80 million.

Each party had a separate ballot with a list with names of candidates, there was no general ballot. The voter would either have received copies of different party lists in advance or at the polling station. The voter would select one list, place it in an envelope, seal it and place it in the box. If any name was scratched, the vote would be invalid.

==Voting==
The voting began on November 12–14, 1917. The election was at the time the largest election organized in history. However, only in 39 districts did the election take place as scheduled. In many districts the voting occurred in late November or early December, and in some remote places the vote took place only in early January 1918.

In spite of war and turmoil, some 47 million voters exercised their franchise, with a national voter turnout of around 64% (per Protasov (2004)). According to Protasov (2004), the countryside generally had a higher voter turnout than the cities. 220 cities across the country, with a combined population of seven million, had a voter turnout of 58%. In agrarian provinces turnout generally ranged from 62 to 80%. In Tambov province urban areas had a turnout of 50.2% while rural areas had 74.5%. According to Radkey (1989) national voter turnout stood at around 55%.

== Competing parties ==
=== Socialist-Revolutionaries ===
The Socialist-Revolutionaries emerged as the most voted party in the election, swaying the broad majority of the peasant vote. The agrarian programmes of the SR and Bolshevik parties were largely similar, but the peasantry were more familiar with the SRs. The Bolsheviks lacked an organizational presence in many rural areas. In areas where the Bolshevik electoral campaign had been active (for example, near to towns or garrisons) the peasant vote was somewhat evenly divided between SRs and Bolsheviks.

Moreover, whilst the SRs enjoyed widespread support among the peasantry, the party lacked a strong organizational structure in rural areas. The party was highly dependent on peasant union, zemstvos, cooperatives and soviets.

On the issue of war and peace, the SR leadership had vowed not to enter into a separate peace with the Central Powers. The SR leadership condemned the peace talks initiated by the Bolsheviks, but to what extent the SR&#x27;s were prepared to continue the war was unclear at the time. Along with the Mensheviks, the SRs supported the notion of engaging with other European socialist politicians to find a settlement to the ongoing World War.

The filing of nominations for the election took place just as the split in the SR party was taking place. By late October, when the SR party lists were already set, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries formed a separate party. But whilst by the time of the election the Left SRs had constituted a separate party, the split was not completed in local SR party branches until early 1918. The Kazan, Yaroslavl, Kazan and Kronstadt SR organizations went over to the Left SRs en bloc. In Ufa and Pskov the majority in the SR party organization crossed over to the Left SRs. In Petrograd the leftist faction had dominated the SR party branch prior to the October Revolution, but elsewhere the majority in the party organizations remained with the PSR. Notably in some of the locations leftist and rightist SR lists were separately presented (Baltic Fleet, Petrograd, Kazan), the leftists prevailed over the rightists, leading D&#x27;Agostino (2011) to argue that had separate right/left SRs lists been presented nationwide the peasantry could have opted for the left (considering that there were no major difference between the factions on their agrarian programmes).

A key Bolshevik argument against the legitimacy of the Constituent Assembly once it was elected was the fact that the lists had been finalized before the Left SRs constituted themselves as a separate party, and that if the Left SRs had stood separately the Bolshevik and Left SR would have won the majority vote. This was despite the Left SR&#x27;s eventual opposition to the closure of the Constituent Assembly by the Bolsheviks. Per Serge&#x27;s account, 40 of 339 elected SR deputies were leftists and 50 belong to Chernov&#x27;s centrist faction. Smith points out that though the association with Soviet power strengthened the PLSR popularity in the countryside, the schism did not transform the PLSR overnight into a large and well-organized political party, and during the following months of 1918 the PSR managed to regain control over some of the soviets and local branches it lost to the left.

=== Bolsheviks ===
In 1917 the Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) had begun to allow mass membership, without consulting with Lenin. On July 1, 1917 the Central Committee sent out an instruction to local party organizations to build a broad democratic unity ahead of the elections, to reach out to Menshevik-Internationalists, left-wing SRs and trade unions. In the wake of the abortive July uprising (organized by the revolutionary Petrograd Bolshevik Committee and the Military Organization), the moderates of the Central Committee again appealed to build a left socialist bloc and invited the Menshevik-Internationalists to attend the upcoming party congress as observers. With the election finally approaching, Lenin took a tough stance towards the Central Committee. He deplored the absence of proletarians from the list of proposed candidates that the Central Committee had adopted, charging the Committee with opening the doors for opportunists. In Lenin&#x27;s view, only workers would be able to create alliances with the peasantry. Lenin also criticised the list for including many recent arrivals to the party who had not yet been tested in &quot;proletarian work in our Party&#x27;s spirit.&quot; While Lenin believed that some new members of the Bolsheviks, in particular Leon Trotsky (who had fought for the merger of his Mezhraiontsy faction into the Bolshevik Party since his return to Russia and had &quot;proved himself equal to the task and a loyal supporter of the party of the revolutionary proletariat&quot;), were acceptable candidates, placing large numbers of untested new members on the Bolshevik ballot opened the party&#x27;s doors to careerism.

The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) campaigned for bread, peace and a government of Soviets. But the party leadership was divided on the issue of the Constituent Assembly. The moderates in the Central Committee held the opinion that the Constituent Assembly should become the supreme body to decide the future path of Russia. Lenin opposed this line. In an article edited after the elections, he stated that the proletariat cannot achieve victory if it does not win the majority of the population to its side. But to limit that winning to polling a majority of votes in an election under the rule of the bourgeoisie, or to make it the condition for it, is crass stupidity, or else sheer deception of the workers. In order to win the majority of the population to its side the proletariat must, in the first place, overthrow the bourgeoisie and seize state power; secondly, it must introduce Soviet power and completely smash the old state apparatus, whereby it immediately undermines the rule, prestige and influence of the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois compromisers over the non-proletarian working people. Thirdly, it must entirely destroy the influence of the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois compromisers over the majority of the non-proletarian masses by satisfying their economic needs in a revolutionary way at the expense of the exploiters.

The party emerged victorious in the two main cities; Petrograd and Moscow, and emerged the major party in urban Russia overall. It won an absolute majority of votes in the Baltic Fleet, the Northern Front and the Western Front. The call for immediate peace made the Bolsheviks popular in the military, winning around 42% of the votes from the armed forces. Often the election result is portrayed as an indicator for impopularity of the Bolsheviks, but as per Victor Serge the strong showing of the Bolshevik vote in the main cities 18 days after the October Revolution broke out shows that there was a popular mandate from the industrial workers for the Revolution.

=== Mensheviks ===
By the time of the election, the Mensheviks had lost most of their influence in the workers&#x27; soviets. The election result confirmed the marginalization of the Mensheviks, obtaining a little over a million votes. In a fifth of the constituencies, pro-war Mensheviks and Internationalists ran on competing slates and in Petrograd and Kharkov the defencists had set up their own local organizations. Nearly half of the Menshevik vote came from Georgia.

=== Kadets ===
The Kadet party had changed its name to &#x27;People&#x27;s Freedom Party&#x27; by 1917, but the new name was rarely used. Kadets campaigned for national unity, law and order, honour commitments to the allies of Russia and &#x27;honorable peace&#x27;. The Kadets condemned Bolsheviks in election campaign. The Kadets had sought to build a broad democratic coalition, setting up a liaison committee for alliances (Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, Andrei Ivanovich Shingarev and M. S. Adzhemov) but this effort failed as the Popular Socialists and cooperative movement rejected electoral pacts with the Kadets.

Whilst the Kadets emerged as the main losers in the election, they did take a sizable share of the votes in the largest cities. However the Kadets were hurt by abstention amongst urban intelligentsia voters. They had also lost a large share of their habitual Jewish intelligentsia vote to Jewish national coalition lists.

=== Popular Socialists ===
The congress of the Popular Socialists, held on September 26, 1917, rejected the notion of an electoral alliance with the Kadets. The party congress ordered that joint lists would only be organized with fellow socialist groups. The Popular Socialists condemned Bolsheviks in their campaigning, whilst stressing the defencist line of their own party.

=== Cooperative movement ===
The cooperative societies held an emergency congress on October 4, 1917, at which it was decided that they would contest the Constituent Assembly elections directly. The congress discarded the notion of electoral pacts with non-socialist groups. In the Petrograd election district, the list of cooperative candidates included only one notable figure, Alexander Chayanov. The other six candidates were largely unknown.

=== National minorities ===
Most non-Russian voters opted for national minority parties. In the case of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party dominated the 4 electoral districts of the Ukrainian peasantry. Non-Ukrainian urban populations largely voted for Russian parties. In the city of Kiev, the Ukrainian parties obtained 26% of the vote. Over half a million soldiers and officers in the army and navy voted for Ukrainian parties supporting the Central Rada, making the Ukrainians the third force among military voters.

However, in Belarus, Belarusian nationalist groups gathered less than 1% of the votes. In Transcaucasus the vote was divided between Georgians (voting for Mensheviks), Armenians (voting for the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, also known as ) and Azeris (voting for Musavat and other Muslim groups). Tatar and Bashkir lists gathered 55% of the votes in Ufa.

In July 1917 the First All-Kazakh Congress was held, establishing the Alash Party as a national political party. The party called for the &#x27;liberation of the Kazakh people from colonial yoke&#x27;. Ahead of the election, party committees were formed in Semipalatinsk, Omsk, Akmolinsk and Uralsk. In the Semirechie, Syr-Darya and Horde electoral districts Alash did not field lists of their own, but placed candidates of other Muslim lists. Four days ahead of the vote the newspaper &quot;Qazaq&quot; published the Alash programme, including a call for a democratic federal republic with equality of nationalities.

In 14 electoral districts, 2 or more Jewish lists were in the fray. In Zhitomir, 5 out of 13 parties contesting were Jewish. In Gomel 4 out of 11 parties were Jewish, in Poltava 5 out of 14. Some 80% of the votes cast for Jewish parties went to Jewish national coalition lists. The Folkspartey was the most enthusiastic proponent of Jewish national coalition lists. These coalitions, generally contesting under titles such as &#x27;Jewish National Bloc&#x27; or &#x27;Jewish National Election Committee&#x27; also gathered Zionists and Orthodox Jews. The candidates on these lists had vowed to form a common bloc in the Constituent Assembly and implement decisions of the All-Russian Jewish Congress. The Jewish national lists were confronted by the various Jewish socialist parties; the General Jewish Labour Bund, the Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party (Poalei Zion) and the United Jewish Socialist Workers Party (). The Bund carried out 200 electoral meetings in White Russia (with a total attendance of about 127,000), and in Ukraine the party held 2-3 electoral meetings weekly. In Odessa confrontations between socialist and non-socialist Jewish parties led to physical violence. Jewish national lists elected Iu. D. Brutskus, A.M. Goldstein, the Moscow rabbi Yaakov Mazeh. V. I. Temkin, D. M. Kogan-Bernsthein, N. S. Syrkin and O. O. Gruzenberg (who was then close to Zionist circles). David Lvovich was elected on SR-Fareynikte list and the Bundist G.I. Lure was elected on a Menshevik-Bund list.

The Buryat National Committee had previously been linked to the SRs, but ahead of the election relation was broken. Buryat SRs were not given prominent places on candidate lists, and the Buryat National Committee ended up contesting on its own.

=== Others ===
Radical Democrats (rightists) got some 19,000 votes.

== Results ==
=== National results ===
:&quot;No fully complete account of the results of the 1917 election exists, as in several districts the holding of the election or the tallying of votes was interrupted. The numbers in the table below represent accounts from the voting in 70 out of 81 electoral districts, although not all of those districts have complete voting tallies. The tally of elected deputies stems from 74 districts.&quot;

=== Svyatitsky and Lenin ===
There are various different accounts of the election result, with varying numbers. Many accounts on the election result originate from N. V. Svyatitsky&#x27;s account, who was himself elected as an SR deputy to the Constituent Assembly. His article was included in the one-year anniversary symposium of the Russian Revolution organized by the SR party (Moscow, Zemlya i Volya Publishers, 1918). Lenin (1919) describes Svyatitsky&#x27;s account as extremely interesting. It presented results from 54 electoral districts, covering most of European Russia and Siberia. Notably is lacked details from the Olonets, Estonian, Kaluga, Bessarabian, Podolsk, Orenburg, Yakutsk, Don governorates, as well as Transcaucasus. All in all, Svyatitsky&#x27;s account includes 36,257,960 votes. According to Lenin, the actual number from said 54 electoral districts was 36,262,560 votes. But Lenin reaffirms that between Svyatitisky&#x27;s article and his account, the number of votes cast by party is largely identical.

=== Radkey and Spirin ===
More recent studies often use Svyatitsky&#x27;s 1918 account as their starting point for further elaboration. L. M. Spirin (1987) uses local newspapers and Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian archival holdings to supplement Svyatitsky, whereas U.S. historian Oliver Henry Radkey predominately uses local newspapers as sources. According to Rabinovitch (2016), Spirin&#x27;s account is the most complete. According to Arato (2017), U.S. scholar Radkey is the most serious historian on the 1917 election.

Radkey uses a number of uses broad categories in presenting the result party-wise: SRs (sometimes distinguished between left/right), Bolsheviks, Mensheviks (sometimes divided between Menshevik-Internationalists and Right-wing pro-war Mensheviks), Other Socialists (with subcategories) Kadets, Special interests (including subcategories peasants, landowners, Cossacks, middle-class, others), Religious (Orthodox, Old Believers, others), Ukrainian (with subcategories), Turkic-Tatar (with subcategories), Other Nationalities (with subcategories).

=== Deputies elected ===
Protasov (2004) presents the party affiliation of 765 deputies elected from 73 electoral districts: 345 SRs, 47 Ukrainian SRs, 175 Bolsheviks, 17 Mensheviks, 7 Ukrainian Social Democrats, 14 Kadets, 2 Popular Socialists, another 32 Ukrainian socialists (possibly SRs or social democrats), 13 Muslim Socialists, 10 Dashnaks, 68 from other national parties, 16 Cossacks, 10 Christians and one clergyman. Another 55 deputies were supposed to have been elected from another 8 electoral districts. Of the over 700 deputies known by name, over 400 participated at first session and only session of the Constituent Assembly (240 of the assembled belonged to the SR bloc).

Several prominent politicians had stood as candidates in multiple electoral districts. The Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) had named Lenin as their candidate in 5 districts: Petrograd City, Petrograd Province, Ufa, Baltic Fleet and Northern Front. Lenin was also nominated from Moscow City. On November 27 (December 10) the All-Russia Committee for Elections to the Constituent Assembly requested members of the Constituent Assembly who had been returned by several areas to present a written statement indicating the electoral district for which they accepted election. Having been elected by several areas, Lenin, too, presented such a statement. Lenin opted to represent the Baltic Fleet in the Constituent Assembly. In case an elected candidate didn&#x27;t send in such a statement, the All-Russian Election Commission for the Constituent Assembly would consider the person elected from the district where he obtained the highest number of votes.

== Dissolution of Constituent Assembly by Bolsheviks ==

The All Russian Constituent Assembly (Всероссийское Учредительное собрание, Vserossiyskoye Uchreditelnoye sobraniye) convened only for 13 hours, from 4 p.m. to 5 a.m., , whereupon it was dissolved by the Bolshevik-controlled All-Russian Central Executive Committee, making the Bolshevik Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets the new governing body of Russia.

<text>Wise Children (1991) was the last novel written by Angela Carter. The novel follows the fortunes of twin chorus girls, Dora and Nora Chance, and their bizarre theatrical family. It explores the subversive nature of fatherhood, the denying of which leads Nora and Dora to frivolous &quot;illegitimate&quot; lechery. The novel plays on Carter&#x27;s admiration of Shakespeare and her love of fairy tales and the surreal, incorporating a large amount of magical realism and elements of the carnivalesque that probes and twists our expectations of reality and society.

==Background==
Angela Carter wrote this novel after she knew she had been diagnosed with lung cancer. She was married with a small son.

==Plot summary==
The story begins on the 75th birthday of identical twin sisters, Dora and Nora Chance. By what Dora, who is also the narrator of the story, describes as a bizarre coincidence, it is also the 100th birthday of their natural father, Melchior Hazard, and his fraternal twin brother, Peregrine Hazard, who is believed to be dead. The date is also Shakespeare&#x27;s supposed birthday – 23 April.

Dora and Nora&#x27;s birthday gets off to a dramatic start when their half-brother, Tristram Hazard, who believes himself to be the nephew of the twins, arrives on their doorstep. He announces that Tiffany – his partner, and the goddaughter of the twins – is missing. Dora and Nora soon discover that Tiffany is pregnant with Tristram&#x27;s baby, but he is unwilling to take on the responsibility. Once this bombshell has been dropped, it emerges that a body has been found and it is believed to be Tiffany&#x27;s.

Most of the novel consists of Dora&#x27;s memories. As well as providing the backstory of her natural father, Melchior Hazard, her legal father, Peregrine Hazard, and her guardian, Grandma Chance, Dora describes key events of her life. As Melchior becomes a renowned Shakespearean theatre actor in the 1920s, he refuses to acknowledge his daughters, who are publicly and legally believed to be the daughters of Peregrine instead. Dora is deeply hurt by Melchior&#x27;s rejection, contrasting the loving nature of Peregrine, who becomes the twins&#x27; father figure. She recalls her early theatre performances and her first sexual experience, in which she impersonates Nora and sleeps with her unknowing lover. Melchior marries Lady Atalanta Lynde, who Dora calls &quot;Lady A&quot;, and has two legitimate twin daughters, Saskia and Imogen. In the 1930s, he goes to Hollywood and produces a film version of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in which Dora and Nora play Peaseblossom and Mustardseed. The production ends in disaster as Melchior leaves his first wife to elope with the wife of the film&#x27;s producer, who plays the Titania to his Oberon in the film.

After the Second World War, during which Grandma Chance is killed in the Blitz, Dora and Nora attend the 21st birthday party of Saskia and Imogen. Melchior announces, to Saskia and Imogen&#x27;s fury, a third marriage to the best friend of Saskia, who is playing Cordelia in his King Lear. The announcement sparks a family argument in which Peregrine disappears, never to be seen again. The same night, Lady A falls down a flight of stairs and becomes confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life; she moves in with Dora and Nora. It is implied Saskia and Imogen may have pushed her down the stairs in their rage. Melchior has two more twins, Tristram and Gareth. Saskia, in an act of vengeance, enters into an incestual sexual relationship with her half-brother Tristram. Gareth, meanwhile, becomes a priest and vanishes.

Dora, Nora and Lady A attend Melchior&#x27;s 100th birthday party, where most of the novel&#x27;s expansive cast of characters are in attendance. Melchior acknowledges Dora and Nora are his children for the first time in their lives. Peregrine makes a dramatic entrance accompanied by Tiffany, revealing both are still alive, and Lady A reveals that Peregrine is the true father of Saskia and Imogen. While Melchior and Nora share a dance together, Dora has sex with her paternal uncle Peregrine upstairs. She asks Peregrine if he is her father too; Peregrine strongly denies it, but suggests Grandma Chance may have been Dora and Nora&#x27;s true mother.

The novel ends with Dora and Nora being presented with the twin babies of the missing son Gareth to look after – a gift from Peregrine. They realise that they &quot;can&#x27;t afford&quot; to die until they&#x27;ve seen their children grow up. The final line of the story is a message constantly conveyed throughout the novel: &quot;What a joy it is to dance and sing!&quot;

==Family tree==
==Major symbols==
There are many symbols used in the book which illustrate the themes. Carter frequently uses objects and places which take on meanings beyond the literal and begin to develop ideas about society, for example:

A grandfather clock represents their absent father, as it was given to them by their great Aunt (Ranulph&#x27;s Sister) and sent to their house as the last known address of Melchior. It is also a phallic symbol. It is flawed, as it doesn&#x27;t always strike the right time: &quot;it gives out the time in a falsetto ping, and always the wrong time&quot;. This links to their father, as he is also flawed, there being aspects of his personality which are less than admirable.

Song and dance represents their career. Like them it is light-hearted and full of energy.

London is their home city and their birthplace. There is a carnivalesque element to London as a city that is constantly changing.

The pairing of opposites is shown in sets of twins and in the family names &quot;Chance&quot; and &quot;Hazard&quot; (two words with the same meaning, perhaps emphasising the superficial nature of the differences between them).

==Themes==
Illegitimacy versus legitimacy: Nora and Dora are from &quot;the wrong side of the tracks&quot; and were &quot;born out of wedlock&quot;, their father is &quot;a pillar of the legit theatre&quot; and throughout the book the twins are constantly trying to become legitimate and be accepted. However, Carter questions the concept of legitimacy, and whether it is just a perception rather than reality: even the characters that are seen to be from the legitimate side do not always act in a respectable way, for example Saskia has an affair with Tristram, her half-brother. See Illegitimacy in fiction.

Carnivalesque: Carter uses the carnivalesque to illustrate some of her points about social boundaries, such as illegitimacy and highbrow/lowbrow. Important instances include the scene at the burning mansion in Chapter 2, where she describes the &quot;orgiastic&quot; element to the scene, using images of the &quot;flickering flames&quot; to emphasise this: the highbrow party and mansion is reduced to a ruined, passionate near-orgy by the fire and the breaking of social boundaries. This is similar to the final chapter when Dora and Perry have sex, as Nora says she wishes Dora would &quot;fuck the house down&quot;: as well as physically damaging the Hazard residence, Dora and Perry having sex almost brings down the divide between the highbrow and lowbrow sides of the family. Some of the imagery used in this scene echoes the imagery of the Chapter 2 scene, for example &quot;cover them all... with plaster dust and come and fire&quot;.

Incest: for example Saskia and Tristram are half brother and sister (although may be cousins), Nora loses her virginity to a pantomime goose when playing a gosling, Perry sleeps with Dora. Melchior and Peregrine also share partners (e.g. Daisy Duck, Lady A); Nora and Dora both sleep with the Blond Tenor. This could be seen as carnivalesque, as it inverts social hierarchies and boundaries. There is also the recurring idea of the actress playing Cordelia falling for the actor playing Lear in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; on stage.

Culture and class: the high culture of the theatre in the legitimate side of the family as opposed to the dance halls in which Nora and Dora perform.

Shakespeare: Shakespeare is used continually, the ideas of his plays are incorporates, comparisons made continually between characters of the book and of the play and the book itself is written in five chapters just as a Shakespearian play often had five acts. Melchior idolises his father, and also Shakespeare, worshipping earth from ground that Shakespeare once performed on more than his own daughters. The inclusion of Shakespeare references in Dora&#x27;s narrative highlights the idea of culture and class and of Shakespeare now being considered &quot;high art&quot;.

==Allusions and references to other works==
The term &quot;wise children&quot; occurs in two other works by Angela Carter: &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; and &quot;Nights at the Circus&quot;.

Throughout the novel, there are numerous references to the works and impact of William Shakespeare. At the beginning of the novel there are three quotations, two of which allude to Shakespeare: &quot;Brush Up on Your Shakespeare&quot;, a song title from the musical &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, and the quote &quot;How many times Shakespeare draws fathers and daughters, never mothers and daughters&quot; by Ellen Terry, an English stage actress. In an interview on the subject of &quot;Wise Children&quot;, Angela Carter stated &quot;[I wanted] to have a transparent prose that just ran, I wanted it to be very funny, and at the same time I wanted the complex ideas about paternity and the idea of Shakespeare as a cultural ideology.&quot;
There are also various other theatrical quotations, for example there is a &quot;paper moon&quot; motif, symbolising the spot-light, and indicating a sense of illusion. Also present are instances of magic realism, which is when a scene is exaggerated to an extent when the reader cannot possibly believe it, but does because of the realism of the rest of the novel. This is known as the willing suspension of disbelief.

==Stage adaptation==
A stage adaption based on the book, adapted and directed by Emma Rice premiered at The Old Vic in London on 8 October 2018. It was the debut production of a new theatre company, also named Wise Children, created and led by Rice.

<text>Kaiser-Jubiläum Jubelwalzer is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II in 1888 to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the accession to throne of his monarch, Emperor Franz Josef. The Emperor commissioned the waltz in order to celebrate the progress of Vienna and the prosperity of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.

The numerous celebrations planned were withheld out of respect of the death of the Emperor&#x27;s father-in-law, although Strauss was permitted to proceed with the dedication. He conducted the Strauss Orchestra in the first performance of the waltz at the Musikverein where brother Eduard Strauss was having his own benefit concert at the same day of the official royal celebrations.

<text>Jäneda () is a small village in northern Estonia. It is located in Lääne-Viru County (from autumn 2005) and is a part of Tapa municipality.

==History==
===Jäneda hill fort===
Jäneda hill fort was a hill fort used from the 10th to the 12th century. It consisted by a rampart reaching approximately , surrounding a triangular courtyard. There were two towers at the entrance at the southern end and, possibly, another tower at the northern end. The fort was surrounded by a moat.

===Jäneda manor===
Jäneda manor was founded as an estate before 1510. The estate has belonged to several different aristocratic families. The present building was built 1913-1915 in an eclectic Art Nouveau style with strong neo-Gothic influences. In 1922, the interiors were rebuilt after designs by architect Anton Lembit Soans. Estonian composer Urmas Sisask has furnished a planetarium at the top of the tower.

In the early 1900s the manor was owned by Countess, later Baroness, Moura (Maria Zakrevskaya Benckendorff) Budberg, who has been called the &quot;Mata Hari of Russia&quot; and who was close to Sir R. H. Bruce Lockhart, Russian writer Maxim Gorky and H. G. Wells.

The manor is now converted to a museum and conference center. Ugri.info seminar on Finno-Ugric languages and infosystems was held at the manor on either 3 December 2004 or March 12, 2004.

<doc id="1237887" wikidata="Q5159092" url="?curid=1237887" title="Concurrency (road)">
<text>A concurrency in a road network is an instance of one physical roadway bearing two or more different route numbers. When two roadways share the same right-of-way, it is sometimes called a common section or commons. Other terminology for a concurrency includes overlap, coincidence, duplex (two concurrent routes), triplex (three concurrent routes), multiplex (any number of concurrent routes), dual routing or triple routing.

Concurrent numbering can become very common in jurisdictions that allow it. Where multiple routes must pass between a single mountain crossing or over a bridge, or through a major city, it is often economically and practically advantageous for them all to be accommodated on a single physical roadway. In some jurisdictions, however, concurrent numbering is avoided by posting only one route number on highway signs; other route numbers disappear at the start of the concurrency and reappear when it ends. However, any route that becomes unsigned in the middle of the concurrency will still be signed on most maps and road atlases.

==Overview==
Most concurrencies are simply a combination of at least two route numbers on the same physical roadway. This is often practically advantageous as well as economically advantageous; it may be better for two route numbers to be combined into one along rivers or through mountain valleys. Some countries allow for concurrencies to occur, however, others specifically do not allow it to happen. In those nations which do permit concurrencies, it can become very common. In these countries, there are a variety of concurrences which can occur.

An example of this is the concurrency of Interstate 70 (I-70) and I-76 on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in western Pennsylvania. I-70 merges with the Pennsylvania Turnpike so the route number can ultimately continue east into Maryland; instead of having a second physical highway built to carry the route, it is combined with the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the I-76 designation. The longest Interstate Highway concurrency is I-80 and I-90 for on the Indiana Toll Road and Ohio Turnpike between Lake Station, Indiana and Elyria Township, Ohio.

There are at least two examples of eight-way concurrencies. The first example is in Indianapolis, between exits 46 and 47 of the I-465 beltway, where the highway is concurrent with I-69, U.S. Highway 31 (US 31), US 36, US 40, US 52, US 421, and State Road 67. The second example is in downtown Athens, Georgia, between exits 4 and 8 of SR 10 Loop, where the highway is concurrent with US 29, US 78, US 129, US 441, SR 8, SR 15, and the unsigned SR 422.

==Regional examples==

===North America===

In the United States, concurrencies are simply marked by placing signs for both routes on the same or adjacent posts. The federal &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; prescribes that when mounting these adjacent signs together that the numbers will be arranged vertically or horizontally in order of precedence. The order to be used is Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, state highways, and finally county roads, and within each class by increasing numerical value.

Several states do not officially have any concurrencies, instead officially ending routes on each side of one. There are several circumstances where unusual concurrencies exist along state borders. One example occurs along the Oklahoma–Arkansas state line. At the northern end of this border Oklahoma State Highway 20 runs concurrently with Arkansas Highway 43 and the two highways run north–south along the boundary.
Concurrencies are also found in Canada. British Columbia Highway 5 continues east for concurrently with Highway 1 and Highway 97, through Kamloops. This stretch of road, which carries Highway 97 south and Highway 5 north on the same roadway (and vice versa), is the only wrong-way concurrency in British Columbia. Concurrencies are also very common in Quebec. Most notably, the Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge features a concurrency with three Autoroutes: A-10, A-15, and A-20. Another example is A-55, which runs concurrently with A-10, A-20, and A-40, all of which are major highways.

In Ontario, the Queen Elizabeth Way and Highway 403 run concurrently between Burlington and Oakville, forming the province&#x27;s only concurrency between two 400-series highways. The concurrency was not in the original plan which intended for both the QEW and Highway 403 to run parallel to each other, as the Hamilton–Brantford and Mississauga sections of Highway 403 were initially planned to be linked up along a corridor (later planned to be tolled) now occupied by Highway 407. To avoid forcing drivers to pay tolls to use a section of a continuous Highway 403, the new link was designated as a western extension of the tolled Highway 407, with the Mississauga section of Highway 403 planned to be renumbered as Highway 410. The renumbering to 410 never came to pass, and consequently Highway 403 was signed concurrently along the Queen Elizabeth Way in 2002, remedying the discontinuity. Nonetheless, many surface street signs referring to that section of freeway with the QEW/Highway 403 concurrency still only use the highway&#x27;s original designation of QEW, although the MTO has updated route markers on the QEW to reflect the concurrency.

At the national level, the Trans-Canada Highway, which does not bear a uniform number in the eastern provinces, follows various provincial highways. In the Atlantic Provinces the main designated TCH route either follows a single numbered route across each province (an exception being the switching of the designation between Nova Scotia Highways 104 and 105), or has branches that are signed exclusively as TCH routes. In Ontario and Quebec, The TCH follows a series of provincial highways, and also has branches that follow sections of others that have concurrencies with it, signed with TCH shields alongside the provincial number.

===Europe===

In the United Kingdom, routes do not run concurrently with others. Where this would normally occur, the roadway takes the number of only one of the routes (usually, but not always, the most important route), while the other routes are considered to have a gap and are signed in brackets (the equivalent of &quot;to&quot; signs in North America). An example is the meeting of the M60 and the M62 northwest of Manchester: the motorways coincide for the between junctions 12 and 18 but the motorway between those points is only designated as the M60 (although in this case the same junction numbers would also apply to the M62). European route numbers as designated by UNECE may have concurrencies (for instance E15 and E30 around Greater London), but since the E-route numbers are unsigned and unused in the UK, the existence of these concurrencies is purely theoretical.

In Sweden and Denmark, the most important highways use only the European route numbers that have cardinal directions. In Sweden the European route E6 and E20 run concurrently for . In Denmark the E47 and E55 run concurrently for . There are more shorter concurrencies. There are two stretches in Sweden and Denmark where three European routes run concurrently; these are E6, E20 and E22 in Sweden, and E20, E47, and E55 in Denmark. Along all these concurrencies, all route numbers are posted with signs.

In the Czech Republic, the European route numbers are only additional, and they are always concurrent with the state route numbering, usually highways or first-class roads. In the state numbering system, concurrences exist only in first-class and second-class roads; third class roads do not have them. The local term for such concurrences is (from the French word ). In the road register, one of the roads is considered the main (&quot;source&quot;) road and the others as the &quot;péaging&quot; (guest) roads. The official road map enables a maximum of five concurrent routes of the intrastate numbering system. Cycling routes and hiking routes are often concurrent.

===The Middle East===

In Israel, two freeways, the Trans-Israel Highway (Highway 6), and Highway 1 run concurrently just east of Ben Shemen Interchange. The concurrency is officially designated &quot;Daniel Interchange&quot;, providing half of the possible interchange directions. It is a segment consisting of eight lanes providing high-speed access between the two highways. Access from Highway 1 west to Highway 6 south and Highway 6 north to Highway 1 east is provided via Route 431, while access between Highway 1 east to Highway 6 north and Highway 6 south to Highway 1 west are provided at Ben Shemen Interchange. The other movements are provided through the concurrency.

==Wrong-way concurrencies==

Since highways in the United States and Canada are usually signed with assigned cardinal directions based on their primary orientation, it is possible for a stretch of roadway shared between two highways to be signed with conflicting, even opposite, cardinal directions in a wrong-way concurrency. For example, near Wytheville, Virginia, there is a concurrency between Interstate 77 (which runs primarily north–south, as it is signed) and Interstate 81 (which runs primarily northeast–southwest, but is also signed north–south). A vehicle might simultaneously be on I-77 northbound and I-81 southbound, while actually traveling due westbound. An unusual example of a three-directional concurrency occurs southeast of Rhinelander, Wisconsin, where US 8 westbound (the actual compass direction) converges with southbound Wisconsin Highway 17 and northbound Wisconsin Highway 47, and vice-versa.

==Effect on exit numbers==
Often when two routes with exit numbers overlap, one of the routes has its exit numbers dominate over the other and can sometimes result in having two exits of the same number, albeit far from each other along the same highway. An example of this is from the concurrency of I-94 and US 127 near Jackson, Michigan. The concurrent section of freeway has an exit with M-106, which is numbered exit 139 using I-94&#x27;s mileage-based numbers. US 127 also has another exit 139 with the southern end of the US 127 business loop in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. (US 127&#x27;s mile markers in Michigan reflect the cumulative distance north of the Ohio state line; the numbers resume north of the I-94 overlap and reflect the distance accumulated on that concurrency.)

However, there are also instances where the dominant exit number range is far more than the secondary route&#x27;s highest exit number, for example the concurrency of I-75 and I-85 in Atlanta, Georgia—where I-75 is dominant—the exit numbers range from 242 to 251, while I-85&#x27;s highest independent mile marker in Georgia is 179.

==Consolidation plans==

Some brief concurrencies in the past have been eliminated by reassigning the designations along the roadways. This can involve scaling back the terminus of one designation to the end of a concurrent section. At the same time, there could be an extension of another highway designation that is used to replace the newly shortened designation with another one.

Between states, US 27 in Michigan previously ran concurrently with I-69 from the Michigan–Indiana state line to the Lansing, Michigan, area. From there it turned northwards to its terminus at Grayling. In 1999, the Michigan and Indiana departments of transportation petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials for permission to truncate US 27 at Fort Wayne, Indiana. In 2002, Michigan removed the US 27 designation from I-69 and extended the US 127 designation from Lansing to Grayling. MDOT&#x27;s stated reason for the modification was to &quot;reduce confusion along the US 27/US 127 corridor&quot;. After US 27&#x27;s signage was removed, the highway north of the Lansing area was renumbered US 127, and the US 27 designation was removed from I-69.

Some consolidation schemes involve the use of incorporating two single-digit numbers onto one marker, as along the US 1/9 concurrency in northern New Jersey. In the mid-20th century, California had numerous concurrencies, but the California Legislature removed most of them in a comprehensive reform of highway numbering in 1964.

<text>The Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Toulouse (; &quot;Toulouse National Institute for Applied Sciences&quot;) or INSA Toulouse is a French &quot;grande école&quot; of engineering, under the authority of the French Ministry of Education and Research. Situated in Toulouse, this school is one of the 6 state engineering institutes that compose the INSA network.

The school was founded in 1963 to train highly qualified engineers, foster continuous training and scientific research. It is a member of the University of Toulouse since 2007. Even though INSA Toulouse is highly selective (its offer rate was 10.1% in 2020, for an Applications/accepted ratio of 1.48%), diversity and international openness are two values to which INSA Toulouse gives priority: the school is composed of 38% female students, 32% of students are scholarship holders, and 23% of students are international.

The INSA Toulouse is located along the Canal du Midi on the university campus that includes Université Paul Sabatier III, Supaero and ENAC. Along with those schools, INSA Toulouse is a founding member of the Federal University of Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées (), the association of universities and higher education institutions (ComUE), which is reconstituting the collective Université de Toulouse. As a member, INSA Toulouse coordinates the training offers and the research and transfer strategies of 31 public university and research establishments within the Occitanie region, has its own budgetary allocation, and can issue diplomas. Among others, this membership includes all large campuses in Toulouse: Capitole University, Jean Jaurès, Paul Sabatier University, TBS Education, Sciences Po Toulouse, ISAE-SUPAERO, as well as the 7 grandes écoles of the National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse. Within the Université de Toulouse, INSA Toulouse also awards double-diplomas in engineering and business administration with TBS Education, Toulouse School of Management, and joint training with IMT Mines Albi, ISAE-SUPEARO and INP-ENSEEIHT.

== Academics ==
INSA Toulouse is one of several engineering schools within the &quot;Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (INSA)&quot; network under the supervision of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance (France) (. All INSA engineering schools are &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

Although INSA engineering schools are selective and can be more expensive than public universities in France, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; typically have much smaller class sizes and student bodies, and many of their programs are taught in English. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;. Many of the top ranked schools in Europe are members of the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; &quot;(CGE)&quot;, as are INSA engineering schools. Degrees from INSA are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France) ().

=== Diplômes d&#x27;Ingénieur ===

==== New European program ====

In 2002, INSA Toulouse decided to reform its structure to adapt to the European 3/5/8 system. The Engineering degree is obtained after five years of studies. The new programme, better adapted to the social and economic environment, includes a one-year common core, two years of pre-specialization and two years of specialization.
The selection level at INSA Toulouse has greatly increased since the European reform, and it now makes the INSA Toulouse one of the most elitist universities in France, with an average grade at the Baccalauréat exam (high school achievement exam) of 17.05/20, equivalent to the grades 1.0 or A in Anglo-Saxon countries.

== INSA culture ==

The campus of INSA Toulouse is very active and flourishes with cultural activities. L’Amicale des Elèves and its over 70 students clubs offer a wide range of activities that will suit all tastes: outdoors and indoors sports, arts, events, social actions, leisure and so on.`There is also a student hall and a party hall in where insaïens (INSA students) can organize events and the school&#x27;s newspaper informs student about the campus life. The web radio, “Radio Insa Toulouse”, created in 2007, aims to facilitate communication between students and the staff (administration, teachers, researchers...). Every year, an annual race around the campus called “Les 100 tours de l’INSA”, gather every student association during two days in a festive atmosphere.

In September 2000 was created Les Enfoiros, a student association, which aims to help Les Restos du Coeur (a French nationwide association that gives free meals to impoverished persons) collecting money through various concerts and other events all along the year. Since then, Les Enfoiros have raised around €250,000 for this association.

Moreover, the AIIT, the INSA Toulouse students association, is very active as well and aims to:
* Establish and maintain alumni contact
* Advise students and graduates in their professional life
* Develop cooperation between the Board and INSA&#x27;s professors
* Promote the school and its values

The Toulouse Ingénierie Multidisciplinaire (TIM) (partnership with the Paul Sabatier University) is a state of the art student association whose objective is to conceive and build very low consumption prototype cars. Founded in 1995, the association takes part every year ever since in the Shell Eco Marathon, a European competition whose winner is the vehicle able to run the longest distance with one litre of gasoline equivalent. As a matter of facts, the TIM is one of the best teams in the world, breaking several world records throughout its history, such as: ICE Prototypes category (Internal Combustion Engine), ethanol fuel: 3350 km/L in 2009, on the Rokingham track (still valid in 2017)

==Rankings and acceptance rates ==

Rankings (national and international):
* 2nd place according to L&#x27;Express (06/01/2010), among 5-year schools. In the French education system, high school graduates go to &quot;Prepa&quot; courses for 2 years, then compete for engineering schools where they spend 3 more years; whereas other schools like INSA include the &quot;Prepa&quot; as part of their 5-year cursus. Ranking differ between these 2 categories.
* 2nd place for academic excellence (among 77) according to L&#x27;Etudiant (2021), among 5-year schools in France. 3rd place (among 77) overall.
* Shanghai Ranking by Subject 2021: despite its small size (500 students graduate each year overall, among which 48 in mathematics and 96 in biology, process engineering and environnement) INSA Toulouse is in the world top 200 in mathematics, and in the world top 300 in biotechnologies.

<text>Ernst Friedrich August Rietschel (15 December 180421 January 1861) was a German sculptor.

==Life==
Rietschel was born in Pulsnitz in Saxony the third child of Friedrich Ehrgott Rietschel and his wife Caroline.

From the age of 20 he became an art student at Dresden, and from 1826 was a pupil of Rauch in Berlin. He there gained an art studentship, and studied in Rome in 1827–28. After returning to Saxony, he soon brought himself into notice by a colossal statue of Frederick Augustus, King of Saxony; was elected a member of the academy of Dresden, and became one of the chief sculptors of his country. In 1832 he was elected to the Dresden professorship of sculpture, and had many foreign orders of merit conferred on him by the governments of different countries.

He died in Dresden in 1861 aged 56. He is buried in the Trinitatisfriedhof, north-east of the city centre.

==Family==

He married three times.

Firstly in 1832 to Albertine Trautscholdt. In 1836 he married Charlotte Carus daughter of Carl Gustav Carus. Finally in 1841 he married Marie Hand (1819–1847).

From the third marriage he had a son .

==Style and sculptures==
Rietschel&#x27;s style was very varied; he produced works imbued with much religious feeling, and to some extent he occupied the same place as a sculptor that Overbeck did in painting. Other important works by him were purely classical in style. He was specially famed for his portrait figures of eminent men, treated with much idealism and dramatic vigour; among the latter class his chief works were colossal statues of Goethe and Schiller for the a monument in Weimar, of Weber for Dresden and of Lessing for Braunschweig cast by Georg Howaldt. He also designed the Luther Monument in Worms, Germany, and created two of its many statues, but died before it was completed.

The principal among Rietschel&#x27;s religious pieces of sculpture are the well-known Christ-Angel, and a life-sized Piet, executed for the king of Prussia. He also worked a great deal &quot;in rilievo&quot;, and produced many graceful pieces, especially a fine series of bas-reliefs representing &quot;Night and Morning&quot; and &quot;Noon and Twilight&quot;.

<text>.no is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Norway. Norid, the domain name registry, is based in Trondheim and is owned by the state-owned Uninett and operates under supervision of the Norwegian Communications Authority. As of December 24, 2022 there were 843,749 registered .no domains. Organizations with a presence in Norway and registration at the Brønnøysund Register Centre are limited to 100 domains each. Individuals residing in Norway may register in the second-level domain and, as of June 17, 2014, directly under . Other second-level domains exist for organizations of certain types, such as municipalities and schools. The strict regulations have resulted in near-absence of cybersquatting and warehousing.

Management of a ccTLD was awarded to Pål Spilling in 1983, but was taken over by Uninett four years later. The 1000th domain was registered in 1995. Norid is the result of several re-organizations within Uninett, in 2003 becoming a separate limited company. Norway has also been allocated two other ccTLDs, for Svalbard and Jan Mayen and for Bouvet Island; neither are open to registration. Originally only a single domain was permitted per organization, and this was manually checked by Norid to ensure compliance with trademark ownership. The regulations were liberalized in 2001, when the process was automated and a retrospective dispute resolution scheme was introduced. This resulted in a boom of registrations, with the accumulated registrations exceeding 100,000 in the course of the year. Domain names may consist of the twenty-six basic Latin letters, digits and the hyphen, and beginning in 2004 three Norwegian language letters and twenty Sami language letters have been permitted. All-numeric domains were introduced in 2007 and in 2011.

==History==
The domain name registry responsibility for was in 1987 awarded to Pål Spilling at the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration&#x27;s Research Institute. The actual registration work was carried out by Jens Thomassen. The first registered domains were (the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration) and (the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo). Initially the workload of domain registration was light, but after a few years the workload had become unmanageable as a side project for an individual. Policy-makers also indicated a need for the domain registration to be managed by a non-commercial organization. The responsibility was therefore transferred to the publicly owned Uninett, a supplier of information and communications technology to Norwegian public universities, colleges and research institutions on 17 March 1987. The oldest archived zone file dates from 1989 and includes 19 domains. In 1991 and 1992, all state university colleges were connected to the Internet and issued domain names, causing a boom of registrations. The 1000th domain was registered in 1995.

Uninett was at first administrated as a division of SINTEF, but was in 1993 transformed to a limited company owned by the Ministry of Education and Research. Norid was established as a division within Uninett in 1996, and issued the responsibility of managing the domain. On 21 August 1997, Norid was given the responsibility for the newly created and domains. Uninett FAS was established the following year as a subsidiary of Uninett to manage the technical network and service infrastructure, including operation of the network systems for the universities and colleges. Thus Norid also became part of the Uninett FAS portfolio. Two organizations were established in 1998: the Domain Resolution Body, to resolve domain disputes, and Norpol, a political advisory board. Domain name registrars were introduced in 1999 to handle aspects that could be provided by a third party. Uninett Norid was in 2003 registered as a limited company owned by Uninett, to secure the management of the domains within an independent organization.

Until 2001, each organization could only register a single domain and had to document its right to the name, either directly connected to the company&#x27;s name or a trademark; this information was verified by Norid. The rules were liberalized on 19 February 2001. A new cap was set at fifteen domains per organization and Norid no longer made an evaluation of the right to the name; if the domain was not registered it would be awarded. This resulted in a large increase in the number of domains, and the 100,000th domain was registered that same year. Originally only the basic Latin letters were permitted, but from 9 February 2004 an additional twenty-three characters from the Norwegian and Sami languages were permitted, along with the number of permitted domains per organization increasing to twenty. From 13 June 2007, all-numerical domains names were allowed. The 500,000th domain was registered in January 2011. The second-level domain was permitted from June 2011, which gave individuals the possibility to register. On 30 November 2011, organizations were permitted to register 100 domains.

On 17 June 2014 Norid opened up for private citizen registrations of .no domains.
On 9 December 2014 Norid enabled support for DNSSEC.

==Management==
Management of lies with the Trondheim-based Norid, which is also the domain name registry for the unused and . Norid is a limited company owned by Uninett, which is again owned by the Ministry of Education and Research. The legal right to manage the domains is two-fold, based both on an agreement with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and regulations under the &quot;Electronic Communications Act&quot; which is supervised by the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority. The policy for use of is regulated by the &quot;Regulation Concerning Domain Names Under Norwegian Country Code Top-level Domains&quot;, also known as the &quot;Domain Regulation&quot;. This regulation also regulates Norway&#x27;s other two ccTLDs, and , for Bouvetøya and Svalbard and Jan Mayen, respectively; neither are open to registration.

Registration takes place through a third party, a domain name registrar. The relationship between Norid, the registrar and the holder is regulated through civil legal agreements. The registrar registers the domain on behalf of the holder, and the holder then holds the right to the domain name until it is terminated, unless a dispute resolution dictates otherwise. Norid charges registrars 60 Norwegian krone (NOK) per registration and change of holder, as well as NOK 60 in an annual fee per domain. Registrars must meet criteria regarding technical and administrative resources, must pay an annual fee of NOK 5,000 and a deposit of minimum NOK 10,000, depending on activity level. Registrars must also undertake a minimum activity of either administrating or registering forty domains per year.

Upon registering a domain, the user signs a declaration that they are not infringing on the rights of other parties and that the user will assume full responsibility for any consequences of use of the domain name. The registration process at Norid is fully automated and does not include any steps to ensure that the user has the rights to the name. Disputes regarding the right to a domain name are handled retrospectively, either through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee or court proceedings. Issues which could give the right to take over a domain name include infringements of the &quot;Trademarks Act&quot; and the &quot;Marketing Control Act&quot;. Trademark holders will also be awarded the domain if the registration was solely made to sell the domain to the trademark owner. The dispute bodies will also consider the risk of confusion, based on the domain name itself rather than the content of the site. For one domain, , the issue of ownership was subject to a Supreme Court case.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Norwegian Prosecuting Authority may seize domain registrations under specifications of the General Civil Penal Code, as domains are legally regarded as assets with financial value. As of 27 September 2012 there were 552,255 registered domains. -domains had a 90.6-percent renewal rate in 2009, which is significantly higher than more liberal domains, such as 71 percent of domains. Cybersquatting and warehousing has not been a problem with -domains because of the strict registration requirements. Norpol is an advisory body with thirteen members appointed to discuss and comment on the domain policy. It consists of members from several government authorities, the Internet industry and other stakeholders.

==Policy==
Only organizations with a local presence in Norway and with registration in the Brønnøysund Register Centre are allowed to register domains under . Specifically, they must be registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities—and thus have an organization number, have a postal address in Norway and must be able to actually document activity in Norway upon request from Norid. All qualified users may register up to 100 domains directly under and five additional domains under each second-level domain.

The domain is available for registration by individuals. To register, an individual must be registered in the National Registry and have been issued a national identity number, must be resident in Norway and be at least 18 years old. Moving abroad will not result in the domain being deleted, but the person cannot register any more domains while living abroad. There is a limit of five registered domains per person.

Non-residents can utilize &#x27;trustee services&#x27; based in Norway for .no domain registration, though these trustees technically become the domain&#x27;s legal owners.

Since June 2014, individuals are not restricted to the domain anymore, they can register up to five domains directly under , in addition to the five domains and five geography-oriented domains (e.g. under , see below).

Domain names must consist of 2 to 63 characters. Permitted characters are the ISO basic Latin alphabet (a through z), digits (0 through 9), the hyphen (-), the three Norwegian language letters æ, ø and å, and twenty special Sami languages letters (á·à·ä·č·ç·đ·é·è·ê·ŋ·ń·ñ·ó·ò·ô·ö·š·ŧ·ü·ž). The domain name must start and end in a digit or a letter. A large number of domains cannot be registered, including all that are the basis for second-level domains, and a specified series of geographical names, including names of settlements and islands, which may become second-level domains in the future. Eight specific Internet terms may not be registered (, , , , , , and ). Additional general-category potential future second-level domains have also been blocked, such as and .

==Second-level domains==
There are three types of second-level domains: geography-oriented, category-oriented and those managed by other agencies than Norid. There are reserved geographic second-level domains for all counties (such as for Oslo and for Nord-Trøndelag), all urban areas with at least 5,000 inhabitants (such as for Orkanger) and all municipalities (such as for Bergen Municipality and both and for Inderøy Municipality). In addition, has been reserved for Svalbard and for Jan Mayen. Users are asked to not register with a geographic second-level domain unless they have a local presence in the area. The name under a geographic second-level domain (such as ) may only be carried out by the local government of the area, such as the municipality, the county municipality and the Governor of Svalbard.

The category second-level domains require the user to meet specific characteristics; for instance, only upper secondary schools may register under . Most of the second-level domains are managed by Norid, although five domains are managed by three other government agencies, the Government Administration Services for central parts of the government, the Norwegian Armed Forces for their own sites and the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities for municipalities and county municipalities.

<text>The pith helmet, also known as the safari helmet, salacot, sola topee, sun helmet, topee, and topi is a lightweight cloth-covered helmet made of sholapith. The pith helmet originates from the Spanish military adaptation of the native salakot headgear of the Philippines.

It was often worn by European travellers and explorers in the varying climates found in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the tropics, but it was also used in many other contexts. It was routinely issued to colonial military personnel serving in warmer climates from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century. The headdress remains in use in several military services in the 21st century.

==Definition==
Typically, a pith helmet derives from either the sola or &quot;pith&quot; plant, &quot;Aeschynomene aspera&quot;, an Indian swamp plant, or from &quot;Aeschynomene paludosa&quot;. In the narrowest definition, a pith helmet is a type of sun hat made from the wood of the pith plant. However, pith helmet may more broadly refer to this style of helmet when made from any number of lightweight sun-shading materials, such as cork wood, rattan or fiber. It was designed to shade the wearer&#x27;s head and face from the sun.

==History==
===Origin===
The origin of the pith helmet is the traditional Filipino headgear known as the salakot (Spanish salacot, a term still also used for pith helmets). They are usually dome-shaped or cone-shaped and can range in size from having very wide brims to being almost helmet-like. The tip of the crown commonly has a spiked or knobbed finial made of metal or wood. It is held in place by an inner headband and a chin strap. These were originally made from various lightweight materials like woven bamboo, rattan, and calabash; sometimes inlaid with precious metals, coated with water-proof resin, or covered in cloth.

Salacots were used by native Filipino auxiliaries in the Spanish colonial military as protection against the sun and rain during campaigns. They were adopted fully by both native and Spanish troops in the Philippines by the early 18th century. The military versions were commonly cloth-covered and gradually took on the shape of the Spanish cabasset or morion.

===19th century===

The salacot design was later adopted by the French colonial troops in Mainland Southeast Asia in the 19th century (who called it the salacco or salacot, a term also later applied to the native Vietnamese cone-shaped or disk-like &quot;nón lá&quot;) due to its effectiveness in protecting from damp and humid weather. French marines also introduced the early version of the salacot to the French West Indies, where it became the &quot;salako,&quot; a cloth-covered headgear still mostly identical to the Filipino &quot;salakot&quot; in shape. British and Dutch troops, and other colonial powers in nearby regions followed suit and the &quot;salacot&quot; became a common headgear for colonial forces in the mid-19th century.

While this form of headgear was particularly associated with the British Empire, all European colonial powers used versions of it during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The French tropical helmet was first authorised for colonial troops in 1878. The Dutch wore the helmet during the entire Aceh War (1873–1904), and the United States Army adopted it during the 1880s for use by soldiers serving in the intensely sunny climate of the Southwestern United States. It was also worn by the North-West Mounted Police in policing North-West Canada, 1873 through 1874 to the North-West Rebellion and even before the stetson in the Yukon Gold Rush of 1898.

European officers commanding locally recruited indigenous troops, as well as civilian officials in African and Asian colonial territories, used the pith helmet. Troops serving in the tropics usually wore pith helmets. However, on active service, they sometimes used alternatives such as the wide-brimmed slouch hat worn by US troops in the Philippines and by British Empire forces in the later stages of the Boer War.

====Within the British Empire====
The salacot was most widely adopted by the British Empire in British India, who originally called them &quot;planters&#x27; hats&quot;. They began experimenting with derivative designs for a lightweight hat for troops serving in tropical regions. This led to a succession of designs, ultimately resulting in the &quot;Colonial pattern&quot; pith helmet and later designs like the Wolseley pattern.

Originally made of pith with small peaks or &quot;bills&quot; at the front and back, the British Army version of the helmet was covered by white cloth, often with a cloth band (or &quot;puggaree&quot;) around it, and small holes for ventilation. The definitive military version, known as the Foreign Service Helmet, was introduced in June 1877 after trials in India; it had a metal plate carrying the regimental insignia on the front and could be decorated with a brass spike or ball-shaped finial. Depending on the occasion, the chinstrap would be either leather or brass chain. The base material later became the more durable cork, although still covered with cloth and frequently referred to as a &quot;pith&quot; helmet.

During the Anglo-Zulu War, British troops dyed their white pith helmets with tea, mud, or other makeshift means of camouflage. Subsequently, khaki-coloured pith helmets became standard issue for active tropical service.

=====Colonial pattern=====
Sun helmets made of pith first appeared in India during the First and Second Anglo-Sikh wars of the 1840s. Adopted more widely during the Indian Rebellion of 1857–59, they were generally worn by British troops serving in the Anglo-Ashanti War of 1873, the Anglo-Zulu War of 1878–79, and subsequent campaigns in India, Burma, Egypt, and South Africa. This distinctively shaped early headwear became known as the Colonial pattern helmet.

The British Colonial pattern pith helmet, in turn, influenced the designs of other European pith helmets, including the Spanish and Filipino designs, by the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century.

=====Wolseley pattern=====

The Wolseley pattern helmet is a distinctive British design developed and popularised in the late 19th and early 20th century. It was the official designation for the universal sun helmet worn by the British Army from 1899 to 1948 and described in the 1900 Dress Regulations as &quot;the Wolseley pattern cork helmet&quot;. It is named after Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Wolseley. With its swept-back brim, it provided greater protection from the sun than the old Colonial pattern helmet. Its use was soon widespread among British personnel serving overseas and some Canadian units. It continues to be used by the Royal Marines, both in full dress as worn by the Royal Marines Band Service and in number 1 dress (&quot;blues&quot;) on certain ceremonial occasions.

=====Home Service helmet=====
At the same time, a similar helmet (of dark-blue cloth over the cork and incorporating a bronze spike) had been proposed for use in non-tropical areas. The British Army formally adopted this headgear, which they called the Home Service helmet, in 1878 (leading to the retirement of the shako). Most British line infantry (except fusilier and Scottish regiments) wore the helmet until 1902, when the khaki Service Dress was introduced. It was also worn by engineers, artillery (with a ball rather than a spike), and various administrative and other corps (again with a ball rather than a spike). The cloth of the helmet was generally dark blue, but a green version was worn by light infantry regiments and grey by several volunteer units. With the general adoption of khaki for field dress in 1903, the helmet became purely a full dress item, being worn as such until 1914.
 It returned to use by regimental bands and officers attending levees in the inter-war period and is worn by regimental bands of British Army line infantry regiments to the present day.
The design of the Home Service helmet closely resembles the traditional custodian helmet worn since 1869 by several police forces in England and Wales. Black helmets of a similar shape were also part of the uniform of the Australian Victoria Police during the late 19th century. The US Army also wore blue cloth helmets of the same pattern as the British model from 1881 to 1901 as part of their full-dress uniform. The version worn by cavalry and mounted artillery included plumes and cords in their respective service branches&#x27; colours (yellow or red).

===20th century===
====Military use====
Before the First World War, the Royal Navy and other navies had sometimes provided pith helmets for landing parties in tropical regions. Pith helmets were widely worn during the First World War by British, Belgian, French, Austrian-Hungarian, and German troops fighting in the Middle East and Africa. A white tropical helmet was issued to personnel of the French Navy serving in the Red Sea, Far Eastern waters, and the Pacific between 1922 and the 1940s.

During the 1930s, the locally recruited forces maintained in the Philippines (consisting of the army and a gendarmerie) used sun helmets mostly made out of compressed coconut fiber called &quot;Guinit&quot;. The Axis Second Philippine Republic&#x27;s military, known as the Bureau of Constabulary, and guerrilla groups in the Philippines also wore this headdress.
Before the Second World War, Royal Navy officers wore the Wolseley helmet when in white (tropical) uniform; the helmet was plain white, with a narrow navy-blue edging to the top of the puggaree. Pith-styled helmets were used as late as the Second World War by Japanese, European and American military personnel in hot climates. Included in this category are the sun helmets worn in Ethiopia and North Africa by Italian troops, the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, Union Defence Force, and Nazi Germany&#x27;s Afrika Korps, as well as similar helmets used to a more limited extent by U.S. and Japanese forces in the Pacific Theater.

In the British Army, a khaki version was frequently worn, ornamented with a regimental cap badge or flash. The full-dress white helmet varied from regiment to regiment: several regiments had distinctive puggarees or hackles. On ceremonial occasions, the helmet was topped with a spike (for infantry and cavalry regiments, for the Army Ordnance Corps and the Royal Engineers) or a ball (for the Royal Artillery and other corps); and general officers staff officers and certain departmental officers, when in full dress, wore plumes on their helmets, similar to those worn on their full-dress cocked hats.

George Orwell, commenting on the unproblematical use of slouch hats by Second World War British troops rather than the &quot;essentially superstitious&quot; use of pith helmets, wrote, &quot;When I was in Burma I was assured that the Indian sun, even at its coolest [even in the early morning, and the sunless rainy season], had a peculiar deadliness which could only be warded off by wearing a helmet of cork or pith. &#x27;Natives&#x27;, their skulls being thicker, had no need of these helmets, but for a European, even a double felt hat was not a reliable protection.&quot; The British Army formally abolished the tropical helmet (other than for ceremonial purposes) in 1948.

The Ethiopian Imperial Guard retained pith helmets as a distinctive part of their uniform until the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie I in 1974. Imperial Guard units serving in the Korean War often wore these helmets when not in combat.

American naval officers could wear a pith helmet with the tropical khaki uniform. Most often, the pith helmet was worn by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Civil Engineer Corps.

====Public use====

Through the first half of the 20th century, the Wolseley pattern helmet was routinely worn with civil uniform by British colonial, diplomatic, and consular officials serving in &#x27;hot climates&#x27;. It was worn with a gilt badge of the royal arms at the front. When worn by governors and governors-general, the helmet was topped by a 10-inch red and white swan-feather plume. British diplomats in tropical postings, governors-general, governors and colonial officials continued to wear the traditional white helmets as part of their ceremonial white uniforms until Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) officials ceased to wear such dress in the late 20th century as an economy measure. The ceremonies marking the end of British rule in Hong Kong in 1997 featured the Royal Hong Kong Police (RHKP) aide-de-camp to the Governor in a white Wolseley pith helmet with black and white feathers. It was the last occasion on which this style of headdress appeared as a symbol of the Empire.

====Civilian use====
Due to its popularity, the pith helmet became common civilian headgear for Westerners in the tropics and sub-tropics from the mid-19th century. The civilian pith helmet usually had the same dimensions and outline as its contemporary military counterpart but without decorative extras such as badges. It was worn by men and women, old and young, on formal and casual occasions, until the 1940s. Both white and khaki versions were used. It was often worn together with civilian versions of khaki drill and bush jackets.

At the turn of the 20th century, there was a widespread assumption that wearing this form of head-dress was necessary for people of European origin to avoid sunstroke in the tropics. By contrast, indigenous peoples were assumed to have acquired relative immunity. Modern medical opinion holds that some form of wide-brimmed but light headwear (such as a Panama hat, etc.) is highly advisable in strong sunlight for people of all ethnicities to avoid skin cancers and overheating.

Pith helmets began to decline in popularity in the mid-1950s. For example, they had become relatively uncommon in Francophone African colonies by 1955, despite their former conspicuous popularity among European visitors and expatriates there during the previous decade.

==Modern uses==
===Military and public uses===
====Netherlands====
A dark blue pith helmet, similar to the British Home Service helmet, is worn with the ceremonial uniforms of the &quot;Garderegiment Fuseliers Prinses Irene&quot; and the Netherlands Marine Corps.

====United States====
Throughout the Second World War, the U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, and the U. S. Army developed a cheaper, similar-looking alternative to the pith helmet, called the American fiber helmet, which was made from pressed fiber. Some of the helmets were printed with a camouflage pattern. The two main producers of the US military fiber pressed pith helmet were the International Hat Company and Hawley Products Company. Both companies had originally designed and manufactured several civilian models made from pressed fiber with a foil lining in the 1930s, aimed to be used by laborers who worked in the hot sun, from farms to road construction to other manual labor.

The U.S. Marine Corps pith helmet (officially &quot;Helmet, sun, rigid, fiber&quot;) has been used as a form of identification by rifle range cadres; similarly, rifle range instructors and drill instructors wear the campaign hat. The U.S. Navy also authorized a plastic khaki sun helmet for wear by officers in tropical regions during the mid-20th century. It was decorated with a full-size officer&#x27;s hat crest on the front.

White or light blue helmets of plastic material but traditional design are official optional uniform items worn today by letter carriers of the U.S. Postal Service to protect against sun and rain.

In 19th century Hawaii, King Kalākaua&#x27;s Royal Guard adopted the sun helmet as part of their uniform in 1885. The Hawaii Air National Guard honors their legacy today with a special ceremonial unit that wears the 1885 uniform and sun helmet in support of the Governor at official state and other ceremonial functions.

The Royal Guard&#x27;s historical uniform and helmet are used to represent the Hawaii National Guard at the National Guard Heritage Room at Joint Base Fort Myer-Henderson Hall in Virginia.

====Vietnam====

After the Second World War, the communist Viet Minh in French Indochina, and later the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam of the North, based their helmet design, called , on the French pith helmet. Today it is still widely worn by civilians in Vietnam (mainly in the North, but its use declined sharply in 2007 when the motorbike helmet became mandatory for motorbike riders). In design, the Vietnamese model was similar to the pre-Second World War civilian type but covered in jungle green cloth or other colors depending on the army&#x27;s branches (for example, blue for the Air Force), usually with a metal insignia at the front. It is considered a symbol of the Vietnamese Army.

====Kenya====
After the struggles for independence, including the Mau Mau Uprising, Kenya gained its independence from Britain in December 1963, riding the &#x27;winds of change&#x27;. In the following year, after President Jomo Kenyatta&#x27;s election in 1964, the pith helmet became a regulated hat of the uniform for provincial administrators and commissioners, who acted as representatives of the central government overseeing local management.

Originally, in Kenya and other African regions, the pith helmet was perceived as a product of reporters&#x27; exaggerations and misunderstood by readers. Travel books and magazines advised Europeans not to engage in outdoor activities without head coverings, claiming that exposure to direct tropical sunlight could cause their brains to deteriorate. While the articles may have been somewhat exaggerated, the pith helmet indeed protected against intense direct sunlight on the savanna, and its sturdy shell and liner shielded the head from collisions with branches in the jungle rainforest. The brim, resembling an eave, also served to prevent raindrops from entering the eyes or forming on glasses. Now, in addition to that, it has been left as a symbol of authority for free Africans.

====Commonwealth realms====
Several military units still use the pith helmet throughout the Commonwealth.

In the United Kingdom, the Royal Marines wear white Wolseley pattern helmets of the same general design as the old pith helmet as part of their number 1 or dress uniform. These date from 1912 in their present form and are made of natural cork covered in white cloth on the outside and shade green on the inside. Decoration includes a brass ball ornament at the top (a detail inherited from the Royal Marine Artillery), helmet plate, and chin chain.

The Home Service helmet is still worn by line infantry regiments in the United Kingdom today as part of full dress uniform. Although these units&#x27; wearing of full dress uniform largely ceased after the First World War, it continues to be worn by regimental bands, Corps of Drums, and guards of honour on ceremonial occasions. Such personnel are likewise directed to wear the Foreign Service helmet (either colonial pattern or Wolseley pattern according to regimental specification) when full dress uniform is worn &quot;in hot weather overseas stations such as Cyprus&quot;.

Within the British Overseas Territories, a white Wolseley helmet with red and white swan-feather plume is occasionally worn by colonial governors when in white tropical uniform. Since 2001, such dress has been provided only at the expense of the territory concerned and is no longer paid for by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The Royal Gibraltar Regiment routinely wear the white pith helmet with a white tunic (in summer) and scarlet tunic (in winter).

The pith helmet is used by Australian military bands, such as the Army Band and the Band of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, as well as the New South Wales Mounted Police, and the Band of the South Australia Police.

A white Wolseley helmet forms a part of the Canadian Army&#x27;s universal full-dress uniform, although specific units wear different headgear owing to authorized regimental differences. In addition, the pith helmet is also worn by cadets at the Royal Military College of Canada for certain parades and special occasion.

In the Bahamas, pith helmets are worn by the Royal Bahamas Police Force Band. A khaki or white pith helmet is part of the standard summer uniform of traffic officers in specific police departments in India. The pith helmet is also used by the Sri Lankan Police as part of their dress uniform.

====Other countries====
In the Dominican Republic, pith helmets with black pugarees were the standard duty headgear used by transit officers of the national police in the 1970s until the beginning of the 21st century, when these units were replaced by the creation of the &quot;Autoridad Metropolitana de Transporte&quot; (AMET) corps, which were issued dark green stetson hats instead.

In Greece, the Hellenic Navy band uses the pith helmet during its appearances (ex., at parades, when inspected by officials outside of churches, both events held during national feasts, etc.), with the Wolseley type one being used worn with full dress. It was possibly introduced at the beginning of the 20th century when the Hellenic Armed Forces were organized according to the French Army (the Hellenic Army) and the British Royal Navy (the Hellenic Navy).

Modern Italian municipal police wear a helmet modeled on the Model 1928 tropical helmet of the Royal Italian Army for foot patrols in summer. These are made from white plastic with cork or pith interior lining and resemble the British Custodian helmet, though taller and narrower.

Pith helmets are worn by the &quot;Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince&quot; of Monaco.

In the Philippines, some ceremonial units such as the Presidential Security Command and the guard of honor of the National Police use pith helmets.

They are also used by the King&#x27;s Guards of the Royal Thai Army when on guard duty; a similar helmet but with plumes is used when in the full dress uniform with the plumes in uniform facings (similar to the bearskin).

White Wolseley helmets are worn by mounted Presidential Guard members in Harare, Zimbabwe, during the State Opening of the first session of Parliament each year.

=== Civilian and commercial uses ===
The pith helmet has had a limited comeback in recent years, with their now novel appearance and genuine functionality making the headdress increasingly popular for gardening, hiking, safari, and other outdoor activities. Today&#x27;s helmets are generally available in four basic types (see below). These have changed little since the early 1900s, except that for more effortless adjustment; the inner headband utilises hook-and-loop fasteners (e.g., Velcro) instead of the earlier brass pins. They can also be soaked in water to keep the wearer&#x27;s head cool in hot weather and feature an adjustable chinstrap towards the front.

(i) French pith helmet. This is the most functional of the helmets, with its wide brim providing more sun protection than the narrow-brimmed variations. This helmet is mostly made in Vietnam, where the design was inherited from French colonial patterns.

(ii) Indian pith helmet. The Indian model is almost the same as the French one but with a slightly narrower brim and a squarer dome. It shares with other helmets the ventilation &quot;button&quot; atop the dome.

(iii) African pith helmet, or safari helmet, is a variation mainly used in savanna or jungle regions of Africa. It is generally a khaki-grey colour with the same dimensions and shape as the Indian helmet described above.

(iv) Wolseley pith helmet. This variation of the helmet was named after (but not designed by) Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Wolseley, an Anglo-Irish military commander, and widely used by the British Army and Colonial civil service from 1900. The Wolseley helmet differs from other pith helmets in having a more sloping brim with an apex at the front and back. The dome is also taller and more conical than the other more rounded variations. It is the helmet often portrayed as being worn by stereotypical &quot;Gentleman Explorers&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Over the last century and a half, the helmet has become an iconic piece of apparel identified with western explorers, big game hunters, archaeologists, paleontologists, biologists, botanists, soldiers, and colonists throughout Africa, southern Asia and South America. It was popularized by Theodore Roosevelt in the first half of the 20th century, and by cinema in the second.
Examples include:
* Many characters in Edgar Rice Burrough&#x27;s Tarzan franchise. Among them is Jane Porter in the 1931, 1981, and 1999 films.
* Mr. Pompous (Dr. Mustache), an ecologist and animal caretaker in Jungle Emperor Leo, 1989.
* Dr. Schweitzer, a medical volunteer and Nobel Peace Prize winner from the biographical film Albert Schweitzer, 2009
* The Marvel Comics mad scientist and mercenary Klaw on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;&quot;.
* Van Pelt, a big game hunter, in &quot;Jumanji&quot; and the TV series based on it.
* Jack Black playing Professor Sheldon Oberon in &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.
* Members of the British Army in the 1994 version of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, the war film &quot;Zulu&quot; and its prelude &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot;, and the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Empress of Mars&quot;. 
* Captain Cook on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Greatest Show in the Galaxy&quot;.
* The poacher Betty on &quot;Widget the World Watcher&quot;
* The hammerhead shark-themed poacher and temple robber known as the Collector on &quot;Atomic Betty&quot;.
* The title characters on &quot;Yin Yang Yo&quot; on the episodes &quot;Scary Scary Quite Contrary&quot; and &quot;Carl of the Wild&quot;.
* Thaddeus Thatch, the grandfather of main character Milo James Thatch (who himself briefly wears the same pith helmet early on), in the film &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="1237909" wikidata="Q1812665" url="?curid=1237909" title="Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song">
<text>Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song is a 1971 American independent blaxploitation action thriller film written, co-produced, scored, edited, directed by, and starring Melvin Van Peebles. His son Mario Van Peebles also appears in a small role, playing the title character as a young boy. The film tells the picaresque story of a poor black man fleeing from the white police authorities.

Van Peebles began to develop the film after being offered a three-picture contract for Columbia Pictures. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded it himself, shooting it independently over 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, some reportedly unsimulated. He received a $50,000 loan from Bill Cosby to complete the project. The film&#x27;s fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed reviews. However, it has left a lasting impression on American cinema.

The musical score of &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; was performed by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. Van Peebles did not have money for traditional advertising methods, so he released the soundtrack album prior to the film&#x27;s release in order to generate publicity. Initially, the film was screened in only two theaters in the United States (in Atlanta and Detroit). It went on to gross $15.2 million at the box office. Huey P. Newton celebrated and welcomed the film&#x27;s revolutionary implications, and &quot;Sweetback&quot; became required viewing for members of the Black Panther Party. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, it demonstrated to Hollywood that films which portrayed &quot;militant&quot; Blacks could be highly profitable, leading to the creation of the blaxploitation genre, although critic Roger Ebert did not consider this example of Van Peebles&#x27; work to be an exploitation film.

In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
A young African-American orphan is sheltered by a Los Angeles brothel in the 1940s. Working as a towel boy, he is seduced by one of the prostitutes. The women name him &quot;Sweet Sweetback&quot; in honor of his sexual prowess and large penis. As an adult, Sweetback performs in the whorehouse sex show.

One night, two white LAPD officers come in to speak to Sweetback&#x27;s boss, Beetle. A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community to bring in a suspect. The police suggest arresting Sweetback to appease their superiors, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence. Beetle agrees, and they arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers also arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu after some trouble. They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu, and beat him. In response, Sweetback fashions his handcuffs into brass knuckles and beats the officers, putting them into comas.

Sweetback returns to the whorehouse for help, but Beetle refuses out of fear of being arrested himself. As Sweetback leaves, he is arrested and beaten by order of the police chief, seeking information about Mu-Mu&#x27;s whereabouts, but escapes when a black revolutionary throws a Molotov cocktail at the police car transporting him to the station for more severe interrogation. He next visits an old girlfriend, who similarly refuses him aid but cuts his handcuffs off in exchange for sex. Sweetback then asks his priest for help, but he refuses for fear of the police shutting down the church&#x27;s drug rehab center.

Police officers interrogate Beetle, seeking to discover Sweetback&#x27;s whereabouts, rendering him deaf by firing a gun against each ear. Sweetback meets up with Mu-Mu and black gangsters drive them through South Central Los Angeles to the outskirts. Stopping overnight at a seemingly abandoned building, they discover it is a safe house for the Hells Angels. Their helmeted president challenges Sweetback to a duel: asked to decide the weapon and discovering she is a woman, he chooses sex and is judged to win.

The bikers leave the men in their club to await a member of the all black East Bay Dragons who will get them to Mexico. During the night, the club is raided by two policemen with drawn guns. Sweetback resists arrest and kills both officers in self-defense, but Mu-Mu is badly wounded. The next morning, the Dragon arrives, but his motorcycle can only carry one; Sweetback asks him to take Mu-Mu, as the activist is their future.

As Sweetback and Mu-Mu continue to evade arrest, pressure mounts on the police; the police chief warns his staff that the fugitives&#x27; example could prompt a black uprising. The police badly beat up a black man sleeping with a white woman, believing him to be probably one of the fugitives, and that he deserves a beating in any case. Later, Beetle, now in a wheelchair following the police brutality, is brought to the morgue to identify a body believed to be Sweetback and smiles when he sees it is someone else. As the police trawl black areas for him, they find Sweetback&#x27;s biological and rather confused mother, who reveals that his birth name is Leroy.

Sweetback pays a hippie to switch clothes with him, deceiving a police helicopter which sends a patrol car in pursuit. Sweetback was also wounded in the shootout and both stows away and hitches rides on trucks and a train heading south. Running through arid country, he survives by drinking from a puddle and eating a lizard. When police hear he might be at a rural hippie musical event, he successfully disguises himself by simulating sex in the bushes. He is later spotted and police borrow a farmer&#x27;s hunting dogs to track him. Realising he will cross the border before they reach him, a policeman releases the dogs, expecting them to catch and kill him. However, at the Tijuana River, Sweetback stabs the dogs and escapes into Mexico, swearing to return to &quot;collect some dues&quot;.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
During production on &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; for Columbia Pictures, Van Peebles attempted to rewrite the script in order to change it from a comedy poking fun at white liberals into the first black power film. The writer, Herman Raucher, who had based the script on friends of his who expressed liberal sentiments while still holding onto bigoted beliefs, objected to Van Peebles&#x27; efforts because he felt that the movie should be a parody of liberal culture. Raucher ultimately exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to novelize his own script, effectively preventing Peebles from too radically changing the film.

After &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; proved to be a financial success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles—still wanting to create the first black power film—developed the story for &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the Mojave Desert, turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, got out, and squatted down facing the sun. He decided that the film was going to be &quot;about a brother getting the Man&#x27;s foot out of his ass.&quot;

Because no studio would finance the film, Van Peebles put his own money into the production, and shot it independently. Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by Bill Cosby to complete the film. &quot;Cosby didn&#x27;t want an equity part,&quot; according to Van Peebles. &quot;He just wanted his money back.&quot; Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they would not do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.

===Filming===
According to Van Peebles, during the first day of shooting, director of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell told him he could not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights, because he believed the results would not appear well on film. Van Peebles told him to do it anyway. When he saw the rushes, Maxwell was overjoyed, and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot. Van Peebles shot the film over a relatively short period of 19 days in order to reduce the possibility of the cast, most of whom were amateurs, showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day. He shot the film in what he referred to as &quot;globs,&quot; where he would shoot entire sequences at a time.

Because Van Peebles could not afford a stunt man, he performed all of the stunts himself, which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes. At one point in the shoot, Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge. Bob Maxwell later stated, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s great, Mel, but let&#x27;s do it again.&quot; Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times. Van Peebles contracted gonorrhea when filming one of the many sex scenes, and successfully applied to the Directors Guild in order to get workers&#x27; compensation because he was &quot;hurt on the job&quot;. Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film.

Van Peebles and several key crew members were armed because it was dangerous to attempt to create a film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop.

While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to stay until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crew members were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.

Van Peebles had received a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, there was no time to have it filed before shooting the scene. When the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.

According to Van Peebles, the dead dogs seen in the film&#x27;s final scenes were sourced from a humane society: &quot;Boy, were we lucky... At first, the society didn&#x27;t even think it could help us... but after a little donation, they looked in their refrigerator again, I guess, and found almost exactly what we were looking for...&quot;

===Directing===
Van Peebles stated that he approached directing the film &quot;like you do the cupboard when you&#x27;re broke and hungry: throw in everything eatable and hope to come out on top with the seasoning, i.e., by editing&quot;. Van Peebles stated that &quot;story-wise, I came up with an idea, why not the direct approach. ... To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn&#x27;t be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario.&quot;

Van Peebles wanted &quot;a victorious film ... where niggers could walk out standing tall instead of avoiding each other&#x27;s eyes, looking once again like they&#x27;d had it&quot;. Van Peebles was aware of the fact that films produced by major studios would appear to be more polished than low-budget independently made features, and was determined to make a film that &quot;[looked] as good as anything one of the major studios could turn out&quot;.

Van Peebles knew that in order to spread his message, the film &quot;simply couldn&#x27;t be a didactic discourse which would end up playing ... to an empty theater except for ten or twenty aware brothers who would pat me on the back and say it tells it like it is&quot; and that &quot;to attract the mass we have to produce work that not only instructs but entertains&quot;. Van Peebles also wanted to make a film that would &quot;be able to sustain itself as a viable commercial product ... [The Man] ain&#x27;t about to go carrying no messages for you, especially a relevant one, for free.&quot;

Van Peebles wanted half of his shooting crew &quot;to be third world people. ... So at best a staggering amount of my crew would be relatively inexperienced. ... Any type of film requiring an enormous technical sophistication at the shooting stage should not be attempted.&quot; Van Peebles knew that gaining financing for the film would not be easy and expected &quot;a great deal of animosity from the film media (white in the first place and right wing in the second) at all levels of filmmaking&quot;, thus he had to &quot;write a flexible script where emphasis could be shifted. In short, stay loose.&quot;

===Editing===
The film&#x27;s fast-paced montages and jump cuts were novel features for an American movie at the time. Stephen Holden from &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that the film&#x27;s editing had &quot;a jazzy, improvisational quality, and the screen is often streaked with jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback&#x27;s alienation&quot;. In &quot;The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity&quot;, author S. Torriano Berry writes that the film&#x27;s &quot;odd camera angles, superimpositions, reverse-key effects, box and matting effects, rack-focus shots, extreme zooms, stop-motion and step-printing, and an abundance of jittery handheld camera work all helped to express the paranoid nightmare that [Sweetback&#x27;s] life had become&quot;.

===Music===

Since Van Peebles did not have the money to hire a composer, he composed the film&#x27;s music score himself. Because he did not know how to read or write music, he numbered all of the keys on a piano so he could remember the melodies. Van Peebles stated that &quot;Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa. Effects and music [...] are strictly secondary considerations. Very few look at film with sound considered as a creative third dimension. So I calculate the scenario in such a way that sound can be used as an integral part of the film.&quot;

The film&#x27;s music was performed by the then-unknown group Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, who were living in a single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles&#x27; secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music. By alternating hymn-based vocalization and jazz rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of sampling in hip hop music.

Van Peebles recalls that &quot;music was not used as a selling tool in movies at the time. Even musicals, it would take three months after the release of the movie before they would bring out an album.&quot; Because Van Peebles did not have any money for traditional advertising methods, he decided that by releasing a soundtrack album in anticipation of the film&#x27;s release, he could help build awareness for the film with its music.

==Release==

&quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; was released on March 31, 1971, at the Grand Circus Theatre in Detroit and on April 2, 1971, at the Coronet Theatre in Atlanta. Melvin Van Peebles stated that &quot;at first, only two theaters in the United States would show the picture: one in Detroit, and one in Atlanta. The first night in Detroit, it broke all the theater&#x27;s records, and that was only on the strength of the title alone, since nobody had seen it yet. By the second day, people would take their lunch and sit through it three times. I knew that I was finally talking to my audience. &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; made thousands of dollars in its first day.&quot; It grossed $70,000 in its first week in Detroit.

The film earned $4.1 million in rentals in the US and Canada, and went on to gross over $15 million at the box office.

===Censorship===
After receiving an X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, which inspired the advertising tagline &quot;Rated X by an all-white jury&quot;, distributors and exhibitors (including the Music Hall theater in Boston) removed nine minutes. Van Peebles stated, &quot;Should the rest of the community submit to your censorship that is its business, but White standards shall no longer be imposed on the Black community.&quot;

The Region 2 DVD release from BFI Video alters the opening sex sequences. A notice at the beginning of the DVD states &quot;In order to comply with UK law (the Protection of Children Act 1978), a number of images in the opening sequence of this film have been obscured.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Critical response was mixed. Kevin Thomas in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the film as &quot;a series of stark, earthy vignettes, Van Peebles evokes the vitality, humor, pain, despair and omnipresent fear that is life for so many African-Americans&quot;. Stephen Holden in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an innovative, yet politically inflammatory film&quot;. The film website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 73% &quot;Fresh&quot; from 30 reviews. The end of the film was shocking to Black viewers who had expected that Sweetback would perish at the hands of the police—a common, even inevitable, fate of Black men &quot;on the run&quot; in prior films. Film critic Roger Ebert cited the ending as a reason for the film not to be labeled as an exploitation film.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Clayton Riley viewed the film favorably, commenting on its aesthetic innovation, but stated of the character of Sweetback that he &quot;is the ultimate sexualist in whose seemingly vacant eyes and unrevealing mouth are written the protocols of American domestic colonialism&quot;. In another review, Riley explained that &quot;Sweetback, the profane sexual athlete and fugitive, is based on a reality that is Black. We may not want him to exist but he does.&quot; Critic Donald Bogle states in a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview that the film in some ways met the Black audience&#x27;s compensatory needs after years of asexual, Sidney Poitier-type characters and that they wanted a &quot;viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero&quot;.

In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film&#x27;s place in history: &quot;Not since Oscar Micheaux had an African-American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment...[it] depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other.&quot;

&quot;Metroactive&quot;″s Nicky Baxter&#x27;s response is mixed: &quot;&quot;Sweet Sweetback&quot; introduced the biggest and baddest buck of the [blaxploitation era]. Warts and all, the film is perhaps the closest analogy to the progressive aims of the then-flourishing Black Arts movement. Indeed, it can be argued that because it was written, produced and directed by an American-born African outside of Hollywood, the film is not truly part of the blaxploitation genre, yet it cannot be denied that it shares certain thematic similarities. The film works best when it follows Sweetback&#x27;s odyssey from stud boy to proto-nationalist consciousness. Unlike the Horatio Alger-style integrationism propagated in past films about blacks, here we see an outlaw among outlaws, nourished by a community segregated from the mainstream. It is in this disenfranchised community—and not the sterile offices of the NAACP—that he seeks and finds refuge. The sordid sexual trysts, the faux fantasies in the desert are, finally, less interesting than Sweetback&#x27;s quest for self-realization.&quot;

===Notable reactions===
Huey P. Newton, devoting an entire issue of &quot;The Black Panther&quot; to the film&#x27;s revolutionary implications, celebrated and welcomed the film as &quot;the first truly revolutionary Black film made [...] presented to us by a Black man.&quot; Newton wrote that &quot;Sweetback&quot; &quot;presents the need for unity among all members and institutions within the community of victims,&quot; contending that this is evidenced by the opening credits which state the film stars &quot;The Black Community,&quot; a collective protagonist engaged in various acts of community solidarity that aid Sweetback in escaping. Newton further argued that &quot;the film demonstrates the importance of unity and love between Black men and women,&quot; as demonstrated &quot;in the scene where the woman makes love to the young boy but in fact baptizes him into his true manhood&quot;. This is, in fact, the rape scene mentioned in the earlier plot summary. The film became required viewing for members of the Black Panther Party.

A few months after the publication of Newton&#x27;s article, historian Lerone Bennett Jr. responded with an essay on the film in &quot;Ebony&quot;, titled &quot;The Emancipation Orgasm: Sweetback in Wonderland,&quot; in which he discussed the film&#x27;s &quot;black aesthetic&quot;. Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that &quot;some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes.&quot; Bennett concluded that the film is &quot;neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation.&quot; Bennett described Sweetback&#x27;s sexual initiation at ten years old as the &quot;rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute&quot;.

Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as &quot;emancipation orgasms&quot; and stated that &quot;it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 that they are going to be able to screw their way across the Red Sea. Fucking will not set you free. If fucking freed, black people would have celebrated the millennium 400 years ago.&quot; Poet and author Haki R. Madhubuti (then known as Don L. Lee) agreed with Bennett&#x27;s assessment of the film, stating that it was &quot;a limited, money-making, auto-biographical fantasy of the odyssey of one Melvin Van Peebles through what he considered to be the Black community.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; is considered to be an important film in the history of African-American cinema. The film was credited by &quot;Variety&quot; as leading to the creation of the blaxploitation genre, largely consisting of exploitation films made by white directors. As Spike Lee states, &quot;&quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; gave us all the answers we needed. This was an example of how to make a film (a real movie), distribute it yourself, and most important, get &quot;paid&quot;. Without &quot;Sweetback&quot; who knows if there could have been a [...] &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Shuffle&quot;, or &quot;House Party&quot;?&quot;

Robert Reid-Pharr wrote that &quot;...[&quot;Sweetback&quot;] was seen (correctly I believe) as the first in a long line of so-called Blaxploitation features...&quot; and goes on to say that Van Peebles was &quot;one of the first artists to bring not only compelling but realistic images of Black Americans into mainstream cinemas, breaking with decades-long traditions ...&quot;

In 2004, Mario Van Peebles directed and starred as his father in &quot;Baadasssss!&quot;, a biopic about the making of &quot;Sweet Sweetback&quot;. The film was a critical but not commercial success.

In a 2019 reference book published by the Museum of Modern Art to commemorate key works of art in its collection, Anne Morra, Associate Curator of the department of film, says &quot;Sweetback&quot;&#x27;s importance goes beyond the history of filmmaking and that its impact on &quot;social consciousness, culture, and political discourse remains indisputable&quot;.

<doc id="1237915" wikidata="Q6975250" url="?curid=1237915" title="Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England">
<text>The Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England provides a listing and classification system for historic parks and gardens similar to that used for listed buildings. The register was set up by Historic England under the provisions of the National Heritage Act 1983. Over 1,600 sites are listed, ranging from the grounds of large stately homes to small domestic gardens, as well other designed landscapes such as town squares, public parks and cemeteries. The register is published on the National Heritage List for England alongside other national heritage designations. 

==Purpose==
The register aims to &quot;celebrate designed landscapes of note, and encourage appropriate protection&quot;, so safeguarding the features and qualities of key landscapes for the future. It is hoped that listing sites of special interest will increase awareness of their value and encourage those who own them, or who have a part to play in their protection, to treat the sites with due care, whether this is a question of carrying out appropriate maintenance or making changes to the site. 

If a park or garden has been registered using the designation process under the National Heritage Act 1983 it has legal protection. Registration is a material consideration in the planning process so, following a planning application for development which would affect a registered park or garden, local planning authorities must take into account the historic interest of the site when deciding whether or not to grant permission for any changes. Although the inclusion brings no additional statutory controls in itself, English local authorities are required by government to take the protection of the historic environment into account in their policies and resource allocations. If material changes are made to a registered park or garden without having been granted planning permission first, local planning authorities may require that the changes are undone and, in extreme cases, a prosecution may result.

The register is also used in influencing management decisions, to improve public awareness of important parks and elements within them and to encourage their owners to preserve and maintain them. Gardening and landscape design have long been important preoccupations to the British and, although a wealth of historic parks and gardens exist, they are a fragile and finite resource: they can easily be damaged beyond repair or lost forever.

Since 1995, the Garden History Society has been a statutory consultee in relation to planning proposals which affect historic designed landscapes identified by Historic England as being of national significance and which are included on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. This means that when a planning authority receives a planning application which affects a site on the Register, or the setting of such a site, the planning authority must consult the Garden History Society. This applies to registered sites of all grades. In addition, Historic England must be consulted where a planning proposal affects a site which is included on the Register at Grade I or Grade II*.

==Register==
An online searchable register of all registered parks and gardens that are legally protected through the designation system, has been incorporated into the National Heritage List for England currently available through the Historic England website. This shows the relevant list entry which describes the park or garden, and shows where it is on a map. Not all designated parks and gardens are open to the public. 
Information on historic parks and gardens can also be searched online via &quot;Parks &amp; Gardens UK&quot; (a partnership between the Association of Gardens Trusts and the University of York). This site does not claim to have any statutory authority and includes a wider range of sites across the UK.

==Eligibility==
Eligibility for the register is based around documentary research and field survey which attempts to classify and date each park according to set criteria. These are:

*Parks and gardens with a main phase of development prior to 1750 even when only a small part is still evident.
*Sites with a main phase of development dating to between 1750 and 1820 where enough of the park or garden&#x27;s landscape survives to reflect the original design.
*Sites with a main phase of development between 1820 and 1880 which is deemed important and survives relatively intact.
*Sites with a main phase of development between 1880 and 1939 where this is of high importance and survives intact.
*Sites with a main phase of development laid out since the Second World War, but are more than 30 years old, where the park or garden is of exceptional importance.
*Sites influential in the development of taste whether through repute or literary references.
*Sites which are early or representative examples of a style of layout, or type, or the work of a landscape architect of national importance.
*Sites with an association with significant people or historical events.
*Sites with strong group value, as with some listed buildings.

As with listed buildings, parks and gardens are graded on a scale, Grade I being internationally significant sites are therefore the most important and constitute around 10% of the total number. Historically important gardens are Grade II* (about 30% of the total) and the remainder are of regional or national importance and are Grade II registered.

==Other parts of the United Kingdom==
Separate registers of parks, gardens and designed landscapes are maintained in the other countries of the United Kingdom:

* The Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales is maintained by Cadw
* The Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland is maintained by Historic Environment Scotland
* The Register of Parks, Gardens and Demesnes of Special Historic Interest is maintained by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency

<text>&quot;Die Publicisten&quot; (The Publicists, Op. 321) is a waltz by Johann Strauss II composed in 1868. It was written for the sixth Concordia Ball held in the Sofienbad-Saal on the 4 February of the same year. The waltz&#x27;s title was an allusion to Vienna&#x27;s press, with whom he maintained a fruitful partnership that his family had enjoyed since the days of his father Johann Strauss I. The more or less symbiotic association was needed as the musical business of composers would inevitably flourish under favorable press reviews and the establishment of the Vienna Journalists&#x27; and Authors&#x27; Association in 1859 would signify an even more closer relationship between both composer and the press. The Concordia Ball named after the Roman God of civic concord had its first ball in 1863.

This waltz came at a time when Strauss&#x27; creative genius was at its pinnacle, with the famous waltzes Wiener Bonbons Op. 307, The Blue Danube &quot;An der Schönen Blauen Donau&quot; Op. 314 and Künstlerleben Op. 316 already completed, with the more compelling G&#x27;schichten aus dem Wienerwald waltz Op. 325 and the Wein, Weib und Gesang waltz op. 333 still to come. It also made a brief appearance in the pastiche ballet &quot;Graduation Ball&quot; by Antal Doráti in the &quot;Perpetuum Mobile dance&quot; number 10.

&quot;Die Publicisten&quot; is composed in the typical five two-part sections waltz (hereinafter referred as waltz A and waltz B). The waltz&#x27;s introduction was announced with trumpets and other brass instruments before a brief accelerating march melody halts and the waltz themes start. Waltz 1A begins in a hesitant manner while waltz 1B is more flowing but not overly joyous. Waltz 2A intertwine between these moods but rushes to a joyful Waltz 2B. A brief waltz beat intrada ushers in the solemn and plaintive Waltz 3A and the gentler but noticeably happier section 3B. Another brief intrada brings in the cheeky-sounding waltz 4A whereas 4B is accompanied by triangles while the unobtrusive mood of the piece continues. Yet another brief intrada brings in the peaceful waltz 5A while in the final section 5B, Strauss allows the genial nature of the piece to unfold until the coda. After the brief but restless-sounding coda, the entire waltzes 2A and 2B are repeated once. The first section is played again before rushing into an exciting and joyous conclusion, with the typical snare drum roll and the brass flourish.

<text>Surferosa is a rock band from Norway formed in 2000, known for its distinct costumes and &quot;trashy electrified pop&quot; music. The band&#x27;s musical style is primarily rock with punk/new wave and dance music influences and has been labeled &quot;thrash pop&quot;. Most songs make integrated use of synthesizers, and Mariann provides a spunky vocal lead. The group is often compared to New Wave acts such as Blondie.

Hailing from Bø in Telemark, Surferosa became popular in Norway after winning a tour and studio recording in a band contest called So What. It has received several positive critical reviews. Surferosa has completed tours in Asia, America, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. It also made the soundtrack for the movie Bare Bea. The group&#x27;s song &quot;Royal Uniform&quot; from the album &quot;The Force&quot; was used on the soundtrack for the computer/video game &quot;FIFA 07&quot; released by EA Sports. The song has also been released as a downloadable track for Singstar on the PlayStation 3. &quot;Scandinavian Decay&quot;, another song of theirs, was also used as a song in the Sims 2.

The name Surferosa is taken from a record by the Pixies.

In December 2009, Surferosa announced on their Myspace blog that they are taking a break from performing and recording, and have not made any further announcement since.

<text>.nr is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Nauru. Domains must be paid, and can be ordered from CenpacNet, Nauru&#x27;s Internet service provider.

The original configuration of the .nr TLD domain was performed by Shaun Moran of ComTech Communications (Australia) in 1998 as part of the first Internet connectivity on the island. There was a lengthy process with IANA to get the .nr domain approved and assigned at the time. The setup of .nr was done in 2002 by Franck Martin using specific custom code.

== Second-level domains ==
In addition to the 2nd level direct domains which the registry offers, these are the official second-level domains under which third-level registrations are offered by the registry:
== Usage outside of Nauru ==
The .nr domain has low usage outside of Nauru. However, when it is used, it can be found on web domains utilising domain hacks, such as hdm.nr (Headminer), domai.nr (Domainr) or exo.nr (Exonar).

From 2002 to 2018, a domain service freedomain.pro offered free subdomain hosting under the unofficial subdomain &quot;co.nr&quot;. As of 1 May 2018, issues with the .nr registry and Nauruan government caused the entire .co.nr domain to shut down and its subdomains to stop functioning.

<doc id="1237933" wikidata="Q541805" url="?curid=1237933" title="Mike Hooper (footballer)">
<text>Michael Dudley Hooper (born 10 February 1964) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

As a player, he notably played in the Premier League for both Liverpool and Newcastle United, although most of his time at both clubs saw him operate as second choice behind the likes of Bruce Grobbelaar and Pavel Srnicek. He also played in the Football League for Bristol City, Wrexham, Leicester City and Sunderland.

==Early life==
Hooper attended Glenfrome Junior School. As goalkeeper for the school team, his towering height proved an imposing sight to the opposition. He later attended Lockleaze Comprehensive School and played as goalkeeper in the same school team as fellow future professional footballers Gary Smart, Gary Penrice and Ian Holloway, who were all roughly the same age.

Hooper received a first class degree in English Literature at Swansea University.

==Club career==
Having started his professional career at Bristol City in 1983, and tasting regular senior football after signing for Wrexham in the 1984-85 season, Hooper was signed by newly appointed Liverpool player-manager Kenny Dalglish for the 1985-86 season. His debut for Liverpool came in the 1986 FA Charity Shield as a substitute for Bruce Grobbelaar. He was at Anfield for eight years, during which time the club won six major trophies, but his first team opportunities were limited by the presence of Grobbelaar, his only real opportunities of first team football coming in 1988–89 when Grobbelaar missed 17 league games through illness, but when Grobbelaar recovered Hooper was back in the reserves. The arrival of David James in 1992 made his first team chances look even slimmer.

On 23 September 1993 Hooper signed for Newcastle United, who had recently been promoted to the Premier League, making his debut two days later with a clean sheet against West Ham. Again, his first team opportunities were restricted, this time by Pavel Srnicek, and he was loaned out to neighbours Sunderland in 1994–95 to gain more first team opportunities, although he did not play a first team game for them. 

His fate was sealed when he was caught on camera openly laughing, whilst on the bench, after Newcastle had conceded a goal. He never played senior football again. The signing of Shaka Hislop confirmed this and left Hooper with little hope of even a place on the Newcastle bench during the 1995–96 season, but he remained at the club until the end of his contract in the summer of 1996 and finally left on a free transfer.

==Personal life==
Mike Hooper is the great-great-grandson of Frank Bacon, a one-time director of Bristol City, and the great-great-grandnephew of Canadian politician and King&#x27;s Printer, Herbert Henry Ball. He has two children.

He has since worked as a nightclub bouncer in County Durham.

<text>.pa is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Panama. It was first registered in 1994-05-25. It is administered by NIC Panamá, which is run by the Universidad Tecnologica de Panama.

Because &quot;PA&quot; is also the postal code for the U.S. state of Pennsylvania and the Brazilian state of Pará, it has had occasional use under that meaning, but this has not become widespread.

==Structure==
Registrations are taken directly at the second level, and at the third level under the designated second level domains.

==Restrictions==

Any term that is listed in the list of reserved terms cannot be registered as a domain name. The list consists of, but is not limited to, other generic and country-code TLDs, country names, governmental entities, and DNS related terminology.

The server the domain points to can be located in any country; with the exception of .gob.pa domains, which are used solely for Panamanian Government agencies or institutions, should point to a server physically located in Panama.

<doc id="1237970" wikidata="Q3787223" url="?curid=1237970" title="Howard Gayle">
<text>Howard Anthony Gayle (born 18 May 1958) is an English former footballer who played for Birmingham City, Blackburn Rovers, Fulham, Halifax Town, Liverpool, Newcastle United, Sunderland and Stoke City.

Gayle began his career with Liverpool, becoming the first black player to play for the team. After loan spells with Fulham and Newcastle United he joined Birmingham City in search of regular first team football. He then played for Sunderland and had a short spell in the United States playing indoor football with the Dallas Sidekicks. He returned to England and played for Stoke City, Blackburn Rovers and ended his career with Halifax Town.

==Club career==
Gayle was born in Toxteth and joined the youth ranks at local side Liverpool in 1974. He signed a professional contract with the club in 1977, becoming the first black player to play for Liverpool, which was seen as a &quot;victory&quot; for the black community in Liverpool.

His finest hour for Liverpool came in the 1980–81 European Cup semi-final second leg away at Bayern Munich when he came on as an early substitute to help Liverpool draw 1–1 and progress to the final on the away goals rule. Although he was a non-playing substitute in the final, he was rewarded with a winner&#x27;s medal. After loan spells at Fulham and Newcastle United he left Anfield after making just five appearances. While at Newcastle he became the first Black player to represent them in the Football League when he made his debut against Cambridge United on 27 November 1982.

Gayle joined Birmingham City where he played in the 1982–83 season scoring once against West Ham and then he hit 10 in 45 during the 1983–84 campaign. Gayle then signed for Len Ashurst&#x27;s Sunderland, where he became a popular player playing in two seasons before moving to the United States to play for Dallas Sidekicks in the Major Indoor Soccer League. He returned to England in April 1987 to play for Stoke City, playing six matches at the end of the 1986–87 season, scoring twice in a 3–2 defeat against Bradford City.

He then spent five years at Blackburn Rovers, where he was that club&#x27;s first black player, the third club where he had achieved this milestone. He signed for them in 1987 and was a regular striker in their quest for top-flight football. However, by the time Blackburn were promoted to the newly created Premier League in 1992, Gayle had fallen down the pecking order in favour of expensive new signings Mike Newell and David Speedie, and with the arrival of national record signing Alan Shearer that summer, it was clear that Blackburn manager Kenny Dalglish felt that Gayle was surplus to requirements at Ewood Park.

Gayle joined Halifax Town in the newly renamed Division Three but managed just five league appearances as they were relegated to the Football Conference. After leaving Halifax he had a brief trial at Carlisle United, before retiring from football.

==International career==
As an overage player, he helped England win the 1984 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, in which he scored a goal in the final against Spain.

==Personal life==
Gayle was born to a father from Sierra Leone and a mother from Ghana. In August 2016, it was reported that Gayle had turned down a nomination for an MBE for his work with &quot;Show Racism the Red Card&quot;, saying it would be &quot;a betrayal to all of the Africans who have lost their lives, or who have suffered as a result of Empire.&quot;

He released his autobiography in October 2016 titled &quot;61 Minutes in Munich&quot;.

<text>A shooting range, firing range, gun range or shooting ground is a specialized facility, venue, or field designed specifically for firearm usage qualifications, training, practice, or competitions. Some shooting ranges are operated by military or law enforcement agencies, though the majority of ranges are privately owned by civilians and sporting clubs and cater mostly to recreational shooters. Each facility is typically overseen by one or more supervisory personnel, known as a &quot;Range Officer&quot; (RO), or sometimes a &quot;range master&quot; in the United States. Supervisory personnel are responsible for ensuring that all safety rules and relevant laws are followed at all times.

Shooting ranges can be indoor or outdoor, and may be restricted to certain types of firearm that can be used such as handguns or long guns, or they can specialize in certain Olympic disciplines such as trap/skeet shooting or 10 m air pistol/rifle. Most indoor ranges restrict the use of high-power calibers, rifles, or fully automatic firearms.

A shooting gallery is a recreational shooting facility with toy guns (usually very low-power airguns such as BB guns or airsoft guns, occasionally light guns or even water guns), often located within amusement parks, arcades, carnivals or fairgrounds, to provide safe casual games and entertainment for the visiting crowd by prizing customers with various dolls, toys and souvenirs as trophies.

==Type==
In urban areas, most shooting ranges will be at indoor facilities. Indoor ranges offer sheltering from inclement weather conditions and can be operated around the clock under a controlled environment. Outdoor shooting ranges are typically found away from populated areas due to concerns of safety, noise pollution and soil contamination.

===Indoor range===

Indoor shooting ranges are usually constructed as standalone structures, though they may be housed in larger buildings in isolated areas such as the basement. The basic components of most indoor ranges consist of firing lines/lanes, targets and a bullet trap/&quot;backstop&quot; (which prevents stray shots and overpenetrations). Design considerations may vary depending on planned use but they all must address the basic requirements for operating the range safely, and that is provide ballistic protection, safety controls, proper ventilation, acoustic isolation and appropriate lighting.

==== Structural components ====

Firing range walls are usually constructed of poured concrete, precast concrete or masonry blocks. The walls must be sufficiently impenetrable and provide adequate ballistic protection from stray shots and back-splatter. Floors are constructed from dense reinforced concrete with a smooth surface finish and are usually slanted slightly from up range (shooter positions) toward the backstops downrange to allow for better maintenance and cleaning.

Indoor range roofs are constructed from steel joists or precast concrete panels with a smooth flat surface that will redirect misfired bullets, facilitate maintenance, and prevent lead buildup. Roof baffles are installed at a 25–30 degree angle to protect ceilings, lighting fixtures, ventilation ducts, and any other unprotected element from stray bullets. Baffles are typically constructed of armored plate steel covered with fire-rated plywood. Deflectors are similar to baffles, but are not usually covered with plywood; they can be installed either vertically or horizontally and are used to redirect stray bullets from unprotected fixtures and elements inside the firing range such as doors, windows, and ventilation registers. Shields are constructed of plate steel and plywood.

The central controls for the firing range equipment, communication, lighting, and security are housed in control rooms or stations. The range master, who is in charge of range operation and management, operates the controls. The control station must provide the range master with an unobstructed line of sight of the firing lanes and all shooters. Control stations are usually constructed of concrete blocks with bulletproof observation windows.

Backstops and bullet traps are used to absorb the energy from the projectile and capture it to prevent overflight beyond the range area. Bullet traps come in a variety of designs and are usually constructed of impenetrable metal plates. The thickness of the plates and the materials used depend on the velocity and energy levels of the projectiles to be fired in the range. The majority of modern bullet traps are made up of angled hardened steel plates that redirect bullets into other metal plates, releasing their energy. The plates must be resistant to penetration, abrasion, and metal fatigue. The traps direct the spent bullets to a collection area in front of the trap or, for high-energy projectiles, at the back of the trap.

Many indoor ranges provide additional spaces such as a cleaning room for weapons, a classroom, restrooms (including shower facilities), office areas, lounge area, or storage and maintenance rooms. Passageways are used to physically isolate the firing range from the adjoining areas.

==== Physical components ====

Some shooting ranges are equipped with shooting booths to provide shooters with a defined private area and to reduce potential hazard from misfires and prevent ejected cartridge cases from hitting/distracting adjacent shooters. Shooting booths are made of partitions or panels which can be acoustically treated to reduce the unpleasant effects of noise on surrounding bystanders. The booths are sometimes equipped with communication or target-operation equipment; target or booth lighting controls; shelves for holding weapons and bullets, or to prevent shooters from going downrange; and equipment for practicing shooting from behind a barrier. The firing line, usually marked red or orange, runs along the downrange edge of the shooting booths. Some ranges have motion detectors that can set off an alarm when a shooter passes this line during shooting.

Target systems consist of a target object and optionally a target carrier system and a target control system. Some ranges utilise electronic scoring systems which do not require paper targets to be placed downrange. Targets for indoor ranges are usually a paper sheet or piece of corrugated cardboard with a printed image, either a bullseye or a silhouette.

Target carrier systems allow a range to operate more efficiently and safely by transporting targets between the firing line and the target line, so the shooter does not have to wait for a &quot;ceasefire&quot; and physically walk downrange to examine and set up the target. This is particularly useful on commercial and &quot;self service&quot; ranges. The target control system allows the range master to control the operation and movement of the targets through a central control station in the control booth. Some ranges provide local control modules that can be operated in the shooting booths. Many smaller clubs or competition ranges may not bother with target carriers as shooters fire in timed details anyway, and match targets will be collected for scoring at the end of each detail. Electronic scoring systems are increasingly common on such ranges, which eliminate paper targets and manual scoring.

==== Operational components ====

A critical component in the design and proper operation of an indoor ranges is the ventilation system. Proper ventilation reduces shooters&#x27; exposure to airborne lead particles and other combustion byproducts. Ventilation systems consist of supply and exhaust air systems and associated ductwork. Supply air can be provided through a perforated wall plenum or radial air diffusers mounted at ceiling height. Airflow along the firing line should be no more than 0.38 m/s (75 feet per minute, fpm) with a minimum acceptable flow of 0.25 m/s (50 fpm). Air is typically exhausted at or behind the bullet trap. Some firing ranges are designed to have multiple exhaust points downrange to maintain downrange flow and desired velocities at the firing line. The exhaust system should be designed to provide minimum duct air velocities of 12.70 – 15.24 m/s (2,500 – 3,000 fpm). The equipment and designs for the ventilation systems are varied, most firing ranges have one supply and one exhaust fan, however, some have multiple supply or exhaust fans. Very often, the air-flow rate required by the firing range and space constraints for the fans dictate the number and types of fans. Most firing ranges have systems that supply 100% outside air to the firing range and exhaust all of the air to outside the building; but, some firing range ventilation systems are designed to recirculate some of the exhaust air to the supply air system to conserve energy especially in extreme climates. The exhaust air is always filtered before being exhausted outside the building or recirculated to the supply system.

Lighting in the range consists of control booth, uprange area, shooting booth, and downrange lighting systems. Control booth lighting is usually manually controlled and consists of general lighting and low-level lighting used during particular shooting conditions. Lighting uprange of the booths is general ceiling-level lighting and can usually be controlled manually or from the central controls. Lights downrange of the firing line are usually spotlights used to illuminate the targets at various distances downrange of the booths.

Safety control systems are installed to protect the shooters during range malfunction or emergency situations. Such systems may include warning lights, alarm bells, and air-flow and filtration monitors.

==== Airgun Ranges ====

Due to the lower power of most airguns, it is often possible to operate airgun ranges safely in multi-use and improvised spaces. This is particularly true of ISSF-oriented airguns which are limited to muzzle energies of 6ft-lb.

Suitable ranges can be set up in sports halls or function rooms, using simple wooden backers, pellet catchers or lightweight ballistic curtains to protect the wall behind. Although safe handling practices for lead pellets must be followed, the lack of combustion gases negates the need for the high-performance ventilation systems required on conventional indoor ranges. Such arrangements are particularly common for major championships. Few locations could justify the expense of maintaining a permanent range with 80+ firing lanes, but such a range can be set up temporarily in large sports halls or exhibition centres. This is the approach taken by major European events such as InterShoot, RIAC and the Welsh Airgun Championships.

===Outdoor range===
Outdoor shooting ranges are used for longer-distance shooting up to or exceeding . Training might also specifically require exposure to the elements such as wind, dust and rain. Outdoor competition shooting is preferred under benign weather conditions, although conditions may change, competition is only abandoned when safety becomes an issue.

Outdoor ranges are designed to contain all fired shots. This necessitates a high retaining wall behind the target line called a backstop or stop-butt, comprising an earth mound, sandbag barrier or specially designed funnel-shaped traps to catch and prevent misaligned shots, errant projectile ricochets, or shots going beyond the bounds of the shooting range. Most outdoor ranges restrict the maximum caliber size and/or projectile energy based on the design specification of the range. Some target-shooting ranges have separate facilities devoted to the use of higher-powered firearms such as .50 caliber.
Outdoor ranges may be partially enclosed and so have some features in common with indoor ranges, for example the British Armed Forces barrack range has a roofed firing point and normally has 360° walls. As its name suggests, it is generally found in military bases rather than in the more remote areas common to outdoor ranges. Outdoor ranges for ISSF and Olympic shooting events often have heavily sheltered firing points to protect athletes, spectators and media from inclement weather as well as housing the sophisticated electronic target systems.

Several studies of outdoor ranges have shown that prolonged exposure to lead and noise can cause health problems, particularly among employees and instructors.

Due to their larger area and more &quot;open air&quot; nature, outdoor ranges need less cleaning and maintenance than indoor ranges. However, despite the natural ventilation of outdoor firing ranges, some outdoor ranges have ballistic baffles overhead, and concrete walls and structures on the sides that can cause the air to stagnate and lead to increase exposure to lead and noise.

Consequently, operators of outdoor ranges might consider adding sound transmission barriers, absorptive materials, and natural vegetation to lessen noise emission. Fans pointing downrange can provide air movement away from shooters to lessen lead exposure.

;Air rifle
:Outdoor air rifle ranges can have a fixed distance such as or or be an area for the practice of the sport of field target shooting, where reset metal targets are placed in natural surroundings at various distances and elevations, with a pellet trap behind the target.

;Small-bore rifle

:Small-bore (.22 Long Rifle caliber) rifle ranges are typically to accommodate the Olympic 50 m Rifle event, but they can extend to . These ranges are found around the world as part of various cadet shooting programs, sometimes reduced to , or in American parlance &quot;the thousand-inch range&quot;. Often called &quot;miniature rifle ranges&quot;, they featured as training establishments for initial military marksmanship training using lower-cost ammunition imparting less recoil or for entertainment carnival games.

;Full-bore rifle
:Target shooting range for larger-caliber centerfire rifles are no shorter than , except in the case of &quot;Zero&quot; ranges used for setting or checking the zero of sights using special &quot;ladder&quot; targets. &quot;Zero&quot;. Military ranges are typically at least to safely accommodate the range of most rifles. Public ranges can be as long as and typically accommodate hunters and sportsman participating in sports such as 300 m Standard Rifle, metallic silhouette or benchrest shooting.

;Shotgun

:Specialist ranges cater for various clay pigeon shooting events and require special layouts and equipment.

===Archery ranges===

Oftentimes the same range is made available to both bow and gun shooters. However, there are many ranges that have been made available exclusively for archers, which lack the backstop to safely contain bullets The most popular types of archery ranges include 3-D ranges, field ranges and indoor ranges.

== Components ==
===Firing point===
The firing point normally is at a defined point on the ground, and on a civilian range will usually be level and flat. Outdoor ranges without a covered firing point are usually grass, often on a slightly raised, flattened mound. Outdoor ranges with a covered firing point are usually concrete or tarmacadam. Outdoor military range firing points are not usually covered and may have other configurations, e.g., sloping, a gravel base or hole in the ground.

A &quot;fixed firing point&quot; or echelon rifle range is where the targets are located at the various distances with the marksman or woman shooting from the one firing point. The most advanced rifle range of this design was constructed for the Commonwealth Games New Delhi 2010.

The firing point cover can be as simple as a tent, to a frame with only a roof (to keep off rain or sunshine) to a substantial building with appropriate apertures to shoot through.

=== Targets ===

Civilian targets are usually made of paper or a plastic coreflute, sometimes with a canvas or hessian back on the larger long-range types. Most competitive targets are a solid black circle on a white background. The black circle may have scoring rings. Targets of other shapes may be used such as used in pistol (hand gun) target shooting. Reactive targets allow shooters to easily identify bullet strikes. This allows shooters to improve their skills by quickly being able to compare their aiming point and where the actual bullet impacted the target.

Electronic scoring targets use an acoustic or optical system to evaluate the shot as it passes through the target frame.

Service rifle competitions typically use the military-standard targets contemporary to the firearm&#x27;s era. The same applies for the matches they shoot.

Other target types include a metal plate that is knocked over by the projectile such as in the air rifle sport of field target or handgun discipline of IPSC, and stationary metal plates of scaled animal outlines on which bullet strikes mark as well as those that mark the paint which is painted over again after scoring.

===Butts / backstop===

The butts or backstop is the area behind the target into which the shot impacts having passed through the target. Earth, sand, or rubber berms are common, particularly on outdoor ranges. Vertical or angled steel plates with collectors are common indoors, often with a ballistic rubber curtain through which the bullet passes and is then stopped by a metal plate. The rubber curtains help reduce ricochet or bounce-back of bullet fragments.

Ranges without automatic target placements sometimes have galleries or trenches from where personnel lift and retract, mark and replace targets.

Backstops need to be of sufficient height to capture the projectile intended for the target as well as any ricochet that may occur from the projectile striking the range floor. The height is determined by range distance, as well as the approved firearms - a range for unsupported or pistol shooting may require a larger backstop than a range exclusively used or prone or supported rifle where a greater level of accuracy is expected.

===Wind flags===
Outdoor shooting ranges sometimes have wind flags, positioned between the firing line (where the shooters are) and the targets. Shooters observe these flags to make an estimate of wind speed, which is then converted into lateral minute of angle point of aim corrections or, alternatively, windage holdoff corrections.

The flag method is the most common method used to estimate wind speed. A flag blowing in the wind will naturally blow away from the flagpole, with the angle of the bottom of the flag to the flagpole increasing with increasing windspeed. To estimate the wind speed in mph, the angle in degrees between the bottom of the flag to the flagpole at the mid-range position between the shooter and the target is divided by 4. For example, an angle of 60 degrees between the bottom of a flag and a flagpole would be estimated as a windspeed.

The clock method is then used to determine full value, half value, or no value corrections in a minute of angle for this wind. Aligning the target at the 12 o&#x27;clock position or direction, with the 6 o&#x27;clock direction being directly behind the shooter, winds at 3 or 9 o&#x27;clock are equated to full value, winds at 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 o&#x27;clock are equated to half value, and winds at 12 and 6 o&#x27;clock are equated to no value.
The minute of angle correction (full value) is then commonly estimated as ((Range [meters] / 100) × Wind [mph]) / &quot;C&quot;, where &quot;C&quot; is a constant. The constant &quot;C&quot; equals 15 for ranges from 100 to 500 meters, 14 for 600 meters, 13 for 700–800 meters, 12 for 900 meters, and 11 for 1,000 meters.
For full-value winds, this full windage correction is used. For half-value winds, the minute of correction in windage given by this formula is halved; for no-value winds, no minute of angle correction in windage is required.

Multiple flags are required for two reasons. First, the wind speed closest to the midpoint of the range has the greatest effect on the projectile. In addition, the wind at one part of the range will not always be the same at another part.

Wind flags are not always actual flags, sometimes streamers are used, small triangle flags, or even pinwheels. Factors such as the range length and expected strength of the wind determine the best type of flag to use. When no flags are available, a small leaf or another small light object can be dropped from shoulder height, and the object is then pointed at by the shooter; the angle between his arm and his torso can provide an equivalent wind speed estimation as a wind flag, although it will not be at the mid-range location along the bullet&#x27;s trajectory.

=== Lighting ===
Lighting should be consistent in intensity, glare-free, and shadow-free. The shooter&#x27;s vision down range should not be obstructed by lighting behind the firing line. The illumination should be bright enough to prevent pupil dilation, which lowers the shooter&#x27;s visual acuity. Emergency lights for egress, &quot;Range in Use&quot; signs at the entrance, and exit lights are among the other lighting options. During repairs or cleaning, the lighting behind the bullet trap should be at least 30 foot-candles.

==Common safety practices==
Although some ranges require all weapons to be discharged, securely encased, and/or trigger-locked before entering or exiting the facility, others do not. Many jurisdictions have no such restrictions, regardless of whether one has a concealed carry license in jurisdictions where concealed carry is legal.

Whether indoors or outdoors, all shooters are typically required to wear eye protection as well as hearing protection (ear muffs or earplugs) at all times when within the defined boundaries of the range. Employees and users are exposed to lead dust from bullets or cartridge primers, which can be inhaled or can settle on skin or clothing. Additionally, the discharging of firearms in indoor ranges can produce noise levels of over 140 dB sound pressure level. To combat this, it is commonly recommended that those inside the range &quot;double-up&quot; ear protection by using both earplugs and over-the-head earmuffs, and to protect range bystanders from sound exposure. Depending on the range, prescription eyeglasses may qualify as eye protection. Indoor ranges can be particularly unsafe, due to high lead exposures and increased noise exposures where the design or management is not of a quality conducive to best practice.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health issued an Alert, that presents five case reports documenting lead and noise exposures, and examines firing range operations, exposure assessment and control methods, existing regulations, and exposure standards and guidelines. More information about reducing occupational exposures at indoor firing ranges can be found at NIOSH Firing Range topic page

In 2013, The American National Academy of Sciences published a report highlighting the shortcomings of current occupational lead exposure standards and urged the United States Department of Defense to update its guidelines and practices for protecting workers from lead exposure on firing ranges.

=== Air ===

Lead and other pollutants are regulated by ventilation in a range. The configuration of the supply and exhaust air systems is critical for proper operation. Interlocks that enable both the supply and exhaust fans to be working should be designed to ensure proper operation. The range&#x27;s exhaust system eliminates dirty air.
The air velocity down the range is determined by the exhaust flow rate, but it has no bearing on the airflow pattern at the firing line. A minor negative pressure in the range can be maintained by exhausting 3 to 7% more air than is supplied. The negative pressure of -0.04 + 0.02 inches water gauge should be maintained for ranges. Energy recovery systems should be considered because of the huge amount of air being exhausted. Single-speed fans, not multiple-speed fans, should be used. To demonstrate proper exhaust system function, indicators (static or velocity pressure) for flow monitoring are a good idea. 

Outside air must make up for the lost airflow. The distribution of supply air is crucial in assessing the ventilation system&#x27;s effectiveness.
Air supply systems are designed to spread air equally over the firing range&#x27;s distance. Airflow at the shooting line can be unstable if it is not uniformly dispersed, allowing lead and other pollutants to be brought back into the shooter&#x27;s breathing region. Supply air should be added as high as possible in the range.

=== Cleaning ===
Due to the health risks of accumulated lead dust and combustion products, cleaning floors and horizontal surfaces on a regular basis is recommended, either explicitly or as an implementation of more general health and safety regulations for handling lead. The level of cleaning is determined by how often the range is used. Wet methods or a vacuum fitted with a high-performance particulate air (HEPA) filter may be used to clean. The risk of unburned powder accumulating necessitates the use of an explosion-proof HEPA vacuum.

During cleanup, the ventilation system should be turned on. Personnel and shooters should be aware of the areas of the range to which they are permitted entry, as well as the areas where their clothing or skin may become contaminated. Shooters should not be permitted to proceed beyond the firing line. Individuals who might need to walk down the range should have disposable shoe coverings accessible. Before consuming food, drinks, or other products, shooters should thoroughly wash their hands and face.

=== Safety Areas ===

In practical shooting sports, a Safety Area is a bay where shooters can handle unloaded firearms without the supervision of a range officer. Safety areas are used in dynamic shooting sport disciplines (e.g. IPSC, PPC 1500, Steel Challenge). They may be used to pack, unpack or holster firearms, cleaning or repair, dry fire or train with empty magazines.

The Safety Area will have a designated safe direction in which shooters can point the muzzle of their firearm.

The handling of ammunition is expressly prohibited within the safety area, including any dummy rounds. Outside the safety area ammunition can be handled freely to load magazines, but firearms may only be handled under the direct supervision of a Range Officer. This strict separation of firearms and ammunition prevents accidental or negligent discharges.

====Other uses of &quot;Safety Area&quot;====
The phrase &quot;safety area&quot; is generic and can have different meanings in other shooting sport disciplines, or defined in local range standing orders.

Of note is the US Military concept of a Small Arms Range Safety Area (SARSA). SARSAs are areas established to contain small arms activity that could be hazardous to non-participating aircraft. They define dates, boundaries and altitudes to be coordinated with local air traffic control.

<text>The tamarins are squirrel-sized New World monkeys from the family Callitrichidae in the genus Saguinus. They are the first offshoot in the Callitrichidae tree, and therefore are the sister group of a clade formed by the lion tamarins, Goeldi&#x27;s monkeys and marmosets.

==Taxonomy and evolutionary history==
Hershkovitz (1977) recognised ten species in the genus &quot;Saguinus&quot;, further divided into 33 morphotypes based on facial pelage. A later classification into two clades was based on variations in dental measurements. A taxonomic review (Rylands et al., 2016) showed the tamarins are a sister group to all other callitrichids, branching off 15–13 million years ago. Within this clade, six species groups are historically recognised, &quot;nigricollis&quot;, &quot;mystax&quot;, &quot;midas&quot;, &quot;inustus&quot;, &quot;bicolor&quot; and &quot;oedipus&quot;, five of which were shown to be valid with &quot;Sanguinus inustus&quot; placed within the &quot;midas&quot; group. The review noted that the smaller-bodied &quot;nigricollis&quot; group began diverging 11–8 million years ago, leading the authors to move them to a separate genus, &quot;Leontocebus&quot; (saddle-back tamarins). While a 2018 study proposed that &quot;Leontocebus&quot; does not have sufficient divergence from &quot;Saguinus&quot; to be in its own genus, and thus should be reclassified it as a subgenus of &quot;Saguinus&quot;, this proposal has since found significant traction. The same study found the &quot;mystax&quot; group of tamarins to be distinct enough to be classified in the subgenus &quot;Tamarinus.&quot; As of 2021 this proposal has not been universally accepted by primatologists.

===Taxonomic classification===
Following the taxonomic review of tamarins by Rylands et al. (2016) and Garbino &amp; Martins-Junior (2018), there are 22 species in the genus &quot;Saguinus&quot; with 19 subspecies.

== Description ==

Tamarin species vary considerably in appearance, ranging from nearly all black through mixtures of black, brown and white. Mustache-like facial hairs are typical for many species. Their body size ranges from (plus a tail). They weigh from . In captivity, red-bellied tamarins have been recorded living up to 20.5 years, while cotton-top tamarins can live up to 23 years old.

== Distribution ==
Tamarins range from southern Central America through central South America, where they are found in northwestern Colombia, the Amazon basin, and the Guianas.

== Behavior and reproduction ==
Tamarins are inhabitants of tropical rainforests and open forest areas. They are diurnal and arboreal, and run and jump quickly through the trees. Tamarins live together in groups of up to 40 members consisting of one or more families. More frequently, though, groups are composed of just three to nine members.

Tamarins are omnivores, eating fruits and other plant parts as well as spiders, insects, small vertebrates and bird eggs.

Gestation is typically 140 days, and births are normally twins. The adult males, subadults, and juveniles in the group assist with caring for the young, bringing them to their mother to nurse. After approximately one month the young begin to eat solid food, although they are not fully weaned for another two to three months. They reach full maturity in their second year. Tamarins are almost exclusively polyandrous.

Cottontop tamarins (&quot;Saguinus oedipus&quot;) breed cooperatively in the wild. Cronin, Kurian, and Snowdon tested eight cottontop tamarins in a series of cooperative pulling experiments. Two monkeys were put on opposite sides of a transparent apparatus containing food. Only if both monkeys pulled a handle on their side of the apparatus towards themselves at the same time would food drop down for them to obtain. The results showed that tamarins pulled the handles at a lower rate when alone with the apparatus than when in the presence of a partner. Cronin, Kurian, and Snowdon concluded from this that cottontop tamarins have a good understanding of cooperation. They suggest that cottontop tamarins have developed cooperative behaviour as a cognitive adaptation.

In some locations, saddle-back tamarins (subgenus &quot;Leontocebus&quot;) live sympatrically with tamarins of the subgenus &quot;Sanguinus&quot;, but the saddle-back tamarins typically occupy lower strata of the forest than do the &quot;Sanguinus&quot; species. Saddle-back tamarins have longer and narrower hands than &quot;Sanguinus&quot; species, possibly adaption to differing foraging behavior, as saddle-back tamarins are more likely to search for insects that are hidden in knotholes, crevices, bromeliad tanks and leaf litter, while &quot;Sanguinus&quot; species are more likely to forage for insects that are exposed on surfaces such as leaves or branches. This differentiation in lifestyles was why both were formerly considered different genera.

==Predators==
While tamarins spend much of their day foraging, they must be on high alert for aerial and terrestrial predators. Due to their small size compared to other primates, they are an easy target for predatory birds, snakes, and mammals.

<text>eXeem was a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing client using the BitTorrent protocol. eXeem was designed to replace the need for centralized trackers (servers which co-ordinate the transfer of metadata across a BitTorrent network). It largely failed to achieve this goal, and the project was canceled and eXeem&#x27;s network was shut down by the end of 2005.

eXeem was written in C++ using the open source libtorrent library for its BitTorrent functionality.

== Overview ==
eXeem was created by Swarm Systems Inc. which is located in Saint Kitts and Nevis. The company employed Andrej Preston, the founder of Suprnova.org, as its spokesperson and public face of eXeem. Five thousand Suprnova.org users were selected to take part in a private beta test of eXeem before the public beta was released on January 21, 2005.

eXeem&#x27;s developers expected to implement the following features:
* On-the-fly encryption and decryption
* Searching by file hash
* Quality of service features
* Proper Universal Plug and Play-support
* User comments &amp; ratings, but only when the file has been downloaded (to prevent fake ratings)
* Minimum limited upload rate (5 kB/s) to stop leechers.

== Criticism of eXeem ==
Criticism of eXeem arose soon after it debuted and included:
* eXeem&#x27;s for-profit operating model, including support through advertising (much akin to Kazaa) and a public beta that included HTML ads supported by Cydoor, which is widely considered to be spyware. Ads-free versions called &quot;eXeem Lite&quot; and &quot;BIT eXeem&quot; were subsequently released, and eXeem later replaced Cydoor with WhenU from version 0.21 onward.
* Closed source code development, in contrast with the open-source model followed by the most popular BitTorrent software, on which eXeem is based.
* No initial Linux or Macintosh versions, with no ability to allow third parties to port the code beyond Windows (as eXeem is closed source).
* Seacay was released as a Linux Client for the eXeem network when eXeem version 0.21 was released (see screenshot, right )

== Network ==

The eXeem network used super-peers that were used to track torrents (as ordinary BitTorrent trackers). These super-peers were also responsible for maintaining file lists, comments and ratings for part of the files in the network. When a peer that was tracking a torrent was closed or went down, a new peer was assigned to be the tracker for that particular torrent.
