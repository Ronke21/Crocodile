<text>The Ignatz Awards recognize outstanding achievements in comics and cartooning by small press creators or creator-owned projects published by larger publishers. They have been awarded each year at the Small Press Expo since 1997, only skipping a year in 2001 due to the show&#x27;s cancellation after the September 11 attacks. SPX has been held in either Bethesda, North Bethesda, or Silver Spring, Maryland.

The Ignatz Awards are named in honour of George Herriman and his strip &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, which featured a brick-throwing mouse named Ignatz.

== Awards criteria ==
As one of the few festival awards rewarded in comics, the Ignatz Awards are voted on by attendees of the annual Small Press Expo (SPX, or The Expo, its corporate name), a weekend convention and tradeshow showcasing creator-owned comics. Nominations for the Ignatz Awards are made by a five-member jury panel consisting of comic book professionals.

The jury panel remains anonymous (from both the public as well as each other) until the announcement of the awards. After a 1999 controversy involving juror Frank Cho, jurors are now prohibited from nominating their own work. However, there is no prohibition of one jury member&#x27;s work being nominated for an award by his or her fellow jurors.

== History ==
The first comics industry awards given the title &quot;Ignatz&quot; originated at the OrlandoCon, held in Orlando, Florida, from 1974 to 1994. The current Ignatz Awards are not connected with OrlandoCon. The SPX Ignatz Awards were conceived in 1996 by SPX organizer Chris Oarr and cartoonist Ed Brubaker. Their original mandate, to set the Ignatz apart from &quot;mainstream&quot; awards like the Eisner Awards, was that the work nominated be creator-owned, and focus more on work done by a single writer/artist.

The Award was administered by Jeff Alexander from 1998 to 2006, when they were taken over by Greg McElhatton. During his tenure as Ignatz Award Coordinator, Alexander drew a strip for the annual award program in George Herriman&#x27;s style.

<text>The Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway, originally called the Burlington Bay Skyway and simply known as the Burlington Skyway or The Skyway, is a pair of high-level freeway bridges (built in 1958 and 1985) spanning the Burlington Bay Canal. The Skyway, as it is locally known, is located in Hamilton and Burlington, Ontario, Canada, and is part of the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) highway linking Fort Erie with Toronto. The 1958 steel bridge is a suspended deck through-arch truss bridge. The approach to the main span has elements of a through-truss bridge, but the arch shape takes the truss higher than the roadway deck, so hangers are used to suspend the deck from the arch truss. The truss bridge is long overall. The main span of is flanked by two back spans each long; there are 72 total approach spans, and the bridge has of vertical clearance below the bottom of the deck. The girder bridge, completed in 1985, is shorter. The roadway deck for each bridge is 30 m (97 ft) wide.
==History==

The first bridge (steel structure) officially opened on October 30, 1958, crossing the narrow bar separating Hamilton Harbour and the Port of Hamilton from Lake Ontario. This allows for Great Lakes ship traffic to flow underneath while four lanes of Golden Horseshoe road traffic may flow on top of it, neither disturbing the other. The bridge was designed by John Turner Bell. Construction of the entire Skyway required of steel and of concrete.

The bridge had tolls when constructed, but these were removed December 28, 1973 after they were found to heavily impede traffic flow. The toll plaza was located near Tower&#x27;s Drive. Truck drivers in particular had refused to take the tolled bridge since not only were they charged the full toll but also it took them extra fuel to ascend the Skyway. With the lifting of tolls on the bridge, trucks were then banned from using Beach Boulevard.

When traffic volume became more than the bridge could accommodate in the early 1980s, the bridge was twinned. The 1985 bridge was a conventional precast concrete box girder. When the new skyway (concrete structure) was opened on October 11, 1985, traffic was temporarily rerouted to it so that the old bridge could be extensively rehabilitated and this work was completed August 22, 1988. Afterwards, there were eight lanes of traffic crossing the harbour.

The twinning project also saw a major upgrade of the freeway approaches to the bridge. The entire project resulted in the QEW being widened to eight lanes from Burlington Street to Highway 403, with modern Parclo interchanges at Burlington Street, Northshore Boulevard (former Highway 2), and Fairview Street/Plains Road. This section has a variable lighting system to overcome the frequent fog found in the area. It is also the site of Ontario&#x27;s first freeway traffic management system which incorporates traffic cameras and changeable message signs.

The original name of the first bridge was the &quot;Burlington Bay Skyway&quot;. After it was twinned, the proposed names of &quot;James N. Allan Skyway&quot; (in honour of the Ontario Minister of Highways James Noble Allan, who had championed the 1958 bridge) and &quot;James N. Allan Burlington Bay Skyway&quot; were rejected. The official name since 1988 has been &quot;Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway&quot;.

In fall 2008, most of the older Aluminum Tapered Leg (ATL) overhead sign gantries (commonly referred by the MTO as a &quot;Type 1&quot; structure) which had been installed back in the late 1980s were replaced with the newer triangular truss gantries. This included the overhead gantry signage for exit 97 on the northbound span of the skyway.

On July 31, 2014, a man driving a dump truck in its raised position crashed onto the top of the bridge frame on the Toronto-bound lanes. The bridge was closed for the weekend to make temporary repairs; permanent repairs to the bridge structure took seven months and cost $1.224 million. The driver was charged with impaired driving and tried in 2016, resulting in a conviction for dangerous driving in March 2016 and a one-year jail sentence. His conviction and sentence were upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal.

<text>jMonkeyEngine (abbreviated JME or jME) is an open-source and cross-platform game engine for developing 3D games written in Java. It can be used to write games for Windows, Linux, macOS, Raspberry Pi, Android, and iOS (currently in alpha testing). It uses Lightweight Java Game Library as its default renderer, and also supports another renderer based on Java OpenGL.

jMonkeyEngine is community-centric and open-source. It is released under the New BSD license. It is used by several commercial game studios and educational institutions. The default jMonkeyEngine 3 comes integrated with a software development kit (SDK).

==jMonkeyEngine 3 SDK==
By itself, jMonkeyEngine is a collection of computing libraries, making it a low-level game development tool. Coupled with an integrated development environment like the official jMonkeyEngine 3 SDK, it becomes a higher-level game development environment with multiple graphical components. 

The SDK is based on the NetBeans Platform, enabling graphical editors and plugin capabilities. Alongside the default NetBeans update centers, the SDK has its own plugin repository and a selection between stable point releases or nightly updates. 

Since March 5th, 2016, the SDK is no longer officially supported by the core team. It is still being actively maintained by the community. The term &quot;jMonkeyPlatform&quot; is also used interchangeably with &quot;jMonkeyEngine 3 SDK.&quot;

==History==
jMonkeyEngine helps to improve the lack of full featured graphics engines written in Java. The project has evolved over time.

===jMonkeyEngine 0.1 – 2.0===
Version 0.1 to 2.0 of jMonkeyEngine marks the time from when the project was first established in 2003, until the last 2.0 version was released in 2008. When the original core developers gradually discontinued work on the project throughout the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, Version 2.0 had not yet been made officially stable. The code-base became adopted for commercial use and was most popular with the engine&#x27;s community at the time.



===jMonkeyEngine 3.0===
Since the departure of jME&#x27;s core developers in late 2008, the codebase remained practically stagnant for several months. The community continued to commit patches, but the project was not moving in any clear direction. Development on Version 3.0 started as an experiment. 

The first preview release of jME3 in early 2009 drew positive attention from many members in the community, and the majority agreed that this new branch would be the official successor to jME 2.0. From there on, all the formalities were sorted out between the previous core developers and the new.

==Ardor3D fork==
Ardor3D began life on September 23, 2008, as a fork from jMonkeyEngine by Joshua Slack and Rikard Herlitz due to what they perceived as irreconcilable issues with naming, provenance, licensing, and community structure in that engine, as well as a desire to back a powerful open-source Java engine with organized corporate support. 

The first public release came January 2, 2009, with new releases following every few months thereafter. In 2011, Ardor3D was used in the Mars Curiosity mission both by NASA Ames and NASA JPL for visualizing terrain and rover movement. 

On March 11, 2014, Joshua Slack announced that the project would be abandoned, although the software itself would remain under zlib license and continue to be freely available. However, a subset of Ardor3D called &quot;JogAmp&#x27;s Ardor3D Continuation&quot; was still actively maintained by Julien Gouesse as of 2014.

<doc id="1250775" wikidata="Q917711" url="?curid=1250775" title="Khovanshchina">
<text>Khovanshchina (, sometimes rendered The Khovansky Affair) is an opera (subtitled a &#x27;national music drama&#x27;) in five acts by Modest Mussorgsky. The work was written between 1872 and 1880 in St. Petersburg, Russia. The composer wrote the libretto based on historical sources. The opera was almost finished in piano score when the composer died in 1881, but the orchestration was almost entirely lacking.

Like Mussorgsky&#x27;s earlier &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; deals with an episode in Russian history, first brought to the composer&#x27;s attention by his friend the critic Vladimir Stasov. It concerns the rebellion of Prince Ivan Khovansky, the Old Believers, and the Muscovite Streltsy against the regent Sofia Alekseyevna and the two young Tsars Peter the Great and Ivan V, who were attempting to institute Westernizing reforms in Russia. Khovansky had helped to foment the Moscow Uprising of 1682, which resulted in Sofia becoming regent on behalf of her younger brother Ivan and half-brother Peter, who were crowned joint Tsars. In the fall of 1682 Prince Ivan Khovansky turned against Sofia. Supported by the Old Believers and the Streltsy, Khovansky – who supposedly wanted to install himself as the new regent – demanded the reversal of Patriarch Nikon&#x27;s reforms. Sofia and her court were forced to flee Moscow. Eventually, Sofia managed to suppress the so-called Khovanshchina (Khovansky affair) with the help of the diplomat Fyodor Shaklovity, who succeeded Khovansky as leader of the Muscovite Streltsy. With the rebellion crushed, the Old Believers committed mass suicide (in the opera, at least).

Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov completed, revised, and orchestrated &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; in 1881–1882. In 1958 Dmitri Shostakovich was commissioned to revise and reorchestrate the opera for a film version released the following year. It is the Shostakovich version which is now usually performed. In 1913 Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel made their own arrangement at Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s request. When Feodor Chaliapin refused to sing the part of Dosifey in any other orchestration than Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s, Diaghilev&#x27;s company employed a mixture of orchestrations which did not prove successful. The Stravinsky-Ravel orchestration was forgotten, except for Stravinsky&#x27;s finale, which is still sometimes used.

Although the background of the opera comprises the Moscow Uprising of 1682 and the Khovansky affair a few months later, its main themes are the struggle between progressive and reactionary political factions during the minority of Tsar Peter the Great and the passing of old Muscovy before Peter&#x27;s westernizing reforms. It received its first performance in the Rimsky-Korsakov edition in 1886.

==History==

===Compositional history===

The libretto was written out by 1879, and shows some inconsistencies with the actual text set to music. The above table is based on those of Richard Taruskin (in &quot;Musorgsky: Eight Essays and an Epilogue&quot;) and (in the preface to his edition of the vocal score).

===Performance history===
The St. Petersburg and world premiere took place on 21 February (9 February O.S.), 1886 using the Rimsky-Korsakov edition. Also in St. Petersburg on 27 October 1893 the opera was presented by artists of the Russian Opera Society.

The Russian Private Opera presented the Moscow premiere at the Solodovnikov Theater on 12 November 1897 conducted by Michele Esposito, with scene designs by Konstantin Korovin, Apollinary Vasnetsov, and Sergey Malyutin. There were 1910 and 1911 productions in the two cities, the first by the Zimin Opera in Moscow and conducted by Palitsīn scenes by Matorin, while the second was at St. Petersburg&#x27;s Mariinsky Theatre and conducted by Albert Coates.
&quot;Khovanshchina&quot; reached the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris in 1913, where Emil Cooper (Kuper) conducted a Diaghilev production, in a new orchestration written collaboratively by Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel. Because Feodor Chaliapin was unwilling to sing Dosifei in any orchestration other than Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s, the Parisians heard a hybrid version which proved unsuccessful, and this orchestration was forgotten. Only the finale, which was composed by Stravinsky, has survived and was published in 1914. It occasionally replaces Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s finale in some productions, such as Claudio Abbado&#x27;s 1989 production in Vienna.

Also in 1913, it was presented in London at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane. It was produced in New York for the first time in 1931.

The Shostakovich version, in Pavel Lamm&#x27;s edition, was first presented on 25 November 1960 at the Kirov Theater, conducted by Sergey Yeltsin with sets designed by Fedorovsky.

&quot;Khovanshchina&quot; was not staged by New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera until 1950, although excerpts were performed by the Met as early as 1919. The 1950 production was sung in English and featured Risë Stevens as Marfa, Lawrence Tibbett as Prince Ivan and Jerome Hines as Dosifei. The sets and costumes were designed by the Russo-Lithuanian artist Mstislav Dobuzhinsky. That production received only four performances in 1950, and the Met did not stage &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; again until 1985, this time in Russian.

The new production was staged by August Everding, designed by Ming Cho Lee, and used the Shostakovich orchestration, with Martti Talvela as Dosifei and Natalia Rom as Emma. It has since been revived several times at the Met, most recently in a 2012 run, during which Stravinsky&#x27;s final scene was employed there for the first time. Performances of &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; by visiting Russian companies have also appeared at the Met. More recently, it was performed by Welsh National Opera in both Wales and England as well as at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich under Kent Nagano in 2007.

&quot;Khovanshchina&quot; is not seen on stage often outside Russia, but it has been recorded complete 23 times, including seven videos.
==Roles==
Mussorgsky refers to Marfa as a contralto in a letter to Vladimir Stasov on 16 January 1876. Varsonofyev&#x27;s part is written in the bass clef in his act 2 appearance, as expected for a bass or baritone; but it is written in the treble clef (presumably meant to sound an octave lower) in his act 4 appearance, as expected for a tenor.

==Historical basis of the plot==
The death of the young Tsar Fyodor III has left Russia with a crisis of succession. Supported by Prince Ivan Khovansky, Fyodor&#x27;s sickly brother Ivan, who is 16, and his half-brother Peter, who is only 10, have been installed as joint rulers, with their older sister Sofia acting as regent. Sofia has allied herself with Prince Vasily Golitsin, a powerful courtier and liberal politician, who is also her alleged lover.

Due to regulations applicable at the time of the composition of the opera in Imperial Russia, it was forbidden to portray members of the Romanov dynasty on stage, so Mussorgsky had recourse to a series of symbols and indirect mention of main characters in the plot. Sofia, Ivan and Peter never actually appear on stage.
The principal theme of &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; is stated outright in the choral number &quot;Akh, ty Rodnaya, Matushka Rus&#x27;&quot; in act 1 (&quot;Woe to thee, native, Mother Russia&quot;), which laments that Russia is bleeding and dying not because of a foreign enemy, but because of fragmentation within. Something like a three-way civil war is in progress, which basically compresses twelve years of Russian history into one telling. The Tsarist court is modernizing, and two powerful forces are resisting these changes: the Streltsy and the Old Believers. The &quot;Streltsy&quot; are decommissioned elite soldiers/guards (&quot;Streltsy&quot; literally means &quot;shooters&quot;, just like &quot;musketeers&quot;), past their prime and on indefinite furlough. They are fanatically loyal to Prince Ivan Khovansky. The &quot;Old Believers&quot; are Russian Orthodox Christians who have left the state-sponsored church because they disagree with the Patriarch Nikon&#x27;s reforms; they also challenge the line of succession to the throne and have refused to recognize the Russian Patriarch. Their leader is Dosifey. Fortunately for Czar Peter, these two factions despise each other, as the Streltsy are rowdy degenerates and the Old Believers are pious ascetics. Each of the three principal basses in the opera believes himself to represent the &quot;true&quot; Russia against her internal enemies: Prince Ivan Khovansky claims legitimacy by noble birth and military prowess, Dosifey by religion, and Shaklovity by supporting Czar Peter.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Time&quot;: The year 1682&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Place&quot;: Moscow

In some performances and recordings of the opera some segments are deleted, depending on the interpretation of the original notes, which are described in [&quot;brackets&quot;].

===Act 1===
&quot;Moscow, Red Square&quot;

In the morning in the Red Square, a member of the Streltsy (named Kuzka) sings his drunkenness off while two other Streltsy talk about their rowdy activities the night before. A scribe arrives; they all pick on him and then leave. Shaklovity, a Boyar and agent for the regent and the Tsars, enters and dictates a letter to the court, warning of a rebellion planned by Prince Ivan Khovansky (captain of the &quot;Streltsy&quot; Guards) and the Old Believers. After finishing the letter he warns the scribe not to repeat what he heard. The scribe, terrified by the prospect of being involved in a political intrigue, signs the letter with a false name. [&quot;The crowd enters and they force the scribe to read a new proclamation that has been published in the public square, which describes the atrocities committed by the Streltsy. The crowd laments the state of Russia.&quot;] Prince Ivan Khovansky enters promising an adoring crowd that he will defend the &quot;young Tsars&quot; (Ivan V and Peter I). He and the crowd exit.

Prince Andrey, Khovansky&#x27;s son, chases in Emma, a German girl, intending to assault her. Marfa, an Old Believer and Andrey&#x27;s former fiancée, interferes. Andrey threatens to kill Marfa, but Prince Ivan returns and decides to capture Emma himself. The ensuing quarrel between father and son is interrupted by the arrival of Dosifey, the leader of the Old Believers. Dosifey berates everyone for being so quarrelsome and un-Christian, and asks them all to join the Old Believers in reuniting Russia. Prince Ivan Khovansky leaves with Prince Andrey Khovansky. Marfa leaves with Emma. Dosifey, left alone, prays for the future of Russia.

===Act 2===
&quot;Summer study of Prince Vasily Golitsin&quot;

Golitsin, a nervous progressive nobleman, reads letters from his lover [&quot;and his mother, who warns him to keep himself pure&quot;]. [&quot;A German Lutheran pastor enters to complain of the murder of one of the scribes in his community by the Streltsy and Prince Andrey Khovansky&#x27;s pursuit of Emma. Prince Golitsin tries to appease the pastor and offers some form of political advantage that the pastor promises to collect later, although Golitsin flatly refuses to let him build another church; then the Prince wonders about the true motives behind the pastor&#x27;s actions&quot;]. The Prince hires Marfa to tell his fortune in secret. She predicts that he will fall from power and face exile; he dismisses her and orders his servant to kill her. Once alone he ponders on all the acts that he has made to advance Russia, but is interrupted when Prince Ivan Khovansky enters without being announced. (Ivan is ironically disrespecting Golitsin, who himself reformed the tradition of announcing noble visitors.) Prince Khovansky complains that Golitsin has been interfering with his friends in the nobility and diminishing the privileges of nobility, and states that only Tartars believe that all men are equal, and questions whether Russia shall become &quot;tartarized&quot;. A quarrel ensues, [&quot;each making insulting remarks about the other&#x27;s military campaigns&quot;,] but Dosifey enters and draws their attention away from their argument by criticising both of them: Golitsin for his modern views, and Prince Ivan for letting the Streltsy get drunk and run around making trouble all the time. [&quot;In the discussion with Dosifey it turns out that he was once Prince Myshetsky who renounced all worldly matters, to which Prince Ivan Khovansky says that a Prince must die a Prince&quot;.] Marfa comes back, there has been an attempt on her life but she was saved by the Petrovtsy (the Tsar&#x27;s personal army). After her enters Shaklovity, who menacingly announces that the Tsar has been warned of the planned rebellion and has issued orders to arrest the Princes Khovansky. Without resolving the drama, the act ends.

===Act 3===
&quot;The Streltsy Quarter, south of the Moscow River&quot;

As Old Believers chant a hymn for the future of Russia, Marfa sings of her lost love for Prince Andrey Khovansky. [&quot;Susanna, a fellow Old Believer, scolds Marfa until Dosifey appears and drives Susanna away.&quot;] Marfa admits to Dosifey that she still loves Prince Andrey Khovansky. Dosifey tells her to pray for relief. They exit and Shaklovity, who until now had been presented as a purely threatening character, sings a haunting prayer for troubled Russia&#x27;s protection from the Streltsy (he refers to them as &quot;mercenaries&quot;) and from the rebellious powers they obey. Hearing them coming he exits; some of the Streltsy enter and sing a drinking chorus followed by their wives who scold them about their drinking. [&quot;The soldiers ask Kuzka to help them with their wives; he ends up organizing an entire celebration with all the Streltsy and their women.&quot;] The scribe arrives and informs them that Tsar Peter&#x27;s troops have initiated an attack on Streltsy-Russian soldiers. The Streltsy call their leader, Prince Ivan Khovansky, who enters and begs their forgiveness for declining to lead them into retaliation; the new Tsar is very powerful, he explains, and their time of power is over.

===Act 4===
&quot;Scene 1: A richly furnished chamber in Prince Ivan Khovansky&#x27;s palace&quot;

Prince Ivan Khovansky is being entertained by the women in his retinue but they are interrupted by a servant of Golitsin (Varsonofyev) who has come to warn him that he is in danger. Prince Ivan Khovansky ignores the warning and has the messenger flogged. He orders his Persian slaves to dance for him. Shaklovity enters and stabs Khovansky to death. Shaklovity scornfully imitates the servants&#x27; song over the Prince&#x27;s corpse.

&quot;Scene 2: Moscow. The square before the Cathedral of Vasiliy the Blessed&quot;

Prince Golitsin is led into exile. Dosifey mourns the conspirators&#x27; downfall and the success of Tsar Peter and learns that the Imperial Council has decreed that the Old Believers are next. He discusses with Marfa that an everlasting example must be set by the Old Believers and agree that they shall immolate themselves. Prince Andrey Khovansky enters and confronts Marfa about where she hid Emma, but Marfa tells him that she is safely on her way back to Germany, her father and fiancé. Prince Andrey Khovansky threatens that he will have her burnt as a witch and calls for the Streltsy with his horn but instead a menacing sound is heard. Marfa offers sanctuary to Prince Andrey Khovansky with the Old Believers after she tells him of his father&#x27;s murder. The Streltsy are led to their execution. Tsar Peter, through an agent, intervenes to pardon them.

===Act 5===

&quot;A pine forest, a secluded monastery, a moonlit night&quot;

Dosifey and his followers have taken refuge in a hermitage in the forest. Although he is weighed down by the sorrows and sufferings of the brethren, he remains defiant and determined to win a &quot;crown of glory&quot; in fire and flame (&quot;Here, in this holy place&quot;). He exhorts the brethren to don white clothing and light candles, preparing for immolation. They enter the hermitage. Prince Andrey Khovansky enters, singing of his lost love, still seeking Emma. Marfa sings to him, reminding him of their own love, and assuring him that she will not leave him. Dosifey and the brethren return, dressed in white and carrying candles. They build a funeral pyre. Offstage trumpet calls herald the approach of Tsar Peter&#x27;s soldiers. Marfa sings to Andrey of the hopelessness of their situation. The trumpet calls sound again. Dosifey exhorts the brethren to remain strong one last time. Marfa lights the pyre. The schismatics sing a final hymn (&quot;God will save me&quot;) as Dosifey, Marfa, Prince Andrey Khovansky and the Old Believers perish in the flames. [&quot;Tsar Peter&#x27;s Preobrazhensky soldiers arrive in a vain attempt to capture them.&quot;] [Shostakovich version only: &quot;As the flames die away, the moon rises over the forest and the crowd from Moscow enters, reprising their act 1 lament for the state of Russia.&quot;]

Mussorgsky&#x27;s original vocal score remained unfinished. The final portion of the libretto must be reconstructed from Mussorgsky&#x27;s themes. The Rimsky-Korsakov edition (1883) adds to the final hymn figures representing flames, trumpet fanfares, and a final reprise of the &quot;March of the Preobrazhensky Regiment&quot; that concludes act 4. The Stravinsky version of the finale (1913) follows Mussorgsky&#x27;s notes more closely in that the ending fades away. The Shostakovich version attempts to provide a musical conclusion of the opera by bringing back the theme of the sunrise from the Prelude to the opera.

<doc id="1250776" wikidata="Q3940116" url="?curid=1250776" title="Roger Williams University">
<text>Roger Williams University (RWU) is a private university in Bristol, Rhode Island, United States. Founded in 1956, it was named for theologian and Rhode Island cofounder Roger Williams. The school enrolled approximately 4,400 undergraduate and graduate students and employs over 480 academic staff as of 2022.

==History==
The university’s operations date to 1919, when Northeastern University in Boston opened a branch campus in the YMCA building in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1940, the YMCA board of directors began directing the school, and the YMCA Institute granted its first associate&#x27;s degrees in 1948. In 1956, the institute received a state charter to become a two-year, degree-granting institution under the name of Roger Williams Junior College.

During the 1960s, the school began granting bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and in 1967 subsequently adopted the name Roger Williams College. Needing a larger campus, the college purchased of waterfront land and moved its main campus to Bristol in 1969. In 1989 new president Dr. Natale A. Sicuro initiated the Roger Williams Plan for the 1990s, and became concurrently the president of the newly established Roger Williams University School of Law and, in 1992, led the change to Roger Williams University. RWU celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006.

Ioannis Miaoulis was appointed the eleventh president of Roger Williams University in 2019. Miaoulis previously served as both the president and director of the Boston Museum of Science since 2003.

In 2012, Roger Williams University initiated a tuition freeze in which all entering freshmen would have a guarantee that their tuition would not increase for the next four years. In 2019, the university terminated this policy.

On September 21, 2017, music icons The Beach Boys were honored by Roger Williams University and music historians Al Gomes and Connie Watrous of Big Noise. Plaques were unveiled at the university&#x27;s Baypoint Inn &amp; Conference Center in Portsmouth, Rhode Island to commemorate the band&#x27;s concert there on September 22, 1971. The 1971 concert was the first-ever appearance of South African Ricky Fataar as an official member of the band and Filipino Billy Hinsche as a touring member, essentially changing The Beach Boys&#x27; live and recording act&#x27;s line-up into a multi-cultural group. Diversity is a credo of Roger Williams University, which is why the school chose to celebrate this moment in the band&#x27;s history.

==Academics==
Roger Williams University enrolls approximately 4,100 undergraduate and 300 graduate students in eight schools. These schools offer more than 50 liberal arts majors and professional degrees, such as law, architecture, construction management, historic preservation, and computer science. The university has a student to faculty ratio of 14:1 while almost half of the classes offered have less than 20 students.

The largest majors are business, management, and marketing (24%); architecture (10%); security, law enforcement, and related protective services (9%); communication and journalism (8%); psychology (7%) and construction management (6%).

Roger Williams University has several degree programs that are unusual in the United States:
* Marine Biology program: offers a B.S. in Marine Biology, which is one of about fifteen in the country.

<doc id="1250777" wikidata="Q1074719" url="?curid=1250777" title="Chiricahua National Monument">
<text>Chiricahua National Monument is a unit of the National Park System located in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona. The monument was established on April 18, 1924, to protect its extensive hoodoos and balancing rocks. The Faraway Ranch, which was owned at one time by Swedish immigrants Neil and Emma Erickson, is also preserved within the monument.

Just over 85% of the monument is protected as the Chiricahua National Monument Wilderness.

==Geology==
Located approximately southeast of Willcox, Arizona, the monument preserves the remains of an immense volcanic eruption that shook the region about 27 million years ago. The thick, white-hot ash spewed forth from the nearby Turkey Creek Caldera, cooled and hardened into rhyolitic tuff, laying down almost of highly siliceous, dark volcanic ash and pumice. The volcanic material eventually eroded into the natural rock formations of the present monument.

== History ==
President Calvin Coolidge established the national monument with the Antiquities Act on April 18, 1924. It was expanded by President Franklin Roosevelt on June 10, 1938.

=== Missing naturalist ===
On January 13, 1980, Paul Fugate, a National Park Service naturalist and law enforcement ranger, disappeared after leaving the monument headquarters while in uniform, to check trails leading to the recently acquired Faraway Ranch. An acquaintance claimed to have seen him later that afternoon, slumped between two men in a pickup truck. Despite an extensive search of the rugged monument area by authorities and search and rescue teams, no trace of him has been found.

=== Historic Designed Landscape ===

Chiricahua National Monument Historic Designed Landscape is a historic district that covers roughly 80% of the national monument. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 31, 2008.

It was the 18th property listed as a featured property of the week in a program of the National Park Service that began in July 2008.

=== Proposed redesignation ===
In 2022, the US Senate passed S. 1320 to redesignate the monument as a national park. The bill did not make it out of committee in the House and died with the conclusion of the 117th Congress. In early 2023, Senator Mark Kelly introduced S. 736 in the Senate, while Representative Juan Ciscomani introduced HR 1479 in the House to redesignate the Monument as a Park. The 2023 bills passed out of committee in the Senate but have not passed out of committee in the House. 

== Visitor center ==

A visitor center is located from the entrance to Chiricahua National Monument. The visitor center has exhibits relating to the geology, natural history, and cultural history of the area. A park ranger is available to provide visitors with trail guides and information. The main road, Bonita Canyon Drive, ventures east through the park, ending at Massai Point. Approximately of trails lead hikers through various ecosystems of meadows, forests, and rock formations.

The visitor center has a free shuttle that leaves each morning at 9:00 am. The shuttle takes hikers to the Echo Canyon or Massai Point trailheads. Hikers return to the visitor center by following the designated trails.

== Gallery ==

==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Chiricahua National Monument has a hot-summer mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded at Chiricahua National Monument was on July 13, 1909, while the coldest temperature recorded was on January 7, 1913.

<doc id="1250779" wikidata="Q25790" url="?curid=1250779" title="Glycation">
<text>Glycation (non-enzymatic glycosylation) is the covalent attachment of a sugar to a protein, lipid or nucleic acid molecule. Typical sugars that participate in glycation are glucose, fructose, and their derivatives. Glycation is the non-enzymatic process responsible for many (e.g. micro and macrovascular) complications in diabetes mellitus and is implicated in some diseases and in aging. Glycation end products are believed to play a causative role in the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus.

In contrast with glycation, glycosylation is the enzyme-mediated ATP-dependent attachment of sugars to a protein or lipid. Glycosylation occurs at defined sites on the target molecule. It is a common form of post-translational modification of proteins and is required for the functioning of the mature protein.

==Biochemistry==
Glycations occur mainly in the bloodstream to a small proportion of the absorbed simple sugars: glucose, fructose, and galactose. It appears that fructose has approximately ten times the glycation activity of glucose, the primary body fuel. Glycation can occur through Amadori reactions, Schiff base reactions, and Maillard reactions; which lead to advanced glycation end products (AGEs).

==Biomedical implications==
Red blood cells have a consistent lifespan of 120 days and are accessible for measurement of glycated hemoglobin. Measurement of HbA1c—the predominant form of glycated hemoglobin—enables medium-term blood sugar control to be monitored in diabetes.

Some glycation products are implicated in many age-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (the endothelium, fibrinogen, and collagen are damaged) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (amyloid proteins are side-products of the reactions progressing to AGEs).

Long-lived cells (such as nerves and different types of brain cell), long-lasting proteins (such as crystallins of the lens and cornea), and DNA can sustain substantial glycation over time. Damage by glycation results in stiffening of the collagen in the blood vessel walls, leading to high blood pressure, especially in diabetes. Glycations also cause weakening of the collagen in the blood vessel walls, which may lead to micro- or macro-aneurysm; this may cause strokes if in the brain.

==DNA glycation==
The term DNA glycation applies to DNA damage induced by reactive carbonyls (principally methylglyoxal and glyoxal) that are present in cells as by-products of sugar metabolism. Glycation of DNA can cause mutation, breaks in DNA and cytotoxicity. Guanine in DNA is the base most susceptible to glycation. Glycated DNA, as a form of damage, appears to be as frequent as the more well studied oxidative DNA damage. A protein, designated DJ-1 (also known as PARK7), is employed in the repair of glycated DNA bases in humans, and homologs of this protein have also been identified in bacteria.

<doc id="1250780" wikidata="Q5014317" url="?curid=1250780" title="CSS Morgan">
<text>CSS Morgan was a partially armored gunboat of the Confederate States Navy in the American Civil War.

&quot;Morgan&quot; was built at Mobile, Alabama in 1861–62. She operated in the waters around Mobile from the time of her completion early in 1862 to the close of hostilities. One reference of October 1862 gave her name as &quot;Admiral&quot;.

&quot;Morgan&quot;, commanded by Commander George W. Harrison, CSN, took an active part in the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. Situated well to the right of the Confederate line of battle as the enemy proceeded up the channel, she was able to deliver a telling broadside raking fire against USS &quot;Hartford&quot; and others. Toward the end of the engagement, she was pursued by USS &quot;Metacomet&quot; but succeeded in driving her off. &quot;Morgan&quot;, attempting to avoid capture, then turned toward shallow water, grounded briefly, but continued on her perilous route and reached the guns at Fort Morgan. She dispatched a boat which effected the destruction of the Union gunboat USS &quot;Philippi&quot; below the fort. When the Union victory was apparent, Captain Harrison initially wanted to scuttle the ship, but was persuaded by his second in command, Lieutenant Thomas Locke Harrison (no relation) that she could be saved by boldly running the gauntlet up to Mobile. Although hotly pursued and shelled by cruisers for a large part of the 25-mile starlight voyage, she reached the outer obstructions near Mobile at daybreak, and that afternoon was permitted to pass through.

&quot;Morgan&quot; continued to serve in the Mobile area. In April 1865 she participated in the battle off Blakely Island in the last days of the Civil War. Blakely Island is located just off the docks of Mobile between the city and Old Spanish Fort located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. It was commanded by Captain Fry and sustained considerable damage in her final battle, but survived the war. CSS &quot;Morgan&quot; stood alone between the City of Mobile and the invading Union troops. On May 4, 1865, Commodore Ebenezer Farrand, commanding Confederate Naval Forces in the State of Alabama, ordered the surrender of &quot;Morgan&quot; to the United States Navy. She was sold the following December.

<text>The diversity of species and genes in ecological communities affects the functioning of these communities. These ecological effects of biodiversity in turn are affected by both climate change through enhanced greenhouse gases, aerosols and loss of land cover, and biological diversity, causing a rapid loss of biodiversity and extinctions of species and local populations. The current rate of extinction is sometimes considered a mass extinction, with current species extinction rates on the order of 100 to 1000 times as high as in the past.

The two main areas where the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function have been studied are the relationship between diversity and productivity, and the relationship between diversity and community stability. More biologically diverse communities appear to be more productive (in terms of biomass production) than are less diverse communities, and they appear to be more stable in the face of perturbations.

Also animals that inhabit an area may alter the surviving conditions by factors assimilated by climate.

==Definitions==
In order to understand the effects that changes in biodiversity will have on ecosystem functioning, it is important to define some terms. Biodiversity is not easily defined, but may be thought of as the number and/or evenness of genes, species, and ecosystems in a region. This definition includes genetic diversity, or the diversity of genes within a species, species diversity, or the diversity of species within a habitat or region, and ecosystem diversity, or the diversity of habitats within a region.

Two things commonly measured in relation to changes in diversity are productivity and stability. Productivity is a measure of ecosystem function. It is generally measured by taking the total aboveground biomass of all plants in an area. Many assume that it can be used as a general indicator of ecosystem function and that total resource use and other indicators of ecosystem function are correlated with productivity.

Stability is much more difficult to define, but can be generally thought of in two ways. General stability of a population is a measure that assumes stability is higher if there is less of a chance of extinction. This kind of stability is generally measured by measuring the variability of aggregate community properties, like total biomass, over time. The other definition of stability is a measure of resilience and resistance, where an ecosystem that returns quickly to an equilibrium after a perturbation or resists invasion is thought of as more stable than one that does not.

==Productivity and stability as indicators of ecosystem health==
The importance of stability in community ecology is clear. An unstable ecosystem will be more likely to lose species. Thus, if there is indeed a link between diversity and stability, it is likely that losses of diversity could feedback on themselves, causing even more losses of species. Productivity, on the other hand, has a less clear importance in community ecology. In managed areas like cropland, and in areas where animals are grown or caught, increasing productivity increases the economic success of the area and implies that the area has become more efficient, leading to possible long term resource sustainability. It is more difficult to find the importance of productivity in natural ecosystems.

Beyond the value biodiversity has in regulating and stabilizing ecosystem processes, there are direct economic consequences of losing diversity in certain ecosystems and in the world as a whole. Losing species means losing potential foods, medicines, industrial products, and tourism, all of which have a direct economic effect on peoples lives.

==Effects on community productivity==
* Complementarity Plant species coexistence is thought to be the result of niche partitioning, or differences in resource requirements among species. By complementarity, a more diverse plant community should be able to use resources more completely, and thus be more productive. Also called niche differentiation, this mechanism is a central principle in the functional group approach, which breaks species diversity down into functional components.
* Facilitation Facilitation is a mechanism whereby certain species help or allow other species to grow by modifying the environment in a way that is favorable to a co-occurring species. Plants can interact through an intermediary like nitrogen, water, temperature, space, or interactions with weeds or herbivores among others. Some examples of facilitation include large desert perennials acting as nurse plants, aiding the establishment of young neighbors of other species by alleviating water and temperature stress, and nutrient enrichment by nitrogen-fixers such as legumes.
* The Sampling Effect The sampling effect of diversity can be thought of as having a greater chance of including a species of greatest inherent productivity in a plot that is more diverse. This provides for a composition effect on productivity, rather than diversity being a direct cause. However, the sampling effect may in fact be a compilation of different effects. The sampling effect can be separated into the greater likelihood of selecting a species that is 1) adapted well to particular site conditions, or 2) of a greater inherent productivity. Additionally, one can add to the sampling effect a greater likelihood of including 3) a pair of species that highly complement each other, or 4) a certain species with a large facilitative effect on other members of the community.

===Review of data===
Field experiments to test the degree to which diversity affects community productivity have had variable results, but many long-term studies in grassland ecosystems have found that diversity does indeed enhance the productivity of ecosystems. Additionally, evidence of this relationship has also been found in grassland microcosms. The differing results between studies may partially be attributable to their reliance on samples with equal species diversities rather than species diversities that mirror those observed in the environment. A 2006 experiment utilizing a realistic variation in species composition for its grassland samples found a positive correlation between increased diversity and increased production.

However, these studies have come to different conclusions as to whether the cause was due more to diversity or to species composition. Specifically, a diversity in the functional roles of the species may be a more important quality for predicting productivity than the diversity in species number. Recent mathematical models have highlighted the importance of ecological context in unraveling this problem. Some models have indicated the importance of disturbance rates and spatial heterogeneity of the environment, others have indicated that the time since disturbance and the habitat&#x27;s carrying capacity can cause differing relationships. Each ecological context should yield not only a different relationship, but a different contribution to the relationship due to diversity and to composition. The current consensus holds at least that certain combinations of species provide increased community productivity.

===Future research===
In order to correctly identify the consequences of diversity on productivity and other ecosystem processes, many things must happen. First, it is imperative that scientists stop looking for a single relationship. It is obvious now from the models, the data, and the theory that there is no one overarching effect of diversity on productivity. Scientists must try to quantify the differences between composition effect and diversity effects, as many experiments never quantify the final realized species diversity (instead only counting numbers of species of seeds planted) and confound a sampling effect for facilitators (a compositional factor) with diversity effects.

Relative amounts of overyielding (or how much more a species grows when grown with other species than it does in monoculture) should be used rather than absolute amounts as relative overyielding can give clues as to the mechanism by which diversity is influencing productivity, however if experimental protocols are incomplete, one may be able to indicate the existence of a complementary or facilitative effect in the experiment, but not be able to recognize its cause. Experimenters should know what the goal of their experiment is, that is, whether it is meant to inform natural or managed ecosystems, as the sampling effect may only be a real effect of diversity in natural ecosystems (managed ecosystems are composed to maximize complementarity and facilitation regardless of species number). By knowing this, they should be able to choose spatial and temporal scales that are appropriate for their experiment. Lastly, to resolve the diversity-function debate, it is advisable that experiments be done with large amounts of spatial and resource heterogeneity and environmental fluctuation over time, as these types of experiments should be able to demonstrate the diversity-function relationship more easily.

==Effects on community stability==
* Averaging Effect If all species have differential responses to changes in the ecosystem over time, then the averaging of these responses will cause a more temporally stable ecosystem if more species are in the ecosystem. This effect is a statistical effect due to summing random variables.
* Negative Covariance Effect If some species do better when other species are not doing well, then when there are more species in the ecosystem, their overall variance will be lower than if there were fewer species in the system. This lower variance indicates higher stability. This effect is a consequence of competition as highly competitive species will negatively covary.
* Insurance Effect If an ecosystem contains more species then it will have a greater likelihood of having redundant stabilizing species, and it will have a greater number of species that respond to perturbations in different ways. This will enhance an ecosystem&#x27;s ability to perturbations.
* Resistance to Invasion Diverse communities may use resources more completely than simple communities because of a diversity effect for complementarity. Thus invaders may have reduced success in diverse ecosystems, or there may be a reduced likelihood that an invading species will introduce a new property or process to a diverse ecosystem.
* Resistance to Disease A decreased number of competing plant species may allow the abundances of other species to increase, facilitating the spread of diseases of those species.

===Review of temporal stability data===
Models have predicted that empirical relationships between temporal variation of community productivity and species diversity are indeed real, and that they almost have to be. Some temporal stability data can be almost completely explained by the averaging effect by constructing null models to test the data against. Competition, which causes negative covariances, only serves to strengthen these relationships.

===Review of resistance and resilience stability data===
This area is more contentious than the area of temporal stability, mostly because some have tried generalizing the findings of the temporal stability models and theory to stability in general. While the relationship between temporal variations in productivity and diversity has a mathematical cause, which will allow the relationship to be seen much more often than not, it is not the case with resistance/resilience stability. Some experimenters have seen a correlation between diversity and reduced invasibility, though many have also seen the opposite. The correlation between diversity and disease is also tenuous, though theory and data do seem to support it.

===Future research===
In order to more fully understand the effects of diversity on the temporal stability of ecosystems it is necessary to recognize that they are bound to occur. By constructing null models to test the data against (as in Doak et al. 1998) it becomes possible to find situations and ecological contexts where ecosystems become more or less stable than they should be. Finding these contexts would allow for mechanistic studies into why these ecosystems are more stable, which may allow for applications in conservation management.

More importantly more complete experiments into whether diverse ecosystems actually resist invasion and disease better than their less diverse equivalents as invasion and disease are two important factors that lead to species extinctions in the present day. In order to address these problems specifically, future work should focus on practical methods to increase the successful establishment of the poor performing but desirable species.

==Theory and preliminary effects from examining food webs==
One major problem with both the diversity-productivity and diversity-stability debates discussed up to this point is that both focus on interactions at just a single trophic level. That is, they are concerned with only one level of the food web, namely plants. Other research, unconcerned with the effects of diversity, has demonstrated strong top-down forcing of ecosystems (see keystone species). There is very little actual data available regarding the effects of different food webs, but theory helps us in this area. First, if a food web in an ecosystem has a lot of weak interactions between different species, then it should have more stable populations and the community as a whole should be more stable. If upper levels of the web are more diverse, then there will be less biomass in the lower levels and if lower levels are more diverse they will better be able to resist consumption and be more stable in the face of consumption. Also, top-down forcing should be reduced in less diverse ecosystems because of the bias for species in higher trophic levels to go extinct first. Lastly, it has recently been shown that consumers can dramatically change the biodiversity-productivity-stability relationships that are implied by plants alone. Thus, it will be important in the future to incorporate food web theory into the future study of the effects of biodiversity. In addition this complexity will need to be addressed when designing biodiversity management plans.

<text>Fort Frederica National Monument, on St. Simons Island, Georgia, preserves the archaeological remnants of a fort and town built by James Oglethorpe between 1736 and 1748 to protect the southern boundary of the British colony of Georgia from Spanish raids. About 630 British troops were stationed at the fort.

A town of up to 1,000 colonial residents had grown up outside the fort; it was laid out following principles of the Oglethorpe Plan for towns in the Georgia Colony. The town was named Frederica, after Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of King George II. The monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

==History==
In the early 18th century, Europeans called the land lying between British South Carolina and Spanish Florida the &quot;Debatable Land&quot;. Today&#x27;s state of Georgia was then the center of a centuries-old imperial conflict between Spain and Britain. After the philanthropist James Oglethorpe founded the colony of Georgia in 1733, to provide a place where poor debtors could settle, colonists from England and Scotland, and refugees from the German Electorate of the Palatinate built Fort Frederica in 1736 to defend their new territory. They named Frederica for Frederick, Prince of Wales, (1707–1751). The name was feminized to distinguish it from Fort Frederick in South Carolina.

In the 1742 battles of Bloody Marsh and Gully Hole Creek, forces under Oglethorpe successfully repulsed Spanish attempts to invade St. Simons Island. Afterward the Spanish no longer threatened the colony; in 1749 the government disbanded the garrison at Frederica. Soon the village fell into economic decline, and by 1755 it was mostly abandoned. The town survived a fire in 1758, but after a few more years, it was abandoned. Naturalist William Bartram visited the site in March, 1774. Though it was in ruins he noted that there was still a small garrison there.

Fort Frederica was documented and authorized as a National Monument on May 26, 1936, under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression. During this period, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) sponsored numerous surveys of historic areas and buildings across the country to identify, document and protect the resources for the future, as well as to provide employment.

Starting in 1947, the National Park Service and the Ft. Frederica Association, a citizens&#x27; interest group, sponsored a series of archaeological investigations at the Frederica site. Using information from 18th-century maps and journals as guides, the archaeologists excavated sections of the fort and village. By correlating the archaeological data with the historic documents and excavating remains of structures, the archaeologists have provided important insight into Frederica&#x27;s past and colonial history, a complex time of international rivalries.

As a historic area under the National Park Service, the National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Fort Frederica is open to the public and admission is free.

<text>Thorvald Eiriksson ( ; Modern Icelandic: ) was the son of Erik the Red and brother of Leif Erikson. 
The only Medieval Period source material available regarding Thorvald Eiriksson are the two &quot;Vinland sagas&quot;; the &quot;Greenland Saga&quot; and the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;. Although differing in various detail, according to both sagas Thorvald was part of an expedition for the exploration of Vinland and became the first European to die in North America outside of Greenland.

The &quot;Greenland Saga&quot; describes a voyage made by Bjarni Herjolfsson, and the subsequent voyages of Leif Eriksson, his brother Thorvald Eiriksson, his sister Freydís Eiríksdóttir, and the Icelandic merchant Thorfinn Karlsefni. The Saga describes hostilities with &quot;Skrælings&quot;, the Norse term for the native peoples they met in the lands visited south and west of Greenland which they called Vinland and Markland. The &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; tells the story as a single expedition led by Thorfinn Karlsefni. The voyage of Thorvald Eriksson is told here as part of the Karlsefni expedition.

<text>Fort Pulaski National Monument is located on Cockspur Island between Savannah and Tybee Island, Georgia. It preserves Fort Pulaski, the place where the Union Army successfully tested rifled cannons in 1862, the success of which rendered brick fortifications obsolete. The fort was also used as a prisoner-of-war camp.

The National Monument includes most of Cockspur Island (containing the fort) and all of the adjacent McQueens Island.

== Construction ==
After the War of 1812, US President James Madison ordered a new system of coastal fortifications to protect the United States from a foreign invasion. Construction of a fort to protect the port of Savannah began in 1829 under the direction of Major General Babcock and later Second Lieutenant Robert E. Lee, a recent graduate of West Point. The new fort would be on Cockspur Island, at the mouth of the Savannah River. In 1833, the facility was named Fort Pulaski in honor of Casimir Pulaski, a Polish soldier and military commander who fought during the American Revolution under the command of George Washington. Pulaski was a noted cavalryman, played a large role in training Revolutionary troops, and took part in sieges at Charleston and Savannah.

Fort Pulaski belonged to what is known as the Third System of coastal fortifications, which were characterized by greater structural durability than the earlier works. Most of the nearly 30 Third System forts built after 1816 still exist along the Atlantic and the Gulf Coasts.

Wooden pilings were sunk up to into the mud to support an estimated 25 million bricks. Fort Pulaski was finally completed in 1847, after 18 years of construction and nearly $1 million (~$ in ) in construction costs.

Walls were 11 feet thick and were thought to be impenetrable except by only the largest land artillery. The smoothbore cannon of the time had a range of only around half a mile, and the nearest land (Tybee Island) was much further away than that. It was assumed that the fort would be invincible to enemy attack. In reference to the fort&#x27;s strength, United States Chief of Engineers, General Totten, remarked that &quot;you might as well bombard the Rocky Mountains.&quot;

==Civil War==


Though completed in 1847, Fort Pulaski was under the control of only two caretakers until 1860, when South Carolina seceded from the United States and set in motion the Civil War. Georgia Governor Joseph E. Brown ordered Fort Pulaski to be taken by his state. A steamship carrying 110 men from Savannah traveled downriver, and the fort was seized by the state. After the secession of Georgia in February 1861, the state joined the Confederate States of America, and Confederate troops moved into the fort.

By December 1861, Tybee Island was thought to be too isolated and unprepared for conflict and so was abandoned by Confederate forces. This allowed Union troops to gain a foothold across the Savannah River from Fort Pulaski. Union forces, under Quincy A. Gillmore, began constructing batteries along the beaches of Tybee Island.

=== Confederate fort ===
===Siege and reduction of Fort Pulaski===

On the morning of April 10, 1862, Union forces asked for the surrender of the Fort to prevent needless loss of life. Colonel Charles H. Olmstead, commander of the Confederate garrison, rejected the offer.

Fort Pulaski was prepared for a possible infantry attack, but it never endured a direct land assault. Using 36 guns, including the new James Rifled Cannon and Parrott rifles, Union troops began the long bombardment of Fort Pulaski. The rifled projectiles could be accurately fired farther (4–5 miles) than the larger and heavier smoothbore cannonballs. Within 30 hours, the new rifled cannon had breached one of the fort&#x27;s corner walls. Shells now passed through the fort dangerously close to the main powder magazine. Reluctantly, Colonel Olmstead surrendered the fort. Only two soldiers (one Confederate and one Union) were killed in the attack. Olmstead&#x27;s decision to surrender haunted him for decades:
We were absolutely isolated beyond any possibility of help from the Confederate authorities, and I did not feel warranted in exposing the garrison to the hazard of the blowing up of our main magazine -- a danger which had just been proved well within the limits of probability... There are times when a soldier must hold his position to the last extremity, which means extermination, but this was not one of them... That the fort could and would be absolutely destroyed by the force of the enemy was a demonstrated fact... while our own power to harm them had been reduced to a minimum... I am still convinced that there was nothing else that could be done.

Gillmore succeeded almost entirely because of his rifled cannon, which caused massive damage in the walls of the fort. Gillmore&#x27;s triumph won him promotion from engineer captain to brigadier general.

===Union control===
Within six weeks of the surrender, Union forces repaired the fort, and all shipping into and out of Savannah ceased. The loss of Savannah as a viable Confederate port crippled its war effort. With the Fort securely in Union control, General David Hunter, commander of the Union garrison, issued General Order Number 7 on April 16, 1862, which stated that all enslaved at the fort and on Cockspur Island were now free. Fort Pulaski was made a final destination on the Underground Railroad, as slaves throughout the area were freed upon their arrival to Cockspur Island.

The garrison of Union soldiers reached 600 during the initial occupation, but as the war dragged on, it became clear that Southern forces would not be able to retake the fort. The garrison was later reduced to about 250. In October 1864, the fort became a prison for captured Confederate soldiers, mostly officers, known as &quot;The Immortal Six Hundred.&quot; The rations given to these men consisted of &quot;moldy bread, soured pickles, and limited water,&quot; resulting in multiple cases of &quot;starvation, dehydration, dysentery, and scurvy&quot;. As a result of these conditions, thirteen of the men would die at the fort and be buried outside of its walls. After the war ended, Fort Pulaski continued briefly as a military and political prison. It would house a Confederate Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of War, Assistant Secretary of War as well as three state governors, a senator, and the men who had commanded the fort after it had been taken by the South.
==Postwar==
Between 1869 and 1872 the demilune to the rear of the Fort was covered with powder magazines, and the few gun positions that were left were enlarged for heavier guns.

By the turn of the 20th century, the fort began to fall into disrepair. In an effort to save the old fort, the War Department finally declared Fort Pulaski a National Monument on October 15, 1924, by presidential proclamation of Calvin Coolidge. The monument was transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933. Repairs were then started, and members of the Civilian Conservation Corps arrived on Cockspur Island and began rehabilitation of the fort.

Fort Pulaski was opened to the public only for a short time before the beginning of World War II, which would see further use of Cockspur Island as a section base for the US Navy. After the war, Fort Pulaski reverted to the control of the Park Service and was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

Fort Pulaski remains open to the public, with a museum opened in the 1980s.

In November 2009, Fort Pulaski was used in the filming of Robert Redford&#x27;s movie &quot;The Conspirator&quot;, based on the conspiracy involving the assassination of US President Abraham Lincoln, most notably as the site for the gallows used to hang Mary Surratt and others.

It was used once again in filming the 2012 action comedy horror B-movie &quot;Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies&quot; for the shooting of scenes in which Lincoln confronts zombies who had overrun a Confederate stronghold.

<text>Anthony Daly (died 1820) was a native of Rahruddy, a townland west of Loughrea, County Galway, Ireland, and a member of the local Whiteboy movement. Daly was hanged on the Hill of Seefin in 1820 for allegedly attempting to assassinate local landlord James Hardiman Burke, father of explorer Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke, of St Clerans, Craughwell, County Galway, even though it was widely claimed that he was innocent.

Samuel Barber composed a significant choral work, &quot;Anthony O Daly&quot;, lamenting his death, based on a poem of retribution by Antoine Ó Raifteiri translated by James Stephens in his collection, &quot;Reincarnations&quot;.

Numerous literary references have been made to Daly, including in John Steinbeck&#x27;s short nonfiction work &quot;The Ghost of Anthony Daly&quot;.

<doc id="1250809" wikidata="Q3123184" url="?curid=1250809" title="Sweet sorghum">
<text>Sweet sorghum or sorgo is any of the many varieties of the sorghum grass whose stalks have a high sugar content. Sweet sorghum thrives better under drier and warmer conditions than many other crops and is grown primarily for forage, silage, and syrup production.

Sweet sorghum syrup is known as sorghum molasses in some regions of the United States, though in most of the U.S. the term &quot;molasses&quot; refers to a sweet syrupy byproduct of sugarcane or sugar beet sugar extraction.

==Cultivation==
Sweet sorghum has been widely cultivated in the U.S. since the 1850s for use in sweeteners, primarily in the form of sorghum syrup. In 1857 James F. C. Hyde wrote, &quot;Few subjects are of greater importance to us, as a people, than the producing of sugar; for no country in the world consumes so much as the United States, in proportion to its population.&quot; The price of sugar was rising because of decreased production in the British West Indies and more demand for confectionery and fruit preserves, and the United States was actively searching for a sugar plant that could be produced in northern states. The &quot;Chinese sugar-cane&quot; as it was called was viewed as a plant that would be productive and high-yielding in that region.

In the early 1860s, the American Civil War not only disrupted both interstate and maritime commerce but also diverted commodities from civilian to military purchases; these factors rendered some food and fiber supplies, including sugar cane and the sugar and molasses made from it, unreliable and expensive. In particular, the South was under naval blockade by the Union navy, making importation of Caribbean cane sugar and molasses expensive and scarce via blockade running. Under these conditions, some farms grew sweet sorghum for syrup to substitute for cane sugar and molasses, which helped ensconce sweet sorghum in Southern food culture. At the same time, anti-slavery families boycotting sweeteners made under slavery as &quot;blood-stained&quot; could grow sorghum and make the syrup in the North, so it was not solely a Southern foodstuff. 

By the early 1900s, the U.S. produced of sweet sorghum syrup annually. Making syrup from sorghum (as from sugar cane) is heavily labor-intensive. Following World War II, with the declining availability of farm labor, sorghum syrup production fell drastically. Currently, less than are produced annually in the U.S.

In Central India it was introduced in the early 1970s by Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute for ethanol and syrup production. Sweet sorghum syrup has shown good antioxidant properties and is found to be useful in food, beverage
and pharmaceutical industries. Presently it is grown on large area as a fodder crop.

Most sorghum grown for syrup production is grown in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Missouri, and Tennessee.

== Uses ==

Sorghum syrup and hot biscuits are a traditional breakfast in the Southern United States. Sorghum syrup is also used on pancakes, cornmeal mush, grits and other hot cereals. It can be used as a cooking ingredient with a similar sweetening effect as molasses, though blackstrap molasses still has a higher nutritional value than sorghum syrup in most regards. In India sweet sorghum syrup is promoted as a health food.

In the U.S. since the 1950s, sorghum has been raised primarily for forage and silage, with sorghum cultivation for cattle feed concentrated in the Great Plains (Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska are the leading producers), particularly in areas where insufficient rainfall and high temperature make corn production unprofitable.

Grain sorghum has also been used by the ethanol industry for quite some time because it yields about the same amount of ethanol per bushel as corn. As new-generation ethanol processes are studied and improved, sorghum&#x27;s role may continue to expand. Texas A&amp;M University ran trials to ascertain the best varieties for ethanol production from sorghum leaves and stalks in the USA.

In India and other places, sweet sorghum stalks are used for producing biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into ethanol. The crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions, as it only extracts one-seventh of the water used by sugarcane.

A 2015 study by researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers&#x27; incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide food, feed, and fuel. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million ha in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.

<text>Snorri Thorfinnsson (Old Norse and Icelandic: Snorri Þorfinnsson or Snorri Karlsefnisson; most likely born between 1004 and 1013, and died &quot;c.&quot; 1090) was the son of explorers Thorfinn Karlsefni and Gudrid Thorbjarnardóttir. He is considered to be the first child of European descent to be born in the Americas, apart from Greenland. He became an important figure in the Christianisation of Iceland.

==Name==
&quot;Snorri&quot; is an Old Norse name derived from the word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;a fight.&quot; &quot;Þorfinnsson&quot; is a patronymic, meaning &quot;son of Þorfinnr&quot;, (see &quot;Icelandic naming conventions&quot;). Snorri was named for his great-grandfather, Snorri Þórðarson, or after Snorri Þorbrandsson who was not a kinsman but a participant in Karlsefni&#x27;s expedition

== Family ==
There is speculation about the birth date of Snorri Thorfinnsson. Birth years such as 1005, 1009, and 1012 have been postulated, but all sources agree that he was born between 1004 and 1013. According to the Vinland sagas, when Snorri was 3 years old, his family left Vinland because of hostilities with indigenous peoples (called &quot;Skrælingar&quot; by the settlers, meaning &quot;barbarians&quot;). The family returned to the Glaumbær farm in Seyluhreppur.
Snorri Thorfinnsson had two children; a daughter named Hallfrid, and a son named Thorgeir. Hallfrid was the mother of Thorlak Runolfsson, bishop of Skálholt in the south of Iceland. One of the descendants of Snorri&#x27;s brother Thorbjorn, Bjorn Gilsson, was also a bishop of Hólar. Thorgeir was the father of Yngvild who was the mother of Brand Sæmundarsson, bishop of Hólar. The sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen claimed descent from Snorri Thorfinnsson in the 19th century.

==Christianisation of Iceland==
In the 13th century texts Snorri Thorfinnsson and Snorri Thorrgrimsson are considered the two main figures responsible for the early Christianisation of Iceland. Consequently, they were portrayed by various writers of the 13th and 14th century as &quot;Christian chieftain models&quot;. According to &quot;Grœnlendinga saga&quot;, Snorri had built the first church of Glaumbaer, which would later increase Christian influence in the area. His descendants became the first Bishops of Iceland, and published the first Christian Code of Iceland.

==Legacy==
*Snorri Thorfinnsson was purported to be born in Vinland (North America), making him the first European child known to be born in the Americas, provided that Greenland is defined as being outside the Americas. 
*In 2002, American archaeologists discovered the remains of a thousand-year-old longhouse located on Iceland&#x27;s northern coast. It is believed that it was Snorri Thorfinnsson&#x27;s farmhouse. The longhouse was found near the Glaumbær Folk Museum, at the Skagafjörður Heritage Museum outside the coastal village of Sauðárkrókur. The museum was once thought to have been built on the site of Snorri&#x27;s farmhouse. According to archaeologists it was &quot;a classic Germanic fortress longhouse like the Great Hall of Beowulf&quot;.

*There is a non-profit organisation called The Snorri Program that focuses on the history of Icelandic settlers in North America and regularly runs exchange programs for youth and adults.

==Genealogy==
Below is the genealogy of descendants of Snorri, as given in the close of each saga, &quot;Grœnlendinga saga&quot; ch. 9 and &quot;Eiríks saga&quot; ch. 14. It is supplemented with further ancestral information from (&quot;Eiríks saga&quot; ch. 7 and &quot;Landnámabók&quot;), a more complete family tree for which, see Thorfinn Karlsefni.

<text>Anthony Duane (–1747) was a Protestant Irish immigrant to New York who was the father of James Duane, later a congressman, Mayor of New York City, and U.S. judge.

Anthony Duane was born in County Galway c.1679 and joined the Royal Navy, becoming an officer. He first came to New York in 1698 where he met and courted Eva, the daughter of local merchant Dirck Benson. In 1702, Duane left the navy to marry Eva and settle in New York City, where he pursued a mercantile career. Before her death, they had two sons, Abraham and Cornelius.

Duane prospered and bought land for investment, rental, and future development. When Eva died, he remarried, this time to Altea Ketaltas (Hettletas), the daughter of a wealthy Dutch merchant family. The couple&#x27;s only child was James. When Altea died in 1736, Duane married a third time in 1741, to a Margaret Riken (or Rycken), the widow of Thomas Lynch of Flushing, New York.

Anthony Duane died in 1747.

<text>Fort Union National Monument is a unit of the United States National Park Service located 7.7 miles north of Watrous in Mora County, New Mexico.

The site preserves the remains of three forts that were built starting in the 1850s. Also visible at Fort Union and from the road leading to it are ruts from the Mountain and Cimarron Branches of the old Santa Fe Trail.

The monument has a visitor center containing a historical museum and showing a film about the fort’s history. A self-guiding trail leads through remains of the second and third forts. Ruins of the ordnance depot and site of the first fort are visible across the valley to the west.

The monument is open 8:00 am to 4:00 pm throughout the year except Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday of November), Christmas Day (December 25), and New Year’s Day (January 1). Admission is free.

==Description by William Davis ==
Santa Fe trader and author William Davis gave his first impression of the fort in 1857:

Fort Union, a hundred and ten miles from Santa Fé, is situated in the pleasant valley of the Moro. It is an open post, without either stockades or breastworks of any kind, and, barring the officers and soldiers who are seen about, it has much more the appearance of a quiet frontier village than that of a military station. It is laid out with broad and straight streets crossing each other at right angles. The huts are built of pine logs, obtained from the neighboring mountains, and the quarters of both officers and men wore a neat and comfortable appearance.

== History of Fort Union ==

The treaty ending the U.S.-Mexican War gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas and ceded to the United States the present-day states of California, Nevada, Utah, most of New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado, and parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Wyoming.

In New Mexico, the U.S. army set up garrisons in settlements to protect the area’s inhabitants and travel routes from raids by Native Americans, but this proved unsatisfactory. Temptations in civilian communities such as alcohol distracted soldiers and often made them unfit for duty.

In April 1851, Lt. Col. Edwin V. Sumner was ordered to revise the defense of the territory. Among his first acts was to break up the garrisons and move them closer to the Indians. He moved his headquarters and supply depot from Santa Fe to near where the Mountain and Cimarron branches of the Santa Fe Trail converged. This was about 25 miles northeast of the town of Las Vegas. There he set up Fort Union.

The first of the three forts built in this valley was begun in August 1851. For a decade it served as the base for military operations in the area and a key station on the Santa Fe Trail, affording travelers a place to rest nearby and refit at the post sutler’s store (where general merchandise not supplied to soldiers by the army was sold).  It also became the principal military supply depot of the Southwest.

During the 1850s, the fort’s mounted riflemen (called dragoons) campaigned against several southern Rocky Mountain Indian tribes that were disrupting traffic on the Santa Fe Trail. One of the first campaigns was directed against the Jicarilla Apaches. In 1854, that tribe nearly wiped out a company of dragoons. The Apaches were driven into the mountains west of the Rio Grande and routed. Military operations were also conducted against Utes of southern Colorado in 1855 and Kiowas and Comanches for raiding the plains east of the fort in 1860–61.

Anticipating a Confederate invasion of New Mexico, Col. Edward R.S. Canby, charged with the territory’s defense, concentrated troops at Fort Craig on the Rio Grande near present-day Socorro, and sent its soldiers to patrol the Santa Fe Trail, the main artery of supply for federal forces. He also ordered construction of the second Fort Union, a star-shaped earthen fortification, to strengthen defenses.

When the Civil War began in April 1861, most of the regular troops (except those officers who joined Confederate forces) were withdrawn from Fort Union and other frontier posts to be sent east. They were replaced by volunteer regiments.

The second fort at the national monument was designed to defend against a Confederate military invasion coming north up the Rio Grande Valley, from El Paso, Texas. Early in the war, such a force was turned back in 1862 by Colorado and New Mexico volunteers and U.S. regulars from Fort Union. They fought the Confederates at Glorieta Pass, about 20 miles southeast of Santa Fe. Defeated, the Confederates withdrew to Texas, ending Civil War activity in the Southwest and saving the mines in Colorado from being used as a source of funds for the South. The second Fort Union was abandoned soon afterwards.

The third fort was begun in 1863. With New Mexico securely in federal hands, the new departmental commander, Brig. Gen. James H. Carleton began its construction. The sprawling installation took six years to complete and was the most extensive in the territory. It included not only a military post, but also a separate quartermaster depot with warehouses, corrals, shops, offices, and living quarters.

The supply function overshadowed that of the military and employed far more men, mostly civilians. An ordnance depot, erected on the site of the first fort at the western edge of the valley, rounded out the complex.

Throughout the 1860s and the &#x27;70s, troops from Fort Union took part in operations against Indians. Several relentless campaigns against the Apaches, Navajos, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Kiowas, Utes, and Comanches finally brought peace to the Southern Plains in the spring of 1875 on the government&#x27;s terms.

Fort Union&#x27;s involvement in the Indian wars had come to an end, but its garrison occasionally helped to track down outlaws, quell mob violence, and mediate feuds. The supply depot continued to flourish until 1879, when the Santa Fe Railroad replaced the Santa Fe Trail as the principal means of commerce. By 1891, the fort had outlived its usefulness and was abandoned.

== Units assigned to Fort Union and Kit Carson ==
The fort served as headquarters of the 8th Cavalry in the early 1870s and as headquarters of the 9th Cavalry in the late 1870s during the Apache Wars. Christopher “Kit” Carson was commander of Fort Union from December 24, 1865, to April 24, 1866.

==Land ownership==
In its 40 years (1851–1891) as a frontier post, Fort Union had to defend itself in the courtroom, as well as on the battlefield. When the United States Army built Fort Union in the Mora Valley in 1851, the soldiers were unaware that they had encroached on private property, which was part of the Mora Land Grant. The following year, Colonel Edwin Vose Sumner expanded the fort to an area of eight square miles by claiming the site as a military reservation. In 1868, President Andrew Johnson declared a timber reservation, encompassing the entire range of the Turkey Mountains (part of the Sangre de Cristo range) and comprising an area of 53 sq mi, as part of the fort.

The claimants of the Mora Grant immediately challenged the government squatters and took the case to court. By the mid-1850s, the case reached Congress. In the next two decades, the government did not give any favorable decision to the claimants, until 1876, when the surveyor-general of New Mexico reported that Fort Union was &quot;no doubt&quot; located in the Mora Grant, but the army was unwilling to move to another place or to compensate the claimants because of the cost. The secretary of war took &quot;a prudential measure&quot;, protesting the decision of the acting commissioner of the General Land Office. He argued that the military had improved the area and should not give it up without compensation. This stalling tactic worked; the army stayed at the fort until its demise in 1891, not paying a single penny to legitimate owners.

<text>Peirce Lynch, alias Peter Lynch, fl. 1485–1486, was the first Mayor of Galway.

The son of John Lynch fitz Edmond, as well as a brother of Dominick Dubh Lynch, and a member of one of The Tribes of Galway, Peirce became the first Mayor of Galway in August 1485, being succeeded by his brother Dominck in August 1486. His grandfather, Edmond Lynch, was Sovereign of Galway in the years 1434 and 1443. Their ancestor, Thomas de Linche, was provost of Galway in 1274. Descendants of the family continued to hold office regularly up to 1654.

<text>Fossil Butte National Monument is a United States National Monument managed by the National Park Service, located west of Kemmerer, Wyoming, United States. It centers on an assemblage of Eocene Epoch (56 to 34 million years ago) animal and plant fossils associated with Fossil Lake—the smallest lake of the three great lakes which were then present in what are now Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. The other two lakes were Lake Gosiute and Lake Uinta. Fossil Butte National Monument was established as a national monument on October 23, 1972.

Fossil Butte National Monument preserves the best paleontological record of Cenozoic aquatic communities in North America and possibly the world, within the 50-million-year-old Green River Formation — the ancient lake bed. Fossils preserved include fish, alligators, bats, turtles, a dog-sized horse, insects, and many other species of plants and animals — suggest that the region was a low, subtropical, freshwater basin when the sediments accumulated, over about a 2 million-year period.

==Geologic formations==
During the Eocene this portion of Wyoming was a sub-tropical lake ecosystem. The Green River Lake System contained three ancient lakes, Fossil Lake, Lake Gosiute, and Lake Uinta. These lakes covered parts of southwest Wyoming, northeast Utah and northwestern Colorado. Fossil Butte is a remnant of the deposits from Fossil Lake. Fossil Lake was long from north to south and wide. Over the two million years that it existed, the lake varied in length and width.

Fossil Buttes National Monument contains only 13 square miles () of the 900-square-mile () ancient lake. The ancient lake sediments that form the primary fossil digs is referred to as the Green River Formation. In addition to this fossil-bearing strata, a large portion of the Wasatch Formation, river and stream sediments, is within the national monument. The Wasatch Formation represents the shoreline ecosystem around the lake and contains fossil teeth and bone fragments of Eocene mammals. Among these are early primates and horses.

==Climate==
==History==
Coal mining for the railroad led to the settlement of the nearby town of Fossil, Wyoming. When the fossils were discovered, miners dug them up to sell to collectors. In particular, Lee Craig sold fossils from 1897 to 1937. Commercial fossil collecting is not allowed within the National Monument, but numerous quarries on private land nearby continue to produce extraordinary fossil specimens, both for museums and for private collectors.

==Exhibits==

The Fossil Butte National Monument Visitor Center features over 80 fossils and fossil casts on exhibit, including fish, a crocodile, turtle, bats, birds, insects and plants. A 13-minute video is shown about the fossils found at the site and what scientists have learned. Interactive exhibits let visitors create fossil rubbings to take home, and a computer program discusses fossils, geology and the current natural history of the monument.

==Activities==
During the summer, lab personnel prepare fossils in public. Summer activities also include ranger programs, hikes, paleontology and geology talks, and participation in fossil quarry collections for the park. 

A Junior Ranger program can be completed by children aged 5–12 (with exercises scaled to the child&#x27;s age) in 3–4 hours. A highlight is hiking 3/4 mile up the butte to the dig, where interns from the Geological Society of America talk about their excavation and let children help them flake apart sedimentary deposits to discover fish fossils and coprolites.

<text>Maxwell Air Force Base , officially known as Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, is a United States Air Force (USAF) installation under the Air Education and Training Command (AETC). The installation is located in Montgomery, Alabama, United States. Occupying the site of the first Wright Flying School, it was named in honor of Second Lieutenant William C. Maxwell, a native of Atmore, Alabama.

The base is the headquarters of Air University (AU), a major component of Air Education and Training Command (AETC), and is the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s center for Joint Professional Military Education (PME). The host wing for Maxwell-Gunter is the 42d Air Base Wing (42 ABW).

The Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 908th Flying Training Wing (formerly Airlift Wing) (908 AW) is a tenant unit and the only operational flying unit at Maxwell. The 908 AW and its subordinate [703d Helicopter Squadron (703 HS)[357th Airlift Squadron]] (357 AS) operates eight C-130H Hercules aircraft for theater airlift in support of combatant commanders worldwide. As an AFRC airlift unit, the 908th is operationally gained by the Air Mobility Command (AMC).

[[Gunter Annex]] is a separate installation under the 42 ABW. Originally known as Gunter Field, it later became known as Gunter Air Force Station (Gunter AFS) when its runways were closed and its operational flying activity eliminated. It was later renamed Gunter Air Force Base (Gunter AFB) during the 1980s. As a hedge against future Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) closure actions, Gunter AFB was consolidated under Maxwell AFB in March 1992 to create a combined installation known as Maxwell/Gunter AFB.

Maxwell AFB is also the site of Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery, a minimum security facility for male inmates.

== History ==

===Origins===
Toward the end of February 1910, the Wright Brothers decided to open one of the world&#x27;s earliest flying schools at the site that would subsequently become Maxwell AFB. The Wrights taught the principles of flying, including take-offs, balancing, turns, and landings. The Wright Flying School closed on May 26, 1910.

The field served as a repair depot during World War I. In fact, the depot built the first plane made in Montgomery and exhibited it at the field on September 20, 1918. Repair activity at the depot was sharply curtailed at the end of the war.

===Interwar years===
The Aviation Repair Depot&#x27;s land was leased by the U.S. Army during World War I, and later purchased on January 11, 1920 for $34,327. Diminished postwar activity caused the U.S. War Department in 1919 to announce that it planned to close thirty-two facilities around the country, including the Aviation Repair Depot. In 1919, the Aviation Repair Depot had a $27,000 monthly civilian payroll, and was a vital part of the city&#x27;s economy. The loss of the field would have been a serious blow to the local Montgomery economy. The field remained open into the early 1920s only because the War Department was slow in closing facilities. After this initial reprieve, the War Department announced in 1922 that facilities on the original closure list would indeed close in the very near future. City officials were not surprised to hear that Aviation Repair Depot remained on the list, because 350 civilian employees had been laid off in June 1921.

On November 8, 1922, the War Department redesignated the depot as Maxwell Field in honor of Atmore, Alabama native, Second Lieutenant William C. Maxwell. On 12 August 1920, engine trouble forced Lieutenant Maxwell to attempt to land his DH-4 in a sugarcane field in the Philippines. Maneuvering to avoid a group of children playing below, he struck a flagpole hidden by the tall sugarcane and was killed instantly. On the recommendation of his former commanding officer, Major Roy C. Brown, the Montgomery Air Intermediate Depot, Montgomery, Alabama, was renamed Maxwell Field. In 1923, it was one of three U.S. Army Air Service aviation depots. Maxwell Field repaired aircraft engines in support of flying training missions such as those at Taylor Field, southeast of Montgomery.

Maxwell Field, as most Army air stations and depots developed during World War I, was on leased properties with temporary buildings being the mainstay of construction. These temporary buildings/shacks were built to last two to five years. By the mid-1920s, these dilapidated wartime buildings had become a national disgrace. Congressional investigations also showed that the manning strength of the U.S. Army&#x27;s air arm was seriously deficient. These critical situations eventually led to the Air Corps Act of 1926 and the two major programs that dramatically transformed Army airfields. The Air Corps Act changed the name and status of the Army Air Service to the U.S. Army Air Corps and authorized a five-year expansion program. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, this program and its companion, the 1926 Army Housing Program, produced well-designed, substantial, permanent buildings and infrastructure at all Army airfields retained after World War I.

Taking up the cause of Maxwell Field was freshman Congressman J. Lister Hill, a World War I veteran who served with the 17th and 71st U.S. Infantry Regiments. He, as well as other Montgomery leaders, recognized the historical significance of the Wright Brother&#x27;s first military flying school and the potential of Maxwell Field to the local economy. In 1925 Hill, a member of the House Military Affairs Committee, affixed an amendment to a military appropriations bill providing $200,000 for the construction of permanent buildings at Maxwell Field. This amendment did not have the approval of the War Department nor the Army Air Corps, but as a result of this massive spending on Maxwell Field, the War Department kept it open. Hill recognized that to keep Maxwell Field open, it needed to be fiscally or militarily valuable to the War Department.

In September 1927, Hill met with Major General Mason M. Patrick, chief of the Army Air Corps, and his assistant, Brigadier General James E. Fechet, to discuss the placement of an attack group at Maxwell Field. Both made it clear that Maxwell Field was too close to Montgomery and was not a suitable location for an attack group. In fact, they asked Hill as &quot;a friend of the Air Corps&quot; not to &quot;embarrass&quot; the Corps by asking that the group be placed there. They warned that if he persisted, they would &quot;very much oppose&quot; the effort. However, General Patrick not wanting to alienate the new and up and coming Congressman (who was also a member of the House Military Affairs Committee) sought to appease Hill by offering to create an observation squadron at Maxwell Field. Hill welcomed the gesture; however, the creation of an observation squadron fell short of the long term on-going mission sought by Hill for Maxwell Field.

Hill continued to argue for the attack group to be placed at Maxwell Field. He argued that because of the permanent buildings scheduled to be built, it would be fiscally advantageous for the placement of the attack group at Maxwell Field. Hill&#x27;s arguments were an extension of ones that had been presented to him by Major Roy S. Brown, former commandant of Maxwell Field from 1922 to 1925. In 1927, Major Brown was the commander of the Air Corps Tactical School located at Langley Field, Virginia. Major Brown urged Hill to keep his name out of it because of the easily traceable insider information. Hill, frustrated with the lack of positive response from Generals Patrick and Fechet, moved up the chain of command and passed on the correspondence he had with General Fechet to Secretary of War Dwight Davis, Assistant Secretary of War for Air F. Trubee Davison, and Army Chief of Staff Charles P. Summerall. His request to them was given the answer: that they would give the matter &quot;full consideration.&quot;

The depot&#x27;s first official flying mission was carried out after that. Observation missions originated there in 1927–1929. Pilots from the field were also involved in completing the first leg of a test designed to establish an airmail route between the Gulf Coast and the northern Great Lakes area. The successful test played a major role in the eventual establishment of permanent airmail service in the Southeast.

By early 1928, the decision of basing a new Army Air Corps attack group had come down to Shreveport, Louisiana, and Montgomery. Both cities vied for the federal money to be spent in their respective local areas, but Shreveport the more economically developed city than its counterpart Montgomery won the day. In April 1928, Hill, via his contacts in the War Department, found out that Montgomery would not be getting the attack group. Flexing his congressional muscle, Hill persuaded Assistant Secretary Davidson and now chief of the Air Corps Major General Fechet to hold off the official announcement until Montgomery had a second look by the War Department. During the interim Montgomery leaders had set forth actions to acquire over for Maxwell Field&#x27;s expansion in hopes of wooing the War Department into placing the attack group in Montgomery.

In May 1928 General Benjamin Foulois, General Fechet&#x27;s assistant, during an inspection visit with Third Army commander General Frank Parker to Maxwell Field mentioned that the Air Corps Tactical School would be moving from Langley Field to a still undecided location. During his stay General Foulois met with local Chamber of Commerce chairman Jesse Hearin and Maxwell Field post commandant, Major Walter R. Weaver. Hearin and Weaver touted the feasibility of Maxwell Field and the Montgomery area for the placement of the attack group at Maxwell Field. However, General Foulois guided the conversation towards the impending movement of the Air Corps Tactical School and he favored Maxwell Field for the new home. Hearin immediately worked up an option on another one thousand acres (4 km²) for the Air Corps Tactical School should Montgomery not be favored with the attack group.

In July 1928, word &quot;via rumor&quot; of the decision for the establishment of an attack group came out that Shreveport was indeed the victor of the final decision. In December 1928, after much debate and political maneuvering it was announced officially by the Assistant Secretary of War that Shreveport would be getting the attack group and that the Army Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) would be coming to Maxwell Field. The move to Maxwell Field from Langley Field was initially expected to increase Maxwell Field&#x27;s population by eighty officers and 300 enlisted. It was expected that the ACTS would be to the Army Air Corps what Fort Benning, Georgia was to the infantry.

On January 15, 1929, it was announced that the ACTS would be twice as large as originally planned. On February 11, it was announced that $1,644,298 had been allowed for ACTS construction. This was not including an additional $324,000 the Secretary of War had approved previously for non-commissioned officer barracks and a school building after a conference with Congressman Hill. On March 12, a conference between a Major Kennedy, Chief of Buildings and Grounds of the Army Air Corps and commandant of the ACTS, and Congressman Lister Hill to determine the locations of the buildings and types of construction. In March 1929, personnel at Maxwell provided flood relief to citizens of Montgomery. This was the first time at which food and supplies were airdropped by U.S. military forces during a major civilian emergency.

On July 9, 1929, Captain Walter J. Reed and a battery of attorneys checked titles for the land. The War Department also announced the same day that the plan had changed to where the ACTS would now be four times as large as originally planned with 200 officers and 1,000 enlisted men. At the time, this made Maxwell Field the largest (as far as personnel) Army Air Corps installation in the southeast. Approximately 300 signatures to the deed of the land occupied by the Air Corps Tactical School were signed, of which one was signed by a minor. Chairman of the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce James Hearin said, &quot;...several cases had to be taken to court.&quot; Despite the obvious rush for signatures, by October 5, deeds to the land were signed and mailed to the War Department.

On December 17, 1929, Congressman Lister Hill introduced a bill to appropriate $320,000 for the acquiring of of land in Montgomery County as a part of an expansion program for Maxwell Field. This was a particularly bold move at the time by Hill because of the stock market crash. Effects of the crash had yet to take place; however, the panic caused by the crash had certainly captured Montgomery&#x27;s attention.

On January 25, 1930, President Herbert Hoover asked Congress to re-appropriate an additional $100,000 for the main school building at Maxwell Field. President Hoover&#x27;s policy was to speed public works to offset unemployment. In February 1930, Congressman Hill&#x27;s resolution was passed in the House of Representatives and were to be added to Maxwell Field for expansion purposes. George B. Ford and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., were hired by the Army Quartermaster Corps and they designed the overall layout of ACTS at Maxwell. Ford used an approach that clustered similar functions together. This technique provided plenty of open space and gave each cluster a distinct appearance.

On September 17, 1931, the first ACTS training occurred at Maxwell Field. Forty-one students met at 8:40 a.m. in the operations office conference room for general instruction. Classes were divided into sections, with some pilots sent on check flights, while others were sent out to become familiar with the surrounding countryside to become familiar with emergency landing field locations.

On the morning of September 22, 1931, opening exercises of the Air Corps Tactical School were held. On September 24, the Air Corps Tactical School was officially launched. The address was made by Major General James E. Fechet, chief of the Army Air Corps also attending were Congressman Lister Hill and commandant of the Air Corps Tactical School, Major John F. Curry. General Fechet, along with announcing his impending retirement, declared that the forty-one student officers could be future generals of the Air Corps. At a later luncheon, General Fechet also lauded Montgomery&#x27;s attitude toward the Air Corps.

The 1931-1932 faculty included Army Air Corps (AC), Army Infantry (Inf), Army Chemical Warfare Service (CWS), and Army Field Artillery (FA) instructors. Initially, the school&#x27;s curriculum reflected the dominating influence of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. Mitchell was a strong believer in the importance of gaining and maintaining air superiority during a conflict. He argued strongly for pursuit (e.g., &quot;fighter&quot;) aircraft in combination with bombers and regarded enemy pursuit forces as the most serious threat to successful bombing operations and felt that the task of American pursuit was not necessarily to escort bombers, but to also seek out and attack enemy fighters. During the first five years of the school&#x27;s operation, Mitchell&#x27;s beliefs formed the basis for instruction at the tactical school. However, by the mid-1930s the school&#x27;s emphasis had shifted from pursuit to bombardment aviation.

On July 16, 1933, Congressman Lister Hill secured approval from the War Department for $1,650,075 for immediate spending at Maxwell Field. Hill&#x27;s request was justified by increased enrollment at the Air Corps Tactical School and the desperate need for employment for the local Montgomery population. At the start of October 1933 bids opened for four construction projects that were to start immediately; 1933-1934 construction at Maxwell Field later employed an average of more than 500 workers.

The Air Corps Tactical School opened July 15, 1931. The school evolved into the Army Air Corps (later, U.S. Air Force&#x27;s) first tactical center until the imminence of American involvement in World War II forced a suspension of classes in June 1940 that resulted in permanent closure of the school. One of the school&#x27;s notable achievements was its development of two aerial acrobatic teams: the &quot;Three Men on a Flying Trapeze&quot;, put together by then-Captain Claire L. Chennault in 1932, and the Skylarks in 1935.

=== World War II ===
In 1940, it was announced that the installation was to be converted into a pilot-training center. On 8 July 1940 the Army Air Corps redesignated its training center at Maxwell Field, Alabama as the Southeast Air Corps Training Center. The Southeast Air Corps Training Center at Maxwell handled flying training (basic, primary and advanced) at airfields in the Eastern United States.

An Air Force Pilot School (preflight) was also activated which instructed Aviation Cadets in the mechanics and physics of flight and required the cadets to pass courses in mathematics and the hard sciences. Then the cadets were taught to apply their knowledge practically by teaching them aeronautics, deflection shooting, and thinking in three dimensions. In June 1941, the Army Air Corps became the U.S. Army Air Forces. On 8 January 1943, the War Department constituted and redesignated the school as the 74th Flying Training Wing handling pre-flight training.

During following years, Maxwell was home to six different schools that trained U.S. military aviators and their support teams for wartime service. As World War II progressed, the number of required pilot trainees declined, and the Army Air Forces decided not to send more aircrew trainees to Maxwell Field. The following known sub-bases and auxiliaries were constructed to support the flying school:
* Passmore Auxiliary Field 
* Troy Auxiliary Field 
* Autaugaville Auxiliary Field 

On 31 July 1943, the Southeast Air Corps Training Center was redesignated as the Eastern Flying Training Command. Also in July, the Army Air Forces announced a specialized school for pilots of four-engine aircraft. The first B-24 Liberator landed at the field later that month and in early 1945, B-29 Superfortress bomber training replaced the B-24 program.

===Cold War===

Training at Maxwell continued until 15 December 1945, when the Eastern Flying Training Command was inactivated and was consolidated into the Central Flying Training Command at Randolph Field, Texas.

Air University, an institution providing continuing military education for Army Air Forces personnel, was established at Maxwell in 1946, prior to the U.S. Air Force becoming an independent service the following year. Today, it remains the main focus of base activities at Maxwell.

Maxwell Field was renamed Maxwell Air Force Base in September 1947 when the Air Force was created.
In 1992, the 3800th Air Base Wing (3800 ABW) was disbanded and the 502d Air Base Wing (502 BW) took over as the host wing, which two years later gave way to the current 42d Air Base Wing.

As home of the Air University, Maxwell became the postgraduate academic center of the U.S. Air Force. Air University evolved first as an institution influenced by air power as shaped in World War II, then by the Cold War under the threat of nuclear annihilation, and by air power as applied during the Cold War&#x27;s Korean and Vietnam conflicts. In the early twenty-first century, the emphasis shifted to air power&#x27;s role in confronting international and transnational terrorism by both state-sponsored and non-state actors. AU grew materially from inadequate quarters, classrooms, and instructional technology into a campus that is as modern and up-to-date as those of any other in the U. S. armed forces. Construction of Maxwell&#x27;s Academic Circle, Air University&#x27;s primary education complex, began in the 1950s. Its centerpiece was the Air University Library, eventually one of several major libraries on a military installation.

Over the years, other activities were established or relocated to Maxwell AFB, to include Headquarters, Civil Air Patrol – USAF; the Air Force Reserve&#x27;s 908th Tactical Air Support Group (908 TASG), which evolved into the present day 908th Airlift Wing; the Ira C. Eaker Center for Professional Development; the Air Force Financial Systems Operation office (SAF/FM); the Center for Aerospace Doctrine, Research and Education (CADRE); and the Air Force Historical Research Agency, a support organization and repository for air power scholars and AU students. In 1994, Air Force Officer Training School (OTS) was also relocated from Lackland AFB/Medina Annex, Texas to Maxwell AFB, joining the national headquarters of the Air Force&#x27;s other non-Academy officer accession source, Air Force ROTC.

Detachment 3 of the 58th Operations Group activated at Maxwell during January 2024 to train crews on the MH-139A Grey Wolf.

<text>Ziortza-Bolibar () is a municipality in the province of Biscay, Basque Country (Spain), in the comarca of Lea-Artibai. It has 383 inhabitants according to the 2006 census, and has an area of 18.94 km2.

The municipality was annexed in 1969 by Markina-Xemein and recovered its independence on January 1, 2005. Records indicate its existence since the 11th century.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bolibar&quot; comes from the Basque language, meaning &quot;windmill valley&quot; (&quot;bolu&quot; = &quot;windmill&quot; and &quot;ibar&quot; = &quot;valley&quot;). Ziortza/Cenarruza is derived from a local name for polygonum &quot;ziaurri&quot; (historically *&quot;zinaurri&quot;) and the suffix -tza denoting a place of abundance of something.

== Puebla de Bolívar ==
Bolívar or Bolibar (in Basque) is the urban centre of the municipality, situated along the stream with the same name, at the foot of Mount Oiz.

From 1969 to 2004 it belonged, along with the neighbourhood of Cenarruza (Ziortza in Basque), to the municipality of Markina-Xemein, until a community movement managed to merge both neighbourhoods into an independent municipality.

The last name Bolívar has its origins in this locality; Simón Bolívar de la Rementería, a colonist born in this neighbourhood, took it from Europe to the America, where his famous descendant Simón Bolívar, one of the Libertadores of America, made it famous around the world. There are a couple of statues and a museum in his honour; there was a family house in Rementería, behind the local church, but it does not exist anymore.

Other illustrious people from this small village are: Diego de Irusta, who participated in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa; the abbots of the Collegiate church of Cenarruza; Diego and Bernardino de Irusta; general Francisco de Longa, hero of the Spanish Independence War; and general Pedro de Zubiaur.

==Collegiate Church of Cenarruza==

The Collegiate Church of Cenarruza or Ziortza is located roughly two kilometers from the urban nucleus. It was an important enclave in the Route of Santiago de Compostela, and its influence extended beyond the comarca and surpassed the religious scope.

Tradition marks its founding in the 10th century. According to legend, on the day of the Assumption in the year 968 the local inhabitants held a mass in the Church of Santa Lucia de Garay, when an eagle picked up a skull from an opened tomb and dropped it in the place where the Collegiate Church is situated today. The people understood this event to be a sign and raised the religious complex in that place.

The complex consists of:
*The church, originally built in the 14th century but continually rebuilt until it obtained, in the 15th century, the Gothic style it currently has. In its interior there is a magnificent organ, one of the most ancient in Biscay, and a large group of sculptures. The portico has curious carvings in its beams, and the front door has a group of sculptures representing Jesus Christ and two musician angels.
*The cloister, built in the Renaissance period. It has a square floor-plan, and the spandrels are decorated with shells and Fleur-de-lis crosses.
*The Eastern Gate is the main entrance to the religious complex. It bears the coat-of-arms of the Múgica and Butrón families, as well as an image of the legendary eagle holding the skull in its claws.

*The Western Gate, smaller than the Eastern one but bearing the same coat-of-arms and the same image of the eagle.

There was a hospital for pilgrims that was destroyed in a fire and was subsequently rebuilt as a hostel managed by Cistercian monks and is the property of the monastery of Oliva in Navarra. There are remains of a walkway which formed part of the Santiago Route.

==Other monuments in Bolívar==

*Church of Saint Thomas, built in the 10th century and rebuilt in the 17th and 18th centuries. It has the structure of a fortress-temple, with only one nave and a rib vault, as well as two cylindrical towers. The altarpiece is neoclassical.
*The government of Venezuela erected a monument in honour of the &quot;Liberator&quot; (Simón Bolívar) in 1927, the first one in Spain.

Curry was a co-host on the television game show &quot;Ballbreakers&quot;. In 2006, she appeared on &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; as a celebrity panelist on the &quot;Match Game&quot; episode. She starred in &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot; (2004) and &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot; (2003) on UPN. Curry also appeared on &quot;Dirt&quot; starring Courteney Cox, with whom she shared scenes. She appeared in rock band&#x27;s The Click Five music video &quot;Just the Girl&quot;, along with husband Christopher Knight. Curry appeared on VH1&#x27;s celeb science fiction reality show &quot;Celebrity Paranormal Project&quot; in 2006, along with her husband, and on WE TV&#x27;s &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; that documented her trip to Russia and aired November 2007. She has also starred in the films &quot;Fallen Angels,&quot; &quot;Light Years Away&quot; and &quot;Jack Rio.&quot;

Season 3 of &quot;My Fair Brady&quot; began airing on January 21, 2008 and focused on Curry&#x27;s breast enhancement surgery and Knight&#x27;s competing (and contrary) desire to start a family. In June 2008, Curry and her family and friends appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;. Between November and December 2010, Curry worked as the &quot;Resident Celebrity Gamer&quot; panelist judge on the second series of &quot;The Tester&quot;, a reality program on the PlayStation Network. She returned to the panel for the third series which began on February 7, 2012. Curry hosted live coverage of BlizzCon for DirecTV in 2011, as well as Hosting live from E3 for Bandai Namco Entertainment in both 2011 and 2012.

==Personal life==

She married Christopher Knight in May 2006, after meeting on &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; and having their relationship documented on &quot;My Fair Brady&quot;. In 2011 the couple announced their separation and filed for divorce.

Curry announced her engagement to movie trailer-voice actor Matthew Rhode on August 5, 2017. Curry left Hollywood for good to pursue a &quot;normal rural&quot; life. Curry now runs her own lifestyle blog from her remote location. She and Rhode moved to Whitefish, Montana. They eloped in Glacier National Park in Montana on September 15, 2018.

She is of Italian descent through her maternal grandmother.

Curry was raised as a Roman Catholic, but later identified as an atheist during her marriage to Christopher Knight after they had debates over religion. As of October 2020, Curry has professed her belief in God and, although remaining irreligious, stated, &quot;I will always have a place in my heart for the Catholic Faith and their lovely Cathedrals.&quot;

In 2024 Curry announced on social media that after being a &quot;lifetime Democrat&quot; she had left the party and endorsed Donald Trump. In explaining her decision, she said, &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget when they started pushing extremist views about gender, identity, and kids... and then GASLIGHT people about it. I&#x27;ll never forget their campaign to convince Americans that being morbidly obese is healthy. I&#x27;ll never forget that they robbed Bernie twice and later RFK Jr. Of that sweet democracy they claim to be for To INSTALL Hilary &amp; Kamala. I&#x27;ll never forget all the Trump media hoaxes I debunked in 2020 by watching the full unedited videos.&quot; She added that leaving the Democratic Party was like &quot;leaving a cult.&quot;

<text>Glyn Keith Murray Mason, 2nd Baron Blackford, (29 May 1887 – 31 December 1972) was a British businessman, magistrate and Conservative politician.

==Background==
Mason was born in 1887 to Edith Mason née Affleck and William Mason (1862–1947). His father, created a baronet in 1918 and 1st Baron Blackford in 1935, was a barrister and magistrate.

==First World War==
Mason served as a colonel in the 14th Hussars, seeing action in World War I in France, Salonica and Palestine. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1916.

==Career==
At the general election in November 1922, Sir Glyn was elected unopposed as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Croydon North, then in Surrey. He kept his seat in the 1923, 1924, 1929, 1931, and 1935 general elections, facing Gilbert Foan for the Labour Party on three occasions. On 1 June 1940, Mason resigned his seat by accepting the stewardship of the Manor of Northstead.

During World War II, Mason served in the City of London Home Guard. He became a Justice of the Peace in 1946 in Somerset and succeeded his father as second Baron Blackford in 1947. He was a Lieutenant of the City of London from 1951 to 1958. Lord Blackford was a successful businessman, becoming deputy chairman of the Midland Bank, and Chairman, then Hon. President of the Guardian Assurance Company.

In the House of Lords, Lord Blackford was Deputy Speaker. In the 1950s, he was considered for the post of Chancellor of the Primrose League, a conservative-leaning political and social organisation in honour of Benjamin Disraeli. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1962.

==Family==
Mason married Grace Keen who died in 1972, with whom he had three children. His second son, Keith, succeeded him as Baron Blackford.

<text>George Washington Carver National Monument is a unit of the National Park Service in Newton County, Missouri. The national monument was founded on July 14, 1943, by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who dedicated $30,000 to the monument. It was the first national monument dedicated to an African American and first to a non-president.

The site preserves the boyhood home of George Washington Carver, as well as the 1881 Moses Carver house and the Carver cemetery. His boyhood home consists of rolling hills, woodlands, and prairies. The park has a -mile (1.2 km) nature trail, film, museum, and an interactive exhibit area for students.

The park is two miles west of Diamond along Missouri Route V and approximately ten miles southeast of Joplin.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.

<doc id="1250863" wikidata="Q55712621" url="?curid=1250863" title="Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg">
<text>The Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg are a pair of passenger trains operated by Amtrak on a route between Chicago and Quincy, Illinois. As &quot;Illinois Service&quot; trains, they are partially funded by the Illinois Department of Transportation. Between Chicago and Galesburg, Illinois, the trains share their route with the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; and &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;; the remainder of the route (Galesburg–Quincy) is served exclusively by the &quot;Illinois Zephyr/Carl Sandburg&quot;.

The &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot; is the longest continuously operated state-sponsored train, having started in November 1971. The &quot;Carl Sandburg&quot; was added as the route&#x27;s second daily round trip in 2006.

During fiscal year 2023, the &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot; and &quot;Carl Sandburg&quot; carried a combined 114,521 passengers, a 14.7% decrease over fiscal year 2022. The two trains had a total revenue of $10.5 million in fiscal year 2021, a 9.5% decrease over fiscal year 2014.

==History==

The initial train route between Quincy and Chicago first opened as a part of three independent railroads in 1855. The portion of track between Quincy and Galesburg was owned by the Northern Cross Railroad, led by Nehemiah Bushnell, and was completed in 1854. This connected with the Central Military Tract Road between Galesburg and Mendota, Illinois. At Mendota, it connected with the Chicago and Aurora Railroad to complete the route to Chicago. These three railroads eventually merged into the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.

The &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot; is a descendant of the &quot;Kansas City Zephyr&quot; and &quot;American Royal Zephyr&quot; passenger train routes operated by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad from 1953 until 1968 and 1971, respectively. The state of Illinois intervened in 1971 at the request of Quincy College (now Quincy University), Western Illinois University, and residents of western Illinois. This became part of the &quot;Illinois Service&quot; initiative in 1971 and is partially funded by the Illinois Department of Transportation. Service on the &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot; began on November 14, 1971, between Chicago and West Quincy, Missouri. The name &quot;Zephyr&quot; is preserved in the current name of the line. Today the &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot; enjoys strong support from the communities it passes through, and is one of the most successful Amtrak routes.

Service to Plano began on April 30, 1972. Service to Quincy proper began on April 24, 1983, in response to the West Quincy station being frequently cut off by flooding. The suburban stop at Aurora, was discontinued on April 28, 1985, in favor of Naperville. Passenger service was cut back to Quincy on May 1, 1994, after a major flood in 1993 destroyed the original station at West Quincy. The &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot; and the &quot;Carl Sandburg&quot; trainsets continue to cross the Mississippi River to layover at the BNSF West Quincy railyard for servicing between runs.

On October 30, 2006, a second round trip, the &quot;Carl Sandburg&quot; was added as part of the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative. The train&#x27;s name honors the famed and Pulitzer-winning writer Carl Sandburg, whose birthplace in Galesburg, Illinois lies just a few hundred feet from this train&#x27;s route. The morning westbound/evening eastbound schedule complements the opposite morning eastbound/evening westbound schedule of the &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot;.

Starting November 16, 2022, Amtrak began substituting the morning runs of the &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot; (train 380) and &quot;Carl Sandburg&quot; (train 381) with Amtrak Thruway buses due to staffing shortages at Amtrak&#x27;s Quincy crew base. The suspension lasted until January 17, 2023.

===Proposed extension===

During 2010, Amtrak contacted officials from communities in northeastern Missouri and western Illinois regarding the feasibility of extending the routes from Quincy to the Missouri cities of Hannibal and St. Louis. Without any funding, though, no formal planning or studies were done for the extension.

Plans for a Hannibal extension were revived in late 2021, when a coalition of political, business, and transportation leaders was formed. A committee will investigate potential station locations in downtown Hannibal (including the Y Men’s Pavilion), discuss surrounding mobility issues (including parking, walkability, and flooding), and work to find funding for planning and studies. The committee, which will be soliciting input from the public, held its first meeting January 2022.

The Quincy–Hannibal route appeared in the 2022 Missouri State Freight and Rail Plan as a potential long-term passenger corridor. In 2023 the Missouri Department of Transportation applied for federal funding to study the route under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

==Stops==
The entire route is in Illinois.
==Rolling stock==

A normal Amtrak &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot; or &quot;Carl Sandburg&quot; consists of:
*One Siemens SC-44 Charger locomotive
*Two to Three Amtrak Midwest Siemens Venture coaches
*One Amfleet I or Horizon fleet Cafe/Business class car

<text>Tolex is a trade name for a flexible, waterproof, vinyl material used as a cover material for books, upholstery, guitar amplifiers, cases, and other products.

Tolex was filed as a trademark on August 30, 1945 by the General Tire, and was registered as &quot;a plastic sheet and film material for book binding and case covering for speakers and amplifiers&quot;. General Tire was disconglomerated, and the trademark expired in 2005.

TOLEX is a Canadian trademark and brand of OMNOVA Solutions, Fairlawn, Ohio, now part of Synthomer.

==Usage==
It has been used in Henney-Packard hearses and ambulances of the 1950s, Fender amplifiers, the Fender Rhodes electric piano, and guitar cases from various manufacturers. Tolex was also used in Packard automobiles, hearses, and ambulances, and in marine applications, such as Chris-Craft boats and other watercraft.

Musicians sometimes use &quot;Tolex&quot; as a generic description for any vinyl type covering on an amplifier or guitar case, but most are not actually Tolex brand, except for Fender- and Rickenbacker-related products. Fender, today, uses textured vinyl, not Tolex.

<doc id="1250878" wikidata="Q2448628" url="?curid=1250878" title="Colonel Sun">
<text>Colonel Sun is a novel by Kingsley Amis published by Jonathan Cape on 28 March 1968 under the pseudonym &quot;Robert Markham&quot;. &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; is the first James Bond continuation novel published after Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1964 death. Before writing the novel, Amis wrote two other Bond related works, the literary study &quot;The James Bond Dossier&quot; and the humorous &quot;The Book of Bond&quot;. &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; centres on the fictional British Secret Service operative James Bond and his mission to track down the kidnappers of M, his superior at the Secret Service. During the mission he discovers a communist Chinese plot to cause an international incident. Bond, assisted by a Greek spy working for the Russians, finds M on a small Aegean island, rescues him and kills the two main plotters: Colonel Sun Liang-tan and a former Nazi commander, Von Richter.

Amis drew upon a holiday he had taken in the Greek islands to create a realistic Greek setting and characters. He emphasised political intrigue in the plot more than Fleming had done in the canonical Bond novels, also adding revenge to Bond&#x27;s motivations by including M&#x27;s kidnapping. Despite keeping a format and structure similar to Fleming&#x27;s Bond novels, &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; was given mixed reviews.

&quot;Colonel Sun&quot; was serialised in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper from 18 March 1968 to 30 March 1968 and adapted as a comic strip in the same newspaper in 1969–1970. Elements from the story have been used in the Eon Productions Bond series: The 1999 film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; used M&#x27;s kidnapping, whilst the villain of the 2002 film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, Colonel Tan-Sun Moon, owes his name to Colonel Sun Liang-tan.

==Plot==
Kidnappers violently take the Secret Service chief M from his house and almost capture James Bond, who is visiting. Intent on rescuing M, Bond follows the clues to Vrakonisi, one of the Aegean Islands. In the process, Bond discovers the complex military-political plans of Colonel Sun of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army. Sun had been sent to sabotage a Middle East détente conference which the Soviet Union is hosting. He intends to attack the conference venue and use M and Bond&#x27;s bodies to blame Great Britain for the disaster, leading to a world war. Bond meets Soviet agents in Athens and they realise that not only is a third country behind the kidnap, but that there is a traitor in the organisation. An attack on the Soviet headquarters kills all the agents except Ariadne Alexandrou, a Greek Communist. As he is dying, the Soviet leader encourages Bond and Ariadne to work together to prevent an international incident.

Ariadne persuades Litsas, a former Second World War resistance fighter and friend of her late father, to help them by telling him about the involvement in the plot of former Nazi, Von Richter. Trying to find M and Colonel Sun, Bond is nearly captured by the Russians, but is saved by Litsas. Finally, Bond finds Sun&#x27;s headquarters, but is knocked out by one of Sun&#x27;s men; Bond learns that Von Richter will use a mortar to destroy the conference venue and that Bond will be tortured by Sun, before his inevitable demise. Sun tortures him brutally, until one of the girls at the house is ordered by Sun to caress Bond fondly. In the process she cuts one of Bond&#x27;s hands free and provides him with a knife. She tells Sun that Bond is dead: when examined Bond stabs Sun. He then frees other captives who help Bond stop Von Richter. However Sun survives the stab wound and kills several of the other escapees. Bond tracks down Sun and kills him in the confrontation. The Soviets thank Bond for saving their conference, offering him the Order of the Red Banner for his work, which he politely turns down.

==Characters and themes==
The main character of the novel is James Bond. Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson described Amis&#x27;s Bond as a humourless interpretation of the character that Fleming used in his earlier novels. Benson describes this personality as a natural continuation of the Bond developed in the final three Fleming novels. In all three novels, the events take a toll on Bond: he loses his wife in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;; he loses his memory in Japan in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;; and he is brainwashed in Russia, is de-programmed by MI6 and almost dies from Francisco Scaramanga&#x27;s poisoned bullet in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. Benson identifies Bond&#x27;s desire for revenge as a central theme of the novel. The plot centres on Bond&#x27;s need to avenge the death of the Hammonds and M&#x27;s kidnapping. Benson describes this as particularly striking: &quot;Bond is particularly brutal in achieving his goal ... The revenge is very satisfying. This is Bond at his toughest.&quot;

Benson considered that M&#x27;s character evokes an emotional response from the reader because of the change from his usual, business-like manner to a semi-catatonic state upon being kidnapped. However, Amis envisaged something different for the character: he did not like M and, as one reviewer pointed out, in &quot;The James Bond Dossier&quot;, he had &quot;spent a chapter running him down.&quot; The main villain of the novel is Colonel Sun Liang-tan (). Sun is a member of the Special Activities Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army as well as a sadist and skilled torturer. Raymond Benson called him &quot;very worthy of inclusion in the Bond saga&quot;.

Benson notes increased political intrigue in the novel compared to earlier Bond novels. In &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;, Bond acts in concert with the Russians against the Chinese, which demonstrates one of the main themes of the book: a peacekeeping between nations. Military historian Jeremy Black describes the novel reflecting a shift in the balance of world power away from two-party Cold War politics. To accentuate this idea of Oriental threat, the novel demonstrates a disregard by the Chinese for human life, a position similar to the treatment of the East in Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Dr. No&quot;. Black also notes an emotional and social sadness throughout &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;. The social sadness is a reaction to the culture of modernity and mourning what was being lost in its place. This treatment by Amis is similar to Fleming&#x27;s nostalgia in describing Paris in &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot;.

==Background==

The original creator of James Bond, Ian Fleming, died in the early morning of 12 August 1964, eight months before the publication of &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. After his death, Glidrose Productions (now Ian Fleming Publications) held the rights to Fleming&#x27;s works. The company decided to publish two short stories, &quot;Octopussy&quot; and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, on 23 June 1966.

As the Bond character could not be copyrighted, and to retain rights in the Bond product, Glidrose decided to commission a sequel. Initially the company approached author James Leasor to write a continuation novel, but he declined. Glidrose then commissioned Amis, who wrote &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;. Critic and future novelist Sally Beauman noted that it was &quot;unusual, not to say unprecedented, for an established author to pick up the torch in this way,&quot; though she admits that &quot;Bond [is] too big, and too profitable, a property to be placed in the hands of an unknown.&quot;

Fleming&#x27;s wife, Ann, did not endorse any further Bond works and disliked Amis, saying that he would create &quot;a &quot;petit bourgeois&quot; red brick Bond&quot;. 

In 1965, Amis produced &quot;The James Bond Dossier&quot;—a critical analysis of the Bond books under his own name—and &quot;The Book of Bond&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek manual for prospective agents, using the pseudonym Lt.-Col. William (&quot;Bill&quot;) Tanner. Amis followed these books with the 1966 novel, &quot;The Anti-Death League&quot;, which had a plot filled with popular fiction elements and helped Amis prepare for &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;.

Amis and his wife Jane spent September 1965 holidaying on the Greek island of Spetses and Amis used his experiences as the background to the novel. Amis followed a tradition set by Fleming of using the names of people he knew or had met during the researches for his book and Amis drew on the names of people he met in Greece for &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;. The boat Bond uses—&quot;The Altair&quot;—was the name of the boat Amis and his wife used on holiday, whilst the Bond girl&#x27;s fictitious colleagues, &quot;Legakis&quot; and &quot;Papadogonas&quot; were friends who helped Amis in Greece, whilst the doctor who treats Bond in Chapter two was named after Amis and Jane&#x27;s own doctor.

In a 21 May 1967 letter to Philip Larkin, Amis mentioned that he had already finished writing the Bond novel.

==Release and reception==
Jonathan Cape published &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; on 28 March 1968; the book was 255 pages long and priced at a guinea. The novel sold well – journalist and author Eric Hiscock claims that by 1980 it had sold over 500,000 copies worldwide – and was listed second best seller in the &quot;Books in demand&quot; list of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; for March and April 1968. Harper &amp; Row published the novel in the US on 1 May 1968; the United States edition ran to 244 pages.

===Reviews===
&quot;Colonel Sun&quot; was broadly welcomed by the critics, although a number noted that despite Amis&#x27;s abilities as a writer, Fleming&#x27;s own persona was missing from the novel. Roger Baker, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, noted that from one angle &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; is a &quot;neat, not over-inventive thriller, low on sex, high on violence and more than usually improbable&quot;; however, he noted that once the elements of the re-incarnation of Bond and the writing of Kingsley Amis were taken into account, things were different. Baker thought that with Amis writing the story, &quot;one might, justifiably, have expected a joyous rejuvenation or at least a devastating detour from the Fleming pattern. We get neither. It is a pale copy.&quot; D. J. Enright, writing in &quot;The Listener&quot;, considered that, in literary terms, Fleming&#x27;s &quot;inheritance has been well and aptly bestowed.&quot; He said that &quot;&quot;Colonel Sun&quot; offers apt literary pabulum for Bond&#x27;s fish-and-chip culture, for his neurotics, alcoholics and suicides. Good dirty fun, once read and soon forgotten&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Simon Gray, unimpressed with the novel, called the Bond in &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; &quot;a chuckle-headed imposter whose arthritic thought processes would be a liability in a &#x27;physical tussle&#x27; down at the pub.&quot; He went on to comment that the novel only &quot;offers the frustrated Bond addict ... a small academic problem, of swiftly passing interest.&quot; The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;″s reviewer, Alexander Muir, considered the book to be &quot;an exciting, violent, sadistic and sexy piece of reading matter&quot;, although, partly because of Amis&#x27; abilities as a writer, &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; &quot;is altogether too meticulous and well written – Fleming was a hypnotic but slapdash writer. And, at times, I sensed parody. This could be fatal.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Malcolm Bradbury called the novel &quot;a reasonable read but no more: neither vintage Fleming nor vintage Amis.&quot; Bradbury also noted that &quot;it lacks a convincing rhetoric ... and the traditional Fleming frissons emerge only in muted form.&quot; Maurice Richardson, reviewing &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; for &quot;The Observer&quot;, wrote that when being judged as a thriller, the novel &quot;is vigorous, quite exciting, rather disorderly, a bit laboured&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;Some of the action is quite well done and little more preposterous than in the later Flemings. The real trouble is the absence of spontaneous &quot;élan&quot;&quot;.

The reviewer for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Charles Champlin, noted that the novel &quot;lacks the garish, outrageous, ridiculous, symbol-witted touch of the original article&quot;; despite that, he still enjoyed the novel, commenting that it left &quot;intact the reputations of both Messrs. Amis and Fleming.&quot; Donald Stanley, writing in &quot;Life&quot; magazine praised the villain Sun, saying he &quot;is the kind of villain to make a Bondophile salivate.&quot; In general Stanley praised Amis for emulating &quot;the celebrated Fleming Effect&quot;. Stanley was less convinced by Bond, observing that his &quot;essential swinishness is being replaced by some kind of dilute humanism&quot;.

The reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted the reduced numbers of gadgets employed in the book, when compared with the films, that they felt had &quot;overshadowed the personality of the secret agent&quot;; overall the reviewer felt that &quot;Mr. Amis has now given Bond back to the readers.&quot; Oberbeck commented that Bond &quot;has become a sensitive man-of-ethics who suffers pangs of doubt and remorse over the &#x27;senseless&#x27; violence of his profession&quot;. Oberbeck went on to say that Amis &quot;never quite captures the bizarre beat of a Fleming pace&quot;; most telling, according to Oberbeck, was that &quot;the greatest flaw in Amis&#x27; conception of Bond is that he has attempted to transform the consummate spy-hero into something he was never meant to have been: a man with a job&quot;.

Sally Beauman, writing for &quot;New York&quot;, believed that &quot;Amis has all the obvious ingredients for success&quot;, including &quot;an exotic troubled international setting, a beautiful girl, frequent imbibings, and even more frequent killings; and, most imperative, a villain. Yet the book drags and becomes a bore.&quot; Beauman complains that the story lacks suspense and that Bond is far too gloomy: he&#x27;s more like Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s creations than Ian Fleming&#x27;s hero. Beauman attributes the novel&#x27;s failure to the &quot;differing characters of the authors.&quot;

A fiftieth anniversary review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; called Col. Sun &quot;the most repellant racial caricature of all, a descendant of Fu Manchu and other fiendish orientals, noting that &quot;Amis channels Fleming . . . as a connoisseur of ethnicities.&quot; The review notes that &quot;Amis, by March 1968, had already made public his Damascene conversion from left to right, and signed a group letter to the Times titled Backing for US Policies in Vietnam.&quot;

For the 2002 film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, Eon Productions wanted to use the name Colonel Sun Liang-tan for the main villain, but when the Fleming estate insisted on royalties for the use of the name, they changed the name to Colonel Tan-Sun Moon.

;&quot;Spectre&quot; (2015)
The 2015 film &quot;Spectre&quot; features a torture scene which was lifted from &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;.

<text>Hesperosaurus (meaning &quot;western lizard&quot;, from Classical Greek (&#x27;) &quot;western&quot; and (&#x27;) &quot;lizard&quot;) is a herbivorous stegosaurian dinosaur from the Kimmeridgian age of the Jurassic period, approximately 156 million years ago.

Fossils of &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; have been found in the state of Wyoming and Montana in the United States of America since 1985. The type species &quot;Hesperosaurus mjosi&quot; was named in 2001. It is from an older part of the Morrison Formation, and so a little older than other Morrison stegosaurs. Several relatively complete skeletons of &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; are known. One specimen preserves the first known impression of the horn sheath of a stegosaurian back plate.

&quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; was a member of the Stegosauridae, quadrupedal plant-eaters protected by vertical bony plates and spikes. It was closely related to &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; and was similar to it in having two rows of, possibly alternating, plates on its back and four spikes on its tail end. The plates on its back were perhaps not as tall, but were longer. It possibly had a deeper skull than &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;.

==Discovery and species==
In 1985, fossil hunter Patrick McSherry, at the ranch of S.B. Smith in Johnson County, Wyoming, found the remains of a stegosaur. As he had difficulty securing the specimen due to the hard rock matrix, he sought help from Ronald G. Mjos and Jeff Parker of Western Paleontological Laboratories, Inc. They, in turn, cooperated with paleontologist Dee Hall of Brigham Young University. At first, it was assumed it represented an exemplar of &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. However, Clifford Miles, while preparing the remains, recognised that they belonged to a species new to science.

The type species &quot;Hesperosaurus mjosi&quot; was named and described in 2001 by Kenneth Carpenter, Clifford Miles, and Karen Cloward. The generic name is derived from the Greek ἕσπερος, &quot;hesperos&quot;, &quot;western&quot;, in reference to its location in the western United States. The specific name honours Mjos who, apart from his involvement in the process of collecting and preparing the holotype, also had a cast of it made, exhibited with the inventory number DMNH 29431 in the Denver Museum of Natural History.

The holotype, HMNH 001 (later HMNS 14), was found in the Windy Hill Member, stratigraphic zone 1 of the lower Morrison Formation, dating from the early Kimmeridgian, about 156 million years old. In 2001, it represented the oldest known American stegosaur. It consists of a nearly complete skull and much of the skeleton. It includes the disarticulated elements of the skull, the rear lower jaws, a hyoid, thirteen neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae, three sacrals, forty-four tail vertebrae, neck ribs, dorsal ribs, chevrons, a left shoulderblade, a complete pelvis, ossified tendons and ten neck and back plates. The skeleton was partly articulated and, in view of healed fractures, belongs to an old individual. It was obtained by the Japanese Hayashibara Museum of Natural Sciences at Okayama. In 2015, the HMNS permanently closed and the holotype was transferred to the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum, where it was renumbered FPDM-V9674
From 1995 onward at the Howe-Stephens Quarry in Big Horn County, Wyoming, named after the historic location of the Howe Ranch, once explored by Barnum Brown, and the new owner Press Stephens, Swiss palaeontologist Hans Jacob Siber excavated stegosaur specimens. The first was SMA 3074-FV01 (also SMA M04), a partial skeleton dubbed &quot;Moritz&quot; after &quot;Max und Moritz&quot; as an earlier &quot;Galeamopus&quot; sauropod skeleton from the site had been nicknamed &quot;Max&quot;. In 1996/97, specimen SMA 0018 (also mistakenly referred to as SMA V03) was uncovered, dubbed &quot;Victoria&quot; after the feeling of victory the exploring team felt when they discovered &quot;Allosaurus&quot; &quot;Big Al Two&quot; after the original &quot;Big Al&quot; had been confiscated as federal property. It represents a rather complete skeleton with skull, also preserving skin and horn sheath impressions. A third specimen was found in 2002: SMA L02, dubbed &quot;Lilly&quot; after the sisters Nicola and Rabea Lillich assisting the excavations as volunteers. The specimens are part of the collection of the &quot;Aathal Dinosaur Museum&quot; in Switzerland. At first they were considered &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; exemplars. In 2009, initially only &quot;Moritz&quot; and &quot;Lilly&quot; were reclassified as cf. &quot;Hesperosaurus mjosi&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Victoria&quot; was referred to &quot;Hesperosaurus mjosi&quot; by Nicolai Christiansen and Emanuel Tschopp.

Carpenter had originally concluded that &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; was a rather basal stegosaur. However, Susannah Maidment and colleagues in 2008 published a more extensive phylogenetic study in which it was recovered as a derived form, closely related to &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; and &quot;Wuerhosaurus&quot;. They proposed that &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; should be considered a species of &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, with &quot;Hesperosaurus mjosi&quot; becoming &quot;Stegosaurus mjosi&quot;; at the same time &quot;Wuerhosaurus&quot; was renamed into a &quot;Stegosaurus homheni&quot;. Carpenter, considering the problem more of a philosophical than a scientific nature, in 2010 rejected the synonymy of &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; with &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; stating that in his opinion &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; was sufficiently different from &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; to be named a separate genus. Christiansen in 2010 judged likewise. In 2017, Raven and Maidment recognized both &quot;Miragaia&quot; and &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; as genera distinct from &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;.

In 2015, additional specimens were reported: a concentration of at least five individuals discovered at the JRDI 5ES Quarry near Grass Range, Montana, and two individuals found in the Meilyn Quarry at Como Bluff. In 2018, new specimen of &quot;H. mjosi&quot; was described from Montana.

==Description==

&quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; was a large stegosaur, reaching in length and in body mass. Some large individuals may have reached in body mass.
In 2001 Carpenter provided a diagnosis. Due to his conclusion that &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; were rather basal, in it many comparisons were made with the basalmost known stegosaurian &quot;Huayangosaurus&quot;, that lost their relevance once it became clear that the phylogenetic position was in fact quite derived. In 2008 Maidment indicated three autapomorphies: the possession of eleven back vertebrae; the fourth sacral not being fused to the sacrum; back plates that are longer (from front to rear) than tall. Maidment also provided some traits in which &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; was more basal than &quot;Stegosaurus armatus&quot;. In the atlas, even in adult specimens the neural arches are not fused to the intercentrum. The postzygapophyses, the rear joint processes, of the rear neck vertebrae do not prominently protrude upwards. In the back vertebrae, the neural arches, above the level of the neural canal, are not especially lengthened to above. At the hip region ossified tendons are present. The ribs are expanded at their lower ends. The neural spines of the tail vertebrae are not bifurcated. The lower end of the pubic bone is expanded (spoon-shaped in side view). To Carpenter this differential diagnosis was problematic because he considered &quot;Stegosaurus armatus&quot;, the type species of &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; and rejected Maidment&#x27;s lumping of all North-American &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; material into a single species, the great variability of which making it difficult to establish any differences with &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot;. He considered &quot;Stegosaurus stenops&quot;, the name historically given to several well-preserved specimens, a separate species and provided a new differential diagnosis of &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; compared to &quot;S. stenops&quot;. The antorbital fenestra is large instead of very small. The maxilla is short and deep, half as tall as long, instead of having a height a third of the length. The basisphenoid of the lower braincase is short instead of long. Thirteen neck vertebrae are present instead of ten. Thirteen dorsal (back) vertebrae are present instead of seventeen. The middle dorsals have a basal form in possessing a low neural arch rather than a high one. The cervical ribs have expanded lower ends. In the front tail vertebrae, the tops of the neural spines are rounded instead of bifurcated. The front edge of the shoulderblade is indented instead of running parallel to the rear edge. The front blade of the ilium diverges strongly sideways instead of weakly. The rear blade of the ilium has a knob-shaped expansion at the rear end. The front end of the prepubic process has an upward expansion. The plates of the hip and tail base are oval and low instead of high and triangular.

The various published descriptions of &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; contradict each other because of changes and differences in interpretation. Originally, Carpenter reconstructed the disarticulated skull elements into a very convex head, modelling it on the shape of &quot;Huayangosaurus&quot;. The discrepancies in the vertebral count are caused by applying different criteria to the problem whether (and which) cervicodorsal vertebrae should be considered part of the neck or the back. The exact shape of the plates is hard to determine due to erosion. Paul considered the neck plates to be low, but the back plates as taller. Also the Aathal specimens are as yet undescribed. A complete description of the entire material is in preparation by Octávio Mateus.

The number of maxillary teeth were twenty per side, lower than the number with &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. Carpenter described them as similar to the teeth of &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, though somewhat larger. Peter Malcolm Galton in 2007 established some differences: there are rough vertical ridges present on the upper part of the crown, one per denticle; the fine grooves on the tooth surface are weakly developed.

===Osteoderms and skin impressions===
Carpenter in 2001 identified ten plates as part of the holotype. He described them as long and low. Asymmetrical bases would indicate that they ran in two rows. The end of the tail bore a &quot;thagomizer&quot; of two pairs of spikes, the front pair being thicker, the rear pair thinner and more horizontally directed to behind.

In 2012, an histological study concluded that these osteoderms, skin ossifications, of &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; are essentially identical in structure to those of &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. CAT-scans showed that the plates have thin but dense outer walls, filled with thick spongy bone. The bone shows signs of having been remodelled during a metaplastic growth process. Extensive long and wide arterial canals were visible. The spikes have thicker walls and the hollows in the spongy interior are smaller. A single large blood vessel ran along the longitudinal axis of the spike.

In 2010, a study was published on the soft parts visible with the &quot;Victoria&quot; specimen. It preserves both true impressions of the skin into the surrounding sediment, and natural casts, where the spaces left behind by the rotting of the soft body parts have been filled in with sediment. Additionally on some areas a black layer is present, possibly consisting of organic remains or bacterial mats. A part of the lower trunk flank shows rows of small hexagonal, non-overlapping, convex scales, two to seven millimetres in diameter. Higher on the flank two rosette structures are visible with larger central scales, one being twenty by ten millimetres in size, the other ten by eight millimetres. Apart from the scales, an impression of the lower side of a back plate has been found, covering about two hundred square centimetres. This shows no scales but a smooth surface with low parallel vertical ridges. As it is a true impression, with the life animal grooves would have been present. These grooves would have been about half a millimetre deep and stood about two millimetres apart. The impression probably represented the horn sheath of the plate, as would be confirmed by vertical traces of veins. It is the first direct proof of such sheaths with any stegosaurian. The study considered the presence of a sheath to be a strong indication that the plate had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate as a whole and provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly coloured. Thermoregulation, on the other hand — another often assumed role of the plates — would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the horn covering.

==Phylogeny== 
In 2001 Carpenter performed a cladistic analysis showing that &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; was rather basal and related to &quot;Dacentrurus&quot;:

Carpenter was aware that his analysis was limited in scope.

More extensive phylogenetic studies by Maidment recovered &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; as a very derived stegosaurid, and the sister species of &quot;Wuerhosaurus&quot;. The position of &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; in the stegosaurid evolutionary tree according to a study from 2009 is shown by this cladogram:

In a 2019 re-evaluation of dacentrurine stegosaurids, Costa and Mateus suggested that, based on their revised diagnosis for the clade Dacentrurinae, &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; appears to heave been closely related to &quot;Dacentrurus&quot; after all, though they refrained from formally reassigning it to that group pending the completion of an expanded phylogenetic analysis.

==Paleobiology==
In 2015, a study by Evan Thomas Saitta based on the finds in the JRDI 5ES Quarry concluded that &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; showed sexual dimorphism. Plates found in the quarry came in two types: a taller one, and a low broad one. Though the back plates of the various individuals were not articulated, Saitta managed to order them into cervical, dorsal and caudal series for each type. This seemed to show that some individuals had tall plates exclusively while others bore broad plates only, which was confirmed by earlier specimens also possessing plates of one kind. Saitta suggested that the tall plates typified the females, while the males were equipped with low plates. The findings of the study were questioned by palaeontologists Kevin Padian and Kenneth Carpenter although no formal scientific studies were published as a rebuttal.

<text>The Church Committee (formally the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities) was a US Senate select committee in 1975 that investigated abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Chaired by Idaho Senator Frank Church (D-ID), the committee was part of a series of investigations into intelligence abuses in 1975, dubbed the &quot;Year of Intelligence&quot;, including its House counterpart, the Pike Committee, and the presidential Rockefeller Commission. The committee&#x27;s efforts led to the establishment of the permanent US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

The most shocking revelations of the committee include Operation MKULTRA, which involved the drugging and torture of unwitting US citizens as part of human experimentation on mind control; COINTELPRO, which involved the surveillance and infiltration of American political and civil-rights organizations; Family Jewels, a CIA program to covertly assassinate foreign leaders; and Operation Mockingbird as a systematic propaganda campaign with domestic and foreign journalists operating as CIA assets and dozens of US news organizations providing cover for CIA activity, confirming earlier stories that charged that the CIA had cultivated relationships with private institutions, including the press. Without identifying individuals by name, the Church Committee stated that it found 50 journalists who had official, but secret, relationships with the CIA.

It also unearthed Project SHAMROCK, a program in which the major telecommunications companies shared their traffic with the NSA, and officially confirmed the existence of this signals intelligence agency to the public for the first time.

==Background==
By the early years of the 1970s, a series of troubling revelations had appeared in the press concerning intelligence activities. First came the revelations by Army intelligence officer Christopher Pyle in January 1970 of the US Army&#x27;s spying on the civilian population and Senator Sam Ervin&#x27;s Senate investigations produced more revelations. Then on December 22, 1974, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a lengthy article by Seymour Hersh detailing operations engaged in by the CIA over the years that had been dubbed the &quot;family jewels&quot;. Covert action programs involving assassination attempts on foreign leaders and covert attempts to subvert foreign governments were reported for the first time. In addition, the article discussed efforts by intelligence agencies to collect information on the political activities of US citizens.

The creation of the Church Committee was approved on January 27, 1975, by a vote of 82 to 4 in the Senate.

==Overview==
The Church Committee&#x27;s final report was published in April 1976 in six books. Also published were seven volumes of Church Committee hearings in the Senate.

Before the release of the final report, the committee also published an interim report titled &quot;Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders&quot;, which investigated alleged attempts to assassinate foreign leaders, including Patrice Lumumba of Zaire, Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam, Gen. René Schneider of Chile, and Fidel Castro of Cuba. President Gerald Ford urged the Senate to withhold the report from the public, but failed, and under recommendations and pressure by the committee, Ford issued Executive Order 11905 (ultimately replaced in 1981 by President Reagan&#x27;s Executive Order 12333) to ban US sanctioned assassinations of foreign leaders.

In addition, the committee produced seven case studies on covert operations, but only the one on Chile was released, titled &quot;Covert Action in Chile: 1963–1973&quot;. The rest were kept secret at CIA&#x27;s request.

According to a declassified National Security Agency history, the Church Committee also helped to uncover the NSA&#x27;s Watch List. The information for the list was compiled into the so-called &quot;Rhyming Dictionary&quot; of biographical information, which at its peak held millions of names—thousands of which were US citizens. Some prominent members of this list were Joanne Woodward, Thomas Watson, Walter Mondale, Art Buchwald, Arthur F. Burns, Gregory Peck, Otis G. Pike, Tom Wicker, Whitney Young, Howard Baker, Frank Church, David Dellinger, Ralph Abernathy, and others.

But among the most shocking revelations of the committee was the discovery of Operation SHAMROCK, in which the major telecommunications companies shared their traffic with the NSA from 1945 to the early 1970s. The information gathered in this operation fed directly into the Watch List. In 1975, the committee decided to unilaterally declassify the particulars of this operation, against the objections of President Ford&#x27;s administration.

Together, the Church Committee&#x27;s reports have been said to constitute the most extensive review of intelligence activities ever made available to the public. Much of the contents were classified, but over 50,000 pages were declassified under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.

==Committee members==


== Investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy ==
The commission also carried out an investigation into the November 22, 1963, assassination of John F. Kennedy, questioning 50 witnesses and accessing 3,000 documents. It focused on the actions of the FBI and CIA, and their support for the Warren Commission.

The Church commission raised the question of the possible connection between the plans to assassinate political leaders abroad, particularly in Cuba, and that of the 35th President of the United States.

The Church Commission questioned the processes for obtaining information, blaming federal agencies for failing in their duties and responsibilities and concluding that the investigation into the assassination had been deficient.

It participated in the creation of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), the second major investigation of the JFK assassination, from 1976 to 1979.

==Opening mail==
The Church Committee learned that, beginning in the 1950s, the CIA and Federal Bureau of Investigation had intercepted, opened and photographed more than 215,000 pieces of mail by the time the program (called &quot;HTLINGUAL&quot;) was shut down in 1973. This program was all done under the &quot;mail covers&quot; program (a mail cover is a process by which the government records—without any requirement for a warrant or for notification—all information on the outside of an envelope or package, including the name of the sender and the recipient). The Church report found that the CIA was careful about keeping the United States Postal Service from learning that government agents were opening mail. CIA agents moved mail to a private room to open the mail or in some cases opened envelopes at night after stuffing them in briefcases or in coat pockets to deceive postal officials.

==The Ford administration and the Church Committee==
On May 9, 1975, the Church Committee decided to call acting CIA director William Colby. That same day Ford&#x27;s top advisers (Henry Kissinger, Donald Rumsfeld, Philip W. Buchen, and John Marsh) drafted a recommendation that Colby be authorized to brief only rather than testify, and that he would be told to discuss only the general subject, with details of specific covert actions to be avoided except for realistic hypotheticals. But the Church Committee had full authority to call a hearing and require Colby&#x27;s testimony. Ford and his top advisers met with Colby to prepare him for the hearing. Colby testified, &quot;These last two months have placed American intelligence in danger. The almost hysterical excitement surrounding any news story mentioning CIA or referring even to a perfectly legitimate activity of CIA has raised a question whether secret intelligence operations can be conducted by the United States.&quot;

==Results of the investigation==
On August 17, 1975 Senator Frank Church appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, and discussed the NSA, without mentioning it by name:

==Aftermath==
As a result of the political pressure created by the revelations of the Church Committee and the Pike Committee investigations, President Gerald Ford issued Executive Order 11905. This executive order banned political assassinations: &quot;No employee of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination.&quot; Senator Church criticized this move on the ground that any future president could easily set aside or change this executive order by a further executive order. Further, President Jimmy Carter issued Executive Order 12036, which in some ways expanded Executive Order 11905.

In 1977, the reporter Carl Bernstein wrote an article in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, stating that the relationship between the CIA and the media was far more extensive than what the Church Committee revealed. Bernstein said that the committee had covered it up, because it would have shown &quot;embarrassing relationships in the 1950s and 1960s with some of the most powerful organizations and individuals in American journalism.&quot;

R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., editor of the conservative magazine &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, wrote that the committee &quot;betrayed CIA agents and operations.&quot; The committee had not received names, so had none to release, as confirmed by later CIA director George H. W. Bush. However, Senator Jim McClure used the allegation in the 1980 election, when Church was defeated.

The Committee&#x27;s work has more recently been criticized after the September 11 attacks, for leading to legislation reducing the ability of the CIA to gather human intelligence. In response to such criticism, the chief counsel of the committee, Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., retorted with a book co-authored by Aziz Z. Huq, denouncing the Bush administration&#x27;s use of 9/11 to make &quot;monarchist claims&quot; that are &quot;unprecedented on this side of the North Atlantic&quot;.

In September 2006, the University of Kentucky hosted a forum called &quot;Who&#x27;s Watching the Spies? Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans&quot;, bringing together two Democratic committee members, former Vice President of the United States Walter Mondale and former US Senator Walter &quot;Dee&quot; Huddleston of Kentucky, and Schwarz to discuss the committee&#x27;s work, its historical impact, and how it pertains to today&#x27;s society.

<text>John Pearson (28 February 1613 – 16 July 1686) was an English theologian and scholar. 

==Life==
He was born at Great Snoring, Norfolk.

From Eton College he passed to Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, and was elected a scholar of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge in April 1632, and a fellow in 1634. On taking orders in 1639 he was collated to the Salisbury prebend of Nether-Avon. In 1640 he was appointed chaplain to the lord-keeper Finch, by whom he was presented to the living of Thorington in Suffolk. In the Civil War he acted as chaplain to George Goring&#x27;s forces in the west. In 1654 he was made weekly preacher at St Clement&#x27;s, Eastcheap, in London.

With Peter Gunning he disputed against two Roman Catholics, John Spenser and John Lenthall, on the subject of schism, a one-sided account of which was printed in Paris by one of the Roman Catholic disputants, under the title &quot;Scisme Unmask&#x27;t&quot; (1658). Pearson also argued against the Puritan party, and was much interested in Brian Walton&#x27;s polyglot Bible. In 1659 he published in London his celebrated Exposition of the Creed, dedicated to his parishioners of St Clement&#x27;s, Eastcheap, to whom the substance of the work had been preached several years before. For example, in relation to the Christian cross, he wrote in his commentary on the Apostles&#x27; Creed that the Greek word &quot;stauros&quot; originally signified &quot;a straight standing Stake, Pale, or Palisador&quot;, but that, &quot;when other transverse or prominent parts were added in a perfect Cross, it retained still the Original Name&quot;, and he declared: &quot;The Form then of the Cross on which our Saviour suffered was not a simple, but a compounded, Figure, according to the Custom of the &quot;Romans&quot;, by whose Procurator he was condemned to die. In which there was not only a straight and erected piece of Wood fixed in the Earth, but also a transverse Beam fastned unto that towards the top thereof&quot;.

Soon after the Restoration he was presented by Juxon, Bishop of London, to the rectory of St Christopher-le-Stocks; and in 1660 he was created doctor of divinity at Cambridge, appointed a royal chaplain, prebendary of Ely, archdeacon of Surrey, and Master of Jesus College, Cambridge. In 1661 he was appointed Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professor of Divinity; and on the first day of the ensuing year he was nominated one of the commissioners for the review of the liturgy in the conference held at the Savoy. There he won the esteem of his opponents and high praise from Richard Baxter. On 14 April 1662 he was made Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1667 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society.

Upon the death of John Wilkins in 1672, Pearson was appointed bishop of Chester. He died at Chester on 16 July 1686, and is buried in Chester Cathedral.

==Theology==
According to Margaret Drabble, Pearson was one of the most erudite theologians of his age. Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Exposition of the Creed&quot;, is considered one of the best products of English dogmatic theology.

His soteriological views are discussed among scholars: Nicholas Tyacke have noted that Pearson, maintained the Arminian view of conditional election, in his &quot;Lectiones de Deo et Attributis&quot; (1660). On the other hand, Jake Griesel and Stephen Hampton have observed that Pearson upheld a Calvinist position on the doctrines of election and grace both in his &quot;Exposition&quot; (1659) and his Cambridge lectures, and did so explicitly against the Arminians or Remonstrants (&quot;contra Remonstrantes, sive eos quos Arminianos vocant&quot;). 

==Works==
In 1659 his &quot;Golden Remains&quot; of John Hales of Eton, with a memoir, was published. Also in 1659 was published his &quot;Exposition of the Creed&quot; in which the lectures which were given at the church of St Clement, Eastcheap, London, were included. (The notes are a rich mine of patristic learning.) In 1672 he published at Cambridge &quot;Vindiciae epistolarum S. Ignatii&quot;, in 4to, in answer to Jean Daillé. His defence of the authenticity of the letters of Ignatius has been confirmed by J. B. Lightfoot and other scholars. In 1682 his &quot;Annales cyprianici&quot; were published at Oxford, with John Fell&#x27;s edition of Cyprian&#x27;s works. His last work, the &quot;Two Dissertations on the Succession and Times of the First Bishops of Rome&quot;, formed with the &quot;Annales Paulini&quot; the principal part of his &quot;Opera posthuma&quot;, edited by Henry Dodwell in 1688.

See the memoir in &quot;Biographia Britannica&quot;, and another by Edward Churton, prefixed to the edition of Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Minor Theological Works&quot; (2 vols., Oxford, 1844). Churton also edited almost the whole of the theological writings.

<doc id="1250894" wikidata="Q1582672" url="?curid=1250894" title="Abhidharmakośa-bhāsya">
<text>The Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (, lit. Commentary on the Treasury of Abhidharma), Abhidharmakośa () for short (or just Kośa or AKB), is a key text on the Abhidharma written in Sanskrit by the Indian Buddhist scholar Vasubandhu in the 4th or 5th century CE. The &quot;Kośa&quot; summarizes the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma in eight chapters with a total of around 600 verses and then comments on (and often criticizes) it. This text was widely respected and used by schools of Buddhism in India, Tibet and East Asia. Over time, the &quot;Abhidharmakośa&quot; became the main source of Abhidharma and Sravakayana Buddhism for later Mahāyāna Buddhists.

In the &quot;Kośa&quot;, Vasubandhu presents various views on the Abhidharma, mainly those of the Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika, which he often criticizes from a Sautrāntika perspective. The &quot;Kośa&quot; includes an additional chapter in prose refuting the idea of the &quot;person&quot; (&quot;pudgala&quot;) favoured by some Buddhists of the Pudgalavada school.

The Vaibhāṣika master Samghabhadra considered that Vasubandhu had misrepresented numerous key points of Vaibhāṣika Abhidharma in the &quot;Kośa&quot;, and saw Vasubandhu as a Sautrāntika (upholder of the sutras). However, Vasubandhu often presents and defends the Vaibhāṣika Abhidharma position on certain topics (contra Sautrāntika). Because of this, Chinese commentators like Pu Guang do not see Vasubandhu as either a Vaibhāṣika nor as a Sautrāntika.

==Background==
The &quot;Abhidharmakośabhāṣya&quot; (AKB) is a work of Abhidharma, a field of Buddhist philosophy which mainly draws on the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma tradition. This tradition includes various groupings or &quot;schools&quot;, the two main ones being Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika. The main source for the Vaibhāṣika tradition (which was based in Kaśmīra) is the &quot;Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣa Śāstra.&quot; The other main tradition of Sarvāstivāda philosophy were those masters who were called &quot;westerners&quot; (Pāścāttya) or &quot;outsiders&quot; (Bāhyaka) and they were mainly based in Gandhara.

These masters (later known as Sautrāntikas) did not fully accept the Vaibhāṣika philosophy and compiled their own Abhidharma texts, such as the &quot;Abhidharma-hṛdaya&quot; by Dharmaśrī&quot;,&quot; which was the first Abhidharma text to provide a series of verses with prose commentary (this is the style that the &quot;Kośa&quot; follows). This work was very influential on subsequent Abhidharma texts (which imitated its style) and various commentaries were written on it. The &quot;Abhidharmakośabhāṣya&quot;&#x27;s style and structure is based on these Sautrāntika Abhidharma works.

According to K.L. Dhammajoti, in the AKB&quot;,&quot; Vasubandhu often favors the opinion of the Sautrāntika school against the Sarvāstivāda Vaibhāṣikas (when there is a dispute). For example, he criticizes the doctrine of the existence of the three times (past, present, future), a central Sarvāstivāda doctrine. However, this is not always the case and he seems to have sometimes also favored certain Vaibhāṣika doctrines (contra Sautrāntika), including the reality of certain mental factors (caittas), the notion of the conjunction () of mind () and mental factors and also the Sarvāstivāda doctrine of simultaneous causation (&quot;&quot;) which was rejected by Sautrantika masters like Śrīlāta.

== Content Overview ==
The text is divided into the following chapters.

=== 1: The Exposition on the Elements (&quot;dhātu-nirdeśa&quot;) ===
The first chapter of the work outlines the various conditioned and unconditioned factors (dharmas) that constitute sentient existence. This chapter mainly goes over the five aggregates, the sense fields, and the &quot;eighteen dhātus&quot;&quot;.&quot; It also analyses which of the elements are pure or impure. 

=== 2: The Exposition on the Faculties (&quot;indriya-nirdeśa&quot;) ===
The second chapter examines three interconnected topics, starting with the twenty-two sense faculties (indriya), which govern specific aspects of sentient life. These include the six sense faculties, the male and female sex faculties, the faculty of life force, five feeling faculties (e.g., pleasure and equanimity), five spiritual faculties (e.g., faith and wisdom), and three pure faculties related to spiritual attainment. Vasubandhu also discusses the Vaibhāṣika list of seventy-five factors, categorized into matter (rūpa), mind (citta), mental factors (caitasika), conditioned factors dissociated from mind (cittaviprayuktasaṃskāras), and unconditioned factors (asaṃskṛta). 

This chapter further explores the simultaneous arising of conditioned factors, focusing on the interaction between mind moments (citta) and their accompanying thought concomitants. This leads into a broader discussion of causality, where Vasubandhu identifies the various types of causes (hetu), results (phala), and conditions (pratyaya). 

Finally, the chapter explains how conscious events (cittas) succeed one another in causal sequence. 

=== 3: The Exposition on the World (&quot;loka-nirdeśa&quot;) ===
The third chapter addresses Buddhist cosmology, describing the threefold world where sentient beings reside: the realms of desire (kāma-dhātu), realm of form (rūpya-dhātu), and the formless realm (arūpya-dhātu). Vasubandhu also explains the intermediate state (antarabhava) between death and rebirth and elaborates on dependent origination (pratītya-samutpāda), which accounts for cyclic existence without an enduring self (atman). He also depicts the receptacle world (bhājana-loka), detailing its physical structure—Mount Sumeru, continents, and oceans—and its cosmogony, temporal cosmology of kalpas and dissolution. 

=== 4: The Exposition on Karma (&quot;karma-nirdeśa&quot;) ===
Chapter four of the Kośa is devoted to a study of action i.e. karma. This chapter explores the metaphysics of action, focusing on its most basic form, particularly bodily action. Debates on this topic include the Pudgalavādin view that action is movement, the Sarvāstivāda claim that it is shape, and Vasubandhu&#x27;s Sautrāntika position that it is intention (cetanā) directed toward the body. The chapter distinguishes between informative actions, observable by others, and non-informative actions, internal to the agent, with mental action playing a crucial role in karmic retribution (vipaka). It also includes the Buddhist classification of ten virtuous and non-virtuous paths of action (karmapatha), concluding with a discussion of the effects of actions, though deferring details of their processes to later sections. 

=== 5: The Exposition on the Underlying Tendencies (&quot;anuśaya-nirdeśa&quot;) ===
This chapter centers on latent dispositions or proclivities (anuśaya), the dormant state of mental afflictions (kleśa). These are subconscious dispositions that remain inactive until specific causes and conditions trigger them into active defilements, termed “envelopments” (paryavasthāna). Their importance in the Buddhist path lies in their role in motivating karma, which sustains saṃsāric existence. Six primary proclivities are identified: attachment (rāga), hostility (pratigha), ignorance (avidyā), conceit (māna), doubt (vicikitsā), and afflicted views (dṛṣṭi). 

A major debate covered in this chapter is that between the Sarvāstivāda and Sautrāntika positions on defilement. The Sarvāstivādins view the proclivities (anuśaya) as ultimately existent factors (dharmas) that transform into active defilements, treating &quot;proclivity&quot; and &quot;envelopment&quot; as synonymous. In contrast, Vasubandhu’s Sautrāntika perspective denies their ultimate existence, interpreting proclivities as forces (śākti) within the mind stream that lead to afflictions through transformation. Vasubandhu likens proclivities to seeds (bīja) that mature into fruits (phala). This discussion extends to the nature of past and future dharmas, with Sarvāstivāda asserting their existence and Sautrāntika rejecting unnecessary ontological entities. 

=== 6: The Exposition on Paths and Persons (&quot;mārgapudgala-nirdeśa&quot;) ===
The sixth chapter describes the path to liberation, structured around the four noble truths and the schema of the five paths. Vasubandhu addresses concerns such as why the first truth emphasizes suffering and not pleasure. He also provides definitions of conventional and ultimate truths. Meditative practices, including mindfulness of breathing, the loathsomeness of the body, and the four foundations of mindfulness, are explained and categorized under the path of preparation (prayogamārga). The subsequent paths are the path of insight (darśanamārga), the path of cultivation (bhāvanāmārga), and the path of no further training (aśaikṣamārga), correlating with levels of defilement purification and the stages of attainment: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and arhat. Additionally, the thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening (bodhipakṣikadharma) are discussed in this chapter. 

=== 7: The Exposition on Wisdom (&quot;jñāna-nirdeśa&quot;) ===
The seventh chapter outlines the ten types of knowledge (jñāna) attained by those at advanced spiritual levels. These include knowledge of factors (dharmajñāna), subsequent knowledge (anvayajñāna), mundane conventional knowledge (lokasaṃvṛtijñāna), knowledge of others’ minds (paracittajñāna), and knowledge of the four noble truths (suffering, its origin, cessation, and the path). Advanced forms include knowledge of exhaustion (kṣayajñāna) and non-arising (anutpādajñāna), unique to arhats, representing certainty in the completion of tasks related to the truths. The chapter differentiates these types of knowledge from right view (samyagdṛṣṭi) and receptivity (kṣānti), while also exploring their qualities and characteristics. 

=== 8: The Exposition on Meditative Attainment (&quot;samāpatti-nirdeśa&quot;) ===
The eighth chapter delves into meditative attainments (samāpatti), offering a detailed analysis of absorptions (samādhi). It describes the qualities of the four meditations (dhyāna) of the form realm, the four formless perception spheres (āyatana), and the attainment of cessation (nirodhasamāpatti). Vasubandhu highlights three key types of samādhi: the samādhi of emptiness (śūnyatā), leading to the realization of selflessness; the samādhi of signlessness (animitta), focusing on the nirvana free of characteristics; and the samādhi of wishlessness (apraṇihita), fostering detachment from all phenomena. The chapter also explores the four immeasurables (brahmavihāra)—loving-kindness (maitrī), compassion (karuṇā), joy (muditā), and equanimity (upekṣā)—alongside three additional frameworks of concentration: the eight liberations (vimokṣa), the eight spheres of mastery (abhivāyatana), and the ten totality spheres (kṛtsnāyatana). 

=== 9: The Refutation of the View of a Self (&quot;atmavāda-pratiṣedha&quot;) ===
This additional concluding treatise critiques notions of individuality, targeting two key perspectives. The first is the Pudgalavāda view, which posits the existence of a person (pudgala) distinct yet not separate from the five aggregates. Vasubandhu challenges this with arguments from reason and scripture, particularly addressing the school’s fire-and-fuel analogy. The second critique targets the concept of an enduring self (ātman), upheld in various forms by all six orthodox Indian schools. Vasubandhu addresses objections from putative Hindu philosophers, tackling issues such as the no-self doctrine&#x27;s compatibility with memory, agency (e.g., walking), and the differentiation of individual consciousness streams.

==The Text and its Translations==
The Sanskrit original of the &quot;Abhidharmakośabhāṣya&quot; was lost for centuries, and was known to scholarship only through Chinese and Tibetan translations. The work was of such importance to the history of Indian thought that in the 1930s, the great scholar Rāhula Sāṅkṛtyāyana (1893–1963) even re-translated the verses into Sanskrit, from Tibetan, and wrote his own Sanskrit commentary on them.  However, during a subsequent visit to Tibet, Sāṅkṛtyāyana discovered an ancient palm-leaf manuscript of 367 leaves that contained not only Vasubandhu&#x27;s verses, but his lost commentary. In 1967 and then in a revised edition of 1975, Prof. P. Pradhan of Utkal University finally published the original Sanskrit text of the &quot;Abhidharmakośabhāṣya&quot;, Vasubandhu&#x27;s great work summarizing earlier traditions of the Vibhāṣā school of Buddhist philosophy.

The &quot;Abhidharmakośa-kārikā&quot; (the verses) and the &quot;Abhidharmakośa-bhāṣya&quot; (the auto-commentary) were translated into Chinese in the 6th century by Paramārtha (T1559). They were translated again in the 7th century by Xuanzang (T1560 &amp; T1558). Other translations and commentaries exist in Tibetan, Chinese, Classical Mongolian and Old Uyghur.

The verses and the commentary were first translated into a European language by Louis de La Vallée-Poussin, published in 1923–1931 in French, which is primarily based on Xuanzang&#x27;s Chinese translation but also references the Sanskrit text, Paramārtha&#x27;s Chinese translation, and the Tibetan.

Currently, three complete English translations exist. The first by Leo M. Pruden in 1988 and the second by Gelong Lodrö Sangpo in 2012 are both based on La Vallée-Poussin&#x27;s French translation. The third by Masahiro Shōgaito in 2014 is a translation of the Uighur translation of Xuanzang&#x27;s Chinese translation.

*Samghabhadra (5th century CE), &quot;Nyāyānusāra&quot;. This text critiques Vasubandhu&#x27;s exposition on numerous points and defends the Vaibhasika orthodox views against Vasubandhu and other Sautrāntikas such as the elder Śrīlāta and his pupil Rāma. It only survives in a Chinese translation by Xuanzang.

=== Chinese Commentaries ===
According to Paul Demiéville, some of the major extant Chinese commentaries to the &quot;Abhidharmakośa include&quot;:

* Shen-t&#x27;ai (神泰), &quot;Chü-she lun shu&quot;, originally in twenty Chinese volumes, today only volumes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 17 are extant.
* P&#x27;u-kuang (普光), &quot;Chü-she lun chi&quot; (in thirty-volumes, 7th century), which quotes Shen-t&#x27;ai. P&#x27;u-kuang also wrote a small treatise on the Kosa.
* Fa-pao (法寶), &quot;Chü-she lun shu&quot;, which quotes Shen-t&#x27;ai and P&#x27;u-kuang.
* Yuan-hui (圓暉), &quot;Chü-she lun sung shu.&quot; (俱舍論頌疏) According to Demiéville, this work was &quot;commented upon several times in China and widely used in Japan; it is from this work that the Mahayanists generally draw their knowledge of the &quot;Kośa&quot;. But from the point of view of Indology, it does not offer the same interest as the three preceding commentaries.&quot;

Two other disciples of Xuanzang, Huai-su and K&#x27;uei-chi, wrote commentaries on the &quot;Kośa&quot; which are lost.

<text>Cinco Ribeiras is a civil parish in the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo on the island of Terceira in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 704, in an area of 12.80 km2.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
The parish of Cinco Ribeiras is situated on the southwest coast of the island of Terceira, occupying a roughly triangler swath from the coast to the summit of the volcano of Santa Bárbara in the island&#x27;s interior. It is an area of approximately , that reaches an altitude of above sea level. It is bordered on the east by the civil parish of São Bartolomeu de Regatos and west by the parish of Santa Bárbara das Nove Ribeiras, as well as, along a short frontier to the north, with the parish of Altares.

The parish&#x27;s southern coast is formed from a high arriba, marked by its only major geological structure, the Ponta das Cinco, a rocky spur formed by a basaltic dike that penetrated one of the radial faults, along the Serra de Santa Bárbara. Yet, running through the region are several smaller volcanic cones composed of black or red basaltic rock. The lower part of the parish developed along a planar zone that corresponds with the terminal area of basaltic fissural flows from the region of Pico da Bagacina, resulting in a gently sloping area towards the northwest. This area is occupied by relatively recent lava flows, with little evidence of pyroclastic eruptive material, translating into shallow soils and rocky covering.

Towards the west and interior, the slope gradually increases, passing into a transition zone towards the cone of the Serra de Santa Bárbara. The highest part of the parish, the apex of the administrative frontier corresponds to the watercourses that divide the ravines of Praia da Vitória and Cinco Ribeiras, an area of accentuated slopes, reaching the summit of the caldera of Santa Bárbara (the highest point on the island of Terceira). Apart from this volcano, the parish is little accented, with only the Pico da Praia, at above sea level, representing the highest altitude in the parish.

Cinco Ribeiras is crossed by three primary ravines: the Ribeira do Mouro, the Ribeira das Cinco and the Ribeira da Praia, that are part of the radial drainage system, of the Santa Bárbara Massif.

===Climate===
Situated along the southwest of the Serra de Santa Bárbara, the parish occupies a transition zone between oceanic and Mediterranean climate (on the Köppen-Geiger classification between Csb, on the lower areas, and Cfb, on higher altitudes), exposed to strong southwest winds, resulting in elevated humidity during periods of atmospheric instability, intense orthographic precipitation in the higher altitudes. Precipitation along the massif results in flooding along the shallow ravines, which are unable to transport the water that flows from the higher altitudes.

===Human geography===

Urban development, much like the other settlements of Terceira, is constituted by a linear structure, that follows the main roadway that circles the island, with little expansion into the fields. The lateral roads normally accompany the ravines, except for the area between Ribeira do Mouro and Ribeira das Cinco, where smaller urban agglomerations developed along the municipal road of Canadinhas, the circuits above the Regional Roadway to connect Cinco Ribeiras and Terra Chã (through São Bartolomeu de Regatos).

Another nucleus in development, constituted by primarily summer homes, developed around the porto of Cinco Ribeiras, circling the small hermitage of Nossa Senhora de Lurdes, in addition to a few homes in the &quot;Canada do Porto&quot; alongside.

Following the 1991 census the parish included 650 inhabitants (138 males and 114 female residents), included in the localities referred to as Ribeira das Cinco (51 inhabitants), Ribeira do Mouro (84 inhabitants) and Cinco Ribeiras (418 inhabitants). The population decreased during the 20th century, from its apex of 1180 residents around 1900.

The evolution of the parish has been marked by emigration, primarily to Brasil, then the United States and finally to Canada. During the 20th century, the population maintained stable until the middle of the 1960s; then, following facilitated emigration laws and the consequence of the Kennedy-Pastore Act, the population began a rapid decline until it stabilized following the Carnation Revolution.

==Architecture==
The traditional architecture of Cinco Ribeiras resembles much of the rural homes of the western Terceira region, and is generally constructed around a single floor. The settlement is also distinguished for its many white-washed homes, bordered by multi-coloured trim around the corners, doors and windows (unique for the island of Terceira).

<text>Abertzale (; English: &quot;patriot&quot;, literally &quot;fond of the fatherland&quot;) is a Basque term usually referring to people or political groups who are associated with Basque nationalism.

Although the term is a synonym of &quot;patriot&quot;, its common use in Basque mainly refers to Basque nationalism, whereas in the Spanish language &quot;abertzale&quot; (also spelled &quot;aberzale&quot;) means &quot;Basque nationalist&quot;.

The use of the term by members and sympathizers of Herri Batasuna, and the fact that the followers of the Basque Nationalist Party (&quot;Partido Nacionalista Vasco&quot;, PNV) call themselves &quot;jeltzales&quot; more than &quot;abertzales&quot;, has brought about a situation where in the Spanish language the word is at times associated with that particular leftist current of Basque nationalism.

Several organizations past and present have used this word in their official Basque-language names:

*Abertzaleen Batasuna (&quot;Unity of the Abertzales&quot;): A political party in the French Basque Country.
*Emakume Abertzale Batza (&quot;Women&#x27;s Abertzale Organization&quot;), onetime women&#x27;s section of the PNV, made illegal by the rebel junta in Burgos during the Spanish Civil War.
*Euskal Abertzaletasunaren Museoa (&quot;Museum of Basque Nationalism&quot;).
*The name Eusko Abertzaleak (&quot;Basque Patriots&quot;) is used by various parliamentary and town council groups of the Basque Nationalist Party. In fact, Eusko Alkartasuna was meant to be founded under the name &quot;Eusko Abertzaleak&quot;, but the Basque Nationalist Party registered this name first.
*Eusko Abertzale Ekintza (&quot;Basque Nationalist Action&quot;), a Basque nationalist and leftist party.
*Ezker Mugimendu Abertzalea (&quot;Leftist Abertzale Movement&quot;): A political party in the French Basque Country.
*Gazte Abertzaleak (&quot;Abertzale Youths&quot;): the youth group of the Spanish Basque political party Eusko Alkartasuna, left of the PNV but not aligned with ETA or Batasuna.
*Koordinadora Abertzale Sozialista (&quot;Abertzale Socialist Coordinating Council&quot;, KAS).
*The names Ezker Abertzalea (&quot;Izquierda Abertzale&quot; or &quot;Abertzale Left&quot;), Nafarroako Sozialista Abertzaleak (&quot;Abertzale Socialist of Navarre&quot;) and Araba, Bizkai eta Gipuzkoako Sozialista Abertzaleak (&quot;Abertzale Socialists of Álava, Biscay, and Gipuzkoa&quot;) have been used by various parliamentary groups of Herri Batasuna and Euskal Herritarrok in different parliaments.

The term &quot;ezker abertzalea&quot; (abertzale left) is used to refer to parties or organisations which are Basque nationalist, but at the same time, left-wing. This may be Marxist, communist, socialist or social-democratic. The term is used to distinguish these organisations from the usual traditionalist or conservative character of the Basque Nationalist Party.

<doc id="1250904" wikidata="Q64066" url="?curid=1250904" title="Louise, Baroness Lehzen">
<text>Johanna Clara Louise, Baroness von Lehzen (3 October 17849 September 1870) was the governess and later companion to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.

Lehzen was born to a Lutheran pastor Joachim Friedrich Lehzen (1735-1800) and his wife, Marie Catharina Melusine Palm (1745-1793), herself the daughter of a priest. In 1819 she entered the household of the Duke of Kent, fourth son of King George III. Five years later, Lehzen was appointed governess to his only child, Princess Alexandrina Victoria. The young princess became second-in-line to the British throne in 1827.

Victoria&#x27;s upbringing was dominated by the controlling Kensington System, implemented by the widowed Duchess of Kent and her comptroller Sir John Conroy. Lehzen was strongly protective of Victoria, and encouraged the princess to be strong, informed, and independent from the Duchess and Conroy&#x27;s influence, causing friction within the household. Attempts to remove the governess were unsuccessful, as Lehzen had the support of Victoria&#x27;s royal uncles. &quot;Dear, good Lehzen&quot; soon came to supersede all others – including her own mother – in Victoria&#x27;s eyes.

When Victoria became queen in 1837, Lehzen served as a sort of unofficial private secretary, enjoying apartments adjacent to Victoria. The queen&#x27;s marriage to Prince Albert in 1840 led to significant changes in the royal household. Albert and Lehzen detested each other, and after an illness of the Princess Royal in 1841, Lehzen was dismissed. Her close relationship with the queen came to an end, although the two continued to correspond. Lehzen spent her final years in Hanover on a generous pension, dying in 1870. Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria&#x27;s character, in particular giving her the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and life as a young queen.

==Family and early life==
Johanna Clara Louise Lehzen was born in Hanover on 3 October 1784, the youngest of ten children born to the Lutheran pastor Joachim Friedrich Lehzen and his wife, Melusine Palm. Forced by circumstances to work for her living since she was young, Lehzen was employed by an aristocratic German family von Marenholtz. She served as governess to the family&#x27;s three daughters, and earned positive references.

Based on these references, Lehzen became part of the household of Princess Victoria, Duchess of Kent in December 1819. In that role, she held the position of governess to twelve-year-old Princess Feodora of Leiningen, the daughter of the princess from her first marriage. In her second marriage, Princess Victoria had married Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, who was, at the time, fourth in line for the British throne. Lehzen and the entire household were moved to England in 1817 so that the new Duchess of Kent&#x27;s child might be born there, strengthening the child&#x27;s claim to the throne. The baby was a girl, christened Alexandrina Victoria after her mother and her godfather, Alexander I of Russia; she would grow up to be Queen Victoria.

==Tutor to Princess Victoria==
The Duke of Kent died quite suddenly in 1820, followed quickly by his father, King George III. Victoria&#x27;s uncle, the Prince Regent, ascended the throne as King George IV. Victoria was now third in line to the throne, after her uncles the Duke of York and the Duke of Clarence, both of whom were well past middle age and neither of whom had legitimate heirs. As the likely eventual heir, Victoria had to be educated accordingly. Feodora was now 14, and no longer required the services of a governess. After the dismissal of nursemaid Mrs. Brock, Lehzen – as she was always known in the household – took over five-year-old Victoria&#x27;s care in 1824. The Duchess and her comptroller, John Conroy made the appointment not only because Lehzen was German (rather than English), but also because they believed she was unlikely to operate independently of their wishes.

The historian Christopher Hibbert describes Lehzen as &quot;a handsome woman, despite her pointed nose and chin, clever, emotional, humourless.&quot; Though she at first feared Lehzen&#x27;s stern manner, &quot;dear, good Lehzen&quot; soon came to occupy a place in Victoria&#x27;s heart that superseded all others, including her own mother, the Duchess of Kent. Lehzen encouraged the princess to distrust her mother and her mother&#x27;s friends, and to maintain her independence. The governess was uninterested in money and lacked ambition for herself, instead choosing to devote her time and energy to the princess. Victoria took to calling Lehzen &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;dearest Daisy&quot; in private, writing Lehzen was &quot;the most affectionate, devoted, attached, and disinterested friend I have.&quot; As part of the controlling Kensington System devised by Conroy, after 1824 Victoria was to be accompanied by Lehzen at all times during the day; consequently Lehzen was not allowed out to leave Victoria&#x27;s side until the Duchess dismissed her at nighttime, and was required to hold the princess&#x27; hand when Victoria descended a staircase.

===Baroness Lehzen===
In 1827, the Duke of York died, making the Duke of Clarence heir presumptive, and Victoria second-in-line to the throne. King George IV expressed doubt that Lehzen was the proper candidate to prepare Victoria. In response, her mother and Conroy persuaded the king to award them both titles, so that the princess would not be surrounded by commoners; Lehzen became a Baroness of the Kingdom of Hanover. George IV died in 1830, and was succeeded by his brother the Duke of Clarence, who became King William IV. William formally recognised Victoria as his heir presumptive. According to Lehzen, around this time an infamous scene took place, in which Lehzen slipped a copy of the genealogy of the House of Hanover into one of the princess&#x27;s lesson books. After perusing it for some time, Victoria came to see that her father had been next in line after the king, and that Queen Adelaide had no surviving children. This was the first time Victoria came to realise the destiny that had been assumed by many since her birth; that she would be the next British monarch. After a pause, Victoria is reported to have said &quot;I will be good.&quot; This story entered into folk legend for future English generations.

King William appointed his friend, the Duchess of Northumberland, as Victoria&#x27;s official governess in 1831, but the role was mostly ceremonial, and the princess continued to depend on Lehzen. The Duchess was dismissed in 1837 by Victoria&#x27;s mother for attempting to become more influential in her royal charge&#x27;s education. During this time, Lehzen held no official position at court; despite her recently acquired title, her commoner status continued to be a hindrance.

===Educating Victoria===
The wish of the Duchess and Conroy to keep Victoria dependent on their will was circumvented by Lehzen, who wanted her charge to become a strong, informed woman. As Victoria grew older, attempts were made by Conroy and the Duchess for Lehzen&#x27;s removal, or at least the lessening of her influence. Such tactics proved unsuccessful, as the princess became more devoted to Lehzen than before, as evident in her journals. Lehzen&#x27;s only true friend in the household, Baroness Spath, had been suddenly dismissed in 1828 on the orders of Conroy; rumours abounded that the baroness witnessed &quot;familiarities&quot; between him and the Duchess. Members of George IV&#x27;s court speculated that Lehzen would be the next to leave, but she remained silent on the issue and preserved her position. In 1835, the Duchess of Kent wrote her daughter a stern letter demanding that Victoria develop a more formal and less intimate relationship with Lehzen. The same year (in which Victoria turned sixteen), plans to dismiss Lehzen fell apart after she devotedly nursed Victoria through a five-week illness. Lehzen aided a weakened Victoria in her refusal to sign a document prepared for her by Conroy and the Duchess that would guarantee him a position when she became queen. During her tenure, Lehzen had the support of George IV, William IV, and another of Victoria&#x27;s uncles, Leopold I of Belgium, who all believed that she was vital to the princess&#x27;s health, happiness, and continued resistance to Conroy&#x27;s influence.

The education Victoria received from Lehzen was rudimentary but solid. Contrary to the prevailing attitudes of the time, Lehzen, tutor Dr. George Davys, and others successfully encouraged Victoria to enjoy acquiring knowledge. Davys was put in charge of the &quot;solid department of her studies&quot;, while Lehzen concentrated on the &quot;more ornamental departments&quot;, such as dancing. Gaining an &quot;enlightened education&quot;, the princess learned to speak French, German, Latin, and English, liked history and was taught economics, geography, mathematics, politics, art, and music. Lehzen was strict, but rewarded the princess when she was obedient. In another departure from the era, Lehzen employed little to no corporal punishment; at least, there is no record of it in the household accounts.

==Victoria in power==
When Victoria ascended the throne in 1837, Lehzen enjoyed a prominent position at the coronation, and remained at court. At her request, she was given no official position, but agreed on a new title, &quot;lady attendant&quot;. In her role, she was installed at Buckingham Palace as a sort of unofficial private secretary, served as chief liaison for the royal residences, and carried the household keys as a sign of her position; her signature was required for all payments of tradesmen&#x27;s bills. At this point, it seems that Lehzen had totally replaced Victoria&#x27;s mother both in terms of influence and affection; Lehzen&#x27;s apartments adjoined the queen&#x27;s, while the Duchess of Kent was installed in a suite of rooms far removed from Victoria. For the first few years of Victoria&#x27;s reign, especially before her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840, Lehzen had a very strong influence on the queen&#x27;s outlook on both politics and personal matters, despite the fact that she did not overtly involve herself in state affairs. Even after the queen&#x27;s marriage, Lehzen retained the private doorway into the royal bedroom, a source of displeasure for Victoria&#x27;s new husband.

===Supplanted by Prince Albert===

The arrival of Prince Albert led to significant changes in Victoria&#x27;s household. Lehzen had opposed Coburg ambitions of Victoria marrying Albert, believing the princess to be a &quot;second Queen Elizabeth, virgin and independent of male influence.&quot; Albert was well-educated, and had just completed a tour of Europe, preceded by years at the University of Bonn. Victoria&#x27;s court dismayed his puritan German sensibilities. Lehzen and Albert soon developed a dislike for each other; she regularly thwarted Albert&#x27;s will in the running of the household; meanwhile, he found her personally repellent and unworthy of befriending the queen, openly referring to her as &quot;the hag&quot; and a &quot;crazy stupid intriguer&quot;.

When Victoria&#x27;s first child, the Princess Royal, was born, Victoria trusted Lehzen to make the arrangements for the nursery. Lehzen placed it in the care of various staff as well as Sir James Clark, despite Albert&#x27;s objections that the physician was wholly unsuited to the post, having already discredited himself during the affair of Lady Flora Hastings a year previously. At fourteen months the Princess Royal fell ill, losing her appetite and appearing pale and feverish. Dr Clark declared it a minor ailment, incorrectly prescribing her with calomel, a medication laced with mercury and laudanum. In fact, it is more likely that the precocious princess was simply expressing her dismay at changes in the royal nursery, then occurring with the arrival of her younger brother. Albert, a devoted father, confronted Victoria on the incompetence of the staff selected by Lehzen. There was a quarrel, after which Albert declared that he would leave the affair in her queenly hands, and placed it on her conscience if the child died.

Soon after this argument Victoria conceded to her husband, not wishing to see him unhappy. She made a final attempt to defend Lehzen, describing her as a selflessly loyal woman who deserved to remain close to her former charge. But in the face of Albert&#x27;s resolve, Victoria dismissed Lehzen, ostensibly for her health. To Albert, Lehzen was a servant who had attempted to rise above her place in life, and he wanted Victoria to rely on him alone. Lehzen accepted the fiction of ill health, and agreed to depart. In the days leading up to her exit, she taught some of her duties to Marianne Skerrett, one of Victoria&#x27;s dressers, and returned her keys to the queen. Lehzen departed on 30 September 1842, leaving a note rather than speaking directly with Victoria, believing that this would be less painful. The queen was initially unaccustomed to Lehzen&#x27;s absence, having spent almost her whole life up to that point in the presence of the former governess. &quot;It was very painful to me... waking this morning, and recollecting she was really quite away,&quot; Victoria said.

Word of Lehzen&#x27;s departure spread through the court and elsewhere. Reports of the cause varied; the court diarist Charles Greville noted she was leaving &quot;for her health (as she says), to stay five or six months, but it is supposed never to return.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; however reported that she was simply visiting friends in Germany. After her departure, family adviser Baron Stockmar remarked of the affair that[I]t was not without great difficulty that the Prince succeeded in getting rid of [Lehzen]. She was foolish enough to contest his influence, and not to conform herself to the change in her position... If she had done so, and conciliated the P[rince], she might have remained in the Palace to the end of her life.

==Death and legacy==

When Lehzen was dismissed from the court she returned to her native Germany, living in Bückeburg. She lived with her sister on the generous pension provided by Victoria, a yearly sum of £800. She covered the walls of her house with portraits of the queen. Though her sister died several months later, the baroness continued to support financially her many nieces and nephews. Lehzen continued to regard Victoria with affection, and the queen wrote regularly to her former governess, weekly at first and later monthly at Lehzen&#x27;s request. When visiting relations in Germany, the queen came to visit her twice in private. The Baroness Lehzen died in Bückeburg on 9 September 1870, where she is buried in Jetenburger cemetery. Queen Victoria ordered the erection of a memorial to her. After Lehzen&#x27;s death, Queen Victoria spoke of her gratitude for their relationship, but commented &quot;after I came to the throne she got to be rather trying, and especially so after my marriage... [This was not] from any evil intention, only from a mistaken idea of duty and affection for me.&quot;

During her time at the British court, Lehzen attracted attention outside of the royal household for her close relationship with Victoria. She was criticised for her influence with the queen, particularly from those who disliked German influences at court. Pamphlets, many released by the Tory party, complained of the &quot;stranger harboured in our country&quot; and the &quot;evil counsellors&quot; surrounding Victoria. One in particular, published as the &quot;Warning Letter to Baroness Lehzen&quot;, declared that a &quot;certain foreign lady pulled the wires of a diabolical conspiracy of which Lady Flora was to be the first victim,&quot; a reference to the Lady Flora Hastings affair. More positive, &quot;The Times&quot; once described her as having simply &quot;held a highly and strictly confidential situation about the person of the Sovereign.&quot; As a sign of the perceived political influence she possessed, in 1838 false rumours suggested that Lehzen had been &quot;converted&quot; to the Whig party, and that she had been offered &quot;an urgent proposal of marriage&quot; by Whig prime minister Viscount Melbourne. Despite all of this criticism, the historian Gillian Gill describes how Lehzen was honest and frugal; even after Victoria ascended the throne, she seems to have made no demands for money or rank, preferring instead to simply be in the queen&#x27;s company. The historian K. D. Reynolds adds that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria&#x27;s character and moral development, in particular giving the queen the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and young queenship. Not all of her influence was positive, however; Reynolds also speculates that the 1839 Bedchamber crisis stemmed partly from Victoria&#x27;s unwillingness to lose Lehzen.

Baroness Lehzen has been portrayed numerous times in film and television. She was played by Renée Stobrawa in the 1936 German film &quot;Mädchenjahre einer Königin&quot;, Greta Schröder in the films &quot;Victoria the Great&quot; and &quot;Sixty Glorious Years&quot;, Barbara Everest in 1941&#x27;s &quot;The Prime Minister&quot;, Magda Schneider in the 1954 television serial &quot;The Story of Vickie&quot;, Olga Fabian in an episode of &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, Patience Collier in &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot;, Diana Rigg in the 2001 television serial &quot;Victoria &amp; Albert&quot;, Jeanette Hain in the 2009 film &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; and Daniela Holtz in the 2016 television series &quot;Victoria&quot;.

<text>The Pathfinder Club, or simply Pathfinders, is a department of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA), which works specifically with the cultural, social and religious education of children and teens. Children 10 years and older are eligible to become members of the club.

Though similar in many respects to Scouting, Pathfinders have a stronger religious emphasis. The Pathfinder Club has been an official component of the SDA church&#x27;s youth ministry since 1950. The current director of the program is Andrés J. Peralta.

An estimated 38% of Adventist youth under the age of 18 &quot;Are members of Pathfinders or a similar church-sponsored youth group&quot;, according to a 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders.

== History ==

The first step towards the organization of the Pathfinders Club within the Adventist Church in 1907 when the Department of Youth Missionary Volunteer (Volunteer Missionary Society) was established under the leadership of Pastor Milton Early Kern.

In 1909 are the first organized societies Missionary Volunteer Youth (MVY), and in 1914 developed the first lessons to be MVJ&#x27;s, that would be the precursor of the progressive classes Pathfinder.

In 1911 the nascent form of the Pathfinder club was founded in Takoma Park, Maryland. Three clubs were formed in Takoma Park in 1911, they were: &quot;Scouts Missions&quot;, &quot;Woodland Clan &amp; Pals&quot; and &quot;Takoma Indians&quot;. They were characterized by only accepting registration for boys. In 1919 Arthur Spalding founded the club &quot;Scouts Missionaries&quot;, in Madison County, Tennessee. Spalding studied the organization, made compatible with the spiritual goals of the Adventist Church (a feature that was not initially adopted by clubs from Takoma Park), rules and created the outline of the movement. The &quot;Scouts Missionaries&quot; developed the fundamental ideals for the current club of pathfinders.

In 1929 for the first time the name &quot;pathfinder&quot; was used on a schedule of juvenile SDA activities. The Association of Southern California promotes a camp for Youth Missionary Volunteers, and entitles the camp &quot;Pathfinder&quot;. The same Association (Southern California) in 1946 unilaterally formalizes and sponsors the program, with its first prototype recognized club being tested in Riverside, California.

Alongside the experience in California, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists in 1950, formalizes a program the club, and adopts a uniform, a flag (ade by Hellen Hobbs and Henry Theodore Bergh in 1948) and a hymn (composed in 1949 by Henry Theodore Bergh) for the official new department. The name was adopted for the program &quot;Youth Club - Missionary Volunteer&quot;.

Between 9–11 October 1953, the Southern Association of New England promoted the first Pathfinder Camporee in Ashburnham, Massachusetts. Since then camporees has been the main camp and form of interaction between Pathfinder clubs worldwide.

Since the formalization of the movement as the SDA program, it has undergone some upgrades, the most significant being:
* (1958) Development of progressive classes;
* (1959) Development of physical classes (gold and silver medals);
* (1976) Addition of honor &quot;Master Awards&quot; to the curriculum of the club;
* (1982) The global emblem Missionary Volunteer is replaced by the Pathfinder world emblem, and the name Missionary Volunteer falls into disuse;
* (1988) A major overhaul of the Pathfinder curriculum to modernize the teaching methods;
* (2012) The second general review of the Pathfinders curriculum is carried out;

In January 2018, there were more than 1.5 million Pathfinders and 40,000 clubs, spread over more than 150 countries.

== Philosophy and objectives ==

The Pathfinder Club is centered in the &quot;physical-mental-spiritual tripod&quot;, which develops activities to meet the needs and interests of children and adolescents between 10 and 15 years old, with a specific focus on the religious activities of this age group.

Much of the Pathfinder Club program is built around physical activities. According to the Pathfinder club manual, this focus is explained because &quot;young people between 10 and 15 years old are at a stage of growth and very rapid physical development.&quot; According to the philosophy, many of the club activities involve action, adventure, challenge and group activities, which &quot;provide opportunities for the development of new attitudes and skills that produce personal growth, team and community spirit,&quot;. These are part of the tripod of the philosophy to work towards &quot;citizenship and loyalty&quot; and that preach respect for &quot;God, His creation, and His church.&quot;

While the Pathfinder Club exists primarily for the youth, one of its primary purposes is to also meet parents and church members through an active involvement with the club. The purpose of this involvement is to correct (or suppress) the gap between generations approaching youth and adults. And to work and have fun together in a bond of common experience.

The whole philosophy of Pathfinders is built on the premise that &quot;juveniles and children learn best by example, instead of the precepts.&quot; The way they see the leaders and parental values is used as a spiritual and social role model. With this they are expected to develop high moral principles, attitudes of love, care and determination. These are built into all the activities. The educational philosophy of the club also emphasizes that youth learn more effectively in a positive, happy and secure atmosphere. According to the General Conference of SDA, &quot;the attitude of the leaders of the club is therefore vital to ensure the success and effectiveness of this ministry for youth ingredient, because it will be one of the main models to be followed by juveniles.&quot;

=== Leadership role ===

The leadership role is to &quot;help young people understand and love God and to watch over the church and the next.&quot; According to the Manual of the Pathfinder club, the goals and duties of the leadership of the club are:
* &quot;Encourage Pathfinders to discover their God-given potential and use their gifts and skills to meet the expectations of the plan of salvation&quot;;
* &quot;Inspire them to give personal expression of their love for God, uniting with other youth in various extension activities&quot;;
* &quot;Becoming number one priority club program the personal salvation of every Pathfinder&quot;;
* &quot;Building on the groundbreaking appreciation for a healthy life (enjoy outdoor activities) and cultivate in them a love for God&#x27;s creation&quot;;
* &quot;Teach the groundbreaking immersive and interactive skills in order to make the time and talents of the most significant youth&quot;;
* He should &quot;encourage the Pathfinder to keep physically fit, and teaches them to take care of your body and establish habits that will give your health benefits&quot;;
* &quot;Provide opportunities for development of leadership by encouraging club members working together and sharing the responsibilities of leadership.&quot;;
* &quot;And aim to promote the harmonious development of pathfinder, taking care of all necessary aspects, be they physical, social, intellectual and spiritual.&quot;

== Organization ==

Each Pathfinder club is run by a director of the club, deputy directors, counselors, instructors, chaplain, secretary and treasurer. The administrative offices of the club require that trained people are occupying the function. The General Conference Youth Department instructs that preferably leaders be invested - 18 years old, who have completed the &quot;Class Leader&quot; - or at least they are fulfilling the requirements of the Class Leader.

The club is divided into separate units, classified by age. Each unit has an average of six or eight pathfinders, depending on club size, who are accompanied by a counselor. The counselor is the unit leader. The unit functions as a cell of the club, or &quot;micro-club&quot; because it also develops an administrative organization chart with a captain and a secretary, and develops practical and theoretical activities through interaction among its members.

Clubs are also organized into &quot;regions&quot;, which act as groups of geographically close local clubs. Regions usually have the authority to develop longer term activities (e.g. camporees), demanding more effort and planning, also supporting the clubs through the &quot;regional team&quot;. The region is coordinated by a regional coordinator, usually an invested leader.

On a broader scope is the local coordination of Pathfinder fields (missions, associations, unions and divisions), which, as well as regional, has the mandate to coordinate activities that require more planning, besides answering to the General Conference for all activities and work done in a geographic region.

== Activities developed ==

Various activities are carried out in the club program, and subdivided according to the educational tripod club, focusing on the physical, mental and spiritual.

=== Physical health ===
As part of the official program, physical activity is valued, per the philosophy of the club stating that &quot;juveniles (between 10 and 15 years) are at a stage of growth and very rapid physical development&quot;. Various activities such as hiking, jungle trails, cycling, mountaineering, among others, have highlighted the activities of the department.

Activities inside and outside of the regular meeting of the club focus on the physical, such as recreational activities and games that encourage exercise. Even traditional activities of the regular meeting, as the united order, cherish the physical aspect, combined with the mental development.

Physical activities are, in essence (within the official philosophy), to entertain and attract children and adolescents, and allow it to jointly develop their mental and spiritual aspect.

=== Mental framework ===
A part of mental development is encouraging youth to study and develop classes and specialties, which are analogous to series and school subjects.

Although also understand the physical and spiritual aspects, classes and specialties bring a greater benefit to the mental explorer context, providing a larger learning about various subjects.

=== Spiritual realm ===
Although the physical part requires considerable time within the activities, spiritual development is the main focus of the club. The main objective is to bring the youth to have a &quot;constant daily experience with God&quot;, making him reflect on &quot;His creation and His care for him.&quot;

In spiritual matters, it carries out various activities to engage youth. Stand out missionary work, Bible studies and volunteer work.

One example activity that strengthens both the spiritual and mental realms is known as the Pathfinder Bible Experience. This is a friendly competition that encourages youth to study and memorize entire books of the Bible.

==== Christian citizenship ====

Within the spiritual realm there is the notion of Christian citizenship in Pathfinder club. This is an integral part of working with youth, and establishes the concepts (or second tripod) of &quot;citizenship and loyalty&quot; which are three: to serve God, the homeland, and others. The social work of the entire department is guided by this concept.

== Classes, specialties and merit system ==
=== Regular and advanced classes ===
Regular classes are activities that cover various topics, always considering the educational philosophy of the club. Classes resemble academic degrees, as is recommended to be developed within one year in accordance with the correct age for each class. Jointly develop the advanced classes, which contains more elaborate requirements, and usually with some degree of difficulty with regular classes. There are twelve existing classes for youth:

=== Leadership and specializations ===
Upon completing 16 years the Pathfinder has the possibility to choose to stay at the club and compose the picture of leadership. If this is the choice of young, he/she will answer the leading classes, which are three: Leader, Master Guide and Master Guide Senior. These classes have the task of preparing and empowering the youth who will compose the frames of leadership, giving all necessary instructions in this regard.

While the Leader class allows for the formation of leaders in a broader sense, the Master Guide class exists to specialize leaders already invested who will work on the technical training of aspirants. The latest degree of specialization, Master Guide Senior, is focused on the production and review of technical and didactic content for the department.

=== Specialties and masters ===
The specials are theoretical and practical activities focused on certain specific theme, like intensive courses. Your goal is to take the Pathfinder assimilate new knowledge from areas related to nutrition and health, to recreational areas so that empower and train to handle many different situations. In his philosophy, the specials are also thought to help in the spiritual and moral development.

The masters are groupings of related specialties that developed, give the explorer, through the merits of the club system, the possibility of this being awarded the merit of knowing a particular area of knowledge.

=== Merit system ===
The Pathfinder Merit System allows youth and adults to develop their skills in four major areas of activity, which are recognized in the club&#x27;s program as pillars of support, namely: the church, family, school (or work) and the club itself.

The incentive for good practice in all these pillars is recognized through the Good Conduct Ribbon Bar (the Pathfinder Excellence Award), which is awarded every 12 months to those young people (under 15 years of age) of recognized moral excellence. The club director, together with the other members of the board, are responsible for judging whether the candidate is fit. In some parts of the world, people over the age of 16 are eligible to receive the Good Conduct Ribbon Bar after five years of uninterrupted volunteer service at the club; in the case of these, it is the regional leader and the district leader who judge the suitability.

Other graduations par excellence include so-called classes of physical merit, which are as follows: Silver Medal, and Gold Medal. They are characterized by strongly encouraging the physical and athletic development of adolescents and youth who are in the leadership cadres of the Pathfinder club, the Adventurers Club and Youth Club.

<text>Gerbillinae is one of the subfamilies of the rodent family Muridae and includes the gerbils, jirds, and sand rats. Once known as desert rats, the subfamily includes about 110 species of African, Indian, and Asian rodents, including sand rats and jirds, all of which are adapted to arid habitats. Most are primarily active during the day, making them diurnal (but some species, including the common household pet, exhibit crepuscular behavior), and almost all are omnivorous. 

The gerbil got its name as a diminutive form of &quot;jerboa&quot;, an unrelated group of rodents occupying a similar ecological niche. Gerbils are typically between long, including the tail, which makes up about half of their total length. One species, the great gerbil (&quot;Rhombomys opimus&quot;), originally native to Turkmenistan, can grow to more than . The average adult gerbil weighs about .

One species, the Mongolian gerbil (&quot;Meriones unguiculatus&quot;), also known as the &quot;clawed jird&quot;, is a gentle and hardy animal that has become a popular small house pet. It is also used in some scientific research.

<doc id="1250928" wikidata="Q5055454" url="?curid=1250928" title="Cayuga, Ontario">
<text>Cayuga ( ) is an unincorporated community and county seat of Haldimand County, Ontario, Canada located at the intersection of Highway 3 and Munsee Street and along the Grand River. Cayuga is about a 20-minute drive from Lake Erie and 30 minutes south of Hamilton and 115 minutes south of Toronto and consequently it has some cottages and recreational properties in the area. In the past, there was some light industry. It has the local district detachment for the Ontario Provincial Police. It is also uniquely located among larger communities on both the American and Canadian sides of the border boasting television reception from Toronto, Buffalo, New York, Hamilton, Kitchener and Erie, Pennsylvania.

==History==
Cayuga was incorporated as a village in 1859 and became the county seat for Haldimand County because of its central location. It is named after the Cayuga, one of the Six Nations of the Grand River Natives who were awarded land in the area for siding with the British in the American Revolution.

As the county seat, it is the location of the Court House, jail and a museum. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, public hangings were held in the courtyard and the prisoners buried on site. The Highway 3 bridge over the Grand River (Cayuga Bridge) was a very well recognized bridge over the Grand River and was commonly used as a symbol of Haldimand County and the Grand River. For example, the same bridge had been used in a movie that commemorated Terry Fox. That bridge no longer remains a symbol of the Grand River and Haldimand County as it was replaced in the summer of 2014 with a concrete bridge.

The village&#x27;s population grew to about 2,500 in the mid-19th century because the Grand River was an important commercial route. There were locks constructed at Indiana just north of Cayuga. However, when the Welland Canal was completed, the Grand became an obsolete route. Further, an impassable dam was built downriver from Cayuga at Dunnville. Although originally part of the Welland Canal, the purpose of the dam and a canal at Port Maitland is to keep the level of the Welland Canal consistent. Presently the population of Cayuga has recovered to approximately 1,500 after having been around 1,000 for almost a century.

In 1974, Cayuga was amalgamated with the villages of Hagersville and Caledonia and the townships of Oneida, Seneca, North Cayuga, South Cayuga, parts of Rainham and Walpole to form the town of Haldimand. Despite nearby Caledonia being the largest community in the town, the town hall was located in Cayuga because of its central location. In 2001, Haldimand, Dunnville and half of Nanticoke were consolidated into a larger Haldimand. Cayuga is now an unincorporated community in Ward 2 of Haldimand County.

==Climate==

On February 13, 2009, the Grand River flooded when the river ice thawed, damaging Cayuga and Dunnville, Ontario.
On February 14, 2009, the CCGC &quot;Griffin&quot; proceeded up the river to help clear ice.

==Government==
Cayuga is in Ward 2 of Haldimand County. The current councillor for Ward 2 is John Metcalfe, who has been councillor since 2018. Before him it was Fred Morison from 2010–2018 and before Morison, it was Buck Sloat from 2003 to 2010.

The current Mayor Of Haldimand County is Shelly Ann Bentley. The previous Mayor was Ken Hewitt 2010-2022. The Mayor before him was Marie Trainer from 2003 to 2010. Before Marie Trainer, the mayor was Lorraine Bergstrand 2001–2003.

The current Clerk is Evelyn Eichenbaum who works in Cayuga at the Haldimand County Cayuga Administration building. The current Chief Administrative Officer of Haldimand County is Don Boyle who works in Cayuga at the Haldimand County Cayuga Administration building.

==Demographics==
Cayugans are overwhelmingly British by national background but many can trace their roots to an original German settlement near Cayuga in the 19th century. There was also a large Dutch migration to the area after the Second World War.
===Ethnicity===
Only those populations which compose more than 1% of the population have been included.
===Language===
As of the 2021 census, there were 1,675 citizens that spoke English only and 30 that are bilingual in both official languages.

===Religion===
As of the 2021 census, there were 1,045 citizens identifying as Christian and 655 as non-religious and secular perspectives.

==Education==
Public education in Cayuga is administered by the Grand Erie District School Board and the Catholic schools by the Brant Haldimand Norfolk Catholic District School Board. Schools located in Cayuga include:

*JL Mitchener Public School
*St. Stephen&#x27;s School
*Cayuga Secondary School

==Sports==

Just south of Cayuga and demographically associated is the hamlet of Fisherville. In 1954 a hockey team composed of local players which played out of the Cayuga Arena was sponsored by &#x27;Fisherville Seed&#x27; and consequently known as the Fisherville Seedmen. It won the Ontario Intermediate Hockey Championship. Jack Melenbacher a local who was at the time an NHL referee mentored the team and a young Roy Edwards who played goal for the Seedmen later starred in the NHL for the Detroit Red Wings.

James Daly, of Cayuga, is currently a national team athlete with Floorball Canada (2022). Last participating in the 2021 Floorball World Championships in Helsinki, Finland

==Attractions==
In more recent years Cayuga has become known for auto racing. The oldest continually operating dragstrip in Canada and the fastest high bank oval race track in Canada, are located near the townsite; Cayuga International Speedway. It is a 5/8-mile oval auto racing track, which was reopened in 2017 and hosts a round of the NASCAR Pinty&#x27;s Series. The drag strip was originally a runway built for training British Commonwealth pilots during the Second World War.

CayugaFest is an annual event in July, founded in 2002.

==Notable people==
Birthplace of Frank Martin (1933-2007), who played over 300 games for the Chicago BlackHawks in the late 1940s and the early 1950s.

Birthplace of Helen Kinnear (1894-1970) who, in 1939, was appointed the first woman Superior Court judge in the British Empire having previously been appointed the first woman King&#x27;s Counsel.

Both Marty McSorley and Ray Emery grew up playing minor league hockey in Cayuga. Both of which became NHL hockey players.

Birthplace of Jeremy LaLonde, Canadian filmmaker, grew up in Cayuga attending Cayuga Secondary School where he was a prominent member of the drama club. He has since gone on to direct multiple feature films including &quot;How to Plan an Orgy in a Small Town&quot;, &quot;Sex After Kids&quot;, &quot;The Go-Getters&quot;, &quot;The Untitled Work of Paul Shepard&quot;, and &quot;James vs. His Future Self&quot;. He has also directed the TV series &quot;Baroness Von Sketch Show&quot;.

<text>Midway Arcade Treasures 2 is the second collection of classic arcade games published by Midway for the PlayStation 2, Xbox (not compatible with Xbox 360), and GameCube. This compilation includes 20 games that were not in the 2003 release of &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;. Unlike the previous game, it was rated M for Mature instead of T for Teen by the ESRB.

The game plays similar on all three consoles, though the Xbox version has the exclusive ability to upload scores to an online scoreboard to Xbox Live. In line with other online-enabled games on the Xbox, online support was available to players until April 15, 2010. &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot; is now supported online again on the replacement Xbox Live servers called Insignia.

. The Xbox version is not compatible with the Xbox 360. The special features on each version of the game are the same. These include game histories, developer interviews, and other documents.

==Games==
The collection consists of the following 20 arcade games:
This collection is the only arcade classics compilation title on sixth-generation consoles to be rated M by the ESRB, largely because of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; and &quot;3&quot;, and &quot;NARC&quot;. With all the other games, the compilation would have received a rating of a T (for teen) or lower. &quot;Primal Rage&quot; was rated T by the ESRB when it was previously ported onto fourth- and fifth-generation consoles. &quot;Rampage World Tour&quot; is also featured as a bonus game in &quot;Rampage Total Destruction&quot; on GameCube and Wii, which is rated E10+ by the ESRB.

The compilation was planned to include all three titles, &quot;S.T.U.N. Runner&quot;, &quot;Steel Talons&quot; and the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; was instead moved to the extras disc in the limited edition version of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, while the other two games were omitted entirely because of developmental problems. &quot;Kozmik Krooz&#x27;r&quot; and &quot;Wacko&quot; were added instead.

The first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; later appeared in other compilations from the &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot; series: &quot;Extended Play&quot; for the PSP, and &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; for the PC; while &quot;S.T.U.N. Runner&quot; appeared in &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 3&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot; was given average to favorable reviews from game critics. On the review aggregator GameRankings, the compilation has an average score of 73%, while the average score is 74 out of 100 on Metacritic. Criticisms are the weaker selection of titles when compared to the previous volume, minor and major emulation glitches, the omission of the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and for some of the interviews and documentaries for being grainy and unrestored. GameSpot also criticized the inclusion of the original &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, as opposed to the superior &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;.

Due to button mapping issues with the start button, in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; random character select (Up+Start) cannot be used and Smoke (Down+Start at the Portal stage while getting a Dan Forden shouting out the: &quot;Toasty!&quot; message) cannot be fought.

<text>Midway Arcade Treasures is a video-game compilation of 24 arcade games, emulated from the original PCBs. The compilation was developed by Digital Eclipse and issued by Midway for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows. The game could not function on the Xbox 360&#x27;s backwards compatibility feature, but did on PlayStation 3 and Wii.

Midway followed up &quot;Arcade Treasures&quot; with two compilations of additional games: &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 3&quot; in 2005. A mixture of titles from these compilations was released for PlayStation Portable in 2005 as &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play&quot;, and a Windows-exclusive combination of volumes 2 and 3 released in 2006 as &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition&quot;.

The original compilation was later re-released as Midway Arcade Treasures 1, with the title and packaging updated to match the succeeding volumes, but the lineup of games remained the same.

== Features ==
The compilation plays similarly on all three consoles, but the Xbox version has the extra ability to upload scores to an online scoreboard. The special features on each version of the game are the same. These include game histories, developer interviews and other documents. This compilation is a combination of the games included in &quot;Williams Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;Midway&#x27;s Greatest Arcade Hits&quot;, and &quot;Arcade Party Pak&quot; for the original PlayStation and PC and each contain exactly the same extras from those collections. Additionally, there are eleven more games included that are not found in those collections.

While the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions can be played on the earliest models of the PlayStation 3 and Wii respectively (due to their backwards compatibility), the Xbox version is not Xbox 360 compatible.

==Games==

The collection consists of the following 24 arcade games:

==Reception==

&quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot; received mixed, but generally positive reviews from reviewers at &quot;GameRankings&quot; with a 75.31% of the &quot;GameCube&quot; version, 73.86% of the &quot;PlayStation 2&quot; version, and 75.02% of the &quot;Xbox&quot; version. Criticisms are the poor menu layout, slowdown in &quot;Smash TV&quot;, for the documentaries and interviews having video quality that is grainy and unrestored, as well as the documentaries and interviews being rehashed from previous Midway collections.

&quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot; also received mixed and positive reviews from review aggregator &quot;Metacritic&quot;, with a score of 76 for the &quot;PlayStation 2&quot; version, a score of 74 for the &quot;Xbox&quot; version, and the lowest being a score of 72 for the &quot;GameCube&quot; version. The reviews were mostly the same as &quot;GameRankings&quot;, stating the game&#x27;s positive and negative points. Many of the complaints were based on the DVD content having poor, and stuttering quality, the menu being not pleasant to look at, and some of the games being difficult to control (with &quot;Vindicators&quot; as the main point of focus). Reviewers concluded that the collection was worth getting.

The compilation sold more than 1 million units by August 2005.

It also contains &quot;Vindicators Part II&quot;, which replaced the original &quot;Vindicators&quot; from &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;.

Another collection simply titled &quot;Midway Arcade&quot; was released for iOS devices in 2012. The compilation included 5 games from the original &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;: &quot;Defender&quot;, &quot;Joust&quot;, &quot;Rampage&quot;, &quot;Root Beer Tapper&quot;, and &quot;Spy Hunter&quot;, as well as &quot;Arch Rivals&quot; from &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot;. This compilation also included four non-proprietary arcade games: &quot;Air Hockey&quot;, &quot;Arcade Basketball&quot; (themed after &quot;Arch Rivals&quot;), &quot;Pool&quot;, and &quot;Roll Ball&quot;, as well as a redemption center where players would purchase prizes using tickets and a jukebox that allowed players to play music from their iTunes library.

Two packs containing three additional games were also purchasable from the App Store: the Action Game Pack contains &quot;A.P.B.&quot;, &quot;NARC&quot;, and &quot;Total Carnage&quot; from &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot;, while the Adventure Game Pack contains &quot;Gauntlet&quot; from the original &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;, as well as &quot;Gauntlet II&quot; and &quot;Wizard of Wor&quot; from &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot;.

<doc id="1250966" wikidata="Q1079366" url="?curid=1250966" title="Wisteria Lane">
<text>Wisteria Lane is a fictional street at the center of U.S. television drama series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; storylines primarily center on the residents of the street. The set for Wisteria Lane is located inside Universal Studios Hollywood, and is actually named Colonial Street, an area that has been used for many motion pictures and television shows. Other film and television productions in which Colonial Street has featured include the original &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; series, &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot;, and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

==Production==
In 2005, for the second season of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, the street went through some heavy changes. During the first season only one part of the street had been seen on the show – the cul-de-sac at the end of the street, known as &#x27;Circle Drive&#x27; among film crews, had been left out. Now the majority of the buildings and facades in this part of the street were either heavily remodeled or removed. Among the most noticeable changes were the removals of a church facade, seen on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, in order to make room for Edie&#x27;s house, 
and of the so-called Colonial Mansion, which was replaced by a park. In the film &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 3rd&quot; (2000) the street can clearly be seen with the shops and the church still in place around &#x27;Circle Drive&#x27;. The shot begins in circle drive at the shops then Mrs McCluskey&#x27;s, Lynette&#x27;s, Katherine&#x27;s, Bree&#x27;s, Susan&#x27;s, Mary Alice&#x27;s, Betty&#x27;s and Gaby&#x27;s are also in shot. The shot then continues into Gaby&#x27;s driveway and then down the rest of the street.
Colonial Street – including Circle Drive – has sixteen main buildings, with three of them located outside the &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; filming area. The house closest to the settings, located next to what&#x27;s called 4348 Wisteria Lane within the show, is being used by guards to stop any unauthorized access to &quot;Wisteria Lane&quot;.

The house for 4351 was strictly avoided by the &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; filming crew during season one.

==Residents==
These are the known residents of Wisteria Lane, covering episodes (1.01—5.24). Note that no residents 4348 (Drew House) and 4360 Wisteria Lane have been mentioned, although an unnamed woman, played by an uncredited actress, is seen living in no. 4360 in episode 4.02. Also in Season 2, there is a black haired woman living here. In Season 3, there is a blonde haired cheating housewife here. Also, in Season 3, Mrs McCluskey is seen reporting a man washing his pet Pig on the lawn of 4360. Most likely neighborhood big mouth Mona Clark lives here, although in Season 5 she is shown living at the Corner House.

===Changes===
Before the large changes to the set after Season One, 4360 and 4362 Wisteria Lane, as well as the park, situated around the cul-de-sac, were not shown.

Where 4360 Wisteria Lane was built, was formerly store façades and a school façade. At 4362, Edie Britt&#x27;s home, was originally a church façade that was removed. That church was seen in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (1984) as &quot;Cabot Cove&#x27;s community church&quot;. Where the park is now (see map), was previously a relatively larger home, &quot;Colonial Mansion.&quot; In season 1 Susan Mayer burns down Edie Britt&#x27;s house and there are changes to the kitchen and exterior.

Before the start of Season 4, Mike&#x27;s old house is completely remodeled. The walls around the staircase have been torn down to open up the ground floor completely. Both the upstairs and downstairs are re-wallpapered with bright reds and pastel colors. 

After the tornado in &quot;Something&#x27;s Coming&quot;, Karen McCluskey&#x27;s home was completely destroyed. A replacement blue house has been constructed in time for the fifth season. This house has a working 2nd floor. In addition to this, the former residence of Mary Alice Young has been painted green and the archway and the beginning of the house has been removed. Bree&#x27;s garage has been reconverted into her and Katherine&#x27;s test kitchen. The ground floor contains the kitchen and the top floor contains their offices. Also in season five 4350, the former home of Martha Huber and Felicia Tilman has been painted a pale yellow - green color however by the time of season six it has been restored to its original color, green.

It is revealed during &quot;Color and Light&quot; (Season 2) that Mona Clark lived at number 4360. But in season 5 and 6 we can see that she lived in 4348. She was, however, strictly a background character and was even credited at Mother #2, until her death in the Season 6 episode &quot;If...&quot;.

==Official maps==

===1989-1996 Colonial Street map===
The official website of Universal Studios Hollywood presents a map of Colonial Street, as it looked between 1989 and 1996. Besides the changes made during the first year of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, the main difference between this map and the current look of the street is that the houses known in &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as 4352 Wisteria Lane and 4354 Wisteria Lane (Mary Alice&#x27;s and Bree&#x27;s houses) replaced two older buildings in 1996.

===Mike&#x27;s map===
In episode two of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, &quot;Ah, But Underneath&quot;, a map of the street and details about its residents is seen in one of Mike&#x27;s lockers. This map confirms the location of Susan&#x27;s, Lynette&#x27;s, Gabrielle&#x27;s, Bree&#x27;s, Mary Alice&#x27;s, Mike&#x27;s and Martha Huber&#x27;s houses, as well as the existence of one house between Susan&#x27;s and Gabrielle&#x27;s, one house beyond Gabrielle&#x27;s and one house beyond Mike&#x27;s. However, it does not cover the part of the street that include the house on the far side of Martha Huber&#x27;s house, nor the buildings around the cul-de-sac, which wasn&#x27;t included in the show&#x27;s setting at the time. With two exceptions, all ten houses have the same number as otherwise stated in the series.

There are some differences between Mike&#x27;s map and the established version:
*Although most house numbers are the same as otherwise stated, there are two exceptions: The house between Susan&#x27;s and Gabrielle&#x27;s houses (later known as the Applewhite house) is noted as 4354, and Bree&#x27;s house is said to be 4359. Generally these houses are shown to be 4351 and 4354 Wisteria Lane, respectively, with Mike&#x27;s map being the only exception.
*The residents of the house between the houses of Gabrielle and of Susan are said to be Trent and Debra Nelson, although the Mullins is mentioned in the dialogue earlier in the same episode. This is the only time the Nelson&#x27;s names has occurred in the series.
*The resident of 4347 Wisteria Lane is not said to be Ida Greenberg - this character is not introduced until episode five, &quot;Come In, Stranger&quot;. Instead there are two other names noted, but too blurry to be read properly. However, Morris, their last name, is readable. Also, one of them seems to be named Gary, and they&#x27;re 42 and 38 years old respectively.
*Also to be noted is that Lynette&#x27;s daughter Penny is called Daisy on the map.

In addition, although the camera briefly passes by 4358 Wisteria Lane - the house that (starting with episode 14, &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot;) would be known as Karen McCluskey&#x27;s home - it turns away before any names are shown.

===&quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; map===
A map of Wisteria Lane is also included in the official season one companion book, &quot;Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors&quot;, published in 2005. This map does not show the house numbers but confirms the existence and location of most Wisteria Lane houses to appear on the show. The exceptions are the three buildings beyond Karen McCluskey&#x27;s house, which were not added to the shows filming location until season two. Also - while most of the houses on the map are labeled &quot;The Scavo House&quot;, &quot;The Young House&quot; etc., the houses now known as the McCluskey house, the Greenberg house and 4348 Wisteria Lane, are left without any description.

<doc id="1250973" wikidata="Q2752970" url="?curid=1250973" title="A Tale of Two Springfields">
<text>&quot;A Tale of Two Springfields&quot; is the second episode of the twelfth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and the 250th episode of the series overall in both broadcast and production order. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 5, 2000. In the episode, Homer discovers that Springfield has two different area codes and ends up leading a revolt that splits the town in two.

The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Shaun Cashman and guest starred the Who. The episode was inspired by Don Payne, based on the area where his mother lived, where one side of town would spread rumors about the other side. Larry Doyle then pitched that the two sides of Springfield would be divided because of a telephone area code. The episode features cultural references to the Who and the Norman Rockwell painting &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot;, and has received positive reviews from critics.

In November 2004, Channel 4 chose this episode to be the first episode to be broadcast on the channel, having taken the terrestrial rights to air the show from BBC Two.

==Plot==
A badger takes up residence in Santa&#x27;s Little Helper&#x27;s doghouse. After several failed attempts to lure it out (including sending in Homer, whom the badger attacks), Homer calls animal control. When he is unable to get through, Marge explains that the phone company has introduced a new area code to Springfield. Half of the town keeps the original 636 area code, the other has 939. Homer becomes infuriated when he loses out on winning tickets to see the Who live in concert to Mr. Burns in a radio show&#x27;s give-away. At a town meeting, after being shown a patronising, deflective film produced by the telephone company, Homer rallies an angry mob to protest the change, noting that the upper class side of town got to keep their area code while the poorer half were forced to switch. After failing to detonate a bomb vest he wore to the meeting, Homer then proposes that the town split into two halves, and the mob agrees.

Homer is declared mayor of New Springfield. After Homer pelts Mayor Quimby with beer cans (whilst the latter was giving a speech calling for conciliation), tensions arise between the two towns. Old Springfield businesses discriminate against customers from New Springfield, and condescend to them on the nightly news. Bart and Homer shut off the power to Old Springfield. Old Springfield hijacks a beer truck heading for New Springfield and dumps its contents in the river; Homer and New Springfield then cut off their water supply. When the lack of water reveals gold in the river bed, making Old Springfield even richer and allowing the town to purchase a French water factory, an enraged Homer has a wall built between the two towns. However, a lack of supplies and sanitation drives all of the New Springfield residents over to Old Springfield, leaving the Simpsons alone.

Bitter, Homer attempts to sabotage the Who concert in Old Springfield by convincing them to play in New Springfield instead. When the people of Old Springfield realize this, they confront the Simpsons at the wall. After a brief riot during which flaming garbage is catapulted into New Springfield, the members of the Who hear about the area code problem and suggest that the townspeople get speed dial. Pete Townshend&#x27;s opening riff from &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; crumbles the wall, and the citizens of Springfield reunite and dance to the music as the badger leads an animal invasion of the town.

==Production==

The episode was pitched by John Frink and Don Payne. The episode was inspired by Don Payne&#x27;s mother&#x27;s neighborhood, where one side would spread rumors about the other side. Larry Doyle then pitched that the sides split apart because of different area codes. During production the staff did not want one side to be slobs like Homer Simpson and the other snobs like Mr. Burns, but this ended up happening in the final product. The writers later created a website about what badgers eat.

The phone from the educational cartoon was voiced by Dan Castellaneta. Pete Townshend did not guest star in the episode as he did not know he would be providing his own voice and assumed someone else would, as in &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle and Pete&#x27;s brother Paul Townshend provided guest voices in the episode. After a number of calls were made by the show&#x27;s casting director in Los Angeles to the Who&#x27;s managers in London, the group agreed to appear on the show. The Who recorded their lines in England, but weighed in on script details. During the production the staff decided to animate Keith Moon in honor of him since he died in 1978 instead of the Who&#x27;s current drummer Zak Starkey.

===Deleted scenes===
When Roger Daltrey hits Marge with his microphone he improvised and said &quot;Shut the fuck up, Marge.&quot; This was later included in the deleted scenes on &quot;The Simpsons – The Complete Twelfth Season&quot; DVD release. In the TV broadcast version, Daltrey says &quot;Get out of the way, Marge&quot;.

==Cultural references==
The episode title is a play on the name of Charles Dickens&#x27; novel, &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. When Homer stands up in the press conference it is a reference to Norman Rockwell&#x27;s painting &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot;. When it is suggested that Homer be the mayor of New Springfield, he imagines himself in the opening sequence of &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, instead as the Mayor. The scene in which Homer and Marge take a picture is a staff in-joke about &quot;Trash of the Titans&quot; when the voice director told Bono to smile. The episode also features several references to the Who, including &quot;Magic Bus&quot; and &quot;Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy&quot;. Moe&#x27;s comment &quot;That fat, dumb, and bald guy sure plays a mean hardball&quot; is a reference to a Who song, &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;. The wall itself is a reference to the Berlin Wall, with &quot;New Springfield&quot; representing East Berlin.

The two telephone area codes used in the episode are actual area codes in the North American Numbering Plan. 636 is assigned to phone numbers in the western suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri, while 939 is primarily used by mobile phones in Puerto Rico.

==Reception==
Colin Jacobson of the DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a positive review saying &quot;Maybe it’s the low expectations that accompany 21st century Simpsons episodes, but “Tale” works for me. It takes a simple premise and turns in a good number of strong comedic bits. Hey, and a mention of “golden showers” keeps the Season 12 perverted sexual practices streak going!&quot;, although he criticized the animation of the Who other than Daltrey, saying that &quot;That’s particularly odd in the case of Pete, as he’d gone awfully bald and gray by 2000.&quot; Jennifer Malkowski of the DVD Verdict said the greatest moment was a tie between &quot;Sacred bond&quot; and &quot;Who huddle.&quot; Nancy Basile of About.com gave the episode a 5 writing &quot;Finally! I loved this episode because, flashy guest stars aside, it got back to the heart and soul of the show.&quot;

In 2007, Simon Crerar of &quot;The Times&quot; listed the Who&#x27;s performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show. There was a backlash from Internet fans who found the scene of Homer nearly getting disemboweled by the badger and showing his internal organs to Lisa to be too disgusting for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, citing the gore to be more at home in such animated shows as &quot;South Park&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

<text>Walter Shawn Browne (10 January 1949 – 24 June 2015) was an Australian-born American chess and poker player. Awarded the title Grandmaster by FIDE in 1970, he won the U.S. Chess Championship six times.

==Early years==
Browne was born to an American father and an Australian mother in Sydney. His family moved to the New York area when he was age 3. Browne moved to California in 1973.
Browne won the U.S. Junior Championship in 1966.

Browne had dual Australian and American citizenship until he was 21, and represented Australia for a short time. He won the 1969 Australian Chess Championship. He tied first with Renato Naranja while representing Australia at the 1969 Asian Zonal tournament in Singapore, earning the International Master title, though Naranja qualified for the 1970 Interzonal on tie breaks.

His zonal result earned him an invitation to an international grandmaster tournament in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, he gained the Grandmaster title by tying for 2nd–4th places, with Bruno Parma and Arthur Bisguier, behind reigning world champion Boris Spassky. He became the first Grandmaster born after World War II.

Browne played for Australia at the 1970 and 1972 Chess Olympiads, before switching to representing the United States in 1974.

==U.S. championships==

He won the U.S. Chess Championship six times. His victories were at Chicago 1974 with 9½/13, Oberlin 1975 with 8½/13, Mentor 1977 with 9/13, Greenville 1980 with 7½/12, South Bend 1981 with 9/14, and 1983 with 9/13. Of these six titles, three were shared, with three-way ties in 1980 and 1983, and a two-way split in 1981. His six titles have been exceeded only by the eight titles of Bobby Fischer, all won outright by at least a point, and Samuel Reshevsky.

==Interzonals==
Browne qualified for three Interzonal tournaments, but never came close to qualification for the Candidates Tournament. At the Manila Interzonal 1976, Browne scored 8½/19 for 15th place. At the Las Palmas Interzonal 1982, he placed last of 14 contestants with 3/13. Finally, at the Taxco Interzonal 1985, he scored 6½/15 for a tied 9–13th place.

==Olympiads==
Browne generally performed well at the Chess Olympiad in his six appearances. He represented Australia twice and the United States four times, winning a total of five medals, all bronze. He scored 55½/86 points (+40−15=31), for 64.5 percent. His detailed results, from olimpbase.org, follow.

* Siegen 1970, Australia board 1, 14/19 (+10–1=8);
* Skopje 1972, Australia board 1, 17½/22 (+15–2=5), board bronze;
* Nice 1974, United States board 3, 10½/17 (+7–3=7), team bronze;
* Buenos Aires 1978, United States board 2, 4½/9 (+3–3=3), team bronze;
* Lucerne 1982, United States board 1, 5½/10 (+4–3=3), team bronze;
* Thessaloniki 1984, United States board 4, 3½/9 (+1–3=5), team bronze.

==Other results==
Browne was a dominant presence in American chess in the 1970s and 1980s. Aside from his U.S. Championship wins, he also won the National Open eleven times, the American Open seven times, the World Open three times, and the U.S. Open Chess Championship twice (1971 and 1972).

Browne also enjoyed many international successes from the early 1970s into the mid-1980s. His international firsts include Venice 1971, Wijk aan Zee 1974, Winnipeg 1974 (Pan American Championship), Lone Pine 1974, Mannheim 1975, Reykjavík 1978, Wijk aan Zee 1980, Chile 1981, Indonesia 1982 (shared with Ron Henley in a 26-player round-robin tournament), the 1983 New York Open, Gjøvik 1983, and Naestved 1985. His chess accomplishments earned him not one but two nicknames: &quot;Six-time&quot; and &quot;King of the Swiss.&quot;

However, after dominating the U.S. Championship for a decade, Browne was unable to approach the same level in that event after 1983. In U.S. Championships, he scored just 7½/17 in 1984, 6½/13 in 1985, 6/15 in 1986, 6/13 in 1987, and 6/15 in 1989. He won the 1991 Canadian Open Chess Championship.

==Later life==
Browne was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in 2003. He won the U.S. Senior Open in June 2005. In 2012 he published an autobiography and collection of his best games, &quot;The Stress of Chess ... and its Infinite Finesse&quot;.

In December 2014, he won the Pan-American Senior Championship in the 65+ age category, held in São Paulo, Brazil. On 22 June 2015, Browne played in the 50th Anniversary National Open Chess Championship at the Westgate Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. He tied for 9th–15th. At the 2015 Las Vegas International Chess Festival, Browne also gave a 25-board simultaneous exhibition, a lecture series, and taught a chess camp. That same weekend, Browne took byes in the National Open so he could play in the 2015 Senior Event at the World Series of Poker. He played well but did not win money.

After a week of chess and poker, Browne stayed at the home of a lifelong friend in Las Vegas, and died in his sleep on 24 June 2015. He was 66. He was survived by his wife of 42 years, Dr. Raquel Browne, a clinical psychologist, their three sons, and eight grandchildren.

==Playing style==

Browne tended to spend a lot of his allotted time during the opening moves and early middlegame; consequently, he often wound up in . This sometimes led to mistakes, even though Browne played well in time trouble, and good play during this phase could unsettle his opponents. A world-class speed chess player, Browne in 1988 formed the World Blitz Chess Association, but it ended in 2004 after encountering financial troubles.

As Browne&#x27;s play improved through the 1970s, his deportment and demeanor at tournaments reportedly changed as well:With this improvement in play there also came a marked improvement in tournament etiquette and behaviour. Always noted for his fighting spirit, there had been a number of occasions when his allegedly unsporting behaviour had offended both organizers and players alike. But the new Browne, while retaining his competitive and aggressive spirit, was more amenable to tournament discipline and in consequence a more formidable grandmaster.

==Notable games==

*One of Browne&#x27;s best games, a coruscating against International Master Bernard Zuckerman:
:Browne vs. Zuckerman, New York 1973 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Be7 4.Nf3 Nf6 5.Bg5 0-0 6.e3 Nbd7 7.Bd3 dxc4 8.Bxc4 c5 9.0-0 a6 10.a4 cxd4 11.exd4 Nb6 12.Bb3 Bd7 13.Ne5 Bc6 14.Bc2 Nbd5 15.Bb1 Nb4 16.Re1 g6 17.Bh6 Re8 18.Ra3 Qd6 19.Ne2 Rad8 20.Rh3 Qd5 21.Nf3 Qa5 22.Nc3 Nbd5 23.Ne5 Nxc3 24.bxc3 Bxa4 25.Qe2 Bd7 26.Bg5 Nd5 27.Nxf7 Bxg5 28.Rxh7 Nf6 29.Bxg6 Nxh7 30.Qh5 Qxc3 31.Qxh7+ Kf8 32.Rf1 Qxd4 33.Ne5 Qf4 34.Nxd7+ Rxd7 35.Qh8+ Ke7 36.Qxe8+ Kf6 37.Qxd7 Kxg6 38.Qxe6+ Bf6 39.Qe8+ Kh6 40.g3 Qb4 41.Re1 a5 42.Re6 Qb2 43.Qf7 Kg5 44.h4+ Kg4 45.Qg6+ Kh3 46.Qf5 
*Another brilliant win, this one against grandmaster Larry Christiansen:
:Browne vs. Christiansen, U.S. Championship 1977 1.d4 e6 2.c4 b6 3.d5 Ba6 4.e4 exd5 5.exd5 Nf6 6.Nc3 Bb4 7.Qe2+ Be7 8.Qc2 c6 9.Bd3 b5 10.cxb5 cxb5 11.Nge2 b4 12.Ne4 Nxd5 13.0-0 0-0 14.Rd1 Qa5 15.N2g3 g6 16.Bh6 Re8 17.Qd2 Nf6 18.Qf4 Qb6 19.Bxa6 Nxa6 20.Rd6 Bxd6 21.Nxf6+ Kh8 22.Bg7+ Kxg7 23.Ngh5+ gxh5 24.Qg5+ Kh8 25.Qh6 Bxh2+ 26.Kh1 Qxf6 27.Qxf6+ Kg8 28.Qg5+ Kh8 29.Qf6+ Kg8 30.Qg5+ Kh8 31.Kxh2 Re6 32.Rd1 Rg8 33.Qf4 Reg6 34.g3 f6 35.Rxd7 Nc5 36.Rd6 h4 37.Qxh4 a5 38.Qd4 1–0

==Poker==
Browne was a professional poker player from the early 1970s. In 2007, he was runner up in the $2500 HORSE event of the World Series of Poker. Browne won $269,203 in live events.

<text>A charity record, charity album, or charity single is a recording with most or all proceeds raised going to a dedicated foundation or charity. In 1956, The Lord&#x27;s Taveners released a 78 rpm disc which contained six tracks donated by popular artists at the time. The record was released by The Decca Record Company and the entire profits of the record together with the royalties and fees from artists, publishers, etc., were donated to The National Playing Fields Association. This was the first charity record to make the UK charts and reached Number 2. Due to its success, it was followed by a second compilation in 1957.

George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Bangla Desh&quot; single in 1971 is commonly regarded as the first successful international charity single; it was recorded to help fund relief efforts following the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War. The money raised was donated to UNICEF, as were takings from Harrison&#x27;s Concert for Bangladesh (again, the first of its kind) held at Madison Square Garden, New York, and its spin-off live album and concert film. This is one way of using artistic talent as art for charity.

Some of the other early charity records came from the January 1979 Music for UNICEF Concert, with the likes of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Chiquitita&quot; and the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Too Much Heaven&quot; released as singles, all the royalties from which went to UNICEF. Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in November 1984 began the revolution of the charity record, which would be popularised throughout the 1980s.

In the United States, charity records reached their peak with USA for Africa&#x27;s &quot;We Are the World&quot; in 1985, but then essentially died out afterwards. In the United Kingdom, however, charity singles (especially Comic Relief), have become annual hits.

* Unlike the single by Sam Smith in 2015, the charity version of &quot;What Do I Know?&quot; was combined with the original&#x27;s sales when calculating the chart position with no official listing for Kurupt FM.

<text>The Flexner Report is a book-length landmark report of medical education in the United States and Canada, written by Abraham Flexner and published in 1910 under the aegis of the Carnegie Foundation. Flexner not only described the state of medical education in North America, but he also gave detailed descriptions of the medical schools that were operating at the time. He provided both criticisms and recommendations for improvements of medical education in the United States.

Many aspects of the present-day American medical profession stem from the &quot;Flexner Report&quot; and its aftermath. While it had many positive impacts on American medical education, the Flexner report has been criticized for introducing policies that encouraged systemic racism and sexism.

The &quot;Report&quot;, also called Carnegie Foundation Bulletin Number Four, called on American medical schools to enact higher admission and graduation standards, and to adhere strictly to the protocols of mainstream science principles in their teaching and research. The report talked about the need for revamping and centralizing medical institutions. Many American medical schools fell short of the standard advocated in the &quot;Flexner Report&quot; and, subsequent to its publication, nearly half of such schools merged or were closed outright.

Colleges for the education of the various forms of alternative medicine, such as electrotherapy, were closed. Homeopathy, traditional osteopathy, eclectic medicine, and physiomedicalism (botanical therapies that had not been tested scientifically) were derided.

The &quot;Report&quot; also concluded that there were too many medical schools in the United States, and that too many doctors were being trained. A repercussion of the &quot;Flexner Report&quot;, resulting from the closure or consolidation of university training, was the closure of all but two black medical schools and the reversion of American universities to male-only admittance programs to accommodate a smaller admission pool.

In Chapter 11, Flexner stressed that the success of medical education reform and the professionalization of medicine relied heavily on the effective legal and ethical functioning of state medical boards. However, he noted that these boards were failing in their mission, stalling progress and allowing substandard medical practices to continue, thereby jeopardizing public health. This problem persists as a significant issue in the current practice of medicine in the United States.

==Background==

During the nineteenth century, American medicine was neither economically supported nor regulated by the government. Few state licensing laws existed, and when they did exist, they were weakly enforced. There were numerous medical schools, all varying in the type and quality of the education they provided.

In 1904, the American Medical Association (AMA) created the Council on Medical Education (CME), whose objective was to restructure American medical education. At its first annual meeting, the CME adopted two standards: one laid down the minimum prior education required for admission to a medical school; the other defined a medical education as consisting of two years training in human anatomy and physiology followed by two years of clinical work in a teaching hospital. Generally speaking, the council strove to improve the quality of medical students, looking to draw from the society of upper-class, educated students.

In 1908, seeking to advance its reformist agenda and hasten the elimination of schools that failed to meet its standards, the CME contracted with the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching to survey American medical education. Henry Pritchett, president of the Carnegie Foundation and a staunch advocate of medical school reform, chose Abraham Flexner to conduct the survey. Neither a physician, a scientist, nor a medical educator, Flexner held a Bachelor of Arts degree and operated a for-profit school in Louisville, Kentucky. He visited every one of the 155 North American medical schools that were in operation at the time, all of which differed greatly in their curricula, methods of assessment, and requirements for admission and graduation. Summarizing his findings, he wrote:

The Report became notorious for its harsh description of certain establishments. For example, Flexner described Chicago&#x27;s fourteen medical schools as &quot;a disgrace to the State whose laws permit its existence . . . indescribably foul . . . the plague spot of the nation.&quot; Nevertheless, several schools received praise for excellent performance, including Western Reserve (now &quot;Case&quot; Western Reserve), Michigan, Wake Forest, McGill, Toronto, and particularly Johns Hopkins, which was described as the &#x27;model for medical education&#x27;.

The &quot;Report&quot; ultimately produced many unintended consequences, and many of the repercussions of the &quot;Report&quot; are still seen in American medicine today. Minority groups, such as African Americans and women, faced fewer opportunities as a result of the publishing of the Flexner Report. Additionally, many medical schools for alternative medicine and osteopathic medicine eventually closed as a result of the &quot;Report&quot;.

==Recommended changes==
To help with the transition and change the minds of other doctors and scientists, John D. Rockefeller gave many millions to colleges, hospitals and founded a philanthropic group called &quot;General Education Board&quot; (GEB).

In the nineteenth century, it was relatively easy to not only receive a medical education, but also to start a medical school. When Flexner researched his report, many American medical schools were small &quot;proprietary&quot; trade schools owned by one or more doctors, unaffiliated with a college or university, and run to make a profit. A degree was typically awarded after only two years of study with laboratory work and dissection optional. Many of the instructors were local doctors teaching part-time. There were very few full-time professors, dedicated to medical education. Medical schools did not receive funding, and their only money came from the students&#x27; tuitions. Regulation of the medical profession by state governments was minimal or nonexistent. American doctors varied enormously in their scientific understanding of human physiology, and the word &quot;quack&quot; was in common use.

Flexner carefully examined the situation. Using the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as the ideal medical school, he issued the following recommendations:
# Reduce both the number of medical schools (from 155 to 31) and the number of poorly trained physicians;
# Increase the prerequisites to enter medical training;
# Train physicians to practice in a scientific manner and engage medical faculty in research;
# Give medical schools control of clinical instruction in hospitals;
# Hire trained, full-time staff for medical education;
# Grant medical schools increased funding;
# Strengthen state regulation of medical licensure

Flexner expressed that he found Hopkins to be a &quot;small but ideal medical school, embodying in a novel way, adapted to American conditions, the best features of medical education in England, France, and Germany.&quot; To Flexner, Hopkins incorporated the high standards of German medical education, while keeping the American standard of high respect for patients by physicians. In his efforts to ensure that Hopkins was the standard to which all other medical schools in the United States were compared, Flexner went on to claim that all the other medical schools were subordinate in relation to this &quot;one bright spot.&quot; In addition to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Flexner also considered the medical schools at Harvard, University of Michigan, and the University of Pennsylvania to be strong schools. He said that medical schools that did not meet these high standards must change their approach to medical education or close their doors.

Flexner also believed that admission to a medical school should require, at minimum, a high school diploma and at least two years of college or university study, primarily devoted to basic science. When Flexner researched his report, in the nineteenth century, only 16 out of 155 medical schools in the United States and Canada required applicants to have completed two or more years of university education. By 1920, 92 percent of U.S. medical schools required this prerequisite of applicants. Flexner also argued that the length of medical education should be four years, and its content should be what the CME agreed to in 1905. Flexner recommended that the proprietary medical schools should either close or be incorporated into existing universities. Furthermore, he stated that medical schools needed to be part of a larger university since a proper stand-alone medical school would have to charge too much in order to break even financially.

Less known is Flexner&#x27;s recommendation that medical schools appoint full-time clinical professors. During the research of his report, Flexner noted a lack of dedicated, full-time professors. American medical education needed committed professors to teach the next generations of physicians. Holders of these appointments would become &quot;true university teachers, barred from all but charity practice, in the interest of teaching.&quot; Flexner pursued this objective for years, despite widespread opposition from existing medical faculty.

Flexner was the child of German immigrants, and he had studied and traveled in Europe extensively. He was well aware that one could not practice medicine in continental Europe without having undergone an extensive specialized university education. There were many aspects of German medical education that Flexner, along with other medical educators and physicians who had traveled to Germany, admired, such as their national standards for students and universities, academic freedom, and the expectation of postgraduate training. Furthermore, many physicians who traveled to Europe to receive postgraduate training were impressed with the German dedication to research, innovation, and teaching. In effect, Flexner demanded that American medical education conform to prevailing practice in continental Europe.

By and large, medical schools in Canada and the United States followed many of Flexner&#x27;s recommendations. However, schools have increased their emphasis on matters of public health.

=== Strengthening state regulation of medical licensure ===
Chapter 11 of the Flexner Report, &quot;The State Boards,&quot; offers a scathing critique of the medical regulatory landscape at the time, particularly focusing on the inefficacy and inconsistency of state medical boards. Flexner identifies the critical role these boards were intended to play in upholding medical education standards, both legally and ethically, but argues that they had largely failed in this responsibility.&quot;In 1906, the worst of the Chicago schools a school with no entrance requirement, no laboratory teaching, no hospital connections made before state boards the best record attained by any Chicago school in that year. This school, essentially the same now as then, has only recently been declared &quot;not in good standing&quot; with the state board of Illinois. Everywhere in Canada and the United States wretched institutions refute criticism by pointing to their successful state board records.&quot;Flexner&#x27;s broader reform plan, which aimed to elevate medical education in the United States, was fundamentally dependent on state medical boards functioning as effective gatekeepers to the profession. He insisted that state boards must rigorously ensure that only those who completed proper, standardized training could enter medical practice. From a legal standpoint, state boards were to have the authority to license practitioners, while ethically, they were responsible for maintaining the integrity of the profession by enforcing these standards.&quot;The power that validates the diploma with its license must have the strength to protect its issues against either debasement or infringement.&quot; However, Flexner&#x27;s report critiques the widespread corruption and lack of uniformity among state boards, which allowed substandard medical schools to continue operating. The boards were often controlled by political forces rather than by educational or professional considerations, leading to inconsistency in their enforcement of licensing standards. Some states maintained high standards, while others allowed almost anyone with minimal training to practice medicine.&quot;In many states appointments are regarded as political spoils; quite generally teachers are ineligible for appointment. It happens, therefore, that the boards are sometimes weak, and either unwilling to antagonize the schools or legally incapable of so doing; again, well meaning but incompetent; in some cases unquestionably neither weak nor well meaning, but cunning, powerful, and closely aligned with selfish and harmful political interests.&quot; Flexner lamented that this patchwork regulatory system undermined his vision for a unified, scientific, and ethical medical profession across the U.S. His plan relied on the boards acting as ethical watchdogs for public health and safety, but the failures of these boards to fulfill their role were highlighted as a significant barrier to achieving widespread reform.

==Impact of the report==
Many aspects of the medical profession in North America changed following the &quot;Flexner Report&quot;. Medical training adhered more closely to the scientific method and became grounded in human physiology and biochemistry. Medical research aligned more fully with the protocols of scientific research. Average physician quality significantly increased.

===Medical school closings===
Flexner wanted to improve both the admissions standards of medical school and the quality of medical education itself. He recognized that many of the medical schools had inadequate admissions requirements and a lack of adequate education. Consequently, Flexner sought to reduce the number of medical schools in the United States. A majority of American institutions granting MD or DO degrees as of the date of the &quot;Report&quot; (1910) closed within two to three decades. (In Canada, only the medical school at Western University was deemed inadequate, but none was closed or merged subsequent to the Report.) In 1904, before the &quot;Report&quot;, there were 160 MD-granting institutions with more than 28,000 students. By 1920, after the &quot;Report&quot;, there were only 85 MD-granting institutions, educating only 13,800 students. By 1935, there were only 66 medical schools operating in the United States.

Between 1910 and 1935, more than half of all American medical schools merged or closed. The dramatic decline was in some part due to the implementation of the Report&#x27;s recommendation that all &quot;proprietary&quot; schools be closed and that medical schools should henceforth all be connected to universities. Of the 66 surviving MD-granting institutions in 1935, 57 were part of a university. An important factor driving the mergers and closures of medical schools was the national regulation and enforcement of medical school criteria: All state medical boards gradually adopted and enforced the &quot;Report&quot; &#x27;s recommendations. In response to the &quot;Flexner&quot; &quot;Report&quot;, some schools fired senior faculty members as part of a process of reform and renewal.

=== Impact on the role of physician ===
The vision for medical education described in the &quot;Flexner Report&quot; narrowed medical schools&#x27; interests to disease, moving away from an interest on the system of health care or society&#x27;s health beyond disease. Preventive medicine and population health were not considered a responsibility of physicians, bifurcating &quot;health&quot; into two separate fields: scientific medicine and public health.

===Impact on African-American doctors and patients===
The &quot;Flexner Report&quot; has been criticized for introducing policies that encouraged systemic racism .

Flexner advocated for the closing of all but two of the historically black medical schools. As a result, only Howard University College of Medicine and Meharry Medical College were left open, while five other schools were closed. Flexner emphasized his view that black doctors should treat only black patients and should play roles subservient to those of white physicians. Flexner promoted the idea that African American medical students should be trained in &quot;hygiene rather than surgery&quot; and be employed as &quot;sanitarians,&quot; with a primary role to protect white Americans from disease. Flexner stated in the &quot;Report&quot;:

Furthermore, along with his adherence to germ theory, Flexner argued that, if not properly trained and treated, African-Americans posed a health threat to middle and upper-class whites. Flexner argued that African American physicians should be educated in order to stop the transmission of diseases among African Americans and to prevent the contamination of white people from those same diseases.

Flexner&#x27;s findings also restricted opportunities for African-American physicians in the medical sphere. Even the Howard and Meharry schools struggled to stay open following the &quot;Flexner Report&quot;, having to meet the institutional requirements of white medical schools, reflecting a divide in access to health care between white and African-Americans. Following the Flexner Report, African-American students sued universities, challenging the precedent set by Plessy v. Ferguson. However, those students were met by opposition from schools that remained committed to segregated medical education. It was not until 15 years after Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 that the AAMC ensured access to medical education for African-Americans and minorities by supporting the diversification of medical schools.

The closure of the five schools, and the fact that black students were not admitted to many U.S. medical schools for the 50 years following the &quot;Flexner Report&quot;, has contributed to the low numbers of American-born physicians of color as the ramifications are still felt, more than a century later. Tens of thousands of African American physicians disappeared as a result of the &quot;Flexner Report&quot;. In relation to the national Census, physicians belonging to minority groups, including African Americans, remain underrepresented in medicine.

In response to the racist writings of the &quot;Flexner Report&quot;, the AAMC decided to rename the prestigious Abraham Flexner award in 2020. David Acosta, M.D., the chief diversity and inclusion officer of AAMC, stated, &quot;We must not ignore medicine&#x27;s racist history and make every effort toward reparation when this history is identified.&quot; However, the view that Flexner and the &quot;Report&quot; were detrimental to black medical schools is largely refuted by Thomas N. Bonner, a scholar referred to as a “distinguished historian” by the AAMC. Bonner contended that Flexner worked to save the two black medical schools that were graduating most of the black physicians at that time.

=== Impact on women ===
The Flexner Report has also been criticized for introducing policies that encouraged sexism, resulting in &quot;the near elimination of women in the physician workforce between 1910 and 1970.&quot; Before the publication of the &quot;Flexner Report&quot;, in the mid-to-latter part of the nineteenth century, universities had just begun opening and expanding female admissions as part of both women&#x27;s and co-educational facilities with the founding of co-educational Oberlin College in 1833 and private all-women&#x27;s colleges such as Vassar College and Pembroke College. Furthermore, many women opened their own medical schools for women as a response to other medical schools refusing to admit them.

In the &quot;Report&quot;, Flexner noted that there were few women in medical education. Flexner believed that the small numbers of female medical students and female physicians was not due to a lack of opportunity because, as he saw it, there were ample opportunities for women to be educated in medicine. Thus, he believed that the low numbers were due to a decreased desire and tendency to enter medical school.

Flexner also emphasized women&#x27;s particular role in medicine throughout the &quot;Report&quot;, stating that &quot;[w]oman has so apparent a function in certain medical specialties&quot;. While some people thought that women were the intellectual equals of men and could be proficient in any field, the majority assumed that women were naturally nurturing and loving, and if they were going to pursue a medical career, they should do so in child health, occupational health, or maternal health.Today, it is speculated that the &quot;Report&quot; may have been a factor in encouraging female physicians to specialize in pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology rather than other disciplines.

===Impact on alternative medicine===
When Flexner researched his report, &quot;modern&quot; medicine faced vigorous competition from several quarters, including osteopathic medicine, chiropractic medicine, electrotherapy, eclectic medicine, naturopathy, and homeopathy. Flexner clearly doubted the scientific validity of all forms of medicine other than that based on scientific research, deeming any approach to medicine that did not advocate the use of treatments such as vaccines to prevent and cure illness as tantamount to quackery and charlatanism. Medical schools that offered training in various disciplines including electromagnetic field therapy, phototherapy, eclectic medicine, physiomedicalism, naturopathy, and homeopathy, were told either to drop these courses from their curriculum or lose their accreditation and underwriting support. A few schools resisted for a time, but eventually most schools for alternative medicine complied with the &quot;Report&quot; or shut their doors.

===Impact on osteopathic medicine===
While almost all the alternative medical schools listed in the &quot;Flexner Report&quot; were closed, the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) brought a number of osteopathic medical schools into compliance with Flexner&#x27;s recommendations to produce an evidence-based approach and practice. Today, the curricula of DO- and MD-awarding medical schools are now nearly identical, the chief difference being the additional instruction in osteopathic schools of osteopathic manipulative medicine.

<doc id="1251011" wikidata="Q7738576" url="?curid=1251011" title="The Gypsies (Sri Lankan band)">
<text>The Gypsies are a Sri Lankan baila band that performs Sinhala and English songs. The band was founded in the early 1970s and has since garnered a huge fan base across Sri Lanka and is one of Sri Lanka&#x27;s most famous bands. They are a highly paid band in Sri Lanka, as they constantly perform at parties, dances and at many concerts.

The band was once banned by the Government of Sri Lanka due to many of its songs carrying antigovernmental sentiments.

==History==
The band was formed in 1970 by Anton Perera, father of lead singer Sunil Perera and a confectioner working for the Glucorasa company. The band composed of his five sons- Sunil, Nihal, Piyal, Nimal and Lal- all of whom had recently completed high school. Anton Perera renovated a portion of his house on Galle Road (in Rathmalana) into a recording studio and the band began recording their first album.

Initially, the band only performed western music, but after a few years, the band began to perform Sinhala songs as well, and eventually the band members began composing their own Sinhala music. The first Sinhala songs released by the Gypsies, &quot;Linda Langa Sangamaya&quot; and &quot;Amma Amma&quot;, were released in 1973.

In the thirty years that followed, many changes have occurred in the group&#x27;s membership that have led to the eight members present today. As of today, Piyal Perera is the only living member from the original line up.

The early success of the Gypsies was thanks to a series of 5 albums released by the band in the late 1970s (entitled &quot;Dance With the Gypsies&quot;). In the 1980s the group released their first audio cassette containing their novelty hit &quot;Kurumitto&quot; (Dwarfs), which was a translated cover of Dutch musician Father Abraham&#x27;s &quot;The Smurf Song.&quot; With the arrival of CDs in Sri Lanka, the Gypsies released their first CD &quot;Gypsies Gold&quot; containing 17 songs, and following its success, the band released two more CDs, &quot;Dance With the Gypsies&quot; and &quot;Signore&quot;, which were also well received by fans.

The Gypsies have since released many other records and continue to enjoy success. Sunil Perera and the Gypsies were world-famous for their baila music. The Gypsies have also collaborated with other Sri Lankan stars like Desmond De Silva, and are credited for composing the first ever baila non-stop medley.

Their first performance outside of Sri Lanka, in Delhi, as the resident band of the Delhi Taj Hotel for three months, was followed by many more tours in other foreign countries, where many members of the Sri Lankan diaspora reside, such as the United Kingdom, Singapore, United States, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.

Corrine Almeida, the long-standing female vocalist of the group, and Sharon Nesaduray, better known as &quot;Lulu&quot;, eventually left the group. followed by Radhika Rajavellu after the departure of female vocalist Ginger (Judith White). Their last female singer, Monique Wille (Ex-Ultimate) also exited in November 2024 after 11 years of working with the Gypsies 

&quot;Buongiorno&quot; was released in 2018, which was the first hit song to be released under Gypsies label after a period of four years.

On 6 August 2021, Sunil Perera tested positive for COVID-19, and was put on oxygen after experiencing breathing difficulties. Rumors of Perera&#x27;s death began circulating on social media. In spite of his treatment, on 5 September, Perera was re-admitted to the hospital due to pneumonia and died in the early hours of 6 September 2021, one week before his 69th birthday.

The Gypsies celebrated its Golden Jubilee amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 by arranging several virtual concerts, to commemorate 50 years since the band&#x27;s formation.

<text>Rhoose ( ; , from &quot;the moor&quot;) is a village and community near the sea (the Bristol Channel) in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, near Barry. The wider community includes villages and settlements such as Font-y-Gary, Penmark, East Aberthaw and Porthkerry. The population of the community in 2011 was 6,160.

==Description==
The village is the location of Cardiff Airport, formerly RAF Rhoose. Commercial flights began in the 1950s and control passed to Glamorgan County Council in 1965, after which date the airport expanded.

The village also has a Holiday Park (Fontygary Leisure Park), some shops, a library, two public houses (The Fontygary Inn and the Highwayman), Rhoose Social Club, and an active Surf Lifesaving Club (Rhoose Lifeguards) established in 1968.

Rhoose is one of the fastest growing villages in the Vale of Glamorgan, with the three newest developments being &quot;The Hollies&quot;, and more recently, Rhoose Point, and the newest development being the affluent Golwg y Mor (Welsh for &quot;Sea View&quot;) development in the eastern part of the village. Further development of Rhoose Point was halted in 2008, because of concerns the drainage infrastructure would not cope.

Rhoose Cardiff International Airport railway station, which was scheduled to re-open in 2003, suffered numerous bureaucratic delays before eventually re-opening in June 2005. There are now hourly train services to Cardiff and Bridgend via Barry and the Vale of Glamorgan.

==Politics and administration==

Rhoose does not have its own community council but gives its name of the electoral ward of Rhoose, represented by two county councillors on the Vale of Glamorgan Council.

A by-election was due to take place on 14 February 2019. Candidates included the sitting Conservative Party Senedd Member, Andrew RT Davies. Davies was duly elected and pledged to oppose plans by the Conservative-led council to close the local primary school.

Representation has historically been shared by the Labour Party and Conservative Party.

==Notable people==
* Andrew RT Davies, lives in the community and was elected as leader of the Welsh Conservatives in 2019.
* David Gwilym John

He attended Woodrow Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach and committed to attend the University of Southern California (USC) to play college baseball for the USC Trojans.

==Career==

===San Diego Padres===
The San Diego Padres selected Burroughs in the first round, with the ninth overall selection, of the 1998 MLB draft. He signed with the Padres rather than attend USC.

Burroughs played in Minor League Baseball for the Fort Wayne Wizards and Rancho Cucamonga Quakes in 1999, the Mobile BayBears in 2000 , and the Portland Beavers in 2001. In 2000, Burroughs appeared in the All-Star Futures Game, and was named the game&#x27;s most valuable player. He also played baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics, winning the gold medal.

Burroughs made the Padres&#x27; Opening Day roster for the 2002 season. He split the season between the Padres and Portland, batting .271 with one home run and 11 runs batted in in 63 games played for the Padres and .302 for the Beavers. Burroughs became the Padres&#x27; full-time third baseman in the 2003 season, batting .286 with seven home runs. He did not develop into the power hitter that the Padres thought he could become, and the Padres demoted Burroughs to the minor leagues during the 2005 season.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays===
After the 2005 season, the Padres traded Burroughs to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in exchange for Dewon Brazelton. He batted .190 in eight games for the Devil Rays before he was optioned to the Durham Bulls, Tampa Bay&#x27;s Triple-A affiliate. The Rays released Burroughs on June 22.

===Seattle Mariners===
On December 24, 2006, Burroughs signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. He played four games for Seattle&#x27;s Triple-A affiliate, the Tacoma Rainiers, before walking away from baseball because he had lost his passion for the game. He stopped playing baseball until 2010, partly due to a drug habit.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
On November 22, 2010, Burroughs signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He had his contract purchased by Arizona on May 18, 2011, after four seasons out of the major leagues. He was placed on waivers on June 19, after hitting .261 for Arizona and outrighted to the minor leagues. After third baseman Melvin Mora was released, he was returned to Arizona&#x27;s starting lineup on July 1, 2011. Burroughs played in 20 games for the Diamondbacks as they won the National League West division title. He batted 1-for-3 during the 2011 MLB postseason as a pinch hitter and became a free agent after the season.

===Minnesota Twins===
During the 2011–12 offseason, Burroughs played in the Venezuelan Winter League, batting .316. Gene Glynn, the manager of the Minnesota Twins&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, coached Burroughs there and recommended him to the Twins, who signed him to a minor league contract. He made the major league team in spring training. The Twins designated him for assignment on May 1. In October 2012, he elected minor league free agency.

===Later career===
Burroughs signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2013 and played for the Chattanooga Lookouts, their Double-A affiliate. He played in 57 games for the Lookouts and hit .220.

Burroughs signed with the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball for 2014 season. He re-signed with the Bluefish for the 2015 season. On August 8, 2015, he was traded to the rival Long Island Ducks for outfielder Bryan Sabatella. On August 1, 2016, the Bluefish reacquired Burroughs from the Ducks in exchange for pitcher D. J. Mitchell.

==Death==
Burroughs collapsed and died of a fentanyl overdose at age 43 in a parking lot on May 9, 2024 after dropping off his son for a Little League game in Long Beach.

<doc id="1251024" wikidata="Q809009" url="?curid=1251024" title="Barry, Vale of Glamorgan">
<text>Barry (; ; ) is a town and community in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales. It is on the north coast of the Bristol Channel approximately south-southwest of Cardiff. Barry is a seaside resort, with attractions including several beaches and the resurrected Barry Island Pleasure Park. According to Office for National Statistics 2021 estimate data, the population of Barry was 56,605.

The town of Barry has absorbed its larger neighbouring villages of Cadoxton and Barry Island. It grew significantly from the 1880s with the development of Barry Docks, which, in 1913, was the largest coal port in the world.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the town&#x27;s name is disputed. It may derive from the sixth-century Saint Baruc who was buried on Barry Island where a ruined chapel was dedicated to him. Alternatively, the name may derive from Welsh &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;hill, summit&quot;. The name in Welsh includes the definite article.

==History==
===Early history===
The area now occupied by Barry has seen human activity in many periods of history. Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age microlith flint tools have been found at Friars Point on Barry Island and near Wenvoe and Neolithic or New Stone Age polished stone axe-heads were discovered in St. Andrews Major. A cinerary urn (pottery urn buried with cremation ashes) was found on Barry Island during excavations of Bronze Age barrows and two more were found in a barrow at Cold Knap Point. A large defended enclosure or Iron Age promontory hillfort was located at the Bulwarks at Porthkerry and there was evidence of the existence of an early Iron Age farmstead during construction of Barry College off Colcot Road.

In Roman times farmsteads existed on the site of Barry Castle and Biglis and there were verbal reports of discovery of a cemetery including lead coffins with scallop-shell decoration. Both St. Baruc&#x27;s Chapel and St. Nicholas Church have re-used Roman bricks and tiles incorporated in their building fabric and a Roman villa was discovered in Llandough. In 1980 a Roman building consisting of 22 rooms and cellars in four ranges around a central courtyard was excavated at Glan-y-môr and is believed to be a third-century building associated with naval activity, maybe a supply depot.

The Vikings launched raids in the area and Barry Island was known to be a raider base in 1087. Flat Holm and Steep Holm islands in the Bristol Channel have their name Holm name derived from a Scandinavian word for an island in an estuary. The excavation of the Glan-y-môr site revealed the site had been reused in the 6th and 7th century and also between AD 830 and 950 as a dry stone sub-rectangular building with a turf or thatched roof.

===Medieval Barry===
The main feature of the area at this time was the island in the Bristol Channel, separated from the mainland by a tidal estuary. It is described in Giraldus Cambrensis or Gerald of Wales&#x27; (&quot;Journey through Wales&quot;, 1191). He states that Barry derives its name from St. Baruc whose remains are deposited in a chapel on the island. The local noble family who owned the island and the adjoining estates took the name of de Barri from the island.

Following the Norman conquest of England the area was divided into manors with the Barry area split into two large lordships, Penmark and Dinas Powys. Penmark was split into the sub-manors of Fonmon, West Penmark and Barry. Dinas Powys was split into the sub-manors of Cadoxton and (&#x27;Highlight&#x27;). The sub-manor of Barry was granted by the de Umfraville family to the de Barri family and the seat of the manor was Barry Castle, located on high ground overlooking the Bristol Channel, a site occupied in Roman times by a native homestead. The castle was a small fortified manor house, built to replace an earlier earthwork. By the late 13th century the castle had two stone buildings on the east and west sides of a courtyard. Early in the 14th century the castle was strengthened by the addition of a large hall and gatehouse on its south side, the ruins of which are all that survive today. By now Barry had grown into a village and port with its own church and watermill but in the 14th century its population was drastically reduced by the Black Death and the consequences of the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr. It took the population some 300 years to recover and once more hold the title of village, essentially a sparsely populated area with a few scattered farms and much of the land a marsh that a small river flowed through. By 1622 the pattern of fields, where enclosure was almost complete, around Barry village was pretty much as it was to remain until the growth of the modern town. According to the 1673 hearth tax list the parish contained thirteen houses.

Whitehouse Cottage, the oldest existing inhabited house in modern Barry, dates from the late 1500s with the east end of the building added in around 1600. It overlooks the sea at Cold Knap.

===Industrial history===

By 1871 the population of Barry was over 100, with 21 buildings, the new estate-owning Romilly family being involved in the buildup of the village but it remained a largely agricultural community. It grew when it was developed as a coal port in the 1880s. The coal trade was growing faster than the facilities at Tiger Bay in Cardiff ever could and so a group of colliery owners formed the Barry Railway Company and chose to build the docks at Barry. Work commenced in 1884 and the first dock basin was opened in 1889 to be followed by two other docks and extensive port installations. The Barry Railway brought coal down from the South Wales Valleys to the new docks whose trade grew from one million tons in the first year, to over nine million tons by 1903. The port was crowded with ships and had flourishing ship repair yards, cold stores, flour mills and an ice factory. By 1913, Barry was the largest coal exporting port in the world. Barry Council Office and Library was completed in 1908.
Behind the docks rose the terraced houses of Barry which, with Cadoxton, soon formed a sizeable town. The railways which had played a major part in the development of the dock helped make Barry Island a popular resort. Barry Memorial Hall on Gladstone Road was inaugurated in November 1932, and obtained its name to honour those locals who lost their lives in World War I.

During its industrial peak a number of ships sank off the Barry coast.

===Barry Scrapyard===
Following the rise of diesel and electric power on the UK railways, the marshalling yards at Barry Docks became the largest repository of steam engines awaiting scrapping in the UK. Dai Woodham owned the Woodham Brothers Scrap yard and he allowed rail preservation organisations to buy back the locomotives at the scrap value, allowing around 200 of the 300 locomotives to be saved for future generations, although during the years of storage many were vandalised or looted by souvenir hunters. When interviewed just before his death, Woodham was reluctant to take full credit for this and pointed out that the town of Barry with its redundant sidings was the major factor in allowing these locomotives to be saved.

==Modern times==
Barry is the administrative centre of the Vale of Glamorgan, and home to Barry Town United F.C.

The road from Bonvilston was originally the B4266, as only Pontypridd Road within the town still is, and the road from Highlight Park right through the Vale to Bridgend was the B4265, as beyond Cardiff International Airport it still is. Since the 1970s, parts of these roads are numbered A4226, with the result that the A4226 radiates from Weycock Cross roundabout in &quot;three&quot; directions.

Although still a port, Barry is more of a manufacturing town and as a service centre for the Vale of Glamorgan. Barry Docks and the adjoining industrial area form the largest employment centre in the town. The docks, whose road links were dramatically improved with the opening of the Docks Link Road in 1981, now have direct road access with the M4 motorway. The docks can handle vessels up to 23,000 tonnes and the first-class tidal position close to the deep-water channel of the Severn Estuary, allows for scheduled sailings. With its transit sheds, warehouses and open storage, the docks are equipped to handle bulk cargoes but with the scrapping of their former electric cranes, ships’ own derricks have to be used or cranes hired in by ABP as required. Two roll on/roll off berths are available and have been used by routes to Ireland and West Africa. As at January 2016, Intermodal rail freight traffic is being operated from No. 2 Dock. With a new presence on the Mole in No. 1 Dock and the provision of a concrete slipway from it, leisure rowing and dinghy sailing is available (2016).

The town has a town council which is controlled by the Labour Party.
The majority of industrial firms are located in the dock area. The largest are the chemical producing concerns such as Cabot Carbon and Dow Corning who not long ago completed the development of the largest silicones plant in Europe. Other main employers in Barry Docks are Jewson Builders&#x27; Merchants, Western Welding and Engineering, Bumnelly, and Associated British Ports Holdings who, since 1982 have run the docks as successors to the British Transport Docks Board.

To the west of Barry is Porthkerry Park. This is a large area of open space, with woodlands, streams, and access to a pebbly beach. In the park is the former Barry Railway Company viaduct with 13 arched spans standing 110 ft high. Following the closure of the Vale of Glamorgan line to passengers between Barry and Bridgend in 1964, it was reopened on 10 June 2005 and for most of its 19 miles, provides a scenic view and link to Llantwit Major and beyond to Bridgend.

==Barry Island==
The Barry Island peninsula was an island until the 1880s when it was linked to the mainland as the town of Barry expanded. This was partly due to the opening of Barry Dock by the Barry Railway Company. Established by David Davies, the docks now link up the gap which used to form Barry Island.

There is a railway station to access the island at Barry Docks, there is also a heritage railway station which houses refurbished steam passenger trains. The railway is open to the public and holds events involving a large steam engine replica of Thomas the Tank Engine.

Barry Island is now known for its beach and Barry Island Pleasure Park. From 1966, the island was home to a Butlins Holiday camp, which was closed in 1987 and taken over by Majestic Holidays who renamed it Barry Island Resort. Between Butlins&#x27; closure and Majestic&#x27;s reopening the camp was used as for filming scenes in the &quot;Shangri-La&quot; holiday camp from the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Delta and the Bannermen&quot;. The camp closed in 1996 after Majestic had a disagreement with the local council, who refused an entertainments licence unless work was carried out to improve the now 30-year-old site. It was redeveloped for housing between 1997 and 2003 with the remaining two camp buildings and outdoor pool demolished in early 2005.

The preserved Vale of Glamorgan Railway runs on Barry Island.

The BBC sitcom &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; was filmed in many areas of Barry and Barry Island, including establishments such as Marco&#x27;s Café which feature in the show. Long-running medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot; which is filmed in Cardiff, regularly films scenes in and around Barry Island.

==Politics and administration==

===UK parliamentary constituency===
From the 1536 Act of Union, Glamorgan was represented in parliament by one member, from the constituency of Glamorganshire, elected by the freeholders in the county. In 1885, the constituency was split, with Barry represented by South Glamorganshire. The Representation of the People Act 1918 created the Llandaff and Barry constituency. Sir William Cope (Conservative) won the 1918 general election. Labour regained the seat at the 1929 general election when Charles Ellis Lloyd was returned but two years later lost the seat to the Conservatives&#x27; Patrick Munro.

After Munro&#x27;s death in 1942 Cyril Lakin won the by-election for the Conservatives. Arwyn Lynn Ungoed-Thomas (Labour) won the seat at the 1945 general election. The Llandaff and Barry constituency was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948. and replaced by the Barry parliamentary constituency. This seat was first contested in the 1950 United Kingdom general election when Dorothy Rees (Labour) was elected. She lost the seat to Sir Herbert Raymond Gower (Conservative) at the 1951 general election. He held the seat until its abolition in 1983.

It was replaced by the Vale of Glamorgan constituency which Sir Herbert Raymond Gower (Conservative) won at the 1983 general election. He remained as MP until his death in 1989. At the subsequent by-election the seat was won by John Smith (Labour). At the 1992 general election Walter Sweeney (Conservative) won it by only 19 votes. That made it the most marginal seat in Britain. John Smith won it back at the 1997 general election. In the 2010 General election there was a 6.1% swing from Labour to Conservative. This resulted in the election of Alun Cairns, a Conservative MP who has held the seat until 2024.

===Senedd (Welsh Parliament)===

Barry is part of the Vale of Glamorgan Senedd constituency and part of the South Wales Central Senedd region. Jane Hutt of the Welsh Labour Party has been the assembly member since the inception of the Senedd.

===Local councils===
Barry was incorporated as a municipal borough by royal charter in September 1939. The Borough was the successor to Barry and Cadoxton Local Board (1888–1894) and Barry Urban District Council (1894–1939). The area covered by the borough comprised Barry, Cadoxton-juxta-Barry, Merthyr Dyfan and parts of Penmark, Porthkerry and Sully. In 1974, it was abolished and its functions taken over by the Vale of Glamorgan District Council and South Glamorgan County Council.

The local council, Barry Town Council, is the largest town council in Wales. It has given Olympic silver medalist David Davies freedom of the town, the first freedom granted since 1958. The mayor since May 2017 is Nic Hodges who represents Baruc Ward and is a Plaid Cymru councillor, Barry&#x27;s first Plaid Cymru mayor. The town council has no overall control with Labour, Plaid Cymru and Conservative councillors.

The local unitary authority, created in 1995, is the Vale of Glamorgan Council which has its administrative headquarters in Barry. There are 23 wards electing 47 councillors, including eight wards in Barry (electing 18 county councillors) which comprise Baruc (2 councillors), Buttrills (2), Cadoc (3), Castleland (2), Court (2), Gibbonsdown (2), Dyfan (2) and Illtyd (3).

==Districts==

==Climate==

As with the rest of the British Isles and Wales, Barry experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters, and often high winds. It is amongst the sunnier of Welsh locations, due to its southerly and coastal position. The nearest official weather observation station is at Cardiff Airport near Rhoose, about west of the town centre.

<text>Forrest Edward Mars Sr. (March 21, 1904 – July 1, 1999) was an American billionaire businessman and the driving force of the candy company Mars Inc. He is best known for introducing Milky Way (1924) and Mars (1932) chocolate bars, and M&amp;M&#x27;s (1941) chocolate, as well as orchestrating the launch of Uncle Ben&#x27;s Rice. He was the son of the company founder Franklin Clarence Mars and his first wife Ethel G. Mars (née Kissack).

==Early life and career==
Mars was born March 21, 1904, in Wadena, Minnesota, the only child of Franklin Clarence Mars, the founder of the Mars Candy Company, and his first wife Ethel Gale Mars (née Kissack; 1882-1980). He was raised by his maternal grandparents in North Battleford Saskatchewan, Canada, after his parents&#x27; divorce when he was just a child. He rarely saw his father who remarried to Ethel Veronica Healy in 1910. He had a half sister, Patricia Mars. After high school, he entered the University of California, Berkeley, and later transferred to Yale University, where he completed a degree in industrial engineering in 1928.

As an adult, Forrest Mars reunited with his father at Mars, Inc. However, the pair ran into a disagreement when Forrest wanted to expand abroad while his father did not. For a few years he worked at the new plant in Chicago and supervised the development of the Snickers and 3 Musketeers bars. Frances Herdlinger, a newly hired chemist at the Chicago lab of Mars Inc, remembered &quot;Forrest Mars would turn up often with something new for us to try.&quot; Mars then took a buyout from his father and moved to England where he created the Mars bar and Maltesers while estranged from his father in 1933. In Europe, Mars briefly worked for Nestlé and the Tobler company.

In 1934, he bought a British company, Chappel Bros, specialized in canned meat for dogs. Due to the lack of competition, Forrest took control of this market as he launched and marketed Chappie&#x27;s canned food.

After he returned to the United States, Mars started his own food business, Food Products Manufacturing, where he established the Uncle Ben&#x27;s Rice line and a pet food business, Pedigree. In partnership later with Bruce Murrie, Mars developed M&amp;M&#x27;s, the chocolate candy covered in a crunchy shell which &quot;melts in your mouth, not in your hands,&quot; in 1940. They were possibly modeled after Smarties. Peanut M&amp;M&#x27;s were introduced in 1954 although Forrest had been allergic to peanuts his entire life. Murrie later left the business.

Following the death of his father, Forrest Mars took over the family business, Mars, Inc, merging it with his own company in 1964. 
He was married to Audrey Ruth Meyer (b. May 25, 1910, in Chicago, d. June 15, 1989, in Washington, D.C.), and they had three children – Forrest Jr., John, and Jacqueline.

Mars retired from Mars, Inc., in 1973, turning the company over to his children.

In 1980, retired and living in Henderson, Nevada, he founded Ethel M Chocolates, named after his mother. Ethel M was purchased by Mars, Inc. in 1988.

Mars died at age 95 on July 1, 1999, in Miami, Florida, having amassed a fortune of $4 billion. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked him as the 30th richest American (Forrest Jr. and John were 29th and 31st, respectively) and as the 103rd wealthiest person in the world. He left the business jointly to his three children.

Mars was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1984.

== Legacy ==
Mars had a &quot;disagreeable&quot; personality, but was highly intelligent in business practices.

<text>Michael Fitzgerald Wong Wong Man-tak (; born 16 April 1965) is a Chinese-American actor based in Hong Kong.

He is fluent in English, but not in Chinese, which is reflected in many of the characters he has portrayed. His most notable film is the 1998 film &quot;Beast Cops&quot; which won a Hong Kong Film Award with Wong in the lead role. As of 2004, he has appeared in over fifty films in twenty-one years, often in very minor roles.

==Early life==
Michael Wong was born and raised in Troy, New York, the son of restaurateur, William Wong, and an American artist of Dutch and French descent, Connie Van Yserloo (d. 2024). His brothers, Russell Wong and Declan Wong, would also become actors in the Hong Kong film industry. After finishing high school, he left to go to Hong Kong to try his luck in acting. 

There were a number of significant factors against Wong&#x27;s eventual success in the Hong Kong film industry including an inability to speak Cantonese Chinese, no formal training in acting and no background in martial arts. He also lacked an entry into the tightly knit in the Hong Kong film industry.

== Career ==
His debut was in 1985&#x27;s &quot;City Hero&quot;, then in 1986 he was cast in his first major role, &quot;Legacy of Rage&quot; alongside Brandon Lee. His next significant film was &quot;Royal Warriors&quot; a.k.a. &quot;In the Line of Duty&quot;, which established his dominant image for the first part of his career as a naive but tough outsider. 

He made his English language movie debut in James Hong&#x27;s &quot;The Vineyard&quot; in 1989.

&quot;Final Option&quot;, released in 1994, would make Wong a major star in the Chinese film industry. Playing the role of a police officer, Stone Wong, he established a tougher image.

In 1995, he starred alongside Jackie Chan in &quot;Thunderbolt.&quot;

In 1996, he reappeared as Stone Wong in the prequel &quot;First Option&quot; for which he would be nominated for both a Hong Kong Film Award and a Golden Horse Award. Also that year, Wong starred in the Canadian TV production &quot;Once A Thief&quot; directed by John Woo. 

His starring role in &quot;Beast Cops&quot;, which won a 1998 Best Film prize at the Hong Kong film awards, further consolidated his position. Also that year he acted with Shannon Lee in &quot;Enter the Eagles&quot;, and played the role of a detective in the Jean-Claude Van Damme film, &quot;Knock Off&quot;.

In 2000, Wong made his debut as a director in &quot;Miles Apart&quot;, which he also produced and starred in. He has continued to work in the Hong Kong film industry, though more often as a supporting player rather than a leading man, in productions such as Cold War, Skiptrace and Triple Threat.

In the 2002 movie &quot;New Option,&quot; he reprised the role of Stone Wong.

In 2006, Wong re-entered the music scene by performing &quot;big band&quot; music accompanied by a 10 piece band with the likes of &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;.

==Personal life==
Wong married Hong Kong supermodel Janet Ma in 1992 and they had two daughters, Kayla Wong and Irisa Shannon Wong, and one son, Kadin Miles Wong.

Wong is a keen helicopter enthusiast, having held a pilot&#x27;s license since 1998. In 2008, he was serving a term as President of the Hong Kong Helicopter Club.

<doc id="1251051" wikidata="Q18510948" url="?curid=1251051" title="Carnotaurus">
<text>Carnotaurus (; ) is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in South America during the Late Cretaceous period, probably sometime between 72 and 69 million years ago. The only species is Carnotaurus sastrei. Known from a single well-preserved skeleton, it is one of the best-understood theropods from the Southern Hemisphere. The skeleton, found in 1984, was uncovered in the Chubut Province of Argentina from rocks of the La Colonia Formation. &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; is a derived member of the Abelisauridae, a group of large theropods that occupied the large predatorial niche in the southern landmasses of Gondwana during the late Cretaceous. Within the Abelisauridae, the genus is often considered a member of the Brachyrostra, a clade of short-snouted forms restricted to South America.

&quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was a lightly built, bipedal predator, measuring in length and weighing . As a theropod, &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was highly specialized and distinctive. It had two thick horns above the eyes, a unique feature unseen in all other carnivorous dinosaurs, and a very deep skull sitting on a muscular neck. &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was further characterized by small, vestigial forelimbs and long, slender hind limbs. The skeleton is preserved with extensive skin impressions, showing a mosaic of small, non-overlapping scales approximately 5 mm in diameter. The mosaic was interrupted by large bumps that lined the sides of the animal, and there are no hints of feathers.

The distinctive horns and the muscular neck may have been used in fighting others of its species. According to separate studies, rivaling individuals may have combated each other with quick head blows, by slow pushes with the upper sides of their skulls, or by ramming each other head-on, using their horns as shock absorbers. The feeding habits of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; remain unclear: some studies suggested the animal was able to hunt down very large prey such as sauropods, while other studies found it preyed mainly on relatively small animals. Its brain cavity suggests an acute sense of smell, while hearing and sight were less well developed. &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was probably well adapted for running and was possibly one of the fastest large theropods.

==Discovery==

The only skeleton (holotype MACN-CH 894) was unearthed in 1984 by an expedition led by Argentinian paleontologist José Bonaparte. This expedition also recovered the peculiar spiny sauropod &quot;Amargasaurus&quot;. It was the eighth expedition within the project named &quot;Jurassic and Cretaceous Terrestrial Vertebrates of South America&quot;, which started in 1976 and was sponsored by the National Geographic Society. The skeleton is well-preserved and (still connected together), with only the posterior two thirds of the tail, much of the lower leg, and the hind feet being destroyed by weathering. The skeleton belonged to an adult individual, as indicated by the fused sutures in the . It was found lying on its right side, showing a typical death pose with the neck bent back over the torso. Unusually, it is preserved with extensive skin impressions. In view of the significance of these impressions, a second expedition was started to reinvestigate the original excavation site, leading to the recovery of several additional skin patches. The skull was deformed during fossilization, with the snout bones of the left side displaced forwards relative to the right side, the nasal bones pushed upwards, and the pushed backwards onto the . Deformation also exaggerated the upward curvature of the upper jaw. The snout was more strongly affected by deformation than the rear part of the skull, possibly due to the higher rigidity of the latter. In top or bottom view, the upper jaws were less U-shaped than the lower jaws, resulting in an apparent mismatch. This mismatch is the result of deformation acting from the sides, which affected the upper jaws but not the lower jaws, possibly due to the greater flexibility of the joints within the latter.
The skeleton was collected on a farm named &quot;Pocho Sastre&quot; near Bajada Moreno in the Telsen Department of Chubut Province, Argentina. Because it was embedded in a large hematite concretion, a very hard kind of rock, preparation was complicated and progressed slowly. In 1985, Bonaparte published a note presenting &quot;Carnotaurus sastrei&quot; as a new genus and species and briefly describing the skull and lower jaw. The generic name &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; is derived from the Latin carno [carnis] (&quot;flesh&quot;) and taurus (&quot;bull&quot;) and can be translated with &quot;meat-eating bull&quot;, an allusion to the animal&#x27;s bull-like horns. The specific name &quot;sastrei&quot; honors Angel Sastre, the owner of the ranch where the skeleton was found. A comprehensive description of the whole skeleton followed in 1990. After &quot;Abelisaurus&quot;, &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was the second member of the family Abelisauridae that was discovered. For years, it was by far the best-understood member of its family, and also the best-understood theropod from the Southern Hemisphere. It was not until the 21st century that similar well-preserved abelisaurids were described, including &quot;Aucasaurus&quot;, &quot;Majungasaurus&quot; and &quot;Skorpiovenator&quot;, allowing scientists to re-evaluate certain aspects of the anatomy of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;. The holotype skeleton is displayed in the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences, Bernardino Rivadavia; replicas can be seen in this and other museums around the world. Sculptors Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas manufactured a life-sized sculpture of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; that was previously on display at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This sculpture, ordered by the museum during the mid-1980s, is probably the first life restoration of a theropod showing accurate skin.

==Description==

&quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was a large but lightly built predator. The only known individual was about in length, making &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; one of the largest abelisaurids. &quot;Ekrixinatosaurus&quot; and possibly &quot;Abelisaurus&quot;, which are highly incomplete, might have been similar or larger in size. A 2016 study found that only &quot;Pycnonemosaurus&quot;, at , was longer than &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;; it was estimated at . Its mass is estimated to have been , , , , and in separate studies that used different estimation methods. &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was a highly specialized theropod, as seen especially in characteristics of the skull, the vertebrae and the forelimbs. The pelvis and hind limbs, on the other hand, remained relatively conservative, resembling those of the more basal &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. Both the pelvis and hind limb were long and slender. The left (thigh bone) of the individual measures 103 cm in length, but shows an average diameter of only 11 cm.

===Skull===

The skull, measuring in length, was proportionally shorter and deeper than in any other large carnivorous dinosaur. The snout was moderately broad, not as tapering as seen in more basal theropods like &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, and the jaws were curved upwards. A prominent pair of horns protruded obliquely above the eyes. These horns, formed by the frontal bones, were thick and cone-shaped, internally solid, somewhat vertically flattened in cross-section, and measured in length. Bonaparte, in 1990, suggested that these horns would probably have formed the bony cores of much longer keratinous sheaths. Mauricio Cerroni and colleagues, in 2020, agreed that the horns supported keratinous sheaths, but argued that these sheaths would not have been greatly longer than the bony cores.

As in other dinosaurs, the skull was perforated by six major skull openings on each side. The frontmost of these openings, the (bony nostril), was subrectangular and directed sidewards and forwards, but was not sloping in side view as in some other ceratosaurs such as &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. This opening was formed by the nasal and premaxilla only, while in some related ceratosaurs the maxilla also contributed to this opening. Between the bony nostril and the orbit (eye opening) was the antorbital fenestra. In &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;, this opening was higher than long, while it was longer than high in related forms such as &quot;Skorpiovenator&quot; and &quot;Majungasaurus&quot;. The antorbital fenestra was bounded by a larger depression, the , which was formed by recessed parts of the maxilla in front and the behind. As in all abelisaurids, this depression was small in &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;. The lower front corner of the antorbital fossa contained a smaller opening, the , which led into an air-filled cavity within the maxilla. The eye was situated in the upper part of the keyhole-shaped orbit. This upper part was proportionally small and subcircular, and separated from the lower part of the orbit by the forward-projecting . It was slightly rotated forward, probably permitting some degree of binocular vision. The keyhole-like shape of the orbit was possibly related to the marked skull shortening, and is also found in related short-snouted abelisaurids. As in all abelisaurids, the (on the skull roof between the eyes) was excluded from the orbit. Behind the orbit were two openings, the on the side and the on the top of the skull. The infratemporal fenestra was tall, short, and kidney-shaped, while the supratemporal fenestra was short and square-shaped. Another opening, the , was located in the lower jaw – in &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;, this opening was comparatively large.
On each side of the upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth, while the lower jaws were equipped with fifteen dentary teeth per side. The teeth had been described as being long and slender, as opposed to the very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids. However, Cerroni and colleagues, in their 2020 description of the skull, stated that all erupted teeth have been severely damaged during excavation and were later reconstructed with plaster (Bonaparte, in 1990, only noted that some lower jaw teeth had been fragmented). Reliable information on the shape of the teeth is therefore limited to replacement teeth and tooth roots that are still enclosed by the jaw, and can be studied using CT imaging. The replacement teeth had low, flattened crowns, were closely spaced, and inclined forwards at approximately 45°. In his 1990 description, Bonaparte noted that the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed, with the (the foremost jaw bone) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points; this contrasts to the robust-looking skull. Cerroni and colleagues instead found multiple but loose connections between the dentary and the hindmost jaw bones. This articulation, therefore, was very flexible but not necessarily weak. The bottom margin of the dentary was convex, while it was straight in &quot;Majungasaurus&quot;.
The lower jaw was found with ossified hyoid bones, in the position they would be in if the animal was alive. These slender bones, supporting the tongue musculature and several other muscles, are rarely found in dinosaurs because they are often cartilaginous and not connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily. In &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;, three hyoid bones are preserved: a pair of curved, rod-like ceratobranchials that articulate with a single, trapezoidal element, the basihyal. &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; is the only known non-avian theropod from which a basihyal is known. The back of the skull had well-developed, air-filled chambers surrounding the braincase, as in other abelisaurids. Two separate chamber systems were present, the paratympanic system, which was connected to the middle ear cavity, as well as chambers resulting from outgrowths of the air sacs of the neck.

A number of autapomorphies (distinguishing features) can be found in the skull, including the pair of horns and the very short and deep skull. The maxilla had excavations above the promaxillary fenestra, which would have been excavated by the antorbital air sinus (air passages in the snout). The nasolacrimal duct, which transported eye fluid, exited on the medial (inner) surface of the lacrimal through a canal of uncertain function. Other proposed autapomorphies include a deep and long, air-filled excavation in the and an elongated depression on the of the .

===Vertebrae===

The vertebral column consisted of ten cervical (neck), twelve dorsal, six fused sacral and an unknown number of caudal (tail) vertebrae. The neck was nearly straight, rather than having the S-curve seen in other theropods, and also unusually wide, especially towards its base. The top of the neck&#x27;s spinal column featured a double row of enlarged, upwardly directed bony processes called epipophyses, creating a smooth trough on the top of the neck vertebrae. These processes were the highest points of the spine, towering above the unusually low spinous processes. The epipophyses probably provided attachment areas for a markedly strong neck musculature. A similar double row was also present in the tail, formed there by highly modified caudal ribs, in front view protruding upwards in a V-shape, their inner sides creating a smooth, flat, top surface of the front tail vertebrae. The end of each caudal rib was furnished with a forward projecting hook-shaped expansion that connected to the caudal rib of the preceding vertebra.

===Forelimbs===

The forelimbs were proportionally shorter than in any other large carnivorous dinosaurs, including tyrannosaurids. The forearm was only a quarter the size of the upper arm. There were no carpalia in the hand, so that the metacarpals articulated directly with the forearm. The hand showed four basic digits, though apparently only the middle two of these ended in finger bones, while the fourth consisted of a single splint-like metacarpal that may have represented an external &#x27;spur&#x27;. The fingers themselves were fused and immobile, and may have lacked claws. &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; differed from all other abelisaurids in having proportionally shorter and more robust forelimbs, and in having the fourth, splint-like metacarpal as the longest bone in the hand. A 2009 study suggests that the arms were vestigial in abelisaurids, because nerve fibers responsible for stimulus transmission were reduced to an extent seen in today&#x27;s emus and kiwis, which also have vestigial forelimbs.

===Skin===
&quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was the first theropod dinosaur discovered with a significant number of fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton&#x27;s right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, the right side of the skull also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. However, the surface texture of several skull bones allows for inferences on their probable covering. A hummocky surface with grooves, pits, and small openings is found on the sides and front of the snout and indicates a scaly covering, possibly with flat scales as in today&#x27;s crocodilians. The top of the snout was sculptured with numerous small holes and spikes – this texture can probably be correlated with a cornified pad (horny covering). Such a pad also occurred in &quot;Majungasaurus&quot; but was absent in &quot;Abelisaurus&quot; and &quot;Rugops&quot;. A row of large scales did probably surround the eye, as indicated by a hummocky surface with longitudinal grooves on the lacrimal and postorbital bones.

The skin was built up of a mosaic of polygonal, non-overlapping scales measuring approximately in diameter. This mosaic was divided by thin, parallel grooves. Scalation was similar across different body parts with the exception of the head, which apparently showed a different, irregular pattern of scales. There is no evidence of feathers. Larger bump-like structures were distributed over the sides of the neck, back and tail in irregular rows. These bumps were in diameter and up to in height and often showed a low midline ridge. They were set apart from each other and became larger towards the animal&#x27;s top. The bumps probably represent feature scales – clusters of condensed scutes – similar to those seen on the soft frill running along the body midline in hadrosaurid (&quot;duck-billed&quot;) dinosaurs. These structures did not contain bone. Stephen Czerkas (1997) suggested that these structures may have protected the animal&#x27;s sides while fighting members of the same species (conspecifics) and other theropods, arguing that similar structures can be found on the neck of the modern iguana where they provide limited protection in combat.

More recent studies of the skin of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; published in 2021 suggest that previous depictions of the scales on the body are inaccurate, and the larger feature scales were randomly distributed along the body, not distributed in discrete rows like in older artistic depictions and illustrations. There is also no sign of progressive size variation in feature scales along different areas along the body. The basement scales of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; were by comparison highly variable, ranging in size from small and elongated, to large and polygonal, and from circular-to-lenticular in the thoracic, scapular, and tail regions, respectively. This scale differentiation may have been related to regulating body heat and shedding excess heat via thermoregulation due to its large body size and active lifestyle.

==Classification==

&quot;Carnotaurus&quot; is one of the best-understood genera of the Abelisauridae, a family of large theropods restricted to the ancient southern supercontinent Gondwana. Abelisaurids were the dominant predators in the Late Cretaceous of Gondwana, replacing the carcharodontosaurids and occupying the ecological niche filled by the tyrannosaurids in the northern continents. Several notable traits that evolved within this family, including shortening of the skull and arms as well as peculiarities in the cervical and caudal vertebrae, were more pronounced in &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; than in any other abelisaurid.

Though relationships within the Abelisauridae are debated, &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; is consistently shown to be one of the most derived members of the family by cladistical analyses. Its nearest relative might have been &quot;Aucasaurus&quot; or &quot;Majungasaurus&quot;. A 2008 review, in contrast, suggested that &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was not closely related to either genus, and instead proposed &quot;Ilokelesia&quot; as its sister taxon. Juan Canale and colleagues, in 2009, erected the new clade Brachyrostra to include &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; but not &quot;Majungasaurus&quot;; this classification has been followed by a number of studies since.

&quot;Carnotaurus&quot; is eponymous for two subgroups of the Abelisauridae: the Carnotaurinae and the Carnotaurini. Paleontologists do not universally accept these groups. The Carnotaurinae was defined to include all derived abelisaurids with the exclusion of &quot;Abelisaurus&quot;, which is considered a basal member in most studies. However, a 2008 review suggested that &quot;Abelisaurus&quot; was a derived abelisaurid instead. Carnotaurini was proposed to name the clade formed by &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; and &quot;Aucasaurus&quot;; only those paleontologists who consider &quot;Aucasaurus&quot; as the nearest relative of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; use this group. A 2024 study recovered Carnotaurini as a valid clade consisting of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;, &quot;Aucasaurus&quot;, &quot;Niebla&quot; and &quot;Koleken&quot;.

Below is a cladogram published by Canale and colleagues in 2009.

==Paleobiology==

===Function of the horns===

&quot;Carnotaurus&quot; is the only known carnivorous bipedal animal with a pair of horns on the frontal bone. The use of these horns is not entirely clear. Several interpretations have revolved around use in fighting conspecifics or in killing prey, though a use in display for courtship or recognition of members of the same species is possible as well.

Greg Paul (1988) proposed that the horns were butting weapons and that the small orbita would have minimized the possibility of hurting the eyes while fighting. Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) suggested that &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; used its horns in a way similar to rams. They calculated that the neck musculature was strong enough to absorb the force of two individuals colliding with their heads frontally at a speed of 5.7 m/s each. Fernando Novas (2009) interpreted several skeletal features as adaptations for delivering blows with the head. He suggested that the shortness of the skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing the moment of inertia, while the muscular neck would have allowed strong head blows. He also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of the spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by the head and neck.

Other studies suggest that rivaling &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls. Mazzetta and colleagues, in 2009, argued that the horns may have been a device for the distribution of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns, the strongly fused bones of the top of the skull, and the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows. Rafael Delcourt, in 2018, suggested that the horns could have been used either in slow headbutting and shoving, as seen in the modern marine iguana, or in blows to the opponent&#x27;s neck and flanks, as seen in the modern giraffe. The latter possibility had been previously proposed for the related &quot;Majungasaurus&quot; in a 2011 conference paper.

Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) propose that the horns might also have been used to injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have had a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, this would be the only reported example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.

===Jaw function and diet===

Analyses of the jaw structure of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; by Mazzetta and colleagues, in 1998, 2004, and 2009, suggest that the animal was capable of quick bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites are more important than strong bites when capturing small prey, as shown by studies of modern-day crocodiles. These researchers also noted a high degree of flexibility (kinesis) within the skull and especially the lower jaw, somewhat similar to modern snakes. Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; to swallow small prey items whole. In addition, the front part of the lower jaw was hinged, and thus able to move up and down. When pressed downwards, the teeth would have projected forward, allowing &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; to spike small prey items; when the teeth were curved upwards, the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping. Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items. &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey, but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs. In 2009, Mazzetta and colleagues estimated a bite force of around 3,341 newtons. A 2022 study estimating bite force for 33 different dinosaurs suggests that the bite force in &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was around 3,392 newtons at the anterior portion of the jaws; slightly higher than the previous estimate. The posterior bite force at the back of the jaws meanwhile, was estimated at 7,172 newtons.

This interpretation was questioned by François Therrien and colleagues (2005), who found that the biting force of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was twice that of the American alligator, which may have the strongest bite of any living tetrapod. These researchers also noted analogies with modern Komodo dragons: the flexural strength of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly, indicating that the jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey. As a consequence, according to this study, &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; must have mainly preyed upon large animals, possibly by ambush. Cerroni and colleagues, in 2020, argued that flexibility was restricted to the lower jaw, while the thickened skull roof and the ossification of several cranial joints suggest that the skull had no or only little kinesis.

Robert Bakker (1998) found that &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; mainly fed upon very large prey, especially sauropods. As he noted, several adaptations of the skull—the short snout, the relatively small teeth and the strong back of the skull (occiput)—had independently evolved in &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. These features suggest that the upper jaw was used like a serrated club to inflict wounds; big sauropods would have been weakened by repeated attacks.

===Locomotion===

Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 1999) presumed that &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was a swift runner, arguing that the thigh bone was adapted to withstand high bending moments while running; The ability of an animal&#x27;s leg to withstand those forces limits its top speed. The running adaptations of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; would have been better than those of a human, although not nearly as good as those of an ostrich. Scientists calculate that Carnotaurus had a top speed of up to per hour.

In dinosaurs, the most important locomotor muscle was located in the tail. This muscle, called the caudofemoralis, attaches to the fourth trochanter, a prominent ridge on the thigh bone, and pulls the thigh bone backwards when contracted. Scott Persons and Phil Currie (2011) argued that in the tail vertebrae of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;, the caudal ribs did not protrude horizontally (&quot;T-shaped&quot;), but were angled against the vertical axis of the vertebrae, forming a &quot;V&quot;. This would have provided additional space for a caudofemoralis muscle larger than in any other theropod—the muscle mass was calculated at per leg. Therefore, &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; could have been one of the fastest large theropods. While the caudofemoralis muscle was enlarged, the epaxial muscles situated above the caudal ribs would have been proportionally smaller. These muscles, called the longissimus and spinalis muscle, were responsible for tail movement and stability. To maintain tail stability in spite of reduction of these muscles, the caudal ribs bear forward projecting processes interlocking the vertebrae with each other and with the pelvis, stiffening the tail. As a consequence, the ability to make tight turns would have been diminished, because the hip and tail had to be turned simultaneously, unlike in other theropods.

===Brain and senses===
Cerroni and Paulina-Carabajal, in 2019, used a CT scan to study the endocranial cavity that contained the brain. The volume of the endocranial cavity was 168.8 cm3, although the brain would only have filled a fraction of this space. The authors used two different brain size estimates, assuming a brain size of 50% and 37% of the endocranial cavity, respectively. This results in a reptile encephalization quotient (a measure of intelligence) larger than that of the related &quot;Majungasaurus&quot; but smaller than in tyrannosaurids. The pineal gland, which produces hormones, might have been smaller than in other abelisaurids, as indicated by a low dural expansion – a space on top of the forebrain in which the pineal gland is thought to have been located.

The olfactory bulbs, which housed the sense of smell, were large, while the optic lobes, which were responsible for sight, were relatively small. This indicates that the sense of smell might have been better developed than the sense of sight, while the opposite is the case in modern birds. The front end of the olfactory tracts and bulbs were curved downwards, a feature only shared by &quot;Indosaurus&quot;; in other abelisaurids, these structures were oriented horizontally. As hypothesized by Cerroni and Paulina-Carabajal, this downward-curvature, together with the large size of the bulbs, might indicate that &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; relied more on the sense of smell than other abelisaurids. The flocculus, a brain lobe thought to be correlated with gaze stabilization (coordination between eyes and body), was large in &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; and other South American abelisaurids. This could indicate that these forms frequently used quick movements of the head and body. Hearing might have been poorly developed in &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; and other abelisaurids, as indicated by the short lagena of the inner ear. The hearing range was estimated to be below 3 kHz.

==Age and paleoenvironment==
Originally, the rocks in which &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; was found were assigned to the upper part of the Gorro Frigio Formation, which was considered to be approximately 100 million years old (Albian or Cenomanian stage). Later, they were realized to pertain to the much younger La Colonia Formation, dating to the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages (83.6 to 66 million years ago). Novas, in a 2009 book, gave a narrower time span of 
72 to 69.9 million years ago (lower Maastrichtian stage). &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; therefore was the latest South American abelisaurid known. By the Late Cretaceous, South America was already isolated from both Africa and North America.

The La Colonia Formation is exposed over the southern slope of the North Patagonian Massif. Most vertebrate fossils, including &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;, come from the formation&#x27;s middle section (called the &quot;middle facies association&quot;). This part likely represents the deposits of an environment of estuaries, tidal flats or coastal plains. The climate would have been seasonal with both dry and humid periods. The most common vertebrates collected include ceratodontid lungfish, turtles, plesiosaurs, crocodiles, dinosaurs, lizards, snakes and mammals. Other dinosaurs include &quot;Koleken inakayali&quot;, which is closely related to &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;; the saltasauroid titanosaur &quot;Titanomachya gimenezi&quot;; an unnamed ankylosaur; and an unnamed hadrosauroid, among others. Some of the snakes that have been found belong to the families Boidae and Madtsoidae, such as &quot;Alamitophis argentinus&quot;. Turtles are represented by at least five taxa, four from Chelidae (Pleurodira) and one from Meiolaniidae (Cryptodira). Plesiosaurs include two elasmosaurs (&quot;Kawanectes&quot; and &quot;Chubutinectes&quot;) and a polycotylid (&quot;Sulcusuchus&quot;). Mammals are represented by &quot;Reigitherium bunodontum&quot; and &quot;Coloniatherium cilinskii&quot;, the former of which was considered the first record of a South American docodont, and the possible gondwanatherians or multituberculates &quot;Argentodites coloniensis&quot; and &quot;Ferugliotherium windhauseni&quot;. Remains of an enantiornithine and, possibly, of a neornithine bird have been discovered.

<doc id="1251052" wikidata="Q1931479" url="?curid=1251052" title="Aliens Versus Predator 2">
<text>Aliens Versus Predator 2 is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by Monolith Productions and co-published by Fox Interactive and Sierra On-Line for Microsoft Windows in October 2001, and for Mac OS X in July 2003. The game is a sequel to &quot;Aliens Versus Predator&quot; (1999); both games are based on the characters of the &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot; media franchises as well as the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; crossover series. It is set on the fictional planet LV-1201, which houses a vast series of ruins infested with Aliens that is routinely visited by a clan of Predators who hunt the creatures for sport.

The game is played from a first-person perspective. In the single-player mode, players control one of three characters, each with their own abilities and individual story modes. An online multiplayer mode, which allows players to play as one of four teams in competitive modes, is no longer officially supported and requires a community developed patch to enable multiplayer.

An expansion pack titled &quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt&quot; was released in 2002. A &quot;Gold Edition&quot; of &quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2&quot; followed, combining both the original game and the expansion pack into a single package. There were never any plans for a sequel, but in 2010, Rebellion Developments made a reboot simply titled &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot;.

==Gameplay==
Like its predecessor, &quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2&quot; allows the player to choose one of three characters: an Alien, Predator, or human Colonial Marine. Each character has different objectives, abilities and weapons at their disposal. The single-player campaigns present the player with a conventional series of levels that are designed around the abilities of each species.

As an Alien the player can explore most of the game&#x27;s environments freely, even climbing across walls and ceilings. However, the Alien has no weapons and must use its claws, tail, and jaws to attack enemies. The player can also use a form of echolocation in dark areas and can detect pheromones to discern human or Predator enemies. The Alien can drop from any height without injury and is the fastest of the three player characters.

When playing as the Predator, the player uses a variety of weapons from the &quot;Predator&quot; films such as wrist blades, a throwing disc, and shoulder-mounted energy weapons. The Predator is more durable than the human or the Alien and can survive falls from greater heights than the human. It can use a cloaking device to become invisible and several different modes of vision to help in the detection of enemies, including infrared vision and a mode sensitive to electrical systems. Unlike in the previous game, the Predator in &quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2&quot; recharges its energy supply using a personal item.

As the Colonial Marine, the player uses a number of weapons to combat Aliens and Predators. The Marine wears armor for protection, and uses an image intensifier, flashlight, and flares to improve visibility in dark areas.

===Multiplayer===
&quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2&quot; has several multiplayer modes which can be played through an internet or local area network connection. In each game the player chooses one of four teams to play as: The Aliens, Predators, Marines, or corporate mercenaries (called &quot;Iron Bears&quot; in the game&#x27;s storyline). Each team has unique abilities, advantages, and disadvantages. The Aliens are able to scale walls and ceilings and the Predators can become invisible, while the two human teams have a large array of heavy weapons as well as motion trackers.

There are six different multiplayer &quot;modes&quot; played on a number of &quot;maps&quot;. &quot;Deathmatch&quot; mode is a free-for-all match in which the player&#x27;s goal is to accumulate the highest number of kills. &quot;Team Deathmatch&quot; has the same goal except that the player is teamed with other players of the same species (or faction, in the case of the Colonial Marines and the Corporate Mercenaries). In &quot;Hunt&quot; there are two teams, one designated as the &quot;hunter&quot; and the other as the &quot;prey&quot;; the hunters accumulate points by killing the prey, while the prey can themselves become hunters by killing members of the hunter team. &quot;Survivor&quot; mode designates all players as &quot;defenders&quot; at the start; if a player is killed they become a &quot;mutant&quot; and can then earn points by killing defenders. Defenders gain points by staying alive without becoming mutants. &quot;Overrun&quot; is a timed match between two teams that is similar to &quot;Survivor&quot; except that each player has a finite number of lives; at the end of the round points are awarded based on the number of surviving members on each team. &quot;Evacuation&quot; is another two-team match with a finite number of lives, in which one team is designated as the &quot;attackers&quot; and the other as &quot;defenders&quot;. The attacking team wins by killing all of the defenders, while the defending team wins by locating the map&#x27;s evacuation point and having at least one member survive within it for ten seconds.

In November 2008, Sierra Entertainment shut down multiplayer functionality for the game. In 2008, a community project titled the Master Server Patch was launched that allowed players to modify the game to restore multiplayer functionality.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
The story of &quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2&quot; largely takes place in the year 2231, approximately 52 years after the events of both &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Alien 3&quot;. Humanity has established an outpost on the planet LV-1201. The research colony consisted of two major installations: the Primary Operations Complex (POC), designed with the same &quot;shake and bake&quot; architecture seen at Hadley&#x27;s Hope in &quot;Aliens&quot;; and the Forward Observation Pods, a set of four (originally five) scientific research facilities suspended over a canyon by a network of trellises, with an internal design style reminiscent of the &quot;Nostromo&quot; from &quot;Alien&quot;. A garrison of corporate mercenaries known as the Iron Bears, led by the mercenary general Vassili Rykov, provides security while Dr. Eisenberg runs the science division.

The plot revolves around &quot;The Incident&quot;, an event which occurred shortly after 5:18 AM, on November 25, 2230, in which a fight between a Xenomorph (the player character in the game&#x27;s Alien storyline) and a Predator resulted in the Predator activating its self-destruct device, causing massive damage to the Primary Operations Complex and allowing it to be overrun with Xenomorphs. Since the POC was the communications link between the Forward Observation Pods and the rest of the galaxy, this leaves the survivors at the Pods stranded and unable to call for help. Six weeks later, the Colonial Marines are sent to investigate what happened. Different parts of each campaign take place anywhere from 1 day and 7 hours &quot;before&quot; The Incident to more than six weeks after.

It is later established in the expansion pack &quot;Primal Hunt&quot; that LV-1201 was also once the location of a Predator hunting ground, where the Predators hunt Xenomorphs for sport. In &quot;Primal Hunt&quot;, a lone Predator survivor from a previous botched hunt unwittingly caused a Xenomorph outbreak in Pod 5 while trying to alert other members of its kind to its location. The Iron Bears were forced to destroy Pod 5, while a lone Predator ship intercepted the call. The Alien storyline, which is the earliest point in the main game, picks up about five weeks after this catastrophe occurred.

===Plot===
The three story lines in &quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2&quot; intersect and impact one another, unlike the preceding game.

====Alien====

From October 15, 2221 to some time in early 2222, &quot;Expedition One&quot; was tasked with studying a then-dormant alien hive on LV-1201. The Hive &quot;woke up&quot; on or immediately prior to New Year&#x27;s Eve, resulting in mass casualties. The only survivor was Dr. Eisenberg, who was rescued from Observation Post 4 but left traumatized by the experience; there are hints that he ate some of the other expedition members.

At 10:13 PM on November 23, 2230, one day and 7 hours before the Incident, Dr. Eisenberg is discussing some of the facility&#x27;s problems with a fellow Weyland-Yutani employee. Meanwhile, a shipping crate hiding a Xenomorph egg is delivered to the colony, where an accident awakens the egg and releases the Facehugger. The Facehugger leaves the ship and begins to track an irritable guard through the POC. When the guard retires to his quarters for a nap, the Facehugger springs on him and infects him.

In due time, a player-controlled chestburster hatches. It flees through an open window and proceeds through the POC until it feeds on a captive cat. After feeding on the cat, the chestburster grows into a full Alien drone.

In the early hours of November 25, the alien fights its way through the POC, releasing other Xenomorphs being kept as test subjects along the way. It reaches the lower levels, finally encountering a Predator. It fatally wounds the Predator, which activates its Self-Destruct Device, severely damaging the circulation and waste flow systems and creating a breach that facilitates the Xenomorph invasion into the POC. This invasion prompts the &quot;U.S.S. Verloc&quot;&#x27;s deployment.

Six weeks later, the alien infiltrates the Pods during a brief security failure caused by Corporal Harrison. As the Xenomorphs attack the Pods, they weaken the defenses and release an artificial hive in the process.

Eisenberg has taken advantage of the Marines&#x27; arrival to initiate the Large Mass Specimen Extraction, AKA Operation Savior, a project to capture the Xenomorph Empress. As part of the plan, combat synthetics have wired explosive charges throughout the tunnels of the Hive. After leaving the Pods and armed with this information, the alien disables these explosives as it tracks the Empress.

The Empress is successfully captured, but the alien pursues her captors, including Eisenberg himself. It tracks them through an archaeological site, killing numerous guards, civilians, and Iron Bears mercenaries, to a dropship landing pad. It kills two Predators and sabotages the pad&#x27;s support machinery, causing the dropship to crash. Furious, Eisenberg attacks the alien directly. The alien incapacitates Eisenberg, who is later &quot;cocooned&quot;. The final scene reveals that Eisenberg now has a synthetic body; notes in the Marine and Predator campaigns hint that his father was involved in prosthetics research that allowed Eisenberg to replace some or all of his body at the cost of radical personality changes.

====Marine====
In January 2231, on board the &quot;USS Verloc&quot;, the ship is carrying a small contingent of the U.S.C.M (United States Colonial Marines) to planet LV-1201. Contact has been lost with the research facility on the planet, and the &quot;Verloc&quot; is the closest ship, but is also significantly undermanned, having lost eight marines and one android in a recent operation. Therefore, their orders are to search for survivors, fortify, and wait for reinforcements to arrive.

At 5:25 AM, two dropships are deployed to the Primary Operations Complex, but they are separated by hurricane winds and the one carrying Harrison (the player character) and Major McCain is damaged and forced to make an emergency landing outside the POC. Red Team and Sergeant Hall are ordered to restore the main power core, White Team is ordered to locate security control, and &quot;Blackwell&#x27;s boys&quot; (Blackwell, Shugi, and Harrison) are ordered to head to the East Landing Bay. Harrison takes point but a structural collapse blocks Blackwell and Shugi from following him, and disables his radio transmitter, allowing him to hear but not talk to the rest of the marines. Harrison manages to reset the generator in the East Landing Bay and reactivate the beacon there on his own, and McCain&#x27;s dropship immediately lands there. After reuniting with his team, Harrison is then sent to the nearest security office to activate the POC&#x27;s automated defense grid. He succeeds, but accidentally wakes up the POC&#x27;s alien inhabitants in the process. McCain&#x27;s dropship departs without Harrison, who is ordered to rendezvous with Hall&#x27;s team, which he does by commandeering an APC. Once reunited with what is left of Hall&#x27;s team, he is informed that Hall has been taken by the aliens. Most of the team gets inside the APC and stays there while Harrison attempts to rescue Hall on foot, but by the time he finds her, she has already been impregnated with a Chestburster. She dies as Harrison finds her. He then returns to the APC, and depart in it to reunite with the rest of the marines at the Southern Landing, which has been secured by White Team.

At 6:55 AM, the marines attempt to reach the Pods via the tunnel network connecting them to the POC, but the doors are locked. They can only be opened from the inside, and only one at a time, like an airlock. Harrison is sent ahead to open the doors so the marines&#x27; APCs can proceed through. Upon reaching tunnel section 4, Harrison is able to shut down the primary control terminal, allowing &quot;Mother&quot; (presumably the &quot;Verloc&quot;&#x27;s computer) to disable tunnel security entirely. However, due to unique modifications made to the security protocols, this also temporarily disables all security measures and defenses at the Forward Observation Pods. During this time, Aliens attack the Pods and six of the Iron Bears are killed before the marines manage to arrive at the Pods.

Harrison attempts to establish a communication link with the &quot;Verloc&quot;. In the process, he begins receiving a message about dead scientists, but it is cut short by a computer error. He is then knocked unconscious by one of the Iron Bears, dressed in a convict&#x27;s uniform (the pods and POC had both been using convict laborers), put in a prison cell, and declared dead. Harrison&#x27;s cellmate gets into a fight with a guard, enabling Harrison to escape his cell. As he wanders around the forward observation pods, he releases the Predator player character from stasis, and then is contacted by a scrambled voice offering to reunite him with his team if he retrieves a &quot;package&quot;. The voice guides him to the implantation lab, where the &quot;package&quot; is revealed to be a CD. The voice then guides him from Pod 2 to 4, and from Pod 4 to 3, which has an elevator down to the canyon floor. On the way down, the voice-scrambling software malfunctions and Harrison is surprised that the voice is female. The voice explains to him that his team (Red Team?) appears to be headed to an alien hive, but Harrison cannot get to them on his own because the tunnels have been sealed. Harrison decides to head back to the POC and reunite with White Team to get their help with rescuing the other marines.

On the drive from the forward pods to the POC, the voice explains that her name is Tomiko, and that the retrieved disc contains proof that her brother, Kenji, was murdered while working on LV-1201.

Harrison finds several members of White Team, but they are all killed by Xenomorphs and Predators before Harrison can activate the landing beacon for an incoming dropship. Harrison manages to kill a Predator himself before reaching the dropship. Tomiko transmits the coordinates of an old entry site to the Hive, and Harrison, now in his own Exosuit, proceeds after his fellow marines whom Rykov has stranded. Harrison&#x27;s Exosuit is damaged during a fall, and he must proceed the rest of the way on foot. He locates his team in a massive chamber where the fossilized remains of a Space Jockey reside. A Xenomorph &quot;Empress&quot; attacks the squad, but Harrison is able to repel the Empress so that he and the rest of the marines can escape via dropship. The Empress tries to stop them, but the dropship bombards her with missiles, killing her.

As the dropship puts distance between itself and the Hive, Tomiko overloads the fusion reactors in the Pods, destroying them and killing herself to save the marines. When the marines return to the &quot;Verloc&quot;, Major McCain recommends abandoning any further rescue or salvage attempts on LV-1201, as they depart back to Earth.

====Predator====
On the night of July 3, 2211, a Weyland-Yutani research facility on the planet Korari came under attack by at least one Predator. A young Rykov, who was a Marine at the time, was among the survivors, but suffered a major injury to his back; he was honorably discharged from the Marines and began working as a mercenary shortly thereafter.

By November 2230, several predators have arrived at LV-1201; their arrival is brought to the attention of Rykov himself, who is now providing private security for the Weyland-Yutani installation there. The hunt lasts for at least a week, during which time one Predator self-destructs after losing in combat to an Alien (&quot;the Incident&quot;) and two more are captured by the Iron Bears. Pursuing his captured clan-mates into the Forward Observation Pods, the player character eventually succumbs to electro-magnetic pulse grenades which render his equipment useless and result in his capture.

Rykov places the Predator in a lab where it remains in stasis for over five weeks. It is revealed that this Predator is responsible for Rykov&#x27;s injuries and his burning desire for revenge. Saved from being impregnated with a Xenomorph and inadvertently released by Corporal Harrison, the Predator powers through a horde of humans, reclaims his equipment and sets off in pursuit of General Rykov.

After escaping aboard a corporate dropship, the Predator fights through the Alien infested caves and tunnels beneath the pods and eventually manages to signal his clan using human technology to broadcast the signal to them. The Predator clan promptly arrive and re-arm the Predator, who then sets off to finish Rykov.

Following Rykov, now encased in an Exosuit, deep into the Xenomorph Hive, the Predator fights his way into the heart of the Hive for a climactic battle with General Rykov. Overcoming his enemy, the Predator rips through Rykov&#x27;s body, and claims his spine as his trophy after 19 years of chase. The Predator reunites with his clan and departs the planet in order to pursue the &quot;U.S.S. Verloc&quot;.

==Development==
The game was developed in 20 months by the core development team.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Aliens vs. Predator 2&quot; for the &quot;PC Action/Adventure&quot; and &quot;Online Gameplay&quot; awards; however, it lost in both categories to &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot;. Similarly, the editors of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; nominated &quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2&quot; as the best action game of 2001, but ultimately gave the award to &quot;Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis&quot;.

==&quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt&quot;==

An expansion pack, titled &quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt&quot;, was developed by Third Law Interactive, published by Sierra Entertainment and distributed by Fox Interactive in August 2002. It was also included in the &quot;Gold Edition&quot; of &quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2&quot; released in May 2003, which bundled the original game and the expansion pack into a single package. &quot;Primal Hunt&quot; adds new weapons and multiplayer maps to the original game, as well as a single-player campaign set during the storyline of &quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2&quot;.

===Gameplay===
The player is once again able to play as either a human, Alien, or Predator character, each with its own campaign and abilities. The plot lines of the three characters intersect with the events of the original game.

===Plot===
The events of &quot;Primal Hunt&quot; are set on LV-1201, the same setting as the main game, but take place in different time periods. The stories of the Alien and Predator characters begin five hundred years before the events of &quot;Aliens Versus Predator 2&quot; and continue in the year 2230. The human campaign begins in September 2230. &quot;Primal Hunt&quot; revisits the Forward Observation Pods of the research facility and explains the destruction of Pod 5.

====Corporate====
Major Dunya, a female member of the Weyland-Yutani private military company known as the &quot;Iron Bears&quot;, is stationed on LV-1201. She is ordered by her superior officer, General Rykov, to retrieve an artifact from a location known as the &quot;Zeta Site&quot; which houses part of a Xenomorph hive as well as technology from both the Space Jockeys and the Predators. The player battles xenomorphs through the Zeta Site, retrieves the artifact, and returns to find that Aliens have infiltrated Pod 5. A Predator steals the artifact and the player defends the cargo area from Aliens until the pod is evacuated. Rykov then destroys the pod&#x27;s supports, sending it crashing into the valley floor below.

====Predator====
In the early 18th century (in Earth time), 500 years before the incident, a Predator spacecraft encounters the planet LV-1201 for the first time and the player Predator is sent there to hunt. The player battles numerous creatures before discovering that Xenomorphs also inhabit the planet. The player tracks the Aliens to their hive and activates an artifact which has the power to repel the Aliens. The game then shifts forward eight months, by which time the Predators have established a camp around the artifact. The player Predator descends into the hive in search of the Alien queen, but the artifact is deactivated and the camp is overrun by Aliens. While repairing a stasis field around a group of Alien eggs, the Predator is attacked by a facehugger and the two are caught in the field and trapped in stasis for five hundred years.

The Predator awakens when Dunya deactivates the artifact, and the player tracks her to the research facility&#x27;s Forward Observation Pods and breaks into Pod 5, inadvertently allowing the Aliens into the pod. The player retrieves the artifact and sends a signal to other Predators who are nine weeks away. The Predator is then killed by the Alien embryo bursting through its ribcage. 

====Predalien====
The Predalien character&#x27;s story also begins 500 years before the incident, but after the Predators have established a presence at Zeta Site. The player begins by controlling a facehugger, exploring the Alien hive and Predator camp in search of a host. The facehugger attacks the Predator, but both become trapped in the stasis field. The game then shifts forward five hundred years to the chestburster emerging from the Predator inside Pod 5. The creature is an Alien/Predator hybrid, called the &quot;Predalien&quot; in the game, and the player controls it and searches for food until it grows into an adult. The player then battles human guards in search of the artifact, but is interrupted when Rykov destroys the pod&#x27;s supports. The player must then battle several android guards in armored exosuits in order to escape the pod with other Aliens before it falls into the valley below.

===Reception===
The expansion pack received more mixed reviews than the original &quot;AvP2&quot;, and has a score of 55 according to Metacritic. GameSpot cited it as &quot;being boring&quot;, &quot;repetitive&quot;, and &quot;giving no sense of direction as the face-hugger&quot;. Echoing this, IGN concluded that the title was &quot;[boring], stale, frustrating and plain, &quot;Primal Hunt&quot; tarnishes the good &quot;AvP&quot; name&quot;.

<doc id="1251053" wikidata="Q5422386" url="?curid=1251053" title="Extreme carving">
<text>Extreme carving or Extremecarving is a coined term describing a particular form of carving on a snowboard.
Features of extreme carving that distinguish it from other kinds of snowboard carving include:
*The use of wider boards to accommodate extreme edge angles (the angle between board base and snow surface) produced deep in turns. Heel and toe overhang prevent narrower boards from reaching angles close to 90 degrees that are experienced in extreme carving.
*High degree of extension to the whole of the body during the middle of the carved turn, when the snowboard is facing down the fall line of the slope.
*Proactive compression of the body during edge transitions. This maneuver is also known as a cross-through or push-pull turn. During any carved turn on a sufficiently steep slope, the perceived &quot;g&quot;-force will build up at the end of the carve, resulting in a natural compression of the body. The proactive compression in extreme carving is different from this natural compression in that it is done by pulling the legs up in anticipation of the additional force, instead of allowing the legs to get pushed up as a reaction to the additional force. The snowboarder pushes the board away at the apex of the turn, and the g-force is also distributed along the whole arc of the turn, reducing the pressure on the leg at the turn exit, thus allowing the exit of the turn and the preparation of the next turn with legs flexing again (the pull sequence).
*Large, progressive rotation of the torso in the turning direction, such that the rider&#x27;s shoulders and chest are perpendicular to the toe edge during toe-side turns, and facing towards the nose of the board during heel-side turns. This is in contrast with contemporary carving methodology that indicates that one&#x27;s torso should stay at an angle midway between the angles of the two bindings, and also with the old school technique where the torso faces the nose of the board at all times.
* Minimum use of arms and non-necessary movements: the goal is to create a precise and perfect turn with a style that shows control and mastery of all the parameters at stake.

==History==
Belonging to the Alpine snowboard type, it has its roots from an evolution of the Euro Carve, or Vitelli turn, also called V-turn, that was pioneered by early snowboarders in the late &#x27;80s in the west Alps (Jesse Fernandes, Jean Nerva, Serge Vitelli and other pro slalom riders). The laid carving technique was slowly improved by two Swiss snowboarders, Jacques Rilliet and Patrice Fivat away from the trends in Zinal, Valais by using the rotation turn technique used in the Swiss Snowboard school, and the term Extremecarving was used by them to describe the fact that the laid technique pushes the body to the maximum possible contact with the snow. They created in 2001 a website that explained the technique and it led to a growing international community of riders using this riding technique, among others for riding alpine snowboards.

<text>Mikołaj Hieronim Sieniawski (1645–1683) was a Polish noble (szlachcic), military leader and politician.

==Early life and family==

He was the son of the starost of Lwów Adam Hieronim Sieniawski and Wiktoria Elżbieta Potocka, the daughter of Hetman Stanisław &quot;Rewera&quot; Potocki. He married in 1662 the daughter of Court and Grand Marshal Prince Aleksander Ludwik Radziwiłł, Princess Cecylia Maria Radziwiłł.

==Military career and politics==

He was Grand Guardian of the Crown since 1666, Great Chorąży of the Crown since 1668, Court Marshall of the Crown since 1676, starost of Lwów since 1679, voivode of Volhynian Voivodship since 1679, Field Crown Hetman since 1682 and starost of Radom, Rohatyn, and Piaseczno.

He became famous as a talented commander in wars against Cossacks and Tatars during the reign of King John II Casimir. In the rank of a &quot;Chorąży&quot; he took part, alongside John Sobieski, in the Chocim expedition.

He was Marshal of the Coronation Sejm between 2 and 14 March 1676 in Kraków.

Like his son Adam Mikołaj Sieniawski, he participated in the Vienna expedition of 1683. He died in the same year by contracting a disease, possibly syphilis, that spread after the battle.

<text>The Mars family is an American family that owns the confectionery company Mars Inc. In 1988, the family was ranked as the richest family in the United States of America by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine. It has since been surpassed by the Walton family and the Koch family, and was ranked as the third richest family in America in 2016.

Upon the 1 July 1999 death of Forrest Mars Sr., he and his two sons were ranked No. 29, 30, and 31 by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of richest Americans, and they each had a worth of approximately $4 billion. In March 2010 the three children of Forrest Mars were tied for 52nd place amongst the world&#x27;s richest people, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, with a net worth of each. One of these sons, Forrest Mars Jr., died on 26 July 2016, and his four daughters inherited his wealth, with three of them working for the company as of 2019. As of April 2020, the combined private fortune of the family members was estimated at around $126 billion, making them one of the richest families in the world.

The family is very protective of their privacy. They rarely, if ever, give press interviews or, with the exception of Jacqueline Mars and Victoria B. Mars, are photographed in public.

A 2006 report quantified how the Mars family was among 18 billionaire families, starting in the 1990s, who continuously lobbied Congress to eliminate the estate tax.

<doc id="1251074" wikidata="Q1408111" url="?curid=1251074" title="Ferry Aid">
<text>Ferry Aid was a British-American charity supergroup, brought together to record the song &quot;Let It Be&quot; in 1987. The single was released following the Zeebrugge Disaster; on 6 March 1987 the ferry had capsized, killing 193 passengers and crew. All proceeds from sales of the single were donated to the charity set up in the aftermath of the disaster. The recording was organised by &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, after it had sold cheap tickets for the ferry on that day. &quot;Let It Be&quot; was written by Paul McCartney and originally recorded by the Beatles in 1969.

==Recording==
Garry Bushell, then with &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, organised the recording of &quot;Let It Be&quot; by recruiting record producers Stock, Aitken and Waterman. They then put an invitation out to the music industry for artists to contribute their vocals to the song. Although many stars were initially reluctant to join forces with the newspaper, eventually artists such as Boy George, Kate Bush, Gary Moore and Mark Knopfler agreed to take part. Original writer Paul McCartney also contributed to the song, although his performance (and section in the accompanying video) was recorded independently in his own studios. It was later revealed that McCartney used his voice of the original recording of the 1970 Beatles track and added it to the Ferry Aid recording. The song was recorded over three days between 14 and 16 March 1987 and the single was released on 23 March 1987. The first artist to record his part was Mark King (who also played bass guitar on the song) on the Saturday morning, while the last was Paul King on Monday evening.

In the original Beatles recording, George Harrison did the guitar solo; but for the purposes of this song—as shown in the video—the solo was divided with Gary Moore first, then Mark Knopfler, then back to Gary Moore, with Moore&#x27;s parts being more &#x27;rock&#x27; and Knopfler&#x27;s being more laid-back.

==Performers==
The following artists performed solo spots on the song:
* Paul McCartney
* Boy George
* Keren Woodward and Nick Kamen
* Paul King
* Mark King
* Jaki Graham
* Taffy
* Mark Knopfler (guitar solo)
* Andy Bell
* Pepsi &amp; Shirlie
* Mel and Kim
* Gary Moore (guitar solo)
* Kim Wilde and Nik Kershaw
* Edwin Starr
* Ben Volpeliere-Pierrot
* Ruby Turner
* Kate Bush

The closing chorus was sung by an ensemble choir involving many of the soloists as well as other recording artists and celebrities from other fields. The chorus consisted of:
* The Alarm, John Altman, Debee Ashby, Al Ashton, Rick Astley, Bananarama, Simon Bates, Alison Bettles, Jenny Blythe, Errol Brown, Miquel Brown, Bucks Fizz, Jay Carly, the Christians, Nick Conway, Linda Davidson, Hazell Dean, Anne Diamond, Difford and Tilbrook, Doctor and the Medics, the Drifters, Drum Theatre, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Roy Gayle, Go West, Carol Hitchcock, Felix Howard, Gloria Hunniford, Imagination, Jenny Jay, Ellie Laine, Annabel Lamb, Stephanie Lawrence, Loose Ends, Linda Lusardi, Ruth Madoc, Bobby McVey, Suzanne Mizzi, the New Seekers, Sadie Nine, the Nolans, Hazel O&#x27;Connor, Mike Osman, Su Pollard, Tim Polley, Pamela Power, Maxi Priest, Princess, Jimmy Pursey, Suzi Quatro, Mike Read, Sally Sagoe, Nejdet Salih, Ray Shell, Mandy Smith, Neville Staple, Alvin Stardust, Steve Strange, Sylvia Tella, Terraplane, Bonnie Tyler, Maria Whittaker, Working Week.

The B-side of the 7&quot; single is a gospel version of &quot;Let It Be&quot;, made up on the spot by improvising. The 12&quot; single mixed by Burni Adams and Jamie Bromfield has &quot;Let It Be (Mega Message Mix)&quot; on the B-side.

==Criticism==
The anarchist band Chumbawamba anonymously released a parody of the song, &quot;Scab Aid&quot;, a criticism of &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper and the motives of the contributing performers which they regarded as hypocritical.

Musician Robb Johnson (who later recorded with Chumbawamba) referenced Ferry Aid in his song &quot;The Herald of Free Enterprise&quot;, criticising it for similar reasons.

==Chart performance==
&quot;Let It Be&quot; reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in its first week on 4 April 1987, and remained at that position for three weeks. It was the 13th best selling single of the year in the UK; it was certified gold for shipping over 500,000 copies.
The single was also a number one hit in Norway and Switzerland, and reached the top 10 in several other European countries.

<text>Brigadier William Denis Whitaker, (February 27, 1915 – May 30, 2001) was a Canadian athlete, soldier, businessman, and author.

==Early life==
Born in Calgary, Alberta and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Whitaker was educated at the University of Toronto Schools and later at the Royal Military College of Canada, student # 2357 in Kingston, Ontario. He graduated in 1933. He was a quarterback for the Hamilton Tigers of the Ontario Rugby Football Union.

He joined the Canadian Army and accepted a commission, as a second lieutenant with The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment) in 1937.

==Military career==
During the Second World War, Whitaker was awarded the Distinguished Service Order at the rank of captain for his achievement in the Dieppe Raid in August 1942. He was the only one of the 100 officers who landed on the beach to fight his way into town and escape unwounded. As a lieutenant colonel, Whitaker commanded the 1st Battalion, The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry–Canadian Army Active from February 17, 1944, until July 17, 1944, and from September 15, 1944, until March 29, 1945, throughout most of the fighting in northwest Europe. On 16 October 1944, during the Battle of the Scheldt, Whitaker took the village of Woensdrecht, which presented particular problems for the Canadians in their advance along the banks of the river Scheldt. He won a second Distinguished Service Order in February 1945 for leadership in the Battle of Goch-Calcar Road during Operation Veritable

At the end of the war, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier. Whitaker left the army in 1951, but returned as Honorary Colonel of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry from 1972 to 1992.

==Business career==
After his military service, he was a commercial manager of radio station CHML. In 1962, he was named vice-president of O&#x27;Keefe Brewing Co. and soon became the president. He was also the president of Major Market Advertising and a financial consultant with Nesbitt Burns.

==Sports career==
Whitaker&#x27;s sports career was equally illustrious, beginning with captaincy of the Royal Military College of Canada ice hockey and Canadian football teams. He led the Hamilton Tigers in 1938. He was named to the Canadian Forces Sports Honour Roll and was a national senior squash champion. He chaired the Canadian Equestrian Team for 20 years, and under his guidance the team won two Olympics, 15 Pan-American Games and two World Championship gold medals. He was also chef-de-mission for the 1980 Canadian Olympic Team in Moscow, which the Canadians eventually boycotted, along with the Americans due to the Soviets invading Afghanistan. He was a founder and member of the Olympic Trust of Canada. In 1990, he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.
Denis was one of the founding members of the Hamilton Hunt Club, started in 1958 in Caledonia, Ontario. He was a Master of Foxhounds and rode with the club from 1958 to 1973.
