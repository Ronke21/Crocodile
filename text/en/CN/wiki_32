<text>Lichtenwörth (Central Bavarian: &quot;Lichtnwiad&quot;) is a market town in Austria. It is situated by the rivers Leitha and Warme Fischa. The market town has a kindergarten school, an elementary school and a high school. It also has a music school.

== History ==
The place was first mentioned in 1174. Also in the 12th century, a water castle was built, which was destroyed at the end of the 15th century.

In 1747, under the regency of Maria Theresa, the needle factory &quot;Nadelburg&quot; was established. The factory was expanded with a cotton mill in the early 19th century. A workers&#x27; settlement grew around the factories. The Nadelburg was closed in 1930. It is now a museum.

Lichtenwörth became a market town in 1992.

Lichtenworth is also remembered for its concentration slave labor camp during the Third Reich. It was a sub-camp of Mauthausen. Mainly Jewish women were force marched from Budapest. The conditions were brutal, over 300 people died of malnutrition and typhus.

== Notable People from Lichtenwörth ==
* Dominic Thiem: Professional tennis player who won the 2020 US Open title, and reached three other Grand Slam finals. He held a career-high ranking of No. 3 in March 2020.

== Politics ==
The council of Lichtenwörth consists of 21 members, grouped in 4 parties (2020 elections).

* SPÖ: 10 members
* WIR &quot;(Wir alle sind Lichtenwörth – i. e.: All of Us Are Lichtenwörth)&quot;: 9 members
* FPÖ: 1 member
* ZL &quot;(Zukunft Lichtenwörth – i. e.: Future Lichtenwörth)&quot;: 1 member

<text>The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences (ATAS), also colloquially known as the Television Academy, is a professional honorary organization dedicated to the advancement of the television industry in the United States. It is a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization founded in 1946, the organization presents the Primetime Emmy Awards, an annual ceremony honoring achievement in U.S. primetime television.

==History==
Syd Cassyd considered television a tool for education and envisioned an organization that would act outside the &quot;flash and glamor&quot; of the industry and become an outlet for &quot;serious discussion&quot; and award the industry&#x27;s &quot;finest achievements&quot;. Envisioning a television counterpart of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Cassyd founded the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences in 1946 in conjunction with leaders of the early television industry who had gathered at a meeting he organized.

Cassyd&#x27;s academy in Los Angeles merged with a New York academy founded by Ed Sullivan in 1955 to form the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The Los Angeles chapter broke away from NATAS in 1977, keeping the Primetime and Los Angeles Emmys.

In 2014, alongside its Hall of Fame induction ceremony and announced plans to expand its headquarters, the organization announced that it had changed its public brand to the Television Academy, with a new logo designed by Siegel + Gale. The new branding was intended to downplay the organization&#x27;s antiquated formal name in favor of a more straightforward identity, and features a separating line (typically used to separate the organization&#x27;s wordmark from a simplified image of the Emmy Award statuette) used to symbolize a screen, and also portrayed as a &quot;portal&quot;.

In 2016, producer Hayma Washington was elected chairman and CEO of the Academy of Arts and Sciences, becoming the first African-American to hold the position.

==Emmy Award==
In 1949, the Television Academy held the first Emmy Awards ceremony, an annual event created to recognize excellence in U.S. television programming, although the initial event was restricted to programming from the Los Angeles area. The name &quot;Emmy&quot; was derived from &quot;Immy&quot;, a nickname for the image orthicon camera tube, which aided the progress of modern television. The word was feminized as &quot;Emmy&quot; to match the statuette, which depicted a winged woman holding an atom.

==Sister organizations==

The Emmy Awards are administered by three sister organizations that focus on various sectors of television programming: the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences (primetime), the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (daytime, sports, news and documentary), and the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (international). The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences also presents the Los Angeles Emmy Awards.

==Publications and programs==
In addition to recognizing outstanding programming through its Primetime Emmy Awards, the Television Academy publishes the award-winning &quot;emmy&quot; magazine and through the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Foundation, is responsible for the Archive of American Television, annual College Television Awards, Fred Rogers Memorial Scholarship, acclaimed student internships and other educational outreach programs.

<doc id="1239780" wikidata="Q4879397" url="?curid=1239780" title="Bedrock (framework)">
<text>Bedrock was a joint effort by Apple Computer and Symantec to produce a cross platform programming framework for writing applications on the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows platforms. The project was a failure for a variety of reasons, and after delivering a developer preview version the project was abandoned in late 1993.

==History==
===Background===
Bedrock started as an internal effort by Robert Bierman under Gary Hendrix at Symantec in the early 1990s. At the time many of Symantec&#x27;s products ran on both Mac and Windows, and what would become Bedrock was originally an internal set of tools intended to ease the effort of keeping both platforms up to date.

In 1991, Apple released the 3.0 version of its own development environment, MPW, along with its own object framework, MacApp. MPW was a command-line driven system that had not been competitively maintained. MacApp 3.0 is a major upgrade from previous versions, being ported from Object Pascal to C++. This left it largely incompatible with the previous version, and caused considerable consternation in the Mac developer community.

Symantec was also the supplier of the then-premier development platform on the Mac, Think C. This is a GUI-based environment which included an application framework of its own, TCL. Think C/TCL had garnered a considerable following in the Mac community, especially during the MacApp 3.0 era. To remain competitive, at some point MPW would have to be replaced with something much more similar to Think.

Throughout this period, Microsoft Windows was first starting its rise in popularity. Cross-platform development systems had been developed, but to this time they tended to be relatively simple, delivering least-common-denominator applications. A cross-platform SDK that could deliver first-rate solutions is one of the industry&#x27;s supremely idealistic goals at the time.

===Concept===
The first mention of a collaboration between Apple and Symantec was contained in the flier for WWDC &#x27;92. The companies talked about it very briefly at the show, calling it &quot;Cross Platform Framework&quot; and mentioning that more would be revealed at the PC Expo show in June. This was greeted with considerable interest in the press.

At the MacWorld show they announced the conceptnot yet a real productas Bedrock. Bedrock would first be released on the Mac and Windows, with plans to expand it in the future to support Unix, OS/2, Windows NT, and Pink—the OS originated at Apple and now developed at Taligent. It was expected to become &quot;the most direct path for migration&quot; from System 7 to Pink. Allowing a single application source code base to target all of these platforms, Bedrock was intended to become the total successor to MacApp. Seven MacApp engineers at Apple were adding MacApp 3.0 technology and functionality. Even though Bedrock did not yet exist as a product, MacApp was officially deprecated with a maintenance release of 3.0.1, unless Bedrock&#x27;s schedule would eventually slip.

Bedrock development was intended to be supported on Macintosh by Apple with an MPW replacement, and as an updated Think C from Symantec. Windows development was intended to happen via Symantec&#x27;s (Zortech) C++ on Windows. Although not officially supported, the system would be deliberately written to be able to work with any C++ compiler.

Although Bedrock was a joint project, development was being carried out entirely by Symantec because its credible expertise in Windows development was essential to Apple&#x27;s commitment to a more open system. Developers started commenting about the dangerous position this placed Apple in, leaving their future development platform in the control of a third party. Furthermore, Symantec&#x27;s CEO had apparently given up on the Mac platform, and had publicly announced that Windows was the future of the company.

===Difficulties===
Throughout this period Apple was also working on OpenDoc, positioning it as a unique document-centered technology that led to a better user experience than monolithic applications. Apple was particularly effective in &quot;selling&quot; the OpenDoc concept to end users and developers, and the obvious contradiction between working on Bedrock while claiming classic applications were outmoded led to infighting between the project teams within Apple.

Meanwhile, Symantec was having considerable problems of its own. Late in 1992, numerous members of the Bedrock team, including the head of development, left the company. This led to press accounts that the project was purportedly &quot;stone cold&quot;.

A developer preview was delivered in early 1993 that includes several demo apps built using the system. These apps look nothing like either Mac or Windows programs, using custom UI widgets for many common tasks like Open File dialog boxes. The demo applications also seem buggy and lacking any visual polish, including spelling and grammar mistakes throughout. The developer preview was released with claims that the product would ship late in 1993, but that this coming release would not yet be of &quot;code quality&quot;, and that a true final release could not be expected until some time in 1994.

By the end of 1993, with no further release in sight, rumors abounded of Apple&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the project and especially with its lack of OpenDoc support. Even in public, Apple was questioning &quot;how we can fit Bedrock into the OpenDoc environment&quot;.

In late January 1994, Ike Nassi, Vice President of the Development Products Group within AppleSoft, announced Apple&#x27;s renewed commitment to use the 18-month-old Bedrock for all native and crossplatform development. He announced an expanded scope to &quot;make Bedrock the tool of choice for OpenDoc part development&quot;though neither Apple nor Symantec would provide any details on how this would be done, and they didn&#x27;t know whether the first Bedrock release would include OpenDoc functionality at all. &quot;Computerworld&quot; reported that &quot;most [developers] said they have not seen much progress on Bedrock&quot;, though it was being beta tested and a partial low-level component release was expected in the first half of 1994.

===Discontinuation===
Apple VP Ike Nassi recalled that once he finally read the business contract between Apple and Symantec governing Bedrock, he emphatically described it as &quot;a terrible, terrible contract&quot; and demanded its immediate termination. Though lobbied &quot;very heavily&quot; in his office by Symantec Vice President Gene Wang and CEO Gordon Eubanks, Nassi ordered Apple to pay a fee to cancel it.

On January 24, 1994 Apple and Symantec finally officially stated that Symantec was no longer actively developing Bedrock. Instead, Symantec granted Apple a &quot;worldwide, perpetual license to distribute and further develop Bedrock. Additionally, Apple granted Symantec a worldwide perpetual license to use specific Apple technology in future Symantec products.&quot; However, all mention of Bedrock quickly disappeared from both companies&#x27; public statements.

Having relied on Bedrock to be the replacement for MPW and MacApp, Apple had done little development on its own platform. By 1994 this left the company with a hopelessly outdated development platform. Bedrock&#x27;s failure amid the PowerPC efforts was also ill-timed. Symantec had also done little work with Think C during this period, especially the TCL libraries. This led to the rapid switch from both MPW and Think C to the more modern and PPC-native Metrowerks systems.

<doc id="1239781" wikidata="Q713440" url="?curid=1239781" title="Glyn Daniel">
<text>Glyn Edmund Daniel (23 April 1914 – 13 December 1986) was a Welsh scientist and archaeologist who taught at Cambridge University, where he specialised in the European Neolithic period. He was appointed Disney Professor of Archaeology in 1974 and edited the academic journal &quot;Antiquity&quot; from 1958 to 1985. In addition to early efforts to popularise archaeological study and antiquity on radio and television, he edited several popular studies of the fields. He also published mysteries under the pseudonym Dilwyn Rees.

==Early life and education==
Daniel was born in Lampeter Velfrey, Pembrokeshire, a small village between Narberth and Whitland in south-west Wales, as an only child. His father, John Daniel, was the village schoolmaster there. When Glyn Daniel was five he moved with his parents to Llantwit Major in the Vale of Glamorgan. He attended Barry County School for Boys in Barry, where his academic ability led to him being awarded a State Scholarship (which enabled him to go to the University of Cambridge) and a Glamorgan County Scholarship in 1931. The Glamorgan County Scholarship allowed Glyn Daniel to study geology at Cardiff University and the church organ at Llandaff Cathedral for a year. In 1932, he went up to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, initially to read geography, and then archaeology and anthropology. He graduated with a first-class honours degree with distinction and remained at St John&#x27;s for the rest of his academic career.

==World War II==
During the Second World War, Daniel applied his talents at interpreting archaeological sites through aerial photography by working for the RAF&#x27;s air photo reconnaissance unit at RAF Medmenham. He examined and analysed photos of enemy territory. In 1942, Daniel was sent to India to lead the Central Photographic Interpretation Section in Delhi, a mini-Medmenham for the South-East Asian theatre, ultimately achieving the rank of wing commander. A year after the war Daniel married one of his WAAF officers, Ruth Langhorne.

==Career==
After the war Daniel returned to Cambridge to resume his academic life. In the years 1954-56, he presented the BBC archaeology programme &quot;Buried Treasure&quot;, which featured guests such as Kathleen Kenyon, Sir Mortimer Wheeler, and actress Noelle Middleton. He became Disney Professor of Archaeology in 1974. From 1958 to 1985, he was editor of the academic journal &quot;Antiquity&quot;. His main subject of study was Neolithic chamber tombs, although he also wrote books on the history of archaeology and archaeological thought.

Daniel appeared on television. He was the host, often with Sir Mortimer Wheeler as a guest, of the game show &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?&quot;. He was named Television Personality of the Year in 1955. In 1981, he appeared as the guest on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. He edited numerous popular studies of archaeological sites and cultures.

He died in Cambridge and the McDonald Institute, University of Cambridge, have named the Glyn Daniel Laboratory for Archaeogenetics in his memory.

==Detective fiction==
Daniel published two detective fiction novels. &quot;The Cambridge Murders&quot; (1945) was published under the pseudonym Dilwyn Rees, and later re-published in 1965 by Penguin Books under his own name. &quot;Welcome Death&quot; was published under his own name in 1954. The detective in both novels is Sir Richard Cherrington, an eminent but slightly eccentric archaeologist who is the Vice-President of Fisher College. An obituary of Daniel by Norman Hammond in &quot;American Antiquity&quot; says that Sir Richard was &quot;transparently based on Mortimer Wheeler&quot;.

<text>The Queen&#x27;s Walk is a promenade located on the southern bank of the River Thames in London, England, between Lambeth Bridge and Tower Bridge.

The creation of pedestrian access along the south bank of the Thames was seen as an integral part of the creation of the Jubilee Walkway to mark the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977. However, the last section was not established until the completion of construction of London Bridge City c.1990.

In 1996, the Walk was recognised as a foundation for establishing the Thames Path national trail through London.

This is a convenient route of several miles for tourists to walk from the London Eye Ferris wheel past numerous attractions to Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.

<text>Ramlösa () is a brand of carbonated mineral water from a source in Ramlösa Brunnspark in the southern part of Helsingborg, Sweden. Ramlösa goes back to the year 1707 when a mineral spa around the source was founded by Johan Jacob Döbelius.

Ramlösa is very common in northern Europe and is considered high-quality mineral water. Ramlösa is also popular outside Scandinavia and the water is exported as far as the United States, Middle East, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

Ramlösa is today a wholly owned subsidiary of the Danish brewery group Carlsberg.

Swedish commercials for Ramlösa previously had voice-overs by actor Stellan Skarsgård.

<doc id="1239793" wikidata="Q523451" url="?curid=1239793" title="Battle of Río San Gabriel">
<text>The Battle of Río San Gabriel was fought on 8 January 1847 during the California campaign of the Mexican–American War. It took place at a ford of the San Gabriel River, at what are today parts of the cities of Whittier, Pico Rivera and Montebello, about ten miles south-east of downtown Los Angeles.

==Background==
After the Battle of San Pasqual, the battered Army of the West, commanded by General Stephen W. Kearny, went to the headquarters of Commodore Robert F. Stockton at San Diego, California. Stockton&#x27;s next objective was to recapture Pueblo de Los Angeles. That settlement had been previously captured by Stockton&#x27;s forces but was left in the command of Captain Archibald Gillespie and had been lost to the Californio militia, commanded by General José María Flores in the Siege of Los Angeles that Fall. Stockton&#x27;s force, which included six cannons this time, left San Diego on 28–29 December.

Kearny and Stockton initially disputed the right of command. Although Kearny had superior orders from the United States War Department, he had previously sent most of his troops back to Santa Fe, New Mexico, believing that the war in California had ended, and his remaining force sustained heavy losses at the Battle of San Pasqual. Stockton had a larger force and was familiar with the area, so Kearny did not initially dispute Stockton&#x27;s command of the campaign to recapture Los Angeles.

==Battle==

U.S. scouts discovered the Mexican position at a key ford along the San Gabriel River on January 7, 1847. Approaching from the south, Stockton and Kearny planned a crossing for the next day. The U.S. forces had formed into a hollow square with the artillery and baggage in the center. Kearny ordered the artillery unlimbered to cover the crossing, but Stockton countered the order and began to move across the river. The crossing proved to be especially difficult because Flores was in a good position to contest the crossing from the high banks across the river, and the ford had patches of quicksand at the bottom of the knee deep water.

At approximately 2 pm, the Americans formed into a square when two miles from the river with the baggage and cattle in the middle, and sent skirmishers ahead. Flores attacked the square with horses, which failed, plus his makeshift ammunition and inadequate gunpowder proved to be ineffective. The U.S. officers and men manhandled their cannon across while the forward quarter of the square took cover on the river edge. Stockton personally helped unlimber and direct the artillery, which silenced both Californio cannons.

Kearny led and commanded the assault force while Stockton stayed with the guns. The left flank of the square took a Californio riverbank position and held it against a counterattack from militia lancers shouting &quot;viva Los Californios&quot;. Then the whole square charged forward shouting &quot;New Orleans, New Orleans&quot;, in honor of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s victory against Great Britain there that day thirty-one years before. The charge took the heights, and Flores withdrew his smaller force. The battle had lasted an hour and a half. 

General Kearny&#x27;s official report of the battle:
==Aftermath==
Stockton and Kearny stayed on the field overnight and resumed the pursuit the next day, moving west from the San Gabriel River to the Los Angeles Rivers near present-day Vernon, about 4 miles south of Los Angeles. There they defeated Flores&#x27; troops at the Battle of La Mesa. On January 10 the U.S. forces reoccupied Los Angeles, and Archibald Gillespie was able to raise the same U.S. flag over the house which he was forced to bring down a year before during the Siege of Los Angeles.

After Los Angeles and the whole of southern California was secured, the command issue between Stockton and Kearny heated up once again. Stockton, who had been the initial military governor of California, later granted that post to his aide, Lieutenant-Colonel (later General) John C. Fremont. Kearny, based on his more recent orders from the War Department, asserted that post for himself but was initially ignored.

On January 10, 1847, Stockton established his headquarters on Wine Street, now known as Olvera Street, in the pueblo settlement of Ciudad de Los Angeles and assisted in setting up a civil government; that home is still standing as part of the historic area.

Kearny left California on 31 May 1847 for St. Louis, with Fremont, whom he would prefer charges. Stockton left on 20 June.

The site of the battle is now registered as California Historical Landmark #385. The memorial, marked by a plaque flanked by two cannons, is located at the corner of Washington Blvd. and Bluff Rd. in Montebello. Volunteers in costume re-enact the battle annually.

<doc id="1239800" wikidata="Q368484" url="?curid=1239800" title="Josef Lada">
<text>Josef Lada (born 17 December 1887 in Hrusice, Bohemia – 14 December 1957 in Prague, buried at Olšany Cemetery) was a Czech painter, illustrator, cartoonist and writer. Pioneer of the Czech comicbook tradition and founder of the “Czech modern fairytale” genre. He is considered one of the greatest Czech artists of all times – which is also what the world-famous Pablo Picasso had claimed him to be. He is best known for his children’s books and he is best known as the illustrator of Jaroslav Hašek&#x27;s World War I novel &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk,&quot;. 
He’s an author of over 15000 illustrations (both colour and black and white) and more than 600 paintings. The main themes and motives of his work include the following; home village Hrusice, water goblins and sprites, night watchmen, pub fights and the traditional pig-slaughter.

==Life &amp; Work==
Only a very few artists have managed to produce such an incredible variety of work compared to that of Josef Lada. Be it his paintings, illustrations, cartoons or pieces of writing – vast majority of anything he’s ever done is of an exceptional quality.

Despite being entirely self-taught, Josef Lada had managed to work his way through to the top and earned his position among the most respected artists in Czechoslovakia. No art critic would surely doubt that today. Lada’s work has become one of the Czech national trademarks and its popularity (among anyone aged 3 and up)doesn’t seem to be declining.Since new pieces of work get discovered almost every year, the total number of his paintings is unknown. The last count shows, however, that this number is closer to 600 rather than 400 (which is what the previous official estimate stated).
The amount of his illustrations is then greater still. Again, this number isn’t exactbut it might very well be over 15000 pieces of work (black and white or colour) published in variousfiction books, newspapers and magazines.Cartoons, including political satire, represent a very significant part of Lada´s production. Despite being over 100 years old now, most of these sketches are still very popular (and relevant) today. Lada is definitely one of the founders of the Czech cartoon and comic book tradition. The best example of his “illustrations for adults” is clearly the world-famous drawings to complement the work of Jaroslav Hašek – especially his novel “The Good Soldier Švejk”.In combination with Lada’s illustrations, the text represents a genius piece of writing that is still getting published all over the world today. Josef Lada has made his mark as a writer as well. You can learn everything about his life and work in “The Chronicle of my Life”. He’s also written some of the best Czech fairy tales such as “Mikeš – The Adventures of the Talking Cat”, “Cunning Godmother Fox” or “Bogeyman and Water Sprites”. He’s obviously illustrated books of other authors as well. His work for writers such as Jiří Horák, Jan Drda, K. J. Erben or Božena Němcová is especially well known. When it comes to Czech literature for children, Josef Lada was without a doubt one of the greatest illustrators of all times.

It will soon be 140 years since Lada’s birth and the 70th anniversary of his death. Over the years, his unique work has become an inseparable part of the Czech cultural heritage. New editions of his books are still in great demand, people use the typical Lada calendars, diaries and notebooks, sending out Lada’s Christmas cards has become an absolute must for the majority of Czech families.Both children and adults love his timeless fairy tales and anyone who visits his art exhibitions is immediately taken to the magical world of a humble boy from Hrusice.

<text>The Battle of Heilsberg took place on 10 June 1807 off the town of Heilsberg (now Lidzbark Warmiński), during the Napoleonic Wars.

==Overview==
On 24 May 1807, the Siege of Danzig ended when Prussian General Friedrich Adolf, Count von Kalckreuth capitulated to French Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre. This gave Napoleon the opportunity to engage the Russian forces led by Levin August von Bennigsen and then Andrei Ivanovich Gorchakov. The French commanders were Joachim Murat and Napoleon Bonaparte. On 2 June, before Napoleon could act, Bennigsen ordered his columns to converge on Marshal Michel Ney&#x27;s exposed VI Corps. Outnumbered by 63,000 to 17,000, Ney fought a rearguard action at the Battle of Guttstadt-Deppen on 5 and 6 June. Though he lost his baggage train, two guns, and 2,042 men, Ney managed to escape to the southwest over the Pasłęka (Passarge) River with the bulk of his soldiers.

Within two days, Napoleon had ordered his 190,000-man army to close in on the 100,000 Russians and 15,000 Prussians. Aware of their approach, Bennigsen ordered his troops to fall back on Lidzbark Warmiński in the Prussian Partition of Poland (&quot;Heilsberg&quot; in German). The Russian army took up strong defensive positions around the town, which stood on the Łyna (Alle) River. The French army, under Marshal Murat, attacked on 10 June. Then Napoleon Bonaparte and Jean Lannes&#x27; corps approached, and Napoleon took joint command. The Polish 5th Mounted Rifles Regiment under Colonel also took part in the battle on the side of Napoleon. Bennigsen repelled several attacks, resulting in huge French casualties, but had to withdraw towards Friedland the following day. Four days later, the decisive Battle of Friedland occurred, ending the War of the Fourth Coalition with the passing of the Treaty of Tilsit.

==Influences on the battle==
===Geography===

The Battle of Heilsberg was fought on the Alle river, known today as the Lyna. The Teutonic Castle being the focal point of the battle was held by Russian control.

===Terrain===

Aside from geographical advantages, the Russians had also spent three to four months compiling tactics on how to defend against a French invasion, regardless of where they would attack the castlegrounds. Defensively, the castle was supported by its bridges and walls, both of which were built along the perimeter of the castle. The land surrounding the Teutonic Castle acted as an obstacle for the French army due to the increase of elevation from the base of the river to the castles foundation. The Prussian 21st Fusiliers, commanded by Ludwig August von Stutterheim, was garrisoned there.

===Climate===

Although the terrain was punishment enough for the French, weather also took a toll on their abilities and health. During the day, on top of the weight being carried in regards to supplies and armory, temperatures reached dangerously hot and humid levels. The dampness and bitter cold of the night also played a significant role by providing little opportunity for rest.

==Progress of the battle==

===Tactics===
Benningsen had been fooled into retreat by false reports of the French numbers. The Russians, having moved back to Heilsberg, had some protection from substantial fieldworks. In order to storm the fortifications, Napoleon had to choose between an immediate advance or a flanking movement, threatening the Russian supply base of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad). He chose the latter, and the French thus positioned themselves so as to cut off any opportunity for the Russians to obtain reinforcements.

===The battle===
The French cavalry under Joachim Murat was selected to lead the frontal attack, but Napoleon did not arrive on the field in person until Murat had already led a disastrous charge. Marshal Mortier and Marshal Davout advanced on the Königsberg side.

At first Murat attacked Borozdin and forced him to retreat. Bennigsen, having sent 7 battalions of infantry, 1 regiment of cavalry and 2 guns to support Borozdin, ordered Bagration to cross to the left bank of the Alle River, join Borozdin&#x27;s detachment and hold off the French until most of the army had been moved from the right bank to the left. Prince Bagration took up his position on the left bank, with his right flank on the Langwiese and his left on the Alle. In the afternoon, Soult&#x27;s infantry came and immediately attacked; Murat&#x27;s cavalry moved to the detour between Langwiese and Lawden. At this time, however, Major general Kozhin&#x27;s mounted detachment (1,000 men), which formed the left-hand column of Lieutenant general Uvarov&#x27;s troops (3 jaeger regiments and 25 squadrons), moved by Bennigsen in support of Bagration, came to his aid; it temporarily held back the onslaught of French cavalry, and the Guard Battery, located on the right bank of the Alle opposite the mouth of the Spuibach, stopped Soult&#x27;s infantry; Bagration&#x27;s vanguard was able to withdraw to the main position, where it became a reserve; Kozhin&#x27;s detachment, having joined with Uvarov&#x27;s right column, which had failed at Lawden in the battle with Legrand&#x27;s division, withdrew to the right flank.

At 6pm Napoleon arrived on the battlefield with part of Lannes&#x27; corps and the Fusilier guardsmen. Soult and Lannes, leading separate cavalry units, and Ney, with the infantry, moved forwards on both sides of the River Łyna. Divisional general Legrand was ordered to attack the central redoubt; the French managed to break into the redoubt. Lieutenant general Gorchakov, commanding the corps of Bennigsen&#x27;s army, attacked the French and seized the redoubt back. One of the regiments of Divisional general Saint-Hilaire, moved by him to help Legrand, was also repulsed. Failure in the centre forced Napoleon to shift his main attention to the enemy&#x27;s right flank; but even here, despite the arrival of the rest of Lannes&#x27; corps, the attacks were unsuccessful. Tightly pressed by the Russian cavalry, the French army withdrew behind Spuibach stream, holding back only the grove of Lawden. Smaller French units proved ineffective, especially when Prussian reinforcements arrived, sent by Anton Wilhelm von L&#x27;Estocq at Bennigsen&#x27;s request. Strong artillery cannonade from both sides continued until darkness fell, when Lannes with Verdier&#x27;s division made a new attempt to capture the central redoubt, but was forced to retreat, which cost the French 3,000 casualties.

On the Russian side, Bennigsen was suffering from sudden fever and had difficulty remaining in command. Andrey I. Gorchakov, on Grand Duke Constantine&#x27;s orders, due to the illness of сommander-in-сhief Bennigsen, took over general command for the rest of the day in the final hours of the battle, bringing it to a tactical draw.

On 11 June, the substantial casualties on both sides and the success of the Russian defence gave Bennigsen and Napoleon little choice but to call an undocumented truce to end hostilities. The French had lost an estimated 12,000 men. The truce was focused primarily on the recovery of wounded soldiers. The battle ended with medics and soldiers from both sides helping the wounded and retrieving the dead. When Napoleon entered the deserted Russian positions the following day, he found that all except the wounded had been evacuated overnight.

==Outcome and post-war analysis==
This battle is recognized as having been strategically inconclusive due to neither side having gained any significant ground, it is most notably discussed as a battle that yielded little change in the balance of strength between the Russians and the French. By most accounts, this was a successful Russo-Prussian rearguard action. Napoleon never realized he faced the entire army at Heilsberg. Murat and Soult attacked prematurely and at the strongest point in the Russo-Prussian line. The Russians had built extensive fortifications on the right bank of the Alle river, but only a few minor redoubts on the left bank, yet the French advanced over the river to give battle, squandering their advantages and incurring casualties
The Battle of Heilsberg was fought four days before the decisive Battle of Friedland.

===French Army losses===
On both sides, disputes over the killed and wounded remain. The French claimed 1,398 killed, 10,059 wounded, 864 captured. Three units lost their eagles, and Digby Smith places the losses higher than Clodfelter, at 1,398 killed, 10,059 wounded and 864 captured.
Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult&#x27;s IV corps sustained the majority of losses: 8,286, and General François Xavier Roussel, Chief of Staff of the Imperial Guard, was killed. Three generals were wounded, and Jean Lannes&#x27; corps lost 2,284 killed and wounded.

===Russo-Prussian losses===
Disputed figures as well, Clodfelter estimates 6,000 killed and wounded. In addition, generals Koschin, Warneck, and Pahlen were killed; Dmitry Dokhturov, Werdrevski, Fock, Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev, Duka, Laptiev, Passeck and Duke Charles of Mecklenburg were wounded. The Russian commander, Bennigsen was sick all day, but remained on his horse despite falling off unconscious several times. Digby Smith says that the Russian Prussian force lost 2-3000 dead, and about 5-6000 wounded, and they lost two guns.

<text>The Leatherstocking Tales is a series of five novels (&quot;The Deerslayer&quot;, &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;, &quot;The Pioneers&quot;, and &quot;The Prairie&quot;) by American writer James Fenimore Cooper, set in the eighteenth-century era of development in the primarily former Iroquois areas in central New York. Each novel features Natty Bumppo, a frontiersman known to European-American settlers as &quot;Leatherstocking&quot;, &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;, and &quot;the trapper&quot;. Native Americans call him &quot;Deerslayer&quot;, &quot;La Longue Carabine&quot; (&quot;Long Rifle&quot; in French), and &quot;Hawkeye&quot;.

==Publication history==
The story dates are derived from dates given in the tales and span the period roughly of 1740–1806. They do not necessarily correspond with the actual dates of the historical events described in the series, which are discrepancies Cooper likely introduced for the sake of convenience. For instance, Cooper manipulated time to avoid making Leatherstocking 100 years old when he traveled to the Kansas plains in &quot;The Prairie&quot;.

The Natty Bumppo character is generally believed to be inspired, at least in part, by the historic explorer Daniel Boone or the lesser known David Shipman. Critic Georg Lukacs likened Bumppo to Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;middling characters; because they do not represent the extremes of society, these figures can serve as tools for the social and cultural exploration of historical events, without directly portraying the history itself.

==Characters==
*Natty Bumppo is the protagonist of the series: an Anglo-American raised in part by Native Americans, and later a near-fearless warrior (his chief weapon is the long rifle). He and his Mohican &quot;brother&quot; Chingachgook are constant companions. He is known as &quot;Deerslayer&quot; in &quot;The Deerslayer&quot;, &quot;Hawkeye&quot; and &quot;La Longue Carabine&quot; in &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, &quot;Pathfinder&quot; in &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;, &quot;Leatherstocking&quot; in &quot;The Pioneers&quot;, and &quot;the trapper&quot; in &quot;The Prairie&quot;. The novels recount significant events in Natty Bumppo&#x27;s life from 1740 to 1806. 
*Chingachgook is a Mohican chief and companion of Bumppo. He is present in all the books except for &quot;The Prairie&quot; because he dies of old age after narrowly escaping a forest fire in &quot;The Pioneers&quot;.
*Uncas, son of Chingachgook, &quot;last of the Mohicans&quot;, grew to manhood, yet he was killed in a battle with the hostile scout Magua. In actual history, a man named Uncas was a chief of the Mohegan in the 1600s. Though a prominent figure only in &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, he is mentioned as a boy at the very end of &quot;The Deerslayer&quot;, only once by name in &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;, and several times in &quot;The Prairie&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Several films have been adapted from one or more of this series of Cooper&#x27;s novels. Some used one of Bumppo&#x27;s nicknames, most often Hawkeye, to identify this character, e.g., in:
* &quot;Lederstrumpf&quot; / &quot;Leatherstocking&quot; (1920 German silent film) co-starred Bela Lugosi as Chingachgook
* The serial film &quot;Leatherstocking&quot; (1924)
* &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1936), the 1992 film is based on the screenplay of this film.
* &quot;Chingachgook, die große Schlange&quot; (1967), an East German film, co-starred Gojko Mitić as Chingachgook
* &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1992), in which Hawkeye&#x27;s surname was changed from Bumppo to Poe
* &quot;The Pathfinder&quot; (1952), Columbia Pictures film starring George Montgomery
* &quot;The Pathfinder&quot; (1996), where he is known chiefly as Pathfinder, but his birth name of Nathaniel is also mentioned

Two Canadian TV series were based on the character of Leatherstocking:
* In &quot;Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1957), Natty Bumppo&#x27;s name was changed to Nat Cutler, but he was usually referred to as Hawkeye
* The series &quot;Hawkeye&quot; (1994) is mostly set around the fictional Fort Bennington during the French and Indian War

WQED (TV) Pittsburgh&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon A Classic&quot; children&#x27;s television series produced a four-episode adaptation entitled &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot; (1979), which won one Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Series and was nominated for another for writing. The main character&#x27;s name is Natty Bumppo, though other nicknames appear.

==In popular culture==
*Bumppo is featured in the comic book series &quot;Jack of Fables&quot; (2006–2011), along with Slue-Foot Sue, as trackers hired to capture other &quot;Fables&quot;.
*In Alan Moore&#x27;s comic series &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (1999–2007), Natty Bumppo is featured as a member of the group assembled by Lemuel Gulliver, alongside other literary characters including Dr Syn, Fanny Hill, The Scarlet Pimpernel, and Orlando.
*In J.R. Moehringer, &quot;The Tender Bar: A Memoir&quot; (2005), among the men Moehringer gets to know is Bud, who refers to Bumppo in the following quote: &quot;Don&#x27;t think of fear as the villain. Think of fear as your guide, your pathfinder – your Natty Bumppo.&quot; (p. 133)
*In the M*A*S*H franchise, the central character Benjamin Franklin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce was nicknamed this by his father, citing &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; as &quot;the only book my father ever read&quot;.

<text>Sir John Grahame Douglas Clark (28 July 1907 – 12 September 1995), who often published as J. G. D. Clark, was a British archaeologist who specialised in the study of Mesolithic Europe and palaeoeconomics. He spent most of his career working at the University of Cambridge, where he was appointed Disney Professor of Archaeology from 1952 to 1974 and Master of Peterhouse from 1973 to 1980.

Born in Kent to an upper-middle-class family, Clark developed an early interest in archaeology through his collection of prehistoric flint tools. After an education at Marlborough College, he proceeded to Peterhouse in the University of Cambridge, there attaining both his undergraduate and then doctoral degree. For the latter, he produced a thesis and published monograph focusing on Mesolithic Britain. In 1932, he co-founded the Fenland Research Committee, through which he excavated several prehistoric sites in the East Anglian Fens. He was also a senior member of the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia and played an instrumental role in transforming it into The Prehistoric Society in 1935. He served as the editor of its academic journal, the &quot;Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society&quot;, from 1933 until 1970.

During the Second World War, Clark was drafted into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He remained in Britain, working on aerial reconnaissance, and wrote further archaeological research articles in his spare time. After the war he returned to Cambridge University, where he was employed as a full-time lecturer. Over the course of 1949, 1950, and 1951, he excavated the important Mesolithic settlement site of Star Carr in North Yorkshire. Other excavations carried out under his directorship included that of an Iron Age settlement on Micklemoor Hill, Norfolk, and the Neolithic site of Hurst Fen, Suffolk. In 1951 he was made a Fellow of the British Academy, in 1952 appointed to Cambridge&#x27;s Disney Chair, and in 1959 elected President of the Prehistoric Society. In later life he travelled the globe more extensively, often as a visiting professor. In these years, he also wrote more prolifically, although these books typically received a less enthusiastic reception than his earlier work.

Clark was not a popular figure among the British archaeological community, being regarded as a competitive and remote individual who craved recognition. He was nevertheless regarded as one of the most important prehistorians of his generation. He was particularly noted for his emphasis on exploring the economies and environmental conditions of prehistoric Europe. His career was recognised by a number of accolades, including the Dutch Erasmus Prize and a British knighthood, and he was the subject of a posthumous biography by Brian Fagan.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1907–27===

John Grahame Douglas Clark was born on 28 July 1907. He was the eldest son of Maude Ethel Grahame Clark (née Shaw) and Charles Douglas Clark, the latter being a stockbroker and a reserve officer in the British Army. The family were upper middle-class and moderately prosperous. They lived in the village of Shortlands, near to Bromley in West Kent. At the outbreak of the First World War, Charles Clark joined the West Kent Regiment and was sent to fight overseas. He survived the war, but during his return to Britain in 1919 succumbed to the influenza pandemic and died mid-journey. Grahame Clark grew up without a father, instead being raised by his mother and an uncle for whom he had great affection. According to the available evidence, Clark&#x27;s childhood was a happy one. His family moved to Seaford, a coastal town on the edge of the Sussex Downs, with the young Clark developing a fascination with the prehistoric flint tools that he collected on the Downs.

In 1921 Clark began an education at Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where he joined the school&#x27;s Natural History Society. Aside from his interest in prehistoric tools—which earned him the school nickname &quot;Stones and Bones&quot;—he was also fascinated by the butterflies and moths that could be found in Wiltshire. During his time at the college he visited the archaeological excavation of Windmill Hill run by Alexander Keiller, and became an early subscriber to the archaeological journal &quot;Antiquity&quot;. His interest in archaeology was encouraged by &quot;Antiquity&quot;&#x27;s editor, O. G. S. Crawford, and he published articles on prehistoric tools in the Natural History Society&#x27;s &quot;Reports&quot;. Having familiarised himself with much of the literature on prehistory, including V. Gordon Childe&#x27;s influential 1925 book &quot;The Dawn of European Civilisation&quot;, in his final year at Marlborough Clark gave a talk on the subject of &quot;Progress in Prehistoric Times&quot;. By the time that he left the school he was committed to the idea of becoming a professional archaeologist. In this period most prehistoric archaeologists were non-professional hobbyists, and of the few archaeological jobs available most were in museums.

===University education: 1927–34===

In 1920s, Britain there were few universities that taught courses in prehistory or archaeology. One was the University of Oxford, although Clark was unsuccessful in attaining a scholarship to attend St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. Turning to the University of Cambridge, he applied to join Peterhouse and while they too turned him down for a scholarship, they admitted him as a &quot;pensioner&quot;, or a student who pays for their own tuition. He began his degree in 1927, and during his first two years was enrolled on the history tripos. He attended lectures by economic historians like Michael Postan, which would influence his later archaeological approach to the economies of prehistoric societies. During these years he had continued his research into archaeology on an independent basis, producing articles on prehistoric stone tools that were published in the journals &quot;Sussex Archaeological Collections&quot; and the &quot;Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia&quot;.

In 1928, Clark began his studies in archaeology, which was then taught alongside physical anthropology and social anthropology within the university&#x27;s anthropology department. The department was run by the Disney Professor Ellis Minns—whose ideas influenced Clark—while the archaeology curriculum was largely organised by Miles Burkitt, an unpaid lecturer of private means. Providing himself with a broad-based grounding in archaeology, Clark sat in on lectures given by archaeologists like Gertrude Caton Thompson, Dorothy Garrod, Leonard Woolley, and Childe. Although the Cambridge syllabus did not provide opportunities for excavation, Clark assisted the non-professional archaeologist Eliot Curwen during his excavations of the Whitehawk Neolithic causewayed camp near Brighton and then The Trundle, an Iron Age hillfort and Neolithic causewayed enclosure near Chichester. It was at the latter that he befriended two fellow excavators, Stuart Piggott and Charles Philips, who became lifelong friends. He also visited a number of Mortimer Wheeler&#x27;s excavations, although never worked on them. Clark graduated in 1930 with a first-class honours degree.

Clark then registered as a doctoral student, being awarded a Hugo de Balsham studentship at Peterhouse from 1930 to 1932, and then a Bye Fellowship from 1932 to 1935. At Burkitt&#x27;s suggestion, he devoted his thesis largely to the Mesolithic—or &#x27;Middle Stone Age&#x27;—period of British prehistory. At the time little was known about Mesolithic Britain as few scholars had paid attention to it, and most of the archaeological evidence for it consisted of scattered flint tools. Burkitt served as his supervisor, although largely left Clark to his own devices. Clark initially familiarised himself with the evidence for Mesolithic society in continental Europe by travelling to Denmark and Sweden in 1929, where he had a chance meeting with Sophus Müller. On his return to Britain he began a systematic examination of Mesolithic stone tool collections that were held in both museums and private collections across the country, listing these many artefacts within a database. From this he was able to map the distribution of such Mesolithic tool assemblages across the island.

On the basis of this research he wrote &quot;The Mesolithic Age in Britain&quot;, which was published to critical acclaim by Cambridge University Press in 1932. The book took a conservative approach to the subject by being heavily artefact-focused, although reflected Clark&#x27;s growing interest in ecology and the role of Mesolithic society in adapting to climate change by discussing the technique of pollen analysis—which had recently been developed in Scandinavia—as a means of understanding ancient changes in the vegetation. Influenced by Childe, the book was rooted in the theoretical perspective of culture-historical archaeology, presenting different styles of Mesolithic tool as representations of different &#x27;cultures&#x27;, which in turn represented different peoples. &quot;The Mesolithic Age in Britain&quot; formed the core of Clark&#x27;s completed thesis, which was titled &quot;The Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Early Metal Age Industries in Britain&quot; and submitted in January 1934.
After passing his oral exam, which was conducted by Thomas Kendrick at the British Museum in London, Clark was awarded his PhD in 1934.

While conducting his research, he published a number of research articles in scholarly journals such as &quot;Antiquity&quot;. In 1932, he co-founded the Fenland Research Committee with the botanists Harry and Margaret Godwin; it represented a loose association of specialists in different academic fields who all had an interest in the East Anglian Fenlands. Clark served as the group&#x27;s honorary secretary, and under him all of the Committee&#x27;s research projects would be promptly written up and published. The group excavated at Plantation Farm near Shippea Hill, helping to establish a basic stratigraphic chronology of the Fenland&#x27;s development. In 1934 they then carried out a second excavation at Peacock&#x27;s Farm, which was very important for demonstrating the advantages of interdisciplinary research and for placing British prehistory within an environmental framework.

In February 1932, Clark was elected to the council of the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia, and in May 1933 became acting editor of the society&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings&quot; at Childe&#x27;s recommendation. In February 1934 he was made a permanent council member and honorary editor of the &quot;Proceedings&quot;. By 1934, both Clark and contemporaries like Piggott had become increasingly influential within the British archaeological community. Previously, in February 1933, Burkitt had ensured that Clark was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Clark himself was however unpopular in many archaeological circles, a result of what his later biographer Brian Fagan described as Clark&#x27;s tendency to be &quot;extremely critical, even cruel&quot; toward others. During his doctoral studies, he entered a relationship with an archaeology student at Girton College, Cambridge named Gwladys Maud &quot;Mollie&quot; White. In June 1933 the couple assisted Philips&#x27; excavation of the long barrow atop Giant&#x27;s Hill near Skendleby, Lincolnshire.

===Early career: 1935–39===

In July 1935, Cambridge University&#x27;s Department of Anthropology and Archaeology employed Clark as an assistant lecturer to teach a course on &quot;geochronology and climatic history&quot;, and the following year his position was upgraded to that of a faculty member. In this position he trained an influential coterie of undergraduates in archaeology between 1935 and 1939, among them Charles McBurney, Bernard Fagg, and J. Desmond Clark. In 1935, he helped to set up the Cambridge University Archaeology Field Unit and was appointed its honorary vice president. He arranged for undergraduate members of the Field Unit to assist him in his March 1935 excavations at Mildenhall Fen, where they discovered a wealth of Bronze Age material. Over the course of 1937 and 1938, he co-ran an excavation of the Mesolithic site at Farnham with the non-professional W. F. Rankine. The excavation only revealed some stone tools, producing no ecological data and very little evidence of any structures. Although Rankine argued that they should produce a lengthy report, Clark only wrote up the results for a 1939 article in the &quot;Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society&quot;.

In February 1935, Clark had suggested that the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia rename itself as the Prehistoric Society, thus stretching its remit far beyond East Anglia. A vote on the issue produced an overwhelming majority in support of the change. Membership of the group then grew rapidly; in 1935 it had 353 members, and this had increased to 668 in 1938. Under Clark&#x27;s lead, the new &quot;Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society&quot; published articles by prominent archaeologists like Childe, Piggott, Philips, and Glyn Daniel, and emphasised interdisciplinary examinations that took into account the work of the natural sciences. Clark also encouraged archaeologists working on non-British prehistory to submit to the journal, and met with the prominent French archaeologist Henri Breuil on the latter&#x27;s visit to Cambridge.

In the summer of 1936, Clark married Mollie in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Chichester. They then embarked on a honeymoon in Norway and Sweden, looking at the region&#x27;s prehistoric rock art, on the subject of which Clark then produced an illustrated article for &quot;Antiquity&quot;. Later that year, the couple and Philips embarked on a road trip across northern Europe, visiting archaeological sites like the Danevirke and the Nydam Boat. In Germany they spent time at the Schleswig Museum and met with Gustav Schwantes, who took them to visit Alfred Rust&#x27;s excavation of a Mesolithic site at Meiendorf. Clark and Rust got on well and remained in contact for many years. Crossing to Denmark, the trio were involved in a car crash near to Randers, with the Clarks requiring hospitalisation for three weeks.

Mollie and Grahame were recruited by Charles Phillips to excavate the Sutton Hoo Mound 1 ship in 1939.

In 1936, Cambridge University Press published Clark&#x27;s &quot;The Mesolithic Settlement of Northern Europe&quot;, in which he demonstrated his growing interest in ecological and environmental themes. The book established Clark as being at the forefront of Mesolithic archaeology, and was hailed as an important and trend-setting tome which would influence generations of Mesolithic archaeologists before eventually becoming outdated due to more detailed research. 

In 1939 Methuen and Co published Clark&#x27;s &quot;Archaeology and Society&quot;. This was a textbook that outlined how to understand past societies through archaeology, and expressed the view that archaeology could be a force for peace in the world by promoting notions of human unity. In the book he condemned Soviet archaeology, believing that the Soviet government had forced archaeologists to support their pre-conceived Marxist ideas about societal and economic development. He also condemned the use of archaeology in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, claiming that they used archaeology to promote a &quot;diseased nationalism&quot;. Published to good reviews, the book was read widely and revised editions were published in 1947 and 1952. According to the historian of archaeology Pamela Jane Smith, it became &quot;one of Clark&#x27;s most widely read and respected publications.&quot;

===Second World War: 1939–45===

Clark&#x27;s archaeological career was put on hold during the Second World War. While awaiting enlistment into the British armed forces, Clark took lessons in Russian with Minns in order to enable him to read Soviet archaeological publications. He was then drafted into the Royal Air Force (RAF) Volunteer Reserve as a pilot officer, being posted to the central interpretative unit at RAF Medmenham. There, he served in the aerial photograph interpretation unit, where he worked alongside fellow archaeologists like Daniel, Garrod, Piggott, Philips, and McBurney. This grouping allowed for some continuity in the British archaeological community despite the widespread cessation of active research. During this period he lived with his wife and two children at a small, isolated house in Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In 1944 he was transferred to the Air Historical Branch based in Westminster, which allowed him and his family to relocate back to their Cambridge house in Barton Road. Clark used his daily commute from Cambridge into central London to edit articles submitted for the &quot;Proceedings&quot;. Although all meetings of the Prehistoric Society were cancelled for the duration of the war, Clark was able to keep the journal going despite paper rationing.

Clark read omnivorously and produced a steady stream of academic articles in this period. From 1942 to 1948, he published articles on such diverse subjects as water, bees, sheep, fishing, and whale hunting in prehistory. These publications reflected his interest in using recorded folk culture and historical evidence to inspire fresh interpretations of the archaeological material.
In August 1943, Clark gave the opening address at the &#x27;Future of Archaeology&#x27; conference at London&#x27;s Institute of Archaeology. This address was then published in &quot;Antiquity&quot;. In it, Clark claimed that education in British schools was a &quot;parody of knowledge&quot; and that rather than emphasising competitiveness and preparing pupils for future careers, education should focus on &quot;human well-being&quot; and helping students to gain an understanding of both themselves and of humanity. He claimed that the teaching of prehistory—a subject he thought to be the inheritance of all humanity—would provide a good basis for a pupil&#x27;s education. At the conference, he had been among those arguing that after the war the field of archaeology should not be allowed to come under increasing state control, fearing that doing so might result in British archaeology taking on increasingly nationalistic characteristics, as it had in Nazi Germany.

===Post-war period: 1946–51===

Clark was demobilised in 1946. He returned to Cambridge University where he was appointed full lecturer in archaeology, with the department now under the leadership of Garrod. During the war he had written &quot;From Savagery to Civilisation&quot;, and it was published by Cobbett Press in 1946. The book utilised the anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor&#x27;s division of society into the categories of savagery, barbarism, and civilisation, although added the innovation of dividing savagery into higher and lower forms. Fagan later noted that in adopting Tylor&#x27;s tripartite division, the book was &quot;old-fashioned even for the 1940s&quot;.
During the summer break of 1947, Clark led a team of undergraduates in the excavation of Bullock&#x27;s Haste along the Car Dyke near Cottenham, revealing evidence of early Romano-British activity.
In 1947 and in 1948, he was awarded a Leverhulme Fellowship which allowed him to travel across much of Northern and Central Europe. He looked at the technologies and techniques of rural and fishing communities in much of Scandinavia, displaying his interest in the relationship between folk culture and ecology. He expanded the length of the &quot;Proceedings&quot; in the years following the war, now aided by Piggott and Kenneth Oakley as his editorial assistants.

In 1946, Childe resigned as the Abercromby Professor of Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh. Clark applied to succeed him, although the position was instead given to Piggott. Piggott then invited Clark to give the Munro Lectures at Edinburgh in 1949.
In 1950, he was elected to a fellowship at Peterhouse, a position that he held for the next 45 years. At the college he befriended his colleague Michael Postan, an economic historian whose research into Medieval farming techniques inspired Clark to reassess Neolithic farming.
In 1951, he contributed a chapter on the use of folklore in interpreting prehistory for a &quot;festschrift&quot; devoted to Childe. Fagan later described this chapter as one of Clark&#x27;s most important papers. Using his Munro Lectures as a basis, Clark also wrote a book, &quot;Prehistoric Europe: the Economic Basis&quot;, which reflected his interest in ecology and the impact that it had on the economics of human society. The book received mixed reviews, although would be described by Fagan as &quot;arguably the most influential of all Clark&#x27;s books&quot;. It sold widely and was translated into several languages.

Clark had been very impressed with Gerhard Bersu&#x27;s excavation of the Iron Age settlement of Little Woodbury in Wiltshire in 1938 and 1939. After the war, he decided to excavate an Iron Age settlement nearer to Cambridge using the same techniques as Bersu had used. An amateur archaeologist had found early Iron Age pottery on Micklemoor Hill near West Harling in Norfolk, and Clark began an excavation of the site in 1948. However, before Clark could finish the excavation, he was distracted by a new project.

In 1948, Clark was informed about a Mesolithic flint scatter that had been found in peaty deposits at Seamer Carr in North Yorkshire by an amateur archaeologist, John Moore. Clark visited this site, known as Star Carr, and realised that it may provide further evidence of a Mesolithic settlement. He oversaw three seasons of excavation at the site, in the summers of 1949, 1950, and 1951. The project was carried out on a shoestring budget under the auspices of Cambridge University and the Prehistoric Society.
The project was consciously multidisciplinary, involving botanists from the beginning. Fagan noted that the excavation methods were &quot;adequate, although certainly not up to Mortimer Wheeler standards&quot;. He published his results promptly, bringing out preliminary reports in the 1949 and 1950 editions of the &quot;Proceedings&quot;. The final monograph was completed in December 1952 and published by Cambridge University Press in 1954. According to Fagan, it was &quot;one of the classic archaeological monographs of the twentieth century&quot;. It was published to good reviews, and helped to establish Clark&#x27;s reputation among the archaeological community in the United States. A number of American excavations—such as that at Ozette indigenous village in Washington—were influenced by its multidisciplinary approach.

===Disney Chair: 1952–72===

In 1952, Garrod took an early retirement and Clark was selected as her replacement for the Disney Chair. To mark this status, Cambridge University awarded him an Sc.D degree on the basis of his published work. In this position he avoided formal meetings and made decisions by himself. He failed to obtain many resources for the department from the university administration, with the department therefore remaining small under his tenure. He did however acquire funds to hire a research assistant, the first being Eric Higgs. As chair, he encouraged the staff in his department to prioritise their research over teaching, and to prioritise the teaching of graduates over undergraduates. In this position he had little personal contact with the department&#x27;s students, and encouraged them to go abroad after their education, believing that the best opportunities for archaeological research lay outside Britain. He got on with some of his staff, such as John Coles and McBurney, although not with others, such as Glyn Daniel.

Over the coming years he would also sit on a range of committees, including the Ancient Monuments Board, Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England, the management committee of the Institute of Archaeology, as well as the Prehistoric Society, of whose journal he remained editor. In 1951, he had been elected a Fellow of the British Academy, and in 1953 he gave the Academy&#x27;s Reckitt Archaeological Lecture, which he devoted to a discussion of prehistoric economies.

With his project at Star Carr completed, Clark returned his attention to the excavation of the Iron Age settlement at Micklemoor Hill. He oversaw two further seasons of excavation in 1952 and 1953, which was mostly overseen by Clare Fell, the assistant curator at the Museum of Archaeology.
In 1954, Clark was made aware of Neolithic pottery and worked flints that had been discovered through an excavation at Hurst Fen near Mildenhall in Suffolk. Believing this to be likely evidence of a Neolithic settlement, he oversaw a project of excavation at the site in 1957 and 1958, although left most of the running of the excavation to Higgs. Clark was disappointed that he excavation revealed a number of scatters post-holes and pits but no structures. The site had nevertheless yielded important typological information about Neolithic pottery and provided greater knowledge about the Neolithic period in eastern England. It would prove to be Clark&#x27;s final major excavation.

&quot;Prehistoric Europe&quot; brought Clark wider visibility and resulted in his first opportunity to visit the United States. In 1952 he was asked to attend the inaugural meeting of the Wenner Gren Foundation for Anthropology in New York City. At the event Clark met the American archaeologist Gordon Willey, who became his good friend. In 1957, he returned to the U.S. to teach for a semester as the Grant McCurdy Lecturer at Harvard University. In 1958, Clark published his last piece of original research on the Mesolithic, an article on trapez-shaped microliths for the &quot;Proceedings&quot;. That year he also spent time in France&#x27;s Dordogne region, visiting Lascaux cave and Hallam L. Movius&#x27;s excavation of Abri Pataud.
In 1959, Clark was elected President of the Prehistoric Society. In his presidential address he called for a less Eurocentric and more global focus on research into prehistory. To this end he produced a one-volume history of global prehistory, resulting in &quot;World Prehistory: An Outline&quot;, which was published by Cambridge University Press in 1961. Despite its title, over half of the book was devoted to the prehistory of Western and Central Europe, reflecting how little was known about much of the world&#x27;s distant past at the time. The book proved an immediate success and brought Clark far greater visibility and opportunities.

In 1960, Clark returned to Peacock Farm to oversee a small excavation designed to recover material that could be subjected to the newly developed process of radiocarbon dating. He also grew increasingly interested in Greek prehistory, and gained a permit to excavate the Neolithic Nea Nikomedia mound near Veroia in eastern Macedonia. He did not personally lead the excavation, which took place in 1961, instead leaving that to his student Robert Rodden, who was assisted by fellow students like David L. Clarke, Charles Higham, and Colin Renfrew. After his visited the excavation, Clark proceeded to Turkey to visit James Mellaart excavation of the Neolithic site at Çatalhöyük. Clark then furthered his interest in south-eastern Europe by writing an article for the &quot;Proceedings&quot; which synthesised newly discovered radiocarbon dates to argue that farming originally spread across Europe from Greece and the Western Balkans.

In early 1964, Clark made his first visit to the Antipodes as he spent time as the William Evans Professor at Otago University in New Zealand, using the opportunity to learn more about Maori prehistory. In May of that year he used the Commonwealth Visiting Scholars&#x27; appointment to fund a period in Australia, where he spent time at the University of Sydney, Queensland Museum, and the Australian Museum. He also visited Vincent Megaw&#x27;s excavation of the Curracurrang rock shelter and was taken by Norman Tindale to witness a living hunter-gatherer society at the Papunya indigenous community. In November 1965, he undertook a lecture tour of the U.S., giving talks at Pennsylvania State University, Temple University, the University of Michigan, the University of Chicago, the University of Colorado, and Colorado Women&#x27;s College. That year Hutchinson published a book that Clark had co-written with Piggott, &quot;Prehistoric Societies&quot;, and in 1967 Thames and Hudson published Clark&#x27;s coffee table book, &quot;The Stone Age Hunters&quot;. In 1968, he published a revised second edition of &quot;World Prehistory&quot;, although it attracted criticism from archaeologists studying Africa for making significant errors about that continent. In 1968, he travelled via Moscow to Japan in order to attend the International Conference of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, using the trip to spend time in Taiwan, the Philippines, and New Zealand. In 1969, he was then appointed visiting Hitchcock Professor at the University of California-Berkeley; his lectures there were published as &quot;Aspects of Prehistory&quot; by the University of California Press in 1970. He published a classification system of five &quot;lithic modes&quot; or types of stone tools in 1969, which is still in use today. 

In 1970, Clark retired as editor of the &quot;Proceedings&quot;. In 1972, Clark spent time at Uppsala University as a visiting professor. That same year, Clark returned to the subject of Star Carr to publish a book for undergraduate students, &quot;Star Carr: A Case Study in Bioarchaeology&quot;. Towards the end of his career, Clark was given a range of awards in recognition of his research output: the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Hodgkins Medal in 1967, the Wenner-Gren Foundation&#x27;s Viking Fund Medal in 1971, Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1971, the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Lucy Wharton old Medal in 1974, the Society of Antiquaries&#x27; Gold Medal in 1978, and the Asiatic Society&#x27;s Chandra Medal in 1979. Two festschrift&#x27;s were also produced in his honour: a 1971 volume of the &quot;Proceedings&quot; was devoted to him, while in 1976, Gale de Giberne Sieveking, Ian H. Longworth, and Kenneth E. Wilson produced the edited volume &quot;Problems in Economic and Social Archaeology&quot;, which again was dedicated to Clark.

===Later life: 1973–95===

Clark retired as Disney Professor in 1974. From 1973 until 1980 he served as the Master of Peterhouse, in what became some of the happiest years of his life. In 1975, he revised may of his ideas on Mesolithic Northern Europe for &quot;The Earlier Stone Age Settlement of Scandinavia&quot;. The book was not well received, with many archaeologists working on Scandinavian material deeming it outdated.
In 1976, he made a coast-to-coast trip across Canada, and that year chaired the first meeting of the Science-based Archaeological Committee, which had been established by the Science Research Council in order to distribute funds to archaeological projects.
In 1977, he published a third edition of &quot;World Prehistory&quot;, now retitled &quot;World Prehistory in New Perspective&quot;. From 1974 to 1978, he chaired the British Academy&#x27;s Section Ten, which was devoted to archaeology and anthropology. In 1978 he travelled to New Delhi to attend the Wheeler Memorial Lecture of the Archaeological Survey of India at the invitation of B. K. Thapar.

In 1980, Clark&#x27;s short book, &quot;Mesolithic Prelude&quot; was published, based on his 1979 Munro Lecture. In 1982, Methuen then published Clark&#x27;s &quot;The Identity of Man as Seen by an Archaeologist&quot;, in which he argued that cultural diversity underlay the process of humanisation. The book received few reviews, including one produced by Edmund Leach for &quot;Nature&quot; which was highly critical, arguing that Clark&#x27;s functionalist and culturally evolutionary approach was outdated. He then produced a sequel, &quot;Symbols of Excellence&quot;, which allowed him to discuss his interest in art; it was published by Cambridge University Press in 1986.
In 1989, Clark&#x27;s &quot;Prehistory at Cambridge and Beyond&quot; was published, a work that was part-biography and part-history of archaeology, discussing the broad diaspora of Cambridge-trained archaeologists.
Clark&#x27;s final book, &quot;Space, Time, and Man: A Prehistorian&#x27;s View&quot;, was published by Cambridge University Press in 1992. The book dealt with concepts of time and place throughout the ages and received few reviews on publication. According to Fagan, Clark&#x27;s later books were &quot;based on the values of an earlier time and reflect his profound conservatism&quot;, perhaps explaining why they received so little attention.

In his final years, Clark continued to receive recognition for his achievements. The Netherlands Foundation awarded him the Erasmus Prize in 1990. He divided the £100,000 prize money between the British Academy and the Prehistoric Society, allowing both to establish their own prizes. In 1992, the British state then awarded him a knighthood. While on a cruise in the eastern Mediterranean with his wife, Clark suffered a serious stroke in June 1995, requiring a return home. There, he died in Cambridge on 12 September 1995. A memorial service was held at Little St Mary&#x27;s, Cambridge. One of his fellow staff members at Cambridge, John Coles, was appointed literary executor of his books and papers.

==Archaeological approach==

According to Fagan, Clark was &quot;more concerned with &quot;what&quot; happened [in the past] rather than &quot;how&quot; or &quot;why&quot;.&quot; The archaeologist John Mulvaney stated that, in contrast to the tendency of Childe and other archaeologists to focus on artefact typologies, Clark&#x27;s &quot;vibrant world embraced landscape, economy and social themes, not simply labelled artefacts&quot;. This was reflected in the changing definitions of archaeology that Clark used; in 1927 he claimed that archaeology was &quot;the study of past distribution of culture-traits in time and space, and of the factors governing their distribution&quot;, while in 1939 he referred to it as &quot;the study of how men lived in the past&quot;.

Clark was fascinated by prehistoric subsistence and social patterns.
His approach to prehistory was rooted in the notion that the human race was biologically united and that human diversity arose from responses to changing environments. Smith believed that as of 1939, Clark had become a functionalist. 
From 1972 onward, Clark became heavily involved in the use of newly developed scientific techniques for the analysis of archaeological material. Influenced by German and Scandinavian archaeological models, Clark drew on folklore and ethnography to gain a better understanding of prehistoric modes of subsistence. He nevertheless did not use such analogies uncritically, believing that they were mostly of use when there was a continuous historical link between older and more recent communities and where they both lived in very similar environmental conditions.

Clark encountered the development of processual archaeology during the mid-20th century, when his student David L. Clarke became one of its key proponents. The proponents of processualism, then referred to as the &quot;New Archaeology&quot;, often rejected what they regarded as the old guard in the profession. Clark stayed out of the theoretical debates between the processualists and adherents of older schools of thought, although in a letter to Coles expressed &quot;distress&quot; at what he saw as students forcing archaeological data to fit their preconceived notions. He rejected the idea that archaeology was a pure science, claiming that this was misguided and &quot;also pathetic&quot;.

==Personal life==

Physically, Clark was tall and thin, and in his personal life he was intensely private. Fagan described him as &quot;an imposing, remote man who hid his feelings&quot;, while presenting &quot;an austere, sometimes forbidding exterior&quot;. Coles similarly regarded him as aloof figure, but nevertheless thought that he was &quot;basically a sympathetic and kind man&quot;. Clark was awkward around his students, who were often a little afraid of him. His lecture style was regarded as dry and not entertaining. Clark&#x27;s biographer noted that his teaching was &quot;at best pedestrian&quot;, and that he had a &quot;reputation for poorly prepared lectures&quot;, rendering him unpopular as a teacher. According to Coles, Clark&#x27;s lectures &quot;were generally considered to be rather poorly constructed, and he often wandered from the subject in hand&quot;. In several cases he was reported to have given the wrong lecture to a class.

According to Fagan, Clark had a &quot;competitive personality&quot; and &quot;craved recognition and an international reputation&quot;. Although he had many acquaintances within the archaeological community, he had few friendships with other archaeologists; according to Fagan, he was &quot;not necessarily universally beloved&quot;. He annoyed colleagues by quickly turning any conversations into a talk about his own research. Daniel for instance noted that there was &quot;an alarming and chilling self-centredness [in Clark]. It was so difficult to conduct any reasonable conversation&quot; with him. Mulvaney, who was one of his students, noted that in supervisory meetings, the &quot;austere and busy&quot; Clark &quot;wasted time with derisory gossip concerning his peers, tainted with dogmatic political assertions&quot;. Mulvaney nevertheless felt that Clark&#x27;s &quot;personality blemishes were worth enduring. As years passed he became helpful and friendly.&quot;

Fagan noted that Clark was one of the four men who dominated British archaeology during the 1950s and early 1960s, along with the Edinburgh-based Piggott, the Cardiff-based Roger Atkinson, and the Oxford-based Christopher Hawkes. Clark&#x27;s relationship with these colleagues was mixed; Piggott was a lifelong friend, although Hawkes became his &quot;long-term intellectual adversary&quot;. The two publicly disagreed strongly on the place of migration and cultural diffusion in British prehistory; Hawkes believed that cultural development and change was brought about primarily by migration into Britain, whereas Clark argued in favour of indigenous cultural evolution as the best explanation for such changes.

Throughout his life, Clark remained a practising Christian. Politically, he was deeply conservative, an ideological standpoint nurtured since his youth. In books like &quot;The Identity of Man&quot;, Clark promoted what he saw as the benefits of social hierarchy, viewing socio-economic inequalities as an impetus towards liberty and believing that unequal levels of consumption allowed for humanity&#x27;s greatest artistic and cultural creations. In response to these claims, Leach described Clark&#x27;s political beliefs as &quot;lying well to the right&quot; of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. An elitist, Clark believed strongly in the importance of individual achievement and human progress, believing that humanity&#x27;s future lay in the ability of people from different cultures and ideologies to co-operate in order to solve those problems that they had in common.

Clark was dedicated to his family. According to Coles, his wife Mollie &quot;became an indispensable part of Clark&#x27;s academic life as well as a source of immense happiness to him&quot;. After their wedding, the Clarks purchased a house in Barton Road, Cambridge. They lived away from this house during the first part of the Second World War, although they returned in 1944. Here, Clark took an interest in gardening and proudly displayed his garden to visitors. Clark had a love of dinghy sailing, and for many years had a houseboat at the coastal town of Aldeburgh. When the boat became too dilapidated he replaced it with a cottage in the town in 1957.
Clark spent much of his leisure time visiting art galleries, and in later life he began collecting art, as well as Chinese porcelain and Asian jade.

==Reception and legacy==

For Fagan, Clark was &quot;one of the most important prehistorians of the twentieth century&quot;, an individual whose &quot;intellectual influence on archaeology was enormous&quot;, producing a &quot;legacy to prehistory [that] will endure for generations&quot;. The historian Adam Stout noted that Clark was &quot;one of the century&#x27;s most influential prehistorians&quot;.
Coles similarly noted that he was &quot;one of the founders of European and world-wide prehistoric studies, and there are many now who would assert his primacy in these fields over all other prehistorians of the 20th century&quot;.

Coles noted that among continental European scholars, Clark was &quot;the most respected British prehistorian&quot; of his generation. Clark&#x27;s work was however little known in the United States, where it was eclipsed in the 1960s by the growth of processual archaeology. A less grandiose assessment was left by the archaeologist Pamela Jane Smith, who stated that Clark made &quot;major contributions to the establishment of prehistory as an academic subject at Cambridge University&quot;.

The archaeologists Arkadiusz Marciniak and John Coles stated that Clark was one of the &quot;eminent archaeologists&quot; who helped to establish prehistoric archaeology as a &quot;fully professional discipline&quot; with explicitly outlined goals and methods and an institutional foundation. 
He was a pioneer in ecological, functionalist approaches to archaeology, as well as the first archaeologist to write a global prehistory of humankind.

In November 1997, a Grahame Clark Memorial Conference was held at the British Academy in London. It was at the conference that John Coles invited Fagan to write Clark&#x27;s biography. In 2007, an academic symposium was held to mark the centenary of Clark&#x27;s birth at the Archaeology Museum of Biskupin in Poland; it was co-organised by the museum with the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Committee of Pre- and Proto-historical Sciences. On the basis of the conference, in 2010, Marciniak and Coles published a co-edited volume titled &quot;Grahame Clark and His Legacy&quot;. They noted that up to that point there had been &quot;little in-depth assessment&quot; of Clark&#x27;s influence in archaeology, in particular in contrast to the large number of Childe.

<text>Cromer Academy (formerly Cromer High School, Sports College, Cromer Institute of Science, Cromer Language College) is a 11- 16 secondary school with academy status in Cromer, Norfolk. It is part of the Inspiration Trust federation.

==Description==
The school is coeducational and students are admitted without regard to ability. It is part of a partnership of schools known as the Cromer Campus, with the neighbouring Suffield Park Infants and Cromer Junior School.

In December 2016, the school was rated &quot;good&quot; by Ofsted. They found a smaller than average comprehensive school, with just 495 students who are mainly white British, with a below average number from minority ethnic groups and similarly a lower than average number of students with Special Educational Needs.

On 2 March 2018, Dr Geoff Baker replaced Penny Bignell as the school&#x27;s principal. The Eastern Daily Press reported upon Dr Baker&#x27;s departure that Ofstead assessed he provided &quot;inspirational leadership&quot; and contributed highlights such as &quot;Les Day&quot; in which a day was held in honour of caretaker Les Sadler after he was given a community award. On 1 June 2020, Darren Hollingsworth replaced Stewart Little as the school&#x27;s principal.

== Curriculum and Enrichment==
Virtually all maintained schools and academies follow the National Curriculum, and are inspected by Ofsted on how well they succeed in delivering a &#x27;broad and balanced curriculum&#x27;. The school has to decide whether Key Stage 3 contains years 7, 8 and 9- or whether and year 9 should be in Key Stage 4 so the students will just study their chosen GCSE exam subjects for the final three years. Cromer has selected the three year Key Stage 3 so in Years 7-9 all students study the core curriculum of math, English, and science, with art, computer science, design technology, drama, geography, history, the modern language (French or Spanish, music, philosophy, and physical education). There are sessions covering personal, social, and health issues.
Ofsted judged the school to have &#x27;outstanding management&#x27; and commented on the school&#x27;s efforts to stretch the more able and support the weak. Bullying was non-existent and pupils felt safe and cared for.

In Key Stage 4 students still do the 30-period week, and lessons are still 55 minutes long, but there is an element of choice. Half the week is spent studying the core subjects of mathematics, double English and science with a compulsory language, and a compulsory Humanity in addition. These are the subjects demanded to achieve the English Baccalaureate. They can choose two optional subjects from art, performing arts, music, design technology (DT), computer science, sport, photography, philosophy and not psychology, and Statistics or further sport.

<text>The Bucharest University of Economic Studies (, abbreviated &quot;ASE&quot;) is a public university in Bucharest, Romania. Founded in 1913 as the &quot;Academy of Higher-level Commercial and Industrial Studies&quot; (&quot;Academia de Înalte Studii Comerciale și Industriale&quot; (AISCI)), it has become one of the largest economic higher education institutes in both Romania and South-Eastern Europe. The Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies is classified as an &quot;advanced research and education university&quot; by the Ministry of Education. It is one of the five members of the &quot;Universitaria Consortium&quot; (the group of elite Romanian universities).

==History==
Established on 6 April 1913 by the Royal Decree of Carol I of Romania, the Academy of Higher-level Commercial and Industrial Studies was the first economic higher education institution established in Romania.

In 1947, the academy was reorganised and merged with the Academy of Cooperative Studies to form the &quot;Academy of Commercial and Cooperative Studies&quot;. During the Communist Era, in August 1948, it turned into the &quot;Institute for Economic Sciences and Planning&quot;, according to the model provided by the Soviet higher education institutions.

During the 1967–1968 academic year, the institute was reorganised again and became the Bucharest University of Economic Studies, a name which the university still holds today.

== Institution ==

The Bucharest University of Economic Studies has 22,684 students (undergraduate and graduate levels) in eleven faculties.

The university has positioned itself as a research institution, hosting 13 centers of research acknowledged and endorsed by the National Council of Scientific Research in Higher Education.

A notable presence inside ASE is the Business Information Technology department (Romanian: Informatică Economică) which is an entity that promotes an educational philosophy based on combining economics and software development as a way of creating experts suitable for the Information Age.

== Format and length of studies ==
In the 1970s and 1980s, master&#x27;s degrees in economics were awarded to full-time students after 4 years of study, except for the Faculty of &#x27;Cibernetics and Informatics&#x27;, which required one additional year.

After 1990, Undergraduate studies at the Bucharest University of Economic Studies ended with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Economics, while acquiring a second specialization according to the department where they were enrolled. Up to 2005, undergraduate studies at the Academy of Economic Studies consisted of a four-year cycle (five-year cycle for the Faculty of &#x27;Cibernetics and Informatics&#x27;). Master studies would continue for two more years, and doctoral programmes would normally be three years long.

Since 2005 however, the university has adopted the Bologna declaration and undergraduate studies are now three-year long, followed by 2-year Master programmes. In this format, undergraduate studies finalize with a total of 180 credits, graduate programmes require a completion of 120 credits. The PhD programmes remain with a length of minimum three years.

==Ranking==
ASE was ranked by the Times Higher Education World University Ranking 2021 as the best university in Romania. Top Shanghai 2018 ranked ASE as the best university in Economics in Romania and 201–300 worldwide. QS World University Rankings 2017 also ranked ASE as the best university in Economics and Econometrics in Romania and 301–350 worldwide.

== Faculties ==
There are thirteen faculties: 
* FABIZ - &quot;Administrarea Afacerilor cu predare în limbi străine&quot; (Business Administration in Foreign Languages);

<text>The Battle of Pulkkila was fought between Swedish and Russian forces near Pulkkila in Northern Ostrobothnia on 2 May 1808 during the Finnish War.

At the battle of Pulkkila on 2 May 1808, Johan August Sandels marched eastwards to liberate those parts of Finland that were under Russian control. During the march they encountered some Russian troops at Pulkkila. Sandels used about 800 men for the attack; of which 350 from the Västerbotten Regiment and 80 from the Savolax jägers. The Russian troops were led by Colonel Obuhov. The Russians were soon surrounded and tried desperately to break out, but they were forced back to a nearby village where the Russians were defeated after some vicious fighting. The Russian commander was forced to surrender to the attacking Swedes. The Swedes then went on and retook the town of Kuopio in the middle of Finland.

Sandels&#x27; offensive was one of the most remarkable operations of the entire war. During his operations against Barclay de Tolly&#x27;s troops, he captured Russian depots, constantly harassed their rear areas, and committed actions that won him respect among both friends and foes.

However, Swedish success was only temporary in the Summer Campaign 1808 and the Russian counteroffensive resulted in the Swedish retreat in late August 1808.

<doc id="1239853" wikidata="Q509102" url="?curid=1239853" title="Evelyn Lear">
<text>Evelyn Shulman Lear (January 8, 1926 – July 1, 2012) was an American operatic soprano. Between 1959 and 1992, she appeared in more than forty operatic roles, appeared with every major opera company in the United States and won a Grammy Award in 1966. She was well known for her musical versatility, having sung all three main female roles in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;. Lear was also known for her work on 20th century pieces by Robert Ward, Alban Berg, Marvin David Levy, Rudolf Kelterborn and Giselher Klebe. She was married to the American bass-baritone Thomas Stewart until his death in 2006.

==Life and career==
Lear was born as Evelyn Shulman in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Nina (Kwartin), a coloratura, and Nathan Shulman, and granddaughter of the distinguished cantor Zavel Kwartin. Her family was Russian Jewish. She completed her musical education at Hunter College, New York University and the Juilliard School of Music studying voice, piano, French horn and composition. She married Walter Lear, a physician and later political activist, divorcing in the mid-1950s. While at Juilliard she studied under Sergius Kagen and met her future husband, baritone Thomas Stewart. Both Lear and Stewart won Fulbright scholarships to study at Hochschule für Musik in Berlin where she studied with Maria Ivogün. She later studied singing with Beverley Peck Johnson.

Lear started her opera career as a member of the Städtische Oper Berlin in Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; playing the Composer, a lead role which she would later play at a number of leading opera houses. She played the title role in Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot; in 1960 in its Austrian debut in concert form. She had only three weeks to learn the role, having been called in as a late replacement. Her performance was so well received that she played the role in the first staged version since World War II at the Theater an der Wien at the Vienna Festival of 1962 with Karl Böhm conducting. The performance was repeated in 1964 and recorded by Deutsche Grammophon. She also performed in &quot;Lulu&quot; in the late 1980s, albeit in the mezzo-soprano supporting role of the Countess Geschwitz. She appeared as Nina Cavallini in Robert Altman&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull&#x27;s History Lesson&quot;. In 1989, she played the role of Queen Elizabeth I of England in the musical &quot;Elizabeth and Essex&quot;, based on Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s 1930 play.

==Creation of roles==
Lear created a number of roles during her career. In 1955, having just graduated from Juilliard, she created the role of the heroine Nina in Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot; – a role that would prompt Leonard Bernstein to name his daughter Nina. In 1961, she created the title role of Giselher Klebe&#x27;s &quot;Alkmene&quot; in Berlin. Two years later, she created another role as Jeanne in Werner Egk&#x27;s &quot;Die Verlobung in San Domingo&quot; in the reopening of the Munich Nationaltheater. Her debut with the Metropolitan Opera came with the creation of the role of Lavinia Mannon in the world premiere of Marvin David Levy&#x27;s &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; in 1967.

Soon after this she experienced vocal problems, losing much of her upper range and clarity, which she blamed on singing so much modern music. This did not stop her performing modern roles, however. In 1974, she created the role of Irma Arkadina in Thomas Pasatieri&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; at the Houston Grand Opera. Lear created the role of Magna in Robert Ward&#x27;s &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot; in 1982, followed by creating the role of Ranyevskaya in Rudolf Kelterborn&#x27;s &quot;Der Kirschgarten&quot; in Zurich in 1984.

==Association with Richard Strauss==
Lear enjoyed success performing Richard Strauss&#x27;s works. She made her London debut in a performance of the &quot;Four Last Songs&quot;. Her longest association, however, has been with &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; having performed all three major female roles. She sang the role of Sophie in regional German opera houses with the Berlin State Opera, progressing to sing the role of Octavian in major opera houses in Vienna, Berlin and New York. Her greatest success in this opera was her role as the Marschallin which she debuted in 1971 and played in leading opera houses including La Scala and her farewell performance at the Metropolitan in 1985.

==Honors and awards==
The Senate of Berlin gave Lear the title of Kammersängerin for her contribution to the opera in that city while the Salzburg Festival honored her with the Max Reinhardt Award. She won a Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording in the Grammy Awards of 1966 for her work with Karl Böhm, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Fritz Wunderlich and the German Opera and Chorus for their performance of Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot;.

==Family==
Lear and Thomas Stewart married in 1955 and were together until his death on 24 September 2006, aged 78. She had two children by her previous marriage. Lear died on July 1, 2012, at Brook Grove nursing center in Sandy Spring, Maryland, aged 86.

<text>The California spiny lobster (&quot;Panulirus interruptus&quot;) is a species of spiny lobster found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Monterey Bay, California, to the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico. It typically grows to a length of and is a reddish-brown color with stripes along the legs, and has a pair of enlarged antennae but no claws. The interrupted grooves across the tail are characteristic for the species.

Females can carry up to 680,000 eggs, which hatch after 10 weeks into flat &quot;phyllosoma&quot; larvae. These feed on plankton before the metamorphosis into the juvenile state. Adults are nocturnal and migratory, living among rocks at depths of up to , and feeding on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. The spiny lobster is eaten by various fish, octopuses and sea otters, but can defend itself with a loud noise produced by its antennae. The California spiny lobster is the subject of both commercial and recreational fishery in both Mexico and the United States, with sport fishermen using hoop nets and commercial fishermen using lobster traps.

==Description==
In common with all spiny lobsters, the California spiny lobster has two large, spiny antennae, but no large claws on its legs. The California spiny lobster is one of the largest spiny lobster species, and grows up to long, but does not usually exceed . Males can weigh up to ., with the record being a 16 lbs., 1 oz. male caught off Catalina island in 1968. The upper side of the animal is brownish red, without the paler bands or spots seen in some other spiny lobsters. The legs are a similar color, but with one or more lighter streaks running along their length.

Males and females of all ages can be distinguished by the position of the two round genital openings or gonopores. In females, they are at the bases of the third pair of pereiopods, while in males they are at the base of the fifth (last) pereiopods, furthest from the head and the closest to the abdomen. Mature females have a small claw on the fifth pereiopod, and enlarged pleopods.

==Distribution==
The California spiny lobster is found in parts of the Gulf of California, and along the Pacific coast of the length of the Baja California peninsula, extending as far north as San Luis Obispo Bay, California. There are occasional records from Monterey Bay, but the water there is too cold for the California spiny lobster to breed, and it is thought that any adult found in Central California arrived as a larva during El Niño years.

California spiny lobsters live on rocky substrates, at depths of up to . Although adults can be found in shallow water, including tide pools, they are more frequent in deeper waters. Juveniles generally inhabit rocky habitats at a depth of with dense plant cover, especially the surf grass &quot;Phyllospadix torreyi&quot;.

==Ecology and behavior==

California spiny lobsters are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, with only the tips of their long antennae showing, as a means of avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the spiny lobsters form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.

Natural predators of the California spiny lobster include bony fish such as the California sheephead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks including the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file on the edge of the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.

There is an annual migration, in which spiny lobsters enter shallower water in spring and summer, and head out to deeper water in fall and winter, reaching depths as great as , perhaps to avoid the effects of winter storms.

==Life cycle==

Female California spiny lobsters reach sexual maturity at a length of , which is typically at an age of 5–9 years; males are sexually mature after 3–6 years. Because all the hard parts are lost at each molt, the life span of mature spiny lobsters is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.

Spiny lobsters do not have the gonopods (first pleopods modified for reproduction) that occur in clawed lobsters and crabs, and females do not have a deep pocket on the sternum in which to store sperm. Instead, a spermatophore is transferred directly from one of the male&#x27;s gonopores to the sternum of the female. The male gonopore is, however, adorned with a &quot;penile process&quot;, which is straight and serrated, with a small &quot;hairbrush&quot;. The sternum of mature females has three &quot;windows&quot; on the last three segments, which uniquely among &quot;Panulirus&quot; species, span both halves of the sternum. These windows are softer than the rest of the exoskeleton, and are thought to help the male locate the correct location to place the tar-like spermatophore.

After mating, the fertilized eggs are carried on the female&#x27;s pleopods until they hatch, with between 120,000 and 680,000 carried by a single female. The eggs begin coral red, but darken as they develop to a deep maroon. When she is carrying the eggs, the female is said to be &quot;berried&quot;. The eggs are ready to hatch after 10 weeks, and spawning takes place from May to August, The larvae that hatch (called &quot;phyllosoma&quot; larvae) do not resemble the adults. Instead, they are flat, transparent animals around long, but as thin as a sheet of paper. The larvae feed on plankton, and grow through ten molts into ten further larval stages, the last of which is around long. The full series of larval molts takes around 7 months, and when the last stage molts, it metamorphoses into the &quot;puerulus&quot; state, the final larval stage, still transparent. The puerulus larvae settle to the sea floor when the water is near its maximum temperature, which in Baja California is in the fall.

The diet of the juveniles is varied, but comprises mostly amphipods and isopods, together with coralline algae and the plant &quot;Phyllospadix&quot;. When available, the juveniles prefer to eat crabs.

==Fishery==
In his original description, John Witt Randall noted that the California spiny lobster is &quot;used as food by the natives&quot; of Upper California. The California spiny lobster is now the most economically important lobster on the American West Coast. Sport fishing may account for up to half the entire catch, while most of the commercial catch comes from lobster traps, with smaller amounts coming from the use of trammel nets or by trawling. The major fishing area is west of Baja California, and imports from Mexico to the United States are twice the amount produced in California.

===Sport fishing in California===

Recreational fishermen are allowed to catch lobsters with hoop nets or by SCUBA diving or free-diving; almost all come from California, with only small numbers from other U.S. states. The California Department of Fish and Game estimates that recreational fishers caught more than 200,000 spiny lobsters in the first half of the 2008/2009 season, amounting to around , compared to commercial fishermen, who caught a total of in the same time.

The California Department of Fish and Game sets and enforces a number of regulations pertaining to recreational fishing of spiny lobsters:
# Open season for California spiny lobster runs from the Saturday before the first Wednesday in October until the first Wednesday after March 15.
# No implements other than hoop nets may be used; no one person may have more than 5 nets and no vessel may use more than 10 hoop nets. When fishing from land, each fisherman is limited to two hoop nets.
# Lobster fishers may not land more than seven California spiny lobsters on any given day, and may not have more than seven in their possession at any time.
# Fishers must carry a lobster gauge, and any lobster smaller than the minimum landing size must be returned to the sea immediately. The minimum size is a carapace length of , measured along the midline from the rear of the eye socket between the horns, to the end of the carapace. This is equivalent to a total body length of .
# To fish for spiny lobster south of Point Arguello, a sport fishing license with ocean enhancement stamp must be displayed or kept nearby.
# A report card for the season must be bought, filled in and returned before April 30 after the season ends.
# Commercial and recreational traps must not be interfered with.

===Commercial fishing in California===
The open season for commercial fishing begins on the first Wednesday in October and runs until the first Wednesday after the 15th of March. Commercial fishermen may use individually buoyed traps, but may not dive for lobsters.

For those using lobster traps, the fishing effort is greatest at the beginning of the permitted season in California, and peters out towards the end of the season, 24 weeks later. Although the fishing effort becomes better concentrated on areas with more spiny lobsters during the season, the fishing efficiency (catch per unit effort) nonetheless decreases throughout the season.

===Fishing in Mexico===
In Mexico, spiny lobsters are an important commercial resource, representing the fifth most valuable fishery, worth US$18 million. Three species are exploited along the Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula, but the catch of 744 t of the California spiny lobster makes up 95%–97% of the total, with only small quantities of &quot;Panulirus inflatus&quot; and &quot;Panulirus gracilis&quot;. The fishing rights are held by 26 local co-operatives.

The main legal restrictions on fishing for California spiny lobster in Mexico are a minimum landing size of , the prohibition of catching berried females, and a closed season: from February 16 to September 14, fishing for spiny lobsters is prohibited in a region which moves south along Mexico&#x27;s Pacific coast during the season.

The Mexican fishery for the California spiny lobster was the first Latin American fishery to be awarded the Marine Stewardship Council&#x27;s sustainable fishery ecolabel, and the species is classed as &quot;Least Concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List.

==Names==
&quot;Panulirus interruptus&quot; is called the &quot;California spiny lobster&quot; by the Food and Agriculture Organization, but a number of other local, vernacular names exist, including &quot;California lobster&quot;, &quot;California marine crayfish&quot;, and &quot;red lobster&quot; in the United States, and &#x27; and &#x27; in Mexico. The preferred common name of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is simply &quot;spiny lobster&quot;.

John Witt Randall described the species in the &quot;Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia&quot; in 1840, based on material given to him by Thomas Nuttall. The exact locality is not known, being given only as &quot;Upper California&quot;, but the most likely sources are the places where Nuttall was most active, namely Santa Barbara and San Diego. The specific epithet &quot;interruptus&quot; refers to the grooves on the abdominal tergites, which are interrupted in this species. Although originally placed in the genus &quot;Palinurus&quot;, the California spiny lobster was later transferred to Adam White&#x27;s new genus &quot;Panulirus&quot;, together with other spiny lobsters that have long flagella on their first antennae.

==Related species==
The closest relatives are not the other species that occur in the East Pacific, but rather &quot;Panulirus argus&quot; from the Caribbean Sea and West Pacific species such as &quot;Panulirus japonicus&quot;, &quot;Panulirus marginatus&quot;, &quot;Panulirus pascuensis&quot;, &quot;Panulirus cygnus&quot; and &quot;Panulirus longipes&quot;; this relationship has been recovered from comparative studies of adult and larval morphology, as well as from molecular phylogenetics, using the sequences from cytochrome c oxidase and 16S ribosomal RNA genes.

The California spiny lobster can be differentiated from the other species in the genus by the interrupted grooves across the abdomen; other species either lack grooves, or have grooves which span the entire body segment.

<text>Population figures for the Indigenous peoples of the Americas before European colonization have been difficult to establish. Estimates have varied widely from as low as 8 million to as many as 100 million, though many scholars gravitated toward an estimate of around 50 million by the end of the 20th century.

The monarchs of the nascent Spanish Empire decided to fund Christopher Columbus&#x27; voyage in 1492, leading to the establishment of colonies and marking the beginning of the migration of millions of Europeans and Africans to the Americas. While the population of European settlers, primarily from Spain, Portugal, France, England, and the Netherlands, along with African slaves, grew steadily, the Indigenous population plummeted. There are numerous reasons for the population decline, including exposure to Eurasian diseases such as influenza, pneumonic plagues, and smallpox; direct violence by settlers and their allies through war and forced removal; and the general disruption of societies. Scholarly disputes remain over the degree to which each factor contributed or should be emphasized; some modern scholars have categorized it as a genocide, claiming that deliberate, systematic actions by Europeans were the primary cause. Traditional scholars have disputed this characterization, maintaining that incidental disease exposure was the primary cause.

==Population overview==

Pre-Columbian population figures are difficult to estimate because of the fragmentary nature of the evidence. Estimates range from 8–112 million. Scholars have varied widely on the estimated size of the Indigenous populations prior to colonization and on the effects of European contact. Estimates are made by extrapolations from small bits of data. In 1976, geographer William Denevan used the existing estimates to derive a &quot;consensus count&quot; of about 54 million people. Nonetheless, more recent estimates still range widely. In 1992, Denevan suggested that the total population was approximately 53.9 million and the populations by region were, approximately, 3.8 million for the United States and Canada, 17.2 million for Mexico, 5.6 million for Central America, 3 million for the Caribbean, 15.7 million for the Andes and 8.6 million for lowland South America. A 2020 genetic study suggests that prior estimates for the pre-Columbian Caribbean population may have been at least tenfold too large. Historian David Stannard estimates that the extermination of Indigenous peoples took the lives of 100 million people: &quot;...the total extermination of many American Indian peoples and the near-extermination of others, in numbers that eventually totaled close to 100,000,000.&quot; A 2019 study estimates the pre-Columbian Indigenous population contained more than 60 million people, but dropped to 6 million by 1600, based on a drop in atmospheric during that period. Other studies have disputed this conclusion.

The Indigenous population of the Americas in 1492 was not necessarily at a high point and may actually have already been in decline in some areas. Indigenous populations in most areas of the Americas reached a low point by the early 20th century.

Using an estimate of approximately 37 million people in Mexico, Central and South America in 1492 (including 6 million in the Aztec Empire, 5–10 million in the Mayan States, 11 million in what is now Brazil, and 12 million in the Inca Empire), the lowest estimates give a population decrease from all causes of 80% by the end of the 17th century (nine million people in 1650). Latin America would match its 15th-century population early in the 19th century; it numbered 17 million in 1800, 30 million in 1850, 61 million in 1900, 105 million in 1930, 218 million in 1960, 361 million in 1980, and 563 million in 2005. In the last three decades of the 16th century, the population of present-day Mexico dropped to about one million people. The Maya population is today estimated at six million, which is about the same as at the end of the 15th century, according to some estimates. In what is now Brazil, the Indigenous population declined from a pre-Columbian high of an estimated four million to some 300,000. Over 60 million Brazilians possess at least one Native South American ancestor, according to a DNA study.

While it is difficult to determine exactly how many Natives lived in North America before Columbus, estimates range from 3.8 million, as mentioned above, to 7 million people to a high of 18 million. Scholars vary on the estimated size of the Indigenous population in what is now Canada prior to colonization and on the effects of European contact. During the late 15th century is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 currently accepted by Canada&#x27;s Royal Commission on Aboriginal Health. Although not without conflict, European Canadians&#x27; early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. However repeated outbreaks of European infectious diseases such as influenza, measles, and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), combined with other effects of European contact, resulted in a twenty-five percent to eighty percent Indigenous population decrease post-contact. Roland G Robertson suggests that during the late 1630s, smallpox killed over half of the Wyandot (Huron), who controlled most of the early North American fur trade in the area of New France. In 1871 there was an enumeration of the Indigenous population within the limits of Canada at the time, showing a total of only 102,358 individuals. From 2006 to 2016, the Indigenous population has grown by 42.5 percent, four times the national rate. According to the 2011 Canadian census, Indigenous peoples (First Nations – 851,560, Inuit – 59,445 and Métis – 451,795) numbered at 1,400,685, or 4.3% of the country&#x27;s total population.

The population debate has often had ideological underpinnings. Low estimates were sometimes reflective of European notions of cultural and racial superiority. Historian Francis Jennings argued, &quot;Scholarly wisdom long held that Indians were so inferior in mind and works that they could not possibly have created or sustained large populations.&quot; In 1998, Africanist Historian David Henige said many population estimates are the result of arbitrary formulas applied from unreliable sources.

== Estimations ==
=== Estimations by tribe ===
Population size for Native American tribes is very difficult to state definitively, but at least one writer has made estimates, often based on an assumed proportion of the number of warriors to total population for the tribe. Typical proportions were 5 people per one warrior and at least 1 up to 5 warriors (therefore at least 5–25 people) per lodge, cabin or house.

The total peak population size only for the tribes listed in this table is 3,529,240 in the US and Canada (including 507,675 in Canada). This number is very similar to Snow&#x27;s estimate for the US and Canada and to Alchon&#x27;s, Denevan&#x27;s and Milner&#x27;s estimates.

== Pre-Columbian Americas ==

Genetic diversity and population structure in the American land mass using DNA micro-satellite markers (genotype) sampled from North, Central, and South America have been analyzed against similar data available from other Indigenous populations worldwide. The Amerindian populations show a lower genetic diversity than populations from other continental regions. Decreasing genetic diversity with increasing geographic distance from the Bering Strait can be seen, as well as a decreasing genetic similarity to Siberian populations from Alaska (genetic entry point). A higher level of diversity and lower level of population structure in western South America compared to eastern South America is observed. A relative lack of differentiation between Mesoamerican and Andean populations is a scenario that implies coastal routes were easier than inland routes for migrating peoples (Paleo-Indians) to traverse. The overall pattern that is emerging suggests that the Americas were recently colonized by a small number of individuals (effective size of about 70–250), and then they grew by a factor of 10 over 800–1,000 years. The data also show that there have been genetic exchanges between Asia, the Arctic and Greenland since the initial peopling of the Americas. A new study in early 2018 suggests that the effective population size of the original founding population of Native Americans was about 250 people.

==Depopulation by Old World diseases==

Early explanations for the population decline of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas include the brutal practices of the Spanish conquistadores, as recorded by the Spaniards themselves, such as the encomienda system, which was ostensibly set up to protect people from warring tribes as well as to teach them the Spanish language and the Catholic religion, but in practice was tantamount to serfdom and slavery. The most notable account was that of the Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas, whose writings vividly depict Spanish atrocities committed in particular against the Taínos. The second European explanation was a perceived divine approval, in which God removed the Indigenous peoples as part of His &quot;divine plan&quot; to make way for a new Christian civilization. Many Native Americans viewed their troubles in a religious framework within their own belief systems.

According to later academics such as Noble David Cook, a community of scholars began &quot;quietly accumulating piece by piece data on early epidemics in the Americas and their relation to the subjugation of native peoples.&quot; Scholars like Cook believe that widespread epidemic disease, to which the Indigenous peoples had no prior exposure or resistance, was the primary cause of the massive population decline of the Native Americans. One of the most devastating diseases was smallpox, but other deadly diseases included typhus, measles, influenza, bubonic plague, cholera, malaria, tuberculosis, mumps, yellow fever, and pertussis, which were chronic in Eurasia.

However, recently scholars have studied the link between physical colonial violence such as warfare, displacement, and enslavement, and the proliferation of disease among Native populations. For example, according to Coquille scholar Dina Gilio-Whitaker, &quot;In recent decades, however, researchers challenge the idea that disease is solely responsible for the rapid Indigenous population decline. The research identifies other aspects of European contact that had profoundly negative impacts on Native peoples&#x27; ability to survive foreign invasion: war, massacres, enslavement, overwork, deportation, the loss of will to live or reproduce, malnutrition and starvation from the breakdown of trade networks, and the loss of subsistence food production due to land loss.&quot;

Further, Andrés Reséndez of the University of California, Davis points out that, even though the Spanish were aware of deadly diseases such as smallpox, there is no mention of them in the New World until 1519, implying that, until that date, epidemic disease played no significant part in the depopulation of the Antilles. The practices of forced labor, brutal punishment, and inadequate necessities of life, were the initial and major reasons for depopulation. Jason Hickel estimates that a third of Arawak workers died every six months from forced labor in these mines. In this way, &quot;slavery has emerged as a major killer&quot; of the Indigenous populations of the Caribbean between 1492 and 1550, as it set the conditions for diseases such as smallpox, influenza, and malaria to flourish. Unlike the populations of Europe who rebounded following the Black Death, no such rebound occurred for the Indigenous populations.

Similarly, historian Jeffrey Ostler at the University of Oregon has argued that population collapses in North America throughout colonization were not due mainly to lack of Native immunity to European disease. Instead, he claims that &quot;When severe epidemics did hit, it was often less because Native bodies lacked immunity than because European colonialism disrupted Native communities and damaged their resources, making them more vulnerable to pathogens.&quot; In specific regard to Spanish colonization of northern Florida and southeastern Georgia, Native peoples there &quot;were subject to forced labor and, because of poor living conditions and malnutrition, succumbed to wave after wave of unidentifiable diseases.&quot; Further, in relation to British colonization in the Northeast, Algonquian speaking tribes in Virginia and Maryland &quot;suffered from a variety of diseases, including malaria, typhus, and possibly smallpox.&quot; These diseases were not solely a case of Native susceptibility, however, because &quot;as colonists took their resources, Native communities were subject to malnutrition, starvation, and social stress, all making people more vulnerable to pathogens. Repeated epidemics created additional trauma and population loss, which in turn disrupted the provision of healthcare.&quot; Such conditions would continue, alongside rampant disease in Native communities, throughout colonization, the formation of the United States, and multiple forced removals, as Ostler explains that many scholars &quot;have yet to come to grips with how U.S. expansion created conditions that made Native communities acutely vulnerable to pathogens and how severely disease impacted them. ... Historians continue to ignore the catastrophic impact of disease and its relationship to U.S. policy and action even when it is right before their eyes.&quot;

Historian David Stannard says that by &quot;focusing almost entirely on disease ... contemporary authors increasingly have created the impression that the eradication of those tens of millions of people was inadvertent—a sad, but both inevitable and &quot;unintended consequence&quot; of human migration and progress,&quot; and asserts that their destruction &quot;was neither inadvertent nor inevitable,&quot; but the result of microbial pestilence and purposeful genocide working in tandem. He also wrote:

In contrast, historian Russel Thornton has pointed out that there were disastrous epidemics and population losses during the first half of the sixteenth century &quot;resulting from incidental contact, or even without direct contact, as disease spread from one American Indian tribe to another.&quot; Thornton has also challenged higher Indigenous population estimates, which are based on the Malthusian assumption that &quot;populations tend to increase to, and beyond, the limits of the food available to them at any particular level of technology.&quot;

The European colonization of the Americas resulted in the deaths of so many people it contributed to climatic change and temporary global cooling, according to scientists from University College London. A century after the arrival of Christopher Columbus, some 90% of Indigenous Americans had perished from &quot;wave after wave of disease&quot;, along with mass slavery and war, in what researchers have described as the &quot;great dying&quot;. According to one of the researchers, UCL Geography Professor Mark Maslin, the large death toll also boosted the economies of Europe: &quot;the depopulation of the Americas may have inadvertently allowed the Europeans to dominate the world. It also allowed for the Industrial Revolution and for Europeans to continue that domination.&quot;

===Biological warfare===

When Old World diseases were first carried to the Americas at the end of the fifteenth century, they spread throughout the southern and northern hemispheres, leaving the Indigenous populations in near ruins. No evidence has been discovered that the earliest Spanish colonists and missionaries deliberately attempted to infect the American Natives, and some efforts were made to limit the devastating effects of disease before it killed off what remained of their labor force (compelled to work under the encomienda system). The cattle introduced by the Spanish contaminated various water reserves which Native Americans dug in the fields to accumulate rainwater. In response, the Franciscans and Dominicans created public fountains and aqueducts to guarantee access to drinking water. But when the Franciscans lost their privileges in 1572, many of these fountains were no longer guarded and so deliberate well poisoning may have happened. Although no proof of such poisoning has been found, some historians believe the decrease of the population correlates with the end of religious orders&#x27; control of the water.

In following centuries, accusations and discussions of biological warfare were common. Well-documented accounts of incidents involving both threats and acts of deliberate infection are very rare, but may have occurred more frequently than scholars have previously acknowledged. Many of the instances likely went unreported, and it is possible that documents relating to such acts were deliberately destroyed, or sanitized. By the middle of the 18th century, colonists had the knowledge and technology to attempt biological warfare with the smallpox virus. They well understood the concept of quarantine, and that contact with the sick could infect the healthy with smallpox, and those who survived the illness would not be infected again. Whether the threats were carried out, or how effective individual attempts were, is uncertain.

One such threat was delivered by fur trader James McDougall, who is quoted as saying to a gathering of local chiefs, &quot;You know the smallpox. Listen: I am the smallpox chief. In this bottle I have it confined. All I have to do is to pull the cork, send it forth among you, and you are dead men. But this is for my enemies and not my friends.&quot; Likewise, another fur trader threatened Pawnee Indians that if they didn&#x27;t agree to certain conditions, &quot;he would let the smallpox out of a bottle and destroy them.&quot; The Reverend Isaac McCoy was quoted in his &quot;History of Baptist Indian Missions&quot; as saying that the white men had deliberately spread smallpox among the Indians of the southwest, including the Pawnee tribe, and the havoc it made was reported to General Clark and the Secretary of War. Artist and writer George Catlin observed that Native Americans were also suspicious of vaccination, &quot;They see white men urging the operation so earnestly they decide that it must be some new mode or trick of the pale face by which they hope to gain some new advantage over them.&quot; So great was the distrust of the settlers that the Mandan chief Four Bears denounced the white man, whom he had previously treated as brothers, for deliberately bringing the disease to his people.

During the siege of British-held Fort Pitt in the Seven Years&#x27; War, Colonel Henry Bouquet ordered his men to take smallpox-infested blankets from their hospital and gave them as gifts to two neutral Lenape Indian dignitaries during a peace settlement negotiation, according to the entry in the Captain&#x27;s ledger, &quot;To convey the Smallpox to the Indians&quot;. In the following weeks, Sir Jeffrey Amherst conspired with Bouquet to &quot;Extirpate this Execreble Race&quot; of Native Americans, writing, &quot;Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.&quot; His Colonel agreed to try.

Most scholars have asserted that the 1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic was &quot;started among the tribes of the upper Missouri River by failure to quarantine steamboats on the river&quot;, and Captain Pratt of the &quot;St. Peter&quot; &quot;was guilty of contributing to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The law calls his offense criminal negligence. Yet in light of all the deaths, the almost complete annihilation of the Mandans, and the terrible suffering the region endured, the label criminal negligence is benign, hardly befitting an action that had such horrendous consequences.&quot; However, some sources attribute the 1836–40 epidemic to the deliberate communication of smallpox to Native Americans, with historian Ann F. Ramenofsky writing, &quot;&quot;Variola Major&quot; can be transmitted through contaminated articles such as clothing or blankets. In the nineteenth century, the U. S. Army sent contaminated blankets to Native Americans, especially Plains groups, to control the Indian problem.&quot; In Brazil, well into the 20th century, deliberate infection attacks continued as Brazilian settlers and miners transported infections intentionally to the Native groups whose lands they coveted.

===Vaccination===
After Edward Jenner&#x27;s 1796 demonstration that the smallpox vaccination worked, the technique became better known and smallpox became less deadly in the United States and elsewhere. Many colonists and Natives were vaccinated, although, in some cases, officials tried to vaccinate Natives only to discover that the disease was too widespread to stop. At other times, trade demands led to broken quarantines. In other cases, Natives refused vaccination because of suspicion of whites. The first international healthcare expedition in history was the Balmis Expedition which had the aim of vaccinating Indigenous peoples against smallpox all along the Spanish Empire in 1803. In 1831, government officials vaccinated the Yankton Dakota at Sioux Agency. The Santee Sioux refused vaccination and many died.

==Depopulation by European conquest==

===War and violence===

While epidemic disease was a leading factor of the population decline of the American Indigenous peoples after 1492, there were other contributing factors, all of them related to European contact and colonization. One of these factors was warfare. According to demographer Russell Thornton, although many people died in wars over the centuries, and war sometimes contributed to the near extinction of certain tribes, warfare and death by other violent means was a comparatively minor cause of overall Native population decline.

From the U.S. Bureau of the Census in 1894, wars between the government and the Indigenous peoples ranged over 40 in number over the previous 100 years. These wars cost the lives of approximately 19,000 white people, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians, including men, women, and children. They safely estimated that the number of Native people who were killed or wounded was actually around fifty percent more than what was recorded.

There is some disagreement among scholars about how widespread warfare was in pre-Columbian America, but there is general agreement that war became deadlier after the arrival of the Europeans and their firearms. The South or Central American infrastructure allowed for thousands of European conquistadors and tens of thousands of their Indian auxiliaries to attack the dominant Indigenous civilization. Empires such as the Incas depended on a highly centralized administration for the distribution of resources. Disruption caused by the war and the colonization hampered the traditional economy, and possibly led to shortages of food and materials. Across the western hemisphere, war with various Native American civilizations constituted alliances based out of both necessity or economic prosperity and, resulted in mass-scale intertribal warfare. European colonization in the North American continent also contributed to a number of wars between Native Americans, who fought over which of them should have first access to new technology and weaponry—like in the Beaver Wars.

===Genocides===

According to the Cambridge World History, the Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies, and the Cambridge World History of Genocide, colonial policies in some cases included the deliberate genocide of indigenous peoples in North America. According to the Cambridge World History of Genocide, Spanish colonization of the Americas also included genocidal massacres.

According to Adam Jones, genocidal methods included the following:
===Exploitation===
Some Spaniards objected to the encomienda system of labor, notably Bartolomé de las Casas, who insisted that the Indigenous people were humans with souls and rights. Because of many revolts and military encounters, Emperor Charles V helped relieve the strain on both the Native laborers and the Spanish vanguards probing the Caribana for military and diplomatic purposes. Later on New Laws were promulgated in Spain in 1542 to protect isolated Native, but the abuses in the Americas were never entirely or permanently abolished. The Spanish also employed the pre-Columbian draft system called the &quot;mita&quot;, and treated their subjects as something between slaves and serfs. Serfs stayed to work the land; slaves were exported to the mines, where large numbers of them died. In other areas the Spaniards replaced the ruling Aztecs and Incas and divided the conquered lands among themselves ruling as the new feudal lords with often, but unsuccessful lobbying to the viceroys of the Spanish crown to pay Tlaxcalan war demnities. The infamous Bandeirantes from São Paulo, adventurers mostly of mixed Portuguese and Native ancestry, penetrated steadily westward in their search for Indian slaves. Serfdom existed as such in parts of Latin America well into the 19th century, past independence. Historian Andrés Reséndez argues that even though the Spanish were aware of the spread of smallpox, they made no mention of it until 1519, a quarter century after Columbus arrived in Hispaniola. Instead he contends that enslavement in gold and silver mines was the primary reason why the Native American population of Hispaniola dropped so significantly. and that even though disease was a factor, the Native population would have rebounded the same way Europeans did following the Black Death if it were not for the constant enslavement they were subject to. He further contends that enslavement of Native Americans was in fact the primary cause of their depopulation in Spanish territories; that the majority of Indians enslaved were women and children compared to the enslavement of Africans which mostly targeted adult males and in turn they were sold at a 50% to 60% higher price, and that 2,462,000 to 4,985,000 Amerindians were enslaved between Columbus&#x27;s arrival and 1900.

===Massacres===


* The Pequot War in early New England.
* In mid-19th century Argentina, post-independence leaders Juan Manuel de Rosas and Julio Argentino Roca engaged in what they presented as a &quot;Conquest of the Desert&quot; against the Natives of the Argentinian interior, leaving over 1,300 Indigenous dead.
* While some California tribes were settled on reservations, others were hunted down and massacred by 19th century American settlers. It is estimated that at least 9,400 to 16,000 California Indians were killed by non-Indians, mostly occurring in more than 370 massacres (defined as the &quot;intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants, including women, children, and prisoners, whether in the context of a battle or otherwise&quot;).

===Displacement and disruption===

Throughout history, Indigenous people have been subjected to the repeated and forced removal from their land. Beginning in the 1830s, there was the relocation of an estimated 100,000 Indigenous people in the United States called the &quot;Trail of Tears&quot;. The tribes affected by this specific removal were the Five Civilized Tribes: The Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole. The treaty of New Echota, was enacted, which stated that the United States &quot;would give Cherokee land west of the Mississippi in exchange for $5,000,000&quot;. According to Jeffrey Ostler, &quot;Of the 80,000 Native people who were forced west from 1830 into the 1850s, between 12,000 and 17,000 perished.&quot; Ostler states that &quot;the large majority died of interrelated factors of starvation, exposure and disease&quot;.

In addition to the removal of the Southern Tribes, there were multiple other removals of Northern Tribes also known as &quot;Trails of Tears.&quot; For example, &quot;In the free labor states of the North, federal and state officials, supported by farmers, speculators and business interests, evicted Shawnees, Delawares, Senecas, Potawatomis, Miamis, Wyandots, Ho-Chunks, Ojibwes, Sauks and Meskwakis.&quot; These Nations were moved West of the Mississippi into what is now known as Eastern Kansas, and numbered 17,000 on arrival. According to Ostler, &quot;by 1860, their numbers had been cut in half&quot; because of low fertility, high infant mortality, and increased disease caused by conditions such as polluted drinking water, few resources, and social stress.

Ostler also writes that the areas that Northern tribes were removed to were already inhabited: &quot;The areas west of the Mississippi River were home to other Indigenous nations—Osages, Kanzas, Omahas, Ioways, Otoes and Missourias. To make room for thousands of people from the East, the government dispossessed these nations of much their lands.&quot; Ostler writes that when Northern Nations were moved onto their landing 1840, &quot;The combined population of these western nations was 9,000 ... 20 years later, it had fallen to 6,000.&quot;

===Later apologies by government officials===
On 8 September 2000, the head of the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) formally apologized for the agency&#x27;s participation in the ethnic cleansing of Western tribes.
In a speech before representatives of Native American peoples in June 2019, California governor Gavin Newsom apologized for the &quot;California Genocide.&quot; Newsom said, &quot;That&#x27;s what it was, a genocide. No other way to describe it. And that&#x27;s the way it needs to be described in the history books.&quot;

<text>Pop Tops (or Los Pop-Tops) were a vocal/instrumental band, formed in 1967 in Madrid, Spain, with Phil Trim from Trinidad and Tobago as lead singer. Their sound was a blend of baroque pop with the soulful vocals of Trim.

==Members==
Original set-up included
*Phil Trim (born January 5, 1940, in Trinidad and Tobago) – lead singer
*Julián Luis Angulo – guitar, vocals
*Alberto Vega – saxophone, clarinet, vocals
*Enrique Gómez – bass, trumpet
*Ignacio Pérez – organ, piano
*José Lipiani – drums
*Ray Gómez – guitar

Some changes occurred in members:

*Francisco Urbano Romero – drums 
*Rafael Guillermo Gertrudis – keyboards, piano 

==Hits==
Their first release to gain attention was &quot;Oh Lord, Why Lord&quot; (1968), written by Jean Marcel Bouchety and Phil Trim. It was the first pop song to incorporate the melody of Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon in D. That single&#x27;s b-side, &quot;The Voice of the Dying Man&quot; (based on a Johann Sebastian Bach composition) was also recorded in Spanish as &quot;La Voz del Hombre Caido&quot;.

They are best known for their 1971 hit &quot;Mamy Blue&quot;, referring to a son&#x27;s poignant song addressed to his departed mother about his childhood memories and life in general, sometimes spelled &quot;Mommy Blue&quot;, &quot;Mammy Blue&quot; or &quot;Mummy Blue&quot;, which was a Top 10 hit throughout much of Europe, Japan (#2), and Canada (#42), and a minor &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart hit in the United States (#57). It was covered in the US by the Stories peaking at No. 50 in 1973. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a platinum record.
The composer and lyricist of the French song &quot;Mamy Blue&quot; was Hubert Giraud. English lyrics were written by Phil Trim. The Pop Tops also recorded Italian and Spanish versions, with lyrics by Gefingal.

As follow-up singles they released &quot;Suzanne Suzanne&quot; (early 1972) and &quot;Hideaway&quot; (mid 1972), which were only minor hits in some European countries.

<text>OBERIU (Russian: ОБЭРИУ - Объединение реального искусства; English: the Union of Real Art or the Association for Real Art) was a short-lived avant-garde collective of Russian Futurist writers, musicians, and artists in the 1920s and 1930s. The group coalesced in the context of the &quot;intense centralization of Soviet Culture&quot; and the decline of the avant garde culture of Leningrad, as &quot;leftist&quot; groups were becoming increasingly marginalized.

Founded in 1927 by Daniil Kharms and Alexander Vvedensky, OBERIU became notorious for provocative performances which included circus-like stunts, readings of what was perceived as nonsensical verse, and theatrical presentations, such as Kharms&#x27;s &quot;Elizabeth Bam&quot;, that foreshadowed the European Theatre of the Absurd. The presentations took place in venues ranging from theaters and university auditoriums to dormitories and prisons. The group&#x27;s actions were derided as &quot;literary hooliganism&quot; in the ever-more conservative press of the late 1920s. It was chastised even more in the early 1930s, and many of its associates were arrested. The OBERIU has often been called &quot;the last Soviet avant-garde.&quot;

==Origins==
Some scholars say that the OBERIU manifesto was penned mostly by the poet Nikolay Zabolotsky with the help of Kharms. The core of the group included Daniil Kharms, Alexander Vvedensky, Nikolay Zabolotsky, Konstantin Vaginov, Igor Bekhterev (ru), Yury Vladimirov (ru), and others, including actors, musicians and filmmakers.

The Russian artist Kazimir Malevich gave the OBERIU shelter in his newly created arts institute, letting them rehearse in one of the auditoriums. It is reported that he said to the young &quot;Oberiuty&quot; (as they are called in Russian): &quot;You are young trouble makers, and I am an old one. Let&#x27;s see what we can do.&quot; Malevich also gifted a book of his own (&quot;God Is Not Cast Down&quot;) to founder Daniil Kharms with the relevant inscription &quot;Go and stop progress!&quot;

==Decline==
In the 1930s, Socialist Realism and Stalin&#x27;s purges precluded the formation of any such &quot;leftist&quot; or &quot;radical&quot; public artistic groupings. After about 1931, The OBERIU held no more public performances, and most of those involved showed their writing only to a small circle of friends, though Zabolotsky went on to become a marginally accepted Soviet poet.

Though the group was held together for a while by common interest, some split away. Zabolotsky seems to have had a falling out with Vvedensky. In the 1930s Kharms and Vvedensky became more closely involved with a group of friends who met semi-regularly for what they called &quot;conversations.&quot; Yakov Druskin, a Christian philosopher and music-theorist (he wrote on Bach, Schoenberg and Webern), was a key member of this group. Druskin and his friend Leonid Lipavsky (a children&#x27;s writer under the name of Leonid Savelyev, and an amateur mathematician and author of philosophical tracts) had known Alexander Vvedensky in high-school, and had become friends with Kharms and Zabolotsky as well. Lipavsky actually wrote down a number of the &quot;conversations.&quot; Nikolay Oleynikov, an editor at the children&#x27;s publishing house which had long employed the young poets of the OBERIU as writers and translators of children&#x27;s literature, became part of this group by the mid-thirties.

This later grouping, which had no public outlet, is generally called the &quot;chinari&quot; (i.e. &quot;the titled ones&quot;) group in Russian literary scholarship, though it is uncertain that they ever formalized a name for the group, nor that they called themselves &quot;chinari&quot; with any consistency. Thus, the names &quot;OBERIU&quot; and &quot;chinari&quot; are somewhat interchangeable in the scholarship. The borders between the two groups are (and were) permeable, and the only basic continuity is the presence of Kharms and Vvedensky.

==Influence==
Though short-lived, the OBERIU seems to have had lasting effects on Russian culture. Since the late 1980s a kind of cult fervor has grown in Russia around these long-forgotten writers. And, in fact, the ideas and art of the OBERIU had been influential even in the 1960s and 1970s, in what is called the &quot;unofficial&quot; art world of the Soviet Union. Some writers and artists of that period would proudly admit the influence of the OBERIU, in others it is clear enough. The OBERIU was seen as something of a missing link from the old Russian avant-garde to the new one. Poets like Genrikh Sapgir, Alexei Khvostenko, Anri Volokhonsky, Lev Rubinstein, Dmitri Prigov, Timur Kibirov, Eduard Limonov were certainly familiar with the OBERIU writers through &quot;samizdat&quot; publications circulating in the underground art scene, and their writing reflects that knowledge, though in very different ways for all of them. Leningrad avant garde musical group N.O.M. borrows heavily from OBERIU movement citing Kharms and Oleynikov as lyrical influences. They paid homage to Kharms, Oleynikov by releasing An Album Of Real Art with songs based on their lyrics. Novosibirsk punk rock musician Egor Letov cited Vvedensky as an influence for his lyrics.

==In English==

An anglophone edition of OBERIU writings translated by Eugene Ostashevsky, Matvei Yankelevich, Genya Turovskaya, Thomas Epstein and Ilya Bernstein was published by the Northwestern University Press in 2006. Several translations of Kharms&#x27;s short stories, notebooks, letters, poems and diaries have been published over the years, for instance by George Gibian (Norton Library, 1974), Matvei Yankelevich (Overlook Press, 2007), Anthony Anemone and Peter Scotto (Academic Studies Press, 2013) and most recently Alex Cigale (Northwestern University Press, 2017). Kharms&#x27;s poems were also translated by Roman Turovsky. Poems by Kharms (8), Vvedensky (1) and Zabolotsky (6) are included in The Penguin Book of Russian Poetry edited by Robert Chandler, Boris Dralyuk and Irina Mashinski published 2015.

<text>Luo Ronghuan (; November 26, 1902 – December 16, 1963) was a Marshal of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He served as a Vice Chair of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress.

==Biography==
Luo was born in a village in Hengshan County, Hunan Province. In 1919, at the age of 17, he enrolled in Xiejun Middle School in Changsha. Five years later, he began attending Shandong University (then Qingdao Private College), completing a preparatory course in Industry in Commerce in 1926. He joined the Chinese Communist Youth League in April 1927 and the Chinese Communist Party later that year. He was the only one of the later ten Marshals to have followed Mao in the Autumn Harvest Uprising. During the Long March he served as the security chief for the Chinese Red Army.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War he served as political commissar of the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army. The Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region anti-troskyites campaign extended to other base areas, including Shandong, leading to a frenzied campaign of mass execution of party cadres. This was put to a halt thanks to Luo&#x27;s intervention in November 1939. This incident reached Yan&#x27;an in early 1940, which lead to a reexamination of the anti-trotskyite campaign in Shandong on a meeting convened by Chen Yun. Here, the campaign was criticized as too extremist, although it was maintained that it was correct, which was not enough to stop the deadly campaign, despite Luo&#x27;s efforts, which saved more than 100 lives, the campaign did not fully end until April 1942, after an inspection by Liu Shaoqi.

After Zhu Rui dismissal as political commissar of the Eighth Route Army in Shandong in 1942, he held unified leadership over the government, Party and military in the Shandong area during the war against Japan. He chaired the General Study Committee, where he tried to oppose the Rectification Campaign excesses in Shandong. During his leadership of Shandong the communist forces and territory grew, at the time of China&#x27;s victory on the war against Japan the CCP controlled most of Shandong strongholds and communication lines, which were vital for communist victory during the Chinese civil war.

After World War II, Luo served as the political commissar of Lin Biao in Northeast China during the Chinese civil war.

After the formation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 he became Chief of Staff of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA). He was made a marshal in 1955.

Luo was the member of the 7th CPC Central Committee and 8th CPC Politburo. He died in 1963, and the funeral was attended by Mao and Lin Biao; the only other funeral attended by Lin Biao was for PLA Air Force General Liu Yalou.

<text>The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit American think tank based in Washington, D.C., that carries out economic research and analyzes the economic impact of policies and proposals. Affiliated with the labor movement, the EPI is usually described as presenting a left-leaning and pro-union viewpoint on public policy issues. Since 2021, EPI has been led by economist Heidi Shierholz, the former chief economist of the Department of Labor.

EPI has an advocacy arm, EPI Action, which is a 501(c)(4) group.

==History==
EPI was founded in 1986 by economists Jeff Faux, Lester Thurow, Ray Marshall, Barry Bluestone, Robert Reich, and Robert Kuttner. Since 2021, Heidi Shierholz has served as its president. Shierholz succeeded Thea Lee, who was named Deputy Undersecretary for International Affairs at the Department of Labor by President Joe Biden. 
==Policy proposals==
EPI supported Bernie Sanders&#x27;s Medicare for All proposal. In a March 2020 policy paper, it argued that the loss of jobs in the insurance industry and in administering the current system would be small, within the normal job churn, and easily absorbed by the economy. The paper argued that this cost would be outweighed by the benefits of universal health care and in small business formation. EPI has also released policy papers analyzing U.S. investment in early childhood education.

In July 2012, EPI and the AFL–CIO, Center for Community Change, Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, National Council of La Raza and SEIU proposed a budget plan titled &quot;Prosperity Economics&quot;, a counter to the Republican Party&#x27;s &quot;Path to Prosperity&quot; budget plan. The &quot;Prosperity Economics&quot; plan suggests that major public investment in areas like infrastructure is needed to jump-start the economy.

In response to the debate over the United States fiscal cliff, EPI economist Josh Bivens advocated raising tax rates for higher income earners, writing: &quot;Given this rise in [income] inequality, it makes sense that much of the future burden of reducing budget deficits should be borne by those who have benefited the most from economic trends in recent decades.&quot;

==Funding==
Eight labor unions made a five-year funding pledge to EPI at its inception: AFSCME, United Auto Workers, United Steelworkers, United Mine Workers, International Association of Machinists, Communications Workers of America, Service Employees International Union, and United Food and Commercial Workers Union. According to EPI, about 29% of its funding between 2005 and 2009 was supplied by labor unions and about 53% came from foundation grants.

In the 1980s, EPI took money from the Tobacco Institute, a now-defunct tobacco industry trade group, to oppose excise taxes on the tobacco industry&#x27;s behalf. The Tobacco Institute worked with groups like EPI &quot;to support the release of studies, editorials, press briefings, and testimony against regressive excise taxes&quot; that would negatively impact the tobacco industry&#x27;s bottom line if passed.

<text>Vicks is an American brand of over-the-counter medications owned by the American companies Procter &amp; Gamble and Kaz Incorporated. Vicks manufactures NyQuil and its sister medication, DayQuil as well as other medications in the &quot;Quil&quot; line. Vicks also produces the Formula 44 brand of cough medicines, cough drops, Vicks VapoRub, and a number of inhaled breathing treatments. For much of its history, Vicks products were manufactured by the family-owned company Richardson-Vicks, Inc., based in Greensboro, North Carolina. Richardson-Vicks, Inc., was eventually sold to Procter &amp; Gamble in 1985. Procter &amp; Gamble divested the Vicks VapoSteam U.S. liquid inhalant business and sold it to Helen of Troy in 2015.

In German-speaking countries (apart from Switzerland), Vicks is known as &quot;Wick&quot; to avoid brand blundering, as &quot;Vicks&quot; when pronounced in German would sound similar to a vulgar word.

==History ==

In 1890, pharmacist Lunsford Richardson of Selma, North Carolina, took over the retail drug business of his brother-in-law Dr. John Vick, of Greensboro, North Carolina. After Dr. John Vick saw an ad for &quot;Vick&#x27;s Seeds&quot;, Lunsford Richardson began marketing &quot;Vick’s Family Remedies&quot;. The basic ingredients of the range included castor oil, liniment, and &#x27;dead shot&#x27; vermifuge. The most popular remedy was &quot;Croup and Pneumonia Salve&quot;, which was first compounded in 1891, in Greensboro. It was introduced in 1905 with the name Vick&#x27;s Magic Croup Salve and rebranded as VapoRub in 1912 at the instigation of H. Smith Richardson, Lunsford&#x27;s oldest son; Smith had gained valuable sales and marketing experience while working for a period in New York and Massachusetts after attending college. Smith Richardson assumed the presidency of the company in 1919 upon his father&#x27;s death.

Lunsford Richardson sent out millions of samples of Vicks VapoRub, &quot;inadvertently&quot; inventing the concept of junk mail, say North Carolina state historians. The flu epidemic of 1918 increased sales of VapoRub from $900,000 to $2.9 million in just one year. In 1931, the company began selling cough drops. In 1948, Edward Mabry became president of Vicks, then known as the Vick Chemical Company. In 1952, Vicks began selling cough syrup, and in 1959 they introduced Sinex Nasal Spray. The company began selling NyQuil in 1966. The parent company became Richardson-Merrell and then in 1982 divided into prescription drug company Merrell Dow (sold to Dow Chemical Company) and over-the-counter drug company Richardson-Vicks which retained the Vicks brand.

The company archives (including related personal records of the Richardson family) from at least about 1920 or so, up to the 1985 sale to Procter &amp; Gamble, are housed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In March 2015, Procter &amp; Gamble sold the Vicks VapoSteam U.S. liquid inhalant business to Helen of Troy Ltd.

<text>Mission Valley is a wide river valley trending east–west in San Diego, California, United States, through which the San Diego River flows to the Pacific Ocean. For planning purposes the City of San Diego divides it into two neighborhoods: Mission Valley East and Mission Valley West.

Mission Valley was the site of the first Spanish settlement in California, established in 1769. The area currently serves as an important shopping and entertainment center for San Diego. Several condominiums and apartments can also be found in the area.

==History==
The San Diego River valley was originally called Emat Kuseyaay, which was then named by the Spanish as La Cañada de San Diego. Cañada in Spanish means gully, ravine, or glen. The name was changed to Mission Valley in the 1860s in reference to Mission San Diego de Alcalá.

The Mission Valley area was inhabited by Kumeyaay Indians for more than 10,000 years, which was home to many Kumeyaay villages such as the villages of Nipaquay (&quot;Nipawai&quot;), Haiir, and Cosoy (&quot;Kosa&#x27;aay&quot;).

The first Spanish settlement in present-day California was the Presidio of San Diego and Mission San Diego de Alcalá, both established in 1769 next to the village of Cosoy. The Presidio and Mission were located at the western end of Mission Valley, which is now present-day Old Town, where the valley opens out into the flood plain of the San Diego River. In 1774, the Mission was moved to its present location at the eastern end of Mission Valley because of better access to freshwater for drinking and farming.

Until the 1940s, Mission Valley remained largely undeveloped, featuring dairy farms and other agricultural activities; the city of San Diego was largely confined to areas south of the valley. After World War II, the city&#x27;s expansion began to encroach on the valley. The last of the valley&#x27;s dairy farms closed in the early 1960s.

Another early activity in Mission Valley was quarrying sand and gravel from its walls. A large quarry on the north side of the valley was in operation for most of the 20th century. The quarry ceased operation around 2000 and is now the site of the Civita mixed-use development.

The development of Mission Valley began in 1953 when the first hotel was built in what is now Hotel Circle. In 1958, the city council rezoned of the river valley to allow the construction of San Diego&#x27;s first regional shopping center. The Mission Valley Center (now Westfield Mission Valley) opened in 1961 and was followed by several other large regional shopping malls.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the U.S. 80 freeway (now Interstate 8) was constructed through Mission Valley, further opening the area up for development.

Westgate Park, a baseball stadium for the then-minor-league San Diego Padres, was built in Mission Valley in 1957. In 1967, San Diego Stadium (later renamed Jack Murphy Stadium, then Qualcomm Stadium, then SDCCU Stadium) was opened and the Padres moved there, becoming a major league team the following year. Westgate Park was razed in 1969 and was replaced by the Fashion Valley Mall. San Diego Stadium was demolished in 2021 and was replaced by Snapdragon Stadium in 2022.

==Boundaries==
Mission Valley stretches as far west as Interstate 5 and as far east as Interstate 15. The exact boundary between Mission Valley East and West is State Route 163.

==Government==
Mission Valley is located in City Council District 7 and is currently represented by Councilmember Raul Campillo. For federal representation, it is divided between California&#x27;s 52nd congressional district, represented by Scott Peters, and California&#x27;s 53rd congressional district, represented by Sara Jacobs.

==Transportation==
Mission Valley serves as a path for Interstate 8 and is crossed at its mouth by Interstate 5. Both I-8 and I-5 serve as the major east-west and north-south routes respectively, for San Diego. At the Jack Schrade Interchange, Interstate 805 crosses Mission Valley and connects with Interstate 8. Interstate 15 and State Route 163 also cross Mission Valley and connect with Interstate 8.

The Green Line of the San Diego Trolley system also runs through Mission Valley. The main hub for buses is located at the Fashion Valley Transit Center and Mall. Other trolley stations in the valley are found at Morena/Linda Vista, Hazard Center, Mission Valley Center, Rio Vista, Fenton Parkway, and Stadium.

==Attractions==

Toward the eastern end of Mission Valley lies Mission San Diego de Alcalá, for which the valley is named. At the southwestern end overlooking the valley is Presidio Park. At the foot of Presidio Hill lies Old Town San Diego State Historic Park, the original site of the town of San Diego. All three attractions are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Three major shopping malls located in Mission Valley are Fashion Valley Mall, Hazard Center Mall, and Westfield Mission Valley. Many other commercial developments can be found in the region as well, including smaller shopping plazas, auto malls, and vocational schools. The frontage roads parallel to Interstate 8 west of Highway 163 are named Hotel Circle North and Hotel Circle South, for the many hotels and motels located on them. The frontage roads east of Highway 163 are called Camino del Rio North and Camino del Rio South.

Recently-built Snapdragon Stadium is in Mission Valley East near the I-8/I-15 interchange. At the outlet of Mission Valley lie SeaWorld, Mission Bay, and other San Diego attractions.

<doc id="1239926" wikidata="Q542101" url="?curid=1239926" title="Boris Grebenshchikov">
<text>Boris Borisovich Grebenshchikov (; born ) is a prominent member of the generation which is widely considered to be the &quot;founding fathers&quot; of Russian rock music. He is the founder and lead singer of the band Aquarium which has been active since 1972. Grebenshchikov is frequently referred to as BG (; pronounced &quot;Beh-Geh&quot;), after his initials.

==Early years (1953–1979)==
Grebenshchikov was born on 27 November 1953, in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg. In 1972, he founded the band Aquarium with his childhood friend Anatoly &quot;George&quot; Gunitsky as a postmodern theatrical endeavor that included poetry and music.

Grebenshchikov was accepted into Leningrad State University. Due to his musical activities, he started missing exams and failing classes. Grebenshchikov eventually received a graduate degree in applied mathematics. Inspiration from The Beatles and Bob Dylan transformed Aquarium into a low-fi electric blues band that moonlighted in acoustic reggae.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union regime routinely suppressed experiments in non-standardized self-expression as a matter of policy, so decent recording facilities were out of reach. The several two-track recordings hacked out over those years, such as &quot;Temptation of St. Aquarium&quot; (&quot;Iskushenie Svyatogo Akvariuma&quot;), &quot;Count Diffusor&#x27;s Fables&quot; (&quot;Pritchi grafa Diffuzora&quot;), &quot;Menuet for a Farmer&quot; (&quot;Menuet zemledel&#x27;tzu&quot;), and a motley bag of &quot;singles&quot; were of unprofessional quality but showcased his interest in Oriental thought and mysticism that eventually became his trademarks.

In 1976, Grebenshchikov also recorded of his first solo album &quot;S toy storony zerkal&#x27;nogo stekla&quot; (&quot;Beyond the Mirror Glass&quot;) and a double album with Mike Naumenko titled &quot;All Brothers-Sisters&quot; (&quot;Vse brat&#x27;ya - sestry)&quot;.

==Classical years (1980–1988)==
In 1980, Artemy Troitsky, the first public Russian rock critic, invited Aquarium to perform at the Tbilisi Rock Festival.

The festival was a state-sanctioned attempt to control the Russian rock music movement, but the group&#x27;s performance caused a near riot and was wildly out of line with the Soviet officials’ expectations. A covert KGB-bound report caused Grebenshchikov to lose his day job and membership in Komsomol.

As Western rock music was still officially banned at the time, Aquarium started giving unsanctioned underground concerts at their friends’ apartments, while their music was reaching wider audience among the Soviet youth through bootlegged cassette tapes. During this time, all music had to be vetted by Soviet censors, and only officially sanctioned bands were allowed to perform in public or record in professional recording studios.

The first Aquarium music available in the West was in 1986 when a double album entitled &quot;RED WAVE, 4 UNDERGROUND BANDS FROM THE USSR&quot; appeared in record stores in the U.S. Besides Aquarium, Kino, Strange Games, and Alisa were recorded on a four-track machine, smuggled out of the country, and released by a small record label from Hollywood.

By the time Aquarium disbanded amid internal discord in 1991, they had 11 official records under their belt.

==Going West (1988–1990)==
Perestroika had ushered in a new era of opportunity for rock musicians. In 1989, Grebenshchikov released &quot;Radio Silence&quot;, produced by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics fame. &quot;Radio Silence&quot; featured covers of Alexander Vertinsky&#x27;s &quot;China&quot; amid songs by Grebenshchikov, including a song written to Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Death of King Arthur&quot;. Annie Lennox, Billy MacKenzie, and Chrissie Hynde helped out, as did several of Grebenshchikov&#x27;s bandmates from Aquarium. The single &quot;Radio Silence&quot; was his biggest hit outside of Russia, reaching number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Modern Rock Chart in the United States in August 1989.

He issued another English-language album, &quot;Radio London&quot;, in 1996, which consisted of demos made in 1990 and 1991.

==Returning East (1991–1996)==
Grebenshchikov returned to Russia and came out with a &quot;Russian album&quot; (&quot;Russkiy al&#x27;bom&quot;), backed by the eponymous BG Band, in 1992.

The Aquarium album &quot;Favorite songs of Ramses the 4th&quot; (&quot;Lyubimye pesni Ramzesa IV&quot;) was mostly filler, and &quot;Archive vol 4&quot; was all outtakes. The band&#x27;s next three albums are effectively Grebenshchikov&#x27;s solo albums published under the band&#x27;s brand. &quot;Navigator&quot;, &quot;Snow lion&quot; (&quot;Snezhniy lev&quot;), and &quot;Hyperborea&quot; have a stylized Russian feel.

==Back to basics (1997–2019)==
His 1997 album &quot;Lilith&quot; is still mostly Russian in lyrical theme but is recorded by way of a chance meeting with his idol Dylan&#x27;s former backing group, The Band.

His 1999 album &quot;Psi&quot; features an interpretation through a post-modernistic lens with use of keyboard samplers. His 2002 album &quot;Sister Chaos&quot; (&quot;Sestra Haos&quot;), 2003 album &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s songs&quot; (&quot;Pesni rybaka&quot;), and 2005 album &quot;ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM&quot; had Armenian, Indian, and African influences respectively, particularly from Jivan Gasparyan.

In 2014 he released &quot;Salt&quot;, &quot;one of the best albums of Grebenshchikov’s long career, an astonishing, visceral piece of work that more than lives up to its moniker: earthy, vital, biting, life-enhancing&quot;.

==Radio &quot;Aerostat&quot;==
Since 2005, Grebenshchikov has had a weekly radio program on Russian radio station Radio Rossii titled &quot;Aerostat&quot; (Russian: &quot;Аэростат&quot;). It is presented as &quot;author&#x27;s program of Boris Grebenshchikov&quot; and he is the creator and speaker. &quot;Aerostrat&quot; is about alternatives in music and the music not played on today&#x27;s radio despite its artistic value and originality. Grebenshchikov states that it is mostly independent music which would &quot;otherwise would not be played at all.&quot; Songs played on &quot;Aerostat&quot; vary from 1960s and 1970s rock (e.g., The Beatles, Bob Dylan) to reggae, new wave, alternative rock, electronica, punk, world music, jazz, classical, and avant-garde. As of April 2019, more than 700 shows have been created and broadcast, each approximately 46 minutes long. The track lists and the scripts of all programs are available at official site of Aquarium and Grebenshchikov.

==Religion and mysticism==
Grebenshchikov is known as a student of religion and mysticism. He has translated several Hindu and Buddhist scriptures into Russian, travelled the Orient widely, and made friends with various spiritual celebrities.

Grebenshchikov&#x27;s published translations of Buddhist and Hindu texts:

* Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche (son of Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche) &quot;Bardo Guidebook&quot; – &quot;source material for the &quot;Tibetan Book of Living &amp; Dying&quot; also known as &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot; Bardo Thodol&quot;, in 1995.
* Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche &quot;Repeating Words of the Buddha&quot; – &quot;the essential points of spiritual practice, inseparable from everyday life&quot;, in 1997.
* Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche &quot;Rainbow Painting&quot; – &quot;addressing the topics of practices of accumulating and purifying to facilitate unification of view and conduct&quot;, in 1999.
* Shibendu Lahiri &quot;Kriya yoga&quot; – &quot;authentic teachings and techniques of Kriya Yoga&quot;, in 2003.
* &quot;The Katha Upanishad&quot;, Upanishad belonging to the Yajur Veda, in 2005.

==Opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine==
On 5 October 2022, Grebenshchikov appeared on BBC Hardtalk talking about his opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, his self-imposed exile to London, and his involvement with Dave Stewart to produce an antiwar record.

In June 2023, a Moscow court ordered Grebenshchikov to pay 50,000 rubles in fines for alleged &quot;discreditation of the Russian armed forces&quot;, related to an interview Grebenshchikov gave on the Israeli television station Channel 9. Grebenshchikov was later declared a foreign agent by the Russian Ministry of Justice.

==Production==
Over the years of his career, Grebenshchikov has written more than 500 songs. Additionally, he has recorded cover albums on material from Alexander Vertinsky (&quot;Songs of A.Vertinsky&quot; (&quot;Pesni A.Vertinskogo&quot;)) in 1994 and Bulat Okudzhava&#x27;s (&quot;Songs of B.Okudzhava&quot; (&quot;Pesni B.Okudzhavy&quot;)) in 1999, two albums of mantra music with Gabrielle Roth and the Mirrors, (&quot;Refuge&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Bardo&quot; in 2002), and an album of electronica versions of Aquarium songs from late 1970s – early 1980s with the Russian duo Deadushki.

<doc id="1239931" wikidata="Q119590" url="?curid=1239931" title="Aquarium (band)">
<text>Aquarium or Akvarium (; often stylized as Åквариум) is a Russian rock group formed in Leningrad in 1972. The band is considered one of the founders of Russian rock. Aquarium has had many line-up changes over its history, and lead singer and founder Boris Grebenshchikov is the only remaining original member. Former band members include Anatoly Gunitsky, Mikhail Feinstein, Andrei &quot;Dyusha&quot; Romanov, Vsevolod Gakkel, and Sergey Kuryokhin.

==Formation, first lineup (1972–1991)==
Aquarium was formed in 1972 by two friends: Boris Grebenshchikov, then a student of applied mathematics at Leningrad State University, and Anatoly (George) Gunitsky, a playwright and absurdist poet. The founding members were Grebenshchikov, George (drums), Alexander Tsatsanidi (bass), Vadim Vasilyev (keyboards), Valery Obogrelov (sound).

The popular story behind the name &quot;Aquarium&quot; is that it was inspired by the Budapest street Leningrad pub &quot;The Aquarium&quot; and suggested by one of the band members. However, Grebenshchikov has given differing stories in interviews, suggesting alternately that it came through band word association sessions or was inspired by a glass aquarium-like building.

In late 1973, guitarist Edmund Shkliarsky (later the leader of Piknik) was briefly a member of the band. Bass player Michael Feinstein-Vasiliev (Fan), the first professional musician in Aquarium, joined in 1973. The next year keyboardist Andrew &quot;Dyusha&quot; Romanov joined the band, and, inspired by rock-flautists Richard Meier and Ian Anderson, retrained as a flautist.

===Early concerts===
Their first performance took place in March 1973 at their rehearsal base, a small country venue, while others place it at the Leningrad restaurant &quot;Hold&quot; at Central Park of Culture and Recreation, for which they were paid 50 rubles in cash.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, rock and roll was strictly regulated in the Soviet Union, and only a few artists managed to be approved and signed by the government record label Melodiya. Aquarium&#x27;s usual concert venues were private apartments and they faced many years of fierce competition to land a spot on the label. These &quot;apartment concerts&quot; (&quot;квартирники&quot;) were a unique Soviet phenomenon created by underground musicians. They were usually acoustic, as noise could cause the neighbors to call the Militsiya, but the limited space fostered an atmosphere of intimacy between the group and its audience, who listened with bated breath, perhaps with someone recording the concert on a simple tape recorder. This was similar to the concept of the Russian bards.

In 1973, Aquarium performed their first live concert, but did not follow it up with regular concerts.

===Home recording albums===
While on vacation in January–February 1974, Grebenshchikov and George recorded their debut album &quot;The Temptation of St. Aquarium&quot;/&quot;Iskushenie Svyatogo Akvariuma&quot; (Russian: &quot;Искушение святого Аквариума&quot;). The band recorded the album with home recording equipment, with variable sound quality results. &quot;The Temptation of St. Aquarium&quot; was long thought lost, but in 1997 the record was found and released in 2001 on CD in the book &quot;Prehistoric Aquarium&quot;. All masters of this record appear to have been lost. Their second album was called &quot;Parables of Count Diffusor&quot; and was written by Grebenshchikov, George Fan and Dyusha Romanov, probably in the spring of 1975. They followed this up in 1976 with their third album, &quot;S Toy Storony Zerkalnogo Stekla&quot;, or &quot;From the Other Side of a Mirror Glass&quot; (Russian: &quot;С той стороны зеркального стекла&quot;), named using a line from an Arseny Tarkovsky poem.

===Theatre and regular performances===
In 1974 the group became heavily involved in amateur theatre, playing pieces of absurdity on the steps of the Engineers&#x27; Castle. However, when the theater was headed by professional director Eric Goroshevsky, Grebenshchikov became disillusioned with the idea of a fusion of rock, poetry and theatre, and shifted Aquarium&#x27;s focus to concentrate on musical activities (though they only made a complete break from the theatre group in 1977). George left the band, but kept in touch with its members. The following year, cellist Vsevolod (Seva) Gakkel joined the band .

Aquarium began to regularly perform live in 1976. Their first concert was on February 25, 1976, jointly with Grebenshchikov, Gakkel and Dyusha Romanov. On March 10 Aquarium was a surprise guest at the Tallinn Festival of Popular Music, where they played a set of four acoustic songs and won the prize for the most interesting and varied program.

In 1977 Romanov and bassoon player Alexander &quot;Fagot&quot; Alexandrov (&quot;fagot&quot; [&quot;фагот&quot;] meaning bassoon in Russian) were drafted in the military for two years. With the loss of these members, Grebenshchikov recorded a highly successful solo album &quot;All Brothers are Sisters&quot; (Vse brat&#x27;ya - sestry). Aquarium also became popular to the point that Grebenshchikov was recognised in the street.
In 1979 the band met with two important figures of Soviet rock, critic Artemy Troitsky and next year start to work with Andrei Tropillo as a manager in whose studio Aquarium recorded its first &#x27;historic&#x27; albums.

===Tbilisi Rock Festival===
Aquarium burst into the consciousness of the Soviet rock scene by competing at the 1980 Tbilisi Rock Festival. The band caused a scandal with their performance, which was considered bizarre and shocking. During the set, Grebenshchikov lay down on the stage and made provocative movements while playing the guitar, causing all the jury members to demonstratively leave the hall. Aquarium was accused of promoting homosexuality (the guitar actions), incest (Grebenshchikov changed words while singing the song &quot;Marina&quot;, though this may have been through poor technique) and indecency, and banned from the festival. The incident became known in Leningrad, and as a result Grebenshchikov lost his job and was expelled from the Komsomol (Young Communist&#x27;s League, expected of working Russians). However, while they did not receive any prizes, the band&#x27;s performance made them become a symbol of the Soviet alternative culture.

Until 1987, Aquarium recorded all of their albums in live concerts and in a self-assembled underground studio (several members had engineering education) disguised as a &quot;Young Technicians Club&quot;. A notable exception was the album &quot;Radio Africa&quot; (1983), which was secretly recorded using a government-owned mobile studio, after bribing a technician.

===Mainstream success===
The advent of Glasnost in the second half of the 1980s brought many underground Russian rock musicians to public recognition and Aquarium became one of the most popular acts. They were allowed to play in large concert halls, appeared on state-owned television and recorded soundtracks for several films, most notably &quot;Assa&quot;. In 1987 they recorded their first album for the state-owned Melodiya record label. With official backing and legalized distribution the album was a huge hit in the Soviet Union, selling well over a million copies within a few months. Grebenshchikov subsequently recorded two albums in English and toured with several different backing bands. In 1992, after the break-up of the Soviet Union, he released music under the name The BG-Band, &quot;The Russian Album&quot;, a collection of melancholic folk songs influenced by his travels all over Russia and demonstrating a return to his Russian roots.

==Second lineup (1992–present)==
Grebenshchikov kept touring and shortly returned to calling his band &quot;Aquarium&quot;, although the lineup bore little resemblance to the original band. In 1996, Aquarium co-headlined (along with DDT) the VladiROCKstok music festival in Vladivostok; at one memorable point, Grebenshchikov famously invited thousands of fans to stream out of their grandstand seats and into the area near the performance stage.

The band continued to release more albums and tour extensively over the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and places with Russian-speaking immigrant communities in Germany, Israel and the United States. In 2007, Aquarium performed for the first time at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In 2008 the &quot;Aquarium International&quot; project (with participation of over 20 musicians worldwide) was created.

Their 2008 album &quot;Loshad&#x27; Belaya&quot; (&quot;White Horse&quot;) was released in a similar fashion to Radiohead&#x27;s 2007 &quot;In Rainbows&quot;: it was offered for free download in mp3 format with the downloader opting to pay the amount they saw fit.

Although often criticized for departure from their original style and constant line-up changes, which made the later incarnations of Aquarium essentially a Grebenshchikov solo project, the group still enjoyed considerable success in Russia with regular radio airplay of their old and new songs, popular albums, and frequent tours.

Aquarium&#x27;s lineup in 2017 consisted of Boris Grebenshchikov, Andrey Surotdinov (violin), Alexey Zubarev (guitars), Alexander Titov (bass), Liam Bradley (drums) and Brian Finnegan (flute).

==Musical influences==
Aquarium were strongly influenced by Western rock music, particularly by The Beatles, Bob Dylan, David Bowie, T. Rex, and progressive rock acts like Jethro Tull, King Crimson and Roxy Music as well as by new wave and reggae artists. This was reflected in the band&#x27;s often complex compositions and wide-ranging lyric themes, even including references to Celtic and Indian cultures.

<doc id="1239933" wikidata="Q952480" url="?curid=1239933" title="Maneuverable reentry vehicle">
<text>The maneuverable reentry vehicle (abbreviated MARV or MaRV) is a type of warhead for ballistic missiles that is capable of maneuvering and changing its trajectory.

There are two general reasons to use MARV. One is to make it more difficult to track the re-entry vehicle (RV) and thereby make it more difficult to attack as it approaches its target. This was particularly useful against early anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems which took seconds to calculate an interception course. Making random trajectory changes could render these systems useless. This class of MARV is sometimes known as evading MaRVs.

The other is to improve accuracy or track moving targets using terminal guidance systems that can act only during the last stages of the flight. This class is sometimes known as accuracy MaRVs. In this case, it is the short range of the active guidance system that demands the RV be able to maneuver, as is the base in the Pershing II active radar homing system. The same systems may also be used to track moving targets like aircraft carriers, which move far enough between launch and approach that there is no way to predict their location and active terminal guidance must be used.

The development of the Soviet A-35 anti-ballistic missile system (ABM) system led to work in the United States to consider ways to defeat it. The tri-service Advanced Strategic Missile Systems office was formed to study the problem, and several possibilities were immediately evident.

One was to use skip-glide reentry to extend the range of the reentry vehicle (RV) while flying at lower altitude, which would make it much more difficult to track at the long distances needed for a successful interception. A similar approach was to use air-launched ballistic missiles, which flew much shorter distances and much lower altitudes. Another was to add various decoys and radar countermeasures to make the ABM systems fail to track the RV among the decoys, or in a similar way, to use MIRV systems to increase the number of targets beyond what the ABM system might handle.

Maneuvering RVs are another solution to the problem. The radars, and especially computers, of the era took many seconds to calculate the trajectory of the descending RV, the trajectory of the ascending ABM, the chosen collision point, and to send that information to the ABM to adjust its flight path. If the RV maneuvered continually during the time it was within range of the ABM, the guidance system would never calculate a successful interception course. The only solution would be to launch multiple ABMs in a pattern that covered all of the possible approaches to the target, which could require dozens of ABMs per attacking RV.

Work on MARV was carried out continually through the 1960s, but ultimately not put into use on the US ICBM fleet as the signing of the ABM Treaty mooted the need for anything more advanced than MIRV and decoys.

===Mk. 500===
Interest in evading MARV grew in the late 1970s as part of the wider debate on nuclear warfighting policy. This led the US Navy to develop a simple MARV for their Trident I SLBM, the Mk. 500, or &quot;Evader&quot;. This was a simple modification to the existing RV, which &quot;bent&quot; the nose of the RV slightly to the side. This created aerodynamic lift in a single direction, but the RV&#x27;s overall direction could be controlled by rolling the RV around its long axis. During the terminal approach, the Mk. 500 would continually roll in different directions to create a random path.

Mk. 500 was designed to be simple, and had a number of known problems. One was that it could not fly a straight path and that meant it had to calculate an approach where all of its maneuvers brought it to its target. Another was that the maneuvers were constant gee, so as it approached the target the area in which it might move continually shrunk. Finally, as it was constantly generating lift, it was slowing more rapidly than a non-maneuvering RV. This not only reduced the amount of lift it generated as it slowed, it also greatly reduced its terminal speed, both of which opened it to attack by very fast interceptors attacking at very short range.
===Sandia Winged Energetic Reentry Vehicle Experiment (SWERVE)===
SWERVE started in the 1970s and culminated with a successful flight test in 1985, which demonstrated a sophisticated maneuvering reentry vehicle technology and paved the way for the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon program&#x27;s Alternate Re-Entry System in the early 2010s, which was later developed into the Common-Hypersonic Glide Body hypersonic glide vehicle.

===Advanced Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle===
The Advanced Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle (AMaRV) was a prototype MARV built by McDonnell Douglas. Four AMaRVs were made and represented a significant leap in reentry vehicle sophistication. Three of the AMaRVs were launched by Minuteman-1 ICBMs on 20 December 1979, 8 October 1980 and 4 October 1981. AMaRV had an entry mass of approximately 470 kg, a nose radius of 2.34 cm, a forward frustum half-angle of 10.4°, an inter-frustum radius of 14.6 cm, aft frustum half angle of 6°, and an axial length of 2.079 meters.

The design was essentially a conical RV with a slice cut off one side to form a flat surface. A small triangular prism was placed at the aft end of this flat area. The prism was split into two halves, left and right, to form two flaps, sometimes referred to as a &quot;split-windward flap&quot;. To pitch the vehicle, the flaps were both raised into the airstream and caused the nose to move in the opposite direction and thereby produce lift opposite to the direction of flap movement. The RV was rotated by raising one flap while lowering the other.

AMaRV had numerous advantages over Mk. 500. It did not have to maneuver at all times, and had fine control over the maneuvers it performed. As it could avoid maneuvers during the initial reentry, it would retain energy and thus be able to maintain powerful maneuvers at lower altitudes, while also travelling faster overall. It was &quot;difficult to conceive of an endoatmospheric ABM which could defend against AMaRV-type vehicles at reasonable cost.&quot;

The disadvantage of AMaRV was that it was very heavy, too heavy to be carried on Trident I. While it could be carried on Minuteman and MX, doing so would limit the number of RVs carried, which might result in fewer RVs reaching their targets even if they did evade ABMs that non-maneuvering RVs did not.

<doc id="1239939" wikidata="Q7544960" url="?curid=1239939" title="Smith &amp; Smith">
<text>Smith &amp; Smith is a Canadian sketch comedy series, which aired from 1979 to 1986 on Hamilton, Ontario&#x27;s CHCH-TV, and through syndication on other Canadian television stations. The show starred the husband and wife comedy duo of Steve Smith and Morag Smith.

Recurring sketches included a judge, played by Morag, while Steve&#x27;s characters included William Shakespeare and a preacher. Sketches also included &quot;The Kids&#x27; Show&quot;, a &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; parody in which the hosts constantly bickered and insulted each other, and a sketch set in a bakery, in which Morag played the male front counter attendant and Steve played the female baker. Each show also included a humorous musical number, performed in costume, focusing on a famous couple in history, as well as a mailbag segment.

The show took a one-year hiatus in 1985, during which the Smiths and their children Max and David starred in the family sitcom &quot;Me &amp; Max&quot;. After that show ended its run, Steve and Morag revived &quot;Smith &amp; Smith&quot; under the new title &quot;The Comedy Mill&quot;, adding several supporting cast members to the new show. In 1991, Morag retired from performing and Steve launched his most famous series, &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;. Red Green was originally created as a recurring character on &quot;Smith &amp; Smith&quot;.

&quot;Smith &amp; Smith&quot; has aired in reruns on TV Land Canada.

Band members during the &quot;Smith &amp; Smith&quot; series included Paul Benton (piano), Bob Doidge (bass), Bob McLaren (drums), Bernie LaBarge (guitar), Leo Sullivan (sax), and Steve McDade (trumpet). The music tracks were recorded at Grant Ave. Studio in Hamilton, Ontario.

<doc id="1239940" wikidata="Q7307611" url="?curid=1239940" title="REFSMMAT">
<text>REFSMMAT is a term used by guidance, navigation, and control system flight controllers during the Apollo program, which carried over into the Space Shuttle program. REFSMMAT stands for &quot;Reference to Stable Member Matrix&quot;. It is a numerical definition of a fixed orientation in space and is usually (but not always) defined with respect to the stars. It was used by the Apollo Primary Guidance, Navigation and Control System (PGNCS) as a reference to which the gimbal-mounted platform at its core should be oriented. Every operation within the spacecraft that required knowledge of direction was carried out with respect to the orientation of the guidance platform, itself aligned according to a particular REFSMMAT.

During an Apollo flight, the REFSMMAT being used, and therefore the orientation of the guidance platform, would change as operational needs required it, but never during a guidance process—that is, one REFSMMAT might be in use from launch through Trans-Lunar Injection, another from TLI to Midpoint, but would not change during the middle of a burn or set of maneuvers.

One consideration in choosing each respective REFSMMAT was to avoid taking the spacecraft near the gimbal lock zone of its Inertial Measurement Unit during any expected spacecraft maneuvers, since the exact orientation of the &quot;forbidden&quot; range of spacecraft attitudes would depend on the current REFSMMAT.

Additionally, it was considered good practice to have the spacecraft displays show some meaningful attitude value that would be easy to monitor during an important engine burn. Flight controllers at mission control in Houston would calculate what attitude the spacecraft had to be at for that burn and would devise a REFSMMAT that matched it in some way. Then, when it came time for the burn, if the spacecraft was in its correct attitude, the crew would see their 8-ball display a simple attitude that would be easy to interpret, allowing errors to be easily tracked and corrected.

In the hallowed halls of mission control, Captain Refsmmat was a Kilroy-type character, conceived as a joke spoken to a &#x27;Flight Dynamics Branch&#x27; rookie by Flight Controller RETRO John Llewellyn, and first drawn by flight controller FIDO Edward Louis Pavelka Jr. as the &quot;ideal mission controller&quot;. &#x27;Capt. Refsmmat&#x27; served during the Apollo and Skylab years as an aid to the esprit de corps within the mission control team.

<doc id="1239941" wikidata="Q4691918" url="?curid=1239941" title="Age of candidacy">
<text>Age of candidacy is the minimum age at which a person can legally hold certain elected government offices. In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be eligible to stand for an election or be granted ballot access.

The first known example of a law enforcing age of candidacy was the &quot;Lex Villia Annalis&quot;, a Roman law enacted in 180 BCE which set the minimum ages for senatorial magistrates.

==International standards==
International electoral standards which are defined in the International Public Human Rights Law, allow restricting candidacy on the basis of age. The interpretation of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights offered by the United Nations Human Rights Committee in the General Comment 25 states &quot;Any conditions which apply to the exercise of the rights protected by article 25 (of the ICCPR) should be based on objective and reasonable criteria. For example, it may be reasonable to require a higher age for election or appointment to particular offices than for exercising the right to vote, which should be available to every adult citizen.&quot;

==In various countries==

===Australia===
In Australia a person must be aged 18 or over to stand for election to public office at federal, state or local government level. Prior to 1973, the age of candidacy for the federal parliament was 21.

The youngest ever member of the House of Representatives was 20-year-old Wyatt Roy, elected in the 2010 federal election.

===Austria===
In Austria, a person must be 18 years of age or older to stand in elections to the European Parliament or National Council. The Diets of regional &quot;Länder&quot; are able to set a minimum age lower than 18 for to be in the polls in elections to the Diet itself as well as to municipal councils in the Land. In presidential elections the candidacy age is 35.

===Belgium===
Any Belgian who has reached the age of 18 years can stand for election for the Chamber of Representatives, can become a member of the Senate, or can be elected in one of the regional parliaments. This is regulated in the Constitution (Art. 64) and in the Special Law on the Reform of the Institutions.

===Belize===
According to the Constitution of Belize, a person must be at least 18 years old to be elected as a member of the House of Representatives and must be at least 30 to be Speaker of the House. A person must be at least 18 years old to be appointed to the Senate and must be at least 30 to be president or Vice-President of the Senate. As only members of the House of Representatives are eligible to be appointed prime minister, the Prime Minister must be at least 18 years old. A person must also be at least 18 years old to be elected to a village council.

===Brazil===
The Brazilian Constitution (Article 14, Section 3 (VI)) defines 35 years as the minimum age for someone to be elected president, Vice-President or Senator; 30 years for state Governor or Vice-Governor; 21 for Federal or State Deputy, Mayor or Vice-Mayor; and 18 for city Council member.

===Canada===
In Canada, the constitution does not outline any age requirements to run for elected office, simply stating &quot;Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of the members of the House of Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for membership therein.&quot; However under the current Elections Canada Act to be eligible to run for elected office (municipal, provincial, federal) one must be a minimum of 18 years or older on the day of the election. Prior to 1970, the age requirement was 21 along with the voting age. 

To be appointed to the Senate (Upper House), one must be at least 30 years of age, under 75 years of age, must possess land worth at least $4,000 in the province for which they are appointed, and must own real and personal property worth at least $4,000, above their debts and liabilities.

In the province of Ontario, Sam Oosterhoff, a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, was first elected at the age of 19 in a November 2016 by-election, the youngest Ontario MPP to ever be elected. 

Pierre-Luc Dusseault (born May 31, 1991) is a Canadian politician who was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2011 federal election at the age of 19, becoming the youngest Member of Parliament in the country&#x27;s history. He was sworn into office two days after his 20th birthday. He was re-elected in 2015 but lost his seat in the 2019 Canadian federal election.

===Central African Republic===
Article 36 of the 2016 Constitution of the Central African Republic requires that candidates for President must &quot;be aged thirty-five (35) years at least [on] the day of the deposit of the dossier of the candidature&quot;.

Every Israeli Citizen (including minors) can be appointed as a Government Minister, or elected as President of Israel, but the latter role is mostly ceremonial and elected by the Parliament.

===Italy===
In Italy, a person must be at least 50 to be President of the Republic, 40 to be a Senator, and 25 to be a Deputy, as specified in the 1947 Constitution of Italy. 18 years of age is sufficient, however, to be elected member of the Council of Regions, Provinces, and Municipalities (Communes).

===Iran===
In Iran a person must be at least 21 years old to run for president.

===Iraq===
The Iraqi constitution states that a person must be at least 40 years old to run for president and 35 years old to be prime minister. Until 2019, the electoral law set the age limit at 30 years old for candidates to run for the Council of Representatives. However, the new Iraqi Council of Representatives Election Law (passed in 2019, yet to be enacted) lowered the age limit to 28.

===Ireland===
The 1937 Constitution of Ireland requires the President to be at least 35 and members of the Oireachtas (legislature) to be 21. Members of the European Parliament for Ireland must also be 21. Members of local authorities must be 18, reduced from 21 in 1973. The 1922–1937 Constitution of the Irish Free State required TDs (members of the Dáil, lower house) to be 21, whereas Senators had to be 35 (reduced to 30 in 1928). At the 1987 general election, the High Court ruled that a candidate (Hugh Hall) was eligible who reached the minimum age after the date of nomination but before the date of election. The Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2015 proposed to lower the presidential age limit to 21. However, this proposal was rejected by 73% of the voters.

===Japan===
In Japan a person must be at least:
*25 to be the Member of parliament of the House of Representatives with Japanese nationality, to be the Member of metropolitan, prefecture, city, town, or village with valid vote rights, or to be the Mayor

===South Korea===

===Spain===
Spain has two legislative chambers of Parliament, a lower house and an upper house. These are the Congress of Deputies (lower house) and the Senate of Spain (upper house) respectively. The minimum age requirement to stand and to be elected to either house is 18 years of age.

===Sweden===

The minimum age to be elected as president or vice-president is 40.

=== Tibet ===
The 14th Dalai Lama was enthroned at the age of 4, and none of his predecessors have been enthroned before age 4. The coming of age for the Dalai Lama is 18, when responsibilities are assumed. 

===Turkey===
The 1876 constitution set the age for parliamentary elections as 30. This remained unchanged until 13 October 2006, when it was lowered to 25 through a constitutional amendment. In 2017, it was further lowered to 18, the same as the voting age. In presidential elections the candidacy age is 40.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, a person must be aged 18 or over to stand in elections to all parliaments, assemblies, and councils within the UK, devolved, or local level. This age requirement also applies in elections to any individual elective public office; the main example is that of an elected mayor, whether of London or a local authority. There are no higher age requirements for particular positions in public office. Candidates are required to be aged 18 on both the day of nomination and the day of the poll. This was reduced from 21 by the Electoral Administration Act 2006.

===United States===

In the United States, a person must be aged 35 or over to serve as president. To be a senator, a person must be aged 30 or over. To be a Representative, a person must be aged 25 or older. This is specified in the U.S. Constitution. Most states in the U.S. also have age requirements for the offices of Governor, State Senator, and State Representative. Some states have a minimum age requirement to hold any elected office (usually 21 or 18).

====Controversies====

Many youth rights groups view current age of candidacy requirements as unjustified age discrimination. Occasionally people who are younger than the minimum age will run for an office in protest of the requirement or because they do not know that the requirement exists. On extremely rare occasions, young people have been elected to offices they do not qualify for and have been deemed ineligible to assume the office.

In 1872, Victoria Woodhull ran for President of the United States, although according to the Constitution she would have been too young to be President if elected.

In 1934, Rush Holt of West Virginia was elected to the Senate of the United States at the age of 29. Since the U.S. Constitution requires senators to be at least 30, Holt was forced to wait until his 30th birthday, six months after the start of the session, before being sworn in.

In 1954, Richard Fulton won election to the Tennessee Senate. Shortly after being sworn in, Fulton was ousted from office because he was 27 years old at the time. The Tennessee State Constitution required that senators be at least 30. Rather than hold a new election, the previous incumbent, Clifford Allen, was allowed to resume his office for another term. Fulton went on to win the next State Senate election in 1956 and was later elected to the U.S. House of Representatives where he served for 10 years.

In 1964, Congressman Jed Johnson Jr. of Oklahoma was elected to the 89th Congress in the 1964 election while still aged 24 years. However, he became eligible for the House after turning 25 on his birthday, 27 December 1964, seven days before his swearing in, making him the youngest &quot;legally&quot; elected and seated member of the United States Congress ever. 
In South Carolina, two Senators aged 24 were elected, but were too young according to the State Constitution: Mike Laughlin in 1969 and Bryan Dorn (later a U.S. congressman) in 1941. They were seated anyway.

On several occasions, the Socialist Workers Party (USA) has nominated candidates too young to qualify for the offices they were running for. In 1972, Linda Jenness ran as the SWP presidential candidate, although she was 31 at the time. Since the U.S. Constitution requires that the President and Vice President be at least 35 years old, Jenness was not able to receive ballot access in several states in which she otherwise qualified. Despite this handicap, Jenness still received 83,380 votes. In 2004, the SWP nominated Arrin Hawkins as the party&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate, although she was 28 at the time. Hawkins was also unable to receive ballot access in several states due to her age.

====Reform efforts====
In the United States, many groups have attempted to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states. In 1994, South Dakota voters rejected a ballot measure that would have lowered the age requirements to serve as a State Senator or State Representative from 25 to 18. In 1998, however, they approved a similar ballot measure that reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21. In 2002, Oregon voters rejected a ballot measure that would have reduced the age requirement to serve as a State Representative from 21 to 18.

During the early 2000s, the British Youth Council and other groups successfully campaigned to lower age of candidacy requirements in the United Kingdom. The age of candidacy was reduced from 21 to 18 in England, Wales and Scotland on 1 January 2007, when section 17 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 entered into force.
===Venezuela===
In Venezuela, a person must be at least 30 to be President or Vice President, 21 to be a deputy for the National Assembly and 25 to be the Governor of a state.

<text>The Comedy Mill was a Canadian sketch comedy television series, which aired from 1987 to 1991 on Hamilton, Ontario&#x27;s CHCH-TV, and through syndication on other Canadian television stations. The show starred the husband and wife comedy duo of Steve Smith and Morag Smith, with a supporting cast that included Peter Keleghan, Linda Kash and Mag Ruffman.

The show was a revival of their earlier &quot;Smith &amp; Smith&quot; series, which ended in 1985. For the 85-86 television season, the Smiths and their children Max and David starred in the family sitcom &quot;Me &amp; Max&quot;.

One of the show&#x27;s regular features involved parody music videos, presented by Kash as a caricature of a television VJ. Some of the parody videos even made it into rotation on MuchMusic and The Nashville Network.

After &quot;The Comedy Mill&quot; ended its run, Morag retired from performing and Steve launched his most famous series, &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;. Red Green had appeared as a recurring character on all of the duo&#x27;s earlier shows, including &quot;The Comedy Mill&quot;.

<text>Whitchurch-on-Thames is a village and civil parish on the Oxfordshire bank of the River Thames, about northwest of Reading, Berkshire, in close proximity to Whitchurch Hill. Opposite Whitchurch on the Berkshire bank is the village of Pangbourne.

==History==
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary was originally Norman, and was altered in the 15th century. In 1858 the Gothic Revival architect Henry Woodyer completely rebuilt the church, retaining only the Norman south door, Perpendicular Gothic south porch and a few other items. The parish is now a member of the Langtree Team Ministry: a Church of England benefice that also includes the parishes of Checkendon, Ipsden, North Stoke, Stoke Row and Woodcote.

Since the 16th century Whitchurch has had a weir and flash lock on the Thames to manage water levels for navigation. In 1787 the flash lock was replaced with a pound lock, Whitchurch Lock. The original Whitchurch Toll Bridge between Whitchurch and Pangbourne was built in 1792. The current structure, still privately owned, is the fourth on the site, the bridge having been reconstructed in 1853, 1902 and 2014. The current toll for a car to cross is 60 pence.

==Amenities==
Whitchurch has a primary school. Whitchurch has two public houses, the Ferryboat and the Greyhound Inn.

<text>Kildonan was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The boundaries for the riding maintained their location through the 2008 redistribution.

== History ==

===Kildonan (1870–1899)===

The original Kildonan riding was created at the time of the province&#x27;s establishment in 1870. It was dominated by Manitoba&#x27;s &quot;old settler&quot; population (i.e., English-speaking families who had lived in the Red River Settlement for many years before the province&#x27;s creation). There was a large &quot;mixed blood&quot; aboriginal population in the riding, and many of its residents were also of Scottish or partly Scottish ancestry. From 1886 to 1888, the riding was incorporated into &quot;Kildonan and St. Paul&quot; riding.

Kildonan was a hotly contested riding between the Conservatives and Liberals following the establishment of party government in 1888. In 1899, it was dissolved into the riding of &quot;Kildonan and St. Andrews&quot;.

===Kildonan and St. Andrews (1920–1958)===

From 1920 to 1927, the Kildonan and St. Andrews riding was represented by Labour Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Charles Tanner. Otherwise, it continued to return Liberals and Conservatives until being merged into &quot;Kildonan-Transcona&quot; in 1949. After that time, it was generally considered a safe riding for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.

===Kildonan-Transcona (1949–1958)===
Created out of Kildonan and St. Andrews, Winnipeg, St. Clements and Springfield for the 1949 election. Was abolished prior to the 1958 election into Seven Oaks, Kildonan, Elmwood, Radisson and Springfield.

=== Kildonan (1958–2019) ===

A riding with the name Kildonan was reestablished in 1957, and formally came into being in the provincial election of 1958. It was located in the northeastern part of the current City of Winnipeg, The Kildonan riding that existed from the 1958 election up to the election of 1981 was located in the East Kildonan area on the east side of the Red River. The riding of Kildonan that existed since 1981 in northwest Winnipeg had completely different boundaries from the old Kildonan riding as this new Kildonan riding was carved out of the old Seven Oaks riding on the west side of the Red River. This new riding was bordered on the east by River East and Rossmere, to the south by St. Johns and Burrows, to the north by Gimli, and to the west by The Maples.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,522. In 1999, the average family income was $54381, and the unemployment rate was 6.80%. Almost 18% of the population was above 65 years of age by 2016. Kildonan had a large immigrant population (23% of the total population in 1999), and was ethnically diverse. Ukrainians made up 14% of the riding&#x27;s population; a further 11% were Jewish, 7% Polish, and 3% Italian. Kildonan&#x27;s residents were primarily middle and upper-income. Manufacturing accounted for 16% of industry in the riding, with a further 15% in the service sector.

The seat was generally regarded as safe for the New Democratic Party. The Progressive Conservatives won the former Kildonan on the (east side of the Red River) in 1962 (by 4 votes in the 1962 election) and the Liberals won the Kildonan riding on the (west side of the Red River) in 1988. In both cases, the NDP recaptured the seat after a single term.

Beginning with the 2019 Manitoba general election, the Kildonan riding was dissolved and much of its constituency was redistributed to the new riding of Kildonan-River East, which also took in parts of St. Johns and the now-defunct River East riding. Kildonan&#x27;s last MLA was Nic Curry, a young former officer in the Canadian Armed Forces Reserve.

<doc id="1239956" wikidata="Q2784028" url="?curid=1239956" title="I'm All Right Jack">
<text>I&#x27;m All Right Jack is a 1959 British comedy film directed and produced by John and Roy Boulting from a script by Frank Harvey, John Boulting and Alan Hackney based on the 1958 novel &quot;Private Life&quot; by Alan Hackney.

The film is a sequel to the Boultings&#x27; 1956 film &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; and Ian Carmichael, Dennis Price, Richard Attenborough, Terry-Thomas and Miles Malleson reprise their characters. Peter Sellers played one of his best remembered roles as the trades union shop steward Fred Kite, and won a BAFTA Best Actor Award. The rest of the cast included many well-known British comedy actors of the time.

The film is a satire on British industrial life in the 1950s. The title is a well-known English expression indicating smug and complacent selfishness. The trade unions, workers and bosses are all seen to be incompetent or corrupt. The film is one of the satires made by the Boulting Brothers between 1956 and 1963.

==Plot==

Stanley Windrush chats with his father at the Sunnyglades Nudist Camp, and is persuaded to seek a job as a business executive: he interviews at the &quot;Detto&quot; company making washing detergent and, making a very unfavourable impression, fails to get the job. He then interviews at &quot;Num-Yum,&quot; a factory making processed cakes. Although it tastes good the process for making the cakes is very disturbing. An excess of samples causes him to be sick into a large mixing bowl of the product. Again he fails to get the job. The recruitment agent tells Windrush by letter that after getting 11 interviews in 10 days and making a singularly unimpressive impression that industry is not for him.

His uncle, Bertram Tracepurcel and his old army comrade, Sidney DeVere Cox, persuade Windrush to take an unskilled blue-collar job at Tracepurcel&#x27;s missile factory, Missiles Ltd. At first suspicious of Windrush as an over-eager newcomer, communist shop steward Fred Kite asks that Stanley be sacked for not having a union card. However, after a period of work-to-rule, he takes Stanley under his wing and even offers to take him in as a lodger. When Kite&#x27;s daughter Cynthia drops by, Stanley readily accepts.

Meanwhile, personnel manager Major Hitchcock is assigned a time and motion study expert, Waters, to measure how efficient the employees are. The workers refuse to cooperate but Waters tricks Windrush into showing him how much more quickly he can do his job with his forklift truck than other more experienced employees. When Kite is informed of the results, he calls a strike to protect the rates his union workers are being paid. This is what Cox and Tracepurcel want: Cox owns a company that can take over a large new contract with a Middle Eastern country at an inflated cost. He, Tracepurcel and a Mr Mohammed, the country&#x27;s representative, would each pocket a third of the £100,000 difference (£ million today). The excuse to the foreign government is that a faster contract costs more.

The union meet and decide to punish Windrush by &quot;sending him to Coventry&quot; and he is informed of this in writing. Stanley&#x27;s rich aunt visits the Kite household where she is met by Mrs Kite with some sympathy.

Things do not work out for either side. Cox arrives at his factory, Union Jack Foundries, to find that his workers are walking out in a sympathy strike. The press reports that Kite is punishing Windrush for working hard. When Windrush decides to cross the picket line and go back to work (and reveals his connection with the company&#x27;s owner), Kite asks him to leave his house. This provokes the adoring Cynthia and her mother to go on strike. More strikes spring up, bringing the country to a standstill.

Faced with these new developments, Tracepurcel has no choice but to send Hitchcock to negotiate with Kite. They reach an agreement but Windrush has made both sides look bad and has to go.

Cox tries to bribe Windrush with a bagful of money to resign but Windrush turns him down. On a televised discussion programme (&quot;Argument&quot;) hosted by Malcolm Muggeridge, Windrush reveals to the nation the underhanded motivations of all concerned. When he throws Cox&#x27;s bribe money into the air, the studio audience riots.

In the end, Windrush is accused of causing a disturbance and bound over to keep the peace for 12 months. He is last seen with his father relaxing at a nudist colony, only to have to flee from the female residents&#x27; attentions. Unlike in the opening scene, this time he is naked.

<text>Suzanne Mary Sinclair (born 4 May 1946) is a former New Zealand politician of the Labour Party. She was an MP from 1993 to 1996, representing the Titirangi electorate.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Sinclair was born in 1946 at Auckland. She was educated at Epsom Girls&#x27; Grammar School before attending Auckland Teachers College where she attained a diploma in teaching. Subsequently, she had a career in education as a teacher, literacy tutor, and a tutor for the Hillary Commission. She had one son.

Aside from education, Sinclair worked as an employment officer at the Department of Labour, a co-ordinator of the Friends of the Zoo programme at Auckland Zoo and managed a hire plant nursery business.

===Political career===

Sinclair joined the Labour Party in 1975 and held party positions in the electorate and Labour&#x27;s Auckland Regional Council. She was also a member of Labour&#x27;s New Zealand Council.

In 1980 Sinclair stood unsuccessfully for the Auckland City Council on a Labour Party ticket. She was later elected to the council after at large was abolished and replaced with a ward system. She was elected in 1986 as a councillor for the Avondale Ward. She was re-elected in 1989 and 1992 before deciding not to stand again in 1995. She was also a member of the Avondale Community Board, the Portage Licensing Trust and the Auckland Institute of Technology Council.

Sinclair was first elected to Parliament in the 1993 election as MP for Titirangi when she beat the incumbent, National&#x27;s Marie Hasler. The Titirangi electorate was abolished when mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting was introduced for the 1996 election. In the 1996 election, Sinclair unsuccessfully contested the Waitakere electorate, when she was in turn beaten by Hasler. Sinclair was also a list candidate ranked at 27, but Labour did not win sufficient votes for her to remain in Parliament.

===Career after politics===
For some years before the Britomart Transport Centre opened in 2003, Sinclair was the head of the Britomart information centre, which was funded by Auckland City Council. She was appointed by the Minister of Transport, Mark Gosche, to the chairmanship of the Road Safety Trust in March 2001, and she stepped down from this role in December 2007. Sinclair is currently relationship manager at the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). She chairs the WALSHtrust, an organisation in West Auckland supporting people with mental health, illness, and disability issues.

==Awards and recognition==
In the 2020 New Year Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the community and governance. She is also a Justice of the Peace.

<text>Daniel Lee Dierdorf (born June 29, 1949) is an American sportscaster and former professional football player. He played 13 seasons (1971–1983) as an offensive tackle for the St. Louis Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL).

Dierdorf played college football for the Michigan Wolverines from 1968 to 1970 and was selected as a consensus All-America in 1970 and a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player in 1969 and 1970. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1996 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000.

Playing in the NFL for St. Louis, he was selected by the National Football League Players Association as the Offensive Lineman of the Year for three consecutive years from 1976 to 1978. Between 1974 and 1980, he played in the Pro Bowl six times and was chosen as a first-team All-Pro five times. He was named to the NFL 1970s All-Decade Team and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1996.

Since his playing career ended, Dierdorf has worked as a broadcaster. He worked for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) from 1987 to 1999, including 12 seasons as color analyst on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. He was then part of the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; team as an announcer for 15 years from 1999 to 2013. For the 2014 through 2021 seasons, he was the color analyst for Michigan Wolverines football radio broadcasts. In 2008, Dierdorf received the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award from the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Dierdorf was born in 1949 in Canton, Ohio, the son of John and Evelyn Dierdorf. He grew up near the site of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and watched as a boy as the museum was under construction. His father worked much of his life for the Hoover Vacuum Company, which was headquartered in North Canton. Dierdorf attended Glenwood High School (now known as GlenOak High School) in Canton. He played football and also competed in the discus throw and shot put while in high school. A lightly recruited prospect from Canton, Ohio, Dierdorf looked into a number of Midwestern schools with hopes of landing a football scholarship but did not receive offers from Notre Dame or Michigan State. Ohio State coach Woody Hayes spoke at Dierdorf&#x27;s high school graduation but didn&#x27;t think Dierdorf was talented enough to be a Buckeye.

==College career==

===1967 season===
Dierdorf enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1967, having been recruited by Michigan Wolverines football coach Bump Elliott. He played on both offense and defense for Michigan&#x27;s all-freshman football team in 1967. As a freshman, he was also the training adversary for NCAA heavyweight wrestling champion Dave Porter.

===1968 season===
As a sophomore, Dierdorf started nine of ten games at the right offensive tackle position for the 1968 Michigan football team that compiled an 8–2 record in Bump Elliott&#x27;s final season as head coach. Elliott called Dierdorf &quot;without a doubt&quot; his &quot;most active and talented offensive lineman&quot;. In Michigan&#x27;s victory over Wisconsin, Dierdorf played a key role blocking for Ron Johnson as Johnson set an NCAA record with 347 rushing yards and a Big Ten record with five rushing touchdowns. Dierdorf was credited with opening gaping holes on three of Johnson&#x27;s touchdown runs. Michigan assistant coach Tony Mason said, &quot;He just blew people out of Johnson&#x27;s way like they weren&#x27;t even there.&quot; Dierdorf received second-team All-Big Ten honors from the Associated Press (AP) in 1968.

Dierdorf sustained a knee injury on the first play of the 1968 Michigan–Ohio State game, and his ability to return to the team remained doubtful until the start of the 1969 season.

===1969 season===
In 1969, Bo Schembechler took over as Michigan&#x27;s coach and led the 1969 team to a Big Ten Conference championship and a No. 9 ranking in the final AP Poll. Dierdorf started seven games at right offensive tackle and one at left offensive tackle. At six feet, four inches, and 255 pounds, he was the team&#x27;s strong tackle, switching from one side of the line to the other, so that he could lead the play no matter which way it went. Michigan&#x27;s 1969 season culminated with a 24–12 upset victory over No. 1 Ohio State. For his performance in the Ohio State game, Dierdorf received the UPI&#x27;s Lineman of the Week award.

Dierdorf was selected by both the Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI) as a first-team player on the 1969 All-Big Ten Conference football team. He also received second-team All-America honors from the Central Press.

===1970 season===
As a senior, Dierdorf started nine games at right tackle and one at left tackle for the 1970 Michigan team that compiled a 9–1 record. At an October 1970 press luncheon, coach Schembechler opined that Dierdorf was &quot;as good as any tackle in the country&quot; with &quot;good quickness, wonderful strength, smartness, and competitiveness, and he&#x27;s a great leader.&quot; Asking if Dierdorf had any faults, Schembechler paused, then answered his own question: &quot;Faults? Hummmm. He&#x27;s got big feet and it&#x27;s hard to fit him into shoes. That&#x27;s all I can think of.&quot; Dierdorf was a consensus first-team pick on the 1970 College Football All-America Team, receiving first-team honors from the American Football Coaches Association, the AP, the Football Writers Association of America, the Newspaper Enterprise Association, and the UPI. He was also picked by both the AP and UPI as a first-team All-Big Ten player, and was picked to play in three post-season all-star games: the East–West Shrine Game, Hula Bowl, and College All-Star Game.

==Professional career==

===1971–1973===
Dierdorf was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the second round (43rd overall pick) of the 1971 NFL draft. As a rookie in 1971, he appeared in 12 games, six as a starter. During the 1972 and 1973 seasons, Dierdorf became a fixture in the Cardinals&#x27; offensive line, starting all 14 games both years. However, the Cardinals continued to struggle, compiling identical 4–9–1 records all three years. Dierdorf played at the offensive guard and offensive tackle positions in 1971 and 1972 before settling in at the offensive tackle in 1973.

===1974–1978===
From 1974 to 1976, Dierdorf started every game at right tackle for the Cardinals during a three-year span in which the team compiled records of 10–4, 11–3, and 10–4 under head coach Don Coryell. In 1977, Dierdorf sustained a broken jaw and missed two games to injury as the Cardinals fell to 7–7. In 1978, Dierdorf started all 16 games at right tackle for the Cardinals.

During his peak years from 1974 to 1978, Dierdorf was regarded as one of the best offensive linemen in the NFL. He was selected by the National Football League Players Association as the Offensive Lineman of the Year for three consecutive years from 1976 to 1978. The Cardinals&#x27; offensive line, led by Dierdorf, Conrad Dobler, and Tom Banks, led the NFL with the fewest sacks allowed for three years (and the National Football Conference for five years) in the mid-1970s. In 1975, the group set an NFL record, allowing only eight sacks in 14 games.

Dierdorf did not allow a sack during the entire 1976 and 1977 seasons. His streak ended in the first game of the 1978 season when Chicago Bears defensive end Tommy Hart tallied two sacks against Dierdorf. Dierdorf had not given up a sack since the 1975 NFC Divisional playoff game when Jack Youngblood sacked Jim Hart.

Dierdorf was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for five consecutive years from 1974 to 1978. Dierdorf also received first-team All-NFL honors as follows: in 1975 from the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA); in 1976 from the Associated Press (AP), PFWA, Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), and &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot; (PFW); in 1977 from AP, PFWA, NEA, and PFW; and in 1978 from AP, PFWA, NEA, PFW. He was named as the NFC choice for the NFLPA/Coca-Cola Offensive Lineman of the Year Award three straight years (1976–78) and was the Seagram&#x27;s Seven Crowns of Sports Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1975. He also won the Forrest Gregg Award for NFL Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1975.

===1979–1983===
On September 9, 1979, Dierdorf sustained torn ligaments in his left knee during an extra point attempt in the second quarter of the second game of the season against the New York Giants. After the game, Dierdorf said, &quot;The knee was completely out of the socket. It moved a couple of inches off to the side. My leg was all twisted around and my foot was pointing in the wrong direction. It was painful. Very painful.&quot; Dierdorf was carried off the field on a stretcher, underwent knee surgery, and missed the remainder of the 1979 season.

Dierdorf returned to the Cardinals in 1980, starting all 16 games for the team at right tackle in both the 1980 and 1981 seasons. In 1980, he was selected to play in the Pro Bowl and was selected as a first-team All-NFL player by the NEA. In 1982, Dierdorf moved to center and was the starter at that position for all nine games in a strike-shortened season.

In 1983, Dierdorf returned to his right tackle position and appeared in seven games, only four as a starter. On October 11, 1983, after the Cardinals began the season with a 1–5 record, Dierdorf announced that he would retire at the end of the 1983 season. At the press conference announcing his retirement, Dierdorf said, &quot;This was an easy decision for me to make. . . . Physically, I just can&#x27;t play the type of game I want to.&quot; He added: &quot;Ninety-five percent of me is sad that I&#x27;m retiring, but my knees are very, very happy.&quot;

==Broadcasting career==

===KMOX and CBS (1984–1986)===
In January 1984, after retiring as a player, Dierdorf was hired as an afternoon talk show host by KMOX radio in St. Louis. In the fall of 1984, he also worked as a color analyst on radio broadcasts of Missouri Tigers football and St. Louis Cardinals football games. In late 1984, he also added St. Louis Blues hockey broadcasts to his repertoire. In the fall of 1985, Dierdorf was hired by CBS as part of its broadcast team for NFL games. He worked on CBS broadcasts of NFL games in 1985 and 1986.

===ABC (1987–1999)===
In April 1987, Dierdorf was hired by ABC to join Al Michaels and Frank Gifford on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcasts. He spent 12 seasons on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; before resigning the post in early 1999.

During his affiliation with ABC, Dierdorf also served as a blow-by-blow boxing commentator in 1989, beginning with Meldrick Taylor&#x27;s first defense of his championship, served as a correspondent for the network&#x27;s coverage of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, and called play-by-play of some &quot;College Football on ABC&quot; games in the early 1990s.

===CBS (1999–2013)===
In April 1999, Dierdorf signed with CBS and was paired with Verne Lundquist as the network&#x27;s No. 2 NFL broadcasting team. After week 2 of the 2000 season, Lundquist was moved to CBS&#x27; lead college football team, and Dierdorf served as commentator for Dick Enberg from 2000 to 2005. Lundquist would partner up with Dierdorf in week 1 in 2003 and 2005. He also partnered up with Kevin Harlan in week 1 of 2001, Ian Eagle in week 1 of 2002, and Todd Blackledge in week 1 of 2004 while Enberg was covering the US Open tennis on CBS. During the 2006 NFL season, Dierdorf was paired with Greg Gumbel as CBS&#x27; No. 2 NFL pairing behind Jim Nantz and Phil Simms. He remained paired with Gumbel for eight seasons from 2006 to 2013.

On November 20, 2013, Dierdorf announced that the 2013 NFL season would be his last as an analyst. &quot;It has become a challenge for me to travel to a different NFL city every week, so it&#x27;s time to step aside.&quot; Dierdorf&#x27;s final broadcast for CBS was an AFC divisional playoff game on January 11, 2014, between the Indianapolis Colts and New England Patriots.

===Michigan football (2014–2021)===
On April 17, 2014, Dierdorf was introduced as the new color analyst for Michigan Wolverines football radio broadcasts. He was paired with former college teammate Jim Brandstatter, who did play-by-play, on Michigan games. Brandstatter was Dierdorf&#x27;s backup on the offensive line, at strong tackle. Dierdorf and Brandstatter both retired from broadcasting after the 2021 season.

== Honors and recognition==
In 1994 and 1995, Dierdorf was a finalist for election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but he narrowly missed the required 29 votes on both occasions. In January 1996, he received the required vote count and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In addition to his election into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1996, other honors for Dierdorf include:

* Dierdorf was named to the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in October 1996.
* He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Family and other ventures==
Dierdorf and his wife, Debbie, continue to live in St. Louis. They have two children: Dana, born c. 1981, and Katie, born c. 1986.

<text>Elizabeth Patricia Tennet (born 1953) is a former New Zealand politician.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Tennet was born in 1953 in Feilding. She was educated locally before studying at Massey and Victoria University. Before entering politics, she worked as an official at the Department of Labour and as a trade union organiser as general secretary of the Central Clerical Workers Union.

Prior to entering Parliament, Tennet was involved in the Labour Party at an organisational level. She was a member of Labour&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Council, the Regional Council for the Wellington region and a member of Labour&#x27;s National Executive.

===Political career===

She was an MP from 1987 to 1996, representing the Labour Party. She was first elected to Parliament in the 1987 elections as MP for the Wellington electorate of Island Bay, replacing the retiring Frank O&#x27;Flynn. She gave birth to her son while an MP and travelled to Parliament with her 24-day-old child to attend a special caucus meeting in 1988 to support Prime Minister David Lange in a leadership challenge by sacked finance minister Roger Douglas.

In 1990 she became Labour&#x27;s junior whip as well as becoming party spokesperson on employment and associate spokesperson on women&#x27;s affairs. In 1993, Tennet was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.

In the 1995 local elections she was chosen as the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate for the Wellington mayoralty to replace the retiring Fran Wilde. Tennet came second in the election behind Mark Blumsky. Media were anticipating a neck-and-neck result between herself and Blumsky, but Blumsky won a much larger majority than expected. Wilde did not support Tennet&#x27;s candidacy thinking she was not right for the role and she was only standing for mayor because the Island Bay seat was being abolished at the next general election. Tennet and another MP, Graham Kelly, described Wilde as a turncoat for her criticisms.

Tennet, the third woman to have a child whilst an MP, decided that her priorities had changed since entering politics in order to spend more time with her six-year-old son she decided to retire from parliament at the .

===Later activities===
In 2009, Tennet was appointed chief executive of industry development organisation Textiles New Zealand. In 2011 she became the chief executive of Community Law Centres o Aotearoa

<text>John Edward Jones (December 5, 1840 – April 10, 1896) was an American politician who was the eighth Governor of Nevada. He was a member of the Silver Party.

==Biography==
Jones was born in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, and his family moved to Iowa in 1856. His early education was in the common schools of his native Wales. He graduated from the Iowa State University in 1865. He married Elizabeth Weyburn on November 25, 1880, and they had two children, Edith and Arvin.

==Career==
As a young man, Jones worked as a miner, a farmer, and a teacher. In 1867, he worked on building the Union Pacific Railroad. Settling in Eureka, Nevada in 1869, he was involved in organizing the Nevada Militia in 1876 where he served as Major.

Jones worked mining and agriculture until 1883, when he was appointed Deputy Internal Revenue Collector. From 1886 to 1894, he was Surveyor-General of Nevada, serving two terms.

Jones resigned that post, in 1894 and ran for Governor of Nevada on the Silver Party ticket. He won the election and took office in 1895. During his tenure, irrigation programs were supported and the state&#x27;s first public library was established in Reno, Nevada. Diagnosed with cancer in the fall of 1895, he took a leave of absence, leaving Lieutenant Governor Reinhold Sadler in his office. He traveled to San Francisco, California to try to heal.

==Death==
Jones, losing his battle with cancer, died while still holding office on April 10, 1896, in San Francisco at the age of 55. He is interred at Lone Mountain Cemetery, Carson City, Nevada.

<text>Wilford Scypion (July 18, 1958 – February 27, 2014) was an American professional boxer.

==Amateur career==
Scypion was the National Golden Gloves Middleweight Champion in 1978.

==Pro career==
In February 1983, Scypion beat Frank Fletcher by a twelve round decision to take the USBA&#x27;s regional Middleweight title. This victory guaranteed him a world championship fight, against Marvelous Marvin Hagler. The two competitors met on May 27, in a fight televised by HBO Boxing, which was considered by many to show only the best fights available at the time. Scypion was knocked out in the fourth round in his only world title attempt, which was held in Providence, Rhode Island. It was the first bout to simultaneously decide the WBA, WBC and IBF titles in history. In the ninth round of a bout at Madison Square Garden on November 23, 1979, Scypion made his 13th knockout in 13 pro fights, but inadvertently caused the fatal injury of Willie Classen, who died five days later without having regained consciousness.

==Death==
Scypion died on February 27, 2014, from complications of pneumonia. He was 55.

<text>Harrow College is a further education college in England with two campuses, in Harrow and Harrow Weald. It was established in 1999 by the merger of two tertiary colleges; in 2017 it legally merged with Uxbridge College, and in 2023 merged with Richmond upon Thames College, forming Harrow, Richmond &amp; Uxbridge Colleges (HRUC).

Harrow College is (as of 2013) medium-sized and had over 2,400 full-time and 4,700 part-time learners. It also forms part of the London Borough of Harrow&#x27;s Harrow Sixth Form Collegiate.

==History==
The college can date back to the early 20th century; Harrow County School for Girls was founded in Lowlands Road near Harrow town centre in 1914, while Harrow Weald County Grammar School was opened in Brookshill, Harrow Weald in 1933. Until the 1970s these were grammar schools before a re-organisation turned them into sixth form colleges called Lowlands and Harrow Weald respectively.

In 1987 the tertiary colleges Greenhill College and Weald College were established in their place when the borough of Harrow adopted a tertiary provision system. A third tertiary college called Elm Park College was also established, while the former Hatch End-based Harrow College for Further Education closed down to make way for these, and the Catholic St Dominic&#x27;s Sixth Form College remained unaffected by the tertiary system. Greenhill and Weald colleges eventually merged on 1 August 1999, creating Harrow College.

On 1 August 2017, Harrow College merged with Uxbridge College to form Harrow College &amp; Uxbridge College (HCUC).

On 4 January 2023, HCUC merged with Richmond upon Thames College to form Harrow, Richmond &amp; Uxbridge Colleges (HRUC).

==Location==

Teaching takes place at the Harrow on the Hill campus on Lowlands Road and at the Harrow Weald campus in Harrow Weald as well as two smaller, dedicated construction-focused units; Whitefriars Centre and Harrow Skills Centre.

In 2015, the college opened two new buildings: The Enterprise Centre at the Harrow on the Hill campus and Spring House for supported learning at the Harrow Weald campus.

Harrow College has been awarded a Centre of Excellence for the Hearing Impaired, which is the only centre of its kind in North West London. The college is also a member of the Westminster Centre of Excellence in Teacher Training (CETT).

It holds the Pre School Learning Alliance kite mark.

==Curriculum==
Harrow College provides academic and vocational courses for young people and a range of professional and non-professional programmes for adult students. 
The college is highly regarded for its ESOL (English for speakers of other languages) and EFL (English as a Foreign Language) courses. The EFL programmes are accredited by the British Council.
The Learning Links programme has set a standard in the community for providing courses for students with learning disabilities and difficulties.

<doc id="1239989" wikidata="Q1987410" url="?curid=1239989" title="Ken Finkleman">
<text>Ken Finkleman (born 1946) is a Canadian television and film writer, producer, director, actor, and novelist.

==Biography==
Finkleman was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In Canada, Finkleman is best known as the writer, creator and producer of the CBC Television series &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, in which he starred as television news producer George Findlay. He later produced a number of other series for Canadian television as well, including &quot;Married Life&quot;, &quot;Foolish Heart&quot;, &quot;Foreign Objects&quot;, &quot;More Tears&quot;, &quot;Good Dog&quot;, and &quot;Good God&quot;. Each of these series also included the linking character George Findlay (or the nearly identical character George Britton in the first series, &quot;Married Life&quot;). Finkleman describes Findlay as his vehicle for exploring issues that both intrigue him and tick him off. His 2006 series &quot;At the Hotel&quot; was his only television project to date not to include the linking character.

He began his career doing radio and TV work at the CBC, teaming up with Rick Moranis, then a Toronto DJ. The two of them performed in a series of live performances on CBC&#x27;s &quot;90 Minutes Live&quot;, comedy radio specials and television comedy pilots including one called &quot;Midweek&quot; and one called &quot;1980&quot; (produced at CBC Toronto in 1979). Both pilots starred Finkleman and Moranis in a series of irreverent sketches including an early mockumentary sketch featuring Moranis as a Canadian movie producer and another featuring the dubbed in voiced overs of Nazi war criminals as they appear to be discussing their Hollywood agents and the money one can earn being interviewed on major documentary series like &quot;The World At War&quot;.

In 1982, Finkleman was tasked with writing two sequels to blockbuster films for Paramount Pictures, &quot;Grease 2&quot; and &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot; (also directing the latter), after the creative teams behind the original films declined to take part. Finkleman was given much larger budgets than his predecessors were, but both films, while still earning a profit, underperformed at the box office and were unfavourably reviewed by film critics. His television productions are seen, in part, as a reaction to his experiences in the mainstream Hollywood studio system.

Finkleman also wrote the 2010 novel &quot;Noah&#x27;s Turn.&quot; His brother, Danny Finkleman, is a longtime radio personality on CBC Radio One, who retired as host of &quot;Finkleman&#x27;s 45s&quot; in 2005. Finkleman and his former wife Marion L. Cohen, a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice, have two children.

<doc id="1239990" wikidata="Q31819" url="?curid=1239990" title="Kansas (Kansas album)">
<text>Kansas is the debut studio album by American progressive rock band Kansas, released in 1974 by Kirshner in the United States and Epic Records in other countries.

Kansas&#x27;s debut album followed the merging of two Topeka musical camps: Kerry Livgren, from a previous Kansas line-up, and White Clover, which played mainstream rock and blues. The newly formed group signed with Kirshner Records in 1973 and traveled to New York to record their first release.

The material on &quot;Kansas&quot;, written mostly by guitarist/keyboardist Livgren and vocalist/keyboardist Steve Walsh, had been culled from the repertoire of both groups. Livgren&#x27;s songs were generally longer and more elaborate than Walsh&#x27;s and featured mystical lyrics which reflected his intense interest in Eastern religions. &quot;Journey from Mariabronn&quot; was inspired by Hermann Hesse&#x27;s &quot;Narcissus and Goldmund&quot;, while &quot;Belexes&quot; and &quot;Aperçu&quot; were influenced by the pseudo-Asian sound of Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;.

&quot;Kansas&quot; was promoted by print advertisements which included the tagline &quot;Kansas is Koming.&quot; A promotional 7-inch single titled &quot;Man the Stormcellars: Kansas is Koming!&quot; was sent to radio stations and featured Don Kirshner hyping the album. Two 7-inch singles were released: &quot;Can I Tell You&quot; and &quot;Lonely Wind&quot;. Both failed to chart, though a live version of &quot;Lonely Wind&quot; (from the double-live album &quot;Two for the Show&quot;) did reach the Top 100 in early 1979. &quot;Playlist: Bringing It Back&quot; featured five songs from this album and five from &quot;Masque&quot;. The album was reissued in remastered format on CD in 2004. A remastered version of the album appeared on vinyl in 2014.

== Artwork ==
The album cover depicts abolitionist John Brown in a scene from &quot;Tragic Prelude&quot;, a mural by Kansas native John Steuart Curry. The original mural is painted on a wall at the Kansas State Capitol in Topeka. The album cover image is severely discolored and cropped to show only a small part of the original painting.

== Reception ==
In a contemporary review for &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, Max Bell wrote that, despite Kansas having all the elements for subtlety, &quot;bristling with hard rock commonplace, speed and beat, they rapidly cancel any hints of originality&quot;, showing a lack of personality which transforms the listening of the album in a boring enterprise.

AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review gave the nod to the band&#x27;s mix of progressive rock and boogie rock as being unique, but contended that it also makes them less interesting than other progressive rock bands. They also criticized their ambitiousness as being overdone: &quot;there&#x27;re a lot of scales and arpeggios, galloping triplets, dramatic organ, and stately ballads that signify nothing and go nowhere.&quot;

Tom Karr at ProgressiveWorld.net described the album as &quot;an outstanding debut, a brilliant display of song writing and musicianship, and a great statement of Kansas&#x27;s musical ethos.&quot; He felt that the song &quot;Aperçu&quot; has &quot;Kansas at their best, with frequent use of time and tempo changes, and well developed musical themes, showing a group of outstanding players and arrangers. The level of instrumental virtuosity displayed here is jaw dropping, and on either side of the Atlantic, there were few that could even hope to approach Kansas&#x27;s mastery of their craft.&quot; He defined &quot;Journey From Mariabronn&quot; as &quot;Kansas&#x27;s first full-on symphonic rock masterpiece, and the song has so many strong elements and themes, it goes beyond any simple analysis. This song provides the paradigm for the great works of the future, and introduces the writing style that would produce the wonderful songs of Kansas&#x27;s early discography.&quot;

Ranking on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart as high as #174, the &quot;Kansas&quot; album in the months subsequent to its release in the spring of 1974 sold over 135,000 units. The platinum success of Kansas&#x27; fourth and fifth album releases: &quot;Leftoverture&quot; (1976) and &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; (1977), revived commercial interest in the band&#x27;s early output, it being reported in January 1978 that both the albums &quot;Kansas&quot; and &quot;Song for America&quot; had at that point each sold between 300,000 and 400,000 units, with the third Kansas album, &quot;Masque&quot; (1976), having been certified Gold for sales of 500,000 units the previous month. Both &quot;Kansas&quot; and &quot;Song for America&quot; would eventually be certified Gold for selling 500,000 units, &quot;Song for America&quot; as early as 1980 but &quot;Kansas&quot; not until 1995.

<text>The first USS &quot;Macdonough&quot; (DD-9) was a &quot;Lawrence&quot;-class destroyer, which was a sub-class of , in the United States Navy. She was named for Commodore Thomas Macdonough

==Construction==
&quot;Macdonough&quot; was laid down on 10 April 1899, by the Fore River Ship &amp; Engine Company, Weymouth, Massachusetts; launched on 24 December 1900; sponsored by Miss Lucy Shaler Macdonough, granddaughter of Commodore Macdonough; and commissioned on 5 September 1903.

==Pre-World War I==
&quot;Macdonough&quot; failed to make the design speed of during trials, and along with her fellow Fore River-built destroyer &quot;Lawrence&quot; proved to have poor sea keeping. Both ships had their two 3-inch guns replaced by six-pounder guns, giving a gun armament of seven six-pounders.

After shakedown, &quot;Macdonough&quot; spent seven months as a training ship for midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland. On 31 May 1904, she joined the Coast Squadron, North Atlantic Fleet and for the next three years operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean. She was ordered to the Reserve Torpedo Fleet at Norfolk on 16 May 1907 and served with that fleet until the following year.

Placed in full commission on 21 November 1908, &quot;Macdonough&quot; became the flagship of the 3rd Torpedo Flotilla and sailed for Pensacola, Florida. She participated in operations out of that port until the following spring when she returned to the east coast. During the summer of 1909, she cruised with the Atlantic Torpedo Squadron off New England. She then returned to the Gulf of Mexico and steamed up the Mississippi River for the St. Louis Centennial Celebration. Returning to the east coast in December, she was placed in reserve at Charleston, South Carolina on the 16th. &quot;Macdonough&quot; took part in summer exercises during the summer of 1910 and returned to Charleston, where, with the exception of two cruises to New York, she remained for the next two years. In 1913 and 1914, she conducted summer cruises for the Massachusetts Naval Militia.

==World War I==
On 29 January 1915, &quot;Macdonough&quot; was detached from the Reserve Torpedo Flotilla and assigned to the Submarine Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet. For the next two years, she operated with submarines in maneuvers and exercises from Pensacola to Newport, Rhode Island. Following this duty, she commenced, on 27 March 1917, a recruiting cruise along the Mississippi River. In mid-June the ship departed New Orleans, Louisiana for Charleston where she joined the Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. Until January 1918, she performed screening assignments off the east coast. On 16 January 1918, she departed Philadelphia for Brest, France, arriving 20 February. She remained off the coast of France, providing escort and patrol services until 20 May 1919. Sailing for the United States, she arrived at Philadelphia on 24 June and remained in that port until decommissioned on 3 September. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 7 November 1919 and her hulk was sold to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company for scrapping on 10 March 1920.

==Noteworthy commanding officers==
* Lieutenant Julius Frederick Hellweg (14 September 1906 – 16 May 1907) (Later Rear Admiral) 
* Lieutenant Charles Adams Blakely (14 October 1912 – 1 December 1912) (Later Vice admiral)

<text>Cardiac markers are biomarkers measured to evaluate heart function. They can be useful in the early prediction or diagnosis of disease. Although they are often discussed in the context of myocardial infarction, other conditions can lead to an elevation in cardiac marker level.

Cardiac markers are used for the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome and for management and prognosis in patients with diseases like acute heart failure.

Most of the early markers identified were enzymes, and as a result, the term &quot;cardiac enzymes&quot; is sometimes used. However, not all of the markers currently used are enzymes. For example, in formal usage, troponin would not be listed as a cardiac enzyme.

==Applications of measurement==
Measuring cardiac biomarkers can be a step toward making a diagnosis for a condition. Whereas cardiac imaging often confirms a diagnosis, simpler and less expensive cardiac biomarker measurements can advise a physician whether more complicated or invasive procedures are warranted. In many cases medical societies advise doctors to make biomarker measurements an initial testing strategy especially for patients at low risk of cardiac death.

Many acute cardiac marker IVD products are targeted at nontraditional markets, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the hospital ER instead of traditional hospital or clinical laboratory environments. Competition in the development of cardiac marker diagnostic products and their expansion into new markets is intense.

Recently, the intentional destruction of myocardium by alcohol septal ablation has led to the identification of additional potential markers.

==Types==
Types of cardiac markers include the following:

==Limitations==

Depending on the marker, it can take between 2 and 24 hours for the level to increase in the blood. Additionally, determining the levels of cardiac markers in the laboratory - like many other lab measurements - takes substantial time. Cardiac markers are therefore not useful in diagnosing a myocardial infarction in the acute phase. The clinical presentation and results from an ECG are more appropriate in the acute situation.

However, in 2010, research at the Baylor College of Medicine revealed that, using diagnostic nanochips and a swab of the cheek, cardiac biomarker readings from saliva can, with the ECG readings, determine within minutes whether someone is likely to have had a heart attack.

<doc id="1240003" wikidata="Q2400922" url="?curid=1240003" title="Come Out and Play (The Offspring song)">
<text>&quot;Come Out and Play&quot; (sometimes subtitled &quot;Keep &#x27;Em Separated&quot;) is a 1994 song by the American punk rock band the Offspring. It is the seventh track on their third album, &quot;Smash&quot; (1994), and was released as its first single. Written by frontman Dexter Holland, the song was the second single to be released by the band, after &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Waiting&quot; (1986). It is considered the Offspring&#x27;s breakthrough song, as it received widespread radio play, with first attention brought by Jed the Fish of KROQ-FM, and reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, bringing both the band and the punk rock genre to widespread attention.

The song also appears as the second track on their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album (2005).

==Music and lyrics==
Stylistically, the track combines &quot;heavy riff-based punk&quot; with surf-style guitar work. 

Dexter Holland said that most songs on &quot;Smash&quot; &quot;were just about whatever was happening in front of me&quot;. In the case of &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, it was about gang and school violence: &quot;Back then I was a grad student and I was commuting to school everyday in a shitty car, driving through East L.A. Gangland central. I was there the day of the L.A. riots. So I was very aware of that part of the world, and a lot of that gun stuff came out in songs like &#x27;Come Out and Play&#x27;.&quot; The line &quot;you gotta keep &#x27;em separated&quot; was sung by Jason &quot;Blackball&quot; McLean, a friend and a fan of the band. Inspiration for this line came from Dexter Holland&#x27;s experience in a laboratory cooling Erlenmeyer flasks full of hot liquids.

==Critical reception==
Jennifer Nine from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; Single of the Week, writing, &quot;If only all sweaty hardcore boys jumping around in their big boots sounded this cool and this happy. A big fat groovy thing.&quot;

==Music video==
&quot;Come Out and Play&quot; was the first Offspring song for which a music video was created. The music video, directed by Darren Lavett, was shot in May 1994 and debuted on MTV in the summer of that year. The video is almost entirely in black-and-white with sepia tone segments, and features the band performing the song in the garage of a house with tinfoil covering the walls. There is also footage involving dogs fighting over a chew toy with a crowd watching, a horse race, a sword fight and some clips of several snakes and snake charmers, as well as some fencing scenes. The song is a nod to the Twisted Sister 1985 album &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;.

==Legal issues==
In 1994, Posh Boy Records owner Robbie Fields submitted a written claim to Epitaph Records via the Harry Fox Agency, alleging that the two-bar Arabian guitar phrase repeated throughout &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; copied the guitar solo from &quot;Bloodstains&quot;, a song by the Fullerton, California punk rock band Agent Orange written in 1979 to which Fields, as the song&#x27;s publisher, owned the copyright. Offspring lead vocalist and primary songwriter Dexter Holland had cited &quot;Bloodstains&quot; as one of the songs that sparked his interest in punk rock, saying it &quot;really influenced me, especially that Arabian-sounding lead. I&#x27;ve written a lot of stuff like that&quot;, and the Offspring&#x27;s public admiration had brought Agent Orange increased attention. Fields contended that the similarity between the two guitar parts amounted to the Offspring sampling Agent Orange, and requested that Epitaph pay a licensing fee of for each copy of &quot;Smash&quot; sold—equating to $60,000 or more at the time—which he would split evenly with Agent Orange frontman and &quot;Bloodstains&quot; writer Mike Palm. A lawsuit was not filed, as Fields said &quot;Nobody wants to pillory anybody. But I feel I have a fiduciary duty to represent Mike Palm&#x27;s interests.&quot; Palm declined to give an opinion on the matter, later noting that he was not involved in filing the claim but did not disagree with it, and invited listeners to compare the two songs, saying &quot;Anyone who listens will know what the issue is.&quot;

The Offspring&#x27;s manager Jim Guerinot called Fields&#x27; claim baseless, saying the two guitar parts were &quot;not even close to identical. They&#x27;re both in the same scale, [and] there&#x27;s no doubt there&#x27;s an influence, [but] it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s stolen. If he feels he has something, he&#x27;ll sue, and if we&#x27;ve done something that is proven wrong [by technical analysis of the two songs] we should be sued. But we don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s any merit to it.&quot; Randall Wixen, the Offspring&#x27;s music publisher, stated that a musicologist hired by Epitaph determined the two guitar parts were not identical, despite being based in the same Middle Eastern scale. &quot;We&#x27;ve told [Fields] a hundred times he&#x27;s not getting paid. He&#x27;s not getting a cent&quot;, Wixen said in 1996, stating that Fields and Palm would have to sue if they wished to pursue the claim. Although no lawsuit was ever filed, Palm maintained that he still deserved credit for the guitar riff: &quot;I could show you interviews in which Dexter Holland outright admits that he took that riff from my song and used it in his song,&quot; he asserted in 2000, &quot;In the rap world, when something like that is taken as a sample, they pay for it the same way I pay for guitar strings and picks.&quot; The claim became national news when the Offspring discussed it on MTV, leading to a backlash against Palm: &quot;Some punk kid&#x27;s perception of that is to think that I&#x27;m the bad guy,&quot; he said, &quot;but they don&#x27;t understand that the Offspring are millionaires and I&#x27;m just trying to retain whatever little tiny thing is mine.&quot;

Some fellow Californian punk rock musicians criticized the allegation. Frank Agnew, guitarist of fellow Fullerton band the Adolescents, remarked &quot;I don&#x27;t see how you can call that plagiarism; all it is, is an Arabic scale. It just reeks to me [as if] people are after a piece of the pie. If the Offspring did a guitar solo that was reminiscent of one of my guitar solos, I&#x27;d be honored, not [antagonized]. I think it&#x27;s real petty.&quot; The Vandals, who were signed to Holland&#x27;s label Nitro Records, released the song &quot;Aging Orange&quot; on their 1996 album &quot;The Quickening&quot;, with lyrics by bassist Joe Escalante mocking Palm&#x27;s claim to ownership of a style rooted in ancient Middle Eastern music.

&quot;Back in ancient Egypt many pharaohs went to jailFor misappropriation of my Phrygian scaleI said &quot;Listen, Tutankhamun, you&#x27;re driving me insaneIt&#x27;s obvious those bellies are all dancing to &#x27;Bloodstains&#x27;I figured out you owe me, and please try not to laughBut every time I hear it, I get one more golden calf&quot;&quot;

Palm called the song &quot;nothing but Joe&#x27;s desperate attempt to brown-nose the Offspring&quot;, characterizing it as &quot;lame and out of line. You think there was some ass-licking going on there?&quot;, sentiments echoed by Fields. Palm noted &quot;Aging Orange&quot; incorrectly implied he had sued the Offspring. Escalante, also an entertainment lawyer, said that Fields&#x27; and Palm&#x27;s attempt to get money from Epitaph and the Offspring represented &quot;the kind of crap I hate&quot; in both the legal system and entertainment business, and that the Vandals—with their long tradition of satirizing things they perceived foolish within the punk scene—would have ridiculed the situation regardless of the parties involved. The Offspring later covered &quot;Bloodstains&quot; for the soundtrack of the 2000 film &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s great that they recorded &#x27;Bloodstains, said Palm, &quot;but it doesn&#x27;t help me personally. Sometimes I feel like an old black bluesman who got ripped off.&quot;

==Alternate versions==
*The Offspring themselves made a middle-eastern styled instrumental version of the song. It can be heard as a hidden track at the end of &quot;Smash&quot; as well as on the &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; single.
*The UCLA Bruin Marching Band is known to play a marching band version of &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;.
*This song was covered by Richard Cheese on his 2000 album, &quot;Lounge Against the Machine&quot; and again released on the 2006 album, &quot;The Sunny Side of the Moon&quot;.
*The song is also played on wind instruments in the movie &quot;Click&quot;.
*&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic wrote a parody version entitled &quot;Laundry Day&quot; which was played live on his tours from 1996 through 2000, but was never officially recorded for any of his albums. There are conflicting stories as to why his parody was never recorded; either Yankovic never approached the Offspring about releasing the parody, or the band denied permission.
*Aside from Yankovic, five other parody versions of the song were recorded and released: &quot;Put the Cheese Away (Keep It Refrigerated)&quot; by Joe and the Chicken Heads (1995), &quot;Come Out and Pray&quot; by ApologetiX (1997), &quot;Wrong Foot Amputated&quot; by Bob Rivers, &quot;Get Them Immigrated&quot; by Manic Hispanic (2001) and &quot;Keep Her Penetrated&quot; by Blowfly (2006).
*A master track of this song is featured in the video games &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; and &quot;Rock Band Unplugged&quot;.

==Alternate appearances==
As well as appearing on &quot;Smash&quot;, the song also appears as the second track on their 2005 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. The music video also appears on the &quot;Complete Music Video Collection&quot; DVD, which was also released in 2005.

<doc id="1240005" wikidata="Q587021" url="?curid=1240005" title="Irish art">
<text>Irish art is art produced in the island of Ireland, and by artists from Ireland. The term normally includes Irish-born artists as well as expatriates settled in Ireland. Its history starts around 3200 BC with Neolithic stone carvings at the Newgrange megalithic tomb, part of the Brú na Bóinne complex which still stands today, County Meath. In early-Bronze Age Ireland there is evidence of Beaker culture and widespread metalworking. Trade-links with Britain and Northern Europe introduced La Tène culture and Celtic art to Ireland by about 300 BC, but while these styles later changed or disappeared elsewhere under Roman subjugation, Ireland was left alone to develop Celtic designs: notably Celtic crosses, spiral designs, and the intricate interlaced patterns of Celtic knotwork.
The Christianization of Ireland in the fifth century AD saw the establishment of monasteries, which acted as centres of scholarship and artistic production, and led to the flowering of the Insular art style with its highly decorative illuminated manuscripts, metalwork and stonework (High crosses). From around 1200 to 1700, however, Irish art was relatively stagnant, and Irish culture was left comparatively untouched by the influence of Renaissance art.

From the late 17th century, artists in the general contemporary styles of European fine art began to emerge, particularly the painting of portraiture and landscapes. The early 18th century saw increased prosperity and establishment of new cultural institutions including the Royal Dublin Society (1731) and Royal Irish Academy (1785). With a small pool of patrons and better opportunities to be found abroad, many Irish artists emigrated, especially to London (portraitists) or Paris (landscapists), which stifled the nascent indigenous scene.

By the start of the 20th century, things began to improve. Opportunities began to spring up at home; the Celtic Revival movement saw a renewed interest in aspects of Celtic culture, Hugh Lane established the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, the first public gallery of its kind in the world, and with increased patronage a new generation of homegrown talent and returning emigres gradually formed a solid basis for the regrowth of art in Ireland. The foundation of an independent Irish State in the early 1920s did not significantly alter the state of Ireland&#x27;s visual arts; in the years following Independence, the arts establishment (exemplified by the committee of the Royal Hibernian Academy) was dominated by traditionalists who steadfastly opposed attempts to bring Irish art into line with contemporary European styles. 

==Early Irish art==

===Up to 200 AD===

Irish gold personal ornaments began to be produced within about 200 years either side of 2000 BC, especially in the thin crescent-shaped gold disks known as lunulae, which were probably first made in Ireland, where over eighty of the around one hundred known examples were found. A range of thin decorated gold discs, bands and plaques, often with pin-holes, were probably attached to clothing, and objects that appear to be earrings have also been found. By around 1400–1000 BC, heavier thin torcs and bangles have been found.

The Late Bronze Age of 900–600 BC saw the peak of the surviving Irish prehistoric goldsmithing, with superbly worked pieces in simple but very sophisticated designs, notably in a type of dress-fastener that looks like a double-ended trumpet curved round so that the two bell mouths are roughly pointing in the same direction. There are also a series of grand gold collars, representing a development of the lunula, with round plates at either end, and a broad corrugated U-shaped body, decorated geometrically along the ridges and troughs of the corrugations. Goldwork all but disappears in the Iron Age, except for the late and enigmatic Broighter Hoard of the 1st century BC, which appears to mix local and Roman pieces.

Although Ireland tends to be strongly associated in the popular mind with Celtic art, the early Continental style of Hallstatt style never reached Ireland, and the succeeding La Tène style reached Ireland very late, perhaps from about 300 BC, and has left relatively few remains, which are often described by art historians together with their British contemporaries as &quot;Insular Celtic&quot;. Buried ironwork does not last long in Irish conditions, and gold is very rare, so the survivals are normally in bronze. The Petrie Crown, Loughnashade Trumpet and a series of discs whose function is mysterious are among the most striking pieces. The decoration on a number of bronze scabbards, many found in the River Bann, have inspired much discussion, as they seem close to other pieces from as far away as Hungary, and the possibility of an immigrant master has been raised. The National Museum of Ireland in Dublin holds the majority of major finds from the whole prehistoric period, with others in the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the British Museum in London.

===200 to 1150===

Material from Ireland with La Tène style ornament from the third to fifth centuries AD is difficult to demonstrate. In the 6th to 8th centuries the art of the newly Christianised Irish mixed with Mediterranean and Germanic traditions through Irish missionary contacts with the Anglo-Saxons, creating what is called Insular art (or the Hiberno-Saxon style) and the second and best known great period of Irish art. This is exemplified in such masterpieces as the Book of Kells, the Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch, the most spectacular of about fifty elaborate Celtic brooches in precious metal that have been found. 

The form of the illuminated manuscript book, new to Ireland, was taken up with enthusiam for luxury books, created in the monasteries, that were kept in the monastery church rather than the library, and were displayed to visitors who would appreciate the decorative styles that were close to those of the personal jewellery of the elite. Most were gospel books, with the most elaborate illumination often restricted to a relatively small number of pages with the evangelist portraits, their symbols, and abstract carpet pages. Narrative images were very few. 

The stone high cross, originally painted, was a distinctive insular type of monument, of which many examples survive. Later in the period, Scandinavian influences were added through the Vikings.

===1150 to 1550===

These earlier styles largely came to an end with the Norman invasion of 1169–1170 and the subsequent wide adoption of Romanesque art. Through the Gothic and Renaissance periods Irish art was essentially a regional variation of wider European styles, with many works imported from England or further afield, and some English artists and craftsmen active in Ireland. Many objects of a distinctively Irish form from the first millennium, such as bell or book shrine reliquaries, were renovated or repaired in the contemporary style. 

The superlative standard of the best Early Medieval works is not seen, but craftsmen such as metalworkers retained a relatively high social status. Many more signed their work than was usual in other countries in this period, but the rate of losses has been such that there is only a single metalworker whose signature is on two surviving pieces. They seem very often to have been attached to the court of a lord, as were poets.

A number of important literary or historical manuscripts from the period have survived, many now entirely in the Irish language; examples include the Book of Leinster, which is one of several with a text of the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; or &quot;Book of Invasions&quot;. But there are no surviving manuscripts with significant illumination beyond a few decorated initials. In contrast, the period saw a considerable development in the architecture of Ireland with several surviving churches and castles in English-influenced styles.

==1550 to 1700==
Wars, rebellions, and unrest, concentrated in the late 16th century, from 1641 to the 1650s, and after 1688, greatly hindered the developments of the arts, and the processes exemplified by the Flight of the Earls in 1607 largely brought to an end the position of the old elites of Gaelic Ireland, who had been a mainstay of patronage for artists. 

The visual arts were slow to develop in Early Modern Ireland, due to political disruption, and the lack of patrons in either government, the church, and wealthy resident landowners or business class interested in art. Yet beginning in the late 17th century, Irish painting began to develop, especially in portraiture and landscape painting. 

The English portraitist James Gandy was brought to Ireland after his patron James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond became Lord Deputy in 1661, and remained until his death in 1689. By the 1680s the Dutch Golden Age painter Ludowyk Smits was able to base himself in Ireland, mainly painting portraits. Irish painters typically looked outside Ireland for influence, training and clients who were wealthy enough to afford the purchase of art.

==After 1700==
By the 18th century an increasingly stable and prosperous Ireland was able to support a growing range of artists in various media, mostly based in Dublin. Edward Smyth (1749–1812), followed by his son John, got the main commissions for architectural sculpture. What became Belleek Pottery started around 1860, the first Irish manufacturer of fine ceramics, much for export. 

What is now the National College of Art and Design in Dublin has existed since founded as the Dublin Art School in 1746, training a high proportion of the artists mentioned below. Its founder Robert West had studied drawing and painting at the French Academy under François Boucher and Jean-Baptiste van Loo. A sculpture school followed later, with Edward Smyth the first principal.

As in other areas of work, many artists based themselves in the much larger market offered by England for most of their careers, including the 18th-century landscapist George Barrett, Sr., the portraitist Nathaniel Hone the Younger, James Barry, Daniel Maclise, John Lavery and Sir William Orpen. Sir Martin Archer Shee, another portraitist, completed his training in London and stayed, becoming President of the Royal Academy in 1831. The portrait sculptor Christopher Hewetson (c.1737–1798) moved to Italy in his twenties, and never left, catching English aristocrats on the Grand Tour, and producing many busts of Pope Clement XIV. Thomas Hickey went as far as China, as the official artist of the Macartney Embassy in 1793, but is best known for his works produced during his several years in Bengal in India. 

Despite great success in London and Florence, the portraitist Hugh Douglas Hamilton eventually returned to Dublin for the last years of his career. Philip Hussey from Cork, began as a sailor, being shipwrecked three times. He moved to painting ships&#x27; figureheards and exteriors, before starting a successful portrait practice in Dublin. Later, Walter Frederick Osborne developed his open air painting in France whereas Sir William Orpen studied in London. 

In the second half of the 19th century a climate of cultural resurgence and nationalist ideals contributed to the development of an Irish style. A revived interest in the Irish language and Celtic history prompted a revival in the Irish visual arts as well. Belfast born Sir John Lavery may be the most internationally known painter of this generation. He trained in Glasgow and France, but unlike Orpen, maintained close ties to his native land. In 1928 he was commissioned to paint the symbol of Éire which would be used as the central image on the bank note of the new Irish Free State. Other paintings embodied the call for independence, such as Beatrice Elvery&#x27;s &quot;Éire of 1907&quot; which depicts the history of Irish Catholicism with the still-nascent Irish Republic.

==Artists==
Early Irish masters include: Garret Morphey, Robert Carver, George Barrett, Sr., James Barry, Hugh Douglas Hamilton. The Irish impressionists included Roderic O&#x27;Conor and Walter Osborne, with other landscape artists: Augustus Nicholas Burke, Susanna Drury, Paul Henry, Nick Miller, Nathaniel Hone the Younger and Pat Harris.

Notable Irish sculptors have included Jerome Connor, John Henry Foley, Augustus Saint-Gaudens (born in Dublin, but emigrated to America at six months old), Mary Redmond, John Behan and Oliver Sheppard. Edward Delaney, Rachel Joynt, and Rowan Gillespie are contemporary sculptors. Harry Clarke, Sarah Purser and Evie Hone worked in stained glass.

Portraitists have included Daniel Maclise, John Lavery, William Orpen (both these War Artists in WWI), John Butler Yeats (father of Jack and William Butler), Henry Jones Thaddeus and Nathaniel Hone the Elder.

Apart from Francis Bacon, who left Ireland as a young man, the best-known 20th-century Irish artist was Jack Yeats, brother of the poet, also with an individual style that is hard to classify. The art of Seán Keating was poised between Social Realism and Romanticism, and addressed public and political themes in an emerging nation.

Irish Modernism began with Mainie Jellett, with later participants being The White Stag group, The Exhibition of Living Art, Norah McGuinness, Louis le Brocquy, Patrick Scott, Patrick Swift, and John Kingerlee. Abstract expressionists included Tony O&#x27;Malley, Nano Reid and Patrick Collins.

In Northern Ireland notable artists have included John Luke, Colin Middleton, William Scott, Neil Shawcross, Gladys Maccabe (artist), Basil Blackshaw and Frank McKelvey.

==Contemporary art==
Ireland&#x27;s best known living artists include Brian O&#x27;Doherty an art historian, sculptor, and conceptual artist who is based in New York City, Sean Scully an abstract painter who lives and works in New York City, Dorothy Cross, a sculptor and filmmaker and James Coleman, an installation and video artist. Robert Ballagh, Willie Doherty, and Sean Hillen also work in modern media. The Irish Independent Artists exhibited at the David Hendrik&#x27;s Gallery, Dublin during the 1970s and early 1980s. Joe O&#x27;Connor, figurative/dynamic painter of iconic sports heroes was one of its original members.

Interest in collecting Irish art has expanded rapidly with the economic expansion of the country, primarily focussing on investment in early twentieth century painters. Support for young Irish artists is still relatively minor compared to their European counterparts, as the Arts Council&#x27;s focus has been on improving infrastructure and professionalism in venues.

An exhibition called &#x27;The Art of a Nation: Irish Works from the Allied Irish Bank and Crawford Art Gallery Collection&#x27; was held between 13 and 31 May 2015 at the Mall Galleries, The Mall, London. It celebrated the story of Irish art from 1890s to the present day and included important works by Aloysius O&#x27;Kelly, Sir William Orpen, Jack B Yeats, William Scott, Sean Scully and Hughie O&#x27;Donoghue.

=== Mural painting ===

Northern Ireland has a significant tradition of political mural painting, from both the loyalist and republican standpoints.

<doc id="1240010" wikidata="Q2814593" url="?curid=1240010" title="Conan (talk show)">
<text>Conan is an American variety and late-night talk show that aired each Monday through Thursday at 11:00 p.m. Eastern time on TBS in the United States for 11 seasons, from 2010 to 2021. The show premiered on November 8, 2010, and was hosted by writer, comedian, and performer Conan O&#x27;Brien, accompanied by his long-time sidekick Andy Richter. Running for eight years and identifying as a traditional late-night talk show, &quot;Conan&quot; drew its comedy from recent news stories, political figures, and prominent celebrities, as well as aspects of the show itself. The hour-long show was akin to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s previous NBC late-night shows and was directed by Billy Bollotino.

Starting January 22, 2019, the show was reformatted to a half-hour length. In November 2020, TBS announced that the show would air its final episode in June 2021. The final episode aired on June 24, 2021.

Guests for the show came from a wide range of cultural sources, and included actors, musicians, authors, athletes and political figures.

==Episode format==
===2010–2018: Hour-long format===
====Structure====
&quot;Conan&quot; initially followed the established six-piece late-night format popularized by evening talk show hosts such as Johnny Carson and David Letterman, and previously executed during O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s tenures as host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Each episode of &quot;Conan&quot; from its first eight years runs 60 minutes in length, including commercials, and typically consists of:
*Act 1: Monologue
*Act 2: Comedy Bit(s)
*Act 3: Celebrity Interview 1
*Act 4: Celebrity Interview 1 continued
*Act 5: Celebrity Interview 2
*Act 6: Musical or Stand-Up Comedy Guest, Signoff

====Opening titles====
The original hour-long show opened with Richter proclaiming &quot;Coming to you from Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, it&#x27;s &quot;Conan&quot;!&quot;, and introducing O&#x27;Brien, The Basic Cable Band, as well as the episode&#x27;s guests. For the first several seasons, each episode had a title, which Richter would announce at the end of the opening sequence. The titles were in the style of old-fashioned murder-mystery radio shows, television sitcoms, or other assorted jokes. The episode titles were dropped in early 2014.

The original title sequence was designed by Rob Ashe, Dan Dome and Eric McGilloway. There were several different variations of the opening credits, with the final product being inspired by graphic designer Saul Bass. The opening design process was described by Ashe as utilizing &quot;organic-looking textures made of construction paper, soak them in soda, and light them in Photoshop.&quot;

====Monologue====
O&#x27;Brien opened each episode with a monologue drawing from current news stories and issues. The monologue was sometimes accompanied by clips and brief comedy skits, in addition to occasional interactions between O&#x27;Brien and Richter, and the audience.

====Sketches and comedy bits====

One or more comedy bits followed the monologue. Following the monologue, some comedy bits (such as those based on video clips) were presented from the monologue stage. Following the first commercial break, additional comedy sketches were typically presented from the desk area. Some sketches were original and appeared only once. Occasionally an additional sketch would air between the first and second guest.

===2019–2021: Half-hour format===
In May 2018, O&#x27;Brien and TBS announced the show would be reformatted into a 30-minute show, with a looser structure starting 2019.

In January 2019, O&#x27;Brien gave a more detailed description of the new format of his show. It would not feature a band or a desk area, and for the first time as host of a talk show, O&#x27;Brien would not be wearing a suit. He commented, &quot;I really don&#x27;t miss the desk. It started to feel like I&#x27;m doing someone&#x27;s taxes.&quot; The last hour-long regular episode aired on October 4, 2018. The new reformatted version premiered on January 22, 2019, on TBS. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s first guest for the new-look show was Tom Hanks.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the program switched to a remotely-produced format from O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s home beginning March 30, 2020. In July 2020, it was announced that &quot;Conan&quot; would continue with this format, but would now be filmed with limited on-site staff from the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles and no studio audience — making it the first American late-night talk show to return to filming outside of the host&#x27;s residence (albeit still not from its main studio). O&#x27;Brien explained that &quot;I got started doing improv at the Coronet in 1986 and I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;ve figured out a way to safely keep that theater going during this lockdown.&quot;

The international shows became available on Netflix before moving to HBO Max.

==History==
===TBS announcement===

Following the 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; conflict, O&#x27;Brien announced on the first day of The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour that he had signed a deal with cable network TBS to host a talk show on their late-night lineup, beginning in November 2010. Before the deal was announced, O&#x27;Brien initially had reservations about the move, as it would place comedian George Lopez&#x27;s show, &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot;, one hour later to midnight, effectively doing to Lopez what NBC had wanted to do with O&#x27;Brien. However, Lopez reportedly called O&#x27;Brien and expressed his excitement about the move. Lopez went on to state, &quot;I can&#x27;t think of anything better than doing my show with Conan as my lead-in It&#x27;s the beginning of a new era in late-night comedy.&quot; &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot; would be canceled less than nine months later. In an official press release by Turner Broadcasting, it stated that O&#x27;Brien had only begun negotiations a week prior to the official announcement of the show. Steve Koonin, President of Turner Entertainment Networks, went on to comment of the announcement, &quot;Conan has been the comedic voice for a generation. TBS already has a huge audience of young comedy lovers, and Conan&#x27;s show will give these fans even more reasons to watch our network.&quot;

In his own statement about the deal, O&#x27;Brien stated, &quot;In three months I&#x27;ve gone from network television to Twitter to performing live in theaters, and now I&#x27;m headed to basic cable. My plan is working perfectly.&quot; O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s production company, Conaco, reportedly owns all rights to the show. In addition to the announcement of the television series, TBS also announced a one-hour TBS Special, featuring several writers for &quot;Conan&quot;, as well as comedian Reggie Watts, who participated in O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour. The show was broadcast on June 27, 2010, leading up to the beginning of &quot;Conan&quot; in early-November. Additionally, in preparation for the show, a 24-hour &quot;Live-Coco Cam&quot; was set up on October 20, 2010, and featured various characters and staff members of &quot;Conan&quot;, including Richie Rosenberg, otherwise known as &quot;LaBamba,&quot; as well as a short online broadcast from O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s office entitled &quot;Show Zero&quot; on November 1, 2010. The show featured O&#x27;Brien as host, and was accompanied by Andy Richter, as well as Jerry Vivino, a member of the Basic Cable Band. The broadcast hosted several guests, including actor Jim Parsons and indie rock band Steel Train, and lasted a total of four minutes, and 51 seconds.

Weeks before the premiere, an orange &quot;Conan&quot; blimp was introduced to further promote the show. Designed by Blue Sky, an Atlanta firm, the dirigible provided aerial footage for 2010 Major League Baseball postseason games airing on TBS. It was subsequently incorporated into sketches on &quot;Conan&quot;, including a running gag where the blimp would follow actor Gary Busey around southern California, much to his chagrin.

===Series premiere===
The first episode of &quot;Conan&quot;, titled &quot;Baa Baa Blackmail&quot;, premiered on Monday, November 8, 2010, at 11 p.m. EST on TBS. The episode&#x27;s first guest was Arlene Wagner, the curator of Leavenworth, Washington&#x27;s Nutcracker Museum. Wagner&#x27;s position as &quot;Conan&quot;″s debut guest was chosen by fans through a &quot;rigged&quot; poll at Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s official website, TeamCoco.com. The poll also consisted of Pope Benedict XVI, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, performers Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga, and actor Jack Nicholson, among others. Wagner&#x27;s brief appearance was followed by actor and comedian Seth Rogen and actress Lea Michele, along with musical guest Jack White, who performed &quot;Twenty Flight Rock&quot;, along with O&#x27;Brien himself. Actor Jon Hamm, appearing as his character Don Draper from the AMC series &quot;Mad Men&quot;, and talk show host Larry King, of CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, made cameo appearances in the show&#x27;s cold open, with actor and comedian Ricky Gervais sending Conan a pre-taped message expressing his well wishes on the new series, then going on to express condolences for future job losses.

Reviews of the premiere episode by television critics were positive, calling it &quot;a looser, quirkier take on a late-night talk show, but still a late-night talk show.&quot; James Poniewozik of &quot;Time&quot; found the episode to be enjoyable, and compared it to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s tenure during &quot;Late Night&quot;. Itzkoff went on to state, &quot;The message, overall is that &quot;Conan&quot; the show is not so much about a reinvention of the talk show form as a restoration of Conan. He was doing something he wanted to do, a late-night talk show, and NBC made him stop doing it.&quot; He also praised the opening monologue, and Conan&#x27;s performance with Jack White during the episode&#x27;s conclusion. Frazier Moore of &quot;Associated Press&quot; went on to call the episode &quot;a stylishly back-to-basics hour that radiated hard-won lessons from his brief stay hosting &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;,&quot; in addition to admiring O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;appealingly stoked yet comfortable&quot; appearance on the show. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also appreciated the Masturbating Bear cameo, and went on to call the show &quot;pleasant, if a bit underwhelming.&quot; Less positive assessments of the show included Tom Gliatto of &quot;People&quot;, who accused the show of being a &quot;modest, lowkey and slightly awkward affair.&quot;

==Ratings==

Despite a promising start, &quot;Conan&quot; suffered from low viewership throughout its eleven year run. Its series premiere drew 4.1 million viewers according to Nielsen, though it dropped to 2.02 million viewers by its fourth episode. By December 2010, &quot;Conan&quot; was lagging behind its broadcast competitors in overnight ratings, averaging 1.3 million tune-ins; by June 2011, it was fourth behind its cable competitors as well, averaging 743,000 total viewers. The drop was steep: one year after launching, the show had lost 60% of its total viewership. In August 2011, TBS secured the cable syndication rights to &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; at a reported $2 million per episode to serve as a lead-in to &quot;Conan&quot; three nights a week, in an effort to boost his ratings. Viewership in 2012 was 914,000, two years later, it had slid to 862,000 viewers.

Halfway through its run, the show became the lowest-rated of all of the major national late-night talk shows: it dropped to 580,000 total viewers in 2015, a 32% decline over its previous year, including a 61% decline in its key demographic, down to 310,000 viewers. By 2017, there was talk of retooling the show to a weekly format; eventually the network agreed to cut the nightly show by half an hour in 2018. In its final season (2020–21), the show averaged a paltry 282,000 viewers, representing a total drop of 29% over its last year, and 36% in its main demographic.

The run of &quot;Conan&quot; coincided with an overall drop in the linear audience, with more people cord-cutting and pursuing streaming options. In contrast to its live audience, &quot;Conan&quot; boasted strong online revenues with its Team Coco website, attracting a particularly young viewership that TBS leveraged into lucrative advertiser relationships targeting digital and social media. Research indicated &quot;Conan&quot; had the youngest audience of any of the late-night programs, and by 2018, online videos of the program had collectively attracted 3.4 billion views. Surveys suggested in 2012 that &quot;Conan&quot; drew more Hispanic viewers than any other late night program; another ranking two years later found the show did well in ratings among low income inner city viewers.

==Production==
On May 16, 2010, O&#x27;Brien announced that his new show would launch at Stage 15 on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California. Taping of each episode began at 4:30 p.m. PST, which usually followed a rehearsal lasting from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m.

At its outset, O&#x27;Brien noted the new show&#x27;s effort to not to reuse any of the previous &quot;Late Night&quot; or &quot;Tonight Show&quot; sketches, despite the difficulty, and they were unsure if some sketches were going to work. However, O&#x27;Brien noted in interviews that he might bring back certain bits in time. Characters and bits that eventually made appearances on &quot;Conan&quot; included The Masturbating Bear, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, Celebrity Survey, The Audiency Awards, Clutch Cargo interviews, and an update on the &quot;Late Night&quot; sketch If They Mated called If They Melded. The final day of longtime writer/performer Brian Stack in 2015 also saw the one-time return of one of his characters, The Interrupter.

Prior to the show&#x27;s airing, O&#x27;Brien and Richter indicated that the show would more closely represent &quot;Late Night&quot; than &quot;Tonight&quot; in regard to content and material, meaning that edgier or questionable content excised as a result of the move to the earlier time slot will no longer be an issue at TBS. On the July 12, 2010, episode of Marc Maron&#x27;s &quot;WTF&quot; podcast, Richter said that they no longer have to &quot;worry about living up to a respected franchise&quot;, and that on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; certain sketches &quot;that just felt too 12:30&quot; would be cut and how &quot;it&#x27;ll be nice to not have to worry about that anymore&quot;. During an appearance at the 2010 San Francisco Sketch Comedy Festival, O&#x27;Brien told the audience he was &quot;no longer interested in &#x27;broadening&#x27; the audience or trying to reach everybody of all ages,&quot; further implying the content would not be toned-down.

On September 1, 2010, O&#x27;Brien announced that the new show&#x27;s title was simply &quot;Conan&quot;. Prior to the show&#x27;s debut, set designers John Shaffner and Joe Stewart, who designed O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s previous sets, cited The Legally Prohibited Tour as inspiration for the new set, adopting more of a &quot;theatre&quot; appearance than the previous shows. Shaffner commented on the choice of the show&#x27;s chair, stating, &quot;You find one that you like and then you build it yourself to make it a little shallower and a little more upright and the cushion a little firmer But not too firm or every time the guest sits down they&#x27;ll say, &#x27;Oooh this is a hard chair.&#x27;&quot; The rest of the set was described as being &quot;filled with warm wood tones and electric blue screens,&quot; and was compared to the set of his most recent stint on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. The new set featured several differences, however, including a remote-controlled moon, and the backdrop being transformed into a giant blue ocean.

In keeping with a change made during &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Richter joined O&#x27;Brien during celebrity interviews on the main set rather than remaining behind a lectern after the monologue. In May 2017, TBS renewed the show through 2022. The first show of 2018 saw the debut of a new set by production designer Christopher Goumas, which replaced the ocean backdrop with one depicting a studio backlot reminiscent of the Warner Bros. lot where the program was recorded. O&#x27;Brien began entering through a doorway on the left of the stage rather than a curtain on the right. O&#x27;Brien explained that the space was also deliberately tighter to promote a more &quot;intimate&quot; atmosphere, and jokingly demonstrated the ability for the set to be moved even closer to the audience on demand.

With the debut of the half-hour format in 2019, a new set was introduced with an even more compact design than before, which Richter jokingly compared to looking like &quot;a strip club from &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;&quot;, with the desk area replaced by a series of armchairs around a coffee table. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and the associated lockdown, the show relocated to the Largo following several months broadcasting from his home. The show remained at the Largo until the conclusion of the series. On November 17, 2020, O&#x27;Brien announced that the show would end after the conclusion of its tenth season, effectively retiring from hosting a late-night show. O&#x27;Brien announced that he was moving on to produce a weekly &quot;variety&quot; show on WarnerMedia&#x27;s streaming service HBO Max. &quot;Conan&quot;&#x27;s 75-minute series finale aired on June 24, 2021, and featured highlights from the TBS era, appearances by Homer Simpson and Will Ferrell, Jack Black as the series&#x27; final guest, and an extended farewell message from O&#x27;Brien.

==Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band==

Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band served as the house band for &quot;Conan&quot; from the show&#x27;s debut in 2010 until the end of its hour-long format in 2018. It was fronted by longtime band guitarist Jimmy Vivino. The band also included Richie &quot;LaBamba&quot; Rosenberg on trombone, Scott Healy on keyboard, Mike Merritt on bass guitar, Mark Pender on trumpet, Jerry Vivino on woodwinds, and James Wormworth on drums.

The Basic Cable Band started out as The Max Weinberg 7 on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in 1993, and was initially fronted by longtime E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg. It was renamed The Tonight Show Band with Conan&#x27;s move to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 2009. For the length of Conan&#x27;s 2010 North American tour, the band was called The Legally Prohibited Band, with Weinberg largely absent. Citing recent open heart surgery and a desire to remain on the East Coast, Weinberg officially departed in September 2010. For the launch of &quot;Conan&quot;, the band was newly christened The Basic Cable Band, with Vivino officially taking over as bandleader.

For &quot;Conan&quot;, O&#x27;Brien sought to revamp the show&#x27;s title theme song from its previous incarnations. In an interview with &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, O&#x27;Brien expressed his desire to create a new introduction from the previous compositions, which were used for O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s entire 17-year relationship with NBC: &quot;It just felt like the right thing to do There&#x27;s this feeling of, &#x27;Let&#x27;s try and build something new.&#x27; I came out to that theme for seventeen years and it does feel like, you know what? Let&#x27;s try some new stuff. Let&#x27;s try and change it up.&quot; The new theme song was co-written by Vivino and O&#x27;Brien.

Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band&#x27;s final appearance as house band took place on October 4, 2018. However, a smaller version of the band, christened Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Four, returned to serve as the house band for the final two weeks of &quot;Conan&quot; in 2021.

==Awards and nominations==
==International syndication==

In Australia, the program was aired on GO!, a multichannel of the Nine Network from August 2012 following the 2012 Olympic Games but eventually dropped by GO! mid-2014. Originally it was intended to screen within 12 hours after its original U.S. broadcast at 11:30pm weeknights. The Comedy Channel which aired the previous versions of Conan&#x27;s shows announced it would not air the program as the Nine Network had exclusive rights to Time Warner programs. Between November 2010 to July 2012, Conan was aired on GEM.

In Israel, the program began airing in early 2011 on the newly launched Comedy Central Israel channel. episodes were aired 4–5 days after their original TBS broadcasts. However, the channel discontinued airing &quot;Conan&quot; in October 2011.

From November 8, 2010, to August 30, 2013, the program aired in Canada on cable channel The Comedy Network on Monday to Thursday nights (Tuesday to Friday mornings) at midnight ET/PT, with a repeat on broadcast network CTV at 1:07 a.m. local time. The program was only initially announced for CTV, leading to some concern about the unusually late time slot, two hours after its airing in the United States for viewers in the Eastern Time Zone (the program airs on CTV Atlantic at 1:05 a.m. AT / 12:05 a.m. ET). This is due to local and national newscasts in the 11:00 p.m. hour, and CTV&#x27;s commitments to &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; at 12:05 a.m. and &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; at 12:35 a.m. CTV executives later said the program would likely air earlier on The Comedy Network, which is owned by CTV. However, that channel also had a conflict, since it has long aired both &quot;Daily&quot; and &quot;Colbert&quot; during the 11:00 p.m. ET hour, simulcasting the Comedy Central feed.

The Comedy Network then attempted to move up both programs to 10:00 p.m. ET beginning in September 2010, presumably to make room for &quot;Conan&quot; at 11:00; however, there were intermittent &quot;technical difficulties&quot; with getting the shows in time for the earlier airing, particularly for a series of special live &quot;Daily&quot; episodes in late October, which meant re-runs were aired in their place. After viewer complaints about the missed episodes, Comedy elected to move both shows back to their previous timeslots, meaning that &quot;Conan&quot; was rescheduled on that channel to midnight, on a one-hour delay from TBS. On September 3, 2013, Much Music began broadcasting the program every Monday to Thursday at 11 p.m. ET (8 p.m. Pacific), though it was moved back to its time-delayed midnight airing the following month. The repeat on CTV was moved to 1:37 a.m.

On September 3, 2014, the program began airing on Much at 12:30 a.m. after &quot;@midnight&quot;. On January 9, 2017, &quot;Conan&quot; began airing at 11 p.m. ET again, only to again be moved back an hour to midnight in April of that same year. &quot;Conan&quot; aired on Much until September 1, 2017. The program aired solely on CTV until April 2020, when it began airing again on the renamed &quot;CTV Comedy Channel&quot; at 11:30 after &quot;The Daily Show&quot; following Comedy Central&#x27;s cancellation of &quot;Lights Out with David Spade&quot;. The show was pushed back another 15 minutes to 11:45 after Comedy Central expanded &quot;The Daily Show&quot; by 15 minutes.

Selling rights to a Canadian channel was necessary, since TBS ceased being available in Canada in October 2007. The local Atlanta station through which Canadian cable subscribers had previously received TBS programming then adopted a distinct schedule as WPCH-TV. Some speculated that WPCH might pick up the program anyway, since the revamped station continues to air some of the same syndicated series as TBS, but WPCH later indicated explicitly that it had no plans to broadcast the new O&#x27;Brien program.

In the UK and Ireland, the show aired on the channel truTV since its launch in August 2014, though it has been absent from the schedules as of August 2017.

In Portugal, &quot;Conan&quot; was retitled &quot;Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. The show aired on SIC Radical, in the same timeslot as his previous NBC shows, with daily broadcasts beginning on October 5, 2009. The show aired Monday to Friday beginning around 20h45 to 21h30, following &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, with occasional reruns interspersed among new shows. New episodes aired about two weeks after the US broadcast. However, since January 2016, SIC Radical stopped airing the show because the show&#x27;s international distributor has ceased shipping the show outside the USA.

The show aired in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong on FX.

<text>In mathematics, and particularly in potential theory, Dirichlet&#x27;s principle is the assumption that the minimizer of a certain energy functional is a solution to Poisson&#x27;s equation.

==Formal statement==
Dirichlet&#x27;s principle states that, if the function formula_1 is the solution to Poisson&#x27;s equation 

:formula_2

on a domain formula_3 of formula_4 with boundary condition

:formula_5 on the boundary formula_6,

then &quot;u&quot; can be obtained as the minimizer of the Dirichlet energy 

:formula_7 

amongst all twice differentiable functions formula_8 such that formula_9 on formula_6 (provided that there exists at least one function making the Dirichlet&#x27;s integral finite). This concept is named after the German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.

==History==
The name &quot;Dirichlet&#x27;s principle&quot; is due to Bernhard Riemann, who applied it in the study of complex analytic functions.

Riemann (and others such as Carl Friedrich Gauss and Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet) knew that Dirichlet&#x27;s integral is bounded below, which establishes the existence of an infimum; however, he took for granted the existence of a function that attains the minimum. Karl Weierstrass published the first criticism of this assumption in 1870, giving an example of a functional that has a greatest lower bound which is not a minimum value. Weierstrass&#x27;s example was the functional

:formula_11

where formula_12 is continuous on formula_13, continuously differentiable on formula_14, and subject to boundary conditions formula_15, formula_16 where formula_17 and formula_18 are constants and formula_19. Weierstrass showed that formula_20, but no admissible function formula_12 can make formula_22 equal 0. This example did not disprove Dirichlet&#x27;s principle &quot;per se&quot;, since the example integral is different from Dirichlet&#x27;s integral. But it did undermine the reasoning that Riemann had used, and spurred interest in proving Dirichlet&#x27;s principle as well as broader advancements in the calculus of variations and ultimately functional analysis.

In 1900, Hilbert later justified Riemann&#x27;s use of Dirichlet&#x27;s principle by developing the direct method in the calculus of variations.

<doc id="1240013" wikidata="Q960731" url="?curid=1240013" title="Self Esteem (song)">
<text>&quot;Self Esteem&quot; is a song by American punk rock band the Offspring. It is the eighth track and second single from their third studio album, &quot;Smash&quot; (1994). The song was released on 22 December 1994 by Epitaph and was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Iceland, Norway, Latvia and Sweden. &quot;Self Esteem&quot; was nominated for the 1995 MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Song. The song also appears as the third track on their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2005). Its music video was directed by Darren Lavett.

==Critical reception==
In his review of the album, Andrew Mueller from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote, &quot;The clear highlight here is &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, a self-abasing, self-pitying slandering of some or other black-hearted wench set to a rocket as inventive as they get.&quot; Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; commented, &quot;Coming out once more to play the role of Nirvana&#x27;s perfect replacement, Offspring delivers the punky action so sadly missed on rock radio because of Seattlers who take themselves way too seriously.&quot; John Harris from &quot;NME&quot; said, &quot;The male-only dorms of US colleges have surely been throbbing to this for months. Small wonder: &quot;Self-esteem&quot; — to which the phrase &quot;Crap Teen Spirit&quot; barely does justice — is built around a premise that roots it firmly in the odorous world of the knucklehead male adolescent.&quot;

In 2012, &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked the song number four on their list of the 10 greatest Offspring songs, and in 2021, &quot;Kerrang&quot; ranked the song number two on their list of the 20 greatest Offspring songs.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Self Esteem&quot; was directed by Darren Lavett (who directed the previous video, &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;) and was shot in August 1994 after the Offspring had just gone both gold and platinum with &quot;Smash&quot;. In the music video several people are doing stunts, intercut with shots of the band playing on stage.

In the video, Dexter Holland wears three different band T-shirts. Initially, he wears a Sex Pistols T-shirt. Later he dons a T-shirt of the Germs, and then a Vandals T-shirt when he briefly appears as a human skeleton.

In an interview on the Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; DVD, Noodles claimed that he gave his Fender Stratocaster (which he played in the videos for &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; and &quot;Self Esteem&quot;) to one of the actors who appeared in the video.

&quot;Self Esteem&quot; remains one of the Offspring&#x27;s popular videos. Its popularity on MTV helped launch the song to success on mainstream radio. According to Nielsen Music&#x27;s year-end report for 2019, &quot;Self Esteem&quot; was the sixth most-played song of the decade on mainstream rock radio with 131,000 spins. All of the songs in the top 10 were from the 1990s.

===DVD appearances===
The music video also appears on the &quot;Complete Music Video Collection&quot; DVD. It was released in 2005.

==Release history==
==Other appearances==
* On July 20, 2018, 311 released a &quot;reggaefied&quot; cover of the song, which 311&#x27;s lead singer Nick Hexum said is &quot;probably my favorite song of theirs.&quot; On the same day, The Offspring released a cover of 311&#x27;s &quot;Down&quot;. Those cover versions coincided with the beginning of their 2018 Never Ending Summer co-tour. 
* The song was covered by Steve &#x27;n&#x27; Seagulls in 2016.
* The song was released as downloadable content for the video game &quot;Rock Band&quot;, in the &quot;Offspring pack&quot; which was released on October 7, 2008, along with &quot;Gone Away&quot; and &quot;Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)&quot;. It also appears in &quot;SingStar Rocks!&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot; and &quot;The Darkness II&quot;. An upgraded version of the song was made available to download on March 1, 2011, for use in the &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm, and PRO mode which takes advantage of the use of a real guitar / bass guitar, along with standard MIDI-compatible electronic drum kits / keyboards in addition to up to three-part harmony vocals.

<doc id="1240021" wikidata="Q972264" url="?curid=1240021" title="Song for America">
<text>Song for America is the second studio album by American progressive rock band Kansas, released in 1975. The album was reissued in remastered format on CD in 2004. The 10-minute title track was edited down to three minutes for release as a single. The 45 R.P.M. edit resurfaced 29 years later as a bonus track on the remastered release, which provided improved sound as well as expanded liner notes, rare photos, and a live version of &quot;Down the Road&quot;.

== Reception ==
AllMusic, in a retrospective review, praised the &quot;intense energy&quot; of the album&#x27;s shorter songs, but contended that the longer songs require too much active listening to appreciate. They concluded that the album is &quot;a good (if not adolescent) recording for a group of this genre.&quot; Conversely, Gary Graff described the title track as &quot;one of prog-rock&#x27;s sonic gems,&quot; recommending the album to &quot;Those interested in Kansas at its most bombastic.&quot;

Steve Pettengill, writing for Sea of Tranquility webzine, describes the album as &quot;full tilt symphonic rock with none of the stadium rock numbers that would pop up on later albums. Comprising four lengthy intricate pieces and two very American style romps, Kansas&#x27; second album very admirably showcases the band&#x27;s trademark duality as proggers and rockers.&quot;

Ranking on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart with a peak of #57, &quot;Song for America&quot; would in the months subsequent to its February 1975 release sell approximately 250,000 units. Like all three of Kansas&#x27; first three album releases, &quot;Song for America&quot; attracted new commercial interest due to the platinum success of the band&#x27;s fourth and fifth studio albums: &quot;Leftoverture&quot; (1976) and &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; (1977). Reported as having sold between 300,000 and 400,000 units in January 1978, &quot;Song for America&quot; would be certified Gold for sales of 500,000 units in June 1980.

<doc id="1240030" wikidata="Q2072000" url="?curid=1240030" title="Three Card Poker">
<text>Three Card Poker is a casino table game based on poker. It was designed in 1994 by Derek Webb.

==History==
The casino variant of Three Card Poker was first created by Derek Webb in 1994 and patented in 1997. Webb&#x27;s goal was to create a version of poker that played with the speed of other table games. It was important to Webb that he got the correct mix of three important factors for any casino game: the game rules were easy to understand, the payouts were large enough to attract players, and the house edge was enough that casino owners would be interested in adopting the game.

Webb established a business called Prime Table Games to market the game in both the United States and United Kingdom. The British Casino Association, now known as the National Casino Industry Forum (NCiF) suggested that Webb gain some experience in the US first, since the UK had regulations against such a table game and his application was not strong enough to convince regulators to make significant changes to their rules and regulations for a new game.

The first to adopt the game was Barry Morris, Vice President of Grand Casino Gulfport in Mississippi, after Webb had unsuccessful sales pitches with casino owners in Reno, Las Vegas, and Atlantic City. A key aspect of Webb&#x27;s offer to Morris was to stand on the floor to train the dealers himself, as well as watch to make sure the game was being played correctly. United Kingdom gambling regulations were changed to allow the introduction of Three Card Poker in 2002.

Prime Table Games continued marketing Three Card Poker until 1999, when Shuffle Master acquired the rights to the game outside the British Isles. The sale was prompted by a lawsuit filed that year in US federal court by Mikohn Gaming, the then-owners of Caribbean stud poker, alleging patent infringement; Shuffle Master agreed to defend that litigation as part of the purchase. Subsequently, in 2007, Prime Table Games showed in a countersuit that the 1999 litigation was based on invalid patent claims; Mikohn (which had since been renamed as Progressive Gaming International Corporation PGIC) settled the suit by paying $20 million. Further, Prime Table Games filed suit against Shuffle Master in 2008 alleging in part that Shuffle Master had undisclosed knowledge that the PGIC claims were invalid prior to the 1999 purchase; that lawsuit was later settled for over $2 million.

==Rules==
Three Card Poker is played as heads-up between the player&#x27;s hand and the dealer&#x27;s hand. After all ante wagers are placed, three cards are dealt to each player and the dealer. Players have a choice to either fold or continue in the game by placing a &quot;play&quot; wager equal to their ante. Hands are then exposed and wagers resolved.

The dealer&#x27;s hand must be Queen high or better for the dealer hand to play. If the dealer does not play, then there is no action on play wagers and ante wagers are paid 1 to 1. If the dealer does play, the dealer and player hands are compared. If the player hand loses, both the ante and play wagers are lost. If the player hand wins, both the ante and play wagers are paid 1 to 1. If the hands are tied, then there is no action on either wager.

Additional optional bets are offered. The Pair Plus wager is a bet that the player&#x27;s hand will be a pair or better. The Pair Plus wager wins if the player has at least a pair of twos. The payoff applies regardless of the dealer&#x27;s hand, as the Pair Plus wager is not in competition against the dealer&#x27;s hand. Some casinos also offer an Ante Bonus, which is paid on the ante wager for a straight or better. The typical Ante Bonus paytable pays 5 to 1 for a straight flush, 4 to 1 for a three of a kind, and 1 to 1 for a straight. Like the Pair Plus wager, the Ante Bonus pays regardless of whether that hand beats the dealer&#x27;s hand.

===Hand ranks===

Probability of Queen high or better is 69.59%

These probabilities give three card poker a house edge of about 3.37% on the ante bet, depending on the rules and payouts of a particular game.

==Variations==
Some venues have added a wager called Prime in United Kingdom casinos and the game is known as Prime Three Card Poker. The Prime wager is optionally placed before cards are dealt and pays on the color of the player cards. If all three cards are the same color the payoff is 3 to 1. However, when included with the dealer hand if all six cards are the same color then the payoff is increased to 4 to 1.

Another variation is &quot;six card bonus&quot;, in which the players are given a payout based on the best five-card poker hand that can be made using any combination of the player&#x27;s three cards and the dealer&#x27;s three cards. Payoff ranges from 5 to 1 for three of a kind to 1000 to 1 for royal flush. Payoffs are paid regardless of whether any other bets pay.

<doc id="1240032" wikidata="Q35932" url="?curid=1240032" title="WWE Experience">
<text>WWE Experience is a syndicated American television program that was produced by WWE which mainly recaps events taking place on &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;. The show ran from May 2004 until September 2005 in the US, broadcasting 64 episodes domestically before its cancellation.

The show continued to run in international markets, with it being televised in Mexico as well as in Asian, European and in some African countries. The final episode of Experience aired in January 2020 internationally, and the show was cancelled.

==History==
The show was originally broadcast by Spike TV and was aired Sunday mornings at 10 A.M. The original hosts were Todd Grisham and Ivory, with the setting of the show being outdoors and usually around New York City. The PG-rated show was aimed at younger viewers and it summarized the events of &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;Smackdown&quot;. The program marked the return of WWE programming to Sunday mornings since the cancellation of &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot; in August 2001.

When WWE programming moved to the USA Network during September 2005, &quot;WWE Experience&quot; was cancelled in America to later be replaced with &quot;AM Raw&quot;, but the show continued to be produced for overseas audiences. The filming was moved to the WWE studios in Stamford, Connecticut following reports that Grisham hated to film in the rain. Ivory was released from WWE a few weeks before the cancellation of the show in the United States. In July 2006, Todd Grisham was replaced as host by Josh Mathews, and no clear reason for Grisham&#x27;s replacement was confirmed despite Mathews reportedly saying, &quot;No reason, Todd&#x27;s gone, [Josh is] here, deal with it&quot;. After Josh Mathews became a commentator on &quot;ECW&quot;, he was replaced by Jack Korpela. In November 2011, following Korpela&#x27;s departure from the WWE, he was replaced by Matt Striker. In late 2012, Striker welcomed Renee Young as co-host, and following Striker leaving the WWE in early 2013, Young remained as the sole presenter of the show until she was replaced by Kyle Edwards. When Edwards was released in April 2016 he was replaced by Cathy Kelley who was temporarily joined by Corey Graves soon after.

Experience aired its final episode on the first weekend of January 2020. It was confirmed in a tweet by its host Scott Stanford that production would cease on the show, and no further episodes would air.

The WWE has maintained the Experience trademark after its cancellation. As part of its long term agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the WWE opened its first WWE Experience exhibition in Riyadh on February 16, 2024 during the 2023–24 Riyadh Season.

===Canada===
There was also a different version of the show that aired on the Canadian sports network Sportsnet 360 (previously known as The Score). It mainly recapped &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;. Previously hosted by network personalities rather than WWE employees, the Canadian version was most recently hosted by Scott Stanford and Alyse Zwick, while past hosts have included Ryan Paton, Glenn Schiiler, Derek Snider, Greg Sansone, and Arda Ocal (who later hosted the American version of the show under the name Kyle Edwards). The program first aired on Sunday, October 8, 2006, and in January 2020 was replaced by This Week in WWE.

===Puerto Rico===
Puerto Rico hosts their own version of the show that airs Sundays at 1pm on free-to-air WAPA-TV, with the show being hosted by WWE&#x27;s Spanish broadcaster Marcelo Rodriguez. The show is part of the WWE Weekend programing of the network that features the Spanish broadcast of &quot;SmackDown&quot; on Saturdays at 1pm and &quot;Experience&quot; on Sundays.

===Malaysia===
Malaysia had their own version of the show hosted by Zawen. It aired on Astro Ria, which is hosted by Malaysia&#x27;s satellite provider, Astro Malaysia. The show began airing early 2009, before being cancelled after 10 months on the air.

<doc id="1240035" wikidata="Q2628424" url="?curid=1240035" title="Masque (Kansas album)">
<text>Masque is the third studio album by American progressive rock band Kansas. The album was released in September 1975, remastered for CD in 2001, and again remastered and reissued on vinyl in 2014. The opening track, &quot;It Takes a Woman&#x27;s Love (To Make a Man)&quot;, was remixed for release as a single, including additional guest vocals and segments far different from the album version, but was not popular. The album includes both songs in the epic progressive rock style which Kansas favored and songs which took the heartland rock elements of their sound in a pop-oriented direction, foreshadowing their next album &quot;Leftoverture&quot;, on which those two approaches were more integrated.

&quot;Masque&quot; peaked at #70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, and approximately 250,000 units were sold within months. Like all three of Kansas&#x27; first three album releases, &quot;Masque&quot; attracted new commercial interest due to the platinum success of the band&#x27;s fourth and fifth studio albums (&quot;Leftoverture&quot; and &quot;Point of Know Return&quot;), being certified Gold for sales of 500,000 units in December 1977.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Masque&quot; was written and recorded at a time when Kansas were unsure of their band identity. Guitarist/Keyboardist Kerry Livgren commented, &quot;There&#x27;s the really progressive side of the band and then on the other end of the spectrum there&#x27;s something like &#x27;It Takes a Woman&#x27;s Love&#x27;. You put those on the same album, and it&#x27;s like &#x27;Who are these guys?&#x27; We wondered that too.&quot; &quot;It Takes a Woman&#x27;s Love&quot; was written specifically to appease record label owner Don Kirshner&#x27;s demands for the band to produce a song with the potential to be a hit single.

The sessions were produced by longtime Kansas associate Jeff Glixman (&quot;Masque&quot; was the first Kansas album produced solely by him) and held at Studio in the Country. The brand new studio was described by drummer Phil Ehart as &quot;way out in the bayous&quot;, and during recording sessions alligators and armadillos wandered into the studio. Relations between the band members were strong, and they commented in later years that the struggle to make Kansas a success forged a tight bond between them.

Neither of the two bonus tracks on the 2001 CD reissue were taken from the &quot;Masque&quot; sessions; they were included because they are early recordings of songs which later appeared on &quot;Masque&quot;. Specifically, the bonus cut of &quot;Child of Innocence&quot; was recorded at a band rehearsal in Topeka, Kansas, and the bonus cut of &quot;It&#x27;s You&quot; was recorded at a studio in Tulsa, Oklahoma as part of a studio session that was not for a specific album.

==Reception==
In a retrospective review, Bret Adams of &quot;Allmusic&quot; said that &quot;Masque&quot; &quot;foreshadows the tight melodies and instrumental interplay on the next two albums, &quot;Leftoverture&quot; and &quot;Point of Know Return&quot;, which together serve as the peak of Kansas&#x27;s vision.&quot; He remarked that Robby Steinhardt&#x27;s violin work stood as distinctive from other progressive rock violinists, and praised the bleak lyrics and combination of satisfying rock with dense progressive arrangements on individual songs such as &quot;Two Cents Worth&quot;, &quot;Icarus - Borne on Wings of Steel&quot;, and &quot;Mysteries and Mayhem&quot;.

<doc id="1240036" wikidata="Q5014301" url="?curid=1240036" title="CSS Georgia (1862)">
<text>CSS Georgia was a screw steamer of the Confederate States Navy, acquired in 1863, and captured by the Union Navy in 1864.

==Construction==
The ship was built in 1862 as the fast merchantman &quot;Japan&quot;. She had a round stern, iron frame, fiddle-bow figurehead, short, thick funnel and full poop. Having an iron hull, she was clearly unsuited to long cruises without drydocking during a period when antifouling under-body coatings were yet unknown. Commander James Dunwoody Bulloch, a key Confederate procurement agent overseas, would have nothing to do with iron bottoms, but Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury settled for &quot;Japan&quot; because wood (which could be coppered) was being superseded in Great Britain by the new metal; consequently wooden newbuilding contracts were not easy to buy up in British shipyards.

==Service history==
===Confederate States Navy===
The Confederate States Government purchased her at Dumbarton, Scotland, in March 1863. On 1 April 1863, she departed Greenock, reputedly bound for the East Indies and carrying a crew of fifty who had shipped for a voyage to Singapore. She rendezvoused with the steamer &quot;Alar&quot; off Ushant, France, and took on guns, ordnance and other stores. On 9 April 1863 the Confederate flag was hoisted and she was placed in commission as CSS &quot;Georgia&quot;, Commander William Lewis Maury, CSN, in command. Her orders read to prey against United States shipping wherever found.

Calling at Bahia, Brazil and at Trinidad, &quot;Georgia&quot; recrossed the Atlantic Ocean to Simon&#x27;s Bay, Cape Colony, Africa, where she arrived on 16 August 1863. She sailed next to Santa Cruz, Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, thence up to Cherbourg, France, arriving 28 October 1863. During this short cruise she captured nine prizes.

While &quot;Georgia&quot; was undergoing repairs at Cherbourg in late January 1864, it was decided to shift her armament to . The transfer was never effected, however, and &quot;Georgia&quot; was moved to an anchorage below Bordeaux, France. On 2 May 1864 she was taken to Liverpool and sold on 1 June 1864 to a merchant of that city over the protest of Charles Francis Adams, Sr., United States Minister to Great Britain. The steamer again put to sea on 11 August 1864, and on 15 August 1864 was captured by the United States Navy frigate off Portugal. She was sent into Boston, Massachusetts, where she was condemned and sold as a lawful prize of the United States.

===Merchant ship===

The ship was documented as the U.S. merchant ship SS &quot;Georgia&quot; in New Bedford, Massachusetts, on 5 August 1865. She was reregistered in Canada in 1870. The property of the Quebec and Gulf Ports Company and still named SS &quot;Georgia&quot;, she was on a voyage from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Portland, Maine, when she was wrecked without loss of life on the Northern Triangles, a reef in Penobscot Bay off the coast of Maine, at on 14 January 1875 while steaming at night in a snowstorm.

<doc id="1240039" wikidata="Q5046235" url="?curid=1240039" title="Carrie Fulton Phillips">
<text>Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; Phillips (née Fulton; September 22, 1873 – February 3, 1960) was a mistress of Warren G. Harding, until shortly before he became the 29th President of the United States. The young Carrie Fulton was known by admirers to have epitomized the Gibson Girl portrait of beauty, a look popular at the turn of the 20th century. Her relationship with Senator Warren G. Harding was kept secret from the public during its time and for decades thereafter. The affair ended when Phillips blackmailed Harding during the Senator&#x27;s run for office for President of the United States.

Phillips was the first woman known to have successfully blackmailed a president of the United States.

==Early life==
Born September 22, 1873, in Dayton, Ohio, Phillips was the only daughter of Matthew Henry Fulton (1840–1906) and his wife Kate M. Swingly (1851 – after 1873). She had five younger brothers: George Fred, Percy Matthew, James Edward, Thomas Durman, and Chester Courtney Fulton. She was raised by her parents in Bucyrus, Ohio, where her father was a telegraph operator.

Her paternal grandfather, George Washington Fulton (1802–1864), was a successful businessman and engineer active in developing the town of New Brighton, Pennsylvania. George married Mary Ann Kennedy (1812–1887), a sister of Matthew T. Kennedy (1804–1884) and Samuel Kennedy (1810–1886), brothers who established the Kennedy Keg Works first at Fallston, Pennsylvania (1836), and later opened a second operation in New Brighton (1876). George was successful in various ventures, from lumber to real estate, some in connection with his brothers-in-law, with his family reaping the advantages of his success in wealth, comfort, and education.

Carrie married James Phillips in 1896, and the couple moved to Marion where Phillips was co-proprietor of the Uhler-Phillips Company, one of Marion&#x27;s leading dry goods establishments. The couple quickly established themselves as active members of the local society, in large part due to Phillips’ charm and beauty. Among Phillips&#x27;s friends and confidants was Florence Harding, wife of the owner and publisher of the city&#x27;s leading newspaper, &quot;The Marion Star&quot;.

==Affair with Warren G. Harding==
James and Carrie had two children, daughter Isabelle (1897–1968) and son James, Jr. (1899–1901). The boy died as a toddler, and, during this time of grief Mrs. Phillips and Warren Harding grew close, despite their respective marriages and friendships. The Phillipses and the Hardings undertook tours of Europe together, all while Phillips and Harding carried on their intimate relationship.

After the affair came to light, Florence Harding, Warren&#x27;s wife, was furious. She claimed that this was not the first time that her husband had entered into an affair with a woman whom she considered a friend. To separate the two lovers and allow time for the respective marriages to be reconciled, the Phillips family returned to Europe, leaving the Hardings in Marion. While in Germany, Mrs. Phillips became immersed in German culture. She chose to stay in Germany and enrolled their daughter in school there. James Phillips returned to the United States alone.

While Mrs. Phillips was in Europe, Harding ran for the United States Senate. As Europe moved closer to the brink of war, Phillips returned to the United States. Her passion for Germany was very well known. Upon returning to Marion, Phillips&#x27; affair with Harding reignited. Phillips reportedly threatened to expose the affair if Harding voted in favor of war with Germany.

In mid-1920, immediately following his acceptance of the Republican Party nomination, Harding disclosed his affair with Mrs. Phillips to Republican Party officials, also disclosing that Phillips was in the possession of hundreds of love letters he had written to her, many on Senate stationery. Reportedly wary of a scandal involving an affair as well as Phillips&#x27; support of the German government, the Republican Party urged Mr. and Mrs. Phillips to keep their travels abroad a private matter. Mrs. Phillips responded by dictating terms under which she would consider the party&#x27;s wishes. In return for Phillips&#x27; silence on the matter, the Republican Party offered to pay the way for an extended tour of Asia and the Pacific Islands, as well as an annual stipend to Phillips for the remainder of her life.

==After the affair==
After Mrs. Harding&#x27;s death, Mrs. Phillips relocated to Germany. Mr. Phillips died on July 3, 1939, at the age of 73, from heart disease.

Carrie Fulton Phillips died on February 3, 1960, at the age of 86. She was buried in Marion Cemetery, next to her husband and infant son. Their daughter Isabelle and her husband William Helmuth Mathee are also buried in the family plot. Isabelle and Mathee had a son, also named William Helmuth Mathee (1920–1988). 

Following Phillips&#x27; death, the love letters to Warren Harding became the centerpiece of a court battle that pitted Phillips’ daughter, Isabelle Phillips Mathee, against nephews of Warren G. Harding. In a subsequent legal action, Isabelle Mathee joined the Hardings and received a temporary injunction that prevented historian Francis Russell&#x27;s inclusion of the material in his 1968 book, &quot;The Shadow of Blooming Grove&quot;. Ultimately, the court ruled the letters would be sealed until July 2014, at which time their contents would be made public.

The Library of Congress publicly opened the letters between Phillips and Harding on July 29, 2014. The original material is held in the Library of Congress, with copies held at Ohio Historical Society.

==Love letters==

In 1964, about 1,000 pages of love letters written by Harding to Phillips between 1910 and 1920 were discovered. The letters were written while Harding was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio and subsequently as a sitting US senator. Upon discovery, the letters were sealed and handed over to the Library of Congress on condition that they not be released to the general public for 50 years. On July 29, 2014, 1000 pages of the Harding-Phillips love letters became public. In 2009, the historian and lawyer James Robenalt published a smaller collection of letters, based on microfilm copies located in Cleveland’s Western Reserve Historical Society. This collection has been reproduced in Robenalt’s book, &quot;The Harding Affair: Love and Espionage During the Great War&quot;.

<text>Saviour Machine is an American Christian gothic metal band that formed in 1989. They have released five studio albums and two live albums on Frontline and subsequently on MCM Music, distributed through Massacre Records. Saviour Machine&#x27;s music and lyrics deal with war, death, and personal introspection as it relates to prophecy and divine revelation.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1989–1993)===
The band was formed by brothers Jeff and Eric Clayton in mid-1989. By the time of its first tour in 1993, the band was Eric Clayton – vocals, Jeff Clayton – guitars, Dean Forsyth – bass, Jayson Heart – drums, and Nathan Van Hala – keyboards. The band took its name from a song on the David Bowie album &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;. 
===The &quot;Legend&quot; trilogy (1997–2007)===
Saviour Machine next turned to the &quot;Legend&quot; trilogy. &quot;Legend&quot; was advertised as &quot;the unofficial soundtrack to the end of the world&quot; in promotional materials owing to its study of end-time Biblical prophecy. The &quot;Legend&quot; trilogy comprises four full-length CDs totaling more than five hours of music. &quot;Legend I&quot; and &quot;Legend II&quot; were released in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The studio composition of the band stayed the same through &quot;Legend II&quot; after which Jeff Clayton and Jayson Heart left the band. &quot;Legend III:I&quot; was released in 2001. The long-awaited final disc, &quot;Legend III:II&quot;, was scheduled to be released July 7, 2007. &quot;Legend&quot; parts &quot;I&quot; through &quot;III:I&quot; were released by MCM Music and Massacre Records; however, &quot;Legend III:II&quot; was released independently. On May 27, 2007, Eric Clayton released a statement on the Saviour Machine MySpace blog saying that, due to health problems, he would not be able to finish &quot;Legend III:II&quot; in time to make the July 7 release date. He released samples of rough mixes of each song on &quot;Legend III:II&quot; on SeventhCircle.net throughout July.

Most of the lyrical content of the &quot;Legend&quot; series is based on the Book of Revelation and other Biblical prophecy. The first album draws from the Old Testament and New Testament, except the Book of Revelation, and include biblical references and a concordance. &quot;Legend II&quot; continues where part one ended - the rise of the antichrist. Musically, the &quot;Legend&quot; albums showcase a further refinement of Saviour Machine&#x27;s rock and classical music style.

Saviour Machine has performed a limited number of concerts in the US, Germany and Mexico City since undertaking the &quot;Legend&quot; trilogy. A second live album was released in 2002, again featuring a performance from Owen Teck Rocknight in Owen, Germany. &quot;Live in Deutschland 2002&quot; featured selections from &quot;Legend I&quot;, &quot;Legend II&quot; and &quot;Legend III:I&quot;.

=== Re-union and plan for new release (2017–present) ===

According to an interview with Eric Clayton during Wacken Open Air 2017 as well as statements on the Facebook page and YouTube channel of the band, they are working on a new album to be released in the future. It will not be part of the Legend-trilogy, but follow the first two releases of the band.

<text>Koro Tainui Wētere (22 June 1935 – 23 June 2018) was a New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1969 to 1996, representing the Labour Party. He served as Minister of Māori Affairs in the Fourth Labour Government (1984–1990).

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Born at Oparure, near Te Kūiti, on 22 June 1935, Wētere was the son of Weo Maruatara Wētere and Te Aorangi Wētere (née Eketone), and affiliated to the Ngāti Maniapoto iwi. He was educated at Te Kūiti High School and Massey University, and was ordained a minister (āpotoro rēhita or registered apostle) of the Rātana Church, serving as parish minister for Oparure, Te Kūiti and Piopio in the 1960s.

In 1960, Wētere married Nedracita Takuora Edwards, and the couple went on to have five children.

===Member of Parliament===



Wētere joined the Labour Party in 1957, and was first elected to Parliament in the 1969 election as MP for the Western Maori electorate, one of the four Māori electorates in New Zealand&#x27;s House of Representatives. Given Labour&#x27;s traditional dominance in the Māori electorates, Wētere held his position without difficulty until his retirement at the 1996 election. In 1976 he was promoted by Labour leader Bill Rowling and made Shadow Minister of Forests. Three years later he was given the Maori Affairs and Lands portfolios instead.

===Cabinet minister===
Wētere became Minister of Māori Affairs when the Labour Party won the 1984 election, serving in that role until 1990. He also served as Minister of Lands, Minister of Forestry, and the Minister in charge of the Valuation Department between 1984 and 1987, and the Minister in charge of the Iwi Transition Agency between 1989 and 1990.

Wētere was criticised during the Māori loan affair of 1985–86, and was nearly asked to resign. Tamati Reedy, the head of Wētere&#x27;s department, Te Puni Kokiri, attempted to arrange an unauthorised overseas loan for Māori businesses. Wētere was the subject of strong attacks over the issue by National Party MP Winston Peters, but denied any wrongdoing. In 1990 Wētere refused to translate his addresses to parliament into English, having given them in Māori. This was one of a number of steps which pushed the issue of the use of Māori in public life during this time. There are now arrangements for simultaneous interpretation between English and Māori in Parliament.

When Labour lost power in the 1990 election, Wētere returned to opposition for two terms before retiring from politics. He was Shadow Minister of Maori Affairs from 1990 to 1996 under Mike Moore and later Helen Clark. Never a supporter of Clark, Wētere was one of several frontbenchers who was part of a delegation met with Clark in her office prior to a caucus meeting in 1996 persuading her to stand down and informing her (in a ruse) that they had the numbers to oust her as leader (in favour of Phil Goff) if she refused. Clark defied Goff and his supporters, and ultimately remained leader.

===Death===
Wētere died in Te Kūiti on 23 June 2018, one day after his 83rd birthday.

==Honours==
Wētere was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, and the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1996 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the Māori people.

The University of Waikato awarded Wētere an honorary doctorate for his contributions to the well-being and the advancement of Māori affairs in Aotearoa in 1999, and a lifetime achievement award, Te Tohu Whakamaharatanga ki Te Arikinui Te Atairangikaahu, in 2008.

==Personal life==
Wētere suffered from gout. In 2001, Wētere was convicted of drink driving.

<doc id="1240069" wikidata="Q565487" url="?curid=1240069" title="Leftoverture">
<text>Leftoverture is the fourth studio album by American rock band Kansas, released in 1976. The album was reissued in remastered format on CD in 2001. It was the band&#x27;s first album to be certified by the RIAA, and remains their highest selling album, having been certified 5 times platinum in the United States.

== Background ==
Steve Walsh began to experience writer&#x27;s block prior to the recording, and his contribution to the album would ultimately be limited to co-authoring three songs; it fell on Kerry Livgren to fill the void. The new compositions retained much of the classically inspired complexity of Livgren&#x27;s previous work. As with their previous album, &quot;Masque&quot;, Kansas recorded &quot;Leftoverture&quot; at Studio in the Country in Bogalusa, Louisiana. The Studio in the Country was so named because, as Livgren described on &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; radio show in the episode spotlighting &quot;Leftoverture&quot;, &quot;it was in the middle of a swamp. We&#x27;d walk out of the studio and there would be gators in front of the studio, mosquitos the size of B-52s and at times armadillos would run into the control room.&quot;

&quot;Leftoverture&quot; opens with the song &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;, which Livgren wrote as a sequel to &quot;The Pinnacle&quot;, the final song from the previous album &quot;Masque&quot; (1975).

The album&#x27;s title, &quot;Leftoverture&quot;, is a portmanteau of &quot;leftover&quot; and &quot;overture&quot;.

== Reception ==
The album was met with mixed reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Leftoverture&quot; Kansas&#x27;s best album to date, and said that it &quot;warrants Kansas a spot right alongside Boston and Styx as one of the fresh new American bands who combine hard-driving group instrumentation (with a dearth of flashy solos) with short, tight melody lines and pleasant singing.&quot; The magazine &quot;Playboy&quot; reviewed the album as &quot;extremely strong&quot; and lauded Kansas for representing &quot;the solid, Midwestern values of our vast musical heartland.&quot; In contrast, Robert Christgau said the album lacked the intelligence and conviction of European progressive rock, and that the self-deprecating humor implied in the song and album titles is completely absent from the record itself.

More recently, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the album contains &quot;neither hooks nor true grandiosity to make it interesting&quot; and, despite the great single &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;, the fact that Kansas &quot;never manage to rival it anywhere on this record is as much a testament to their crippling ambition as their lack of skills.&quot; Gary Graff was more enthusiastic, finding &quot;Leftoverture&quot; to be &quot;Kansas&#x27; breakthrough album and a thorough representation of its assorted musical sensibilities.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Matt Wardlaw considered &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;, &quot;Magnum Opus&quot;, &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s on My Mind&quot; and &quot;Opus Insert&quot; to be classics. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Eduardo Rivadavia rated &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; as Kansas&#x27; greatest song and &quot;The Wall&quot; as Kansas&#x27; sixth greatest song. 

&quot;Classic Rock History&quot; critic Brian Kachejian rated &quot;The Wall&quot; as Kansas&#x27; all-time best song, as well as rating &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; number 2 and &quot;Miracles Out of Nowhere&quot; number 5. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; critic Dave Ling also ranked three songs from &quot;Leftoverture&quot; among Kansas&#x27; 10 best – &quot;Magnum Opus&quot;, &quot;Miracles Out of Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;.

Ronnie Platt, who became Kansas&#x27; lead singer in 2014, rated three songs from &quot;Leftoverture&quot; as being among his 10 favorite Kansas songs – &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;, &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;Miracles Out of Nowhere&quot;.

<doc id="1240091" wikidata="Q6693210" url="?curid=1240091" title="Lowell Green">
<text>Lowell Green (born 7 July 1936) is a Canadian radio personality, journalist, and author, best known as the host of &quot;The Lowell Green Show&quot;, a conservative morning talk show that aired on the Ottawa Ontario radio station CFRA. He has written newspaper articles and autobiographical, historical and fictional books.

He was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States, to Canadian parents, and immigrated to Canada. He graduated from Macdonald Agricultural College of McGill University in Montreal Quebec in 1956.

== Career ==
Green started his radio broadcasting career in Brantford, Ontario, and subsequently moved to radio stations in Sudbury Ontario and Montreal Quebec. In 1960, he was hired by G. Campbell McDonald at CFRA as a news and farm reporter. In 1966, he began hosting &quot;Greenline&quot;, and eventually became the longest-running open-line talk show host in North America. He retired briefly from radio in the 1980s, but returned in 1990. Two of his historic broadcasts are being preserved at Library and Archives Canada.

In 1993, he returned to CFRA and hosted &quot;The Lowell Green Show&quot; until his official retirement on 4 January 2016. He continued contributing to the station&#x27;s weekly &quot;midday program News and Views with Rob Snow&quot; until a Bell Media restructuring in mid-November 2019. On occasion, he can be heard calling into &quot;The Rob Snow Show&quot;, now airing on CIWW.

On 31 December 2019, in an emotional farewell, Green ended his radio career on CFRA with the following final words:“&quot;I believe, that we all have a responsibility, more than that, we have a duty, to do whatever we can, in whatever fashion we can, to make a better world for our children. And CFRA Nation, you have done your duty, and I hope and pray that you&#x27;ll continue to do so. Thank you all, goodbye&quot;.”On 14 September 2020, Green returned online with The Island of Sanity, a one-hour podcast available on various internet platforms, which was pared down to thirty minutes on 13 October 2020 and featured live on internet radio and the social networking platform Facebook.

== Accomplishments ==
In a late 1960s protest, Green urged his listeners to fill bottles of water taken from the polluted Rideau River, and to ship them to the Ontario legislature at Queen&#x27;s Park. His listeners shipped many bottles and containers of polluted water. Canada Post objected, and stopped accepting them. According to Green, the uproar led to the creation of the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority and the start of a clean-up effort of the Rideau River and the Ottawa River.

With his 1967 S&quot;ave The Centennial Flame&quot; Campaign, a month of relentless broadcasts, and over three-thousand petitions from listeners, the iconic Centennial Flame remains and continues to shine on Parliament Hill.

In 1975, after the school shooting that occurred at the St. Pius X High School in Ottawa, Green and thousands of his supporters joined his &quot;Fire Arms Safety Association&quot;. It lobbied and petitioned Members of Parliament, while he appeared before parliamentary and senate committees tasked with the process of making policy and enacting new gun law legislation in Canada. In order to encourage Quebecers to vote &quot;No&quot; in the 1995 Quebec Independence referendum, he promoted and helped organize a political &quot;Unity Rally&quot; which was held in Place du Canada in Montreal Quebec.

With the Reverend Norman Johnston, he founded the Ottawa chapter of the &quot;Big Brothers&quot; and was founder of the &quot;Help Santa Toy Parade&quot; in Ottawa. He has contributed to ongoing efforts to help modernize and renovate the &quot;Saint Vincent Hospital&quot; and the &quot;Élisabeth Bruyère Hospital&quot; in Ottawa. He was a founder of the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; in Ottawa which was in 1988 purchased by the Ottawa Sun.

Green has served on the boards of the &quot;United Way&quot;, the &quot;John Howard Society&quot;, the &quot;Drug Addiction Research Council&quot;, and on the town council in West Hull Quebec.

== Honours and awards ==
Lowell Green has received several awards, including one for his 1958 coverage of the Springhill mining disaster in Nova Scotia, and one from the International Olympic Commission for broadcasts made from the 1976 Summer Olympic Games while working in Montreal. He has received the &quot;Friendship Award&quot; from the Royal Canadian Legion, the Chief of Defence staff medallion, and the &quot;Senate 150th Anniversary Medal&quot;. He has been decorated with both the &quot;Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal&quot;, and the &quot;Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal&quot;.

After raising CA$280 thousand during an on-air campaign for a little boy requiring life-saving medical treatment in the United States, he was presented with the &quot;Helen Keller Fellowship Award&quot; from Lions International. In 2006, he was awarded the &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; from the Radio and Television News Director Association. He has also been awarded the &quot;Golden Ribbon Award For Outstanding Community Service&quot; by the Canadian Association of Broadcasters.

He has received citations from Prime Minister John Diefendbaker, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper. On 21 November 2017, he was honoured in the House of Commons of Canada by the Honourable Pierre Poilievre. Lowell Green has also received the &quot;Community Builders Award&quot; displayed at Ottawa City Hall, and has an Ottawa hospital wing and an Ottawa day named in his honour.

== Politics ==
In 1968, Green attempted to win the Liberal nomination for the federal riding of Pontiac during the 1968 federal election, but lost this bid to Thomas Lefebvre. On 13 December 1984, Green ran for the Ontario Liberal Party in a provincial by-election in Ottawa Centre. The by-election was called after NDP Michael Cassidy resigned his seat. He came third, losing to NDP candidate Evelyn Gigantes. Green blamed this loss on his &quot;sharp&quot; personality and a low voter turnout. On 24 October 2020, Green publicly endorsed Matthew Fisher, a former journalist who was a foreign correspondent for The Globe and Mail, Sun Media and Postmedia Network for 34 years, to become the Conservative MP for Kanata—Carleton.

==Books==
The following is a list of works authored by Lowell Green. His latest book “&quot;Amazing But True! 150 Fascinating Stories About Canada&quot;”, was in 2017 nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Pierre Burton Award, presented annually by Canada&#x27;s National History Society for works celebrating Canadian history. He has also received the Canada Book Award which recognizes and promotes Canadian authors.

== Controversy ==
Green has been controversial at times. Several complaints have been made against him to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green&#x27;s conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam. In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether Indigo Books and Music had pulled Green&#x27;s latest book, &quot;Amazing But True!&quot;, from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.

<doc id="1240093" wikidata="Q5347246" url="?curid=1240093" title="Effective action">
<text>In quantum field theory, the quantum effective action is a modified expression for the classical action taking into account quantum corrections while ensuring that the principle of least action applies, meaning that extremizing the effective action yields the equations of motion for the vacuum expectation values of the quantum fields. The effective action also acts as a generating functional for one-particle irreducible correlation functions. The potential component of the effective action is called the effective potential, with the expectation value of the true vacuum being the minimum of this potential rather than the classical potential, making it important for studying spontaneous symmetry breaking.

It was first defined perturbatively by Jeffrey Goldstone and Steven Weinberg in 1962, while the non-perturbative definition was introduced by Bryce DeWitt in 1963 and independently by Giovanni Jona-Lasinio in 1964.

The article describes the effective action for a single scalar field, however, similar results exist for multiple scalar or fermionic fields.

== Generating functionals ==

&quot;These generating functionals also have applications in statistical mechanics and information theory, with slightly different factors of formula_1 and sign conventions.&quot;

A quantum field theory with action formula_2 can be fully described in the path integral formalism using the partition functional

:formula_3

Since it corresponds to vacuum-to-vacuum transitions in the presence of a classical external current formula_4, it can be evaluated perturbatively as the sum of all connected and disconnected Feynman diagrams. It is also the generating functional for correlation functions

:formula_5

where the scalar field operators are denoted by formula_6. One can define another useful generating functional formula_7 responsible for generating connected correlation functions 

:formula_8

which is calculated perturbatively as the sum of all connected diagrams. Here connected is interpreted in the sense of the cluster decomposition, meaning that the correlation functions approach zero at large spacelike separations. General correlation functions can always be written as a sum of products of connected correlation functions.

The quantum effective action is defined using the Legendre transformation of formula_9

where formula_10 is the source current for which the scalar field has the expectation value formula_11, often called the classical field, defined implicitly as the solution to
:formula_12

As an expectation value, the classical field can be thought of as the weighted average over quantum fluctuations in the presence of a current formula_4 that sources the scalar field. Taking the functional derivative of the Legendre transformation with respect to formula_11 yields

:formula_15

In the absence of an source formula_16, the above shows that the vacuum expectation value of the fields extremize the quantum effective action rather than the classical action. This is nothing more than the principle of least action in the full quantum field theory. The reason for why the quantum theory requires this modification comes from the path integral perspective since all possible field configurations contribute to the path integral, while in classical field theory only the classical configurations contribute. 

The effective action is also the generating functional for one-particle irreducible (1PI) correlation functions. 1PI diagrams are connected graphs that cannot be disconnected into two pieces by cutting a single internal line. Therefore, we have

:formula_17

with formula_18 being the sum of all 1PI Feynman diagrams. The close connection between formula_9 and formula_18 means that there are a number of very useful relations between their correlation functions. For example, the two-point correlation function, which is nothing less than the propagator formula_21, is the inverse of the 1PI two-point correlation function

:formula_22

==Methods for calculating the effective action==

A direct way to calculate the effective action formula_23 perturbatively as a sum of 1PI diagrams is to sum over all 1PI vacuum diagrams acquired using the Feynman rules derived from the shifted action formula_24. This works because any place where formula_25 appears in any of the propagators or vertices is a place where an external formula_26 line could be attached. This is very similar to the background field method which can also be used to calculate the effective action.

Alternatively, the one-loop approximation to the action can be found by considering the expansion of the partition function around the classical vacuum expectation value field configuration formula_27, yielding

:formula_28

==Symmetries==

Symmetries of the classical action formula_2 are not automatically symmetries of the quantum effective action formula_18. If the classical action has a continuous symmetry depending on some functional formula_31

:formula_32

then this directly imposes the constraint

:formula_33

This identity is an example of a Slavnov–Taylor identity. It is identical to the requirement that the effective action is invariant under the symmetry transformation

:formula_34

This symmetry is identical to the original symmetry for the important class of linear symmetries 

:formula_35

For non-linear functionals the two symmetries generally differ because the average of a non-linear functional is not equivalent to the functional of an average.

==Convexity==

For a spacetime with volume formula_36, the effective potential is defined as formula_37. With a Hamiltonian formula_38, the effective potential formula_39 at formula_11 always gives the minimum of the expectation value of the energy density formula_41 for the set of states formula_42 satisfying formula_43. This definition over multiple states is necessary because multiple different states, each of which corresponds to a particular source current, may result in the same expectation value. It can further be shown that the effective potential is necessarily a convex function formula_44.

Calculating the effective potential perturbatively can sometimes yield a non-convex result, such as a potential that has two local minima. However, the true effective potential is still convex, becoming approximately linear in the region where the apparent effective potential fails to be convex. The contradiction occurs in calculations around unstable vacua since perturbation theory necessarily assumes that the vacuum is stable. For example, consider an apparent effective potential formula_45 with two local minima whose expectation values formula_46 and formula_47 are the expectation values for the states formula_48 and formula_49, respectively. Then any formula_26 in the non-convex region of formula_45 can also be acquired for some formula_52 using

:formula_53

However, the energy density of this state is formula_54 meaning formula_45 cannot be the correct effective potential at formula_26 since it did not minimize the energy density. Rather the true effective potential formula_39 is equal to or lower than this linear construction, which restores convexity.

<doc id="1240097" wikidata="Q7317034" url="?curid=1240097" title="Retrograde signaling">
<text>Retrograde signaling in biology is the process where a signal travels backwards from a target source to its original source. For example, the nucleus of a cell is the original source for creating signaling proteins. During retrograde signaling, instead of signals leaving the nucleus, they are sent to the nucleus. In cell biology, this type of signaling typically occurs between the mitochondria or chloroplast and the nucleus. Signaling molecules from the mitochondria or chloroplast act on the nucleus to affect nuclear gene expression. In this regard, the chloroplast or mitochondria act as a sensor for internal external stimuli which activate a signaling pathway.

In neuroscience, retrograde signaling (or retrograde neurotransmission) refers more specifically to the process by which a retrograde messenger, such as anandamide or nitric oxide, is released by a postsynaptic dendrite or cell body, and travels &quot;backwards&quot; across a chemical synapse to bind to the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron.

==In cell biology==
Retrograde signals are transmitted from plastids to the nucleus in plants and eukaryotic algae, and from mitochondria to the nucleus in most eukaryotes. Retrograde signals are generally considered to convey intracellular signals related to stress and environmental sensing. Many of the molecules associated with retrograde signaling act on modifying the transcription or by directly binding and acting as a transcription factor. The outcomes of these signaling pathways vary by organism and by stimuli or stress.

== Evolution ==
Retrograde signaling is believed to have arisen after endocytosis of the mitochondria and chloroplast billions of years ago. Originally believed to be photosynthetic bacteria, the mitochondria and chloroplast transferred some of their DNA to the membrane protected nucleus. Thus, some of the proteins required for the mitochondria or chloroplast are within the nucleus. This transfer of DNA further required a network of communication to properly respond to external and internal signals and produce requisite proteins.

=== In yeast ===
The first retrograde signaling pathways discovered in yeast is the RTG pathway. The RTG pathway plays an important role in maintaining the metabolic homeostasis of yeast. Under limited resources the mitochondria must maintain a balance of glutamate for the citric acid cycle. Retrograde signaling from the mitochondria initiates production precursor molecules of glutamate to properly balance supplies within the mitochondria. Retrograde signaling can also act to arrest growth if problems are encountered. In &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae,&quot; if the mitochondria fails to develop properly, they will stop growing until the issue is addressed or cell death is induced. These mechanism are vital to maintain homeostasis of the cell and ensure proper function of the mitochondria.

=== In plants ===
One of the most studied retrograde signaling molecules in plants are reactive oxygen species (ROS). These compounds, previously believed to be damaging to the cell, have since been discovered to act as a signaling molecule. Reactive oxygen species are created as a by-product of aerobic respiration and act on genes involved in the stress response. Depending on the stress, reactive oxygen species can act on neighboring cells to initiate a local signal. By doing this, surrounding cells are &quot;primed&quot; to react to the stress because genes involved in stress response are initiated prior to encountering the stress. The chloroplast can also act as a sensor for pathogen response and drought. Detection of these stresses in the cell will induce the formation of compounds that can then act on the nucleus to produce pathogen resistance genes or drought tolerance. 

==In neuroscience==

The primary purpose of retrograde neurotransmission is regulation of chemical neurotransmission. For this reason, retrograde neurotransmission allows neural circuits to create feedback loops. In the sense that retrograde neurotransmission mainly serves to regulate typical, anterograde neurotransmission, rather than to actually distribute any information, it is similar to electrical neurotransmission.

In contrast to conventional (anterograde) neurotransmitters, retrograde neurotransmitters are synthesized in the postsynaptic neuron, and bind to receptors on the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron. Additionally, retrograde signaling initiates a signaling cascade that focuses on the presynaptic neuron. Once retrograde signaling is initiated, there is an increase in action potentials that begin in the presynaptic neuron, which directly impacts the postsynaptic neuron by increasing the number of its receptors.

Endocannabinoids like anandamide are known to act as retrograde messengers, as is nitric oxide.

Retrograde signaling may also play a role in long-term potentiation (LTP), a proposed mechanism of learning and memory, although this is controversial.

===Formal definition of a retrograde neurotransmitter===
In 2009, Regehr &quot;et al.&quot; proposed criteria for defining retrograde neurotransmitters. According to their work, a signaling molecule can be considered a retrograde neurotransmitter if it satisfies all of the following criteria:

*The appropriate machinery for synthesizing and releasing the retrograde messenger must be located in the postsynaptic neuron
*Disrupting the synthesis and/or release of the messenger from the postsynaptic neuron must prevent retrograde signaling
*The appropriate targets for the retrograde messenger must be located in the presynaptic bouton
*Disrupting the targets for the retrograde messenger in the presynaptic boutons must eliminate retrograde signaling
*Exposing the presynaptic bouton to the messenger should mimic retrograde signaling provided the presence of the retrograde messenger is sufficient for retrograde signaling to occur
*In cases where the retrograde messenger is not sufficient, pairing the other factors with the retrograde signal should mimic the phenomenon

===Types of retrograde neurotransmitters===
The most prevalent endogenous retrograde neurotransmitters are nitric oxide and various endocannabinoids, which are lipophilic ligands.

The retrograde neurotransmitter, nitric oxide (NO) is a soluble gas that can readily diffuse through various cell membranes. Nitric oxide synthase is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of NO in various presynaptic cells. Specifically, NO is known to play a critical role in LTP, which plays an important role in memory storage within the hippocampus. Additionally, literature suggests that NO can act as intracellular messengers in the brain and can also have an effect on the presynaptic glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses.

Utilizing retrograde signaling, endocannabinoids, a type of retrograde neurotransmitter, are activated when they bind to G-protein coupled receptors on the presynaptic terminals of neurons. The activation of endocannabinoids results in the release of particular neurotransmitters at the excitatory and inhibitory synapses of a neuron, ultimately impacting various forms of plasticity.

===Retrograde signaling in long-term potentiation===

As it pertains to LTP, retrograde signaling is a hypothesis describing how events underlying LTP may begin in the postsynaptic neuron but be propagated to the presynaptic neuron, even though normal communication across a chemical synapse occurs in a presynaptic to postsynaptic direction. It is used most commonly by those who argue that presynaptic neurons contribute significantly to the expression of LTP.

====Background====
Long-term potentiation is the persistent increase in the strength of a chemical synapse that lasts from hours to days. It is thought to occur via two temporally separated events, with &quot;induction&quot; occurring first, followed by &quot;expression&quot;. Most LTP investigators agree that induction is entirely postsynaptic, whereas there is disagreement as to whether expression is principally a presynaptic or postsynaptic event. Some researchers believe that both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms play a role in LTP expression.

Were LTP entirely induced and expressed postsynaptically, there would be no need for the postsynaptic cell to communicate with the presynaptic cell following LTP induction. However, postsynaptic induction combined with &quot;presynaptic&quot; expression requires that, following induction, the postsynaptic cell must communicate with the presynaptic cell. Because normal synaptic transmission occurs in a presynaptic to postsynaptic direction, postsynaptic to presynaptic communication is considered a form of &quot;retrograde&quot; transmission.

====Mechanism====
The retrograde signaling hypothesis proposes that during the early stages of LTP expression, the postsynaptic cell &quot;sends a message&quot; to the presynaptic cell to notify it that an LTP-inducing stimulus has been received postsynaptically. The general hypothesis of retrograde signaling does not propose a precise mechanism by which this message is sent and received. One mechanism may be that the postsynaptic cell synthesizes and releases a retrograde messenger upon receipt of LTP-inducing stimulation. Another is that it releases a preformed retrograde messenger upon such activation. Yet another mechanism is that synapse-spanning proteins may be altered by LTP-inducing stimuli in the postsynaptic cell, and that changes in conformation of these proteins propagates this information across the synapse and to the presynaptic cell.

====Identity of the messenger====
Of these mechanisms, the retrograde messenger hypothesis has received the most attention. Among proponents of the model, there is disagreement over the identity of the retrograde messenger. A flurry of work in the early 1990s to demonstrate the existence of a retrograde messenger and to determine its identity generated a list of candidates including carbon monoxide, platelet-activating factor, arachidonic acid, and nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has received a great deal of attention in the past, but has recently been superseded by adhesion proteins that span the synaptic cleft to join the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. The endocannabinoids anandamide and/or 2-AG, acting through G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors, may play an important role in retrograde signaling in LTP.

<text>Tini &quot;Whetu&quot; Marama Tirikatene-Sullivan (9 January 1932 – 20 July 2011) was a New Zealand politician. She was an MP from 1967 to 1996, representing the Labour Party and was New Zealand’s first Māori woman cabinet minister. At the time of her retirement, she was the second longest-serving MP in Parliament, being in her tenth term of office. She was one of twenty holders of the Order of New Zealand, the highest honour of the country.

==Early life==
Whetu Marama Tirikatene was born on 9 January 1932, the daughter of Eruera Tirikatene and Ruti Tirikatene (). Her iwi are Ngāi Tahu and Ngāti Kahungunu. She was raised at Rātana Pā by her grandmother, dress designer and tailor Amiria Henrici Solomon. Educated at Rangiora High School and Wellington East Girls&#x27; College, she excelled in dancing, winning the New Zealand amateur Latin American ballroom dancing championship with her Australian partner Kevin Mansfield, and was also accomplished in fencing, becoming one of the top four female fencers in the country. She studied for a PhD in political science at the Australian National University, with the topic &quot;Contemporary Maori Political Involvement&quot;. While there, she met Denis Sullivan, a physics PhD student who later became an associate professor in physics and astrophysics at Victoria University of Wellington, and they were married in Canberra on 18 March 1967.

==Member of Parliament==





Her brother Te Rino Tirikatene stood unsuccessfully for the Labour Party in the and for . When their father Sir Eruera Tirikatene died in 1967 many expected Te Rino to succeed him as MP for Southern Maori. As Te Rino was part-Maori and entitled to choose between being on the Maori and European electoral rolls, at the time of the by-election he was registered on the European roll in Rangiora where he had to remain under the electoral act until the next general election, which made it unlikely he would be eligible as a candidate in Southern Maori. With her brother effectively ruled out, attention turned to Tirikatene (studying in Australia at the time) as the likely Labour candidate for the seat. She was eventually selected as Labour&#x27;s candidate.

She duly was elected to succeed her father in Parliament at the Southern Maori by-election of 1967. Between 1972 and 1975, she was the Minister of Tourism. In addition, she was Associate minister of Social Welfare from 1972 to 1974. She was Minister for the Environment from 1974 to 1975. She was re-elected by substantial majorities until the 1996 election, when the Southern Maori electorate was abolished in the transition to MMP. Tirikatene-Sullivan then contested the new Te Tai Tonga electorate, which covered much of the same territory as the old Southern Maori electorate, but she was narrowly defeated by Tu Wyllie of New Zealand First. She subsequently retired from politics.

In 1970, Tirikatene-Sullivan became the second woman to give birth whilst an MP. She later became the first (both in New Zealand and the Commonwealth) cabinet minister to give birth to a child.

On 6 February 1993, Tirikatene-Sullivan was appointed a Member of the Order of New Zealand, the highest civilian award given by the New Zealand government. The same year, she was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. She died in Wellington on 20 July 2011.

==Legacy==
Tirikatene-Sullivan was the youngest Māori woman elected at the time, she was also the first Māori woman to be a cabinet minister, and the first sitting MP to give birth in New Zealand. In 2016, her portrait was raised alongside Iriaka Rātana in the New Zealand Parliament Buildings at &quot;Mātangireia&quot;. The portraits were hung with a special ceremony held to commemorate them, with extended family attending the ceremony. Tirikatene-Sullivan&#x27;s 29 years representing Southern Maori was the longest at the time, and was only surpassed by Annette King&#x27;s 30 years as the longest-serving women in New Zealand&#x27;s Parliament.

Tirikatene-Sullivan was particularly known for her style of dress, often wearing fashionable outfits rather than the suits many professional women wore at the time. She was a patron of the arts, and she commissioned garments from contemporary Māori artists. These included artists like Sandy Adsett, Para Matchitt, Cliff Whiting, and Frank Davis. The Māori motifs that were incorporated into her outfits was unique for the time, and exposed New Zealanders to a new expression of Māori art. Tirikatene-Sullivan was acutely aware that her style of dress and design choice served as a political statement, and was conscious of the transformative power her style of dress served. As Minister of Tourism, she took her unique style to locations such as Australia&#x27;s Sydney Opera House, where she exhibited her &quot;Tania&quot; evening gown featuring a &quot;kowhaiwhai&quot; motif on a global stage. Her collection of outfits was exhibited at MTG Hawke&#x27;s Bay at an exhibition titled &quot;Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan: Travel in Style&quot;.

<text>The Taste of Chicago (also known locally as The Taste) is the world&#x27;s largest food festival, held in September in Chicago, Illinois in Grant Park. The event is also the largest festival in Chicago. Non-food-related events include live music on multiple stages, including the Petrillo Music Shell, pavilions, and performances. Musical acts vary from nationally known artists like Carlos Santana, Moby, Kenny Rogers, or Robert Plant to name just a few, to local artists. Since 2008, The Chicago Country Music Festival was held simultaneously with the Taste of Chicago but now has its own two-day festival, typically held in the fall. The Taste of Chicago also has rides present which may include a Ferris wheel and the &quot;Jump to Be Fit&quot; among others.

==History==

Arnie Morton, creator of the Taste, decided to line up Chicago restaurants to participate and persuaded then-Chicago mayor Jane Byrne and Commissioner of Cultural Affairs Lois Weisberg to block off Michigan Avenue for the first Taste of Chicago on July 4, 1980. Although organizers expected 100,000 people, a crowd of over 250,000 showed up, with food and soda sales grossing $300,000 at the festival&#x27;s inception. The next year, the Taste of Chicago was moved to Grant Park and grew in size and scope, becoming a 10-day event with more food vendors and musical performers; it also became the world&#x27;s largest food festival.

ChicagoFest, started by mayor Michael Bilandic, was the precursor to the Taste of Chicago. After Bilandic&#x27;s tenure in office, newly elected Mayor Jane Byrne attempted to end the festival as well as many other programs associated with the former mayor. Many Chicagoans disapproved of Mayor Byrne&#x27;s attempt to stop the festivities (although attendance at ChicagoFest had begun to wane). She and her successor, Mayor Harold Washington, dedicated more time and energy to promoting the Taste, slowly phasing ChicagoFest out in the process. Mayor Washington finally put an end to ChicagoFest when in 1983 it was moved from Navy Pier to Soldier Field and attendance continued to wane. The popularity of the Taste of Chicago has prompted other cities to spawn numerous offshoots and equivalents throughout North America such as the Taste of Champaign, CityFest in Detroit, the Taste of the Danforth in Toronto, the Taste of Kalamazoo, Taste of Addison, Taste of Denver, Taste in Dallas, Taste of Madison, Taste of Austin, the Taste of Peoria in Peoria, Illinois, and the Bite in Portland to name a few. The first &quot;taste of&quot; festival was Taste of Cincinnati in 1979.

In 2005, the Taste attracted about 3.9 million people with over 70 food vendors. Foods at the event include Chicago-style pizza, Chicago hot dogs, barbecued ribs, Italian Beef, Maxwell Street Polish Sausage, Eli&#x27;s Cheesecake, and a variety of ethnic and regional foods. A total of 3.6 million people visited the 2006 Taste of Chicago. Attendance for the previous record 10-day event, in 2004, was 3.59 million, with $12.33 million in revenue. These lackluster statistics prompted several changes. The mayor transferred power over the event from the Chicago Park District to the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, and the event was shortened to 5 days. In 2012, the Taste of Chicago ran from July 11 to July 15 and had 36 participating restaurants. In 2013, the Taste of Chicago turned a profit for the first time in six years with sales totaling $272,000. On Saturday, July 12, 2014, the Taste of Chicago closed because of severe weather—the first time the festival was canceled for the entire day because of &quot;excessive rainfall and flooding on the festival grounds&quot;.

In June 2020, the event was one of several Chicago events officially cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it was replaced by &quot;Taste of Chicago To-Go&quot; programming that included an online directory of vendors, video cooking demonstrations and performances, a food truck procession, and an expansion of the existing Community Eats program that brings free meals to first responders.

==2007 salmonella outbreak==
On July 12, 2007, city officials reported that an outbreak beginning in the Pars Cove Persian Cuisine booth caused 17 people to fall ill due to salmonella poisoning. Of those affected, three were hospitalized, including one minor. City officials started to receive reports of sickness on Monday but waited to issue a notice until Wednesday. The notice warned the public about symptoms and causes behind the bacteria that is spread by consuming foods contaminated with animal feces. After a thorough investigation of the Pars Cove Persian Cuisine booth, it was determined that the cucumber, hummus, and pomegranate chicken were the source of the illness. The booth failed a previous routine inspection for serving undercooked dishes but city officials did not file the report until Wednesday. City health inspectors found several violations at the restaurant including unsanitary conditions, improper refrigeration, and mouse droppings.

==List of musical performers==
The festival hosts a wide variety of performers.

<doc id="1240105" wikidata="Q3701627" url="?curid=1240105" title="Daniel Hernández (soccer, born 1976)">
<text>Daniel Demetrio Hernández (born July 23, 1976, in Tyler, Texas) is an American former soccer player.

==Career==

===Youth and college===
Hernández was a student at John Tyler High School and played youth soccer for the Dallas Texans Soccer Club. He played college soccer and college football as a placekicker at Southern Methodist University from 1994 to 1997, where he was a First Team All-American as an attacking midfielder.

===Professional===
Upon graduating from SMU, Hernández was drafted in the second round of the 1998 MLS College Draft by the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer. He saw little playing time in the Galaxy, appearing mostly a substitute, before being traded to the Tampa Bay Mutiny in exchange for Jorge Salcedo. Hernández hardly played for the Mutiny either, appearing in only four games, and was traded the next year to the MetroStars for the rights to Daniel Alvarez.

With the MetroStars, Hernández finally came into his own, earning a starting position, first in central defense, and then becoming one of the league&#x27;s most dangerous defensive midfielders. He stayed with the MetroStars from 2000 to 2002, but was a part of a blockbuster trade in the middle of 2002, which sent him along with Brian Kamler and Diego Serna to the New England Revolution for Mamadou Diallo, Andy Williams, and Ted Chronopoulos. Despite being a starter for the Revolution, Hernández expressed displeasure with his situation, requesting a trade to his home state Dallas Burn. The Burn, however, were unwilling to make such a trade, and upon the emergence of an adequate replacement for him in Shalrie Joseph, Hernández was transferred to Mexican club Necaxa mid-season 2003. In six seasons in MLS, he totalled four goals and 15 assists in league play.

To the surprise of many, Hernández – called Demetrio in Mexico – earned a starting position as a central defender on the club. According to Hernández, his profile in his hometown of Tyler has increased enormously since his arrival in the Primera División. However, in 2005, he came back to MLS, re-signing with New England. In 2007, he was waived by the Revolution.

After brief stints back in Mexico with Puebla and Chiapas F.C. in 2007 and 2008, Hernández signed with FC Dallas in September 2009. With Dallas, Hernandez has been a key player playing as the team&#x27;s primary defensive midfielder. Following the 2011 season, Hernández signed an extension with the club that saw him also become an assistant coach as part of a transition out of his playing career.

Hernández announced his retirement from playing professional soccer on November 21, 2012.

===Coaching===
Upon retiring as a player, it was announced Hernández would have a full-time coaching role, also with FC Dallas. However, just a few weeks after being hired Hernández was fired from his coaching job with FC Dallas.

<text>Ethel Theresa Wead Mick (March 9, 1881 – February 21, 1957) is the founder of the Masonic girls&#x27; organization The International Order of Job&#x27;s Daughters (now known as Job&#x27;s Daughters International) and served as its first Supreme Guardian.

==History==

She was born on March 9, 1881, in Atlantic, Iowa to William Henry Wead and Elizabeth Delight Hutchinson Wead, the youngest of four siblings. She was brought up in a close-knit, very religious family. Her mother read stories from the Bible every evening and often made reference to the Book of Job, hoping that her daughters would become &quot;as fair as the daughters of Job.&quot; This influence eventually resulted in the founding of the Order of Job&#x27;s Daughters in 1920, so named in honor of her mother. The group became International in 1931 when a bethel opened in British Columbia, Canada. Job&#x27;s Daughters International now exists in the US, Canada, Brazil, Australia and the Philippines.

Wead met William Mick while attending Creighton Medical College in Omaha, Nebraska. They were married in May 1904 and had two daughters, Ethel and Ruth. She enjoyed a variety of hobbies including oil painting, singing, reading, traveling and participating in several different fraternal organizations and civic clubs including the Nebraska Mayflower Society, Nu Sigma Phi (a medical sorority), the National Society of United States Daughters of 1812, Daughters of the American Revolution, White Shrine of Jerusalem, Order of the Eastern Star, and Ladies Auxiliary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. She died in Cleveland, Ohio, and is buried in Omaha.

<doc id="1240130" wikidata="Q301957" url="?curid=1240130" title="CJAX-FM">
<text>CJAX-FM (96.9 MHz) is a commercial radio station in Vancouver, British Columbia. Owned by Rogers Radio, a division of Rogers Sports &amp; Media, it broadcasts an adult hits radio format branded as [[Jack FM|Jack]] 96.9. Its studios are at 2440 Ash Street in the Fairview neighbourhood of Vancouver. CJAX was the first conventional radio station in North America to adopt the &quot;Jack&quot; branding, officially classified as &quot;variety hits&quot; or &quot;adult hits&quot;. Most &quot;Jack&quot; stations play a wide mix of music from the late 60s through the 90s, as well as some current and recent adult contemporary and hot adult contemporary singles.

CJAX-FM is a Class C station with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 32,000 watts (70,000 watts maximum). The transmitter is atop Mount Seymour in the District of North Vancouver. Programming is simulcast on a 1,430-watt repeater, 96.9 CJAX-FM-1 in Whistler. 

==History==
===Jazz and Urban AC===
The station signed on the air on . Its original call sign was CJAZ-FM and it broadcast on 92.1 FM in Vancouver. It was owned by Selkirk Communications, airing an all-jazz format. It transmitted from Salt Spring Island at 100,000 watts. Although overall regional coverage was very good, poor stereo reception in the key Vancouver area led the station to make some changes in 1984. It switched its frequency to 96.9 MHz and it relocated its transmitter to Mount Seymour. 

Low ratings for its jazz format led to a format change on September 15, 1985, when the station adopted an urban adult contemporary format, the first in Canada. It rebranded as &quot;FM 97&quot; and the call sign was changed to CKKS-FM. 

===Adult contemporary===
In 1986, CKKS began playing adult contemporary music with an on-air rebranding to &quot;97 Kiss FM&quot;. Four years later, the station was sold to Maclean-Hunter Ltd., and in 1994, it became a part of Rogers Broadcasting. Rival station CHQM-FM dropped its easy listening format in 1992, also switching to an adult contemporary format. Its ratings surpassed CKKS as Vancouver&#x27;s leading AC station, becoming Vancouver&#x27;s most-listened-to FM station later on.

In 1988, the West Coast Community T.V. Association received CRTC approval to add a low-power transmitter at 102.7 MHz in Ucluelet to rebroadcast the programming of CKKS-FM. The call sign for the Ucluelet transmitter (currently dark) is CIWC-FM.
===Jack-FM===
In early December of 2002, the station switched to Christmas music for the holidays. On Boxing Day, at 8 a.m., CKKS flipped to adult hits as &quot;Jack FM&quot;. The first song on &quot;Jack&quot; was &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; by AC/DC. The change ended the ten-year AC war in Vancouver, which meant that CHQM-FM became the only mainstream AC station in the Vancouver market. 

Given the &quot;attitude&quot; inherent in the &quot;Jack&quot; brand, management felt that the call letters &quot;CKKS&quot; would maintain an undesirable association with Kiss-FM&#x27;s &quot;soft favourites&quot; identity. As it turned out, in 2001, Corus Entertainment had abandoned the old CKLG call sign formerly assigned to one of its Vancouver AM stations (Mojo AM 730). Rogers applied to transfer these letters to Jack FM, and the station&#x27;s call sign became CKLG-FM shortly thereafter. This was in part an attempt to trade on CKLG-AM&#x27;s history as a popular Vancouver music station in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The move was successful, as Jack-FM&#x27;s ratings increased dramatically, at one point briefly surpassing traditional market leader CKNW before settling into the upper rankings in the Vancouver market. (The CKKS call sign was subsequently given to a Sechelt rebroadcaster of CISQ-FM in Squamish, British Columbia.)
In July 2012, the station adopted the &quot;Playing Whatever! Whenever!&quot; slogan. The station also added in more recent adult contemporary and hot adult contemporary songs. In 2014, the call letters were changed again, this time to CJAX-FM to reflect the &quot;Jack&quot; branding.

===Controversy===
In 2005, some members of Vancouver&#x27;s Indo-Canadian community accused the station of racial insensitivity. They objected to 96.9 Jack-FM&#x27;s advertising strategy. 

The ads in question featured Vijay Chandra, a Fijian radio engineer for the station with a strong South Asian accent, singing to promote Jack-FM&#x27;s &quot;Larry and Willy show&quot;. The complaints stemmed from a perception that viewers are intended to laugh at Chandra&#x27;s accent, rather than at the ad copy itself, and that similar lyrics performed without an accent would not be considered humorous.

===HD Radio===
In May 2016, CJAX began broadcasting using HD Radio technology. On June 23, 2016, CJAX added a simulcast of all-news sister station CKWX on its HD2 digital subchannel. On August 28, 2017, CJAX added a simulcast of co-owned sports radio station CISL to its HD3 subchannel.

In 2020 the station added Justin &quot;Drex&quot; Wilcomes as its morning host. In fall 2022 he had to take several weeks off from CJAQ after suffering a heart attack and undergoing surgery. but was back on air by spring 2023. His Jack FM show was cancelled in April 2024.

<doc id="1240137" wikidata="Q255922" url="?curid=1240137" title="Name of Austria">
<text>The German name of Austria, , derives from the Old High German word &quot;eastern realm&quot;, recorded in the so-called &quot; Document&quot; of 996, applied to the Margraviate of Austria, a march, or borderland, of the Duchy of Bavaria created in 976. 
The name is seemingly comparable to &quot;Austrasia&quot;, the early middle age term for the &quot;eastern lands&quot; of Francia, as known from the written records.

The Old High German name parallels the Middle Latin name &quot;&quot; (&quot;eastern borderland&quot;), alternatively called . The shorter Latinized name is first recorded in the 12th century. It has occasionally led to confusion, because, while it renders the Germanic word for &quot;east&quot; it is reminiscent of the native Latin term for &quot;south&quot;, (see Name of Australia).

In the 12th century, the Margraviate was elevated to the status of duchy, in 1453 to archduchy and from 1804 claiming imperial status, all the time retaining both the name &#x27; and the Latin name&#x27;.

, a translation of &quot;&quot; into Standard German, was used officially from 1938, when the country was incorporated into the German Reich, until 1945.

The contemporary state was created in 1955, with the Austrian State Treaty, and is officially called the &quot;Republic of Austria&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

==German name==
 is derived from Old High German . The term probably originates as a vernacular translation of the Latin name (eastern borderland). The is related to Old High German (eastern), but its exact derivation is unclear. Old High German &quot;rihhi&quot; had the meaning of &quot;realm, domain&quot;.

The , also called the Bavarian Eastern March (&quot;&quot;) and the March of Austria (), was a prefecture of the Duchy of Bavaria. It was assigned to the Babenberg family in 976. The variant is known from a single usage dated 996. Later Medieval documents record the word as either (official) or as (folk and poetic usage). The variation is first recorded in 998. appears on a deed granted by Emperor Henry IV and dated 1058.

Friedrich Heer, a 20th-century Austrian historian, stated in his book (&quot;The Struggle Over Austrian Identity&quot;), that the Germanic form was not a translation of the Latin word, but both resulted from a much older term originating in the Celtic languages of ancient Austria: more than 2,500 years ago, the major part of the actual country was called by the Celtic Hallstatt culture of the land; according to Heer, or meant &quot;east&quot; or &quot;easterns&quot;, whereas is related to the modern German , meaning &quot;realm&quot;. Accordingly, would essentially mean the same as and , thus &quot;Austria&quot;. The Celtic name was eventually Latinised to after the Romans conquered the area that encloses most of modern-day Austria, in around 15 BC. later became a Roman province in the mid 1st century AD. Heer&#x27;s hypothesis is not accepted by linguists.

An alternative theory, proposed by the Austrian Slavistics professor Otto Kronsteiner, suggests that the term is taken from a Slavic toponym meaning &#x27;pointed hill&#x27;, taking its popular meaning of &#x27;Eastern realm&#x27; at a much later time. This theory was rejected as untenable by Austrian linguist Heinz-Dieter Pohl.

Another remoter possibility is that the name comes from the Ostrogoths, who had a kingdom in what is now Austria and northern Italy.

===Ostarrîchi document===
The document was issued by Emperor Otto III on November 1, 996 in Bruchsal to Gottschalk von Hagenau, Bishop of Freising. It is today kept in the in Munich.

The historical significance of the document lies in the fact that it is the first time that the name , the linguistic ancestor of , the German name for Austria, is mentioned, even though it applied only to a relatively small territory. The document concerns a donation of the &quot;territory which is known in the vernacular as &quot; ( ), specified as the region of Neuhofen an der Ybbs (). The emperor donated this land to the abbey of Freising as a fief. The lands and some other communities in the vicinity, which the abbey acquired later, were held until 1803, when they were incorporated into Austria.

==Latin name==
The first written mention of the name &quot;Austria&quot; is found in the work Historia Langobardorum by Paolo Diacono and dates back to 796.

The name is a latinization of German (that is, the spelling of the name &quot;Austria&quot; approximates, for the benefit of Latin speakers, the sound of the German name ). This has led to much confusion as German is &quot;east&quot;, but Latin is &quot;south&quot;. That is why the name is similar to Australia, which is derived from the Latin (&quot;southern land&quot;).

The name is first recorded as (Margrave of Austria) on a deed issued by Conrad III to the Klosterneuburg Monastery in 1147. 
On the Privilegium Minus of 1156, the name of the country is given as (March of Austria) and as (Duchy of Austria). In English usage, &quot;Austria&quot; is attested since the early 17th century.

==Other languages==
All Germanic languages other than English have a name for Austria corresponding to : Afrikaans , Danish , Dutch , West Frisian , Icelandic , Faroese , Norwegian (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk) and Swedish . Finnish is also derived from the German name: means &quot;east&quot; and &quot;state&quot;. &quot;Austria&quot; or a phonetic derivative (such as ) was adopted in most other languages, including Hungarian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Maltese, Ukrainian, Russian, Serbian, Croatian, Polish, Slovene, Greek, Estonian, Turkish, and Albanian. French is one of the exceptions within the Romance group in adapting the German name, . Catalan also did the same, though the forms are no longer in use. Apart from the modern-day form of Austria, antiquated forms used in Catalan were and , and , which are the forms derived in that language to correspond to German .

The Czech and Slovak languages have a peculiar name for Austria. Czech and Slovak neither derived from German nor from Latin . The Czech name of , previously also and later , which is still used for the states of Upper and Lower Austria (), originates in the name of the Austrian castle and town of Raabs an der Thaya near the Czech-Austrian border, formerly also known as or . It is worth noting that in his Geography the ancient writer Ptolemy mentions two tribes (of unknown ethnic affiliation) named and which inhabit the areas around the Danube River &quot;up to his bend&quot;, roughly corresponding to the region north of Vienna and southwestern Slovakia.

Another possible explanation of Czech and Slovak : The predecessor of Austria and Slovenia was Slovene principality Carantania. The central part of Carantania (the territory of present-day southern Austria and north-eastern Slovenia) is named in Slovenian (or in the old version ), in Slovak , in German and in English &quot;Carinthia&quot;. The Old High German name of Austria () appeared in written document more than three hundred years later than the name Carantania, while the shorter Latin name was first mentioned only in 12th century. Therefore is it reasonably to assume that the present-day Czech and Slovak name for Austria (, ) developed from the original Slavic name for Carantania since in early middle ages and also later the ancestor of the present-day Slovaks and Slovenes were not divided by the wedge of Germanic or Germanized population. 

The Arabic name for Austria is (). The Arabic appellation of Austria was first used during the Crusades and was borrowed from the Slavic name for &quot;Germans&quot;, whence Russian (), Polish , Croatian and Bosnian , Serbian (), Slovene , Czech has , Slovak , etc..

In Persian, Austria was called () (the same name as Arabic) and when the Turks came to settle in Anatolia later in the Ottoman Empire era, they used the Arabic name of Austria as well and they called the country &quot;Nemçe&quot;. Currently, the name (), derived from the French pronunciation, is used.

<text>Casement Aerodrome () or Baldonnel Aerodrome is a military airbase to the southwest of Dublin, Ireland situated off the N7 main road route to the south and south west. It is the headquarters and the sole airfield of the Irish Air Corps, and is also used for other government purposes.

The airport is the property of the Irish Department of Defence. Baldonnel Aerodrome is also the home of the Garda Air Support Unit.

==History==
The airfield was first laid out in 1917 and was used by the Royal Flying Corps (soon to become the Royal Air Force). It was part of the RAF&#x27;s Ireland Command.

In 1919, civilian flights commenced, with a service from London.

The aerodrome was originally run by two pilots from the Royal Air Force. The airfield was the one from which the first successful east–west Atlantic crossing by a Junkers W33 aeroplane, the &quot;Bremen&quot;, took off on 12 April 1928 with Baron Hünefeld, Hermann Köhl and Captain James Fitzmaurice as co-pilot; and the first Aer Lingus flight took place from here on 27 May 1936. It was also the destination at which Douglas Corrigan landed on his famous &#x27;wrong way&#x27; flight across the Atlantic on 18 July 1938.

In February 1965 Baldonnel was renamed Casement Aerodrome in honour of the Irish nationalist Roger Casement, executed for treason by the British in 1916.

In 1995 it was suggested that it be used as a second commercial airport for Dublin, especially for low-cost carriers such as Ryanair.

Anti-war activists have accused the government of allowing the aerodrome&#x27;s use as a US military stopover hub, with protests in 2006 leading to arrests. In March 2002, Michael Smith, the Minister for Defence, confirmed that since September 2001, 22 US military aircraft had landed at the aerodrome. There has also been speculation since the early 2000s that Casement Aerodrome is used as an airport by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for their extraordinary rendition programme. Similar claims have been made with regard to Shannon Airport, but as Baldonnel is a military airport, it is impossible to verify.

Queen Elizabeth II landed at Casement Aerodrome on 17 May 2011, beginning her state visit to Ireland.

<doc id="1240162" wikidata="Q610326" url="?curid=1240162" title="Two for the Show (Kansas album)">
<text>Two for the Show is the first live album by American progressive rock band Kansas, released in 1978. The album was recorded over the course of the band&#x27;s three previous tours in 1977 and 1978. It was certified Gold and then Platinum shortly after its release. In 2008, a remastered and expanded edition was released to commemorate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

One single, &quot;Lonely Wind,&quot; was released from the album. The single version was edited to under 3 minutes, and included a small amount of the piano solo that precedes it on the album. It received a reasonable amount of airplay and rose to No. 60 on the pop charts. &quot;Record World&quot; called it &quot;a characteristic Kansas ballad with a lush high harmony hook.&quot;

In addition, Kirshner Records issued a promotional album of edited selections from the release, entitled &quot;Kansas Mini Concert&quot; on the spine and label, and &quot;Two for the Show Special Limited Edition&quot; on the cover. It features &quot;Lonely Wind,&quot; &quot;Dust in the Wind,&quot; &quot;Song for America,&quot; and &quot;The Wall.&quot; The same songs appear on both sides, and the first side is unbanded, meaning there is no indication on the vinyl of where each song begins. This promo album was issued with both a black and a white cover.

== Track listing ==
=== Original 1978 LP version ===


* &quot;Closet Chronicles&quot; was omitted from the original CD release due to time constraints but appears on the remastered version of &quot;The Best of Kansas&quot; released in 1999, and appears on the second CD of the remastered version of &quot;Two for the Show.&quot;

=== 2008 remastered version ===
&quot;Two for the Show&quot; was re-released as a 2-CD set in 2008 to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the album with a second disc of songs that did not appear on the original album (except &quot;Closet Chronicles&quot; which was included on the original vinyl, excluded from the original CD release, and appears here on the second CD along with the bonus material) and a 24-page booklet.

==== Disc One ====
==== Disc Two ====
All of the bonus tracks were recorded at the time of the recording of the album but omitted from the original album for various reasons including time constraints. Different live versions of &quot;Bringing It Back,&quot; &quot;Down the Road,&quot; &quot;Cheyenne Anthem,&quot; and &quot;Sparks of the Tempest&quot; appeared as bonus tracks on the remastered versions of &quot;Kansas,&quot; &quot;Song for America,&quot; &quot;Leftoverture,&quot; and &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; respectively. A different, earlier live version of &quot;Lonely Street&quot; appears as a bonus track on the later recorded U.S. version &quot;Live at the Whiskey&quot; (a different live version of &quot;Belexes&quot; and &quot;Journey from Mariabronn&quot; appear as a single bonus track on the German version of this release, available on iTunes and Apple Music)

In 2010, Legacy released the Kansas entry in Legacy&#x27;s Boxed Set series known as The Music of Kansas. The 3rd of 3 discs from this Boxed Set is culled entirely from the double CD version of this album, featuring live cuts from both the original and expanded release, marking the first compilation to feature any of the previously unreleased tracks. A 4 disc version of this release was also issued a year later.

<doc id="1240165" wikidata="Q4982387" url="?curid=1240165" title="Buccal pumping">
<text>Buccal pumping is &quot;breathing with one&#x27;s cheeks&quot;: a method of ventilation used in respiration in which the animal moves the floor of its mouth in a rhythmic manner that is externally apparent. It is the sole means of inflating the lungs in amphibians.

There are two methods of buccal pumping, defined by the number of movements of the floor of the mouth needed to complete both inspiration and expiration.

==Four stroke==
Four-stroke buccal pumping is used by some basal ray-finned fish and aquatic amphibians such as &quot;Xenopus&quot; and &quot;Amphiuma&quot;. This method has several stages. These will be described for an animal starting with lungs in a deflated state: First, the glottis (opening to the lungs) is closed, and the nostrils are opened. The floor of the mouth is then depressed (lowered), drawing air in. The nostrils are then closed, the glottis opened, and the floor of mouth raised, forcing the air into the lungs for gas exchange. To deflate the lungs, the process is reversed.
==Two stroke==
Two-stroke buccal pumping completes the process more quickly, as is seen in most extant amphibians. In this method, the floor of the mouth is lowered, drawing air from both the outside and lungs into the buccal cavity. When the floor of the mouth is raised, the air is pushed out and into the lungs; the amount of mixing is generally small, about 20%.

==Gular pumping==
Gular pumping refers to the same process, but accomplished by expanding and contracting the entire throat to pump air, rather than just relying upon the mouth.

This method of ventilation is inefficient, but is nonetheless used by all air-breathing amphibians and gular pumping is utilized to a varying extent by various reptile species. Mammals, in contrast, use the thoracic diaphragm to inflate and deflate the lungs more directly. Manta ray embryos also breathe by buccal pumping, as mantas give live birth and embryos are not connected to their mother by umbilical cord or placenta as in many other animals.

<doc id="1240175" wikidata="Q3073537" url="?curid=1240175" title="American Century">
<text>The American Century is a characterization of the period since the middle of the 20th century as being largely dominated by the United States in political, economic, technological, and cultural terms. It is comparable to the description of the period 1815–1914 as Britain&#x27;s Imperial Century. The United States&#x27; influence grew throughout the 20th century, but became especially dominant after the end of World War II, when only two superpowers remained; the United States and the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States remained the world&#x27;s only superpower, and became the hegemon, or what some have termed a hyperpower.

==Origin of the phrase==
The term was coined by &quot;Time&quot; publisher Henry Luce to describe what he thought the role of the United States would be and should be during the 20th century. Luce, the son of a missionary, in a February 17, 1941, &quot;Life&quot; magazine editorial urged the United States to forsake isolationism for a missionary&#x27;s role, acting as the world&#x27;s Good Samaritan and spreading democracy. He called upon the US to enter World War II to defend democratic values:

Democracy and other American ideals would &quot;do their mysterious work of lifting the life of mankind from the level of the beasts to what the Psalmist called a little lower than the angels&quot;. Only under the American Century can the world &quot;come to life in any nobility of health and vigor&quot;.

According to David Harvey, Luce believed &quot;the power conferred was global and universal rather than territorially specific, so Luce preferred to talk of an American century rather than an empire&quot;. In the same article he called upon United States &quot;to exert upon the world the full impact of our influence, for such purposes as we see fit and by such means as we see fit&quot;.

==Early characteristics==
Beginning at the end of the 19th century, with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and the Boxer Rebellion, the United States began to play a more prominent role in the world beyond the North American continent. The government adopted protectionism after the Spanish–American War to develop its native industry and built up the navy, the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot;. When Theodore Roosevelt became president in 1901, he accelerated a foreign policy shift away from isolationism and towards foreign involvement, a process which had begun under his predecessor William McKinley.

For instance, the United States fought the Philippine–American War against the First Philippine Republic to solidify its control over the newly acquired Philippines. In 1904, Roosevelt committed the United States to building the Panama Canal, creating the Panama Canal Zone. Interventionism found its formal articulation in the 1904 Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, proclaiming a right for the United States to intervene anywhere in the Americas, a moment that underlined the emergent US regional hegemony.

After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the United States pursued a policy of non-intervention, avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. President Woodrow Wilson later argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference. The United States was never formally a member of the Allies but entered the war in 1917 as a self-styled &quot;Associated Power&quot;. Initially the United States had a small army, but, after the passage of the Selective Service Act, it drafted 2.8 million men, and, by summer 1918, was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day. The war ended in 1919 with the Treaty of Versailles. The United States then adopted a policy of isolationism, having refused to endorse the 1919 Versailles Treaty or formally enter the League of Nations.

In 1916, the U.S. economy overtook that of the British Empire, becoming the world&#x27;s largest economy. During the interwar period, economic protectionism took hold in the United States, particularly as a result of the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act which is credited by economists with the prolonging and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression. From 1934, trade liberalization began to take place through the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.

With the onset of World War II in 1939, Congress loosened the Neutrality Acts of 1930s but remained opposed to entering the European war. In 1940, the United States ranked 18th in terms of military power. The Neutrality Patrol had US destroyers fighting at sea, but no state of war had been declared by Congress. American public opinion remained isolationist. The 800,000-member America First Committee vehemently opposed any American intervention in the European conflict, even as the US sold military aid to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union through the Lend-Lease program.

In the 1941 State of the Union address, known as the Four Freedoms speech, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a break with the tradition of non-interventionism. He outlined the US role in helping allies already engaged in warfare. By August, President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had drafted the Atlantic Charter to define goals for the post-war world. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor. These attacks led the United States and United Kingdom to declare war on Japan. Three days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, which the United States reciprocated.

During the War, the Big Four powers (the United States, United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China) met to plan the post-war world. In an effort to maintain peace, the Allies formed the United Nations, which came into existence on October 24, 1945, and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, as a common standard for all member states. The United States worked closely with the United Kingdom to establish the IMF, World Bank and NATO.

==Pax Americana==

Pax Americana represents the relative peace in the Western world, resulting in part from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States of America starting around the middle of the 20th century. Although the term finds its primary utility in the late 20th century, it has been used in other times in the 20th century. Its modern connotations concern the peace established after the end of World War II in 1945.

==Post-1945 characteristics==
The &quot;American Century&quot; existed through the Cold War and demonstrated the status of the United States as the foremost of the world&#x27;s two superpowers. After the Cold War, the most common belief held that only the United States fulfilled the criteria to be considered a superpower. Its geographic area composed the fourth-largest state in the world, with an area of approximately 9.37 million km2. The population of the US was 248.7 million in 1990, at that time the fourth-largest nation.

In the mid-to-late 20th century, the political status of the US was defined as a strongly capitalist federation and constitutional republic. It had a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council plus two allies with permanent seats, the United Kingdom and France. The US had strong ties with capitalist Western Europe, Latin America, British Commonwealth, and several East Asian countries (Korea, Taiwan, Japan). It allied itself with both right-wing dictatorships and capitalist democracies.

The American Century includes the political influence of the United States but also its economic influence. Many states around the world would, over the course of the 20th century, adopt the economic policies of the Washington Consensus, sometimes against the wishes of their populations. The economic force of the US was powerful at the end of the century due to it being by far the largest economy in the world. The US had large resources of minerals, energy resources, metals, and timber, a large and modernized farming industry and large industrial base. The United States dollar is the dominant world reserve currency under the Bretton Woods system. US systems were rooted in capitalist economic theory based on supply and demand, that is, production determined by customers&#x27; demands. The US was allied with the G7 major economies. US economic policy prescriptions were the &quot;standard&quot; reform packages promoted for crisis-wracked developing countries by Washington, DC–based international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, as well as the US Treasury Department.
The military of the United States was a naval-based advanced military with by far the highest military expenditure in the world. The United States Navy is the world&#x27;s largest navy, with the largest number of aircraft carriers, bases all over the world (particularly in an incomplete &quot;ring&quot; bordering the Warsaw Pact states to the west, south and east). The US had the largest nuclear arsenal in the world during the first half of the Cold War, one of the largest armies in the world and one of the two largest air forces in the world. Its powerful military allies in Western Europe (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization states) had their own nuclear capabilities. The US also possessed a powerful global intelligence network in the Central Intelligence Agency.

The cultural effect of the US, often known as Americanization, is seen in the influence on other countries of US music, TV, films, art, and fashion, as well as the desire for freedom of speech and other guaranteed rights its residents enjoy. US pop stars such as Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities.

==Criticism and usage==
Critics have condemned Luce&#x27;s &quot;jingoistic missionary zeal&quot;. Others have noted the end of the 20th century and the American Century, most famously the late gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson who titled his 2003 autobiography &quot;Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star Crossed Child in the Last Days of the American Century&quot;.

With the advent of the new millennium, critics from the University of Illinois stated that it was a matter of debate whether the US was losing its superpower status, especially in relation to China&#x27;s rise. Other analysts have made the case for the &quot;American Century&quot; fitting neatly between the US&#x27;s late entry into World War I in 1917 and the inauguration of its 45th President in 2017.

Other scholars, such as George Friedman, stipulate that &quot;The twenty-first century will be the American century.&quot;

<text>CSS &quot;Georgia&quot;, also known as &quot;State of Georgia&quot; and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Ram&quot;, was an ironclad warship built in Savannah, Georgia in 1862 during the American Civil War. The Ladies&#x27; Gunboat Association raised $115,000 for her construction to defend the port city of Savannah.

==Service history==

Commanded by Lieutenant Washington Gwathmey, CSN, the new warship was employed to defend the river channels below Savannah, using her cannons to prevent a Union advance on the city from the sea. When her steam engines turned out to lack sufficient power for offensive use, &quot;Georgia&quot; was anchored in the Savannah River as a floating battery, protecting both the city and Fort Jackson. &quot;Georgia&quot; had been in service about 20 months, when Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea captured Savannah by land on December 21, 1864. Her Confederate crew scuttled the ship to prevent her capture and use against the South.

==Wreck==
In 1866, the ship&#x27;s railroad track iron rail armor was partially salvaged and the wooden hull was shattered by the underwater charges used to remove it. The wreck was then left alone and forgotten. In 1968 &quot;Georgia&quot; was rediscovered during a dredging operation of the Savannah River. The wreck was left untouched, although accidental impacts from dredging equipment and the anchors marking the site location may have damaged what remained. By 1992, all that was survived were portions of her forward and aft casemates and parts of her engines, including the boilers, shafts, propellers, and condensers. Several of her cannon were located nearby, along with assorted ordnance.

In May 2012 the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) budgeted $14 million to raise the remains of the ironclad to allow for further dredging. Archeologists working for the USACE Savannah District, assisted by teams from the United States Navy, raised a section of &quot;Georgia&quot; on November 12, 2013.

Further relics are being recovered during an ongoing nine-month salvage operation in 2015, as an initiative to upgrade waterway access for deep sea vessels requires its dredging to . As of April 2015, USACE, with archaeologists from Texas A&amp;M University, had recovered over 1000 artifacts. The removal of ordnance and the lifting of the major remains of the casemates and machinery occurred in June–August 2015.

In the 1980s, a photograph was discovered that allegedly shows the &quot;Georgia&quot;, but it was later discovered to be fake.

&quot;Georgia&quot; was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

<doc id="1240185" wikidata="Q4744379" url="?curid=1240185" title="American Lutheran Church">
<text>The American Lutheran Church (ALC) was a Christian Protestant denomination in the United States and Canada that existed from 1960 to 1987. Its headquarters were in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Upon its formation in 1960, The ALC designated Augsburg Publishing House, also located in Minneapolis, as the church publisher. The &quot;Lutheran Standard&quot; was the official magazine of The ALC.

The ALC&#x27;s immigrant heritage came mostly from Germany, Norway, and Denmark, and its demographic center was in the Upper Midwest (with especially large numbers in Minnesota). Theologically, the church was influenced by pietism. It was slightly more conservative than the Lutheran Church in America (LCA), with which it would eventually merge. While officially it taught biblical inerrancy in its constitution, this was seldom enforced by such means as heresy trials.

The ALC was a founding member of the &quot;Lutheran Council in the United States of America&quot;, which began on January 1, 1967. The ALC cooperated with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod in many ventures, but the ties came to an end when talks concerning a merger of The ALC with the Lutheran Church in America began.

After six years, in 1966, Canadian congregations of the ALC formed the autonomous Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada (ELCC), which in 1986 joined with the Lutheran Church in America – Canada Section (LCA-CS) (former LCA congregations in separate regional synods in Canada) to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC).

==Formation==
The American Lutheran Church was formed in 1960 out of the following Lutheran church bodies:

===American Lutheran Church (1930–1960)===
The first American Lutheran Church was formed in 1930 by a merger of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Iowa and Other States (est. 1854), the Lutheran Synod of Buffalo (est. 1845), and the Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio and Other States (established 1818 from Ministerium of Pennsylvania), with headquarters in Columbus, Ohio. After the merger of 1960, this body was informally referred to as the &quot;old American Lutheran Church&quot; or the &quot;first American Lutheran Church&quot; to distinguish it from the later body into which it had been absorbed. The merged body was named &quot;The American Lutheran Church&quot; (with &quot;The&quot; as part of the official title and therefore capitalized), which was abbreviated &quot;TALC.&quot; Hence &quot;ALC&quot; designates the 1930-1960 body while &quot;TALC&quot; designates the 1960-1987 body.

===Evangelical Lutheran Church===
The Evangelical Lutheran Church, established in 1917 and known from its founding until 1946 as the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America (NLCA). The NLCA had itself been formed from a merger of the Hauge Synod (established 1876), the Norwegian Synod (established 1853), and the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America (established 1890).

===United Evangelical Lutheran Church===
The United Evangelical Lutheran Church, founded in 1896, and known until 1946 as the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church. The UDELC had been formed from a merger of the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Association in America (the &quot;Blair Church&quot;, established 1884) and the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America (the &quot;North Church&quot;, established 1894).

==Lutheran Free Church==
The Lutheran Free Church, which had broken away from the United Norwegian Lutheran Church in 1897, joined the ALC on February 1, 1963. Forty Lutheran Free Church congregations chose not to participate in the merger, and instead formed the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations, today the sixth-largest Lutheran denomination in the U.S. with over 250 congregations.

==Ordination of women==
The ALC began ordaining women as ministers/pastors in December 1970, when the Rev. Barbara Andrews became the second woman ordained as a Lutheran minister in the United States. In 1970, a survey of 4,745 Lutheran adults by Strommen et al., found that 66% of ALC Lutherans surveyed agreed that women should be ordained, compared with 75% of LCA Lutherans and 45% of LCMS Lutherans. The first Native American woman to become a Lutheran minister in the United States, the Rev. Marlene Whiterabbit Helgemo, was ordained by the ALC in July 1987.

==ELCA Merger==

On January 1, 1988, The American Lutheran Church ceased to exist when it, along with the Lutheran Church in America and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, joined to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with its new headquarters in the Lutheran Center on West Higgins Road in suburban Chicago, Illinois. At the time of the merger, The ALC was the third largest Lutheran church body in the United States, behind the Lutheran Church in America and Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod.

In 1986, just before its merger into the ELCA, The ALC had 7,671 pastors, 4,959 congregations, and 2,319,443 members. The ALC brought approximately 2.25 million members into the ELCA. Twelve conservative ALC congregations that did not want to participate in the merger formed the American Association of Lutheran Churches, which has since grown to 87 congregations.

==Presidents/presiding bishops==

*1971–1973 Kent S. Knutson
*1973–1987 David W. Preus

Use of the term &quot;presiding bishop&quot; as an alternative for the term &quot;general president&quot; was approved in 1980.

==History==

The town was established as a divisional point of the National Transcontinental Railway in 1913, 208 km west of Cochrane and 201 km east of the divisional point of Grant. There is some indeterminacy with the name Grant as the original site of Hearst was also called Grant and was changed to Hearst in 1911.

Hearst was named to honour William Howard Hearst, then Ontario Minister of Forests and Mines and later Premier of Ontario. It was incorporated in 1922. Many settlers to the town originally came from the province of Quebec. Many also came from Europe and other regions in Canada and the USA.

Different cultures can be found in Hearst such as Finn, Slovak, Bulgarian, Chinese, Portuguese, Greek, Ukrainian, First Nations and also Black Canadians.

The town is home to the Université de Hearst, formerly a federated school of Laurentian University in Sudbury. The Hearst Public Library was founded on December 17, 1974. In its beginning, the library was situated in the basement of the Hearst High School where it shared its space with the school library. On June 4, 1984, the library moved to its present location, 801 George Street (formerly Stedman&#x27;s). Hearst is a four-season destination. Many years ago, the town proclaimed itself the Moose Capital of Canada. Local outdoor activities include fishing, hunting, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, camping, swimming, canoeing, and golf.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Hearst is served by Hearst (René Fontaine) Municipal Airport.

The Ontario Northland Railway purchased the part of the National Transcontinental Railway serving Hearst in 1993. The Canadian National Railways (formerly Algoma Central Railway) connects with the Ontario Northland at Hearst.

Hearst was the northern terminus for a Canadian National Railways-operated passenger train service from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, running over the tracks of the Algoma Central Railway.
Hearst is the northern terminus for Ontario Northland&#x27;s coach service.

==Education==
Hearst has both elementary and high schools (public and Catholic). It also has the Université de Hearst, a post-secondary institution that was formerly federated with Laurentian University in Sudbury. Education can also be sought at the collegiate level with the Collège Boréal.

<text>A drop registrar is a domain name registrar who registers expiring Internet domain names immediately after they expire and are deleted by the domain name registry. A drop registrar will typically use automated software to send up to 250 simultaneous domain name registration requests in an attempt to register the domain name first. In recognition of the potential abuse of such a &quot;domain land rush&quot;, ICANN and VeriSign limited the number of simultaneous requests to 250 since July 17, 2001. 

Drop registrars usually work for a domain back-order service, and receive a percentage of the final auction price.

<doc id="1240200" wikidata="Q618319" url="?curid=1240200" title="Monolith (Kansas album)">
<text>Monolith is the sixth studio album by American progressive rock band Kansas, released in 1979 (see 1979 in music). The album reached No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts, marking their third straight (and last) studio album to reach the top ten.

== Overview ==
Their first studio album to be produced by the band themselves, &quot;Monolith&quot; would be the third studio album release by Kansas to rank in the Top Ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. However, &quot;Monolith&quot; would prove to be a commercial disappointment in the face of bad reviews and the lack of a high-impact hit single. The lead single &quot;People of the South Wind&quot; stalled in the Top 30 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in August 1979, causing the rush release of &quot;Reason to Be&quot; as the second single: much-likened to Kansas&#x27; signature hit &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;, &quot;Reason to Be&quot; would nowhere near approximate that 1978 Top Ten hit&#x27;s success, the Hot 100 peak of &quot;Reason to Be&quot; being #52.

On their 80-city US tour, the band&#x27;s set list featured the entire album early in the tour, though by the time the tour ended, about half the songs had been cut from the live set in favor of older numbers. A national broadcast of their show at Alpine Valley, Wisconsin on this tour featured the entire album and is one of the most popular unissued live recordings of the band. Believing that fans didn&#x27;t like &quot;Monolith&quot;, they did not perform any of the songs again until the mid-1990s, when they revived &quot;People of the South Wind&quot; and &quot;Reason to Be&quot; briefly. The opening track, &quot;On the Other Side&quot;, has since been featured in performances on and off on tours, including for the &quot;Device – Voice – Drum&quot; DVD, although not appearing on the DVD itself. With the arrival of a revamped lineup over the past 5 years, songs such as &quot;Reason to Be&quot; and &quot;People of the South Wind&quot; have been added to the setlist at various times.

Following the US &quot;Monolith&quot; tour, the band had its first tour of Japan, in January 1980. The band performed four songs from Monolith on their Japanese tour: &quot;People of the South Wind,&quot; &quot;Stay Out of Trouble,&quot; &quot;How My Soul Cries Out for You&quot; (the set closer featuring a dramatic performance including a body dropping from the ceiling), and &quot;On the Other Side&quot; (which was released as an edited picture sleeve single in Japan). A special promotional album entitled &quot;Kansas Monolith Tour 1980 in Japan&quot; was issued to radio stations there to publicize the dates and featured three songs from &quot;Monolith&quot; and five of their earlier popular songs.

&quot;Monolith&quot; initially sold about 800,000 copies, obtaining gold status, but ultimately went platinum in the early 1990s. Kerry Livgren donated his platinum record to the Kansas State Historical Society. The album stayed on the Billboard album chart for a total of 24 weeks, and was one of the Top 100 charting albums (#100) for the calendar year 1979.

Even though MTV was still two years away, promotional music videos were produced for four tracks on &quot;Monolith&quot;: &quot;On the Other Side&quot;, &quot;People of the South Wind&quot;, &quot;Away from You&quot;, and &quot;Reason to Be&quot;.

Livgren&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Monolith&quot; were partly influenced by &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, of which he was a devotee before his conversion to Christianity.

== Cover art ==
As Phil Ehart, drummer for the band Kansas, shared with Jeb Wright (a legendary rock radio and print interviewer) in a Goldmine interview called &quot;Behind the Paintbrush&quot;, Ehart told stories about the artwork for Kansas album covers, including &quot;Monolith&quot;:

Bruce Wolfe, an artist that did a Levi’s commercial, did that album cover. He had done one of the first animated commercials on television. By the time CBS approached him, he had been doing some album covers. We had sent him the song “People of the South Wind” and he sent back this fricking painting … it was huge. It was not a drawing; it was a real painting of this Indian whose headdress was a space helmet. There were all of these overpasses that were broken and there were a bunch of Indians on the back that looked like they were at a Boy Scout camp or something. He did an incredible job. He took our logo and made it work. It was always a challenge to take that logo and make it look cool. He used the features on it and it really worked. Again, what an icon … it was a 9-foot-tall Native American chief wearing some sort of buffalo robe and a space helmet with horns. The guy must have done a lot of drugs, but we thought it was really cool.

==Release history==
The album was remastered and reissued in 2011, as a Japanese import vinyl-replica Blu-spec CD (Epic EICP 20078) including the rarity live version of &quot;On the Other Side&quot; previously available only on the 1994 Legacy-issued Box Set. A domestic version of the remaster was released in standard CD format in the US as part of Legacy Recordings&#x27; Classic Album Collection series which included all of their Kirshner/CBS studio releases. A Dutch-issued &quot;Music on CD&quot; series released the album on CD in 2016. It was last of the albums with the original lineup to be re-released on vinyl. Three different colored vinyl versions appeared in 2018 and 2019.

== Reception ==

The album received negative reviews. John Swenson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who had previously reviewed &quot;Point of Know Return&quot;, was far less pleased with &quot;Monolith&quot;, particularly criticizing the album&#x27;s pretentiousness (&quot;this band is just an American version of the Moody Blues and Emerson, Lake and Palmer: &quot;serious&quot; music that turns up its nose at rock &amp; roll&#x27;s expressiveness and substitutes bombast for emotion.&quot;) and the awkward hemming and hawing lyrics (citing &quot;And if I seem too inconclusive/It&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s so elusive&quot; as an example).

Steve Bond in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined that while Kansas had fulfilled its inaugural promise as heir apparent to prog rock veterans Yes and Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer with their 1977 breakout hit &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;, &quot;Monolith&quot; would indicate that &quot;success [has] bred complacency&quot;, the album lacking the &quot;variety and spice&quot; of the band&#x27;s precedent output: &quot;[Although Kansas&#x27;] six members are all solid musicians who can dish out reasonably inventive, attractively textured rock &amp; roll [they] apparently can&#x27;t resist the temptation to recreate the overblown, showy instrumentals and ponderously empty lyrics symptomatic of those [prog rock veterans] at their worst.&quot;

Robert Taylor of AllMusic retrospectively awarded the album two stars out of five, commending the band&#x27;s fine playing while criticizing an exhaustion of their musical style and an overall lack of direction. He particularly criticized the &quot;juvenile&quot; lyrics and a shifting focus towards mainstream radio.

&quot;Record World&quot; said of the single &quot;Reason to Be&quot; that &quot;Dramatic vocals and extravagantly produced instrumental colors make a moving statement.&quot;

<text>Gilberto José Rodríguez Orejuela (30 January 1939 – 31 May 2022) was a Colombian drug lord and one of the leaders of the Cali Cartel. Orejuela formed the cartel with his brother, Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela, José Santacruz Londoño, and Hélmer Herrera. The cartel emerged to prominence in the early 1990s, and was estimated to control about 80% of the American and 90% of the European cocaine markets in the mid-1990s. Rodríguez Orejuela was captured after a 1995 police campaign by Colombian authorities and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He obtained early release in 2002, and was re-arrested in 2003, after which he was extradited to the United States. There, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison, where he died in 2022.

== Early life ==
Gilberto José Rodríguez Orejuela was born on Jan. 30, 1939, in Mariquita, Colombia, about 110 miles northwest of Bogotá. His family moved to Cali when he was a child. His father, Carlos Rodríguez, was a painter; his mother, Ana Rita Orejuela, was a homemaker. After leaving high school at 15, he began working as a drugstore clerk. He rose to become a manager, and opened his own store at age 25.

== Criminal career ==
While working his way up in the pharmacy business, Rodríguez Orejuela began his criminal career, engaging in kidnapping and then, the drug trade. 

=== Cali Cartel ===
During the 1970s, Rodríguez Orejuela and his brother Miguel helped to organize, along with José Santacruz Londoño and Hélmer Herrera, a loose consortium of drug trafficking gangs that came to be known as the Cali Cartel. Members cooperated in processing, shipping and distribution. The Rodríguez Orejuela brothers, as heads of the most successful of the cartel members, became the cartel leadership. Gilberto was the strategic planner and visionary, nickname &quot;The Chess Player&quot; for his calculated approach; Miguel oversaw day-to-day operations. The cartel maintained a low profile, avoiding flashy parties, conspicuous displays of wealth, and unnecessary violence.

In the early 1990s, after the fall of the Medellin Cartel, the Cali Cartel emerged as the leading cocaine trafficking organization in the world. They were initially primarily involved in marijuana, and branched out into cocaine during the 1980s. During the 1990s, it was estimated that the Cali Cartel supplied about 80% of the cocaine in the US, and 90% of the European cocaine market. 

On November 15, 1984, Gilberto was captured in Spain. At the time of his arrest, he was accompanied by Jorge Luis Ochoa Vásquez. Gilberto had been in Spain to hold meetings with the aim of expanding cartel business on the European continent. The cartel began to work with traffickers in Galicia, and established strategic alliances with the powerful Camorra, which would be in charge of the distribution of Cali cocaine throughout Europe. The Colombian government intervened to stop Spain from extraditing Rodríguez Orejuela to the US. He was instead returned to Colombia, where he stood trial on the same charges and was acquitted.

The Cali Cartel was less violent than its rival, the Medellín Cartel. While the Medellín Cartel was involved in a brutal campaign of violence against the Colombian government, the Cali Cartel grew. After the demise of Pablo Escobar, the Colombian authorities turned their attention to the Cali Cartel. The police campaign against the cartel began in the summer of 1995. President Ernesto Samper dispatched a &quot;joint task force&quot; code named &quot;Search Bloc&quot;, formed by top police and elite commandos headed by Police General Rosso José Serrano, declaring an all-out war against the drug cartels.

==Capture==

On 9 June 1995, Rodríguez Orejuela was arrested by the Colombian National Police (PNC) during a house raid in Cali. He was found in a hidden compartment located behind a TV. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison but was freed in October 2002, by a controversial judicial order that cited good behavior and participation in work-study programs, issued by deputy judge Pedro José Suárez. The Colombian government halted the order, and launched an obstruction of justice investigation into Suárez. Within days, a second judge upheld the order and Rodríguez Orejuela was released. 

In March 2003, Rodríguez Orejuela was rearrested by Colombian authorities in Cali, on new charges stemming from running the cartel from prison.

=== Extradition to the United States ===

Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela was extradited to the United States on 3 December 2004. His brother Miguel was later also arrested and deported. 
On 26 September 2006, both Gilberto and Miguel were sentenced to 30 years in prison, after pleading guilty to charges of conspiring to import cocaine to the US. In the plea deal, the US agreed not to bring charges against their relatives, in exchange for asset forfeiture. The brothers&#x27; forfeited $2.1 billion in illegal profits, and the US did not charge six of their relatives with money laundering and obstructing justice. On condition that they forfeit tainted assets, including bank accounts, businesses and luxury homes, 28 family members, including sons, daughters and cousins, were removed from a US Department of Treasury sanctions list that designated them members of the Cali cartel.
On 16 November 2006, the brothers pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to engage in money laundering. Both were sentenced to an additional 87 months in prison. The two prison terms were set to run concurrently.

On 5 March 2018, a Colombian court sentenced eight relatives of the Rodríguez brothers to nine years in prison for laundering money that had been obtained during the Rodriguez brothers&#x27; time as heads of the Cali Cartel. Specifically, the court found that the family had used their legitimate businesses (including the pharmacy chain Drogas La Rebaja) to launder billions of pesos. These individuals had also shifted the money through various bank accounts in order to make it appear legitimate.

At the time of his death, Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela was serving a 30-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Butner, a medium-security facility in North Carolina. He was inmate number 14023-059, with a release date of 15 July 2029, at age 90. While in prison, he suffered from two heart attacks, colon and prostate cancer, and COVID.

On 6 February 2020, Rodríguez Orejuela submitted an application to a Miami federal judge seeking compassionate early release pursuant to the First Step Act. The application was made despite having served only half of his 30 year term. On 28 April 2020, Federal District Judge Federico Moreno rejected the application, finding that there were no &quot;extraordinary and compelling&quot; grounds to support the application. The judge stated that &quot;the court is totally unwilling to undermine and undo such public respect for the law, as well as the gravity of the offenses committed&quot; and that while Rodríguez Orejuela has endured a litany of chronic illnesses including cancer, his criminal record was so repugnant that there is no way he could effectively cut his sentence in half.

== Personal life ==
Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela was married to Myriam Ramirez. His children include Jaime Fernando, a graduate in international commerce at the University of Grenoble, two sons who studied at Stanford University and the University of Tulsa, and a son who studied systems engineering. Rodríguez Orejuela stated that one of his daughters has an MBA and that a second is an engineer.

<text>A casemate is a fortified gun emplacement or armoured structure from which guns are fired, in a fortification, warship, or armoured fighting vehicle.

When referring to antiquity, the term &quot;casemate wall&quot; means a double city wall with the space between the walls separated into chambers, which could be filled up to better withstand battering rams in case of siege (see .)

In its original early modern meaning, the term referred to a vaulted chamber in a fort, which may have been used for storage, accommodation, or artillery which could fire through an opening or embrasure. Although the outward faces of brick or masonry casemates proved vulnerable to advances in artillery performance, the invention of reinforced concrete allowed newer designs to be produced well into the 20th century. With the introduction of ironclad warships, the definition was widened to include a protected space for guns in a ship, either within the hull or in the lower part of the superstructure. Although the main armament of ships quickly began to be mounted in revolving gun turrets, secondary batteries continued to be mounted in casemates; however, several disadvantages eventually also led to their replacement by turrets. In tanks and other armored fighting vehicles that do not have a turret for the main gun, the structure that accommodates the gun is also called a casemate.

==Etymology==
First recorded in French in the mid-16th century, from the Italian or Spanish , perhaps meaning a slaughterhouse, although it could derive from &quot;casa&quot; (in the sense of &quot;hut&quot;), and &quot;matta&quot; (Latin ), &quot;done with reeds and wickers&quot;, thus a low-roof hut without windows or other openings set in marshy place. It could also come from &quot;casa matta&quot; with in the sense of &quot;false&quot;. However, it may have been ultimately derived from the Greek (), a gap or aperture.

==Antiquity: casemate wall==

The term &quot;casemate wall&quot; is used in the archaeology of Israel and the wider Near East, having the meaning of a double wall protecting a city or fortress, with transverse walls separating the space between the walls into chambers. These could be used as such, for storage or residential purposes, or could be filled with soil and rocks during siege in order to raise the resistance of the outer wall against battering rams. Originally thought to have been introduced to the region by the Hittites, this has been disproved by the discovery of examples predating their arrival, the earliest being at Ti&#x27;inik (Taanach) where such a wall has been dated to the 16th century BC. Casemate walls became a common type of fortification in the Southern Levant between the Middle Bronze Age (MB) and Iron Age II, being more numerous during the Iron Age and peaking in Iron Age II (10th–6th century BC). However, the construction of casemate walls had begun to be replaced by sturdier solid walls by the 9th century BC, probably due the development of more effective battering rams by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Casemate walls could surround an entire settlement, but most only protected part of it. The three different types included freestanding casemate walls, then integrated ones where the inner wall was part of the outer buildings of the settlement, and finally filled casemate walls, where the rooms between the walls were filled with soil right away, allowing for a quick, but nevertheless stable construction of particularly high walls.

==Modern period==
===Land fortification===
====Early modern period====
In fortifications designed to resist artillery, a casemate was originally a vaulted chamber usually constructed underneath the rampart. It was intended to be impenetrable and could be used for sheltering troops or stores. With the addition of an embrasure through the scarp face of the rampart, it could be used as a protected gun position. In bastion forts, artillery casemates were sometimes built into the flanks of bastions, but in action they quickly filled with smoke making them inoperable and for that reason, had fallen out of favor during the 17th century.

====18th and 19th centuries====
In the late 18th century, Marc René, marquis de Montalembert (1714–1800) experimented with improved casemates for artillery, with ventilation systems that overcame the problem of smoke dispersal found in earlier works. For coastal fortifications, he advocated multi-tiered batteries of guns in masonry casemates, that could bring concentrated fire to bear on passing warships. In 1778, he was commissioned to build a fort on the Île-d&#x27;Aix, defending the port of Rochefort, Charente-Maritime. The outbreak of the Anglo-French War forced him to hastily to build his casemated fort from wood but he was able to prove that his well-designed casemates were capable of operating without choking the gunners with smoke. The defenses of the new naval base at Cherbourg were later constructed according to his system. After seeing Montalembert&#x27;s coastal forts, American engineer Jonathan Williams acquired a translation of his book and took it to the United States, where it inspired the Second and Third Systems of coastal fortification; the first fully developed example being Castle Williams in New York Harbor which was started in 1807. 
In the early 19th century, French military engineer Baron Haxo designed a free-standing casemate that could be built on the top of the rampart, to protect guns and gunners from the high-angle fire of mortars and howitzers.
The advantages of casemated artillery were proved in the Crimean War of 1853–1856, when attempts by the Royal Navy to subdue the casemated Russian forts at Kronstadt were unsuccessful, while a casemated gun tower at Sevastopol, the Malakoff Tower, could only be captured by a surprise French infantry attack while the garrison was being changed. In the early 1860s, the British, apprehensive about a possible French invasion, fortified the naval dockyards of southern England with curved batteries of large guns in casemates, fitted with laminated iron shields tested to withstand the latest projectiles.

However, in the American Civil War (1861–1865), the exposed masonry of casemate batteries was found to be vulnerable to modern rifled artillery; Fort Pulaski was breached in a few hours by only ten such guns. In contrast, hastily constructed earthworks proved much more resilient. This led to casemates for artillery again falling out of favor. In continental Europe, they were often replaced by rotating gun turrets, but elsewhere large coastal guns were mounted in less expensive concrete gun pits or barbettes, sometimes using disappearing carriages to conceal the gun except at the moment of firing. Casemates for secure barrack accommodation and storage continued to be built; the 1880s French forts of the Séré de Rivières system for example, had a central structure consisting of two stories of casemates, buried under layers of earth, concrete and sand to a depth of , intended to defeat the new high explosive shells.
Towards the end of the century, Imperial Germany had developed a new form of fortification called a &quot;feste&quot; (German article: &quot;Festung#Feste&quot;), in which the various elements of each fort were more widely dispersed in the landscape. These works, the first of which was Fort de Mutzig near Strasbourg, had separate artillery blocks, infantry positions and underground barracks, all built of reinforced concrete and connected by tunnels or entrenchments. Although the main armament of these forts was still mounted in armored turrets, local defense was provided by separate protected positions for field guns; these concrete structures were copied by the French who called them &quot;casemates de Bourges&quot; (French article: &quot;Casemate de Bourges&quot;) after the proving ground where they had been tested.

====20th century====

Following experience gained in the World War I, French engineers began to design a new scheme of fortifications to protect their eastern border, which became known as the Maginot Line. The main element of this line were large underground forts based on the &quot;feste&quot; principle, whose main armament was in turrets, however the countryside between them was defended by smaller self-sufficient works based on the earlier &quot;casemates de bourges&quot;, housing either light field guns or anti-tank guns. As the World War II approached, similar casemate designs were adopted by other European nations as they offered protection from attacking aircraft. The German Organisation Todt undertook the development of casemates for the large coastal guns of the Atlantic Wall. Built of concrete up to thick, they were thought to be able to withstand any form of attack. Work by the Western Allies to develop countermeasures that could defeat casemates and other types of bunker resulted in weapons such as tank-mounted spigot mortars, rocket-assisted projectiles, recoilless rifles, various types of demolition charge and earthquake bombs.

===Naval===
In warship design the term &quot;casemate&quot; has been used in a number of ways, but it generally refers to a protected space for guns within a ship&#x27;s hull or superstructure.

The first ironclad warship, the (1858), was a wooden steamship whose hull was covered with armored plating, tested to withstand the largest smoothbore guns available at the time. The response by the British Royal Navy to this perceived threat was to build an iron-hulled frigate, . However, it was realised that to armor all of the hull to fully withstand the latest rifled artillery would make it unfeasibly heavy, so it was decided to create an armored box or casemate around the main gun deck, leaving the bow and stern unarmored.
The American Civil War saw the use of casemate ironclads: armored steamboats with a very low freeboard and their guns on the main deck (&#x27;Casemate deck&#x27;) protected by a sloped armoured casemate, which sat atop the hull. Although both sides of the Civil War used casemate ironclads, the ship is mostly associated with the southern Confederacy, as the north also employed turreted monitors, which the south was unable to produce. The most famous naval battle of the war was the duel at Hampton Roads between the Union turreted ironclad and the Confederate casemate ironclad (built from the scuttled remains of ).

&quot;Casemate ship&quot; was an alternative term for &quot;central battery ship&quot; (UK) or &quot;center battery ship&quot; (US). The casemate (or central battery) was an armored box that extended the full width of the ship protecting many guns. The armored sides of the box were the sides or hull of the ship. There was an armored bulkhead at the front and rear of the casemate, and a thick deck protecting the top. The lower edge of the casemate sat on top of ship&#x27;s belt armour. Some ships, such as (laid down 1873), had a two-story casemate.

A &quot;casemate&quot; was an armored room in the side of a warship, from which a gun would fire. A typical casemate held a 6-inch gun, and had a front plate (forming part of the side of the ship), with thinner armor plates on the sides and rear, with a protected top and floor, and weighed about 20 tons (not including the gun and mounting). Casemates were similar in size to turrets; ships carrying them had them in pairs, one on each side of the ship.
The first battleships to carry them were the British laid down in 1889. They were adopted as a result of live-firing trials against in 1888. Casemates were adopted because it was thought that the fixed armor plate at the front would provide better protection than a turret, and because a turret mounting would require external power and could therefore be put out of action if power were lost – unlike a casemate gun, which could be worked by hand. The use of casemates enabled the 6-inch guns to be dispersed, so that a single hit would not knock out all of them. Casemates were also used in protected and armored cruisers, starting with the 1889 and retrofitted to the 1888 during construction.

In the pre-dreadnought generation of warships, casemates were placed initially on the main deck, and later on the upper deck as well. Casemates on the main deck were very close to the waterline. In the &quot;Edgar&quot;-class cruisers, the guns in the casemates were only above the waterline. Casemates that were too close to the waterline or too close to the bow (such as in the 1912 &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class dreadnoughts) were prone to flooding, making the guns ineffective.
Shipboard casemate guns were partially rendered obsolete by the arrival of &quot;all-big gun&quot; battleship and battlecruiser, pioneered by and &quot;Invincible&quot;, respectively, who carried their main guns in turrets and secondary armament upon the superstructure in exposed single mounts. Casemates would be quickly reintroduced in succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes for secondary armament due to the increasing torpedo threat from destroyers. 

Many World War I-era battleships that remained in service had their casemates plated over during modernization in the 1930s (or after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, in the case of US vessels) but some, like carried them to the end of World War II. The last ships built with casemates as new construction were the American s of the early 1920s and the 1933 Swedish aircraft cruiser . In both cases the casemates were built into the forward angles of the forward superstructure (and the aft superstructure as well, in the Omahas).

===Armoured vehicles===


In regards to armored fighting vehicles, casemate design refers to vehicles that have their main gun mounted directly within the hull and lack the rotating turret commonly associated with tanks. Such a design generally makes the vehicle mechanically simpler in design, less costly in construction, lighter in weight and lower in profile. The saved weight can be used to mount a heavier, more powerful gun or alternatively increase the vehicle&#x27;s armor protection in comparison to regular, turreted tanks. However, in combat the crew has to rotate the entire vehicle if an enemy target presents itself outside of the vehicle&#x27;s limited gun traverse arc. This can prove very disadvantageous in combat situations.

During World War II, casemate-type armored fighting vehicles were heavily used by both the combined German Wehrmacht forces, and the Soviet Red Army. They were mainly employed as tank destroyers and assault guns. Tank destroyers, intended to operate mostly from defensive ambush operations, did not need a rotating turret as much as offensively used tanks, while assault guns were mainly used against fortified infantry positions and could afford a longer reaction time if a target presented itself outside the vehicle&#x27;s gun traverse arc. Thus, the weight and complexity of a turret was thought to be unnecessary, and could be saved in favor of more capable guns and armor. In many cases, casemate vehicles would be used as both tank destroyers or assault guns, depending on the tactical situation. The Wehrmacht employed several casemate tank destroyers, initially with the still-&quot;Panzerjäger&quot; designation &quot;Elefant&quot; with an added, fully enclosed five-sided (including its armored roof) casemate atop the hull, with later casemate-style tank destroyers bearing the &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; (literally &#x27;hunting tank&#x27;) designation, with much more integration of the casemate&#x27;s armour with the tank hull itself. Examples are the Jagdpanzer IV, the Jagdtiger and the Jagdpanther. Assault guns were designated as &#x27;Sturmgeschütz&#x27;, like the Sturmgeschütz III and Sturmgeschütz IV. In the Red Army, casemate tank destroyers and self-propelled guns bore an &quot;SU-&quot; or &quot;ISU-&quot; prefix, with the &quot;SU-&quot; prefix an abbreviation for Samokhodnaya Ustanovka, or &quot;self-propelled gun&quot;. Examples are the SU-100 or the ISU-152. Both Germany and the Soviet Union mainly built casemate AFVs by using the chassis of already existing turreted tanks, instead of designing them from scratch.

While casemate AFVs played a very important role in World War II (the &quot;Sturmgeschütz&quot; III for example was the most numerous armored fighting vehicle of the German Army during the entire war), they became much less common in the post-war period. Heavy casemate tank destroyer designs such as the US T28 and the British Tortoise never went beyond prototype status, while casemate vehicles of a more regular weight, such as the Soviet SU-122-54, saw only very limited service. The general decline of casemate vehicles can be seen in the technological progress which resulted in the rise of universal main battle tanks, which unified in them the capability to take up the roles and tasks which in the past had to be diverted between several different classes of vehicles. However, vehicles such as the German Kanonenjagdpanzer of the 1960s still let the casemate concept live on, while the Swedish Army went as far as employing a casemate tank design, the Stridsvagn 103, or &quot;S-Tank&quot;, as their main armored fighting vehicle from the 1960s until the 1990s, favoring it over contemporary turreted designs. Other casemate design ideas, such as the projected German Versuchsträger 1–2 with two main guns, were developed even later.

<text>are a type of wagashi, which is a general term for traditional Japanese sweets and candies. Namagashi may contain fruit jellies, other gelatines such as Kanten, or sweetened bean paste. Namagashi is detailed, designed with using seasonal and natural motifs such as leaves and flowers to reflect the various objects of nature in Japan&#x27;s four seasons. Namagashi are usually freshly made and are much more moist than other wagashi, like higashi. It generally contains 30% more water than other types. Like other wagashi, namagashi are made of natural ingredients; additives are rarely used. Namagashi is generally served with tea, and it&#x27;s traditionally eaten on New Year&#x27;s for good luck.

<doc id="1240221" wikidata="Q559408" url="?curid=1240221" title="Yōkan">
<text>is a wagashi made of red bean paste, agar, and sugar. It is usually sold in a block form, and eaten in slices. There are two main types: &quot;neri yōkan&quot; and &quot;mizu yōkan&quot;. means &quot;water&quot;, and indicates that it is made with more water than usual. &quot;Mizu yōkan&quot; is usually chilled and eaten in the summer, however in Fukui prefecture it is customarily eaten in winter.

==Types==
Although yōkan found in Japan and abroad is typically made with red bean paste, yōkan made from is also relatively common. This type of yōkan is milky and translucent with a much milder flavour than that made of red bean paste. As such, it can be effectively flavoured and coloured by using green tea powder.

Yōkan may also contain chopped chestnuts, persimmons, whole sweetened azuki beans, figs, and sweet potato &quot;(imo yōkan)&quot;, among other additions. Sugar can also be replaced with honey, dark brown sugar, or molasses to alter the taste of the yōkan produced. There is also &quot;shio yōkan&quot;, which uses small amounts of salt.

==History==

During the Kamakura period (1185–1333), Japanese Buddhist monks who studied in the Song dynasty brought the tea culture to Japan, and the custom of eating confections with tea began in Japan.
The monks also introduced , a light meal, and the history book mentions , , and as . However, the manjū and yōkan brought to Japan by the monks were not sweets as we know them today, but were prepared in a completely different way.

Yōkan comes from the Chinese word &quot;yang geng&quot; (羊羹 &quot;sheep &quot;geng&quot;&quot;), which is a type of mutton soup. But since there was no custom of eating animal meat in Japan, the Japanese replaced the meat with a paste made of kneaded barley or azuki bean flour. Later, the soup was removed and replaced with a pasty confection made of barley or azuki bean flour. Finally, around 1800, during the Edo period (1603–1868), 500 years later, yōkan became what it is today.

The invention of in the 1600s was essential to the birth of modern yokan. Later, the kanten invented in Japan was introduced to Manchuria, Korea and Taiwan.

Yōkan is used as an ingredient in other foods, such as &quot;Siberia&quot;, a type of castella cake.

<doc id="1240224" wikidata="Q971928" url="?curid=1240224" title="Monaka">
<text>is a Japanese sweet made of azuki bean paste sandwiched between two thin crisp wafers made from mochi. The wafers can have the shape of a square, a triangle, or may be shaped like cherry blossoms, chrysanthemums, local landmarks, daruma, or other good luck symbols. 

Monaka is a type of dessert—&quot;wagashi&quot;—which is served with tea. There are still many very famous monaka specialty stores in Japan. The azuki bean paste filling in monaka can contain sesame seeds, chestnuts, or rice cake (mochi). 

==Modern variations==
Modern monaka can have an ice cream filling instead of azuki bean paste. Choco Monaka Jumbo is an ice cream dessert made with an ice cream and chocolate filling inside crispy mochi wafers. It was created in 1972 and is produced by Morinaga.

<doc id="1240241" wikidata="Q625892" url="?curid=1240241" title="Audio-Visions">
<text>Audio-Visions is the seventh studio album by American progressive rock band Kansas, released in 1980. The album was reissued in remastered format on CD in 1996 on Legacy/Epic and again in 2011, as a Japanese import vinyl-replica CD, as well as part of the Sony/Legacy domestic boxed set, &quot;Kansas Complete Album Collection 1974-1983&quot;, which packages all of the band&#x27;s original releases on Kirshner and affiliated labels CBS/Columbia.

Kerry Livgren&#x27;s recent conversion to Christianity is first heard on this album, primarily in the lyrics to &quot;Hold On&quot;, which was written as an evangelistic plea to his wife. That song was the original lineup&#x27;s last Top 40, peaking at No. 40 as the album&#x27;s first single. The second single from the album, &quot;Got to Rock On,&quot; charted outside the Top 40, and was released as a promo only 12&quot; single as well, featuring a live version of the song on Side B of the promotional single, taken from an ABC Radio &quot;the Source&quot; live concert broadcast from Chicago. In addition, another stop on the &quot;Audio-Visions&quot; tour was broadcast on the radio show &quot;A Night on the Road&quot;, from the Palladium in New York City. In addition to playing almost every song on the album on the tour, the band also played one selection each from Livgren and Walsh&#x27;s recent solo albums. While every song from the album &quot;Monolith&quot; was played during the early part of the Monolith tour in 1979, not a single song from &quot;Monolith&quot; was played on the Audio-Visions tour.

The eighth song on this album, &quot;No One Together&quot;, was originally intended for release on the previous album, &quot;Monolith&quot;, but it was dropped from that album due to an argument between Walsh and Livgren over whose song should be included there (with Walsh winning out the argument by having his song, &quot;How My Soul Cries Out for You&quot;, included) and wound up on this album instead.

The album was to be the last album with the band&#x27;s original lineup until 2000&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere to Elsewhere&quot;, and coincidentally the band&#x27;s latest studio album to be certified gold by the RIAA (which it did in December 1980).

In 2018, Friday Music released a 180-gram &quot;blue-splatter&quot; translucent vinyl remaster of the album, featuring a gatefold cover with the original sleeve artwork, and an insert in the first sleeve of a foldout poster of the album cover.

==Reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave a resoundingly negative review of the album, calling it &quot;the musically overwrought and lyrically fatuous product of a collective hubris gone haywire,&quot; and mockingly referring to Kerry Livgren as &quot;Kerry Liver.&quot; They contended that Kansas had lost all direction, with &quot;Hold On&quot; being the only track not lost in misdirected ambitions. 
AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann retrospectively remarked how &quot;nothing here matched the music from the group&#x27;s late-&#x27;70s heyday&quot;, probably due to the two main songwriters being distracted by their solo careers with Kansas &quot;becoming a part-time occupation&quot;.

&quot;Record World&quot; said the single &quot;Got to Rock On&quot; has &quot;a thunderous, driving beat and dynamic tempo shifts.&quot;

<text>The second USS &quot;Paul Jones&quot; was a in the United States Navy. She was named for John Paul Jones.

==Construction==
&quot;Paul Jones&quot; was laid down on 20 April 1899, by the Union Iron Works of San Francisco; launched on 14 June 1902; sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth Goldsborough Adams; and commissioned on 19 July 1902.

Originally built as a torpedo boat destroyer, &quot;Paul Jones&quot; served in the Pacific Fleet, homeported at San Francisco. A unit of the Pacific Torpedo Fleet, she was at San Francisco at the beginning of World War I.

==World War I==
&quot;Paul Jones&quot; sailed on 23 April 1917, for Norfolk, Virginia, via San Diego, Acapulco, the Panama Canal Zone, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, arriving on 3 August. On 4 August, she took station off the York River on patrol assignment until joining , , , , , , , and as escorts for Battleship Force, Atlantic Fleet, on 13 August, for passage to Bermuda and New York.

&quot;Paul Jones&quot; departed the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 24 August and reported to Newport, Rhode Island where she began a series of convoy patrols up and down the coast and returning to Newport on 24 September. She then commenced training operations, in conjunction with other duties, off Norfolk, Lynnhaven Roads, and Chesapeake Bay, prior to reporting to Philadelphia on 20 December.

On 15 January 1918, in company with &quot;Stewart&quot;, &quot;Hopkins&quot; and , &quot;Paul Jones&quot; sailed for the Azores by way of Bermuda. After departing Bermuda, she had to request permission to turn back due to a serious leak in her port after bunker. From 23–26 January, &quot;Paul Jones&quot;″ crew struggled against great odds and succeeded in saving the ship from sinking. Wallowing in stormy seas with her after fire room flooded, barely able to maintain headway, having lost all drinking and feed water and steaming under two boilers with salt feed, manning bucket brigades for lack of operable pumps, and receiving no answers to her distress signals, she finally sighted a light off St. David&#x27;s Head, Bermuda, signalled the fort for assistance and dropped her anchor.

&quot;Paul Jones&quot; remained at Bermuda until 22 February for repairs and then sailed for Philadelphia escorted by arriving on 25 February. Following permanent repairs at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, &quot;Paul Jones&quot; reported to Fortress Monroe, Virginia on 18 April, and performed various duties in and around the Chesapeake Bay until 6 August.

The highlight of &quot;Paul Jones&quot;″ career came on 2 July when was on fire in the Atlantic north of Bermuda and east of Virginia. &quot;Paul Jones&quot; made four trips from the burning ship to &quot;Von Steuben&quot; saving 1,250 Marines and officers together with over 50 tons of luggage. The next day she accompanied &quot;Henderson&quot; to Delaware Breakwater.

&quot;Paul Jones&quot; was involved in a friendly fire incident in the Atlantic Ocean in August 1918. She was escorting a convoy of 28 cargo ships on 7 August when at 15:00 the last ship in the convoy, the American armed cargo ship , which was slightly behind the rest of the convoy&#x27;s ships, sighted the U.S. Navy submarine on the surface behind the convoy and mistook her for a German submarine with a mast and sail set. U.S. Navy gunners aboard &quot;Jason&quot; opened fire on &quot;O-6&quot; with &quot;Jason&quot;′s gun at a range of . &quot;Jason&quot; fired eight rounds, scoring five hits. After the first hit, &quot;O-6&quot; attempted to dive, but the second hit struck her conning tower and started leaks that made it impossible for her to submerge. &quot;O-6&quot; blew her ballast tanks and returned to the surface. She flashed recognition signals by blinker light and members of her crew waved a United States flag on her deck. &quot;Jason&quot; reported that &quot;O-6&quot; fired six shots from her deck gun at &quot;Jason&quot;, apparently misinterpreting &quot;O-6&quot;′s recognition signals as gun flashes. Another of the convoy&#x27;s cargo ships also opened fire, and shell splashes from that ship&#x27;s gunfire fell short of &quot;O-6&quot; and may have appeared to &quot;Jason&quot;′s crew and gunners to have come from &quot;O-6&quot;. &quot;O-6&quot; stopped, and &quot;Jason&quot; ceased fire as she steamed out of range of &quot;O-6&quot;. &quot;Paul Jones&quot; meanwhile had reversed course and approached &quot;Jason&quot;, which signaled that she had a submarine in sight. &quot;Paul Jones&quot; then closed with &quot;O-6&quot; and opened gunfire, but all of her shots fell short, and she ceased fire when she closed to a range of and saw that &quot;O-6&quot; was flying a U.S. flag from her conning tower. &quot;Paul Jones&quot; came alongside &quot;O-6&quot; to render assistance. &quot;O-6&quot; suffered no casualties, but she had sustained serious damage, including to her compasses — which had been knocked out — and her steering gear. &quot;Paul Jones&quot; escorted her to port at the Delaware Breakwater, where they arrived on 8 August 1918.

&quot;Paul Jones&quot; reported at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 9 August 1918 and remained in and around the Chesapeake Bay conducting mine patrols, convoy duties, and other services until slated for inactivation on 31 January 1919. She decommissioned on 29 July; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September; and was sold on 3 January 1920 to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company, Philadelphia, who subsequently scrapped her.
