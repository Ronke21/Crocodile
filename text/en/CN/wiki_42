<text>Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color banding in images. Dither is routinely used in processing of both digital audio and video data, and is often one of the last stages of mastering audio to a CD.

A common use of dither is converting a grayscale image to black and white, so that the density of black dots in the new image approximates the average gray level in the original.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;dither&quot; was published in books on analog computation and hydraulically controlled guns shortly after World War II. Though he did not use the term &quot;dither&quot;, the concept of dithering to reduce quantization patterns was first applied by Lawrence G. Roberts in his 1961 MIT master&#x27;s thesis and 1962 article. By 1964 dither was being used in the modern sense described in this article. The technique was in use at least as early as 1915, though not under the name &quot;dither&quot;.

==In digital processing and waveform analysis==
Dither is utilized in many different fields where digital processing and analysis are used. These uses include systems using digital signal processing, such as digital audio, digital video, digital photography, seismology, radar and weather forecasting systems.

Quantization yields error. If that error is &quot;correlated&quot; to the signal, the result is potentially cyclical or predictable. In some fields, especially where the receptor is sensitive to such artifacts, cyclical errors yield undesirable artifacts. In these fields introducing dither converts the error to random noise. The field of audio is a primary example of this. The human ear functions much like a Fourier transform, wherein it hears individual frequencies. The ear is therefore very sensitive to distortion, or additional frequency content, but far less sensitive to additional random noise at all frequencies such as found in a dithered signal.

== Digital audio ==

In an analog system, the signal is &quot;continuous&quot;, but in a PCM digital system, the amplitude of the signal out of the digital system is limited to one of a set of fixed values or numbers. This process is called quantization. Each coded value is a discrete step... if a signal is quantized without using dither, there will be quantization distortion related to the original input signal... In order to prevent this, the signal is &quot;dithered&quot;, a process that mathematically removes the harmonics or other highly undesirable distortions entirely, and that replaces it with a constant, fixed noise level.

The final version of audio that goes onto a compact disc contains only 16 bits per sample, but throughout the production process, a greater number of bits are typically used to represent the sample, this must be reduced to 16 bits to make the CD.

There are multiple ways to do this. One can, for example, simply discard the excess bits – called &quot;truncation.&quot; One can also &quot;round&quot; the excess bits to the nearest value. Each of these methods, however, results in predictable and determinable errors in the result. Using dither replaces these errors with a constant, fixed noise level.

=== Examples ===

Take, for example, a waveform that consists of the following values:

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

If the waveform is reduced by 20%, then the following are the new values:

 0.8 1.6 2.4 3.2 4.0 4.8 5.6 6.4

If these values are truncated it results in the following data:

 0 1 2 3 4 4 5 6

If these values are rounded instead it results in the following data:

 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 6

For any original waveform, the process of reducing the waveform amplitude by 20% results in regular errors. Take for example a sine wave that, for some portion, matches the values above. Every time the sine wave&#x27;s value hit 3.2, the truncated result would be off by 0.2, as in the sample data above. Every time the sine wave&#x27;s value hit 4.0, there would be no error since the truncated result would be off by 0.0, also shown above. The magnitude of this error changes regularly and repeatedly throughout the sine wave&#x27;s cycle. It is precisely this error that manifests itself as distortion. What the ear hears as distortion is the additional content at discrete frequencies created by the regular and repeated quantization error.

A plausible solution would be to take the 2 digit number (say, 4.8) and round it one direction or the other. For example, it could be rounded to 5 one time and then 4 the next time. This would make the long-term average 4.5 instead of 4, so that over the long-term the value is closer to its actual value. This, on the other hand, still results in determinable (though more complicated) error. Every other time the value 4.8 comes up the result is an error of 0.2, and the other times it is −0.8. This still results in a repeating, quantifiable error.

Another plausible solution would be to take 4.8 and round it so that the first four times out of five it is rounded up to 5, and the fifth time it is rounded to 4. This would average out to exactly 4.8 over the long term. Unfortunately, however, it still results in repeatable and determinable errors, and those errors still manifest themselves as distortion to the ear.

This leads to the &quot;dither&quot; solution. Rather than predictably rounding up or down in a repeating pattern, it is possible to round up or down in a random pattern. If a series of random numbers between 0.0 and 0.9 (ex: 0.6, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, etc.) is generated and added to the 4.8, two times out of ten the result will truncate back to 4 (if 0.0 or 0.1 are added to 4.8) and eight times out of ten it will truncate to 5. Each given situation has a random 20% chance of rounding to 4 or 80% chance of rounding to 5. Over the long haul, these results will average to 4.8 and their quantization error will be random noise. This noise is less offensive to the ear than the determinable distortion that other solutions would produce.

=== Usage ===
Dither is added before any quantization or re-quantization process, in order to de-correlate the quantization noise from the input signal and to prevent non-linear behavior (distortion). Quantization with lesser bit depth requires higher amounts of dither. The result of the process still yields distortion, but the distortion is of a random nature so the resulting noise is, effectively, de-correlated from the intended signal.

In a seminal paper published in the AES Journal, Lipshitz and Vanderkooy pointed out that different noise types, with different probability density functions (PDFs) behave differently when used as dither signals, and suggested optimal levels of dither signal for audio. Gaussian noise requires a higher level of added noise for full elimination of audible distortion than noise with rectangular or triangular distribution. Triangular distributed noise also minimizes &quot;noise modulation&quot;audible changes in the volume level of residual noise behind quiet music that draw attention to the noise.

Dither can be useful to break up periodic limit cycles, which are a common problem in digital filters. Random noise is typically less objectionable than the harmonic tones produced by limit cycles.

=== Noise distributions ===
Rectangular probability density function (RPDF) dither noise has a uniform distribution; any value in the specified range has the same probability of occurring.

Triangular probability density function (TPDF) dither noise has a triangular distribution; values in the center of the range have a higher probability of occurring. Triangular distribution can be achieved by adding two independent RPDF sources.

Gaussian PDF has a normal distribution. The relationship of probabilities of results follows a bell-shaped, or Gaussian curve, typical of dither generated by analog sources such as microphone preamplifiers. If the bit depth of a recording is sufficiently great, that preamplifier noise will be sufficient to dither the recording.

Noise shaping is a filtering process that shapes the spectral energy of quantization error, typically to either de-emphasize frequencies to which the ear is most sensitive or separate the signal and noise bands completely. If dither is used, its final spectrum depends on whether it is added inside or outside the feedback loop of the noise shaper. If inside, the dither is treated as part of the error signal and shaped along with actual quantization error. If outside, the dither is treated as part of the original signal and linearises quantization without being shaped itself. In this case, the final noise floor is the sum of the flat dither spectrum and the shaped quantization noise. While real-world noise shaping usually includes in-loop dithering, it is also possible to use it without adding dither at all, in which case quantization error is evident at low signal levels.

Colored dither is sometimes mentioned as dither that has been filtered to be different from white noise. Noise shaping is one such application.

==== Which noise distribution to use ====
If the signal being dithered is to undergo further processing, then it should be processed with a triangular-type dither that has an amplitude of two quantization steps so that the dither values computed range from, for example, −1 to +1, or 0 to 2. This is the lowest power ideal dither, in that it does not introduce noise modulation (which would manifest as a constant noise floor), and eliminates the harmonic distortion from quantization. If a &quot;colored&quot; dither is used instead at these intermediate processing stages, then frequency content may bleed into other frequency ranges that are more noticeable and become distractingly audible.

If the signal being dithered is to undergo no further processing – if it is being dithered to its final result for distribution – then a &quot;colored&quot; dither or noise shaping is appropriate. This can effectively lower the audible noise level, by putting most of that noise in a frequency range where it is less critical.

== Digital photography and image processing ==
Dithering is used in computer graphics to create the illusion of color depth in images on systems with a limited color palette. In a dithered image, colors that are not available in the palette are approximated by a diffusion of colored pixels from within the available palette. The human eye perceives the diffusion as a mixture of the colors within it (see color vision). Dithered images, particularly those using palettes with relatively few colors, can often be distinguished by a characteristic graininess or speckled appearance.

Dithering introduces noise or a pattern into an image, and often the patterning is visible. In these circumstances, it has been shown that dither generated from blue noise is the least unsightly and distracting. The error diffusion techniques were some of the first methods to generate blue-noise dithering patterns. However, other techniques such as ordered dithering can also generate blue-noise dithering without the tendency to degenerate into areas with artifacts.

=== Examples ===

Reducing the color depth of an image can have significant visual side effects. If the original image is a photograph, it is likely to have thousands or even millions of distinct colors. The process of constraining the available colors to a specific color palette effectively throws away a certain amount of color information.

A number of factors can affect the resulting quality of a color-reduced image. Perhaps most significant is the color palette that will be used in the reduced image. For example, an original image (&quot;Figure 1&quot;) may be reduced to the 216-color web-safe palette. If the original pixel colors are simply translated into the closest available color from the palette, no dithering will occur (&quot;Figure 2&quot;). However, typically this approach will result in flat areas (contours) and a loss of detail and may produce patches of color that are significantly different from the original. Shaded or gradient areas may produce color banding which may be distracting. The application of dithering can help to minimize such visual artifacts and usually results in a better representation of the original (&quot;Figure 3&quot;). Dithering helps to reduce color banding and flatness.

One of the problems associated with using a fixed color palette is that many of the needed colors may not be available in the palette, and many of the available colors may not be needed; a fixed palette containing mostly shades of green would not be well-suited for an image of a desert, for instance. The use of an optimized color palette can be of benefit in such cases. An optimized color palette is one in which the available colors are chosen based on how frequently they are used in the original source image. If the image is reduced based on an optimized palette the result is often much closer to the original (&quot;Figure 4&quot;).

The number of colors available in the palette is also a contributing factor. If, for example, the palette is limited to only 16 colors then the resulting image could suffer from additional loss of detail, resulting in even more pronounced problems with flatness and color banding (&quot;Figure 5&quot;). Once again, dithering can help to minimize such artifacts (&quot;Figure 6&quot;).

=== Applications ===
One common application of dithering is to more accurately display graphics containing a greater range of colors than the display hardware is capable of showing. For example, dithering might be used in order to display a photographic image containing millions of colors on video hardware that is only capable of showing 256 colors at a time. The 256 available colors would be used to generate a dithered approximation of the original image. Without dithering, the colors in the original image would be quantized to the closest available color, resulting in a displayed image that is a poor representation of the original.

The very earliest uses were to reduce images to 1-bit black and white. This may have been done for printing even earlier than for bit-mapped video graphics. It was common for making images to display on 1-bit video displays for X and Apollo and similar Unix workstations. The dithering was usually pre-computed and only the dithered image was stored; computation and memory were far too limited to compute it &quot;live&quot;.

An example home computer users may have seen was emulation of lower resolution CGA 4 color graphics on higher resolution monochrome Hercules graphics cards, with the colors being translated to ordered dither patterns.

Some liquid-crystal displays use temporal dithering to achieve a similar effect. By alternating each pixel&#x27;s color value rapidly between two approximate colors in the panel&#x27;s color space, a display panel that natively supports only 18-bit color (6 bits per channel) can represent a 24-bit color image (8 bits per channel).

Dithering such as this, in which the computer&#x27;s display hardware is the primary limitation on color depth, is commonly employed in software such as web browsers. Since a web browser may be retrieving graphical elements from an external source, it may be necessary for the browser to perform dithering on images with too many colors for the available display. It was due to problems with dithering that a color palette known as the web-safe color palette was identified, for use in choosing colors that would not be dithered on systems capable of displaying only 256 colors simultaneously.

But even when the total number of available colors in the display hardware is high enough to properly render full-color digital photographs, banding may still be evident to the eye, especially in large areas of smooth shade transitions. Modest dithering can resolve this without making the image appear grainy. High-end still image processing software commonly uses these techniques for improved display.

Another useful application of dithering is for situations in which the graphics file format is the limiting factor. In particular, the commonly used GIF format is restricted to the use of 256 or fewer colors. Images such as these have a defined color palette containing a limited number of colors that the image may use. For such situations, graphical editing software may be responsible for dithering images prior to saving them in such restrictive formats.

Dithering is analogous to the halftone technique used in printing. For this reason, the term &quot;dithering&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with the term &quot;halftoning&quot;, particularly in association with digital printing.

The ability of inkjet printers to print isolated dots has increased the use of dithering in printing. A typical desktop inkjet printer can print, at most, just 16 colors as this is the combination of dot or no dot from cyan, magenta, yellow and black print heads. To reproduce a large range of colors, dithering is used. In densely printed areas, where the color is dark the dithering is not always visible because the dots of ink merge producing a more uniform print. However, a close inspection of the light areas of a print where dots are further apart reveals dithering patterns.

=== Algorithms ===
There are several algorithms designed to perform dithering. One of the earliest, and still one of the most popular, is the Floyd–Steinberg dithering algorithm, which was developed in 1975. One of the strengths of this algorithm is that it minimizes visual artifacts through an error-diffusion process; error-diffusion algorithms typically produce images that more closely represent the original than simpler dithering algorithms.

Dithering methods include:
* &quot;Thresholding&quot; (also average dithering): each pixel value is compared against a fixed threshold. This may be the simplest dithering algorithm there is, but it results in immense loss of detail and contouring.
* &quot;Random dithering&quot; was the first attempt (at least as early as 1951) to remedy the drawbacks of thresholding. Each pixel value is compared against a random threshold, resulting in a staticky image. Although this method does not generate patterned artifacts, the noise tends to swamp the detail of the image. It is analogous to the practice of mezzotinting.
* &quot;Patterning&quot; dithers using a fixed pattern. For each of the input values, a fixed pattern is placed in the output image. The biggest disadvantage of this technique is that the output image is larger (by a factor of the fixed pattern size) than the input pattern.
* &quot;Ordered dithering&quot; dithers using a &quot;dither matrix&quot;. For every pixel in the image, the value of the pattern at the corresponding location is used as a threshold. Neighboring pixels do not affect each other, making this form of dithering suitable for use in animations. Different patterns can generate completely different dithering effects. Though simple to implement, this dithering algorithm is not easily changed to work with free-form, arbitrary palettes.
** A &quot;halftone dithering&quot; matrix produces a look similar to that of halftone screening in newspapers. This is a form of clustered dithering, in that dots tend to cluster together. This can help hide the adverse effects of blurry pixels found on some older output devices. The primary use for this method is in offset printing and laser printers. In both these devices, the ink or toner prefers to clump together and will not form the isolated dots generated by the other dithering methods. 
** A &quot;Bayer matrix&quot; produces a very distinctive cross-hatch pattern.
** A matrix tuned for &quot;blue noise&quot;, such as those generated by the &quot;void-and-cluster&quot; method, produces a look closer to that of an error diffusion dither method. 

* &quot;Error-diffusion dithering&quot; is a feedback process that diffuses the quantization error to neighboring pixels.
**Floyd–Steinberg (FS) dithering only diffuses the error to neighboring pixels. This results in very fine-grained dithering.
**Minimized average error dithering by Jarvis, Judice, and Ninke diffuses the error also to pixels one step further away. The dithering is coarser but has fewer visual artifacts. However, it is slower than Floyd–Steinberg dithering, because it distributes errors among 12 nearby pixels instead of 4 nearby pixels for Floyd–Steinberg.
**Stucki dithering is based on the above, but is slightly faster. Its output tends to be clean and sharp.
**Burkes dithering is a simplified form of Stucki dithering that is faster, but is less clean than Stucki dithering.

* Error-diffusion dithering (continued):
**Sierra dithering is based on Jarvis dithering, but it is faster while giving similar results.
**&quot;Two-row Sierra&quot; is the above method but was modified by Sierra to improve its speed.
**&quot;Filter Lite&quot; is an algorithm by Sierra that is much simpler and faster than Floyd–Steinberg, while still yielding similar results.
**Atkinson dithering was developed by Apple programmer Bill Atkinson, and resembles Jarvis dithering and Sierra dithering, but it is faster. Another difference is that it does not diffuse the entire quantization error, but only three quarters. It tends to preserve detail well, but very light and dark areas may appear blown out.
**Gradient-based error-diffusion dithering was developed in 2016 to remove the structural artifact produced in the original FS algorithm by a modulated randomization, and to enhance the structures by a gradient-based diffusion modulation.

* &quot;Dithering methods based on physical models&quot;:
** Lattice-Boltzmann Dithering is based on Lattice Boltzmann methods and was developed to provide a rotationally invariant alternative to Error-diffusion dithering 
** Electrostatic Halftoning is modeled after the principles of Electrostatics, which has a low approximation error and creates few visual artifacts
== Other applications ==

Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is a nonlinear optical effect that limits the launched optical power in fiber optic systems. This power limit can be increased by dithering the transmit optical center frequency, typically implemented by modulating the laser&#x27;s bias input. See also polarization scrambling.

Phase dithering can be used to improve the quality of the output in direct digital synthesis. Another common application is to get through EMC tests by using spread spectrum clock dithering of frequency to smear out single frequency peaks.

Another type of temporal dithering has recently been introduced in financial markets, in order to reduce the incentive to engage in high-frequency trading. ParFX, a London foreign exchange market that began trading in 2013, imposes brief random delays on all incoming orders; other currency exchanges are reportedly experimenting with the technique. The use of such temporal buffering or dithering has been advocated more broadly in financial trading of equities, commodities, and derivatives.

<doc id="1243528" wikidata="Q337412" url="?curid=1243528" title="Acadie–Bathurst Titan">
<text>The Acadie–Bathurst Titan are a Canadian junior ice hockey team in the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) based in Bathurst, New Brunswick. They are members of the Maritimes Division, and play their home games at the K. C. Irving Regional Centre. The Titan won the 2018 Memorial Cup and have two President&#x27;s Cup championships in franchise history: 1999 and 2018.

The Titan were sold in December 2024, and will relocate to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, for the 2025–26 season, where they will play as the Newfoundland Regiment.

==History==
The franchise was granted in 1969–70 as the Rosemont National. In 1971, they moved from Rosemont to Laval to become the Laval National, and later the Laval Voisins. In 1985, they became the Laval Titan, and in 1994, they became the Laval Titan Collège Français following a merger with the Verdun Collège Français, and then in 1998, they moved to Bathurst. The &quot;Acadie&quot; term in the team name refers to the city&#x27;s surroundings, where the Acadian population is a majority.

The franchise has won five President&#x27;s Cups, one of which (in 1999) came during the team&#x27;s tenure in Bathurst. In the Memorial Cup that year, the team finished winless in the round-robin. The most famous player that has come through the organization would undoubtedly be Mario Lemieux, who was drafted in 1984 by the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL). Lemieux played for the team during its tenure in Laval. Other famous franchise alumni include Mike Bossy, Gino Odjick and Vincent Damphousse. Notable NHL alumni from Bathurst include Patrice Bergeron, François Beauchemin, Bruno Gervais and Roberto Luongo.

In the 1999–2000 season, the Titan had the first female to be drafted by a QMJHL team, Charline Labonté, a 17-year-old Quebec goaltender who spent parts of two seasons with the team.

In 2009, the team was rumored to move to Newfoundland to replace the departed St. John&#x27;s Fog Devils. At the end of the 2009–10 season, Léo-Guy Morrissette bought back control of the team from his children at their request. He retained ownership of the team through to April 2013, and local investors including NHL player Sean Couturier purchased the team. At the time of the sale, the team was reported to be worth just over $3 million.

The Titan play in the smallest market in the Canadian Hockey League, with a population of 13,424 residents. In 2018, the team won its first Memorial Cup championship, defeating the Regina Pats in the centennial edition of the tournament, coached by Mario Pouliot. After their Memorial Cup win, coach Mario Pouliot made this comment: &quot;Being the smallest market in the entire CHL, it&#x27;s a huge accomplishment for us. Four years ago we started from the bottom and we ended up tonight with the Memorial Cup...&quot;

In 2021, the owners tried to sell the team, but received no offers. In the same year, the city of Bathurst announced $175,000 in grants to the team. Attendance averaged more than 3,000 spectators per game in the early 2000s, but declined to 1,627 spectators per game for the 2023–24 season. Team owners had annual deficits in the thousands of dollars, but could not find a local buyer. Owners had hired Ernst &amp; Young to conduct a search for new local ownership to no avail.

On December 16, 2024, the QMJHL approved the sale of the team to a group of investors led by Glenn Stanford, who will relocate the team to the Mary Brown&#x27;s Centre in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, for the 2025–26 season. QMJHL commissioner Mario Cecchini had previously stated he would veto any sale that involving relocation, but the sale was approved when no serious offers would see the team remain in Bathurst.

<doc id="1243530" wikidata="Q12411192" url="?curid=1243530" title="Israeli hip-hop">
<text>Israeli hip hop refers to hip hop and rap music in Israel. Israeli hip hop artists enjoy wide popularity in Israel and have succeeded in appealing to international markets particularly the United States.

The genre began gaining popularity in Israel during the 1990s, influenced by global hip hop trends. However, traces of native Hebrew hip hop can be found as early as the mid-1980s. Yair Nitzani, then a member of the Israeli rock group Tislam, released an old-school hip hop parody album under the name &quot;Hashem Tamid&quot;. This early work was influenced by New York&#x27;s hip hop scene. In 1993, Nigel Haadmor and Yossi Fine produced the album &quot;Humus Metamtem&quot;, further establishing the genre in Israel. Haadmor, born Yehoshua Sofer, brought a unique sound influenced by his Caribbean roots and Jewish heritage.

A significant milestone in Israeli hip hop was the establishment of the radio show &quot;Esek Shachor&quot; (Black Business) in 1995 by Quami De La Fox (Eyal Freedman) and DJ Liron Teeni on Galgalatz, the Israeli Army&#x27;s radio station. This show played a mix of Hebrew, Arabic, and English hip hop and became highly popular, significantly influencing the Israeli hip hop scene. Teeni is credited with encouraging artists to rap in Hebrew, thus making the genre more authentic to Israeli culture and accessible to the local audience.

The first notable Israeli hip hop group, Shabak Samech, began rapping in Hebrew in 1995, inspired by the Beastie Boys. Initially, their music was met with resistance, but they persevered and eventually found success. Israeli hip hop often addresses themes unique to the country&#x27;s social and political landscape, including the struggles of growing up in Israel, spirituality, and politics.

Although Native Hebrew hip hop gained popularity only during the 1990s, stemming from global influences, traces of it could be found during the mid-1980s. Yair Nitzani, then a member of the Israeli rock group, &quot;Tislam&quot;, released an old school hip hop parody album under the name &quot;Hashem Tamid&quot;. Nitzani was mainly influenced from New York old school Hip Hop. In 1993, Nigel Haadmor and Yossi Fine, influenced by Eric B &amp; Rakim and Flame-3 of the TPA Crew and other late 1980s Hip Hop, produced the album &quot;Humus Metamtem&quot;, which was released by Yair Nitzani. Yossi Fine later immigrated to New York, where he played as a bassist with artists such as David Bowie, Naughty by Nature and Lou Reed. Nigel Haadmor is the pseudonym of Yehoshua Sofer, a Jewish-Jamaican Broslov Hasidic Jew who was born in Jamaica and raised in Jamaica, the U.S., and Israel. Influenced by his mother, who listened to Jamaican ska at home, Haadmor produced a unique sound based on his Caribbean roots living in the Jewish state.

In 1995, the Beastie Boys toured Israel and were interviewed by Quami de la Fox (Eyal Freedman) on Galgalatz, the Israeli Army&#x27;s radio station and most popular radio station of that time. After the interview, Quami de la Fox created a Hebrew parody of their song “So What’cha Want” to promote their tour in Israel. Later that year Quami de la Fox collaborated with DJ Liron Teeni, also a host on the Galgalatz station, to produce Esek Shachor (Black Business) – the first all hip hop radio show in Israel. Playing a mix of Hebrew, Arabic and English hip hop, by 2000 Esek Shachor “was the most popular program on Galgalatz and today remains a leader in Israel’s hip-hop world.”

Just as Kool Herc is credited in America as being a founding father of hip hop, DJ Liron Teeni is given similar credit as the pioneer of Israeli hip-hop. His major role in the process of making Israeli hip hop the popular genre it is in Israel today was the transformation of the lyrics to the mother tongue of Hebrew. Kids would come on his show on the army radio station in order to showcase their rapping skills, but when they would start rapping in English, he would make them translate it into Hebrew. Because rappers began to rap in English, it was seen as an American export which was not authentic to the music of Israel.

Popular rock band Shabak Samech is credited with being the first Israeli hip hop group, and began rapping in Hebrew in 1995. Influenced by the Beastie Boys, their lyrics did not have any specific political or social message and were mostly party lyrics. Israeli listeners initially rejected their music. Chemi Arzi, one of the band members, recalls, “‘They said you just can’t rap in Hebrew; it doesn’t sound good.’” Shabak Samech continued to produce Hebrew-language rap songs in efforts to promote this new style of Hebrew and Mediterranean hip hop. The band was initially marginalized due to the belief of Israeli DJs that their audiences would be lost, but they eventually reached success.

While Israeli hip hop may be seem to have common underlying themes with US hip hop and they share the main elements of hip hop, mainstream hip hop in Israel tends to deal mainly with the situation in the country, spirituality, or politics. Israeli rappers talk about more personal issues such as the struggles of growing up in Israel. Most Jewish Rappers tends to disregard the political situation between Arabs and Jews, yet they refer frequently to the economic situations in the country. Since 2001, with the rising of new Hip Hop acts, most issues are dealing with creation, essence of Hip Hop, street culture, drugs, hedonism, etc.

Some of the songs also gear towards more religious themes since many of the rappers are Jewish or Muslim. Israeli hip hop has such a motivational theme behind it that local governments support the Hip Hop movement that has exploded among Israeli youth. The government has even supported Hip Hop groups who travel to other countries, viewing it as a good outlet for the rest of the world to view them through. Israeli Hip Hop is creating several positive movements among the people of the country that will continue to grow and become even more popular. Some of the things the Israeli rappers rap about can tend to be controversial as well. As far as media exposure of artists who address real issues like child abuse or the future of the state of Israel is concerned, Israeli artists seem to have the same problems getting heard as artists in America; they address current issues but don&#x27;t get much attention from the radio stations that play popular music or television stations. Before Hip Hop was considered a genre in Israel, pop and disco music were the only genres being played on the radio. When Hip Hop songs started becoming popular, the radio stations refused to play them. They felt that Hip Hop didn&#x27;t make people feel good so they would not play it. The songs spoke of everything from terrorism and religion to children speaking up about abuse in their home. And as far as the ongoing conflict between the Arab population and the Jewish population, hip hop music seems to document this more accurately from various viewpoints than any other popular music or news medium in Israel. Even the conflict between Arab and Israeli rappers is documented in films such as Channels of Rage which showcases Subliminal and an Arab-Israeli named MC Tamer Nafer whose friendship ended due to political tension.

==&quot;Black Business&quot; radio show==

Black Business (Hebrew: עסק שחור &quot;Esek Shakhor&quot;) is a hip hop radio show, started in 1996, by Liron Teeni and Quami De La Fox. The show broadcast on Galgalatz, the sister-station of Galei-Zahal — the Israeli military radio station.
Back in the &#x27;90s, young Israeli rappers, such as cynical-parodic Jerusalem rapper Kodman who was still a kid at the time, as well as most of today&#x27;s esteemed/famous rappers, all started their career on the show.
The rappers started coming on his show in order to showcase their live freestyle and rhyme skills, to be heard rapping. Some rappers such as Subliminal were rapping in English, and Tenni and others wanted Israeli rap to be in their native language of Hebrew since there were thousands of American groups rapping better in English.

==Hip hop for Ethiopian-Israeli youth==
Since the 1990s, Ethiopian-Israeli teenagers used the rising reggae and hip hop scenes as a means of forming a community and a sense of belonging. Tel Aviv nightclubs proved to be places of social gathering for Ethiopian-Israeli teenagers, giving them a space to gather and form a collective identity. Teenagers and young adults were able to identify with the black struggle of the music and felt reggae and rap reflected their own experiences. Through identification with historically black American musical styles, Anthropologist Malka Shabtay writes,
Young Ethiopians living in Israel have… transformed their collective and personal experiences of alienation, both real and imagined, into an ideology identifying themselves as the blacks in Israeli society and attributing the relatively poor achievements of Ethiopians and their sense of inferiority and failure to racism. Their language of disappointment, disillusionment and hostility is addressed to those they hold responsible for their situation. They believe Israelis to be prejudiced towards them and see in them the reason that their chances of achieving integration are low: ‘You feel betrayed and are called ‘n-gger’. You made it to Israel and it doesn’t work.’

Identification with the African-American struggle, mainly through music, formed a sense of community and identity among Ethiopian-Israeli teenagers. “Their search for a home is temporarily satisfied by reggae and rap… This encounter with black musical genres is a matter not only of musical taste, but of self-image and image in the eyes of others.” Ethiopian-Israeli reggae and rap, reflecting struggles and racism of daily life of these teenagers, provides a sense of community and identification among Ethiopian-Israeli youth.
Ethiopian Israeli hip-hop groups, and artists like Cafe Shachor Hazak, Axum, Jeremy Cool Habash, and others have become very popular amongst all Israelis, and are growing in popularity as Ethiopian Jews integrate into mainstream Israeli society.

Strong Black Coffee (&quot;Café Shahor Hazak&quot;; קפה שחור חזק) is an Ethiopian-Israeli hip hop duo. The duo were a nominee for the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards Best Israeli Act award.

==Hip hop as a method of globalization==
Though hip-hop has been adopted by numerous countries throughout the world, Israel remains as a prime example of the manifestation of “glocalization” in the musical realm. Originally hailing from the Japanese business world, this concept was introduced to the Western world by British sociologist Roland Robertson in the early 1990s. As explained by Hartwig Vens in his article in the World Press, the idea of globalization describes the “rising appearance of artistic hybrids that blend the global and the local” which accurately portray the interplay between these seemingly conflicting scenes. By recognizing the dual nature of glocalization, hip-hop&#x27;s role within Israeli society can be revealed to show its nature of meshing opposing forces to form a creative and original product. Consistent with Vens’ claim, Israeli hip-hop is thus an imitated art, largely globalized and affected tremendously by the United States, while still displaying distinct characteristics specific to Israeli society and culture.

Many of Israel&#x27;s hip-hop artists thus reflect upon the integration of global and local influences into their music. Global forces have thus proven to be powerful in affecting and shaping hip-hop in Israel. Even the beginnings of rap music in Israel portray the dominant and significant nature of the Western world on global music. Even once it was first presented on the show, the performers still maintained hip-hop&#x27;s American origins by rapping solely in English. Only once hip-hop expanded to include other music artists was Hebrew utilized as a language to spread person opinions and beliefs of society. Even then, English was still used as an effective means of rapping and reaching audiences, and many Israeli hip-hop songs today incorporate some aspects of English lyrics or colloquial terms into their content.

Though numerous examples are available, one specific music video exemplifies this phenomenon of language thoroughly. In his video for the song, “Bababa,” Subliminal incorporates various musical elements into his performance, including the talents of Miri Ben-Ari on violin. The first thirty seconds of lyrics rapped are entirely in English and could easily be mistaken for a hip-hop song written and produced in America. Such lyrics as “all my real” and “one is for the money, two is for the show…five for that flow” reveal the immense effect American hip-hop has on music produced halfway around the globe. The music video additionally displays other elements of Americanization including the mention of the Grammys and the presentation of the actors as stereotypical members of the hip-hop subculture. One such African-American man is shown wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap, and scantily clad women dancing throughout the video is representative of the stereotypical American hip-hop culture. Within another one of his music videos, “Toro,” Subliminal further expresses qualities of the Western world. Not only is the video reminiscent of hip-hop in the United States, but it holds some elements of reggaeton and Hispanic roots, especially when explicitly mentioning the word “dinero” in the chorus (Spanish for “money”).

Therefore, throughout Israeli hip-hop music, the borrowing from America is quite apparent in the common usage of English language and slang terms in lyrics, as well as through the incorporation of certain American hip-hop culture elements such as break dancing and specific clothing. Not only has Israel maintained a relationship with the United States in its Americanization and adoption of Western qualities, but it has dispersed its own artifacts to America. Though it surfaced only a decade ago, Israeli hip-hop has successfully spread to the United States, primarily through the fan base of young Jewish Zionists living in America. Specific artists, especially Hadag Nachash and Subliminal, have accumulated fans in America and often travel worldwide (and primarily to the US) on tours to further promote their music. Strong connections are present between America and Israel, mostly due to the grounds upon which Israel was established. Since its creation as a state was a result of the Zionist movement, many Jewish Zionists living in the United States feel a strong sense of pride and personal relationship with their religious homeland. Zionist youths primarily are therefore very involved in the current political and social situations occurring in Israel.
Furthermore, they are extremely receptive to any cultural artifacts being produced and released by Israel&#x27;s music industry, so the hip-hop music of Israeli artists easily thrives within the American Jewish youth population. Thus, many are thrilled when Israeli hip-hop artists come to America to perform and often sing the lyrics along with the performer.

Just as Israeli hip-hop portrays the global trends present in the current times, situations and qualities personal to this specific country are inherently incorporated into the songs and lyrics. As issues such as politics and religion are being fought through the usage of hip-hop, Israeli rap artists display a wide range of opinions being offered and performed. Just as explained by Liron Teeni, the radio DJ who first introduced American hip-hop to America, this variety of perspectives merely reflect the true reality, since “rappers are taking sides on the issue..hip-hop is about being brave, telling the truth like it is and not looking for excuses…just talking about the real stuff.” Discussions of this “real stuff” portrayed in Israeli hip-hop vary from political divides to social tensions and religious fights. Though the music has been maintained as a space for stratified opinionated beliefs, perhaps it holds the power of ultimately uniting those involved in some of these divisions.

One song commenting on the political, religious, and social tensions in Israel is Hadag Nachash’s “Shirat Hasticker,” literally meaning, “The Sticker Song,” has proven to be one of the most popular rap songs, both in Israel and the United States. Unique in its content, the song is entirely composed of various bumper stickers found on cars in Israel. Since bumper stickers are very popular in Israel and are often placed on cars to display the driver&#x27;s political, religious, and social stances, Hadag Nachash accurately portrays the country&#x27;s numerous perspectives on all localized issues. By collecting a variety of these bumper stickers and listing them as lyrics in the song, opinions as broad as the citizens within Israel are effectively expressed in the one song alone.

While discussing the relationship between global and local influences on Israeli hip-hop to create the effect of “glocalization,” one music video in particular precisely reveals this phenomenon. “Halayla Zeh Ha’zman,” (or “Tonight is the Time”) performed by Alon De Loco and Gad Elbaz, effectively presents the manner in which glocalization has encompassed Israeli hip-hop. Opening with a seeming stand-off between Palestinians and overtly religious Orthodox Jews, the video begins with obvious influences from American hip-hop, primarily in the break dancing performed by both groups and the clothing reminiscent of American style (such as the Puma shirt and the “bling”). The song continues to illustrate glocalization through the incorporation of Middle Eastern sounding beats and rhythms, and the chorus is sung in a voice reminiscent of many Israeli musicians and singers. Thus, the music video acts as a clear representation of how elements derived from global and local sources are utilized in Israel, so as to create a unique hip-hop subculture.

==Israeli rappers==

===BOCA===
BOCA was born in 1991 in the Soviet Union, and immigrated to Israel at the age of 1 month.
In 2004, he moved with his parents to Bucharest, Romania.
He started participating in hip hop competitions for the first time when rap was still a hobby for him.
Boca returned to Israel in 2006 and continued to rap.
His song &quot;Lod Bypass&quot; was recognized in different countries and was played on radio stations in Israel.
In 2010 he released his first mix tape &quot;7 Days&quot; which contained six songs that were created in seven days.
A little later, he released the club hit &quot;Della Bocca&quot;with DJ Braindead. His second mixtape &quot;My World Your World&quot; contained 14 tracks.
On January 6, 2011, he issued the album I.H.H.A - Israeli Hip Hop Airlines, which contained 9 tracks.

===Hadag Nahash===
Hadag Nachash (Hebrew: הדג נחש, English: &quot;The Snake Fish”) formed in 1996 was one of the first rap groups to hit the mainstream in Israel. A sprouting Palestinian scene grew alongside them. Their sound consists of a mixture of Funk, Jazz, world music and western pop. They have been compared frequently to the American hip hop group The Roots since they use a live band instead of a DJ for their backup music. In contrast to the patriotic &quot;Zionist&quot; hip-hop of artists like Subliminal (see below), Hadag Nakhash&#x27;s music is often satirical and sometimes comes from a left-wing perspective. Two examples for that would be their songs &quot;Gabi &amp; Debi&quot; (Hebrew) which spoofs right-wing Zionist rap music, and &quot;Little man&quot; (English) depicting the despair from the religious collisions in the city of Jerusalem&quot;.

===Subliminal===

Kobi Shimoni, more commonly known as Subliminal (Hebrew: סאבלימינל), is among the most popular rappers in Israel. He has been described as &quot;Israel&#x27;s Eminem&quot;. The album “The Light and the Shadow” with partner The Shadow has sold 80,000 Records in Israel which is a double Platinum Album. Subliminal was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. He started performing music at age 12, and at age 15 met Yoav Eliasi, who would later become his performing partner under the name &quot;The Shadow&quot; (Ha&#x27;Tzel). The two quickly became friends as a result of their mutual love of hip-hop. In 1995 the two began performing in Israeli clubs wearing baggy clothes and gold chains. They quickly developed a following among the nation&#x27;s youth, and put out their first album, &quot;The Light From Zion&quot;. After the outbreak of the violent uprising in 2000 they wrote patriotic songs. They became known as creators of &quot;Zionist hip-hop&quot;. In further contrast to the generally rebellious, &quot;outlaw&quot; nature of most hip-hop, they also praise army service and eschew drugs and smoking. With occasional Arabic lyrics and songs like &quot;Peace in the Middle East&quot;, their stance is described as desirous of a better future but unapologetic about the present. Subliminal and Ha&#x27;Tzel also helped discover the Palestinian rapper Tamer Nafar; they collaborated but eventually fell out over political differences. The bitter end of their musical relationship is chronicled in the documentary &quot;Channels of Rage&quot;.

===SHI 360===
Shai Haddad was born in Haifa, Israel and then moved to Montreal, Canada when he was eleven. He was very resistant to the move and didn&#x27;t like the change. When attending a public school he was faced with a lot of Antisemitism.
He also perceived a lot of friction within the local Jewish community. He was seen as an outcast to them because his friends were mostly black and Hispanic. The Canadian hip-hop scene helped jump-start his rap career. He would go to open mic nights and he also recorded his first vinyl single, &quot;Linguistiks,&quot; through his own label, IntelektMusik, in Montreal. In 1996 Haddad returned to Israel to pursue his rap career. This time he went under the name SHI 360 (Hebrew: שי 360). SHI stands for Supreme Hebrew Intelekt and 360 represents his return to Israel from Canada. SHI 360&#x27;s lyrics reflect political and social themes as opposed to the feel-good pop that dominates the Israeli radio. In the song “Break the silence” he talks to kids speaking up about abuse from home life. He considers himself a conscious MC. SHI 360 hopes to change the view on how radio is supposed to sound in Israel.

After a few years rapping, he met Israeli rapper Subliminal who at the time was known as “Caveman.” Haddad suggested the name Subliminal and he took that name as his stage name. Subliminal and David Levy started the T.A.C.T. Entertainment group.

===DAM===
Though many Jewish Israeli rappers are present in the country&#x27;s pop culture, fewer Palestinian hip-hop groups have surfaced, though one has gained widespread popularity. The group&#x27;s name, DAM, is the Arabic verb for &quot;to last forever/eternity&quot; (دام) and the Hebrew word for &quot;blood&quot; (דם), but can also be an acronym for &quot;Da Arabian MCs.&quot; DAM could be argued to be the polar opposite of Subliminal’s right-wing stance. Formed in 1998, DAM is noted as the first Arab-Israeli hip-hop group and consists of three Palestinian men who hold Israeli citizenship as well: Tamer Nafer, his brother Suhell, and a friend, Mahmoud Jreri. Though the rappers mostly sing in Arabic, they do write songs in Hebrew and English as well, to ensure that they reach all of their intended audiences. The content of their songs is largely focused on the many conflicts existent between Israel and the Palestinians, including the issue of Palestinians feeling like second-class citizens of the country. DAM often challenges Zionism with their lyrics and accuses the Israeli government of racism and inequality. Many of their songs demand treatment equal to that offered to the Jewish citizens of Israel. According to lead rapper Nafer, “our message is one of humanity- but it’s also political- we make protest music.” DAM&#x27;s first single of 2001, “Meen Erhabe?” (or “Who’s the Terrorist?”) was not even released by an official recording label, but was still downloaded from online by over one million visitors. Their latest rap single, “Born Here,” is written and performed in Hebrew to further expand their audience. Nafar has also stated that the reasoning for the transition to Hebrew lyrics is to be able to transmit the messages of the injustices to the Israelis very clearly. Nafar has said that his position is to replace politicians; “Politicians don’t talk to our generation. But politics is the way of our life, so I’m bringing the way of our life in their language.” In November 2006, DAM ultimately released an official album, titled “Dedication.”

===Sagol 59===
Sagol 59 (Born Khen Rotem, October 1, 1968) is a Jerusalem based hip-hop MC. Raised on a Kibbutz in Israel. After his required 3-year stint in the Israeli Defense Forces, Sagol turned to music, beginning his career in blues, funk and rock before moving on to hip hop in the Mid 1990s. Shortly after, he relocated to Jerusalem. Sagol was picked up by the city&#x27;s seminal (and now defunct) indie label, Fact Records. He was later signed to major label NMC Records.

With 5 full-length albums to date, plenty of musical collaborations with diverse artists and many live shows in Israel and overseas (U.S, Europe)Sagol has anticipated Israel&#x27;s current Rap boom and cemented his position as one of its leaders.

Within the last decade, Sagol has participated in many events alongside Palestinian and Arab musicians, and has performed alongside many well-known artists and overseas: Matisyahu, DJ Spooky, Kenny Mohammed The Human Orchestra, Remedy, Killah Priest, Sole of Anticon, Spearhead&#x27;s Michael Franti, Yitz Jordan aka Y-Love, Taskforce, and Israeli artists such as Hadag Nachash, Coolooloosh, Mook-e, Teapacks, Yossi Fine and many others.

In 2001 he received critical praise for his groundbreaking collaboration “Summit Meeting&quot;(feat. Tamer Nafar of DAM &amp; Shaanan Streett of Hadag Nachash), the first-ever collaborative recording featuring both Israeli and Palestinian MCs. He regularly hosts the Corner Prophets series, a cultural initiative meant to unite the diverse cultural communities located in Jerusalem through a shared interest in hip-hop. By working with Corner Prophets, Sagol&#x27;s goal is to inspire a new generation of Israelis and Palestinians that turn to art, not violence, as a means to find a common ground.

<text>Turoyo (), also referred to as Surayt (), or modern Suryoyo (), is a Central Neo-Aramaic language traditionally spoken by Assyrians in the Tur Abdin region in southeastern Turkey and in northern Syria. Turoyo speakers are mostly adherents of the Syriac Orthodox Church, but there are also some Turoyo-speaking adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church, especially from the towns of Midyat and Qamishli. The language is also spoken throughout diaspora, among modern Assyrians. It is classified as a vulnerable language. Most speakers use the Classical Syriac language for literature and worship. Its closest relatives are Mlaḥsô and western varieties of Northeastern Neo-Aramaic like Suret. Turoyo is not mutually intelligible with Western Neo-Aramaic, having been separated for over a thousand years.

==Etymology==
Term comes from the word &#x27;, meaning &#x27;mountain&#x27;, thus designating a specific Neo-Aramaic language of the mountain region of Tur Abdin in southeastern part of modern Turkey (hence &quot;Turabdinian&quot; Aramaic). Other, more general names for the language are &#x27; or &quot;&quot;.

Term &quot;Surayt&quot; is commonly used by its speakers, as a general designation for their language, modern or historical. It is also used by the recent EU funded programme to revitalize the language, in preference to &quot;&quot;, since Surayt is a historical name for the language used by its speakers, while Turoyo is a more academic name for the language used to distinguish it from other Neo-Aramaic languages, and Classical Syriac. However, especially in the diaspora, the language is frequently called &quot;Surayt&quot;, &quot;Suryoyo&quot; (or &quot;Surayt&quot;, &quot;Sŭryoyo&quot; or &quot;Süryoyo&quot; depending on dialect), meaning &quot;Syriac&quot; in general. Since it has developed as one of western variants of the Syriac language, Turoyo is sometimes also referred to as &quot;Western Neo-Syriac&quot;.

==History==

Turoyo has evolved from the Eastern Aramaic colloquial varieties that have been spoken in Tur Abdin and the surrounding plain for more than a thousand years since the initial introduction of Aramaic to the region. However, it has also been influenced by Classical Syriac, which itself was the variety of the Eastern Middle Aramaic spoken farther west, in the city of Edessa, today known as Urfa. Due to the proximity of Tur Abdin to Edessa, and the closeness of their parent languages, meant that Turoyo bears a greater similarity to Classical Syriac than do Northeastern Neo-Aramaic varieties.

The homeland of Turoyo is the Tur Abdin region in southeastern Turkey. This region is a traditional stronghold of Syriac Orthodox Christians. The Turoyo-speaking population prior to the Assyrian genocide largely adhered to the Syriac Orthodox Church. In 1970, it was estimated that there were 20,000 Turoyo-speakers still living in the area, however, they gradually migrated to Western Europe and elsewhere in the world. The Turoyo-speaking diaspora is now estimated at . In the diaspora communities, Turoyo is usually a second language which is supplemented by more mainstream languages. The language is considered endangered by UNESCO, but efforts are still made by Turoyo-speaking communities to sustain the language through use in homelife, school programs to teach Turoyo on the weekends, and summer day camps. 

Until recently, Turoyo was a spoken vernacular and was never written down: Kthobonoyo (Classical Syriac) was the written language. In the 1880s, various attempts were made, with the encouragement of western missionaries, to write Turoyo in the Syriac alphabet, in the &quot;Serto&quot; and in &quot;Estrangelo&quot; script used for West-Syriac Kthobhonoyo. One of the first comprehensive studies of the language was published in 1881, by orientalists Eugen Prym and Albert Socin, who classified it as a Neo-Aramaic dialect.

However, with upheaval in their homeland through the twentieth century, many Turoyo speakers have emigrated around the world (particularly to Syria, Lebanon, Sweden and Germany). The Swedish government&#x27;s education policy, that every child be educated in his or her first language, led to the commissioning of teaching materials in Turoyo. Yusuf Ishaq thus developed an alphabet for Turoyo based on the Latin script. Silas Üzel also created a separate Latin alphabet for Turoyo in Germany.

A series of reading books and workbooks that introduce Ishaq&#x27;s alphabet are called , or &quot;Come, Let&#x27;s Read!&quot; This project has also produced a Swedish-Turoyo dictionary of 4500 entries: the &quot;Svensk-turabdinskt Lexikon: Leksiqon Swedoyo-Suryoyo&quot;. Another old teacher, writer and translator of Turoyo is Yuhanun Üzel (1934-2023) who in 2009 finished the translation of the Peshitta Bible in Turoyo, with Benjamin Bar Shabo and Yakup Bilgic, in Serto (West-Syriac) and Latin script, a foundation for the &quot;Aramaic-Syriac language&quot;. A team of AI researchers completed the first translation model for Turoyo in 2023.

==Dialects==
Turoyo has borrowed some words from Arabic, Kurdish, Armenian, and Turkish. The main dialect of Turoyo is that of Midyat (Mëḏyoyo), in the east of Turkey&#x27;s Mardin Province. Every village have distinctive dialects (Midwoyo, Kfarzoyo, `Iwarnoyo, Nihloyo, and Izloyo, respectively). All Turoyo dialects are mutually intelligible with each other. There is a dialectal split between the town of Midyat and the villages, with only slight differences between the individual villages. A closely related language or dialect, Mlaḥsô, spoken in two villages in Diyarbakır, is now deemed extinct.

==Alphabet==
Turoyo is written both in Latin and Syriac (Serto) characters. The orthography below was the outcome of the International Surayt Conference held at the University of Cambridge (27–30 August 2015).

Attempts to write down Turoyo have begun since the 16th century, with Jewish Neo-Aramaic adaptions and translations of Biblical texts, commentaries, as well as hagiographic stories, books, and folktales in Christian dialects. The East Syriac Bishop Mar Yohannan working with American missionary Rev. Justin Perkins also tried to write the vernacular version of religious texts, culminating in the production of school-cards in 1836.

In 1970s Germany, members of the Aramean evangelical movement (&quot;Aramäische Freie Christengemeinde&quot;) used Turoyo to write short texts and songs. The Syriac evangelical movement has also published over 300 Turoyo hymns in a compedium named &quot;Kole Ruhonoye&quot; in 2012, as well as translating the four gospels with Mark and John being published so far.

The alphabet as used in a forthcoming translation of &quot;New Peshitta in Turoyo&quot; by Yuhanun Bar Shabo, &quot;Sfar mele surtoṯoyo – Picture dictionary&quot; and Benjamin Bar Shabo&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

In the 1970s, educator Yusuf Ishaq attempted to systematically incorporate the Turoyo language into a Latin orthography, which resulted in a series of reading books, entitled [toxu qorena]. Although this system is not used outside of Sweden, other Turoyo speakers have developed their own non-standardized Latin script to use the language on digital platforms.

The Swedish government&#x27;s &quot;mother-tongue education&quot; project treated Turoyo as an immigrant language, like Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish, and began to teach the language in schools. The staff of the National Swedish Institute for Teaching Material produced a Latin letter-based alphabet, grammar, dictionary, school books, and instructional material. Due to religious and political objections, the project was halted.

There are other efforts to translate famous works of literature, including The Aramaic Students Association&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, the Nisbin Foundation&#x27;s translation of &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Little Red Riding Hood.&quot;

==Phonology==
Phonetically, Turoyo is very similar to Classical Syriac. The additional phonemes (as in judge&quot;), (as in church&quot;) (as in &quot;azure&quot;) and a few instances of (the Arabic ẓāʾ) mostly only appear in loanwords from other languages.

The most distinctive feature of Turoyo phonology is its use of reduced vowels in closed syllables. The phonetic value of such reduced vowels differs depending both on the value of original vowel and the dialect spoken. The Miḏyoyo dialect also reduces vowels in pre-stress open syllables. That has the effect of producing a syllabic schwa in most dialects (in Classical Syriac, the schwa is not syllabic).

=== Vowels ===
Turoyo has the following set of vowels:


==Morphology==
The verbal system of Turoyo is similar to that used in other Neo-Aramaic languages. In Classical Syriac, the ancient perfect and imperfect tenses had started to become preterite and future tenses respectively, and other tenses were formed by using the participles with pronominal clitics or shortened forms of the verb &quot;hwā&quot; (&#x27;to become&#x27;). Most modern Aramaic languages have completely abandoned the old tenses and form all tenses from stems based around the old participles. The classical clitics have become incorporated fully into the verb form, and can be considered more like inflections.

Turoyo has also developed the use of the demonstrative pronouns much more than any other Aramaic language. In Turoyo, they have become definite articles:
*masculine singular: u malko (&quot;the king&quot;)
*feminine singular: i malëkṯo (&quot;the queen&quot;)
*plural common: am malke (&quot;the kings&quot;), am malkoṯe (&quot;the queens&quot;).

The other Central Neo-Aramaic dialect, of Mlahsô and Ansha villages in Diyarbakır Province is somewhat different from Turoyo. It is virtually extinct; its last few speakers live in Qamishli in northeastern Syria and in the diaspora.

== Syntax ==
Turoyo has three sets of particles that take the place of the copula in nominal clauses: enclitic copula, independent copula, and emphatic independent copula. In Turoyo, the non-enclitic copula (or the existential particle) is articulated with the use of two sets of particles: &quot;kal&quot; and &quot;kit&quot;.

<text>Real person fiction or real people fiction (RPF) is a genre of writing similar to fan fiction, but featuring celebrities or other real people.

Before the term &quot;real person fiction&quot; (or &quot;real people fiction&quot;) came into common usage, fans came up with a variety of terms, which are still used for specific genres or cultural practices in the RPF community; for example, bandfic, popslash, or actorfic. The genre includes stories about actors, athletes, comedians, historical figures, musicians, newsworthy people, and reality show contestants among others, as well as fiction about the fans themselves.

==Description==
In general, the authors seem to adopt the public personas of the celebrities in question as their own characters, building a fictional universe based on the supposed real-life histories of their idols. Information from interviews, documentaries, music videos, and other publicity sources are assimilated into the stories. It is also very popular to write fiction about celebrity couples. Communities of writers build collective archetypes based on the celebrities&#x27; public personas. Communities also develop their own ethics on what sort of stories are acceptable – some are uncomfortable with slash fiction, or with mention of the celebrity&#x27;s real-life families, or with stories involving suicide, murder, or rape. Like most fan fiction, the RPF genre includes stories of every kind, from innocuous to sadistic to pornographic. The genre can be considered postmodern.

Many fan fiction writers consider writing real person fan fiction unethical and the genre is considered somewhat separate from media-based fan fiction, both within fandom communities and academic disciplines like fan studies. This has not stopped mainstream legacy media outlets from giving legitimacy to such fiction in some cases: Chinese outlet Sina World News in 2016 for example promoted a hypothetical friendly written correspondence between badminton athletes Lin Dan of China and Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia immediately after the 2016 Olympics semifinals in which Lin defeated Lee in the peak of their competitive rivalry. The &quot;letter&quot; when translated to Malay and English however was misrepresented as actual correspondence as it spread on Malaysian social medias, which the Malaysian Olympic contingent including Lee himself immediately quashed.

Depictions of actors in RPF stories are often heavily influenced by characters the actors portray. For example, in RPF based around &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Viggo Mortensen is frequently shown as taking an Aragorn-like leadership role, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are lighthearted Hobbit-like pranksters, and Elijah Wood is more physically fragile and emotionally vulnerable than his colleagues.

A significant minority of such stories take the form of &quot;Mary Sue fan fiction&quot;, which feature a &quot;Mary Sue&quot; character, usually but not always female, who is described in extremely idealistic terms and is described as a wish-fulfillment image of the author. A Mary Sue may become romantically involved with a band member or actor, join a film cast, prove to have superior acting or singing ability, and/or possess incredible beauty.

Politician fic is sometimes used as a form of satire, or to highlight the underlying biases or attitudes of the politician being portrayed, although more recently there has been an increase in more &#x27;ordinary&#x27; fan fiction about British politicians in particular, with a notable emphasis on slash.

==History==
Real person fiction has a long history. William Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays are sometimes considered early examples of RPF, and the Brontë children wrote RPF from 1826 to approximately 1844. Based on the children&#x27;s roleplaying game about the Napoleonic Wars, the series featured the Duke of Wellington and his two (actual) sons Charles and Arthur, and their nemesis Alexander Percy, partly based on Napoleon. Over the years, Arthur evolved into an amazingly charismatic and powerful figure, the Duke of Zamorna. Percy became a tragic villain, partly inspired by John Milton&#x27;s version of Satan from &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. These stories were not published until well over a hundred years later, but the children used them to polish their writing skills and eventually all became professional authors.

During the 1940s, the Whitman Publishing Company released authorized real person fiction, possibly as a boost to the careers of the Hollywood stars of that era. Described as &quot;The Newest, Up-To-The-Minute Mystery and Adventure Stories for Boys and Girls, featuring your favorite characters&quot;, a variety of famous actors and actresses were spotlighted, including Ginger Rogers, Betty Grable, John Payne, Ann Sheridan, Jane Withers, Bonita Granville, Gene Autry, Deanna Durbin and Ann Rutherford. The hardcover publications had colorful dustjackets with a photo of the celebrity on the front, and several illustrations of the actor or actress inside the volume. Liberties were taken with the identities of the celebrities; for example, in the story &quot;Ginger Rogers and the Riddle of the Scarlet Cloak&quot;, the &quot;Ginger Rogers&quot; character is not an actress at all, but is instead a telephone operator who becomes involved in a mystery.

The original edition of the &quot;Three Investigators&quot; children&#x27;s crime series was billed as &quot;Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators&quot;, with Hitchcock as mentor to the eponymous heroes.

Jean Lorrah&#x27;s &quot;Visit to a Weird Planet&quot;, published in &quot;Spockanalia&quot; 3 (1968), was a lighthearted two-parter about what would happen if a transporter malfunction caused the &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters to be swapped with the 20th-century actors who played them. Regina Marvinny, editor of &quot;Tricorder Readings&quot;, encouraged fans in the early 1970s to write &quot;what-if&quot; stories about meeting Leonard Nimoy. However, some of the earliest known &quot;published&quot; cases of RPF come from 1977, when fanzines of the band Led Zeppelin began to print some of the fan fiction being written. Due to the fact that these stories involved real Zeppelin band members, most notably Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, names were changed to pseudonyms such as &quot;Tris&quot; and &quot;Alex&quot;.

Starting in 1984, Elliot Roosevelt wrote a series of detective novels, casting his real-life mother Eleanor Roosevelt in the role of a crime solving sleuth, with titles like &quot;Murder and the First Lady&quot;, &quot;Murder in the Oval Office&quot;, and &quot;Murder in the Lincoln Bedroom&quot;.

Real person fiction about musicians dates back to at least the 1970s, when slash fiction about bands - particularly Led Zeppelin - became popular. It circulated in fanzines in the 1980s and 1990s and moving online in the 1990s.

The RPF community was, for a period of time, centered on the website FanFiction.Net. When the RPF section was removed from FanFiction.Net in 2002, the community dispersed to smaller web archives and LiveJournal communities. RPF is generally totally absent from Usenet, especially in older and more established newsgroups. Until it shut down in 2014, Quizilla was a popular website for publishing RPF.

The website The Nifty Archive was a notable repository of boy band and celebrity erotica. Other music-related RPF websites include rockfic.com for RPF involving rock stars (its inaugural story was a slash pairing between Metallica&#x27;s James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett), and &quot;Metal Fic&quot;, specifically for heavy metal artists.

Another popular website for RPF chosen by youth fan fic writers is Winglin.net or Asianfanfics.com, which is more commonly centered on Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese or Chinese musicians and actors, like TVXQ, Super Junior, Big Bang, SHINee, EXO, Mike He, S.H.E, and others.

In 2009, the Organization for Transformative Works launched the website Archive of Our Own, which included categories for RPF.

Real celebrities have been commercially re-imagined as fictional detectives including Angela Merkel and Queen Elizabeth II.

==Controversy==
===Morality and legality===
The first known case of legal action being taken as a result of RPF is from 2003, when FanDomination.net received a cease and desist order from a representative of baseball player Andy Pettitte.

===Real person slash===

Real person slash (RPS), also known in some circles as real-life slash (RLS), involves relationships. (See slash fiction for more on the subtleties and variations in definition.) These are usually complete fabrications, not based on any real-life indications of the subject&#x27;s sexual orientation, but on the fantasies of the author and the desire to experiment with perceived or invented erotic subtext between the idols in question. Slash is roughly equal in popularity to less controversial types of real person fiction.

The content of the stories can range from the mildly romantic, involving deep friendships and innocent crushes, to carefully written love stories, all the way to explicit erotica.

Due to the potentially libelous nature of some stories, and the knowledge or fear that some celebrities dislike slash fiction involving themselves, some fan fiction communities denounce RPS fiction and do not allow it on their websites.

This type of RPF also brings up issues of consent and objectification of real people.

===Reaction===

In 2008, a man was arrested in the UK for writing and publishing on the internet a story featuring various members of the band Girls Aloud under the Obscene Publications Act. The story described the kidnap, rape and murder of the women. He was subsequently tried (the &quot;R v Walker&quot; trial) and found not guilty, and claimed that he had never intended to frighten or intimidate the band members.

<text>The Moncton Wildcats are a Canadian junior ice hockey team in the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) based in Moncton, New Brunswick. The franchise was granted for the 1995–96 season, and were known as the Moncton Alpines for one season prior to rebranding as the Wildcats. The team played at the Moncton Coliseum from 1995 until 2018, and moved into the Avenir Centre prior to the 2018–19 season. After winning the 2005–06 QMJHL championship, the team hosted the 2006 Memorial Cup and reached the final game. The Wildcats also won the league championship in 2009–10, which sent the team to compete at the 2010 Memorial Cup in Brandon, Manitoba where they were eliminated from contention after going winless in the round-robin portion of the tournament.

==History==
The Moncton Alpines joined the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League for the 1995–96 season. They played for one season under the ownership of racing driver John Graham and coached by Lucien DeBlois. The franchise was purchased by Robert Irving in May 1996, and renamed to the Moncton Wildcats with new uniforms and logo.

Moncton hosted the 2006 Memorial Cup. The team hired former NHL coach of the year Ted Nolan, and acquired players such as Keith Yandle, and various rookies. The Wildcats finished in first place in the league, going 52-15-0-3 for 107 points and winning the Jean Rougeau Trophy for the first time. The Wildcats defeated the Quebec Remparts to the President&#x27;s Cup. In the Memorial Cup, Moncton finished second in the round-robin after defeating Peterborough and Vancouver but losing to Quebec. The Wildcats defeated the Giants in the semi-final, but lost to the Remparts 6-2 in the Memorial Cup final.

<text>Jefferson Agustín Farfán Guadalupe (; born 26 October 1984) is a Peruvian former professional footballer who mainly played as a winger. Commonly known as Farfán or the nickname &quot;Foquita&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Little Seal&quot;), he is known for his speed and technical ability and was one of the best providers of assists during his time in the Bundesliga.

Farfán began his career with Deportivo Municipal and Alianza Lima; the latter club saw him make his professional debut in 2001. In 2002, Farfán was highlighted as one of the next best players of Peruvian football and a year later, won his second Primera División title. After winning his third league title with Alianza in 2004, he was recognized as the best Peruvian player of that year.

Having joined PSV Eindhoven in mid-2004, Farfán helped the Dutch giants win four Eredivisie titles. He signed for Bundesliga side Schalke 04 in 2008 and during his time with the club, he won the 2011 DFB-Pokal Final. In 2012, he was named the most expensive Latin American player in the league. Farfán briefly played for Al-Jazira in the United Arab Emirates before leaving due to a breach of contract. He last played in Russia for Lokomotiv, when, in his second season, helped the club win their first league title in 14 years and finished as the team&#x27;s top scorer.

With the national team, Farfán is the country&#x27;s second top goalscorer, behind only Paolo Guerrero. He is very popular in Peru, with coach Ricardo Gareca naming him &quot;one of the most important players in the history of Peruvian football.&quot; He helped his side finish third at the 2015 Copa América and second in Brazil 2019.

==Club career==
===Alianza Lima===
Farfán began his professional career with Alianza Lima of Peru. He made some appearances in 2001 on the first-team, and began to break through in 2002, and impacting Alianza with its 2003 Peru championship. In his final season with the club in 2004, Farfán scored 14 goals, helping the club to another Peru championship.

===PSV Eindhoven===

Following that season he was purchased by Dutch club PSV Eindhoven after being scouted by Guus Hiddink, for a reported 2 million Euro transfer fee. Farfán made his debut in the Eredivisie on 14 August in a 5–2 win against RBC Roosendal. Almost two weeks later, Farfán&#x27;s European debut would come in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, a 5–0 win against Red Star Belgrade. PSV qualified for the final tournament and he played in all twelve games. In the group match against the Norwegian Rosenborg BK, he scored his inaugural European goal in 2–1 win. A month earlier, he had scored his first league goal, in a 4–0 win against SC Heerenveen. With PSV, Farfán won both the league and the cup tournament in his first season in the Netherlands. The Eredivisie would be won by PSV in the following three consecutive seasons. In the 2005/06 season, Farfán finished with 21 goals as club top scorer and fourth top scorer in the league. In his last season with PSV, Farfán was less dominant, partly due to an ankle injury he sustained during the 2007 Copa América. In March 2008, rumors began to circulate about a departure from Eindhoven.

===FC Schalke 04===
On 5 June 2008, it was reported that PSV had reached an agreement with German side Schalke 04 over the transfer of Farfán for around €10 million. On 10 June 2008, the club officially confirmed the transfer of Farfán on a four-year contract. On 28 April 2012, Schalke announced that Farfán had signed a contract extension, which would keep him at S04 until 30 June 2016.

===Al Jazira Club===
On 20 July 2015, after seven years at the club, Schalke confirmed that Farfán had joined Al Jazira Club for a reported fee of €6 million on a three-year deal, where he could earn up to €10 million a year.

Farfán left the club on 19 October 2016, because the club did not respect all the clauses in his contract.

===Lokomotiv Moscow===
On 28 January 2017, he signed with the Russian Premier League side FC Lokomotiv Moscow. The Russian team announced his signing after an irregular 2016, where he even was inactive for a hundred days after finishing in October 2016 a millionaire contract with Al Jazira. After 6 months of recovery, Farfán had a good season making goals that allowed his team to get the national title after 14 years.

He didn&#x27;t appear for Lokomotiv for 14 months from May 2019 due to knee injury and a following positive test for COVID-19. He made his first appearance upon recovery on 12 July 2020 in a game against FC Ufa and scored a late equalizer for his club in a 1–1 draw.

On 5 August 2020, Lokomotiv announced that Farfán left the club as his contract expired.

===Alianza Lima===
On 22 March 2021, Farfán signed with and returned to Alianza Lima.

On 16 December 2022, Farfán announced his retirement at the age of 38.

==International career==
Farfán made his debut for the Peru national football team in February 2003. He gained 102 caps and is second on the nation&#x27;s career goalscoring list with 27 goals. He ended the South American 2006 World Cup qualifiers as the second top scorer, with seven goals.

He was suspended for 18 months from representing the national football team of Peru. But on 3 July 2008, after an investigation and a review of the facts, the suspension was changed to three months (from the date of appeal in April 2008) and $10,000. Farfán scored the winning goal in the World Cup qualifier at home to Chile on 23 March 2013.

He was a member of the Peru national football team that finished in third place at the 2015 Copa América. Farfán has been a key performer for Peru during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers where he scored 3 goals. He scored 2 goals in a 3–4 home loss to Chile and the winner in a 1–0 home win over Paraguay. He scored one of two goals in a 2–0 home win against New Zealand that led Peru qualify to the 2018 FIFA World Cup after a 36-year absence.

In June 2018 he was named in Peru&#x27;s final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. He started in their first group game against Denmark, which resulted in a 0–1 loss. Farfán started as a substitute in their second group game against France, coming on in the 46th minute to replace Yoshimar Yotún. His side were eliminated from the competition after another 0–1 loss. He missed their final group game against Australia as he was rushed to hospital after a suffering a concussion in training. Peru won their final game 2–0.

In Peru&#x27;s second game of the 2019 Copa América, Farfán scored a goal in Peru&#x27;s 3-1 victory over Bolivia. Farfán suffered an injury to his left knee prior to Peru&#x27;s last-eight clash against Uruguay, ruling him out of the rest of the tournament. The Peruvian Football Federation (FPF) confirmed the injury, with Farfán expected to be sidelined for 6 to 9 months. On 6 July 2019, Farfán underwent knee surgery in Barcelona, just hours before his team faced hosts Brazil in the 2019 Copa América Final. Peru went on to lose the game 3–1 in his absence.

==Playing style==
Farfán is considered to be a fast and technically gifted forward or winger, and is regarded less as a goal-scorer, but instead as more of an assist provider and as a creator of goals. His one-on-one dribbling ability, accurate corner kicks and passes contributed heavily to Schalke&#x27;s goals, especially in the international arena. Farfán is also known for his penalty kick and direct or indirect free kick ability.

Farfán&#x27;s cousin Quembol Guadalupe (born 2004) also became a professional footballer, playing as a defender for Sporting Cristal.

<text>The Halifax Mooseheads are a Canadian junior ice hockey team in the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The team was founded in 1994 and began play in the Dilio Division of the QMJHL for the 1994–95 season. They have appeared in the President&#x27;s Cup Finals five times, winning in 2013. The other four appearances were in 2003, 2005, 2019 and 2023. They hosted the Memorial Cup in 2000 and 2019 and won the tournament in 2013. The team plays their home games at the Scotiabank Centre.

The Mooseheads were the first team from Atlantic Canada to join the QMJHL. With the Mooseheads&#x27; success, the QMJHL then expanded to several other east coast cities. The QMJHL&#x27;s eastward expansion has been credited with elevating the skill level and the career opportunities for hockey talent from the region. In the 2018–19 season, three of the NHL&#x27;s top seven scorers were QMJHL alumni from Halifax; two of them former Mooseheads.

==History==
===Inception and first seasons: 1994–1997===

Halifax was home to professional American Hockey League clubs for 22 seasons; however, in 1993 the Quebec Nordiques-affiliated Halifax Citadels announced plans to relocate the team. Faced with the loss of its major hockey draw, brewery executive Harold MacKay proposed the city seek a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) franchise. Since its founding in 1969, the QMJHL consisted of almost exclusively Quebec-based teams. Expansion to Atlantic Canada was considered financially unfeasible by QMJHL commissioner Gilles Courteau and much of the league&#x27;s executive committee due to the added travel costs for the existing franchises, but on 17 March 1994, the QMJHL Board of Governors unanimously approved the Halifax application.

MacKay won the financial backing of Moosehead Breweries president and CEO Derek Oland. The company put up the $500,000 expansion franchise fee and secured the team&#x27;s naming rights. Nine minority owners included auto dealer John Gwynne-Timothy, fuel company executive Laddie Farquhar, and National Hockey League players Wendell Young and Cam Russell.

The new club then had to create a team in less than six months. MacKay recruited as the team&#x27;s head coach and general manager Clément Jodoin, then an assistant coach with the Quebec Nordiques and a former AHL defenceman who had spent seven seasons in Halifax. He added as an assistant coach Shawn MacKenzie, a former professional goaltender and university coach.

With attendance averaging over 3700 per game, the Mooseheads finished their first season with a 24–42–6 record, earning a playoff berth despite finishing 11th overall in the 13-team league. The club lost in the first round, but took the first-place Beauport Harfangs to seven games. The Mooseheads continued to build over the next couple of seasons, finishing with a winning record and third place in their division in their third season. Fan support continued to grow, averaging 5349 during the regular season and reaching 9600 in the playoffs. The team reached the President&#x27;s Cup semi-final for the first time in 1997, losing to the Chicoutimi Saguenéens in a seventh game. The club also continued to have success in recruitment, drafting winger Alex Tanguay, a future NHL all-star and Stanley Cup winner, 20th overall in the 1996 midget draft.

===First Memorial Cup tournament: 1997–2003===
The Mooseheads underwent several changes prior to its fourth season in 1997–98. In addition to losing key players such as Shelley, the team&#x27;s inaugural coach and general manager, Clément Jodoin, moved to an assistant coaching position with the Montreal Canadiens and the club&#x27;s founder Harold MacKay stepped down as president. The organization recruited Denis Leblanc as general manager and Danny Grant, a former NHL 50-goal scorer and university coach, as the Mooseheads&#x27; new coach. The club struggled on the ice, finishing fifth in their division and losing in the first round of the playoffs in five games. Grant was then replaced as coach by Bob Mongrain.

Aided by key acquisitions, including goaltenders Pascal Leclaire and Aleksei Volkov, and Slovakian forward Ladislav Nagy, the team rebounded to second place divisional finishes in 1999 and 2000, losing in the second round both seasons. Despite limited on-ice success, the Mooseheads still drew many fans; in 1998–99 cumulative attendance topped one million through the regular season and playoffs. It was the key factor in the Canadian Hockey League&#x27;s awarding the 2000 Memorial Cup tournament to Halifax.

Following the four-game sweep to the Rimouski Océanic in the second round of the 2000 QMJHL playoffs, and a month before the Memorial Cup tournament was to begin, the club released Mongrain, replacing him with assistant coach Shawn Mackenzie. Led by a 10-point performance by Ramzi Abid, the Mooseheads finished the Memorial Cup round-robin with a 2–1 record, but lost in the semi-final to the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Barrie Colts.

Following the team&#x27;s strong Memorial Cup showing, Mackenzie was awarded the head coaching job to start the 2000–01 season, while Marcel Patenaude took over as general manager. After a slow 2–12 start to the season, the team improved and finished the season in first place in the Atlantic Division, only to lose to Rimouski in five games in the first round of the playoffs. A third place-overall finish the next season propelled Halifax into the second round, ending with a six-game second round loss to the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles.

In 2002, Sidney Crosby, a skilled forward from the Halifax suburb of Cole Harbour, had attracted media attention from an early age and often played with older teammates. In early 2002, he was 14 and playing triple-A midget hockey when the Mooseheads approached the QMJHL for permission to sign Crosby for the 2002–03 season. The club asked the league to adopt a rule similar to one in the Ontario Hockey League allowing an underage player to play a season with his hometown club prior to draft eligibility. The QMJHL board of governors turned down the request.

The 2002–03 season became the club&#x27;s most successful at the time, marking its first appearance in a President&#x27;s Cup final. With a regular season record of 44–15–10–3, the club secured first place in its division, before sweeping Cape Breton in the first round, then beating Acadie Bathurst and Baie Comeau each in seven-game series. The team then met the Hull Olympiques in the final, taking them to seven games before dropping a 7–2 decision in the deciding game.

The 2002–03 season was also significant as the city of Halifax played host to the World Junior Hockey Championship and original majority owner Moosehead Breweries disclosed the company was looking for a buyer for its 64 percent share of the club. Before the start of the 2003–04 season, the club announced that Bobby Smith, a Nova Scotia native and former NHL forward and general manager, had become majority owner. The club retained the rights to the Mooseheads&#x27; name and logo.

===New ownership: 2003–2011===
After having brought in several older players for a run at the league championship, the Mooseheads iced a less experienced team for the 2003–04 season. Among players the team lost was the team&#x27;s then-offensive leader, Brandon Benedict, who retired with a record of 303 points in 343 games played for the Mooseheads. Outscored 194–274 on the season, the team did not qualify for of the playoffs for the first time in its history. In addition, team owner Bobby Smith engaged in a public spat with the management of the club&#x27;s arena, claiming the Mooseheads&#x27; lease was the worst in junior hockey. After threatening to leave for an older, smaller rink, the dispute was resolved after municipal government intervened.

The Mooseheads team that began the 2004–05 season was much improved over the previous year, going into the Christmas break eight games over .500, although the team was often undisciplined and plagued by suspensions. Among them was an eight-game suspension of winger Frédérik Cabana for a knee-on-knee hit that sidelined Rimouski&#x27;s Sidney Crosby for two weeks. In response, Smith fired coach Shawn MacKenzie, replacing him with a former NHL linemate, Al MacAdam. Under MacAdam, the team ended the season in first place in their division and moving on to the league final for the second time in three seasons. The season came to an end when the Oceanic and Crosby swept the Mooseheads in the final.

MacAdam returned as coach again in 2005–06, and the Mooseheads finished fifth in their division, while advancing to the second round of the playoffs. MacAdam then retired and was replaced by assistant coach Cam Russell, who was also a part owner of the club and 10-year NHL defenceman.

Russell&#x27;s best season as coach saw the club advance to the 2007–08 semi-finals, before losing in four games to the Olympiques. The next two seasons had the club finish out of the playoffs and in last place in their division. 2009–10 was the worst season in the team&#x27;s history, finishing with just 13 wins and a .191 record while Russell insisted it was setting the stage for a complete team rebuild. The club went into the 2010 and 2011 QMJHL midget drafts and CHL import drafts with a number of early round picks. A few games into the 2010–11 season, Russell stepped away from the bench to become the club&#x27;s full-time general manager, with Bobby Smith taking over the head coach&#x27;s role.

===Rebuild and President&#x27;s Cup championship: 2011–2017===

In 2011, Nathan MacKinnon, a fast-skating forward from Dartmouth and had developed his skills in the Cole Harbour minor hockey system like Sidney Crosby, was attracting media attention. MacKinnon was also a life-long Mooseheads fan; his family were season tickets holders and had billeted several Mooseheads&#x27; players. After failing to land Crosby nine years earlier, the club was determined to add MacKinnon to the Mooseheads roster, however, Baie Comeau Drakkar held the first pick in the June 2011 QMJHL midget draft. The Drakkar chose to select him, despite MacKinnon&#x27;s signalling he would choose to play in the United States rather than sign with Baie Comeau. Five weeks later, the Drakkar agreed to trade MacKinnon to Halifax in exchange for two top forwards and three consecutive first round draft picks.

The results of Russell&#x27;s strategic rebuilding program were evident in the 2011–12 season, but coincided with a new coach. Dominique Ducharme was a former junior AAA head coach and QMJHL assistant coach. A trade with the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies netted them the second pick overall in the 2011 midget draft, allowing the Mooseheads to select highly ranked centre Jonathan Drouin. With the eleventh pick, the club chose Montreal goaltender Zachary Fucale. In the 2010 import draft, the club had acquired Czech power forward Martin Frk.

The 2012–13 Mooseheads season then became the most successful in the franchise&#x27;s history. They finished the season atop all teams in the Canadian Hockey League with just six regulation losses and a .882 record, outscoring their opposition 347–176. Anchored by Drouin and MacKinnon, the team had seven players with a plus-40 rating or better, as well as a defence led by German import Konrad Abeltshauser. In the playoffs, the team improved its winning record to .941, sweeping three rounds before losing one game to Baie Comeau in the final en route to a home ice President&#x27;s Cup win.

The Mooseheads then went on to compete in the 2013 Memorial Cup in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. After finishing the round-robin with a 2–1 record, they faced and defeated the Portland Winterhawks in the tournament final by a score of 6–4. Nathan MacKinnon recorded two hat-tricks during the tournament, including one in the championship game. It marked the third straight Memorial Cup championship for the QMJHL.

In the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, four members of the Mooseheads were selected, including MacKinnon at #1, Drouin at #3 and Fucale as the top goalie, at #36 overall.

The 2013–14 was also successful. While MacKinnon had departed for the Colorado Avalanche, Drouin and Fucale both returned to the Mooseheads lineup, and the club added a couple of star forwards by way of the 2013 import draft, Nikolaj Ehlers and Timo Meier.

The club found itself in a rebuilding mode once again in the 2014–15 season. With the departure of more Memorial Cup veterans including Fucale and Drouin, Ehlers and Meier became the team leaders. After a fourth-place divisional finish, the team upset favoured Shawinigan Cataractes in the first playoff round, before falling to the Moncton Wildcats in seven games.

The following season saw the club fall back into losing territory, recording only 21 wins and finishing out of the playoffs in sixth place in the Maritimes division. The Ducharme era came to a close, with the coach moving to the Drummondville Voltigeurs before taking on the role of head coach of the Canada national junior team. In May, the club signed a five-year deal with former NHL assistant coach Andre Tourigny to take over as head coach. While the team showed improvement in 2016–17, finishing in fifth place, they were ousted by Rouyn-Noranda 2–4 in the opening round of the playoffs. Tourigny then departed for the OHL at the end of the season.

The Mooseheads made history at the 2016 QMJHL draft by being the first team to have the first and second overall picks when they selected highly touted prospects Benoit-Olivier Groulx and Truro&#x27;s Jared McIsaac.

===Recent years: 2017–present===
As the 2017–18 season approached, Smith and Russell were already looking forward to the club&#x27;s 25th anniversary season. At the centre of their plans was a bid for the 2019 Memorial Cup tournament and to make sure the Mooseheads were legitimate contenders for a second national junior title. The CHL announced in May 2018 that Halifax had won the right to host the event, beating out a rival proposal from Moncton. Among the commitments made by Halifax was a promise to keep ticket prices affordable after high prices in previous tournaments were blamed for empty seats. The club set the cost of tournament passes for season ticket holders at $320, less than half the price of passes at the 2018 tournament in Regina.

The Mooseheads began the season by moving offices, training, and practice facilities to the RBC Centre, a new $43 million four-pad arena in Dartmouth.

Assistant coach Jim Midgley took over the head coaching duties for the 2017–18 season, looking for improved results from the returning Olivier-Groulx and MacIsaac, along with goaltender Alexis Gravel and veteran Max Fortier. While import star Nico Hischier had departed after one season, selected first overall by the New Jersey Devils in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, the club had signed another top Czech prospect, Filip Zadina.

The club began its 25th anniversary year with another coaching change. Éric Veilleux was a former NHL forward and AHL head coach who had led the Shawinigan Cataractes to a Memorial Cup crown in 2012 and only had one losing season in nine years as a head coach in major junior.

The team then traded for veteran players, including Antoine Morand and Samuel Asselin from the reigning Memorial Cup champion Acadie-Bathurst Titan, and Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, native Keith Getson from the Charlottetown Islanders. The team finished the season with its second-best all-time record at 49 wins and a .750 points percentage, good for first place in the Maritimes Division. After a seven-game, come-from-behind win over Quebec in the first round, the Mooseheads swept the Moncton Wildcats in four straight, then beat Drummondville in six games in a semi-final matchup. The Mooseheads were led by the production of NHL draft prospect Raphaël Lavoie, who led the league in playoff scoring with 20 goals. In the final, the Mooseheads faced the league-leading Rouyn-Noranda Huskies, a team that had finished the regular season with 59 wins and had lost only two playoff games. The Huskies won the final in six games, hoisting the President&#x27;s Cup on Halifax ice.

The two teams met again in the Memorial Cup tournament: the Huskies as QMJHL champions with the Mooseheads qualifying as hosts. The Mooseheads advanced with a bye to the championship game following a 2–1 record and first-place finish in the round-robin with their lone loss coming against the Huskies. The Huskies then also advanced to the final and defeated the Mooseheads again by a score of 4–2. Following the season, head coach Veilleux left the team for a position with the Syracuse Crunch of the American Hockey League.

<doc id="1243548" wikidata="Q3098236" url="?curid=1243548" title="Bad Girls (TV series)">
<text>Bad Girls is a British television drama series that was broadcast on ITV from 1 June 1999 until 20 December 2006. It was created by Maureen Chadwick and Ann McManus of Shed Productions, who initiated the idea of developing a series primarily focusing on the inmates and staff of the fictional women&#x27;s prison, Larkhall, located in the South London region. Following the success of previous series &quot;Within These Walls&quot; and the Australian-imported &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot;, both of which screened on ITV, &quot;Bad Girls&quot; was commissioned by the network and was viewed as a realistic, modern portrayal of life in a women&#x27;s prison. The series featured a large ensemble cast, including Linda Henry, Claire King, Simone Lahbib, Mandana Jones, Debra Stephenson, Jack Ellis, Alicya Eyo, Helen Fraser, Kika Mirylees, Victoria Alcock, James Gaddas, Victoria Bush, Dannielle Brent and Liz May Brice.

Unlike past prison series, &quot;Bad Girls&quot; storylines were portrayed in a more graphic manner in terms of violence, language, and sexual content, as prior shows were somewhat more restrictive in content. Common themes in the series include separation from families, recidivism and adjustment to prison life, while storylines concern the friendships and relationships between the inmates and staff alike, and to a more serious extent, the series focused on sensitive issues such as bullying, rape, suicide, miscarriage, drug use and violence against women, and as a result, was screened past the watershed. It is also notable in that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender characters are portrayed in a more permissive way.

The show achieved critical acclaim, becoming immensely successful, particularly throughout the course of its first three years. It constantly attracted high viewing figures, peaking at 9.49 million viewers during the ninth episode of the second series, the highest rated episode of any series produced by Shed Productions. The series began to decline very slightly during its fourth and fifth series&#x27; due to an overturn of popular characters, yet the show remained successful in the ratings. However, its popularity began to rise once again with the show&#x27;s sixth series. This was followed by a rapid decline for the seventh and eighth series&#x27;, which ultimately led to the show&#x27;s demise. Due to its success, the series received numerous awards, most notably at the National Television Awards, a crossover with &quot;Footballers&#x27; Wives&quot;, and a musical adapted from the original series, titled &quot;Bad Girls: The Musical&quot;. &quot;Bad Girls&quot; gained international success in countries including the United States, Australia, Ireland and several European countries.

==Production==
===Development===
Extensive research was covered prior to the production stage of the series on the lives of British female prisoners. Ann McManus and Maureen Chadwick, as well as several cast members, spent months visiting prisons during 1998 and 1999 in order to gather information and research on incarcerated women to inspire their roles for the series and how prisons had currently been run. McManus and Chadwick studied everything in detail on television series&#x27; set within women&#x27;s prisons, including ITV&#x27;s 1970s series &quot;Within These Walls&quot;, Network Ten&#x27;s Australian soap opera &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot;, which was first broadcast on ITV in 1984 until the late 1990s, and several prison documentaries, in addition to three books which McManus had written and all of which were presented to the cast. In order to continue their research, in January 1999, McManus and Chadwick attended an AGM of Women in Prison, a support group for female prisoners, to address such issues within female prisons, consulting former prisoners, and organisations such as NACRO and the Prison Officer&#x27;s Association.

===Filming===
The series was commissioned by ITV under the working title &quot;Jail Birds&quot; and commenced filming in February 1999. However the show&#x27;s name was later changed after a BBC One documentary series about women in prison used the same title a few months before the first series was aired.

The exact location of the fictional HMP Larkhall was never revealed, although in series 1, episode 4, character Shell Dockley mentioned it was &#x27;not far&#x27; from Clapham. There were several other references through the series that alluded to it being in the South London region, but no specific location was given. Several districts of the London area were referenced throughout the series run, these include: Peckham, Clapham, Acton, Catford, Streatham, Sydenham, Tooting, Stratford, Balham, and Bethnal Green. HM Prison Oxford, located within Oxford Castle, was used for the exterior shots featured in Series 1 to 3. The interior scenes featured a replica set of the prison&#x27;s wing and constructed within 3 Mills Studios. A reconstruction of the prison&#x27;s exterior was also created for series 4 onwards, as HM Prison Oxford had by then been redeveloped into a hotel complex. After ITV decommissioned the series in October 2006, 3 Mills kept hold of a prison exterior and a single cell. Before it was largely dismantled, the exterior and interior sets were used in series 3, episode 11 of &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; and series 23, episode 89 of &quot;The Bill&quot;. The music video for Rachel Stevens&#x27; 2005 UK single &quot;I Said Never Again (But Here We Are)&quot; was also filmed on the set.

Many scenes outside of Larkhall were filmed on location, usually around London, with numerous London landmarks being visible in shots. Real houses were used for prison officers houses, rather than sets. Four episodes included scenes filmed outside of the UK, two episodes in series 3 had scenes that were filmed in Spain, the first episode of series 5 opened with a scene in Amsterdam, series 7 featured scenes filmed in Peru, but set in Costa del Sol.

===Music===
For the first series of &quot;Bad Girls&quot; in 1999, the complete music score and theme was composed by award-winning composer Nina Humphreys. The theme music did not play over the end credits of episode 4, and was replaced with the song &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, performed by Sharon Duncan-Brewster (Crystal Gordon). In 2000, Kath Gotts became the credited composer for the remaining duration of the series, resulting in a major revamp of the incidental music score, the recap music and newly established theme music, introduced for the second series. As with the first series, the theme music played over the end credits in Series 2 as the 5-second opening title contained only short instrumental music. For the third series a new 20-second opening sequence was introduced which contained various shots of G-wing, and a second version of the theme music was created by Gotts so that the series could be recognized as having official opening titles. Towards the end of the third series, a third and final version of the theme music was placed over the opening sequence, which slightly differed from the previous music, and remained as such for the show&#x27;s duration. In 2002, a soundtrack CD was released as part of the original Series 3 DVD, featuring the music score from the third series and including both opening and closing theme music, recap music, and &quot;next time&quot; music, as well as the incidental music. The soundtrack is currently unavailable as the DVD set is now out-of-print. Furthermore, Gotts composed the entire music and wrote the lyrics for the adapted musical, &quot;Bad Girls: The Musical&quot;.

===Production format===
&quot;Bad Girls&quot; was an early example of a British television series to be produced in widescreen format 1.78:1. Although most of Britain were still viewing standard screen televisions, the early years of the series were seen in a format of 14:9 on analog television and cropped to pan and scan for the DVD releases of the first three series. These early episodes have been re-screened on ITV3 and CBS Drama in their original format and were later re-issued in widescreen on DVD.

==Episodes==

===Series 1 (1999)===

From the beginning, Bad Girls dealt with controversial subject matter. Early episodes of the first series included particularly shocking moments such as a pregnant prisoner miscarrying in her cell, Zandra Plackett (Lara Cazalet) being viciously strip-searched by fellow inmates for concealed drugs, and Rachel Hicks (Joanne Froggatt) committing suicide due to being bullied. The central story arc of the first three series revolved around the developing romantic relationship between Nikki Wade (Mandana Jones), a prisoner serving a life sentence for the murder of a policeman who attempted to rape her girlfriend, and Helen Stewart (Simone Lahbib), the Wing Governor who spent much of series one engaged to her boyfriend, Sean. Furthermore, the script, unwilling to compromise the realism of the programme, contained much strong language (for example, the reference to Nikki Wade as a &quot;rug-muncher&quot; and Denny Blood&#x27;s (Alicya Eyo) gloating over the likelihood of Rachel Hicks having &quot;singed her minge&quot;). Other storylines to feature prominently in series one included the pregnancy of a young drug addict Zandra, who decides to use an abortion as means to be sent to an outside clinic only for her to escape and make contact with her ex-boyfriend who has no interest in her or the baby, therefore she has no choice but to return to the clinic. In fear of losing her job over Zandra&#x27;s escape, Officer Lorna Rose (Luisa Bradshaw-White) asks fellow Officer Dominic McAllister (Joe Shaw) to keep quiet about the escape which leads to Zandra blackmailing Lorna to bring drugs into the prison, when Shell discovers what Zandra is up to she decides to set Lorna up; the appeal of wrongly-imprisoned Monica Lindsay (Jane Lowe) (frequently referred to as &quot;posh bitch&quot; by other characters) and the illicit relationship between Jim Fenner (Jack Ellis), the male Principal Officer and Shell Dockley (Debra Stephenson), the resident bully, Original Top Dog and drug dealer, serving life for murder.

Nikki and Helen&#x27;s relationship deepens with Helen resigning from the Wing Governor&#x27;s post and working as a new liaison officer for prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment, encouraging Nikki to continue her education and appeal against her sentence. Shell&#x27;s background was examined in some detail, with harrowing scenes describing childhood abuse. Zandra&#x27;s tragic story finally comes to a close when she dies from a brain tumour. For light relief, Yvonne Atkins (Linda Henry), the gangster&#x27;s moll, set up &quot;Babes Behind Bars&quot;, a sex-hotline staffed by the prisoners with smuggled in mobile phones, playing such characters as &quot;Whiplash Wanda&quot;, &quot;Saucy Sonia&quot; and &quot;Vicky the Virgin Bride&quot;. Series two ended on a double cliffhanger, with Nikki escaping from Larkhall to be with Helen, leaving Helen to agonise over whether to contact the police, and Shell luring Fenner to her cell for sex, where she reaches under her bed for a broken bottle.

===Series 3 (2001)===

Series 3 picks up where Series 2 left off. Fenner and Shell are in bed together and Nikki, dressed in a nurse&#x27;s uniform, is at Helen&#x27;s house after escaping. Shell stabs Fenner with a broken bottle that she had brought back from Sylvia Hollamby&#x27;s (Helen Fraser) party, with Fenner bleeding to death, Shell is in demand and soon finds herself back on top as Top Dog. New officer, the flirtatious and vivacious Gina Rossi arrives on G-Wing and soon locks horns with several inmates and staff alike. Young crack addicted prostitute, Buki Lester (Kim Oliver), arrives and lands Denny in danger when a piercing goes wrong. Nikki also suffers from heartbreak when her on and off relationship with Helen comes to an end, while she is staring her appeal in the face.

The third series saw a high turnover of short-term characters and storylines, but also chronicled the spectacular escape of Shell and Denny to the Costa Del Sol in Spain getting revenge on Sylvia and her husband along the way; Yvonne&#x27;s Top Dog status being challenged by Maxi Purvis (Kerry Norton), the head of the &quot;Peckham Boot Gang&quot;; prison officer Di Barker&#x27;s (Tracey Wilkinson) struggles as a home carer for her disabled mother and an upbeat finale of Helen and Nikki finally committing to their relationship when Nikki&#x27;s appeal is successful and she is released from prison.

===Series 4 (2002)===

Following on from one of the several cliffhangers from series three, Yvonne in the frame for Virginia O&#x27;Kane&#x27;s (Kate O&#x27;Mara) murder there is a game of cat and mouse between her and Fenner while the real culprits continue their reign over G-Wing. But it&#x27;s not long before Yvonne is ruling the roost again, when Denny returns in the nick of time and aids Yvonne in her bid to prove her innocence. She arrives with Roisin Connor and Cassie Tyler, imprisoned for fraud and in a lesbian relationship complicated not only by their being behind bars, but by Roisin&#x27;s being a married mother-of-two. The stress of G-Wing mounts for Karen Betts (Claire King), especially when she and Fenner split, but the stress is no longer her problem when she is demoted to basic officer and he is promoted to Wing Governor by Neil Grayling (James Gaddas), the new Governing Governor of Larkhall, who developed an attraction to Fenner. The series tackled domestic violence within the relationship of Di and Barry Pearce and teenage junkie Buki&#x27;s battle for the right to see her disabled son, Lennox. The bitter hatred between Maxi and Shaz Wiley (Lindsey Fawcett) grows and ends in tragedy following a brutal fight. Crystal Gordon (Sharon Duncan Brewster) gives birth in the four-bed dorm to a daughter but soon loses her faith in religion when another baby in the prison dies. Rhiannon Dawson, Julie Johnston&#x27;s (Kika Mirylees) daughter arrives on the wing and the Julies are soon facing an additional sentence when the truth about Rhiannon&#x27;s relationship with her boyfriend, Damion, is revealed. Yvonne and Karen find themselves at war when Yvonne&#x27;s son, Ritchie, is revealed to be having a relationship with Karen. This is later revealed as a decoy, as his real girlfriend is new devious inmate, Snowball Merriman (Nicole Faraday), whom Ritchie is helping to escape from Larkhall. The fourth series ended with the prison library being obliterated as part of an escape plan by Snowball, resulting in a fire that left several inmates trapped and fighting for their lives.

===Series 5 (2003)===
The fifth series of Bad Girls saw the brief return of a recaptured and pregnant Shell to G-Wing. Fenner pimps Shell by offering her money to give the male officers a handjob. After the baby&#x27;s birth, new screw, Colin Hedges tries to force her to have sex, when she violently refuses, Fenner makes it seem as if she tried to smother her baby. Shell is removed to a mental home, and her baby is taken into care.

The &quot;Costa Cons&quot;, Bev Tull (Amanda Barrie) and Phyl Oswyn (Stephanie Beacham) arrive. There is good news for Denny, who is transferred to an open prison.

Julie Saunders is diagnosed with breast cancer and takes the decision to take her chances without chemotherapy treatment. Barbara Hunt (Isabelle Amyes) marries the former prison chaplain, Henry Mills – bad news for Sylvia, who had set her sights on Henry after she was widowed when her husband, Bobby committed suicide.

New prison officer Selena Geeson (Charlotte Lucas) and new inmate Kris Yates (Jennifer Ness) are in a relationship. Kris is taking the rap for killing her abusive father in order to spare her younger sister, Milly, the real culprit. Fenner&#x27;s nefarious ways continue when he kills Yvonne as she tries to escape Larkhall, by ensuring that she will be trapped in the &quot;hanging cell&quot;, a small room beneath the main prison that is blocked off from the outside world.

===Series 6 (2004)===

With G-Wing thinking their ex-top dog has escaped HMP Larkhall, Kris finds Yvonne&#x27;s corpse after she tries to follow the same way out; as it is all blocked off, she tells Selena who she found. Selena then tells Neil she found Yvonne. Yvonne&#x27;s death shocks G-Wing. In her absence, Phyl is G-Wing top dog for a short time before being stopped in her tracks by new Wing Governor Frances Myers (Eva Pope).

Frances soon begins a feud with new inmate Natalie Buxton (Dannielle Brent), in prison for organising a prostitution ring using underage girls. The other girls are disgusted with Natalie and Al McKenzie (Pauline Campbell) plans to beat her up, but Natalie turns the tables and beats Al up. Natalie soon makes the other girls believe she is innocent.

The series features a crossover with Shed Productions&#x27; other hit series, Footballers&#x27; Wives, with the glamorous character of Tanya Turner (Zöe Lucker) enduring a spell on G-Wing for three special episodes that aired over consecutive nights in May 2004. Later Tanya is soon released, after striking a deal with Frances. During her time on G-Wing, Tanya was accused of poisoning her fellow inmates with rhubarb, with Al dying from her illness, however, it was soon uncovered that Bev and Phyl were actually responsible.

Kris&#x27; sister, Milly, commits suicide after Selena puts her under pressure to confess to her father&#x27;s killing (in self-defence) in order to free her sister. Kris and Selena split and Kris sleeps with Natalie but the couple are reconciled and the series ends with the cliffhanger of Kris and Selena protesting in London about the injustice of Kris being behind bars.

Fenner marries Neil&#x27;s ex-wife Di. As Neil and Karen are sure Fenner has something to do with the hit and run Karen was accused of, they hire a private investigator to prove Karen&#x27;s innocence. Fenner is proven to have been the person who was running away from where Karen&#x27;s car was dumped that night. Fenner is later arrested on his and Di&#x27;s wedding day.

===Series 7 (2005)===

This series does not follow up on the Series 6 cliffhanger and Kris and Selena neither feature nor are mentioned in this series. Series 7 sees a big cast upheaval with original officer Fenner leaving along with two other long standing characters, Di and Dr. Malcolm Nicholson.

Di, now Fenner&#x27;s wife, lies to ensure he is released from prison and Fenner returns, not only to G-Wing, but as Wing Governor. When Bev and Phyl escape to Spain, Neil is demoted to Wing Governor and Fenner promoted to Acting Governing Governor. Before Fenner can start his new job, he is murdered in the &quot;hanging cell&quot; during a memorial service for Yvonne Atkins. The police have a host of suspects to choose from, including new bisexual lifer, Pat Kerrigan (Liz May Brice), a woman who is in jail for murdering her abusive boyfriend and is a recent transfer from Alberton prison. Pat had already managed to develop a feud with Fenner over his treatment of Sheena Williams (Laura Rogers) and her son, Dylan. The increasingly mentally unstable Julie J later reveals that she committed the crime to exact vengeance against Fenner for all his past crimes, in particular, the death of Yvonne. However, it is Fenner&#x27;s widow Di who is arrested, charged and remanded in custody for the offence. New Governing Governor Joy Masterton (Ellie Haddington) arrives and indicates she will instigate a tough regime at Larkhall.

Meanwhile, Natalie has taken over as G-Wing&#x27;s new Top Dog. When Natalie and the other inmates find out that new inmate Arun Parmar (Rebecca Hazlewood) is transgender, Natalie makes her life hell until Pat, annoyed by Natalie&#x27;s bullying of Arun, beats her in a fight and demands she leave Arun alone. Pat develops a romance with recovering drug addict and single mother Sheena before managing to expose Natalie, despite her denials to the contrary, as having been involved in the prostitution of underage girls.

===Series 8 (2006)===

The series begins two years after the end of series seven and with the arrival of Emira Al Jahani (Laura Dos Santos), a Muslim whose husband is a suspected terrorist. When Neil and new prisoner Ashley Wilcox (Sandra De Sousa) die and other prisoners fall ill, Emira is accused of biological terrorism. However, it is later established that Neil has been suffering from a previously undiscovered heart condition &quot;Coronary Heart Disease&quot; which would have aided his death from a Legionnaire&#x27;s Disease outbreak which was caused by a faulty air-conditioning unit, which was discovered when Lou Stoke found the one in Neil&#x27;s office broken and dripping water.

New G-Wing Governor Lou Stoke (Amanda Donohoe) develops a romance with the prison doctor Rowan Dunlop (Colin Salmon), not knowing he is married; she also tries to find her missing sister. Meanwhile, Pat is sickened by Natalie&#x27;s use of a child in smuggling drugs into the prison and plans to get rid of her for good. Pat devises a plan in which she will trick Natalie into trying to escape, but Natalie realises she is being tricked and a fight ensues, which ends when Pat fatally hits Natalie over the head with a rock. With the help of the two Julies, Pat disposes of Natalie&#x27;s body in the sewers beneath the prison, making it seem as if Natalie has indeed escaped from Larkhall.

Inmate Janine Nebeski (Nicola Stapleton) and new prison officer Donny Kimber (Sid Owen) embark on a romance that leaves her pregnant. With help from Bev, Phyl and Tina O&#x27;Kane (Victoria Bush), Janine gives birth in her cell and names the baby after Bev. Long-term inmate Tina is released for the second time but, as before, she struggles to adapt to life in the outside world and commits another crime. She takes a bank hostage with a toy gun during which a man suffers a fatal heart attack; she is re-imprisoned again. Joy&#x27;s long-lost daughter Stella Gough (Helen Modern) turns up as an inmate at the prison, but is shipped out after taking her mother hostage. Darlene Cake (Antonia Okonma) is tricked into killing new inmate Catherine Earlham&#x27;s husband and tries to commit suicide, but is saved by Donny. Natalie&#x27;s spirit returns in the last episode to haunt Sylvia and teach her the error of her ways.

==Broadcast==
===Syndication===
&quot;Bad Girls&quot; received a complete run of repeats on ITV2 following their initial broadcasts on the original channel. In 2005, when new series were still being screened on ITV, the network bid against UKTV Gold for the rights to screen the show from the beginning. From 1 September 2005, the series commenced a re-screening on ITV3, in which the first series was screened. From 5 September 2006, ITV3 again aired the complete first series, with both series two and series three following, and finished broadcast in early 2007. This was the final time ITV broadcast &quot;Bad Girls&quot; as their rights to the series had expired. In 2006, Five Life had acquired the rights to screen the fourth series, perhaps to pick up where ITV3 had left off. &quot;Bad Girls&quot; (along with the first series of &quot;Footballers&#x27; Wives&quot;) began airing on the channel in spring 2007 following the third series on ITV3. However, no subsequent series followed on Five Life.

In 2010, CBS Drama acquired the rights to &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, with the series debuting on 4 October 2010. Initially, for licensing reasons, the first seven series&#x27; were only broadcast, between October 2010 and February 2011. After ITV&#x27;s rights of the eighth series expired, CBS Drama gave the series a re-run from 7 March 2011, with the inclusion of Series Eight, which premiered on the channel in July 2011. The series had been re-screened several times on the channel, again from August 2012 and for the final time from 5 July 2013 in a new late-night time of 12:10 am. In July 2014, CBS Drama announced, via their Facebook page, that they no longer have the rights to show &quot;Bad Girls&quot;.

After a short hiatus, CBS Drama&#x27;s sister channel CBS Action began broadcast of the series on 21 October 2015 from Monday to Friday at 10:00 pm, with times varying on some nights. The week&#x27;s five episodes had been repeated on Saturdays from 9:00 pm. CBS Action&#x27;s format of the series followed the same format as CBS Drama, in that, the extended episodes which originally screened at 90 minutes on ITV were edited into two parts and shown on consecutive nights. CBS Action completed its first run of the series, with the final episode broadcast on 29 March 2016. &quot;Bad Girls&quot; once again screened the series from the very beginning on CBS Action from 30 March 2016. No repeated episodes were screened for this run. This run of the series concluded on 6 September 2016, and a third run will not be screened.

Despite the announcement that the series would not return to CBS Drama, it did however appear for the channel&#x27;s autumn programming line-up, beginning on 3 October 2016, with double episodes airing each weeknight from 10:00 pm, with repeated episodes broadcast over Saturday and Sunday nights. The series was completed on 21 December 2016. A rerun of the series commenced broadcast once again on CBS Drama, with one episode screening each weeknight from 29 March 2017 at 10:00 pm, while all of the week&#x27;s catch-up episodes screen Saturday nights from 10:00 pm. CBS Drama completed this run on 5 September 2017. A third run of the series on CBS Drama commenced airing from 12 February 2018, with singular episodes screened each weeknight at 11:00 pm and a repeat of the week&#x27;s episodes on Sundays from 11:00 pm. The Sunday repeats were later removed from the schedule. The final run ended on 20 July 2018 as CBS no longer hold the rights to screen the series.

In 2019, an official YouTube channel dedicated to &quot;Bad Girls&quot; was launched in the hope of releasing the entire series free to the service, which never eventuated. However, a collection of clips and scenes from each series were instead made available.

In May 2021, &quot;Bad Girls&quot; was acquired by UKTV for its Drama channel and premiered on 26 July 2021 where it aired Monday to Friday in a late-night timeslot. Only the first week of episodes were repeated on Sunday night. The series is also available to stream on UKTV Play. The series was acquired by BritBox on 23 December, two days after its run ended on Drama. It is also available to stream on ITVX.

===International===
The series has endured success outside of the United Kingdom and has established a loyal fan base. It became popular in Australia, despite not attracting high viewing figures when it was first broadcast on the Seven Network in 2000; however, it gained a vast audience when it screened during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The Seven Network only aired the first three series as it was cancelled due to poor ratings. UKTV in Australia screened the first four series, after which, the series was dropped but was later re aired and the final four series were aired. In New Zealand, it received a complete run when it was broadcast on TV One.

In the United States, &quot;Bad Girls&quot; was initially broadcast on BBC America, lasting the complete first series and the first ten episodes of the second series and was aired Tuesday nights. It was eventually removed from BBC America&#x27;s Schedule. Due to its popularity in the U.S., especially among the LGBT community, the series moved to the LGBT-oriented network Logo TV, where it received a full eight-series screening. Similar to the U.S. channel Logo, the series was available in Canada via OutTV which was acquired in 2006 and broadcast all eight series.

In Ireland, the series was broadcast on TV3 from 2001, and by the fifth series, it was exactly in pace with ITV&#x27;s broadcasts at 9:00 pm, and remained as such until the final episode in 2006. TV3 have re-screened episodes; however, they no longer hold broadcasting rights.

In South Africa, the series endured enormous success when it was broadcast M-NET. While the network was still screening series two in 2001, the cast of &quot;Bad Girls&quot; travelled to South Africa as part of a promotional tour for the documentary &quot;Bad Girls in South Africa&quot;; due to its growing popularity, the network secured the rights to the third series as the cast were on tour.

In France, under the title &quot;Les condamnées&quot;, the series was initially broadcast on NT1 on 12 December 2002&quot;, with series one to seven, and AB1 with series one to six. In Luxembourg, &quot;Bad Girls&quot; is broadcast on RTL9, receiving a seven-series run and is internationally available to viewers in France, Belgium and Switzerland. In Sweden, the series is re-titled &quot;Bakom Järngaller&quot; and it was aired on TV4 with the first seven series&#x27;.

A four-series run has been screened in Belgium, where it is broadcast on Vtm and Serbia on TV Košava.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Early reviews of the series were generally mixed&#x27; However, later reviews were much more favourable. The Daily Telegraph stated that the series is &quot;One of the biggest television drama hits of recent years&quot; and that it was &quot;Almost embarrassingly gripping&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that it is a &quot;Jewel in the Crown of prime time ITV&quot; and that &quot;Network executives must be thankful they have a rare, if unexpected success in Bad Girls.&quot; They also said that it is &quot;Less cosy than other dramas ... no sick animals or people are healed.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; also mentioned of an early storyline, in particular, featuring the relationship between Wing-governor Helen Stewart and prisoner Nikki Wade was &quot;praised for its treatment of a homosexual relationship in a responsible way&quot;. DVD Monthly reviewed the series and cited that &quot;Bad Girls is a brilliant drama about life in a ladies prison. It&#x27;s gritty, well written and fully merits the phrase &#x27;hard hitting&#x27;&quot; and that it &quot;Makes compulsive viewing and does so with a level of intelligence and honesty&quot;.

In a review for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, John Leonard gave the series a positive review, commenting that &quot;although &quot;Bad Girls&quot; probably wouldn’t have lasted eight seasons on ITV in Great Britain had it appealed only to lesbians, the prison drama’s strong same-sex story lines were doubtless what got the attention of Logo&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;don’t imagine you are tuning in to &quot;The L Word&quot; behind bars. &quot;Bad Girls&quot; is much better than that—it has a rough &quot;Oz&quot; edge and some of the feminist wit of Jonathan Demme’s &quot;Caged Heat&quot;&quot;.

The first three series of &quot;Bad Girls&quot; were the most successful. After the first three series, the show slightly declined in quality for the fourth and fifth series. Nonetheless, the show continued to earn high viewing figures. Series Six of &quot;Bad Girls&quot; was considered the most successful series after the first three series as it performed somewhat better than the previous two. The seventh series mostly saw viewing figures drop; although the Series Seven finale, the Christmas special, did perform very well. Series Eight had a further drop in viewing figures, and was the last series before cancellation.

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Bad Girls&quot; has been nominated for several awards, most notably at the National Television Awards, where it had received a total of nine nominations, winning twice; in 2000 and again in 2001, receiving the award for Most Popular Drama Series, during the point where the series was at its most successful. Debra Stephenson received a nomination for Most Popular Actress in 2001 for her portrayal of Shell Dockley, and was the only cast member in the series ever to receive a nomination at the National Television Awards. The series received further nominations for Most Popular Drama Series each year between 2002 and 2006. The series received eight TV Quick nominations between 2000 and 2004, winning all eight in total; becoming the recipient of four awards for Best Loved Drama from 2000 to 2003, while cast recipients include Debra Stephenson for Best Actress in 2001, Claire King for Best Actress in both 2002 and 2003, and Jack Ellis for Best Actor in 2004. The series also won two &quot;Inside Soap&quot; Awards in 2003 and 2005.

===Ratings===
==Home media==
Initially, Bad Girls had been released on VHS format via the Contender Entertainment Group. The first series was released on 5 June 2000, with the second series was made available on 2 October 2000. Subsequently, the third and fourth series were made available in 2002 and 2003, and the fifth series, which was released by 2 Entertain, was available in 2004. These had been the only series to receive VHS releases as the format became obsolete for most titles at this point.

In 2001, Contender commenced releasing the series on DVD. Series One to Four had been released by the company between 2001 and 2003, after which they did not hold the rights to any subsequent series. A box set containing the first four series was available from 2006. Each set did contain several special features including interviews, outtakes, photo galleries, deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage, and a soundtrack CD which was available with Series Three. For the first three series, they had been cropped from their originally-produced 16:9 versions and received an aspect ratio of 4:3, as they had been transfers from the VHS releases. Furthermore, each of the recap sequences at the beginning of each episode had been removed, with the exception of the first and fifth episodes from the third series. The &#x27;Next Time&#x27; clips which had started from the end of each Series Three episode (not produced as part of the first two series) had also been removed from the DVD releases. Series Four was virtually untouched, as each episode was available in 16:9, with each recap and &#x27;Next Time&#x27; clip package intact. As the title of each episode did not display on the original television airings, they had been included in the opening scene of each episode for the DVD releases.

Distribution company, 2 Entertain acquired the rights to release the series from 2004. Between 2004 and 2006, Series Five to Eight had been released, each bringing newly commissioned artwork, different to the previous styles. Like Series Four, each episode following this was complete and uncut, in an original aspect ratio of 16:9, with recaps and &#x27;Next Time&#x27; scenes included. For these new releases, each episode had their series and episode number displayed below the Bad Girls title in the opening sequence. For example, &#x27;Series 5, Episode 1&#x27; and so forth. A set comprising Series Five to Eight was made available in 2007. Special features were also included in each set.

Contender and 2 Entertain no longer hold the rights to release the series for home entertainment purposes, and all DVD sets are now out of print.

In 2011 Acorn Media began releasing Bad Girls on DVD from the very beginning. Each series contains newly commissioned artwork, some of the series also contain less discs than in previous releases. Series one has been given new certificate by the BBFC, previously given an &#x27;18&#x27; for disturbing scenes of violence, it has now been reduced to a &#x27;15&#x27; certificate. Also for the first time, series one to three has been released in their original widescreen format, and they contain subtitles, as does series four, which were previously not included. Bad Girls: The Complete Collection was released on 2 July 2012, for the first time all eight series are included in a complete boxset. The first three series are now available in their original widescreen 16:9 format with the recap sequences included for Series One and Series Two. Series Three still contains no recap or &#x27;Next Time&#x27; clips from the Acorn Media release, except for the recap on the first episode only.

In the first episode of Series One of Bad Girls, the song featured in the ITV broadcasts, &quot;If You Buy This Record (Your Life Will Be Better)&quot; performed by The Tamperer featuring Maya was replaced in both the Contender and Acorn Media releases. In Series Eight, two songs which were featured in the ITV broadcasts, an alternative version of &quot;Peace Train&quot; performed by Dolly Parton and &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; performed by Village People were replaced in the 2 Entertain and Acorn Media releases. The CBS Drama broadcasts of these episodes contained the same versions as the DVD releases.

==In other media==
===&quot;Bad Girls: The Inside Story&quot;===
&quot;Bad Girls: The Inside Story&quot;, a companion book to the show was written by Jodi Reynolds and Jamie McCallum and published on 8 May 2001 and was to coincide with the third series of &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, which was currently being broadcast at the time, and at its peak of popularity. The text is a guide to Larkhall prison&#x27;s G-wing and its most notorious inmates, with additional information on the show. The book is currently out-of-print as of 6 February 2002.

===&quot;Bad Girls: The Musical&quot;===

A musical comedy adaptation, based on the characters and storylines of series 1, including the events of the death of inmate, Rachel Hicks, and the relationship between Wing Governor Helen Stewart and lifer, Nikki Wade. The musical originates with the same creative staff which worked on the television program. Maureen Chadwick and Ann McManus, of Shed Productions, are the book writers of the musical, and Kath Gotts, composer for Bad Girls series 2 – 4, is the composer-lyricist. The first full production of the musical premiered at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in May – June 2006. A West End production began a run at the Garrick Theatre in August 2007, closing in November 2007 (four months earlier than intended). A DVD version of the musical has since been released. A national tour of Bad Girls The Musical has been ruled out.

===&quot;Bad Girls: Most Wanted&quot;===
Following the Series 6 finale on ITV1, a behind-the-scenes special, hosted by Jack Ellis, was broadcast on ITV2 at 10:30 pm on 23 August 2004 and ranked the top ten most popular prisoners of the series. It also included outtakes and clips from &quot;Bad Girls: The Musical&quot;. The list, in ascending order, includes Tina O’Kane, the Two Julies, Natalie Buxton, the Costa Cons, Denny Blood, Kris Yates, Darlene Cake, Nikki Wade, Shell Dockley and Yvonne Atkins in first place.

===Proposed remake===
HBO was developing a U.S. remake, with the same characters and same storylines. Shed Productions had been involved in talks since as early as 2002 regarding a US version of &quot;Bad Girls&quot;. In 2006 it was announced that FX would be bringing an American version of &quot;Bad Girls&quot; to US screens, but Shed subsequently vetoed FX&#x27;s original pilot script after the show was given a &quot;really gritty and unpleasant&quot; feel like that of &quot;Oz&quot;.

In 2008, Eileen Gallagher, CEO of Shed Productions&#x27; parent company Shed Media, announced that HBO bought the rights to the show from FX. HBO&#x27;s version of &quot;Bad Girls&quot; was being developed with creative input from &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; writer Alan Ball, and was to be written by Nancy Oliver and Raelle Tucker. According to Gallagher, the HBO team intended to stick very closely to the characters and storylines from the original show.

In February 2012, it was confirmed that NBC would be developing an American remake version of &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, but the network eventually passed on the series after confirming its lineup for the 2012–2013 season in May 2012. In October 2012 it was reported that the adaptation would be redeveloped, but no news beyond that was ever reported and the show never came to fruition.

===Reunion===
In March 2021, eleven cast members of &quot;Bad Girls&quot; appeared for a special reunion on the YouTube channel, The Lewis Nicholls Show. Those who appeared included, Victoria Alcock, Victoria Bush, Pauline Campbell, Jack Ellis, Alicya Eyo, Nicole Faraday, Lindsey Fawcett, Claire King, Kerry Norton, Kim Oliver and Debra Stephenson.

In 2014, Simone Lahbib was approached by fans of the show with the suggestion of organising a Bad Girls convention which fans could attend. This also gave her the idea of incorporating within the event an opportunity to raise money for the ‘Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund’ which aims to build a respite holiday home in Stirlingshire for families with children with cancer.

<doc id="1243550" wikidata="Q2915184" url="?curid=1243550" title="Rigid rotor">
<text>In rotordynamics, the rigid rotor is a mechanical model of rotating systems. An arbitrary rigid rotor is a 3-dimensional rigid object, such as a top. To orient such an object in space requires three angles, known as Euler angles. A special rigid rotor is the &quot;linear rotor&quot; requiring only two angles to describe, for example of a diatomic molecule. More general molecules are 3-dimensional, such as water (asymmetric rotor), ammonia (symmetric rotor), or methane (spherical rotor).

== Linear rotor ==
The linear rigid rotor model consists of two point masses located at fixed distances from their center of mass. The fixed distance between the two masses and the values of the masses are the only characteristics of the rigid model. However, for many actual diatomics this model is too restrictive since distances are usually not completely fixed. Corrections on the rigid model can be made to compensate for small variations in the distance. Even in such a case the rigid rotor model is a useful point of departure (zeroth-order model).

=== Classical linear rigid rotor ===
The classical linear rotor consists of two point masses formula_1 and formula_2 (with reduced mass formula_3) at a distance formula_4 of each other. The rotor is rigid if formula_4 is independent of time. The kinematics of a linear rigid rotor is usually described by means of spherical polar coordinates, which form a coordinate system of R3. In the physics convention the coordinates are the co-latitude (zenith) angle formula_6, the longitudinal (azimuth) angle formula_7 and the distance formula_4. The angles specify the orientation of the rotor in space. The kinetic energy formula_9 of the linear rigid rotor is given by
formula_10

where formula_11 and formula_12 are scale (or Lamé) factors.

Scale factors are of importance for quantum mechanical applications since they enter the Laplacian expressed in curvilinear coordinates. In the case at hand (constant formula_4)
formula_14

The classical Hamiltonian function of the linear rigid rotor is
formula_15

=== Quantum mechanical linear rigid rotor ===
The linear rigid rotor model can be used in quantum mechanics to predict the rotational energy of a diatomic molecule. The rotational energy depends on the moment of inertia for the system, formula_16. In the center of mass reference frame, the moment of inertia is equal to:

formula_17

where formula_18 is the reduced mass of the molecule and formula_4 is the distance between the two atoms.

According to quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a system can be determined by solving the Schrödinger equation:

formula_20

where formula_21 is the wave function and formula_22 is the energy (Hamiltonian) operator. For the rigid rotor in a field-free space, the energy operator corresponds to the kinetic energy of the system:

formula_23

where formula_24 is reduced Planck constant and formula_25 is the Laplacian. The Laplacian is given above in terms of spherical polar coordinates. The energy operator written in terms of these coordinates is:

formula_26

This operator appears also in the Schrödinger equation of the hydrogen atom after the radial part is separated off. The eigenvalue equation becomes
formula_27
The symbol formula_28 represents a set of functions known as the spherical harmonics. Note that the energy does depend on formula_29through &quot;I&quot;. The energy 
formula_30
is formula_31-fold degenerate: the functions with fixed formula_32 and formula_33 have the same energy.

Introducing the &quot;rotational constant&quot; formula_34, we write,
formula_35
In the units of reciprocal length the rotational constant is,
formula_36
with &quot;c&quot; the speed of light. If cgs units are used for formula_37, formula_38, and formula_39, formula_40 is expressed in cm−1, or wave numbers, which is a unit that is often used for rotational-vibrational spectroscopy. The rotational constant formula_41 depends on the distance formula_4. Often one writes formula_43 where formula_44 is the equilibrium value of formula_4 (the value for which the interaction energy of the atoms in the rotor has a minimum).

A typical rotational absorption spectrum consists of a series of peaks that correspond to transitions between levels with different values of the angular momentum quantum number (formula_32) such that formula_47, due to the selection rules (see below). Consequently, rotational peaks appear at energies with differences corresponding to an integer multiple of formula_48.

=== Selection rules ===
Rotational transitions of a molecule occur when the molecule absorbs a photon [a particle of a quantized electromagnetic (em) field]. Depending on the energy of the photon (i.e., the wavelength of the em field) this transition may be seen as a sideband of a vibrational and/or 
electronic transition. Pure rotational transitions, in which the vibronic (= vibrational plus electronic) wave function does not change, occur in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Typically, rotational transitions can only be observed when the angular momentum quantum number changes by formula_49 formula_50. This selection rule arises from a first-order perturbation theory approximation of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. According to this treatment, rotational transitions can only be observed when one or more components of the dipole operator have a non-vanishing transition moment. If formula_51 is the direction of the electric field component of the incoming electromagnetic wave, the transition moment is,
formula_52

A transition occurs if this integral is non-zero. By separating the rotational part of the molecular wavefunction from the vibronic part, one can show that this means that the molecule must have a permanent dipole moment. After integration over the vibronic coordinates the following rotational part of the transition moment remains,

formula_53
Here formula_54 is the &quot;z&quot; component of the permanent dipole moment. The moment formula_18 is the vibronically averaged component of the dipole operator. Only the component of the permanent dipole along the axis of a heteronuclear molecule is non-vanishing.
By the use of the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics formula_56 it is possible to determine which values of formula_57, formula_58, formula_59, and formula_60 will result in nonzero values for the dipole transition moment integral. This constraint results in the observed selection rules for the rigid rotor:

formula_61

=== Non-rigid linear rotor ===
The rigid rotor is commonly used to describe the rotational energy of diatomic molecules but it is not a completely accurate description of such molecules. This is because molecular bonds (and therefore the interatomic distance formula_4) are not completely fixed; the bond between the atoms stretches out as the molecule rotates faster (higher values of the rotational quantum number formula_57). This effect can be accounted for by introducing a correction factor known as the centrifugal distortion constant formula_64 (bars on top of various quantities indicate that these quantities are expressed in cm−1):

formula_65

where
*formula_66
*formula_67 is the fundamental vibrational frequency of the bond (in cm−1). This frequency is related to the reduced mass and the force constant (bond strength) of the molecule according to formula_68

The non-rigid rotor is an acceptably accurate model for diatomic molecules but is still somewhat imperfect. This is because, although the model does account for bond stretching due to rotation, it ignores any bond stretching due to vibrational energy in the bond (anharmonicity in the potential).

== Arbitrarily shaped rigid rotor ==
An arbitrarily shaped rigid rotor is a rigid body of arbitrary shape with its center of mass fixed (or in uniform rectilinear motion) in field-free space R3, so that its energy consists only of rotational kinetic energy (and possibly constant translational energy that can be ignored). A rigid body can be (partially) characterized by the three eigenvalues of its moment of inertia tensor, which are real nonnegative values known as &quot;principal moments of inertia&quot;.
In microwave spectroscopy—the spectroscopy based on rotational transitions—one usually classifies molecules (seen as rigid rotors) as follows:
* spherical rotors
* symmetric rotors
** oblate symmetric rotors
** prolate symmetric rotors
* asymmetric rotors
This classification depends on the relative magnitudes of the principal moments of inertia.

=== Coordinates of the rigid rotor ===
Different branches of physics and engineering use different coordinates for the description of the kinematics of a rigid rotor. In molecular physics Euler angles are used almost exclusively. In quantum mechanical applications it is advantageous to use Euler angles in a convention that is a simple extension of the physical convention of spherical polar coordinates.

The first step is the attachment of a right-handed orthonormal frame (3-dimensional system of orthogonal axes) to the rotor (a body-fixed frame) . This frame can be attached arbitrarily to the body, but often one uses the principal axes frame—the normalized eigenvectors of the inertia tensor, which always can be chosen orthonormal, since the tensor is symmetric. When the rotor possesses a symmetry-axis, it usually coincides with one of the principal axes. It is convenient to choose
as body-fixed &quot;z&quot;-axis the highest-order symmetry axis.

One starts by aligning the body-fixed frame with a space-fixed frame (laboratory axes), so that the body-fixed &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; axes coincide with the space-fixed &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; axis. Secondly, the body and its frame are rotated actively over a positive angle formula_69 around the &quot;z&quot;-axis (by the right-hand rule), which moves the formula_70- to the formula_71-axis. Thirdly, one rotates the body and its frame over a positive angle formula_72 around the formula_71-axis. The &quot;z&quot;-axis of the body-fixed frame has after these two rotations the longitudinal angle formula_74 (commonly designated by formula_7) and the colatitude angle formula_72 (commonly designated by formula_77), both with respect to the space-fixed frame. If the rotor were cylindrical symmetric around its &quot;z&quot;-axis, like the linear rigid rotor, its orientation in space would be unambiguously specified at this point.

If the body lacks cylinder (axial) symmetry, a last rotation around its &quot;z&quot;-axis (which has polar coordinates formula_72 and formula_69) is necessary to specify its orientation completely. Traditionally the last rotation angle is called formula_80.

The convention for Euler angles described here is known as the formula_81 convention; it can be shown (in the same manner as in this article) that it is equivalent to the formula_82 convention in which the order of rotations is reversed.

The total matrix of the three consecutive rotations is the product

formula_83

Let formula_84 be the coordinate vector of an arbitrary point formula_85 in the body with respect to the body-fixed frame. The elements of formula_84 are the &#x27;body-fixed coordinates&#x27; of formula_85. Initially formula_84 is also the space-fixed coordinate vector of formula_85. Upon rotation of the body, the body-fixed coordinates of formula_85 do not change, but the space-fixed coordinate vector of formula_85 becomes,
formula_92
In particular, if formula_85 is initially on the space-fixed &quot;Z&quot;-axis, it has the space-fixed coordinates
formula_94
which shows the correspondence with the spherical polar coordinates (in the physical convention).

Knowledge of the Euler angles as function of time &quot;t&quot; and the initial coordinates formula_84 determine the kinematics of the rigid rotor.

=== Classical kinetic energy ===
It will be assumed from here on that the body-fixed frame is a principal axes frame; it diagonalizes the instantaneous inertia tensor formula_96 (expressed with respect to the space-fixed frame), i.e.,
formula_97
where the Euler angles are time-dependent and in fact determine the time dependence of formula_98 by the inverse of this equation. This notation implies
that at formula_99 the Euler angles are zero, so that at formula_99 the body-fixed frame coincides with the space-fixed frame.

The classical kinetic energy &quot;T&quot; of the rigid rotor can be expressed in different ways:

* as a function of angular velocity
* in Lagrangian form
* as a function of angular momentum
* in Hamiltonian form.

Since each of these forms has its use and can be found in textbooks we will present all of them.

==== Angular velocity form ====
As a function of angular velocity &quot;T&quot; reads,
formula_101
with
formula_102

The vector formula_103 on the left hand side contains the components of the angular velocity of the rotor expressed with respect to the body-fixed frame. The angular velocity satisfies equations of motion known as Euler&#x27;s equations (with zero applied torque, since by assumption the rotor is in field-free space). It can be shown that formula_104 is &quot;not&quot; the time derivative of any vector, in contrast to the usual definition of velocity.

The dots over the time-dependent Euler angles on the right hand side indicate time derivatives. Note that a different rotation matrix would result from a different choice of Euler angle convention used.

==== Lagrange form ====
Backsubstitution of the expression of formula_104 into &quot;T&quot; gives
the kinetic energy in Lagrange form (as a function of the time derivatives of the Euler angles). In matrix-vector notation,
formula_106
where formula_107 is the metric tensor expressed in Euler angles—a non-orthogonal system of curvilinear coordinates—

formula_108

==== Angular momentum form ====
Often the kinetic energy is written as a function of the angular momentum formula_109 of the rigid rotor. With respect to the body-fixed frame it has the components formula_110, and can be shown to be related to the angular velocity,
formula_111
This angular momentum is a conserved (time-independent) quantity if viewed from a stationary space-fixed frame. Since the body-fixed frame moves (depends on time) the components formula_110 are &quot;not&quot; time independent. If we were to represent formula_109 with respect to the stationary space-fixed frame, we would
find time independent expressions for its components.

The kinetic energy is expressed in terms of the angular momentum by 
formula_114

==== Hamilton form ====
The Hamilton form of the kinetic energy is written in terms of generalized momenta
formula_115
where it is used that the formula_107 is symmetric. In Hamilton form the kinetic energy is,
formula_117
with the inverse metric tensor given by
formula_118

This inverse tensor is needed to obtain the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which (multiplied by formula_119) gives the quantum mechanical energy operator of the rigid rotor.

The classical Hamiltonian given above can be rewritten to the following expression, which is needed in the phase integral arising in the classical statistical mechanics of rigid rotors,
formula_120

=== Quantum mechanical rigid rotor ===

As usual quantization is performed by the replacement of the generalized momenta by operators that give first derivatives with respect to its canonically conjugate variables (positions). Thus,
formula_121
and similarly for formula_122 and formula_123. It is remarkable that this rule replaces the fairly complicated function formula_124 of all three Euler angles, time derivatives of Euler angles, and inertia moments (characterizing the rigid rotor) by a simple differential operator that does not depend on time or inertia moments and differentiates to one Euler angle only.

The quantization rule is sufficient to obtain the operators that correspond with the classical angular momenta. There are two kinds: space-fixed and body-fixed
angular momentum operators. Both are vector operators, i.e., both have three components that transform as vector components among themselves upon rotation of the space-fixed and the body-fixed frame, respectively. The explicit form of the rigid rotor angular momentum operators is given here (but beware, they must be multiplied with formula_24). The body-fixed angular momentum operators are written as formula_126. They satisfy &quot;anomalous commutation relations&quot;.

The quantization rule is &quot;not&quot; sufficient to obtain the kinetic energy operator from the classical Hamiltonian. Since classically formula_122 commutes with formula_128 and formula_129 and the inverses of these functions, the position of these trigonometric functions in the classical Hamiltonian is arbitrary. After
quantization the commutation does no longer hold and the order of operators and functions in the Hamiltonian (energy operator) becomes a point of concern. Podolsky proposed in 1928 that the Laplace-Beltrami operator (times formula_130) has the appropriate form for the quantum mechanical kinetic energy operator. This operator has the general form (summation convention: sum over repeated indices—in this case over the three Euler angles formula_131):

formula_132
where formula_133 is the determinant of the g-tensor:
formula_134
Given the inverse of the metric tensor above, the explicit form of the kinetic energy operator in terms of Euler angles follows by simple substitution. (Note: The corresponding eigenvalue equation gives the Schrödinger equation for the rigid rotor in the form that it was solved for the first time by Kronig and Rabi (for the special case of the symmetric rotor). This is one of the few cases where the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically. All these cases were solved within a year of the formulation of the Schrödinger equation.)

Nowadays it is common to proceed as follows. It can be shown that formula_135 can be expressed in body-fixed angular momentum operators (in this proof one must carefully commute differential operators with trigonometric functions). The result has the same appearance as the classical formula expressed in body-fixed coordinates,
formula_136
The action of the formula_126 on the Wigner D-matrix is simple. In particular
formula_138
so that the Schrödinger equation for the spherical rotor (formula_139) is solved with the formula_140 degenerate energy equal to formula_141.

The symmetric top (= symmetric rotor) is characterized by formula_142. It is a &quot;prolate&quot; (cigar shaped) top if formula_143. In the latter case we write the Hamiltonian as
formula_144
and use that 
formula_145
Hence
formula_146
The eigenvalue formula_147 is formula_148-fold degenerate, for all eigenfunctions with formula_149 have the same eigenvalue. The energies with |k| &gt; 0 are formula_150-fold degenerate. This exact solution of the Schrödinger equation of the symmetric top was first found in 1927.

The asymmetric top problem (formula_151) is not soluble analytically.

== Direct experimental observation of molecular rotations ==
For a long time, molecular rotations could not be directly observed experimentally. Only measurement techniques with atomic resolution made it possible to detect the rotation of a single molecule. At low temperatures, the rotations of molecules (or part thereof) can be frozen. This could be directly visualized by scanning tunneling microscopy, i.e., the stabilization could be explained at higher temperatures by the rotational entropy. The direct observation of rotational excitation at single molecule level was achieved recently using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling microscope. The rotational excitation of molecular hydrogen and its isotopes were detected.

<text>New York Theatre Workshop (NYTW) is an Off-Broadway theater noted for its productions of new works. Located at 79 East 4th Street between Second Avenue and Bowery in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, it houses a 198-seat theater for its mainstage productions, and a 75-seat black box theatre for staged readings and developing work in the building next door, at 83 East 4th Street.

==History==
Founded by Stephen Graham, NYTW presents five to seven new productions, over 80 staged readings, and numerous workshop productions to an audience of over 60,000 patrons.

Some of the theatre&#x27;s progeny – such as &quot;Rent&quot; and &quot;Dirty Blonde&quot; – have transferred to commercial productions. The new works of well-established playwrights, such as Caryl Churchill, Doug Wright, and Tony Kushner – a former NYTW associate artistic director – have also been produced at NYTW. In keeping with its mission, NYTW continues to bring new work from theatre legends and emerging artists alike. The theatre maintains connections with many theatrical artists, whom it refers to as &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.

In 2005, NYTW purchased a vacant building at 72 East 4th Street, which it converted into scenic and costume shops. On January 11, 2006, Mayor Michael Bloomberg donated several city-owned buildings to arts organizations, including New York Theatre Workshop, on East Fourth Street, designating the block Fourth Arts Block.

James C. Nicola served as its artistic director from 1988 to June 2022. He was succeeded by Patricia McGregor in August 2022.

<text>Pharmacovigilance (PV, or PhV), also known as drug safety, is the pharmaceutical science relating to the &quot;collection, detection, assessment, monitoring, and prevention&quot; of adverse effects with pharmaceutical products.

The etymological roots for the word &quot;pharmacovigilance&quot; are: (Greek for drug) and (Latin for to keep watch). As such, pharmacovigilance heavily focuses on adverse drug reactions (ADR), which are defined as any response to a drug which is noxious and unintended. That definition includes lack of efficacy: that means that the doses normally used for prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease—or, especially in the case of device, for the modification of physiological disorder function. In 2010, the European Union expanded PV to include medication errors such as overdose, misuse, and abuse of a drug as well as drug exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding. These are monitored even in the absence of an adverse event, because they may result in an adverse drug reaction. The US FDA has long considered such criteria to conform to reportable and collectible PV standards.

Patient and healthcare provider reports (via pharmacovigilance agreements or national mandated reporting laws), as well as other sources such as cases reported in medical literature, play a critical role in providing the data necessary for pharmacovigilance to take place. In order to market or to test a pharmaceutical product in most countries, adverse event data received by the license holder (usually a pharmaceutical company) must be submitted to the national drug regulatory authority. (&quot;See Adverse event reporting below.)&quot;

Ultimately, pharmacovigilance is concerned with identifying the hazards associated with pharmaceutical products and with minimizing the risk of any harm that may come to patients. Companies must conduct a comprehensive drug safety and pharmacovigilance audit to assess their compliance with local, regional, national, or international laws and regulations. This includes ongoing collection of safety data after a product is approved for marketing.

==Terms commonly used in drug safety==
Pharmacovigilance uses unique terminology. Below are most of the terms used within this article. They are particular to drug safety, although some are used by other disciplines within the pharmaceutical sciences as well.

The European Medicines Agency defines terms in its Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP):
* &quot;Adverse drug reaction&quot; is effects arising when drug given even in therapeutic dose either immunologically mediated reaction or pharmacologically mediated adverse response or idiosyncratic reaction due to the peculiarities of individual.
* &quot;Adverse event (AE)&quot; is a side effect occurring with a drug. By definition, the causal relationship between the AE and the drug is unknown. An investigator must establish causality and severity and then report it, especially during clinical trials (not necessarily after marketing is approved).
* &quot;Benefits&quot; are the therapeutic good (positive outcome) of a medicine or device, and benefits also include the patient&#x27;s subjective response.
* &quot;Causal relationship&quot; is said to exist when a drug causes or contributes to the occurrence of an adverse drug reaction.

* &quot;Clinical trial&quot; (or study) refers to an organised program to determine the safety and/or efficacy of a drug (or drugs) in patients. The design of a clinical trial will depend on the drug and the phase of its development. Some clinical trials are conducted after a device or drug is approved to follow for safety.
* &quot;Control group&quot; is a group (or cohort) of individual patients that is used as a standard of comparison within a clinical trial. The control group may be taking a placebo (where no active drug is given) or may be given the standard treatment (“standard of care therapy”) as the comparator.

* &quot;Dechallenge&quot; and &quot;rechallenge&quot; refer to a drug being stopped and restarted in a patient, respectively. A positive dechallenge has occurred, for example, when an adverse event abates or resolves completely following the drug&#x27;s discontinuation. A positive rechallenge has occurred when the adverse event re-occurs after the drug is restarted. Dechallenge and rechallenge play an important role in determining whether a causal relationship between an event and a drug exists.
* &quot;Effectiveness&quot; is the extent to which a drug works under real world circumstances, i.e., clinical practice.

* &quot;Efficacy&quot; is the extent to which a drug works under ideal circumstances, i.e., in clinical trials.
* &quot;Event&quot; refers to an adverse event.

* &quot;Harm&quot; is the nature and extent of the actual damage that could be or has been caused.
* &quot;Implied causality&quot; refers to spontaneously reported AE cases where the causality is always presumed to be positive unless the reporter states otherwise. 

* &quot;Individual Case Safety Report&quot; is an adverse event report for an individual patient.
* &quot;Life-threatening&quot; refers to an adverse event that places a patient at the &quot;immediate&quot; risk of death.
* &quot;Phase&quot; refers to the four phases of clinical research and development: I – small safety trials early on in a drug&#x27;s development; II – medium-sized trials for both safety and efficacy; III – large trials, which includes key (or so-called &quot;pivotal&quot;) trials; IV – large, post-marketing trials, typically for safety reasons. There are also intermediate phases designated by an &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;, e.g. Phase IIb.

* &quot;Risk&quot; is the probability of harm being caused, usually expressed as a percent or ratio of the treated population.

* &quot;Risk factor&quot; is an attribute of a patient that may predispose, or increase the risk, of that patient developing an event that may or may not be drug-related. For instance, obesity is considered a risk factor for a number of different diseases and, potentially, adverse drug reactions. Others would be high blood pressure, diabetes, possessing a specific mutated gene, for example, mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase propensity to develop breast cancer.

* &quot;Signal&quot; is a new safety finding within safety data that requires further investigation. There are three categories of signals: &quot;confirmed signals&quot; where the data indicate that there is a causal relationship between the drug and the AE; &quot;refuted&quot; (or false) signals where after investigation the data indicate that no causal relationship exists; and &quot;unconfirmed&quot; signals which require further investigation (more data) such as the conducting of a post-marketing trial to study the issue.
* &quot;Temporal relationship&quot; is said to exist when an adverse event occurs when a patient is taking a given drug. Although a temporal relationship is absolutely necessary in order to establish a causal relationship between the drug and the AE, a temporal relationship does not necessarily in and of itself prove that the event was caused by the drug.
* &quot;Triage&quot; refers to the process of placing a potential adverse event report into one of three categories: 1) non-serious case; 2) serious case; or 3) no case (minimum criteria for an AE case are not fulfilled).

==Adverse event reporting==
The activity that is most commonly associated with pharmacovigilance (PV), and which consumes a significant number of resources for drug regulatory authorities (or similar government agencies) and drug safety departments in pharmaceutical companies, is that of adverse event reporting. Adverse event (AE) reporting involves the receipt, triage, data entry, assessment, distribution, reporting (if appropriate), and archiving of AE data and documentation. The source of AE reports may include: spontaneous reports from healthcare professionals or patients (or other intermediaries); solicited reports from patient support programs; reports from clinical or post-marketing studies; reports from literature sources; reports from the media (including social media and websites); and reports reported to drug regulatory authorities themselves. For pharmaceutical companies, AE reporting is a regulatory requirement in most countries. AE reporting also provides data to these companies and drug regulatory authorities that play a key role in assessing the risk-benefit profile of a given drug. The following are several facets of AE reporting:

===Individual Case Safety Report===
One of the fundamental principles of adverse event reporting is the determination of what constitutes an individual case safety report. During the triage phase of a potential adverse event report, it is important to determine if the &quot;four elements&quot; of a valid individual case safety report are present: (1) an identifiable patient, (2) an identifiable reporter, (3) a suspect drug, and (4) an adverse event.

If one or more of these four elements is missing, the case is not a valid individual case safety report. Although there are no exceptions to this rule there may be circumstances that may require a judgment call. For example, the term &quot;identifiable&quot; may not always be clear-cut. If a physician reports that he/she has a patient X taking drug Y who experienced Z (an AE), but refuses to provide any specifics about patient X, the report is still a valid case even though the patient is not specifically identified. This is because the reporter has first-hand information about the patient and is &quot;identifiable&quot; (i.e. a real person) to the physician. Identifiability is important so as not only to prevent duplicate reporting of the same case, but also to permit follow-up for additional information.

The concept of identifiability also applies to the other three elements. Although uncommon, it is not unheard of for fictitious adverse event &quot;cases&quot; to be reported to a company by an anonymous individual (or on behalf of an anonymous patient, disgruntled employee, or former employee) trying to damage the company&#x27;s reputation or a company&#x27;s product. In these and all other situations, the source of the report should be ascertained (if possible). But anonymous reporting is also important, as whistle blower protection is not granted in all countries. In general, the drug must also be specifically named. Note that in different countries and regions of the world, drugs are sold under various tradenames. In addition, there are a large number of generics which may be mistaken for the trade product. Finally, there is the problem of counterfeit drugs producing adverse events. If at all possible, it is best to try to obtain the sample which induced the adverse event, and send it to either the European Medicines Agency, FDA or other government agency responsible for investigating AE reports.

If a reporter can&#x27;t recall the name of the drug they were taking when they experienced an adverse event, this would not be a valid case. This concept also applies to adverse events. If a patient states that they experienced &quot;symptoms&quot;, but cannot be more specific, such a report might technically be considered valid, but will be of very limited value to the pharmacovigilance department of the company or to drug regulatory authorities.

===Activities involved in pharmacovigilance===
1- Case-control study (&quot;Retrospective study&quot;)
2- Prospective study (&quot;Cohort study&quot;).
3- Population statistics. and
4- Intensive event report.
5- The spontaneous report in the case is the population of the single case report.

===Coding of adverse events===
Adverse event coding is the process by which information from an AE reporter, called the &quot;verbatim&quot;, is coded using standardized terminology from a medical coding dictionary, such as MedDRA (the most commonly used medical coding dictionary). The purpose of medical coding is to convert adverse event information into terminology that can be readily identified and analyzed. For instance, Patient 1 may report that they had experienced &quot;a very bad headache that felt like their head was being hit by a hammer&quot; [Verbatim 1] when taking Drug X. Or, Patient 2 may report that they had experienced a &quot;slight, throbbing headache that occurred daily at about two in the afternoon&quot; [Verbatim 2] while taking Drug Y. Neither Verbatim 1 nor Verbatim 2 will exactly match a code in the MedDRA coding dictionary. However, both quotes describe different manifestations of a headache. As a result, in this example both quotes would be coded as PT Headache (PT = Preferred Term in MedDRA).

===Seriousness determination===
Although somewhat intuitive, there are a set of criteria within pharmacovigilance that are used to distinguish a serious adverse event from a non-serious one. An adverse event is considered serious if it meets one or more of the following criteria:
# results in death, or is life-threatening;
# requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
# results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
# results in a congenital anomaly (birth defect); or
# is otherwise &quot;medically significant&quot; (i.e., that it does not meet preceding criteria, but is considered serious because treatment/intervention would be required to prevent one of the preceding criteria.)

Aside from death, each of these categories is subject to some interpretation. Life-threatening, as it used in the drug safety world, specifically refers to an adverse event that places the patient at an &quot;immediate risk of death&quot;, such as cardiac or respiratory arrest. By this definition, events such as myocardial infarction, which would be hypothetically life-threatening, would not be considered life-threatening unless the patient went into cardiac arrest following the MI. Defining what constitutes hospitalization can be problematic as well. Although typically straightforward, it&#x27;s possible for a hospitalization to occur even if the events being treated are not serious. By the same token, serious events may be treated without hospitalization, such as the treatment of anaphylaxis may be successfully performed with epinephrine. Significant disability and incapacity, as a concept, is also subject to debate. While permanent disability following a stroke would no doubt be serious, would &quot;complete blindness for 30 seconds&quot; be considered &quot;significant disability&quot;? For birth defects, the seriousness of the event is usually not in dispute so much as the attribution of the event to the drug. Finally, &quot;medically significant events&quot; is a category that includes events that may be always serious, or sometimes serious, but will not fulfill any of the other criteria. Events such as cancer might always be considered serious, whereas liver disease, depending on its Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade—Grades 1 or 2 are generally considered non-serious and Grades 3-5 may be considered serious.

===Expedited reporting===
This refers to individual case safety reports that involve a serious and unlisted event (an event not described in the drug&#x27;s labeling) that is considered related to the use of the drug (US FDA). (Spontaneous reports are typically considered to have a positive causality, whereas a clinical trial case will typically be assessed for causality by the clinical trial investigator and/or the license holder.) In most countries, the time frame for reporting expedited cases is 7/15 calendar days from the time a drug company receives notification (referred to as &quot;Day 0&quot;) of such a case. Within clinical trials such a case is referred to as a SUSAR (a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction). If the SUSAR involves an event that is life-threatening or fatal, it may be subject to a 7-day &quot;clock&quot;. Cases that do not involve a serious, unlisted event may be subject to non-expedited or periodic reporting.

===Clinical trial reporting===
Also known as AE (adverse event) or SAE (serious AE) reporting from clinical trials, safety information from clinical studies is used to establish a drug&#x27;s safety profile in humans and is a key component that drug regulatory authorities consider in the decision-making as to whether to grant or deny market authorization (market approval) for a drug. AE reporting occurs when study patients (subjects, participants) experience any kind of &quot;untoward&quot; event during the conducting of clinical trials. Non-serious adverse events are typically captured separately at a level lower than pharmacovigilance. AE and SAE information, which may also include relevant information from the patient&#x27;s medical background, are reviewed and assessed for both causality and degree of seriousness by the study investigator. This information is forwarded to a sponsoring entity (typically a pharmaceutical company or academic medical center) that is responsible for the reporting of this information, as appropriate, to drug regulatory authorities.

===Spontaneous reporting===
Spontaneous reports are termed spontaneous as they take place during the clinician&#x27;s normal diagnostic appraisal of a patient, when the clinician is drawing the conclusion that the drug may be implicated in the causality of the event.

Spontaneous reporting system (SRS) relies on vigilant physicians and other healthcare professionals who not only generate a suspicion of an adverse drug reaction, but also report it. It is an important source of regulatory actions such as taking a drug off the market or a label change due to safety problems. Spontaneous reporting is the core data-generating system of international pharmacovigilance, relying on healthcare professionals (and in some countries consumers) to identify and report any adverse events to their national pharmacovigilance center, health authority (such as the European Medicines Agency or FDA), or to the drug manufacturer itself. Spontaneous reports are, by definition, submitted voluntarily although under certain circumstances these reports may be encouraged, or &quot;stimulated&quot;, by media reports or articles published in medical or scientific publications, or by product lawsuits. In many parts of the world adverse event reports are submitted electronically using a defined message standard.

One of the major weaknesses of spontaneous reporting is that of under-reporting, where, unlike in clinical trials, less than 100% of those adverse events occurring are reported. Further complicating the assessment of adverse events, AE reporting behavior varies greatly between countries and in relation to the seriousness of the events, but in general probably less than 10% (some studies suggest less than 5%) of all adverse events that occur are actually reported. The rule-of-thumb is that on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being least likely to be reported and 10 being the most likely to be reported, an uncomplicated non-serious event such as a mild headache will be closer to a &quot;0&quot; on this scale, whereas a life-threatening or fatal event will be closer to a &quot;10&quot; in terms of its likelihood of being reported. In view of this, medical personnel may not always see AE reporting as a priority, especially if the symptoms are not serious. And even if the symptoms are serious, the symptoms may not be recognized as a possible side effect of a particular drug or combination thereof. In addition, medical personnel may not feel compelled to report events that are viewed as expected. This is why reports from patients themselves are of high value. The confirmation of these events by a healthcare professional is typically considered to increase the value of these reports. Hence it is important not only for the patient to report the AE to his health care provider (who may neglect to report the AE), but also report the AE to both the biopharmaceutical company and the FDA, European Medicines Agency, ... This is especially important when one has obtained one&#x27;s pharmaceutical from a compounding pharmacy.

As such, spontaneous reports are a crucial element in the worldwide enterprise of pharmacovigilance and form the core of the World Health Organization Database, which includes around 4.6 million reports (January 2009), growing annually by about 250,000.

===Aggregate reporting===
Aggregate reporting, also known as periodic reporting, plays a key role in the safety assessment of drugs. Aggregate reporting involves the compilation of safety data for a drug over a prolonged period of time (months or years), as opposed to single-case reporting which, by definition, involves only individual AE reports. The advantage of aggregate reporting is that it provides a broader view of the safety profile of a drug. Worldwide, the most important aggregate report is the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) and Development Safety Update Report (DSUR). This is a document that is submitted to drug regulatory agencies in Europe, the US and Japan (ICH countries), as well as other countries around the world. The PSUR was updated in 2012 and is now referred to in many countries as the Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation report (PBRER). As the title suggests, the PBRER&#x27;s focus is on the benefit-risk profile of the drug, which includes a review of relevant safety data compiled for a drug product since its development.

===Other reporting methods===
Some countries legally oblige spontaneous reporting by physicians. In most countries, manufacturers are required to submit, through its Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance (QPPV), all of the reports they receive from healthcare providers to the national authority. Others have intensive, focused programmes concentrating on new drugs, or on controversial drugs, or on the prescribing habits of groups of doctors, or involving pharmacists in reporting. All of these generate potentially useful information. Such intensive schemes, however, tend to be the exception. A number of countries have reporting requirements or reporting systems specific to vaccine-related events.

==Risk management==
Risk management is the discipline within pharmacovigilance that is responsible for signal detection and the monitoring of the risk-benefit profile of drugs. Other key activities within the area of risk management are that of the compilation of risk management plans (RMPs) and aggregate reports such as the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR), Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER), and the Development Safety Update Report (DSUR).

===Causality assessment===
One of the most important, and challenging, problems in pharmacovigilance is that of the determination of causality. Causality refers to the relationship of a given adverse event to a specific drug. Causality determination (or assessment) is often difficult because of the lack of clear-cut or reliable data. While one may assume that a positive temporal relationship might &quot;prove&quot; a positive causal relationship, this is not always the case. Indeed, a &quot;bee sting&quot; Adverse Event — where the AE can clearly be attributed to a specific cause — is by far the exception rather than the rule. This is due to the complexity of human physiology as well as that of disease and illnesses. By this reckoning, in order to determine causality between an adverse event and a drug, one must first exclude the possibility that there were other possible causes or contributing factors. If the patient is on a number of medications, it may be the combination of these drugs which causes the AE, and not any one individually. There have been a number of recent high-profile cases where the AE led to the death of an individual. The individuals were not overdosed with any one of the many medications they were taking, but the combination there appeared to cause the AE. Hence it is important to include in your/one&#x27;s AE report, not only the drug being reported, but also all other drugs the patient was also taking.

For instance, if a patient were to start Drug X and then three days later were to develop an AE, one might be tempted to attribute blame Drug X. However, before that can be done, the patient&#x27;s medical history would need to be reviewed to look for possible risk factors for the AE. In other words, did the AE occur with the drug or &quot;because&quot; of the drug? This is because a patient on any drug may develop or be diagnosed with a condition that could not have possibly been caused by the drug. This is especially true for diseases, such as cancer, which develop over an extended period of time, being diagnosed in a patient who has been taken a drug for a relatively short period of time. On the other hand, certain adverse events, such as blood clots (thrombosis), can occur with certain drugs with only short-term exposure. Nevertheless, the determination of risk factors is an important step of confirming or ruling-out a causal relationship between an event and a drug.

Often the only way to confirm the existence of a causal relationship of an event to a drug is to conduct an observational study where the incidence of the event in a patient population taking the drug is compared to a control group. This may be necessary to determine if the background incidence of an event is less than that found in a group taking a drug. If the incidence of an event is statistically significantly higher in the &quot;active&quot; group versus the placebo group (or other control group), it is possible that a causal relationship may exist to a drug, unless other confounding factors may exist.

===Signal detection===
Signal detection involves a range of techniques (CIOMS VIII). The WHO defines a safety signal as: &quot;Reported information on a possible causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug, the relationship being unknown or incompletely documented previously&quot;. Usually more than a single report is required to generate a signal, depending upon the event and quality of the information available.

Data mining pharmacovigilance databases is one approach that has become increasingly popular with the availability of extensive data sources and inexpensive computing resources. The data sources (databases) may be owned by a pharmaceutical company, a drug regulatory authority, or a large healthcare provider. Individual case safety reports in these databases are retrieved and converted into structured format, and statistical methods (usually a smathematical algorithm) are applied to calculate statistical measures of association. If the statistical measure crosses an arbitrarily set threshold, a signal is declared for a given drug associated with a given adverse event. All signals deemed worthy of investigation, require further analysis using all available data in an attempt to confirm or refute the signal. If the analysis is inconclusive, additional data may be needed such as a post-marketing observational trial.

Signal detection is an essential part of drug use and safety surveillance. Ideally, the goal of signal detection is to identify adverse drug reactions that were previously considered unexpected and to be able to provide guidance in the product&#x27;s labeling as to how to minimize the risk of using the drug in a given patient population.

===Risk management plans===
A risk management plan is a documented plan that describes the risks (adverse drug reactions and potential adverse reactions) associated with the use of a drug and how they are being handled (warning on drug label or on packet inserts of possible side effects which if observed should cause the patient to inform/see his physician and/or pharmacist and/or the manufacturer of the drug and/or the FDA, European Medicines Agency. The overall goal of a risk management plan is to assure a positive risk-benefit profile once the drug is (has been) marketed. The document is required to be submitted, in a specified format, with all new market authorization requests within the European Union (EU). Although not necessarily required, risk management plans may also be submitted in countries outside the EU. The risks described in a risk management plan fall into one of three categories: identified risks, potential risks, and unknown risks. Also described within a risk management plan are the measures that the Market Authorization Holder, usually a pharmaceutical company, will undertake to minimize the risks associated with the use of the drug. These measures are usually focused on the product&#x27;s labeling and healthcare professionals. Indeed, the risks that are documented in a pre-authorization risk management plan will inevitably become part of the product&#x27;s post-marketing labeling. Since a drug, once authorized, may be used in ways not originally studied in clinical trials, this potential &quot;off-label use&quot;, and its associated risks, is also described within the risk management plan. Risk management plans can be very lengthy documents, running in some cases hundreds of pages and, in rare instances, up to a thousand pages long.

In the US, under certain circumstances, the FDA may require a company to submit a document called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for a drug that has a specific risk that FDA believes requires mitigation. While not as comprehensive as a risk management plan, a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy can require a sponsor to perform certain activities or to follow a protocol, referred to as Elements to Assure Safe Use, to assure that a positive risk-benefit profile for the drug is maintained for the circumstances under which the product is marketed.

===Risk/benefit profile of drugs===
Pharmaceutical companies are required by law in most countries to perform clinical trials, testing new drugs on people before they are made generally available. This occurs after a drug has been pre-screened for toxicity, sometimes using animals for testing. The manufacturers or their agents usually select a representative sample of patients for whom the drug is designed – at most a few thousand – along with a comparable control group. The control group may receive a placebo and/or another drug, often a so-called &quot;gold standard&quot; that is &quot;best&quot; drug marketed for the disease.

The purpose of clinical trials is to determine:
* if a drug works and how well it works
* if it has any harmful effects, and
* if it does more good than harm, and how much more? If it has a potential for harm, how probable and how serious is the harm?

Clinical trials do, in general, tell a good deal about how well a drug works. They provide information that should be reliable for larger populations with the same characteristics as the trial group – age, gender, state of health, ethnic origin, and so on though target clinical populations are typically very different from trial populations with respect to such characteristics.

The variables in a clinical trial are specified and controlled, but a clinical trial can never tell you the whole story of the effects of a drug in all situations. In fact, nothing could tell you the whole story, but a clinical trial must tell you enough; &quot;enough&quot; being determined by legislation and by contemporary judgements about the acceptable balance of benefit and harm. Ultimately, when a drug is marketed it may be used in patient populations that were not studied during clinical trials (children, the elderly, pregnant women, patients with co-morbidities not found in the clinical trial population, etc.) and a different set of warnings, precautions or contraindications (where the drug should not be used at all) for the product&#x27;s labeling may be necessary in order to maintain a positive risk/benefit profile in all known populations using the drug.

===Pharmacoepidemiology===
Pharmacoepidemiology is the study of the incidence of adverse drug reactions in patient populations using drug agents.

===Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics===
Although often used interchangeably, there are subtle differences between the two disciplines. Pharmacogenetics is generally regarded as the study or clinical testing of genetic variation that gives rise to differing responses to drugs, including adverse drug reactions. It is hoped that pharmacogenetics will eventually provide information as to which genetic profiles in patients will place those patients at greatest risk, or provide the greatest benefit, for using a particular drug or drugs. Pharmacogenomics, on the other hand, is the broader application of genomic technologies to new drug discovery and further characterization of older drugs.

==International collaboration==
The following organizations play a key collaborative role in the global oversight of pharmacovigilance.

===The World Health Organization (WHO)===
The principle of international collaboration in the field of pharmacovigilance is the basis for the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring, through which over 150 member nations have systems in place that encourage healthcare personnel to record and report adverse effects of drugs in their patients. These reports are assessed locally and may lead to action within the country. Since 1978, the programme has been managed by the Uppsala Monitoring Centre to which member countries send their reports to be processed, evaluated and entered into an international database called VigiBase. Membership in the WHO Programme enables a country to know if similar reports are being made elsewhere. When there are several reports of adverse reactions to a particular drug, this process may lead to the detection of a signal, and an alert about a possible hazard communicated to members countries after detailed evaluation and expert review on the biological stasis and homeostasis of the body.

===The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)===
The International Council for Harmonisation is a global organization with members from the European Union, the United States and Japan; its goal is to recommend global standards for drug companies and drug regulatory authorities around the world, with its activities overseen by the Steering Committee overseeing harmonization activities. Established in 1990, each of its six co-sponsors—the EU, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)—have two seats on the SC. Other parties have a significant interest in the International Council for Harmonisation and have been invited to nominate Observers to the SC; three current observers are the WHO, Health Canada, and the European Free Trade Association, with the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association participating as a non-voting member of the SC.

===The Council for International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS)===
The CIOMS, a part of the WHO, is globally oriented think tank that provides guidance on drug safety related topics through its Working Groups. The CIOMS prepares reports that are used as a reference for developing future drug regulatory policy and procedures, and over the years, many of CIOMS&#x27; proposed policies have been adopted. Examples of topics these reports have covered include: Current Challenges in Pharmacovigilance: Pragmatic Approaches (CIOMS V); Management of Safety Information from Clinical Trials (CIOMS VI); the Development Safety Update Report (DSUR): Harmonizing the Format and Content for Periodic Safety Reporting During Clinical Trials (CIOMS VII); and Practical Aspects of Signal Detection in Pharmacovigilance: Report of CIOMS Working Group (CIOMS VIII).

===The International Society of Pharmacovigilance===
The International Society of Pharmacovigilance is an international non-profit scientific organization, which aims to foster pharmacovigilance both scientifically and educationally, and enhance all aspects of the safe and proper use of medicines, in all countries. It was established in 1992 as the European Society of Pharmacovigilance.

Society of Pharmacovigilance, India, also established in 1992, is partner member of the International Society of Pharmacovigilance. Other local societies include the Boston Society of Pharmacovigilance Physicians.

==Regulatory authorities==
Drug regulatory authorities play a key role in national or regional oversight of pharmacovigilance. Some of the agencies involved are listed below (in order of 2011 spending on pharmaceuticals, from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics).

===United States===

In the U.S., with about a third of all global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures, the drug industry is regulated by the FDA, the largest national drug regulatory authority in the world. FDA authority is exercised through enforcement of regulations derived from legislation, as published in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); the principal drug safety regulations are found in 21 CFR Part 312 (IND regulations) and 21 CFR Part 314 (NDA regulations). While those regulatory efforts address pre-marketing concerns, pharmaceutical manufacturers and academic/non-profit organizations such as RADAR and Public Citizen do play a role in pharmacovigilance in the US. The post-legislative rule-making process of the U.S. federal government provides for significant input from both the legislative and executive branches, which also play specific, distinct roles in determining FDA policy.

===Emerging economies (including Latin America)===
The &quot;pharmerging&quot;, or emerging pharmaceutical market economies, which include Brazil, India, Russia, Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Vietnam, accrued one fifth of global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures; in future, aggregated data for this set will include China as well.

China&#x27;s economy is anticipated to pass Japan to become second in the ranking of individual countries&#x27; in pharmaceutical purchases by 2015, and so its PV regulation will become increasing important; China&#x27;s regulation of PV is through its National Center for Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring, under China&#x27;s Ministry of Health.

As JE Sackman notes, as of April 2013 &quot;there is no Latin American equivalent of the European Medicines Agency—no common body with the power to facilitate greater consistency across countries&quot;. For simplicity, and per sources, 17 smaller economies are discussed alongside the 4 pharmemerging large economies of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela—Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Uruguay. As of June 2012, 16 of this total of 21 countries have systems for immediate reporting and 9 have systems for periodic reporting of adverse events for on-market agents, while 10 and 8, respectively, have systems for immediate and periodic reporting of adverse events during clinical trials; most of these have PV requirements that rank as &quot;high or medium...in line with international standards&quot; (&quot;ibid.&quot;). The WHO&#x27;s Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization seeks to assist Latin American countries in develop harmonized PV regulations.

Some further PV regulatory examples from the pharmerging nations are as follows. In India, the PV regulatory authority is the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission, with a National Coordination Centre under the Pharmacovigilance Program of India, in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Scientists working on pharmacovigilance share their experiences, findings, innovative ideas and researches during the annual meeting of Society of Pharmacovigilance, India. In Egypt, PV is regulated by the Egyptian Pharmacovigilance Center of the Egyptian Ministry of Health.

===European Union===

The EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom) accrued ~17% of global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures. PV efforts in the EU are coordinated by the European Medicines Agency and are conducted by the national competent authorities (NCAs). The main responsibility of the European Medicines Agency is to maintain and develop the pharmacovigilance database consisting of all suspected serious adverse reactions to medicines observed in the European Community; the data processing network and management system is called EudraVigilance and contains separate but similar databases of human and veterinary reactions. The European Medicines Agency requires the individual marketing authorization holders to submit all received adverse reactions in electronic form, except in exceptional circumstances; the reporting obligations of the various stakeholders are defined by EEC legislation, namely Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and for human medicines, European Union Directive 2001/83/EC as amended and Directive 2001/20/EC. In 2002, Heads of Medicines Agencies agreed on a mandate for an ad hoc Working Group on establishing a European risk management strategy; the Working Group considered the conduct of a high level survey of EU pharmacovigilance resources to promote the utilization of expertise and encourage collaborative working.

In conjunction with this oversight, individual countries maintain their distinct regulatory agencies with PV responsibility. For instance, in Spain, PV is regulated by the Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios, which can suspend or withdraw the authorization of pharmaceuticals already on-market if the evidence shows that safety (or quality or efficacy) of an agent are unsatisfactory.

===Rest of Europe, including non-EU===
The remaining EU and non-EU countries outside the EU5 accrued ~7% of global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures. Regulation of those outside the EU being managed by specific governmental agencies. For instance, in Switzerland, PV &quot;inspections&quot; for clinical trials of medicinal products are conducted by the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products.

===Japan===
In Japan, with ~12% of all global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures, PV matters are regulated by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare.

===Canada===
In Canada, with ~2% of all global 2006 and 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures, PV is regulated by the Marketed Health Products Directorate of the Health Products and Food Branch. Canada was second, following the United States, in holding the highest total prescription drug expenditures per capita in 2011 at around 750 US dollars per person. Canada also pays such a large amount for pharmaceuticals that it was second, next to Switzerland, for the amount of money spent for a certain amount of prescription drugs (around 130 US dollars). It was also accessed that Canada was one of the top countries that increased its yearly average per capita growth on pharmaceutical expenditures the most from 2000 to 2010 with 4 percent a year (with taking inflation into account) The Marketed Health Products Directorate mainly collects adverse drug reaction reports through a network of reporting centers to analyze and issue possible warnings to the public, and currently utilizes newsletters, advisories, adverse reaction centers, as well as electronic mailing lists. However, it does not currently maintain a database or list of drugs removed from Canada as a result of safety concerns.

In August 2017, there was a government controversy in which a bill, known as “Vanessa’s Law”, to protect patients from potentially dangerous prescription drugs was not being fully realized by hospitals; Health Canada only required hospitals to report “unexpected” negative reactions to prescription drugs, rather than any and all adverse reactions, with the justification of managing “administrative overload”.[25]

===South Korea===
The Republic of Korea, with ~1% of all global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures, PV matters are regulated in South Korea by the Ministry Of Food And Drug Safety

===Azerbaijan===
The law on pharmacovigilance in Azerbaijan was revised and implemented as part of the &quot;Regulation of Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products&quot; in 2019. This regulation was developed to establish state control over the effectiveness and safety of medicinal products. It outlines measures to detect, evaluate, and prevent adverse reactions and other undesirable effects of medicinal products, applying to marketing authorization holders and all health institutions in Azerbaijan

In Azerbaijan, the Ministry of Health and other relevant state authorities play a crucial role in the functioning of the pharmacovigilance system. These organizations implement various regulatory and oversight mechanisms to ensure drug safety.

Worldwide company Pharmcontrol (https://www.pharmcontrol.com/en ) offers a full range of pharmacovigilance services in Azerbaijan to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medicines on the market. With a team of highly qualified, certified pharmacists, Pharmcontrol ensures the effective monitoring and management of drug safety. The company aligns with international practices and standards, helping to elevate the country&#x27;s drug safety levels. 

The development of pharmacovigilance in Azerbaijan aims to increase public awareness about the safe use of medicines and improve the overall quality of the healthcare system. The integration of international standards and best practices in pharmacovigilance, spearheaded by companies like Pharmcontrol (https://www.pharmcontrol.com/en ), contributes significantly to this goal, ensuring that the safety of patients is always a top priority. 
====Kenya====
In Kenya, PV is regulated by the Pharmacy and Poisons Board.The Pharmacy and Poisons Board provides a Pharmacovigilance Electronic Reporting System which allows for the online reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions as well as suspected poor quality of medicinal products. The Pharmacovigilance activities in Kenya are supported by the School of Pharmacy, University of Nairobi through its Master of Pharmacy in Pharmacoepidemiology &amp; Pharmacovigilance program offered by the Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacognosy.

In Uganda, PV is regulated by the National Drug Authority.

===Rest of world===
The rest of the world accrued ~7% of global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures. Some examples of PV regulatory agencies in the rest of the world are as follows. In Iraq, PV is regulated by the Iraqi Pharmacovigilance Center of the Iraqi Ministry of Health.

In India: Pv is regulated by the PVPI (Pharmacovigilance programme of India)

==Pharmacoenvironmentology (Ecopharmacovigilance)==
Despite attention from the FDA and regulatory agencies of the European Union, procedures for monitoring drug concentrations and adverse effects in the environment are lacking. Pharmaceuticals, their metabolites, and related substances may enter the environment after patient excretion, after direct release to waste streams during manufacturing or administration, or via terrestrial deposits (e.g., from waste sludges or leachates). A concept combining pharmacovigilance and environmental pharmacology, intended to focus attention on this area, was introduced first as &quot;pharmacoenvironmentology&quot; in 2006 by Syed Ziaur Rahman and later as &quot;ecopharmacology&quot; with further concurrent and later terms for the same concept (ecopharmacovigilance, environmental pharmacology, ecopharmacostewardship).

The first of these routes to the environment, elimination through living organisms subsequent to pharmacotherapy, is suggested as the principal source of environmental contamination (apart from cases where norms for treatment of manufacturing and other wastes are violated), and ecopharmacovigilance is intended to deal specifically with this impact of pharmacological agents on the environment.

Activities of ecopharmacovigilance have been suggested to include:
* Increasing, generally, the availability of environmental data on medicinal products;
* Tracking emerging data on environmental exposure, effects and risks after product launch;
* Using environmental risk management plans to manage risk throughout a drug&#x27;s life cycle;
* Following risk identification, promoting further research and environmental monitoring, and
* In general, promoting a global perspective on ecopharmacovigilance issues.

==Related to medical devices==
A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implant, &quot;in vitro&quot; reagent, or similar or related article that is used to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease or other conditions, and does not achieve its purposes through chemical action within or on the body (which would make it a drug). Whereas medicinal products (also called pharmaceuticals) achieve their principal action by pharmacological, metabolic or immunological means, medical devices act by physical, mechanical, or thermal means. Medical devices vary greatly in complexity and application. Examples range from simple devices such as tongue depressors, medical thermometers, and disposable gloves to advanced devices such as medical robots, cardiac pacemakers, and neuroprosthetics. This modern concept of monitoring and safety of medical devices which is known materiovigilance was quite documented in Unani System of medicine.

Given the inherent difference between medicinal products and medical products, the vigilance of medical devices is also different from that of medicinal products. To reflect this difference, a classification system has been adopted in some countries to stratify the risk of failure with the different classes of devices. The classes of devices typically run on a 1-3 or 1-4 scale, with Class 1 being the least likely to cause significant harm with device failure versus Classes 3 or 4 being the most likely to cause significant harm with device failure. An example of a device in the &quot;low risk&quot; category would be contact lenses. An example of a device in the &quot;high risk&quot; category would be cardiac pacemakers.

Medical device reporting (MDR), which is the reporting of adverse events with medical devices, is similar to that with medicinal products, although there are differences. In contrast to reporting of medical products reports of side-effects play only a minor role with most medical devices. The vast majority of the medical device reports are related to medical device defects or failures. Other notable differences are in the obligations to report by other actors that aren&#x27;t manufacturers, in the US user-facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes are legally required to report suspected medical device-related deaths to both FDA and the manufacturer, if known, and serious injuries to the manufacturer or to FDA, if the manufacturer is unknown. This is in contrast to the voluntary reporting of AEs with medicinal products. Similar obligations exist in multiple European countries. The European regulation on medical devices and the European regulation on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR) obliges other economic operators most notably importers and distributors to inform manufacturers, and in certain instances the authorities, of incidents and safety issues with medical devices that they have distributed or imported in the European market.

==For herbal medicines==

The safety of herbal medicines has become a major concern to both national health authorities and the general public. The use of herbs as traditional medicines continues to expand rapidly across the world; many people now take herbal medicines or herbal products for their health care in different national health-care settings. However, mass media reports of adverse events with herbal medicines can be incomplete and therefore misleading. Moreover, it can be difficult to identify the causes of herbal medicine-associated adverse events since the amount of data on each event is generally less than for pharmaceuticals formally regulated as drugs (since the requirements for adverse event reporting are either non-existent or are less stringent for herbal supplements and medications).

== Novel sources ==
With the emergence of advanced artificial intelligence methods and social media big data, researchers are now using publicly posted social media data to discover unknown side effects of prescription medications. Natural language processing and machine learning methods are developed and used for identifying non-standard expressions of side effects.

<text>The exact sciences or quantitative sciences, sometimes called the exact mathematical sciences, are those sciences &quot;which admit of absolute precision in their results&quot;; especially the mathematical sciences. Examples of the exact sciences are mathematics, optics, astronomy, and physics, which many philosophers from Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant to the logical positivists took as paradigms of rational and objective knowledge. These sciences have been practiced in many cultures from antiquity to modern times. Given their ties to mathematics, the exact sciences are characterized by accurate quantitative expression, precise predictions and/or rigorous methods of testing hypotheses involving quantifiable predictions and measurements.

The distinction between the quantitative exact sciences and those sciences that deal with the causes of things is due to Aristotle, who distinguished mathematics from natural philosophy and considered the exact sciences to be the &quot;more natural of the branches of mathematics.&quot; Thomas Aquinas employed this distinction when he said that astronomy explains the spherical shape of the Earth by mathematical reasoning while physics explains it by material causes. This distinction was widely, but not universally, accepted until the scientific revolution of the 17th century. Edward Grant has proposed that a fundamental change leading to the new sciences was the unification of the exact sciences and physics by Kepler, Newton, and others, which resulted in a quantitative investigation of the physical causes of natural phenomena.

Linguistics and comparative philology have also been considered exact sciences, most notably by Benjamin Whorf.

<doc id="1243558" wikidata="Q2119869" url="?curid=1243558" title="Targe">
<text>The targe (from Old Franconian &#x27; &#x27;shield&#x27;, [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]]&#x27; &#x27;border&#x27;) is a type of shield that was used by Scottish Highlanders in the early modern period. From the late 16th century, until the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the Scottish Highlander&#x27;s main means of defence in battle was his targe. In February 1596, the clan leader John Grant of Freuchie was able to muster 500 men, including 40 armed &quot;according to the Highland custom&quot; with bows, helmets, swords, and targes. After the disastrous defeat of the Jacobites at Culloden, the carrying of the targe had been banned by the Disarming Act, and many were destroyed or put to other uses. Those that remain have intricate patterns and are decorated, indicating that they would have originally belonged to important people.

The targe is a concave shield fitted with enarmes on the inside, one adjustable by a buckle, to be attached to the forearm, and the other fixed as a grip for the left hand.

==Etymology==
Targe (from Old Franconian &#x27; &#x27;shield&#x27;, Proto-Germanic &#x27; &#x27;border&#x27;) was a general word for shield in late Old English. Its diminutive, &quot;target&quot;, came to mean an object to be aimed at in the 18th century.

The term refers to various types of shields used by infantry troops from the 13th to 16th centuries, or earlier. From the 15th century, the term could also refer to special shields used for jousting. A fair number were created wholly for show.

== Structure of the Scottish targe ==

Targes are generally round shields between 18 in and 21 in (45–55 cm) in diameter. The inside of the targe was formed from two very thin layers of flat wooden boards, with the grain of each layer at right angles to the other. They were fixed together with small wooden pegs, forming plywood. The front was covered with a tough cowhide, which was often decorated with embossed Celtic style patterns. This was fixed to the wood with many brass, or in some cases, silver, nails, and occasionally brass plates were also fixed to the face for strength and decoration. Targes generally had center bosses of brass. A Highlander was usually armed with a broadsword or dagger in one hand and targe on his other arm for close combat. It was also common for a dirk to be held in the targe hand, with the blade extending below the targe.

The back of the targe was commonly covered in deerskin, and a very few had some packing of straw etc. behind this. Although all the old targes show signs of handles and arm straps, of various designs including centre-grips, there is very little evidence to indicate that there was any guige strap for carrying the targe over the shoulder.

<text>The Charlottetown Islanders are a Canadian junior ice hockey team in the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) based in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. They are members of the Maritimes Division, and play their home games at the Eastlink Centre.

==History==
Originally located in Montreal, and called the Montreal Rocket, the team relocated to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in 2003. They were named after Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard of the Montreal Canadiens, and their team crest depicted his number, 9.

In their first season on PEI, the Rocket won 40 regular season games and made it to the second round of the playoffs, where they lost in six games to the Moncton Wildcats led by future NHL star goaltender Corey Crawford.

Beginning in the 2013–14 season, the Rocket rebranded as the Charlottetown Islanders.

President and governor Serge Savard Jr. confirmed on April 17, 2013, that the QMJHL had contacted the Rocket two days earlier with a proposal to buy the struggling franchise. Savard said he intended to accept the offer, somewhere in the area of $3.5 million, unless he was able to find a local buyer or buyers for the team. Savard said league commissioner Gilles Corteau had given him until April 26 to secure a buyer. One interested group intended to relocate the team to Sorel, Quebec.

However, an ownership group led by Geoff Boyle agreed to purchase the team, ensuring its future in Charlottetown for 2013–14 and beyond. The new Islanders logo and colour scheme was unveiled on May 27.

In the 2014–15 season, for the first time since the franchise&#x27;s inaugural season as the PEI Rocket, the Charlottetown Islanders advanced to the second round of the QMJHL playoffs, after defeating the Sherbrooke Phoenix 4–2 in the first round. However, in the second round, they were eliminated by the Quebec Remparts 4–0.

On June 29, 2015, the Islanders hired Jim Hulton as head coach after Gordie Dwyer was relieved of his duties as head coach.

On March 29, 2016, the Islanders set a new QMJHL record for most shots on goal in one period of a playoff game with 32. The previous record was 30, shared by four teams.

On June 4, 2016, the Charlottetown Islanders hosted the 2016 QMJHL Draft, a first for the franchise since 2006 when they were known as the P.E.I. Rocket.

On April 13, 2017, the Islanders advanced to the third round of the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, eliminating the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles four games to none in the second round.

On May 30, 2022, the Islanders won their third round series to make their first-ever appearance in the President&#x27;s Cup Final. This also marked the fourth time in the previous five playoffs that the team reached the third round.

<text>Abner Joseph Mikva (January 21, 1926 – July 4, 2016) was an American politician, federal judge, and legal scholar. He was a member of the Democratic Party. After serving in the Illinois House of Representatives, Mikva ran for congress in 1966 but lost the primary to incumbent congressman Barrett O&#x27;Hara. In 1968, Mikva defeated O&#x27;Hara. Mikva served in the United States House of Representatives representing Illinois&#x27;s 2nd congressional district (1969–1973) and 10th congressional district (1975–1979). He was appointed as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by President Jimmy Carter, serving from 1979 to 1994. He served as the White House Counsel from 1994 to 1995 during Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency. He was one of the few people in modern times to serve in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the Federal government.

In his later career, Mikva taught at the University of Chicago Law School, the Georgetown University Law Center and the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law. He mentored future President of the United States Barack Obama and future United States Attorney General Merrick Garland (who also succeeded him on the D.C. Circuit) during their early years in law. In 2014, Obama honored Mikva with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life and family==

Mikva was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Ida (Fishman) and Henry Abraham Mikva, Jewish immigrants escaping from pogroms in Ukraine. Mikva and his parents spoke Yiddish at home. During the Great Depression, his father was often unemployed and the family relied on welfare. Abner attended local public schools. During World War II, he enlisted and was trained in the United States Army Air Corps, but the war ended the day before he was due to be deployed. Afterward, the GI Bill enabled Mikva to attend the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee before transferring to Washington University in St. Louis, where he met his future wife, Zorita Rose (Zoe) Wise. Both graduated in 1948 and soon married.

The couple moved to Chicago, Illinois, where Zoe had urged Mikva to enroll at the University of Chicago Law School. He graduated in 1951 with a Juris Doctor, having served as editor-in-chief of the &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot;. The couple eventually had three daughters: Mary Lane (b. 1953), an Illinois Appellate Court judge in Chicago; Laurie, who teaches at Northwestern University and is on the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation; and Rachel, a rabbi and professor who teaches at the Chicago Theological Seminary.

==Political career==

After graduation, Mikva clerked for Supreme Court Justice Sherman Minton. He also returned to Chicago and began practicing law, at a firm which became Goldberg, Devoe, Shadur &amp; Mikva after he made partner. The firm handles labor, real estate, commercial and civil rights cases, as well as some criminal defense.

Nonetheless, his early interest in Chicago clearly was politics:
One of the stories that is told about my start in politics is that on the way home from law school one night in 1948, I stopped by the ward headquarters in the ward where I lived. There was a street-front, and the name Timothy O&#x27;Sullivan, Ward Committeeman, was painted on the front window. I walked in and I said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to volunteer to work for [Adlai] Stevenson and [Paul] Douglas.&quot; This quintessential Chicago ward committeeman took the cigar out of his mouth and glared at me and said, &quot;Who sent you?&quot; I said, &quot;Nobody sent me.&quot; He put the cigar back in his mouth and he said, &quot;We don&#x27;t want nobody that nobody sent.&quot; This was the beginning of my political career in Chicago.

He spent ten years, 1956 to 1966, in the Illinois House of Representatives. He was defeated for reelection in 1966, but &quot;reinvented himself&quot; as a community activist, winning election to the United States Congress in 1968. In the Illinois House, Mikva was part of the &quot;Kosher Nostra&quot;, a group of independent, clean Democrats that included future United States Senator and Presidential candidate Paul Simon, future Illinois Comptroller and candidate for Governor Dawn Clark Netsch, and Representative Anthony Scariano. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1969 to 1973 and 1975 to 1979.

He first represented Illinois&#x27;s 2nd District, which included the South Side&#x27;s lakefront wards including Hyde Park, his residence and the University of Chicago. Both parties attempted to redistrict Mikva out of Congress. The redistricting for the 1972 elections put Hyde Park in the 1st District for the first time since 1903. This would have pitted Mikva against Democratic incumbent Ralph Metcalfe in a nearly 90% black district; moving to stay in the 2nd District would have matched him against Democratic incumbent Morgan F. Murphy, who had previously represented the 3rd District. Mikva instead moved to the North Shore&#x27;s 10th District.

After he was defeated by Republican Samuel H. Young in 1972, he ran in the 1974 Democratic wave election and beat Young with 50.9% of the vote; his status was enhanced in the predominantly Republican, suburban district because he was viewed as critical of the Chicago Democratic establishment. In 1976, he was reelected by 201 votes against Young in a rematch that was one of the most expensive congressional races up to that time. When he defeated Republican State Representative John Porter by 650 votes in 1978, he joked to supporters that he had &quot;won by a landslide.&quot; Porter won the seat after Mikva resigned to become a federal judge.

==Federal judicial service==
Mikva was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on May 29, 1979, to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 92 Stat. 1629. Despite opposition from anti-gun control interests that spent over $1 million to oppose his nomination, Mikva was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 25, 1979 and received his commission on September 26, 1979. He served as Chief Judge from 1991 to 1994. His service terminated on September 19, 1994, due to retirement, after which he became White House Counsel to President Bill Clinton.

During his 15 years as judge, including four as Chief Judge, Mikva used his experience in the legislative branch as well as with the conservative Justice Minton to craft his opinions. Mikva&#x27;s most controversial decisions struck down the Pentagon ban against gay people serving in the U.S. military (overturned on appeal by the circuit sitting en banc, but the ban was ultimately overturned by Executive Order), and - in 1982 - upheld regulation of air bags in automobiles.

In 1992, while serving as Chief Judge on the D.C. Circuit, Mikva appeared in the Kevin Kline comedy &quot;Dave&quot; as &quot;Supreme Court Justice Abner J. Mikva,&quot; in a scene in which he administers the presidential oath of office to the Vice President (played by Ben Kingsley).

==Post-judicial career==

Mikva taught law at Northwestern University and was White House Counsel under President Bill Clinton from 1994 to 1995, finding himself the oldest member of the White House team, and eventually resigning due to exhaustion. He then returned to the University of Chicago Law School, serving as the Schwarz Lecturer and the senior director of the Mandel Legal Aid Clinic. While at the University, Mikva came to better know future president Barack Obama, whom he mentored and supported politically. Obama awarded Mikva the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 24, 2014. Mikva offered Obama a law clerk position in his judicial office after Obama graduated from Harvard Law School, but Obama declined. Future Obama appointee and United States Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan did serve as one of Mikva&#x27;s law clerks and was then a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. Mikva also encouraged Obama to listen to preachers to understand public speaking, &quot;listen[ing] to patterns of speech, how to take people up the ladders. It&#x27;s almost a Baptist tradition to make someone faint, and, by God, he&#x27;s doing it now.&quot;

==Other pursuits==

Mikva served as a mediator through JAMS, and was co-chairman of the Constitution Project&#x27;s bipartisan Constitutional Amendments Committee. In November 2004, Mikva was an international election monitor of Ukraine&#x27;s contested presidential election. In July 2006, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich named Mikva chair of the Illinois Human Rights Commission. In 2009, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn requested that Mikva lead a commission investigating the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign for admitting applicants (many of whom were not very well qualified) whose relatives or backers had connections to and had donated money to Illinois state lawmakers.

===Mikva Challenge===

Mikva and his wife Zoe started the Mikva Challenge in 1997. Mikva Challenge is a non-profit, non-partisan organization whose mission is to develop youth to be informed, empowered, and active citizens and community leaders who will promote a just and equitable society. Mikva Challenge has chapters in Chicago, Illinois, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, California, and partner sites spanning the country including Cobb County, Georgia, Wilmington, Delaware, Rochester, New York, New York City, New York, Louisville, Kentucky, Riverside, California, New Hampshire, Detroit, Michigan, and Macomb County, Michigan, Madison, Wisconsin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The organization helps youth to expand their political desire by working as election judges, volunteering on campaigns, advising city officials, and creating local activism projects to improve their schools and communities. Their motto is &quot;Democracy is a Verb!&quot; As of 2020, Mikva Challenge reaches 100,000 youth annually
in programs in over 3,000 schools across the country.

==Death==

Mikva died under hospice care in Chicago, Illinois, from complications of bladder cancer on July 4, 2016, aged 90. He was also suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at the time of his death.

==Legacy and awards==

Mikva&#x27;s congressional and judicial papers are archived at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois. In 1998, Mikva received the Chicago History Museum&#x27;s &quot;Making History Award&quot; for Distinction in Public Service. In 2016, Congress renamed the United States Post Office in downtown Evanston, Illinois, after Mikva, who had lived in Evanston and represented it as a congressional representative.

<text>Janet Elizabeth Burston (January 11, 1935 – March 3, 1998) was an American child actress who was the final leading lady in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects series, replacing Darla Hood in 1942.

==Career==

<text>São João, named for John the Baptist (in Portuguese) is a civil parish in the municipality of Lajes do Pico in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. It is the only civil parish in the municipality with a border on the summit of Pico (2,351 meters). The population in 2011 was 423, in an area of 32.94 km2. It contains the localities Areia, Canada de Baixo, Canada de Cima, Ponta Rasa and Porto São João.

==History==
Oral tradition holds that São João was part of a large southern parish of São Mateus, in the primitive locality of &quot;Arruda&quot;, some from the centre of Lajes. The name, &quot;Arruda&quot; came from a medicinal herb that prospered in the landscape of the parish, a region known for extensive arable agricultural parcels dedicated to cereal production (particularly wheat). At the time of settlement, the parochial church held an extensive 20 alqueires of land in cultivation, as well receiving an annual tithe equal to 15 alqueires. Even today the lands around &quot;Areia&quot; between São Mateus and São João were considered the most productive of this region. Yet, the residents of this area did not only dedicate to cereal production, instead dividing themselves between the fishery and raising of cattle and sheep for wool.

Owing to the growth in population, São Mateus began to be divided into smaller territories, resulting in the dismemberment of Arruda, that would give origin to São João Baptista. Around 1619 a small hermitage was erected by Domingos Marques and his wife, Silveira do Macedo, dedicated to this patron, whose image appeared on the beach. The small hermitage was expanded and elevated to the status of &quot;parochia&quot; (&quot;ecclesiastical parish&quot;) possibly after 1700, from affirmations of Ms. Silveira de Macedo. It is unclear when the religious parish was eventually elevated to civil parish, owing to the rarity of records.

Between February and June 1718 the region was hit by violent volcanic eruption, necessitating the removal of the &quot;Blessed Sacrament&quot; from the sanctuary, first to the Hermitage of Santo António, then later to the Hermitage of São Bartolomeu in the locality of Silveira (Lajes do Pico). It was only on November 2, 1719, that the reliquary and images were returned to the hermitage of Santo António, following a lit procession, since the primitive church in Arruda was completely destroyed by lavas from the eruption. Today, the site is marked by a modest cross over mound of lava. Another eruption occurred in 1720 that isolated the community: after the 1718 a lava field had intersected the only connection to São Mateus, and in 1720, another lava field had cut off access to Lajes. These fields, apart from restricting access to the community, also inundated the productive agricultural lands, coming to be referred to as &quot;terrenos brejeiros&quot; or &quot;poor terrains&quot;.

The rebuilding of the parochial church of Arruda began shortly after the volcanic eruptions and ceased with the inauguration in 1726, when the image of São João was transferred from its sheltered hermitage to the new temple, following a grand procession. By 1829, this new church had outlived its parishioners, and through the initiative of its zealous parish priest, Father Silveira Bulcão, a new church was constructed, with the assistance of donations from the faithful in the Misericórdia of Horta. Father Bulcão did not see the completion of the church (because he was transferred to Madalena), but it was eventually completed under the stewardship of Father Francisco Joaquim Coluna in 1848. Its current appearance came from 1901, under designer Miguel António, and supervised by Father Manuel Garcia da Rosa.

==Geography==
The village of Sao Joao is located on the main roadway (Estrada Regional E.R.1-1ª) between hamlets of Terra do Pao (São Caetano) and Silveira (Lajes do Pico). São João comprises two distinct communities, the upper (Companhia de Cima) and lower (Companhia de Baixo) portions of the village.

The single-bell tower parochial church is in the lower district in close proximity to the small sea port. It was extensively renovated following historical earthquakes, with a tiled front-facade constructed over quarried rock. A secondary chapel was constructed within the past decades to support the &quot;upper&quot; congregation in a modernist style. A park was also constructed around the lava flows that destroyed the original church (in 1720).

The village of Sao Joao is a quiet community that includes a cafe/mercantile shop, restaurants, an auto repair garage (in the location of the former village blacksmith&#x27;s shop), and a commercial cheese factory. Being primarily agricultural community now (as whaling was discontinued in the 1970s), most of the grassing lands are located in the mid-altitudes, as dense vegetation dominate the top of the mountainous Achada Plain and Pico Volcano. Other landmarks include a small chapel used for the Holy Spirit feasts, in each of the upper and lower villages, and village squares constructed (such as the Largo de São João) to provide picnicking facilities, playgrounds and animal pens. Along the seashore, Ponte de São João provides a sand volleyball court, showers and picnic facilities adjacent to a point projecting out in the ocean, with small tidal pools and natural swimming area.

==Economy==
Whaling has been a vital industry in the district until recently, and the port of São João relied on the industry for its development. The clear and deep harbor supported the industry, allowing the commercialization of hundreds of whales annually.

<text>Tanzanian Hip-hop, which is sometimes referred 
to Bongo Flava by many outside of Tanzania&#x27;s hip hop community, encompasses a large variety of different sounds, but it is particularly known for heavy synth riffs and an incorporation of Tanzanian pop.

There is some debate over whether Bongo Flava, which has emerged as a defined pop movement, can really still be qualified under the overarching term &quot;hip hop&quot; and not a movement unto itself, when it is beginning to develop a distinctive sound that differs from hardcore rap or, for example, the Maasai Hip hop of X Plastaz, who use the tradition of the Maasai tribe as the focal point for their sound and style.
Tanzanian hip hop influenced the sound of the Bongo Flava genre. While Tanzanian hip hop retains many of the elements found in hip hop globally in terms of sound and lyricism, Bongo flava, derived from the Swahili word &quot;ubongo&quot; (meaning brains), incorporates hip hop, Indian filmi, taraab, muzik wa dansi, and dancehall beats. It all began in the 1980s when Tanzanian teenagers were really interested in the American hip hop scene. At first, they took American beats and rapped to them. As the youth rapped, the hip hop in Tanzania began to develop into a mix of traditional and localized hip hop scene. As a result, it began a wave of interest from other people in Eastern Africa.

==Bongo Flava==
Etymology of the name &quot;Bongo&quot; of Bongo Flava comes from Kiswahili usually meaning &quot;brains, inelegance, cleverness&quot; but can also mean &quot;mentally deranged&quot;. Bongo is the augmentative form of &quot;Ubongo&quot;, Kiswahili for Brainland. Flava is kiswahili for &quot;Flavour&quot;. Ubongo is a term originally use, and in Tanzania still used, for the city of Dar es Salaam. Outside Tanzania, Ubongo is often referring to Tanzania. Ubongo as a term originated from a speech by President Nyerere in the late 70&#x27;s during a very difficult time following both the global fuel shocks of the 70&#x27;s and the Kagera war against Uganda. Mwalimu Nyerere spoke that only a nation using brains (using Kiswahili &quot;Ubongo&quot; for Brainland) could, and would, overcome the difficult challenges Tanzania was facing. Unfortunately things became even worse for Tanzania, and by the early 1980&#x27;s Dar es Salaam was calling itself mostly by the name &quot;Jua Kali&quot; (hot sun/&quot;world is spinning/dizzy&quot;) but also &quot;Ubongo&quot;. The term Ubongo was being used as a clever way to say both, survival in Dar es Salaam required brains and inelegance, but was also full of mentally deranged people.

In 1981, musician Remmy Ongala founded a band called Matimila. Each band has a unique &quot;mtindo&quot; (style/fashion) and Remmy Ongala&#x27;s band Matimila named their mtindo &quot;Bongo&quot;. Remmy Ongala would become the most famous musician ever for Tanzania, reaching global fame working with English singer Peter Gabriel.

==Music style of Bongo Flava==
There has been a lot of debate over whether Bongo Flava/Fleva is Tanzanian Hip Hop. While many scholars and journalists use Bongo Flava and Hip Hop interchangeably, distinctions are made by many Bongo Flava and Hip Hop artists.

Bongo flava borrows from Tanzanian hip hop, with fast rhythms and rhymes in Swahili. The name &quot;Bongo Flava&quot; comes from the Swahili word for brains: ubongo. Bongo is the nickname of Dar es Salaam. It means that you need brains to survive there. It has evolved over time, combining elements of American rap, R&amp;B, hip hop, with its unique Swahili twist. As much as American culture, the lyrics within Tanzania hip-hop and the culture are politicized, about HIV, poverty, and corruption, or about life, relationships, money, jealously, and love.

Bongo Flava is a mixture of Afrobeat and arabesque melodies, dancehall and hip-hop beats, and Swahili lyrics. It developed in the 1980s when Tanzanian youth started rapping because they were fascinated by the hip-hop scene in the United States. They fairly quickly added their own spin and flavor to the music by localizing it with beats, rhythms, and topics. The genre has become popular very quickly; it is the best-selling musical genre in East Africa, is already a success in neighboring Kenya and Uganda, and is sweeping the African continent and spreading to the rest of the world. In 2004, German record label Out Here Records released the compilation CD, Bongo Flava - Swahili Rap from Tanzania. The 70 minute record which features artists including X Plastaz, Juma Nature, and Gangwe Mobb has enjoyed wide international distribution.

When American hip hop first migrated to Tanzania, local rappers would sample popular American rap beats, simply inserting Swahili rhymes in place of English. This infant Bongo Flava style and imported American hip hop was initially embraced almost exclusively by young upper class individuals who found it fashionable to follow US trends. This was often viewed as Tanzanians simply appropriating American culture and style, relating this to the idea of Americanization. In the early 1990s, as the genre was developing, the &#x27;Kiswacentric&#x27; concept was born. Artists began to &quot;localize&quot; the music by addressing purely Tanzanian issues and eventually using the Swahili language, which in itself is a language with many global influences. Additionally, beats shifted from American hip hop sampling to organic synthesized beats often incorporating local beats, rhythm, and sounds.
 Tanzanian artists ensured that even when rapping in English, they would maintain the Swahili meanings behind their rhymes. By rapping in Swahili they were able to make the hip-hop style their own, while still &quot;keeping it real&quot; by the standards of American Hip-Hop. This Kiswacentric rap has continued the Swahili poetic tradition of using wordplay, puns, and rhyme to express oneself. Many artists strive to use Swahili ideas and culture in their songs and styles rather than reproducing American pop culture or gangsta rap.

The choice of language played an important role in the development and local acceptance of bongo flava. Through rapping in Swahili, many new artists were able to localize hip hop, giving it &quot;a politically charged cultural image&quot; and providing a way to relate it with Tanzanian culture. Tanzanian rapper Dolasoul (Ahmed Dola), who studied in Nigeria and the United Kingdom, notes that rap music, particularly in Swahili, provided him &quot;with the means to represent his people and speak about changes that can be made for ‘a better tomorrow.’&quot; He also notes that albums produced in Swahili, with minimal English, helps to make his language more accepted internationally. The use of Swahili language in bongo flava conveys a particular message and idea to its listeners, instilling a sense of national pride and common culture. Dolasoul mentions that with his use of Swahili and minimal English, he is attempting to &quot;give a wake up call to my people.&quot;

At the same time, the employment of Swahili Rap represents an attempt to negotiate the authentic gangster projection with more traditional and local Tanzanian musical forms. Between the prominent mainstream US hip hop image of gangster rappers and increased radio and television airplay for groups from South Africa, Europe and the Congo region who project that image, Tanzanian rappers are heavily swayed toward a more raw style. While this borrowing of the authentic gangster image as represented outside of Tanzania can be interpreted as an appropriation for localizing purposes, it can also be viewed as mimicry. Since authentic gangster rap is commercially viable, Tanzanian artists are torn between the possibilities it presents and the negative attention it may gain them. Indeed, those who do imitate Western gangster rap are often isolated and derided for being gangster wannabes. Thus, the use of the Swahili language in Tanzanian rap helps take ideas from a larger hip hop discourse and incorporate them into the local context of that African rap culture. It makes sense then that those most dependent on the more marketable hardcore rap generally come from the impoverished regions of Tanzania, like Dar Es Salaam, where any chance at success may be more important than the worry of abandoning national pride in exuding a culturally ambivalent image. One of the paramount rap topics in this issue of balance is the objectification of women, which while it may be more marketable than less explicit forms, stands in contention with the Islamic ideals that many Tanzanians embrace. Still though, crude styles tend to appeal to the urban youth of Tanzania, as exemplified by the rap group LWP Majitu who, according to Out Here Records, &quot;are popular for their hardcore hard hitting lyrics.&quot; Whether in the poorer parts of Tanzania or the more privileged, it is crucial for rap artists to maintain a healthy balance between the traditional and the original, the local and the global.

===Emergence of hip-hop in Tanzania===
Hip hop culture in Tanzania began in the early to mid 1980s chiefly as an underground movement, when promoters and artists would be forced to record and copy music in makeshift studios using rudimentary equipment. Underground rap began, not in the poorer working class areas of Dar es Salaam, but in the slightly more affluent areas of the city, where there was access to the Western world through friends, family, and travel opportunities. Oddly enough, rap first caught on amongst the youth of Tanzania&#x27;s &#x27;middle class.&#x27; These were teens with some formal education, a familiarity with English and a connection in another country who could mail the music to them. Hip hop provided the perfect outlet for Tanzanian youth to voice their anger and dissatisfaction with society. These students of hip hop played an integral part in the formation of bongo flava, &quot;through participation within a transcultural, multilingual and multiracial global hip-hop nation, combining African-American language with Swahili and local street varieties (&quot;Kihuni&quot;)&quot;. In the 1990s, Tanzanian hip hop shifted from an underground phenomenon to commercially accepted model, and became accessible to working class youth as well.

Early Tanzanian rap tended to be in English, but as the genre developed some rappers began writing raps in Swahili. The main venue for their music was live performance, particularly the Yo Rap Bonanza competition. The YRB competition was organized by Indian merchants; notably, it attracted rappers from outside of [Dar es Salaam]. Artists such as Saleh J and Eazy-B performed at the competition.

African American music had always been influential in Tanzania, especially soul and R&amp;B, but with the birth of a socialist government, foreign music was banned in Tanzania. For example a hip hop group from Tanzania, Berry White, exemplifies the influence of African American music solely in the name of the band. It seems as though they are imitating and/or mimicking the world renown Barry White. Moreover, before the socialist government in Tanzania banned foreign music, it was evident that Tanzanian hip hop was heavily influenced by western music, specifically African American music. This gave Tanzanian citizens limited access to hip-hop, and early artists either learned of it by hearing it in a foreign country through connections abroad. For young rappers like Dolasoul, or Balozi, (Ahmed Dola), &quot;it was just for the fun, no money was involved.&quot; Rap music was merely a pastime for the upper and middle classes, in opposition to early hip-hop artists in the United States and South Africa. Education was seem as their way to gain financial and social success and early rappers mostly rapped in English using American lyrics and tracks. The scene began to change in the early 1990s with the breakdown of socialism, allowing hip-hop to become accessible to lower classes through the increase in circulation, and as it became acceptable for local artists and hip-hop fans began recording, copying and distributing hip-hop.

Africa taking notice of this genre of music is another huge advance for Tanzanian hip hop. In the history of Music in Tanzania, there had never been a male bongo flava artist nominated for Kora African music Awards. Yesaya Ambwene aka AY was the first one to be nominated. Ay was nominated in the category of the best male artist from Eastern and Central Africa in 2005. Including this genre in the African music awards reveals a lot of how far this music has come in such a short time.

Currently, hip-hop is not only a music of the elite, but is an important voice for the lower classes and those who are poor and underprivileged. Hip Hop is also the voice of the lower class because it allow them to express what their feelings are about any given situation on the country. Also because this is a way to upper ward mobility and a way to move from poverty to a better economical position. But in particular as Lemelle says &quot;woven together into this scene and the lyrics are a sense of anger and alienation as well as clear desire to seek a better life-weather inside the country or without&quot;. (Hip Hip culture and the children of Arusha, Sydney J. Lamelle). In any case what the lower class in Tanzania use the hip hop as way to show the way in which poor people live in their country and at the same time try to gain some economical position. For example, artist Balozi recently worked on a project with poor Tanzanian boys affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, writing a song expressing their plight. The song, &quot;Hali Duni&quot; proceeded to move to the top of the musical charts in Dar es Salaam, and was featured in several movies.

According to journalist Henry Bukuru (a.k.a. Cxteno Allstar), rap music was by far the greatest influence of hip hop culture in Tanzania. Mponjika described the four rudiments of hip hop culture in Tanzania as: break dancing (b-boying), graffiti art, DJing, and rapping. DJ competitions represented the birth of hip hop, particularly in Zanzibar, which had television to broadcast these competitions that took place live in informal public spaces (school graduations, picnics, house parties).

So many artists have emerged from Bongo Flava, and it is almost impossible to name all of them. The Tanzaninan &quot;Dr.Dre&quot; is certainly Mr. II that was the first Bongo Flava&#x27;s superstar which has now retired. Mr. II is classified as a solo artist in Tanzania, but two groups took over the Bongo Flava industry namely the &quot;TMK&quot; and the &quot;East Coast&quot;. The &quot;Tmk&quot; stands for Temeke which is one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Dar-es-Salaam. In that part of the city inhabits some of the most radical and critical crews such as Juma Nature or Gangwe Mobb. 
The &quot;East Coast&quot; is where rappers from middle or upper class society in a much nicer part of town Upanga, these rappers are known to rap more about the happy sides of life and their music is often compared to commercial music. 
Juma Nature raps about his country and the sense of unity that he exemplifies. His music is easy flowing and is accompanied by synthesised drum with instrumentation. Juma Nature uses a story telling aspect to his rapping.

==Imitation to original formation==
Tanzania, an African country, has a history of European colonization. There has been a long-standing debate in regarding the implicit dynamics of power when a colonized or oppressed culture adopting certain cultural forms (music styles, fashion, etc.) of the colonizers or the oppressors. Is hip-hop in Tanzania mimicry and imitation of American hip-hop, which would imply an American cultural hegemony? Or are artists borrowing some elements of American hip-hop that resonate with them, among a variety of other (for example Tanzanian, Congolese, Japanese, or Cuban) cultural influences and then creating something entirely new, entirely their own? Are these always mutually exclusive? Alex Perullo, writer and professor at Bryant College in Rhode Island, says this: 

[Some say] all this music that is coming from the West such as hip-hop is destroying local cultures and local ideas, and local musical trends. And to some extent, there is a little bit of truth in that, although I would hesitate to say that cultural imperialism is actually happening...There are a lot of artists in Tanzania who do dress exactly like the people that they see from the United States. They wear the FUBU clothing, they wear the baggy pants, they wear the New York Yankees hats...But the problem with that is this is very early in the pop music...They sang in English, and sang about American issues. But now we have artists singing [in] Swahili, and they sing about Swahili issues, about Tanzanian issues, about issues that are very much identified with their country...So I think as far as Tanzanian identity is concerned, yes, there are certain things that they&#x27;re going to keep borrowing from American culture or European culture, or other African cultures, but this doesn&#x27;t mean that there&#x27;s going to be assorted eradication of local trends...the main genres are still there. There not disappearing. There&#x27;s room enough for all these genres to grow, and they each occupy different areas.
There seems to be a debate that is consistently repeated in every single country in which global hip hop is studied, what is truly authentic? Bongo Flava in Tanzania borrows elements from music all over the world, mainly cultural elements (i.e.- style, attitude) from the American hip hop scene. There is a sense that Tanzanian youth look up to the European styles which they apparently mimic. The music is produced using Swahili which makes it seem like the foreign hip hop cultures are the inputs to the output that is Bongo Flava, but this final &quot;output&quot; is different from the sum of its parts.

In an effort to appear authentic, much of Tanzanian hip-hop began imitating the American model of &quot;gangsta&quot; rap, romanticizing aggression and violence. However, as hip-hop evolved in Tanzania, it has slowly diverged from this precedent. Crime in Tanzania is seen as a result of economic need and is very much frowned upon, with &quot;wezi,&quot; or thieves, becoming instant targets for outcasting by the community or falling victim to &quot;instant justice&quot; on the streets. In fact, bongo flava originates from the Swahili word &quot;ubongo&quot; meaning brains, an implication that it takes brains to survive in Dar es Salaam. This interpretation of values conflicts the message sent out by American &quot;gangsta&quot; rap. Furthermore, the gangs in Dar es Salaam share few of the same characteristics of the large drug dealing gangs wreaking havoc in inner city America. In a region where Islam plays a strong role in the lives of the general populace, it is difficult to incorporate the vain outlook on life and the condescending attitude towards women so prevalent in commercially successful rap in America. Consequently, &quot;gangsta&quot; rap has not achieved widespread popularity in Tanzania, although &quot;gangsta&quot; rap will occasionally reveal itself in album sales or on the radio.

Tanzania hip-hop artists often struggle to distance themselves from the styles of American hip-hop, but are making a conscious effort to create their own style. Tanzanian hip hop group Jungle Crewz Posse scoffed at the notion that their songs were just like American music, saying &quot;Rap is not copying from abroad...we are not talking gun. If you showed me a gun it would be hard for me to tell you which is the trigger. I know gun in movies, pictures. We are talking things that we know and see and understand. Tanzanian hip-hop music could have been associated with mimicry and copying from other cultures at one point, but as Bongo flava becomes more developed, its sound will become more and more authentic to Tanzania. Already with a second generation of hip-hop artists emerging new, uniquely African sounds have been used more, including &quot;muziki wa dansi, taarab, and Indian filmi.&quot;

Due to the presence of multiple societies, Tanzania has a torn perspective of its own culture.

There are youth in Tanzania that are entranced with Western culture and modernization enough to want to &quot;become like them&quot; (the West). As most fail and even die to make this transition, bongo-flava songs, while still speaking out against heavy issues like HIV/AIDS, has recently been made to be &quot;uplifting and memorable,&quot; in order to give Tanzanians hope and a positive outlook on life.

Through hip hop, Tanzanian youth combine the best of both worlds. They mimic United States and European styles of hip hop, while still allowing their own African heritage and culture to shine through. Using their native language, they often portray remnants of ancient rituals in the singing and videos. The imitation of already existing forms of hip hop combined with their own style allows Tanzanian hip hop to be truly unique.

===Role in Tanzanian society===
Tanzanian culture embraces President Julius K. Nyerere&#x27;s 1967 &quot;Arusha Declaration&quot; in which called for &quot;Ujamaa&quot;, or familyhood. Being a socialist nation at the time, this declaration called for the halt of corrupt politics and promised protection from the hands of global imperialists. Post-Socialism, when politicians abandoned the principles of Ujamaa, the growing underground Hip-Hop movement of the 1980s readopted it. Presently, Bongo Flava retains its political messages in spite of experiencing a rise in &quot;gangsta&quot; style rap during the 1990s. The Tanzanian culture seemingly refuses to accept violence and vulgarity in its music while romanticizing socialism.

Hip Hop is a force which shaped the project of how to construct the Tanzanian nation. Cultural policies such as national music policies were formed in order to produce a united culture for the Tanzanian nation. These types of policies allowed Swahili bands to emerge and a live entertainment scene to thrive. However, it was not until the 1980s that the birth of hip hop and rap music truly took place. As a result of politicians post Nyerere forgetting about ujamaa and the rise of unemployment and poverty, an avenue for artistic expression was created as an underground movement. While the establishment of hip hop in other countries such as South Africa and Brazil took place among lower classes of the population, hip hop in Tanzania was most common among middle and elite classes due to their access to the western world.

As in many African countries, hip hop has become a medium for post-colonial expression and the development of a youth voice. According to Sidney Lemelle, rap and hip hop have been &quot;localized and indigenized to fit the political economic and social cultural realities of post-colonial/neo-colonial struggles, and both have served as avenues for artistic expression and political protest.&quot; Rap has become a way for youth in Tanzania to teach other others about joblessness, corruption, class differences, AIDS and other problems that are faced within the Tanzanian society. It has formed a type of community for the youth to bind together building confidence and self-reliance rather than anger and violence which is the stereotype of how the rappers in the society are. It also provides validation that they are not the only ones facing these pressures every day. Pieter Remes found out in his research that regardless of where the music was produced whether locally or abroad, that the music was intertwined with the experience and expression of urban youth in many different dynamic ways.

It has also become a medium with roots in the oral tradition of some countries like Tanzania. This can be seen in street entertainment known as mchiriku which is very popular in Dar es Salaam. Mchiriku is a style of music that is very popular around the poor areas of Dar es Salaam, Coastal and Morogoro regions. Its repetitive, fast-paced rhythms are considered unsoothing by the wealthy people in Tanzania. Mchiriku is played with a small hand held keyboard, old tins beaten with sticks, drums and whistles. Mchiriku songs are known for biting social commentary.

Tanzanian hip hop has been seen to voice many positive messages. Music has served as an alternative to newspapers, radio, and other forms of news about social issues and conditions. Tanzanian rappers have been seen to work with government organizations and NGOs regarding social issues among youth such as AIDS awareness and drugs. Such NGOs have been founded to promote this type of education which has been coined &#x27;Edutainment&#x27;, which is the mixing of education with popular culture in order to transmit these messages to youth. Madunia is an organization based in the Netherlands which promotes African music and the local initiatives of African musicians. It also gives advice on the use of this music as a &quot;medium of development&quot;.

Female rappers have had difficulty finding success in East Africa. The media in Tanzania was slow to accept female artists, &quot;who might offer a gendered voice and a counter-narrative in the public sphere.&quot; Kenyan rapper Nazizi developed a large following in Tanzania and worked with Tanzanian producers P-Funk Majani and Mika Mwamba. Although she has been successful competing against male MCs, Nazizi insists that she &quot;would really love to see more ladies jumping onto the rap bandwagon.&quot; The biggest difficulty facing female rappers is that they must overcome the assumption that MCing is a masculine activity and that hip hop is associated with gangs and violence.

Sidney J. Lemelle writes that if a song had explicit lyrics about women then it was hardly aired on Tanzanian television. The government plays a big role in there. With all these negative environmental factor on rappers, including the ones explained in the last paragraph, really put down the female artist to grow. That is why the author states that it is not surprising that &quot;there are only a few female Kiswahili rappers in East Africa.&quot; A few of the popular Tanzanian female artists are Dataz, Lade Lou, Bad Gear, SJ and Aunt Su. According to Eric Toroka, Dataz second solo album&#x27;s name was &quot;Zali la moshi&quot;. &quot;Florence Kasela, famous as Dataz is among few other hip hop female artists in Tanzania&quot; are also joining the hip-hop movement in all over the country. Dataz states to her fellow &quot;hip hop artists that they should not misinterpret hip-hop&quot;. She said, &quot;A big difficulty is that people consider hip hop as hooliganism but they actually don&#x27;t know what it is. I think they should sit down and listen to tracks like Chemsha bongo and more and then comment about it.&quot; Thus, it can be said that the wrong definition of hip-hop and government influence plays a big role in this situation.

=== Events and Organizations ===
There have been several organizations and events that emerged to provide platforms for Hip Hop culture in Tanzania. These include the (now defunct) Hip Hop Kilinge (Cypher), a weekly event that brought youth to the New Msasani Club in Dar es Salaam for performances, battles, and education sessions. In Arusha, the Hip Hop NGO Okoa Mtaa (Save the Streets) organizes regular Hip Hop festivals and workshops that focus on various Hip Hop elements, like lyricism and photography. Hip Hop artist Fid Q organized several Hip Hop initiatives, including the interview show FidStyle Fridays, the open mic event Poetry Addiction, and the Hip Hop Darasa (class) for aspiring artists. Lyricist Lounge, later renamed The Lounge, was started by Shamsa Suleiman and New York Native FetJen, and hosted monthly open mic nights for upcoming and established artists.

=== Bongo Flava and HIV/AIDS ===
Hip hop has been used as a major vehicle for awareness about HIV/AIDS. In her article, Sidney refers to Tanzanian rapper Dully Sykes and a song he released in 2001 called ‘Nyambizi’ (Swahili for voluptuous woman). The song lyrics talk about having unprotected sex, and many radio stations refused to play the song. The ubiquity of sexual themes in music has created a lot of controversy in Tanzania because it is estimated that 12-15% of the population is infected with HIV or AIDS. In response, many artists have begun using hip hop to bring awareness to the AIDS epidemic and to teach youth safe sexual practices. Ishi (the Swahili command to live) is the name of a government-sponsored organization that helps promote safe sex. &quot;Our main theme – don&#x27;t feel shy, talk with your partner about abstinence, being faithful or using a condom,&quot; says Nassoro Ally, a regional outreach coordinator for Ishi. Ally Adds that hip hop is a great way to reach youth who may not know how to read and write, but who do participate in the hip hop scene in Tanzania. With roots in the Maasai tradition, elements of hip hop, and the contributions of super star innovators like X Plastaz, hip hop is being used to transmit an important message across Tanzania and in other African countries as well.

==Bongo Records==
Bongo records is owned by a very influential person in the Tanzanian hip-hop/Bongo Flava scene that is taking place in this part of Africa. Paul Matthysse who is also known as P-Funk Majani, is not only the owner of Bongo Records but also as talented producer, who has had a lot of input in the way the genre of music is shaped. He has been the winner of Kili Music Award in Tanzania as producer of the year 3 times. Matthysse also produced the Album of the year in 2005 and 2006, song of the year in 2005 and 2006, best hip-hop album in 2006. He is considered as Tanzania&#x27;s most prominent Bongo Flava producer. And is credited as one of the founders of the genre P.Funk.

==Swah rap==
Swahili rap, known as Swah Rap, began to develop in the early 1990s. Led by the Kwanza Unit, a group composed of many of the major artists, Swah rap sought to bring Tanzanian themes to their rap. Kwanza Unit modeled a Kwanzian Nation after Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s Zulu Nation. Kwanzian Nation tried to bring positive messages to the music. These artists combined their traditional word play, evocative puns, and rhyming with Tanzanian topics to fight working class oppression and develop authentic Tanzanian culture. However, in reality, many Swah Rap tracks have been infiltrated by words and themes from American &quot;gangsta rap.&quot;

Famous Swah Rap Artists include Villain Gangsters, Tribe X, Riders Posse, K singo and Abbas Maunda.

===Tanzanians&#x27; view of American rap music===
Rappers such as Sam Stigillydaa has said, &quot;American rappers talk about crazy things- drinking, drugs, violence against women, American blacks kill blacks. I hope African rap stays African and doesn&#x27;t turn crazy.&quot; Tanzanians view the United States as an aggressive country that romanticizes both violence and crime whereas Tanzania dispels such a romanticization of violence and crime. Tanzanians view crime as caused by economic need, not greed, and those who become criminals risk having people brand them social outcasts. Tanzanians also view cultural imperialism as a form of symbolic violence that relies on a relationship of constrained communication to extort submission.

<doc id="1243596" wikidata="Q4745974" url="?curid=1243596" title="Amfac">
<text>Amfac, Inc., formerly known as American Factors and originally H. Hackfeld &amp; Co., was a land development company in Hawaii. Founded in 1898 as a retail and sugar business, it was considered one of the so-called Big Five companies in the Territory of Hawaii. At its peak, it owned of land, was a dominant sugar company in Hawaii, and was the founder of one of its best known department store chains, Liberty House. It ended with the completion of a bankruptcy proceeding in 2005, with a small successor company, Kaanapali Land, LLC (), owning of land in Kaanapali on the island of Maui.

==History==

In 1849, German immigrant Heinrich Hackfeld formed a dry goods store called Hackfeld&#x27;s Dry Goods in Honolulu. Hackfeld later became the business agent for Kōloa Plantation on the island of Kauai. Paul Isenberg became a partner in 1881. In 1898, the Hackfeld and Isenberg family interests in Hawaii were officially reorganized as H. Hackfeld &amp; Co.

During World War I, H. Hackfeld &amp; Co. was seized by the U.S. government Alien Property Custodian. It was later sold to a consortium of Hawaii businessmen in 1918, who changed the name to &quot;American Factors&quot;. In 1966, the name was further shortened to &quot;Amfac&quot;. 
Henry Alexander Walker became president in 1933. The family estate in Nuuanu Valley, known as the H. Alexander Walker Residence, was developed into a showcase orchid garden.

From 1968 to 1972, under president Henry Alexander Walker Jr., Amfac acquired 42 companies. These included the Fred Harvey Company, which had grown to fame operating Harvey House restaurants along railroad lines starting in 1876.

Gulf+Western Industries owned a 25% stake in the company, which was sold in 1983.

===California businesses in the 1970s===
As of the 1970s, Amfac ran a variety of hospitality, retail, financial and other businesses in California, among other states. 
California was its second state after Hawaii. It operated:
* 13 Joseph Magnin specialty department stores across Southern California.
* The restaurants at the Los Angeles Music Center.
* The Airport Marina Hotel, operated by Fred Harvey.
* Fred Harvey&#x27;s Furnace Creek Inn and Ranch in Death Valley (now the Inn at Death Valley). 
* The Victor Hugo Inn in Laguna Beach.
* The Tejon Ranch House in Lebec.
* The Ranch House Inn in Valencia.
* Fred Harvey-operated food and beverage and in-flight dining services at Ontario Airport and Palm Springs International Airport.
* Amfac Mortgage, providing real estate financing services from six offices.
* Amfac Properties and Amfac Communities, offering real estate development and management services including Canyon Sands in Palm Springs, California.
* Amfac Drug Supply, distributing pharmaceuticals to hospitals and pharmacies from six branches.
* Amfac Electric Supply, distributing materials to contractors and builders from a dozen branches.

===1980s–2000s===
In 1987, Ronald Sloan was removed as chief executive and president and was replaced by Richard Griffith (Henry Walker Jr. was still chairman of the board). The company announced it was selling its non-Hawaii business units. 
Amfac was bought by Chicago-based JMB Realty in 1988 for $920 million. 

As the sugar industry in Hawaii declined after statehood, so did the fortunes of Amfac. The company&#x27;s assets were gradually sold off or closed. Oahu Sugar in Waipahu was closed in 1995. Liberty House went into bankruptcy in 1998 (it was later acquired by Federated Department Stores and now carries the Macy&#x27;s brand name). The Pioneer Mill in Lahaina closed in 1999, and the Kekaha Sugar Mill and Lihue Plantation closed in 2000. West Maui Land acquired the former Pioneer Mill fields above Launiupoko Beach Park. Steve Case acquired the Lihue plantation in 2001. Amfac Hawaii went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002. Amfac Parks &amp; Resorts was retained by JMB and was renamed Xanterra Parks &amp; Resorts. Amfac Hawaii was reorganized as Kaanapali Land, LLC and the bankruptcy closed in 2005.
Some of the former plantation land uphill from the resort has been subdivided into a development called Kāʻanapali Coffee Farms.

<doc id="1243600" wikidata="Q5558405" url="?curid=1243600" title="Giant Robot (magazine)">
<text>Giant Robot is a website and former bimonthly magazine focusing on Asian and Asian-American popular culture, founded in Southern California in 1994. It was one of the earliest American publications to feature prominent Asian film stars such as Chow Yun-fat and Jet Li, as well as Asian musicians from indie and punk rock bands. Its coverage later expanded into art, design, Asian-American issues, travel, and much more.

== Publication history ==
Eric Nakamura (BA &#x27;93) and Martin Wong (BA &#x27;90) had met when they were both undergraduate students at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where they bonded over their shared interest in punk music and Asian pop culture. &quot;Giant Robot&quot;, named after the Japanese TV series Giant Robo, was initially created as a small, punk-minded magazine that featured Asian pop culture and Asian-American alternative culture, including such varied subject matter as history, art, music, film, books, toys, technology, food, and skateboarding. The publication grew from its original format—a small, photocopied zine, folded and stapled by hand—to its eventual full-color format. In the early days, Wong and Nakamura independently approached bookstores and music shops to ask if they would carry the magazine.

In 2003, the magazine could be found at Barnes &amp; Noble, Tower Records, Virgin Store, Borders, and UCLA Ackerman Union, amongst other location. In 2004, there were 60,000 copies in circulation annually.

&quot;Giant Robot&quot; briefly had an in-magazine zine insert titled &quot;Giant Power.&quot;

Nakamura and Wong are featured on the DVD release of the collection of animated short films &quot;The Animatrix&quot;, discussing anime in the &quot;Making of the Animatrix&quot; documentary.

The last issue of the magazine, #68, was released in February 2011, featuring the work of Luke Chueh on the cover.

Also in 2011, &quot;Giant Robot&quot; launched its new website and updated content, including articles, video, and products daily.

== &quot;Giant Robot&quot; store ==
Tired of always redirecting customers to third-party sellers for items that they featured in the magazine, they began a mail-order service to sell those Asian products directly to the readers. In the late 1990s, &quot;Giant Robot&quot; expanded its endeavor to an online retail store, selling artist goods, designer vinyl dolls, minifigures, plush dolls, stationeries, art, T-shirts, and many creative goods.

The success of the commercial website enabled the establishment of a brick-and-mortar retail store in 2001, first in Los Angeles and later in San Francisco. A third store, called GR2, was opened in Los Angeles, and features work by young contemporary artists. &quot;Giant Robot&quot; further expanded to a fourth store in New York City, and a fifth in Silverlake. The GR2, San Francisco, and New York locations feature monthly art exhibitions from up-and-coming and established artists.

As of 2009, the Silverlake store has closed. The New York store closed in 2010 and the San Francisco store closed in 2011. &quot;Giant Robot&quot; had an association with Lost Weekend Video in the Mission District of San Francisco, where they opened a pop-up shop; Lost Weeked Video closed in 2018. As of 2024, GR2 Gallery and the Giant Robot Store are located in Los Angeles.

Their first art show featured works by artist David Choe.

== &quot;Giant Robot&quot; events ==
In 2007, &quot;Giant Robot&quot; published its 50th issue and celebrated with an art exhibition at the Japanese American National Museum titled, &quot;Giant Robot Biennale: 50 Issues.&quot; Subsequent exhibitions took place at the museum in 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2024.

In 2010, &quot;Giant Robot&quot; presented Zen Garage at the Japanese American National Museum featuring the Scion xb Famicom Car designed by Nakamura.

<doc id="1243601" wikidata="Q916068" url="?curid=1243601" title="Orange County Blue Star">
<text>Orange County Blue Star was an amateur American soccer team based in Irvine, California. Founded in 1997, the team played in the USL Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, in the Southwest Division of the Western Conference until 2012.

The team played its home games at Eagle Stadium on the campus of Concordia University, where they played from 2007 to 2012. The team&#x27;s colors are white and black.

==History==
===Zodiac Professional era===
Blue Star began life as Orange County Zodiac in the USISL A-League in 1997, finishing fifth in the Pacific Conference in their inaugural season, with Gustavo Leal leading the scoring charts. The team suffered three years of middling results, only advancing to the post season in 1999, where they lost to the Seattle Sounders in the Round of 16. The Zodiac played some of their games at Santa Ana Stadium. They changed their name to Orange County Waves prior to the 2000 season, their final one in the A-League, but finished rock bottom of the Pacific Conference, and took the 2000–01 offseason to consider their options.

===Drop to PDL; Blue Star is born===
The club dropped down to the PDL in 2001 and changed their name again, and the newly christened Blue Star immediately enjoyed success. They finished their first year in the fourth tier as Champions of the Southwest division, but were defeated by eventual championship runners-up, Calgary Storm, in the Conference semi-finals. 2002 was frustrating, with Blue Star finishing a third in the division and missing out on the playoffs, but 2003 was better, for although they finished second to Fresno Fuego in the divisional table, they advanced all the way to the national playoff semi-finals, falling 3–1 to Chicago Fire Reserves at the penultimate hurdle. The 2003 regular season included some stunning results, including a pair of 5–1 victories over Fresno Fuego and San Diego Gauchos, a 5–2 demolition of Nevada Wonders, and a breathtaking 5–4 win over BYU Cougars which featured a hat trick by Ryan Coiner.

 The year 2003 was a landmark season due to the participation of a certain German player named Jay Göppingen, who played eight games and scored five goals for Blue Star. Goppingen was actually the pseudonym used by former Inter Milan, Bayern Munich and Tottenham Hotspur striker Jürgen Klinsmann who, following his relocation from Europe to California, decided he wanted to keep playing for a year or so, just for fun, and to impart his wisdom to Orange County&#x27;s young soccer players. Klinsmann was born in the city of Göppingen in Baden-Württemberg.

The 2004 season saw Blue Star relocate from the stadium at UC Irvine to the Home Depot Center in Carson, but the change of surroundings didn&#x27;t stop them from winning their second divisional title in style, finishing four points ahead of second-place Fresno Fuego, and losing just 3 regular season games all season. Blue Star enjoyed a number of free-scoring victories, putting five past Nevada Wonders in mid May, and topping rivals Southern California Seahorses 4–2 in June. The playoffs saw them take care of Spokane Shadow in the opening game, but eventually lose the Western Conference title to Fresno Fuego.

Blue Star enjoyed probably the most successful year in their history in 2005, retaining their division title with comparative ease by finishing a clear 11 points ahead of their nearest rivals, Southern California Seahorses. Once again, Blue Star were the league&#x27;s free-scoring entertainers, scoring more than four goals on six occasions, including a 6–2 road victory over San Diego Gauchos, and two 5–0 demolitions of BYU Cougars and Nevada Wonders. The 2005 squad included a number of players who would later go on to grace Major League Soccer and the US Men&#x27;s National Team, including Sacha Kljestan, Calen Carr, Robbie Rogers, Kamani Hill, and top scorer Kei Kamara from Sierra Leone, who knocked in 12 goals in his 14 starts. Blue Star easily advanced to the post-season playoffs where, after beating Fresno Fuego and Northwest champions Cascade Surge, they fell by the odd goal in three to the eventual national champions, Des Moines Menace. Blue Star&#x27;s impressive early season form also took them to the US Open Cup for the first time since 1999, but they were beaten 3–1 in the first round by El Paso Patriots. Blue Star finished 2005 with the best regular season record in the country, winning 15 out of their 16 games, suffering just one loss, and finishing with a +39 goal difference.
With their conference expanding to 9 teams, Blue Star did not find life in 2006 quite as easy, but they still finished second in the division behind Southern California Seahorses. Playing out of yet another new stadium – Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa – Blue Star started the season strongly, winning four of their first five games, including an astonishing 4–3 victory over San Fernando Valley Quakes which saw them score 4 goals in the final 8 minutes of the game. A strong season finish saw Blue Star win six of their last eight games, and their form continued into the playoffs, where they overcame Abbotsford Rangers and BYU Cougars to take the Western Conference title for the second year in a row, before losing to Michigan Bucks in the national semi finals. Anthony Hamilton and Sal Zizzo were the season&#x27;s top scorers with 8 and 4 goals respectively, while Sem Lopez contributed 3 assists.

The 2007 season, however, marked the first season when things did not go Blue Star&#x27;s way. Playing out of their third stadium in as many years – Concordia University in Irvine – for the first time in a long time the team finished with a losing record, picking up just 3 wins all season, and finishing a lowly 9th in the divisional table, a full 19 points adrift of league leaders Fresno Fuego and San Fernando Valley Quakes. The sole high point in a hugely disappointing season was the 3–0 victory over Bakersfield Brigade in early July, and it is indicative of the unexpected slump in form the team suffered that the season&#x27;s top scorer, Patrick Marion, notched just 5 of the team&#x27;s 18 goals.

Blue Star started 2008 brightly, hoping to put the misery of the dismal 2007 season behind them. Two wins in their first four games – 4–1 over old rivals Southern California Seahorses (in which all four Blue Star goals were scored by Jeffrey Clark) and 3–1 over Lancaster Rattlers – initially kept spirits high, but things quickly turned sour. Blue Star didn&#x27;t win another game until July, and during their mid-season drought suffered seven defeats in nine games, including a 6–1 hammering by Los Angeles Legends, a 3–0 home defeat by Fresno Fuego, and a humiliating 4–2 loss away to Lancaster Rattlers in what was that franchise&#x27;s second ever victory. As July came round, Blue Star were rooted at the foot of the Southwest standings, but three victories in their last three games, including an impressive 3–1 win over Bakersfield Brigade, gave their year at least some small semblance of respectability. Nevertheless, Blue Star finished 8th of 10 in the division, twelve points behind divisional champions San Fernando Valley Quakes. Jeffrey Clark was the team&#x27;s top scorer, with seven goals, while Tomer Konowiecki notched up four assists.

The 2009 season began superbly for Blue Star, with four wins in their first four games – including an impressive 4–0 over divisional new boys Ogden Outlaws that featured a hat trick from striker David Ponce – and four straight clean sheets for goalkeeper Kris Minton taking them to the first round of the US Open Cup for the first time since 2005. However, having gone unbeaten in their first six regular season games through the end of May, Blue Star collapsed in mid-season, and endured an awful ten game winless streak through June and July that saw the teams fall to a number of comprehensive defeats, losing 5–1 to Fresno Fuego, 3–0 to Bakersfield Brigade, and conceding a late equalizer in the return game against Fresno to draw 2–2 when victory looked to be on the cards. Even their cup run ended quickly with a 5–2 loss at the hands of NPSL side Sonoma County Sol. A final day 1–0 victory on the road in Utah against BYU Cougars restored a little bit of pride for the team which once dominated the division, but it was much too little too late, and they finished the year a distant eighth in the table. David Ponce scored five goals, but such was the squad&#x27;s instability that head coach Spencer used 46 players during the course of the season, including ex-professional Mike Munoz and Ian Sarachan, son of former Chicago Fire MLS coach Dave Sarachan.

<doc id="1243604" wikidata="Q3290101" url="?curid=1243604" title="The Daily Pennsylvanian">
<text>The Daily Pennsylvanian, Inc. is the independent student media organization of the University of Pennsylvania. The DP, Inc. publishes &quot;The Daily Pennsylvanian&quot; newspaper, &quot;34th Street&quot; magazine, and &quot;Under the Button&quot; satirical publication&quot;,&quot; as well as four newsletters: Daybreak, The Toast, Quaker Nation, and Penn, Unbuttoned.

The Daily Pennsylvanian is published in print once per week when the university is in session, by a staff of more than 400 students. Content is also published online on a daily basis. &quot;34th Street Magazine&quot;, an arts and culture magazine, which is published once a month in print, and &quot;Under the Button&quot;, a satirical publication, also regularly publish content online. The organization operates three principal websites: thedp.com, 34st.com, and underthebutton.com. It has received various collegiate journalism awards.

==History==
&quot;The Daily Pennsylvanian&quot; was founded in 1885 as a successor to the &quot;University Magazine&quot;, a publication by the Philomathean Society. The newspaper has been published daily since 1894, except for a hiatus from May 1943 to November 1945 on account of World War II. The &quot;DP&quot; broke away from the university in 1962 to become an independent publication, incorporating in 1984 to solidify its financial and editorial independence from the university. Also in 1962 the previously all-male daily began to accept female students. Among the early few women were Mary Selman Hadar, formerly an editor at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;; Clara Bargellini, today a professor of Mexican art at the National Autonomous University of Mexico; and Susan Nagler Perloff, a Philadelphia freelance writer. Today the newspaper&#x27;s budget is funded primarily through the sale of advertising by professional and student staff.

==Description==
The &quot;DP&quot; is sometimes called Penn&#x27;s &quot;unofficial journalism department,&quot; because the university has no journalism department (though it does have the prestigious Annenberg School for Communication), and because many of its staff members go on to pursue careers in the print, broadcast, and digital media. &quot;DP&quot; alumni can be found at a number of major daily newspapers and national magazines, including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Business Week&quot;.

==Awards==

In 2008, the DP was awarded the Society of Professional Journalists&#x27; National Mark of Excellence Award. In the same year, the paper won the Spring 2008 Columbia Gold Crown, awarded to eight college newspapers nationwide. It received first place in the Associated Collegiate Press&#x27;s Kansas City Convention Best of Show Competition in 2008. The DP won the Pacemaker, awarded by the Associated Collegiate Press and the Newspaper Association of America Foundation in 1990, 1997, 1998, 2000-2004, 2007, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2024. It was ranked as the &quot;most read&quot; college newspaper by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; in 1990, 1997, 1998, and 2001. In 2006, College Publisher awarded the &quot;DP&quot; first place in the category of Best Online Sports Coverage and, in 2008, it was awarded an online Gold Crown for thedp.com.

<text>The ringed teal (Callonetta leucophrys) is a small duck of South American forests. It is the only species of the genus Callonetta. Usually placed with the dabbling ducks (Anatinae), this species may actually be closer to shelducks and belong in the subfamily Tadorninae; its closest relative is possibly the maned duck.

== Description ==
The male and female remain colourful throughout the year, lacking an eclipse plumage. The drake has a rich chestnut back, pale grey flanks, and a salmon-coloured breast speckled in black. A black band runs from the top of its head down to the nape. Females have an olive-brownish back, a head blotched and striated in white, and pencilled barring on a pale chest and belly. Both males and females have a dark tail, a contrasting pale rump, and a distinctive white patch on the wing. Bills are grey and legs and feet are pink in both sexes. Pairs easily bond. Their contact calls are a cat-like &quot;mee-oowing&quot; in ducks and a lingering &quot;peewoo&quot; in drakes. Most ringed teals average long, with a wingspan. Individuals typically weigh . Ringed teals also have webbed toes with long, pointed claws that specialize in allowing the birds to sit on tree branches. These specialized toes are unique, as most waterfowl cannot easily remain perched on tree branches.

The ringed teal breeds in north-west Argentina and Paraguay, also occurring in Bolivia, Brazil and Uruguay. Upon reaching sexual maturity, ringed teals form strong pair bonds. These pair bonds typically last a single breeding season but can last for the lifetime of a pair. A pair bond begins with the male courting the female. In general, courting consists of large amounts of preening, flashing the iridescent green speculum, and swimming in figure eights around the female of interest while vocalizing. Once a pair bond is solidified, mating occurs in the water. Nests are usually created out of hollow holes in tree cavities. The nests are lined with down, and the female tends to be the defender of the nest. The male will defend the female against other males and potential predators throughout their pair bond. Females typically lay 6-12 eggs that are white in colour. The eggs are incubated for an average of 29 days. Both male and female participate incubating the eggs, but one captive study shows that the females were solely responsible for incubation. Hatched chicks are precocial, having a layer of down and effectively walking, functioning, and feeding themselves. Although the chicks hatch with a layer of feather down, it is not immediately waterproof. Until their own oil glands are fully developed, chicks receive their waterproofing oils from contact with their parents&#x27; feathers. Both the male and female play a large role in raising and defending the chicks until fledging at 50–55 days old. The male tends to be the most invested and will often be seen following behind separated or slower chicks. Until fledging, the chicks stay in a close group and learn quickly from their parents how to forage, swim efficiently, and avoid predators. The bonded pair is often able to produce two groups of offspring in one breeding season. The male will continue to care for the first group of chicks while the female incubates the second group of eggs. The ringed teal&#x27;s pair bonding behaviour makes reproduction very efficient. It is possible for a bonded pair to have laid and hatched up to 24 offspring by the end of a breeding season.

Their habitats include tropical, swampy forests and marshy clearings in well-wooded lowlands, as well as secluded pools and small streams. As a predominantly aquatic species, ringed teals eat a variety of aquatic plants and invertebrates, as well as any seeds that can be found. Ringed teals are classified as “dabblers” as opposed to “divers”. Dabblers tend to feed on plant and insect material near the surface of the water, where as divers feed on plants, invertebrates, and fish deeper under the water&#x27;s surface. Although dabblers may submerge their heads and upper torso while putting their tails up in the air, also known as “up-ending”, they rarely completely submerge themselves and stay under for periods of time, such as the divers do.

Ringed teals can live up to 15 years in captivity, however, an average life span is not known for wild individuals.

<doc id="1243619" wikidata="Q2872843" url="?curid=1243619" title="Ontario Highway 402">
<text>King&#x27;s Highway 402, commonly referred to as Highway 402 and historically as the Blue Water Bridge Approach, is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that connects the Blue Water Bridge international crossing near Sarnia to Highway 401 in London. It is one of multiple trade links between Ontario and the Midwestern United States. It is four lanes for much of its length, though the approach to the Blue Water Bridge is six lanes.

Although Highway 402 was one of the original 400-series highways when it was designated in 1953, the freeway originally merged into Highway 7 near the present Highway 40 interchange in what was, at the time, Sarnia Township. In 1972, construction began to extend Highway 402 from Sarnia to Highway 401 near London thus creating a bypass to Highway 7; construction took over a decade. The final section of the extension, between Highway 81 and Highway 2, opened to traffic in 1982. The removal of an intersection at Front Street in Sarnia made the entire route a controlled-access highway.

Motorists crossing into Michigan at the western end have direct access to Interstate 69 (I-69) and Interstate 94 (I-94) into Port Huron; motorists crossing onto the Canadian side from the east end of I-69 and I-94 have access to Toronto via Highway 401, and onwards to Montreal via A-20 in Quebec. The only town along Highway 402 between Sarnia and London is Strathroy.

Since September 26, 2019, the speed limit is on most of its length, with the exceptions of the speed limit of in Sarnia and near the Highway 401 interchange.

== Route description ==
Highway 402 begins on the Canadian side of the Blue Water Bridge. Across the St. Clair River, Highway 402 continues in Michigan as I-69 and I-94. The twin bridge crossing has six lanes of traffic and non-stop freeway access.
This provides a quicker route than the busier Ambassador Bridge crossing in Windsor, which features over ten traffic lights leading to the four-lane bridge, although that situation is expected to be rectified after the planned Gordie Howe International Bridge is constructed.
Although Highway 402 passes through Sarnia, it is not intended to operate as a commuter highway; at Highway 40 and westward all ramps leading to the westbound lanes of the freeway were originally signed as &quot;Bridge To U.S.A.&quot; without reference to Highway 402, though these have been replaced in the early 2000s with signs saying &quot;402 West Bridge To U.S.A.&quot;.

After descending over the village of Point Edward and passing through a customs plaza, the freeway curves as it crosses Front Street (former Highway 40B) and a former railway line. Running north of the former Holmes Foundry (closed in 1988 by owner Chrysler), the route then becomes parallel to and north of Exmouth Street as it dives under the Christina Street overpass and enters the City of Sarnia.

East of the Murphy Road underpass, the freeway curves to the northeast to bypass its original alignment. It crosses the Howard Watson Nature Trail, a mixed-use recreational trail that was converted from a Canadian National Railway (CNR) line in 1988.
The highway curves back to its east–west orientation at an interchange with Highway 40 (Modeland Road). It passes south of Sarnia Chris Hadfield Airport before exiting the city limits at Mandaumin Road (Lambton Road 26).

Now parallel and north of London Line, the former route of Highway 7 (the predecessor route between Sarnia and London),
the freeway jogs north to travel along the back lot line of farmland fronting London Line and the concession road north of Highway 402. The highway split at least one farm in half during its construction, with the family’s barn being burned down to make way for the construction. The freeway passes by a truck inspection station (eastbound traffic only) and truck rest area (westbound traffic only, formerly a truck inspection station) before being crossed by Camlachie Road. It meets Lambton County Road 21 (Oil Heritage Road), the northern terminus of the Oil Heritage Route, north of the town of Wyoming. The county road is also a former southern extension of Highway 21, which itself begins as Forest Road to the east. Highway 21 is also known as the Bluewater Route, as most of its length is parallel to the shore of Lake Huron.
After passing an interchange with Forest Road, the freeway is crossed by London Line and momentarily diverges from its straight alignment to dip south of Warwick. It continues east through large patches of farmland, then meets with Middlesex County Road 81 (Victoria Street) at an interchange as it passes north of Strathroy.
Shortly thereafter it curves to the southeast and zig-zags towards London, bisecting farms and dividing woodlands. The freeway passes to the west of the town of Delaware and curves east. It enters London and meets interchanges with Highway 4 south of Lambeth, as well as with Wonderland Road before merging into Highway 401. Access to westbound and from eastbound Highway 401 is provided via Highway 4 or Wonderland Road.

The freeway generally uses Parclo A2 and Parclo B2 designs for interchanges. Exceptions include the Front Street interchange in Sarnia, which is a hybrid of a diamond and Parclo B2 interchange (previously a Parclo AB2 until the mid-2000s), and the Highway 40 interchange which is a Parclo B-4. There is presently no interchange using the full six ramp Parclo A4 layout (a common design on other Ontario freeways) on the entirety of Highway 402; although several interchanges do have five ramps, while the junction with Indian Road was previously a Parclo A4 until the directional ramp in the NW quadrant was removed and replaced with a signalized left turn in the late 1990s.

== History ==
Planning for the route that would become Highway 402 began following the completion of the Blue Water Bridge in 1938. A divided highway was constructed through Sarnia following World War II; it was completed and designated in 1953. The Department of Highways announced its intent to extend the route to Highway 401 in 1957. However, while some preliminary work began in the early 1960s, it would take until 1968 for a preferred route to be announced, and until 1972 for construction to begin. Work was carried out through the remainder of the 1970s, and the freeway was completed and ceremonially opened in late 1982. Since completion as a four-lane route, expansion work has been concentrated on the portion of the freeway in Sarnia approaching the border crossing.

=== Construction ===
Highway 402 is one of the original 400-series highways. It was numbered in 1953, a year after Highway 400 and Highway 401.
The short dual highway was built as an approach to the Blue Water Bridge, which itself opened to traffic October 10, 1938.
As such, the highway was named the Blue Water Bridge Approach. Construction began in 1939. However, like many other road projects, World War II halted construction. In 1947 a new survey was undertaken; construction resumed by 1952. The approach road was opened in 1953, at which point the route was designated Highway 402. It featured an interchange with Christina Street and at-grade intersections with Front Street, Indian Road and Modeland Road (the Highway 40 Sarnia bypass); after Modeland Road the route continued to London as Highway 7.

Ultimately, Highway 402 was designated with the intent of extending it to Highway 401. This was formally announced by the Department of Highways in late 1957.
Construction on a new grade-separated intersection with Modeland Road began in 1963 and opened in 1964, although as before Highway 402 still continued eastward as Highway 7.
On February 28, 1968, a extension towards London was officially announced by Minister of Highways George Gomme.
It was decided to construct the extension on a new right-of-way, as had been done with most freeways constructed after Highway 400. East of the Murphy Road overpass, Highway 402 was re-aligned to bypass the interchange with Highway 40 constructed in 1964; Exmouth Street was redirected to connect with Highway 7 (London Line) at that junction, and Quinn Street now follows the former routing of Highway 402.
For the new Highway 402, an overpass crossing was required with the then-CNR line (now the Howard Watson Nature Trail) and a Parclo B4 interchange with the newly twinned Highway 40 just north of the 1964 interchange. Construction east of Highway 40 began in 1972.

Under two construction contracts, construction of of Highway 402 began near Highway 7 in 1974.
A third contract to bridge the gap between that project and Sarnia was awarded in 1975.
On October 13, 1978, Highway 402 was opened to traffic between Highway 40 and Highway 21.
By the end of that year, construction was progressing on the section between Highway 21 and Highway 81 near Strathroy, as well as on the section connecting Highway 2 with Highway 401.
The section between Highway 21 and Highway 81 north of Strathroy was the next to be completed; it was opened to traffic on November 26, 1979.
On November 17, 1981, the section between London and Delaware was completed, including the interchange at Highway 401. It forced westbound drivers to exit at Longwoods Road (Highway 2). Construction was already underway on the final section between Strathroy and Delaware at this point.

The opening of the section between Highways 2 and 81 completed Highway 402 from London to the Blue Water Bridge. In addition, the removal of the Front Street intersection in Sarnia made the entire route a controlled-access highway. Both were completed in time for the official opening in Sarnia on November 10, 1982.

=== Since completion ===
In 1997, noise barriers were erected upon both sides of the highway between Colborne Road to just east of the Howard Watson Trail. At the Indian Road interchange, the directional ramp in the NW quadrant was removed and replaced with a signalized left turn for the NE quadrant loop ramp, enabling a continuous noise barrier to be placed in place of the former directional ramp. However, the Sarnia-Lambton Chamber of Commerce was concerned that the new noise barriers would cause travelers to overlook the city. A partnership was formed between the municipality and the Ontario Ministry of Transportation to make additional aesthetic improvements to the highway corridor within the city that would be funded by the community, including a &quot;City of Sarnia&quot; landscaped sign that was completed in 2001.

In 2007, the southern part of the Front Street interchange was realigned. It was originally a parclo AB2 (folded diamond) configuration when it opened in 1982, since Highway 402 needed to cross a railway as well as Front Street; however the railway has since been removed by the 1990s allowing a new on-ramp to Highway 402 eastbound to be built in the SE quadrant. For the overpass carrying eastbound highway traffic, the acceleration lane which previously served the now-removed loop ramp in the SW quadrant was instead allocated to a new on-ramp from the Canada Border Services Agency secondary inspection; previously transport trucks exiting the customs plaza had to make a right-turn from Marina Road to the highway which caused considerable congestion.

On Monday, December 13, 2010, a whiteout caused by lake-effect snow squalls left an stretch of Highway 402 closed for several days.
Lambton County officials declared a state of emergency. Although the entire distance between Sarnia and London is subject to occasional snow squalls and whiteout conditions, they usually dissipate or move in less than a day. The exceptional conditions at that time were caused by a snow squall which remained stationary over several days, dropping up to two metres (6 ft) of snow in some parts of the area. Defence Minister Peter MacKay sent two Canadian Forces Griffon helicopters and a C-130 Hercules to Sarnia to aid in the search-and-rescue efforts.
The hospitality of locals in providing shelter for stranded motorists was the primary focus of local media coverage.
The highway was reopened to traffic on the morning of December 16.
A single death was reported; a man succumbed to hypothermia on a nearby county road.

Highway 402 was widened in the Sarnia area from four to six lanes due to extensive traffic backups from the bridge crossing towards the USA; the westbound lanes were widened by two lanes, while eastbound capacity remains unchanged. The new four-lane roadway is divided into specific lanes for cars, trucks, local traffic, and NEXUS card holders.
The new lanes begin just before the Murphy Road overpass with a local lane breaking away for interchange access; all travellers wishing to exit the highway from this point must be travelling in this lane.
Construction began August 4, 2009,
between the Blue Water Bridge and Lambton County Road 26 (Mandaumin Road) and included the widening of the Colborne Road and Front Street underpasses, plus a new Christina Street bridge with a signalized intersection allowing full exit/entry to the westbound lanes. Work was completed by the end of 2012. Between 2004 and 2013, the speed limit along the westbound lanes from Airport Road westward was reduced from the standard . However, following the reconstruction, the speed limit was raised between Indian Road and Airport Road on June 20, 2013.

On January 5, 2013, a temporary vehicular roadblock was created at the Blue Water Bridge as part of the &quot;Idle No More&quot; protests by First Nations groups. The blockade was known in advance and was planned to occur during the noon hour. Lambton OPP monitored the protest by walking alongside the protesters. Traffic resumed flowing normally by 1:30 p.m. While Highway 402 itself was not closed, the protest did back up traffic onto the highway causing congestion in the areas of Front Street and Christina Street.
Later that year, another protest was held west of Strathroy on October 19, advocating against wind turbine construction. The rolling protest of about 150 vehicles, including farm equipment, was monitored by the OPP and required intermittent ramp closures to the westbound lanes.

On November 23, 2015, the Indian Road overpass was damaged by a flatbed trailer carrying an over-height load. The eastbound lanes of the highway were closed for 60 hours, while the girders damaged in the impact had to be removed, while the overpass reopened for Indian Road traffic which was reduced to two lanes for the next few months. The overpass was repaired by May 2016 at a cost of $554,000 (overall damage of $3 million). The trucking company, under the Highway Traffic Act, was held liable and had to compensate the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario for the repair costs.

<doc id="1243625" wikidata="Q1792838" url="?curid=1243625" title="Waterloo Sunset">
<text>&quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; is a song by English rock band the Kinks. It was released as a single on 5 May1967 and featured on the album &quot;Something Else by the Kinks&quot; later that year. Written and produced by Kinks frontman Ray Davies, &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; is one of the band&#x27;s best-known and most acclaimed songs, and was ranked number 14 on the 2021 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. It was also their first single that was available in true stereo.

&quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; reached number 2 on the British charts in mid-1967. It was a top 10 hit in Australia, New Zealand and most of Europe. It was also released as a single in North America, but failed to chart there.

==History==

Interviewed in May 1967, Ray Davies stated that he wrote &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; having had &quot;the actual melody line in my head for two or three years&quot;. He initially titled the song &quot;Liverpool Sunset&quot;, but scrapped the Liverpool theme after the release of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Penny Lane&quot;.

The lyrics describe a solitary narrator watching (or imagining) two lovers passing over a bridge, with the observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames, and Waterloo station. Speaking in 2010, Davies commented &quot;I didn&#x27;t think to make it about Waterloo, initially, but I realised the place was so very significant in my life. I was in St Thomas&#x27; Hospital when I was really ill [when he had a tracheotomy aged 13] and the nurses would wheel me out on the balcony to look at the river. It was also about being taken down to the 1951 Festival of Britain. It&#x27;s about the two characters – and the aspirations of my sisters&#x27; generation who grew up during the Second World War. It&#x27;s about the world I wanted them to have. That, and then walking by the Thames with my first wife and all the dreams that we had.&quot; The two lovers in the lyric are named as Terry and Julie. Interviewed in May 1967, Davies stated in 1967 that &quot;if you look at the song as a kind of film, I suppose Terry would be Terence Stamp and Julie would be Julie Christie&quot;, referring to the popular British film actors romantically linked at the time. Latterly, Davies has refuted this connection; in 2008, he described the song as &quot;a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world&quot;, referring to Rosy Davies, who moved to Australia in 1964.

The song was the first Kinks recording produced solely by Ray Davies, without longtime producer Shel Talmy; Talmy&#x27;s contract with the band had expired in spring 1967. Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; lasted ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: &quot;We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we&#x27;d got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.&quot;

== &quot;Act Nice and Gentle&quot; ==
The B-side &quot;Act Nice and Gentle&quot; was exclusive to this single, and has been described as a plea for &quot;some civility&quot;. It has a &quot;country-western influence&quot; that foreshadowed &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot;, and later appeared on album as a bonus track with the 1998 reissue of &quot;Something Else by the Kinks&quot;.

==Legacy and accolades==

In Britain, the song is commonly considered to be Davies&#x27; most famous work, and it has been &quot;regarded by many as the apogee of the swinging sixties&quot;. Highly esteemed for its musical and lyrical qualities, the song is commonly the subject of study in university arts courses. Davies largely dismisses such praise and has even suggested that he would like to go back and alter some of the lyrics; most professionals, however, generally side with the observation of Ken Garner, a lecturer at Caledonian University in Glasgow, who said: &quot;Davies, like all the best singer-songwriters, is intensely self-critical.&quot;

Pop music journalist Robert Christgau has called the song &quot;the most beautiful song in the English language&quot;. Pete Townshend of the Who has called it &quot;divine&quot; and &quot;a masterpiece&quot;. In 1972, &quot;Record World&quot; said that it &quot;may be the best thing [the Kinks have] ever done.&quot; Damon Albarn was similarly effusive, naming it the one song he wished he had written, and commenting that &quot;It&#x27;s the most perfect song I could ever hope to write, with my sort of voice.&quot; AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine concurred, citing it as &quot;possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine placed the song at number 42 on their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, and was re-ranked at number 14 on the 2021 list. Ray Davies performed &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics. A subsequent reissue of the Kinks&#x27; original single entered the UK charts at #47.

* In the 1979 Barrie Keeffe &quot;Play for Today&quot;, &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;, directed by Richard Eyre, the song is performed at the piano by Queenie Watts at the start of the play.
* In Bob Geldof&#x27;s 1986 first solo album, Deep In the Heart of Nowhere, his song Love Like a Rocket is a cynical updating of the couple in the song. It begins &quot;Terry still meets Julie every Friday night down Waterloo underground&quot; but then describes how their relationship has deteriorated over time.
* In her 2000 novel, &quot;White Teeth&quot;, Zadie Smith references a central character fantasising herself &quot;demanding &#x27;Waterloo Sunset&#x27; be played at [her boyfriend&#x27;s] funeral.&quot;

* In the second season of the Netflix show &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;, the song is heard twice—in one episode as background music and in another episode with one of the characters, Looka, singing part of it.
* Plays during the closing credits of the movie &quot;BlackBerry&quot;.

==Cathy Dennis version==
British singer-songwriter Cathy Dennis recorded a version of the song that was released as the second single from her 1997 album, &quot;Am I the Kinda Girl?&quot;. Her version peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart and number seven in Iceland. Both versions of the CD single feature a cover of another Kinks song: &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot;.

===Critical reception===
British magazine &quot;Music Week&quot; rated Dennis&#x27; version three out of five. The reviewer wrote, &quot;The approval of Ray Davies — who appears in the video — will help the cause of this cover which captures the atmosphere and laziness of The Kinks&#x27; original. This could be the hit to kick off the album &quot;Am I The Kinda Girl?&quot;.&quot; In a 1997 review, the magazine gave it two out of five, adding, &quot;Ray Davies&#x27;s song is given an unremarkable treatment by the former dance chanteuse, but television exposure should help this reach the Top 40.&quot;

===Music video===
The accompanying music video for &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; consists of Dennis singing the song whilst travelling alone in a taxi driven by Ray Davies in a cameo role. The scenes visible outside the taxi windows vary between the London of the 1990s and film of various locations (e.g. driving up Piccadilly with Green Park tube station on the left, Knightsbridge tube station and the small dome north of Finsbury Square) as they were in the 1960s.

<doc id="1243627" wikidata="Q7440901" url="?curid=1243627" title="Sean Conway">
<text>Sean Conway (born July 24, 1951) is a former provincial politician in Ontario, Canada and a university professor. He served for 28 years as a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 2003 and was a high-profile cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson.

After positions as a Fellow in the School of Policy Studies at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, a special assistant to the Principal of Queen&#x27;s University, Daniel Woolf, and the Acting Vice-Principal (Advancement) at Queen&#x27;s, Conway is currently an instructor at St. Michael&#x27;s College at the University of Toronto and a Distinguished Research Fellow in the Centre for Urban Energy at Ryerson University.

==Background==

Conway attended St Joseph&#x27;s Separate School and Madawaska Valley District High School. He earned his Bachelor of Arts at Waterloo Lutheran University (now Wilfrid Laurier University), and his Masters at Queen&#x27;s University, both in history. His grandfather, Thomas Patrick Murray, represented Renfrew South for the Liberals from 1929 to 1945.

==Politics==
In the provincial election of 1975, at age twenty-four, Conway was elected as a Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the eastern Ontario riding of Renfrew North. He defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Bob Cotnam by 183 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won a minority government in the election, and Conway sat with his party in the opposition benches.

The Liberals increased their parliamentary representation in the 1977 election, although not by enough to form government; Conway was re-elected over Cotnam by an increased margin. He became his party&#x27;s official Critic for Health following the election and served in this capacity for the entirety of the four-year minority parliament which followed.

The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in the 1981 provincial election, although Conway was popular enough in his riding to be re-elected by about 2,000 votes. On March 9, 1982, he was chosen as Deputy Leader of the Ontario Liberal Party by David Peterson, who had defeated Sheila Copps in a leadership convention the previous month.

===In government===
The provincial election of 1985 resulted in a minority parliament, with the Progressive Conservatives having only four more seats than the Liberals and the New Democratic Party holding the balance of power with twenty-five seats. Conway, by this time regarded as being on the progressive wing of his party, was involved in the Liberal Party&#x27;s post-election negotiations with the NDP. In this capacity, he helped bring about a written pact, in which the NDP offered support to the Liberals for two years in return for certain progressive legislative initiatives. On June 26, 1985, he was named as the province&#x27;s Minister of Education.

Conway&#x27;s most controversial responsibility as Education Minister was managing the government&#x27;s legislation for full funding to Ontario&#x27;s Roman Catholic separate schools. Conway&#x27;s grandfather, Thomas Murray, had championed a similar initiative in the 1930s and was disappointed when Mitchell Hepburn backed away from a previous commitment in the face of Protestant opposition. Conway had supported the announcement of full funding by Bill Davis&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government prior to the 1985 election and was responsible for significantly increasing the actual revenues to the Catholic system after a mathematical error in the Davis government&#x27;s funding formula came to light. He also guaranteed hiring rights for non-Catholics within the system and exempted non-Catholic children from compulsory religious education in separate high schools.

On June 17, 1986, Conway was also named Acting Ontario Minister of Government Services, a position which he held until the dissolution of parliament in 1987. He was re-elected by a landslide in the 1987 provincial election, in which the Liberals won 95 of 130 seats. On September 29, 1987, he was named Government Government House Leader and Minister of Mines. Following a cabinet shuffle on August 2, 1989, he was again named Minister of Education, and also held the portfolios of Minister of Skills Development and Minister of Colleges and Universities.

====Cabinet positions====



===In opposition===
Like many others in the Peterson government, Conway opposed holding an early election in 1990 (in fact, he would later reveal that sentiment in the party caucus was almost uniformly against an early trip to the polls). Nonetheless, Peterson called a snap provincial election in 1990, and his party was resoundingly defeated by the NDP. Conway himself was re-elected in a landslide in Renfrew North, where the NDP has a very limited base of historical support.
 On September 17, 1991, he was chosen as Deputy Leader of the Official Opposition. Conway did not contest the Liberal leadership in 1992.

The Progressive Conservatives under Mike Harris returned to government in the 1995 provincial election with a large majority. Despite the Tories&#x27; sweep of much of the province, Conway was re-elected in Renfrew North.

Conway supported Dwight Duncan&#x27;s bid to succeed Lyn McLeod as party leader in 1996; Duncan finished fourth against Dalton McGuinty. Conway continued to serve as Deputy Opposition Leader until December 19, 1996, when he was replaced with Joseph Cordiano. In the 1999 election, he defeated an incumbent MPP, Tory Leo Jordan, in the redistributed riding of Renfrew--Nipissing--Pembroke. With the retirement of Bud Wildman in 1999, Conway became the longest-serving member of the legislature.

Having spent more than half his life as an MPP, Conway decided to retire before the 2003 provincial election.

==After politics==
He is currently a member of TV Ontario&#x27;s political discussion panel, a public policy advisor with Gowling Lafleur Henderson LLP, an instructor at St. Michael&#x27;s College at the University of Toronto and a Distinguished Research Fellow in the Centre for Urban Energy at Ryerson University.

On November 20, 2008, Conway was appointed as Acting Vice-Principal (Advancement) at Queen&#x27;s.

In November 2007, Conway was honoured with the prestigious Churchill Society Award for Excellence in the Cause of Parliamentary Democracy. Previous recipients include former Prime Ministers, Cabinet Ministers, Premiers and Lieutenant Governors.

Conway offered significant assistance to former Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, in the project to publish Martin&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;Hell Or High Water: My Life In And Out of Politics&quot;, which appeared in late 2008. Conway performed many interviews for the National Archives of Canada, which were also utilized for the book.

Conway endorsed Sandra Pupatello in the 2013 Ontario Liberal Party leadership election.

<text>The Command key (sometimes abbreviated as Cmd key), , formerly also known as the Apple key or open Apple key, is a modifier key present on Apple keyboards. The Command key&#x27;s purpose is to allow the user to enter keyboard commands in applications and in the system. An &quot;extended&quot; Macintosh keyboard—the most common type—has two command keys, one on each side of the space bar; some compact keyboards have one only on the left.

The symbol (the &quot;looped square&quot;) was chosen by Susan Kare after Steve Jobs decided that the use of the Apple logo in the menu system (where the keyboard shortcuts are displayed) would be an over-use of the logo. Apple&#x27;s adaptation of the symbol—encoded in Unicode at U+2318—was derived in part from its use in Nordic countries as an indicator of cultural locations and places of interest. The symbol is known by various other names, including &quot;Saint John&#x27;s Arms&quot; and &quot;Bowen knot&quot;.

== History ==
Apple&#x27;s computers up through the 1979 Apple II Plus did not have a command key. The first model on which it appeared was the 1980 Apple III, where there are two monochrome Apple keys, both to the left of the space bar on the lowest row of the keyboard. Two other early Apple computers, the 1982 Apple IIe and the 1984 Apple IIc, also had two such keys, one to the left and one to the right of the space bar; in these models, they mapped to the first two fire buttons of an attached joystick. This allowed for flexible combinations of a modifier key and base key (such as Open-Apple with C for Copy) with just a few extra wires and no ROM changes, since the Apple II could only register one key press at a time (Shift and Control keys were handled in the keyboard encoding hardware which generated ASCII codes). In all these cases, the left Apple key had an outlined &quot;open&quot; Apple logo, and the one on the right had an opaque, &quot;closed&quot; or &quot;solid&quot; Apple logo key. The Apple Lisa had only the closed Apple logo.

When the Macintosh was introduced in 1984, the keyboard had a single command key with a looped square symbol (⌘, U+2318), because Steve Jobs said that showing the Apple logo throughout the menus as a keyboard shortcut was &quot;taking [it] in vain&quot;. Thus, the ⌘ symbol appears in the Macintosh menus as the primary modifier key symbol. The original Macintosh also had an Option key, which was used primarily for entering extended characters.

In 1986, the Apple II was introduced. Like the newer Macintosh computers to come, such as the Macintosh SE, it used the Apple Desktop Bus for its keyboard and mouse. However, it was still an Apple II. Apple changed the keys on the II&#x27;s keyboard to Command and Option, as on Mac keyboards, but added an open-Apple to the Command key, for consistency with applications for previous Apple II generations. (The Option key did not have a closed-Apple, probably because Apple II applications used the closed-Apple key much more rarely than the open-Apple key; thus there was less need to keep it around.) Because any ADB keyboard could be used with the II, all of Apple&#x27;s ADB keyboards—even those intended for the Mac—also required the open-Apple, and it stuck for more than twenty years, causing confusion long after the Apple II series went out of production.

The Apple symbol was removed in the keyboard&#x27;s 2007 redesign, making room for the key&#x27;s name to appear—the word &quot;command&quot; is now printed on the key.

== NeXT ==
On the keyboard of the NeXT Computer that key was marked in green.

The menus were not marked with a symbol denoting the command key.

Besides being used as a modifier key for keyboard shortcuts it was also used to alter the function of some keys. toggles alpha lock, sends Enter and toggles Mute.

The functions were printed in green on the front side of the modified keys. This was also done on the Z, X, C and V keys (Undo, Cut, Copy and Paste).

(Left) -- triggers a non-catchable &quot;hardware&quot; reset thereby hard rebooting the computer. (Contrary to  on a PC compatible computer which triggers only a &quot;software&quot; reset.)

On the NeXT ADB keyboard, the Command keys were replaced by keys labeled and the Command key morphed into a wide &quot;Command bar&quot; in front of the space bar.

== Function ==
The purpose of the Command key is to allow the user to enter keyboard shortcuts in applications and in the system. The Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines have always recommended that developers use the Command key (and not the Control or Option keys) for this purpose. A small set of keyboard commands (such as cut and paste, open and save) are standard across nearly all applications, and many other commands are standardized (Find, Show Fonts). If an application needs more shortcuts than can be obtained with the twenty-six letters of the Latin alphabet, double modifiers such as Command+Option are used.

One advantage of this scheme, as contrasted with the Microsoft Windows mixed use of the Control and Alt keys, is that the Control key is available for its original purpose: entering control characters in terminal applications. (Indeed, the very first Macintosh lacked a Control key; it was soon added to allow compatible terminal software.)

The Macintosh keyboard&#x27;s other unusual modifier key, the Option key, serves as a modifier both for entering keyboard shortcuts and for typing text—it is used to enter foreign characters, typographical symbols, and other special characters.

== Origin of the symbol ==

The ⌘ symbol came into the Macintosh project at a late stage. The development team originally went for their old Apple key, but Steve Jobs found it frustrating when &quot;apples&quot; filled up the Mac&#x27;s menus next to the key commands, because he felt that this was an over-use of the company logo. He then opted for a different key symbol. With only a few days left before deadline, the team&#x27;s bitmap artist Susan Kare started researching for the Apple logo&#x27;s successor. She was browsing through a symbol dictionary when she came across the cloverleaf-like symbol, commonly used in Nordic countries as an indicator of cultural locations and places of interest (it is the official road sign for tourist attraction in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, and the computer key has often been called &#x27;—ancient monument—by Swedish Mac users and &#x27;—landmark signs—by Danish users). When she showed it to the rest of the team, everyone liked it, and so it became the symbol of the 1984 Macintosh command key. Susan Kare states that she has since been told that the symbol was picked for its Scandinavian usage due to its resembling the shape of a square castle with round corner towers as seen from above looking down, notably Borgholm Castle. However, the symbol is used in many places in Scandinavian history, for example on a 5th-century picture stone from Gotland, and first usage of the shape as a sign for a place of interest was suggested by the Finnish Local Heritage Federation in the 1950s.

The symbol was included in the original Macintosh font Chicago, and could be inserted by typing a key combination.

In Unicode and HTML it is encoded as .

== On other keyboards ==
On USB keyboards, the keys are mapped to standard keycodes reserved for GUI functions.

When using a Macintosh computer with a keyboard lacking keys, the keys used on Microsoft Windows oriented keyboards, or the keys used on Sun and other Unix keyboards, can be used in place of the Command keys. Conversely, when an Apple USB keyboard is used with other operating systems, the Command keys function as Windows keys or Meta keys.

On a Windows keyboard the position of the and keys are swapped compared to the position of and keys on an Apple keyboard. In macOS this can be configured in the keyboard preferences (Modifier Keys ...) so that the Windows key (next to the space bar) becomes the Mac key and vice versa so that users do not have to change their motor learning. All the modifier keys, along with the , can be remapped to whichever modifier key function the user wishes, so users of traditional Unix style keyboards may choose to use the key as a key or other modifier.

<doc id="1243635" wikidata="Q2644901" url="?curid=1243635" title="Alf Dubs, Baron Dubs">
<text>Alfred Dubs, Baron Dubs (born 5 December 1932) is a British Labour politician and former Member of Parliament.

== Early life and education ==
Alfred Dubs was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia to a Jewish father, Hubert and an Austrian mother, Bedriska. Hubert worked in the cotton industry, whilst Bedriska was a dietitian. Dubs was one of 669 Czech-resident, mainly Jewish, children saved by British stockbroker Nicholas Winton, and others, from the Nazis on the &quot;Kindertransport&quot; between March and September 1939. Hubert had fled to England the day the Nazis arrived in Czechoslovakia and met young Alf at Liverpool Street station. Alf later said that he clearly remembered leaving Prague station at age six and not touching the food pack given to him by his mother for the next two days. His mother was initially denied a visa but was able to join him and his father in London shortly afterwards.

Dubs learned the facts when Winton&#x27;s story was broadcast on &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; in 1988. He later met Winton in person and campaigned for him to be honoured. Winton was finally knighted in 2003, &quot;for services to humanity, in saving Jewish children from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, 1938–39&quot;.

Dubs was educated at Cheadle Hulme School and the London School of Economics. He then worked as a local government officer and for Ogilvy and Mather as an account executive before entering politics.

== Career ==

Before being elected for Battersea South, Dubs stood three times, due to closely spaced elections. In 1970 he stood for Cities of London and Westminster and was defeated by the Conservative candidate Christopher Tugendhat. In South Hertfordshire in the February and October 1974 general elections, he was beaten by the incumbent Conservative MP Cecil Parkinson.

Dubs was elected in the 1979 general election as a member of parliament for Battersea South and for the next parliament was re-elected – in 1983 for Battersea (a restored seat). He lost the election of 1987 for the same seat. Dubs stood for Battersea again at the 1992 election, only to see the Conservative majority increase, against the national trend. From 1988 to 1995, he was director of the Refugee Council. On 27 September 1994, he was appointed as a Labour life peer with the title of Baron Dubs, &quot;of Battersea in the London Borough of Wandsworth&quot;. He was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office from May 1997 to December 1999.

While Dubs was still in the House of Commons, John O&#x27;Farrell worked in his office and was a Labour activist in Battersea. In his book, &quot;Things Can Only Get Better&quot;, O&#x27;Farrell described the events leading up to Dubs&#x27;s shock defeat by the Conservative John Bowis at the 1987 general election. 

Dubs has served on an area health authority and more recently on a mental health trust. He was chair of the Broadcasting Standards Commission until December 2003 and had previously been deputy chair of the Independent Television Commission. He is a trustee of the Open University Foundation.

In the past, he has been a local councillor, chair of the Fabian Society, chair of Liberty, a trustee of Action Aid, a trustee of the Immigration Advisory Service and of a number of other voluntary organisations.

Dubs is a patron of Humanists UK, formerly known as the British Humanist Association, patron of Refugee Support Group based in Berkshire, as well as treasurer of the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group.

In 2008, Dubs participated in 42 House of Lords debates, well above average for all peers. He has spoken on many varied subjects including the National Probation Service and road safety. Dubs was chair of the Road Safety Foundation.
Dubs lists his main home as a cottage in the Lake District in Cumbria, which enabled him to claim over £26,000 of overnight subsistence expenses in 2007–08, although he has lived in Notting Hill, London, since 1964. In May 2009, he argued in justification that Lords regard the overnight allowance as a payment instead of salary. &quot;We are the only legislators in the world that don&#x27;t get paid,&quot; he said. &quot;The overnight thing is quite generous because it compensates for not having a salary. In practice that&#x27;s how it works.&quot;

Dubs is a vice-president of the Debating Group.

Dubs was awarded Humanist of the Year 2016 by the British Humanist Association at an awards ceremony in London and an Honorary Silver Medal of Jan Masaryk at the Czech Republic Ambassador&#x27;s residence in London in November 2019. In 2021, he had his Czech citizenship restored (alongside his British one) and thus became the first Czech-British member of the House of Lords.

During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, Dubs was among a number of Humanists UK patrons to contribute morale-boosting messages of resilience, hope, and inspiration on National Prison Radio.

=== Dubs amendment ===
In 2016, Lord Dubs tabled what became section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016 by which UK local authorities admitted unaccompanied minors housed in EU refugee camps who are mainly asylum seekers. It responded to the European migrant crisis. Originally rejected by the House of Commons, the provision was accepted by the government following a second debate and vote in favour by the Lords. In February 2017, the Home Office removed this as a type of permission to enter, in the light of other new provisions targeted at family reunion, after accepting 350 of the 3,000 whom analysts expected it would apply to.

A new amendment was proposed by Lord Dubs in January 2020, to require the UK government to negotiate an agreement with the EU to ensure that unaccompanied children in Europe could continue to come to the UK to join a close relative, who was in the process of seeking refugee status, as part of the law effecting the Withdrawal Agreement. The amendment was supported by the House of Lords, but was rejected by the House of Commons due to the Government opposing it. It would expand the laissez-passer system of Restoring Family Links for settled refugees, in line with latest European Union practice. It would also expand the vulnerable person resettlement and vulnerable children resettlement schemes which began in 2016.

<text>Eurogliders are a band formed in 1980 in Perth, Western Australia, which included Grace Knight on vocals, Bernie Lynch on guitar and vocals, and Amanda Vincent on keyboards. In 1984, Eurogliders released an Australian top ten album, &quot;This Island&quot;, which spawned their No. 2 hit single, &quot;Heaven (Must Be There)&quot;. &quot;Heaven&quot; also peaked at No. 21 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock charts and appeared on the Hot 100. Another Australian top ten album, &quot;Absolutely&quot;, followed in 1985, which provided two further local top ten singles, &quot;We Will Together&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait to See You&quot;. They disbanded in 1989, with Knight having a successful career as a jazz singer. Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane described Eurogliders as &quot;the accessible face of post-punk new wave music. The band&#x27;s sophisticated brand of pop was traditional in its structure, but displayed the decidedly &#x27;modern veneer&#x27; (hip clothes, heavy use of synthesiser)&quot;. The band reformed in 2005 releasing two new albums followed in 2014 by their seventh album.

==History==

===Early days (1980–1982)===

Guitarist and singer Bernie Lynch (as Rip Torn) fronted a new wave band, The Stockings, in Perth, Western Australia in the late 1970s. He left in early 1980 to form Living Single, with keyboard player Amanda Vincent. Together, they recruited Crispin Akerman on guitar, Don Meharry on bass guitar and Guy Slingerland on drums through a series of advertisements. The following year, Grace Knight – Lynch&#x27;s future domestic partner – joined as lead vocalist. By the end of 1981, drummer John Bennetts replaced Slingerland and the band changed their name to Eurogliders. They were signed by manager, Brian Peacock, to their first recording and publishing contracts with PolyGram. They recruited Melbourne bass player Geoff Rosenberg to replace Meharry. In 1982, Eurogliders travelled to Manila, capital of the Philippines, to record their first album, &quot;Pink Suit Blue Day&quot;, produced by Englishman Lem Lubin, which did not peak into the top 50 of the Australian Kent Music Report albums chart. From Manila, they relocated to Sydney to release their first single in June, &quot;Without You&quot;, which peaked into the top 40 on the Kent Music Report singles chart.

===International success (1983–1985)===

Eurogliders changed record labels from Polygram to CBS in 1983. They replaced bass guitarist, Rosenberg, with Scott Saunders and travelled to the UK in July. While there, they recruited bass guitarist Ron François, formerly of The Sinceros, The Teardrop Explodes and Lene Lovich. With this line-up they recorded &quot;This Island&quot;, produced by Nigel Gray (also worked with the Police) which was released in May and peaked at No. 4 on the Australian albums chart. The single, &quot;Heaven (Must Be There)&quot;, also released in May, reached No. 2 on the Australian singles charts. Released several months later in North America, the single peaked at No. 47 in Canada, and at No. 65 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The album peaked at No. 140 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In Australia, &quot;Heaven&quot; was followed by a domino effect of two more top 10 hits, with &quot;We Will Together&quot; (No. 7, April 1985), and &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait to See You&quot; (No. 8, November 1985). Their third album &quot;Absolutely&quot;, which peaked at No. 7, spent 47 weeks in the Australian charts. Between 1984 and 1986, Eurogliders toured Australia, the USA, Canada, Puerto Rico, Japan and New Zealand.

At the height of the band&#x27;s success, Grace Knight and Bernie Lynch reconciled their relationship and were married in 1985 but the union was short-lived. Despite their marital separation, they stayed together in the band for another four years. Lynch and Knight dismissed Brian Peacock, and took over the band&#x27;s management.

===Demise (1986–1989)===

In early 1987, journalists documented Lynch and Knight&#x27;s claim that Bennetts, François and Vincent left the band voluntarily. Vincent went to London on a world tour with the Thompson Twins, and stayed in the UK to tour and co-wrote with Boy George. François became a session musician in Australia, while Bennets toured with Eartha Kitt, and later worked in the Educational IT industry before founding Monkeydrum Studios.

Reduced to a duo, Lynch and Knight recorded their fourth album (&quot;Groove&quot;) with session musicians, including Akerman. However, despite Akerman&#x27;s presence on the album it was clear that Lynch and Knight by themselves were now the Eurogliders, as they were the only people pictured on the album cover or inner sleeve, or on any of the album&#x27;s associated singles.

&quot;Groove&quot; peaked at No. 25 on the Australian charts in April 1988. The related single, &quot;Groove&quot; had peaked at No. 13 in February but the next singles, &quot;It Must Be Love&quot; in June, &quot;Listen&quot; in September and &quot;Precious&quot; in March 1989 did not reach the top 50.

For the album tour, Lynch, Knight and Akerman were joined by Guy Le Claire on guitar, Rex Goh on guitar (ex-Air Supply), Lindsay Jehan on bass guitar and Steve Sowerby on drums. Later in 1989, the Eurogliders disbanded. Akerman returned to his visual art background and became a painter, Lynch initially pursued a solo music career; while Knight became a successful jazz singer.

===Post-Eurogliders (1990–2005)===
After Eurogliders, Knight made a cameo appearance in the 1990 TV series &quot;Come In Spinner&quot; and sang on its soundtrack, &quot;Come In Spinner&quot;, recorded with jazz artist Vince Jones, which peaked at No. 4 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) albums charts. This launched a new career for Knight as a jazz singer with her first solo album, &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, which peaked at No. 16 in 1991. Lynch became involved in theatre and soundtrack composition, and as the business manager of his second wife, fashion designer Collette Dinnigan. Vincent, who had a successful popular music career with credits including Boy George, Gang of Four and Billy Bragg, moved into ethnomusicology, specialising in African and Cuban music.

===Reformations===

Eurogliders reformed in October 2005, with Grace Knight and Bernie Lynch using session musicians including former member, Rex Goh, and they released their fifth studio album, simply called &quot;Eurogliders&quot; and included the single, &quot;Hummingbird&quot;, but neither album nor single peaked into the ARIA top 50 charts. They started touring again in April 2006 and performed on the Countdown Spectacular during June to August, which was a nostalgic tour of Australian bands from the 1970s and 1980s, as featured on the pop television show &quot;Countdown&quot; with its host Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum. The group&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Blue Kiss&quot;, was recorded during the same sessions as the previous and was released in mid-2006, it also had no top 50 charting. Eurogliders official website was shut down in September 2008. In 2013 it was announced that the Eurogliders were expected to reform to support The Boomtown Rats on a planned reunion tour of Australia in May. However, the tour was cancelled due to poor ticket sales. Their seventh studio album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Eat the Daisies&quot;, appeared in 2014. In May 2017 they headlined the entertainment on Darley Kingsford-Smith Cup Day during the Brisbane Winter Racing Carnival. Eurogliders plan to tour Australia in support of Simple Minds and OMD in December 2021.

<text>Grey Court School is a mixed-sex high school academy in Ham, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. In September 2014, a new sixth form centre opened for Grey Court&#x27;s founding sixth form students.

The school occupies a large acreage in Ham, with playing fields and tennis courts. The school&#x27;s current head teacher is Christopher Rhodes.

==Performance==
As with other schools, latest exam results and related data are published in the Department for Education&#x27;s national tables.

==History==

The school was opened in 1956 to provide education for the children of the newly constructed estate. The school was built in the grounds of the Georgian Grey Court House from which it took its name. The house itself was renamed Newman House after Cardinal Newman, who lived there as a child in the early 19th century.

In 2013, and again in 2018, the school was rated outstanding by Ofsted, having previously been satisfactory. The sixth form was included in Ofsted&#x27;s 2018 inspection.

In March 2018, the sixth form building was named &#x27;The True Building&#x27; after Lord True, Conservative politician and former Leader of Richmond upon Thames Council.

<doc id="1243653" wikidata="Q10101" url="?curid=1243653" title="Picabo Street">
<text>Picabo Street (; born April 3, 1971) is an American former World Cup alpine ski racer and Olympic gold medalist. She won the super G at the 1998 Winter Olympics and the downhill at the 1996 World Championships, along with three other Olympic and World Championship medals. Street also won World Cup downhill season titles in 1995 and 1996, the first American woman to do so, along with nine World Cup downhill race wins. Street was inducted into the National Ski Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Early life==
Street was born at home in Triumph, Idaho; her parents are Dee (a music teacher) and Roland &quot;Stubby&quot; Street (a stonemason). Her brother Roland, Jr. is one year older. Her parents decided to let Picabo choose her own name when she was old enough, so for the first two years of her life she was called &quot;baby girl&quot; or &quot;little girl&quot;. At age three she was required to have a name in order to get a passport. She was named after the nearby village of Picabo. She was raised on a small farm in Triumph, several miles southeast of Sun Valley, where she learned to ski and race.

She attended Rowland Hall-St. Mark&#x27;s School in Salt Lake City, Utah, and participated in its Rowmark Ski Academy for one year before returning to Sun Valley to race for the Sun Valley Ski Education Foundation. Before joining the academy, she was a member of the local Hailey Ski Team.

==Skiing career==
Street joined the U.S. Ski Team in 1989 at the age of 17. She primarily competed in the speed events of downhill and super G, with her World Cup debut at age 21 in a slalom on December 6 1992. Two months later at the 1993 World Championships in Japan she won the silver medal in the combined event.

===1994–1996===
After her silver medal performance in the downhill at the 1994 Winter Olympics, a run was named after her at Sun Valley, on the Warm Springs side of Bald Mountain; the expert run formerly known as &quot;Plaza&quot; became &quot;Picabo&#x27;s Street.&quot; Street joined Christin Cooper and Gretchen Fraser as Sun Valley Olympic medalists (their named runs are on Seattle Ridge).

By winning the 1995 downhill title, she became the first American to win a World Cup season title in a speed event. She repeated as downhill champion the following season, adding the title of world champion with her gold medal at the 1996 World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.

===1997–2002===
While training in Colorado in early December 1996, Street suffered an ACL injury to her left knee and missed the remainder of the 1997 season. A month after her gold medal win in the super G at the 1998 Winter Olympics, she careened off course at the final downhill of the 1998 season at Crans-Montana, Switzerland. Street crashed, snapping her left femur and tearing the ACL in her right knee. She was in rehabilitation for two years following the accident.

Street returned to ski racing in late 2000, and retired from international competition after the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah, where she finished sixteenth in the downhill.

==Commercial endeavors==
Street appeared on the TV shows &quot;Nickelodeon GUTS&quot; in 1994, and &quot;Pyramid&quot; (2002). She performed well on the show &quot;American Gladiators&quot;, where Street used her strength to defeat the gladiator character &quot;Ice&quot; in a couple of events.

In the late 1990s, after her success at the 1998 Winter Olympics, Street became a spokeswoman for a variety of products, including the soft drink Mountain Dew and ChapStick-brand lip balm.

In 1998 she signed with Giro Sport Design which was then developing its first winter sports helmet. In August she toured the company&#x27;s headquarters/manufacturing facility, then located in Santa Cruz, CA. She spoke with the senior manufacturing engineer, a long-time skier himself, about the progression of equipment, signing a prototype helmet for him as she left. She also appeared on &quot;Celebrity Paranormal Project&quot;.

She wrote an autobiography in 2001 titled &quot;Picabo: Nothing to Hide&quot; (). In it, Street revealed the pressure placed on her by her sponsors to succeed and win, which she maintains contributed to her devastating 1998 crash. She also described how she was able to transform from a rebellious tomboy into a world-class athlete.

A feature film based on Street&#x27;s life story was in development as of late 2009, written by Eric Preston with director Charles Winkler slated to direct, and produced by Jeff Luini and Richard Weiner. Filming was slated begin in 2010 in Argentina.

She appeared in two skits on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; with the character Elmo and Telly. In one, Telly was looking for a place called Peekaboo Street and met the real Picabo Street; in the other, Elmo insisted on introducing Picabo because he thought she was a world champion peek-a-boo player. Her name also appeared in the song &quot;One Big Mob&quot; by the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Street was the runner up (with a time of 5:37) in the NBC celebrity reality competition series &quot;Stars Earn Stripes&quot;.

==Personal life==
Street is retired and splits her time between homes in Alabama and Winter Park, Colorado. She has a son born in August 2004, with her former partner N. J. Pawley. On October 25, 2008, she married businessman John Reeser atop Prospect Mountain, near Hanceville, Alabama. On August 3, 2009, Street gave birth to her second son.

On ESPN&#x27;s &quot;College Game Day&quot; in Boise on September 25, 2010, Street stated that she was pregnant and expecting her third boy.

Street named her skis for people who were strong and meaningful to her. Among them are her &quot;Earnies&quot; (after Dale Earnhardt) and her &quot;Arnolds&quot; (after Arnold Schwarzenegger).

In the early 2000s, an internet joke spread which claimed Street made a &quot;substantial donation&quot; to her hometown hospital, which named a wing after her, the &quot;Picabo ICU&quot; (as in &quot;Peekaboo! I see you!&quot;). Another version claimed she became an ICU nurse and would answer the phone by saying, &quot;Picabo, ICU!&quot; A less common variant claimed a fan feared Street would be injured and appear in a headline reading, &quot;Picabo? ICU.&quot; All three variants of the joke were debunked by Snopes.

<text>Phyllis Webb (April 8, 1927 – November 11, 2021) was a Canadian poet and broadcaster.

Webb&#x27;s poetry had diverse influences, ranging from neo-Confucianism to the field theory of composition developed by the Black Mountain poets. Critics have described her collections &quot;Naked Poems&quot; (1965) and &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Bowl&quot; (1980) as important works in contemporary Canadian literature.

As a broadcaster at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in the 1960s, Webb created programs including &quot;Ideas&quot; and &quot;Extension&quot;, a television program about Canadian poetry. She left the CBC in 1967 to return to British Columbia, where she remained for much of her life.

==Early life and education==
Phyllis Webb was born on April 8, 1927, in Victoria, British Columbia. She attended the University of British Columbia, where she received a BA in English and philosophy in 1949, and McGill University. In 1949, aged 22, she ran as a candidate for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in the 1949 British Columbia general election. In 1957 Webb won a grant that allowed her to study theatre in France.

== Poetry ==
Webb&#x27;s first poems were published in &quot;Contemporary Verse&quot;, a magazine run by Alan Crawley. Her first book publication was in &quot;Trio&quot;, a collection of poems by Eli Mandel, Gael Turnbull, and Webb published by Raymond Souster&#x27;s Contact Press. In the 1950s, Webb became interested in Eastern philosophy; critic Pauline Butling suggests that Webb&#x27;s early work shows the influence of neo-Confucianism&#x27;s metaphysics of time.

Webb&#x27;s approach shifted in the 1960s toward a model of poetry influenced by the field theory of composition developed by Charles Olson and the Black Mountain poets. The field theory was a jumping-off point for &quot;Naked Poems&quot;, which she started in 1963 and published in 1965. George Bowering describes &quot;Naked Poems&quot; as a &quot;key text in contemporary Canadian literature&quot;. &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Bowl&quot; (1980) adopts a new poetics centred on a critique of political and interpersonal power, drawing from Haida stories &quot;to undermine the binary structures of Western thought&quot;. Critic Northrop Frye called it a &quot;landmark&quot;. Webb composed the poems in &quot;Hanging Fire&quot; (1990) by waiting for words to arrive in her mind. She said in an interview that adopting this passive stance allowed her to focus more on the external world. 

Webb taught creative writing at the University of British Columbia, the University of Victoria, and the Banff Centre, and was writer-in-residence at the University of Alberta from 1980 to 1981.

Webb&#x27;s poems often concern death, particularly suicide.

== Broadcasting ==
Beginning in 1964, Webb worked as a writer and broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In 1965 she created, with William A. Young, the radio program &quot;Ideas&quot;. From 1967 to 1969, Webb was its executive producer. In 1967, she travelled to the Soviet Union, carrying out research on the anarchist Peter Kropotkin; she later proposed, but did not complete, a cycle of poems called &quot;The Kropotkin Poems&quot;. Also in 1967, Webb created the CBC television program &quot;Extension&quot;, a series about Canadian poetry. 

==Honours==
In 1980 Webb was awarded a prize of CA$2,300 by fellow Canadian poets in recognition of her book &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Bowl&quot;, which was overlooked for a Governor General&#x27;s Award nomination that year. The award citation stated, in part, &quot;this gesture is a response to your whole body of work as well as to your presence as a touchstone of true good writing in Canada, which we all know is beyond awards and prizes&quot;.

Webb won the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for Poetry, 1982, for &quot;The Vision Tree&quot;.

She won Canada Council awards in 1981 and 1987.

She became an officer of the Order of Canada in 1992.

== Personal life ==
Soon after &quot;Extension&quot; finished, Webb moved from Toronto to Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, where she lived for much of her life. Webb died at Lady Minto Hospital on Salt Spring Island on November 11, 2021.

<text>The Francs-tireurs et partisans français (, FTPF), or commonly the Francs-tireurs et partisans (FTP), was an armed resistance organization created by leaders of the French Communist Party during World War II (1939–45). The communist party was neutral at first, following the Soviet Union&#x27;s official view that the war was a struggle between imperialists, but changed to a policy of armed resistance against the German occupation of France after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Three groups were formed, consisting of party members, young communists and foreign workers. Early in 1942 they were merged to form the FTP, which undertook sabotage and assassinations of the occupation. The FTP became the best organized and most effective of the French Resistance groups. In March 1944, before the Allied forces returned to Normandy, the FTP was theoretically merged with the other Resistance groups. In practice, it retained its independence until the end of the war.

==Background==

Germany attacked the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 in Operation Barbarossa.
With this, the policy of the French Communist Party (&quot;Parti communiste français&quot;, PCF) switched to support for armed struggle against the German occupiers.
The National Front (&quot;Front national de l&#x27;indépendance de la France&quot;) was created as a French Resistance movement in the northern area in June 1941.
The &quot;Front national&quot; was theoretically independent of the PCF, but in reality it was dominated by the PCF.
At first the objectives were mainly political, taking advantage of the unstable situation under the occupying German army.
Charles Tillon was put in charge of military matters.

On 2 August 1941 Albert Ouzoulias was put in charge of the &quot;Bataillons de la Jeunesse&quot;, fighting groups that were being created by the &quot;Jeunesses Communistes&quot;. Soon after, Arthur Dallidet introduced him to Eugène Hénaff, who was responsible for the armed struggle under the direction of Tillon.
In October 1941 the PCF decided to unify its armed groups into the &quot;Organisation spéciale&quot;. Hénaff joined the leadership of the PCF&#x27;s &quot;Organisation Spéciale&quot;, where he was responsible for coordinating between the various armed units. He was a member of the &quot;Comité militaire national&quot;, which became the &quot;Francs-tireurs et partisans français&quot; (FTPF).

==Formation==

Rather than limit armed action to Communists, it was decided to create a non-Communist organization, the &quot;Francs-Tireurs et Partisans&quot; (FTP), under the &quot;Front national&quot;.
The FTP was open to non-communists but operated under communist control.
The FTP movement was seen as a way to increase the political influence of the Communist Party in the future government of France.
A special issue of &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; in February 1942 confirmed the existence of &quot;partisans et de francs-tireurs&quot; (partisans and free-shooters) to whom patriots should give aid and assistance. Another special issue in March 1942 urged people to form such groups to conduct guerrilla war and help the population defend itself against the &quot;&quot;boches&quot;&quot;.

The FTP was created in April 1942, led by Charles Tillon.
On 3 April 1942 &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; used the expression &quot;Francs-Tireurs et Partisans&quot; for the first time, and in following weeks reported acts of sabotage of war production and attacks against German soldiers and French collaborators. The paper began using the initials FTP in July 1942.
The FTP&#x27;s mandate was to sabotage railways and factories, punish collaborators and assassinate German soldiers.

==Organization==
The FTP unified three Communist organizations, the &quot;Bataillons de la Jeunesse&quot;, the &quot;Organisation Spéciale&quot; and the &quot;Main-d&#x27;œuvre immigrée&quot; (MOI).
The FTP national committee was headed by Charles Tillon, commander in chief.
Eugène Hénaff was political commissioner of the force until May 1943, when he was replaced by . 
Albert Ouzoulias was in charge of operations, and Georges Beyer was responsible for armaments and recruitment.
, a captain of the reserve, was Chief of Staff.
He wrote some of the manuals on tactics and armament, but his main role was to act as liaison between the FTP and the Gaullist resistance groups.

The inter-regional and departmental military committees reported to the central organization in groups of three, a basic principle in the communist Resistance. 
In the field, each group would consist of two groups of three or four men under a commander and his assistant.
For as long as possible they would continue to work in their normal occupations, only coming together to undertake an operation and then if possible returning to their normal daily life.
Ouzoulias was a proponent of quick strikes against carefully studied targets by small groups of fighters, who would then rapidly withdraw. 
He also drew up guidelines for urban warfare in which FTP units could attack greatly superior German forces and be protected while they withdrew.
Tillon called this a strategy of &quot;drops of mercury&quot;, through which the group could use surprise and mobility to achieve transient superiority before disappearing.

The FTP-MOI (&quot;Francs-tireurs et partisans – main-d&#x27;œuvre immigrée&quot;) was created in the spring of 1942 with four detachments made up of communists of &quot;immigrant&quot; origin.
Most of its fighters were Jews from France, Hungary, Romania or elsewhere in Europe. Some were former volunteers in the International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). 
Leaflets and publications were issued in Yiddish.
Although integrated with the FTP, the FTP-MOI groups retained their autonomy, which caused problems at times.
The FTP-MOI were aroused to violent reprisals against the Germans by the &quot;Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv Roundup&quot; in July 1942 in which Jews in Paris and other parts of France were arrested, detained and then deported to be killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp.
The violence of the FTP-MOI in their struggle for survival did not always coincide with the interests of the French people. 
They received little recognition in France after the war.

The FTP-MOI were the target of the notorious &quot;Affiche Rouge&quot; poster campaign, which emphasised the composition of the group&#x27;s membership in an attempt to discredit the Resistance as not &quot;French&quot; enough. The campaign seems to have had the effect of highlighting their feats to the general public as freedom fighters.

==History==
The military strength of the communists was still relatively feeble at the end of 1941, but the rapid growth of the FTP ensured that French communists regained their reputation as an effective anti-fascist force.
Arthur Dallidet was placed in charge of security.
Dallidet was recognized talking to a woman in a cafe beside the Reuilly metro station on the evening on 28 February 1942. He was arrested, taken to La Santé Prison, chained, handcuffed and severely beaten. He did not reveal any information, but had been carrying a long list of names and addresses. This led to other arrests including &quot;Betty&quot; (Madeleine Passot), his most important liaison officer. Further names and addresses were found in Betty&#x27;s apartment.

Gradually the FTP developed a more military organization, with sections, companies and battalions, each containing three lower-level groups. There were often gaps in this paper organization. The FTP complained that the British and Gaullists were deliberately depriving them of arms, although more likely the problem was that they did not have the necessary contacts to arrange delivery.

In November 1943 Joseph Epstein, the FTP Chief of Staff, was arrested and subjected to extreme torture, but revealed nothing. This was followed by a major police operation that largely destroyed the FTP&#x27;s Paris organization. From the end of 1943 the national organization began to intensify preparation for a national uprising to support the expected Allied landings in Europe. 

By 1944, the FTP had an estimated strength of 100,000 men and women.
In March 1944 General Charles de Gaulle placed all the French Forces of the Interior (&quot;Forces françaises de l&#x27;intérieur&quot;, FFI) under the authority of General Marie-Pierre Kœnig, but the FTP retained its de facto independence. During the Allied Normandy Campaign the FTP conducted delaying actions in the center and southwest of France against the German troops who had been recalled to the battle zone.

=== Liberation of Paris ===
From June to August 1944 Ouzoulias coordinated the FTP&#x27;s military action in the Paris region. Ouzoulias and Colonel Henri Rol-Tanguy, who led the Île-de-France Resistance movement, planned a major rising in Paris which played a vital role during the August 1944 Liberation of Paris.

The FFI in Paris led by Alexandre Parodi and Jacques Chaban-Delmas urged patience while Tanguy wanted to start a revolt, being deterred only by the fact that the Resistance in Paris had about 15,000 men, but only 600 guns, mostly rifles and machine guns. On 19 August 1944, the Paris police, until then still loyal to Vichy, went over to the Resistance as a group of policemen hosted the &quot;tricolore&quot; over the Préfecture de Police on the Ile de la Cité, which was the first time the tricolor had flown in Paris since June 1940. Emboldened, Tanguy and his men started to attack German forces on the Boulevard Saint-Michel and Boulevard Saint-Germain, leading to a mass insurrection as Parisians started to build barricades in the streets. By the end of the day, about 50 Germans and 150 &quot;résistants&quot; had been killed and not wanting the Communists to have the credit for liberating Paris, the Gaullist Parodi sanctioned the uprising.

Faced with an urban uprising that he was unprepared for, the city&#x27;s German commander Dietrich von Choltitz arranged a truce with Parodi via the Swedish consul Raoul Nordling, marking the first time that the Germans had treated the resistance as a legitimate opponent. But skirmished on 22 August, when some German units tried to leave their fortifications. On 23 August, under Choltitz&#x27;s orders, the Germans opened fire on the Grand Palais, an FFI stronghold, and German tanks fired at the barricades in the streets. Hitler gave the order to inflict maximum damage on the city.

Among those participating in the fighting were those resisters freed on 19 August Four in a Nordling negotiated prisoner exchange. These included 19 year-old Madeleine Riffaud who on 23 August led the FTP operation that trapped a train carrying loot and munitions from the city in the Buttes-Chaumont tunnel and secured the surrender of the 80 German soldiers aboard.

On the 25 August, after an advance unit of General Leclerc&#x27;s 2nd Armored Division, &quot;La Nueve&quot; (160 men, most of whom were Spanish Republicans) had broken into the city and reached the Hotel de Ville, von Choltitz capitulated. The last FTP operation in the city (in which Riffaud also participated) was on the 26th, an attack on the barracks on Place de la République, whose garrison who refused to accept von Choltitz&#x27;s order to surrender.

=== Demobilisation ===
On 28 August 1944 de Gaulle put Ouzoulias in charge of the FTP and the FFI. In the autumn of 1944 Ouzoulias was charged by de Gaulle with integrating the FTP members with the regular French army. In October 1944 the communist militias were dissolved and the FTP was integrated into General de Lattre&#x27;s army.

In 2019, a surviving member of FTP, Edmond Réveil, revealed details of the June 1944 execution of up to 40 Nazi occupiers, taken during the Tulle uprising, along with a woman collaborator, at , near Meymac. After delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, forensic examination of the likely burial site only began in May 2023, initially using ground-penetrating radar. 11 bodies had been found at the site in 1967; by August 2023 artefacts had been unearthed, but no further bodies.

<text>==Negative==
The largest seamless photograph made in a single exposure was made using a Southern California jet hangar transformed into a giant camera. The most recent claim to the largest image stitched together was by the Canadian Museum of Civilization.

On 3 August 2015, the &quot;longest&quot; photographic negative was measured wide. This negative was created by Esteban Pastorino Díaz (Spain) by driving on the 2nd Ring Road (Beijing). Esteban Pastorino Díaz also holds the previous record, a negative measured wide. He used a custom-built panoramic slit camera on 13 June 2010. The negative is a panorama of major streets in Buenos Aires, Argentina, captured by the slit camera while mounted on the roof of a moving car.

===Largest seamless example===
*Name of project/picture: &quot;The Great Picture&quot;
*Claimed by: The Legacy Project; (Jerry Burchfield, Mark Chamberlain, Jacques Garnier, Rob Johnson, Douglas McCulloh, and Clayton Spada)
*Photograph of: control tower and runways at the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, Orange County, California
*Dimensions: high × wide (9.75h × 33.83w meters). Aspect ratio is 3.47:1.
On July 12, 2006, six photographers (Jerry Burchfield, Mark Chamberlain, Jacques Garnier, Rob Johnson, Douglas McCulloh, and Clayton Spada) unveiled what is currently the world&#x27;s largest camera and photograph.

The photograph was made to mark the end of 165 years of film/chemistry-based photography and the start of the age of digital photography. It was taken using a decommissioned Marine Corps jet hangar (Building #115 at El Toro) transformed into the world&#x27;s largest camera to make the world&#x27;s largest picture. The hangar-turned-camera recorded a panoramic image of what was on the other side of the door using the centuries-old principle of &quot;camera obscura&quot; or pinhole camera. An image of the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station appeared upside down and flipped left to right on film after being projected through the tiny hole in the hangar&#x27;s metal door. The &quot;film&quot; is a by piece of white fabric covered in 20 gallons (75.71 liters) of light-sensitive emulsion as the &quot;negative&quot;.

After exposing the fabric for 35 minutes, the image was developed by 80 volunteers using a giant custom-made tray of vinyl pool liner. Development employed 600 gallons (2271 liters) of black-and-white developer solution and 1,200 gallons (4542 liters) of fixer pumped into the tray by ten high volume pumps. Print washing used fire hoses connected to two fire hydrants.

===Largest example assembled from multiple pieces===
*Name of project/picture: Unknown (Grand Hall diorama background)
*Claimed by: Canadian Museum of History
*Photograph of: Canadian Aboriginal forest
*Dimensions: 112 m (367 ft) (W) × 15 m (49 ft) (H)
*Photographers: Rob d&#x27;Estrube assisted by Dirk Heydemann of Destrube Photography of Victoria, B.C., Canada
The scene was originally produced on 6x6 cm transparency film shot with a Hasselblad 80mm lens in many overlapping sections. 80 rolls of film were used over several sites with this scene being finally chosen. The site is the estuary of Nasparti Bay at the base of the Brooks Peninsula on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Shot in 1987 or 1988 to be ready for the opening of the museum in 1989. The installation is actually two scrims of identical size, one behind the other in mirror image to give the viewers a 3-dimensional experience while walking beside the diorama.

Within the Canadian Museum of History, one wall of the massive Grand Hall is composed of a scrim covered by a photo of a forest. The photo is about .

===&quot;Portrait of a Coral Reef&quot; (1999)===
*Name of project/picture: Portrait of a Coral Reef
*Claimed by: Jim Hellemn
*Photograph of: Bloody Bay Wall Coral Reef in Cayman Islands
*Dimensions: 76,934px (W) × 23,010px (H)
*Size: 4.95GB
*Pixels: 1,770,251,340
*Year: 1999

The previous record may have belonged to Jim Hellemn of Blue Ocean Art. In 1999, Hellemn created a 1.77 gigapixel underwater photocomposite image, which was designed to facilitate life-size reproduction of a 20 ft high by 70 ft wide section of Bloody Bay Wall, a vertical coral reef wall in the Cayman Islands. The image consisted of over 300 images that were manually stitched together from 4000ppi drum scans of Fuji Provia 100 transparency film. To make the image, a grid of 280 frames was photographed with 30% overlap to accurately cover the reef wall with full-spectrum light revealing the natural color and detail of the reef. Additional frames of marine life carefully photographed in the same grid composited in place to complete the scene. The on-site photography, requiring 23 dives and over 12 hours underwater to complete, was accomplished over a ten-day period by Jim Hellemn, with assistants Larry Hellemn and Peter Neubauer, using a neutrally-buoyant camera platform Hellemn designed specifically for the project. The post production of the image was completed in six months using multiple Macintosh G4 computers at Photographix in Poway, California, a digital graphics company owned by Hellemn.

A zoomable version of the image was made available to the public in 2000 using the ER Mapper&#x27;s ECW (file format) and Image Web Server software on a site operated by Fugro-Pelagos, allowing visitors to explore the life-size image. The project and the techniques used by Hellemn inspired researchers at Miami University to use similar methods to produce wide-coverage video mosaics to study coral reefs. The image was published in the October 2001 issue of &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot;, &quot;Portrait of a Coral Reef&quot;.

<text>The Grand Rapids Press is a daily newspaper published in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It is the largest of the print publications of MLive Media Group. It is sold for $1.50 daily and $7.99 on Sunday.

AccuWeather provides weather content to the &quot;Grand Rapids Press&quot;.

== History ==
&quot;The Morning Press&quot; was founded by William J. Sproat and appeared on Monday, September 1, 1890. Sproat was its proprietor until November 5, 1891, when control passed to the Press Publishing company. Soon after, the controlling interest in the company was purchased by George G. Booth, who in 1892 bought the rival &quot;Grand Rapids Eagle&quot; and merged it with the &quot;Press&quot;. January 1, 1893, the &quot;Press&quot; went into the evening daily field, which it has since occupied.

This newspaper at first was published at 63 Pearl Street. Then for a number of years it occupied a building on the Grand River at the southeast end of the Pearl Street bridge. In 1906 it moved to a new home at Fulton Street and Sheldon Avenue.

The paper was published downtown at the corner of Monroe and Michigan until 2004 when the printing facility was moved to the northern suburb of Walker. The Walker facility was closed in October, 2020, and sold in 2021 to an industrial contracting firm. The newspaper is now printed in Cleveland, OH, at the same facility that prints the &quot;Plain Dealer&quot;. The editorial and newsroom offices are now at 169 Monroe Ave. NW, suite 100. They hire aspiring journalists through an internship program.

Home delivery for the &quot;Press&quot;, &quot;Muskegon Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Kalamazoo Gazette&quot; were cut back to Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays in 2012; on the other days in which the &quot;Grand Rapids Press&quot; is published, subscribers receive an e-edition of that day&#x27;s newspaper. The print edition of each day&#x27;s &quot;Press&quot; continues to be available in newsstands.

<doc id="1243685" wikidata="Q2463251" url="?curid=1243685" title="The Singles 1992–2003">
<text>The Singles 1992–2003 is a greatest hits album by American rock band No Doubt, released on November 14, 2003, by Interscope Records. It features 13 of the band&#x27;s singles from three studio albums—&quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; (1995), &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; (2000), and &quot;Rock Steady&quot; (2001)—and the single &quot;Trapped in a Box&quot; from their 1992 self-titled debut album. The album also included a cover of Talk Talk&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, the only new song on the album and which was released as a single. It was released alongside the DVD &quot;Rock Steady Live&quot;, a video of a concert as part of the band&#x27;s Rock Steady tour in 2002, and the box set &quot;Boom Box&quot;, which contained &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;, &quot;Everything in Time&quot;, &quot;The Videos 1992–2003&quot;, and &quot;Live in the Tragic Kingdom&quot;.

No Doubt went into hiatus in April 2003 after the release of four singles from their fifth studio album, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, allowing the four members to spend time with loved ones. This also allowed their lead singer, Gwen Stefani, to work on her solo music side project, under which she has released three albums, &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; (2004), &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; (2006), and &quot;This Is What the Truth Feels Like&quot; (2016). The band regrouped in September 2003 to record the lead single for the album, &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, with producer Nellee Hooper. Additionally, in May 2010, the band regrouped again to start work on their latest record.

The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised the variety of music genres on the album. It reached number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and has been certified double platinum in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, and platinum in Australia.

==Background==
No Doubt released their fifth studio album, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, in December 2001 and from it released four singles, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Underneath It All&quot;, and &quot;Running&quot; between 2001 and 2003. The album was commercially successful, selling three million copies worldwide and being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In April 2003, No Doubt went into hiatus to take a break to spend time with their families before starting to compile &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;, which would feature the band&#x27;s greatest hits from their previous albums.

The main reason to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, their lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired music side project, under which she released two solo albums—&quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; on November 23, 2004, and &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; on December 5, 2006 (in addition to another solo album in 2016, after a No Doubt reunion album in 2012).

==Music==
The album was a compilation of 13 commercially released singles by the band from their previous studio albums, &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, and &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, as well as the independently released single &quot;Trapped in a Box&quot; from No Doubt&#x27;s self-titled debut studio album, and a brand-new cover version of &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;. However, &quot;The Singles&quot; did not include &quot;Happy Now?&quot; and &quot;Hey You!&quot;, two singles from &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, neither of which were commercially successful, or &quot;Squeal&quot; and &quot;Doghouse&quot; from &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot;, which were both independently released. &quot;Girls Get the Bass in the Back&quot;, a remix of &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, and a live acoustic version of &quot;Underneath It All&quot; were included as bonus tracks on international pressings of the album.

===Production===
Being a greatest hits album and containing only one new song, recording &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot; took very little time compared with the band&#x27;s studio albums. Production started in September 2003 with the recording of a cover version of Talk Talk&#x27;s song &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, produced by Nellee Hooper. The accompanying music video for the song was filmed by director David LaChapelle at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Stefani insisted that just because no songwriting was involved in the production of the album did not mean no effort would be needed: the band had to decide which of their songs to include and which to leave out. Two months later on November 25, the album was released along with the B-side, rarity, and remix collection &quot;Everything in Time&quot; and box set &quot;Boom Box&quot;.

===Singles===
The only single from &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot; was a cover of the song &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, originally released in 1984 by the synth-pop band Talk Talk. Because the band were taking a break while lead singer Stefani recorded her solo debut album &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot;, they decided to do a cover version to avoid having to write a new song. The band listened to hundreds of songs and narrowed it down to &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; and the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Change&quot;, released in 1982 by Australian new wave band INXS. No Doubt had doubts on recording a cover and contemplated writing new material, but decided on &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; after rehearsing the song with producer Nellee Hooper, referring to it as a &quot;feel-good&quot; song. Stefani stated:

&quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; later became one of the band&#x27;s biggest hits, being certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song was nominated for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 47th Grammy Awards, but lost out to Los Lonely Boys&#x27; &quot;Heaven&quot;. Stuart Price (also known as Jacques Lu Cont), the song&#x27;s programmer, created the Thin White Duke mix of &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, which won the award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. Mike McGuirk of Rhapsody described the album as &quot;a real joy for anyone who has a taste for Gwen Stefani&#x27;s yearning vocals and her band&#x27;s uncanny ability to mix ska, teen pop and hip-hop.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album a &quot;stellar collection&quot;, concluding that it is &quot;the kind of compilation that satisfies fans of all stripes and converts skeptics. It&#x27;s the greatest-hits package that [No Doubt] deserve[s].&quot; Anthony Thornton of &quot;NME&quot; stated, &quot;Despite being an album packed with as much drama as the band themselves have suffered, it&#x27;ll be the pop anthems you come back for and fortunately there&#x27;s enough here to keep even the soap addicts happy.&quot; Sara McDonnell of &quot;musicOMH&quot; wrote that the album&#x27;s music had &quot;sheer diversity&quot; due to the band&#x27;s &quot;pick &#x27;n mix approach to musical styles&quot;. The high points were &quot;Gwen Stefani&#x27;s lyrics, which deal principally with coming to terms with her own femininity&quot; and &quot;the band&#x27;s collaborations with various hip producers&quot;, such as The Neptunes, Nellee Hooper and Sly and Robbie; and the low points were the album&#x27;s &quot;hotch-potch feel&quot;, &quot;random tracklisting&quot; and the &quot;forays into reggae&quot;. Ruth Mitchell of the BBC Music viewed the album as a typical Christmas album that was &quot;unlikely to stand out from the crowd&quot; and &quot;too long, [getting] tiresome about half way through&quot;, although complimenting &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and &quot;Underneath It All&quot;. However, she also expressed disappointment at the placement of &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;, &quot;the foursome&#x27;s most glorious pop moment&quot;, at the end of the album. &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; later gave the album four stars out of five.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot; debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 253,000 copies in its first week. The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on July 21, 2004, and had sold 2,474,000 copies in the United States. In Canada, the album was certified double platinum on June 13, 2005 by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), denoting sales of over 200,000 copies. In Australia, the album was certified gold in 2003 and platinum in 2004 by the Australian Recording Industry Association, signalling sales of over 35,000 and 70,000 units, respectively.

<text>Eric Matthew Stefani (born June 17, 1967) is an American musician and animator best known as the founder and former member of the ska punk band No Doubt. He is the older brother of former bandmate Gwen Stefani and is also a former animator on the television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Stefani is the son of Dennis and Patti Stefani. He attended Loara High School in Anaheim, California. He worked at a Dairy Queen with his sister Gwen and John Spence. After high school, he attended Cypress College. He went on to study animation at the California Institute of the Arts in 1991.

According to No Doubt&#x27;s guitarist Tom Dumont, Eric was able to write music for the band despite not knowing music theory—an accomplishment that impressed Dumont, since he was a music major.

==Career==
Stefani, his sister Gwen and John Spence formed the band No Doubt in 1986. The group added several members and performed live shows at venues such as Fenders Ballroom in Long Beach. The group started writing original material much of which Eric Stefani contributed. He left once the band&#x27;s album &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was recorded. Eric and Gwen were nominated as a songwriting team at the 1998 Grammy Awards for Song of the Year for &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;.

Stefani left the group before their breakthrough to work in animation full time, previously splitting his time with the band, and working for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The episode &quot;Homerpalooza&quot; contains a quick scene, drawn by Stefani, where the members of No Doubt appear, although they aren&#x27;t featured.

In an interview on &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot; on October 26, 2020, Gwen revealed that Eric recorded some instrumentation on one of the tracks for her upcoming album, which ended up being &quot;Let Me Reintroduce Myself&quot;.

<doc id="1243698" wikidata="Q1630395" url="?curid=1243698" title="Muswell Hillbillies">
<text>Muswell Hillbillies is the tenth studio album by the English rock group the Kinks. Released on 24 November 1971, it was the band&#x27;s first album released through RCA Records. The album is named after the Muswell Hill area of North London, where band leader Ray Davies and guitarist Dave Davies grew up and the band formed in the early 1960s.

The album introduces a number of working class figures and the stresses with which they must contend. It did not sell well but received critical acclaim and lasting fan appreciation.

== Recording ==
&quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album for RCA Records, their prior recordings having been released on Pye Records (Reprise Records in the United States). Their contract with Pye/Reprise expired the same year. The album was recorded between August and October 1971
at Morgan Studios, London, using a new brass section, the Mike Cotton Sound, which included Mike Cotton on trumpet, John Beecham on trombone and tuba, and Alan Holmes on clarinet.

== Reception ==
The album was not a commercial success (it failed to chart in the United Kingdom and peaked at #100 in the U.S.), and its sales were a disappointment following the success of &quot;Lola&quot; the previous year. &quot;Stereo Review&quot; magazine called the poor-selling record &quot;album of the year&quot; in 1972 (even though it was released on 24 November 1971). In the 1984 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editors gave the album five stars out of five and called it Davies&#x27; &quot;signature statement&quot; as a songwriter. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album a wide-ranging collection of Ray Davies compositions which focus on the tensions and frustrations of modern life.

==Re-releases==
A remastered deluxe edition of &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot; was released in the UK on 7 October 2013, with several bonus tracks, alternate takes, and BBC recordings all remastered by Andrew Sandoval and Dan Hersch. On 10 November 2014, a Legacy Edition was released for the United States, with disc 1 containing the remastered stereo album, and many of the UK Deluxe Edition bonus tracks remastered by Vic Anesini, while the second disc is a DVD with promotional TV performances (previously released in the UK on &quot;The Kinks at the BBC&quot; box set) from the era.

== Artwork ==
The front cover picture was taken by Rod Shone in the Archway Tavern, a pub in Archway (more than two miles away from Muswell Hill). The back inset picture, showing the band below a signpost giving directions to Muswell Hill, was taken on the small traffic island at the intersection of Castle Yard and Southwood Lane in Highgate.

== Track listing ==


The 2014 SA-CD release has the same tracks listing as the 1998 CD re-issue version.

<text>Prince Philippe, Duke of Orléans (; 6 February 1869 – 28 March 1926) was the Orléanist pretender to the throne of France from 1894 to 1926 as Philippe VIII.

==Early life==
Philippe was born at York House, Twickenham, near London, Middlesex, England, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the son of Philippe, Count of Paris, by his wife (and first cousin), Princess Isabelle of Orléans. He was baptised with the names &quot;Louis-Philippe-Robert&quot;, and was called Philippe. His family lived in the United Kingdom from the abdication and banishment of his great-grandfather Louis Philippe, King of the French, in 1848, and returned to France in 1871 following the fall of the Second French Empire. However, they again took refuge in England in 1886, when the French Republic exiled them following the wedding in Paris of Philippe&#x27;s sister Amélie of Orléans to Crown Prince Carlos of Portugal.

Returning therefore to France in 1871 with his parents, Philippe was educated at home at the Château d&#x27;Eu and at the Collège Stanislas de Paris. His tutor from the end of 1882 to 1887 was Théodore Froment, previously a professor of Latin literature at Bordeaux. In 1880 Philippe&#x27;s father granted him the title &quot;Duc d&#x27;Orléans&quot;. On 16 June 1881, he received the sacrament of confirmation at Eu. Growing up to be tall and blond, he later grew a beard. He was a better athlete than scholar and learned to love mountain-climbing from Captain Morhain, a former soldier from Saint-Cyr who had become his father&#x27;s accountant.

==Military career==
Philippe began his military education at the &quot;École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr&quot;. In June 1886 he was on the point of becoming an officer in the French army when his family was once again exiled by France&#x27;s republican government. At first he was placed under the tutelage of a Colonel de Parseval, under whose supervision he would later attend a military academy in Lausanne. In Great Britain and Ireland he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, on the nomination of Queen Victoria in February 1887, completing his training there and developing an abiding interest in geography, topography, and the natural sciences.

He was attached for service to the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, which was then serving in the British Raj, but never held an actual commission in the British Army, in order to respect a French law forbidding Frenchmen from holding commissions in foreign armies without the permission of the French head of state. Nevertheless, he was ranked as a sub-lieutenant and served in India from January 1888 to March 1889, where he was a staff-officer to Lord Roberts, then Commander-in-Chief in India.
In October 1889, Philippe went to Switzerland to complete a course in military theory. While there he fathered a son, Philippe Debien, by Nina, an actress working in the casino at Lausanne. On his 21st birthday in February 1890 he left Switzerland by train with his friend Honoré d&#x27;Albert, 10th duc de Luynes, and entered Paris in violation of the law of exile of 1886. There, he offered to perform his military service, as required by law. Instead he was arrested and confined in the Conciergerie. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment at Clairvaux, but was released after a few months and expelled back to Switzerland.

Drawn to explore the &quot;unknown&quot;, Philippe asked Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, to send him to a military post in the Himalayas. While in the East, he undertook a hunting and exploratory expedition in Nepal with his cousin Prince Henri of Orléans, went mountain-climbing in Tibet, and visited Afghanistan, Ceylon, and the Persian Gulf, before being posted back to Britain.

Prior to his imprisonment in France, Philippe had been unofficially engaged to his first cousin Princess Marguerite of Orléans, but the engagement was cancelled when Philippe&#x27;s involvement with the Australian opera singer Nellie Melba was revealed. Melba was still married to Charles Nesbitt Armstrong, although they had lived apart for some years. Armstrong filed for divorce from Melba on the grounds of adultery, naming Philippe as co-respondent; the case was eventually dropped.

In September 1890, Philippe accompanied his father on a two-month trip to the United States and Canada. They visited the battlefields of the American Civil War, in which his father had fought, as well as Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C.; Richmond, Virginia; Manhattan, New York, New York County, New York; and Quebec, Canada.

On 12 November 1890, while in Philadelphia, Philippe joined the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) - a military society composed of officers who had served the Union in the American Civil War and their descendants - by right of his father&#x27;s service in the Union Army. He joined as a companion of the 2nd class - a membership category for the eldest sons of companions of the 1st class who were veteran officers and was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 8262. Upon his father&#x27;s death on 8 September 1894, he became a hereditary companion of the 1st class.

In December 1890, Philippe applied unsuccessfully to serve in the Russian Army. In March 1893, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.

In March 1894, Philippe went to Egypt and Palestine with his sister Hélène, Duchess of Aosta. Then he went lion shooting in Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia). In May 1894, he was attached to the Royal Buckinghamshire Hussars, a yeomanry regiment.

==Claimant to the defunct throne==
Upon the death of his father on 8 September 1894, Philippe became the Orléanist claimant to the defunct French throne. He was known to monarchists as Philippe VIII. He was an active claimant, regularly issuing manifestos. In October 1895, Philippe was named as co-respondent in the divorce case of Woolston v. Woolston.

Unlike his great grandfather, Louis Philippe I, Philippe claimed grand mastership of the Order of the Holy Spirit as intrinsic to his dynastic claim to the throne, and sometimes wore the breast star of the order.

On 5 November 1896, in Vienna, Philippe married Archduchess Maria Dorothea of Austria (1867–1932), a daughter of Archduke Joseph Karl of Austria, Palatine of Hungary, and granddaughter of Princess Clémentine of Orléans, as well as a niece of Marie Henriette of Austria, Queen Consort of the Belgians. There were no children from this marriage. The couple were poorly matched and after several years they lived apart.

While travelling in Geneva in 1898, Philippe narrowly missed being assassinated by Luigi Lucheni, an anarchist, who vowed to kill the next member of a royal family that he saw. The victim would turn out to be the Empress Elisabeth of Austria, stabbed to death on the quayside.

He was an active yachtsman and made four Arctic voyages. In 1904 he sailed to Svalbard, Norway, Sweden-Norway. He explored parts of the northeastern coast of Greenland, Denmark, in 1905 during his Duke of Orléans Arctic Expedition on ship Belgica. In 1907 he sailed in the Kara Sea north of Siberia, Russia, and in 1909 went even further north into the Arctic Ocean.

He made a short film, &quot;Jaripeo y fiestas en Jalapa&quot; (&quot;Jaripeo and Festivals in Jalapa&quot;), during a trip to Mexico in 1910.

Philippe continued to reside in the United Kingdom until 1912, when he moved his primary residence to Belgium. In 1914, Philippe and his wife Maria Dorothea were legally separated. She subsequently lived in Hungary.

At the outbreak of the First World War, Philippe again tried unsuccessfully to join the French army. He was also refused permission to serve in the Belgian army and instead returned to the United Kingdom. A plan to join the Italian army was prevented by a serious accident in which he was knocked down by a bus.

In 1926, Philippe died of pneumonia at the Palais d&#x27;Orléans in Palermo, Sicily, Italy. Having no legitimate issue, he was succeeded as pretender to the defunct throne of France by his cousin and brother in law, Jean, Duke of Guise.

<text>The first USS &quot;Stewart&quot; was a in the United States Navy. She was named for Rear Admiral Charles Stewart.

==Construction==
&quot;Stewart&quot; was laid down on 24 January 1900, at Morris Heights, New York, by the Gas Engine and Power Company; launched on 10 May 1902; sponsored by Mrs. Paul Lee Cocke, granddaughter of Rear Admiral Stewart; and commissioned on 1 December 1902.

==Pre-World War I==
After commissioning, &quot;Stewart&quot; served for a short time at the Naval Academy and then joined the Coast Squadron of the North Atlantic Fleet. In 1906, she was placed in reserve at Norfolk, Virginia but was recommissioned in 1907 in the Atlantic Fleet and transferred in 1908 to the Pacific Fleet. As one of the first group of destroyers built in the United States, &quot;Stewart&quot; quickly became obsolete; and, on 24 February 1916, the Navy Department decided that destroyers numbered 1 through 16 were &quot;no longer serviceable for duty with the fleet.&quot; These ships were henceforth classed as &quot;coast torpedo vessels&quot;, but this did not prevent &quot;Stewart&quot; from having an active career in World War I.

==World War I==
After the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, &quot;Stewart&quot; patrolled first off the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal and along the Colombian coast; and then, after 11 May, off the Pacific entrance to the canal. On 5 July, she returned to the Atlantic, and was fitted out at the Philadelphia Navy Yard from 22 July-11 August for distant service.

On 13 August, she sailed for the British Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda with a destroyer flotilla; but, on arrival on 16 August, she grounded in the harbor and required repairs at the Royal Naval Dockyard there and at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which lasted through 10 October. On 11 October, &quot;Stewart&quot; began dispatch and escort duty from a base in the York River. Except for one interruption for training, this duty continued until 31 December 1917, when she entered the Philadelphia yard to fit out again for distant service.

Departing the yard on 15 January 1918, &quot;Stewart&quot; sailed the next day for Europe in company with , , , and . Stopping in the Azores from 29 January-4 February, &quot;Stewart&quot; and &quot;Worden&quot; arrived at Brest, France, on the 9th and began convoy escort duty off that port on the 17th.

On 17 April, as &quot;Stewart&quot; entered Quiberon Bay, an American steamer, &quot;Florence H&quot;, with a cargo of powder and steel, exploded in the anchorage. &quot;Stewart&quot; saved nine survivors, and her crew was cited by the Secretary of the Navy for gallantry during the rescue. On 23 April, &quot;Stewart&quot; sighted two seaplanes dropping bombs, apparently on a submarine; and she raced to the spot. One aircraft flew over the destroyer, and the observer pointed to the location of the sub. &quot;Stewart&quot; saw first the sub&#x27;s wake, then its periscope, and finally the dark form of her hull underwater. She was forced to turn away at the last moment due to the effort of a French escort to ram the sub, but dropped two depth charges which brought up large amounts of oil. The action was evaluated at the time as a kill; but the submarine, &quot;U-108&quot;, survived to be damaged by several days later and finally to surrender at Harwich at the end of the war.

During a dense fog three days later, &quot;Stewart&quot; was damaged when she collided with an unidentified merchantman, and she remained under repair until 28 May. On 4 August, the destroyer made another attack on an apparent submarine wake, but obtained no evidence of success.

==Inter-war period==
After the armistice ending World War I was signed on 11 November, &quot;Stewart&quot; ceased convoy duty; and she entered drydock at Brest on 26 November for repairs. On 9 December, she departed Brest with four other destroyers; and, after passing the convoy carrying President Woodrow Wilson to Europe two days later and subsequently making stops at the Azores and Bermuda, the destroyers arrived at Philadelphia on 3 January 1919. Decommissioned on 9 July, &quot;Stewart&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September, and sold on 3 January 1920 to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company, Philadelphia, for scrap.

<text>A New Way to Pay Old Debts (c. 1625, printed 1633) is an English Renaissance drama, the most popular play by Philip Massinger. Its central character, Sir Giles Over-reach, became one of the more popular villains on English and American stages through the 19th century.

==Performance==
Massinger probably wrote the play in 1625, though its debut on stage was delayed a year as the theatres were closed due to bubonic plague. In its own era it was staged by Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men at the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane. It was continuously in the repertory there and at the Red Bull Theatre, under the managements of Christopher Beeston, William Beeston, and Sir William Davenant, down to the closing of the theatres at the start of the English Civil War in 1642.

Though Massinger&#x27;s play shows obvious debts to Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;A Trick to Catch the Old One&quot; (c. 1605), it transcends mere imitation to achieve a powerful dramatic effectiveness – verified by the fact that, apart from the Shakespearean canon, it was almost the only pre-Restoration play that was continuously in the dramatic repertory through much of the modern era. After David Garrick&#x27;s 1748 revival, the play remained popular throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. (It was praised by Thomas Jefferson.) Edmund Kean&#x27;s version of Sir Giles, which debuted in 1816, was in particular a tremendous popular success, and drove the play&#x27;s reputation through the remainder of the century.

The play remains in the active theatrical repertory; modern stagings are usually amateur or student productions, though the Royal Shakespeare Company performed the play in 1983, directed by Adrian Noble and with Emrys James as Sir Giles.

==Publication==
The play was first published in 1633 in quarto by stationer Henry Seyle (his shop was &quot;in S. Pauls Church-yard, at the signe of the Tygers head&quot;). The 1633 quarto carries a dedication of &quot;this trifle&quot; to Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon, Master Falconer of England (he&#x27;d succeeded to his hereditary title, Chief Avenor and Keeper of the King&#x27;s Hawks and Falcons, at the age of six). In this dedication, Massinger states that he &quot;born a devoted servant to the thrice noble family of your incomparable Lady,&quot; that lady being Anna Sophia Herbert, daughter of Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, then serving as Lord Chamberlain. Massinger&#x27;s connection to the Herbert family, derived from his father, is well known; whether Carnarvon responded in any positive way to the dedication is obscure.

The 1633 quarto was the only edition of the play in the seventeenth century. Its later popularity onstage guaranteed frequent reprints, with 52 editions between 1748 and 1964 (not counting collections); others have followed since.

==Genre==
Dramaturgically, &quot;A New Way to Pay Old Debts&quot; contains elements of melodrama, comedy of manners, realism, and social satire, in a distinctive combination.

==The villain==
The play also falls into the category of the &quot;villain play&quot;, a drama in which the dominant figure is not a traditional protagonist or hero but his antagonist, a figure of evil. In the context of English Renaissance drama, the villain play grew out of the &quot;ranting Herod&quot; of the Medieval morality play. In the Elizabethan era, Christopher Marlowe was the great innovator in the villain play, with &quot;Tamburlaine,&quot; &quot;Doctor Faustus,&quot; and &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot;; Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; is another obvious example in the subgenre.

In &quot;A New Way to Pay Old Debts&quot;, Massinger took the villain play in a new direction of social realism: his villain is not a king or a conqueror but a credible figure from contemporary life. The play&#x27;s dominating character, Sir Giles Over-reach, is based on the real-life Sir Giles Mompesson. (Sir Giles&#x27; assistant in villainy, Justice Greedy, was suggested by Mompesson&#x27;s associate Sir Francis Michell.) The power of the role of Sir Giles may lie in Massinger&#x27;s success in depicting a blatant villain who has a quality of everyday believability. Sir Giles is down-to-earth in his cold malice:

The audience is presented with a character they might meet in their own lives, to their own cost.

==Class conflict==
The play illustrates the hardening of class distinctions that characterised the early Stuart era, leading up to the outbreak of the Civil War. In Elizabethan plays like &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1599), it was acceptable and even admirable that a young nobleman marry a commoner&#x27;s daughter; other plays of the era, like &quot;Fair Em&quot; (c. 1590) and &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (c. 1597–9), share this liberal attitude toward social mobility through marriage. In &quot;A New Way to Pay Old Debts&quot;, in contrast, Lord Lovell would rather see his family line go extinct than marry Over-reach&#x27;s daughter Margaret, even though she is young, beautiful, and virtuous. In Act IV, scene i, Lovell specifies that his attitude is not solely dependent on his loathing of the father&#x27;s personal vices, but is rooted in class distinction. Lovell rejects the idea of his descendants being &quot;one part scarlet&quot; (aristocratic) and &quot;the other London blue&quot; (common).

The drama&#x27;s class conflict can seem obscure to the modern reader, since Sir Giles Over-reach appears as an upper-class, not a lower-class figure: he is a knight and a rich man with large country estates, who lives the lavish lifestyle of the landed gentry. There is even a family connection between hero and villain: Frank Welborn is the nephew of Sir Giles&#x27; late wife. Yet Sir Giles himself expresses the conflict by noting that he is a &quot;city&quot; man—he comes from the financial milieu of the City of London with its worldly and materialistic values, the domain of nascent capitalism in contrast to the older social order rooted in feudalism. He observes that there is &quot;More than a feud, a strange antipathy / Between us&quot;, the men of money, &quot;and true gentry&quot;.

For a conservative moralist like Massinger, the upper classes, the &quot;true gentry&quot;, have a right to run society insofar as they fulfil the moral and ethical obligations of their traditional roles. It is Over-reach&#x27;s rejection of those tradition moral and ethical standards, his embrace of ruthless competition, that makes him a villain.

==Synopsis==
Set in rural Nottinghamshire, the play opens with its protagonist, Frank Welborn, being ejected from an alehouse by Tapwell and Froth, the tavernkeeper and his wife. Welborn has been refused further service (&quot;No booze? nor no tobacco?&quot;); he quarrels with the couple and beats them, but is interrupted by Tom Allworth. The conversations in the scene supply the play&#x27;s backstory, indicating that Welborn and Allworth are both members of the local gentry who have fallen victim to the financial manipulations of Sir Giles Over-reach. Welborn has lost his estates and been reduced to penury, while young Allworth has been forced to become the page of a local nobleman, Lord Lovell. Allworth offers Welborn a small sum, &quot;eight pieces&quot;, to relieve his immediate wants, but Welborn indignantly rejects the offer from a junior contemporary; he says that as his own vices have led to his fall, he will rely on his own wits for his recovery.

Tom Allworth&#x27;s widowed mother, Lady Allworth, retains her country house; she is visited there by neighbours and prospective suitors, including Sir Giles. While she has her servants greet these guests with appropriate hospitality, she remains &quot;cloister&#x27;d up&quot; in the seclusion of her mourning. When Sir Giles visits, he is accompanied by his two prime henchmen, the lawyer Jack Marall and Justice Greedy, the local justice of the peace. Together, Greedy and the Lady&#x27;s servants provide most of the play&#x27;s comic relief. Greedy is a lean man with an enormous appetite; a gourmand and a glutton, he is obsessed with food.

Lady Allworth instructs her son to avoid the dissolute Welborn; but Welborn forces his way into her presence, and reminds her of his relationship with her late husband. When the late Allworth had been down on his luck, Welborn had supported him, even seconding him in all his duels. The recollection makes Lady Allworth repent her harsh attitude toward the reprobate Welborn, and she offers him financial help; he rejects this, but requests a favour of her instead. The request is made in a whisper; the audience discovers its nature as the plot progresses.

Over-reach is shown with Marall, discussing his plan to marry his daughter Margaret to Lord Lovell. He also gives a first glimpse into the ruthless way he conducts his business affairs. Welborn seeks out Over-reach, but Sir Giles refuses to speak with him; Marall mocks his poverty. Yet Marall has to change his tune when he sees Lady Allworth come out of mourning to meet Welborn. When she kisses Welborn, Marall is convinced that the two will marry. When Marall informs Over-reach of what he&#x27;s seen, however, Over-reach refuses to believe him, and even beats him. Eventually, though, Over-reach himself sees Welborn and Lady Allworth together, and accepts the &quot;truth&quot; of their connection. Sir Giles favours their marriage, since he is sure that once Welborn possesses the Lady&#x27;s remaining property he can cheat the dissolute man of this property too.

Margaret Over-reach has no interest in marrying Lord Lovell, since she is in love with Tom Allworth, as he is with her. Lord Lovell knows of his page&#x27;s affections, and is willing to act as a go-between for the two. Young Allworth is nervous at this, suspecting that his patron will not be able to resist Margaret&#x27;s charms; but Lovell is an honourable man, and sincerely promotes their match. Over-reach thinks that Allworth is carrying messages between the Lord and his daughter, though the young page is actually pursuing his own romance. Together, the young couple manages to fool Sir Giles into thinking that Lovell wants a reluctant Margaret to elope with him; Over-reach pressures his daughter to conform, and even sends hurried written instructions to a compliant clergyman at the village of Gotham, to marry his daughter to &quot;this man.&quot; Of course he means Lovell, though the ambiguity favours the young lovers.

To facilitate the marriage of Welborn and Lady Allworth, Sir Giles advances Welborn a thousand pounds. He also discusses his plans with Lovell, revealing more of his intentions and his dark character, so that Lovell breaks into a &quot;cold sweat&quot; listening to him. (With each of his appearances in the play, Over-reach&#x27;s expressions of his villainy become more flagrant and overwrought, leading up to the denouement of the final scene.) Marall sees Welborn&#x27;s apparent ascension in fortune, and, chafing at Over-reach&#x27;s insulting and brutal treatment of him, decides to switch allegiances; his command of Over-reach&#x27;s legal papers gives Marall a key advantage in seeking his own revenge.

When Over-reach believes that Lovell and Margaret are married, he enters a state of near rapture: &quot;My ends! my ends are compass&#x27;d! . . . I can scarce contain myself, / I am so full of joy; nay, joy all over!&quot; The play&#x27;s final scene shows his sudden reversal, when he realises that he has been fooled and that Margaret has married Allworth. Enraged, he demands that Welborn provide security for the loan of £1000 from the Lady&#x27;s estates; Welborn rejects this, and demands that Over-reach return possession of his lands. Sir Giles dismisses this as folly—but discovers that the text of his deed to Welborn&#x27;s lands has mysteriously faded away (thanks to the trickery of Marall). Over-reach is ready to work his revenge with his sword, but Welborn, Lovell, and the Lady&#x27;s servants altogether are too formidable for him. He storms out, but returns in a distracted state of mind. The stresses of his reversal of fortune have caused him to lose his sanity, and he is taken into protective custody.

Welborn decides to demonstrate his reformation by taking a military commission in the regiment Lovell commands. Lovell and Lady Allworth have agreed to marry. Allworth and Margaret state that they will turn control of Over-reach&#x27;s estates to Lord Lovell, to make reparations for all to the people Sir Giles has cheated and oppressed.

==Critical responses==
The play&#x27;s prominence in theatrical history has won it the attention of scholars and critics. Some of the criticism has been favourable; one editor judged it &quot;a highly finished, integrated piece of work, with everything handsomely symmetrical about it.&quot; Yet critics have not been shy about finding faults; one called Sir Giles Over-reach &quot;the character whom his author could not control.&quot; Massinger&#x27;s blending of lighter dramatic materials, like comedy of intrigue, with the play&#x27;s more serious aspects, has also been faulted.

<text>Epanadiplosis (from Ancient Greek ἐπαναδίπλωσις/epanadíplôsis, from ἐπί/epí, “on”, ἀνά/aná, “again”, and διπλόος/diplóos, “double”, “doubling in succession”) is a figure of speech in which the same word is used at the end of a clause as at the beginning of a preceding clause. The opposite figure is anadiplosis. It allows for melodic and rhythmic interplay to suggest emphasis or humor. Epanadiplosis can also be used to emphasize a word, a group of words, or an idea.

Epanadiplosis is also a narrative figure used in many literary genres, which is called “narrative epanadiplosis”. It&#x27;s the repetition of an initial scene or motif (in the incipit) at the plot&#x27;s end (or clausule). It suggests that the narrative is closed in on itself.

== Nature and limits of the figure ==
Epanadiplosis is a figure of repetition affecting syntactic position (the order of words in the sentence). For César Chesneau Dumarsais, the figure appears “when, of two correlative propositions, one begins and the other ends with the same word”, or when, according to Henri Suhamy, only two propositions are involved.

He cites Tacitus as an example:“Principes pro victoria pugnant, comites pro principe (Leaders fight for victory, companions for their leader)”.More specifically, epanadiplosis is the repetition at the end of a sentence of a word or even a locution located at the beginning of a proposition. The figure therefore concerns the phrasal level, unlike narrative epanadiplosis, which concerns an entire text. It constitutes a linguistic mechanism that is the opposite of anadiplosis, and can be summarized as follows, according to Patrick Bacry:
A _______ / _______ A
As in these verses by François de Malherbe:[...] But she was of the world, where the most beautiful things

have the worst fate,

 And rose she lived what roses live

In the space of a morning. [...]For Jean-Jacques Robrieux, epanadiplosis is a figure close to chiasmus, as in this line by Victor Hugo, in which the indefinite pronoun “rien” is repeated symmetrically at the beginning and end of the proposition:“Rien ne me verra plus, je ne verrai plus rien”.For Nicole Ricalens-Pourchot, epanadiplosis is signaled by the use of “two juxtaposed propositions, separated by a comma or semicolon‘; it is, therefore, as Georges Molinié notes, a ’microstructural figure”, as it only affects the limits of the sentence, and therefore only plays on both elocution and construction. It is, moreover, a very rare figure.

=== Limits of the figure ===

==== Combination with other figures ====

Epanadiplosis is sometimes confused with epanalepsis, in which the same word or group of words is repeated within the same sentence:“Le temps s&#x27;en va, le temps s&#x27;en va, ma Dame”.

- Pierre de Ronsard, Sonnet à MarieHowever, these two figures, as well as that of anadiplosis, are often used in conjunction, as in this excerpt from Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s Rhinocéros (act i):“Yes, I have strength, I have strength for several reasons. First I have strength because I have strength, then I have strength because I have moral strength. I also have strength because I&#x27;m not an alcoholic.”Epanadiplosis is also often used in combination with symplosis, as in:“You in the corner are sure. You&#x27;re certain, that&#x27;s for sure.”

The whole allows for melodic and stylistic effects, since in the symphony the words or groups of words beginning a phrase and those ending it are repeated at the beginning and end of the following words. Epanadiplosis is combined, so that there is “an interweaving of repetitions”.

=== Anaplodiplosis ===

Narrative epanadiplosis, or “anaplodiplosis” (anadiplosis in Latin), from the Greek ἀνάπλωσις (“explanation”) and διπλόη (“anything doubled, or divided in two”) is a figure of speech that consists in completing a work, usually a novel, as one has begun it. It consists of repeating, at the very end of a work, the initial motif, event, or configuration described in the incipit. Anaplodiplosis is a way of “coming full circle”. At the end of the novel (or film), the reader or viewer encounters an identical or similar situation to that of the incipit, giving the work a certain depth. This cyclical conclusion is frequently found in short stories.

This process is akin to mise en abyme, frequently used in literature. It common in film and literature, especially in the fantasy genre. It gives narrative coherence to the work as a whole, and above all creates an impression of cycle, of eternal return. In a way, the story recounts the motif of natural cycles, such as the return of the seasons or the succession of generations. For the author, this may be an ironic way of saying that we&#x27;re back where we started, and that everything that has happened in the meantime is of little importance. Or it may simply be an aesthetic device aimed at creating a kind of symmetry, a regular ordering of the work.

== Stylistic use ==
In visual rhetoric, epanadiplosis can be used for comic purposes or to capture the imagination:“Too much tax kills taxThe looping effect of the figure creates the impression of a paradox and a closed maxim, as in Hobbes&#x27; example: “Man is a wolf to man”, where the initial argument is taken up as the final argument. In logic and rhetoric, the figure is often used in syllogisms. César Chesneau Dumarsais, in his &quot;Traité des tropes&quot;, discusses and defines it as: “There is another figure [of words] called epanadiplosis, which occurs when, of two correlative propositions, one begins and the other ends with the same word”, as in:“Man can cure everything, not man.”

- Georges Bernanos, &quot;Nous autres Français&quot;The figure can also border on tautology:“I am as I am”.

- Jacques Prévert, ParolesAccording to Bernard Dupriez, the purpose of epanadiplosis is often to underline, or even reiterate, as in:“Childhood knows what it wants. It wants to get out of childhood.

- Jean Cocteau, &quot;La Difficulté d&#x27;être&quot;Some epanadiploses, however, are the result of the randomness of everyday language, without any particular stylistic research:“An immobile donkey on a median strip, like a statue of a donkey.”

- Gilbert Cesbron, &quot;Journal sans date&quot;A final effect may be that of parallelism. According to Georges Molinié and Michèle Aquien, epanadiplosis often coordinates two propositions (in the sense of logical and semantic units) in the same sentence, which constitute repetition, by suggesting a parallel construction. They cite this example from &quot;La Bruyère&quot;:“...for this people seems to adore the prince, and the prince adores God”.The two sentence members that follow the conjugated verb “appears” are coordinated with each other in a strictly parallel structure: “the last word of the first member and the first word of the second member are the same” (this is the nominal group “the prince”). The epanadiplosis is doubled by an antimetabole in this example (for the verbal element: “adore le prince”).

== Genres covered ==

=== Poetry ===
Epanadiplosis between the first and last lines is a frequent feature of poems. In &quot;Les Regrets&quot;, Joachim du Bellay forms a palindromic epanadiplosis:&lt;poem&gt;If you want to live in court, Dilliers, remember
To always accost your master&#x27;s cuties,
If you&#x27;re not a favorite, pretend you are,
And to accommodate yourself to the king&#x27;s pastimes.
Remember not to lend your faith
To every man&#x27;s talk: but above all, be adextre,
To help with the left as well as the dexter
And by the morals of others to your morals give law.
Advance nothing of yours, Dilliers, but your service,
Nor show that thou art too much an enemy to vice,
And be often mute, blind, and deaf.
Do not let thy name be called for others.
Doing as I say, thou wilt be a gentleman:
Remember this, Dilliers, if you want to live in court.&lt;/poem&gt;
Guillaume Apollinaire, for his part, uses the resources of epanadiplosis to make the cycle of the seasons tangible, closing the poem on itself in a single suggestive image:
&lt;poem&gt;The meadow is poisonous but pretty in autumn
The cows grazing there
Slowly poisoning themselves
The colic colored of the ring and lilac
Your eyes are like that flower
Violet like their halo and like this autumn
And my life for your eyes is slowly poisoned
Schoolchildren come clattering in
Dressed in hiccups and playing the harmonica
They pick the colchicums that are like mothers
Daughters of their daughters and the color of your eyelids
Fluttering like flowers in the mad wind
The herdsman sings softly
While slow and mooing the cows abandon
For ever this great meadow ill-flowered by autumn&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Novel ===
The incipit and epilogue of Émile Zola&#x27;s novel &quot;Germinal&quot; form an epanadiplosis: the same character walks alone along the same road. On the first page, he arrives on a cold night in a mining country: “A single idea occupied the empty head of a worker without work and lodging, the hope that the cold would be less intense after daybreak ‘, and on the last page, he leaves Montsou, but in the sunshine, and hope: ’Penetrated by this hope, Étienne slows his walk, his eyes lost to the right and the left, in the gaiety of the new season. ”

Many novels use anaplodiplosis. These include Bernadin de Saint-Pierre&#x27;s &quot;Paul et Virginie&quot; (1788), Raymond Queneau&#x27;s &quot;Le Chiendent&quot; (1933), James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939), Paulo Coelho&#x27;s The Alchemist (1988), Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Wood Demon&quot; (play) (1889), Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; (1950) and Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; (1982 to 2004).

In Primo Levi&#x27;s stories and essays (&quot;La tregua, I sommersi e i salvati&quot;), admittedly far removed from novels, narrative epanadiplosis seals the author&#x27;s radical pessimism: “What has been can happen again”, so everything is always to be started again.

=== Film and audiovisual ===

* P.R.O.F.S. opens with a student asking the question “What is epanadiplosis? The answer doesn&#x27;t come until the end of the film, in a scene in which Laurent Gamelon exclaims “That&#x27;s epanadiplosis.”, standing next to a horse. Most of Patrick Schulmann&#x27;s films form an epanadiplosis.
* Forrest Gump begins and ends with a shot of a feather twirling in the wind.
* La Vie d&#x27;Adèle begins with the heroine leaving her home as a teenager, walking down the street to catch her bus, and ends with Adèle leaving an exhibition as an adult, walking down the street to return home from the same angle.
* Ma place au soleil begins and ends with shots of a cyclist riding through Paris.
* Lean On: in the video clip for this song by Major Lazer with DJ Snake and MØ, directed by Tim Erem, the first and last scenes of the clip are an ascending and descending view of the rose window on the ceiling of the palace bedroom.
* Roman Polanski&#x27;s films make frequent use of epanadiplosis (or rather, anaplodiplosis) to ensure narrative coherence: in &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot;, the sleigh-racing scene inverts the fight against the vampires into the vampires&#x27; contaminating victory; the concert scene in &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; or &quot;The Pianist&quot; measures the gap between two seemingly similar scenes, but fundamentally different in the narrative of warlike violence that separates them.
* Ridley Scott&#x27;s opens and closes with the same piece of music by Wagner.
* The film 1917 opens and closes, some 24 hours apart, with the same character dozing against a tree.
* The first episode of The Middle series opens with an illustration of a plane flying over the state of Indiana, and a steward inviting his passengers to look out of the windows. The same plane appears in the final seconds of the last episode of the final season.
* The film &quot;À couteaux tirés&quot; opens and closes with a shot of a mug bearing the words “My house, my rules, my coffee”.
* At the start of Marcel Pagnol&#x27;s film &quot;Topaze&quot;, the honest schoolteacher Topaze is giving dictation to a child who has remained in the classroom. Glancing at the pupil&#x27;s copy, Topaze sees mistakes and wants to help him spell the word moutons correctly: “c&#x27;est-à-dire qu&#x27;il n&#x27;y avait pas qu&#x27;un moutonne, il y avait plusieurs moutonssses”. At the end of the film, Topaze, now a swindler, glances at the notes his mistress has just taken about their projects in Morocco - marble quarries, phosphates, olive trees, sheep - and replies: “c&#x27;est-à-dire qu&#x27;il n&#x27;y a pas qu&#x27;un moutonne, il y a plusieurs moutonssses”.

=== Music ===
For Anne Quesemand, epanadiplosis is a resource for melodic effects in nursery rhymes, as in Alouette:“Alouette, gentil alouette! Alouette je te plumerai...”.

=== Comic strip ===
In the album Bouge tranquille, from the &quot;Génie des alpages&quot; series, by F&#x27;murr, in the story “Homéotéleute, Tragédie en cinq actes de monsieur Corneille”, Épanadiplose is Homéotéleute&#x27;s sister and expresses herself only in epanadiploses.

In Moebius and Jodorowsky&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incal&quot; series, the story begins and ends with the fall of hero John Difool into the well of &quot;Suicide Alley&quot;.

<doc id="1243736" wikidata="Q1151194" url="?curid=1243736" title="Dwight Freeney">
<text>Dwight Jason Freeney (born February 18, 1980) is an American former professional football player who played as a defensive end and linebacker for 16 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), most notably as a member of the Indianapolis Colts. He played college football for the Syracuse Orange, earning unanimous All-American honors. He was selected by the Colts in the first round of the 2002 NFL draft. With the Colts, Freeney won Super Bowl XLI over the Chicago Bears, and made seven Pro Bowls. He also played for the San Diego Chargers, Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions.

==Early life==
Freeney was born in Hartford, Connecticut. He attended Bloomfield High School in Bloomfield, Connecticut. Freeney was a four-sport letterman, earning four letters in baseball in which he was coached by Alphonso Ford; four in basketball; three in football, in which he played both ways; and one in soccer, in which he played goalie in his freshman year before switching over to football. Freeney holds the record for sacks at his high school and used to hold the record for most sacks in a high school career in the Connecticut record book. (Record now held by Mark Evanchick of Darien HS) Bloomfield High retired his No. 44 football jersey. During his youth, Freeney idolized New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor.

==College career==
Freeney received an athletic scholarship to attend Syracuse University, where he played for the Orange from 1998 to 2001. A two-year starter for Syracuse, he set a school record with 17.5 sacks in his senior season and his 34 career sacks rank second in school history to Tim Green (45.5). Freeney was the school&#x27;s premier pass rusher, and once had a string of 17 consecutive games with at least one sack. Against Virginia Tech, Freeney sacked elusive Hokies quarterback Michael Vick 4.5 times in one game.

Freeney finished his college career with 104 tackles (68 unassisted), 34 quarterback sacks, 51 tackles for a loss, and 43 quarterback pressures. He was a first-team All-Big East Conference selection in 2000 and 2001, and was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American following his senior season in 2001. He finished 9th in the final Heisman Trophy voting.

While attending Syracuse at a then 255-pounds, Freeney was clocked at 4.40 seconds during his 40-yard dash, and recorded 40-inch vertical jump. His 40-yard time remains among the fastest ever recorded for a defensive lineman.

Freeney still returns to Syracuse for his summer workouts, and serves as mentor to Syracuse players.

Freeney was inducted into the 2023 class of College Football Hall of Fame, becoming the 10th Syracuse player to be selected for the honor.

==Professional career==

===Indianapolis Colts===
Freeney was selected by the Indianapolis Colts with the 11th selection in the 2002 NFL draft. When drafted by Indianapolis at 270 lbs, Freeney was clocked at 4.48 seconds in the 40-yard dash and the same 40 inch vertical jump.

Freeney set an NFL rookie record in 2002 with nine forced fumbles, three of which occurred in a single game against former Syracuse football player, Donovan McNabb. Freeney was the runner up for the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award to Julius Peppers. He was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team.

In 2004, Freeney&#x27;s third season, he led the NFL with 16 sacks. At the end of his third season, Freeney&#x27;s season marked him as the 3rd fastest player to achieve 40 sacks. He developed a spin move which became his trademark pass rush move. He was named to his second Pro Bowl and earned first team All-Pro honors for his performance in the 2004 season.

In 2006, Freeney helped the Colts defeat the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI to become NFL Champions. He had a fumble recovery in the game.

On February 19, 2007, the Colts placed the franchise tag on Freeney following the expiration of his rookie contract. This move allowed Bill Polian and the Colts front office time to work on a long-term contract. On July 13, 2007, Freeney signed a six-year, $72 million contract with $30 million in guarantees making Freeney one of the highest paid defensive players in the NFL.

Freeney was fined $20,000 by the NFL for his expletive-laced interview following the end of the Colts 2008–09 playoff campaign which ended with a 23–17 overtime playoff loss to the San Diego Chargers in the Wild Card Round. The NFL cited Freeney for making &quot;inappropriate comments on officiating,&quot; according to the Indianapolis Star. Freeney, frustrated by the three defensive penalties incurred as the Chargers made their game-winning drive, told Yahoo! Sports after the game: &quot;Those were the worst fucking calls I&#x27;ve seen in a long time ... To have a game of that magnitude taken out of your hands, it&#x27;s just disgusting. It&#x27;s not like they made one fucking bad call -- it&#x27;s three calls, in overtime ... They need to start investigating some other shit.&quot;

For his performance in the 2009 season, Freeney earned his fifth Pro Bowl appearance and earned first team All-Pro honors for the third time. He was ranked 15th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

In 2012, Freeney converted from defensive end to outside linebacker under new head coach Chuck Pagano. Due to injury and not adjusting to his position-change well, Freeney struggled and finished the season with only five sacks and 12 tackles.

On February 15, 2013, Freeney was told he would not be re-signed by the Colts. Freeney left as the all-time franchise leader in sacks with 107.5, but was surpassed by former teammate Robert Mathis the next season. Mathis would also break Freeney&#x27;s franchise season record of 16 sacks the following season, too, when he tallied 19.5.

===San Diego Chargers===
On May 18, 2013, Freeney signed a two-year deal with the San Diego Chargers. During the 2013 season, Freeney suffered a season-ending quad injury against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 4 and recorded a career low with 0.5 sacks.

In 2014, Freeney looked to bounce back from the previous year and did. Throughout the season, Freeney was only used as a pass rush specialist coming out only on passing downs. Against the Seattle Seahawks Freeney sacked Russell Wilson, which contributed to a Chargers victory. The next week, Freeney got a sack against the Buffalo Bills. Against the 49ers, Dwight Freeney and Ricardo Mathews sacked and forced a Colin Kaepernick fumble leading to a Chargers touchdown. The next week recorded one sack against Chase Daniel and the Chiefs. Freeney finished the season with 10 tackles, 3.5 sacks, and a pass deflect.

===Arizona Cardinals===
On October 12, 2015, Freeney signed a one-year, $870,000 deal with the Arizona Cardinals, with the incentive to receive a $200,000 bonus with four sacks and then would receive $100,000 for each sack thereafter, with a maximum of 12.

Freeney was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week for Week 16, in which he had three sacks and a forced fumble, the first time he had three sacks in a game since 2006. Coincidentally, former Colts teammate Robert Mathis won AFC Defensive Player of the Week for the same week. Freeney appeared in nine games during the 2015 season, totaling 8.0 sacks (leading the team) and three forced fumbles.

===Atlanta Falcons===

On August 2, 2016, Freeney signed a one-year deal with the Atlanta Falcons. He played in 15 games, totaling three sacks. The Falcons won the NFC Championship to advance to Super Bowl LI, bringing Freeney to his third career Super Bowl. Freeney had one sack in the big game, although the Falcons lost to the Patriots by a score of 34–28.

===Seattle Seahawks===
On October 24, 2017, Freeney signed a one-year deal with the Seattle Seahawks. After playing in four games recording three sacks, Freeney was released by the Seahawks on November 21, 2017.

===Detroit Lions===
On November 22, 2017, Freeney was claimed off waivers by the Detroit Lions. He played in five games with the team.

===Retirement===
Freeney announced his retirement on April 19, 2018, after signing a ceremonial one-day contract with the Colts to retire as a member of the team he spent the majority of his career with. On February 8, 2024, Freeney was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal life==
On March 28, 2012, Freeney&#x27;s financial advisor was arrested and charged with embezzling $2.2 million from Freeney. In 2015, Freeney sued Bank of America for $20 million, claiming he trusted the bank&#x27;s wealth management division with the assets. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed.

<text>Sir Robert Hogg Matthew (12 December 1906 – 2 June 1975) was a Scottish architect and a leading proponent of modernism.

== Early life and studies ==

Robert Matthew was the son of John Fraser Matthew (1875–1955) (also an architect, and the partner of Sir Robert Lorimer) and his wife, Annie Broadfoot Hogg.

From 1920 the family lived at 43 Minto Street ironically the epitome of Georgian classicism rather than modern architecture.

Robert was born and brought up in Edinburgh, was educated at Edinburgh Institution and attended the Edinburgh College of Art where he studied under John Begg.

==Family life==
In 1931 Matthew married Lorna Pilcher. They had three children: Robert Aidan Matthew, born in July 1936, Janet Frances Catriona Matthew, born in March 1939, and Jessie Ann Matthew born in June 1952. From 1939 they lived at 12 Darnaway Street, Edinburgh and from 1956 they lived at Keith Marischal House, Humbie, East Lothian.

== Career ==
Robert was apprenticed with his father&#x27;s firm. Then in 1936, he joined the Department of Health for Scotland, as assistant to John Wilson, where, by 1945, he replaced Wilson as Chief Architect and Planning Officer. He was stranded in Sweden for VE Day. However he spent the time designing kits for prefabricated houses which conformed to the recommendations of the 1944 UK government report &quot;Planning our New Homes&quot;. This led to the importation of over 2,000 Swedish post-war prefabricated houses.

In 1946 Matthew moved to London, becoming Chief Architect and Planning Officer to the London County Council, where he served from 1946 to 1953, working on the post-war reconstruction of Greater London and masterminding the Festival of Britain including such buildings as the Royal Festival Hall, 1951. It was during these formative postwar years that the LCC&#x27;s housing and town planning policy established an international reputation, and many housing schemes (including the famous Roehampton housing estate) were created, as well as many schools.

In 1956 with Stirrat Johnson-Marshall, Robert Matthew established the firm of RMJM (Robert Matthew, Johnson Marshall) in Edinburgh and London. Their first project was New Zealand House in the Haymarket, London (now considered one of Matthew&#x27;s key buildings). In 1953 he returned to Edinburgh to become the first Professor of Architecture at the University of Edinburgh, where he established the new Department of Architecture in collaboration with RMJM, in a manner that has been compared to that of Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus. He continued as Professor there until 1968. The Matthew Architecture Gallery is now housed in the Department in his honour.

Matthew was closely involved with Basil Spence and Alan Reiach in the University&#x27;s development plan for George Square, which ultimately resulted in the demolition of buildings on three sides of the square, and their replacement with modernist structures. Matthew/RMJM were directly responsible for the design of the Arts Faculty buildings, now called 40 George Square (formerly David Hume Tower), the Adam Ferguson building and the William Robertson Building. 

In the early 1960s Matthew was involved in the replacement of overcrowded, insanitary tenement housing in Hutchesontown, Glasgow with high rise tower blocks. He worked alongside Basil Spence in the planning and design of the controversial Area C blocks in the Gorbals. Independently of Spence, RMJM designed the adjacent Area B estate which unlike the ill-fated Area C blocks, has survived and will become the only surviving high rise blocks in the Gorbals.
In Edinburgh he was also behind the Royal Commonwealth Pool, British Home Stores on Princes Street, Edinburgh Airport, Lothian Regional Council Building and Wester Hailes Education Centre.

Elsewhere Matthew/RMJM were both involved in the design for various academic campuses – one of his earliest commissions was the Tower Building for the University of Dundee in 1961 – at the time the tallest structure in the city. RMJM were also closely involved with the Royal College of Science and Technology in Glasgow, developing its campus masterplan in the early 1960s when it received its Royal Charter to become the University of Strathclyde, designing the Colville Building in tandem with Frank Fielden&#x27;s celebrated Architecture School in 1966.
Later the practice was involved with the University of Stirling and University of York. RMJM also contributed to Pakistan&#x27;s new capital buildings in Islamabad.

== Honours ==
During his studies Robert Matthew won the Pugin Student award (1929) and was Soane medallist (1932). He became a Fellow of the RIBA in 1955 and served as its President from 1962 to 1964. He was awarded an OBE in 1952 and knighted in 1962. He was later also President of the Commonwealth Association of Architects (CAA) and President of the International Union of Architects (UIA).

== Other arts ==
Apart from his work as an architect, Matthew produced drawings that were widely exhibited, and also paintings, although they are less well known. Both display the same aesthetic concerns as Le Corbusier, Pablo Picasso and Henry Moore all of whom he was able to count among his friends and colleagues.

<doc id="1243751" wikidata="Q945223" url="?curid=1243751" title="Kyle Field">
<text>Kyle Field is an American football stadium in College Station, Texas located on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University. It has been the home to the Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team in rudimentary form since 1904, and as a permanent concrete stadium since 1927. 
The seating capacity of 102,733 in 2021 makes it the largest in the Southeastern Conference and the fourth-largest stadium in the NCAA, the fourth-largest stadium in the United States, and the sixth-largest non-racing stadium in the world and the largest in Texas.

Kyle Field&#x27;s largest game attendance was 110,633 people when Texas A&amp;M lost to the Ole Miss Rebels by the score of 35–20 on October 11, 2014. This was the largest football game attendance in the state of Texas and SEC history at the time. The record for a game involving an SEC team was surpassed by the Battle at Bristol.

Kyle Field played host to the largest ticketed concert in United States history in June 2024, when George Strait played before a crowd exceeding 110,000. 

==History==
===Beginning===
In the fall of 1904, Edwin Jackson Kyle, an 1899 graduate of Texas A&amp;M and professor of horticulture, was named president of the General Athletics Association. Kyle wanted to secure and develop an athletic field to promote the school&#x27;s athletics. Texas A&amp;M was unwilling to provide funds, so Kyle fenced off a section of the southwest corner of campus that had been assigned to him for agricultural use. Using $650 of his own money, he purchased a covered grandstand from the Bryan fairgrounds and built wooden bleachers to raise the seating capacity to 500 people.

On November 11, 1904, the Texas A&amp;M Board of Directors set this area as a permanent athletic field, which served as the home for the football and baseball teams. After the stands were built, students supported naming the field after its founder and builder. Accordingly, in 1906, the Corps of Cadets unofficially named the field &quot;Kyle Field&quot; in Kyle&#x27;s honor.

Though some sources suggest the November 21, 1921 game between the Texas A&amp;M Aggies and their archrival the University of Texas at Kyle Field became the first college football game to offer a live, play-by-play broadcast on radio, this claim is incorrect. The first live, play-by-play broadcast on radio of a college football game occurred October 8, 1921 at Forbes Field when KDKA-AM broadcast a Pittsburgh vs. West Virginia game. The Texas Historical Commission installed a historical marker at Kyle Field in 2005 indicating that, while it was not the first broadcast in the US, it is believed to be the first in Texas.

===Facility improvements===
The Aggies enjoyed an undefeated season in 1919, accumulating a combined score of 275–0. Aggie supporters began to clamor for a permanent stadium, but only $2,400 was raised by 1920. In 1927, the school chose to build a new concrete stadium, at a cost of $345,001.67 or $365,000, depending on the source.

The new stadium—roughly corresponding to the lower half of the current structure&#x27;s east and west grandstands—opened later that year. By 1929, the stadium had become a 32,890-seat horseshoe, with temporary seating for an additional 5,000. The space inside the horseshoe was sufficient to allow a track surrounding the field. Capacity was raised to 41,500 in 1953 when a partial second deck and a pressbox were added at a cost of $346,000.

In 1956, the Texas A&amp;M Board of Regents officially named the stadium &quot;Kyle Field,&quot; though it had been unofficially called by that name for over half a century. Although some believe that the field was instead named after Dr. J. Allen Kyle, a member of the Board of Directors from 1911 to 1915, the Board of Directors decreed that Kyle Field was in fact named for E.J. Kyle (Class of 1899).

More of second deck and other improvements were added in 1967 to raise the capacity to 48,000 at a cost of $1.84 million. In 1974, two large flagpoles were added at the south end of the stadium in memory of Lt. William B. Blocker, (Texas A&amp;M Class of 1945).

Expansion continued in 1980, when a third deck was added to Kyle Field, bringing the capacity to 70,000. Construction took place during the football season, and students were allowed into the area as each row of seating was added. In 1981, letters spelling out &quot;KYLE FIELD&quot; were installed.

The Bernard C. Richardson Zone was added in 1999 at a cost of $32.9 million raising the capacity to 82,600. For high-demand games, temporary bleachers were installed in the south end zone and folding chairs were placed on the sidelines. In the fall of 2003, the Bright Football Complex was completed on the south end of the stadium. The facility (named for its principal donor, former Dallas Cowboys owner Bum Bright) includes a players&#x27; lounge overlooking Kyle Field, dressing rooms, one of the largest training and rehabilitation facilities in the country, and a state-of-the-art academic center.

The field had a grass playing surface until 1970, when Astroturf was installed. Natural turf was reinstalled on the field for the 1996 season. Since that time, the turf has consistently received praise from players and coaches. For their efforts, the groundskeepers were honored in 2004 as the winners of the STMA College Football Field of the Year.

====2013–2015 renovation====
On May 1, 2013, the Texas A&amp;M Board of Regents approved a $485 million rebuild of Kyle Field. The renovation would temporarily raise the official seating capacity to 106,511 people for the 2014 season, making it the largest football stadium in Texas and the SEC (surpassing Neyland Stadium by 57 seats) and the third largest football stadium in the country.

The renovation was done in two distinct phases geared around the football season, and began immediately after the conclusion of the final 2013 season game in November with the implosion of the student section side. The stadium renovation was complete by the beginning of the 2015 season bringing the official capacity to 102,733. Per local media, KBTX, major milestones for the Kyle Field project were as follows, with construction sequenced and phased to allow the playing of regular home football games in the stadium for the 2013, 2014, and 2015 seasons. The renovation was completed ahead of schedule and under budget.
* Phase I (November 2013): Demolition of the first deck of the east side of the stadium, reconstruction of the first deck, and construction of the south end zone, which includes seating, media interview areas, 12th Man Productions and related gameday support, and a commissary and recruiting area.
* Phase II (November 2014): Demolition of the entire west side of the stadium (including the last remnant of the original 1927 stadium), complete construction of the south end zone, and reconstruction of the west side.

Other significant items included in the scope of work for the Kyle Field redevelopment included: 
* Demolition of the Read Building, G. Rollie White Coliseum, and the Netum Steed strength and conditioning facility, all of which are adjacent to or part of Kyle Field
* Construction of a new strength and conditioning laboratory training area on the university&#x27;s west campus
* Lowering of the playing field by approximately 7 feet and relocation of the playing surface approximately 18 feet to the south allowing for an additional six rows of seating around the stadium
* Relocation of the existing south end zone scoreboard and video board reusing appropriate components to provide a scoreboard facility on the exterior of the north end zone structure: New interior scoreboard locations will be established in the south end zone and the northeast and northwest corners of the developed stadium.
* Construction of widened, tree-lined walkways along both sides of Houston Street from George Bush Drive to the stadium east mall area
* The new &quot;South Side Upper Level&quot; (with addition of an upper seating deck and concourse), has an estimated seating capacity of 12,000 with the future potential of an additional 7,000 seats, with seating to be located both below and above the new upper concourse.

===Notable events===

On November 26, 1999, just one week after the collapse of the Aggie Bonfire, the Aggies beat the 5th-ranked Texas Longhorns 20–16 in an emotional comeback game before a then-record crowd of 86,128. Another notable event occurred on September 22, 2001, 11 days after the September 11 attacks and the first game for the Aggies after the attacks, where the students organized a &quot;Red, White and Blue-Out&quot;. Students assigned each deck a different color (red on third deck, white on second deck, and blue on first deck) to wear for the game against Oklahoma State. Despite the short notice, attendees followed the instructions, resulting in a red, white, and blue stadium. More than $150,000 was raised in shirt sales, which was donated to FDNY charities.

Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s last Big 12 Conference football game and the last scheduled game against the University of Texas Longhorns occurred on November 24, 2011. Texas A&amp;M lost this game 27–25. Notably, this was the second time Texas A&amp;M lost their final game in a conference to the Texas Longhorns at Kyle Field - on December 2, 1995, they lost their final Southwest Conference Game to the Longhorns 16–6, in a game that decided the final SWC championship.

Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s first Southeastern Conference (SEC) football game occurred on September 8, 2012, against the University of Florida Gators.

On June 15, 2024, George Strait&#x27;s concert at Kyle Field became the most-attended (non-festival), ticketed show in US history, with 110,905 fans in attendance. The record was previously held by the Grateful Dead, who played for 107,019 people at Raceway Park in 1977.

==Intimidating venue==
Kyle Field has at times been regarded as one of the most intimidating college football stadiums in the nation by various media outlets and sportswriters. Contributing to its reputation in the 1990s, Texas A&amp;M boasted one of the nation&#x27;s best home records at 55–4–1, including 31 straight wins at Kyle Field from 1990 to 1995 and 22 straight from 1996 to 2000. From 2000 through 2015, however, the record of Texas A&amp;M at Kyle Field was 70–37 (a winning percentage of 65.4%, down from 93.2% in the 1990s). Unfortunately A&amp;M does have a losing record at home to The University of Texas (Longhorns). Which does bring into question just how intimidating the 12th man actually is. Through November 14, 2015, the overall Kyle Field record at the site of the playing field is 402–161–19 (70.7%) while the overall record since the stadium&#x27;s construction in 1927 is 334–156–12 (67.7%).

==Stadium features==


===Bernard C. Richardson Zone===
The Bernard C. Richardson Zone, named for a 1941 petroleum engineering graduate and a Texas A&amp;M Distinguished Alumnus, is located at the north end of Kyle Field, replacing the former single-deck horseshoe which connected the east and west wings of the stadium. This $32.9 million expansion added over 20,000 seats, and sits closer to the field than the previous seating. The Zone unofficially opened for the memorial vigil following the 1999 Texas A&amp;M Bonfire Collapse, and then at full capacity the next day for the grudge match against the University of Texas, setting a then-state-record of 86,128 fans attending. For the next several years the Aggies saw consecutive record-breaking attendance figures for the season.

The ground level of The Zone contains the Texas A&amp;M Sports Museum, the nation&#x27;s only all-sports museum funded primarily by former athletes (The Texas A&amp;M Letterman&#x27;s Association). The museum contains rotating exhibits focusing on various varsity sports at Texas A&amp;M, while permanent exhibits trace the history of the school sports and some of the more treasured traditions.

The Zone contains four levels of seating areas, with the first and fourth deck containing bench seating. One deck is comprised completely of luxury boxes, while the last deck is armchair seating. Known as The Zone Club, the 1,900 open-air armchair seats are considered the premier seating area of Kyle Field. The Zone Club sits underneath the fourth deck, meaning the inhabitants are protected from rain, wind, and the blazing Texas sun. The area boasts a full-service bar and concession areas, with a pre-game buffet offered for those with seats in the area. The Zone Club also has sixteen televisions stationed in various areas so that attendees can also keep an eye on other games being played around the country.

===Old press box===

The old Kyle Field press box was located at the top of the west deck of the stadium, sitting over above the field. The pressbox had two tiers, accommodating over 250 members of the press, with print journalists stationed in the upper tier and radio and television journalists sitting in the lower tier.

During the singing of the Aggie War Hymn, in which Aggie fans link arms and sway in unison throughout the stadium, the entire west upper deck (including the press box) actually swayed, even though the press box was supported by three concrete pillars. This often startled journalists who haven&#x27;t covered an Aggie home game before, even though a sign in the press box warned, &quot;Please do not be alarmed, the press box will move during the Aggie War Hymn.&quot; In 2003, the press box was declared a high-rise building, and Texas A&amp;M was forced to renovate it to meet federal, state, and local regulations regarding fire safety and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Renovations before the 2014 season lessened the swaying effect somewhat.

===12th Man TV===

During the 2006 offseason, the older Jumbotron was removed and replaced by a Mitsubishi Diamond Vision enhanced resolution LED videoboard in the south end zone, at the time the second largest in college athletics and one of the ten largest in the world. The Texas A&amp;M Athletic Department has dubbed the new screen &quot;12th Man TV&quot;, although some fans refer to it as the &quot;Gigatron&quot;. The structure contains 590,000 pixels on 154 video panels with a screen size of . The athletic department also updated the media equipment to allow production and broadcast of enhanced definition video to the screen. This addition to Kyle Field was accompanied by LED ribbon boards installed along the facade of the second deck encircling the stadium. At , it is the second-longest ribbon board in collegiate sports and second worldwide only to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. In conjunction with this project, additional upgrades included video board upgrades to Reed Arena and Olsen Field.

Unveiled in September 2014, an LED videoboard that is 47 by 163 feet () was installed at the south end zone above the new seating, remained as the largest in college athletics until Auburn unveiled a 57-by-190-foot, LED videoboard at Jordan–Hare Stadium which was completed in August 2015.

===Reveille cemetery===

When the first Aggie mascot, Reveille, died, she was buried at the north end of Kyle Field so that the score of the Aggie football games was always visible from the site. Subsequent Reveilles were buried alongside her. Construction of the Bernard C. Richardson Zone disrupted the mascot graves, so the graves were temporarily moved across the street from the stadium. Following the completion of the addition, an improved graveyard was dedicated directly outside the Zone and a small electronic scoreboard was mounted on the Zone so that the score would remain visible. Traditionally, when a current or former Reveille died, a military funeral was held at Kyle Field. Over 10,000 people attended the service for Reveille IV. In 2013, Reveille VII, who was retired in May 2008, was given a toned-down memorial service at Reed Arena, rather than a funeral service. According to the Commandant of the Corps, as she is a dog, not a person, he did not believe a 21-gun salute or the playing of &quot;Taps&quot; was appropriate, although he had no involvement in the planning of the memorial service. Some fans were displeased with the changes. It was also announced that the bodies of the previous Reveilles will be exhumed as part of the Kyle Field renovations and relocated across the street, similar to what was done in the previous renovations.

==Other events held at Kyle Field==
During summers, young athletes are invited to Kyle Field for football training camps. In the fall, the stadium plays host to various Texas high school football playoff games. The stadium is the home to the Texas A&amp;M Corps of Cadets annual Parents&#x27; Weekend Review and Final Review. From 1990 to 2013 it was the venue for the &quot;Cross-Town Showdown&quot; high school football game between the Bryan Vikings and the A&amp;M Consolidated Tigers, arguably the most popular game of the Vikings/Tigers football season. Traditionally the last game of each team&#x27;s football schedule, beginning in the 2006 season, Texas A&amp;M University requested that the game be held earlier in the year so as not to interfere with Aggie games. In 2013 due to the renovations including a new turf field; Texas A&amp;M requested the Bryan Vikings vs. A&amp;M Consolidated game be held at their home fields beginning 2014 until the renovations are completed. Kyle Field also hosts the Texas A&amp;M University football team for the Maroon &amp; White practice scrimmage during Parent&#x27;s Weekend each spring.

On June 8, 2024, in preparation for the upcoming 2024 Copa América in the United States, Mexico played a friendly match with Brazil in Kyle Field&#x27;s first international soccer game in front of 85,249 fans, a 3–2 win in favor of the Brazilians.

Country singer George Strait performed at Kyle Field on June 15, 2024, setting a new attendance record at 110,905 spectators.

<doc id="1243754" wikidata="Q6226305" url="?curid=1243754" title="John Cleary (Canadian politician)">
<text>John Cleary (August 31, 1932 – October 7, 2012) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 2003 who represented the ridings of Cornwall and Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh.

==Background==
Cleary was born in Cornwall, Ontario, and was educated at St. Lawrence College. Elected as a councillor in Cornwall Township in 1972, he became the township&#x27;s deputy reeve in 1974 and its reeve in 1976, serving in the latter capacity until 1987. He was chosen as warden for his region in 1983, and also served on the regional conservation authority from 1974 to 1987. Cleary died on October 7, 2012, in Cornwall and survived by his wife Elizabeth.

==Politics==
Cleary was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1987 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Luc Guindon in the Cornwall riding by about 1,000 votes. The Liberals won a majority government in this region, and Cleary served as a government backbencher for the next three years. The Liberals were defeated by the Ontario New Democratic Party in the 1990 election, although Cleary managed to retain his own riding by an increased margin. In opposition, he served as his party&#x27;s Agriculture Critic for the next five years. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in the 1995 election, though Cleary managed to increase his majority again in Cornwall. He continued serving as his party&#x27;s agriculture critic until 1996, when he was shifted to rural affairs.

Cleary faced the most difficult re-election battle of his career in the provincial election of 1999, in which redistribution forced him to face longstanding Progressive Conservative MP Noble Villeneuve in the riding of Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh. Cleary eventually won the contest by 630 votes; most of the urban vote favoured him, while most of the rural vote favoured Villeneuve. He continued serving as his party&#x27;s rural affairs critic until 2003, when he retired from the legislature. He also supported calls for a public inquiry into reports of an organized pedophile ring in the Cornwall area.

Although not a skilled public speaker or a leading figure in the Liberal Party, Cleary was generally regarded as a good community representative during his time in the legislature. He was not considered to be an especially partisan figure, and in fact criticized party leader Dalton McGuinty for his personal attacks on Mike Harris in 1999. Cleary also held socially conservative views on some issues, including abortion.

<doc id="1243763" wikidata="Q578791" url="?curid=1243763" title="Prince Jean, Duke of Guise">
<text>Jean d&#x27;Orléans (Jean Pierre Clément Marie; 4 September 1874 – 25 August 1940) was Orléanist pretender to the defunct French throne as Jean III. He used the courtesy title of Duke of Guise.

He was the third son and youngest child of Prince Robert, Duke of Chartres (1840–1910), and grandson of Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans and great-grandson of Louis Philippe I, King of the French. His mother was Princess Françoise of Orléans, daughter of François, Prince of Joinville and Princess Francisca of Brazil.

==Biography==
In 1926 at the death of his cousin and brother-in-law Philippe, Duke of Orléans, claimant to the defunct throne of France as &quot;Philip VIII&quot;, Jean was recognised by his Orléanist supporters as titular king of France with the name &quot;Jean III&quot;. 

Jean was an amateur historian and archeologist, who lived with his family in a large farm near Rabat, Morocco. Following his &quot;ascension&quot; as Orléanist pretender, he and his eldest son were legally forbidden from ever entering France again, due to an 1886 edict which condemned the heads of Bourbon &amp; Bonaparte dynasties, as well as their heirs apparent, to exile.

In 1892, Jean passed the entrance exam for the Royal Danish Military Academy and joined the Royal Life Guards. He continued to serve in the Royal Danish Army until 1899, where he was made captain .

Jean died in Larache, Morocco, in 1940. He was succeeded as Orléanist claimant to the defunct French throne by his only son, Henri d&#x27; Orléans, Count of Paris. 

===Marriage and issue===

In 1899, Jean married his first cousin, Isabelle d&#x27;Orléans (1878–1961). She was the younger sister of Philip VIII, and the daughter of Philip VII and Marie Isabelle d&#x27;Orléans.

They had four children:

*Isabelle d&#x27;Orléans (1900–1983). First married in 1923 to Marie Hervé Jean Bruno, Count of Harcourt (1899–1930) and then to Prince Pierre Murat in 1934.
*Françoise d&#x27;Orléans (1902–1953). Married to Christopher of Greece and Denmark in 1929. He was a son of George I of Greece and Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia. They were parents of Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark.
*Anne d&#x27;Orléans (1906–1986). She married Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta in 1927.
*Henri d&#x27;Orléans, Count of Paris (1908–1999). Married to Princess Isabelle of Orléans-Braganza.

<text>The Time Traveller was one of the earliest science-fiction fanzines, started in 1932. The title was inspired by the protagonist of &quot;The Time Machine&quot; by H.G. Wells.

== History ==
&quot;The Time Traveller&quot; grew out of a New York City fan club called The Scienceers and was started by Mort Weisinger, Julius Schwartz, Allen Glasser, and Forrest J Ackerman. Initially, Glasser was the &quot;Editor&quot; of the fanzine, Weisinger &quot;Associate Editor,&quot; Schwartz &quot;Managing Editor,&quot; and Ackerman &quot;Contributing Editor.&quot; (Three of the four editors were 15–17 years old at the time. Allen Glasser was born in 1908.)

According to SF historian Sam Moskowitz, &quot;The Time Traveller&quot; was the first fanzine to be devoted exclusively to science fiction. It was also the first fanzine not strictly associated with a club and, starting with its third issue, the first to be typeset.

The publication went through a two major changes. First, beginning in late 1932, the fanzine was absorbed by &quot;Science Fiction Digest&quot;, which was founded by earlier &quot;Time Traveller&quot; editors Schwartz, Ackerman, and Weisinger. Then, in 1933, in an attempt to attract more readers interested in weird fiction, &quot;SFD&quot; became &quot;Fantasy Magazine&quot;. It ceased publication in January 1937.

The fanzine&#x27;s chief claim to fame was its publication of a 17-part round-robin story called &quot;Cosmos&quot; (July 1933 – December 1934), each part written by a different writer. The roster of &quot;Cosmos&quot; writers included many of the leading lights of SF, fantasy, horror, and adventure fiction in that era, including A. Merritt, E.E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith, Edmond Hamilton, John W. Campbell, E. Hoffmann Price, and Otis Adelbert Kline. The others involved were David H. Keller, P. Schuyler Miller, Arthur J. Burks, Ralph Milne Farley, &quot;Eando Binder,&quot; Francis Flagg, Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, Bob Olsen, J. Harvey Haggard, and Abner J. Gelula; Raymond A. Palmer wrote one installment under his own name, and another under the pseudonym &quot;Rae Winters.&quot; Hamilton composed the final episode of the serial, and finished with a bang, destroying the planets Pluto, Neptune, and Uranus with an atomic disintegrator ray.

<text>A horn antenna or microwave horn is an antenna that consists of a flaring metal waveguide shaped like a horn to direct radio waves in a beam. Horns are widely used as antennas at UHF and microwave frequencies, above 300 MHz. They are used as feed antennas (called feed horns) for larger antenna structures such as parabolic antennas, as standard calibration antennas to measure the gain of other antennas, and as directive antennas for such devices as radar guns, automatic door openers, and microwave radiometers. Their advantages are moderate directivity, broad bandwidth, low losses, and simple construction and adjustment.

One of the first horn antennas was constructed in 1897 by Bengali-Indian radio researcher Jagadish Chandra Bose in his pioneering experiments with microwaves. The modern horn antenna was invented independently in 1938 by Wilmer Barrow and G. C. Southworth The development of radar in World War II stimulated horn research to design feed horns for radar antennas. The corrugated horn invented by Kay in 1962 has become widely used as a feed horn for microwave antennas such as satellite dishes and radio telescopes.

An advantage of horn antennas is that since they have no resonant elements, they can operate over a wide range of frequencies, a wide bandwidth. The usable bandwidth of horn antennas is typically of the order of 10:1, and can be up to 20:1 (for example allowing it to operate from 1 GHz to 20 GHz). The input impedance is slowly varying over this wide frequency range, allowing low voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) over the bandwidth. The gain of horn antennas ranges up to 25 dBi, with 10–20 dBi being typical.

== Description ==
A horn antenna is used to transmit radio waves from a waveguide (a metal pipe used to carry radio waves) out into space, or collect radio waves into a waveguide for reception. It typically consists of a short length of rectangular or cylindrical metal tube (the waveguide), closed at one end, flaring into an open-ended conical or pyramidal shaped horn on the other end. The radio waves are usually introduced into the waveguide by a coaxial cable attached to the side, with the central conductor projecting into the waveguide to form a quarter-wave monopole antenna. The waves then radiate out the horn end in a narrow beam. In some equipment the radio waves are conducted between the transmitter or receiver and the antenna by a waveguide; in this case the horn is attached to the end of the waveguide. In outdoor horns, such as the feed horns of satellite dishes, the open mouth of the horn is often covered by a plastic sheet transparent to radio waves, to exclude moisture.

== How it works ==
A horn antenna serves the same function for electromagnetic waves that an acoustical horn does for sound waves in a musical instrument such as a trumpet. It provides a gradual transition structure to match the impedance of a tube to the impedance of free space, enabling the waves from the tube to radiate efficiently into space.

If a simple open-ended waveguide is used as an antenna, without the horn, the sudden end of the conductive walls causes an abrupt impedance change at the aperture, from the wave impedance in the waveguide to the impedance of free space, (about 377 Ω). When radio waves travelling through the waveguide hit the opening, this impedance-step reflects a significant fraction of the wave energy back down the guide toward the source, so that not all of the power is radiated. This is similar to the reflection at an open-ended transmission line or a boundary between optical mediums with a low and high index of refraction, like at a glass surface. The reflected waves cause standing waves in the waveguide, increasing the SWR, wasting energy and possibly overheating the transmitter. In addition, the small aperture of the waveguide (less than one wavelength) causes significant diffraction of the waves issuing from it, resulting in a wide radiation pattern without much directivity.

To improve these poor characteristics, the ends of the waveguide are flared out to form a horn. The taper of the horn changes the impedance gradually along the horn&#x27;s length. This acts like an impedance matching transformer, allowing most of the wave energy to radiate out the end of the horn into space, with minimal reflection. The taper functions similarly to a tapered transmission line, or an optical medium with a smoothly varying refractive index. In addition, the wide aperture of the horn projects the waves in a narrow beam.

The horn shape that gives minimum reflected power is an exponential taper. Exponential horns are used in special applications that require minimum signal loss, such as satellite antennas and radio telescopes. However conical and pyramidal horns are most widely used, because they have straight sides and are easier to design and fabricate.

== Radiation pattern ==

The waves travel down a horn as spherical wavefronts, with their origin at the apex of the horn, a point called the phase center. The pattern of electric and magnetic fields at the aperture plane at the mouth of the horn, which determines the radiation pattern, is a scaled-up reproduction of the fields in the waveguide. Because the wavefronts are spherical, the phase increases smoothly from the edges of the aperture plane to the center, because of the difference in length of the center point and the edge points from the apex point. The difference in phase between the center point and the edges is called the &quot;phase error&quot;. This phase error, which increases with the flare angle, reduces the gain and increases the beamwidth, giving horns wider beamwidths than similar-sized plane-wave antennas such as parabolic dishes.

At the flare angle, the radiation of the beam lobe is down about 20 dB from its maximum value.

As the size of a horn (expressed in wavelengths) is increased, the phase error increases, giving the horn a wider radiation pattern. Keeping the beamwidth narrow requires a longer horn (smaller flare angle) to keep the phase error constant. The increasing phase error limits the aperture size of practical horns to about 15 wavelengths; larger apertures would require impractically long horns. This limits the gain of practical horns to about 1000 (30 dBi) and the corresponding minimum beamwidth to about 5–10°.

==Types==

Below are the main types of horn antennas. Horns can have different flare angles as well as different expansion curves (elliptic, hyperbolic, etc.) in the E-field and H-field directions, making possible a wide variety of different beam profiles.
:Pyramidal horn (fig. a) – a horn antenna with the horn in the shape of a four-sided pyramid, with a rectangular cross section. They are a common type, used with rectangular waveguides, and radiate linearly polarized radio waves.
:Sectoral horn – A pyramidal horn with only one pair of sides flared and the other pair parallel. It produces a fan-shaped beam, which is narrow in the plane of the flared sides, but wide in the plane of the narrow sides. These types are often used as feed horns for wide search radar antennas.
::E-plane horn (fig. b) – A sectoral horn flared in the direction of the electric or E-field in the waveguide.
::H-plane horn (fig. c) – A sectoral horn flared in the direction of the magnetic or H-field in the waveguide.
:Conical horn (fig. d) – A horn in the shape of a cone, with a circular cross section. They are used with cylindrical waveguides.
:Exponential horn (fig. e) – A horn with curved sides, in which the separation of the sides increases as an exponential function of length. Also called a scalar horn, they can have pyramidal or conical cross sections. Exponential horns have minimum internal reflections, and almost constant impedance and other characteristics over a wide frequency range. They are used in applications requiring high performance, such as feed horns for communication satellite antennas and radio telescopes. 
:Corrugated horn – A horn with parallel slots or grooves, small compared with a wavelength, covering the inside surface of the horn, transverse to the axis. Corrugated horns have wider bandwidth and smaller sidelobes and cross-polarization, and are widely used as feed horns for satellite dishes and radio telescopes.
:Dual-mode conical horn – (The Potter horn ) This horn can be used to replace the corrugated horn for use at sub-mm wavelengths where the corrugated horn is lossy and difficult to fabricate.
:Diagonal horn – This simple dual-mode horn superficially looks like a pyramidal horn with a square output aperture. On closer inspection, however, the square output aperture is seen to be rotated 45° relative to the waveguide. These horns are typically machined into split blocks and used at sub-mm wavelengths.
:Ridged horn – A pyramidal horn with ridges or fins attached to the inside of the horn, extending down the center of the sides. The fins lower the cutoff frequency, increasing the antenna&#x27;s bandwidth.
:Septum horn – A horn which is divided into several subhorns by metal partitions (septums) inside, attached to opposite walls.
:Aperture-limited horn – a long narrow horn, long enough so the phase error is a negligible fraction of a wavelength, so it essentially radiates a plane wave. It has an aperture efficiency of 1.0 so it gives the maximum gain and minimum beamwidth for a given aperture size. The gain is not affected by the length but only limited by diffraction at the aperture. Used as feed horns in radio telescopes and other high-resolution antennas.
:Open boundary quad-ridged horn – A special type of horn antenna designed as a four-pronged structure with open boundaries. It covers width the frequency range and polarization is dual linear.
:Open boundary double-ridged horn – Similar to the open boundary quad-ridged horn above. It was designed to operate over a wide frequency range, low VSWR, and high gain.

== Optimum horn ==

For a given frequency and horn length, there is some flare angle that gives minimum reflection and maximum gain. The internal reflections in straight-sided horns come from the two locations along the wave path where the impedance changes abruptly; the mouth or aperture of the horn, and the throat where the sides begin to flare out. The amount of reflection at these two sites varies with the &quot;flare angle&quot; of the horn (the angle the sides make with the axis). In narrow horns with small flare angles most of the reflection occurs at the mouth of the horn. The gain of the antenna is low because the small mouth approximates an open-ended waveguide, with a large impedance step. As the angle is increased, the reflection at the mouth decreases rapidly and the antenna&#x27;s gain increases. In contrast, in wide horns with flare angles approaching 90° most of the reflection is at the throat. The horn&#x27;s gain is again low because the throat approximates an open-ended waveguide. As the angle is decreased, the amount of reflection at this site drops, and the horn&#x27;s gain again increases.

This discussion shows that there is some flare angle between 0° and 90° which gives maximum gain and minimum reflection. This is called the &quot;optimum horn&quot;. Most practical horn antennas are designed as optimum horns. In a pyramidal horn, the dimensions that give an optimum horn are:

:formula_1

For a conical horn, the dimensions that give an optimum horn are:

:formula_2

where
:&quot;aE&quot; is the width of the aperture in the E-field direction
:&quot;aH&quot; is the width of the aperture in the H-field direction
:&quot;LE&quot; is the slant height of the side in the E-field direction
:&quot;LH&quot; is the slant height of the side in the H-field direction
:&quot;d&quot; is the diameter of the cylindrical horn aperture
:&quot;L&quot; is the slant height of the cone from the apex
:&quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength

An optimum horn does not yield maximum gain for a given &quot;aperture size&quot;. That is achieved with a very long horn (an &quot;aperture limited&quot; horn). The optimum horn yields maximum gain for a given horn &quot;length&quot;. Tables showing dimensions for optimum horns for various frequencies are given in microwave handbooks.

== Gain ==
Horns have very little loss, so the directivity of a horn is roughly equal to its gain. The gain &quot;G&quot; of a pyramidal horn antenna (the ratio of the radiated power intensity along its beam axis to the intensity of an isotropic antenna with the same input power) is:

:formula_3

For conical horns, the gain is:

:formula_4

where
:&quot;A&quot; is the area of the aperture,
:&quot;d&quot; is the aperture diameter of a conical horn
:&quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength,
:&quot;eA&quot; is a dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1 called the &quot;aperture efficiency&quot;,

The aperture efficiency ranges from 0.4 to 0.8 in practical horn antennas. For optimum pyramidal horns, &quot;eA&quot; = 0.511., while for optimum conical horns &quot;eA&quot; = 0.522. So an approximate figure of 0.5 is often used. The aperture efficiency increases with the length of the horn, and for aperture-limited horns is approximately unity.

==Horn-reflector antenna==

A type of antenna that combines a horn with a parabolic reflector is known as a Hogg-horn, or horn-reflector antenna, invented by Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941 and further developed by David C. Hogg at Bell Labs in 1961. It is also referred to as the &quot;sugar scoop&quot; due to its characteristic shape. It consists of a horn antenna with a reflector mounted in the mouth of the horn at a 45 degree angle so the radiated beam is at right angles to the horn axis. The reflector is a segment of a parabolic reflector, and the focus of the reflector is at the apex of the horn, so the device is equivalent to a parabolic antenna fed off-axis. The advantage of this design over a standard parabolic antenna is that the horn shields the antenna from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis, so its radiation pattern has very small sidelobes. Also, the aperture isn&#x27;t partially obstructed by the feed and its supports, as with ordinary front-fed parabolic dishes, allowing it to achieve aperture efficiencies of 70% as opposed to 55–60% for front-fed dishes. The disadvantage is that it is far larger and heavier for a given aperture area than a parabolic dish, and must be mounted on a cumbersome turntable to be fully steerable. This design was used for a few radio telescopes and communication satellite ground antennas during the 1960s. Its largest use, however, was as fixed antennas for microwave relay links in the AT&amp;T Long Lines microwave network. Since the 1970s this design has been superseded by shrouded parabolic dish antennas, which can achieve equally good sidelobe performance with a lighter more compact construction. Probably the most photographed and well-known example is the Holmdel Horn Antenna at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, with which Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965, for which they won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics. Another more recent horn-reflector design is the cass-horn, which is a combination of a horn with a cassegrain parabolic antenna using two reflectors.

<text>A horn is a permanent pointed projection on the head of various animals that consists of a covering of keratin and other proteins surrounding a core of live bone. Horns are distinct from antlers, which are not permanent. 
In mammals, true horns are found mainly among the ruminant artiodactyls, in the families Antilocapridae (pronghorn) and Bovidae (cattle, goats, antelope etc.). Cattle horns arise from subcutaneous connective tissue (under the scalp) and later fuse to the underlying frontal bone.

One pair of horns is usual; however, two or more pairs occur in a few wild species and in some domesticated breeds of sheep. Polycerate (multi-horned) sheep breeds include the Hebridean, Icelandic, Jacob, Manx Loaghtan, and the Navajo-Churro.

Horns usually have a curved or spiral shape, often with ridges or fluting. In many species, only males have horns. Horns start to grow soon after birth and continue to grow throughout the life of the animal (except in pronghorns, which shed the outer layer annually, but retain the bony core). Partial or deformed horns in livestock are called scurs. Similar growths on other parts of the body are not usually called horns, but spurs, claws, or hooves, depending on the part of the body on which they occur.

==Types of horns==
*Bighorn sheep have backward-sweeping, forward-curving horns.
*Bison have upward-curving horns that grow from the sides of the head.
*Mountain goats have curved horns that taper backward from the forehead and can be up to long.

==Other hornlike growths==
The term &quot;horn&quot; is also popularly applied to other hard and pointed features attached to the head of animals in various other families:

* Giraffidae: Giraffes have one or more pairs of bony bumps on their heads, called ossicones. These are covered with furred skin.
* Cervidae: Most deer have antlers, which are not true horns and made of bone. When fully developed, antlers are dead bone without a horn or skin covering; they are borne only by adults (usually males, except for reindeer) and are shed and regrown each year.
* Rhinocerotidae: The &quot;horns&quot; of rhinoceroses are made of keratin, the same substance as fingernails, and grow continuously, but do not have a bone core.
* Chamaeleonidae: Many chameleons, most notably the Jackson&#x27;s chameleon, possess horns on their skulls, and have a keratin covering.
* Ceratopsidae: The &quot;horns&quot; of the &quot;Triceratops&quot; were extensions of its skull bones, although debate exists over whether they had a keratin covering.
* Abelisauridae: Various abelisaurid theropods, such as &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; and &quot;Majungasaurus&quot; possessed extensions of the frontal bone which were likely covered in some form of keratinous integument.
* Horned lizards (&quot;Phrynosoma&quot;): These lizards have horns on their heads which have a hard keratin covering over a bony core, like mammalian horns.
* Insects: Some insects (such as rhinoceros beetles) have hornlike structures on the head or thorax (or both). These are pointed outgrowths of the hard chitinous exoskeleton. Some (such as stag beetles) have greatly enlarged jaws, also made of chitin.
* Canidae: Golden jackals were once thought to occasionally develop a horny growth on the skull, which is associated with magical powers in south-eastern Asia. Although no evidence of its existence has been found, it remains a common belief in South Asia.
* Azendohsauridae: the skull of the triassic azendohsaurid archosauromorph &quot;Shringasaurus&quot; possessed two massive, forward-facing conical horns, which were likely covered in cornified sheaths in life.
* Anhimidae: The horned screamer possesses an entirely keratinous spine, which is loosely connected to its skull.

Many mammal species in various families have tusks, which often serve the same functions as horns, but are in fact oversized teeth. These include the Moschidae (Musk deer, which are ruminants), Suidae (Wild Boars), Proboscidea (Elephants), Monodontidae (Narwhals) and Odobenidae (Walruses).
Polled animals or &quot;pollards&quot; are those of normally-horned (mainly domesticated) species whose horns have been removed, or which have not grown. In some cases such animals have small horny growths in the skin where their horns would be – these are known as &quot;scurs&quot;.

===On humans===
Cutaneous horns are the only examples of horns growing on people. 

Cases of people growing horns have been historically described, sometimes with mythical status. Researchers have not however discovered photographic evidence of the phenomenon. There are human cadaveric specimens that show outgrowings, but these are instead classified as osteomas or other s.

The phenomenon of humans with horns has been observed in countries lacking advanced medicine. There are living people, several in China, with cases of cutaneous horns, most common in the elderly.

Some people, notably The Enigma, have horn implants; that is, they have implanted silicone beneath the skin as a form of body modification.

==Animal uses of horns==
Animals have a variety of uses for horns and antlers, including defending themselves from predators and fighting members of their own species (&quot;horn fighting&quot;) for territory, dominance or mating priority. Horns are usually present only in males but in some species, females too may possess horns. It has been theorized by researchers that taller species living in the open are more visible from longer distances and more likely to benefit from horns to defend themselves against predators. Female bovids that are not hidden from predators due to their large size or open savannah-like habitat are more likely to bear horns than small or camouflaged species.

In addition, horns may be used to root in the soil or strip bark from trees. In animal courtship, many use horns in displays. For example, the male blue wildebeest reams the bark and branches of trees to impress the female and lure her into his territory. Some animals such as goats with true horns use them for cooling with the blood vessels in the bony core allowing them to function as a radiator.

After the death of a horned animal, the keratin may be consumed by the larvae of the horn moth.

===Horn fighting=== 

During horn fighting, two animals of the same species tilt their head towards one another. They then proceed to ram into each other.

For example, in bighorn sheep, when two males meet each other, each tilts its head towards each other to give a good view of the horns. If the horns are approximately the same size, the sheep may fight to establish dominance. However, if the horn of one sheep is larger than the other, the sheep with the smaller horns will generally back off. Those sheep are usually young sheep whose horns have not had enough time to grow.

==Human uses of horns==

*Horned animals are sometimes hunted so their mounted head or horns can be displayed as a hunting trophy or as decorative objects.
*Some cultures use bovid horns as musical instruments, for example, the shofar. These have evolved into brass instruments in which, unlike the trumpet, the bore gradually increases in width through most of its length—that is to say, it is conical rather than cylindrical. These are called horns, though now made of metal.
*Drinking horns are bovid horns removed from the bone core, cleaned, polished, and used as drinking vessels. (This is similar to the legend of the cornucopia.) It has been suggested that the shape of a natural horn was also the model for the rhyton, a horn-shaped drinking vessel.
*Powder horns were originally bovid horns fitted with lids and carrying straps, used to carry gunpowder. Powder flasks of any material may be referred to as powder horns.
*Shoehorns were originally made from slices of bovid horn, which provided the right curving shape and a smooth surface.
*Antelope horns are used in traditional Chinese medicine.
*Horns consist of keratin, and the term &quot;horn&quot; is used to refer to this material, sometimes including similarly solid keratin from other parts of animals, such as hoofs. Horn may be used as a material in tools, furniture and decoration, among other uses. In these applications, horn is valued for its hardness, and it has given rise to the expression &quot;hard as horn&quot;. Horn is somewhat thermoplastic and (like tortoiseshell) was formerly used for many purposes where plastic would now be used. Horn may be used to make glue.
*Horn bows are bows made from a combination of horn, sinew and usually wood. These materials allow more energy to be stored in a short bow than wood alone.
*Horns and horn tips from various animals have been used for centuries in the manufacture of scales, grips, or handles for knives and other weapons, and beginning in the 19th century, for the handle scales of handguns.
*Horn buttons may be made from horns, and historically also hooves which are a similar material. The non-bony part of the horn or hoof may be softened by heating to a temperature just above the boiling point of water, then molded in metal dies, or the hollow lower part of the horn may be slit spirally lengthwise and then flattened in a vise between wood boards, again after heating, and later cut with a holesaw or similar tool into round or other shaped blanks which are finished on a lathe or by hand. Toggle buttons are made by cutting off the solid tips of horns and perforating them. Antler buttons, and buttons made from hooves are not technically horn buttons, but are often referred to as such in popular parlance. Horns from cattle, water buffalo, and sheep are all used for commercial button making, and of other species as well, on a local and non-commercial basis. 
*Horn combs were common in the era before replacement by plastic, and are still made. 
*Horn needle cases and other small boxes, particularly of water buffalo horn, are still made. One occasionally finds horn used as a material in antique snuff boxes. 
*Horn strips for inlaying wood are a traditional technique.
*Carved horn hairpins and other jewelry such as brooches and rings are manufactured, particularly in Asia, including for the souvenir trade.
*Horn is used in artwork for small, detailed carvings. It is an easily worked and polished material, is strong and durable, and in the right variety, beautiful.
*Horn chopsticks are found in Asian countries from highland Nepal and Tibet to the Pacific coast. Typically they are not the common material, but rather are higher quality decorative articles. Similarly other horn flatware, notably spoons, continues to be manufactured for decorations and other purposes. 
*Long dice made of horn that have a rodlike elongated shape with four numbered faces and two small unnumbered end faces continue to be manufactured in Asia where they are traditionally used in games like Chaupar (Pachisi) and many others.
*Horn is sometimes found in walking sticks, cane handles, and shafts. In the latter use, the horn elements may be cut into short cylindrical segments held together by a metal core.
* Horned deities appear in various guises across many world religions and mythologies. 
* Horned helmets arise in different cultures, for ritual purposes rather than combat.
*Horns were treated and cut into strips to make semi-transparent windows in the vernacular architecture of the Medieval Ages.

==Dehorning==
In some instances, wildlife parks may decide to remove the horn of some animals (such as rhinos) as a preventive measure against poaching. Animal horns can be safely sawn off without hurting the animal (it is similar to clipping toe nails). When the animal were to be poached, the animal is generally killed as it is shot first. Park rangers however may decide to tranquilize the animal instead to remove the horn.

<text>The Atelinae are a subfamily of New World monkeys in the family Atelidae, and includes the various spider and woolly monkeys. The primary distinguishing feature of the atelines is their long prehensile tails, which can support their entire body weight.

Atelines live on the American continent from southern Mexico through central Brazil and Bolivia. Diurnal and arboreal, they move speedily and acrobatically through the trees using their tails. Atelines, along with the related howler monkeys, are the largest of the New World monkeys. They live in groups, show amicable intergroup relations, and can coalesce into large aggregations for extended periods of time.

Atelines are frugivore-folivores, their diet consisting primarily of fruits, seeds and leaves, with &quot;Ateles&quot; being the most frugivorous, fruits comprising over 80% of their diet. Those species relying most heavily on patchily distributed fruit trees have the largest ranges. These animals are characterized by a slow reproduction rate: females only bear young once every two to four years. Many species are hunted for their meat, and the destruction of their habitat likewise endangers them; the spider monkey already stands at the edge of extermination.

<doc id="1243797" wikidata="Q659468" url="?curid=1243797" title="Dextrorphan">
<text>Dextrorphan (DXO) is a psychoactive drug of the morphinan class which acts as an antitussive or cough suppressant and in high doses a dissociative hallucinogen. It is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of racemorphan; the levorotatory enantiomer is levorphanol. Dextrorphan is produced by O-demethylation of dextromethorphan by CYP2D6. Dextrorphan is an NMDA antagonist and contributes to the psychoactive effects of dextromethorphan.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
The pharmacology of dextrorphan is similar to that of dextromethorphan (DXM). However, dextrorphan is much more potent as an NMDA receptor antagonist and much less active as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, but retains DXM&#x27;s activity as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.
It also has more affinity for the opioid receptors than dextromethorphan, significantly so at high doses.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Dextrorphan has a notably longer elimination half-life than its parent compound, and therefore has a tendency to accumulate in the blood after repeated administration of normally dosed dextromethorphan formulations. It is further converted to 3-HM by CYP3A4 or glucuronidated.

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===
Dextrorphan was formerly a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, but was unscheduled on October 1, 1976.

==Research==
Dextrorphan was under development for the treatment of stroke, and reached phase II clinical trials for this indication, but development was discontinued.

==Environmental presence==
In 2021, dextrorphan was identified in &gt;75% of sludge samples taken from 12 wastewater treatment plants in California. The same study associated dextrorphan with estrogenic activity by using predictive modelling, before observing it in in vitro.

<text>Árni Magnússon (; 13 November 1663 – 7 January 1730) was an Icelandic scholar and collector of manuscripts who assembled the Arnamagnæan Manuscript Collection.

==Early life and education==
Árni was born in 1663 at Kvennabrekka in Dalasýsla, in western Iceland, where his father Magnús Jónsson was the minister (and later prosecutor and sheriff). His mother was Guðrún Ketilsdóttir, daughter of archdeacon Ketill Jörundarson of Hvammur. He was raised by his grandparents and uncle. At 17 he entered the Cathedral School in Skálholt, then three years later, in 1683, went to Denmark (with his father, who was part of a trade lobbying contingent) to study at the University of Copenhagen. There he earned the degree of &quot;attestus theologiæ&quot; after two years, and also became an assistant to the Royal Antiquarian, Thomas Bartholin, helping him prepare his &quot;Antiquitates danicæ&quot; and transcribing, translating, and annotating thousands of pages of Icelandic material.

== Career ==
After Bartholin&#x27;s death in 1690, Árni became librarian and secretary to a Danish statesman, Matthias Moth (brother of Sophie Amalie Moth, mistress to King Christian V until his death in 1699). From late 1694 to late 1696, he was in Germany, primarily to assess a book collection that had been offered to the university, but he extended the stay. Meanwhile, presumably thanks to his employer, he was appointed a professor designate at the university, and since he had never published, while still in Leipzig he published an edition of some Danish chronicles that he had copied while working for Bartholin. When he returned to Denmark, he resumed working for Moth but in 1697 was also appointed secretary at The Royal Secret Archives (Det Kongelige Gehejmearkiv). In 1699 he published anonymously, at Moth&#x27;s request, an account of a witchcraft case in which Moth had been a judge, &quot;Kort og sandfærdig Beretning om den vidtudraabte Besættelse udi Thisted&quot;.

With vice-lawman Páll Vídalín, he was assigned by King Frederick IV of Denmark to survey conditions in Iceland; this took ten years, from 1702 to 1712, most of which time he spent there. He returned to Copenhagen for two winters, the first time to present trade proposals, and during the second, which was in connection with a court case, he got married. The ultimate results of the survey were the Icelandic census of 1703 and the &quot;Jarðabók&quot; or land register, surveying for which was not completed until 1714 and which had to be translated into Danish after Árni&#x27;s death. He was expected to translate it himself, but it was one of several official tasks he neglected. It was finally published in 11 volumes in 1911–41. However, the mission as set out by the King was extremely broad, including investigating the feasibility of sulphur mining, assessing the fisheries, and auditing the administration of justice. Complaints of judicial abuse poured in, and officials were incensed by the two men&#x27;s inquiries into past court cases and in turn complained to Copenhagen about them.

Returning in 1713 to Copenhagen, where he was to spend the rest of his life, Árni resumed his duties as librarian, becoming unofficial head of the archive early in 1720 and later deputy librarian, possibly eventually head librarian, at the University Library. He also took up his appointment as professor of Philosophy and Danish Antiquities at the university, which had been awarded in 1701. In 1721 he was also appointed Professor of History and Geography.

== Collections and work ==
Árni had a lifelong passion for collecting manuscripts, principally Icelandic, but also those of other Nordic countries. It is likely that this started with Bartholin, who, when he had to return to Iceland temporarily in 1685 because his father had died, ordered him to bring back every manuscript he could lay hands on, and then sent him to Norway and Lund in 1689–90 to collect more. In addition, his uncle had been a scribe and his grandfather Ketill Jörundsson was a very prolific copyist. When he started collecting, most of the large codices had already been removed from Iceland and were in either the royal collection in Copenhagen or private collections in various Scandinavian countries; only in 1685, at Bartholin&#x27;s urging, did the King forbid selling Icelandic manuscripts to foreigners and exporting them. But there was plenty left, especially since Árni was interested in even humble items and would do whatever it took to get something. When Bartholin died, Árni helped his brother prepare his books and manuscripts for sale, and secured the Icelandic manuscripts among them for himself, including Möðruvallabók. 

Through his connection with Moth, Árni had some political influence, for which aspiring Icelanders gave him books and manuscripts. During his ten years surveying Iceland, he had access by the King&#x27;s writ to all manuscripts in the country, had his collection with him, and worked on it during the winters; it and the survey papers had to be left behind in Iceland when he was recalled, but were shipped to him in 1721. What he could not secure, he would borrow for copying; a number of copyists worked for him at his professorial residence in Copenhagen. His collection became the largest of its kind. His house burned down in the Copenhagen fire of 1728; with the help of friends, he was able to save most of the manuscripts, but some things were lost, including almost all the printed books and at least one unique item. His copyist Jón Ólafsson wrote out the contents of one manuscript from memory after both it and the copy he had made were lost in the fire. Árni has been blamed for delaying too long before starting to move his collection. He had not made an exhaustive inventory of his holdings, and several times stated that he believed the losses greater than was generally thought. (Everything in the University Library was destroyed, including many Icelandic documents which we now have only because of copies Árni made for Bartholin, and most other professors lost all their books.)

Árni was consulted by and readily assisted scholars all over Europe. In particular, he considerably helped Þormóður Torfason, the Royal Historian of Norway, in preparing his work for publication, having first made his acquaintance when he travelled there for Bartholin, and the second edition of &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; ever published (in Oxford) is actually substantially Árni&#x27;s translation and commentary, although Christen Worm is credited as editor. Árni disavowed it as a youthful effort.

Árni was unusual for his time in scrupulous crediting of sources and attention to accuracy. In his own aphorism:

Árni made a late marriage in 1709 to Mette Jensdatter Fischer, widow of the royal saddlemaker, who was 19 years older and wealthy. He returned to Iceland only a few months later to continue his work on the land register; they corresponded by letter until his return to Copenhagen. He lived only a little more than a year after the Copenhagen fire, dependent on friends for lodgings and having to move three times; the winter was harsh and when he fell ill, he had to have assistance to sign his will. He died early the next day, January 7, 1730, and was buried in the north choir of the still-ruined Vor Frue Kirke. His wife died in September and was buried beside him.

He bequeathed his collection to the state with provision for its upkeep and for assistance to Icelandic students. It forms the basis of the Arnamagnæan Institute and associated stipends.

==Legacy==
Árni&#x27;s remaining collection, now known as the Arnamagnæan Manuscript Collection, is now divided between two institutions, both named after him and both educational as well as archival in purpose: the Arnamagnæan Institute in Copenhagen and the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies in Reykjavík. The street &quot;Arni Magnussons Gade&quot; in the Kalvebod Brygge area of Copenhagen is named after him. He was depicted on the now-obsolete 100 Icelandic króna banknote. 

The character Arnas Arnæus in Nobel Prize-winner Halldór Kiljan Laxness&#x27;s novel &quot;Iceland&#x27;s Bell&quot; (&quot;Íslandsklukkan&quot;) is based on him; the novel concerns the manslaughter case against Jón Hreggviðsson, a farmer whose conviction was eventually reversed in part due to Árni and Vídalín&#x27;s investigations. Arne Saknussemm, a character in Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, is also based on him.

<text>Epistrophe (, &quot;return&quot;) is the repetition of the same word or words at the end of successive phrases, clauses or sentences. It is also known as epiphora and occasionally as antistrophe. It is a figure of speech and the counterpart of anaphora. It is an extremely emphatic device because of the emphasis placed on the last word in a phrase or sentence.

== Platonic epistrophe ==

Greek epistrophe: &quot;a word coined by Plato as a goal of philosophical education and the term adopted by early Christians for conversion&quot;.

== Examples ==
* &quot;Where affections bear rule, their reason is subdued, honesty is subdued, good will is subdued, and all things else that withstand evil, for ever are subdued.&quot; &quot;— Thomas Wilson&quot;
* &quot;... this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot; &quot;— Abraham Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address&quot;
* &quot;When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.&quot; &quot;—  &quot;The Apostle Paul, in the Bible, 1 Cor 13:11 (King James Translation)&quot;
* &quot;There is no Negro problem. There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem.&quot; Lyndon B. Johnson in &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;
* &quot;What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny compared to what lies within us.&quot; — Ralph Waldo Emerson
&lt;poem&gt;* &quot;Hourly joys be still upon you!
Juno sings her blessings on you. ...
Scarcity and want shall shun you,
Ceres&#x27; blessing so is on you.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt; — Shakespeare,&quot; The Tempest &quot;(4.1.108–109; 116–17)
* It was a creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of a nation.&lt;br&gt;Yes we can.&lt;br&gt;It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail towards freedom through the darkest of nights.&lt;br&gt;Yes we can.&lt;br&gt;It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness.&lt;br&gt; Yes we can.&lt;br&gt; It was the call of workers who organized; women who reached for the ballot; a President who chose the moon as our new frontier; and a King who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the Promised Land. Yes we can to justice and equality. Yes we can to opportunity and prosperity. Yes we can heal this nation. Yes we can repair this world. Yes we can.
In the beginning of this quotation by Barack Obama epistrophe is evoked, while the latter part makes use of anaphora.
