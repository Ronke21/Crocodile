<text>Gregory Edward Jacobs (August 25, 1963 – April 22, 2021), known professionally as Shock G and by his alter ego Humpty Hump, was an American rapper and musician who was best known as the lead vocalist of the hip hop group Digital Underground. He was responsible for Digital Underground&#x27;s &quot;The Humpty Dance&quot;, 2Pac&#x27;s breakthrough single &quot;I Get Around&quot;, and co-producer of 2Pac&#x27;s debut album &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot;.

==Early life==

Gregory Edward Jacobs was born on August 25, 1963, in Queens, New York. His maternal grandfather was a Hasidic Jew. He spent most of his childhood moving around the East Coast with his family, eventually settling in Tampa, Florida. As a drummer he won the 1978 &quot;Most Talented&quot; trophy at Greco Junior High School. As a result of his parents&#x27; divorce, he later relocated back to New York City. There he traded his drums in for a set of turntables upon discovering and marvelling over hip hop music while the art form was still in an underground developmental stage. He was mentored in the craft by his cousin Rene Negron (also known as DJ-Stretch), and their close friend Shawn Trone (also known as MC Shah-T of the parody-rap group No Face) who suggested Greg use the name &quot;Shah-G&quot;. Jacobs liked the idea, but mistakenly thought his friend said Shock G, and began using that name instead.

After returning to Tampa less than two years later, he dropped out of Chamberlain High School to form the Master Blasters, a mobile DJ crew which featured three DJs and four emcees at its height. They performed at parties and for crowds at Riverfront Park&#x27;s outdoor Sunday gatherings, eventually capturing the interest of Tony Stone, a program director at WTMP radio, which was the city&#x27;s primary R&amp;B station. Stone offered Jacobs, who was sixteen at the time, a job DJing on the air, and for a short while, as &quot;Gregory Racker&quot;, he was the youngest radio personality in central Florida with a regular time slot. After being fired for playing the fifteen-minute-long album version of &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot; by Funkadelic in a five-minute time slot, and also after tensions with his father escalated, Jacobs found himself backpacking the United States for a few years, drifting through odd jobs and petty criminal adventures. It was during this excursion that his focus switched from DJing to keyboard playing, and while utilizing piano practice-rooms at music stores and colleges around the country, he effectively taught himself to play the piano.

Deciding to pursue music seriously, he returned home, obtained a diploma, and began attending Hillsborough Community College (HCC), where he studied music theory under Jim Burge and piano under Patricia J. Trice. It was there at HCC that he met and formed a bond with Kenneth Waters, and the two began performing together under various names including The Chill Factor, and also The Four Horsemen, which included MC Skoobie-D, and the MD Dazzlin Doc-P who had recently moved to Tampa from the Bronx. In 1985, after two years of producing local artists for hire, playing solo piano gigs around town, performing with Waters, and being a keyboardist in Warren Allen Brooks&#x27; band, Jacobs and his aspiring-actress girlfriend Davita Watts eloped to Los Angeles in search of greater opportunity. There he played keyboards in Kenny McCloud&#x27;s pop-funk band Onyx before leaving Los Angeles and arriving in the San Francisco Bay Area where he found work in an Oakland music store, and where his group Digital Underground would form a few years later.

==Career==
===Digital Underground===
After relocating to Oakland, California, Shock G formed Digital Underground along with Chopmaster J, and Kenneth Waters (also known as Kenny-K). After around 15 months of unsuccessful negotiations with various small record companies, in 1988 the trio released a 12-inch single on Macola Records. It featured &quot;Your Life&#x27;s a Cartoon&quot; as the A-side and &quot;Underwater Rimes&quot; as the B-side. Both songs were penned, produced, and performed by Jacobs, who sketched the cartoonish cover illustrations. The record included the logo for Digital Underground&#x27;s startup label, TNT, as well as Macola&#x27;s logo. TNT was founded by Tupac Shakur&#x27;s management CEO Atron Gregory. In 1989, the group signed with Tommy Boy Records and released &quot;Doowutchyalike&quot;, receiving minimal radio airplay but became an underground hit. Its video was more successful, reaching number 40 on the MTV&#x27;s top 100 videos of the year. &quot;Doowutchyalike&quot; paved the way for Digital Underground&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sex Packets&quot; and the highest-charting song of their career &quot;The Humpty Dance&quot; both released in early 1990, and both achieving platinum sales certifications by the RIAA. The latter was rapped by Humpty Hump, the most flamboyant of Shock G&#x27;s several alter egos. By that time, Digital Underground had expanded significantly, with DJ Fuze, Money-B, and Schmoovy-Schmoov joining the group, and with Ramone &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Gooden and Tupac Shakur joining by 1991.

===Other identities===
Jacobs performed under many aliases he developed over his career, resulting in characters that were maintained with such reality that they were believed to be separate people by both fans and industry insiders. While he rapped in his normal voice as Shock G, as &quot;Humpty Hump&quot; he adopted a more nasal sound as part of this character&#x27;s exaggerated buffoon persona that included garish clothes and Groucho glasses. A fictional biography was included in Digital Underground&#x27;s press kit stating that Humpty Hump&#x27;s real name was Edward Ellington Humphrey III and he wore the Groucho glasses after burning his nose in a deep fryer accident. Jacobs made public appearances as one person or the other, but at live shows and video shoots he would use a stand-in or camera tricks to maintain the illusion. Jacobs sometimes performed as other characters including MC Blowfish, Icey-Mike, The Computer Woman, ButtaFly, and Peanut Hakeem.

===Television and film work===
Shock G&#x27;s TV appearances include &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot; in 1992, several &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; performances between 1990 and 1994, and several live MTV performances, including MTV Spring Break 1990 in Daytona Beach, &quot;Yo MTV Raps&quot; (performing live with Ed Lover and Doctor Dré) in 1991, &quot;Club MTV Live&quot; (with Downtown Julie Brown) in 1992, and MTV Jams in 1994. Most of these consisted of music performances with either Digital Underground or 2Pac; however, on an episode of the 1991 sitcom &quot;Drexell&#x27;s Class&quot;, Jacobs played a small acting role as a furnace repairman. Within the show&#x27;s story, the title character, Otis Drexell, insists that the furnace repairman looks exactly like Humpty Hump, but neither he nor his coworker (Jason Priestley) have heard of any such hip-hop artist, especially not one with such a ridiculous name. The episode ends with a live performance of Digital Underground&#x27;s &quot;No Nose Job&quot; on a cruise ship full of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; swimsuit models, which is presented as a scene from one of Drexell&#x27;s dreams.

With his Digital Underground band members, Jacobs appeared in the Dan Aykroyd-directed comedy film &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot; (1991) appearing as both Shock G and Humpty Hump. The group (including Tupac Shakur) makes a cameo music performance, as well as play a small character role in the film as themselves. Jacobs has appeared in a handful of music documentaries, including &quot;Thug Angel: Life of an Outlaw&quot; (2000) about Tupac Shakur, and &quot;Parliament Funkadelic: One Nation Under a Groove&quot; (1996) about George Clinton &amp; P-Funk, both of which received heavy TV rotation, and both of which relied heavily on Jacobs&#x27; commentary.

On June 24, 2011, Shock G was featured on an episode of the podcast &quot;You Had To Be There&quot; with comedians Nikki Glaser and Sara Schaefer.

===Production, solo work, and miscellaneous===
In addition to his work with Digital Underground, Shock G found moderate success as a solo artist and music producer. In 1993, Shock G produced Tupac Shakur&#x27;s breakthrough platinum single &quot;I Get Around&quot; as well as guest starred on the single and music video, and went on to produce Tupac&#x27;s &quot;So Many Tears&quot; from his multi-platinum 1995 album &quot;Me Against the World&quot;. Tupac&#x27;s first published work was while still a member of Digital Underground when he appeared on the 1991 song and video &quot;Same Song&quot;, which also appeared in the Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd and Demi Moore film &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot;. Shock co-produced Tupac&#x27;s debut album &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot;. Shock G appeared as a producer and guest artist on fellow Oakland-based rap group The Luniz platinum debut release &quot;Operation Stackola&quot; in 1995, also appearing as a guest emcee in the &quot;I Got 5 on It (Bay Ballas Remix)&quot; and video.

In 1996 the Wayans brothers&#x27; film &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood&quot; featured the Shock G song &quot;We Got More&quot;. The song, which featured Oakland rappers Luniz was used for three different scenes in the film, and is featured in two different places on the soundtrack, making it the only song to appear twice on one soundtrack. In 1998, Prince included the Shock G produced &quot;Love Sign&quot; on his triple-CD &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; album. Shock G has toured and performed on stage with George Clinton and P-Funk including a guest performance with Clinton at Woodstock 1999.

In 2003, Shock G produced the single &quot;Risky Business&quot; for Los Angeles underground artist Murs, and also appeared in the video, as himself and as Humpty Hump. Murs performed this song live with Shock G at the Paid Dues festival, and also featured him as his stage DJ/music conductor on a 2-month extensive Definitive Jux label U.S. and Canada tour. On January 20, 2009, Shock G&#x27;s single &quot;Cherry Flava&#x27;d Email&quot; was renamed and released as a special edition called &quot;Cherry Flava&#x27;d Election&quot; to commemorate the inauguration of President Barack Obama.

==Death==
On April 22, 2021, Jacobs was found dead in a motel room in Tampa, Florida, at age 57. On June 10, 2021, the Hillsborough County medical examiner announced that Shock G&#x27;s death was caused by an accidental overdose of fentanyl, methamphetamine and ethanol (alcohol).

Jacobs was interred at Parklawn Memorial Cemetery in Dunedin, Florida.

<doc id="1258983" wikidata="Q5412620" url="?curid=1258983" title="Dry quicksand">
<text>Dry quicksand is loose sand whose bulk density is reduced by blowing air through it and which yields easily to weight or pressure. It acts similarly to normal quicksand, but it does not contain any water and does not operate on the same principle. Dry quicksand can also be a resulting phenomenon of contractive dilatancy.

Historically, the existence of dry quicksand was doubted, and the reports of humans and complete caravans being lost in dry quicksand were considered to be folklore. In 2004, it was created in the laboratory, but it is still not clear what its actual prevalence in nature is.

==Scientific research==
Writing in &quot;Nature&quot;, physicist Detlef Lohse and coworkers of University of Twente in Enschede, Netherlands allowed air to flow through very fine sand (typical grain diameter was about 40 micrometers) in a container with a perforated base. They then turned the air stream off before the start of the experiment and allowed the sand to settle: the packing fraction of this sand was only 41% (compared to 55–60% for untreated sand).

Lohse found that a weighted table tennis ball (radius 2 cm, mass 133 g), when released from just above the surface of the sand, would sink to about five diameters. Lohse also observed a &quot;straight jet of sand [shooting] violently into the air after about 100 ms&quot;. Objects are known to make a splash when they hit sand, but this type of jet had never been described before.

Lohse concluded that:

:In nature, dry quicksands may evolve from the sedimentation of very fine sand after it has been blown into the air and, if large enough, might be a threat to humans. Indeed, reports that travellers and whole vehicles have been swallowed instantly may even turn out to be credible in the light of our results.

During the planning of the Project Apollo Moon missions, dry quicksand on the Moon was considered as a potential danger to the missions. The successful landings of the unmanned Surveyor probes a few years earlier and their observations of a solid, rocky surface largely discounted this possibility, however. The large plates at the end of legs of the Apollo Lunar Module were designed to reduce this danger, but the astronauts did not encounter dry quicksand.

<doc id="1259006" wikidata="Q2155507" url="?curid=1259006" title="River Kent">
<text>The River Kent is a short river in the county of Cumbria in England. It originates in hills surrounding Kentmere, and flows for around 20 miles (32 km) into the north of Morecambe Bay. The upper reaches and the western bank of the estuary are located within the boundaries of the Lake District National Park. The river flows in a generally north to south direction, passing through Kentmere, Staveley, Burneside, Kendal and Sedgwick. Near Sedgwick, the river passes through a rock gorge which produces a number of low waterfalls. This section is popular with kayakers as it offers high quality whitewater for several days after rain. The village of Arnside is situated on the east bank of the Kent estuary, just above Morecambe Bay, and a tidal bore known as the Arnside Bore forms in the estuary at this point on high spring tides.

The river has been used as a source of power since at least the 13th century. In 1848, the construction of Kentmere Reservoir was completed, which was designed to ensure that millers had a more regular supply of water to enable their mills to operate throughout the year. There were corn mills and bobbin mills on the upper river, and the weir from the Staveley mill now supplies water to a turbine which generates electricity for the nearby industrial estate. Below Staveley there were three mills connected with the paper industry, the lower one of which is now the site of the paper manufacturer James Cropper PLC, although the current mill no longer uses water power. Within Kendal, there were mills serving the woollen industry, while the mill at Helsington was the last water-powered snuff mill in the country until its closure in 1991. Below Kendal, there were three mills making gunpowder, and the extensive ruins of New Sedgwick gunpowder mill still lie within the confines of Low Wood caravan park, which is owned by the National Trust.

The river flows through the town of Kendal, which consequently suffers from flooding from time to time. One of the most serious floods was in 1898, but there was also extensive flooding in 1954 and 1968. In the aftermath of the 1968 event, a flood defence scheme was designed by the Lancashire River Authority, and implemented in six stages between 1972 and 1978. A major component of the scheme was the widening and deepening of the river between Nether Bridge and Miller Bridge, requiring the removal of of spoil, which was reused as the base for a business park. A large lagoon was also constructed to the north of the town to act as a gravel trap. Despite the work, Kendal was again inundated in 2015, when flows in the river far exceeded the design flow of the channel. The Environment Agency published plans for a new set of defences to protect the town in 2018.

The river is a Special Area of Conservation, particularly because it supports populations of the endangered white-clawed crayfish. It also supports populations of three types of game fish, and the upper reaches have become important for the rearing of juvenile salmon since fish passes were constructed to allow fish to negotiate the weirs on the river in 1986.

== Name ==
The origins of the name of the River Kent are uncertain. The name is thought not to belong to the Germanic languages, and therefore to be Brittonic; but a precise etymology has not been identified.

==Course==

The River Kent rises in the Lake District National Park as a series of streams to the north of the village of Kentmere, which flow rapidly downhill and into the Kentmere Reservoir. The reservoir was completed in 1848, to regulate the flow on the river for the benefit of the mills further downstream. Lingmell Gill rises from similar sources to the east, and flows into the reservoir. The river below the reservoir is supplied from a pipeline through the earth dam, with a controlling valve on the upstream slope of the dam, and when water levels are high, from a spillway at the western edge of the dam. As the river descends toward Kentmere, it is joined by Skeel Gill and Bryant&#x27;s Gill, Ullstone Gill, Nunnery Beck, Kill Gill and a number of other unnamed tributaries.

The river is crossed by Low Bridge, which carries a minor road to the settlement of Kentmere, and in then joined by Hall Gill. It broadens out as it flows through Kentmere Tarn, which was drained in the early 1840s to provide agricultural land. The draining was a major factor leading to the building of Kentmere Reservoir. Prior to draining, it had provided habitat for algae called diatoms, which formed a layer of diatomite on the bottom of the tarn when they died. From the 1930s until 1971, diatomite was extracted from the former bed, resulting in the tarn returning, although somewhat smaller than it had once been. Below the tarn, the river is joined by Park Beck, flowing from the west. Ullthwaite Bridge carries a minor track over the river, while Scroggs Bridge carries the road to Kentmere. The next bridge is Barley Bridge, above which is Staveley (old) weir, which supplied a corn mill on the east bank and a woollen mill on the west bank. Barley Bridge was built of slate rubble, possibly in the 17th century. It was widened in the 20th century, when the north side was rebuilt in a sympathetic style. The two arches are supported by a central pier, with cutwaters at river level and a pedestrian refuge above the cutwater on the north side. Below the bridge on the west bank is a four-storey mill building dating from the early- to mid-19th century. Staveley Weir is a little further downstream, and powered a bobbin mill; it currently supplies hydroelectric power as part of Staveley Mill Yard. 
After the river is joined by the River Gowan, it turns to the east, where it leaves the national park, and then to the south-east, to reach Cowan Head, where a large weir supplied a paper mill.

There was a second paper mill at Bowston, with a corresponding weir which was removed in 2022. It was located a little above Bowston Bridge, which has two arches constructed of rough coursed stone. A central pier has cutwaters both upstream and downstream. There is a third paper mill at Burneside. Here the mill was fed by a channel which drove turbines to generate electricity. At the southern edge of the mill, the river was crossed by Burneside Bridge, which was washed away in the floods of December 2015, and was being reconstructed in 2019. Below the bridge, the River Sprint flows over a weir to join the river on the north bank. On the outskirts of Kendal, the river turns to the south and is joined by the River Mint on its east bank. Below the junction, a large lagoon was constructed in the 1970s as part of a flood alleviation scheme. It acts as a gravel trap for gravel carried downstream when there are high flows in either river.

===Kendal section===
Within the town, the river is crossed by a bridge carrying the Windermere branch line, three footbridges, and five bridges carrying major roads. Just upstream of the railway bridge is a suspension footbridge, erected in 1993 using parts of the Romney footbridge, which was removed from the south end of the town and replaced by the Romney road bridge at that time. The first road bridge is Victoria Bridge, carrying the A6 road, which is made of iron and was built in 1887 to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s jubilee.

Next is Stramongate Bridge, with four arches, which dates from 1794, although it includes parts of an earlier bridge dating from the 17th century. A bridge on this site was first documented in 1379, when records mentioned &quot;De ponte de Strowmondgate&quot;. Stramongate weir is located immediately downstream of the bridge. Gooseholme footbridge was destroyed by floods in 1898, and was rebuilt. It was damaged in December 2015 during flooding, and after an inspection was closed in January 2016 and demolished in September 2019 as it was in a dangerous condition. Plans for a replacement were delayed by uncertainties as to what the Environment Agency were planning to do to improve the flood defences in that area, but it will probably be replaced by a single-span cable stayed bridge, so that its piers will no longer obstruct the river bed.

Miller Bridge carries the A65 road. There was originally a wooden bridge at this location, to connect the town to Castle corn mill, but it was regularly damaged by floods, and was replaced by a stone bridge in 1743. This was in turn replaced by the present bridge, which was designed by the architect Francis Webster to provide easy access to the terminus of the Lancaster Canal, then under construction. The bridge opened in November 1818, with the canal following in June 1819. Jennings Yard footbridge was another casualty of the 1898 floods, and was rebuilt afterward. It was replaced again between 1972 and 1978, as part of a flood alleviation scheme, which involved making the river almost twice as wide at this location.

Parts of Nether Bridge date from the 17th century, but when built, it was quite narrow, and has been widened. The original bridge is on the downstream side. An extension added in 1772 now forms the middle of the bridge, and the upstream side was added in 1908. The three stages are clearly visible within the arches. The final bridge is Romney Bridge, which is of modern construction, and replaced the Romney footbridge. It was built in 1993, and the suspension footbridge was moved to the north of the town at the same time.

===Lower river===
After passing Kendal sewage treatment works, on the west bank, the course follows a large meander to the north. The land it surrounds is a scheduled monument, as it was the location of Watercrook Roman fort and civil settlement. Archaeological excavation has revealed that the site was occupied from 90 CE to 369 CE, and the remains are fairly well preserved. Above ground, the site is marked by a number of low earthworks. As the river resumes its southward course, there is a large weir which supplied a snuff mill. The mill is Grade II listed and the snuff grinding equipment is still in situ. To the west of Natland, the river passes through a small limestone gorge, which is crossed by the two-arched Hawes bridge, probably dating from the 18th century, and made of limestone rubble with cut limestone copings.

Below the bridge, woodland on the west bank contains the remains of Sedgwick gunpowder works, fed by a long leat from a dam in the river. After passing under Force Bridge, Sedgwick, on the east bank of the river are the remains of Basingill gunpowder works, which is a scheduled monument. The river turns to the south-west, and is spanned by a much larger bridge carrying the A590 dual carriageway, before it enters Levens Park. As it leaves the park, the A6 road crosses the river on Levens Bridge, dating from the 17th century, although it has been widened subsequently and was rebuilt and repaired during the 18th and 19th centuries.

The river from Kendal to Sedgwick is popular with kayakers, as it contains a number of rapids and drops. It is not a river for beginners, offering whitewater rated at grade 3 with some grade 4 on the International Scale of River Difficulty, and it becomes more challenging as flow rates increase. The white water section ends at Force Falls, just above the A590 bridge at Sedgwick.

The river becomes tidal shortly afterward, as it widens into an estuary. It is joined by the River Gilpin, flowing southward, which forms the boundary of the Lake District National Park in its lower reaches, and the River Bela, flowing westward. The national park boundary then runs along the middle of the river channel. At Arnside, the final bridge is the Furness line railway viaduct. The River Winster flows into the estuary from the north, just before the Kent enters Morecambe Bay, a vast area of intertidal mudflats and sands. The tidal range at the mouth of the river and the shape of the estuary result in a tidal bore occurring near Arnside, which is known as the Arnside Bore. It is usually visible on spring tides, when the tidal range exceeds , and is affected by wind direction and recent rainfall. South Lakeland District Council have installed a siren, which is sounded approximately 15 to 20 minutes before the bore is expected to reach Arnside, and again when it actually reaches Blackstone Point, a little further down the estuary.

==History==
The river has been used to provide water power over a long period. Around 1800, farms around Kentmere, in the upper reaches of the river, were bought by wealthy outsiders, and efforts were made to improve the land for agriculture. Fields were drained by land drains, and around 1840 the Wilsons, who lived at Kentmere Hall, drained Kentmere Tarn, in the hope that it would provide high quality farm land. This was not particularly successful, but had unexpected effects. The water-holding bogs which were drained had previously acted as a giant sponge, soaking up water and releasing it steadily into the river. The flows now fluctuated much more than before, to the detriment of the mills.

In 1844, a scheme to build reservoirs to regulate the flow on the Kent and other rivers was promoted. A committee of ten mill owners plus the major of Kendal was formed, and asked the water engineer John Frederick Bateman to advise on the scheme. A bill was submitted to Parliament, and was signed by Queen Victoria on 21 July 1845. It authorised five reservoirs, but only that at Kentmere Head was built, with work completed in 1848.

In order to pay for the work, and ongoing maintenance, mill owners who benefitted from the scheme were charged a rate, which was based on the amount of fall in levels through the mill site. The amount of power which could be extracted from a given flow is directly proportional to the fall, and this method of charging was agreed to be fair. Only those mills with an annual value of £50 or more were required to pay rates, while corn mills having less than six pairs of stones were excluded from the rating system, as was Barley Bridge Mill at Staveley.

===Mills===
The first mill on the river was Low Bridge corn mill at Kentmere. Ullthwaite was another corn mill, located on the west bank of the river. It was fed by a weir running diagonally across the river with a sluice to control flow into a long leat. As roads in the area improved such remove mills became less economic; Low Bridge closed around 1854, and Unthwaite had closed by 1858. Goose Howe or Fell Foot mill was a bobbin mill, with a fall of . The weir ran straight across the river and a sluice-controlled flow in a leat on the west bank. In 1875 the tenant was William Philipson, who rented the mill for £135.90, paid a water rate of £99.20 and employed 56 men and boys. The mill was taken over by his son James in 1876, and in 1881 had only 13 employees. The lease ended in 1894 and the owner, Edward Johnson, could not find another tenant, even though he offered to reduce the rent to £35. The Staveley Co-operative Bobbin Manufacturing Company rented the mill from 1896, paying rent of £37.50, but their move from Gatefoot mill was not a success, with the Co-op closing in 1900, and the mill being demolished in 1902.

Scroggs mill at Staveley was situated just below Scroggs bridge, as was the weir, which ran diagonally. The mill was on the east bank, had a fall of , and was a bobbin mill in 1844. Ordnance Surveys maps show that it was making pick and hammer shafts in 1898, and was disused in 1914, but did not finally close until 1936. At Barley Bridge, Staveley, there were two mills, one on either side of the river, with a common weir above the bridge and a fall of . On the east bank there was a corn mill, while the mill on the west bank was a woollen mill in 1844. It was labelled as a Worsted mill in 1898, and by 1914 was shown as Letterpress Printing. It then became Kentmere Mills, while the 1978 map additionally marked it as producing printed cartons and boxes. Both continued to use water power until 1971. The woollen mill had been bought by Simpson and Ireland in 1834, and they had initially supported the Kentmere Reservoir scheme, but when they realised that they would be paying more than most in rates, due to the fall at their mill being the second highest on the river at the time, they opposed the scheme, and as a consequence, the Act of Parliament which authorised its construction contained a clause limiting their contribution to £15 per year, in order to remove the opposition. Nearer the centre of Staveley was a third mill, known as Staveley Mill in 1844 but shown as Chadwick&#x27;s Mill on maps. It was a bobbin mill, with a weir at the north end of the main building and a fall of . By 1972 it was run by Staveley Wood Turning Co., and was still using water power. The site is now part of Staveley Mill Yard, a business park created in 1995 by David Brockbank, the owner of the mill, whose father installed a second-hand water turbine which generated 25 kW of power for some 50 years. On 1 July 2002, a replacement 100 kW turbine was commissioned, as part of a scheme accredited under the Government&#x27;s Renewables Obligation.

===Paper mills===
The next three mills were all connected with the production of paper. Cowan Head is known to have been the site of a fulling mill in 1735. In 1746 it was bought by a local publisher, Thomas Ashburner, who produced &quot;The Kendal Weekly Mercury&quot;. He converted it to become a paper mill, which was taken over by James Ashburner and subsequently by the Wilson family. James Cropper rented the mill from the Wilsons in 1845 and bought it outright in 1854. A waterwheel powered the paper making process from 1750, and continued to do so until 1854, when a Thompson’s Patent Vortex Turbine replaced it. This was replaced by two turbines, of and , in the 1930s. The cost of water under the provisions of the Water Resources Act 1963 was prohibitive, and when the company failed to get a reduction in those costs at a public enquiry in the 1970s, they ceased to use water power. They had installed Lancashire boilers in 1899, which continued in use until 1977, when the mill closed. Bowston Mill was probably a fulling mill at one time, but in 1880 it was bought by James Cropper, who constructed a new building. This was used to process rags and ropes, with the resultant pulp supplied to Cowan Head Mill and Burneside Mill. This continued in use until the 1960s, when rags and ropes were replaced by waste paper in the manufacturing process.

At Burneside, records show that there was a corn mill on the river in the 13th century. Later there was also a fulling mill and a sickle mill on the same side of the river, with a fleecing mill on the opposite side. The Wakefield family bought the corn mill and the sickle mill in the 1750s, and John Wakefield added a woollen mill in 1760, which proved to be very profitable. He built a cotton mill in 1770, but changes in the markets made it uneconomic, so it was leased to Hudson and Foster in 1828, who fitted a second-hand paper making machine. James Cropper rented the mill from 1845, but in 1886 it burnt down, and he purchased the site to rebuild the mill. Water powered a turbine until about 1970. A steam turbine was installed in 1919, which powered the mill lighting and supplied electricity to the village. It was upgraded several times, and by 1995 Croppers were using a 6.5 Mw gas turbine, with an extra 1 Mw recovered from exhaust gases and a low pressure turbine. To aid transport between the three mills run by Croppers, a narrow gauge tramway was installed in 1879, which was converted to standard gauge in 1927. It linked to the Windermere to Oxenholme line, and ran until 1965. The site is still used to manufacture paper by James Cropper PLC in 2019.

===Woollen mills===
Within Kendal, the mills served the woollen industry. Dockray Hall Mill was fed by a large curved dam to the east of the point where Burneside Road crosses under the railway line. The leat, on the west side of the river, passed through the railway viaduct to reach the mill. It was producing dyewood and woollens in the 1700s, and a thick linen cloth called linsey in 1794. A sale notice from 1809 listed four separate mills, one for dying woods, two fulling mills and a friezing mill. The site burnt down in 1824, but was bought by the Gandys, who rebuilt the mills. Carpets were made there from 1850, and the site continued in use until 1940, when parts of it were demolished. Castle Mills was fed from a weir just below Stramongate Bridge, running almost at right angles to the modern weir. The leat curved round to the east, and there was a second weir, parallel to the modern river bank, below Gooseholme foot bridge. The mill was to the south of Bridge Street, and a long tail race rejoined the river below Parr Street. It was built in 1805–06, just to the north of a corn mill and fulling mill, by William Braithwaite and Isaac Wilson. From 1840 it was owned by J J and W Wilson, who introduced steam power in 1850. The mill manufactured travelling rugs, blankers, tweeds, linings and collar checks. It was extended in 1855 when a new water wheel and a beam engine were installed, each rated at , while further expansion took place in 1872. It employed some 500 people, with water turbines providing power from 1899, but in 1933 the company failed, and was bought by Goodacres, who manufactured carpets there. The site ceased to use water power in 1940.

Somewhere below the Castle Mills site was Kirkbarrow Spinning Mill, which was described as the first in the district in 1798. Low Mills were fred from a weir located where the modern Romney Bridge has been built. The leat ran alongside Natland Road, on the east bank, and the mill buildings were just to the north-east of the sewage treatment works. The mill was quite extensive, as in 1805 it was advertised as having three water wheels, six subsidiary mills, two fulling stocks, one carding engine, and eight friezing engines. John and Thomas Ireland bought the mill and used it to produce horse clothing and collar checks, while by 1848, parts of it were in use by Caleb Metcalf &amp; Sons for producing woollens. Disaster struck in 1891, when it burnt down, but Richardson &amp; Co rebuilt it, and it produced woollens from 1900 until it closed in 1924.

===Snuff and gunpowder mills=== 
Immediately after the long loop of the river that enclosed the Concangium Roman station, a long weir fed a leat to the west of the river, which fed mills at Helsington Laithes. A local architect called Francis Webster rented the site from the Lord of the Manor in about 1800, and built a weir and two water mills. It was known as a marble works, but the largest mill was used to polish local limestone for ornamental use, and the smaller mill was a saw mill. The works employed three local people between 1841 and 1861. J Chaplow and Sons used the larger building as a workshop after they bought it in 1895, and were described as &quot;haulage contractors, threshing machine proprietors and furniture removers&quot; in 1905. They maintained traction engines and other machinery in the mill building. THe water wheel remained in use, generating electricity until the 1940s, but was subsequently dismantled. Chaplows were still using the site in 2013 as a base for a tarmacking business. The smaller of the two mills was sold to Gawith, Hoggarth &amp; Co around 1880, who used it to manufacture snuff. From at least 1973 it was the last water-powered snuff mill in Britain. Apart from the addition of an electric hammer mill in 1980 to increase production, the process continued almost unchanged until 1991, when the mill was sold and converted into a house.

There were two gunpowder mills at Sedgwick, both producing gunpowder for the civilian market rather than for the military. Old Sedgwick Mill was the first of seven gunpowder mills in South Cumbria, and was started by John Wakefield. The site covered , and although it is believed to have opened in 1764, research by English Heritage in 2002 suggested that it was not built before 1768 and probably did not start producing gunpowder until 1770. The Wakefields worked hard to ensure that the Lancaster Canal extension to Kendal would be routed close to their works, and had a dedicated wharf on the canal at Sedgwick. The site was located on the east bank of the river, below the suspension footbridge, and a fall of in the river level provided the power for its mills. Wakefields moved to a new site at Gatebeck on the Peasey Beck in 1850, which had more fall, and where flows were augmented by compensation water from Killington Reservoir, which supplied the Lancaster Canal. The buildings beside the Kent were demolished between 1850 and 1854. In 1857, Walter Charles Strickland set up a new company which built the New Sedgwick Works on the west bank of the river. It covered some , and was fed from a weir originally built straight across the river, but subsequently reconstructed in a triangular shape. A long stone-lined channel ran through the woods to power water wheels and turbines at the main works. Strickland&#x27;s company failed in 1864, but it was reconstructed as the Sedgwick Gunpowder Company. From 1886, Henry Swinglehurst was the director of the company, which became a private limited company in 1896, when he died and his son Addison took over. Explosive Trades Ltd bought the business in 1917, and they became part of Nobel Industries Ltd in 1920. ICI became the parent company in 1926, but falling orders led to its closure in 1935.

After closure, many of the buildings were burnt or demolished to ensure there were no traces of explosive left. The site was reused during the Second World War for the storage of ammunition, and ownership passed to the National Trust in 1950, when they acquired Sizergh Castle and its grounds. The site was altered in 1977, when Low Wood Caravan Park was established, but it remains one of the best-preserved gunpowder works in the north. Among the caravans, the remains of nine incorporating mills, some corning mills, an engine house, a dusting house, glaze houses, stove houses, a press house, a pump house, a boiler station, a saltpetre refinery, stables and a joiner&#x27;s shop, and much of the water management system which supplied waterwheels and a water turbine, can still be found. The site is an ancient monument while some of the detached buildings are grade II listed. The final mill was Basin Ghyll or Basingill Mill, which was located below Force Bridge at Sedgwick. It was located on the east bank of the river, and was unusual, in that it was not a complete gunpowder works. It was built in 1790 to supplement the incorporating mills at Old Sedgwick gunpowder works. When that closed in 1850, and operation moved to Gatebeck, Basin Ghyll supplemented the incorporating mills at Gatebeck. It closed in 1935, after which all the wooden-framed mill buildings were burned to remove explosives, leaving the stone blast walls. There was a waterwheel at the north end of the site, and a tunnel which carried water downstream to further mills and a second waterwheel. Most of the basic structures and the water system survive.

===Hydro power===

In addition to the Staveley Mill Yard hydro-electric scheme, there have been other proposals to use the Kent to provide hydro power. In 2009 the residents of Kentmere proposed the construction of a small system, utilising a section of the river just above Low Bridge, where it drops some over a distance of at Jumb Falls. The scheme would have generated 1,250 MWh of electricity per year, which would have been sold to the national grid, with the profits used to fund community projects once the capital costs were repaid. A Trust was set up to manage the scheme, and a planning application was submitted to the Lake District National Park Authority in August 2009. Consent for the scheme was granted in July 2010. Because the scheme was a run-of-river scheme, the decision to sell the electricity rather than distribute it locally was taken because varying flows would have resulted in variable amounts of power being generated. Incidentally, the location plan, which was one of the documents submitted with the application, shows an old mill, which was presumably Low Bridge Mill, near the proposed location for the turbine house. For reasons that are not altogether clear, the scheme did not progress any further, and the Trust was disbanded in March 2011.

===Flood defence===
Kendal&#x27;s location on the banks of the River Kent has made it liable to flooding from high river levels. The highest known level was recorded in 1898, but on 2 December 1954, the highest level of flood water since that time was recorded. Some of land in and around the town were under water, with nearly 300 houses inundated. At its peak, of water per second were flowing down the river. Kendal again suffered from flooding in 1968, and the Lancashire River Authority, who had responsibility for the river, implemented a flood defence scheme. It was designed to cope with flows up to the maximum experienced in 1954 without the town flooding, and was constructed in six phases between 1972 and 1978 at a cost of £1 million.

The scheme affected of the river, from Mintsfeet in the north to Watercrook in the south. The river channel was made wider, with the width of the section between Nether Bridge and Miller Bridge being increased from to . The depth of the channel was also increased in places, and a total of of spoil was removed, which was reused to construct the base of a business park on the south side of Kendal. The deeper channel meant that the foundations of existing river walls and bridges had to be protected against erosion. Walls were protected by building concrete buttressing in front of them, which was then faced with stone. Some of the widened sections needed new walls, and some of the banks were protected by limestone blocks. of buttressing and of new walls were required to complete the scheme. Jennings Yard footbridge had to be replaced because the river was so much wider at that point, and in order to prevent the river drying out when flows were low, a series of low weirs were built through the town. Earth embankments were constructed to protect Mintsfeet and Helsington, where an automatic flood gate was also required, to prevent floodwater breaching the defences through the leat to Helsington Mill.

During times of high flow, the river moves large volumes of gravel downstream, which is then deposited as the river slows. In order to prevent this clogging the town section, a large lagoon was built just below the confluence of the River Kent and the River Mint. This acts as a gravel trap, enabling the gravel to be removed at regular intervals more easily than if it was spread throughout the town section. The effectiveness of the new defences were tested in 1985, when a flood of the same magnitude as that in 1954 passed through the town without overtopping any of the defences. Parts of Mintsfeet were affected by flooding from the river in February 2004 and January 2005. As well as houses being inundated, business properties on the Lake District Business Park and the Mintsfeet Industrial Estate were also flooded. Flood embankments had been built to protect the industrial areas from the two rivers in the 1980s, and these were improved after they failed to stop flooding in 2004 and 2005.

In December 2015, much of Cumbria and north-west England experienced extreme levels of rainfall, caused by Storm Desmond. The Kent catchment was already saturated, and so the rain quickly made its way into the river systems. In Kendal, the Kent and the River Mint both overtopped their east banks. Flows on the River Kent are measured by gauging stations at Bowston, Victoria Bridge in Kendal, and Sedgwick. The peak flow recorded at Victoria Bridge during the flood event of 5 December and 6 December was per second, far in excess of the design flow of per second for the river channel through Kendal. However, this was not an accurate measurement, since water which flowed over the bank in the Mintsfeet area was constrained by the Oxenhope to Windermere railway embankment, and combined with the flood waters of Stock Beck flowed back under the railway where it crosses the A6 road, thus rejoining the river below the Victoria Bridge gauging station. Peak flows downstream at Sedgwick were per second.

Nearly 2,150 properties in the town were flooded as a result of the highest river levels ever recorded. The areas most affected were Mintsfeet and Sandylands. At the southern end of the town, the sewage treatment works was inundated, and the water caused serious damage to its main outfall. Properties at Helsington Mills were also flooded, with water levels of up to . Once the water had subsided, 7,000 tonnes of gravel were removed from the gravel trap, a further 7,000 tonnes from Gooseholme and 3,000 tonnes from near Romney Bridge. Smaller amounts were removed from other locations in the summer. 
In November 2018, the Environment Agency submitted plans for the first phase of a £30 million scheme to improve flood defences in Kendal. This involves the construction of flood gates, flood walls and a pumping station at Gooseholme. As a result of public consultation, plans for flood walls near Abbot Hall Art Gallery and Kendal Parish Church had been modified to be less intrusive.

To complement these engineering solutions, some more natural flood management techniques are being trialled. In 2020 work began on a small demonstration project at Town View Fields, a park in central Kendal. The work involved replacing around of stone culvert carrying Dyers Beck with a meandering channel, running into a small wetland area. This slows the release of water at times of high flow into the main river system. The project, which was implemented by South Cumbria Rivers Trust, was the first urban daylighting scheme undertaken by the Trust, although they have previously implemented rural schemes. Most of the funding came from DEFRA&#x27;s Natural Flood Management programme.

==Wildlife==
The river is a designated Special Area of Conservation, covering , primarily as an important habitat for the endangered White-clawed Crayfish (&quot;Austropotamobius pallipes&quot;). This species is prolific, particularly in some of the tributaries of the Kent, where it exists in densities higher than almost anywhere else in England. The river is also an important site for bullhead and the endangered freshwater pearl mussel. It is a designated watercourse of plain to montane levels, which means that it is characterised by populations of water-crowfoot and water starwort, which can form floating mats of white flowers in the summer. These mats provide food and shelter for fish and invertebrates.

There are significant quantities of three types of game fish in the river, salmon, brown trout and sea trout. Fishing on a stretch of around Kendal is controlled by the Kent Angling Association, which was formed in 1848. In 1986 fish ladders were constructed alongside the dams of mill-ponds to allow migratory fish to reach the upper sections of the river. Salmon in particular were quick to utilise the breeding grounds that then became available and the river above Bowston has become important for the rearing of juvenile salmon. Notwithstanding the existence of fish ladders, the removal of some weirs would arguably be beneficial to the health of the river and fish stocks in particular. In 2022 approval was given for the removal of a 19th century weir at Bowston.

Since 1989, there has been a fish counter at Basinghyll, which covers the whole width of the river. Until 2000, it could detect any fish passing through the counter, and their direction of travel, but could not detect the species of individual fish. At that time, the Environment Agency were hoping to use underwater cameras to record the species of the fish. In 2013 DEFRA funding was announced for eel passes at Stramongate weir in Kendal and Basinghyll fish counter, where two eel passes were installed in July 2013.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Kent system was as follows in 2019.
Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

Projects have been undertaken to improve the water quality, for example on the River Gowan, a tributary which has been reconnected to its flood-plain. Some of these projects are also intended to help control flooding by natural means.

<doc id="1259014" wikidata="Q669125" url="?curid=1259014" title="Le siège de Corinthe">
<text>Le siège de Corinthe (English: The Siege of Corinth) is an opera in three acts by Gioachino Rossini set to a French libretto by Luigi Balocchi and Alexandre Soumet, which was based on the reworking of some of the music from the composer&#x27;s 1820 opera for Naples, &quot;Maometto II&quot;, the libretto of which was written by Cesare della Valle.

&quot;Le siège&quot; was Rossini&#x27;s first French opera (known also in its Italian version as &quot;L&#x27;assedio di Corinto&quot;) and was first given at the Salle Le Peletier of the Paris Opéra on 9 October 1826.

==Composition history==
The opera commemorates the siege and ultimate destruction of the town of Missolonghi in 1826 by Turkish troops during the ongoing Greek War of Independence (1821–1829). The same incident – condemned throughout Western Europe for its cruelty – also inspired a prominent painting by Eugène Delacroix (&quot;Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi&quot;), and was mentioned in the writings of Victor Hugo. The reference to Corinth is an example of allegory, although Sultan Mehmed II had indeed besieged the city in the 1450s. Lord Byron&#x27;s 1816 poem &quot;The Siege of Corinth&quot; has little, if any, connection with the opera as to its content.

Liszt wrote an Introduction and Variations for piano based on a march from this opera. That work was deemed lost or mistitled until 1976 when the introduction was discovered by Nancy B. Reich at Manhattanville College&#x27;s library.

===Revised version of &quot;Maometto II&quot;===
The French version of this late Rossini opera was a partial rewrite of the composer&#x27;s 1820 Italian opera, &quot;Maometto II&quot;, but with the same story and similar if differently named characters, in the setting of the Turks&#x27; 1470 conquest of the Venetian colony of Negroponte. That original version had premiered in Naples on 3 December 1820 – six years before the Missolonghi siege and massacre. The original &quot;Maometto&quot; was not well received, neither in Naples nor in Venice where Rossini tried out a somewhat revised version in 1823, this time with a happy ending using music from his own &quot;La donna del lago&quot; at the conclusion.

But in 1826, two years after settling in Paris, Rossini tried yet again, with yet another version (which included two ballets, as called for by French operatic tradition), transplanted it to the Peloponnese with the new title &quot;Le siège de Corinthe&quot; in a topical nod to the then-raging Greek war for independence from the Ottomans, and translated it into French. This time, Rossini succeeded, and the opera was performed in various countries over the next decade or so.

==Performance history==
The first performance, in French, was at the Salle Le Peletier of the Paris Opéra on 9 October 1826. It was given as &quot;L&#x27;assedio di Corinto&quot; (translated by Calisto Bassi) in Parma on 26 January 1828 and it reached Vienna in July 1831. In the United States, the first performance was given in French by the Italian Opera House in New York in February 1833 and in Italian in February 1835. The opera became popular across Europe in its Italian translation by Calisto Bassi with a contralto in the tenor role of Neocle, but from the 1860s it disappeared entirely from the repertory and was no longer staged for roughly the next eighty years. However, the opera&#x27;s overture remained widely popular and never left the concert orchestra repertory. More recently the overture has been performed and recorded by several contemporary classical orchestras, including the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields conducted by Neville Marriner.

In 1949 &quot;Le siège de Corinthe&quot; was finally revived again in a production starring Renata Tebaldi in Florence. That production was repeated two years later in Rome. In 1969 La Scala revived it for the Rossini centennial with Beverly Sills, in her La Scala debut, as Pamira, Marilyn Horne as Neocle, and Thomas Schippers conducting. The opera used a performing edition by noted musicologist and &quot;bel canto&quot; expert Randolph Mickelson that made use of insertion arias from the original Neapolitan and Venetian versions and even from other obscure Rossini operas (as Rossini himself commonly did). In 1975, the Metropolitan Opera used the La Scala version for its premiere of the opera. The Met production was conducted by Schippers again and starred Beverly Sills in her Met debut, now opposite Shirley Verrett, Justino Díaz and Harry Theyard.

Since 1975, the only production of the opera in the US has been the October 2006 stagings of the French version by the Baltimore Opera, in a mid-19th century re-translation back into Italian, with one aria interpolated from one of the predecessor &quot;Maometto II&quot; versions and one from Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Ciro in Babilonia&quot; which featured Elizabeth Futral as Pamira and Vivica Genaux as Neocle.

Outside the US, the opera has been staged several times. It was produced in Florence in 1982 in Calisto Bassi&#x27;s Italian version, starring Katia Ricciarelli and contralto Martine Dupuy, and under the direction of Pier Luigi Pizzi. In 1992 the same production was revived in Genoa starring Luciana Serra, but the original French version was chosen instead. The French version was also staged twice at the Rossini Opera Festival: in 2000 starring Michele Pertusi, Ruth Ann Swenson and Giuseppe Filianoti, and in 2017, following the new critical edition by Damien Colas, in a La Fura dels Baus production.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==

:Place: Corinth
:Time: 1459

===Act 1===
&quot;SCENE ONE: Vestibule of the senate palace at Corinth&quot;

Cleomene, governor of Corinth, realizes that his depleted troops cannot withstand another attack. But Neocle, a young Greek officer, encourages the Greeks to keep fighting the Turks that are besieging the city. The soldiers depart for a new attack.
Cleomene, impressed by Neocle&#x27;s valor, has promised him his daughter Pamira in marriage. But she reveals that she loves a certain Almanzor whom she met recently in Athens. Cleomene starts questioning her about Almanzor, but he is called away to the battle. Before leaving he gives his daughter a sword which she must use on herself if the Turks succeed in capturing the city.

&quot;SCENE TWO: A Square in Corinth&quot;

The Turks are celebrating their victory and praising their leader, Maometto. Cleomene, now a prisoner, is brought in, and Maometto urges him to surrender; he refuses. Pamira rushes in to her father, then recognizes, in Maometto, the man she knew as Almanzor. Maometto offers to marry Pamira and make peace with the Greeks. Cleomene, however, insists she must marry Neocle. When Pamira refuses, Cleomene curses her and leaves her to Maometto.

===Act 2===
&quot;Maometto&#x27;s tent&quot;

Alone, Pamira is torn between her love for Maometto and her duty to her father and Greece. Maometto enters and tries to comfort her. Preparations begin for their wedding, but a commotion outside the tent interrupts the proceedings. It is Neocle, who has come to take Pamira back to the Greeks. Maometto, angry, is about to kill the intruder when Pamira claims he is her brother. The Greeks prepare for a new battle, and from the citadel Cleomene calls to Pamira. She deserts Maometto to join her father and country. Maometto vows that by sunrise every Greek will be dead.

===Act 3===
&quot;The tombs of Corinth, illuminated by a multitude of fires&quot;

Neocle enters the catacombs, mastering his fear. He joins the Greeks who are preparing to make a final stand. In the distance, Pamira and the Greek women are heard in prayer. Cleomene recognizes Pamira&#x27;s voice; but, feeling betrayed by her, he swears she is no longer his daughter. Maometto approaches and once again offers to marry Pamira and make peace with the Greeks. Cleomene would rather see Pamira die than married to their enemy. Neocle returns and reveals to Maometto that he isn&#x27;t Pamira&#x27;s brother, he&#x27;s the man her father wants her to marry. Maometto, enraged, departs for the field of battle.
Pamira enters and Neocle makes father and daughter reconcile. The three of them pray for God&#x27;s protection. Jero, the guardian of the graves, enters with the Greek warriors; he blesses their banners and recalls ancient Greek victories at Marathon and Thermopylae. The men march off to battle, while Pamira and the women pray for God&#x27;s mercy. When they hear Turkish cries of victory, the women prepare to die. Maometto, victorious, returns to claim Pamira; but she and the women kill themselves rather than submit. The building collapses, revealing behind it the city of Corinth in flames.

<text>Laurens Hammond (January 11, 1895 – July 1, 1973) was an American engineer and inventor. His inventions include the Hammond organ, the Hammond clock, and the world&#x27;s first polyphonic musical synthesizer, the Novachord.

== Youth ==

Laurens Hammond was born in Evanston, Illinois, on January 11, 1895 to William Andrew and Idea Louise Strong Hammond. Laurens showed his great technical prowess from an early age. His father, William, took his own life in January 1897, ostensibly due to failure of the First National Bank of Illinois, which he had founded. Upon her husband&#x27;s death, Idea, who was an artist, relocated to France with Laurens to further her studies, and the family spent the next eleven years in France and Germany.

== Early inventions ==

When the family returned to Evanston in 1909, Laurens, then 14, was fluent in French and German. While in Europe, he had already designed a system for automatic transmission for automobiles. At his mother&#x27;s suggestion, he submitted his designs to engineers at French automaker Renault, although they were not accepted. His first patent, in 1912, was for a barometer that could sell for one dollar.

==University and military service==

Hammond studied mechanical engineering at Cornell University, and was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He graduated with honors in 1916. When the United States entered World War I, Hammond served with the 16th Regiment Engineers (Railway), American Expeditionary Force, in France. He rose to the rank of captain.

== Inventions ==

Following the war, Hammond moved to Detroit, where he was chief engineer for the Gray Motor Company, a manufacturer of marine engines. A partner in the company, Col. John H. Poole, with whom he had served in France, knew of his engineering skills, and paid him an extra $300 a week under the table to stay with Gray Motor. In 1919, he invented a silent spring-driven clock. This invention brought him enough money to leave Gray Motor Company and rent his own space in New York City.

In 1922, Hammond invented the Teleview system of shutter glasses in association with 3-D films. One feature was made for the system, &quot;The Man from M.A.R.S.&quot;. He premiered this show at the Selwyn Theatre in New York in December 1922 to critical acclaim, but the cost of installing the expensive machinery in the theater was prohibitive, and the process was never used again. A 2-D version of the film, renamed &quot;Radio-Mania&quot;, continued to screen.
Hammond&#x27;s work on the synchronous motor led him in 1928 to set up the Hammond Clock Company, with six workers, above a grocery store in Chicago. Demand was high and the business soon grew into a large factory. He was responsible for a number of other inventions, such as an electric bridge table. A mechanism below the $25 table&#x27;s surface shuffled the cards and dealt them to each of the four players.

In 1933, Hammond bought a used piano, and discarded everything apart from the keyboard action. Using the keyboard as a controller, he experimented with different sound-generating methods, finally settling on one, the tonewheel generator. The company&#x27;s assistant treasurer, W. L. Lahey, was the organist at the nearby St. Christopher&#x27;s Episcopal Church, and Hammond consulted him concerning the quality of the new instrument&#x27;s sound. Thanks to Hammond&#x27;s prior manufacturing and engineering experience, the tonewheel generator was extremely well-engineered by the time the &quot;Hammond Organ&quot; finally went into production in 1935. Tonewheel organs are still in regular use in the twenty-first century, which is a testament to the quality of the design and execution of the product.

Hammond filed his patent application on January 19, 1934. At that time, unemployment was a major problem due to the Great Depression, and with this in mind, the Patent Office rushed to grant his application, with the hope of creating jobs in the area.

Hammond was awarded the Franklin Institute&#x27;s John Price Wetherill Medal in 1940 for the invention of the Hammond electric organ.

== Later life and death ==
Hammond left his position as president of his company in 1955, and retired from the company in 1960, at the age of sixty-five. During his life he held 91 patents. He was married to Roxana Scoville, and had one daughter. He died in Cornwall, Connecticut on July 1, 1973, aged 78.

In 2017 the Laurens Hammond Museum was founded in Kielce, Poland as a division of the Museum of Toys and Play.

<doc id="1259021" wikidata="Q7823812" url="?curid=1259021" title="Too Darn Hot">
<text>&quot;Too Darn Hot&quot; is a song written by Cole Porter for his musical &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; (1948). 

==Background==
In the stage version, it is sung at the start of Act 2, and in the 1948 original Broadway production, it was sung by Lorenzo Fuller (as Paul) and Eddie Sledge and Fred Davis (as the specialty dancers), leading the full company.

In the 1953 MGM Hollywood film version, it is moved to a much earlier point, and it is sung by Ann Miller (as Lois Lane, Fred&#x27;s new girlfriend, who is cast as Bianca). The song does not contribute to the plot in either the stage or film versions (according to general opinion); in the stage version, the song represents the company of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; taking a break offstage during the intermission of their play; in the film version it allowed the audience to see Lois&#x27;s fun-loving, risk-taking nature, and gave Ann Miller a chance to show off her dancing skills, specifically tap. The line &#x27;According to the Kinsey report&#x27; (in the original stage production) was changed in the film version to &#x27;According to the latest report&#x27;. The song has also been covered by many artists.

==Notable recordings==
*Ella Fitzgerald recorded the song for her 1956 album &quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song Book&quot;, and on her 1960 album &quot;Ella in Berlin: Mack the Knife&quot;. 

*Petula Clark recorded it for her album &quot;Petula Clark in Hollywood&quot; (1959).
*Mel Torme - included on &quot;Mel Tormé Swings Shubert Alley&quot; 1960) 
*Erasure for the &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; compilation (album and video versions) in 1990.
*Stacey Kent - for her album &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot; (2003)
*Anthony Strong on his 2013 album &quot;Stepping Out&quot; 
*Holly Cole for the album &quot;Shade&quot; (2013)

==In popular culture==
*On February 16, 1964 Mitzi Gaynor performed the song on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, broadcast live from the Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach, in between the two sets by The Beatles for their second appearance on the show.
*This song was the soundtrack of a 2003 Adidas commercial.
*The song gained new currency in 2004 because of two films that came out that year. The first was the Porter biopic &quot;De-Lovely&quot;, and the second was the movie &quot;Kinsey&quot;, which used the tune because Porter mentioned the Kinsey report on American sexual attitudes in the song&#x27;s bridge.
*This song is referenced in the title song of the 2008 musical &quot;In the Heights&quot; by Usnavi.
*In 2013, for &quot;Verve Remixed: The First Ladies&quot;, RAC (DJ) did a chill version of Ella Fitzgerald&#x27;s take.
*In 2015, Katie Derham danced the Charleston to &quot;Too Darn Hot&quot; on the thirteenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; with her professional dancing partner Anton Du Beke.
*The song is featured in the establishing opening scene of the 2024 film Apartment 7A, a prequel to the 1968 film Rosemary&#x27;s Baby.

<doc id="1259023" wikidata="Q270973" url="?curid=1259023" title="Timor-Leste national football team">
<text>The Timor-Leste national football team () is the national team of Timor-Leste and is controlled by the Federação de Futebol de Timor-Leste (FFTL). They became a member of FIFA on 12 September 2005.

Timor-Leste&#x27;s international debut was in the preliminary round of the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification in March 2003, when they lost 3–2 to Sri Lanka and 3–0 to Chinese Taipei. Timor-Leste won their first international match on 5 October 2012 against Cambodia with a score of 5–1.

==History==

=== Early history (2003–2017) ===
Football was established in East Timor during the Portuguese colonial era, when many of the locals and the Portuguese officials played amateur football. After Portugal ended its colonial rule, Indonesia invaded and occupied the island, which resulted in a long running battle against Jakarta-led forces. Timor-Leste eventually gained independence from Indonesia in 2002.

The East Timor Football Federation was accepted as an associate member of AFC at the 20th AFC Congress in 2002. Their international debut came in March 2003 when they participated in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification campaign for the 2004 AFC Asian Cup in China. Given their history, it was no surprise that they crashed out with defeats against the likes of Sri Lanka and Chinese Taipei. They then entered the regional competition for the first time in 2004 as they played in the 2004 AFF Championship as an invited member. They finished in last place, showing that they had a long way to go before they could compete even on the regional stage.

They again had no success in the 2007 AFF Championship qualification, with four heavy losses, including a 7–0 trouncing by the Philippines. The following year in the 2008 AFF Championship qualification, Timor-Leste surprisingly drew against Cambodia; this feat was reported in international news.

==== First win ====
In the 2012 AFF Championship qualification, the country&#x27;s football federation (FFTL) reportedly selected their foreign based players, who played in Brazil, Portugal, Australia and elsewhere, to fortify the team as they also did at the 2011 SEA Games.

On 5 October 2012, Timor-Leste won their first international match in a 5–1 victory against Cambodia with goals coming from Murilo de Almeida who scored a brace, Adelino Trindade and Alan Leandro. On 9 October 2012, the team won another match against Laos in the qualification round as Murilo de Almeida scored a penalty at 43&#x27; minutes of the first half of the match. Later Adelino Trindade extended the Timorese advantage with a header early in the second half and then Alan Leandro added the third goal on the 83rd minute. After winning the second match against Laos, head coach Emerson Alcântara stated &quot;This is a win for the people of East Timor. They had to wait a long time for our team to win their first match in this competition but now we have two wins and this was an important victory for Timor-Leste. &quot;I think that about 70 percent of people in Timor Leste are poor so it is very important to get this result for them because they love football and the people can get confidence and take pride in this result. It is very important for us to motivate our people and to help to change their lives.&quot; With a win needed in the final fixture, Timor-Leste subsequently lost to Brunei 2–1 and finished in third place in the group, one point away from runners-up of the group, Laos as they went on to qualify for the 2012 AFF Championship. In the 2014 AFF Championship qualification, Timor-Leste secured a victory against Brunei winning them 4–2 in the process. In the next match, they caused an upset to Myanmar on 14 October 2014 which ended up in a goalless draw but that wasn&#x27;t enough as Timor-Leste didn&#x27;t make it to the 2014 AFF Championship.

==== 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC second round ====
Timor-Leste then participated in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification first round facing Mongolia where on 12 March 2015, they secured their first ever win against a country outside of Southeast Asia in a 4–1 win at the National Stadium of Timor-Leste. In the second leg, Timor-Leste travelled to Ulaanbaatar where they won 1–0 putting them on an aggregate of 5–2 seeing them advancing to the second round however on 12 December 2017, FIFA awarded both matches 3–0 to Mongolia due to Timor-Leste fielding numerous ineligible players. However, this was long after the Second round had been played, so Timor-Leste advanced and Mongolia were not reinstated. Timor-Leste were then grouped with Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Palestine and Malaysia in Group A. On 11 June 2015, Ramon Saro scored in the 90+3&#x27; minute stoppage time which cause a huge upsets to Malaysia in a 1–1 draw at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium which Timor-Leste got their first ever point in the campaign. On 8 October 2015 while playing at home, Ramon Saro break the deadlock as they lead against Palestine however in the dying minute of the match, Ahmad Abu Nahyeh equalise for Palestine in 1–1 draw as it gains media attention from the Southeast Asia region. However, Timor-Leste has to forfeited five of their group matches due to fielding numerous ineligible players. Since their last match against Saudi Arabia on 17 November 2015, Timor-Leste has been playing their home match overboard as their National Stadium of Timor-Leste in Dili failed to meet FIFA standards which also see them finishing at the bottom of the table. During the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification match, Timor-Leste played their home match at the Tan Sri Dato Haji Hassan Yunos Stadium in Johor Bahru playing against Malaysia. 
Timor-Leste then participated in the 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup held in Kuching where they snatched a goalless draw against Nepal. They were also invited to the 2017 CTFA International Tournament where in the match against the Philippines, Silveiro Garcia scored the only goal in the match as Timor-Leste gains a win in the tournament.

=== Back-to-back AFF Championship tournament (2018–2020) ===

Timor-Leste then qualified to the 2018 AFF Championship for the first time in 14 years winning the 2018 AFF Championship qualification against Brunei on an aggregate of 3–2. They will play their designated &quot;home&quot; match against Thailand at the Rajamangala Stadium in Bangkok, while their home tie against the Philippines will be played at the Kuala Lumpur Stadium in Malaysia due to the incomplete floodlighting of the National Stadium of Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste then qualified for the 2020 AFF Championship automatically after the withdrawal of Brunei in the qualification play-off.

=== Young star in the making (2021–present) ===
During the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualification – play-off round first leg match on 5 September 2024, João Pedro became the first player in Timorese history to score a hat-trick in a 4–1 win over Mongolia while playing on neutral ground at the Kapten I Wayan Dipta Stadium held in Gianyar, Bali. In October 2024, Timor Leste then played against Brunei who is also on a five-game winning streak for the 2024 ASEAN Championship qualification. Timor Leste ended up victorious winning 1–0 on aggregate where Gali Freitas scored the goal to ensure the team qualified for the 2024 ASEAN Championship, where they will play their matches at Hàng Đẫy Stadium in Hanoi.

==== 2024 ASEAN Championship ====
As of 28 December 2024, Timor-Leste&#x27;s performance at the 2024 ASEAN Championship has been poor, ending in a string of defeats that resulted in their early elimination. The squad competed in four matches, beginning with a devastating loss to Thailand on 8 December suffering their worst ever defeat since 2015 with a 10–0 thrasing defeat scoreline. Following that, they met Malaysia on December 11, putting up a valiant battle but ultimately losing 2–3. Their difficulties continued against Singapore on December 14, with a 0–3 defeat. Timor-Leste met Cambodia in their last group stage match on December 17, and fell 1–2. 

Timor-Leste finished with a record of four losses, two goals scored, and an incredible eighteen goals conceded, resulting in a goal differential of -16. They were unable to gain any victories during the tournament. They became the first team to be eliminated from the 2024 ASEAN Cup.

==Naturalised players controversy==
Since 2012, several Brazilian-born footballers, who are not of East Timorese descent and had not necessarily played in the East Timorese League, were expressly naturalised.

The country&#x27;s recent history of naturalising foreign players such as Murilo de Almeida, Fellipe Bertoldo, Diogo Rangel, Rodrigo Silva, Jairo Neto, Ramon Saro, Alan Leandro, Thiago Cunha, Juninho and Heberty has been criticized by many, including native East Timorese players and fans.

In a match on 8 October 2015 against Palestine seven of the starting eleven for the Timorese line-up were naturalized Brazilians. Following the match the Palestinian Football Association made a complaint to FIFA stating that the naturalized Timorese players were not eligible to represent Timor-Leste under FIFA rules.

Following a concern from some Timorese who complained to the prime minister, the prosecutor general and the minister for justice regarding the naturalisation program, Timor Leste Football Federation (FFTL) decided to drop their overseas-born legion. It meant Timor-Leste would be without seven naturalised Brazilian players for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and 2019 AFC Asian Cup joint qualifiers match against United Arab Emirates on 12 November 2015. In that match, coach Fernando Alcântara played an all national line up including six who were under twenty, including Ervino Soares who was 16. Timor-Leste ended up losing the match 8–0. Alcântara took responsibility for the defeat although he also added that he had been forced to play such an inexperienced line-up by the FFTL.

The next match, Timor-Leste did even worse, suffering a record 0–10 home defeat to a strong Saudi Arabia side, who eventually qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Jesse Pinto, an Australian-Timorese footballer, told reporters that the FFTL gives Brazilian players Timorese passports so that they can be registered as &quot;Asian&quot; players and meet the quotas of teams. Pinto also added that the FFTL often takes advantage of players from poor backgrounds, but that it often did not meet its promises of allowing players to travel back to Brazil to meet their families.

In December 2016, the FFTL was charged with using forged and falsified documents, fielding ineligible players and bringing the game into disrepute.

A decision was made on 20 January 2017 that Timor-Leste is barred from participating in the qualification tournament for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup after being found to have fielded a total of twelve ineligible players in 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification matches and among other competitions.

Previous kit makers include Mitre, Joma, Nike and Tiger.

=== Home stadium ===
Timor Leste&#x27;s home ground is the National Stadium of Timor-Leste in Dili. The stadium capacity is 5,000. The first official match played in the stadium was a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Mongolia on 12 March 2015. Timor-Leste played their last match at the National Stadium of Timor-Leste against Saudi Arabia on 17 November 2015 and since then used their stadium as a neutral ground all over East Asia.

<text>Alain David Jourgensen (born Alejandro Ramírez Casas; October 9, 1958) is a Cuban-American singer, musician and music producer. Closely related with the independent record label Wax Trax! Records, his musical career spans four decades. He is the frontman and lyricist of the industrial metal band Ministry, which he founded in 1981 and of which he remains the only constant member. He was the primary musician of several Ministry-related projects, such as Revolting Cocks, Lard, and Buck Satan and the 666 Shooters. Jourgensen is a prominent figure in industrial music, influencing numerous other groups and musicians, both in alternative and industrial-associated acts.

Born in Havana shortly before the Cuban Revolution of 1959, at the age of three Jourgensen moved to the United States with his family, and was raised mainly in Chicago and Breckenridge, Colorado. He developed an interest in music at a young age, and was involved in several short-lived bands, as well as briefly performing in the backing band of drag performer Divine.

Jourgensen formed Ministry in 1981 in Chicago and received significant attention from music press regarding the band&#x27;s 1983 debut studio album, &quot;With Sympathy&quot;. His subsequent releases in the 1980s, most prominently Ministry&#x27;s &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot; (1989), showcased his stylistic transition; in the early 1990s, he achieved mainstream success with Ministry&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs&quot; (1992). The next few years were marked by publicity surrounding Jourgensen&#x27;s substance abuse which negatively affected his creative output and resulted in a period of severe depression; during this time, Jourgensen and Ministry appeared in the 2001 Steven Spielberg film &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;.

In 2005, Jourgensen established his own record label, 13th Planet Records, through which several Ministry records, among others, were released until the early 2010s. Currently Jourgensen and Ministry are signed to Nuclear Blast Records.

== Early life ==
Alejandro Ramírez Casas was born in Havana, Cuba, on October 9, 1958, the son of Margarita &quot;Maggie&quot; Brouwer (born c. 1942) and the grandson of Julio Brouwer, a biologist. Jourgensen, who is of Dutch and Spanish heritage, says he does not remember anything about his real father. In 1961, following the fall of Fulgencio Batista&#x27;s regime and rise of Fidel Castro to power, his family relocated to the US. In 1964, Brouwer married Ed Jourgensen, a stock car driver and mechanic for Formula One driver Dan Gurney. She adopted his surname, which is Norwegian, for herself and her son.

Jourgensen was raised in Chicago, Illinois, and Breckenridge, Colorado, attending Greeley High School and Summit County High School in Frisco, Colorado, in 1976. He was a fan of a wide range of artists including the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Hawkwind, Led Zeppelin, Hank Williams and George Jones. After seeing the Ramones on stage in Denver, Jourgensen decided to be a punk musician.

Jourgensen eventually attended the University of Illinois Chicago, after briefly enrolling at both the University of Northern Colorado and the University of Colorado.

== Professional life ==

=== Ministry ===
Jourgensen formed Ministry in 1981 after leaving Special Affect, a post-punk band that included Frankie Nardiello, founding member (as Groovie Mann) of My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult and drummer Harry Rushakoff of Concrete Blonde). Early singles by Ministry and Jourgensen&#x27;s other projects were released on Wax Trax! Records. He also produced Skinny Puppy&#x27;s &quot;Rabies&quot; album. During that time, Jourgensen befriended Nivek Ogre, who later toured with Ministry.

The band broke into the mainstream with 1992&#x27;s &quot;Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs&quot; album. Its opening track, &quot;N.W.O.&quot;, was nominated for a 1993 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, losing to Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Wish&quot;. However, its next album, &quot;Filth Pig&quot; (1996), divided their fan base, leading to a commercial decline that became evident when Warner Bros. Records dropped them from the label in 2001.

Ministry&#x27;s next albums, &quot;Rio Grande Blood&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Last Sucker&quot; (2007), as well as the 2006 Revolting Cocks album &quot;Cocked and Loaded&quot;, were released on Jourgensen&#x27;s new record label, 13th Planet Records, which he formed after falling out with the mainstream agendas of major industry labels.

At the specific request of director Stanley Kubrick, Jourgensen appeared with Ministry in the film &quot;A.I.: Artificial Intelligence&quot;. He related his conversation with Kubrick in an interview:

Well, first of all, I hung up on him. I thought it was a crank call. His secretary was calling and I was like, &#x27;Yeah, right.&#x27; Click. And then he called back personally and then talked to me, and I was just freaked out. I mean, who wouldn&#x27;t be freaked out? Here&#x27;s this eccentric American God living in the countryside of England, and he&#x27;s calling me up in Austin, Texas, and saying he wants me to do the music for his film and he wants me to be in his film and he&#x27;s famous and all that. I didn&#x27;t even believe it.

Ministry continued its involvement with the film project after Kubrick&#x27;s death, and Jourgensen revealed that after initial tension with Steven Spielberg, partly due to Jourgensen&#x27;s prank when he claimed being told that &quot;A.I.&quot; stood for &quot;Anal Intruder&quot; and threatening to walk off production because it was not a porn film, he and Spielberg enjoyed a friendly relationship, with two compositions appearing on the soundtrack: &quot;What About Us&quot; and &quot;Dead Practice&quot;.

A number of his songs also appear in other films, such as &quot;Wicked Lake&quot; (2008)—produced by Fever Dreams and ZP Studios—for which he composed the entire soundtrack that was released on his own 13th Planet record label—he also makes a small appearance in the film as an art school teacher.

In a November 2008 issue of &quot;Hustler Magazine&quot;, Jourgensen announced that Ministry was officially finished, as the band &quot;[took] up so much time&quot; and releasing new albums was difficult. He also explained that he was responsible for six other bands and could complete seven albums within a year when he was not working on new Ministry material. However, despite Jourgensen&#x27;s insistence that Ministry would never return, a reunion was announced on August 7, 2011. A new album, entitled &quot;Relapse&quot;, was released on March 26, 2012.

At his 57th birthday listening party in Chicago he announced a new project called, SMM or Surgical Meth Machine. In an interview with In The Loop Magazine, Jourgensen stated, &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to get this record out. If you&#x27;re a fan of Ministry, you&#x27;re gonna freak out on this. It&#x27;s got the whole range of my career as a musician in it even sound of earlier stuff from the beginning.&quot;

In 2016 March, Jourgensen noted he had a project with Arabian Prince; this collaboration was later confirmed for a new Ministry album.

In February 2024, Jourgensen announced that he would like to make one last Ministry album. That pending swan song will also find the outfit reuniting with Paul Barker, who served as their producer/bassist/keyboardist/programmer, etc. throughout Ministry‘s commercial peak from 1986 through to 2003.

=== Revolting Cocks ===
Revolting Cocks, also known as RevCo, is an American industrial rock band that began as a musical side project for Richard 23 of Front 242, Luc van Acker, and Jourgensen. The band took their name after being involved in a fight in a Chicago bar in 1983: Jourgensen, Richard 23 and Van Acker, celebrating the formation of their new band with a few drinks, ended the evening in a brawl, with bar stools thrown through the windows. As he ejected the trio, the owner—a man who Jourgensen recalls was named Dess—shouted, &quot;I&#x27;m calling the police! You guys are a bunch of revolting cocks!&quot; The trio decided to use the name for their band.

The band have changed lineups several times. RevCo currently features Jourgensen (guitars, keyboards, programming, background vocals, producer), Josh Bradford (vocals, background vocals), Sin Quirin (guitars, bass, keyboards) and Clayton Worbeck (keyboards, programming, mixing, bass). Their seventh album, &quot;Sex-O Olympic-O&quot;, which was produced by Jourgensen at his studio, was released on his 13th Planet label in March 2008. The follow-up album, &quot;Got Cock?&quot;, was released in March 2010 on the same label. A remix album of &quot;Got Cock?&quot;, titled &quot;Got Mixxx?&quot;, was released in 2011.

=== Other bands and projects ===
During the late 1980s, Jourgensen started a short-lived side project named 1000 Homo DJs, under the pseudonym Buck Satan. 1000 Homo DJs released two singles, including a cover of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Supernaut.&quot; Also in 1989, Jourgensen was involved in Acid Horse, a collaboration between the members of Ministry and Cabaret Voltaire. In 2015, Jourgensen announced that he started &quot;a speed metal project&quot; named Surgical Meth Machine with engineer and longtime collaborator Sam D&#x27;Ambruoso. The project&#x27;s self-titled album was released on April 15, 2016.

=== Production work ===
Jourgensen and his Ministry bandmate Paul Barker worked as a music production team under the names Hypo Luxa and Hermes Pan, producing their own work as well as other Wax Trax! Records acts. Jourgensen also produced music for Reverend Horton Heat, Skinny Puppy, Dessau, Skrew, Rigor Mortis, The Blackouts, and DethRok. Jourgensen&#x27;s recording complex for the 13th Planet label was located at his former home in El Paso, Texas.

== Musicianship ==
Jourgensen has played a multitude of instruments throughout his career, including guitars, bass, violin, banjo, keyboards, piano, pedal steel guitar, trumpets and drums to name a few. However, he claims he is &quot;not really good at any of them.&quot; He said, &quot;I&#x27;m jack of all trades and master of none. But I can collage bits and pieces together musically.&quot;

Jourgensen&#x27;s singing style has varied throughout the years. On Ministry&#x27;s early releases such as &quot;With Sympathy&quot; and &quot;Twitch&quot;, he sang with a fake British accent, which he regrets. Inspired by The 13th Floor Elevators, Jourgensen started utilizing vocal effects beginning with &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; to distort his voice using Eventide. In 2006, starting with &quot;Rio Grande Blood&quot;, Jourgensen switched to a more thrash metal approach.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships and family ===

Jourgensen was married to Patty Marsh from 1984 to 1995 and the relationship produced one daughter. In 2002, he married Angelina Lukacin. In July 2014, he announced that they were divorced.

Jourgensen&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen&quot;, was released in July 2013.

=== Legal and health issues ===
In 1995, police raided Ministry&#x27;s Texas headquarters and Jourgensen was arrested for possession of heroin. He received a five-year probation sentence. Jourgensen was dependent upon heroin for twenty years. Jourgensen kicked his heavy drug (heroin, methadone, crack, pills) habit, and as of 2019, he has limited his intake to beer, marijuana, and psilocybin mushrooms.

Jourgensen almost lost his arm and foot in two separate incidents, the first due to a spider bite, the second the result of a hypodermic needle wound.

=== Body art ===
Throughout the years, Jourgensen has amassed a large number of tattoos. In 2012, he underwent facial piercings after a bet with his daughter; she called him a &quot;pussy&quot; for not having any piercings, while Jourgensen called her the same thing for not having any tattoos. They then decided to have their tattoos and piercings done respectively to create a &quot;pact&quot;. He had 16 facial piercings done in one sitting.

<text>José Luís Lopes Costa e Silva (born 17 May 1958), known as José Luís, is a Portuguese former footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.

==Club career==
Born in Lisbon, José Luís was promoted to hometown&#x27;s S.L. Benfica&#x27;s first team at only 18, finishing his first season with 25 matches, 20 starts and two goals as the club won the Primeira Liga championship. Until the end of his tenure he was irregularly used, his best years being 1983 to 1985 as he appeared in 57 games combined – six goals – and won the 1984 league and the following year&#x27;s Portuguese Cup; he also played the full 90 minutes in the 1982–83 UEFA Cup final&#x27;s first hand, a 0–1 away loss against R.S.C. Anderlecht (1–2 on aggregate).

José Luís left Benfica in summer 1987 and signed for C.S. Marítimo, competing in a further four top division campaigns and eventually amassing totals in the competition of 283 matches and 28 goals. He retired in June 1993 at the age of 35, after two years with A.D. Ovarense in the second level.

Subsequently, José Luís worked as a manager in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Vietnam, also coaching teams in his country&#x27;s third division (including his former club Marítimo&#x27;s reserves).

==International career==
José Luís played four times for Portugal during two years, his debut being on 21 September 1983 against Finland for the UEFA Euro 1984 qualifiers, scoring the fourth goal in a 5–0 home win. He was not, however, picked for the final stages in France, with the nation finishing third.

José Luís was appointed at newly created East Timor national team in late 2004, coaching the country in its first-ever international competition, the 2004 Tiger Cup.


==Managerial career==
In March 2013, ahead of the I-League Second Division kickoff, he joined Kenkre as head coach. The club then brought three of their first foreigners, Portuguese Rodilson Felisberto Fernandes Dias, Domingo De Jesus Gomes, Bruno Daniel Alciaes, and Australian Daniel Atkins.

==Personal life==
José Luís&#x27; younger, brother, Jorge, was also a footballer. A striker, they shared teams in all the clubs the former represented.

<doc id="1259031" wikidata="Q866078" url="?curid=1259031" title="Ishibashi handai-mae Station">
<text>is a train station located in Ikeda, Osaka, but is on the border with Toyonaka to the south and Minoh to the east. It serves as a transfer point for the Hankyu Minoo Line on one side and on the other side is an express station on the Hankyu Takarazuka Line．The station has five platforms connected by tunnels, two for Osaka-Takarazuka service, and three for Minoo service.

The station is near to one of the three campuses of Osaka University, though the campus is physically located in neighbouring Toyonaka City. The station is surrounded by bars, karaoke boxes, and izakaya restaurants along with more traditional small-stall shopping streets.

The word Ishibashi literally means Stone Bridge, referring to the old stone street bridge immediately north of the station over a small river that serves as the northern end of the shopping area, which is called &quot;Akai hashi&quot;.

==Layout==
There are three platforms with five tracks on the ground level.


==History==
The station opened concurrently with the opening of the Takarazuka Line and the Mino-o Line on 10 March 1910. Since then the structure of the station as an interchange of the two lines has not been largely changed except for the stretched platforms.

On 25 June 1952, hours before the first scheduled train of the day, hundreds of protesters against the Korean War who left a meeting at the Osaka University campus thronged Ishibashi Station and forced station master to run a train to transport them to Osaka. After getting off the forcedly operated train at Hattori Station, they marched and burst into Suita Classification Yard of Japanese National Railways. As a result, more than one hundred people were arrested on charge of riot. The incident is called the Suita Incident.

On October 1, 2019, the station was renamed from Ishibashi to Ishibashi handai-mae,

<text>University Square () is located in Bucharest city centre, near the University of Bucharest. It is served by Universitate metro station.

Four statues can be found in the University Square, in front of the university; they depict Ion Heliade Rădulescu (1879), Michael the Brave (1874), Gheorghe Lazăr (1889) and Spiru Haret (1932).

The Ion Luca Caragiale Bucharest National Theatre and the Intercontinental Hotel (one of the tallest buildings in Bucharest) are also located near University Square.

University Square marks the northeastern boundary of the Old Center of Bucharest.

Since the end of 2014, after a project costing up to 65 million euros, the National Theatre has a new face, dominated by futuristic elements.

==History==
In the 15th century, here was the northern limit of the city. Around 1700, the limit was already around what is today Piața Romană (Roman Square). Thought to define the axes north–south and east–west of the city after 1880, &quot;the great crossroad&quot; (, ) follows the Haussmannian scenario of urban modernization – in the spirit of the Parisian influence of those times. This intersection has never evolved as a monumental square, but emerged as most important road junction of the capital at the geometric center of the city.

The Bucharest boulevards of those times hosted tram lines, and in the center of the intersection was placed the monument dedicated to Ion Brătianu, the square then bearing his name. This square was part of an east–west axis full of important monuments, starting in the east with the statue of C.A. Rossetti in Piața Rosetti (Rosetti Square) and culminating with the statue of Mihail Kogălniceanu in the eponymous square. University Square was established in 1857 as part of the creation of the University of Bucharest (architect Alexandru Orăscu), its character being defined by four statues, made over six decades: Michael the Brave (1876, sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse) and scholars Ion Heliade-Rădulescu (1882, Ettore Ferrari), Gheorghe Lazăr (1886, Ion Georgescu) and Spiru Haret (1935, Ion Jalea).

In 1679 the Princely Academy was built here, which in the 1857 century was to become the University of Bucharest. The university was built in several stages, following neoclassical aesthetic principles. The facade existing today was constructed between 1921 and 1943 (architect Nicolae Ghika-Budești).
Pedestrians can cross the streets only by University Passage, constructed during the development of M2 metro thoroughfare and leading, as well, to a metro station. The space that now extends from the InterContinental hotel and National Theatre once was home to an outdoor circus, around which existed shops with &quot;mititei&quot; (small Romanian sausages) and beer, and a stum shop named &quot;Zori de zi&quot; (Daylight). All this disappeared after urban planning in the 1960s proposed the idea of developing the area through tourism, cultural or administrative functions. Between 1968 and 1970 the Hotel InterContinental (architects Dinu Hariton, Gheorghe Nădrag, Ion Moscu and Romeo Belea) was built, and the new National Theatre was constructed between 1964 and 1973 in the style of that period, the halls being equipped with top stage installations. Damaged during the 1977 earthquake, the theater was rebuilt 1982–1984, under the aegis of Cezar Lăzărescu, in a heavy form and lacking spectacular elements. The square was the site of the 1990 Golaniad, a peaceful student protest against the ex-communists in the Romanian government. The demonstrations ended violently when miners from the Jiu Valley were called in by president Ion Iliescu to restore order in Bucharest (&quot;see: Mineriad&quot;).

==Events== 
In September 2014 the 2014 FIBA Europe 3x3 Championships, the European Championships of 3x3 basketball, were contested at the University Square.

<doc id="1259043" wikidata="Q4215979" url="?curid=1259043" title="Ajagae">
<text>Ajagae was a military and rebel leader in the Sangju area during the waning years of Unified Silla who led a local rebellion which seized Sangju and is remembered primarily as the father of Kyŏn Hwŏn, the founder and first king of Later Baekje. Some Kyŏn family lineages therefore claim him as their progenitor, although he was surnamed Yi. Ajagae was born and lived most of his life in Gaeun, in modern-day Mungyeong City, where he was a farmer. According to the &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot;, he was descended from King Jinheung of Silla, but clearly his branch of the family had lost its royal connection some time before.

Since there is no record of interactions between Ajagae and Kyŏn Hwŏn during their later years, it is possible that Ajagae was not really Kyŏn Hwŏn&#x27;s father. The records of the Later Three Kingdoms period, however, are too sparse to permit any conclusive judgment. It is equally possible that the two men became estranged after Kyŏn Hwŏn left home to join the Silla army.

<doc id="1259048" wikidata="Q95103" url="?curid=1259048" title="Joseph Pearce">
<text>Joseph Pearce (born February 12, 1961), is an English-born American writer, and Director of the Center for Faith and Culture at Aquinas College in Nashville, Tennessee, before which he held positions at Thomas More College of Liberal Arts in Merrimack, New Hampshire, Ave Maria College in Ypsilanti, Michigan and Ave Maria University in Ave Maria, Florida.

He is a co-editor of the &quot;St. Austin Review&quot;.

Pearce has written biographies of literary figures, often Christian, including William Shakespeare, J. R. R. Tolkien, Oscar Wilde, C. S. Lewis, G. K. Chesterton, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Hilaire Belloc.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Joseph Pearce was born in Barking, London, and brought up in Haverhill, Suffolk. His father, Albert Arthur Pearce, was a heavy drinker with a history of brawling in pubs with Irishmen and non-Whites, had an encyclopedic knowledge of English poetry and British military history, and an intense nostalgia for the vanished British Empire. In 1973 the family moved back to Barking in the East End of London, so that the Pearce boys would grow up with Cockney accents. Pearce had been a compliant pupil at the school in Haverhill, but at Eastbury comprehensive school in Barking he led the racist disruption of the lessons taught by a young Pakistani British mathematics teacher.

===Early political activity===

At 15, Pearce joined the youth wing of the National Front, an antisemitic and white supremacist political party advocating the compulsory repatriation of all legal immigrants and British-born non-Whites. He came to prominence in 1977 when he set up &quot;Bulldog&quot;, the NF&#x27;s openly racist newspaper. Like his father, Pearce became an enthusiastic supporter of Ulster Loyalism during the Troubles from 1978, and joined the Orange Order, a Protestant secret society closely linked to Ulster Loyalist paramilitary organizations. In 1980, he became editor of &quot;Nationalism Today&quot;, advocating white supremacy. Pearce was twice prosecuted and imprisoned under the Race Relations Act of 1976 for his writings, in 1981 and 1985. At one stage, he contacted John Tyndall to suggest coalition talks with the British National Party, but Tyndall rejected the plan. Pearce was a close associate of Nick Griffin, whom he helped to oust Martin Webster from the NF&#x27;s leadership. As a spokesman for the Strasserite Political Soldier faction within the NF, Pearce argued for white supremacy, publishing the &quot;Fight for Freedom!&quot; pamphlet in 1984. At the same time, however, Pearce adopted the group&#x27;s support for ethnopluralism, contacting the Iranian embassy in London in 1984 in a vain attempt to secure funding from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Pearce became a leading member of a new NF political faction known as the Flag Group, writing for its publications and contributing to its ideology. Pearce notably argued, based on the writings of G.K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc, for distributism as an alternative to both Marxism and Laissez faire Capitalism in a 1987 article for the party magazine &quot;Vanguard&quot;.

===Conversion===
Pearce decided to convert to Catholicism during his second prison term (1985-1986). He was received into the Catholic Church during Mass at Our Lady Mother of God Church in Norwich, England on Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day, 19 March 1989. Following the Mass, the women of the parish held a surprise party for Pearce, accompanied by a cake with, &quot;Welcome Home, Joe&quot;, emblazoned on it. Pearce has attributed his conversion to reading books by Catholic authors G. K. Chesterton, John Henry Newman, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Hilaire Belloc.

===Biographer===

====Catholic subjects====

As a Catholic author, Pearce has focused mainly on the life and work of English Catholic writers, such as J. R. R. Tolkien, G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc. &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that &quot;Old Thunder: A Life of Hilaire Belloc&quot; &quot;skates over&quot; Belloc&#x27;s antisemitism, &quot;the central disfiguring fact of his oeuvre&quot;.

He chose the pen name &quot;Robert Williamson&quot; after a character in the Ulster Loyalist ballad &quot;The Old Orange Flute&quot;, who, like Pearce, is an Orange Order member who converts to Roman Catholicism. Pearce&#x27;s biography of G. K. Chesterton, &quot;Wisdom and Innocence: A Life of G. K. Chesterton&quot;, was published, under the pseudonym of Robert Williamson, by Hodder and Stoughton in 1996. Jay P. Corrin, reviewing the book for &quot;The Catholic Historical Review&quot;, called it &quot;a venture of love and high praise&quot;, but which adds little to existing biographies. Its contribution, Corrin wrote, is its focus on Chesterton&#x27;s religious vision and personal relationships, contrasting his friendly style with the combative Belloc.

Pearce&#x27;s 2000 biography &quot;The Unmasking of Oscar Wilde&quot; focused on the conflict between Oscar Wilde&#x27;s homosexuality and his lifelong attraction to the Roman Catholic Church and how it was finally settled by his reception into the Church on his deathbed in Paris.

In a review for &quot;The Wildean&quot; Michael Seeney described Pearce&#x27;s biography as &quot;badly written and muddled&quot;, &quot;woefully poorly annotated&quot; and using &quot;odd sources without question&quot;. Seeney wrote that it &quot;does not &#x27;unmask&#x27; anything&quot;, but contains too much &quot;cod psychology&quot; and &quot;hyperbolic cliché&quot; to be a &quot;workmanlike biography&quot;.

In 2001, Pearce published a biography of Anglo-South African poet and Catholic convert Roy Campbell, followed in 2003 by an edited anthology of Campbell&#x27;s poetry and verse translations.

==== Tolkien ====

Pearce has written and published a variety of books of Tolkien studies. His essay &quot;Letting the Catholic Out of the Baggins&quot; discusses why. In 1997, the British people, in a nationwide poll by the Folio Society, voted &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; the greatest book of the 20th-century and the outraged reactions of literary celebrities such as Howard Jacobson, Griff Rhys Jones, and Germaine Greer, inspired Pearce to write the books &quot;Tolkien: Man and Myth&quot; (1998), &quot;Tolkien, a Celebration&quot; (1999) and &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Journey: Discovering the Hidden Meaning in The Hobbit&quot; (2012). All of Pearce&#x27;s Tolkien-themed books consider his subject&#x27;s person and writings from a Catholic perspective. Bradley J. Birzer writes in &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; that scholars had hardly discussed Tolkien&#x27;s Catholicism until Pearce&#x27;s &quot;Tolkien: Man and Myth&quot;, describing the book as &quot;outstanding&quot;, treating &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a &quot;theological thriller&quot; that &quot;inspired a whole new wave of Christian evaluations&quot;.

Pearce has credited his previously published books of Tolkien studies and &quot;the wave of Tolkien enthusiasm&quot; caused by Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, with making him into a celebrity intellectual following his 2001 emigration from England to the United States.

===Move to the United States===

Pearce married Susannah Brown, an Irish-American woman with family roots in Dungannon, County Tyrone, in St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Steubenville, Ohio in April 2001. They have two children. He then received a telephone call and a job offer from the President of Ave Maria College in Michigan. The Pearces arrived in the United States on September 7, 2001. Pearce recalls that his first day of teaching coincided with the September 11 attacks, &quot;making my arrival in the States something of a baptism of fire.&quot; The first issue of the Catholic literary magazine the &quot;St. Austin Review&quot;, which Pearce has coedited ever since alongside Robert Asch, was also published in September 2001.

Pearce was the host of the 2009 EWTN television series &quot;The Quest for Shakespeare&quot;. Based upon his eponymous book, the show is concerned with Pearce&#x27;s belief that Shakespeare was a Catholic.

In a 2014 essay, Pearce announced that he had become an American citizen.

In his 2017 stage play &quot;Death Comes for the War Poets&quot;, according to &quot;Catholic Arts Today&quot;, Pearce weaves &quot;a verse tapestry,&quot; about the military and spiritual journeys of war poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen.

In a 2022 interview with Pearce, Polish journalist Anna Szyda from the literary magazine &quot;Magna Polonia&quot; explained that the nihilism of modern American poetry is widely noticed and commented upon in the Third Polish Republic as reflecting, &quot;the deleterious influence of the contemporary civilisation on the American soul.&quot; In response, Pearce described &quot;the neo-formalist revival&quot; inspired by the late Richard Wilbur and how it has been reflected in recent verse by the Catholic poets whom he and Robert Asch publish in the &quot;St. Austin Review&quot;. Pearce said that the Catholic faith and optimism of the younger generation of Catholic poets made him feel hope for the future.

In July 2022, Pearce was a speaker at the 41st Annual Conference of the American Chesterton Society in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Pearce&#x27;s lecture was titled &quot;How Chesterton Saved Me from anti-Semitism&quot;.

<doc id="1259050" wikidata="Q203993" url="?curid=1259050" title="Peorð">
<text> is the rune denoting the sound &quot;p&quot; (voiceless bilabial stop) in the Elder Futhark runic alphabet. It does not appear in the Younger Futhark. It is named peorð in the Anglo-Saxon rune-poem and glossed enigmatically as follows:
:&quot;Peorð is a source of recreation and amusement to the great, where warriors sit happily together in the beerhall.&quot;

The name is not comprehensible from Old English, i.e. no word similar to &quot;peorð&quot; is known in this language. 
According to a 9th-century manuscript of Alcuin (Codex Vindobonensis 795), written using the Gothic alphabet in Britain, the letters &quot;p&quot; (based on a Greek Π) and &quot;q&quot; (an inverted Π) are called &quot;pairþra&quot; and &quot;qairþra&quot;, respectively. One of these names clearly is derived from the other. However, the names are not comprehensible in Gothic either, and it is not clear which is derived from which, although it is known that the Elder Futhark had a &quot;p&quot;, but no &quot;q&quot; rune. 
In any case, it seems evident that peorð is related to pairþra. 
The Anglo-Saxon futhorc adopted exactly the same approach for the addition of a labiovelar rune, &quot;cƿeorð&quot;, in both shape and name based on peorð, but it is not known if the Gothic runes already had a similar variant rune of &quot;p&quot;, or if the labiovelar letter was a 4th-century creation of Ulfilas.

The Common Germanic name could be referring to a pear-tree (or perhaps generally a fruit-tree). 
Based on the context of &quot;recreation and amusement&quot; given in the rune poem, a common speculative interpretation is that the intended meaning is &quot;pear-wood&quot; as the material of either a woodwind instrument, or a &quot;game box&quot; or game pieces made from wood.

From &quot;peorð&quot;, Proto-Germanic form *perðu, *perþō or *perþaz may be reconstructed on purely phonological grounds. The expected Proto-Germanic term for &quot;pear tree&quot; would be &quot;*pera-trewô&quot; (&quot;*pera&quot; being, however, a post-Proto-Germanic loan, either West Germanic, or Common Germanic, if Gothic &quot;pairþra&quot; meant &quot;pear tree&quot;, from Vulgar Latin &quot;pirum&quot; (plural &quot;pira&quot;), itself of unknown origin). 
The Ogham letter name Ceirt, glossed as &quot;apple tree&quot;, may in turn be a loan from Germanic into Primitive Irish.

The earliest attestation of the rune is in the Kylver Stone &quot;futhark&quot; row (ca. AD 400). The earliest example in a linguistic context (as opposed to an &quot;abecedarium&quot;) is already in futhorc, in the Kent II, III and IV coin inscriptions (the personal names &quot;pada&quot; and &quot;æpa&quot;/&quot;epa&quot;), dated to ca. AD 700. On St. Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin (AD 698), a &quot;p&quot; rune takes the place of Greek Ρ. The Westeremden yew-stick (ca. AD 750) has &quot;op hæmu&quot; &quot;at home&quot; and &quot;up duna&quot; &quot;on the hill&quot;.

Looijenga (1997) speculates that the &quot;p&quot; rune arose as a variant of the &quot;b&quot; rune, parallel to the secondary nature of Ogham &quot;peith&quot;. The uncertainty surrounding the rune is a consequence of the rarity of the &quot;*p&quot; phoneme in Proto-Germanic.

The rune is discontinued in Younger Futhark, which expresses /p/ with the &quot;b&quot; rune, for example on the Viking Age Skarpåker Stone,

<text>The Old Vicarage in the Cambridgeshire village of Grantchester is a house associated with the poet Rupert Brooke, who lived nearby and in 1912 referenced it in an eponymous poem – &quot;The Old Vicarage, Grantchester&quot;. The house is next door to The Orchard tea garden, also part of the poem. A portrait statue of Brooke by Paul Day stands in the front garden. 

The Old Vicarage was built in around 1685 on the site of an earlier building, a minute&#x27;s walk from the Church of St Andrew and St Mary. It passed from church ownership into private hands in 1820, and was bought in 1850 by Samuel Page Widnall (1825–1894), who extended it and established a printing business, the Widnall Press.

In 1910 it was owned by Henry and Florence Neeve from whom Rupert Brooke rented a room and, later, a large part of the house. Brooke&#x27;s mother bought the house in 1916 and gave it to his friend, the economist Dudley Ward. In December 1979, it was bought by the scientist Mary Archer, who had recently been appointed to a position at Cambridge University, and her husband Jeffrey Archer, then a politician and subsequently a novelist. The house has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since August 1962.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; crossword setter John Galbraith Graham (Araucaria) set a clue often described as epitomising his clue-making: &quot;Poetical scene with surprisingly chaste Lord Archer vegetating (3, 3, 8, 12)&quot;, the last four words forming the anagram .

<doc id="1259054" wikidata="Q2652386" url="?curid=1259054" title="Blood of Elves">
<text>Blood of Elves () is the first novel in &quot;The Witcher&quot; series written by the Polish fantasy writer Andrzej Sapkowski, first published in Poland in 1994. It is a sequel to the &quot;Witcher &quot;short stories collected in the books &quot;The Last Wish&quot; and &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot; and is followed by &quot;Time of Contempt&quot;. The book won the Janusz A. Zajdel Award in 1994 and the David Gemmell Legend Award in 2009. An English translation was published in the United Kingdom in 2008 (Gollancz) and in the United States in 2009 (Orbit).

==Plot==
About a year before the beginning of the novel, the Empire of Nilfgaard attacks the Kingdom of Cintra. Queen Calanthe, mortally wounded, commits suicide and her granddaughter, Cirilla, nicknamed Ciri, flees from the burning capital city. Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard, sends his spies to find her, as, in addition to her royal lineage, Ciri has one quarter of elven blood, giving her immense magical potential. The war ends with Nilfgaard&#x27;s defeat by a coalition of the Northern Kingdoms, though the Empire retains much of its power.

Almost two years after the armistice, the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms meet in secret to discuss the political situation. Peace with Nilfgaard is not what it was supposed to be – the Empire&#x27;s financial clout is ruining the northern economy, Imperial emissaries agitate aristocrats and merchants against their monarchs, elves and dwarves have formed partisan groups called &quot;Scoia&#x27;tael&quot; and are conducting acts of terror against humans – and cultists are prophesying that the world will end, unless the Savior comes from the South. The kings decide to start a war, before the Empire weakens their countries further, and to regain Cintra. They are aware that the Emperor is looking for Ciri to marry her (morganatically), and thus legitimize his occupation of Cintra. To prevent this, the monarchs decide to find and kill Ciri.

Ciri is being protected by the Witcher Geralt of Rivia, a magically and genetically mutated monster-slayer-for-hire, who takes her to the witchers&#x27; keep, Kaer Morhen, to be trained by the few remaining witchers. The oldest witcher, Vesemir, asks the sorceress Triss Merigold to help with strange behavior he had seen in Ciri. Triss eventually realizes that Ciri is a &quot;Source&quot;. As she is unable to control Ciri&#x27;s talent, she advises Geralt to seek help from his former lover Yennefer, a more experienced sorceress.

At the same time, the wizard Rience is searching for Ciri, serving an unknown powerful mage. He captures Geralt&#x27;s friend, Dandilion the bard, and tortures him for information about Ciri. Dandilion is saved by the arrival of Yennefer, who engages in a magic duel with Rience. Rience escapes with his master&#x27;s help, but is scarred from the encounter.

In the spring, Geralt leaves Kaer Morhen with Triss and Ciri, to deliver Ciri to the Temple School in Ellander where she would receive a &quot;normal&quot; education from the priestess Nenneke. On the way, Triss falls ill, and they join Yarpen Zigrin&#x27;s dwarven company, who is leading a caravan for King Henselt of Kaedwen. Geralt tells Ciri about the roses of Aelirenn, an elf who died leading elven youths to fight the humans in a hopeless attack. The caravan is attacked by the Scoia&#x27;tael, and it is revealed that the escort mission was a trap set by the kings who doubted Yarpen&#x27;s loyalty.

Meanwhile, Geralt tracks Rience and his employer. With the help of Dandilion, the medical student Shani, and the sorceress Philippa Eilhart, he forces a confrontation with Rience, during which both are injured. Rience&#x27;s master intervenes again, opening a portal for him, and Geralt is prevented from pursuing by Eilhart.

Some time in the future, Yennefer and Ciri are about to leave the Temple School in Ellander. Yennefer asks Ciri whether she did not like her at first. A series of flashbacks details Ciri&#x27;s studies with Yennefer, from the day they were introduced and back to the present. Ciri&#x27;s stay in Ellander had been haunted by disturbing dreams until Yennefer&#x27;s arrival, who started educating her in magic. From an initial antagonism, their relationship developed into a mother-daughter bond. Ciri admits that she did not like Yennefer, at first, and they leave.

==Characters==
* Geralt of Rivia. A Witcher, a human who has been transformed into a supernatural monster-slayer by the ingestion of various mutagens. Although Witchers rarely get involved in politics, Geralt takes under his charge a political refugee called Ciri, the granddaughter of the previous Queen of Cintra, a kingdom destroyed by Nilfgaardian invaders. He is the protagonist of tie-in videogames &quot;The Witcher&quot;, &quot;The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings&quot; and &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot;.
* Triss Merigold. A powerful sorceress and member of the Chapter of Wizards, Triss wields significant power and unclear motives.
* Cirilla, &quot;the Lion-Cub of Cintra&quot;, is the young granddaughter of the deceased and overthrown Queen Calanthe of Cintra. The blood of the elves flow through her veins, and she is hunted down for the mysterious yet dangerous power which she possesses.
* Dandelion. Geralt&#x27;s best friend. A charming, famous poet who is also a spy for the King of Redania.
* Yennefer of Vengerberg. Another member of the Chapter of Wizards, and an on-again off-again lover of Geralt&#x27;s. Considered more powerful than even Triss Merrigold, Yennefer is called upon to try and gain an understanding of Ciri&#x27;s power.
* Philippa Eilhart. A senior sorceress of the Chapter of Wizards, and trusted advisor to the King of Redania, alongside royal spymaster Sigismund Dijkstra. She is one of the few mages that has mastered the rare art of magical polymorphy, enabling her to transform into an owl. She aids Geralt in tracking down the renegade mage Rience who is looking for Ciri on behalf of Nilfgaard and another more powerful mage, whom she does not want Geralt to be aware of.

==Production==
With the positive reader reception to his &quot;The Witcher&quot; short stories, Andrzej Sapkowski decided to write a fantasy saga. He claimed that Polish publishers at the time believed only fantasy authors from Anglophone countries were worth publishing and that Polish writers of the genre were too risky. SuperNowa were the only publisher willing to take the risk, and &quot;Now everybody envies&quot; them. For the saga, the author expanded on the story he had used for &quot;A Question of Price&quot; and &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot;; the universally known fairy tale in which a monster or sorcerer saves somebody&#x27;s life and then demands payment.

<doc id="1259056" wikidata="Q7990592" url="?curid=1259056" title="Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck">
<text>Whammy! (subtitled &quot;The All-New &quot;Press Your Luck for its first season) is an American television game show that aired new episodes on Game Show Network (GSN) from April 15, 2002, to December 5, 2003. The series was produced by Fremantle North America, in association with GSN. The main goal of the game is to earn as much money and prizes as possible through collecting spins by answering trivia questions correctly, then using those spins on a gameboard to win various prizes and cash amounts while attempting to avoid the show&#x27;s eponymous character, the &quot;Whammy.&quot; Contestants who do land on a Whammy lose all their prizes accumulated to that point; four Whammies eliminates a contestant from the game. The program is an updated version of &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;, which originally aired on CBS from September 19, 1983, to September 26, 1986. The series was taped at Tribune Studios and was hosted by Todd Newton, with Gary Kroeger announcing. The show aired in reruns on GSN until 2017, and came back on May 11, 2020, up until October 1, 2021.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay remained largely similar to &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;, with contestants accumulating cash and prizes and attempting to avoid landing on a Whammy, who took away the winnings of any contestant who landed on it. At the start of the game, each of the three contestants was spotted $1,000 and took turns taking one spin at a time on the board. After each cycle of spins, additional Whammies were added to the board replacing cash values or prizes, and contestants chose to spin again or freeze with their score at that point. Any contestant who hit a Whammy was eliminated from play for the rest of the round. Play continued until all three contestants froze or hit a Whammy. Cash values ranged from $100–$1,500 in round one, and prizes of similar values also appeared.

Round two consisted of five questions (four in some episodes) posed to the players. The host read a question, and one of the contestants buzzed-in and provided a response. Their response, along with two other choices, were provided to the other two contestants, who selected one of the choices. Correct answers earned three spins for a buzz-in answer and one spin for a multiple choice answer. After five questions, all three contestants advanced to the final round.

In the final round, cash values ranged from $500–$5,000, and some spaces offered additional spins in addition to cash. Other spaces offered the choice of up to four adjacent spaces, or directed the contestants directly to another space. Any contestant who accumulated a total of four Whammies, including any that were hit in round one, was eliminated from the game. In Season Two, whenever a contestant that has been eliminated from the game by hitting a fourth Whammy, the whammy will show the contestant&#x27;s scoreboard. Also added to the board were &quot;Double Whammies,&quot; which, in addition to bankruptcy, added a physical consequence following the Whammy&#x27;s appearance (e.g. spraying the contestant with water or dropping ping-pong balls on them). Play began with the contestant with the lowest score at the start of the round, or, in the case of a tie for last place, the contestant with the fewest spins. If there was still a tie in terms of score and spin totals, the contestant farthest to the left went first.

Spins earned in this round could be passed to the opponent with the higher total (if they were tied, the contestant passing the spins could choose the recipient). Contestants were required to use all spins passed until they used their spins or hit a Whammy; in the latter case, any remaining passed spins were transferred to their earned spin total. If a contestant using passed spins hit a space that awarded a spin (e.g., $3,000 + One Spin), that spin was added to the earned total. The contestant in the lead at the end of the game kept any cash and/or prizes in their bank at that time. Unlike its predecessors, three new contestants appeared on each episode.

===Other features===
In round one, the board featured a &quot;Pick-a-Prize&quot; space. Contestants who landed on it could choose any prize on the board at the time. In round two, one space labeled &quot;$2,000 or Lose-1-Whammy&quot; gave the contestant a choice of a cash prize of $2,000 or removing a previously landed-upon Whammy (also seen on the classic show). &quot;$1,000 or Spin Again&quot; offered the choice of a $1,000 cash prize or the opportunity to spin again (without using an earned spin), in season two, the cash award of this space was lowered to $555.

Contestants also had an opportunity to win a Gem Car during the game. To claim the prize, the contestant needed to land on the &quot;GEM&quot; space in round one, and avoid landing on a Whammy for the rest of the round. In round two, the contestant needed to land on the &quot;CAR&quot; space, and again avoid the Whammy, and also win the game. In season two, the GEM car was replaced with a Suzuki Aerio SX, and the contestant needed to claim both halves of a car key in order to win the prize; only one half was on the board at any given time.

A new feature called &quot;Big Bank&quot; was added for the second season. The Big Bank on each episode was a cumulative jackpot that began at $3,000, and any cash and prizes that the contestants lost after landing on a Whammy (including halves of the car key) were added to the Big Bank. If a contestant landed on the Big Bank square, Todd Newton asked an open-ended general knowledge question to the contestant, who could claim the money and prizes in the Big Bank with a correct answer. Once the Big Bank was claimed by a contestant, it was reset to $3,000.

&quot;Whammy!&quot; made use of technological advances that had been developed since the original &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; ended its run in the 1980s. For example, the prizes and light patterns for each space on the Big Board were randomly generated using a personal computer, running at a speed of 200 MHz. This resulted in a very large number of patterns for gameplay, which prevented memorisation of patterns as Michael Larson did on &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; (the same holds true for all subsequent versions, Todd Newton once referred to it as “Larson-proof”). Also, the Whammy animations were animated in 3D computer graphics, rather than being digitally hand-drawn as on &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;.

==Production==

Game Show Network (GSN) acquired the rights to air &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; in September 2001, and high viewership ratings prompted the network to order a revival of the series. Two pilots were taped on February 13, 2002: one with original &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; host Peter Tomarken and the other hosted by Todd Newton. Newton was ultimately chosen to host the show. Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, &quot;It was terribly hurtful and I think I was doomed before I did [the audition]. I remember being told, &#x27;No, no. Be nice. Be sure everybody likes you.&#x27; I took that advice with the pilot. I made the same mistake.&quot; Tomarken also acknowledged that GSN wanted to employ a younger host in an effort to attract a younger audience.

GSN produced 65 episodes for the first season, which began airing April 15, 2002. The series was eventually renewed for a second season, which consisted of 65 additional episodes that premiered March 17, 2003. Following the conclusion of the Tournament of Champions, which completed its run on July 25, 2003, a combination of first-run new episodes and reruns continued to air until December 5. Additionally, a short-lived Filipino version of the show aired on GMA Network in 2007–08. The series, entitled &quot;Whammy! Push Your Luck&quot;, was hosted by Paolo Bediones and Rufa Mae Quinto.

===Special episodes===
The show aired four holiday specials: a Mother&#x27;s Day special (featuring an all-cash board and with Karen Grassle (&quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;), Estelle Harris (&quot;Seinfeld&quot;) and Mimi Kennedy as contestants)), a Halloween special (featuring contestants in costume), a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day special (with the contestants wearing green, and all the whammy animations in green as well), and an April Fools&#x27; Day special that featured Graham Elwood (from &quot;Cram&quot;) as the episode&#x27;s host, with Newton only appearing when a contestant hit a Double Whammy.

Janie Litras and Ed Long appeared on a special episode coinciding with GSN&#x27;s documentary &quot;Big Bucks: The &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; Scandal&quot;. Litras and Long originally appeared on the episodes airing June 8 and 11, 1984, competing against Michael Larson, who had memorized the light pattern and went on to win $110,237. Larson&#x27;s brother, James, competed in the 2003 episode against Litras and Long, as Michael had died of throat cancer in 1999. Tomarken made a special appearance hosting the question round of this episode, which would be his last television appearance before his death in a plane crash in 2006. James would win the game with a digital grand piano worth $6,695. After the game, Newton commented, &quot;The legacy continues.&quot;

The July 21, 2003 episode featured a &quot;Tournament of Losers&quot; starring three past contestants who had lost their previous games. July 22–25 of that same week in 2003 featured a Tournament of Champions, with nine of the biggest winners to that point competing for additional cash and prizes. The winners on the Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday episodes returned to compete against each other on the Friday episode in the finale of the tournament. Friday&#x27;s episode featured higher-valued spaces in both rounds, and the eventual winner also received a Suzuki Aerio SX as a bonus prize in addition to their grand total winnings.

==Reception==
&quot;Whammy!&quot; lasted on GSN for only two seasons, leading Garin Pirnia of &quot;Mental Floss&quot; to deem the series &quot;[not] a huge hit like its predecessor.&quot; At the sixth World Media Economics Conference, Eileen O&#x27;Neill and Marianne Barrett listed &quot;Whammy!&quot; among several television series that used creative methods of advertising in their programs, noting GSN&#x27;s ability to &quot;encourage viewers to watch the programs live.&quot; The series was also mentioned in Steve Ryan and Fred Wostbrock&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimate TV Game Show Book&quot; in a list of GSN original programs. It would not be until 2019 that another revival of &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; would air, with this version being hosted by Elizabeth Banks on ABC.

<text>The Iarnród Éireann (IÉ) / Northern Ireland Railways 201 Class locomotives are the newest and most powerful diesel locomotives operating in Ireland and were built between 1994 and 1995 by General Motors Diesel. They are model type JT42HCW, fitted with an EMD 12-710G3B engine of , weigh and have a maximum speed of .

==History==
By the early 1990s, the locomotives operating passenger services in Ireland were becoming increasingly obsolete, with the newest type in service being the 071 Class introduced in 1976. The economic boom in Ireland in the mid-1990s allowed Iarnród Éireann to begin significant investment in the infrastructure of the railways, which began with an order for 32 brand new express locomotives from GM-EMD. Northern Ireland Railways also purchased 2. The first were delivered in 1994, with deliveries continuing until 1995.

To allow clearance tests and driver training to commence in advance of the delivery of the main order of 201s, it was decided to transport the first locomotive, number 201, to Dublin by air. An Antonov An-124 was used to transport the locomotive from London, Ontario to Dublin Airport, arriving on Thursday 9 June 1994. The first light-engine test run operated from Inchicore works to Kildare on the Tuesday 14.

Unfortunately, the locomotives have had a chequered service history. The authors of &quot;Jane&#x27;s Train Recognition Guide&quot; noted that IÉ had had problems with engine fires and bogie cracks.

==Technical details==
*Main Generator Assembly: AR8PHEH/CA6
*Head End Alternator (HEP): Dayton-Phoenix, model E7145, 438 kVA, 220/380VAC, 3-phase, 50 Hz
*Standby HEP: 220 kVA from AR8, available only when stationary
*Auxiliary Generator: 5A-8147, 
*Air Compressor/Exhauster: Gardner Denver, model WLPA9B
*Multiple Working: All IÉ &amp; NIR EMD locos
*Push Pull Working: Locos 206-209 &amp; 215-234
*Curve Negotiation Capability:
**Yard:

===Equipment new to IÉ locos===
*Air Dryer
*Teloc 2200 Event Recorder
*Electrically heated windscreens
*Active noise control in both cabs
*Enclosed body style, last seen on 1950s Metro-Vic A and C Classes
*Head End Power (HEP)
**This system supplied AC power to the train for heating, battery charging, etc. and was intended to replace the Mark 2 &amp; Mark 3 Generator Vans used at the time. In the event HEP was only used on the Enterprise cross-border De Dietrich service. HEP is no longer used due to noise while the train is in station, and reliability issues running the prime mover at high speed constantly. Four Mark 3 generator vans remain in use on the Enterprise service. The later CAF-built Mark 4 sets include their own generators in the Driving Van Trailer (DVT).
*EM2000 digital traction computer
*Train (carriage) door control

**HaslerRail 2500 Event recorder

==Fleet==

===InterCity===

Today push-pull equipped members of the 201 class operate the only passenger locomotive hauled services in the Republic of Ireland between Dublin and Cork. They operate with Mark 4 carriages which were introduced to the route in 2006/2007. The current livery, which primarily consists of green and silver, was introduced in 2006. All locomotives have full yellow ends to enhance visibility.

Non push-pull locomotives were withdrawn from service because Mark 4 carriages operate a push-pull system and rolling stock on other InterCity routes was replaced by 22000 Class DMUs. The only other locomotive-hauled service (also push-pull) is the Enterprise cross-border service to Belfast which is detailed below.

===Enterprise===

The Enterprise is a cross-border passenger service between Dublin and Belfast operated by Iarnród Éireann and Northern Ireland Railways. This is also a locomotive-hauled service and operates a similar push-pull system like services to Cork. As this is a jointly operated service, it is marketed as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the coaching stock and locomotives carry a separate livery to either operator&#x27;s own services. It consists of light grey with a purple and red strip. Locomotives also have full yellow ends to enhance visibility.

As the service is shared, locomotives (8)208 and (8)209 are owned by Northern Ireland Railways. The coaching stock is owned by operators, Iarnród Éireann own the odd numbered coaches and NIR own the even numbered coaches.

In addition, Iarnród Éireann introduced four former Mark 3 generator vans, in September 2012, to operate this route, in a bid to improve reliability of the service and reduce maintenance costs. Previously, the service operated with head end power and this caused regular locomotive failures, increased wear and tear and also contributed to locomotive 230 being removed from service in June 2013 after an engine fire, while operating a passenger service with HEP in operation.

===Freight===

201 Class locomotives also operate some freight services as required. There is a container flow between Dublin Port and Ballina.

Since 2016, some 201 Class locomotives have operated increased freight services, as the weight and length of some freight services was increased, due to customer demand. There was no increase in either?

===Common livery===
Locomotives 231 and 233 are painted in a common livery, which consists of light grey with a black stripe. The reason for this is that they are assigned for Enterprise duties and as part of the refurbishment of the Enterprise service, in 2015-2016, only six were given the full livery. Prior to this, some of those given the current livery had previously had the InterCity livery. As part of Iarnród Éireann&#x27;s logo change, all InterCity 201&#x27;s carry the new Iarnród Éireann logo, which includes the Irish flag, and for operational and safety reasons they do not operate cross border services, so a common colour scheme was adopted. After the cancellation of the Belmond Grand Hibernian in Ireland, locomotive 216 has been used on both Enterprise and Intercity services, it remains in the blue livery of the Belmond Grand Hibernian as of April 2024.

===List of locomotives and names===
The entire class is named after Irish rivers, with the IÉ locomotives carrying two nameplates, one in Irish and one in English, on each side of the locomotive. As 208 and 209 are owned by Northern Ireland Railways, they carry English language only nameplates. The nameplates are trapezium shaped, with the names in upper case. Some of the class have had long periods out of service, some of these are outlined below.





==Current operations==
All of the non push-pull capable locomotives (201–205 and 210–214) were placed in storage at Inchicore during 2009, the last being 214 in July 2009. This was due to the withdrawal of the Mark 3 fleet and their replacement with 22000 Class DMUs on the vast majority of passenger services. This left only the Mark 4 Dublin–Cork services and the cross-border Enterprise service (with De Dietrich rolling stock) as the only locomotive hauled passenger services operated by Iarnród Éireann.

The reduction in the number of locomotive hauled passenger workings, combined with the withdrawal of older GM locomotives, has seen 201 Class locomotives used on freight workings, whilst four push-pull capable units were transferred to join the original four dedicated locomotives in use on the Enterprise.

In 2010 Iarnród Éireann planned to store some of its remaining push-pull capable Mark 3 coaches, which could potentially have been used with 201 Class locomotives to enhance Enterprise&#x27;s service. However, most Mark 3 carriages were scrapped during 2013 and 2014.
A fleet of 10 Mark 3 coaches were sold to Belmond Grand Hibernian, while 216 and 225 were earmarked be returned to service to handle the extra traffic generated by Belmond operation. In May 2016, 216 returned to service in Belmond livery, and has operated the Grand Hibernian almost exclusively since that time.

In October 2011 233 suffered bearing failure en route to Connolly station from Belfast. It was transported by road to Inchicore Railway Works

On 15 February 2016 two 201 Class locomotives (226 &amp; 209) operated freight trials with a long train of 15 HOBS ballast wagons plus one un-powered loco, possibly assessing the loco&#x27;s capabilities for future freight services.

In October 2016 Iarnród Éireann expressed an interest in seeking solutions to re-power most of the fleet during a mid-life refurbishment. The requirement was for floor-up engine and control gear solutions, which kept the existing cab controls and compatibility with the existing GM fleet and push/pull equipment. The body, cab controls, bogies, and traction motors would remain unchanged. 201 and 205 were brought in from storage for internal and external inspection, possibly in relation to this re-powering. The re-powering project was originally scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2017, but was cancelled in early 2019.

In July 2017, 230 received some bodywork repairs after it suffered significant damage, due to a fire in the HEP system in 2013. The loco has been in storage since.

It is worth noting that they cannot operate on the Larne line due to weight clearance.

==Model==
In the late 1990s, Model Irish Railways produced a resin bodyshell kit with nameplates, numbering, brass grills and the standard yellow / black livery line transfers. Marks Models also released a resin kit for these locomotives in 00 gauge in c.2000.

In 2001, Murphy Models commissioned LIMA to produce an &#x27;00&#x27; gauge 201 model loco. They were produced in IÉ orange (201, 216, 217, 219, 230) and Enterprise (206, 207, 208, 209) liveries, in batches of 300 (except 500 of #207).

In 2011 Murphy Models launched a completely new version of the 201, with all wheel drive, centre can motor and preinstalled speaker. This was released in IÉ orange (original and revised), Green Intercity and NIR blue as well as NIR Enterprise original and revised.

Railtec Transfers and Studio Scale Models make transfers for the full range of 201 liveries, No&#x27;s 201-234, original and updated Orange, original and updated Enterprise and Green Intercity.

The 201 Class has also been released in virtual form as a player driveable locomotive in the Microsoft Train Simulator add-on, &quot;Irish Enterprise North&quot;, by Making Tracks, and for OpenBVE by Celtic Trainsim.

<doc id="1259066" wikidata="Q814300" url="?curid=1259066" title="Redpoint (climbing)">
<text>In rock climbing, a redpoint is the free-climb of a climbing route by lead climbing. The lead climber cannot use any artificial aid — including their climbing protection — to hold their weight during the climb. If they fall, they cannot place any of their weight on the rope, and hangdogging is not allowed. The lead climber can have attempted or practised the route many times beforehand, such as by headpointing or by top roping. 

Climbers will try to redpoint a route after having failed to onsight the route, which means to free-climb a route on the first attempt with no falls and no prior beta, or to flash the route, which means to free-climb the route on the first attempt with no falls but with prior beta. The first successful redpoint of a climbing route, in the absence of any prior onsight or flash, is recorded as the first free ascent (FFA) of that route.

==Description==

When a climber attempts to redpoint a climbing route, it doesn&#x27;t matter how many times that they have previously failed on the route, and/or whether they have practised any or all of the individual movements on the route, and/or whether they conducted any prior inspections of the route to learn its beta (e.g. by abseil). 

If the climber falls during an attempted redpoint ascent, and thus ends up in a position of hanging from their rope (i.e. their bodyweight is being held — even partly — by the rope), then they must return to the bottom of the climbing route, pull their rope free of the route (i.e. free it from any climbing protection), and completely re-start their ascent from scratch. The process of pulling the rope free before re-starting is also known as &quot;climbing a route clean&quot;, but it should not be confused with the broader topic of clean climbing. 

Climbers can pause and rest during a redpoint ascent but they cannot use the rope, or any other artificial aids, to hold their bodyweight while they rest — completely unaided techniques such as the kneebar and the bat hang are allowed. The term hangdogging is where the climber rests on the rope after falling but then restarts climbing without returning to the ground, which is not a redpoint. The first climber to redpoint a route, in the absence of any prior onsight or flash of a route, has made the first free ascent (FFA) of that route.

Where quickdraws are pre-placed into the fixed protection bolts on sport climbing routes, so that climber is just clipping the rope into the quickdraws as they ascend, it is called a &quot;pinkpoint&quot; — in practice, most ascents of extreme sport climbing routes are done as pinkpoints, as are ascents in modern competition climbing, so the term &quot;pinkpoint&quot; is no longer used in these instances. However, due to additional significant challenge of placing climbing protection while ascending traditional climbing routes, traditional climbers continue to differentiate on whether their first free ascent was a pinkpoint (e.g. as Swiss traditional climber Didier Berthod did on making the first ascent of &quot;The Crack of Destiny&quot; in 2023) or a full redpoint.

===Comparisons===

The unlimited practicing that is allowed before making a redpoint ascent contrasts with the historical aversion to &quot;headpointing&quot; (i.e. practicing the route on a toprope beforehand) in traditional climbing. In the early 1980s, redpointing was therefore a term largely exclusive to sport climbing. While headpointing was then considered a &quot;lesser form&quot; of first free ascent in traditional climbing (and an FFA that was headpointed would be asterisked as such), leading traditional climbers eventually followed the redpointing practices of the sport climbers, and by the 2000s, had largely dispensed with the stigma associated with headpointing.

From about the 2010s, traditional climbers were using the derived term &quot;greenpoint&quot; (or the &quot;Grünpunkt&quot;, as a play on the &quot;Rotpunkt&quot;), to describe climbing a pre-bolted sport-climb, but only using &quot;traditional protection&quot; (i.e. climbing protection that is not permanently fixed via pre-placed bolts or pitons); as with redpointing, the climber may have repeatedly practiced falling on the “traditional protection” before making their greenpoint ascent. Notable examples include Austrian climber &#x27;s greenpoint of &quot;Prinzip Hoffnung&quot; (5.14a R, 2009) in Bürs in Austria, and Canadian Sonnie Trotter&#x27;s greenpoint of &quot;The Path&quot; (5.14a R, 2007) in Lake Louise, Alberta, and of &quot;East Face&quot; (Monkey Face) (5.13d R, 2004) at Smith Rocks.

===Projecting===

Repeatedly attempting a redpoint can take place over any length of time, from hours to years (i.e. any time, once the initial onsight or flash has failed). Climbers use the term projecting to denote a longer-term &quot;project&quot; to complete the FFA, or their own personal first ascent, of a route that is at the limit of their abilities. The redpoint FFA of many of contemporary sport climbing routes, particularly those that involved breaking new grade milestones, took years, and even decades, to project (e.g. &quot;Realization&quot;, &quot;La Dura Dura&quot;, and &quot;Jumbo Love&quot;).

Bouldering climbers also use the terms &quot;onsight&quot; and &quot;flash&quot; in relation to ascents of boulder problems, they mostly use the term &quot;projecting&quot; — instead of the term &quot;redpointing&quot; — when discussing longer-term attempts of FFAs or personal first ascents.

==Etymology==

The English term &quot;redpoint&quot; is a loan translation of the German &quot;Rotpunkt&quot; that was coined by Kurt Albert in the mid-1970s at Frankenjura. Albert would paint a red &quot;X&quot; on any fixed metal pitons on a rock climbing route so that he could avoid using them while climbing, thus not using any artificial aid. Once Albert was able to free-climb the entire route, and avoid all the red &quot;X&quot;s, he would then paint a red &quot;dot&quot; (the &quot;Roter Punkt&quot;) at the base of the route. His first &quot;Rotpunkt&quot; was the aid climbing route &quot; Adolf-Rott-Gedächtnis-Weg&quot; (V+/A1) at the Streitberger Schild crag in the Frankenjura, which he freed at in 1975. Albert got the idea for the &quot;red dot&quot; from the logo and name of a brand of German coffee and kettle maker. To achieve a &quot;Rotpunkt&quot;, Albert additionally defined that if a climber fell during the ascent, they had to return to the base, pull the rope free, and re-start the climb from scratch (i.e. as if the climber had only just approached it).

The connotation spread of a &quot;redpoint&quot; being a route that had to be repeatedly attempted because it was so hard – which is why metal pitons had been hammered into the rock as an aid in the first place – until it could be climbed in one clean push (i.e. no falls, and any falls required a full re-start), and without any artificial aids. Because these routes were already established aid climbing routes, Albert could not remove the pitons (that would happen in later decades), however, his &quot;Rotpunkt&quot; laid down a mark to other climbers that the route could be free climbed without the use of the metal aids, and thus became an important moment in the development of free climbing. Eventually, Albert&#x27;s &quot;Rotpunkte&quot; became associated with the development of sport climbing in the 1980s, as many of these aids were on routes that had no possibility of even natural traditional climbing protection (e.g. no cracks), and thus bolts would be needed for protection (but not aid).

== Notable redpoints==
Notable redpointed climbs are chronicled by the climbing media to track progress in rock climbing standards and levels of technical difficulty; in contrast, the hardest traditional climbing routes tend to be of lower technical difficulty due to the additional burden of having to place protection during the course of the climb, and due to the lack of any possibility of using natural protection on extreme sport climbs.

As of May 2024, the world&#x27;s hardest redpointed routes are &quot;Silence&quot; by Adam Ondra, &quot;&quot; by Seb Bouin, and &quot;B.I.G.&quot; by Jakob Schubert, which are all at a proposed grade of , and none of which have been repeated. As of May 2024, four female climbers Angela Eiter, Laura Rogora, Julia Chanourdie, and Anak Verhoeven have redpointed established routes at the grade of .

<text>Seongjong (15 January 961 – 29 November 997), personal name Wang Ch&#x27;i, was the sixth king of the Goryeo dynasty of Korea.

==Reign==

Seongjong was born on 15 January 961, the second son of Daejong, and a grandson of King Taejo (the founder of the Goryeo Dynasty). He ascended the throne after his cousin and also his brother-in-law King Gyeongjong died in 981.
After he ascended the throne, Seongjong was at first content not to interfere with the provincial lords, and to appease the artistocrats from the former state of Silla, Seongjong married a woman of the Silla royal clan. 
In 982, Seongjong adopted the suggestions in a memorial written by Confucian scholar Ch&#x27;oe Sŭng-no and began to create a Confucian-style government. Ch&#x27;oe Sung-no suggested that Seongjong would be able to complete the reforms of King Gwangjong, the fourth King of Goryeo, which he had inherited from Taejo of Goryeo. Taejo had emphasized the Confucian &quot;Classic of History&quot;, which stated that the ideal Emperor should understand the suffering of farmers and directly experience their toil. Seongjong followed this principle and established a policy by which district officials were appointed by the central government, and all privately owned weapons were collected to be recast into agricultural tools.
Seongjong set out to establish the Goryeo state as a centralized Confucian monarchy. In 983, he established the system of twelve mok, the administrative divisions which prevailed for most of the rest of the Goryeo period, and sent learned men to each of the mok to oversee local education, as a means of integrating the country aristocracy into the new bureaucratic system. Talented sons of the country aristocrats were educated so that they could pass the civil service examinations and be appointed to official government posts in the capital.
In September, 995 (the 14th year of Seongjong&#x27;s reign), the nation was divided into ten provinces for the first time, which formed the basis for the modern day Provinces of Korea.

==The First Goryeo-Khitan War==

In late August 993, Goryeo intelligence sources along the frontier learned of an impending Khitan invasion. Seongjong quickly mobilized the military and divided his forces into three army groups to take up defensive positions in the northwest. Advanced units of the Goryeo army marched northwestward from their headquarters near modern Anju on the south bank of the Cheongcheon River. The seriousness of the situation compelled Seongjong to travel from the capital to Pyongyang to personally direct operations.
That October, a massive Khitan army said to number nearly 800,000 men (in fact 60,000 men) under the command of General Xiao Sunning swarmed out of Liao from the Naewon-song Fortress and surged across the Yalu River into Goryeo. Waves of Khitan warriors swept across the river and fanned out over the countryside.
In bloody back-and-forth warfare, the fierce resistance of Goryeo soldiers at first slowed, then considerably hampered the Khitan advance at the city of Pongsan-gun. But Goryeo&#x27;s army never surrendered. It stood firm against frontal attacks, broke to retreat and lay ambushes, and launched flanking attacks against the Khitan. Goryeo warriors finally halted Xiao Sunning&#x27;s army at the Cheongcheon River. In the face of such quick and determined resistance, the Khitan decided that further attempts to conquer the entire peninsula would be far too costly, and sought instead to negotiate a settlement with Goryeo.

Without a hint of contrition or humility, the Khitan General Xiao Sunning demanded the surrender of the former territory of Balhae to Emperor Shengzong. He asked that Goryeo sever its relations with Song dynasty and, in the boldest demand of all, that Seongjong accept vassal status under the Liao emperor and pay a set annual tribute to the Liao state. Instead of and rejecting General Xiao&#x27;s demands outright, the royal court at Kaesong began a heated debate about the Khitan ultimatum. Government officials believed that acceding to General Xiao would prevent further Khitan incursions and urged the court to appease the Liao emperor. Many of the senior military commanders who had recently faced the Khitan army on the battlefield opposed accepting General Xiao&#x27;s terms, including Official Sŏ Hŭi, commander of an army group north of Anju. While the bureaucrats argued in Kaesong, General Xiao launched a sudden attack across the Cheongcheon River, directly on the Goryeo army headquarters in Anju. The Khitan assault was quickly repulsed, but it agitated the royal court to a state of near panic.
In an effort to calm the court nobility, minister Sŏ Hŭi volunteered to negotiate directly with General Xiao. Both parties knew that a key factor influencing the negotiations was the heavy pressure being exerted on the Liao state by Song dynasty. In face-to-face talks with his Khitan counterpart, minister Seo bluntly told General Xiao that the Khitan had no basis for claims to former Balhae territory. Since the Goryeo dynasty was, without question, successor to the former Goguryeo kingdom, that land rightfully belonged under Goryeo&#x27;s domain. In a cleverly veiled threat, Sŏ Hŭi reminded General Xiao that the Liaodong Peninsula had also once been under the dominion of Goguryeo and that the Manchurian territories, including the Khitan capital at Liaoyang, should properly belong to Goryeo. In a remarkable conclusion, minister So obtained Khitan consent to allow the region up to the Yalu River to be incorporated into Goryeo territory. General Xiao and the Khitan army not only returned to Liao without having achieved their goals, but the invasion ended with the Khitan giving up territory along the southern Yalu River to Seongjong. Sŏ Hŭi&#x27;s brilliant diplomatic maneuver underscored his correct understanding of both the contemporary international situation and Goryeo&#x27;s position in the region.

The Khitan withdrew and ceded territory to the east of the Yalu River when Goryeo agreed to end its alliance with Song Dynasty. However, Goryeo continued to communicate with Song, having strengthened its position by building fortress in the newly gained northern territories.
The Goryeo-Khitan Wars continued with the second and third campaigns until 1018.

==Death==
He died of disease in November 997 and was succeeded by his nephew, Mokjong.

<doc id="1259080" wikidata="Q6954365" url="?curid=1259080" title="NIR 1 Class">
<text>The Northern Ireland Railways DH class was a class of three diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotives obtained in 1969. All three have now been withdrawn, and two have since been rebuilt for work in Sri Lanka.

==Early service life==
The DH class of Northern Ireland Railways consisted of three diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotives numbered 1, 2 &amp; 3. They were built by the English Electric Company at their Vulcan Foundry works in Newton-le-Willows in 1969. The works numbers 3954–3956 in the EE list, and D1266–D1268 in the VF list. They were of 0-6-0 wheel arrangement and fitted with Dorman 12QTV engines of , connected to an EE Twin Disc torque converter and a Wiseman final drive. They weighed and had a maximum speed of . They are often referred to with their, &quot;DH,&quot; prefix.

The locomotives were of EE&#x27;s standard &#x27;Stephenson&#x27; class, and were obtained primarily for shunting work, trip freights and engineer&#x27;s trains. Locomotive No. 1 was the first to enter service on 31 July 1969, with No. 2 following on 27 September and No. 3 on 4 October. However, the locomotives were not particularly successful due to problems with the engines overheating regularly while in service.

==Withdrawal from service and initial preservation==
All three were put into store during the late 1980s, the first in 1986 and the last two in May 1989. The Irish Traction group had approached NIR in August 1989 hoping to run a farewell excursion with No. 2 in September 1989, but this plan failed after No. 2 suffered a catastrophic engine failure on Saturday 9 September 1989 (the day before the excursion), despite having been overhauled by NIR at York Road Works. Both Nos. 2 and 3 ended up in secure storage at Larne Harbour, where the Diesel engines, torque converters and final drives were removed in 1991.

It was originally intended to put the locomotives on display at Lisburn, Belfast Central, and Londonderry to celebrate the 150th anniversary of railways in Northern Ireland, and in mid-1989, locomotive No. 1 had its engine, torque converter and final drive removed at York Road works before being repainted in NIR red and moved to the Lisburn Engineer&#x27;s yard; unfortunately, difficulties in placing the engine meant it was shunted to the back of the yard.

==Preservation==
In September 1994, the Irish Traction Group purchased the three locomotives from NIR and moved them south to their restoration base at Carrick-on-Suir. Although Nos 2 and 3 were moved to Lisburn on Sunday 11 September 1994 to be reunited with No. 1, paperwork issues with Iarnród Éireann regarding the transport of the engines from Lisburn to Carrick-on-Suir meant that the locomotives did not move until Monday 7 January 1995 to Inchicore Works at Dublin, where they spent a week parked outside the running shed at Dublin Heuston. The move was completed on 14 January when the locomotives were towed from Dublin to Carrick-on-Suir.

When they moved to Carrick-on-Suir by rail, they formed the last recorded un-braked train in Ireland and were regarded as an &quot;Engineers Special&quot;. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the ITG to prevent the locomotives from being vandalised while at Carrick-on-Suir, they were repeatedly attacked during their ten years of outside storage. This has prompted the ITG in recent times to construct large metal covers to protect any engines stored out of doors at Carrick-on-Suir, both from vandals and deterioration caused by the Irish weather.

During this period, it became clear that the ITG could not restore even one of the locomotives to running condition. The major cost was to replace the engine, torque converter and final drive, with prices in the area of £70,000 sterling to replace these components. Several engineering companies also queried whether the locomotives would be made available for sale, though the cost of replacing the engines and related drive components meant that these inquiries did not amount to much more than that. Since, two have been rebuilt for work in Sri Lanka; one is in storage in Wales.

==Return to Service==
In 2005, the ITG was approached by Beaver Power Ltd, who wanted to buy the three locomotives for re-use in Sri Lanka. After much deliberation, the ITG sold Nos. 2 and 3 to Beaver for export to Sri Lanka, and moved to Merthyr Tydfil for overhaul and regauging to allow them to run on the 5 ft 6 in broad gauge tracks in Sri Lanka. Locomotive No. 1 was also sent to Merthyr Tydfil for parts recovery to enable the other two to be rebuilt to running condition. At the time, No. 1 was still owned by the ITG, and was not offered for sale until five years later.

In May 2006, Nos. 2 and 3 departed for Sri Lanka to work at a Holcim cement plant in the Puttalam area. The work included regauging to 5 ft 6 in (1676 mm), fitting of a Rolls-Royce CV12 750 hp Diesel engine coupled to a Twin Disc 13800 MS230 torque converter (both engines had lost their Diesel engines, torque converter and final drives in 1991), and repainting in Holcim livery.

In November 2010, the decision was made by the ITG to sell the stripped remains of No. 1 to Beaver, the sale being concluded on 28 November. This locomotive had lost its engine, torque converter and final drive in 1989, and was heavily stripped due to its use by Beaver as a spare parts unit. It is understood that the locomotive will be rebuilt for industrial service, whether in the UK or overseas.

It is understood that, as of 2010, locomotive No. 3 has been withdrawn and heavily stripped for parts. The locomotive still carries the white Holcim livery that it was painted in when first exported to Sri Lanka, while No. 2 was repainted into a blue and white livery: it is still in service. No. 2 has been named, &quot;Shakhti&quot;, and No. 3, &quot;Prince Vijaya&quot; - nameplates adorn the cabsides of each locomotive. No. 2 has received a further repaint and now sports a red and white livery with yellow band.

Fort Dayton is named for Colonel Elias Dayton, who led the construction effort in 1776. It was one of several forts constructed in the Mohawk Valley. 

When the American Revolutionary War started, the fort was described as &quot;little better than a dilapidated block-house&quot;. It was rebuilt under the supervision of Colonel Elias Dayton of the 3rd New Jersey Regiment on the orders of General Philip Schuyler in the autumn of 1776. It was a wooden and earthen fortress which enclosed the stone church and other buildings located on the highest ground in the village, once known as &quot;Stone Ridge&quot;. There also was a blockhouse constructed on the hill overlooking Fort Dayton.

On August 4, 1777, General Nicholas Herkimer assembled about 900 troops of the Tryon County militia at Fort Dayton for their march to support Colonel Peter Gansevoort at Fort Stanwix, which was under siege by Barry St. Leger&#x27;s British and Indian forces. Herkimer&#x27;s troops, consisting mainly of Palatine German settlers, followed the north shore of the Mohawk River, and camped the first night west of Sterling (Staring) Creek. On August 6, Herkimer&#x27;s troops were ambushed in a small ravine by St. Leger&#x27;s British, Tory, and Indian forces. General Herkimer himself was wounded, but continued to lead his men in what became known as the Battle of Oriskany. General Herkimer died from his wounds on August 17, at his home near the present day Town of Danube.

On February 18, 1779 Henry William Dwight wrote to his brother that &#x27;the people here are scandalously neglected, both with regard to troops and provisions.&#x27; He complained of &#x27;no flour and little beef&#x27;. (Sedgwick Papers)

Fort Dayton was attacked multiple times including the Attack on German Flatts (1778). Fort Dayton was also a base for soldiers aiding Johann Christian Schell after his stand at Schell&#x27;s Bush and for pursuing Tory leader Walter Butler and his troops. After the destruction of Fort Stanwix in 1781 it was the westernmost fort in the Mohawk valley, and was besieged by Mohawk leader Joseph Brant in 1782.

==After the war==
In July 1783 General George Washington toured Fort Dayton, when he was visiting the Mohawk Valley on an inspection tour. The fort was eventually abandoned, and was razed in 1832 to make way for the Erie Canal. A memorial marker of the site of Fort Dayton can be found at the Historic Four Corners intersection on North Main Street in Herkimer.

The 1778 attack and the 1782 siege are represented in the historical novel &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; and the &#x27;based upon the book&#x27; movie of 1939.

==Archaeology==
In 2015, the Herkimer County Historical Society (New York State) sponsored a search for the exact location of Fort Dayton. One archaeological excavation in the town of Herkimer revealed pipes and a well, although the investigators believe that none of these artifacts predate the mid-nineteenth century.

<text>Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve is a United States National Marine Sanctuary on Lake Huron&#x27;s Thunder Bay, within the northeastern region of the U.S. state of Michigan. It protects an estimated 116 historically significant shipwrecks ranging from nineteenth-century wooden side-wheeler paddle steamers to twentieth-century steel-hulled steamers. There are a great many wrecks in the sanctuary, and their preservation and protection is a concern for United States Government policymakers. The landward boundary of the sanctuary extends from the western boundary of Presque Isle County to the southern boundary of Alcona County. The sanctuary extends east from the lakeshore to the international border. Alpena is the largest city in the area.

==History==

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration established Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve on June 22, 2000. It became the thirteenth national marine sanctuary overall and first on the Great Lakes. Original boundaries followed that of Alpena County to 83 degrees west longitude totaling . In 2014 it was expanded to . The marine sanctuary contains many shipwrecks, such as the hull of package freighter SS &quot;Pewabic&quot;.
==Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Center==
Tied to the sanctuary is the Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Center. The museum, located in Alpena on the Thunder Bay River, features exhibits about local shipwrecks and the Great Lakes, an auditorium, an archaeological conservation laboratory, and education areas.

== Visitation ==
Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary offers a variety of recreational activities for visitors. The sanctuary is renowned for its exceptional shipwreck diving experiences, suitable for both novice and experienced divers. Several charter services provide guided dives to the sanctuary&#x27;s shipwrecks, ensuring safe and educational experiences. Boating is another popular activity, with numerous boat launches and marinas available in the area.

<doc id="1259103" wikidata="Q1433533" url="?curid=1259103" title="Reader (liturgy)">
<text>In some Christian denominations, a reader or lector is the person responsible for reading aloud excerpts of scripture at a liturgy. In early Christian times the reader was of particular value due to the rarity of literacy.

== Catholic Church ==
In the Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church, the term &quot;lector&quot; or &quot;reader&quot;&quot; means someone who in a particular liturgy is assigned to read a Biblical text other than the Gospel (reading the Gospel at Mass is reserved specifically to the deacon or, in his absence, to the priest). But it also has the more specific meaning of a person who has been &quot;instituted&quot; as a lector or reader, and is such even when not assigned to read in a specific liturgy.

The office was formerly classed as one of the four minor orders in the Latin Church. However, since 1 January 1973, the apostolic letter &quot;Ministeria quaedam&quot; decreed instead that:
# What up to now were called minor orders are henceforth to be called &quot;ministries&quot;.
# Ministries may be assigned to lay Christians; hence they are no longer to be considered as reserved to candidates for the sacrament of orders.
# Two ministries, adapted to present-day needs, are to be preserved in the whole Latin Church, namely, those of reader and acolyte. The functions heretofore assigned to the subdeacon are entrusted to the reader and the acolyte.
# The reader is appointed for a function proper to him, that of reading the word of God in the liturgical assembly. Accordingly, he is to proclaim the readings from sacred Scripture, except for the gospel in the Mass and other sacred celebrations; he is to recite the psalm between the readings when there is no psalmist; he is to present the intentions for the general intercessions in the absence of a deacon or cantor; he is to direct the singing and the participation by the faithful; he is to instruct the faithful for the worthy reception of the sacraments. He may also, insofar as may be necessary, take care of preparing other faithful who are appointed on a temporary basis to read the Scriptures in liturgical celebrations. That he may more fittingly and perfectly fulfill these functions, he is to meditate assiduously on sacred Scripture.
:Aware of the office he has undertaken, the reader is to make every effort and employ suitable means to acquire that increasingly warm and living love and knowledge of Scripture that will make him a more perfect disciple of the Lord.

Canon 1035 of the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; requires candidates for diaconal ordination to have received and have exercised for an appropriate time the ministries of lector and acolyte and prescribes that institution in the second of these ministries must precede by at least six months ordination as a deacon.

Instituted lectors, either men or women (since the 2021 motu proprio &quot;spiritus domini&quot;), are obliged, when proclaiming the readings at Mass, to wear an alb or an &quot;other suitable attire that has been legitimately approved by the Conference of Bishops&quot;. such as cassock and surplice. Others who perform the function of lector, &quot;may go to the ambo in ordinary attire, but this should be in keeping with the customs of the different regions.&quot;

The &quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot; speaks as follows of those who, without being lectors in the specific sense, carry out their functions at Mass: &quot;In the absence of an instituted lector, other lay people may be deputed to proclaim the readings from Sacred Scripture, people who are truly suited to carrying out this function and carefully prepared, so that by their hearing the readings from the sacred texts the faithful may conceive in their hearts a sweet and living affection for Sacred Scripture.&quot;

In its sections the same document lists the lector&#x27;s specific duties at Mass.

Traditionalist Catholic organizations such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest and the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney are authorized to use the pre-1973 rite for their members who receive the office of lector.

== Eastern liturgical rites ==

In the Eastern Orthodox Church and in the Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine tradition, the reader (in Greek, &quot;Anagnostis&quot;; in Church Slavonic, чтец &quot;chtets&quot;) is the second highest of the minor orders of clergy. This order is higher than the doorkeeper (now largely obsolete) and lower than the subdeacon.

Immediately before ordination as a reader, the candidate is tonsured as a sign of his submission and obedience upon entry into the clerical state. It is a separate act from ordination. The tonsure is performed only once, immediately prior to the actual ordination of a reader, which the ordination rite refers to as &quot;the first degree of priesthood&quot;. However, it is not the means whereby a person becomes a reader. Readers, like subdeacons, are ordained by &quot;Cheirothesia&quot; - literally, &quot;to place hands&quot; - whereas &quot;Cheirotonia&quot; - &quot;to stretch out the hands&quot; - is practised at the ordination of the higher clergy: bishops, priests and deacons.
After being tonsured, the reader is vested in a short phelon, which he wears while reading the Epistle for the first time. This short phelon is then removed (and never worn thereafter) and replaced with a stikhar, which the reader wears thereafter whenever he performs his liturgical duties. This practice is not universal, however, and many bishops and priests will allow a reader to perform his function dressed only in a cassock or (if a monk) a riassa. Sometimes, a bishop will decree what vesting practice he wishes to be followed within his own diocese.

Byzantine icons often show readers and church singers wearing a stikhar-like garment (more loose and flowing than the modern stikhar) and a pointed hat with the brim pulled out to the sides.

In Eastern Thrace, during the Ottoman period and prior to the tragedy of 1922, some lay people were selected through symbolic tonsure and Cheirothesia to receive the ecclesiastical blessing and rank of .

==Anglicanism==
Minor orders were discontinued in the reformed Church of England. The modern office of reader was introduced in 1866 and is distinct from the traditional minor order of reader. It is the office of a licensed lay minister and, for this reason, a person holding the office is referred to as a &quot;lay reader&quot; in many parts of the Anglican Communion. After a period of theological training (often, in the case of the Church of England, three years of evening classes), a lay person is licensed to preach and lead public worship. A reader is not a member of the clergy and cannot preside at the Eucharist, officiate at marriages, absolve or bless.

A reader is licensed to lead non-sacramental worship (including, in some cases, funerals), may assist in the leadership of eucharistic worship and may preach. Anglican readers in some countries often wear a blue tippet with choir dress.

==Methodism==

In the United Methodist Church in the United States, similar to the Anglican office, a certified lay minister is a servant, who is called and equipped to conduct public worship, care for the congregation, assist in program leadership, develop new and existing faith communities, preach the Word, lead small groups, or establish community outreach ministries as part of a ministry team with the supervision and support of an ordained minister.

The role of certified lay minister is intended for missional leadership in churches or other ministry settings as part of a team ministry under the supervision of clergy, and they are &quot;assigned&quot; to a local church by the district superintendent, unlike clergy who are &quot;appointed&quot; by a bishop.

<text>True lemurs, also known as brown lemurs, are the lemurs in genus Eulemur. They are medium-sized primates that live exclusively on Madagascar.

The fur of the true lemurs is long and usually reddish brown. Often, sexual dimorphism in coloration (sexual dichromatism) is seen, such as in the black lemur. True lemurs are from in length, with a tail that is as long or significantly longer than the body. They weigh from .

True lemurs are predominantly diurnal forest inhabitants, with some species preferring rain forests, while others live in dry forests. They are skillful climbers and can cross large distances in trees by jumping, using their nonprehensile tails to aid in balancing. When on the ground, they move almost exclusively on all four legs. True lemurs are social animals and live together in groups of two to 15 members.

The diet of the true lemurs is almost exclusively herbivorous – flowers, fruits and leaves. In captivity, they have been shown to also eat insects.

Gestation is 125 days. During the summer or early fall (shortly before the beginning of the rainy season), the females birth their young, usually two offspring. The young clasp firmly to the fur of their mother, then ride on her back when they are older. After about five months, they are weaned, and they are fully mature around 18 months of age. The life expectancy of the true lemurs can be up to 18 years, but this can be longer in captivity.

<text>Ardbeg distillery (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Taigh-staile na h-Àirde Bige&quot;) is an Islay single malt Scotch whisky distillery in Ardbeg on the South coast of the isle of Islay, Argyll and Bute, Scotland, in the Inner Hebrides group of islands. 

The distillery is owned by Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, and produces a heavily peated Islay whisky. The distillery uses malted barley sourced from the maltings in Port Ellen.

The name &quot;Ardbeg&quot; is an anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic &quot;An Àird Bheag&quot;, meaning &quot;The Small Promontory&quot;.

==History==
The Ardbeg distillery has been producing whisky since 1798, and began commercial production in 1815. Like most Scottish distilleries, for most of its history its whisky was produced for use in blended whisky, rather than as a single malt. By 1886 the distillery was producing 300,000 gallons of whisky per year, and employed 60 workers.

Hiram Walker took full control of Ardbeg distillery in 1979. Production was halted in 1981, but resumed on a limited basis in 1989 and continued at a low level until late 1996. 

In 1997, the distillery was bought and reopened by Glenmorangie plc (which was subsequently acquired by the French company LVMH on 28 December 2004). Production resumed 25 June 1997, and full production resumed in 1998. The distillery was reopened by Ed Dodson in 1997 and handed over to Stuart Thomson, who managed it from 1997 to 2006. Michael &quot;Mickey&quot; Heads, an Islay native and former manager at Jura who had worked at Ardbeg years earlier, took over on 12 March 2007. Colin Gordon has followed in his footsteps in August 2020.

In July 2022, the distillery sold a 1975 cask to a private collector for £16 million, beating Macallan&#x27;s record for the highest cask selling price.

==Production==
The distillery output is quite large for a distillery with only two pot stills. The wash still has a capacity of about 18,000 litres, and the spirit still a capacity of about 17,000 litres. This produces approximately 10,000 barrels (1.4 million liters) of spirit per year. The distillery employs about sixty people and also provides them with accommodation on site. Since 2018, a new still house is under construction, which will double Ardbeg&#x27;s distilling capacity.

In 2011, 20 vials of Ardbeg spirit and wood particles were sent to the International Space Station to investigate their interaction. They returned on 12 September 2014.

==Products==

The whiskies of Ardbeg are mostly heavily peated malts. Compared to other Islay malts, Ardbeg does not focus on the sea and salt tastes, but rather on aromas of spices, malt or sweet tones like vanilla and chocolate. The core range of Ardbeg consists of the Ardbeg TEN, Wee Beastie, An Oa, Uigeadail and Corryvreckan. The TEN is named after its age. Uigeadail was named after Loch Uigeadail, a loch in the hills about 4 km north of Ardbeg which is a source of water for the distillery. The Corryvreckan bottle takes its name from a famous sea vortex between the Isle of Jura and the Isle of Scarba. In June 2024, the distillery released a new edition of the Corryvreckan from 2008. The special bottling was created in collaboration with the comic artist Tradd Moore and is limited to 250 bottles.

==Awards==
Ardbeg has won various awards at international spirit ratings competitions. For example:
*The Connor from Love on the Spectrum for the finest whisky in the world*
*Jim Murray&#x27;s &quot;Whisky Bible 2008&quot; awarded the Ten Years Old expression the title of 2008 World Whisky of the Year and Scotch Single Malt of the Year. The Ten Years Old also won a series of medals at the 2006-2012 San Francisco World Spirits Competition, winning two gold and six silver medals over that stretch.
*Jim Murray&#x27;s &quot;Whisky Bible 2009&quot; and &quot;Whisky Bible 2010&quot; awarded the Uigeadail expression the title of 2009 and 2010 World Whisky of the Year and Scotch Single Malt of the Year. The San Francisco World Spirits Competition awarded the Uigeadail two double gold, three gold, and two silver medals between 2006 and 2012.
*Ardbeg Galileo won the World&#x27;s Best Single Malt Whisky in the 2013 World Whiskies Awards.

==Cultural references==
Ardbeg inspired the Finnish composer of contemporary music, Osmo Tapio Räihälä, to write the symphonic poem &quot;Ardbeg—The Ultimate Piece For Orchestra&quot; (2003); it was recorded by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra on 28 April 2011.

The series aired for two seasons on NBC from April 1995 to May 1996 after which it was canceled due to low ratings. UPN quickly picked up &quot;In the House&quot; where it aired for an additional two seasons. UPN canceled the series in May 1998.

==Synopsis==

Marion Hill (LL Cool J) is a former professional football player. Because of his financial predicament, Marion is forced to rent out most of the rooms in his house to newly divorced single mother Jackie Warren (Debbie Allen) and her two children, Tiffany (Maia Campbell) and Austin (Jeffery Wood).

After the second season, the series was retooled, becoming more adult-oriented. Jackie and Austin both moved back East while Tiffany stayed with Marion to finish high school. Joining the cast for the third season was former &quot;Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; star Alfonso Ribeiro as Dr. Maxwell &quot;Max&quot; Stanton and &quot;In Living Color&quot; cast member Kim Wayans as Tonia Harris. Both Maxwell and Tonia helped Marion manage the Los Angeles sports clinic he owns, then Tonia leaves for the WNBA after Season 4, and Tiffany leaves after only two episodes in Season 5.

<text>Billy Lee (born William Lee Schlensker; March 12, 1929 – November 17, 1989) was an American child actor who appeared in many films from the mid-1930s through the early 1940s. He is probably best remembered for his performance in &quot;The Biscuit Eater&quot;.

Lee&#x27;s first role was in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedy short &quot;Mike Fright&quot; as a tap dancer in a sailor suit. He was signed under contract with Paramount Pictures from 1934 to 1941 and his first significant role was in &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot; when he was just four years old.

Lee continued acting throughout the 1930s, appearing in a number of movies (among others: &quot;Too Many Parents&quot;, &quot;Easy to Take&quot;, &quot;Three Cheers for Love&quot;, &quot;Silk Hat Kid&quot;, &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1937&quot;, &quot;Sons of the Legion&quot;, &quot;Say It in French&quot;, &quot;Boy Trouble&quot;, &quot;Night Work&quot;, &quot;Sudden Money&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Children&quot;, &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot;, &quot;Nevada City&quot;, &quot;Road to Happiness&quot;) and working alongside some of Hollywood&#x27;s finest, including, Donald O&#x27;Connor, Lon Chaney Jr., Roy Rogers, Charles Boyer, Randolph Scott, Lew Ayres, Gene Autry, Robert Cummings, Basil Rathbone, Olivia de Havilland, John Boles, Fred MacMurray, Ray Milland and Broderick Crawford). He also did the voice of &quot;The Boy&quot; character in the animated portion of the Disney film, &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;.

In addition to being an actor, he was also a singer and dancer, appearing and singing with Bobby Breen in &quot;Make a Wish&quot; and touring with vaudeville shows. For his role in &quot;Cocoanut Grove&quot; he learnt to play the drums and formed the Billy Lee Band. The band appeared in the 1941 film, &quot;Reg&#x27;lar Fellers&quot;, in which he starred with co-star Carl Switzer.

Lee retired from film in 1943 after his last film &quot;War Dogs&quot;.

Lee died on November 17, 1989, of a sudden heart attack.

<text>Frederick Charles Beiser (; born November 27, 1949) is an American philosopher who is professor emeritus of philosophy at Syracuse University. He is best-known for his work on German idealism and has also written on the German Romantics and 19th-century British philosophy. 

==Life and career==
Beiser was born on November 27, 1949, in Albert Lea, Minnesota. In 1971, Beiser received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Shimer College, a Great Books college then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois. He then studied at the Oriel College of the University of Oxford, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy, politics and economics in 1974. He subsequently studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science from 1974 to 1975. Beiser earned his Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree in philosophy at Wolfson College, Oxford, in 1980, under the direction of Charles Taylor and Isaiah Berlin. His doctoral thesis was titled &quot;The Spirit of the Phenomenology: Hegel&#x27;s Resurrection of Metaphysics in the Phänomenologie des Geistes&quot;.

After receiving his DPhil in 1980, Beiser moved to West Germany, where he was a Thyssen Research Fellow at the Free University of Berlin. He returned to the United States four years later. He joined the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s faculty in 1984, staying there until 1985. He then spent the springs of 1986 and 1987 at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and University of Colorado Boulder, respectively.

In 1988, Beiser moved again to West Germany, where he was a Humboldt Research Fellow at the Free University of Berlin. He returned to the United States in 1990 to take up a professorship at Indiana University Bloomington, where he remained until 2001. During his tenure at Indiana, he spent time teaching at Yale University. He joined Syracuse University in 2001, where he is now emeritus. He also taught at Harvard University during the spring of 2002.

He received a Guggenheim Fellowship for his research in 1994, and was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 2015.

==Philosophical work==

In 1987, Beiser released his first book, &quot;The Fate of Reason: German Philosophy from Kant to Fichte&quot; (Harvard University Press). In the book, Beiser sought to reconstruct the background of German idealism through the narration of the story of the Spinoza or Pantheism controversy. Consequently, a great many figures, whose importance was hardly recognized by the English-speaking philosophers, were given their proper due. The work won the Thomas J. Wilson Memorial Prize for best first book. He has since edited two Cambridge anthologies on Hegel, &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Hegel&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Hegel and Nineteenth-Century Philosophy&quot; (2008), and written a number of books on German philosophy and the English Enlightenment. He also edited &quot;The Early Political Writings of the German Romantics&quot; (Cambridge University Press) in 1996.

Beiser is notable amongst English-language scholars for his defense of the metaphysical aspects of German idealism (e.g. &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot;), both in their centrality to any historical understanding of German idealism, as well as their continued relevance to contemporary philosophy.

<text>Killer Bees! is an action video game written by Robert S. Harris for the Magnavox Odyssey2 and published in 1983.

==Reception==
Art Levis for &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot; said &quot;Here&#x27;s a game that has great play value, doesn&#x27;t involve the shopworn space or maze cliches, is graphically vivid and has great sound effects – yet only an eccentric handful of games players will ever know its joysticks&quot;.

<doc id="1259138" wikidata="Q961425" url="?curid=1259138" title="Nasser Hejazi">
<text>Nasser Hejazi (Persian: ناصر حجازی, &quot;nāser hejāzi&quot;; 14 December 1949 – 23 May 2011), nicknamed &quot;the legendary Iranian goalkeeper&quot;, was an Iranian football player and coach who most notably played for Esteghlal (Taj).

Considered as the best goalkeeper in the history of Iranian football and Asia, he was capped 62 times for the Iran national football team. In 2000, the Asian Football Confederation ranked him the second best Asian goalkeeper of the 20th century.

He was goalkeeper of Iran national team in the 1960s and 1970s and won the AFC Asian Cup on two occasions in 1972 and 1976, and Asian Games title once, and competed in the 1972 Munich Olympics and 1976 Montreal Olympics and 1978 FIFA World Cup.

As a manager, he won an Azadegan League in 1998 and a Bangladesh League in 1988, as well as a runner-up place in 1998–99 AFC Champions League.

==Early life==

Hejazi was born on 14 December 1949 in Piranshahr, Iran. His father, Ali Akbar had a real estate agency in Tehran and was an Iranian Azerbaijani from Tabriz. He was admitted to Allameh Tabatabai University in 1977. He was later enrolled in Nader F.C. in 1964 and played for club until 1965. After that, he signed a contract with Taj Tehran and started his career in a professional club.

==Club career==
Hejazi was the goalkeeper of the Taj Tehran and Iran during the 1970s. Hejazi first broke into the Taj side when he was only 18 years old and while a member of the now defunct Nader FC. He won the Asian Club Championship in 1970; he also won the Iranian league in 1971 as well as 1975 and was positioned second in 1974. Further on, he won the Hazfi Cup in 1977.

In summer 1977 he changed the club joining Shahbaz Tehran, trying to win the 1977–78 Takht Jamshid Cup with his famous National teammates Gholam Hossein Mazloumi, Nasrollah Abdollahi, Ebrahim Ghasempour and Hamid Majd Teymouri. So it was a tremendous surprise, that Shahbaz could only reach the 11th place. In the following year Shahbaz was leading the ranking in the season 1978/79, when in autumn 1978 – due to the political uprisings, which ended with the Iranian Revolution in February 1979 – the season was canceled.

After the 1978 FIFA World Cup, Hejazi received an offer from Manchester United. He trained and played with the club for a month, even appearing in a reserve matches against Stoke City and Bolton Wanderers Manchester United manager Dave Sexton wanted Hejazi to stay for another two or three months before officially signing a contract with him, but there was no-one at the IRFF at the time of the Iranian Revolution to arrange the extension, which led to Manchester United signing Gary Bailey instead.

Hejazi remained as Esteghlal&#x27;s main goalkeeper until 1986. There he won the Tehran Province League in 1983 and 1985 and the runners-up position in 1982.

His last station was at Bangladeshi club Mohammedan in Dhaka, where he served as player-cum-coach and won his last league title as a player in 1987. He made his only appearance in the final league game against arch-rivals Dhaka Abahnai, coming on as a substitute in the last 21 minutes for the injured Sayeed Hassan Kanan. With Mohammedan needing a victory to keep their title hopes alive, Hejazi led the team to a 3–2 win, securing a play-off match, which the club went on to win 2–0 over two legs.

==International career==

Hejazi made his debut for the Iran national team in 1969. He became the first-choice goalkeeper in time for the 1972 Asian Cup, which Iran won for a second time in a row. Later that year, he was part of the Iran squad for the Olympic Games in Munich, where Iran failed to qualify for the second round. In 1974, he shared goalkeeping duties with Bahram Mavaddat and Mansour Rashidi at the Asian Games in Tehran, but played a key role in the 1–0 victory over Israel in the final. In 1976, he was again part of the squad that won the Asian Cup, but as second-choice behind Rashidi, before returning to the starting role for the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, playing in all three matches as Iran reached the quarter-finals.

Hejazi continued as Iran&#x27;s starting goalkeeper at the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina, but Iran conceded eight goals in their three games, managing just one draw. He was then named captain for the 1980 Asian Cup in Kuwait; Iran finished top of their group and faced the host nation in the semi-finals but lost 2–1 as Kuwait went on to win the title. After the tournament, a member of Iran&#x27;s Physical Education Department implemented a policy in which athletes older than 27 years of age would no longer be allowed to compete internationally. Hejazi was effectively forced to retire from international football, despite being only 29 years old at the time of implementation.

===International caps===
==Managerial career==
Hejazi coached Bangladeshi football club Mohammedan from 1987 to 1992. During his time, Bangladeshi football was enlightened with the modern day technique of football and embraced top football coaching. At continental level, Hejazi guided Mohammedan to the Semi-Final Group round of the 1988–89 Asian Club Championship, by defeating Iranian club Persepolis 2–1. The Bangladeshi Football Federation rewarded him by making him national team coach in 1989. 

During the 1990s, Hejazi was the manager of a number of football clubs including the Mohammedan SC, the Esteghlal (former Taj) and Esteghlal Ahvaz. During his tenure with the Esteghlal, Hejazi won the Iranian League in 1998, then took the club to the final match of the Asian Champions League in 1999. They were beaten by the Júbilo Iwata in Tehran. During his years as a coach, Hejazi was the first to discover several talented Iranian football players, including Rahman Rezaei in Zobahan and Alireza Akbarpour in Machine Sazi Tabriz. In early August 2006 Hejazi announced he signed a one-year contract as head coach of Azadegan League outfit Nassaji Mazandaran. He resigned from the post on 19 January 2007. On 5 August 2007, he was appointed as head coach of Esteghlal for a second time but he was sacked by club on 8 November 2007 because of bad results after 14 matches.

==Political career==

===Presidential candidacy===
On 3 November 2004, Hejazi announced his nomination for 2005 presidential election. He was rejected by the Guardian Council of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran, arguing his lack of political career prior to the election. Later on, he became a supporter of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.

In 2009 presidential election, he supported Mir-Hossein Mousavi.

===Opposition to Ahmadinejad===
He was an opponent to the Economic reform plan of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s Government. In April 2011, he made a statement regarding the plan: &quot;I&#x27;m very sorry for our people, they have oil, petroleum and ... but some of them are poor&quot;.

It is known that after this comment, he was unofficially banned from Iranian Television Network. This was later revoked due to his popularity and the perceived side effects that could have come from this decision.

==Personal life==

Hejazi married Behnaz Shafie in 1973. They had two children: one daughter, Atoosa and one son, Attila, who both grew up to play soccer just like their father. Attila had been playing in Esteghlal B from 1997 to 2004 and Atoosa was the captain of Iran national women futsal team. Atoosa is married to an Iranian retired soccer player Saeed Ramezani who formerly played for Zob Ahan, Sepahan and Foolad in the Iran Pro League. They have a son named Amir Arsalan. He was also a part of plot within &quot;Season 3&quot; in Homeland.

==Cancer struggle and death==

Hejazi was diagnosed with aggressive lung cancer in late 2009. While trying to resume normal daily activities as a coach, his illness forced him to be hospitalised. Hejazi went into a coma on 20 May 2011 as he was watching the match between Esteghlal and Pas Hamedan soccer teams in the final week of the Iran Pro League. On 23 May 2011, after being unable to recover from a stroke, he died at 10:55 a.m. in Kasra Hospital in Tehran. His funeral was held on 25 May 2011 in Azadi Stadium in western Tehran and his body was buried in the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in southern Tehran on the same day as his final resting place. More than 20,000 people attended his funeral.

Hejazi&#x27;s popularity went beyond Iran&#x27;s borders as Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson expressed the club&#x27;s sympathy for Hejazi&#x27;s illness in April 2010. In a message, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad paid homage to Hejazi and characterised him as a renowned and good-tempered Iranian football figure who offered valuable services to national sport.

==Legacy==
Hejazi is considered by many to be the best Iranian and Asian goalkeeper of all time. Hejazi was a member of the all-conquering Iran national team of the 1960s and 1970s that won the Asian Cup a record three times in a row and represented Iran at two Summer Olympics as well as 1978 FIFA World Cup. After his death, it was proposed that a new stadium named after Hejazi would be built in Tehran. Esteghlal&#x27;s training camp was also renamed to &quot;Hejazi Training Camp&quot;.

<doc id="1259153" wikidata="Q1057712" url="?curid=1259153" title="FTPS">
<text>FTPS (also known as FTP-SSL and FTP Secure) is an extension to the commonly used File Transfer Protocol (FTP) that adds support for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and, formerly, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL, which is now prohibited by RFC7568) cryptographic protocols.

FTPS should not be confused with the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), a secure file transfer subsystem for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol with which it is not compatible. It is also different from FTP over SSH, which is the practice of tunneling FTP through an SSH connection.

==Background==
The File Transfer Protocol was drafted in 1971 for use with the scientific and research network, ARPANET. Access to the ARPANET during this time was limited to a small number of military sites and universities and a narrow community of users who could operate without data security and privacy requirements within the protocol.

As the ARPANET gave way to the NSFNET and then the Internet, a broader population potentially had access to the data as it traversed increasingly longer paths from client to server. The opportunity for unauthorized third parties to eavesdrop on data transmissions increased proportionally.

In 1994, the Internet browser company Netscape developed and released the application layer wrapper, Secure Sockets Layer. This protocol enabled applications to communicate across a network in a private and secure fashion, discouraging eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. While it could add security to any protocol that uses reliable connections, such as TCP, it was most commonly used by Netscape with HTTP to form HTTPS.

The SSL protocol was eventually applied to FTP, with a draft Request for Comments (RFC) published in late 1996. An official IANA port was registered shortly thereafter. However, the RFC was not finalized until 2005.

==Methods of invoking security==
Two separate methods were developed to invoke client security for use with FTP clients: &quot;Implicit&quot; and &quot;Explicit&quot;. While the implicit method requires that a Transport Layer Security is established from the beginning of the connection, which in turn breaks the compatibility with non-FTPS-aware clients and servers, the explicit method uses standard FTP protocol commands and replies in order to upgrade a plain text connection to an encrypted one, allowing a single control port to be used for serving both FTPS-aware and non-FTPS-aware clients.

===Implicit===
Negotiation is not supported with implicit FTPS configurations. A client is immediately expected to challenge the FTPS server with a TLS &quot;ClientHello&quot; message. If such a message is not received by the FTPS server, the server should drop the connection.

In order to maintain compatibility with existing non-FTPS-aware clients, implicit FTPS was expected to listen on the IANA well known port 990/TCP for the FTPS control channel, and port 989/TCP for the FTPS data channel. This allowed administrators to retain legacy-compatible services on the original 21/TCP FTP control channel.

Note that implicit negotiation was not defined in RFC 4217. As such, it is considered an earlier, deprecated method of negotiating TLS/SSL for FTP.

===Explicit===
In explicit mode (also known as FTPES), an FTPS client must &quot;explicitly request&quot; security from an FTPS server and then step up to a mutually agreed encryption method. If a client does not request security, the FTPS server can either allow the client to continue in insecure mode or refuse the connection.

The mechanism for negotiating authentication and security with FTP was added under RFC 2228, which included the new FTP command AUTH. While this RFC does not explicitly define any required security mechanisms, e.g. SSL or TLS, it does require the FTPS client to challenge the FTPS server with a mutually known mechanism. If the FTPS client challenges the FTPS server with an unknown security mechanism, the FTPS server will respond to the AUTH command with error code &quot;504 (not supported)&quot;. Clients may determine which mechanisms are supported by querying the FTPS server with the FEAT command, although servers are not necessarily required to be honest in disclosing what levels of security they support. Common methods of invoking FTPS security included AUTH TLS and AUTH SSL.

The explicit method is defined in RFC 4217. In the later versions of the document, FTPS compliance required that clients always negotiate using the AUTH TLS method.

==Transport Layer Security (TLS)/Secure Socket Layer (SSL)==
===General support===
FTPS includes full support for the TLS and SSL cryptographic protocols, including the use of server-side public key authentication certificates and client-side authorization certificates. It also supports compatible ciphers, including AES, RC4, RC2, Triple DES, and DES. It further supports hash functions SHA, MD5, MD4, and MD2.

===Scope of use===
In implicit mode, the entire FTPS session is encrypted. Explicit mode differs in that the client has full control over what areas of the connection are to be encrypted. Enabling and disabling of encryption for the FTPS control channel and FTPS data channel can occur at any time. The only restriction comes from the FTPS server, which has the ability to deny commands based on server encryption policy.

====Secure command channel====
The secure command channel mode can be entered through the issue of either the AUTH TLS or AUTH SSL commands. After such time, all command control between the FTPS client and server are assumed to be encrypted. It is generally advised to enter such a state prior to user authentication and authorization in order to avoid the eavesdropping of user name and password data by third parties.

====Secure data channel====
The secure data channel can be entered through the issue of the PROT command. It is &quot;not&quot; enabled by default when the AUTH TLS command is issued. After such time, all data channel communication between the FTPS client and server is assumed to be encrypted.

The FTPS client may exit the secure data channel mode at any time by issuing a CDC (clear data channel) command.

====Reasons to disable encryption====
It may not be advantageous to use data channel encryption when performing transfers under the following scenarios:
* Files being transferred are of a non-sensitive nature, making encryption unnecessary,
* Files being transferred are already encrypted at the file level or are passing over an encrypted VPN, making encryption redundant,
* Available TLS or SSL encryption modes do not meet desired level of encryption. This is common with older FTPS clients or servers that may have been limited to 40-bit SSL due to previous United States high-encryption export laws.

It may not be advantageous to use control channel encryption under the following scenarios:
* Use of FTPS when the client or server reside behind a network firewall or network address translation (NAT) device. (See Firewall Incompatibilities below.)
* Repeated use of AUTH and CCC/CDC commands by anonymous FTP clients within the same session. Such behavior can be used as a resource-based denial of service attack as the TLS/SSL session must be regenerated each time, using server processor time.

====SSL certificates====
Much like HTTPS, FTPS servers must provide a public key certificate. These certificates can be requested and created using tools such as OpenSSL.

When these certificates are signed by a trusted certificate authority, this provides assurance that the client is connected to the requested server, avoiding a man-in-the-middle attack. If the certificate is not signed by a trusted CA (a self-signed certificate), the FTPS client may generate a warning stating that the certificate is not valid. The client can choose to accept the certificate or reject the connection.

This is in contrast to the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), which does not present signed certificates, but instead relies on Out-of-band authentication of public keys.

==Firewall incompatibilities==
Because FTP uses a dynamic secondary port (for data channels), many firewalls were designed to snoop FTP protocol control messages in order to determine which secondary data connections they need to allow. However, if the FTP control connection is encrypted using TLS/SSL, the firewall cannot determine the TCP port number of a data connection negotiated between the client and FTP server. Therefore, in many firewalled networks, an FTPS deployment will fail when an unencrypted FTP deployment will work. This problem can be solved with the use of a limited range of ports for data and configuring the firewall to open these ports.

<text>Elias Dayton (May 1, 1737 – October 22, 1807) was an American merchant and military officer who served as captain and colonel of the local militia and in 1783 rose to become a brigadier general during the American Revolutionary War. Afterward, he became the Mayor of Elizabethtown, New Jersey and served in the New Jersey General Assembly. He was the father of U.S. Constitution signer Jonathan Dayton.

==Early and family life==
Dayton was born in Elizabeth, Province of New Jersey. He married Hannah Rolfe in 1757, and they had two sons, Jonathan Dayton (1760-1824), who would become the youngest signatory of the U.S. Constitution, and Elias Bayley (Boudinot) Dayton (1764-1846).

==Career==

During the French and Indian War, Dayton served first as a lieutenant and then as a captain in the New Jersey militia. During Pontiac&#x27;s War, in 1760, he served as a commander in the Detroit region. After the wars, Dayton returned to Elizabethtown, New Jersey, where he became a mechanic, merchant and colonial official.

In 1774 the First Continental Congress called on the colonies to resist Parliament&#x27;s recent tax policy by joining in an association to boycott goods imported from Britain. Dayton allied himself with the local revolutionary movement and served on Elizabethtown&#x27;s enforcement committee. When the state turned against Royal Governor William Franklin in 1775, the New Jersey&#x27;s Provincial Congress chose Dayton to lead the 3rd New Jersey Regiment. In July 1775 he and William Alexander, Lord Stirling, led militia forces which captured a British transport off Elizabethtown.

In the spring of 1776 Dayton (as colonel) and his 3rd New Jersey troops (including his young son Jonathan, who would become the regimental paymaster by August) were sent to support an invasion of Canada. However, they were diverted to New York&#x27;s Mohawk Valley where Colonel Dayton constructed fortifications to protect the colonists from Loyalist and Indian insurrections. These fortifications included Fort Dayton in what is now Herkimer, New York and Fort Schuyler (now called Fort Stanwix but was allowed to go to ruin after the French and Indian War) in what is now Rome, New York.

In 1777, Dayton set up a spy network for George Washington on Staten Island to work in parallel with an established American intelligence agent, John Mersereau.

In December 1778, New Jersey named Dayton as a delegate to the Continental Congress, but he remained with the army and did not attend the Congress. He helped suppress a mutiny of the New Jersey line in 1781, and was promoted to brigadier general in the Continental Army in 1783, and later to major general of militia. He had a prominent role in the battles of Springfield, Monmouth, Brandywine and Yorktown, and had horses shot under him at Germantown (outside Philadelphia), at Springfield, and at Crosswick&#x27;s Bridge.

Dayton helped establish The Society of the Cincinnati in the state of New Jersey as an original member, and served as the President of the New Jersey Society from its foundation until his death. He served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1791–1792 and 1794–1796, and was mayor of Elizabethtown from 1796-1805.

==Death and legacy==

He died at age 70 and was interred at the First Presbyterian Churchyard in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The city of Dayton, Ohio would be named after his son Jonathan Dayton.

<text>Camp Marlboro was a U.S. Military Camp in Sadr City, Baghdad. It was built to facilitate military and peacekeeping operations in the densely populated Shia ghetto.

Camp Marlboro was named as such because it was located on the premises of a cigarette factory, run by one of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s cousins until the US forces occupied the compound. Marlboro is an American cigarette brand.

<text>Safdar Hosseini (; born 1954) is an Iranian academic and politician, who has served in various cabinet posts. He was chairman of the National Development Fund of Iran from 2013 until 2016.

==Early life and education==

==Career==
Hosseini was the minister of labour and social affairs in the cabinet of the president Mohammad Khatami from 2001 to 2004. Then he served as the minister of economy and finance affairs in the same cabinet. He was appointed in 2004, replacing Tahmasb Mazaheri in the post. Hosseini was replaced by Davoud Danesh-Jafari on 24 August 2005 when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president.

==Personal life==

<text>Jonathan David Katz (born 1958) is an American activist, art historian, educator and writer. He is currently Associate Professor of Practice in Art History and Gender, Sexuality &amp; Women&#x27;s Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.

== Biography ==
Katz is a founding figure in queer art history, responsible for the very first queer scholarship on a number of artists beginning in the early 1990s. His scholarship spans a period from the late 20th-century to the present, with an emphasis on the US, but with serious attention to Europe, Latin America and Asia as well. He has written extensively about gender, sexuality and desire, producing some of the key theoretical work in queer studies in the visual arts. Katz has curated more queer art exhibitions than anyone else in the world.

He is also the former executive coordinator of the Larry Kramer Initiative for Lesbian and Gay Studies at Yale University. He is a former chair of the Department of Lesbian and Gay studies at the City College of San Francisco, and was the first tenured faculty in gay and lesbian studies in the United States. Katz was an associate professor in the Art History Department at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where he also taught queer studies. He received his Ph.D. from Northwestern University in 1996.

Katz is the founder of the Harvey Milk Institute, the largest queer studies institute in the world, and the Queer Caucus for Art of the College Art Association.

Katz co-founded Queer Nation San Francisco. He has made scholarly contributions to queer studies the focus of his professional career. He was the first artistic director of the National Queer Arts Festival in San Francisco and has published widely in the United States and Europe.

His forthcoming book, &quot;The Homosexualization of American Art: Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and the Collective Closet&quot;, will be published by the University of Chicago Press. An internationally recognized expert in queer postwar American art, Katz has recently published &quot;Jasper Johns&#x27; Alley Oop: On Comic Strips and Camouflage&quot; in &quot;Schwule Bildwelten im 20. Jahrhundert&quot;, edited by Thomas Roeske, and &quot;The Silent Camp: Queer Resistance and the Rise of Pop Art,&quot; in &quot;Plop! Goes the World&quot;, edited by Serge Guilbaut. In 1995, Katz was kicked out of Rauschenberg conference at the Guggenheim for mentioning Rauschenberg&#x27;s relationship with Johns.

Katz was co-curator with David C. Ward and Jenn Sichel of the exhibition &quot;Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture&quot; at the National Portrait Gallery, Washington. This was the first major museum exploration of the impact of same-sex desire in the creation of modern American portraiture. David Wojnarowicz&#x27;s video &quot;A Fire in My Belly&quot; was removed from the exhibition on November 30, 2010, causing controversy. Katz was not consulted before the work&#x27;s removal.

His recent Chicago About Face: Stonewall, Revolt and New Queer Art, at 500 works the largest queer exhibition yet mounted, was one of the rare art shows that featured a majority of artists who were neither male nor white, and was favorably reviewed on the front page art section of the New York Times.

<doc id="1259199" wikidata="Q1158817" url="?curid=1259199" title="Gilbert (lunar crater)">
<text>Gilbert is a large lunar impact crater that lies near the eastern limb of the Moon. Due to its location this feature appears foreshortened when viewed from the Earth, limiting the amount of detail that can be observed. The crater lies to the northwest of the similar-sized walled plain Kästner, to the west of the Mare Smythii.

Several satellite craters in the vicinity have since been given names by the IAU. Nearly attached to the north-northeastern rim of Gilbert are the craters Weierstrass (Gilbert N) and Van Vleck (Gilbert M), two somewhat similar formations. In the northeastern part of Gilbert&#x27;s interior floor is the small, bowl-shaped Geissler (Gilbert D).

Gilbert is a somewhat degraded walled plain, with an outer rim that has been somewhat reshaped by nearby impacts. The southern rim has almost completely disintegrated, and forms a rolling surface that flows toward the south as an extended depression. The crater pair of Weierstrass and Van Vleck have formed an indented rim along the northeast face, while the northwest rim is overlain by Gilbert S. The interior floor is relatively level with some low ridges running down the center toward the southern end.

Having a highly eroded rim, estimating the depth of Gilbert is somewhat arbitrary, but topographic data obtained during the Apollo missions allows estimation of a depth of at least 1.7 km around most of the rim.

The crater&#x27;s name was approved by the IAU in 1964.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Gilbert.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Gilbert D — &quot;See&quot; Geissler.
* Gilbert M — &quot;See&quot; Van Vleck.
* Gilbert N — &quot;See&quot; Weierstrass.
* Gilbert U — &quot;See&quot; Avery.

<doc id="1259201" wikidata="Q217765" url="?curid=1259201" title="Lighttpd">
<text>lighttpd (prescribed pronunciation: &quot;lighty&quot;) is an open-source web server optimized for speed-critical environments while remaining standards-compliant, secure and flexible. It was originally written by Jan Kneschke as a proof-of-concept of the c10k problem – how to handle 10,000 connections in parallel on one server,
but has gained worldwide popularity. Its name is a portmanteau of &quot;light&quot; and &quot;httpd&quot;.

==Premise==
The low memory footprint (compared to other web servers), small CPU load and speed optimizations make lighttpd suitable for servers that are suffering load problems, or for serving static media separately from dynamic content. lighttpd is free and open-source software and is distributed under the BSD license. It runs natively on Unix-like operating systems, with experimental support for Microsoft Windows.

==Application support==
lighttpd supports the FastCGI, SCGI and CGI interfaces to external programs, allowing web applications written in any programming language to be used with the server. As a particularly popular language, PHP performance has received special attention. Lighttpd&#x27;s FastCGI can be configured to support PHP with opcode caches (like APC) properly and efficiently. Additionally, it has received attention from its popularity within the Python, Perl, Ruby and Lua communities. Lighttpd also supports WebDNA, the resilient in-memory database system designed to build database-driven websites. It is a popular web server for the Catalyst and Ruby on Rails web frameworks. Lighttpd does not support ISAPI.

==Features==
* Load balancing, CGI, FastCGI, SCGI, HTTP proxy, Servlet AJP, WebSocket tunnel support
* codice_1 support
* Web server event mechanism performance – codice_2, codice_3, and codice_4
* Support for more efficient event notification schemes like codice_5 and codice_6
* Conditional URL rewriting (mod_rewrite)
* TLS/SSL with SNI support, via OpenSSL, GnuTLS, Mbed TLS, NSS, WolfSSL.
* Authentication against an LDAP or DBI server
* RRDtool statistics
* Rule-based downloading with possibility of a script handling only authentication
* Server Side Includes support (but not server-side CGI from SSI)
* Flexible virtual hosting
* Modules support
* Lua programming language scripts via mod_magnet 
* WebDAV support
* HTTP compression using mod_deflate (zlib, brotli, zstd)
* Light-weight (less than 1 MB)
* Single-process design with only several threads. No processes or threads started per connection.
* HTTP/2 support since lighttpd 1.4.56
* HTTP/2 WebSocket support since lighttpd 1.4.65
* TLS Encryped Client Hello (ECH) support since lighttpd 1.4.77

==Limitations==
* Versions below 1.4.40 do not officially support sending large files from CGI, FastCGI, or proxies unless X-Sendfile is used. This limitation has been removed in lighttpd 1.4.40.
* No HTTP/3 support

==Usage==
Lighttpd was used in the past by several high-traffic websites, including Bloglines, xkcd, Meebo, and YouTube. The Wikimedia Foundation also once ran Lighttpd servers.
Due to relatively small size it&#x27;s often used in embedded devices like GL.iNet and Turris Omnia.

It&#x27;s also used by git as a HTTP server daemon.

<doc id="1259206" wikidata="Q810047" url="?curid=1259206" title="Basil Wolverton">
<text>Basil Wolverton (July 9, 1909 – December 31, 1978) was an American cartoonist and illustrator known for his intricately detailed grotesques of bizarre or misshapen people. Wolverton was described as &quot;Producer of Preposterous Pictures of Peculiar People who Prowl this Perplexing Planet.&quot; His many publishers included Marvel Comics and &quot;Mad&quot; magazine.

His drawings have elicited a wide range of reactions. Cartoonist Will Elder said he found Wolverton&#x27;s technique &quot;outrageously inventive, defying every conventional standard yet upholding a very unusual sense of humor. He was a refreshing original.&quot; But Jules Feiffer stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t like his work. I think it&#x27;s ugly.&quot;

He was posthumously inducted into the comic book industry&#x27;s Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1991.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Born in Central Point, Oregon, he later moved to Vancouver, Washington, and worked as a vaudeville performer and a cartoonist and reporter for the &quot;Portland News&quot;. At age 16 he sold his first nationally published work and began pitching comic strips to newspaper syndicates. His comic strip, &quot;Marco of Mars,&quot; was accepted by the Independent Syndicate of New York in 1929 but never distributed because it was deemed too similar to &quot;Buck Rogers,&quot; which debuted that year.

&quot;Disk-Eyes the Detective&quot; and &quot;Spacehawks&quot; were published in 1938 in &quot;Circus&quot; comics. In 1940, &quot;Spacehawk&quot; (a different and improved feature) made its debut in &quot;Target Comics&quot;, published by Novelty Press. It ran for 30 episodes (262 pages) until 1942.

Other Wolverton characters include Scoop Scuttle, a newspaperman who ran as a backup feature in Lev Gleason Publications&#x27; &quot;Daredevil Comics&quot; and &quot;Silver Streak Comics&quot;; and Mystic Moot and his Magic Snoot in Fawcett Publications&#x27; &quot;Comic Comics&quot; and &quot;Ibis The Invincible&quot;. &quot;Bingbang Buster and his Horse Hedy&quot; was a three-page backup story in Lev Gleason&#x27;s &quot;Black Diamond Western&quot; #16–28 (1950–1952).

===Powerhouse Pepper and Lena the Hyena===
Wolverton&#x27;s humor feature &quot;Powerhouse Pepper&quot;, about a superstrong if none-too-bright boxer, appeared in various comic books published by Timely Comics, the 1930s and 1940s precursor of Marvel Comics, from 1942 through 1952. The strip was characterized by alliterative, rhyming dialogue, screwball comedy and throwaway gags in background. The Timely titles, such as &quot;Joker Comics&quot;, &quot;Gay Comics&quot; and &quot;Tessie the Typist&quot;, debuted a number of his spin-off characters and features, including Flap Flipflop, The Flying Flash (who later appeared in Charlton Comics&#x27; &quot;Jack in the Box&quot; #13), Leanbean Green, &quot;Cartoon Crime Mystery&quot; featuring Inspector Hector the Crime Detector, Doc Rockblock, &quot;Picture Poems about Peculiar People&quot;, &quot;Funny Boners&quot;, Dauntless Dawson, &quot;Hothead Hotel&quot;, &quot;Bedtime Bunk&quot;, &quot;Foolish Faces&quot; and more.

Five issues of a &quot;Powerhouse Pepper&quot; comic book were released in 1943 and 1948 by Timely, but not all the covers were by Wolverton and many interior pages were also not devoted to Wolverton strips.
In 1946, Wolverton won a contest to depict &quot;Lena the Hyena&quot;, the world&#x27;s ugliest woman, a running gag in Al Capp&#x27;s &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; newspaper strip where Lena remained unseen beneath an editorial note stating her face had been covered to protect readers. Capp, responding to popular demand, announced a contest for artists to submit their interpretations. Among 500,000 entries, Wolverton&#x27;s was the winner; it appeared in a &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; daily and &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Wolverton&#x27;s fame briefly led to &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Pageant&quot; printing his caricatures. The Lena portrait typified the unique &quot;spaghetti-and-meatballs school of design&quot; style he employed regularly thereafter.

In the 1950s, Wolverton produced 17 comic-book horror and science-fiction stories for Marvel and other comic-book publishers, including one story by author Daniel Keyes, which led to him being &quot;hailed for creating uniquely grotesque monsters&quot;. Among these tales were &quot;The Brain Bats of Venus&quot; for &quot;Mister Mystery&quot; #7 and &quot;Where Monsters Dwell&quot; in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Adventures into Terror&quot; #7, the title of which was later used for a 1970s Marvel reprint series.

Wolverton first appeared in &quot;Mad&quot; with a single panel in #10, drew &quot;Mad Reader!&quot; for #11 and also contributed an iconic Lena-like image to the cover of #11, which was billed as the &quot;Beautiful Girl of the Month&quot;. Although Wolverton contributed sporadically to the title—appearing in just nine issues over two decades—his work was memorable enough that, in 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; dubbed him &quot;The Michelangelo of Mad Magazine&quot;. E.C.&#x27;s other humor title, &quot;Panic&quot;, edited by Al Feldstein (who later became &quot;Mad&quot;&#x27;s editor for 30 years) also used Wolverton&#x27;s art on a &quot;Panic&quot; cover, though publisher William M. Gaines was not a fan of Wolverton&#x27;s work. Other humor magazines from other companies such as &quot;Cracked&quot;, &quot;From Here to Insanity&quot; and &quot;Cockeyed&quot; also featured Wolverton&#x27;s work, as did an issue of &quot;Ballyhoo&quot;.

===Later career===
In 1968, Wolverton did the &quot;Ugly Posters&quot; series of trading cards for Topps, displaying his trademark twisted headshots.

In 1973, he returned to mainstream comics, illustrating several covers for Joe Orlando&#x27;s satiric &quot;Plop!&quot; at DC Comics. &quot;Comix Book&quot;, a joint production of Marvel Comics and Denis Kitchen&#x27;s Kitchen Sink Press, featured two strips by Wolverton, &quot;Calvin&quot; and &quot;Weird Creatures&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1934, Wolverton married his Vancouver High School classmate Honor Lovette (class of 1927). They remained married until his death.

Wolverton was baptized into Herbert W. Armstrong&#x27;s Radio Church of God in 1941 and was ordained as an elder in 1943. As a board member of that church, he was one of the six people, including Armstrong and his wife, who reincorporated the church in 1946 when it moved from its original headquarters in Oregon to California.

Wolverton died on December 31, 1978, at age 69.

Wolverton&#x27;s son, editorial cartoonist Monte Wolverton, has worked for &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; and contributed to &quot;Mad&quot;.

<text>The Cotton District is a community located in Starkville, Mississippi. It was founded by Dan Camp, who was the developer, owner and property manager of much of the area. It is significant for its use of traditional architecture and as an example of traditional neighborhood development practices in the 1960s.

The Cotton District has elements of Greek Revival mixed with Classical or Victorian. Many of these ideas came from Camp&#x27;s own travels to Europe and parts of the United States, like Charleston and New Orleans. The Cotton District is a walkable neighborhood that contains some restaurants and bars in addition to hundreds of unique residential units, many which are filled by college students and young professionals.

The area is home to the annual Cotton District Arts Festival which now boasts as many as 40,000 attendants each year. It also hosts the annual Bulldog Bash, which draws over 20,000 people for the festival&#x27;s free concerts and has featured artists such as Third Eye Blind, Gavin Degraw, Sister Hazel, Howie Day, Will Hoge, Hardy, and Edwin McCain among others.

Starkville is adjacent to the campus of Mississippi State University and is also a registered retirement community.

<text>Ramón Emilio &quot;Raymond&quot; Arrieta Vázquez (born March 26, 1965), is a Puerto Rican actor, comedian, host and philanthropist. Starting his career as a comedian in various local shows, Arrieta gained popularity in the 1990s when he hosted a string of successful comedy shows where he showcased his various characters and personifications. Since 2007, Arrieta has been hosting the mid-day variety show &quot;Día a Día&quot;, along with Dagmar. Arrieta is also a radio show host and a theater actor.

Arrieta has gained prominence for his philanthropic endeavors. After his friend and co-host, Dagmar, was diagnosed with cancer in 2008, Arrieta has performed a yearly charity walk around various parts of the island while also raising awareness. Because of his commitment to the cause, Arrieta has received numerous recognitions, including from the Senate of Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
Raymond Arrieta was born in Hato Rey, one of the main &quot;barrios&quot; of San Juan, Puerto Rico. His parents were Ramón Arrieta and Carmín Vázquez. Arrieta went to school at the Academy Nuestra Señora de la Providencia. When he was in the third grade, Arrieta volunteered to play the part of &quot;Ramoneta Cienfuegos&quot;, a character of popular Puerto Rican comedian Shorty Castro, in a school play. After that he continued to participate in many other plays at school, even organizing his own. One of the works he wrote and directed was &quot;Mundo Loco&quot;, which told a story about a war between fans of Salsa music and fans of Rock music. Arrieta has mentioned that José Miguel Agrelot has always been his main inspiration.

After Arrieta graduated from high school, he enrolled in the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón of San Juan, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Radio and Television Production in 1987. There, he also joined Phi Sigma Alpha fraternity.

On one occasion, Arrieta and some friends visited the café theater &quot;El Punto del Coquí&quot; located in Old San Juan. He sat down and played the piano while doing imitations. The owner of the club was impressed and asked Arrieta to prepare an act for his club. Arrieta prepared an act called &quot;Black and White&quot; which was a success and he was soon traveling around the island with his &quot;show&quot;. In 1983, Our Lady of the Providence Academy established the &quot;Raymond Arrieta Award&quot; which is annually awarded to the student with the best artistic qualities.

==Career as a comedian==
In 1988, Arrieta already had his own radio show and was also participating in Telemundo&#x27;s &quot;Estudio Alegre&quot; (Happy Studio);&quot;El Show del Medio Día&quot; (The Noon Show) for WAPA among others. He landed a role in the Spanish version of the play &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;.

In 1991, Arrieta went to Mexico where he participated in the play &quot;Mama ama el Rock&quot; (Mother loves Rock) with Mexican stars Angelica María and Angélica Vale. In 1995, he replaced George Ortuzar as the host of &quot;Lente Loco&quot; (&quot;Crazy Lens&quot;), a &quot;Candid Camera&quot;-style show, co-hosting with Cuban model Odalys García.

Later in the nineties, he had his own show &quot;Que Vacilón&quot; which aired in prime time through WAPA. In this comedy show of sketches and stand-ups, he brought to life, along with other local talents, which also included Rene Monclova, Jorge Castro, and Tita Guerrero, a bunch of peculiar characters who gained immense popularity in the Puerto Rican pop culture, like the clown Trompetilla, a grumpy clown with a kind of fraudulent circus; and Andresito a kind of Dennis the Menace little boy. Many consider this period to be the peak of his career.

Arrieta had his own weekly TV show in Puerto Rico called &quot;El Show de Raymond&quot;. Which was transmitted through Televicentro and WAPA TV. In 2007 he switched to Telemundo and WKAQ-TV, where he currently stars in his own daytime daily show, &quot;Día a Día con Raymond y Dagmar&quot;. Puerto Rican comedian, José Miguel Agrelot once said, that Raymond Arrieta was the greatest comedian of the &quot;new&quot; generation.

In 2014, Raymond returned to comedy television with the WKAQ-TV sketch comedy &quot;Raymond y sus Amigos&quot;, which also reunites him with &quot;Que Vacilon&quot; cast members Monclova and Castro.

==Da Vida Caminando con Raymond (Walk-A-Thon)==
On Friday, May 15, 2009, Arrieta began a Walk-A-Thon to raise funds for cancer patients in Puerto Rican institutions, the city of Ponce to San Juan arriving in Telemundo Puerto Rico. The Walk-A-Thon which ended on May 19, 2009. This hike was named the 2nd Hike Ramón Rivero &quot;Diplo,&quot; the first man to hold a walka-a-thon in the world to raise funds for a cause, in 1953—for the Oncological Hospital, in San Juan. On October 23, 2009 Fi Sigma Alfa honored Raymond Arrieta by bestowing upon him the &quot;Medalla de Caballero Sigma&quot; a medal only four other members have been honored with.

Arrieta walked again for cancer patients in 2010 from Aguadilla to San Juan arriving in Telemundo Puerto Rico with the name &quot;Da Vida Caminando con Raymond&quot;. On June 4, 2010, on the very morning of the start of the Walk-A-Thon, Caguas mayor, William Miranda Marín died from pancreatic cancer. The 2010 edition of the Walk-A-Thon was dedicated to &quot;Willie&quot; first thing in the morning after in 2009 the Walk-A-Thon passed by through Caguas and he told Arrieta he would participate again the next year.

In 2011, Raymond walked for a third time from Vieques to San Juan in six days and raised money for the Puerto Rico Oncologist Hospital patients, which had no money to pay employees or. He walked 12 miles through the island of Vieques, then boarded a ferry back to Fajardo and continued to walk in a treadmill completing 2 miles in about an hour and a half. After reaching Fajardo everyone rested for the next day. In 3 days he reached San Juan, near the facilities of Telemundo. However, before arriving to San Juan, he followed the route which led to Caguas and he attended a memorial service held in honor of the memory of the late Caguas mayor William Miranda Marín, at the Caguas Botanical Garden, As stated before, Miranda Marín died on June 4, 2010, the first day of Arrieta&#x27;s Walk-A-Thon from Mayagüez. The Walk-A-Thon continued to Río Piedras, then back to San Juan. The goal for this fund-raiser was $1 Million and, according to statistics, a record has been set with an unknown quantity of money at the moment. The route he completed was Vieques-Fajardo, Fajardo-Río Grande, Río Grande-San Juan, San Juan-Caguas, Caguas-Río Piedras and Río Piedras-San Juan.

<text>A personal assistant who accompanies the president of the United States virtually everywhere is generally referred to as a body man or body woman, but in some cases may be referred to as a personal aide. These personal aides to the president are often responsible for arranging and providing: lodging; transportation; interactions with media, public, and family; meals; personal briefings and briefing papers; logistical instructions; speech cards; snacks; cell phones; and any other necessary assistance. Such personal aides exist for many politicians aside from presidents, but the most famous have included personal aides to the president, as described below.

==History==

Upon taking office in 1969, Richard Nixon expanded and professionalized the White House Office staff. A new position was created, Personal Aide to the President. Previously this role had largely been filled by a White House valet. This role remained, but unlike the valet, the Personal Aide to the President travels wherever the president goes whereas the valet always remains stationed at the White House.

<text>The National Congress (Spanish: &quot;Congreso Nacional)&quot; was the unicameral legislative branch of the government of Ecuador prior to November 2007.

Under the 1998 Constitution, Congress met in Quito and was made up of 100 deputies &quot;(diputados).&quot; Each of the country&#x27;s 22 provinces returned a minimum of two deputies plus one additional seat for every 200,000 inhabitants.

It was dissolved on 29 November 2007 by the Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly and replaced by the National Assembly of Ecuador under the 2008 Constitution. Its demise came when it was already weakened by the disfavorable perception of the Ecuadorian public opinion, which for decades saw it as a corrupt and incompetent entity, as well as a venue for violent disputes between its members and political intrigues, such as the removal of Presidents Abdalá Bucaram Ortiz in 1997 and Lucio Gutiérrez in 2005.

==Eligibility==
To serve as a congressional deputy, the following requirements had to be met:
*Ecuadorian citizen by birth, not by naturalisation
*Having full enjoyment of political rights
*At least 25 years of age upon filing candidacy
*Native of the province represented, or resident thereof for at least three years immediately prior to the election

<doc id="1259221" wikidata="Q1168251" url="?curid=1259221" title="Golitsyn (crater)">
<text>Golitsyn is a lunar impact crater that lies beyond the western limb on the far side of the Moon. It is located in the southwestern portion of the Montes Rook mountain range that forms one of the rings around the Mare Orientale impact site. The crater is situated in the midst of rugged, irregular terrain that contains only a handful of other significant craters.

The rim of Golitsyn is circular but irregular, and a smaller crater lies across the north-northwestern rim. The edge of the rim is sharp, and the material along narrow inner wall has slumped down to form mounds along the base. The interior floor has no impacts or features of note.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Golitsyn.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Golitsyn B — &quot;See&quot; Fryxell.

<text>Caconda is a town and a municipality in the province of Huíla, Angola. The municipality had a population of 167,820 in 2014.

The &quot;Concelho&quot; (municipality) was officially founded on 1857. It has a population of 167,820 (2014 census). In the 19th century, Caconda was the most advanced point in the colonial territory of Portugal in Africa.

There is also another populated place in Angola called Caconda, in the province of Huambo, and a river, in the province of Uige.

Caconda has a place in the history of zoology, because it was in this region that the great Portuguese naturalist and explorer José Alberto de Oliveira Anchieta (1833–1897) carried out the greater part of his work. He died in 1897 in Caconda, while returning from an expedition.

The Caconda region was severely affected by the Angolan Civil War. It is an extremely poor area, with a more than 20% malnutrition rate and many families living on subsistence farming. Many people were displaced during the civil war. The United Nations relief program and the World Food Program have been essential in addressing the humanitarian catastrophe.
==Geography==
It is located the Plano Alto region, approximately 280 km North of Lubango, the provincial capital city, and approximately 700 km South from Luanda, the country&#x27;s capital city.
===Climate===
Caconda has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwb&quot;).

<doc id="1259226" wikidata="Q3063514" url="?curid=1259226" title="Fabian Cortez">
<text>Fabian Cortez is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Jim Lee, the character first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 (October 1991). Cortez is a recurring antagonist of the X-Men. He is known under the codename The Power.

== Development ==

=== Concept and creation ===
The character was created toward the end of Claremont&#x27;s tenure writing the X-Men and was the last major character he introduced. He is rumored to have been named after writer Fabian Nicieza, who Claremont had tensions with at the time.

=== Publication history ===
Fabian Cortez debuted in &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 (October 1991), created by Chris Claremont and Jim Lee. He appeared in the 2020 &quot;S.W.O.R.D.&quot; series, and the 2021 &quot;Way of X&quot; series.

==Fictional character biography==

===Acolytes===
Thought to be royalty from Spain, Fabian Cortez organizes the original Acolytes, who pledge themselves to Magneto and his cause. Cortez then goads and manipulates Magneto into combat with humanity and the X-Men at every turn, leading to the destruction of Magneto&#x27;s space-station, Asteroid M, and the deaths of the other Acolytes, including Cortez&#x27;s own sister Anne Marie.

Cortez recruits a group of Acolytes who, believing Magneto to be dead and martyred for his cause, now worship him as their god, to follow Cortez in Magneto&#x27;s name. They launch several strikes on humanity, ranging from attacks on a military base where new Sentinels are being built, to slaughtering helpless humans in a hospital. Magneto eventually resurfaces, sending his chosen heir Exodus to inform the Acolytes of Cortez&#x27;s betrayal. The Acolytes welcome Exodus as their new leader, and Cortez is left behind.

===&quot;Bloodties&quot;===
Fearing Magneto&#x27;s wrath, Cortez flees to Genosha. Still claiming to speak in Magneto&#x27;s name, he incites the nation&#x27;s mutant population into starting a civil war against the humans, the world&#x27;s first instance of the long-threatened genetic war between man and mutant. With the aid of the mutates, Cortez kidnaps Magneto&#x27;s granddaughter Luna, intending to use her as a shield to protect himself from Magneto, the X-Men, and the Avengers. Cortez is unaware that Magneto had recently been mindwiped by Charles Xavier; and Exodus comes to Genosha in his place, seemingly killing Cortez.

===Back with the Acolytes===
Cortez reappears months later, claiming to have been badly injured, yet not actually killed, despite all appearances. He manipulates Joseph into posing as Magneto, pitting him against Exodus in an attempt to regain control of the Acolytes. Despite his scheme&#x27;s failure, he is allowed to return to the team. Months later, after Exodus was briefly imprisoned, the Acolytes split into two groups, each searching for Magneto. Cortez leads one group, but they abandon him during a battle with the X-Men, upon realising how he has been using them for his own purposes.

===&quot;Dark Seduction&quot;===
Alone again, Cortez is surprised to be recruited by Magneto himself, to whom the United Nations has given control of Genosha. Seeing as how Cortez had betrayed him earlier, Magneto only lets Fabian Cortez serve him on Genosha because his own powers have been reduced and Cortez&#x27;s mutant power is needed to heighten the abilities of the other mutants. After a further betrayal by Cortez, discovered by Magneto&#x27;s UN advisor Alda Huxley to be the leader of the Genoshen cabinet assisting a rebellion in Carrion Cove, Magneto is restored to full power by one of the Genengineer&#x27;s machines and, as he no longer needs Cortez, moves him from a prison in Hammer Bay, to over fifty miles away to Carrion Cove in less than 20 seconds. The impact kills Cortez instantly, as he is splattered on the ground at Magneto&#x27;s feet. Just before his death, a connection between Cortez and the geneticist Mister Sinister was implied, which would explain how Cortez returned alive and well when everyone believed him dead at the hands of Exodus.

===Necrosha===
After the X-Men form Utopia, Magneto joins them, saying he supports their efforts. Selene especially wants Magneto captured for his collaboration with Emma Frost to overthrow her from her position as Black Queen of the Hellfire Club. She has three of her recently resurrected mind-controlled soldiers—Acolytes Cortez, Delgado, and Mellencamp—hunt down Magneto. They try to torture Loa to get the information out of her, but when she tries to hide in her room she finds Deadpool inside it. Deadpool battles the trio, but the techno-organic virus that is inside the Acolytes (which caused their resurrection) prevent him from killing them. At one point in the battle, Cortez grabs Loa by the throat and demands to know Magneto&#x27;s location, saying that even though Selene wants Magneto alive he will fight the mind-control and kill him anyway. Loa begs Cortez not to make her hurt him, something Cortez does not believe possible. Deadpool knocks Loa out of Cortez&#x27;s hands, but then is overpowered by the Acolytes. Loa uses her matter disruption powers to slide through Mellencamp, mutilating him. Deadpool, seeing that Loa&#x27;s powers were able to slay Selene&#x27;s minions, forces her to kill Cortez and Delgado by throwing her into them (to survive, she has to slide through them, which causes them to crumble). Deadpool then tells Cyclops that he should not be in trouble because Loa had done all the killing.

The techno-organic virus however appears to reform Cortez, as he resurfaced later along with fellow Upstarts members Shinobi Shaw, Siena Blaze, and Trevor Fitzroy, and started the game that they created long ago. They kill members of the Nasty Boys to lure out Cyclops and his ragtag team of X-Men to Washington Heights. After a brief exchange of words, the two groups engage each other in battle. The X-Men gain the upper hand as the Upstarts retreat; but Shinobi is left behind, only to kill himself as he does not want to be captured or controlled by the Hellfire Club.

===Krakoa===
Cortez later joins the Six, a mutant team led by S.W.O.R.D. and Abigail Brand. During Knull&#x27;s attack on Krakoa, he joins S.W.O.R.D in defending Krakoa before Knull kills him and Sunfire. However, he is quickly revived via Krakoa&#x27;s resurrection protocols.

==Powers and abilities==
Fabian Cortez is a mutant with the ability to augment the powers of other mutants, sometimes to their benefit, and sometimes to their detriment. He can increase a mutant&#x27;s abilities, rejuvenating them after exhaustion, or seemingly enhancing their power. However, his manipulations often come with a price—Cortez can make mutants dependent on his &quot;treatments,&quot; using this dependency to exert control over them. He can &quot;supercharge&quot; their powers to dangerous levels. Cortez is also capable of nullifying the powers of other mutants. Furthermore, he can heal others by temporarily enhancing their natural healing factor.

==Other versions==

===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
In the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; reality, Magneto heads to earth to rescue anyone he can from the zombie plague. Cortez is entrusted with overseeing Asteroid M and preparing it to be the last outpost of humanoid life. Cortez does this well; his group soon joins up with other survivors, including Forge and the Black Panther. Magneto perishes in battle against the zombies. Decades later, in &quot;Marvel Zombies 2&quot;, Cortez&#x27;s child regains control of the colony during a battle with cosmically powered zombies.

===&quot;X-Men Forever&quot;===
In this reality, which takes place shortly after the X-Men escape the destruction of Asteroid M, Nick Fury enlists the X-Men in helping him find and capture Cortez. The X-Men successfully capture Cortez, although he nearly defeats them single-handedly. Cortez is eventually turned over to S.H.I.E.L.D., but corrupt agents within then give him over the anti-mutant Consortium. Eager to exploit the &quot;burnout&quot; (that reality&#x27;s phenomenon where mutant powers cause people to physically give out and die prematurely), the Consortium thought Cortez&#x27;s powers were rife with the potential to weaponize the concept. Weeks later, Cortez is rescued by Nick Fury and the X-Men, but is on the verge of death due to the experimentation he was forced to endure. Cortez dies in the custody of the X-Men shortly thereafter.

===&quot;X-Men &#x27;92&quot;===
Cortez appears in &quot;X-Men &#x27;92&quot;, when he overcharges Lila Cheney&#x27;s teleporting powers; and she takes the X-Men to a distant planet inhabited by the mutant Brood.

===&quot;What If&quot;===
Cortez appears in a number of &quot;What If...?&quot; issues.
In the reality seen where Tony Stark chooses not to begin a super-hero career as Iron Man after returning from captivity. Cortez and the Acolytes assemble under Magneto and battle both the X-Men and the StarkTech Sentinels that threaten mutant lives after Tony Stark&#x27;s innovations to America&#x27;s Sentinel program pushes the mutant race to the brink of extinction.

In the reality where the space station Avalon was officially recognized as a mutant colony under the rule of Magneto, divisions between his Acolytes erupt, with Exodus leading the isolationists, who want to take Avalon to the stars and away from the taint of humanity on Earth, while Cortez&#x27;s annihilationists wish to return to Earth, eliminate the humans, and reclaim their homeland. These concerns become secondary after the birth of Acolytes Skids and Rusty&#x27;s first child, who registers as Homo Ultima, the next stage of humanity, beyond even that of mutant. Cortez and Exodus unite their factions for fear of being usurped, leading to the death of the child. In the aftermath, it is revealed that Magneto engineered fake genetic scan results for Homo Ultima, sacrificing the child to bring unity to his Acolytes.

==In other media==
===Television===
Fabian Cortez appears in &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;, voiced by Jeffrey Max Nicholls. This version initially serves as the leader of the Acolytes. Following a failed attempt at betraying Magneto, Cortez becomes a follower of Apocalypse and enacts a plot to transfer the latter&#x27;s essence into a new host. However, his plan backfires and Apocalypse possesses Cortez instead.

<doc id="1259229" wikidata="Q173210" url="?curid=1259229" title="Concorde Agreement">
<text>The Concorde Agreement is a contract between the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), the Formula One teams and the Formula One Group which dictates the terms by which the teams compete in races, and how the television revenues and prize money is shared. There have been eight versions of the Concorde Agreement, all of which terms were kept strictly secret: the first one was signed in 1981, with newer agreements being signed in 1987, 1992, 1997, 1998, 2009, 2013; the current agreement was signed in 2021. The secrecy was broken by racing journalist Forrest Bond, when the 120-page 1997 Concorde Agreement was published at the end of 2005 by RaceFax.

The intent of the agreements is to encourage professionalism and to increase the commercial success of Formula One. Conditions of the agreement generally include the obligation of the teams to participate in every race, hence making the sport more reliable for broadcasters, who were expected to invest heavily to acquire television broadcast rights, and a percentage of the sport&#x27;s commercial revenue in return for the teams.

==First Concorde Agreement (1981-1986)==
In 1979, the Commission Sportive Internationale, a subordinate organization of the FIA, which was at that time the rule-making body for Formula One, was dissolved. It was replaced by the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), which would serve the same function. FISA clashed repeatedly with the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), which represented the teams&#x27; interests. FOCA&#x27;s chief executive at the time was Bernie Ecclestone and his legal advisor was Max Mosley, while the president of FISA was Jean Marie Balestre.

The two organizations&#x27; disagreements, which came to be known as the FISA–FOCA war, resulted in several races being cancelled, or declared non-valid (e.g. the 1980 Spanish Grand Prix). Goodyear threatened to withdraw entirely from Formula One, an event which would have been commercially disastrous for the sport, so Ecclestone organized a meeting with all team managers, Balestre, and other FISA representatives at the FIA headquarters in Place de la Concorde, Paris, France. On 19 January 1981, after thirteen straight hours of negotiation, all parties present signed the first Concorde Agreement, named after the square in which the negotiations took place.

The contract&#x27;s terms remain largely confidential, though its known stipulations required the signatory teams to appear and compete in every race, and guaranteed their right to do so in order to assure the sport&#x27;s newly acquired television public that they would have a race to watch. Also, perhaps most importantly, the agreement granted FOCA the right to televise Formula One races — this right was &quot;leased&quot; to Formula One Promotions and Administration, a company established and owned by Bernie Ecclestone. Another important element was the stability in rules, described as protecting the teams from &quot;the whims of the governing body&quot;.

It expired on 31 December 1987.

==Second Concorde Agreement (1987-1991)==
The second Concorde Agreement governed the to seasons. When the second Concorde Agreement was agreed in 1987, Ecclestone ceased being a team owner and established Formula One Promotions and Administration (FOPA) to manage TV rights for the teams. FOPA would later become known as Formula One Management (FOM). FOPA received 49% of TV revenues: 1% went to the teams, and 50% to the FIA. FOPA also received all the fees paid by promoters and paid prize money to the teams.

==Third Concorde Agreement (1992-1996)==
The third Concorde Agreement covered the to seasons. Ecclestone required the approval of Jean-Marie Balestre and the FIA to transfer Formula One television rights to FOCA. He arranged that his business partner Paddy McNally, who was proficient in French, should negotiate the agreement with Balestre, and eventually they came to terms. Balestre was unaware of Ecclestone&#x27;s aggressive expansion and the value of the television rights. Max Mosley became FIA president shortly after in 1993.

==Fourth Concorde Agreement (1997-2002)==
In 1995, the FIA decided to transfer Formula One&#x27;s commercial rights from FOCA to Formula One Administration for a 14-year period. In exchange, Ecclestone would provide an annual payment. McLaren, Williams and Tyrrell protested this by rejecting the proposed Concorde Agreement (negotiations for which started as early as 1993). Ken Tyrrell in particular was enraged by the fact that Ecclestone, as the president of FOCA, had negotiated the transfer of the rights from the current organization to his own company. Tyrrell also objected the addendum to the Agreement being secret, arguing that secrecy surrounding the agreement would have only benefitted Ecclestone (by weakening the bargaining power of other parties).

The said three teams refused to sign the proposed Concorde Agreement, initially with the support of the remaining teams. However, on 5 September 1996 the new Concorde Agreement was signed by all teams except McLaren, Williams and Tyrrell. The agreement was supposed to be in effect from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2002.

In 2005, racing journalist Forrest Bond published the 120-page 1997 Concorde Agreement on RaceFax, hence making it the first (and to this date only) version of the agreement to ever be released to the public.

==Fifth Concorde Agreement (1998-2007)==
By taking a stand against the actions of Ecclestone, the FIA and the wider commercial aspects of Formula One, McLaren, Williams and Tyrrell lost both influence in the sport and the income which they would have received as signatories. A compromise was reached and on 27 August 1998, a new Concorde Agreement was signed, which accommodated the three teams and which expired on 31 December 2007.

==Sixth Concorde Agreement (2008-2012)==
On 7 December 2004, at a meeting attended by the bosses of all teams except Ferrari, Ecclestone offered a payout of £260,000,000 over three years in return for unanimous renewal of the fifth Concorde Agreement, which would guarantee the continuation of Formula One in its present form at least until the expiration of that contract.

On 19 January 2005, Ferrari announced that it had signed an extension to the previous agreement to expire on 31 December 2012. On 18 July 2005, Red Bull also signed an extension, as Jordan and Midland did two days later. On 7 December 2005, Williams became the fourth team to sign the extension.

On 27 March 2006, the five Grand Prix Manufacturers Association-backed teams - BMW Sauber, Renault, Honda, McLaren and Toyota - submitted their applications for the 2008 season, agreeing to stay in the sport until 2012. On 14 May 2006, the five GPMA-backed teams signed a memorandum of understanding with the commercial rightsholders (CVC/Ecclestone) which formed the basis of the next Concorde Agreement. As such, a full Concorde Agreement was not in place for the season, with the Memorandum, extensions and agreements with the other individual teams acting as a stop-gap solution.

On 29 July 2008, the ten currently competing teams created the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) to negotiate the terms of contract. After a dispute between FOTA and the FIA in the first half of , a new Concorde Agreement was signed by Mosley and all of the teams, although Sauber, in transition as majority owner of BMW, had announced, shortly beforehand, its intention of withdrawing from the sport at the end of the season, so waited until a controlling stake of the team was returned to Peter Sauber before signing. The new agreement provides for a continuation of the terms of the 1998 agreement, and runs until 31 December 2012. At the same meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council, a programme of resource restriction was also agreed upon, as were a revised set of sporting and technical regulations for the season.

==Seventh Concorde Agreement (2013-2020) ==
The 2013 Concorde Agreement took an extended period of negotiations. The sixth agreement ran until 31 December 2012, but no new agreement was in place for the start of the 2013 season. In October 2012 FIA communicated that they were expecting a final settlement between all parties involved within weeks. In reality it took until September 2013.

Strictly speaking the 2013 Agreement does not really meet the qualifications for a &#x27;Concorde&#x27; Agreement, as it is not a collective agreement among the parties involved. Rather, it is a series of individual bilateral agreements between Bernie Ecclestone&#x27;s Formula One Group and all other parties involved being FIA and the individual Formula One teams.

In October 2012, Bernie Ecclestone indicated that he already had agreements with all teams for the 2013-2020 period. However, this list did not yet include Marussia. The Marussia Formula One Team did manage to sign its own bilateral agreement with the Formula One Group in October 2013.

The Concorde Implementation Agreement between the FIA and the Formula One Group was signed in July 2013 and was enforced on 27 September 2013. It expired on 31 December 2020. The FIA press announcement about this agreement mentioned that &quot;the parties will move towards the conclusions of a multi-party Concorde agreement&quot;, but such a multi-party agreement never materialized.

==Eighth Concorde Agreement (2021-2025)==
Negotiations over the terms to replace the 2013 agreement began as part of wider discussions over the future of the sport in 2017. A deadline to reach a deal was extended until 31 October 2019. The Agreement was reported to be nearing completion in January 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix weekend, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff declared his dissatisfaction with the terms of the new agreement, which was to introduce a budget cap from the season and change the prize money distribution. Wolff believed that his team would be affected most negatively. In response, the deadline for signing the agreement, previously set for 12 August, was moved back a week. However, after discussions with Chase Carey, Wolff changed stance and declared his willingness to sign the new agreement. The new Concorde Agreement seeks to protect the value of the incumbent teams, by requiring new entrants to pay 200 million dollars up front, shared equally among 10 existing teams, in exchange for having the right of revenue share in its first year of competition. Previously, new entries only received the prize money from their second year of competition.

On 18 August 2020, Ferrari, McLaren, and Williams announced that they had signed the new Concorde Agreement, whilst the following day Formula One announced that the other teams had also signed. The agreement, which is the first to be signed under new owners Liberty Media, covers the to seasons, and came into force on 1 January 2021.
==Ninth Concorde Agreement (2026 onwards)==

<text>Fang Zhimin (, Wade–Giles: Fang Chih Min; August 21, 1899 – August 6, 1935) was a Chinese communist military and political leader.

==Life==
Born in a poor peasant household in Yixian, Jiangxi Province, Fang joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1924 and assisted in setting up a provincial party organization.

After the failure of the Shanghai Uprising in 1927, Fang returned to Jiangxi, where he worked in organizing the peasantry and urged them to take part in armed uprisings.

From 1928 to 1933 Fang conducted guerrilla operations, enacted land reforms, established a base area in the border area of Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, and organized a section of the Chinese Red Army.

Fang used revolution as a cover to rob, rape and murder people in the vicinity of the Nanchang Soviet Area. In 1935, he was convicted and executed by the Republic of China government for participating in the kidnapping and murder of John Cornelius Stam and his wife.

==Death==
Fang was later elected a member of the Central Committee during the sixth session of the Fifth Party Congress. Fang was captured by the Kuomintang in January 1935 and executed on August 6, 1935. The 2015 opera &quot;Fang Zhimin&quot; commemorates his life and death.

<text>Gerard Schwarz (born August 19, 1947), also known as Gerry Schwarz or Jerry Schwarz, is an American symphony conductor and trumpeter. As of 2019, Schwarz serves as the Artistic and Music Director of Palm Beach Symphony and the Director of Orchestral Activities and Music Director of the Frost Symphony Orchestra at the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami.

==Early life==
Schwarz was born in Weehawken, New Jersey, to Jewish parents. His parents were both physicians and took him to concerts and opera performances. Schwarz began his trumpet career at age 8. By 12 years of age, he dedicated his life to becoming a musician. He graduated from New York City&#x27;s High School of Performing Arts and Juilliard School of Music and began his musical career as a trumpeter, performing until 1977 as co-principal of the New York Philharmonic under Pierre Boulez. He began conducting in 1966.

Schwarz champions American composers, past and present. He has made more than 100 recordings with the Seattle Symphony including many American works. In particular, he won acclaim for his recordings of symphonies and orchestral works by Walter Piston, Howard Hanson, William Schuman, Alan Hovhaness, and David Diamond.

Schwarz built the strength of the Seattle Symphony. In 1983 it had 5,000 subscribers; as of 2008 it had 35,000. He spearheaded the effort to build Benaroya Hall for the symphony. However, his leadership style of the Seattle Symphony was controversial among some musicians. A portrait painting of Schwarz by artist Michele Rushworth was unveiled and installed at Benaroya Hall in 2011.

==Career==
In 1971 he won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions.

He frequently held multiple positions simultaneously. He was music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra from 1978 to 1986.

He served as music director of New York&#x27;s Mostly Mozart Festival from 1982 to 2001. He was the music director of the Seattle Symphony from 1985 to 2011.

From 2001 to 2006, Schwarz was music director of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra (RLPO). He served as music director of the New York Chamber Symphony and music advisor to Tokyo&#x27;s Orchard Hall in conjunction with the Tokyo Philharmonic.

In 2007, Schwarz was named music director of the Eastern Music Festival in North Carolina, having served as its principal conductor since 2005. He expanded the festival&#x27;s audience to the largest in its history, enhanced education and programming to include a composer in residence and three new concert series and increased collaboration with An Appalachian Summer Festival, where he is artistic partner for symphonic music programming.

===Recordings===
Among the orchestras that Schwarz has led on his other recordings are the Czech Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Orchestre National de France. In 2003 he recorded two concertos by Philip Glass: the Cello Concerto (with Julian Lloyd Webber) and the Concerto for Two Timpanists (with Evelyn Glennie and Jonathan Haas with the RLPO).

He recorded all of Mahler&#x27;s symphonies and Richard Strauss&#x27;s tone poems with the RLPO.

As a trumpet soloist, Schwarz has recorded the concertos of Franz Joseph Haydn and Johann Nepomuk Hummel for Delos.

In 2011, the block around Benaroya Hall was named &quot;Gerard Schwarz Place.&quot;

<text>Santos-Dumont is a small lunar impact crater that lies in the northern end of the Montes Apenninus range at the eastern edge of the Mare Imbrium. It is located about 30 kilometers to the northeast of Mons Hadley, a mountain massif.

This crater is a circular, bowl-shaped formation that is situated atop a ridge in the Montes Apenninus. It is otherwise an unremarkable formation with no unusual features and little appearance of wear.

To the northwest of Santos-Dumont is a 90-km-wide system of rilles designated the Rimae Fresnel, being named for the Promontorium Fresnel that lies to the north of the crater. This last formation forms the northern end of the Montes Apenninus, and lies astride the gap that joins the Mare Imbrium to the west with the Mare Serenitatis to the east. To the southeast, in the valley past Mons Hadley, is the landing site of the Apollo 15 mission.

This feature is named in honour of the Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont. It was previously designated Hadley B.

<text>Habitat fragmentation describes the emergence of discontinuities (fragmentation) in an organism&#x27;s preferred environment (habitat), causing population fragmentation and ecosystem decay. Causes of habitat fragmentation include geological processes that slowly alter the layout of the physical environment (suspected of being one of the major causes of speciation), and human activity such as land conversion, which can alter the environment much faster and causes the extinction of many species. More specifically, habitat fragmentation is a process by which large and contiguous habitats get divided into smaller, isolated patches of habitats.

==Definition==
The term habitat fragmentation includes five discrete phenomena:
* Reduction in the total area of the habitat
* Decrease of the interior: edge ratio
* Isolation of one habitat fragment from other areas of habitat
* Breaking up of one patch of habitat into several smaller patches
* Decrease in the average size of each patch of habitat

&quot;fragmentation ... not only causes loss of the amount of habitat but by creating small, isolated patches it also changes the properties of the remaining habitat&quot; (van den Berg et al. 2001). Habitat fragmentation is the landscape level of the phenomenon, and patch level process. Thus meaning, it covers; the patch areas, edge effects, and patch shape complexity.

In scientific literature, there is some debate whether the term &quot;habitat fragmentation&quot; applies in cases of habitat loss, or whether the term primarily applies to the phenomenon of habitat being cut into smaller pieces without significant reduction in habitat area. Scientists who use the stricter definition of &quot;habitat fragmentation&quot; per se would refer to the loss of habitat area as &quot;habitat loss&quot; and explicitly mention both terms if describing a situation where the habitat becomes less connected and there is less overall habitat.

Furthermore, habitat fragmentation is considered as an invasive threat to biodiversity, due to its implications of affecting large number of species than biological invasions, overexploitation, or pollution.

Additionally, the effects of habitat fragmentation damage the ability for species, such as native plants, to be able to effectively adapt to their changing environments. Ultimately, this prevents gene flow from one generation of population to the next, especially for species living in smaller population sizes. Whereas, for species of larger populations have more genetic mutations which can arise and genetic recombination impacts which can increase species survival in those environments. Overall, habitat fragmentation results in habitat disintegration and habitat loss which both tie into destructing biodiversity as a whole.

== Causes ==

===Natural causes===
Evidence of habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism, fire, and climate change is found in the fossil record.Studies have demonstrated the impacts of individual species at the landscape level For example, From research the results show that the impact of deer herbivory on forest plant communities can be observed at the landscape level at the Rondeau Provincial park for the period of 1955-1978 and also, habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.

===Human causes===
Habitat fragmentation is frequently caused by humans when native plants are cleared for human activities such as agriculture, rural development, urbanization and the creation of hydroelectric reservoirs. Habitats which were once continuous become divided into separate fragments. Due to human activities, many tropical and temperate habitats have already been severely fragmented, and in the near future, the degree of fragmentation will significantly rise. After intensive clearing, the separate fragments tend to be very small islands isolated from each other by cropland, pasture, pavement, or even barren land. The latter is often the result of slash and burn farming in tropical forests. In the wheat belt of central-western New South Wales, Australia, 90% of the native vegetation has been cleared and over 99% of the tall grass prairie of North America has been cleared, resulting in extreme habitat fragmentation.

=== Endogenous vs. exogenous ===
The two types of processes that can lead to habitat fragmentation are known as endogenous processes and exogenous processes. Endogenous is a process that develops as a part of species biology so they typically include changes in biology, behavior, and interactions within or between species. Endogenous threats can result in changes to breeding patterns or migration patterns and are often triggered by exogenous processes. Exogenous processes are independent of species biology and can include habitat degradation, habitat subdivision or habitat isolation. These processes can have a substantial impact on endogenous processes by fundamentally altering species behavior. Habitat subdivision or isolation can lead to changes in dispersal or movement of species including changes to seasonal migration. These changes can lead to a decrease in a density of species, increased competition or even increased predation.

==Implications ==

=== Habitat and biodiversity loss ===

One of the major ways that habitat fragmentation affects biodiversity is by reducing the amount of suitable habitat available for organisms. Habitat fragmentation often involves both habitat destruction and the subdivision of previously continuous habitat. Plants and other sessile organisms are disproportionately affected by some types of habitat fragmentation because they cannot respond quickly to the altered spatial configuration of the habitat. Habitat fragmentation consistently reduces biodiversity by 13 to 75% and impairs key ecosystem functions by decreasing biomass and altering nutrient cycles. This underscores the severe and lasting ecological impacts of fragmentation, which could be highlighted in the sections discussing the consequences of fragmentation.

Habitat loss, which can occur through the process of habitat fragmentation, is considered to be the greatest threat to species. But, the effect of the configuration of habitat patches within the landscape, independent of the effect of the amount of habitat within the landscape (referred to as fragmentation per se), has been suggested to be small. A review of empirical studies found that, of the 381 reported significant effect of habitat fragmentation per se on species occurrences, abundances or diversity in the scientific literature, 76% were positive whereas 24% were negative. Despite these results, the scientific literature tends to emphasize negative effects more than positive effects. Positive effects of habitat fragmentation per se imply that several small patches of habitat can have higher conservation value than a single large patch of equivalent size. Land sharing strategies could therefore have more positive impacts on species than land sparing strategies. Although the negative effects of habitat loss are generally viewed to be much larger than that of habitat fragmentation, the two events are heavily connected and observations are not usually independent of one another.
Area is the primary determinant of the number of species in a fragment and the relative contributions of demographic and genetic processes to the risk of global population extinction depend on habitat configuration, stochastic environmental variation and species features. Minor fluctuations in climate, resources, or other factors that would be unremarkable and quickly corrected in large populations can be catastrophic in small, isolated populations. Thus fragmentation of habitat is an important cause of species extinction. Population dynamics of subdivided populations tend to vary ly. In an unfragmented landscape a declining population can be &quot;rescued&quot; by immigration from a nearby expanding population. In fragmented landscapes, the distance between fragments may prevent this from happening. Additionally, unoccupied fragments of habitat that are separated from a source of immigrants by some barrier are less likely to be repopulated than adjoining fragments. Even small species such as the Columbia spotted frog are reliant on the rescue effect. Studies showed 25% of juveniles travel a distance over 200m compared to 4% of adults. Of these, 95% remain in their new locale, demonstrating that this journey is necessary for survival.

Additionally, habitat fragmentation leads to edge effects. Microclimatic changes in light, temperature, and wind can alter the ecology around the fragment, and in the interior and exterior portions of the fragment. Fires become more likely in the area as humidity drops and temperature and wind levels rise. Exotic and pest species may establish themselves easily in such disturbed environments, and the proximity of domestic animals often upsets the natural ecology. Also, habitat along the edge of a fragment has a different climate and favours different species from the interior habitat. Small fragments are therefore unfavourable for species that require interior habitat. The percentage preservation of contiguous habitats is closely related to both genetic and species biodiversity preservation. Generally a 10% remnant contiguous habitat will result in a 50% biodiversity loss.

Much of the remaining terrestrial wildlife habitat in many third world countries has experienced fragmentation through the development of urban expansion such as roads interfering with habitat loss. Aquatic species’ habitats have been fragmented by dams and water diversions. These fragments of habitat may not be large or connected enough to support species that need a large territory where they can find mates and food. The loss and fragmentation of habitats makes it difficult for migratory species to find places to rest and feed along their migration routes.

The effects of current fragmentation will continue to emerge for decades. Extinction debts are likely to come due, although the counteracting immigration debts may never fully be paid. Indeed, the experiments here reveal ongoing losses of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning two decades or longer after fragmentation occurred. Understanding the relationship between transient and long-term dynamics is a substantial challenge that ecologists must tackle, and fragmentation experiments will be central for relating observation to theory.

===Informed conservation===
Habitat fragmentation is often a cause of species becoming threatened or endangered. The existence of viable habitat is critical to the survival of any species, and in many cases, the fragmentation of any remaining habitat can lead to difficult decisions for conservation biologists. Given a limited amount of resources available for conservation is it preferable to protect the existing isolated patches of habitat or to buy back land to get the largest possible contiguous piece of land. In rare cases, a conservation reliant species may gain some measure of disease protection by being distributed in isolated habitats, and when controlled for overall habitat loss some studies have shown a positive relationship between species richness and fragmentation; this phenomenon has been called the habitat amount hypothesis, though the validity of this claim has been disputed. The ongoing debate of what size fragments are most relevant for conservation is often referred to as SLOSS (Single Large or Several Small). Habitat loss in a biodiversity hotspot can result in a localized extinction crisis, generally speaking habitat loss in a hotspot location can be a good indicator or predictor of the number of threatened and extinct endemic species.

One solution to the problem of habitat fragmentation is to link the fragments by preserving or planting corridors of native vegetation. In some cases, a bridge or underpass may be enough to join two fragments. This has the potential to mitigate the problem of isolation but not the loss of interior habitat. Wildlife corridors can help animals to move and occupy new areas when food sources or other natural resources are lacking in their core habitat, and animals can find new mates in neighbouring regions so that genetic diversity can increase. Species that relocate seasonally can do so more safely and effectively when it does not interfere with human development barriers.

Due to the continuous expansion of urban landscapes, current research is looking at green roofs being possible vectors of habitat corridors. A recent study has found that green roofs are beneficial in connecting the habitats of arthropods, specifically bees and weevils.

Another mitigation measure is the enlargement of small remnants to increase the amount of interior habitat. This may be impractical since developed land is often more expensive and could require significant time and effort to restore.

The best solution is generally dependent on the particular species or ecosystem that is being considered. More mobile species, like most birds, do not need connected habitat while some smaller animals, like rodents, may be more exposed to predation in open land. These questions generally fall under the headings of metapopulations island biogeography.

=== Genetic risks ===
As the remaining habitat patches are smaller, they tend to support smaller populations of fewer species. Small populations are at an increased risk of a variety of genetic consequences that influence their long-term survival. Remnant populations often contain only a subset of the genetic diversity found in the previously continuous habitat. In these cases, processes that act upon underlying genetic diversity, such as adaptation, have a smaller pool of fitness-maintaining alleles to survive in the face of environmental change. However, in some scenarios, where subsets of genetic diversity are partitioned among multiple habitat fragments, almost all original genetic diversity can be maintained despite each individual fragment displaying a reduced subset of diversity.

==== Gene Flow and Inbreeding ====
Gene flow occurs when individuals of the same species exchange genetic information through reproduction. Populations can maintain genetic diversity through migration. When a habitat becomes fragmented and reduced in area, gene flow and migration are typically reduced. Fewer individuals will migrate into the remaining fragments, and small disconnected populations that may have once been part of a single large population will become reproductively isolated. Scientific evidence that gene flow is reduced due to fragmentation depends on the study species. While trees that have long-range pollination and dispersal mechanisms may not experience reduced gene flow following fragmentation, most species are at risk of reduced gene flow following habitat fragmentation.

Reduced gene flow, and reproductive isolation can result in inbreeding between related individuals. Inbreeding does not always result in negative fitness consequences, but when inbreeding is associated with fitness reduction it is called inbreeding depression. Inbreeding becomes of increasing concern as the level of homozygosity increases, facilitating the expression of deleterious alleles that reduce the fitness. Habitat fragmentation can lead to inbreeding depression for many species due to reduced gene flow. Inbreeding depression is associated with conservation risks, like local extinction.

==== Genetic drift ====
Small populations are more susceptible to genetic drift. Genetic drift is random changes to the genetic makeup of populations and leads to reductions in genetic diversity. The smaller the population is, the more likely genetic drift will be a driving force of evolution rather than natural selection. Because genetic drift is a random process, it does not allow species to become more adapted to their environment. Habitat fragmentation is associated with increases to genetic drift in small populations which can have negative consequences for the genetic diversity of the populations. However, research suggests that some tree species may be resilient to the negative consequences of genetic drift until population size is as small as ten individuals or less.

===== Genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation for plant populations =====

Habitat fragmentation decreases the size and increases plant populations&#x27; spatial isolation. With genetic variation and increased methods of inter-population genetic divergence due to increased effects of random genetic drift, elevating inbreeding and reducing gene flow within plant species. While genetic variation may decrease with remnant population size, not all fragmentation events lead to genetic losses and different types of genetic variation. Rarely, fragmentation can also increase gene flow among remnant populations, breaking down local genetic structure.

==== Adaptation ====
In order for populations to evolve in response to natural selection, they must be large enough that natural selection is a stronger evolutionary force than genetic drift. Recent studies on the impacts of habitat fragmentation on adaptation in some plant species have suggested that organisms in fragmented landscapes may be able to adapt to fragmentation. However, there are also many cases where fragmentation reduces adaptation capacity because of small population size.

==== Examples of impacted species ====
Some species that have experienced genetic consequences due to habitat fragmentation are listed below: 
* &quot;Macquaria australasica&quot;
*&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;
*&quot;Betula nana&quot;
*&quot;Rhinella ornata&quot;
*&quot;Ochotona princeps&quot;
*&quot;Uta stansburiana&quot;
*&quot;Plestiodon skiltonianus&quot;
*&quot;Sceloporus occidentalis&quot;
*&quot;Chamaea fasciata&quot;

=== Effect on animal behaviours===
Although the way habitat fragmentation affects the genetics and extinction rates of species has been heavily studied, fragmentation has also been shown to affect species&#x27; behaviours and cultures as well. This is important because social interactions can determine and have an effect on a species&#x27; fitness and survival. Habitat fragmentation alters the resources available and the structure of habitats, as a result, alters the behaviours of species and the dynamics between differing species. Behaviours affected can be within a species such as reproduction, mating, foraging, species dispersal, communication and movement patterns or can be behaviours between species such as predator-prey relationships. In addition, when animals happen to venture into unknown areas in between fragmented forests or landscapes, they can supposedly come into contact with humans which puts them at a great risk and further decreases their chances of survival.

==== Predation behaviours ====
Habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities has been shown to greatly affect the predator-prey dynamics of many species by altering the number of species and the members of those species. This affects the natural predator-prey relationships between animals in a given community and forces them to alter their behaviours and interactions, therefore resetting the so-called &quot;behavioral space race&quot;. The way in which fragmentation changes and re-shapes these interactions can occur in many different forms. Most prey species have patches of land that are a refuge from their predators, allowing them the safety to reproduce and raise their young. Human introduced structures such as roads and pipelines alter these areas by facilitating predator activity in these refuges, increasing predator-prey overlap. The opposite could also occur in the favour of prey, increasing prey refuge and subsequently decreasing predation rates. Fragmentation may also increase predator abundance or predator efficiency and therefore increase predation rates in this manner. Several other factors can also increase or decrease the extent to which the shifting predator-prey dynamics affect certain species, including how diverse a predators diet is and how flexible habitat requirements are for predators and prey. Depending on which species are affected and these other factors, fragmentation and its effects on predator-prey dynamics may contribute to species extinction. In response to these new environmental pressures, new adaptive behaviours may be developed. Prey species may adapt to increased risk of predation with strategies such as altering mating tactics or changing behaviours and activities related to food and foraging.

===== Boreal woodland caribous =====
In the boreal woodland caribous of British Columbia, the effects of fragmentation are demonstrated. The species refuge area is peatland bog which has been interrupted by linear features such as roads and pipelines. These features have allowed their natural predators, the wolf, and the black bear to more efficiently travel over landscapes and between patches of land. Since their predators can more easily access the caribous&#x27; refuge, the females of the species attempt to avoid the area, affecting their reproductive behaviours and offspring produced.

==== Communication behaviours ====
Fragmentation affecting the communication behaviours of birds has been well studied in Dupont&#x27;s Lark. The Larks primarily reside in regions of Spain and are a small passerine bird which uses songs as a means of cultural transmission between members of the species. The Larks have two distinct vocalizations, the song, and the territorial call. The territorial call is used by males to defend and signal territory from other male Larks and is shared between neighbouring territories when males respond to a rivals song. Occasionally it is used as a threat signal to signify an impending attack on territory. A large song repertoire can enhance a male&#x27;s ability to survive and reproduce as he has a greater ability to defend his territory from other males, and a larger number of males in the species means a larger variety of songs being transmitted. Fragmentation of the Dupont&#x27;s Lark territory from agriculture, forestry and urbanization appears to have a large effect on their communication structures. Males only perceive territories of a certain distance to be rivals and so isolation of territory from others due to fragmentation leads to a decrease in territorial calls as the males no longer have any reason to use it or have any songs to match.

Humans have also brought on varying implications into ecosystems which in turn affect animal behaviour and responses generated. Although there are some species which are able to survive these kinds of harsh conditions, such as, cutting down wood in the forests for pulp and paper industries, there are animals which can survive this change but some that cannot. An example includes, varying aquatic insects are able to identify appropriate ponds to lay their eggs with the aid of polarized light to guide them, however, due to ecosystem modifications caused by humans they are led onto artificial structures which emit artificial light which are induced by dry asphalt dry roads for an example.

=== Effect on microorganisms ===
While habitat fragmentation is often associated with its effects on large plant and animal populations and biodiversity, due to the interconnectedness of ecosystems there are also significant effects that it has on the microbiota of an environment. Increased fragmentation has been linked to reduced populations and diversity of fungi responsible for decomposition, as well as the insects they are host to. This has been linked to simplified food webs in highly fragmented areas compared to old growth forests. Furthermore, edge effects have been shown to result in significantly varied microenvironments compared to interior forest due to variations in light availability, presence of wind, changes in precipitation, and overall moisture content of leaf litter. These microenvironments are often not conducive to overall forest health as they enable generalist species to thrive at the expense of specialists that depend on specific environments.

=== Effect on mutualistic and antagonistic relationships ===
A metadata analysis has found that habitat fragmentation greatly affects mutualistic relationships while affecting antagonistic relationships, such as predation and herbivory, to a less degree. For example, the mutualistic relationship between &quot;Mesogyne insignis&quot; and &quot;Megachile&quot;. A study has found greater pollination and increased fruit production of &quot;M. insignis&quot; in unfragmented forests verses fragmented forests. As for an example of an antagonistic relationship of nest predation, a study found that there is no increase in nest predation on fragmented forests - thus not supporting the edge effect hypothesis.

=== Effect on ecosystem services ===
Habitat fragmentation has profound effects on ecosystem services, impacting nutrient retention, species richness, and local biophysical conditions. Fragmentation-mediated processes cause generalizable responses at the population, community, and ecosystem levels, resulting in decreased nutrient retention. Furthermore, habitat fragmentation alters relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across multiple scales, affecting both the local loss of biodiversity and the local loss of function. Moreover, fragmentation can change the microclimate at both local and regional scales, influencing biodiversity through interactions with anthropogenic climate change. Overall, habitat fragmentation significantly disrupts ecosystem services by altering nutrient retention, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning at various spatial and temporal scales.

== Forest fragmentation ==
Forest fragmentation is a form of habitat fragmentation where forests are reduced (either naturally or man-made) to relatively small, isolated patches of forest known as forest fragments or forest remnants. The intervening matrix that separates the remaining woodland patches can be natural open areas, farmland, or developed areas. Following the principles of island biogeography, remnant woodlands act like islands of forest in a sea of pastures, fields, subdivisions, shopping malls, etc. These fragments will then begin to undergo the process of ecosystem decay.

Forest fragmentation also includes less subtle forms of discontinuities such as utility right-of-ways (ROWs). Utility ROWs are of ecological interest because they have become pervasive in many forest communities, spanning areas as large as 5 million acres in the United States. Utility ROWs include electricity transmission ROWs, gas pipeline and telecommunication ROWs. Electricity transmission ROWs are created to prevent vegetation interference with transmission lines. Some studies have shown that electricity transmission ROWs harbor more plant species than adjoining forest areas, due to alterations in the microclimate in and around the corridor. Discontinuities in forest areas associated with utility right-of-ways can serve as biodiversity havens for native bees and grassland species, as the right-of-ways are preserved in an early successional stage.

Forest fragmentation reduces food resources and habitat sources for animals thus splitting these species apart. Thus, making these animals become much more susceptible to effects of predation and making them less likely to perform interbreeding - lowering genetic diversity.

Additionally, forest fragmentation affects the native plant species present within the area by dividing large populations into smaller ones. In turn, smaller populations are more inclined to be affected by genetic drift and population performance, as well as experience increases in inbreeding activities. Moreover, fragmentation can affect the relationship present between animals and plants, such as the relationships regarding seed-dispersal or pollinator-plant relationship.

=== Implications ===
Forest fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity in forests, especially in the tropics. The problem of habitat destruction that caused the fragmentation in the first place is compounded by:
* the inability of individual forest fragments to support viable populations, especially of large vertebrates
* the local extinction of species that do not have at least one fragment capable of supporting a viable population
* edge effects that alter the conditions of the outer areas of the fragment, greatly reducing the amount of true forest interior habitat.

The effect of fragmentation on the flora and fauna of a forest patch depends on a) the size of the patch, and b) its degree of isolation. Isolation depends on the distance to the nearest similar patch, and the contrast with the surrounding areas. For example, if a cleared area is reforested or allowed to regenerate, the increasing structural diversity of the vegetation will lessen the isolation of the forest fragments. However, when formerly forested lands are converted permanently to pastures, agricultural fields, or human-inhabited developed areas, the remaining forest fragments, and the biota within them, are often highly isolated.

Forest patches that are smaller or more isolated will lose species faster than those that are larger or less isolated. A large number of small forest &quot;islands&quot; typically cannot support the same biodiversity that a single contiguous forest would hold, even if their combined area is much greater than the single forest. However, forest islands in rural landscapes greatly increase their biodiversity. In the Maulino forest of Chile fragmentation appear to not affect overall plant diversity much, and tree diversity is indeed higher in fragments than in large continuous forests.

McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada released a university based newspaper statement stating that 70% of the world&#x27;s remaining forest stands within one kilometre of a forest edge putting biodiversity at an immense risk based on research conducted by international scientists.

Reduced fragment area, increased isolation, and increased edge initiate changes that percolate through all ecosystems. Habitat fragmentation is able to formulate persistent outcomes which can also become unexpected such as an abundance of some species and the pattern that long temporal scales are required to discern many strong system responses.

=== Sustainable forest management ===

The presence of forest fragments influences the supply of various ecosystems in adjacent agricultural fields (Mitchell et al. 2014). Mitchell et al. (2014), researched on six varying ecosystem factors such as crop production, decomposition, pesticide regulation, carbon storage, soil fertility, and water quality regulation in soybean fields through separate distances by nearby forest fragments which all varied in isolation and size across an agricultural landscape in Quebec, Canada. Sustainable forest management can be achieved in several ways including by managing forests for ecosystem services (beyond simple provisioning), through government compensation schemes, and through effective regulation and legal frameworks. The only realistic method of conserving forests is to apply and practice sustainable forest management to risk further loss.

There is a high industrial demand for wood, pulp, paper, and other resources which the forest can provide with, thus businesses which will want more access to the cutting of forests to gain those resources. The rainforest alliance has efficiently been able to put into place an approach to sustainable forest management, and they established this in the late 1980s. Their conservation was deemed successful as it has saved over nearly half a billion acres of land around the world.

A few approaches and measures which can be taken in order to conserve forests are methods by which erosion can be minimized, waste is properly disposed, conserve native tree species to maintain genetic diversity, and setting aside forestland (provides habitat for critical wildlife species). Additionally, forest fires can also occur frequently and measures can also be taken to further prevent forest fires from occurring. For example, in Guatemala’s culturally and ecologically significant Petén region, researchers were able to find over a 20-year period, actively managed FSC-certified forests experienced substantially lower rates of deforestation than nearby protected areas, and forest fires only affected 0.1 percent of certified land area, compared to 10.4 percent of protected areas. However, it must be duly noted that short term decisions regarding forest sector employment and harvest practices can have long-term effects on biodiversity. Planted forests become increasingly important as they supply approximately a quarter of global industrial roundwood production and are predicted to account for 50% of global output within two decades (Brown, 1998; Jaakko Poyry, 1999). Although there have been many difficulties, the implementation of forest certification has been quite prominent in being able to raise effective awareness and disseminating knowledge on a holistic concept, embracing economic, environmental and social issues, worldwide. While also providing a tool for a range of other applications than assessment of sustainability, such as e.g. verifying carbon sinks.

== Approaches to understanding habitat fragmentation ==
Two approaches are typically used to understand habitat fragmentation and its ecological impacts.

=== Species-oriented approach ===
The species-oriented approach focuses specifically on individual species and how they each respond to their environment and habitat changes with in it. This approach can be limited because it does only focus on individual species and does not allow for a broad view of the impacts of habitat fragmentation across species.

==== Pattern-oriented approach ====
The pattern-oriented approach is based on land cover and its patterning in correlation with species occurrences. One model of study for landscape patterning is the patch-matrix-corridor model developed by Richard Forman The pattern-oriented approach focuses on land cover defined by human means and activities. This model has stemmed from island biogeography and tries to infer causal relationships between the defined landscapes and the occurrence of species or groups of species within them. The approach has limitations in its collective assumptions across species or landscapes which may not account for variations amongst them.

==== Variegation model ====
The other model is the variegation model. Variegated landscapes retain much of their natural vegetation but are intermixed with gradients of modified habitat This model of habitat fragmentation typically applies to landscapes that are modified by agriculture. In contrast to the fragmentation model that is denoted by isolated patches of habitat surrounded by unsuitable landscape environments, the variegation model applies to landscapes modified by agriculture where small patches of habitat remain near the remnant original habitat. In between these patches are a matrix of grassland that is often modified versions of the original habitat. These areas do not present as much of a barrier to native species.

<text>The bamboo lemurs or gentle lemurs are the lemurs in genus Hapalemur. These medium-sized primates live exclusively on Madagascar.

==Etymology==
Bamboo lemurs were first described by French zoologist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1851. Comparing their small size, proportions, speckled fur, and other traits to those of marmosets—then classified in the genus &quot;Hapale&quot;—he named the genus &quot;Hapalemur&quot;. &quot;Hapale&quot; derives from the Greek word ἁπαλός (&quot;hapalos&quot;), meaning &quot;gentle&quot;.

In their discussion of lemur name etymologies, Dunkel &quot;et al.&quot; speculated that the once popular vernacular name for the genus, &quot;gentle lemur&quot;, derived from the translation of &quot;Hapalemur&quot;, despite their notoriety for being one of the most aggressive lemurs in captivity—an observation first noted in a letter by Dutch naturalist François Pollen published in 1895. More recently, the common name &quot;bamboo lemur&quot; first appeared in the mid- to late-1980s following the rediscovery of the greater bamboo lemur (&quot;Hapalemur simus&quot;). However, the name became more generally used a year or two later following the discovery of the golden bamboo lemur (&quot;Hapalemur aureus&quot;) in 1987. For a few years, both names or combinations of both were widely used, but &quot;bamboo lemur&quot; became the preferred name in 1994 with the publication of the first edition of &quot;Lemurs of Madagascar&quot;. The term &quot;gentle lemur&quot; has seen little use in both popular and academic literature since the early 2000s.

== Description ==
The bamboo lemurs are characterized by a grey-brown fur, which varies by species. Their muzzles are short and their ears are round and hairy. Lengths vary from , with tails just as long or longer, and they weigh up to .

Bamboo lemurs prefer damp forests where bamboo grows. Although they can be active any time of the day, they are often active just after dawn. Though primarily arboreal, they sometimes come down to the ground. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur or &quot;bandro&quot; (&quot;Hapalemur alaotrensis&quot;), which lives in the reed beds of Lac Alaotra, spends much of its time in water and can swim well, unlike other lemur species, which only venture to water to drink.

The lesser gentle lemurs live together in groups of three to five animals, which probably represent families composed of a male, one or two females, and their offspring. They communicate with a variety of sounds.

Gestation lasts 135 to 150 days and ends between September and January, when the female bears one to two young. These are weaned after about four months (if the food supply is ample) and are fully mature at two years of age. Their life expectancy is up to 12 years.

== Cyanide consumption ==
Not all bamboo contain cyanide, but &quot;H. aureus&quot; selects the growing tips of &quot;Cephalostachyum viguieri&quot;, which contain 15 mg of cyanide per . Other bamboo lemurs have been found to consume less cyanogenetic forms of bamboo, such as mature shoots of &quot;C. viguieri&quot; or the leaves of &quot;Cephalostachyum perrieri&quot;. How certain bamboo lemurs can detoxify the high amounts of cyanide in their diets is unknown.

== Classification ==
As of 2010, the classification of bamboo lemurs lists five species and three subspecies. The greater bamboo lemur was removed from this genus in 2001 to &quot;Prolemur&quot; but was restored in 2016.

* Genus &quot;Hapalemur&quot;
** Eastern lesser bamboo lemur, &quot;H. griseus&quot; 
*** Eastern lesser bamboo lemur, &quot;H. g. griseus&quot;
*** Gilbert&#x27;s bamboo lemur, &quot;H. g. gilberti&quot;
*** Ranomafana bamboo lemur, &quot;H. g. ranomafanensis&quot;
** Southern lesser bamboo lemur, &quot;H. meridionalis&quot;
** Western lesser bamboo lemur, &quot;H. occidentalis&quot;
** Lac Alaotra bamboo lemur, &quot;H. alaotrensis&quot;
** Golden bamboo lemur, &quot;H. aureus&quot;
** Greater bamboo lemur, &quot;H. simus&quot;

<text>David Richard Gress (born 29 January 1953) is a Danish historian, known for his 1998 survey &quot;From Plato to Nato&quot; on Western identity and grand narratives.

==Life==
He was born in Copenhagen, the son of R. W. B. Lewis, an American literary historian, and the Danish writer, playwright and essayist Elsa Gress. The two were not married, which is why Gress uses his mother&#x27;s maiden name. She subsequently married the American painter Charles Clifford Wright.

He attended Sorø Akademis Skole. He was later educated in Classics at Cambridge University, England, and Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, where he received his Ph.D. in medieval history in 1981. From 1982 to 1992 he was a fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, publishing articles and books on international strategy, the West German peace movement, U.S. foreign policy, Nordic politics, and a history of West Germany. From 1993 to 1995 he was visiting fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and lecturer in international history there. From 1996 to 1999 he was a fellow at the Danish Institute of International Affairs and from 1999 to 2001 assistant professor of Classics at the University of Aarhus, Denmark. In 2001-03 he was professor of the history of civilizations at Boston University and has since 2003 been based in Denmark, where he continues to publish articles and books in political philosophy, the origins of Western prosperity, contemporary history and political culture. He is a well-known face in the public debate of Denmark.
He has been a fellow of the Danish Institute of International Affairs and director of the Center for Studies on America and the West at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, Philadelphia. he has been a columnist in the Danish daily newspaper &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot;. David Gress is also a frequently used media commentator, and a senior fellow of the Danish think tank CEPOS.

==Work==
In his first book, &#x27;Demokrati eller?&#x27; Gress provided a justification of liberal democracy. It included a defense of ecological production, something that Gress has since disavowed. His doctoral dissertation was a critical edition of a 13th-century papal biography. &#x27;Peace and Survival&#x27; was a philosophical and political history and critique of the pacifist mentality, with particular reference to the West German peace movement, which in his view was surrendering to Soviet power. Apart from various shorter works on Nordic politics and U.S. foreign policy, his next major work followed on from &#x27;Peace and Survival&#x27; to provide a political, social, and economic history of the Federal Republic of Germany. The first edition appeared in the fall of 1989, a French edition in 1992 and a second in English in 1993; these included a survey of the unification of Germany and a look back at the history of East Germany. 

&quot;From Plato to Nato&quot; was, amongst other things, an intervention in the campus culture wars, explaining that the narrative model of &#x27;The West&#x27;, in the general style of Will Durant, had become threadbare. His proposed replacement marked him as, in general terms, a Burkean conservative. He argued that &#x27;The West&#x27; was in operative terms much more of a complex compound of elements he identified as &#x27;Old West&#x27;, of Roman and Germanic provenance, with modern Adam Smith economics, than a pure play on the Enlightenment philosophy. The book&#x27;s development is complex and somewhat muddied by the wish also to be inclusive of other conservative views. Norman Davies, a Polish history specialist critical of incoherent definitions of Europe viewed from the Atlantic end, has lent some support to the outline thesis. 

Gress has further identified the campus debates as a target, with an attack on Martin Bernal and other interventions in U.S. and British journals of opinion. 

From 2003 to 2012 he published mostly in Danish, including two books and numerous articles, reviews, and comments in Danish daily newspapers, chiefly &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot;, but from 2009 also &quot;Politiken&quot;. One, more polemical, focus has been criticism of the Nordic welfare state and environmental policy, another has been periodic surveys of international publications and research on U.S. politics and society, history, and religion. He has been one of the most outspoken Danish opponents of the scientific consensus on climate change, and has accordingly received heavy criticism by Danish scientists.

<text>The German invasion of Greece or Operation Marita (), were the attacks on Greece by Italy and Germany during World War II. The Italian invasion in October 1940, which is usually known as the Greco-Italian War, was followed by the German invasion in April 1941. German landings on the island of Crete (May 1941) came after Allied forces had been defeated in mainland Greece. These battles were part of the greater Balkans Campaign of the Axis powers and their associates.

Following the Italian invasion on 28 October 1940, Greece, with British air and material support, repelled the initial Italian attack and a counter-attack in March 1941. When the German invasion, known as Operation Marita, began on 6 April, the bulk of the Greek Army was on the Greek border with Albania, then a vassal of Italy, from which the Italian troops had attacked. German troops invaded from Bulgaria, creating a second front. Greece received a small reinforcement from British, Australian and New Zealand forces in anticipation of the German attack. The Greek army found itself outnumbered in its effort to defend against both Italian and German troops. As a result, the Metaxas defensive line did not receive adequate troop reinforcements and was quickly overrun by the Germans, who then outflanked the Greek forces at the Albanian border, forcing their surrender. British, Australian and New Zealand forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat, with the ultimate goal of evacuation. For several days, Allied troops played an important part in containing the German advance on the Thermopylae position, allowing ships to be prepared to evacuate the units defending Greece. The German Army reached the capital, Athens, on 27 April and Greece&#x27;s southern shore on 30 April, capturing 7,000 British, Australian and New Zealand personnel and ending the battle with a decisive victory. The conquest of Greece was completed with the capture of Crete a month later. Following its fall, Greece was occupied by the military forces of Germany, Italy and Bulgaria.

Hitler later blamed the failure of his invasion of the Soviet Union on Mussolini&#x27;s failed conquest of Greece. Andreas Hillgruber has accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame for his country&#x27;s defeat from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasises, from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.

==History==

===Greco-Italian War===
At the outbreak of World War II, Ioannis Metaxas—the fascist-style dictator of Greece and former general—sought to maintain a position of neutrality. Greece was subject to increasing pressure from Italy, culminating in the Italian submarine &quot;Delfino&quot; sinking the cruiser &quot;Elli&quot; on 15 August 1940. Italian leader Benito Mussolini was irritated that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler had not consulted him on his war policy and wished to establish his independence. He hoped to match German military success by taking Greece, which he regarded as an easy opponent. On 15 October 1940, Mussolini and his closest advisers finalised their decision. In the early hours of 28 October, Italian Ambassador Emanuele Grazzi presented Metaxas with a three-hour ultimatum, demanding free passage for troops to occupy unspecified &quot;strategic sites&quot; within Greek territory. Metaxas rejected the ultimatum (the refusal is commemorated as Greek national holiday Ohi Day) but even before it expired, Italian troops had invaded Greece through Albania. The principal Italian thrust was directed toward Epirus. Hostilities with the Greek army began at the Battle of Elaia–Kalamas, where they failed to break the defensive line and were forced to halt. Within three weeks, the Greek army launched a counter-offensive, during which it marched into Albanian territory, capturing significant cities such as Korça and Sarandë. Neither a change in Italian command nor the arrival of substantial reinforcements improved the position of the Italian army. On 13 February, General Papagos, the Commander-in-Chief of the Greek army, opened a new offensive, aiming to take Tepelenë and the port of Vlorë with British air support but the Greek divisions encountered stiff resistance, stalling the offensive that practically destroyed the Cretan 5th Division.

After weeks of inconclusive winter warfare, the Italians launched a counter-offensive on the centre of the front on 9 March 1941, which failed, despite the Italians&#x27; superior forces. After one week and 12,000 casualties, Mussolini called off the counter-offensive and left Albania twelve days later.

Modern analysts believe that the Italian campaign failed because Mussolini and his generals initially allocated insufficient resources to the campaign (an expeditionary force of 55,000 men), failed to reckon with the autumn weather, attacked without the advantage of surprise and without Bulgarian support. Elementary precautions such as issuing winter clothing had not been taken. Mussolini had not considered the warnings of the Italian Commission of War Production, that Italy would not be able to sustain a full year of continuous warfare until 1949.

During the six-month fight against Italy, the Hellenic army made territorial gains by eliminating Italian salients. Greece did not have a substantial armaments industry and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in North Africa. To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, because Greek forces could not protect Greece&#x27;s entire border. The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania, regardless of the risk of a German attack from the Bulgarian border.
===Hitler&#x27;s decision to attack and British aid to Greece===

The United Kingdom was obliged to assist Greece by the Declaration of 13 April 1939, which stated that in the event of a threat to Greek or Romanian independence, &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Greek or Romanian Government... all the support in their power.&quot; The first British effort was the deployment of Royal Air Force (RAF) squadrons commanded by Air Commodore John D&#x27;Albiac that arrived in November 1940. With Greek government consent, British forces were dispatched to Crete on 31 October to guard Souda Bay, enabling the Greek government to redeploy the 5th Cretan Division to the mainland.

Hitler decided to intervene on 4 November 1940, four days after British troops arrived at Crete and Lemnos. Although Greece was neutral until the Italian invasion, the British troops that were sent as defensive aid created the possibility of a frontier to the German southern flank. Hitler&#x27;s principal fear was that British aircraft based in Greece would bomb the Romanian oil fields, which was one of Germany&#x27;s most important sources of oil. As Hitler was already seriously considering launching an invasion of the Soviet Union the next year, this increased the importance of Romanian oil as once Germany was at war with the Soviet Union, Romania would be the &quot;Reich&quot;&#x27;s only source of oil, at least until the Wehrmacht presumably captured the Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus. As the British were indeed contemplating using the Greek air fields to bomb the Romanian oil fields, Hitler&#x27;s fears that his entire war machine might be paralyzed for a lack of oil should the Ploești oil fields be destroyed were to a certain extent grounded in reality. However, the American historian Gerhard Weinberg noted: &quot;...the enormous difficulties of air attacks on distant oil fields were not understood by either side at this time; it was assumed on both sides that even small air raids could bring about vast fire and destruction&quot;. Furthermore, the massive Italian defeats in the Balkans, the Horn of Africa and North Africa had pushed the Fascist regime in Italy to the brink of collapse by late 1940 with Mussolini becoming extremely unpopular with the Italian people. Hitler was convinced that if he did not rescue Mussolini, Fascist Italy would be knocked out of the war in 1941. Weinberg wrote the continuing Italian defeats &quot;...could easily lead to the complete collapse of the whole system Mussolini had established, and this was recognized at the time; it is not hindsight from 1943&quot;. If Italy was knocked out of the war, then the British would be able to use the central Mediterranean again, and the governors of the French colonies in Africa loyal to the Vichy regime might switch their loyalties to the French National Committee headed by Charles de Gaulle. As Hitler had plans to ultimately use the French colonies in Africa as bases for the war against the United Kingdom, the potential loss of Vichy control over its African empire was seen as a problem by him.

Furthermore, after Italy entered the war in June 1940, the danger of Axis air and naval attacks had largely closed the central Mediterranean to British shipping except for convoys to Malta, in effect closing the Suez canal as the British were forced to supply their forces in Egypt via the long Cape route around Africa. The British had made liberating Italian East Africa a priority to end the possibility of Italian naval and air attacks on British shipping in the Red Sea, which assumed greater importance because of the dangers posed to British shipping in the central Mediterranean. In turn, the decision by Field Marshal Archibald Wavell to deploy significant forces to the Horn of Africa while defending Egypt lessened the number of Commonwealth forces available to go to Greece. Although the performance of the Italian armed forces had been less than impressive, from the German perspective denying the British access to the central Mediterranean by stationing Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine forces in Italy made it crucial to keep Italy in the war. Hitler ordered his Army General Staff to attack Northern Greece from bases in Romania and Bulgaria in support of his master plan to deprive the British of Mediterranean bases.

On 12 November, the German Armed Forces High Command issued Directive No. 18, in which they scheduled simultaneous operations against Gibraltar and Greece for the following January. On 17 November 1940, Metaxas proposed a joint offensive in the Balkans to the British government, with Greek strongholds in southern Albania as the operational base. The British were reluctant to discuss Metaxas&#x27; proposal, because the troops necessary for implementing the Greek plan would seriously endanger operations in North Africa. In December 1940, German ambitions in the Mediterranean underwent considerable revision when Spain&#x27;s General Francisco Franco rejected the Gibraltar attack. Consequently, Germany&#x27;s offensive in southern Europe was restricted to the Greek campaign. The Armed Forces High Command issued Directive No. 20 on 13 December 1940, outlining the Greek campaign under the code designation Operation Marita. The plan was to occupy the northern coast of the Aegean Sea by March 1941 and to seize the entire Greek mainland, if necessary. To attack Greece would require going through Yugoslavia and/or Bulgaria. The Regent of Yugoslavia for the boy king Peter II, Prince Paul was married to a Greek princess and refused the German request for transit rights to invade Greece. King Boris III of Bulgaria had long-standing territorial disputes with Greece, and was more open to granting transit rights to the Wehrmacht in exchange for a promise to have the parts of Greece that he coveted. In January 1941, Bulgaria granted the transit rights to the Wehrmacht.

During a meeting of British and Greek military and political leaders in Athens on 13 January 1941, General Alexandros Papagos, Commander-in-Chief of the Hellenic Army, asked the United Kingdom for nine fully equipped divisions and corresponding air support. The British responded that all they could offer was the immediate dispatch of a token force of less than divisional strength. This offer was rejected by the Greeks, who feared that the arrival of such a contingent would precipitate a German attack without giving them meaningful assistance. British help would be requested if and when German troops crossed the Danube from Romania into Bulgaria. The Greek leader, General Metaxas, did not particularly want British forces on the mainland of Greece as he feared it would lead to a German invasion of his country and during the winter of 1940–41 secretly asked Hitler if he was willing to mediate an end to the Italo-Greek war. The British prime minister, Winston Churchill, strongly supported by the chief of the Imperial General Staff, Sir John Dill, and the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, had hopes of reviving the Salonika front strategy and opening a second front in the Balkans that would tie down German forces and deprive Germany of the Romanian oil. The Australian prime minister, Robert Menzies, arrived in London on 20 February to discuss the deployment of Australian troops from Egypt to Greece, and reluctantly gave his approval on 25 February. Like many other Australians of his generation, Menzies was haunted by the memory of the Battle of Gallipoli, and was highly suspicious of another of Churchill&#x27;s plans for victory in the Mediterranean. On 9 March, New Zealand&#x27;s prime minister, Peter Fraser, likewise gave his approval to redeploy the New Zealand division from Egypt to Greece, despite his fears of another Gallipoli. As he put it in a telegram to Churchill, he &quot;could not contemplate the possibility of abandoning the Greeks to their fate&quot; which &quot;would destroy the moral basis of our cause&quot;. The weather in the winter of 1940–41 seriously delayed the build-up of German forces in Romania and it was only in February 1941 that the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Twelfth Army commanded by Field Marshal Wilhelm List joined by the Luftwaffe&#x27;s &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII crossed the Danube river into Bulgaria. The lack of bridges on the Danube capable of carrying heavy supplies on the Romanian-Bulgarian frontier forced Wehrmacht engineers to build the necessary bridges in wintertime, imposing major delays. By 9 March 1941, the 5th and 11th Panzer Divisions were concentrated on the Bulgarian–Turkish border to deter Turkey, Greece&#x27;s Balkan Pact ally from intervening.

Under heavy German diplomatic pressure, Prince Paul had Yugoslavia join the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941, but with a proviso that Yugoslavia would not grant transit rights to the Wehrmacht to attack Greece. As the Metaxas Line protected the Greek–Bulgarian border, the Wehrmacht generals much preferred the idea of attacking Greece via Yugoslavia instead of Bulgaria. During a hasty meeting of Hitler&#x27;s staff after the unexpected 27 March Yugoslav coup d&#x27;état against the Yugoslav government, orders for the campaign in Yugoslavia were drafted, as well as changes to the plans for Greece. The coup d&#x27;état in Belgrade greatly assisted German planning as it allowed the Wehrmacht to plan an invasion of Greece via Yugoslavia. The American historians Allan Millett and Williamson Murray wrote from the Greek perspective, it would have had been better if the Yugoslav coup d&#x27;état had not taken place as it would have forced the Wehrmacht to assault the Metaxas Line without the option of outflanking the Metaxas Line by going through Yugoslavia. On 6 April, both Greece and Yugoslavia were to be attacked.

===British Expeditionary Force===

Little more than a month later, the British reconsidered. Winston Churchill aspired to reestablish a Balkan Front comprising Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey, and instructed Anthony Eden and Sir John Dill to resume negotiations with the Greek government. A meeting attended by Eden and the Greek leadership, including King George II, Prime Minister Alexandros Koryzis—the successor of Metaxas, who had died on 29 January 1941—and Papagos took place in Athens on 22 February, where it was decided to send an expeditionary force of British and other Commonwealth forces. German troops had been massing in Romania and on 1 March, &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; forces began to move into Bulgaria. At the same time, the Bulgarian Army mobilised and took up positions along the Greek frontier.

On 2 March, Operation Lustre—the transportation of troops and equipment to Greece—began and 26 troopships arrived at the port of Piraeus. On 3 April, during a meeting of British, Yugoslav and Greek military representatives, the Yugoslavs promised to block the Struma valley in case of a German attack across their territory. During this meeting, Papagos stressed the importance of a joint Greco-Yugoslavian offensive against the Italians, as soon as the Germans launched their offensive. By 24 April more than 62,000 Empire troops (British, Australians, New Zealanders, Palestine Pioneer Corps, Cypriots etc.), had arrived in Greece, comprising the 6th Australian Division, the New Zealand 2nd Division and the British 1st Armoured Brigade. The three formations later became known as &#x27;W&#x27; Force, after their commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. Air Commodore Sir John D&#x27;Albiac commanded British air forces in Greece.

==Prelude==

===Topography===
To enter Northern Greece, the German army had to cross the Rhodope Mountains, which offered few river valleys or mountain passes capable of accommodating the movement of large military units. Two invasion courses were located west of Kyustendil; another was along the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border, via the Struma river valley to the south. Greek border fortifications had been adapted for the terrain and a formidable defence system covered the few available roads. The Struma and Nestos rivers cut across the mountain range along the Greek-Bulgarian frontier and both of their valleys were protected by strong fortifications, as part of the larger Metaxas Line. This system of concrete pillboxes and field fortifications, constructed along the Bulgarian border in the late 1930s, was built on principles similar to those of the Maginot Line. Its strength resided mainly in the inaccessibility of the intermediate terrain leading up to the defence positions.

===Strategy===
Greece&#x27;s mountainous terrain favored a defensive strategy, while the high ranges of the Rhodope, Epirus, Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities. Air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many defiles. Although an invading force from Albania could be stopped by a relatively small number of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country was difficult to defend against an attack from the north.

Following a March conference in Athens, the British believed that they would combine with Greek forces to occupy the Haliacmon Line—a short front facing north-eastwards along the Vermio Mountains and the lower Haliacmon river. Papagos awaited clarification from the Yugoslav government and later proposed to hold the Metaxas Line—by then a symbol of national security to the Greek populace—and not withdraw divisions from Albania. He argued that to do so would be seen as a concession to the Italians. The strategically important port of Thessaloniki lay practically undefended and transportation of British troops to the city remained dangerous. Papagos proposed to take advantage of the area&#x27;s terrain and prepare fortifications, while also protecting Thessaloniki.

General Dill described Papagos&#x27; attitude as &quot;unaccommodating and defeatist&quot; and argued that his plan ignored the fact that Greek troops and artillery were capable of only token resistance. The British believed that the Greek rivalry with Bulgaria—the Metaxas Line was designed specifically for war with Bulgaria—as well as their traditionally good terms with the Yugoslavs—left their north-western border largely undefended. Despite their awareness that the line was likely to collapse in the event of a German thrust from the Struma and Axios rivers, the British eventually acceded to the Greek command. On 4 March, Dill accepted the plans for the Metaxas line and on 7 March agreement was ratified by the British Cabinet. The overall command was to be retained by Papagos and the Greek and British commands agreed to fight a delaying action in the north-east. The British did not move their troops, because General Wilson regarded them as too weak to protect such a broad front. Instead, he took a position some west of the Axios, across the Haliacmon Line. The two main objectives in establishing this position were to maintain contact with the Hellenic army in Albania and to deny German access to Central Greece. This had the advantage of requiring a smaller force than other options, while allowing more preparation time, but it meant abandoning nearly the whole of Northern Greece, which was unacceptable to the Greeks for political and psychological reasons. The line&#x27;s left flank was susceptible to flanking from Germans operating through the Monastir Gap in Yugoslavia. The rapid disintegration of the Yugoslav Army and a German thrust into the rear of the Vermion position was not expected.

The German strategy was based on using so-called &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; methods that had proved successful during the invasions of Western Europe. Their effectiveness was confirmed during the invasion of Yugoslavia. The German command again coupled ground troops and armour with air support and rapidly drove into the territory. Once Thessaloniki was captured, Athens and the port of Piraeus became principal targets. Piraeus, was virtually destroyed by bombing on the night of the 6/7 April. The loss of Piraeus and the Isthmus of Corinth would fatally compromise withdrawal and evacuation of British and Greek forces.

===Defence and attack forces===
The Fifth Yugoslav Army took responsibility for the south-eastern border between Kriva Palanka and the Greek border. The Yugoslav troops were not fully mobilised and lacked adequate equipment and weapons. Following the entry of German forces into Bulgaria, the majority of Greek troops were evacuated from Western Thrace. By this time, Greek forces defending the Bulgarian border totalled roughly 70,000 men (sometimes labelled the &quot;Greek Second Army&quot; in English and German sources, although no such formation existed). The remainder of the Greek forces—14 divisions (often erroneously referred to as the &quot;Greek First Army&quot; by foreign sources)—was committed in Albania.

On 28 March, the Greek Central Macedonia Army Section—comprising the 12th and 20th Infantry Divisions—were put under the command of General Wilson, who established his headquarters to the north-west of Larissa. The New Zealand division took position north of Mount Olympus, while the Australian division blocked the Haliacmon valley up to the Vermion range. The RAF continued to operate from airfields in Central and Southern Greece, but few planes could be diverted to the theatre. The British forces were near to fully motorised, but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to Greece&#x27;s steep mountain roads. They were short of tanks and anti-aircraft guns and the lines of communication across the Mediterranean were vulnerable, because each convoy had to pass close to Axis-held islands in the Aegean; despite the British Royal Navy&#x27;s domination of the Aegean Sea. These logistical problems were aggravated by the limited availability of shipping and Greek port capacity.

The German Twelfth Army—under the command of Field Marshal Wilhelm List—was charged with the execution of Operation Marita. His army was composed of six units:
* First Panzer Group, under the command of General Ewald von Kleist.
* XL Panzer Corps, under Lieutenant General Georg Stumme.
* XVIII Mountain Corps, under Lieutenant General Franz Böhme.
* XXX Infantry Corps, under Lieutenant General Otto Hartmann.
* L Infantry Corps, under Lieutenant General Georg Lindemann.
* 16th Panzer Division, deployed behind the Turkish-Bulgarian border to support the Bulgarian forces in case of a Turkish attack.

===German plan of attack and assembly===
The German plan of attack was influenced by their army&#x27;s experiences during the Battle of France. Their strategy was to create a diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Hellenic Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armoured wedges through the weakest links of the defence chain, penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance. Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus, possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.

The Yugoslav &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; led to a sudden change in the plan of attack and confronted the Twelfth Army with a number of difficult problems. According to the 28 March Directive No. 25, the Twelfth Army was to create a mobile task force to attack via Niš toward Belgrade. With only nine days left before their final deployment, every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops took time to mobilise. By the evening of 5 April, the forces intended to enter southern Yugoslavia and Greece had been assembled.

==German invasion==

===Thrust across southern Yugoslavia and the drive to Thessaloniki===
At dawn on 6 April, the German armies invaded Greece, while the Luftwaffe began an intensive bombardment of Belgrade. The XL Panzer Corps began their assault at 05:30. They pushed across the Bulgarian frontier into Yugoslavia at two separate points. By the evening of 8 April, the 73rd Infantry Division captured Prilep, severing an important rail line between Belgrade and Thessaloniki and isolating Yugoslavia from its allies. On the evening of 9 April, Stumme deployed his forces north of Monastir, in preparation for attack toward Florina. This position threatened to encircle the Greeks in Albania and W Force in the area of Florina, Edessa and Katerini. While weak security detachments covered his rear against a surprise attack from central Yugoslavia, elements of the 9th Panzer Division drove westward to link up with the Italians at the Albanian border.

The 2nd Panzer Division (XVIII Mountain Corps) entered Yugoslavia from the east on the morning of 6 April and advanced westward through the Strumica Valley. It encountered little resistance, but was delayed by road clearance demolitions, mines and mud. Nevertheless, the division was able to reach the day&#x27;s objective, the town of Strumica. On 7 April, a Yugoslav counter-attack against the division&#x27;s northern flank was repelled, and the following day, the division forced its way across the mountains and overran the thinly manned defensive line of the Greek 19th Mechanised Division south of Doiran Lake. Despite many delays along the mountain roads, an armoured advance guard dispatched toward Thessaloniki succeeded in entering the city by the morning of 9 April. Thessaloniki was taken after a long battle with three Greek divisions under the command of General Bakopoulos, and was followed by the surrender of the Greek Eastern Macedonia Army Section, taking effect at 13:00 on 10 April. In the three days it took the Germans to reach Thessaloniki and breach the Metaxas Line, some 60,000 Greek soldiers were taken prisoner.

===Greek-Yugoslav counteroffensive===
In early April 1941, Greek, Yugoslav and British commanders met to set in motion a counteroffensive, that planned to completely destroy the Italian army in Albania in time to counter the German invasion and allow the bulk of the Greek army to take up new positions and protect the border with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. On 7 April, the Yugoslav 3rd Army in the form of five infantry divisions (13th &quot;Hercegovacka&quot;, 15th &quot;Zetska&quot;, 25th &quot;Vardarska&quot;, 31st &quot;Kosovska&quot; and 12th &quot;Jadranska&quot; Divisions, with the &quot;Jadranska&quot; acting as the reserve), after a false start due to the planting of a bogus order, launched a counteroffensive in northern Albania, advancing from Debar, Prisren and Podgorica towards Elbasan. On 8 April, the Yugoslav vanguard, the &quot;Komski&quot; Cavalry Regiment crossed the treacherous Accursed Mountains and captured the village of Koljegcava in the Valbonë River Valley, and the 31st &quot;Kosovska&quot; Division, supported by Savoia-Marchetti S.79K bombers from the 7th Bomber Regiment of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (VVKJ), broke through the Italian positions in the Drin River Valley. The &quot;Vardarska&quot; Division, due to the fall of Skopje was forced to halt its operations in Albania. In the meantime, the Western Macedonia Army Section under General Tsolakoglou, comprising the 9th and 13th Greek Divisions, advanced in support of the Royal Yugoslav Army, capturing some 250 Italians on 8 April. The Greeks were tasked with advancing towards Durrës. On 9 April, the Zetska Division advanced towards Shkodër and the Yugoslav cavalry regiment reached the Drin River, but the Kosovska Division had to halt its advance due to the appearance of German units near Prizren. The Yugoslav-Greek offensive was supported by S.79K bombers from the 66th and 81st Bomber Groups of the VVKJ, that attacked airfields and camps around Shkodër, as well as the port of Durrës, and Italian troop concentrations and bridges on the Drin and Buene rivers and Durrës, Tirana and Zara.

Between 11 and 13 April 1941, with German and Italian troops advancing on its rear areas, the Zetska Division was forced to retreat back to the Pronisat River by the Italian 131st Armored Division &quot;Centauro&quot;, where it remained until the end of the campaign on 16 April. The Italian armoured division along with the 18th Infantry Division &quot;Messina&quot; then advanced upon the Yugoslav fleet base of Kotor in Montenegro, also occupying Cettinje and Podgorica. The Yugoslavs lost 30,000 men captured in the Italian counterattacks.

===Metaxas Line===
The Metaxas Line was defended by the Eastern Macedonia Army Section, led by Lieutenant General Konstantinos Bakopoulos) and comprising the 7th, 14th and 18th Infantry divisions. The line ran for about along the river Nestos to the east and then further east, following the Bulgarian border as far as Mount Beles near the Yugoslav border. The fortifications were designed to garrison over 200,000 troops but there were only about 70,000 and the infantry garrison was thinly spread. Some 950 men under the command of Major Georgios Douratsos of the 14th Division defended Fort Roupel.

The Germans had to break the Metaxas line, in order to capture Thessaloniki, Greece&#x27;s second-largest city and a strategically important port. The attack started on 6 April with one infantry unit and two divisions of the XVIII Mountain Corps. Due to strong resistance, the first day of the attack yielded little progress in breaking the line. A German report at the end of the first day described how the German 5th Mountain Division &quot;was repulsed in the Rupel Pass despite strongest air support and sustained considerable casualties&quot;. Two German battalions managed to get within of Fort Rupel on 6 April, but were practically destroyed. Of the 24 forts that made up the Metaxas Line, only two had fallen and only after they had been destroyed. In the following days, the Germans pummelled the forts with artillery and dive bombers and reinforced the 125th Infantry Regiment. Finally, a high snow-covered mountainous passage considered inaccessible by the Greeks was crossed by the 6th Mountain Division, which reached the rail line to Thessaloniki on the evening of 7 April.

The 5th Mountain Division, together with the reinforced 125th Infantry Regiment, crossed the Struma river under great hardship, attacking along both banks and clearing bunkers until they reached their objective on 7 April. Heavy casualties caused them to temporarily withdraw. The 72nd Infantry Division advanced from Nevrokop across the mountains. Its advance was delayed by a shortage of pack animals, medium artillery and mountain equipment. Only on the evening of 9 April did it reach the area north-east of Serres. Most fortresses—like Fort Roupel, Echinos, Arpalouki, Paliouriones, Perithori, Karadag, Lisse and Istibey—held until the Germans occupied Thessaloniki on 9 April, at which point they surrendered under General Bakopoulos&#x27; orders. Nevertheless, minor isolated fortresses continued to fight for a few days more and were not taken until heavy artillery was used against them. This gave time for some retreating troops to evacuate by sea. Although eventually broken, the defenders of the Metaxas Line succeeded in delaying the German advance.

===Capitulation of the Greek army in Macedonia===
The XXX Infantry Corps on the left wing reached its designated objective on the evening of 8 April, when the 164th Infantry Division captured Xanthi. The 50th Infantry Division advanced far beyond Komotini towards the Nestos river. Both divisions arrived the next day. On 9 April, the Greek forces defending the Metaxas Line capitulated unconditionally following the collapse of Greek resistance east of the Axios river. In a 9 April estimate of the situation, Field Marshal List commented that as a result of the swift advance of the mobile units, his 12th Army was now in a favourable position to access central Greece by breaking the Greek build-up behind the Axios river. On the basis of this estimate, List requested the transfer of the 5th Panzer Division from First Panzer Group to the XL Panzer Corps. He reasoned that its presence would give additional punch to the German thrust through the Monastir Gap. For the continuation of the campaign, he formed an eastern group under the command of XVIII Mountain Corps and a western group led by XL Panzer Corps.

===Breakthrough to Kozani===

By the morning of 10 April, the XL Panzer Corps had finished its preparations for the continuation of the offensive and advanced in the direction of Kozani. The 5th Panzer Division, advancing from Skopje encountered a Greek division tasked with defending Monastir Gap, rapidly defeating the defenders. First contact with Allied troops was made north of Vevi at 11:00 on 10 April. German SS troops seized Vevi on 11 April, but were stopped at the Klidi Pass just south of town. During the next day, the SS regiment reconnoitered the Allied positions and at dusk launched a frontal attack against the pass. Following heavy fighting, the Germans broke through the defence. By the morning of 14 April, the spearheads of the 9th Panzer Division reached Kozani.

===Olympus and Servia passes===
Wilson faced the prospect of being pinned by Germans operating from Thessaloniki, while being flanked by the German XL Panzer Corps descending through the Monastir Gap. On 13 April, he withdrew all British forces to the Haliacmon river and then to the narrow pass at Thermopylae. On 14 April, the 9th Panzer Division established a bridgehead across the Haliacmon river, but an attempt to advance beyond this point was stopped by intense Allied fire. This defence had three main components: the Platamon tunnel area between Olympus and the sea, the Olympus pass itself and the Servia pass to the south-east. By channelling the attack through these three defiles, the new line offered far greater defensive strength. The defences of the Olympus and Servia passes consisted of the 4th New Zealand Brigade, 5th New Zealand Brigade and the 16th Australian Brigade. For the next three days, the advance of the 9th Panzer Division was stalled in front of these resolutely held positions.

A ruined castle dominated the ridge across which the coastal pass led to Platamon. During the night of 15 April, a German motorcycle battalion supported by a tank battalion attacked the ridge, but the Germans were repulsed by the New Zealand 21st Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Neil Macky, which suffered heavy losses in the process. Later that day, a German armoured regiment arrived and struck the coastal and inland flanks of the battalion, but the New Zealanders held. After being reinforced during the night of the 15th–16th, the Germans assembled a tank battalion, an infantry battalion and a motorcycle battalion. The infantry attacked the New Zealanders&#x27; left company at dawn, while the tanks attacked along the coast several hours later. The New Zealanders soon found themselves enveloped on both sides, after the failure of the Western Macedonia Army to defend the Albanian town of Korça that fell unopposed to the Italian 9th Army on 15 April, forcing the British to abandon the Mount Olympus position and resulting in the capture of 20,000 Greek troops.
The New Zealand battalion withdrew, crossing the Pineios river; by dusk, they had reached the western exit of the Pineios Gorge, suffering only light casualties. Macky was informed that it was &quot;essential to deny the gorge to the enemy until 19 April even if it meant extinction&quot;. He sank a crossing barge at the western end of the gorge once all his men were across and set up defences. The 21st Battalion was reinforced by the Australian 2/2nd Battalion and later by the 2/3rd. This force became known as &quot;Allen force&quot; after Brigadier &quot;Tubby&quot; Allen. The 2/5th and 2/11th battalions moved to the Elatia area south-west of the gorge and were ordered to hold the western exit possibly for three or four days.

On 16 April, Wilson met Papagos at Lamia and informed him of his decision to withdraw to Thermopylae. Lieutenant-General Thomas Blamey divided responsibility between generals Mackay and Freyberg during the leapfrogging move to Thermopylae. Mackay&#x27;s force was assigned the flanks of the New Zealand Division as far south as an east–west line through Larissa and to oversee the withdrawal through Domokos to Thermopylae of the Savige and Zarkos Forces and finally of Lee Force; Brigadier Harold Charrington&#x27;s 1st Armoured Brigade was to cover the withdrawal of Savige Force to Larissa and thereafter the withdrawal of the 6th Division under whose command it would come; overseeing the withdrawal of Allen Force which was to move along the same route as the New Zealand Division. The British, Australian and New Zealand forces remained under attack throughout the withdrawal.

On the morning of 18 April, the Battle of Tempe Gorge, the struggle for the Pineios Gorge, was over when German armoured infantry crossed the river on floats and 6th Mountain Division troops worked their way around the New Zealand battalion, which was subsequently dispersed. On 19 April, the first XVIII Mountain Corps troops entered Larissa and took possession of the airfield, where the British had left their supply dump intact. The seizure of ten truckloads of rations and fuel enabled the spearhead units to continue without ceasing. The port of Volos, at which the British had re-embarked numerous units during the prior few days, fell on 21 April; there, the Germans captured large quantities of valuable diesel and crude oil.

===Withdrawal and surrender of the Greek Epirus Army===

As the invading Germans advanced deep into Greek territory, the Epirus Army Section of the Greek army operating in Albania was reluctant to retreat. By the middle of March, especially after the Tepelene offensive, the Greek army had suffered, according to British estimates, 5,000 casualties, and it was fast approaching the end of its logistical tether.

General Wilson described this unwillingness to retreat as &quot;the fetishistic doctrine that not a yard of ground should be yielded to the Italians.&quot; Churchill also criticized the Greek Army commanders for ignoring British advice to abandon Albania and avoid encirclement. Lieutenant-General Georg Stumme&#x27;s XL Corps captured the Florina-Vevi Pass on 11 April, but unseasonal snowy weather then halted his advance. On 12 April, he resumed the advance, but spent the whole day fighting Brigadier Charrington&#x27;s 1st Armoured Brigade at Proastion. It was not until 13 April that the first Greek elements began to withdraw toward the Pindus mountains. The Allies&#x27; retreat to Thermopylae uncovered a route across the Pindus mountains by which the Germans might flank the Hellenic army in a rearguard action. An elite SS formation—the &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; brigade—was assigned the mission of cutting off the Greek Epirus Army&#x27;s line of retreat from Albania by driving westward to the Metsovon pass and from there to Ioannina. On 13 April, attack aircraft from 21, 23 and 33 Squadrons from the Hellenic Air Force (RHAF), attacked Italian positions in Albania. That same day, heavy fighting took place at Kleisoura pass, where the Greek 20th Division covering the Greek withdrawal, fought in a determined manner, delaying Stumme&#x27;s advance practically a whole day. The withdrawal extended across the entire Albanian front, with the Italians in hesitant pursuit. On 15 April, Regia Aeronautica fighters attacked the (RHAF) base at Paramythia, south of Greece&#x27;s border with Albania, destroying or putting out of action 17 VVKJ aircraft that had recently arrived from Yugoslavia.

General Papagos rushed Greek units to the Metsovon pass where the Germans were expected to attack. On 14 April a pitched battle between several Greek units and the LSSAH brigade—which had by then reached Grevena—erupted. The Greek 13th and Cavalry Divisions lacked the equipment necessary to fight against an armoured unit, and on 15 April were finally encircled and overwhelmed. On 18 April, General Wilson in a meeting with Papagos, informed him that the British and Commonwealth forces at Thermopylai would carry on fighting till the first week of May, providing that Greek forces from Albania could redeploy and cover the left flank. On 21 April, the Germans advanced further and captured Ioannina, the final supply route of the Greek Epirus Army. Allied newspapers dubbed the Hellenic army&#x27;s fate a modern-day Greek tragedy. Historian and former war-correspondent Christopher Buckley – when describing the fate of the Hellenic army – stated that &quot;one experience[d] a genuine Aristotelian catharsis, an awe-inspiring sense of the futility of all human effort and all human courage.&quot;

On 20 April, the commander of Greek forces in Albania—Lieutenant General Georgios Tsolakoglou—accepted the hopelessness of the situation and offered to surrender his army, which then consisted of fourteen divisions. Papagos condemned Tsolakoglou&#x27;s decision to capitulate, although lieutenant general Ioannis Pitsikas and major general Georgios Bakos had warned him a week earlier that morale in the Epirus Army was wearing thin, and combat stress and exhaustion had resulted in officers taking the decision to put deserters before firing squads. Historian John Keegan writes that Tsolakoglou &quot;was so determined... to deny the Italians the satisfaction of a victory they had not earned that... he opened [a] quite unauthorised parley with the commander of the German SS division opposite him, Sepp Dietrich, to arrange a surrender to the Germans alone.&quot; On strict orders from Hitler, negotiations were kept secret from the Italians and the surrender was accepted. Outraged by this decision, Mussolini ordered counter-attacks against the Greek forces, which were repulsed, but at some cost to the defenders. The Luftwaffe intervened in the renewed fighting, and Ioannina was practically destroyed by Stukas. It took a personal representation from Mussolini to Hitler to organize Italian participation in the armistice that was concluded on 23 April. Greek soldiers were not rounded up as prisoners of war and were allowed instead to go home after the demobilisation of their units, while their officers were permitted to retain their side arms.

===Thermopylae position===
As early as 16 April, the German command realised that the British were evacuating troops on ships at Volos and Piraeus. The campaign then took on the character of a pursuit. For the Germans, it was now primarily a question of maintaining contact with the retreating British forces and foiling their evacuation plans. German infantry divisions were withdrawn due to their limited mobility. The 2nd and 5th Panzer Divisions, the 1st SS Motorised Infantry Regiment and both mountain divisions launched a pursuit of the Allied forces.

To allow an evacuation of the main body of British forces, Wilson had ordered the rearguard to make a last stand at the historic Thermopylae pass, the gateway to Athens. General Freyberg&#x27;s 2nd New Zealand Division was given the task of defending the coastal pass, while Mackay&#x27;s 6th Australian Division was to hold the village of Brallos. After the battle Mackay was quoted as saying &quot;I did not dream of evacuation; I thought that we&#x27;d hang on for about a fortnight and be beaten by weight of numbers.&quot; When the order to retreat was received on the morning of 23 April, it was decided that the two positions were to be held by one brigade each. These brigades, the 19th Australian and 6th New Zealand were to hold the passes as long as possible, allowing the other units to withdraw. The Germans attacked at 11:30 on 24 April, but met fierce resistance, lost 15 tanks and sustained considerable casualties. The Allies held out the entire day; with the delaying action accomplished, they retreated in the direction of the evacuation beaches and set up another rearguard at Thebes. The Panzer units launching a pursuit along the road leading across the pass made slow progress because of the steep gradient and difficult hairpin bends.

===German drive on Athens===

After abandoning the Thermopylae area, the British rearguard withdrew to an improvised switch position to the south of Thebes, where they erected a last obstacle in front of Athens. The motorcycle battalion of the 2nd Panzer Division, which had crossed to the island of Euboea to seize the port of Chalcis and had subsequently returned to the mainland, was given the mission of outflanking the British rearguard. The motorcycle troops encountered only slight resistance and on the morning of 27 April 1941, the first Germans entered Athens, followed by armoured cars, tanks and infantry. They captured intact large quantities of petroleum, oil and lubricants (&quot;POL&quot;), several thousand tons of ammunition, ten trucks loaded with sugar and ten truckloads of other rations in addition to various other equipment, weapons and medical supplies. The people of Athens had been expecting the Germans for several days and confined themselves to their homes with their windows shut. The previous night, Athens Radio had made the following announcement:

The Germans drove straight to the Acropolis and raised the Nazi flag. According to the most popular account of the events, the Evzone soldier on guard duty, Konstantinos Koukidis, took down the Greek flag, refusing to hand it to the invaders, wrapped himself in it, and jumped off the Acropolis. Whether the story was true or not, many Greeks believed it and viewed the soldier as a martyr.

===Evacuation of Empire forces===
General Archibald Wavell, the commander of British Army forces in the Middle East, when in Greece from 11 to 13 April had warned Wilson that he must expect no reinforcements and had authorised Major General Freddie de Guingand to discuss evacuation plans with certain responsible officers. Nevertheless, the British could not at this stage adopt or even mention this course of action; the suggestion had to come from the Greek Government. The following day, Papagos made the first move when he suggested to Wilson that W Force be withdrawn. Wilson informed Middle East Headquarters and on 17 April, Rear-Admiral Baillie-Grohman was sent to Greece to prepare for the evacuation. That day Wilson hastened to Athens where he attended a conference with the King, Papagos, d&#x27;Albiac and Rear admiral Charles Edward Turle. In the evening, after telling the King that he felt he had failed him in the task entrusted to him, Prime Minister Koryzis committed suicide. On 21 April, the final decision to evacuate Empire forces to Crete and Egypt was taken and Wavell – in confirmation of verbal instructions – sent his written orders to Wilson.
5,200 men, mostly from the 5th New Zealand Brigade, were evacuated on the night of 24 April, from Porto Rafti of East Attica, while the 4th New Zealand Brigade remained to block the narrow road to Athens, dubbed the &quot;24 Hour Pass&quot; by the New Zealanders. On 25 April (Anzac Day), the few RAF squadrons left Greece (D&#x27;Albiac established his headquarters in Heraklion, Crete) and some 10,200 Australian troops evacuated from Nafplio and Megara. 2,000 more men had to wait until 27 April, because Ulster Prince ran aground in shallow waters close to Nafplio. Because of this event, the Germans realised that the evacuation was also taking place from the ports of the eastern Peloponnese.

On 25 April the Germans staged an airborne operation to seize the bridges over the Corinth Canal, with the double aim of cutting off the British line of retreat and securing their own way across the isthmus. The attack met with initial success, until a stray British shell destroyed the bridge. The 1st SS Motorised Infantry Regiment (named LSSAH), assembled at Ioannina, thrust along the western foothills of the Pindus Mountains via Arta to Missolonghi and crossed over to the Peloponnese at Patras in an effort to gain access to the isthmus from the west. Upon their arrival at 17:30 on 27 April, the SS forces learned that the paratroops had already been relieved by Army units advancing from Athens.

The Dutch troop ship was part of a convoy evacuating about 3,000 British, Australian and New Zealand troops from Nafplio in the Peloponnese. As the convoy headed south in the Argolic Gulf on the morning of 27 April, it was attacked by a &quot;Staffel&quot; of nine Junkers Ju 87s of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77, damaging &quot;Slamat&quot; and setting her on fire. The destroyer rescued about 600 survivors and came to her aid, but as the two destroyers headed for Souda Bay in Crete another Ju 87 attack sank them both. The total number of deaths from the three sinkings was almost 1,000. Only 27 crew from &quot;Wryneck&quot;, 20 crew from &quot;Diamond&quot;, 11 crew and eight evacuated soldiers from &quot;Slamat&quot; survived.

The erection of a temporary bridge across the Corinth canal permitted 5th Panzer Division units to pursue the Allied forces across the Peloponnese. Driving via Argos to Kalamata, from where most Allied units had already begun to evacuate, they reached the south coast on 29 April, where they were joined by SS troops arriving from Pyrgos. The fighting on the Peloponnese consisted of small-scale engagements with isolated groups of British troops who had been unable to reach the evacuation point. The attack came days too late to cut off the bulk of the British troops in Central Greece, but isolated the Australian 16th and 17th Brigades.

By 30 April the evacuation of about 50,000 soldiers was completed, but was heavily contested by the German Luftwaffe, which sank at least 26 troop-laden ships. The Germans captured around 8,000 Empire (including 2,000 Cypriot and Palestinian) and Yugoslav troops in Kalamata who had not been evacuated, while liberating many Italian prisoners from POW camps. The Greek Navy and Merchant Marine played an important part in the evacuation of the Allied forces to Crete and suffered heavy losses as a result. Churchill wrote:

==Aftermath==

===Triple occupation===
On 13 April 1941, Hitler issued Directive No. 27, including his occupation policy for Greece. He finalized jurisdiction in the Balkans with Directive No. 31 issued on 9 June. Mainland Greece was divided between Germany, Italy and Bulgaria, with Italy occupying the bulk of the country (see map opposite). German forces occupied the strategically more important areas of Athens, Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia and several Aegean islands, including most of Crete. They also occupied Florina, which was claimed by both Italy and Bulgaria. The Bulgarians occupied territory between the Struma river and a line of demarcation running through Alexandroupoli and Svilengrad west of the Evros River. Italian troops started occupying the Ionian and Aegean islands on 28 April. On 2 June, they occupied the Peloponnese; on 8 June, Thessaly; and on 12 June, most of Attica. The occupation of Greece – during which civilians suffered terrible hardships, many dying from privation and hunger – proved to be a difficult and costly task. Several resistance groups launched guerrilla attacks against the occupying forces and set up espionage networks.

===Battle of Crete===

On 25 April 1941, King George II and his government left the Greek mainland for Crete, which was attacked by Nazi forces on 20 May 1941. The Germans employed parachute forces in a massive airborne invasion and attacked the three main airfields of the island in Maleme, Rethymno and Heraklion. After seven days of fighting and tough resistance, Allied commanders decided that the cause was hopeless and ordered a withdrawal from Sfakia. During the night of 24 May, George II and his government were evacuated from Crete to Egypt. By 1 June 1941, the evacuation was complete and the island was under German occupation. In light of the heavy casualties suffered by the elite 7th &quot;Fliegerdivision&quot;, Hitler forbade further large-scale airborne operations. General Kurt Student would dub Crete &quot;the graveyard of the German paratroopers&quot; and a &quot;disastrous victory.&quot;

==Assessments==
The Greek campaign ended with a complete German and Italian victory. The British did not have the military resources to carry out large simultaneous operations in both North Africa and the Balkans. Even if they had been able to block the Axis advance, they would have been unable to exploit the situation by a counter-thrust across the Balkans. The British came very near to holding Crete and perhaps other islands that would have provided air support for naval operations throughout the eastern Mediterranean.

In enumerating the reasons for the complete Axis victory in Greece, the following factors were of greatest significance:
* German superiority in ground forces and equipment;
* The bulk of the Greek army was occupied fighting the Italians on the Albanian front.
* German air supremacy combined with the inability of the Greeks to provide the RAF with adequate airfields;
* Inadequacy of British expeditionary forces, since the force available was small;
* Poor condition of the Hellenic Army and its shortages of modern equipment;
* Inadequate port, road and railway facilities;
* Absence of a unified command and lack of cooperation between the British, Greek and Yugoslav forces;
* Turkey&#x27;s strict neutrality; and
* The early collapse of Yugoslav resistance.

===Criticism of British actions===
After the Allies&#x27; defeat, the decision to send British forces into Greece faced fierce criticism in the United Kingdom. Field Marshal Alan Brooke, (who became Chief of the Imperial General Staff in December 1941), considered intervention in Greece to be &quot;a definite strategic blunder&quot;, as it denied Wavell the necessary reserves to complete the conquest of Italian Libya, or to withstand Rommel&#x27;s &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; March offensive. It prolonged the North African campaign, which might have been concluded during 1941.

In 1947, de Guingand asked the British government to recognise its mistaken strategy in Greece. Buckley countered that if the United Kingdom had not honoured its 1939 commitment to Greece, it would have severely damaged the ethical basis of its struggle against Nazi Germany. According to Heinz Richter, Churchill tried through the campaign in Greece to influence the political atmosphere in the United States and insisted on this strategy even after the defeat. According to Keegan, &quot;the Greek campaign had been an old-fashioned gentlemen&#x27;s war, with honor given and accepted by brave adversaries on each side&quot; and the vastly outnumbered Greek and Allied forces, &quot;had, rightly, the sensation of having fought the good fight&quot;. It has also been suggested the British strategy was to create a barrier in Greece to protect Turkey, the only (neutral) country standing between the Axis bloc in the Balkans and the oil-rich Middle East. Martin van Creveld believes that the British government did everything in their power to scuttle all attempts at a separate peace between the Greeks and the Italians, in order to ensure the Greeks would keep fighting and thus draw Italian divisions away from North Africa.

Freyberg and Blamey also had serious doubts about the feasibility of the operation but failed to express their reservations and apprehensions. The campaign caused a furore in Australia, when it became known that when General Blamey received his first warning of the move to Greece on 18 February 1941, he was worried but had not informed the Australian Government. He had been told by Wavell that Prime Minister Menzies had approved the plan. The proposal had been accepted by a meeting of the War Cabinet in London at which Menzies was present but the Australian Prime Minister had been told by Churchill that both Freyberg and Blamey approved of the expedition. On 5 March, in a letter to Menzies, Blamey said that &quot;the plan is, of course, what I feared: piecemeal dispatch to Europe&quot; and the next day he called the operation &quot;most hazardous&quot;. Thinking that he was agreeable, the Australian Government had already committed the Australian Imperial Force to the Greek Campaign.

===Impact on Operation Barbarossa===
In 1942, members of the British Parliament characterised the campaign in Greece as a &quot;political and sentimental decision&quot;. Eden rejected the criticism and argued that the UK&#x27;s decision was unanimous and asserted that the Battle of Greece delayed Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. This is an argument that historians used to assert that Greek resistance was a turning point in World War II. According to film-maker and friend of Adolf Hitler Leni Riefenstahl, Hitler said that &quot;if the Italians hadn&#x27;t attacked Greece and needed our help, the war would have taken a different course. We could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow. There would have been no Stalingrad&quot;. Despite his reservations, Field Marshall Brooke seems also to have conceded that the Balkan Campaign delayed the offensive against the Soviet Union.

Bradley and Buell conclude that &quot;although no single segment of the Balkan campaign forced the Germans to delay Barbarossa, obviously the entire campaign did prompt them to wait.&quot; On the other hand, Richter calls Eden&#x27;s arguments a &quot;falsification of history&quot;. Basil Liddell Hart and de Guingand point out that the delay of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union was not among the United Kingdom strategic goals and as a result the possibility of such a delay could not have affected its decisions about Operation Marita. In 1952, the Historical Branch of the UK Cabinet Office concluded that the Balkan Campaign had no influence on the launching of Operation Barbarossa. According to Robert Kirchubel, &quot;the main causes for deferring Barbarossa&#x27;s start from 15 May to 22 June were incomplete logistical arrangements and an unusually wet winter that kept rivers at full flood until late spring.&quot; This does not answer whether in the absence of these problems the campaign could have begun according to the original plan. Keegan writes:
Antony Beevor wrote in 2012 about the current thinking of historians with regard to delays caused by German attacks in the Balkans that &quot;most accept that it made little difference&quot; to the eventual outcome of Barbarossa. US Army analyst Richard Hooker Jr., calculates that the 22 June start date of Barbarossa was sufficient for the Germans to advance to Moscow by mid-August, and he says that the victories in the Balkans raised the morale of the German soldier. Historian David Glantz wrote that the German invasion of the Balkans &quot;helped conceal Barbarossa&quot; from the Soviet leadership, and contributed to the German success in achieving strategic surprise and that while the Balkans operations contributed to delays in launching Barbarossa, these acted to discredit Soviet intelligence reports which accurately predicted the initially planned invasion date. Jack P. Greene agrees that &quot;other factors were more important&quot; as regards the delaying of Barbarossa, but he also argues that the Panzer divisions, which had been in service during Operation Marita, &quot;had to undergo refit&quot;.

==Notes==

 Nevertheless, Hitler had given Mussolini the green light to attack Greece six months earlier, acknowledging Mussolini&#x27;s right to do as he saw fit in his acknowledged sphere of influence.

<doc id="1259257" wikidata="Q15643588" url="?curid=1259257" title="Taiwan Provincial Government">
<text>Taiwan Provincial Government is the nominal government of Taiwan Province in the Republic of China. Since 2018, its functions have been transferred to the National Development Council and other ministries of the Executive Yuan.

== History ==

At the end of World War II, Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945. The Nationalist government started the process to takeover Taiwan on behalf of the Allies. The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office was established by the Executive Yuan in Chungking on September 1, 1945. The office moved to Taipei on October 25, 1945. After the February 28 incident in 1947, the Executive Yuan decided to restructure the Provincial Administrative Office as a provincial government. On May 16, 1947, the Taiwan Provincial Government was established.

As the Republic of China progressively lost control of mainland China to Communist Party forces in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the national government relocated to Taiwan in late 1949. However, Taiwan continued to be governed by a provincial government even though from 1955 it was one of only two provincial governments still functioning (the other being Fujian province, controlling some islands off the mainland coast). The remainder of Fujian province still under Republic of China control was placed under military administration in 1956, and its provincial government was downsized and relocated to Taiwan island. This left Taiwan province as the only fully functioning provincial government. From 1967, a number of major cities in Taiwan were elevated to special municipalities directly controlled by the national government, and moved outside the jurisdiction of Taiwan province.

During the constitutional reform initiated in 1996, the ROC authorities decided to downsize the provincial structure due to the reasons that to solve the problem of overlapping personnel and administrative resources between the provincial and central governments, and cut excessive public spending. The provinces were streamlined and ceased to be self-governing bodies in December 1998, with their administrative functions transferred to the National Development Council and other ministries of the Executive Yuan as well as second-tier local governments such as counties. However, the position of the Chairman of the Provincial Government and Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council are retained to comply with the Constitution.

In July 2018, all provincial governmental organs were formally abolished, with budget and personnel removed.

== Historical government buildings ==
Historically, before the provincial government&#x27;s duties and functions were handed to the Executive Yuan in July 2018, the provincial government was located in Taipei from 1947 to 1956, and in Zhongxing New Village from 1957 to July 2018.

== Governor of Taiwan ==
===Official titles of the governor===
===List of governors===
All governors of Taiwan Province are codified in Chapter XI, Article 113, Section 2 of the constitution.

<doc id="1259273" wikidata="Q640403" url="?curid=1259273" title="LazyTown">
<text>LazyTown () is an Icelandic children&#x27;s educational musical television series created by aerobics champion Magnús Scheving. Originally produced in English, it has been broadcast in dozens of languages globally. Designed to encourage healthy lifestyles, the series was based on Scheving&#x27;s stage play &quot;Áfram Latibær!&quot;, itself adapted from a book that Scheving wrote in 1995.

The series was commissioned by Nickelodeon in early 2003, following the production of two stage plays and a test pilot. Originally performed in English, it was later dubbed into thirty languages and broadcast in over 180 countries. It combines live action, puppetry and computer animation, making it one of the most expensive children&#x27;s shows, with the cost per episode being over five times that of the average children’s show.

The first two seasons, consisting of fifty-two episodes, were produced from 2004 to 2007. &quot;LazyTown&quot; originally aired on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nick Jr. block in the United States and the United Kingdom and RÚV in Iceland. In 2011, Turner Broadcasting System Europe acquired LazyTown Entertainment and commissioned the third and fourth seasons. Consisting of twenty-six episodes, they premiered in 2013 on Turner&#x27;s Cartoonito and later on Viacom&#x27;s Channel 5, for a total of seventy-eight episodes and four seasons.

Multiple spin-offs were created, including stage productions and &quot;LazyTown Extra&quot;, a short-form series for younger children.

==Plot==
The series follows Stephanie, a pink shy but sassy 8-year-old girl who moves to LazyTown to live with her uncle, Mayor Meanswell, and is surprised to learn that its residents lead inactive lifestyles. With help from the hero Sportacus, she helps teach them how to be more active and lead healthy lifestyles. They are opposed by Robbie Rotten, who prefers to lead a sluggish life and devises schemes to make LazyTown lazy. However, his plans, which, ironically, involve him becoming physically active, are never foolproof and always end in failure.

Each of the children that Stephanie befriends embodies negative traits. Ziggy has an unbalanced diet devoid of fruits and vegetables, Pixel is reclusive and spends too much time on his computer, Stingy is self-centered and possessive, and Trixie is a troublemaker with little respect for rules and other people. As the series progresses, the characters become less lazy in favor of a healthier lifestyle.

The program features a predominantly Eurodance soundtrack. Each episode features at least one original song and concludes with a performance of &quot;Bing Bang (Time to Dance)&quot;, sung by Stephanie. Many tracks are reworked versions of songs from the basis for Icelandic plays.

==Characters==

===Humans===
* Sportacus 10, , (portrayed by Magnús Scheving), is the hero of LazyTown and the main male protagonist, who has a rivalry with Robbie Rotten and is dedicated to exercise and healthy eating. He lives in a futuristic airship above LazyTown and is alerted to people who need help when the crystal on the chest of his costume glows. He is empowered by fruits and vegetables, which he calls &quot;sports candy,&quot; but loses his powers after eating junk food, which can only be restored by eating healthy food. In the third season, he gains new equipment, including a backpack that is integrated into his outfit and contains food and sports equipment. His crystal also flashes red when his energy is low.
* Stephanie, , (portrayed by Shelby Young in the unaired pilot, Julianna Rose Mauriello in seasons 1–2 and Chloe Lang in seasons 3–4), is an energetic and kind, but shy and sassy, 8-year-old girl and aspiring dancer and the main female protagonist. Upon moving to LazyTown to live with Mayor Meanswell, she is surprised by Ziggy, Pixel, Stingy and Trixie&#x27;s laziness and tries to convince them to try healthier activities while dealing with Robbie Rotten&#x27;s schemes.
* Robbie Rotten, (portrayed by Stefán Karl Stefánsson), is the main antagonist of the series, who devises schemes to keep the citizens of LazyTown lazy and discourage their active lifestyles. He despises Sportacus, and several of his schemes involve trying to get rid of him. Ironically, he puts so much effort into his schemes that he is one of LazyTown&#x27;s most active citizens.

===Puppets===
* Ziggy, , (puppeteered by Guðmundur Þór Kárason in the US and Lorraine Parsloe in the UK), is a 7-year-old boy who loves candy and sweets. He is naive and idolizes Sportacus.
* Pixel, , (puppeteered by Ronald Binion/Julie Westwood and voiced by Noel MacNeal/Kobie Powell/Chris Knowings/Ronald Binion in the US and Joanna Ruiz in the UK), is a 9-year-old boy, who is passionate about technology and inventing. He is reclusive and antisocial, repairing gadgets to avoid exercising and often spending time on his computer or playing video games. He has a crush on Stephanie and often struggles to talk to her. His house often serves as a meeting spot for the kids, as it is spacious and has a television. He represents reclusiveness and technology addiction. 
* Stingy, , (puppeteered by Jodi Eichelberger in the US and Sarah Burgess/Julie Westwood in the UK), is a 7-year-old boy who is selfish and possessive, but cares for his friends. He has a piggy bank who he calls Piggy and considers his best friend, and his father is supposedly the richest man in town. He represents possessiveness and a self-centered attitude.
* Trixie, , (puppeteered by Amanda Maddock/Sarah Burgess/Heather Asch/Aymee Garcia and voiced by Sarah Burgess/Heather Asch/Aymee Garcia in the US and Joanna Ruiz in the UK), is an 8-year-old girl who is fun-loving and often causes trouble. She represents impatience and a lack of respect for rules.
* Mayor Milford Meanswell, , (puppeteered by David Matthew Feldman), is Stephanie&#x27;s uncle and the mayor of LazyTown, who has a crush on Bessie. He is old-fashioned and often confused by modern technology.
* Miss Bessie Busybody, , (puppeteered by Julie Westwood), is the town PR agent and Mayor Meanswell&#x27;s secretary. Though pompous and sassy, she is fashionable, aware of trends, and tries to be motherly with the kids. She is often so engrossed with talking on her cellphone that she is oblivious to what is going on around her.

===Other===
* Jives Junkfood, , is a tall and thin teenage boy who lives alone in his house. Though he only appears in the Icelandic plays, his home appears in the series and he is seen on cards and books.
* The rooster, , is a symbol of LazyTown, appearing on the town seal and on the papers in Meanswell&#x27;s filing cabinets. In the second play, the rooster was an anthropomorphic character who acted as a narrator.
* Bean appears in Sprout&#x27;s &quot;LazyTown&quot; spin-off block &quot;The Super Sproutlet Show&quot;, who shows viewers how to plant fruits and vegetables and make healthy meals. She rides on a bike with a greenhouse on the back.

==Episodes==
Fifty-two episodes were produced for the first two seasons of &quot;LazyTown&quot; between 2004 until 2007, with a further 26 produced bettween 2013 until 2014.

==History and production==
&quot;LazyTown&quot; began as a storybook published in 1995 titled &quot;Áfram Latibær!&quot; (&quot;Go Go LazyTown!&quot;). A second book, &quot;Latibær á Ólympíuleikunum&quot; (&quot;LazyTown at the Olympics&quot;), was published in 1996. Later in 1996, a stage adaptation of the first book was shown in Iceland. It featured Stephanie as an out-of-shape dancer and Sportacus as an energetic elf. The puppet characters seen in the television series also appeared in human form, but Robbie Rotten did not yet exist. A third book, &quot;Latibær í Vandræðum&quot; (&quot;LazyTown in Trouble&quot;), was published in 1997. This book introduced Robbie Rotten to the franchise. A second stage show based on the third book titled &quot;Glanni Glæpur í Latabæ&quot; (&quot;Robbie Rotten in LazyTown&quot;) debuted in 1999. It introduced Stefán Karl Stefánsson as Robbie Rotten and featured more finalized versions of the other characters. Nickelodeon Australia reported that by the time the second play finished touring, &quot;LazyTown&quot; had become a household name in Iceland. A variety of tie-in products and media were created in the country before Scheving decided to develop &quot;LazyTown&quot; into a television program; these included bottled water, toy figures, and a radio station. Development on the TV series began in 2000, following the success of the second play. Production on the TV series began in 2002, and in 2003, the pilot was pitched to Nickelodeon. A deal was subsequently made with the network.

In most episodes, the only characters played by live actors are Stephanie, Sportacus, and Robbie Rotten. The rest of the characters are depicted as puppets, made by the Neal Scanlan Studio and Wit Puppets. The show was filmed and produced at 380 Studios, a purpose-built studio near Reykjavík equipped with high-end HDTV production facilities and one of the largest green screens in the world. The production floor area is 1,800 square meters. The budget for each episode was approximately ISK 70,000,000 (US$1 million), about five times the average cost for a children&#x27;s television program at the time, making it &quot;the most expensive children&#x27;s show in the world&quot; according to Scheving.

Its virtual sets were generated with an Unreal Engine 3-based framework, created by Raymond P. Le Gué and known as XRGen4. According to Le Gué, &quot;We start with the live actors and puppets on a physical set with a green screen behind them as a backdrop. The green screen is replaced in real time with the sets created in XRGen4 using UE3. As we move the camera and actors around the physical set, the backdrop scene also moves in real time in complete synchronization with the movements of the real camera. All of this is recorded, and the director can watch the resulting composition in real time.&quot; Seasons 3 and 4 of &quot;LazyTown&quot; were filmed as usual in the LazyTown Studios in Iceland, but the special effects for these seasons were created this by Turner Studios in Atlanta.

=== Future ===
On 16 May 2024, in an interview given to Stöð 2, Magnús Scheving received the rights for &quot;LazyTown&quot; back from Warner Bros. Discovery. Also expressing interest in reviving the show in some way, Scheving remarks, &quot;LazyTown must be moving. We sometimes say &quot;Let&#x27;s move the world&quot;. Let&#x27;s move the world. That&#x27;s what LazyTown should do. I think that LazyTown has a lot to do again, as can be seen from YouTube views and such. It&#x27;s a hugely popular topic, incredibly.&quot;

==Television and on-demand history==
In the United States, the show debuted on Nickelodeon on 16 August 2004, and ended on 15 October 2007. The second season debuted in the United States on Nickelodeon in 2006.

The series aired daily on the Nick Jr. Channel from 28 September 2009, to 19 July 2010. On 18 April 2011, Sprout acquired the US TV rights to &quot;LazyTown&quot;. The series aired daily on Sprout from 5 September 2011, to 26 September 2016. &quot;LazyTown&quot; aired on NBC Kids from 7 July 2012, to 27 March 2016.

Nick Jr UK stopped airing repeats in 2011. After the series was revived for seasons three and four, Turner&#x27;s Cartoonito premiered episodes from 2013 to 2014. Viacom&#x27;s Channel 5 also aired the newer episodes as part of its Milkshake! programming block until 2016. Channel 5&#x27;s Demand 5 service carried episodes of the Icelandic version in 2015.

In 2008, a Spanish-dubbed version of &quot;LazyTown&quot; debuted on V-me, a television network created for the Hispanic market in the US. The Spanish-dubbed version also airs on Telemundo (a sister station to NBC) as part of the weekend pre-school morning block MiTelemundo.

In Brazil, the two first seasons of the show was broadcast with Brazilian Portuguese dubbing on SBT (on the children&#x27;s television block &quot;Bom Dia &amp; Cia&quot;), and subsequently on Discovery Kids and Cartoon Network. The last two seasons were broadcast on Boomerang until 2018.

In Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia, the show was broadcast on &quot;Ultra TV&quot;. A Croatian-dubbed version called &quot;Lijeni Grad&quot; was broadcast in Croatia on HRT 2.

In Portugal, the first two seasons of the European Portuguese version aired on RTP 2, and Canal Panda, with the latter two seasons airing solely on RTP 2 several years later.

The series has been dubbed into thirty-two languages. In the Icelandic dub, actors Magnús Scheving (Sportacus), Guðmundur Þór Kárason (Ziggy) and Stefán Karl Stefánsson (Robbie Rotten) dubbed themselves on the soundtrack.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
The week of &quot;LazyTown&quot;″s debut on Nickelodeon in the United States was the channel&#x27;s highest-rated premiere week in three years. A broadcast of the hour-long primetime episode &quot;LazyTown&#x27;s New Superhero&quot; in August 2005 drew three million total viewers, ranking number-one in its time period among all broadcast and cable television with the 2–5, 2–11, and 6–11 demographics. The episode garnered double-digit increases over the last Nick Jr. primetime special to air before it, which was an episode of the network&#x27;s then-highest-rated series &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot;.

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Marilyn Moss praised the show&#x27;s intentions to encourage exercise, calling it &quot;great fun for the very young set, not to mention educational, maybe even life-changing.&quot; Justin New of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; called &quot;LazyTown&quot; &quot;a great show&quot; and stated that he admired the Sportacus character. Common Sense Media&#x27;s Joly Herman gave the show a more mixed review, stating that the characters&#x27; healthy choices are &quot;sometimes lost in the show&#x27;s chaotic nature&quot;. Pete Vonder Haar of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; called &quot;LazyTown&quot; &quot;pretty much the creepiest show on TV since &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;&quot;, citing the &quot;off-putting&quot; mix of live-action and puppetry.

The program has been noted for its appeal towards multiple age groups. In 2005, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; stated that the program &quot;has sparked a cult of healthy living among a certain preschool set [and] has a grown-up following, too.&quot; Lynne Heffley of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that LazyTown &quot;has zany appeal, even to viewers who are no longer &#x27;junior.&#x27;&quot;

===Accolades===
==In popular culture==
In 2008, the song &quot;Cooking By The Book&quot; from the sixth episode &quot;Swiped Sweets&quot; went viral when it was remixed with Lil Jon&#x27;s part from his 2004 Snoop Dogg collaboration &quot;Step Yo Game Up&quot;. The original upload has over 10 million views while a re-upload has amassed over 40 million views. It went further viral on the now defunct video sharing service Vine.

The song &quot;We Are Number One&quot; was named &quot;Dank Meme of the Year&quot; in 2016 on the Reddit subreddit /r/dankmemes, a popular subreddit for memes. The Robbie Rotten memes began in October that year when Stefán Karl Stefánsson, the actor who played Robbie Rotten, announced that he was diagnosed with bile duct cancer.

A GoFundMe page was established by &quot;LazyTown&quot; head writer Mark Valenti to help the actor as he endured his illness. &quot;We Are Number One&quot; and many other LazyTown videos were used to promote the fundraising effort, which eventually surpassed its $100,000 goal. The campaign was popularized by the YouTube channel SiIvaGunner uploading a &quot;We Are Number One&quot; video. To thank his supporters, Stefánsson celebrated by uploading a video of that song performed with his former cast members and &quot;LazyTown&quot;″s composer. On 13 August 2017, Stefánsson was declared cancer-free after a successful surgery; however, he died on 21 August 2018, after his cancer recurred.

==&quot;LazyTown Extra&quot;==
On 15 September 2008, a spin-off television series called &quot;LazyTown Extra&quot; debuted in the United Kingdom on CBeebies. A &quot;magazine format style show&quot; for 3 to 6-year-olds, it features characters from &quot;LazyTown&quot; in an assortment of short sketches. 26 episodes of &quot;Lazy Town Extra&quot; were produced, each between 11 and 15 minutes in duration.

==Merchandise==
In February 2005, Nickelodeon unveiled a collection of &quot;LazyTown&quot; products at the American International Toy Fair. Fisher-Price partnered with Viacom&#x27;s consumer product division to produce the merchandise, all of which was designed to encourage physical activity.

==Promotional events==

From June to August 2005, &quot;LazyTown&quot;″s Stephanie hosted the &quot;Nick Jr. Power Play Summer&quot; event, which involved a series of television spots that replaced the channel&#x27;s standard on-air continuity. Similarly to the live performances and the program itself, this campaign was an experiment designed by the network to increase awareness of exercise and nutrition in its preschool audience.

Nickelodeon produced a stage show titled &quot;LazyTown Live!&quot; in 2005. It debuted at Nickelodeon Suites Resort on 6 August. A modified version toured the United Kingdom and Ireland between October 2007 and August 2008. It introduced a new cast to the United Kingdom, including Julian Essex-Spurrier as Sportacus.

A Spanish-speaking version of the live show premiered in Mexico in 2008, followed by Argentina, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Panama. , it was scheduled to tour the United States in 2010. A Brazilian version of the live show premiered in São Paulo in October 2008. New productions of &quot;LazyTown Live&quot; had their premieres in November 2009 in Portugal and in March 2010 in Spain by producers Warner Bros. Entertainment. A stage play premiering in 2011 introduced the character and concept for Roboticus, which became the first episode of Season 3 of the show in an abridged form.

From 28 January, to 29 November 2009, a live stage production entitled &quot;LazyTown Live! The Pirate Adventure&quot; toured the United Kingdom and Ireland. It featured characters and songs from &quot;LazyTown&quot;, performed by a new cast. In 2016, a UK production entitled &quot;LazyTown Live On Stage&quot; ran from 7 July 2016, to 4 September 2016. This production was posted on YouTube and featured the song &quot;We Are Number One&quot;.

A live show &quot;LazyTown in Schools&quot; premiered in Australia in 2012, touring schools to promote healthy eating and fitness for children.

<doc id="1259276" wikidata="Q662976" url="?curid=1259276" title="Paris-Panthéon-Assas University">
<text>Panthéon-Assas University Paris (, ), commonly known as Assas or Paris 2 (, ), is a university in Paris. It is considered the direct inheritor of the Faculty of Law of Paris, the second-oldest faculty of Law in the world, founded in the 12th century.

Following the 1970 split of the University of Paris, often referred to as the &#x27;Sorbonne&#x27;, in the aftermath of the May 68 events, law professors faced decisions regarding the future of their faculty. 88 out of 108 law professors elected to sustain the legacy of the Faculty of Law of Paris by establishing a new university dedicated to the study of law. The university is housed within the same two buildings that previously accommodated the Faculty of Law of Paris.

Panthéon-Assas, now an independent university, continues to offer the law courses associated with Sorbonne University, having declined to officially integrate as one of its faculties.

The majority of the 19 centres of Panthéon-Assas are located in the Latin Quarter university campus, with the main buildings on Place du Panthéon (&quot;Panthéon Centre&quot;) and Rue d&#x27;Assas (&quot;Assas Centre&quot;), hence its current name. The university is composed of five departments specializing in law, political science, economics, journalism and media studies, and public and private management, and it hosts 24 research centres and five specialized doctoral schools. Every year, the university enrolls approximately 18,000 students, including more than 3,000 international students.

==History==

The University of Paris, commonly referred to as the &#x27;Sorbonne&#x27;, was founded in the middle of the 12th century and officially ceased to exist on 31 December 1970, following the student protests of 1968. Following the University of Paris split, the majority of law professors, 88 out of 108, opted to maintain the essence of the Faculty of Law of Paris by reestablishing it as a new university. In pursuit of this ambition, they founded along with professors of economics the &#x27;University of law, economics and social sciences of Paris&#x27; (&quot;Université de droit, d&#x27;économie et de sciences sociales de Paris&quot;), and kept in it the same buildings with the same research centers. Panthéon-Assas is considered today as direct inheritor of the Faculty of Law of Paris.

The official name of the university was changed to &#x27;Paris II Panthéon-Assas University&#x27; in 1990. The name Panthéon-Assas is a reference to the main addresses of the pre-1968 Faculty of Law of Paris, which are now part of the university; namely, the buildings on Place du Panthéon and Rue d&#x27;Assas. The university is also referred to as &#x27;Assas&#x27; or &#x27;Paris II,&#x27; &#x27;Sorbonne-Assas&#x27; and &#x27;Sorbonne Law School&#x27;.

After the creation of a new Sorbonne University, to which Panthéon-Assas provides law courses in joint degrees, Sorbonne University wanted to integrate Panthéon-Assas as a faculty of law but Panthéon-Assas preferred to remain an independent university within the Sorbonne system.

In 2022, its official name became Paris-Panthéon-Assas University.

==Administration==
Panthéon-Assas is governed by an administration council, a scientific council, and a council for studies and university life. Members of these boards serve two-year terms. The president of Panthéon-Assas is elected by members of the administration council, for a four-year tenure; he or she presides over this council. The president is assisted by two vice-presidents and several professors elected within their respective academic departments. Members of the administration council choose the faculty representatives who make up the scientific council.

The university inherited the academic departments from the Faculty of Law of Paris. It currently houses five of them: one for private law and criminal sciences, one for public law and political science, one for Roman law and legal history, one for economics and management, and one for journalism and communication.

==Campuses==
The university has 18 campuses in Paris, 1 in the city of Melun to the south, and other campuses abroad.

=== Panthéon Centre ===

In 1753, Louis XV decided that a new building would be constructed for the Faculty of Law of Paris. Jacques-Germain Soufflot, alumnus of the Faculty who had become the architect of the King designed and supervised the construction. It took place from 1771 to 1773 and the new building opened in 1774.

Nowadays, the administration offices and postgraduate studies (masters&#x27; and doctoral studies) are located in it. It is situated at 12 Place du Panthéon. It is registered among the national heritage sites of France.

=== Assas Centre ===
History under the Faculty of Law of Paris

The largest campus of Panthéon-Assas is located on Rue d&#x27;Assas and receives second-year to four-year law students. It was designed by Charles Lemaresquier, Alain le Normand, and François Carpentier to accommodate the growing number of students at the University of Paris. It was built between 1959 and 1963 on the former grounds of &quot;Société Marinoni.&quot; At the time of its inauguration, its main lecture theatre was the largest in France, with 1,700 seats.

Renovation and expansion in the 21st century

Centre Assas building, which was going under renovation between 2007 and 2017, has been completely redesigned and now hosts a modern learning center, created by the architect Alain Sarfati.

Cultural events

The Assas building has been hosting concerts of classical music for decades. Herbert von Karajan, Leonard Bernstein, Georg Solti, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Martha Argerich, Gundula Janowitz, Christa Ludwig, Alfred Brendel, Arthur Rubinstein, Seiji Ozawa, Carlo Maria Giulini, or Samson François, among others, have performed in it. The 28th edition of the International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs was held in it in 2017.

The scene at the Cairo airport from &quot;OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies&quot; was filmed in its entrance hall.

=== Vaugirard Centre ===
The campus on the Rue de Vaugirard provides for first-year students. It is located in the chapel wing of the former Jesuit College of the Immaculate Conception, where Charles de Gaulle was a pupil; the chapel itself, dating from the 18th century, was transformed into a lecture hall in the 1980s. The structure is a national heritage site.

=== Sainte Barbe Centre ===

The Center of Roman Law and Legal History of Panthéon-Assas, hosting its research centers in legal history, is situated inside the Collège Sainte-Barbe, former school founded in 1460. The school was founded by Pierre Antoine Victor de Lanneau, teacher of religious studies, as a college of the University of Paris. Ignace de Loyola, Gustave Eiffel, Alfred Dreyfus among others were students there.

=== Melun Campus ===

The campus in the town of Melun hosts local first-year students. It is located in the old town of Melun, on Saint-Étienne Island, among Roman and Gothic remains. The Institute of Law and Economics of Pantheon-Assas University is located there. An extension is currently under construction.

=== Abroad ===

Panthéon-Assas also has campuses in Singapore, Mauritius, and Dubai.

=== Others ===

The campus on Rue Charcot receives third-year and master students in economics.

==Research==
===Research centres===

The university inherited the research centers from the Faculty of Law of Paris. Originally, the Faculty was not organized around research centers and professors were pursuing their research as part of Faculty in general. Hence, only newly emerging fields of research would have newly created institutes, whereas traditional subjects such as Roman law and legal history, private law in general and public law in general, would not necessarily have ones.

== Programs, schools and graduate schools ==

=== Programs ===

==== Undergraduate admissions ====
University–wide (law, economics, management, media...), the university has an acceptance rate of 20%. 22.79% of students accepted by the university having received highest honors (&quot;mention très bien&quot;) in high school during the 2019 session (second university in France, behind Paris 1 with 22.84%).

In Law, within the department of Law, in 2021, the rate of &quot;with honors&quot; and &quot;with highest honors&quot; mentions among the admitted students was 95% (first among undergraduate programs in France).

==== Graduate programs (Masters or LL.M.s) ====

The four historical Masters in Law or LL.M. of the Faculty of Law of Paris were the Masters in: 1° Roman Law and History of Law, 2° Private Law, 3° Public Law and, starting 1964, 4°Criminal Law. They are now rebranded as &quot;Master 2&quot; or &quot;Parcours&quot; (meaning a second-year &quot;path&quot;, within a 2-year masters), under the following names:
*LL.M. in History of Law, with the Institute of Legal History. Albert Rigaudière, member of the &quot;Académie des Inscriptions et des Belles Lettres&quot;, was its director.
*LL.M. in General Private Law, with the Civil Law Research Center. According to &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot;, the LL.M. &quot;considered as a star-degree of the faculty, long been the pet of headhunters, it trains the virtuosi of the law&quot;. Pierre Raynaud was its director at the Faculty of Law of Paris before 1970 and at Panthéon-Assas afterwards.
*LL.M. in Specialized Public Law. It was once directed by Yves Gaudemet, member of the &quot;Académie des sciences morales et politiques&quot;.
*LL.M. in Criminal Law, with the Institute of Criminology and Criminal Law of Paris.

Originally exclusively linked to research studies and doctoral studies, the 5th-year LL.M. is now part of the joint Master&#x27;s program and has become the norm in France for lawyers (including barristers). They have become quite selective and in competition with one another, among all the programs in France. Many LL.M. programs have been created at Panthéon-Assas since the Decree of 16 April 1974 authorizing the creation of more specialized LL.M.s than the 4 original ones, most notably the LL.M. in International Law and LL.M. in Comparative Law. Most of Panthéon-Assas&#x27; LL.M.s enjoy a similar strong reputation in France and Europe.

==== International programs ====
Panthéon-Assas offers international integrated undergraduate programs (&quot;Bachelor-Double maîtrise&quot;) with universities such as Oxford University, University College London, King&#x27;s College London, University College Dublin. It offers international integrated postgraduate programs (LL.M.-Master 2) with some universities such as, on top of the latter ones, Boston University, Humboldt University of Berlin, Ludwig Maximilians University, Sapienza University of Rome, University of Padua.

Yale Law School and Panthéon-Assas signed in June 2011 an Agreement for Collaborative Activities to create an environment for long-term joint research, exchange. and programming activities. They organize, together with the ESSEC Business School, a summer school in law and economics, the &quot;Yale-Paris II-Essec Summer School&quot;.

It created in 2011 the &quot;Sorbonne-Assas International Law School&quot; which have campuses in Paris, Singapore, Mauritius and Dubai.

Assas has cooperation agreements with 315 partner universities, including 113 Erasmus+ partners.

==== Joint academic programs ====
Panthéon-Assas offers several joint undergraduate and graduate programs with the Sorbonne University. It has also joint programs with other French universities and institutions such as INSEAD (Sorbonne University Alliance), Dauphine, PSL University, Mines Paris, PSL University, Sciences Po Paris, ESSEC Business School, CY Cergy Paris University or HEC Paris.

==== Online programs ====
In 2013, the university set up an e-learning platform, called &quot;Agor@ssas&quot;. It created that year a distance-learning undergraduate degree in law, the first and unique one in France. It is taught by professors from Panthéon-Assas and leads to exactly the same degree offerings the same rights. In addition, &quot;e-students&quot; have access to &quot;e-tutors&quot; to help them with pedagogical and administrative questions.

==== Preparatory schools ====
In July 2012, Panthéon-Assas became the first university in France to open preparatory school for the bar school entrance examination, which were until this point the monopoly of private preparatory schools. These courses were offered for a cheap price, and for free for students from low-income families (10% of the students of the preparatory school). This led private preparatory schools to plead unfair competition and the French courts ordered Panthéon-Assas to close the school. Today, the Bar preparation school is known as the IEJ-Institut d&#x27;Études Judiciaires &quot;Pierre Reynaud&quot;.

Assas&#x27; Melun campus has been selected in 2021 by the French Government to host three preparatory schools &quot;Prépa Talents&quot;.

=== Schools ===

==== &quot;Collège de droit&quot; and &quot;École de droit&quot; ====

On top of its core curriculum, Panthéon-Assas created in 2008 a special school for its best students, in order to give them special courses and a special degree: the &quot;Collège de droit&quot; (&quot;College of Law&quot;). To be admitted, &quot;Summa Cum Laude&quot; in Baccalauréat and success at an entrance test are needed. Each class is composed of around 100 students, now selected among the whole France each year. The &quot;Collège de droit&quot; was the first college of law created by a French University in 2008.

In 2011, it created the two-year &quot;École de droit&quot; (&quot;School of Law&quot;), the continuity of the three-year College of Law. An additional year abroad is mandatory to obtain the &quot;École de droit&quot; diploma degree.

Panthéon-Assas University being considered as the top faculty of law in France, media focused particularly on it and called even more this curriculum a &quot;way of excellence&quot;.
