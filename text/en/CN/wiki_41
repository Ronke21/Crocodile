<text>James Samuel Everett III, (born January 3, 1963) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons, primarily with the Los Angeles Rams. He played college football for the Purdue Boilermakers and was selected third overall in the 1986 NFL draft by the Houston Oilers. Unable to work out a contract agreement with Everett, the Oilers traded his rights to the Rams, with whom Everett played from 1986 to 1993. Everett then played with the New Orleans Saints from 1994 to 1996 and ended his career with a stint with the San Diego Chargers in 1997.

==College career==
Purdue University recruited Everett out of Eldorado High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Jim Everett led his high school team to the State Championship game in 1979 against the Demons of Santa Fe High School. The Demons&#x27; stifling defense (held opponents to 100 points) and record-setting offense (547 points scored) handed Jim Everett and his Eagle teammates their second loss of the season, and avenged a loss the Demons suffered earlier in the year. In 1980, they finally won the school&#x27;s only state championship. In addition to quarterbacking the team, he played defense as a safety.

Recruited to play either safety or quarterback, he was soon slotted into the quarterback role where he narrowly missed out on being a four-year starter at Purdue, as a game-day decision before his first game as a freshman led to Scott Campbell getting the nod over Everett. Campbell held off Everett for three years, one of which Everett was able to redshirt to gain an extra year of eligibility. Upon Campbell&#x27;s graduation to a seven-year career in the NFL, Everett took over the reins of the pass-oriented Boilermakers offense.

As a junior, Everett opened the 1984 season by leading the Boilermakers to an upset of the No. 8 Notre Dame Irish in the inaugural game of the Hoosier Dome, Everett was great, connecting on 20 of 28 passes for 255 yards and two touchdowns, the Boilers won 23-21; four weeks later he again led the Boilers to an upset of No. 2 Ohio State. On November 3rd, he scored a hat-trick of sorts by leading the Boilers over Michigan, a feat no other Purdue quarterback has achieved in a single season. Capping off his junior season, he led the Boilermakers to the 1984 Peach Bowl, where he passed for 253 yards and three touchdowns. Purdue lost the game to Virginia, quarterbacked by future Green Bay Packer Don Majkowski, 27–24. Everett is also the only Purdue quarterback to ever beat Michigan, Notre Dame, and Ohio State all in the same season (1984).

During the 1985 season, Everett finished with 3,589 yards of total offense, second in the nation behind Robbie Bosco of BYU, and a school record at the time (later surpassed by Drew Brees). He finished sixth in balloting for the 1985 Heisman Trophy, and was a second-team All-American.

Everett earned regular membership on the Distinguished Students list at Purdue, and graduated with a degree in industrial management. During his time at Purdue, Everett regularly tutored fellow Purdue athletes in courses such as calculus and statistical analysis. He was also initiated into the Sigma Chi fraternity as an undergraduate. During his senior year, he was awarded the Big Ten Medal of Honor in recognition of his athletic and academic achievements.

* 1985: 3,651 yards with 23 TD vs 11 INT in 11 games

==NFL career==
===1986 draft and trade to Rams===
Before the 1986 draft, Everett was generally rated the best quarterback available, although some scouts had him behind Iowa’s Chuck Long. The Indianapolis Colts traded up from the sixth position to the fourth with the expected goal of drafting Everett before the St. Louis Cardinals, who picked fifth, did so. However, Everett would be drafted third overall by the Houston Oilers. It is widely believed the Oilers, who possessed a developing franchise quarterback in Warren Moon and a capable backup in Oliver Luck — drafted Everett merely to prevent the Colts doing so.

Conflicts between Oiler general manager Ladd Herzeg and Everett&#x27;s agent Marv Demoff meant Everett would never sign with the Oilers, although the team offered him a four-year, 3.7 million-dollar contract in mid-August. A wait-and-see attitude regarding established starter Moon meant that the Oilers did not consider trading Everett until the last week of August. Eventually, when protracted negotiations between ownership and Demoff broke down with the regular season already underway, the Oilers decided to trade Everett. The San Francisco 49ers — who had lost champion Joe Montana for the season to back surgery — were initially expected to gain his services, but on September 18 he would be signed by the Los Angeles Rams, who were seeking a change of policy from their previous reliance on aging veterans at quarterback.

===Los Angeles Rams===
With the Rams, Everett became a statistical leader in several passing categories. His Rams teams were successful early in his career, earning playoff berths in 1986, 1988, and 1989, despite never reaching the Super Bowl. Everett continued to produce fine statistics, and was rewarded with a trip to the 1991 Pro Bowl in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Despite productive years with the Rams, 1989 marked Everett&#x27;s final playoff season in his NFL career. Starting in 1990, the Rams began to trade or release players due to financial concerns. For example, LeRoy Irvin spent his final season with the Lions, while Greg Bell, who had been the team&#x27;s starting running back, spent 1990 across town. After winning 13 games in 1989 (including 2 playoff wins), the Rams won 19 games &quot;combined&quot; in the next four seasons (5 in 1990, 3 in 1991, 6 in 1992, 5 in 1993).

The 1993 season was a low point in Everett&#x27;s career. He played in only 10 games but managed to throw 12 interceptions. He threw only eight touchdown passes, tying the lowest yearly total of his career and matching his rookie total when he only played in six games. Around mid-season, Rams coach Chuck Knox benched him for T. J. Rubley.

===New Orleans Saints===
The Rams traded Everett to the Saints in March 1994. In return, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported, Los Angeles received &quot;a seventh-round pick in the 1995 draft&quot;.

In three years with the Saints, benefiting from receivers such as Quinn Early and former Falcon receiver Michael Haynes and former Bear fullback Brad Muster in the backfield, Everett threw 22, 26, and 12 touchdowns. Nevertheless, the team finished 7–9, 7–9, and 3–13 in those three years, respectively. The Saints, like many other NFL teams, released or traded core players when the NFL&#x27;s salary cap took effect around the time Everett arrived. The Dome Patrol defense had also largely been dismantled by 1994. Only Sam Mills remained on the Saints&#x27; roster by 1994, and that was Mills&#x27;s final season, as he departed for the expansion Carolina Panthers the following year. Running backs Dalton Hilliard and Craig Heyward had also both left the Saints by 1994.

===San Diego Chargers===
Everett signed with the Chargers in June 1997. In his first start for San Diego, he defeated the Saints, 20–6, in his return to the Superdome. 1997 was his final NFL season.

Over his career, Everett performed well enough to be among league leaders in several passing categories. His 203 touchdown passes rank 45th all-time, and his 34,837 passing yards are 33rd all-time. He also ranks 35th all-time in completions and 32nd all-time in pass attempts. On a year-to-year basis, he was among the top ten league leaders in pass attempts (seven times), completions (eight times), pass yards (seven times), and passing touchdowns (six, including leading the league twice).

Everett&#x27;s two postseason victories (both in 1989) tied him with Vince Ferragamo, James Harris, and Norm Van Brocklin for second-most playoff victories during the Rams&#x27; first stint in Los Angeles (as of 2018, it is now the third-most). Only Ferragamo had more wins (three) during the Rams&#x27; 49-year stint in Los Angeles. Kurt Warner&#x27;s five playoff victories during the Rams&#x27; years in St. Louis have since superseded Ferragamo&#x27;s record.

==NFL career statistics==
=== Regular season ===
==Jim Rome altercation==
Following the 1989 regular season, Everett was reportedly &quot;shellshocked&quot; from the numerous times he was sacked and hit in the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers (the 49ers won, 30–3). At one point in the game, Everett was so rattled that he collapsed to the ground in the pocket in anticipation of a sack, even though the 49ers&#x27; defensive players had not yet reached him, a play now known as Everett&#x27;s &quot;phantom sack&quot;.

His struggle eventually led to a 1994 confrontation with then &quot;Talk2&quot; host Jim Rome. Rome had regularly mocked Everett&#x27;s aversion to taking hits on the field, mockingly referring to him as &quot;Chris&quot; Everett (a reference to female tennis player, Chris Evert). When Everett appeared as a guest on &quot;Talk2&quot;, Rome wasted no time, calling him &quot;Chris&quot;. Everett dared Rome to repeat it to his face again, implying that a physical confrontation would ensue were Rome to do so. When Rome did it anyway, Everett overturned the table between them and shoved Rome to the floor while still on the air. Rome was not injured and no legal action was taken following the confrontation.

In a 2012 interview with &quot;Deadspin&quot;, Everett stated that &quot;a large burger franchise&quot; wanted to use the footage in an ad. Everett agreed, but Rome did not, blocking the deal.

==Post-NFL==
After his NFL career ended, Everett received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University and started an asset management business. Eventually, he settled in Dana Point, California.

<doc id="1243075" wikidata="Q3116199" url="?curid=1243075" title="Greg Cook">
<text>Gregory Lynn Cook (November 20, 1946 – January 27, 2012) was an American football quarterback who played two professional seasons, in the American Football League (AFL) and later the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Cincinnati and was selected 5th overall in the 1969 NFL/AFL draft. Once considered a rising star for the Cincinnati Bengals, he had his pro career prematurely ended by recurring shoulder troubles.

In 2007, NFL Films named Cook as the number one greatest NFL &quot;one-shot wonder&quot; of all time, describing him as one of the biggest &quot;what-ifs&quot; in league history, in the seventh installment of its program &quot;NFL Top 10&quot;.

==Early life==
Cook lived most of his life in Chillicothe, Ohio, where he played baseball, basketball and football at Chillicothe High School.

He played collegiately at Cincinnati, once throwing for 554 yards in a game. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the first round of the 1969 NFL/AFL Draft after Bengals coach and founder Paul Brown saw Cook&#x27;s performance in the Bearcats&#x27; come-from-behind, 23–21 victory against Miami University in Bo Schembechler&#x27;s last game before he left to coach at the University of Michigan. Brown had attended the game, but left when the Miami Redskins&#x27; lead reached 21–6. &quot;That quarterback. That&#x27;s our draft choice,&quot; said Brown after seeing film of Cook&#x27;s rallying performance.

==Professional career==
In 1969, the Bengals released John Stofa, the starting signal caller for much of the team&#x27;s inaugural season, and named Cook as the starting quarterback. His season started spectacularly, as he led the Bengals to a 3–0 record. However, in game three versus Kansas City, Cook felt a pop in his right (throwing) shoulder after being tackled by linebacker Jim Lynch and missed the next three games. Possibly due to the limited medical technology at the time, his torn rotator cuff went undiagnosed.

Despite this, Cook went on to pass for 1,854 yards and led the Bengals to wins over the Chiefs and the Oakland Raiders, two of the three best teams in the AFL. His 9.411 yards per pass attempt (YPA) and 17.5 yard per completion are rookie records that still stand; Cook&#x27;s 9.41 YPA remains a Bengals franchise record. Cook was UPI&#x27;s choice for AFL Rookie of the year.
Cook recalled, &quot;I took cortisone shots and played in pain, but the shoulder hadn&#x27;t started to deteriorate yet, so I could still function. I still had the strength. I felt obligated to finish the season. I&#x27;d gotten off to a good start. I didn&#x27;t want to relinquish that.&quot;

The rotator cuff began deteriorating after the season; during surgery, it was revealed that Cook also had a partially detached biceps muscle. After three operations proved futile, he retired. Cook saw action in one game during a 1973 comeback attempt, but he retired permanently after. The NFL Network &quot;NFL Top Ten&quot; series named Cook the #1 One Shot Wonder in NFL history.

Former New York Jets quarterback Chad Pennington, who suffered two tears to his rotator cuff and underwent as many surgeries to repair it, was often compared to Cook because their injuries were so similar. Cook&#x27;s injury was also similar to one suffered by New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who had surgery on his rotator cuff after the 2005–06 season.

Cook finished his career with 1,865 passing yards with an average of 17.4 yards per completion. He threw 15 touchdowns in his career and 11 interceptions.

==Life after football==
Following retirement, Cook lived in Cincinnati, and worked with United Parcel Service and with Worksite Information Network as a motivational speaker for labor unions. He was an art major at the University of Cincinnati, and continued to paint. Cook had works on display in the Ohio Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Cook did some color commentary of University of Cincinnati football broadcasts in the mid-1980s.

==Death==
Cook died on January 27, 2012, shortly after being admitted to The Christ Hospital, a Cincinnati-area hospital, with pneumonia.

<text>The white-winged duck or white-winged wood duck (Asarcornis scutulata) is a large species of duck, formerly placed in the genus &quot;Cairina&quot; with the Muscovy duck (&quot;Cairina moschata&quot;) and allied with the dabbling ducks. However, mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence analysis indicate that the anatomical similarity to the Muscovy duck is deceiving and that the species is appropriately placed in a monotypic genus, as &quot;Asarcornis scutulata&quot;, which is evolutionarily closer to the redhead (&quot;Aythya americana&quot;, one of the diving ducks).

==Description==
This is one of the largest living species of duck next only to the steamer ducks which are heavier. The Muscovy duck also attains sizes that nearly rival the white-winged duck, but may average a bit smaller in a wild state. Length is and wingspan is . Males weigh , while females weigh . The most noticeable feature on adult birds, is the dark body contrasting with a whitish head and neck. Males have mostly dull yellowish bill, blackish mottling on the head and upper neck, white lesser median coverts and inner edges of tertials and bluish-grey secondaries. In flight, white wing-coverts contrast with the rest of the wings. Females are smaller and usually have more densely mottled head and upper neck. The juvenile is duller and browner.

This secretive species is only known to feed at night. Its diet consists of seeds, aquatic plants, grain, rice, snails, small fish and insects. It inhabits stagnant or slow-flowing natural and artificial wetlands, within or adjacent to evergreen, deciduous or swamp forests, on which it depends for roosting and nesting, usually in tree holes. Although lowlands (below c.200 m) provide optimum habitat, it occurs up to 1,400 m of altitude, especially on plateaus supporting sluggish perennial rivers and pools.
==Distribution and status==
Historically, the white-winged duck was widely distributed from northeastern India and Bangladesh, throughout South East Asia to Java and Sumatra. It is now extinct in Java. In India, the duck is found only in the northeastern part of the country, with the main concentration in eastern Assam and adjacent areas of Arunachal Pradesh. However, in 2002 it had a population of only 800, with about 200 in Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, 150 on Sumatra, notably in Way Kambas National Park and 450 in India, Bangladesh and Burma.

In Malaysia, it has been confirmed by IUCN that this duck is possibly extinct.

In India, the key protected areas for the white-winged duck are Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, Dihing-Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary, Nameri National Park and Namdapha National Park.

The white-winged duck occurs in dense tropical evergreen forests, near rivers and swamps.

They tend to nest in tree cavities, and are threatened in part since the destruction of hollow trees is destroying their nesting localities. The draining of swamps and rivers and other forms of habitat destruction is also destroying the habitat that they could survive in. Additional threats include loss of genetic variability, disturbance, hunting, and collection of eggs and chicks for food or pets.

Due to ongoing habitat loss, a small population size, and because this duck is hunted for food, eggs and pets, the white-winged duck is evaluated as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. The white-winged duck is also found in the central Sumatra province of Riau, specifically in the peatland &quot;Acacia&quot; plantations of a large pulp and paper company. The plantations, at least temporarily, provide suitable habitat between periodic harvests (once every 4–5 years). The ducks are frequently observed along canals where large and overhanging &quot;Acacia&quot; trees provide shade and cover from predators and a haven in which to feed and rest. The quiet and still water in the canals of the plantations provides an undisturbed and secluded location, away from local communities which may hunt the ducks or collect their eggs. Nearby, natural forest conservation areas and greenbelts also provide suitable nesting and roosting habitat in close proximity to the canals.

It is the state bird of the Indian state of Assam.

There have been efforts to preserve the population by breeding in captivity in England. It has been seen that they do well under shady, dimly-lit conditions, but there is also a higher chance for them to contract avian tuberculosis.

<doc id="1243084" wikidata="Q720118" url="?curid=1243084" title="Ralph Linton">
<text>Ralph Linton (27 February 1893 – 24 December 1953) was an American anthropologist of the mid-20th century, particularly remembered for his texts &quot;The Study of Man&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Tree of Culture&quot; (1955). One of Linton&#x27;s major contributions to anthropology was defining a distinction between status and role.

==Early life and education==
Linton was born into a family of Quaker restaurant entrepreneurs in Philadelphia in 1893 and entered Swarthmore College in 1911. He was an indifferent student and resisted his father&#x27;s pressures to prepare himself for the life of a professional. He grew interested in archaeology after participating in a field school in the southwest and took a year off of his studies to participate in another archaeological excavation at Quiriguá in Guatemala. Having found a strong focus he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1915.

Although Linton became a prominent anthropologist, his graduate education took place largely at the periphery of the discipline. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned his master&#x27;s degree studying with Frank Speck while undertaking additional archaeological field work in New Jersey and New Mexico.

He was admitted to a Ph.D. program at Columbia University thereafter, but did not become close to Franz Boas, the doyen of anthropology in that era. When America entered World War I, Linton enlisted and served in France during 1917–1919 with Battery D, 149th Field Artillery, 42nd (Rainbow) Division. Linton served as a corporal and saw battle at the trenches, experiencing first hand a German gas attack. Linton&#x27;s military experience would be a major influence on his subsequent work. One of his first published articles was &quot;Totemism and the A.E.F.&quot; (Published in American Anthropologist vol. 26:294–300)&quot;, in which he argued that the way in which military units often identified with their symbols could be considered a kind of totemism.

His military fervor probably did not do anything to improve his relationship with the pacifist Franz Boas, who abhorred all displays of nationalism or jingoism. An anecdote has it that Linton was rebuked by Boas when he appeared in class in his military uniform. Whatever the cause, shortly after his return to the United States, he transferred from Columbia to Harvard, where he studied with Earnest Hooton, Alfred Tozzer, and Roland Dixon.

After a year of classes at Harvard, Linton proceeded to do more fieldwork, first at Mesa Verde and then as a member of the Bayard Dominick Expedition led by E.S.C. Handy under the auspices of the Bishop Museum to the Marquesas.

While in the Pacific, his focus shifted from archaeology to cultural anthropology, although he would retain a keen interest in material culture and &#x27;primitive&#x27; art throughout his life. He returned from the Marquesas in 1922 and eventually received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1925.

==Academic career==
Linton used his Harvard connections to secure a position at the Field Museum of Chicago after his return from the Marquesas. His official position was as Curator of American Indian materials. He continued working on digs in Ohio which he had first begun as a graduate student, but also began working through the museum&#x27;s archival material on the Pawnee and published data collected by others in a series of articles and museum bulletins. While at the Field Museum he worked with illustrator and future children&#x27;s book artist and author Holling Clancy Holling.

Between 1925 and 1927, Linton undertook an extensive collecting trip to Madagascar for the field museum, exploring the western end of the Austronesian diaspora after having studied the eastern end of this culture in the Marquesas. He did his own fieldwork there as well, and the book that resulted, &quot;The Tanala: A Hill Tribe of Madagascar&quot; (1933), was the most detailed ethnography he would publish.

On his return to the United States, Linton took a position at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where the Department of Sociology had expanded to include an anthropology unit. Linton thus served as the first member of what would later become a separate department. Several of his students went on to become important anthropologists, such as Clyde Kluckhohn, Marvin Opler, Philleo Nash, and Sol Tax. Up to this point, Linton had been primarily a researcher in a rather romantic vein, and his years at Wisconsin were the period in which he developed his ability to teach and publish as a theoretician. This fact, combined with his penchant for popular writing and his intellectual encounter with Radcliffe-Brown (then at the University of Chicago), led to the publication of his textbook &quot;The Study of Man&quot; (1936). It was also during this period that he married his third wife, Adelin Hohlfeld, who worked as his secretary and editor as well as his collaborator—many of the popular pieces published jointly by them (such as &quot;Halloween Through Twenty Centuries&quot;) were in fact entirely written by Adelin Hohlfield.

In 1937 Linton came to Columbia University, appointed to the post of head of the Anthropology department after the retirement of Franz Boas. The choice was opposed by most of Boas&#x27; students, with whom Linton had never been on good terms. The Boasians had expected Ruth Benedict to be the choice for Boas&#x27; successor. As head of the department Linton informed against Boas and many of his students to the FBI, accusing them of being communists. This led to some of them being fired and blacklisted, for example Gene Weltfish. Throughout his life Linton maintained an intense personal animosity against the Boasians, particularly against Ruth Benedict, and he was a fierce critic of the Culture and Personality approach. According to Sidney Mintz who was a colleague of Linton at Yale, he even once jokingly boasted that he had killed Benedict using a Tanala magic charm.

When World War II broke out, Linton became involved in war-planning and his thoughts on the war and the role of the United States (and American Anthropology) could be seen in several works of the post-war period, most notably &quot;The Science of Man in the World Crisis&quot; (1945) and &quot;Most of the World&quot;. It was during the war that Linton also undertook a long trip to South America, where he experienced a coronary occlusion that left him in precarious health.

After the war Linton moved to Yale University, a center for anthropologists such as G. P. Murdock who had collaborated with the US government. He taught there from 1946 to 1953, where he continued to publish on culture and personality. It was during this period that he also began writing &quot;The Tree of Culture&quot;, an ambitious global overview of human culture. Linton was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. He died of complications relating to his trip in South America on Christmas Eve, 1953. His wife, Adelin Hohlfield Linton, completed &quot;The Tree of Culture&quot; which went on to become a popular textbook.

==Work==
&quot;The Study of Man&quot; established Linton as one of anthropology&#x27;s premier theorists, particularly amongst sociologists who worked outside of the Boasian mainstream. In this work he developed the concepts of status and role for describing the patterns of behavior in society. According to Linton, ascribed status is assigned to an individual without reference to their innate differences or abilities. Whereas Achieved status is determined by an individual&#x27;s performance or effort. Linton noted that while the definitions of the two concepts are clear and distinct, it is not always easy to identify whether an individual&#x27;s status is ascribed or achieved. His perspective offers a deviation from the view that ascribed statuses are always fixed. For Linton a role is the set of behaviors associated with a status, and performing the role by doing the associated behaviors is the way in which a status is inhabited.

Throughout this early period Linton became interested in the problem of acculturation, working with Robert Redfield and Melville Herskovits on a prestigious Social Science Research Council subcommittee of the Committee on Personality and Culture. The result was a seminal jointly-authored piece entitled &quot;Memorandum for the Study of Acculturation&quot; (1936). Linton also obtained money from the Works Progress Administration for students to produce work which studied acculturation. The volume &quot;Acculturation in Seven American Indian Tribes&quot; is an example of the work in this period, and Linton&#x27;s contributions to the volume remain his most influential writings on acculturation. Linton&#x27;s interest in culture and personality also expressed itself in the form of a seminar he organized with Abram Kardiner at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute.

<text>Harvest Moon 64, released in Japan as , is a 1999 farm simulation video game developed by Victor Interactive Software for the Nintendo 64 console. It was published by Victor Interactive in Japan and by Natsume Inc. in North America. It is the third game in the &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; series (following &quot;Harvest Moon GB&quot;).

The game was re-released on the Wii U in 2017, marking its first release in PAL territories. It was re-released again for the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2023.

==Gameplay==
The objective of &quot;Harvest Moon 64&quot; is to restore and maintain an abandoned farm left to the player by their grandfather. Along with restoring the farm, there are a number of other side quests that the player may choose to partake in, including training and racing a horse, selling crops, participating in a variety of town festivals, falling in love and getting married, collecting recipes, and collecting photographs from various achievements and events.

The player starts out with the bare minimum features for the farm, including an empty chicken coop and barn, but animals and house extensions can be purchased and tools can be upgraded over the course of the game. The local town, where most of the villagers spend their day, contains a church, a bar, a bakery, a town square, a flower shop, a library, a tool shop, among other things.

Unlike the original &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; for the SNES, there is a limited amount of time to work in any given day as well as a limited amount of stamina for work. Many game features, such as character locations and which shops are open, vary depending on the current time and day of the week. There are four seasons per year, each with its own weather patterns, crops to grow, and wild herbs available. Some days are reserved for festivals, where every shop is closed and special events take place. This offers a break from daily chores and a chance to interact with the townsfolk in unique ways, such as dancing or swimming.

Planting, growing, and harvesting crops is one of the main focuses of the &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; series. The crops available to plant include turnips, potatoes, corn, and strawberries, and they can be purchased in the village during their respective season. To plant crops, the player must till the soil, plant the seeds, then water the plots. Several crops will yield multiple vegetables throughout the season if continually watered. When the season ends and a new begins, all crops from the previous season will wither and must be cut down. Alternatively, a greenhouse can be built so that any plant can grow anytime during the year.

Along with crops planted on the farm, there are also wild growing plants and herbs that the player may pick as he goes through his daily chores. The wild growing plants also change from season to season and reappear each day. Though all wild plants are edible, some can cause sickness while others prevent it.

The player starts with five basic tools to help restore the farm: a hammer, an axe, a sickle, a hoe, and a watering can. After a certain amount of usage, a tool will automatically upgrade (signified when the tool becomes silver and then later gold), allowing the player to do more work faster using less energy. Tools for livestock such as a cow milker and an animal brush can be purchased in the village.
Taking care of animals is an essential part of maintaining the farm. Livestock, such as cows, sheep, and chickens, may be purchased at a nearby ranch. These animals require food and care, and if left unfed or left outside in the rain, it will become sick and eventually die unless the player gives it medicine. If the animals are treated well, the products they give will increase in quality.

The player can own a dog and a horse. The dog originally belonged to the player character&#x27;s grandfather and is a throwback to the original &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;. A horse can be obtained by visiting the nearby ranch, and can be ridden or used as a portable shipping crate. Both the dog and the horse can compete in yearly races, where their performance is largely determined by their relationship with the player.

One of the other major features of &quot;Harvest Moon 64&quot; is the ability to marry and have a child. There are five eligible girls in &quot;Harvest Moon 64&quot;, represented by hearts that appear in their dialogue boxes, representative of her affection toward the player, ranging from white (indifferent) to pink (in love). Each of these girls has a non-player character suitor that will eventually marry her if the player chooses to marry another girl or chooses not to pursue anyone.

The game features a series of collectable items. When the player reaches a certain milestone or achieves one of several goals, they will receive a photograph in the mail to remember the event. Earned photographs are available for viewing at any time by checking the photo album on the bedside table and are a way to track a player&#x27;s success in the game.

== Release ==
&quot;Harvest Moon 64&quot; was released in Japan on February 5, 1999, and in North America by Natsume Inc. on December 22, 1999.

Natsume initially stated bringing it to Wii U Virtual Console was not possible due to technical issues, despite the Wii proving the task to be possible through homebrew emulation. However, in celebration of the series&#x27; twentieth anniversary, the game saw release on the Wii U Virtual Console on February 23, 2017. This also marked the game&#x27;s debut in the PAL regions (the original had been cancelled due to time constraints), as well as the game&#x27;s first official re-release (as well as the first time digital) in nearly two decades.

The game was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service on December 7, 2023.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave it a favorable review, nearly two months before it was released Stateside. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 31 out of 40.

Many reviews claimed that although the game had a repetitive soundtrack and often glitchy visual displays, the game&#x27;s captivating and unique gameplay made up for it.

Aaron Boulding, who rated the game for &quot;IGN&quot;, said &quot;(he) was able to forgive a lot of shortcomings like poor audio and visual elements because (he) found (himself) playing it for hours at a time.&quot; Joe Fielder, who rated it for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, claimed that &quot;although not for everyone, &quot;Harvest Moon 64&quot; is a strangely compelling, original little game that makes hours melt away incomprehensibly.&quot; Slo&#x27; Mo of &quot;GamePro&quot; said that the game &quot;isn&#x27;t a game for swashbucklers or diehard cityslickers, but, for pure RPG fans, it&#x27;s a horse of a different color.&quot;

Mars Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Parent&#x27;s Guide to Nintendo Games&quot; gave the game the only Parent&#x27;s Guide Choice Award for a Nintendo 64 game because it met the requirements of a game that &quot;displays imagination, creativity, ingenuity of the first order, while offering a playing atmosphere that is educational and enriching.&quot;

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked &quot;Harvest Moon 64&quot; as the 278th greatest Nintendo game of all time.

===Inauguration===
The airline was founded in 1980 as PARSA, though certain services were operated as Turismo Aéreo. At the time of its startup, Panama had been ruled by a military dictatorship government since 1968, but together with Aeroperlas, the company became one of the biggest and most prominent airlines in the country. On 20 December 1989, in the wake of the United States invasion of Panama, two Britten-Norman Islander aircraft owned by PARSA were damaged beyond repair in fighting action. Despite this, the airline expanded rapidly to other destinations around Panama and Costa Rica during the 1990s, and began to acquire newer aircraft.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1997, PARSA suffered its first fatal accident when a Britten-Norman Islander crashed into the jungle 6.5 kilometres short of Rio Sidra Airport, Darien, killing all on board.

In January 1999, the airline moved its headquarters to the new Albrook - Marcos A. Gelabert International Airport, when the old airport located at Paitilla was shut down after 70 years of operation. In 2005, the Air Panama trademark rights were acquired. The name had been unused since the demise of Air Panamá Internacional in January 1990, and PARSA formally adopted the new name that year.

===Expansion years===
After the purchase of the trademark rights in 2005, Chairman George Novey unveiled on a Fokker F-27 aircraft PARSA&#x27;s new identity Air Panama. Shortly afterward, the airline introduced new scheduled services to other regional destinations around Panama and began to acquire turboprop aircraft such as the Saab 340 and the Bombardier Dash 8-300 series, replacing the aging British Aerospace Jetstream 31 and Fokker F27 Friendship fleet.

In 2009, Air Panama reached a historic milestone when it transported its one millionth passenger. That same year, the airline entered the jet age
when it acquired two Fokker 70s. In 2011, Air Panama bought two used Fokker 50s previously owned by Scandinavian Airlines System and transported around 172,154 people.
In January 2012, Air Panama announced a codeshare agreement with Copa Airlines, Panama&#x27;s flag carrier and largest airline, linking all tourist destinations within Panama with several in Latin America. The agreement became effective five months later when the company started charter regional flights to Isla Colon from Tocumen International Airport. As of 2016, this codeshare is no longer active.

On 29 February 2012, domestic competitor Aeroperlas Regional ceased operations due to financial troubles, leaving Air Panama as the sole regional carrier in the country. The same month, the airline expressed an interest in initiating a non-stop international route from Panama to the Cayman Islands, using jet-powered aircraft. In anticipation for these flights, Air Panama ordered two Fokker 100 aircraft, receiving the first one in June and the second two months later. As of February 2015, the planned service to Cayman Islands is on standstill. Almost six months after Aeroperlas&#x27; bankruptcy, Air Panama assumed all of its domestic routes.

In November 2012, Air Panama launched an updated version of its website (www.airpanama.com), with a new operational system that allowed travelers to purchase tickets in real time, and to see flight schedules and status. It was the first time the airline extensively overhauled its website since its official rebranding in 2006.

In 2013, Air Panama sold the two Fokker 70s in favour of more spacious Fokker 100s. Between August and November of the same year, the airline acquired two Boeing 737-300s as part of a strategic expansion plan into the international market, which started with the launch of scheduled commercial services to Medellín, Colombia, in June 2014.

In 2015, the airline added three more Fokker 100 aircraft. In July 2015 the airline began daily non-stop flights from Panama to San José, Costa Rica. Services to Costa Rica from David, Chiriqui are still maintained. On December 1, of the same year, Air Panama started services to Armenia, its second destination in Colombia.

<text>Ian Ryan Grushka (born September 4, 1977) is an American musician and songwriter. He is a founding member and the bassist of Florida rock band New Found Glory. He was also the bassist in the band&#x27;s now defunct side-project, the International Superheroes of Hardcore, where he performed under the pseudonym of &quot;Sgt. Soy&quot;.

==Biography==
Ian Grushka was born in Smithtown, New York. As a child he played saxophone but gave it up after a year. Along with his parents and two brothers, he moved to Coral Springs, Florida, when he was 9 years old. He graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 1995, where he learned to play guitar and bass.

==Musical career==
In 1997 Grushka played bass in the band &quot;Inner City Kids&quot; and later &quot;Flip 60&quot; with Jordan Pundik (vocals). After disbanding &quot;Flip 60&quot;, they recruited Stephen Klein (guitar), whom Pundik met at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and had previously played with him in the band &quot;Fallview&quot;. The threesome began to jam together. Practicing in Grushka&#x27;s garage, they later invited Joe &quot;Taco Joe&quot; Marino to play drums. Shortly thereafter, Chad Gilbert (lead guitar), former vocalist of Shai Hulud, joined to complete the quintet. The band would become New Found Glory.

In addition to his work with New Found Glory, Grushka has worked with a number of artists. He plays bass on the track &quot;Cobwebs&quot; on DBY&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Make It Bleed&quot;. He also plays bass on the track &quot;Boy Without Batteries&quot; on Man Overboard 2013 album, &quot;Heart Attack&quot;. Grushka plays bass on the tracks &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, &quot;Stay with Me Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Johnny&quot; on the 2013 release &quot;Andy Jackson And The Mary Tyler Mormons&quot; by Andy Jackson And The Mary Tyler Mormons.

Grushka has also lent his vocals to several albums. He provides backup vocals on the tracks &quot;Drinking Song&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot; from the 1998 Anchorman album, &quot;Still Need You More Than Air&quot;. He also sings backup on &quot;Miserable&quot; and &quot;Up &#x27;Til Now&quot; on the 2007 release &quot;Nervous Breakthrough&quot; by the band Lefty.

In 2004, Grushka and Gilbert started the record label Broken Sounds, which signed Breakdance Vietnam, Eagleslayer, Suffocate Faster, and Slowdance.

==Acting career==
Along with the rest of New Found Glory, Grushka appears in the 2004 movie &quot;Tales from the Crapper&quot;. He also makes a cameo appearance in the Good Charlotte video for &quot;Festival Song&quot; and the Less Than Jake video for &quot;My Money Is On The Longshot&quot;.

<text>David Haspel Shepard (October 22, 1940 – January 31, 2017) was an American film preservationist whose company, Film Preservation Associates, is responsible for many high-quality video versions of silent films. Some come from the Blackhawk Films library (owned by Shepard) and others from materials owned by private collectors and film archives around the world.

==Biography==
Shepard was born in Manhattan, New York City, the son of Marjorie (née Haspel) and Bertram Shepard. His father was an executive with the Grand Union grocery-store chain, and his mother a homemaker. 
When he was 11 years old his family moved to Tenafly, New Jersey.

As a teenager he filmed school football games for the coaches to study, and in the off-season began to make his own films with student actors. He graduated from Hamilton College, in Clinton, New York, in 1962, with a BA in philosophy, and completed a master&#x27;s degree from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania in 1963.

Shepard began restoring films when he joined the American Film Institute in 1968 as one of their first staff members. In 1987, he bought the Blackhawk Films library.

In December 2016, he suffered pneumonia and kidney disease and was hospitalized. Doctors discovered cancer in his chest and he died on January 31, 2017, in Medford, Oregon.

Most of the collections of David Shepard and Film Preservation Associates are held at the Academy Film Archive as part of the Lobster Film/Film Preservation Associates Collection.

<doc id="1243126" wikidata="Q179169" url="?curid=1243126" title="George Ripley (transcendentalist)">
<text>George Ripley (October 3, 1802 – July 4, 1880) was an American social reformer, Unitarian minister, and journalist associated with Transcendentalism. He was the founder of the short-lived Utopian community Brook Farm in West Roxbury, Massachusetts.

Born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, Ripley was pushed to attend Harvard College by his father and completed his studies in 1823. He went on graduate from the Harvard Divinity School and the next year married Sophia Dana. Shortly after, he became ordained as the minister of the Purchase Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts, where he began to question traditional Unitarian beliefs. He became one of the founding members of the Transcendental Club and hosted its first official meeting in his home. Shortly after, he resigned from the church to put Transcendental beliefs in practice by founding an experimental commune called Brook Farm. The community later converted to a model based on the work of Charles Fourier, although the community was never financially stable in either format.

After Brook Farm&#x27;s failure, Ripley was hired by Horace Greeley at the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. He also published the &quot;New American Cyclopaedia&quot;, which made him financially successful. He built a national reputation as an arbiter of taste and literature before his death in 1880.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Ripley&#x27;s ancestors had lived in Hingham, Massachusetts, for 140 years before Jerome Ripley moved his family to Greenfield, a town in the western part of the state, in 1789. He was moderately successful as the owner of a general store and tavern and was a prominent member of the community. His son George Ripley was born in Greenfield on October 3, 1802, the ninth child in the family.

George Ripley&#x27;s early life was heavily influenced by women. His nearest brother was thirteen years older than he was and he was raised primarily by his conservative mother, who was distantly related to Benjamin Franklin, and his sisters. He was sent to a private academy run by a Mr. Huntington in Hadley, Massachusetts, to prepare for college. Before going to college, he spent three months in Lincoln with Ezra Ripley, a distant relative who also married the aunt of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Although Ripley wanted to attend the religiously conservative Yale University, his Unitarian father pushed him to attend Harvard College, then known as a hotbed of liberal Unitarianism. Ripley was a good and dedicated student, although he was not popular with students because of his trust of the establishment. Early in his time at Harvard, he had sided with the administration during a student-led protest against poor food, and his attempts at reconciling the two sides prompted ridicule from his peers. Ripley, seeking a socially useful role, found work as a teacher in Fitchburg during winter vacation of his senior year. He graduated in 1823.

During his time at the school, Ripley became disenchanted with his father and his home town, admitting &quot;no particular attachment to Greenfield&quot;. He hoped to enroll at Andover but his father convinced him to stay in Cambridge to attend Harvard Divinity School. There, he was influenced by Levi Frisbie, Professor of Natural Religion, who was largely interested in moral philosophy, which he termed &quot;the science of the principles and obligations of duty&quot;. Ripley was becoming very interested in more &quot;liberal&quot; religious views, what he wrote to his mother as &quot;so simple, scriptural, and reasonable&quot;. He graduated in 1826. A year later, on August 22, 1827, he married Sophia Dana, a fact which he originally kept a secret from his parents. He asked his sister Marianne to inform them shortly after.

===Early career===

Ripley was ordained as a minister at Boston&#x27;s Purchase Street Church on November 8, 1826, and became influential in the developing Unitarian religion. These ten years of his tenure there were quiet and uneventful, until March 1836, when Ripley published a long article titled &quot;Schleiermacher as a Theologian&quot; in the &quot;Christian Examiner&quot;. In it, Ripley praised Schleiermacher&#x27;s attempt to create a &quot;religion of the heart&quot; based on intuition and personal communion with God. Later that year, he published a review of British theologian James Martineau&#x27;s &quot;The Rationale of Religious Enquiry&quot; in the same publication. In the review, Ripley charged Unitarian church elders with religious intolerance because they forced the literal acceptance of miracles as a requirement for membership in their church. Andrews Norton, a leading theologian of the day, responded publicly and insisted that disbelief in miracles ultimately denied the truth of Christianity. Norton, formerly Ripley&#x27;s teacher at the Divinity School, had been labeled by many as the &quot;hard-headed Unitarian Pope&quot;, and began his public battle with Ripley in the &quot;Boston Daily Advertiser&quot; on November 5, 1836, in an open letter charging Ripley with academic and professional incompetence. Ripley contended that to insist upon the reality of miracles was to demand material proof of spiritual matters, and that faith needed no such external confirmation; but Norton and the mainstream of Unitarianism found this tantamount to heresy. This dispute laid the groundwork for the separation of a more extreme Transcendentalism from its liberal Unitarian roots. The debate between Norton and Ripley, which earned allies on both sides, continued until 1840.

===Transcendental Club===

Ripley met with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Frederic Henry Hedge, and George Putnam in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on September 8, 1836, to discuss the formation of a new club. Ten days later, on September 18, 1836, Ripley hosted their first official meeting at his house. The group at this first meeting of what would become known as the &quot;Transcendental Club&quot; included Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes Brownson, James Freeman Clarke, and Convers Francis as well as Hedge, Emerson, and Ripley. Future members would include Henry David Thoreau, William Henry Channing, Christopher Pearse Cranch, Sylvester Judd, and Jones Very. Female members included Sophia Ripley, Margaret Fuller, and Elizabeth Peabody. The group planned its meetings for times when Hedge was visiting from Bangor, Maine, leading to the early nickname &quot;Hedge&#x27;s Club&quot;. The name Transcendental Club was given to the group by the public and not by its participants. Hedge wrote: &quot;There was no club in the strict sense ... only occasional meetings of like-minded men and women&quot;, earning the nickname &quot;the brotherhood of the &#x27;Like-Minded&#x27;&quot;. Beginning in 1839, Ripley edited &quot;Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature&quot;: fourteen volumes of translations meant to demonstrate the breadth of Transcendental thoughts.

===Separation from church===

Amid the Panic of 1837, many began to criticize social institutions. That year, Ripley gave a sermon titled &quot;The Temptations of the Times&quot;, suggesting that the major problem in the country was &quot;the inordinate pursuit, the extravagant worship of wealth&quot;. Ripley had been asked by church proprietors to avoid controversial topics in his sermons. He said, &quot;Unless a minister is expected to speak out on all subjects which are uppermost in his mind, with no fear of incurring the charge of heresy or compromising the interests of his congregation, he can never do justice to himself, to his people, or the truth which he is bound to declare&quot;. In May 1840, he offered his resignation from the Purchase Street Church but was convinced to stay. He soon decided he should leave the ministry altogether and, on October 3, 1840, he read a 7,300-word lecture, &quot;Letter Addressed to the Congregational Church in Purchase Street&quot;, expressing his dissatisfaction with Unitarianism.

Because of his experience with the &quot;Specimens&quot; translations, Ripley was chosen to be the managing editor of the Transcendental publication &quot;The Dial&quot; at its inception, working alongside its first editor Margaret Fuller. In addition to overseeing distribution, subscriptions, printing, and finances, Ripley also contributed essays and reviews. In October 1841, he resigned his post with &quot;The Dial&quot; as he prepared for an experiment in communal living. As he told Emerson, although he was happy seeing all the Transcendental thoughts in print, he could not be truly happy &quot;without the attempt to realize them&quot;.

===Brook Farm===

In the late 1830s Ripley became increasingly engaged in &quot;Associationism&quot;, an early Fourierist socialist movement. In October 1840 he announced to the Transcendental Club his plan to form an Associationist community based on Fourier&#x27;s Utopian plans. His goals were lofty. As he wrote, &quot;If wisely executed, it will be a light over this country and this age. If not the sunrise, it will be the morning star.&quot;

Ripley and his wife formed a joint stock company in 1841 along with 10 other initial investors. Shares of the company were sold for $500 apiece with a promise of five percent of the profits to each investor. The founding membership of the original community included Nathaniel Hawthorne. They chose the Ellis Farm in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, as the site of their experiment, which they named Brook Farm. Its were about from Boston; a pamphlet described the land as a &quot;place of great natural beauty, combining a convenient nearness to the city with a degree of retirement and freedom from unfavorable influences unusual even in the country&quot;. The land, however, turned out to be difficult to farm and the community struggled with financial difficulties as it built greenhouses and craft shops.

Brook Farm was initially based mostly on the ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits. The experiment meant to serve as an example for the rest of the world, established on the principles of &quot;industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity&quot;. Many in the community wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, &quot;It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all&quot;. In their free time, the members of Brook Farm enjoyed music, dancing, card games, drama, costume parties, sledding, and skating. Hawthorne, eventually elected treasurer of the community, did not enjoy his experience. He wrote to his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody, &quot;labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified&quot;.

Many outside the community were also critical, especially in the press. The New York &quot;Observer&quot;, for example, suggested that, &quot;The Associationists, under the pretense of a desire to promote order and morals, design to overthrow the marriage institution, and in the place of the divine law, to substitute the &#x27;passions&#x27; as the proper regulator of the intercourse of the sexes&quot;, concluding that they were &quot;secretly and industriously aiming to destroy the foundation of society&quot;.

In 1844, the community, perpetually struggling financially, drafted an entirely new constitution and committed to following more closely the Fourierist model. Not everyone at the community supported the transition, and many left. Many were disappointed that the new, more structured daily routine de-emphasized the carefree leisure time that had been a trademark. Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.

By May 1846, troubled by the financial difficulties at Brook Farm, Ripley had made an informal split from the community. By its closure a year later, Brook Farm had amassed a total debt of $17,445. Ripley was devastated at the failure of his experiment and told a friend, &quot;I can now understand how a man would feel if he could attend his own funeral&quot;. His personal life was also taxed. His wife had converted to Catholicism in 1846, encouraged by Orestes Brownson, and had become doubtful of his Associationist politics; the Ripleys&#x27; relationship became strained by the 1850s.

===Writing===
After Brook Farm, George Ripley began to work as a freelance journalist. In 1849 he was employed by Horace Greeley at the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, taking the role left vacant by Margaret Fuller. Greeley had been a proponent of Brook Farm&#x27;s conversion to Fourierism. Ripley started his role with the &quot;Tribune&quot; at $12 a week and, at this wage, was not able to pay off the debt of Brook Farm until 1862. As a critic, he believed in high moral standards for literature but offered good-natured praise in the majority of his reviews. Greeley took advantage of Ripley&#x27;s cheerful style of writing to boost circulation amid significant competition. Ripley wrote a &quot;Gotham Gossip&quot; column and many articles discussing local personalities and notable public events, including speeches by Henry Clay and Frederick Douglass. He stayed away from philosophy of theology, despite some efforts to persuade him to write on the subject. As he told a friend, he had &quot;long since lost ... immediate interest in that line of speculation&quot;.

Ripley then edited &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Together with Bayard Taylor he compiled a &quot;Handbook of Literature and the Fine Arts&quot; (1852).

With Charles A. Dana, he edited the 16 volume &quot;The New American Cyclopaedia&quot; (1857–1863), reissued as &quot;The American Cyclopaedia&quot; (1873–1876). It sold in the millions and its immediate earnings amounted to over $100,000.

He also continued his critical work and in 1860 reviewed &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; by Charles Darwin. He was one of the few contemporary critics to be sympathetic to Darwin, although he was reluctant to show he was convinced of the theories.

===Later years===

In 1861 Sophia Ripley died. George Ripley remarried, to Louisa Sclossberger, in 1865, and was a part of the Gilded Age New York literary scene for the remainder of his life. Because of his convivial nature, he was careful to avoid the city&#x27;s rampant literary feuds at the time. He became a public figure with a national reputation and, known as an arbiter of taste, he helped establish the National Institute of Literature, Art, and Science in 1869. In his later years, he began suffering frequent illnesses, including a bout with influenza in 1875 which prevented him from traveling to Germany. He also suffered from gout and rheumatism.

Ripley was found dead at his desk on July 4, 1880, slumped over his work. Pallbearers at his funeral included Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard, George William Curtis, and Whitelaw Reid. At the time of his death, Ripley had become financially successful; the &quot;New American Cyclopaedia&quot; had earned him royalties of nearly $1.5 million. A biography entitled &quot;George Ripley&quot; (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., 1882) was written by Octavius Brooks Frothingham.

==Critical assessment==
Ripley built a wide reputation as a critic. Contemporary publications rated him as one of the most important critics of the day, including the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;, the &quot;Springfield Republican&quot;, the New York &quot;Evening Gazette&quot;, and the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot;. Henry Theodore Tuckerman commended Ripley as &quot;a scholar and an aesthetic as well as technical critic: [he] knows public taste and the laws of literature&quot;.

<doc id="1243129" wikidata="Q1302978" url="?curid=1243129" title="Rex Grossman">
<text>Rex Daniel Grossman III (born August 23, 1980) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons, most notably with the Chicago Bears. Grossman played college football for the Florida Gators, where he was named AP College Football Player of the Year and won the 2002 Orange Bowl as a sophomore. He was selected by the Bears in the first round of the 2003 NFL draft.

Grossman&#x27;s most successful season was in 2006 when he helped lead the Bears to a conference title and an appearance in Super Bowl XLI. Due to inconsistent play, Grossman lost his starting position the following season. He spent the remainder of his career mostly as a backup, last playing as a starter with the Washington Redskins in 2011.

==Early life==
Grossman was born in Bloomington, Indiana in 1980, the son of Rex Daniel Grossman II and Maureen Grossman. Under the motivation and guidance of his father, he began playing football at an early age in grade school. He originally started his football career as a running back, and played for a team that was coached by his father. His mother convinced his father to convert him to a quarterback while he was in the sixth grade.

Grossman attended Bloomington High School South, where he played high school football for the Bloomington South Panthers. In three seasons as the Panthers&#x27; quarterback, he threw for 7,518 yards and 97 touchdowns. He threw for 3,080 yards and forty-four touchdowns as a senior in 1998, including a game where he threw six touchdowns. His senior season culminated when he led the Panthers to a 35–14 victory over the Homestead High School Spartans in the Indiana Class 5A state championship game. Grossman completed seventeen of twenty-six pass attempts for 216 yards and five touchdowns, setting an Indiana record for the most touchdowns thrown in a championship game.

Grossman was recognized as the 1998 Indiana Player of the Year by &quot;USA Today&quot;, was ranked among the top fifteen players in the nation by the National Recruiting Advisor, and &quot;Parade&quot; magazine named him to its high school All-America team. He received statewide honors when he was named Indiana&#x27;s Mr. Football later that year. Bloomington High School South retired his jersey in the summer of 2007 to commemorate his success during the Chicago Bears&#x27; 2006 season.

==College career==
Grossman accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Steve Spurrier and coach Ron Zook&#x27;s Florida Gators from 1999 to 2002.

===2000===
After redshirting his freshman year in 1999, Grossman competed for playing time with returning starter Jesse Palmer and the top high school recruit in the country Brock Berlin, in 2000. Grossman started his first game as a Florida Gator on October 7, 2000, against LSU. Grossman had gotten the opportunity to start after completing 13 of 16 pass attempts for 232 yards and two touchdowns against Mississippi State the week before in the Gators&#x27; only SEC conference loss of the season. Grossman solidified his position as Florida&#x27;s starting quarterback during the next two games by throwing for over 500 yards, eight touchdowns and no interceptions in lopsided wins over LSU and Auburn. He led the Gators to the SEC championship and was named Most Valuable Player of the SEC Championship Game. For the season, Grossman completed 61.8 percent of his passes for 1,866 yards, 21 touchdowns, and only seven interceptions. His passer efficiency rating of 161.8 was the third best in NCAA Division I football.

===2001===
Grossman passed for over 300 yards in nine consecutive games during his sophomore season in 2001. He led the nation in passing efficiency, passing completion percentage and yards per attempt. Grossman was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American, was voted the Associated Press Player of the Year, and came in second in the balloting for the 2001 Heisman Trophy in one of the closest Heisman votes in the history of the award. At the time, his 55 touchdown passes through his sophomore season were the most in NCAA history. On October 6, 2001, Grossman passed for 464 yards and five touchdowns as No. 2 Florida defeated the No. 18 LSU Tigers 44–15. In a 2006 interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Grossman cited the victory as his most memorable game as a Gator. He finished second to University of Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch in one of the closest votes in Heisman Trophy history, losing by only 62 votes. He earned accolades as a consensus first-team All-American, the AP National Player-of-the-Year, and finalist for other awards, including the Walter Camp National Player-of-the-Year Award, the Maxwell College Player-of-the-Year Award, and the Davey O&#x27;Brien National Quarterback-of-the-Year Award. He ended his sophomore season with a 56–23 victory over the Maryland Terrapins in the 2002 Orange Bowl.

===2002===
As a junior team captain in 2002, Grossman led the Gators in the famed &quot;Slingin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; game against the Tennessee Volunteers, in which he threw three touchdowns and 22 completions in 32 attempts en route to a 30–13 victory over the Vols. Grossman led the Gators to the 2003 Outback Bowl, where they lost to the Michigan Wolverines 38–30 despite his completing 21 of 41 passes for 323 yards and two touchdowns. After the season was over, Grossman decided to forgo his final year of college eligibility and declared for the NFL draft.

In his three-season college career, Grossman threw for 9,164 yards and seventy-seven touchdowns. He earned a 146.77 passer rating, becoming the third most efficient passer in the Southeastern Conference&#x27;s history. He was twice chosen by his teammates as the Gators&#x27; most valuable player, in 2000 and 2001. In one of a series of articles about the top 100 Gators from the first century of Florida football, &quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; recognized Grossman as the No. 10 all-time Gator in 2006. He was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great&quot; in 2013. Grossman was also inducted into the SEC Football Legends in 2024.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Chicago Bears===
====2003 season====
The Chicago Bears selected Grossman with the 22nd pick of the first round in the 2003 NFL draft. Head coach Dick Jauron kept Grossman sidelined as a rookie in favor of veteran quarterbacks Chris Chandler and Kordell Stewart. Grossman only saw playing time during the later portion of the 2003 season after the Bears had been eliminated from playoff contention. His season ended when he was forced to leave the final game with a broken finger.

====2004 season====
Prior to the start of the 2004 season, the Bears fired Jauron and hired Lovie Smith, who declared Grossman the team&#x27;s starting quarterback. Grossman was criticized when he threw a game-ending interception against the Detroit Lions on opening day. Criticism of his durability intensified when Grossman suffered a season-ending ACL injury during a Week 3 loss to the Minnesota Vikings.

====2005 season====
Grossman missed most of the 2005 season after breaking his ankle in a preseason game. On December 18, 2005, he returned to action in relief of Kyle Orton, leading the Bears to a 16–3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. He completed 11 of 16 passes for 166 yards for a touchdown and interception in a 24–17 victory against the Green Bay Packers during the following week on Christmas Day. The victory enabled the Bears to clinch a playoff berth and the NFC&#x27;s second playoff seed. Grossman struggled to anchor the Bears&#x27; offense in his first career playoff start, completing 17 of 41 passes for 192 yards for one touchdown and an interception in a 29–21 loss against the Carolina Panthers.

====2006 season: Super Bowl run====
During the 2006 season, Grossman became the first Bears quarterback to start all sixteen games since Erik Kramer in 1995. In a season dubbed as a &quot;roller coaster ride&quot; by Grossman himself, the fourth-year quarterback had several productive performances, which were seemingly diluted by a handful of turnover-ridden games, especially in Week 6 against the Arizona Cardinals, where Grossman fumbled twice and threw four interceptions. While earning a passer rating of at least 100 in seven games, he earned a sub 50 rating in five games during the latter portion of the season. Grossman, who was recognized as the NFC Offensive Player of the Month in September, concluded the season&#x27;s final month with a 64.4 passer rating, including a zero rating during the season&#x27;s finale game against the Green Bay Packers. Grossman&#x27;s work ethic drew criticism when he admitted that he was not adequately prepared to play and later claimed the game to be &quot;meaningless.&quot; He later clarified his statement days later and claimed his quote was taken out of context. His inconsistent performance drew criticism, and calls for Smith to bench Grossman in favor of the veteran Brian Griese.

Nevertheless, Smith, who supported Grossman throughout the season, declared that Grossman would remain the Bears&#x27; starting quarterback throughout the playoffs, causing much skepticism within the Chicago area. He temporarily silenced his critics by leading the Bears to a 27–24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks, completing 21 of 38 passes for 282 yards and one interception, fumble, and touchdown. The following week, he led the Bears to a 39–14 victory over the New Orleans Saints, which allowed the Bears to claim the NFC Championship Game and advance to Super Bowl XLI. In the Super Bowl, Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes, including a one-yard touchdown pass. However, he also threw two interceptions, including one that was returned for a touchdown, and fumbled twice due to miscues between him and center Olin Kreutz. The Bears went on to lose to the Indianapolis Colts 29–17. Grossman received the Ed Block Courage Award after the season ended, which is given to one player from every team who exemplifies commitments to the principles of sportsmanship and courage, and is believed to be positive role models to their community.

====2007 season====
Before the 2007 season, Grossman vowed that he would improve his performance by simply &quot;protecting the ball&quot;. Smith named him as the team&#x27;s starting quarterback for the 2007 season, despite inconsistent and lackluster play throughout the preseason. Grossman struggled in his first three outings of the season, and committed ten turnovers with a 45.2 passer rating. After week three, several news sources reported that Smith demoted him in favor of Brian Griese. The official announcement came the next day, when Smith announced that Griese would start in the team&#x27;s next game. On November 11, 2007, Grossman reclaimed his first-string role after a shoulder injury sidelined Griese. Though Grossman only played for roughly one half, he led the Bears to a 17–6 victory over the Oakland Raiders with a 59-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian. After reclaiming his starting role, Grossman threw three touchdowns and one interception over the course of three and a half games. He sustained a knee injury during his fifth consecutive start and was replaced once again by Griese. Grossman was forced to relinquish his starting position to Kyle Orton, who had previously temporarily relieved him after his 2005 preseason injury.

====2008 season====
Grossman became an unrestricted free agent after the 2007 season, but said he wished to return to the Bears. Bears general manager Jerry Angelo said, &quot;We would like to have Rex back in the mix.&quot; He added that Grossman will face additional competition if he returns, emphasizing the team&#x27;s need for a stable passing game. Smith had also voiced similar opinions. Grossman signed a new one-year contract with the Bears on February 23, 2008. Under terms of the deal, Grossman had a $3 million base salary. The Bears also granted Orton a contract extension and planned to have the two compete for a starting position. On August 18, 2008, after two preseason games, Coach Smith named Orton as the team&#x27;s starting quarterback for the 2008 season.

Grossman remained the team&#x27;s back-up quarterback until week nine against the winless Detroit Lions when he was called to replace Orton who left the game due an ankle injury. Grossman completed nine of nineteen passes for 58 yards, including a touchdown and interception. He also scored the game&#x27;s winning touchdown on a quarterback sneak. Grossman was repeatedly jeered by Bears fans over the course of the game. Brian Urlacher defended Grossman after the game, commenting, &quot;We&#x27;ve got a quarterback who comes in off the bench and leads us to a victory, and they boo him right out of the gate. Poor guy. Lucky for him he&#x27;s resilient and he came back and led us to two scoring drives. But man, it&#x27;s tough.&quot; Smith named Grossman the team&#x27;s starting quarterback for the Bears&#x27; next contest against the Tennessee Titans. Grossman threw one touchdown and interception, and also scored a one-yard rushing touchdown, en route to a 21–14 loss. Grossman received his final snaps of the season in the following week, when he was called to relieve Orton in a 37–3 loss to the Green Bay Packers.

===Houston Texans===
Grossman became a free agent on March 1, 2009. Bears head coach Lovie Smith said that Grossman was not in the team&#x27;s plans for the 2009 season. During the offseason, Grossman worked out with the Cincinnati Bengals in March, but was not offered a contract. UFLaccess.com reported that Grossman would be participating in drills in a United Football League &quot;Pro Day&quot;. However, Grossman&#x27;s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, denied these claims, stating that &quot;Rex will be playing in the NFL this season. We have not considered any other leagues. He will be on an NFL roster by the start of training camps.&quot;

On June 12, Grossman came to terms with the Houston Texans and signed a one-year contract, worth $620,000. Grossman beat out Dan Orlovsky during the preseason for the backup quarterback position. Grossman only played in a single game during the 2009 season, temporarily relieving Matt Schaub in a 23–18 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. He threw nine passes for three completions, 33 yards, and one interception.

===Washington Redskins===
====2010 season====
Grossman signed a one-year contract with the Washington Redskins for the 2010 season on March 17, 2010. Grossman made his first appearance for the Redskins against the Detroit Lions on October 31, 2010, but he was sacked and lost a fumble on his first play, which was returned by Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh for a touchdown. On December 17, Redskins coach Mike Shanahan benched Donovan McNabb in favor of Grossman, who had not been a starter since 2008. The Redskins fell behind the Dallas Cowboys early in the game, but Grossman threw for 322 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions to erase a 20-point deficit. The Cowboys still managed to win the game, 33–30. Grossman won his second start with Washington in a close and important game for the Jacksonville Jaguars in Jacksonville.

====2011 season====
On August 2, 2011, Grossman re-signed with the Redskins. At the end of the 2011 pre-season, after a quarterback battle with John Beck, Grossman was chosen to be the opening day starting quarterback of the Redskins. Grossman started the 2011 season with a win against the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants, completing 21 of 34 attempts while throwing for 305 yards and two touchdowns. Grossman would lead the Redskins to a 3–1 start before being benched in a four-interception week 6 performance against the Philadelphia Eagles in favor of Beck. Grossman returned week 10 in a loss to the Miami Dolphins. He led a last-minute touchdown drive the next week to tie the Dallas Cowboys but lost in overtime. He helped the Redskins snap a six-game skid the next week with a 23–17 win over the Seattle Seahawks in which he threw 314 yards, two interceptions, and two touchdowns.

====2012 season====
The Redskins re-signed Grossman to another one-year contract on March 17, 2012. The Redskins drafted Robert Griffin III (second overall) and Kirk Cousins (102nd overall) in the 2012 NFL draft. Grossman became the team&#x27;s third-string quarterback and did not play in a single game for the team in 2012.

====2013 season====
On April 3, 2013, Grossman signed another one-year contract to stay with the Redskins for 2013. He remained the team&#x27;s third-string quarterback and primarily served to advise Griffin III and Cousins.

===Cleveland Browns===

The Cleveland Browns signed Grossman on August 12, 2014 and cut him on August 31. On December 22, the Browns offered Grossman a one-week $53,529 NFL veteran league minimum contract after losing Johnny Manziel and Brian Hoyer to injuries. Grossman passed on the offer in order to spend the holidays in Palm Beach with his family.

===Atlanta Falcons===
On August 26, 2015, Grossman signed a one-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons released him on September 4.

==Playing style==
Grossman&#x27;s gunslinger attitude was illustrated in his desire to throw long passes, similar to his youth idol, Brett Favre. Grossman commented on his non-conservative play style in a 2017 interview stating, &quot;Coach Spurrier instilled in me, don&#x27;t check down if the big play&#x27;s there. So that’s kind of how I was born. I always wanted to shoot a three-pointer in basketball, hit a home run in baseball. I don&#x27;t know why, that&#x27;s just, like, who I am.&quot; During Week 12 of the 2006 season, Grossman threw a game-ending interception while attempting a deep pass to Rashied Davis. However, during a Divisional Round game in the 2006 playoffs, he threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to Berrian on the opening play of the Bears’ second drive.

Grossman&#x27;s ability to elude pursuers and scramble significantly decreased after a season-ending leg injury in 2004. Grossman amassed more rushing yards in three games in 2004 than he did in sixteen games in 2006. He showed his potential to scramble during a game against the St. Louis Rams, after he converted a third and long with a twenty-two-yard run. The run was the longest of Grossman&#x27;s career but it only gave him five net yards for the season at that point.

==Nicknames==
Grossman earned several nicknames over the course of his football career. While at the University of Florida, head coach Steve Spurrier dubbed him &quot;Sexy Rexy.&quot; The nickname earned national recognition when teammate Muhsin Muhammad used the nickname while introducing Grossman during a starting line-up segment on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. Grossman was also infamously known as &quot;Rex Glassman&quot; and &quot;Wrecks Grossman&quot; due to his injury-prone years. After the midpoint of the 2006 season, commentators and fans would refer to Grossman as either &quot;Good Rex&quot; or &quot;Bad Rex&quot; depending on how he performed in a game.

==Family and personal life==
Grossman&#x27;s family has a long football history. His father and grandfather were football players for Indiana University. His grandfather, Rex Sr., also played for the Baltimore Colts (1948–1950) and Detroit Lions (1950), playing in 37 games during his career. Grossman resides in Bloomington, Indiana during the offseason with his wife, Alison Miska, to whom he has been married since July 9, 2005. Grossman also has a sister and nephew who live in Lincolnwood, Illinois, and his parents are friends with Archie Manning.

Grossman has been a longtime admirer of former Packers quarterback, Brett Favre and former Bears quarterback Jim Harbaugh. Grossman was also an avid fan of the Indianapolis Colts and Indiana Pacers fan during his childhood. Outside of football, he enjoys playing basketball and watching movies. He also appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated for Kids&quot;&#x27; February 2007 issue. The cover featured Grossman with teammates Devin Hester and Tommie Harris posing with bears in a museum exhibit.

It was reported that Grossman absorbed a $680,000 loss on his September 2008 purchase of a 36th floor condo in the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower Chicago when it sold in January 2010, losing 25% of his initial investment.

On June 28, 2007, Grossman&#x27;s hometown of Bloomington, Indiana, declared the day &quot;Rex Grossman Day&quot; for his accomplishments in football and the community. Grossman held an annual charity golfing event for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, raising over $100,000 for them.

Grossman and his wife founded Florida Medical Staffing in 2009, a staffing agency for nurses that is based in Delray Beach, Florida.

==NFL career statistics==
The following is a list of Grossman&#x27;s statistics from his regular and postseason games. Grossman has occasionally recorded notable statistics; among all quarterbacks during the 2006 season, Grossman ranked tenth in number of pass attempts, seventh in touchdowns thrown, and third in interceptions. He completed his first full season with a 73.9 quarterback rating. This was better than quarterback ratings of Favre, Peyton Manning, and Terry Bradshaw during their first full seasons; many other quarterbacks have performed similarly or better in their first years, including Grossman&#x27;s former backup Brian Griese. His 23 touchdowns in one season rank Grossman among the best Bears quarterbacks in franchise history. However, his 20 interceptions in one season are among the most thrown by any Bears’ quarterback in almost two decades. The unusual combination ranked Grossman as statistically the most inconsistent quarterback in almost a decade in 2006. Grossman has the NFL record for worst passer rating in a victory with at least 15 passing attempts, recording a 1.3 rating in a 23–13 Chicago Bears win over the Minnesota Vikings on December 3, 2006. In the same year, Grossman became the first quarterback to throw more interceptions than completions in a game with more than 10 passing attempts.

<text>Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT), also known as bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) or natural hormone therapy, is the use of hormones that are identical on a molecular level with endogenous hormones in hormone replacement therapy. It may also be combined with blood and saliva testing of hormone levels, and the use of pharmacy compounding to obtain hormones in an effort to reach a targeted level of hormones in the body. A number of claims by some proponents of BHT have not been confirmed through scientific testing. Specific hormones used in BHT include estrone, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and estriol.

Custom-compounded BHT is a practice almost wholly restricted to the United States and is a form of alternative medicine. It has been promoted as a panacea for many diseases and for relieving the symptoms of menopause beyond the medical objective of reducing the risk of osteoporosis. There is little evidence to support these incremental claims; the hormones are expected to have the same risks and benefits as comparable approved drugs for which there is evidence based on extensive research and regulation, except for progesterone, which may have an improved safety profile than artificial progestogens, though direct comparisons with progestins have not been made. Risks associated with the less-controlled process of compounding bioidentical hormones are not clearly understood. In addition, the accuracy and efficacy of saliva testing have not been definitively proven, and the long-term effects of using blood testing to reach target levels of hormones have not been researched.

The International Menopause Society, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, The Endocrine Society, the North American Menopause Society (NAMS), United States Food and Drug Administration, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Medical Association, American Cancer Society, and the Mayo Clinic have released statements that there is a lack of evidence that the benefits and risks of bioidentical hormones differ from well-studied non-bioidentical counterparts; until such evidence is produced the risks should be treated as if they are similar; and that compounded hormone products may have additional risks related to compounding. A major safety concern in compounded BHT is that there is no requirement to include package inserts, despite the potential for serious adverse effects (including life-threatening adverse effects) associated with HRT, which can harm consumers as they are misled into believing that any hormone-related problems and dangers are exclusively related to non-bioidentical hormones, and that compounded BHT is safe and has no side effects. In reality, the risks of bioidentical hormones have not been studied to the extent of non-bioidentical hormones, so the risks are not well-understood. Regulatory bodies require pharmacies to include important safety information with conventional hormone replacement therapy (CHRT) via package inserts.

==History==
Bioidentical hormones were first used for menopausal symptom relief in the 1930s, after Canadian researcher James Collip developed a method to extract an orally active estrogen from the urine of pregnant women and marketed it as the active agent in a product called Emmenin. It was supplanted on the market when its manufacturer, Ayerst (later Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), began producing the more-easily manufactured equine estrogens in 1941 under the brand name Premarin; by 1992, Premarin was the most widely prescribed drug in the United States.

In the 1970s, research and reports indicating risks from synthetic conjugated estrogens began to appear. Investigations determined that the addition of a progestogen to estrogen treatment reduced the risks. As early as 1980, the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; (now &quot;The BMJ&quot;) recommended oral bioidentical progesterone as an option when side effects from synthetic progestogens otherwise mandated discontinuing treatment. In May 1998 the FDA approved Prometrium, an oral bioidentical progesterone product produced by Solvay Pharmaceutical.

Physicians John R. Lee and Jonathan Wright were pioneers in the field of BHT. Lee authored several popular books on BHT and promoted custom-compounded BHT, with the goal of achieving what he called a &quot;natural hormone balance&quot;. He based this goal on the clinical testing of saliva to establish where &quot;deficiencies&quot; existed, though agencies such as the FDA and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists state that blood and saliva testing is unreliable and biologically meaningless. Lee also believed that progesterone acted as a panacea and general health tonic for many health conditions, basing his claims on anecdotal data rather than peer-reviewed research, which has not been supported by any clinical trials. Wright also authored a popular book on BHT. Compared to previous bioidentical formulas that only used estradiol, he promoted a triple-estrogen formula called Triest, which combined three estrogens found in human females: estriol, estradiol and estrone. It was based on an unpublished study whose conclusions did account for how estrogens are processed and excreted in the body—particularly how the liver processes oral estrogens, converting most of them to estrone. No follow-up was performed by Wright to replicate these observations. Wright may have been the first proponent of BHT to use the term &quot;bioidentical&quot;—the word he coined to describe unpatentable, plant-derived molecules he believed were identical to human hormones. However, no structural crystallographic evidence has been used to support the idea that these molecules are identical to endogenous human hormones. When the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative&#x27;s reports on the unappreciated risks of equine estrogens were released, many prescribers of BHT used Wright&#x27;s assertions (and his terminology) to proclaim the superiority of bioidentical molecules despite a lack of scientifically supported evidence. Following the publication of a popular book written by Suzanne Somers in 2006, the term &quot;bioidentical&quot; gained more prominence in popular consciousness as a &quot;poorly understood new adjective&quot; regarding hormone replacement therapy.

==Terminology==
There is no single definition for the term &quot;bioidentical hormone replacement therapy&quot;; it is generally used to refer to 17β-estradiol, but other uses include plant-based or compounded estrogen products that blend estradiol with estriol and sometimes with estrone. A &quot;bioidentical hormone&quot; is defined as a molecule identical to a hormone produced by the human body (though not all allegedly bioidentical hormones sold by custom-compounding pharmacies are necessarily molecularly identical to endogenous humans). The FDA considers BHT as currently used by BHT advocates to be a marketing term, not a scientific term, and does not recognize its use. The meaning of &quot;plant-derived&quot; has also been attached to the term &quot;bioidentical&quot;, and it may also mean that the hormones are &quot;natural&quot;; throughout the 1990s plant-derived, compounded hormones were referred to as &quot;natural hormone therapy&quot;. However, the term &quot;natural&quot; can be applied to all products where the principal ingredient originates from an animal, plant, or mineral source, and both bioidentical and non-bioidentical hormones can be produced from the same plant sources.

BHT is often used to refer to a set of diagnostic, prescribing, preparation and marketing practices including compounding, saliva testing, and an emphasis on countering the effects of aging rather than relieving the symptoms of menopause. This compounded BHT package has been promoted by Somers, Oprah Winfrey, and other proponents as safer and more effective than CHRT, though there is no evidence to support these claims. Compounded BHT has been marketed on the internet by pharmacies that make unfounded claims for its safety and its effectiveness for a variety of conditions.

There are a variety of FDA-approved products, made using bioidentical estrogens and micronized progesterone, used to treat the symptoms of menopause:

The term &quot;synthetic&quot; is also used incorrectly in two ways: to refer to the process used to manufacture all estrogens, including bioidentical estrogens, and to compounds that interact with estrogen receptors similarly to estrogen molecules but are not found in nature. Examples of the latter two include diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol.

==Uses==
BHT is used to reduce the symptoms of menopause. It is also promoted by some practitioners for anti-aging purposes providing benefits beyond menopausal symptom relief, such as improving quality of life, though there is little evidence to support these claims.

==Components and compounding==
Compounded preparations of bioidentical hormones usually include estriol, estrone, estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, and sometimes dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), either individually or combined. They are promoted as natural, safer and (in some cases) more efficacious than CHT; however, there are no scientific studies to support claims of superiority of BHT over CHRT. Estimates from sales of bulk hormones for compounding suggest that more than one million women may be using compounded BHT in the United States. Bioidentical hormones are expected to have the same risks as conventional hormones made with the same categories of hormones.

===Estrogens===
In premenopausal women the majority of estrogen produced by the body is estradiol (produced primarily in the ovaries), while in postmenopausal women estrone (produced in fat cells) is the type of primary estrogen present; however, the body is able to convert one type of estrogen into another to a certain extent. Because of the limited research into potency, delivery methods, and conversion of the various estrogens, a valid scientific understanding of compounded estrogen products has not been achieved. Synthetic estradiol, taken orally, decomposes when absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and delivers bioidentical estradiol to the bloodstream.

The hormone estriol, produced during pregnancy, is frequently compounded into bioidentical preparations in the United States. While some think it to be a weaker estrogen, with a more limited period of effectiveness than estradiol, it has been demonstrated to be a stronger estrogen in certain ways. Though initial research in the 1970s suggested possible use, follow-up studies have failed to confirm this potential. Estriol is not found in any FDA-approved drug, and its safety and effectiveness as a hormone supplement is unknown.

Estriol was part of the United States Pharmacopeia before FDA approval was needed for its use. Its approval was grandfathered in by the FDA until 2008 when the agency banned its use, stating that manufacturers of estriol would have to create a new application and estriol would be treated as a new drug. Its use is not approved by Health Canada; estriol is not available as a pharmaceutical preparation in Canada or the United States, but is a commonly prescribed conventional treatment in other countries and is available as a cream or vaginal suppository in the United Kingdom and the European Union. Estradiol is available as brand-name products in both oral and transdermal forms.

===Progesterone===
Progesterone is used both orally and transdermally. Oral progesterone is micronized (ground) to increase availability and is approved by the FDA to treat endometrial hyperplasia when used in opposition to estrogen. It has also been approved to relieve menopausal symptoms, either alone or in combination with estrogen. It is more reliable in treating menopausal sleep disorders than synthetic progestins. Transdermal progesterone is often used as a component of compounded BHT but has not been clinically proven to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, as oral progesterone has. The editors-in-chief of the scientific journal &quot;Climacteric&quot; state that the greatest difference in function between bioidentical and synthetic hormones may be found in progesterone&#x27;s behavior compared with progestin. Laboratory studies have suggested that bioidentical progesterone binds primarily to progesterone receptors, while synthetic progestins activate other receptors with a variety of effects. The editors suggested that progesterone may have neutral to positive effects on the cardiovascular system, and induce apoptosis in breast epithelial cells. These compounds have not been directly compared with each other in appropriate scientific tests, though as of 2010 trials had begun. Progesterone is approved for use by both the FDA and Health Canada as a brand-name oral preparation. The French epidemiological study &quot;Etude Epidemiologique aupres de femmes de l&#x27;Education Nationale&quot; suggested micronized progesterone may offer a reduced risk of breast cancer compared to other progestins, though large-scale clinical trials have not been conducted. A 2012 practice advisory published by &quot;Canadian Family Physician&quot; concluded &quot;there is no convincing evidence that bioidentical hormones are safer or more effective than synthetic HRT&quot;.

===Other hormones===
Testosterone supplementation can improve libido in postmenopausal women, but can also reduce levels of high-density lipoproteins. Commercial sources for testosterone for women in the United States are limited and include the estrogen-testosterone mixture Estratest; compounding pharmacies are the main source of testosterone-only preparations for women. A testosterone patch has been approved for use in the United Kingdom and European Union, but in Canada and the United States there is no long-term safety data on it.

DHEA is an androgen precursor that lacks FDA and Health Canada approval for use in women, and is not available in Canada as a pharmaceutical preparation; it is sold as an over-the-counter drug or incorporated into compounded preparations in the United States. In the body, it can be converted into testosterone then estrogen; there are no consistent scientific findings or safety information supporting its use. High levels of DHEA have been linked to breast cancer.

===Compounding===
Compounding pharmacies use commercially available bulk drugs to create new formulations which differ in form or dosage from those manufactured on a large scale by pharmaceutical companies. Custom-compounded BHT is almost wholly restricted to the United States, where pharmacy compounding is governed at the state level while the FDA has regulatory authority over the compounded product. Some internet-based compounding pharmacies understate harm and claim benefits of compounded BHT beyond what can be proven by evidence-based medicine, and many of their claims exceed those made by other BHT practitioners.

==Adverse effects==
BHT benefits and adverse effects are expected to be the same for bioidentical and synthetic hormones. Dosages used in BHT can be as high as ten times the oral dose provided by comparable HRT regimens; the hormones used are known to adversely impact biological markers of cardiovascular disease and may produce a substantially higher risk of heart attack or stroke. There are potentially serious adverse effects and important safety information that is required to be given with FDA approved HRT as package inserts; however, they are typically not given (or required) with compounded bioidentical preparations, which has caused consumers to falsely assume that bioidenticals are safer than FDA-approved hormones or lack any adverse effects—one of the concerns expressed about the hormones. BHT has also been associated with endometrial cancer.

===Estrogens===
Less common (but serious) side effects of all post-menopausal estrogens include increased risk or severity of breast, ovarian or uterine cancer; stroke; heart attack; blood clots; dementia; gallbladder disease; high blood pressure, liver problems; high blood sugar, fluid retention, enlargement of benign tumors (fibroids) of the uterus; a spotty darkening of the skin, especially on the face (melasma); and vaginal yeast infection.

====Estradiol====
Estradiol only recommended for use for the shortest period of time and at the lowest effective dose due to its adverse-effects profile. There is the potential for a range of adverse effects in breasts, skin, eyes, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary or central nervous systems.

===Progesterone===
Progesterone can cause the emergence (or significant worsening) of abdominal pain, constipation, yeast infections, breast cancer, cystitis, acne, conjunctivitis, thrombotic disorders resulting in pulmonary embolus, strokes or heart attacks, epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. Psychiatric reactions can include emotional instability, depression, aggression, decreased libido, and drowsiness. Adverse effects can also occur in the urinary, central or peripheral nervous, or musculoskeletal systems. A review of clinical trials studying bioidentical progesterone use found that it was ineffective in managing vasomotor symptoms of menopause, but had mild and self-limiting side effects.

==Administration==
Hormones can be administered in a variety of ways, including percutaneous skin and vaginal creams, oral pills, topical gels, vaginal rings and tablets, and transdermal patches. Although all preparations of a given type of estrogen may be molecularly identical before their introduction into the human body, estrogens administered orally are modified by the liver before entering the bloodstream and most of it is converted to estrone; estrogen bypassing the digestive tract and liver via the skin is not converted to a new form before entering the bloodstream. Creams and gels applied to the skin also enter the blood directly and without modification but absorption of the gels, creams, and patches can vary from application to application, depending on the temperature and condition of the skin.

==Criticisms==
Advocates for BHT have claimed that commonly compounded BHT preparations are not commercially available, but there are many FDA-approved hormone preparations containing bioidentical molecules available both as proprietary or generic brands. The exception is estriol, used in the compounded bioidentical preparations Triest and Biest—in 2008, the FDA banned estriol until a New Drug Application was completed; these preparations are not approved by the FDA or Health Canada. Some advocates of compounding have also claimed that customized compounding provides customized results, but the claim is weak since compounding is aimed at producing a single hormone profile with absolute blood or saliva levels—which has not been demonstrated to be better than CHRT—and does not consider the rate at which individuals will differ in the activity, metabolism and excretion of the hormones. There have been no clinical trials directly comparing the effectiveness or efficacy of bioidentical versus non-bioidentical compounds.

A 2010 article published in &quot;The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics&quot; concluded that &quot;[t]here is no acceptable evidence that &#x27;bioidentical&#x27; hormones are safe or effective. Patients should be discouraged from taking them.&quot;

===Salivary testing and compounding===
BHT is frequently associated with the testing of saliva to establish a baseline hormone level and compounding of the substances by pharmacists (according to a doctor&#x27;s advice) to produce preparations (and blood levels) of hormones that are specific to each patient. There is no research demonstrating any benefit to either of these practices. Although promoters of BHT claim that saliva testing can be used to customize hormone levels for individuals, and tests are used to determine which hormones are supposed to be deficient and require supplementation, there is no scientific basis to support the use of saliva testing. Estrogens are secreted in pulses within and over days, resulting in varying levels in saliva. Certain compounding formulations also attempt to use a single profile for all women, with no evidence that a specific profile is beneficial in all cases and no recognition that women differ in their sensitivity to hormones and metabolic rate. Testing-based customizing also does not account for much of the effects, and synthesis of hormones occurs within tissues rather than in the blood, so blood or saliva hormone levels may not necessarily reflect the actual biological activity. Other concerns include lack of evidence that samples are stable during storage and transportation, poor replication of results and considerable variation among assays. There are also no studies that link symptoms with blood or saliva hormone levels. The FDA recommends adjusting hormone therapy to the symptoms of the patient, and that there is no reason to adjust the dosing or monitor patients receiving BHT. BHT skeptics have also pointed out that there is no certainty regarding hormone levels in the body. The North American Menopause Society has supported warnings about the potential harm BHT could cause, as it unnecessarily compounds drugs that are already FDA-approved in ways that lack an evidence base of safety or harm. The warnings are supported by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

Although promoted as a way of customizing treatment, hormone therapy does not require customization; the use of testing to determine the number of hormones administered could result in the dose being higher than the minimum recommended level to alleviate symptoms, or the administration of unnecessary hormones to asymptomatic women may result in greater risks to the patient. Analysis of the material used to promote BHT suggests that rather than basing hormone doses on saliva results, practitioners are adjusting dosage based on symptoms. Different bioidentical preparations result in mixtures with different strengths, and practitioners using compounded formulations may be unaware of the total dose of hormones their patients receive. In a 2001 test of compounded bioidentical hormone products, the FDA found that 10 out of 29 products failed their quality tests; nine out of ten failed potency tests (comparable rates for drug manufacturers were less than 2% and 0.13%, respectively). A 2006 test found potency levels ranging from 67.5% to 268.4% of the potency specified on the label; some samples were mixtures of different hormones with some being above, and others below, the specified potency. The failure of potency testing could be problematic and dangerous for progesterone products, where specific levels of progesterone are required to protect the endometrium against precancerous hyperplasia.

Boothby, Doering, and Kipersztok summarize the issue as being a poor effort to apply principles of pharmacokinetics to achieve individualized dosing for drugs that do not require it.

Saliva testing has not been shown to accurately measure blood-bound hormone levels. The FDA recommends the lowest dose of hormones that effectively relieve symptoms and does not recommend custom compounding, blood or saliva testing.

===Lack of evidence for claims===
Bioidentical hormones have been advertised, marketed and promoted as a risk-free panacea that is safer than standard HRT. Literature reviews by private practitioners who sell bioidentical preparations suggest benefits and advantages of BHT over its conventional counterpart, but there is skepticism over claims made about BHT; there is no peer-reviewed evidence that compounded bioidentical hormones are safer or more effective than FDA-approved formulations or that they carry less risk. The hormones are expected to carry the same risks as their conventional counterparts, while the risks of including estriol—a hormone normally produced in large amounts only in pregnant women—have not been studied. The United States FDA warned that claims about compounded BHT products are unsupported by medical evidence. Bioidentical hormones have been described as a form of marketing; the chief medical editor of &quot;Endocrine Today&quot; called compounded BHT a &quot;marketing concept&quot; with no scientific backing, and the FDA warned that pharmacies use these terms to imply that the drugs are natural and have the same effects as endogenous hormones. Other claims include compounded BHT&#x27;s ability to prevent or treat conditions such as heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, endometrial and breast cancer; fewer side effects; and custom blending to uniquely address individuals. There is no credible evidence to support these claims. Bioidentical hormones and compounded BHT are expected to have the same risks and benefits as CHRT; the latter benefits from years of study and regulation, while compounded BHT has no scientific data to support claims of superior safety or efficacy. The following specific claims have been made for the efficacy of bioidentical hormones and compounded BHT, with varying evidence to support or contradict them:

In 2006, Somers released the book &quot;Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones&quot; endorsing the use of bioidentical hormones. The book was criticized by a group of doctors who (though generally supportive of BHT) state that more research is required, and object to protocols mentioned in the book—because of their potential danger and the promoters&#x27; lack of qualifications. Somers&#x27; book may have increased awareness of the existence of BHT for a growing number of menopausal women, but also may have caused confusion by making unsubstantiated claims for BHT and referring to bioidentical hormones as non-drug products with fewer risks. Bioidentical hormones have also been discussed on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, with Somers as a guest.

Michael Cirigliano and Judi Chervenak have stated in reviews of the literature on BHT that large-scale, peer-reviewed studies should be used to establish the safety, efficacy and beliefs about the use of bioidentical hormones. Two 2008 studies conducted in France found that estradiol plus micronized progesterone did not increase the incidence of breast cancer, while a comparison of estradiol plus different types of progestins found a reduced risk of invasive breast cancer with micronized progesterone. Christine Derzko stated that the evidence supported the use of bioidentical estrogen plus progesterone, but since the trial was an observational cohort study rather than a randomized controlled trial that compared different types of hormones head-to-head, more data was required before concluding bioidentical hormones were safer and preferred. Derzko concluded that there was weak (but promising) preliminary evidence that bioidentical hormones may present equal (or possibly lower) risks than conventional HRT; however, there was no data supporting the use of compounding. Derzko recommended following evidence-based medicine and cited concerns over BHT by numerous medical organizations—requirements for oversight over compounding, black box warnings for all bioidentical products, and the establishment of mandatory adverse-events registry.

M. Sarah Rosenthal, Director of the University of Kentucky Program for Bioethics and Patients&#x27; Rights, has stated that she believes BHT is an experimental therapy that is often prescribed by practitioners who sell the products, and are thus in an unethical position of conflict of interest. Rosenthal has also described problematic issues with BHT including patients receiving information from popular books while lacking the scientific literacy to separate rhetoric from evidence about hormone replacement, illegitimate claims of a &quot;big pharma&quot; conspiracy to suppress bioidentical prescribing, the extra and unnecessary cost of the products that are often not covered by insurance plans, and the inaccurate depiction of bioidentical prescribing as &quot;cutting edge science&quot; rather than unproven alternative medicine.

===&quot;Natural&quot; claims===
Bioidentical hormones are frequently marketed as being &quot;natural&quot;, or more natural than conventional HRT. The term &quot;natural&quot; can be used to suggest or emphasize a variety of different ideas—similarity with endogenous hormones, extraction from a plant-based source, and that the hormones are not manufactured or synthesized.
* Endogeny: this meaning of &quot;natural&quot; implies that the hormones are molecularly identical to those found within the body. However, BHT is unnatural as it opposes the biologically determined declining levels of fertility hormones in aging women and medicalizes a stage of human life that is probably normal. Most of the conjugated equine estrogens extracted from pregnant horse urine (such as Premarin) are converted to human estrogens once they enter the body. However, not all are converted, and BHT advocates allege that the small amount that is not converted may have some harmful effects. This is still being studied.
* Plant-derived: Women who purchase compounded BHT are more likely to associate &quot;natural&quot; with the idea that the hormones are derived from plant sources. However, both bioidentical and non-bioidentical hormones are sourced from the same plants, generally soy beans or yams.
* Manufacturing: both bioidentical and non-bioidentical hormones are synthesized using the same chemical precursors; diosgenin is extracted from soy or yam plants, converted into progesterone and used as a hormone chemical precursor to create the final product. &quot;Natural&quot; is also used to promote the idea of being unmodified, and containing the &quot;goodness&quot; of a pure substance. However, this argument simultaneously draws upon a scientific discourse and methodology; even hormones called &quot;bioidentical&quot; have been heavily processed and converted in a pharmaceutical lab. Premarin (conjugated estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant horses) contains the only truly &quot;natural&quot; hormones—natural in the sense of being completely unmodified beyond blending the estrogens to achieve a specific ratio.

The monthly newsletter &quot;Harvard Women&#x27;s Health Watch&quot;, published by Harvard Medical School, states that &quot;natural&quot; does not automatically mean &quot;safe&quot;, and that it can be used to indicate any product with an animal, plant, or mineral source—including hormones that are not bioidentical (such as Premarin), as well as the molecules extracted from soybean and yam sources used in many bioidentical and non-bioidentical commercial preparations.

===Cost===
Compounded BHT may be more expensive than conventional, FDA-approved HRT, and is often not covered by health insurance.

==Safety==
Bioidentical hormones are expected to carry the same risks and benefits as their non-bioidentical counterparts, but there have been no studies that directly compare compounded bioidentical hormones with their non-bioidentical counterparts. Hormones—as used in CHRT—have been studied for years and their risk, benefit, and effectiveness profiles are known and demonstrated through considerable research.

In 2002, the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative study (WHI) that was designed to demonstrate additional benefits of conventional hormone therapy (study participants were given Prempro or a placebo) was terminated prematurely after preliminary data indicated small increases in the risks of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke in older women using Prempro. Its early termination and the subsequent publicity about these previously unappreciated risks led to a decline in prescriptions for CHRT. The results from the study were used by BHT prescribers to promote bioidentical hormones as safer than the FDA-regulated preparations despite a lack of evidence; according to the FDA, the results found by the study apply to all estrogens. BHT has since been strongly promoted as a natural alternative with fewer risks than CHRT, though there is no evidence to support this claim. BHT practitioners recommend compounded products due to their claim that they more closely mimic the composition and ratio of circulating hormones in a woman&#x27;s body than do commercially manufactured products.

The Endocrine Society issued a position statement that bioidentical hormones carry essentially the same risks and benefits as non-bioidentical molecules. In February 2009 the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reiterated its position (from November 2005) that there are no proven benefits in regard to the safety or efficacy of compounded bioidentical hormones, nor are there any benefits in salivary testing of hormone levels or customized dosing of hormones. The Mayo Clinic states that there is no evidence that pharmacy-compounded BHT is safer or more effective than conventional hormone replacement, and that some bioidentical hormones are already available in certain FDA-approved products. The American Cancer Society also stated that &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;bioidentical&quot; hormones present the same risks as synthetic hormone replacement therapy such as heart disease, blood clots, strokes and an increased risk of breast cancer with long-term use.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned several pharmacies about making unsubstantiated claims about the safety and effectiveness of compounded hormone products. The North American Menopause Society has stated that compounded bioidentical hormones have not been approved by the FDA; there is no guarantee of purity, potency, efficacy or safety, and they may contain unknown contaminants. The Australian Menopause Society has similarly stated that there is no evidence that bioidentical hormones administered using lozenges are any safer than their approved counterparts. The International Menopause Society has stated &quot;There are no medical or scientific reasons to recommend unregistered &#x27;bioidentical hormones&#x27;. The measurement of hormone levels in the saliva is not clinically useful. These &#x27;customized&#x27; hormonal preparations have not been tested in studies and their purity and risks are unknown.&quot;

In November 2006, the American Medical Association adopted a policy requesting that the FDA better monitor and regulate bioidentical hormones, releasing an editorial stating that compounded bioidentical molecules were expected to have the same risks as conventional hormones until proven otherwise.

Deborah Moskowitz published an article suggesting that some forms of bioidentical hormones may be safer than non-bioidentical hormones in safety and effectiveness, though this review was criticized for &quot;[attempting] to demonstrate that BHT has a good safety profile, but the data presented only serve to demonstrate similar risks to conventional HRT.&quot;

Quackwatch recommends against the use of bioidentical hormones due to lack of quality control over compounding, posing the same risks as conventional hormones, the use of unnecessary saliva testing, and including the non-FDA-approved hormone estriol. Stephen Barrett, the site&#x27;s owner, concludes his review with: &quot;The bottom line for consumers is very simple: Steer clear of anyone who prescribes &quot;bioidentical&quot; hormones or recommends saliva testing as the basis for evaluating hormone status.&quot;

==Regulatory status in the United States==
Compounded BHT is used almost exclusively in the United States, and many FDA-approved formulations that are wholly or partially made of bioidentical hormones are available. Topical hormone preparations such as progesterone, estrogen and DHEA creams can be purchased in stores or over the internet and are not regulated by the FDA, as they are generally considered cosmetic.

When prescribed by a licensed practitioner, the compounding of bioidentical hormones is controlled by the state pharmacy boards rather than the FDA, and pharmacists are permitted to adjust dose and delivery method according to the prescription. However, the FDA does have authority over the compounded product. In 2001 the FDA surveyed a limited number of compounded preparations, including eight hormone compounds. All three estradiol products passed every test; however, two out of five progesterone products failed at least one test of potency, content or uniformity.

In October 2005 Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer of both FDA-approved bioidentical and non-bioidentical HRT preparations, filed a citizen petition with the FDA asking for enforcement action against compounding pharmacies that dispensed BHT and to investigate labelling and advertising guidelines. Soon after, the FDA took a number of enforcement actions against several (primarily Internet-based) pharmacies that were producing compounded BHT and in 2008, banned the use of estriol in the US. The FDA stated that it did not take these regulatory actions against compounded bioidentical hormones in response to Wyeth&#x27;s request, since that is not the purpose of a citizen petition. They said that they had an ongoing investigation when they received the petition. The FDA ordered pharmacies to discontinue use of estriol. The agency&#x27;s Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance stated that the use of estriol would require a permit for research and a new drug application. The FDA also stated that it has not approved any drug containing estriol and that no information had been submitted to the FDA regarding its safety and effectiveness. The FDA&#x27;s concerns over the marketing and use of bioidentical hormones were supported by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. In response to the FDA&#x27;s actions, the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists began a letter-writing campaign to the FDA to reverse this action, citing Wyeth&#x27;s attempt as a &quot;self-serving, and at times duplicitous, campaign to restrict patients&#x27; access to alternatives to its own products&quot;.

In November 2006, the American Medical Association adopted a policy urging the FDA to survey compounded BHT products for purity and dosage; to maintain a registry and require mandatory adverse event reporting by manufacturers and compounding pharmacies related to bioidentical hormones; to mandate the inclusion of uniform patient information, including warnings and precautions regarding bioidentical products; and to prohibit the use of the term &quot;bioidentical hormones&quot; unless the agency has approved the preparation.

On July 18, 2008, a US Appeals Court issued a ruling stating that new drug approval processes should not be applied to compounded drugs that complied with established guidelines, and also that provisions of the regulations relevant to the use of estriol were still in effect, preventing the FDA from taking action against pharmacies using estriol in compounded products.

==Wiley Protocol==
The Wiley Protocol is a version of compounded BHT endorsed by T. S. Wiley. Its goal is to produce serum levels of estradiol and progesterone that are identical to those of a young woman with a normal menstrual cycle. It has been criticized for a variety of reasons.

<text>Brian Urlacher (; born May 25, 1978) is an American former professional football linebacker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons with the Chicago Bears. He played college football for the New Mexico Lobos, where he received consensus All-American honors as a senior, and was selected ninth overall by the Bears in the 2000 NFL draft.

Urlacher quickly established himself as one of the NFL&#x27;s most productive defensive players, winning the NFL Rookie of the Year Award. During his career, he was selected to eight Pro Bowls, recognized as a first-team All-Pro four times, and won NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2005. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2017 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Early life==
Urlacher was born to Bradley and Lavoyda Urlacher in Pasco, Washington, and his parents raised him with his younger brother Casey Urlacher. After his parents separated, Lavoyda raised Urlacher and his siblings in Lovington, New Mexico. He spent his youth immersed in sports, and developed an interest in football, basketball, track, and later table tennis; he graduated from Lovington High School in 1996. While his mother worked several jobs to keep her family afloat, Urlacher spent his teenage years playing sports for Lovington High School and training in weight rooms.

As he progressed through high school, Urlacher gained experience in all three phases of football. He saw playing time as a running back, wide receiver, return specialist, and defensive back. Urlacher led the Lovington High School Wildcats to an undefeated 14–0 season, and a division 3-A state championship in 1995. He finished the season with twelve touchdown receptions, six touchdown returns, and two rushing touchdowns. He additionally received state-recognized honors in football, as well as basketball. Lovington has since recognized Urlacher&#x27;s accomplishments by retiring his high-school jersey number, and naming a holiday after him.

Urlacher wanted to attend Texas Tech University, but the school did not offer him an athletic scholarship.

==College career==
Urlacher enrolled at the University of New Mexico, majored in criminology, and played for the Lobos. Their head coach, Dennis Franchione, converted Urlacher to linebacker, but often left him on the sidelines in favor of more experienced players. The team finished with winning records during Urlacher&#x27;s first two years and made a trip to the 1997 Insight.com Bowl. The team&#x27;s success prompted Franchione to leave New Mexico in favor of Texas Christian University. His departure prompted the school to hire Rocky Long, a former coach at UCLA.

Urlacher flourished under Long&#x27;s tenure. Urlacher not only received more playing time, but also played a more versatile role on both offense and defense. Long converted Urlacher into a &quot;Lobo-Back&quot;, a cross between a linebacker and free safety, and placed him in a 3–3–5 defense scheme. He spent significant time training with the team&#x27;s defensive coordinator, Bronco Mendenhall, who helped Urlacher refine his skills as a defensive back. Long also used Urlacher as a return specialist and wide receiver throughout his final two years with the Lobos. Despite Long&#x27;s extensive changes to the team&#x27;s roster, formations, and work ethic, the Lobos&#x27; performance declined. However, Urlacher became one of the team&#x27;s most productive players during this time. He finished his career with 442 tackles, three interceptions, 11 sacks, and 11 forced fumbles. Outside of defense, he made seven receptions for 61 yards and six touchdowns as a wide receiver, and had 19 returns for 290 yards as a kick returner.

After the 1999 season, he was one of the finalists for the Jim Thorpe Award, and finished twelfth on the Heisman Trophy ballot. Urlacher received All-American honors from Walter Camp, Football Writers Association of America, and the Associated Press. He played his final collegiate game at the 2000 Senior Bowl, where he was one of the game&#x27;s top players. Urlacher led the nation with 178 tackles during his junior year, and also set a school record for most tackles in a single season. He finished with the third most career tackles in the University of New Mexico&#x27;s history. The school has honored Urlacher on several occasions. They awarded him with the Male Athlete of the Year Award in 2000, and held a special halftime ceremony to honor his success in 2006. Urlacher was also the first person to be inducted into the University of New Mexico&#x27;s Football Wall of Fame. On November 9, 2013, during halftime of New Mexico&#x27;s game against Air Force, the school retired Urlacher&#x27;s No. 44 jersey. Urlacher was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame on December 5, 2017.

==Professional career==
===NFL Draft===

Urlacher was considered one of the most talented collegiate prospects in the 2000 NFL draft, and impressed spectators and analysts at the NFL Scouting Combine by bench pressing 225 pounds twenty-seven times and completing the forty-yard dash in 4.57 seconds. The Chicago Bears, who needed a defensive playmaker after having the 29th ranked defense in 1999, selected Urlacher in the first round as the ninth overall pick.

===2000–2004===
He signed a five-year contract, which was worth nearly eight million dollars with a five and a half million dollar signing bonus, within two months of the draft. Dick Jauron, who was then the Bears head coach, recognized Urlacher&#x27;s versatility as a middle and outside linebacker, and appointed him as the team&#x27;s starting strongside linebacker. However, Urlacher struggled to perform consistently in his first game, and lost his starting position to Rosevelt Colvin. Jauron left Urlacher on the sidelines during the following week, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers shut out the Bears, 41–0.

He managed to regain a starting spot on the Bears roster after Barry Minter, the team&#x27;s veteran middle linebacker, was forced to miss the Week 3 game on account of an injury. Urlacher excelled at the middle linebacker position, and recorded 46 tackles, six sacks, and one interception in his next five starts. He suffered a rib cage injury during this period but still won the league&#x27;s Rookie Defensive Player of the Month in October. He led the Bears with 124 tackles and eight sacks, both of which surpassed the franchise&#x27;s previous rookie records. Although the Bears finished with a disappointing 5–11 record, Urlacher received a number of individual accolades for his performance during the season. Many news organizations, such as the &quot;Associated Press&quot; and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named him as the 2000 Defensive Rookie of the Year. Football fans across the nation also voted Urlacher to play at the 2001 Pro Bowl as an alternate middle linebacker. Urlacher&#x27;s successful rookie campaign served as the foundation for his professional career and reputation.

Urlacher became one of the Bears&#x27; most productive playmakers during the 2001 season. He had one of the best games of his career on October 7 against the Atlanta Falcons in which he held Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, who was well known for his scrambling abilities, to just 18 rushing yards. He also recorded a forced fumble and sack, and returned one of Vick&#x27;s fumbles for a 90-yard touchdown. Two weeks later, Urlacher helped set up a Bears comeback victory against the San Francisco 49ers by intercepting a pass, and later setting up a game-winning touchdown return for Mike Brown, after causing 49ers wide receiver Terrell Owens to lose control of a pass. He also caught a touchdown pass from punter Brad Maynard off a fake field goal attempt against the Washington Redskins in Week 14, which clinched a first-round bye. Urlacher concluded the season with three interceptions, six sacks, and was a candidate for 2001 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award. &quot;Football Digest&quot; named Urlacher their publication&#x27;s defensive player of the year. The 2001 Chicago Bears won 13 games, marking the team&#x27;s best finish since 1986, but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Divisional Playoffs.

The Bears&#x27; 2001 winning season would be followed by three straight losing seasons. As a result, the Bears fired Jauron and hired Lovie Smith before the 2004 NFL season. After the Bears started the season on the lower rungs of the NFC North, Urlacher suffered several injuries that sidelined him for a majority of the season.

===2005–2011===
In 2005, Urlacher won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year after playing for a defensive team that allowed the fewest points per game, and created the most turnovers in the National Football Conference. Urlacher himself recorded at least 10 tackles in six consecutive games, while finishing the season with a team high 121 tackles. He was also credited as one of the team&#x27;s leaders, whose audibles and experience helped develop several younger teammates. Urlacher led the Bears to an 11–5 record, marking their best finish since 2001. Urlacher played his second career playoff game against the Carolina Panthers on January 15, 2006. He recorded seven tackles and one interception in a 29–21 loss. Urlacher was also selected to the 2006 Pro Bowl, but declined the position on account of an injury.

The team continued their resurgence into the 2006 season, finishing with a record of 13–3. During the season, Urlacher had one of the best performances of his professional career against the Arizona Cardinals. He helped the Bears overcome a 20-point deficit by recording 19 tackles and a forced fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Teammate Devin Hester commented on Urlacher&#x27;s performance, stating, &quot;We watched the film and everybody was saying that he just turned into the Incredible Hulk the last four minutes of the game, just killing people and running over and tackling whoever had the ball.&quot; The Bears won the NFC Championship against the New Orleans Saints 39–14, but lost Super Bowl XLI to the Indianapolis Colts 29–17. Urlacher finished the season with 93 tackles and three forced fumbles. He was elected to the 2006 All-Pro Team and 2007 Pro Bowl, while also earning consideration for the League&#x27;s Defensive Player of the Year award.

The Bears were unable to replicate their success in the 2007 season, and finished last in the NFC North. In the middle of the season, Urlacher admitted that he had been suffering from an arthritic back, but later claimed the ailment was not serious. Nevertheless, he finished the season on a high note, registering five interceptions, five sacks, one fumble recovery, 123 tackles, and a defensive touchdown. Following the season&#x27;s conclusion, Urlacher received minor neck surgery to treat his arthritic back. During the offseason, Urlacher revised his contract with the Bears, who granted him a $6 million signing bonus with a $1 million increase in salary each of the next four years.

Urlacher dislocated his wrist in the 2009 season opener against the Packers. He underwent surgery, and went on to miss the remainder of the season. Urlacher had severely damaged a bone in his wrist that was adjacent to a major nerve. Urlacher was forced to wear a cast on his wrist for 12 weeks and spend a month in therapy to recover from the injury. The Bears began to struggle on offense and defense. As frustration built, Urlacher criticized the Bears offense, stating that the addition of quarterback Jay Cutler had changed the team&#x27;s identity. The Bears, who have historically employed a strong running game, were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense. He went on to say, &quot;Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback, but the guy is a winner, and that formula worked for us. I hate to say it, but that&#x27;s the truth.&quot; Urlacher and Cutler later made amends. The Bears finished the season with a 7–9 record, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year.

After recovering from the injury, Urlacher stated, &quot;I feel more powerful. I&#x27;m running to the football, my keys are a lot more clear now, and I&#x27;m playing downhill. ... So I think it did help my body kind of calm down and relax a little bit.&quot; During the 2010 offseason, Bears general manager Jerry Angelo bolstered the team&#x27;s defense by signing free agent Julius Peppers.

With Peppers&#x27; help, Urlacher and the Bears improved to an 11–5 record in the 2010 NFL season, winning the NFC North and earning a first-round bye for the 2011 playoffs. After leading the NFC in tackles (49) during the period, Urlacher was recognized as the NFC Defensive Player of the Month during December/January. It was the first time winning the award in his career. In the playoffs, the Bears beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round, before falling to the division rival Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship game. Urlacher was also voted to his seventh Pro Bowl for his stellar defensive efforts during the year. He was ranked 49th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

In 2011, in Week 17 against the Minnesota Vikings, Urlacher sprained his MCL when teammate Major Wright and Vikings receiver Percy Harvin landed on him with 5:15 left in the game. Urlacher was eventually named to the Pro Bowl, but did not play due to the injury against Minnesota. He missed much of the team&#x27;s summer practice OTA&#x27;s while trying to recover from the injury. On August 14, 2012, Urlacher had an arthroscopic debridement procedure on his left knee, and stated that his goal was to play in the 2012 season opener. He eventually practiced on September 3, and played against the Colts in the season opener, though he sat out the second half.

===2012: Final season and retirement===

In 2012, Urlacher won the Ed Block Courage Award, given to those who showed a commitment to sportsmanship and courage. During his award acceptance speech, Urlacher thanked the Bears for their support after his mother Lavoyda Lenard died. Against the Tennessee Titans in Week 9, Urlacher intercepted Matt Hasselbeck and returned the pick 46 yards for a touchdown. Urlacher led the Bears in tackles until Week 13 against the Seahawks, in which he sustained a hamstring injury that sidelined him for the remainder of the season. Urlacher became an unrestricted free agent on March 12, 2013. On March 20, the Bears announced that Urlacher would not return in 2013 after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a new contract. Urlacher later belittled Phil Emery&#x27;s contract negotiations with him and stated the Bears had little intention to re-sign him. In 2015, Urlacher told ESPN that he still respected the Bears organization and front office, but has yet to speak to Emery, who was fired in 2014.

On May 22, 2013, Urlacher announced his retirement via his Twitter account. In 182 games in the NFL, Urlacher started all but two, the third most in franchise history behind Walter Payton (184) and Olin Kreutz (183), recording a team-record 1,779 tackles, 41.5 sacks, 22 interceptions, 16 fumble recoveries, and 11 forced fumbles.

=== 2018: Hall of Fame induction ===
On November 21, 2017, Urlacher was announced as one of 27 semi-finalists for the 2018 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. The nomination was Urlacher&#x27;s first, and came in his first year of eligibility. On February 3, 2018, Urlacher was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

He also shared the spotlight with Peyton Manning in a MasterCard commercial at a spa. Nike also aired special commercials about Urlacher&#x27;s high school career containing clips and commentary of plays he made. However, Urlacher later stated that he feels &quot;uncomfortable&quot; appearing in commercials. He was also the cover athlete and spokesperson for Sega Sports&#x27; &quot;NFL 2K3&quot;. During media day before Super Bowl XLI Urlacher wore a hat promoting Glacéau vitamin water, a non-NFL approved sponsor, for which he was fined US$100,000.

Even after winning the NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award for the 2005 season, a 2006 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; poll of 361 NFL players named Urlacher the second most overrated player in the league behind Terrell Owens. In response, Urlacher has stated &quot;Just watch the film. I don&#x27;t know what people are saying, but I&#x27;m not too worried about it anymore. All I can do is go out there and play hard and try and help my team win, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to keep doing.&quot;

==NFL career statistics==

==Personal life==

Urlacher has two daughters, Pamela and Riley, with ex-wife Laurie Urlacher and a son, Kennedy, with Tyna Robertson. Like his father, Kennedy became a standout football player in high school and plays for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. 

In June 2005, Urlacher filed suit to establish paternity of his son Kennedy. Genetic testing determined that he is Kennedy&#x27;s father. Kennedy&#x27;s mother, Tyna Robertson, was already well known to the media, having made claims of sexual assault against famed dancer Michael Flatley and a doctor from Naperville, Illinois. Urlacher and Robertson maintain joint custody over Kennedy. In 2017, Urlacher appealed to a Cook County court to remove Kennedy from Robertson&#x27;s custody after her husband, Ryan Karageorge, was shot and killed in their residence.

In 2011, Urlacher&#x27;s mother Lavoyda Lenard Urlacher died, and Urlacher was granted temporary leave from the team, returning in time for the season opener. His younger brother, Casey, had a brief career in the Arena Football League and was later elected mayor of Mettawa, Illinois, in 2013.

In April 2012, Urlacher began dating model and actress Jenny McCarthy. In August 2012, McCarthy announced that she and Urlacher had ended their relationship. Urlacher married Jennipher Frost, a former contestant on &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; on March 13, 2016.

The Bears responded to the posts, stating, &quot;The social media posts in no way reflect the values or opinions of the Chicago Bears organization.&quot;

<text>A restoration colony was one of a number of land grants in North America given by King Charles II of England in the later half of the 17th century, ostensibly as a reward to his supporters in the Stuart Restoration. The grants marked the resumption of English colonization of the Americas after a 30-year hiatus. The two major restoration colonies were the Province of Pennsylvania and the Province of Carolina. The founding of the Carolinas is described thus:
In 1663, three years after he was restored to his father&#x27;s throne, England&#x27;s Charles II granted a vast territory named Carolina to a group of supporters during his years of exile. Its boundaries extended from Virginia southward to central Florida and eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. Within this potential empire, eight London-based proprietors, including several involved in Barbados sugar plantations, gained governmental powers and semifeudal rights to the land. The system of governance planned for Carolina had both feudal and modern features. To lure settlers, the proprietors promised religious freedom and offered land free for the asking. But onto this generous land offer they grafted a scheme for a semimedieval government in which they, their deputies, and a few noblemen would monopolize political power. Reacting to a generation of revolutionary turbulence in England, they designed Carolina as a model of social and political stability in which a hereditary aristocracy would check boisterous small landholders. 

The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations and Connecticut Colony were given their formal charters and Rhode Island even honored the King with King&#x27;s Province (what has since been renamed Washington County, Rhode Island).

<text>Mario Scelba (; 5 September 1901 – 29 October 1991) was an Italian politician and statesman who was the 33rd prime minister of Italy from February 1954 to July 1955. A founder of Christian Democracy (DC), Scelba was one of the longest-serving Minister of the Interior in the history of the republic, having served at the Viminale Palace in three distinct terms from 1947 to 1962.

A fervent pro-Europeanist, Scelba was President of the European Parliament from March 1969 to March 1971. Known for his law and order policies, he was a key figure in Italy&#x27;s post-war reconstruction, thanks to his drastic reorganization of the Italian police, which came out heavily disorganised from the war.

==Early life==
Scelba was born in Caltagirone, Sicily, in 1901. His father Gaetano Scelba was a poor sharecropper on land owned by the priest Don Luigi Sturzo, while his mother Maria Gambino was a housewife. The couple had five children, one of whom died during his young age. Scelba grew up in an observant Catholic family. At only 12 years old, he was forced to leave school to help his family&#x27;s finances. In 1914, Don Sturzo took steps to guarantee an education to Scelba, who began attending the first class of the lower gymnasium in Caltagirone. The outbreak of the World War I forced the institute to suspend lessons and Scelba recovered the lost years by studying as a privatist and achieving the classical diploma in 1920. He then studied law and graduated at the Sapienza University of Rome in 1924, with a thesis on regional decentralization.

During university, he was selected by Sturzo as his private assistant and secretary. From 1919 Sturzo was in fact the leader of a Christian-democratic party, the Italian People&#x27;s Party (PPI), and was one of the most important politicians in the country. When the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini rose to power, suppressing all the other parties, including the PPI, Sturzo was forced into exile, while Scelba remained in Rome as his informer. During the regime, Scelba wrote for the newspaper &quot;Il Popolo&quot; (&quot;The People&quot;); when it was banned by the Italian fascist regime in 1925, he founded a clandestine weekly newspaper known as &quot;L&#x27;idea popolare&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Idea&quot;). In these years, Scelba started his career as a lawyer in the law firm of Filippo Del Giudice, and when the latter was forced to leave the country to save from fascist repression, Scelba inherited his customers.

In 1929 Scelba married Nerina Palestini, from San Benedetto del Tronto, from whom he had a daughter Maria Luisa, born in 1930.

==Early political career==

During the 1930s Scelba became a close friend of Alcide De Gasperi, former leader of the People&#x27;s Party after Sturzo&#x27;s exile. Along with De Gasperi, he collaborated in the drafting of the &quot;Reconstructive Ideas of Christian Democracy&quot;, the first programmatic document of the future party, which was published in July 1943. Scelba was part of the committee which led the new party, known as the DC, during the German occupation. He was also arrested by the Nazis but was released within three days. After the liberation of Rome in June 1944, he joined the executive committee of the new party. In the interregional congress of the DC, held in Naples on 29 and 30 July 1944, Scelba was elected to the party&#x27;s national council, which appointed De Gasperi as new secretary. Scelba was instead appointed deputy secretary.

In September 1943, as a member of the DC, Scelba joined the National Liberation Committee (CLN), a political umbrella organization and the main representative of the Italian resistance movement fighting against the German occupation of Italy in the aftermath of the armistice of Cassibile. On 21 June 1945, Ferruccio Parri, leader of the Action Party, became the new prime minister and appointed Scelba as Minister of Mails and Telecommunications, a position that he would held until February 1947, even under the premiership of Alcide De Gasperi.

On 25 September 1945 Scelba was appointed to the National Council, the unelected legislative assembly established in the Kingdom of Italy after the end of the war. In the 1946 Italian general election, Scelba was elected in the Constituent Assembly for the constituency of Catania–Messina–Siracusa–Ragusa–Enna with nearly 40,000 votes.

==Minister of the Interior==
On 2 February 1947 Scelba became Minister of the Interior in the third government of Alcide de Gasperi, and remained in office until July 1953. During these years, Scelba was probably the most powerful man in the country, after De Gasperi. Having witnessed the Red Biennium and the violent fascist reaction, which caused the crisis of the liberal state and the subsequent formation of the dictatorship, Scelba was deeply convinced that the control of public order was necessary for the defense of the newly founded democratic and republican institutions; in fact, during all his tenure he was a strong advocate of law and order policies. His hard-fisted record earned him the nickname &quot;Iron Sicilian&quot; for his ruthless suppression of left-wing workers&#x27; protests and strikes, as well as neo-fascist rallies.

===Portella della Ginestra massacre===
After just three months in office as Minister of the Interior, Scelba was confronted with the Portella della Ginestra massacre. Twelve days after the left-wing election victory in the Sicilian regional elections of 1947, the 1 May labour parade in Portella della Ginestra was attacked, culminating in the killing of 11 people and the wounding of over thirty. The attack was attributed to the bandit and separatist leader Salvatore Giuliano, the aim being to punish local leftists for the recent election results.
Scelba reported to Parliament the next day that so far as the police could determine, the Portella della Ginestra shooting was non-political. He claimed that bandits notoriously infested the valley in which it occurred; however, that version was challenged by the left. The Italian Communist Party (PCI) deputy Girolamo Li Causi stressed the political nature of the massacre, claiming that the Mafia had perpetrated the attack, in cahoots with the large landowners, monarchists and the rightist Common Man&#x27;s Front. He also claimed that police inspector Ettore Messana – supposed to coordinate the prosecution of the bandits – had been in league with Giuliano and denounced Scelba for allowing Messana to remain in office. Later documents would substantiate the accusation.

Li Causi and Scelba would be the main opponents in the aftermath of the massacre – the subsequent killing of the alleged perpetrator, Salvatore Giuliano, and the trial against Giuliano&#x27;s lieutenant Gaspare Pisciotta and other remaining members of Giuliano&#x27;s gang. The trial of those responsible was held in the city of Viterbo, starting in the summer of 1950. During the trial, Scelba was again accused of involvement in the plot to carry out the massacre, but the accusations were often contradictory or vague. In the end, the judge concluded that no higher authority had ordered the massacre and that the Giuliano band had acted autonomously. At the trial Pisciotta said: &quot;Again and again Scelba has gone back on his word: Mattarella and Cusumano returned to Rome to plead for total amnesty for us, but Scelba denied all his promises.&quot; Pisciotta also claimed that he had killed Salvatore Giuliano in his sleep by arrangement with Scelba; however, there was no evidence that Scelba had had any relationship with Pisciotta.

===1948 election===

The general election in April 1948 was heavily influenced by the Cold War confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the Soviet-inspired February 1948 Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, the US became alarmed about Soviet intentions and feared that, if the leftist coalition were to win the elections, the Soviet-funded PCI would draw Italy into the Soviet Union&#x27;s sphere of influence.

The election campaign remained unmatched in verbal aggression and fanaticism in Italy&#x27;s republican history. The DC propaganda became famous in claiming that in Communist countries &quot;children sent parents to jail&quot;, &quot;children were owned by the state&quot;, &quot;people ate their own children&quot;, and claiming disaster would strike Italy if the left-wing would take power.

As interior minister, Scelba announced that the government had 330,000 men under arms, including a special shock force of 150,000 ready to take on communists if they would try to make troubles on election day. The election was eventually won with a comfortable margin by the DC; the DC defeated the left-wing coalition of the Popular Democratic Front (FDP) that comprised the PCI and the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). After the election, De Gasperi continued ruling without the PCI, which had been in government from June 1944, when the first post-war government was formed, until May 1947, while Scelba kept his role as Minister of the Interior.

===Reorganization of the police===

During his ministry Scelba deeply reorganized the Italian police, starting with the expulsion of more than 8,000 former partisans, with the accusation of being communist insurgents. When he took office, the police&#x27;s organization was so shoddy that Scelba exclaimed: &quot;If I were communist, I would start a revolution tomorrow.&quot; During his rule, he transformed country&#x27;s dishevelled police into a force of some 100,000 agents and established a riot squad, heavily armed and equipped with armoured cars and special jeep, called the &quot;Reparto Celere&quot; (&quot;Fast Department&quot;). Scelba made himself known as a man of action against what he considered communist disorder. In doing so, Scelba was also criticised by many DC members who disapproved of his harsh methods. In 1952, he wrote the Scelba Law, which introduced the crime of apology for fascism.

Scelba had a conservative attitude toward certain issues such as scant bathing suits, public kissing and nude statues. Despite this and his single-minded concern for law and order, on socio-economic issues Scelba leaned left of centre in the DC. He favoured more social reforms and public works, attacking speculators for pushing up prices. He once said: &quot;It is virtually impossible to be Minister of Interior for a government that does not care if the people work or not.&quot; Scelba emphasized the possibility of undermining communist strength &quot;by determined measures of social and economic improvement, like a land reform of the great estates in Southern Italy, for example.&quot; While in office, he was also involved in setting up the Gladio network, the clandestine NATO &quot;stay-behind&quot; operation in Italy after World War II, intended to organise resistance after a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe.

===1953 election===
The 1953 general election was characterised by changes in the electoral law. Even if the general structure remained uncorrupted, the government introduced a superbonus of two-thirds of seats in the House for the coalition which would obtain at-large the absolute majority of votes. The change was strongly opposed by the opposition parties as well as DC&#x27;s smaller coalition partners, who had no realistic chance of success under this system. The new law was called the Scam Law by its detractors, including some dissidents of minor government parties who founded special opposition groups to deny the artificial landslide to the DC. The campaign of the opposition to the Scam Law achieved its goal. The government coalition won 49.9% of national vote, just a few thousand votes of the threshold for a supermajority, resulting in an ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Technically, the government won the election, winning a clear working majority of seats in both houses. But frustration with the failure to win a supermajority caused significant tensions in the leading coalition. De Gasperi was forced to resign by the Italian Parliament on 2 August. On 17 August, President Einaudi appointed Pella as new Prime Minister of Italy.

==Prime Minister of Italy==
Pella&#x27;s government lasted only five months, and Fanfani became the new prime minister in January 1954; however, he was forced to resign after only 23 days in power, and then Italian president Luigi Einaudi gave Scelba the task of forming a new cabinet. On 10 February, he sworn in as new prime minister at the head of a centrist coalition government composed by DC, Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI) and Italian Liberal Party (PLI).
During his premiership, he built strong relations with the United States and NATO and resolved many wartime issues notably including the difficult situation in the Free Territory of Trieste. A few months before, former prime minister Pella risked an open conflict with Josip Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia, Scelba instead pursued a diplomatic way, which brought to the sign of the &quot;London Memorandum&quot; on 5 October 1954. The deal gave the former &quot;Zone A&quot; with Trieste to Italy for ordinary civil administration, and &quot;Zone B&quot;, which had already had a Communist government since 1947, to Yugoslavia.

While appointed prime minister, the aftermath of the Portella della Ginestra massacre came to haunt Scelba again. On 9 February 1954 Gaspare Pisciotta was found dead in his cell. After Pisciotta had been sentenced to life in imprisonment and forced labour, he realized that he had been abandoned by all. He declared that he was going to tell the whole truth, in particular, who signed the letter which had been brought to Giuliano, which demanded the massacre at Portella delle Ginestra in exchange for liberty for the bandits and which Giuliano had destroyed immediately. The cause of Pisciotta&#x27;s death, as revealed by the autopsy, was the ingestion of 20 mg of strychnine. Both the government and the Sicilian Mafia were suggested as being behind the murder of Pisciotta, although no one was ever brought to trial. Neo-fascist and communist press did their best to put it on the newly appointed Scelba&#x27;s administration but had no evidence to go on.

Another scandal that hurled Scelba&#x27;s government was the Montesi affair. Foreign Minister Attilio Piccioni, a co-founder of DC, as well as the national police chief, had to resign when Piccioni&#x27;s jazz-pianist son was implicated in the scandal involving sex, narcotics and the death of party girl Wilma Montesi. In social policy, the government introduced in August 1954 an investment plan for the public construction of economic housing.
At the end of 1954, Scelba approved a package of measures against the PCI and trade unions that was largely modelled on United States psychological warfare plans first elaborated in 1951–52. This proved to be only an attempt to consolidate his precarious position at home by obtaining formal American backing. Its half-hearted implementation exacerbated Washington&#x27;s resentment toward its Italian allies and barely affected PCI&#x27;s organizational structure. The PCI used the episode to denounce the illiberal and authoritarian nature of the DC government and to pose itself once more as the real defender of political freedoms and constitutional rights.

In April 1955, Giovanni Gronchi was elected new president of the Italian Republic. Scelba presented to the newly elected head of state the formal resignation of his government: it was an act of courtesy towards the new president, who, in the absence of a majority crisis, should reject them, but Gronchi did not do it. This generated a real political crisis, during which Fanfani, as secretary of the DC, kept Scelba out of the formation of the new cabinet, even if he was formally the designated prime minister. In July 1955 Scelba renounced the office, and on 6 July, Antonio Segni sworn in as new prime minister. Scelba, whose fall was caused by the political manoeuvring of his party&#x27;s rivals, always stated that he had been overthrown not by a parliamentary vote but by a party coup.

==After the premiership==

After his resignation, a period of centre-left governments began and Scelba lost lot of his influence over the party. In 1958, Scelba formed his own faction within the DC, known as &quot;Centrismo popolare&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Centrism&quot;) and composed conservative by politicians such Guido Gonella, Roberto Lucifredi, Mario Martinelli and Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, which would be dissolved in 1968.

On 26 July 1960, he was appointed Minister of the Interior in Fanfani&#x27;s third cabinet. In fact, the disorders which caused the fall of Fernando Tambroni&#x27;s government, made Scelba&#x27;s return to the Viminale Palace necessary to protect public order against violent demonstrations. In that role, he also had to face the break out of tensions in South Tyrol, where some serious bombing attacks had taken place by South Tyrolean separatist movements. Scelba adopted extraordinary measures to save public order and established an advisory commission called to draw up proposals to promote coexistence between different ethnic-linguistic groups. Scelba remained in office until February 1962, when Fanfani proposed a cabinet reshuffle, ousting him from office.

During the rest of his political career, he always tried to oppose the positions of DC members who, like Fanfani and Aldo Moro, worked to overcome centrist policies, starting a gradual convergence with the PSI. A fervent supporter of European integration, he was a member of the European Parliament from 1960 to 1979 and served as President of the EP from 1969 to 1971, becoming the third Italian to hold the office after De Gasperi and Pella. He ran in the first European election in June 1979, for the constituency Italian Islands, receiving nearly 200,000 votes but he did not succeed in being elected, arriving third after Salvo Lima and Vincenzo Giumarra. In 1983, after the end of the 8th legislature, he retired from politics.

==Death and legacy==
On 29 October 1991, Scelba died of thrombosis aged 90 at his home in Rome. Within the DC, Scelba had always represented the tradition of popularismo, which was deeply linked to the PPI. He embodied the values of democratic Catholicism and anti-fascism, inherited by Don Sturzo&#x27;s policies. Scelba always loyally supported De Gasperi in building a democratic and parliamentarian system during the post-war years. In his relationship with the Catholic Church, even as a practicing Catholic, Scelba defended the secularism of the state and its independence from the Catholic Church.

Scelba was bestknown for his law and order policies. As minister, he went through a repressive policy which, according to historians like Giuseppe Carlo Marino, professor at the University of Palermo, represented an anti-democratic action. Scelba&#x27;s aversion to socialist and communist ideas of social justice led to violating the constitutional freedoms. According to Indro Montanelli, the police reorganization that Scelba carried out allowed a drastic reduction in political crimes and an improvement in the security of citizens.

<doc id="1243159" wikidata="Q320963" url="?curid=1243159" title="Giuseppe Pella">
<text>Giuseppe Pella (18 April 1902 – 31 May 1981) was an Italian Christian Democratic politician and statesman who served as the 31st prime minister of Italy from 1953 to 1954. He was also Minister of Treasury, Budget and of Foreign Affairs during the 1950s and early 1960s. Pella served as President of the European Parliament from 1954 to 1956 after the death of Alcide De Gasperi.

Pella is widely considered one of the most important politicians in Italy&#x27;s post-war history. His &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic and monetary policies strongly influenced the Italian reconstruction and the subsequent economic miracle.

==Early life and career==
Giuseppe Pella was born in Valdengo, Piedmont. He was the second son of Luigi Pella and Viglielmina Bona, sharecroppers in a small farm. After having obtained his elementary school certificate privately, he attended the three-year period of technical schools in Biella and then an accounting Institute in Turin. After graduating in Economy and Commerce at the Royal Superior Institute of Turin in 1924, he became a professor of accounting at the Sapienza University of Rome and University of Turin. He also started working as tax advisor and auditor.

Under the regime of Benito Mussolini, Pella was forced to join the National Fascist Party (PNF), to continue his occupation as tax advisor and professor. As a fascist, he was appointed member of the Governing Council of the Fascist Culture Provincial Institute of Biella and consultant of the municipality of Biella. In the late 1930s he was appointment deputy &quot;podestà&quot; of Biella, with the task of reorganizing city&#x27;s financial system.

In 1934, Pella married Ines Maria Cardolle, from whom he had a daughter, Wanda, born in 1938.

During the Italian Civil War, Pella started cooperating with the National Liberation Committee (CLN), a political umbrella organization and the main representative of the Italian resistance movement fighting against the German occupation of Italy in the aftermath of the armistice of Cassibile. After the end of the World War II, he joined the Christian Democracy (DC), led by Alcide De Gasperi, becoming one of the main members of the party&#x27;s right wing. After the 1946 general election, he became a member of the Constituent Assembly of Italy. In July 1946, he was appointed under-secretary of Finances in the second and third governments of De Gasperi. On 6 June 1947, De Gasperi appointed him Minister of Finance in his fourth cabinet.

===Minister of Treasury and Budget===
From May 1948 until January 1954 Pella served as Minister of Budget under the premiership of Alcide De Gasperi. Moreover, from May 1948 until July 1951 and again from February 1952 to August 1953, he also served as Minister of Treasury. As minister he implemented liberist and monetarist policies, characterized by a strong &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism, which gained him the enmity of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and Italian Socialist Party (PSI), as well as harsh criticism from members of Christian Democracy&#x27;s left-wing, like Giuseppe Dossetti and Giorgio La Pira. The American experts of the Marshall Plan, who arrived in Rome to check the use of Plan&#x27;s funds, were disconcerted that not a dollar had been spent on a Roosevelt-like public spending policy: the funds had in fact been used exclusively to bring order to the public finance and to stabilize the state budget following the thought of Luigi Einaudi.

==Prime Minister of Italy==

The 1953 general election was characterised by changes in the electoral law. Even if the general structure remained uncorrupted, the government introduced a superbonus of two thirds of seats in the House for the coalition which would obtain at-large the absolute majority of votes. The change was strongly opposed by the opposition parties as well as DC&#x27;s smaller coalition partners, who had no realistic chance of success under this system. The new law was called the &quot;Scam Law&quot; by its detractors, including some dissidents of minor government parties who founded special opposition groups to deny the artificial landslide to Christian Democracy.

In the 7 June election, the government coalition won 49.9% of national vote, just a few thousand votes of the threshold for a supermajority, resulting in an ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Technically, the government won the election, winning a clear working majority of seats in both houses, but frustration with the failure to win a supermajority caused significant tensions in the leading coalition, which ended on 2 August, when De Gasperi was forced to resign by the Parliament. On 17 August, President Einaudi appointed Pella as new Prime Minister. Pella Cabinet was immediately labeled as &quot;administrative government&quot;, with the only aim of approving the budget law. As premier, he also served as &quot;ad interim&quot; Minister of Budget and Foreign Affairs.

Pella gained further critics when, by issuing nationalistic declarations, he created strife with Josip Broz Tito regarding the Free Territory of Trieste. The Yugoslav president declared he would have invaded Trieste if the Americans had assigned it to Italy. Then, Pella threatened to send troops to the Eastern border in response to Tito&#x27;s provocation. The crisis that could result in a military confrontation was brought back after many diplomatic efforts by the Western powers. His interventionism provoked opposite reactions in Parliament and in the press: Monarchist National Party (PNM) and the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) strongly supported him, while the leftist parties, and especially the communists, accused him of nationalism and anti-communism. Much of his own party remained neutral, partly because the governments of United States and United Kingdom wanted to keep good relations with Yugoslavia even at the cost of penalizing Italy. The media, however, described Pella as a patriot and as a courageous statesman. Much of the public opinion appreciated his policies.

On 12 January 1954, after only 5 months in power, a strong confrontation with many members of DC, regarding the appointment of Salvatore Aldisio as new Minister of Agriculture, forced Pella to resign.

==After the premiership==

After the end of his government, in November 1954, Pella was elected President of the Common Assembly, the plenary assembly of European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which had been considered as the prototype of the European Parliament. He hold the office until November 1956. His pro-European vision was clearly outlined already in the inauguration speech as president, where he sustained the need to create a Europe &quot;inspired by the concept of supernationality, built not against nations but with the sincere collaboration of nations.&quot; Few years later, discussing about his years at the head of the European institution, he stated that he always held his office &quot;with the determination to pursue the strategic plan of a progressive transfer of sovereignty from the member States to the European institutions.&quot;

In 1954, he founded, along with Giulio Andreotti, a right-wing faction of Christian Democracy, known as &quot;Concentration&quot;. In 1955 he was one of the kingmakers of Giovanni Gronchi&#x27;s election to the Presidency of the Republic, against Cesare Merzagora, who was the candidate proposed by the Christian Democratic secretary, Amintore Fanfani. Pella and Andreotti&#x27;s move gained the surprising support of communist and socialist parties, as well as the one monarchist and neo-fascist movements. After Gronchi&#x27;s sworn in, Pella was considered the natural candidate for the premiership, however the new President of the Republic appointed Antonio Segni.

In May 1957, Pella served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of Adone Zoli, of whom he served also as Deputy Prime Minister. He became Foreign Affairs Minister again under Segni, from February 1959 until March 1960, and Minister of Budget in Fanfani III Cabinet from July 1960 to February 1962.

A strong opponent of Fanfani&#x27;s alliance with the Socialist Party, from 1962 he decided to keep aside. In the later years, he became president of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee from 18 July 1968 to 23 February 1972 and briefly returned to the government as Finance Minister in the first government of Giulio Andreotti from February to June 1972, which however failed to gain confidence by the Parliament.

After leaving politics in 1976, he continued his role of President of &quot;National Association of Insurance Institutes&quot; and of the &quot;Association of Tax Advisors and Accountants&quot;. He also led &quot;Piemonte Italia&quot;, a promotional institute of studies on the regional economy, which he founded in the 1960s.

Pella died on 31 May 1981 in Rome, at the age of 79.

<text>Antônio Augusto de Lima (5 April 1859 – 22 April 1934) was a Brazilian journalist, poet, musician, magistrate, jurist, professor and politician. He was born in Congonhas de Sabará (now Nova Lima).

Augusto de Lima was governor of the state of Minas Gerais, and he idealized the transfer of the state&#x27;s capital from Ouro Preto to Belo Horizonte (then &quot;Curral Del Rey&quot;). In 1903, he became a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters and was elected its president in 1928.

In 1906, Augusto de Lima was elected &quot;deputado federal&quot; (house representative) and moved to Rio de Janeiro, the federal district. There, he married Vera Monteiro de Barros de Suckow, granddaughter of Hans Wilhelm von Suckow, Major of the Prussian Army (who fought Napoleon&#x27;s army in the Battle of Waterloo) and patron of Brazil&#x27;s horse racing — the first breeder of race horses in Brazil.

As a politician, Augusto de Lima defended female suffrage and was also an ecologist. He was strongly devoted to Saint Francis of Assisi, and was responsible for the first Amazon forest protection law in Brazil, implemented after a fifteen-year battle in congress.

<text>The Indian Tomb (German: Das indische Grabmal) is a two-part 1921 German silent film directed by Joe May.

It is based on the 1918 novel &quot;The Indian Tomb&quot; by Thea von Harbou. It comprised two parts, Part I: The Mission of the Yogi and Part II: The Tiger of Bengal (). Part I received its première in Berlin on 22 October 1921, and Part II on 17 November 1921.

Upon its release, it was neither a critical nor commercial success and has been little seen until two recent restorations were completed, a European film restoration and a U.S. video restoration by David Shepard.

<doc id="1243177" wikidata="Q261243" url="?curid=1243177" title="Dmanisi">
<text>Dmanisi (, , ) is a town and archaeological site in the Kvemo Kartli region of Georgia approximately 93 km southwest of the nation’s capital Tbilisi in the river valley of Mashavera. It is the site of Dmanisi Hominid Skulls, which are dated to 1.8 million years ago, making them the earliest dated human remains in Eurasia.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1073/pnas.1106638108&quot;&gt;1.85-1.78 Ma 95% CI. &lt;/ref&gt; 

A series of skulls which had diverse physical traits, discovered at Dmanisi in the early 2000s, led to the hypothesis that many separate species in the genus &quot;Homo&quot; were in fact a single lineage. Also known as Skull 5, D4500 is the fifth skull to be discovered in Dmanisi.

== History ==
The area around the town of Dmanisi has been settled since the Early Bronze Age. In the 6th century an Orthodox Christian cathedral named &quot;Dmanisi Sioni&quot; was built there. The oldest written record of the town is in the 9th century as a possession of the Arab emirate of Tbilisi. Located on the confluence of trading routes and cultural influences, Dmanisi was particularly important, growing into a major commercial center of medieval Georgia. The town was taken by the Seljuk Turks in the 1080s and by the Georgian kings David the Builder and Demetrios I between 1123 and 1125. The Turco-Mongol armies under Timur laid waste to the town in the 14th century. Sacked again by the Turkomans in 1486, Dmanisi never recovered and declined to a scarcely inhabited village by the 18th century. The castle was controlled by the House of Orbeliani.

== Archaeological site ==

Extensive archaeological studies began in the area in 1936 and continued in the 1960s. Beyond a rich collection of ancient and medieval artifacts and the ruins of various buildings and structures, unique remains of prehistoric animals and humans have been unearthed. Some of the animal bones were identified by the Georgian paleontologist A. Vekua with the teeth of the extinct rhino &quot;Dicerorhinus etruscus etruscus&quot; in 1983.

This species dates back presumably to the early Pleistocene epoch. The discovery of primitive stone tools in 1984 led to increasing interest to the archaeological site. In 1991, a team of Georgian scholars was joined by the German archaeologists from Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum, and later the U.S., French and Spanish researchers.

===&quot;Homo erectus georgicus&quot;===
Early human (or hominin) fossils, originally named &quot;Homo georgicus&quot; and now considered &quot;Homo erectus georgicus&quot;, were found at Dmanisi between 1991 and 2005. At 1.8 million years old, they are now believed to be a subspecies of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; and not a separate species of &quot;Homo&quot;. These fossils represent the earliest known human presence in the Caucasus.

Subsequently, four fossil skeletons were found, showing a species primitive in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs. A 2017 study suggests they represent a stage soon after the transition from &quot;Homo habilis&quot; to &quot;Homo erectus&quot;.

Human habitation in the Caucasus goes back to the remotest antiquity. The hominin remains discovered in 1991 by David Lordkipanidze at Dmanisi, Kvemo Kartli (1.8 million years old) are the oldest found outside Africa. Neanderthal remains have been found at Ortvale K’lde (1973) and elsewhere in the Caucasus (36,000–50,000 years old).

The Dmanisi hominin remains are still making an impact on the paleontological community. the Dmanisi skull 5 is in the middle of the controversy: many hominin fossils formerly thought to be different species may not have been separate species at all. Several early members of the genus Homo were possibly one evolving lineage.

<text>Ferruccio Parri (; 19 January 1890 – 8 December 1981) was an Italian partisan and anti-fascist politician who served as the 29th Prime Minister of Italy, and the first to be appointed after the end of World War II. During the war, he was also known by his &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Maurizio.

==Biography==
Parri was born in Pinerolo, Piedmont. He served in World War I, when he was wounded four times and received four decorations. In the final stages of the war he worked as a staff officer on the planning of the battle of Vittorio Veneto. After the war he graduated in literature and became a teacher in Milan and an editor for the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;. He left the newspaper in 1925, after it was taken over by the Fascist government, and had to quit his teaching job because he refused to join the National Fascist Party.

===Resistance to Fascism===
He became active against Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist regime and joined Carlo and Nello Rosselli&#x27;s &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot;) (&quot;Justice and Liberty&quot;), the most important Italian non-Marxist anti-fascist movement.

In 1926, together with Carlo Rosselli and future President of Italy Sandro Pertini he was involved in planning and assisting the escape to France of reformist Socialist leader Filippo Turati. For this he was arrested and sentenced to ten months of imprisonment and then to five years of internal exile to the islands of Ustica and Lipari and to Vallo della Lucania. In 1930 he was again banished for five years together with other leaders of &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot;.

Parri remained in contact with &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot;, and in 1942 founded the Action Party, an anti-fascist liberal socialist movement that sought to pair social justice and respect for civil liberties. In September 1943, after the armistice between Italy and the Allied powers and the German occupation of Italy, he was among the people indicated by anti-fascist parties to take a leading role in the Italian resistance movement. Living underground in Nazi-occupied Northern Italy, he became a member of the National Liberation Committee and deputy commander of the main group of partisan forces, the &quot;Corpo Volontari della Libertà&quot;.

He was arrested in Milan in January 1945 by the Waffen SS during a routine operation. He was held prisoner until March when he was released as part of Operation Sunrise – a series of secret negotiations between Allen Dulles, head of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and representatives of the German Wehrmacht command in Northern Italy. The release of Parri was requested by the OSS as evidence of good faith and the ability to act. He returned in time to take part in the final phase of the resistance and in the general insurrection in April.

By the time the war ended the &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot; Brigades, the military arm of the Action Party, were the second largest partisan units, accounting for about 20% of all fighters of the Italian resistance movement.

===Prime Minister of Italy===
After the end of World War II, he was appointed leader of a government supported, among the others, by the Action Party, Christian Democracy (&quot;Democrazia Cristiana&quot;; DC), the Italian Communist Party (&quot;Partito Comunista Italiano&quot;; PCI), the Italian Socialist Party (&quot;Partito Socialista Italiano&quot;; PSI) and the Italian Liberal Party (&quot;Partito Liberale Italiano&quot;; PLI). A centrist, he had been chosen as the compromise leader of a compromise Cabinet. He was also the Minister of the Interior (in charge of the police). When the Liberals withdrew their support from the coalition government, Parri resigned from his position.

At the time, Parri warned: &quot;Beware of civil war ... of reopening the door to fascism. ... There are rumors that Washington and London have no trust in me. The real reason for this lack of trust is that Italy has only a fragile front of antifascism. ... I hope my successors will follow the only worthy policy for Italy: left of center&quot;.

===In Parliament===
In spite of the wartime strength of &quot;Giustizia e libertà&quot; the Action Party quickly faded from the Italian political scene, winning 1.46% in the 1946 Constituent Assembly election. Parri, along with Ugo La Malfa, left the party shortly before the election to form the Republican Democratic Concentration (&quot;Concentrazione Democratica Repubblicana&quot;; CDR), which won 0.42% and elected its two most prominent members as deputies. The CDR would be absorbed the following year into the Italian Republican Party (PRI).

He became a Senator in 1948.

In 1953 Parri, who was opposed to recent changes to the election law, left the PRI to establish the short-lived Popular Unity (&quot;Unità Popolare&quot;; UP) with former Action Party member Piero Calamandrei, with the goal of preventing the centrist coalition from winning a majority bonus of seats. The party, which failed to elect any members, was absorbed into the Italian Socialist Party in 1957.

In 1958 he was re-elected to the Senate as an independent in the Socialist party list. He proposed to form a parliamentary inquiry committee to investigate the Sicilian Mafia. The proposal was opposed by the parliamentary majority with various arguments, and dismissed by Christian Democratic Senators Bernardo Mattarella and Giovanni Gioia as &quot;useless&quot;. It was finally established in 1963.

In 1963, President Antonio Segni appointed Parri senator for life. He joined the Independent Left group, and was for a long time its chairman from 1972 until his death. In March of the same year, he became the editor of the magazine &quot;L&#x27;Astrolabio&quot;, in which he argued in favour of a more accomplished democracy and denounced the resurgence of neofascism.

From 1949 until 1969 he was president of the Italian Federation of Partisan Associations, an association of Resistance veterans that grouped members of &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot;, as well as members of Socialist, Republican, and anarchist groups.

===Death===
Parri died in Rome on 8 December 1981.

He once characterized himself: &quot;I am a common man – &quot;uomo della strada&quot;. I am just another guy – &quot;uomo qualunque&quot; ... I hope a typical one. My job is not only to prevent the right and left wings from exercising undue influence on the Government, but I have to think too of the enormous masses of peasants sweating in the fields under the sun, blacksmiths beating their anvils in villages, workers, men and women everywhere who have no taste for politics and are outside parties. ... I am just a &quot;uomo della strada&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="1243182" wikidata="Q8424783" url="?curid=1243182" title="Elections in Hong Kong">
<text>Elections in Hong Kong take place when certain political offices in the government need to be filled. Hong Kong has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in the Legislative Council. The Chief Executive of Hong Kong is nonpartisan but can work with several parties to form a coalition government.

Every four years, ninety representatives are chosen to sit on the unicameral Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo). Twenty seats representing the geographical constituencies are returned by popular vote, thirty seats representing the functional constituencies are elected through smaller closed elections within business sectors, and the remaining forty seats representing the Election Committee constituency are chosen by members of the Election Committee. The Chief Executive of Hong Kong is returned by the 1,500-member Election Committee on five-year intervals. Local elections are held on four-year intervals to return members of District Councils.
Following the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, and the landslide victory of Hong Kong&#x27;s pro-democracy camp in the 2019 Hong Kong local elections, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress of the People&#x27;s Republic of China unilaterally passed the Hong Kong national security law and changes to Annex I and Annex II of the Hong Kong Basic Law. Candidates are subject to an official eligibility review mechanism, curtailing the influence of the public&#x27;s vote on the outcome. 

==History==
Elections for unofficial members of the Urban Council were held since 1888. Suffrage was restricted to residents on the special and common jury lists between 1888 and 1973. In 1973, the electoral franchise for the Urban Council was widened to residents above 21 years of age who have lived in Hong Kong for at least three years that qualified in at least one of 23 specified categories, which included educational qualifications (School Certificate Examination or equivalent), being a juror, salaried taxpayer, or a member of certain professional organisations as listed in Schedule 1 of the Urban Council Ordinance (Cap. 101, &quot;Laws of Hong Kong&quot;). Half of the members of the Urban Council were elected, but by a minority of the population. It was estimated that in 1970 there were 250,000 eligible voters and in 1981 the number had increased to 400,000 – 500,000. Prominent elected Urban Councilors included Elsie Tu and Brook Bernacchi of the Reform Club.

=== Expansion of elected offices ===
The &quot;Green Paper: A Pattern of District Administration in Hong Kong&quot; was published on 6 June 1980 for public consultations on reforming local administration in Hong Kong. The Green Paper recommended that elections by popular vote be introduced to return some members of the newly established District Boards and unofficial members of the Urban Council. The &quot;White Paper: District Administration in Hong Kong&quot; of January 1981 further cemented the government&#x27;s will to introduce elections by popular vote. Proposals in the White Paper were implemented between 1982 and 1983, during which elections to the District Boards and Urban Council were held.

Months before the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed which the United Kingdom and the People&#x27;s Republic of China governments agreed on handing over Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule in 1997, the &quot;Green Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong&quot; was published in July 1984. The Green Paper cemented first large-scale constitutional reform in developing a representative government during the British rule. The Green Paper suggested the introduction of indirect election in two stages in 1985 and 1988 to the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) by an electoral college consisting of Members of the Urban Council of Hong Kong, the new Regional Council to be established in 1986, and District Boards and functional groups or functional constituencies. The first Legislative Council elections, electing 24 unofficial members of LegCo, was held in September 1985.

=== Popular elections to the legislature ===
Consultations on electoral reform followed the 1985 electoral reform. In the &quot;White Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong&quot; of 1984, the idea of direct election was suggested to be reviewed in the development of representative government in 1987.

In May 1987, the government published the 1987 &quot;Green Paper: Review of Developments in Representative Government&quot; to consider the next stage of development of representative government. Despite strong public opinion in the consultations supporting the introduction of direct elections, the Government concluded that no clear consensus on the timing or the extent of the introduction of direct elections emerged. The subsequent &quot;White Paper: the Development of Representative Government: The Way Forward&quot; delayed the first direct elections to the Legislative Council from 1988 to the 1991 elections. A total of 18 members were returned from geographical constituencies by popular vote, out of a total of 60 LegCo members.

As Chris Patten succeeded David Wilson as the last Governor of Hong Kong, extensive electoral reform proposals were announced in Patten&#x27;s inaugural Policy Address. The minimum voting age was lowered from 21 to 18, and all appointed seats on the Urban Council, Regional Council and District Boards were to be abolished by 1995. Single-member constituencies were to be introduced to geographical constituencies of the Legislative Council, elected seats of the Urban Council, elected seats of the Regional Council and elected seats of District Boards.

Patten significantly broadened the electoral franchise to the first fully-elected Legislative Council returned in 1995, the composition of which conformed with Basic Law provisions on the composition of the 1st Legislative Council of Hong Kong SAR. Patten lobbied the Legislative Council (Electoral Provisions) (Amendment) Bill 1994 which broadened the franchise of certain existing functional constituencies by replacing corporate voting with individual voting. Nine new functional constituency seats were established, allowing about 2.7 million people to have the right to vote in functional constituencies. An Election Committee composed of district board members returned ten members to the Legislative Council.

In response to Patten&#x27;s reforms, Beijing cancelled the &quot;through-train arrangement&quot; allowing the last Legislative Council in the British-era to be sworn in as the 1st Legislative Council of Hong Kong SAR after the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997. The Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR under Chinese National People&#x27;s Congress established the Provisional Legislative Council on 26 January 1996 that served as Hong Kong&#x27;s interim legislature until July 1998.

=== Post-handover development ===
The Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) installed by the Beijing government during the intense Sino-British confrontation over the democratic reform decided on the electoral system of the post-handover Legislative Council. For geographical constituencies, proportional representation using the largest remainder method with Hare quota was adopted by the SAR government in replacement of the first-past-the-post system introduced in 1995. The system designed to reward the weaker pro-Beijing candidates and dilute the electoral strength of the majority democrats. For functional constituencies, corporate voting was restored after it was abolished in 1995. It reduced the number of eligible voters by almost 90 per cent, from over 1.1 million in 1995 to fewer than 140,000 in 1998. The elected Urban Council and Regional Council were also abolished by Tung Chee-hwa&#x27;s government.

The first legislative election in the HKSAR was held in 1998, with 20 members returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections, 10 members returned by the 800-member Election Committee and 30 members returned by functional constituencies (FC). The number of LegCo members returned from geographical constituencies (GC) increased from 20 to 24 in 2000 and to 30 in 2004, constituting half of the legislature. Seats returned by Election Committee were abolished by 2004.

The first Chief Executive election after the transfer of sovereignty was held in 2002. Incumbent Tung Chee-hwa was elected uncontested. Subsequent Chief Executives were returned by the Election Committee, members of which were elected by members of specified associations or professions.

===Demand for universal suffrage===
Before the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region had the power to initiate amendments of Annexes I and II of the Basic Law to change its electoral system. From late 2003 on, the Government and the public had been drawing out plans of democratisation to realise the ultimate aim of electing a chief executive by universal suffrage after nomination by an ad hoc committee (Basic Law, Art. 45) and electing the whole Legislative Council by universal suffrage (Basic Law, Art. 68). On 6 April 2004, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC) issued its second interpretation on the Basic Law, indicating that electoral reforms are possible in 2007 and stipulating the “five steps” of initiating political reform under Annex I of the Basic Law. On 26 April 2004, the NPCSC further passed a decision that negated universal suffrage for CE elections in 2007 and LegCo elections in 2008, but provided for electoral reforms withstanding a 50:50 ratio between GC and FC seats. The Legislative Council vetoed the Motions put by the HKSAR Government to the LegCo concerning amendment to the methods for selecting the CE in 2007 and for forming LegCo.

In late 2007, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC) decided that the universal suffrage for the Chief Executive can be achieved in 2017 or later, and universal suffrage for the Legislative Council can be achieved after the former has been. The NPCSC decision also provided for electoral reforms in 2012 withstanding a 50:50 ratio between GC and FC seats. The Legislative Council approved of the Motions concerning the amendment to the methods for selecting the CE and for forming LegCo in 2012.

Amidst the 2014–2015 Hong Kong electoral reform on universal suffrage in 2017, the NPCSC has outlined a screening mechanism of Chief Executive candidates, in which Chief Executive candidates must first receive nominations by an absolute majority of a Nominating Committee before proceeding to popular vote. The Hong Kong Government&#x27;s bill for universal suffrage in Chief Executive elections was subsequently rejected.

With the NPCSC&#x27;s amendment of Annexes I and II of the Basic Law in 2021, the NPCSC has retracted the power of the HKSAR to initiate political reform. The Chinese NPCSC now exercises the sole power to amend Annexes I and II of the Basic Law. In lieu of recent efforts by China to hamper the pro-democracy camp, universal suffrage remains unlikely.

The evolution of elected offices in Hong Kong returned by popular vote is as follows:


==Voter registration and nomination==
Any Hong Kong permanent resident aged 18 or above may register as an elector in the geographical constituency in which they reside, except those mentally incapacitated and those serving in an armed force. Persons serving a sentence of imprisonment used to be barred from registering and voting, but a 2008 judgment by the Court of First Instance of the High Court ruled that a blanket bar was unconstitutional and that the Government had a year to change the offending provisions. The Government did not appeal the judgment, and held consultations with the public on how the law should be changed. A bill was then introduced to the LegCo, providing that no person would be barred from electoral registration or voting because of criminal conviction, even for crimes against the electoral system. It became law and entered into force on 30 October 2009.

Hong Kong permanent residents must satisfy all the following requirements to be eligible for registration as electors in a geographical constituency:
* permanent resident of Hong Kong;
* aged 18 years or above as at 25 July next following his application for registration (or 25 September in a District Council election year)
* ordinarily resident in Hong Kong, and the residential address in his application for registration is his only or principal residence in Hong Kong;
* holds a Hong Kong identity document or has applied for a new identity card; and
* not disqualified by application of s.31 of the Legislative Council Ordinance (Cap 542).

Electors can run for elections if they have reached 21 years of age and have ordinary resided in Hong Kong for the 3 years immediately preceding the nomination. In addition, candidates running for the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council, except 12 specified functional constituencies have to be a Chinese citizen with no right of abode in any country other than the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

===Candidate eligibility review ===
Under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes initiated by the National People&#x27;s Congress, nominees for elections are screened so as to ensure the &quot;administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people with patriots as the main body&quot;. A Candidate Eligibility Review mechanism is established to review and confirm of eligibility of candidates for the Election Committee, Chief Executive and Legislative Council elections:
* Review by the department for safeguarding national security of the Hong Kong Police Force on whether a candidate meets the legal requirements and conditions of upholding the Basic Law and swearing allegiance to HKSAR of PRC;
* the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR issues opinion in respect of a candidate who fails to meet such legal requirements and conditions on the basis of the police review; and
* Review and Confirmation of eligibility of candidates by the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee of the HKSAR.

In practice, every candidate approved to run for election to the Legislative Council is either a member of the pro-Beijing camp or has otherwise been deemed &quot;patriotic&quot; enough by the government of China to participate. Since the 2021 reforms, numerous pro-democracy activists who had attempted to run in elections were arrested.

==Chief Executive elections==
The Election Committee is responsible for nomination of Chief Executive candidates and election of the Chief Executive-elect. Under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes initiated by the National People&#x27;s Congress, each candidate running for Chief Executive elections is to be nominated by at least 188 members of the Election Committee, before their eligibility is reviewed and confirmed by the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee of the HKSAR according to opinions issued by the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Chief Executive-designate is then returned by the Election Committee with an absolute majority.

===Election Committee===
The specific method for selecting the Chief Executive is prescribed in Annex I of the Basic Law. The Election Committee shall be composed of 1500 members from the following sectors pursuant to the amended Annex I under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes initiated by the National People&#x27;s Congress from the following sectors pursuant to the amended Annex I under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes initiated by the National People&#x27;s Congress. The Election Committee consists of individuals (i.e. private citizens) and representatives of bodies (i.e. special interest groups or corporate bodies) selected or elected by 40 prescribed sub-sectors as stipulated in Annex I to the Basic Law:

The Election Committee is now principally elected by body votes. The number of subsectors with individual votes were significantly reduced, together with elimination of mixed individual and body voting:
* Half of seats (150 seats) in Sector III are nominated by members of national professional organisations or filled by ex officio members;
* District Council subsectors were replaced by subsectors consisting of appointed representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees;
* All NPC and CPPCC sectors serve as ex officio EC members; and
* subsectors consisting of grassroot organisations, associations of Chinese Fellow Townsmen, associations of Hong Kong residents in Mainland and Hong Kong members of relevant national organisations were introduced.

===Electoral system===
Chief Executive candidates must receive nominations by at least 188 members of the Election Committee, with Nomination by at least 15 members of each sector of the Election Committee. Candidacy is confirmed upon review and confirmation of eligibility by the Candidate Qualification Review Committee, according to opinions issued by the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the basis of a review by the National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Force on whether a candidate meets the legal requirements and conditions of upholding the Basic Law and swearing allegiance to the HKSAR of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The Chief Executive-designate is then returned by the Election Committee with an absolute majority in a two-round system:
The Chief Executive-designate must publicly disaffiliate with a political party within seven days of the election and must not become a member of a party during their term of office. The Chief Executive-designate is then appointed by the Central People&#x27;s Government before taking office.

===Article 45===
Article 45 gives the requirements for choosing the Chief Executive, and Annex I does likewise in a more specific manner.

===Article 46===
According to Article 46 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, elections for the Chief Executive are held every five years. A 1,500-member electoral college called the Election Committee is elected by representations of specified associations, and some other sectors of the society, with each of the forty sectors of the society and interests of the Central Authorities receiving a set number of electoral votes. The eligible voters in each sector vote directly for the electors, who in turn cast ballots for Chief Executive.

Pursuant to the Annex II of the Basic Law, the Election Committee also selected 10 Members of the 1st LegCo by block vote in 1998. Four of the seats were reassigned to geographical constituencies for the 2nd LegCo in 2000, and the remainder for the 3rd LegCo in 2004. As a part of the 2021 amendments to Annex II by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, the Election Committee selects 40 members of the LegCo since 2021.

The EC elections are quite irregular. They were held in 1998 and 2000, but none (except for the 2002 by-election) have been held since. The claim in Ann. 1, Sect. 2, of the Basic Law, saying that the Election Committee must be renewed at least once every five years.

Article 46 was a subject of controversy regarding the term of the newly elected Chief Executive. The article states:

The law requires a term of five years, but mainland officials have said the new leader filling-in can only serve until 2007. The matter was settled after a re-interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC). Though this did damage the credibility and integrity of the one country, two systems formula.

A literal interpretation would mean Tsang has to serve until 2010, but this is not common sense behaviour in most other nations; one can only complete the term of a predecessor. The Chinese government has decided that the new leader would serve until Inauguration day in 2007.

===History of electoral contests===
The last uncontested election was held in 2002, and with the resignation of Tung Chee Hwa an election would have been called on 10 July, had the election been contested. A controversial decision by the National People&#x27;s Congress stated that a resignation did not end a term, so that Donald Tsang would serve only until 2007, rather than 2010 had a term been deemed to begin with each resignation. This is in line with the practice on mainland China (see Hong Kong Basic Law Article 46). The 800-member Election Committee held a vote on a day specified by the sitting chief executive sometime during the six months of the year prior to the HKSAR&#x27;s Inauguration Day, 1 July. An absolute majority of the votes (i.e. 401 votes) are required to be elected. If no candidate has a majority vote, the one with the lowest vote is eliminated for the next round until a candidate has a majority vote.

In 1996, Tung Chee Hwa was elected with eighty per cent of the electoral votes against two other candidates, Mr. Peter Woo () and Sir Ti Liang Yang (). In 12002, Tung was re-elected uncontested, as he had received 713 signatures of support in the Electoral Committee, and 100 are required for nomination.(Annex I, Section 4, Basic Law)

The 2005 provided a sense of déjà vu for many, as Donald Tsang cruised to victory with 674 nomination signatures out of a possible 796 (four seats were vacant).

The EC elections are quite irregular. They were held in 1998 and 2000, but none (except for the 2002 by-election) have been held since. The claim in Ann. 1, Sect. 2, of the Basic Law, saying that the Election Committee must be renewed at least once every five years, exposed an interesting flaw in the system that was averted when Tsang was the only candidate nominated.

The problem was that the timing is crucial for the new chief executive election after Tung Chee Hwa&#x27;s resignation on 12 March 2005. Since electoral law states that an election must be held 120 days after the vacancy, an election would be held on the tenth of July. It was unclear as to the exact time period separating the election and the date of taking of office for this Election Committee. If the new EC convened prior to the chief executive election, it would be applied to select the next chief executive, but otherwise the old Election Committee dating from 2000 would have to complete the task (see 2005 Hong Kong Chief Executive election for more information on the topic). The second round produces a further dispute, if the term of the old EC ended after the first round of voting but before the second. It would be rather insensible to use different electors for the two rounds; the same one would probably have to be prescribed.

The compositions of electoral colleges returning Chief Executives are as follows:
==Legislative elections==
Under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes initiated by the National People&#x27;s Congress, the Legislative Council is now composed of 90 members returned from 3 constituencies: the Election Committee Constituency, Functional Constituencies and Geographical Constituencies by popular vote.

In Hong Kong, legislative elections are held every four years in accordance with Article 69 of the Basic Law of HKSAR. The most recent election was held on 19 December 2021.

===Electoral system===
Each candidate running for Legislative elections is to be nominated by 10–20 members of the Election Committee, before their eligibility is reviewed and confirmed by the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee of the HKSAR according to opinions issued by the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region:


===Geographical Constituencies===
20 seats of the Legislative Council are returned by geographical constituencies (GC) through single non-transferable vote with a district magnitude of 2 (&quot;binomial system&quot;). The binomial system was instituted by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress in its amendment to Annex 2 of the Basic Law on 30 March 2021.

Geographical constituencies were first introduced in Hong Kong&#x27;s first legislative election with direct elections in 1991. The electoral system and boundaries of GCs have since changed:
===Functional Constituencies===
Under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes, 28 functional constituencies (FC) return 30 members. The Labour Functional Constituency returns three members by plurality block voting. The other FCs return one member each with first-past-the-post voting.

The 2021 electoral reform saw the dissolution of District Council (First) and District Council (Second) FCs. 3 existing FCs were reconstituted: the Information Technology FC reorganised as the Technology &amp; Innovation FC; the Medical FC and Health Services FC combined to form the Medical and Health Services FC. 2 new FCs were established, namely the Commercial (Third) and the HKSAR Deputies to the National People&#x27;s Congress, HKSAR Members of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, and Representatives of Relevant National Organisations FCs. Functional constituencies are now principally elected by body votes; the number of FCs with individual votes were reduced, together with elimination of mixed individual and body voting systems.

===Election Committee Constituency===
The Election Committee constituency was one of the three constituencies designed in the Basic Law of Hong Kong next to the directly elected geographical constituencies and the indirectly elected functional constituencies for the first and second-term Legislative Council fin the early SAR period. With the last British Governor Chris Patten&#x27;s electoral reform, the ECC was composed of all elected District Board members who had been elected in 1994. The Single Transferable Vote system was used in the 1995 election.

After the handover of Hong Kong, the ECC was allocated 10 seats out of the total 60 seats in the SAR Legislative Council, comprising all members of the Election Committee which also elected the Chief Executive every five years. The size of the constituency reduced to six seats in 2000 and was entirely abolished and replaced by the directly elected geographical constituency seats in the 2004 election. The plurality-at-large voting system was used in 1998 and 2000.

In the 2021 electoral overhaul, the Election Committee constituency was reintroduced, taking 40 of the 90 seats, almost half, of the Legislative Council with plurality-at-large voting system. The electorate is composed of all newly expanded 1,500 members in the Election Committee.

===2010 electoral reform ===

The Legislative Council passed the Government&#x27;s bill on amending Annex II of the Basic Law. The total number of Legislative Council members is increased from 60 to 70. Alongside the creation of five new geographical constituency seats, five new functional constituency seats were created in the District Council (Second) FC. The 5 new FC seats were returned by direct elections through proportional representation using the largest remainder method with Hare quota.

The 2010 electoral reform provides for parallel voting, in which each registered voter can participate in the elections of one geographical constituency and one functional constituency.
The District Council (Second) FC was abolished by the National People&#x27;s Congress under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes.

===2012 by-election procedure amendment proposal ===

In mid-May 2011, the government, which considered the resignations leading to &quot;de facto referendum&quot; (2010 Hong Kong by-election) &#x27;abusive&#x27; and a waste of resources, revealed its plan to do away with by-elections entirely. Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Stephen Lam proposed that a Legislative Council seat in any geographical constituency or one of the newly created five-seat district council &#x27;superconstituency&#x27; vacated by the resignation or death of a legislator would be filled by a &#x27;leapfrog&#x27; mechanism by the next best placed candidate at the previous election. The plan attracted criticism from Pan-Democrats; even its allies in the legislature expressed reservations about the workability of the plan. The Bar Association severely criticised the plan, expressing concern over the constitutionality of the proposals, particularly the reasonableness on restrictions on the right to participation.

The government tabled a bill to amend current legislation for by-elections for 13 July. Following call by the Central Government Liaison Office to re-think, the government revised its proposal on 28 June stipulating replacement by an unsuccessful candidate on the same election ticket. The government bowed to pressure and announced one week later that it would suspend reading of the bill for two months, pending consultations on the revised proposals.

===Electoral performances by party===

==District Council elections==

There are eighteen districts, and thus eighteen District Councils in Hong Kong, each being a city council for its district. There is one constituency for, on average, every 17,000 residents, as there are 452 directly-elected constituencies for 2019, and over 7.4 million residents in Hong Kong. A member is elected from each constituency by plurality vote. The chairpersons of the 27 rural committees are &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the councils.

In 2023, the district council are reformed. The total directly seat are dropped from 452 to 88, only less than 19% seat can be directly elected. A new district council eligibility review committee established to review candidate qualification.

==Elections of deputies to the National People&#x27;s Congress of the PRC==
Article 21 of The Basic Law of HKSAR stipulates:

Chinese citizens who are residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be entitled to participate in the management of state affairs according to law. In accordance with the assigned number of seats and the selection method specified by the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC), Chinese citizens among permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall locally elect deputies of the Region to the National People&#x27;s Congress to participate in the work of the highest organ of state power.

The 36 Hong Kong deputies to the National People&#x27;s Congress are chosen by an electoral college composed of the following as specified in the Method for Election of Deputies of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China to the Eleventh National People&#x27;s Congress passed in March 2022:
* Members of the Election Committee (which elects the chief executive) who are Chinese nationals, except those who opt out; and
* The Chief Executive of the HKSAR

A total of 1,989 electors returned Hong Kong deputies in the 2017 election.

==Village Representative elections ==

Rural Representatives consist of Village Representatives and Kaifong Representatives.

The Court of Final Appeal ruled that the Secretary for Home Affairs had to consider whether the person elected to represent a village was elected in accordance with electoral arrangements consistent with the Bill of Rights and the Sex Discrimination Ordinance whether to approve an elected Village Representative in December 2000. This decision caused Hong Kong Government to set up new arrangements for Village Representative. There are two types of Village Representatives, namely
* Indigenous Inhabitant Representative representing indigenous inhabitants of an Indigenous Village; and
* Resident Representative representing all residents of an Existing Village

Indigenous Inhabitant of an Indigenous Village that existed in 1898 (whether or not the name the Village now has is the same name it had in 1898) refers to:
* a person who was in 1898 a resident of the Village; or
* a person who is descended through the male line from a person mentioned above.

In 2013, the new Village Representative Election Ordinance has been implemented that the Kaifong Representatives from Cheung Chau and Peng Chau are regulated by the Home Affairs Department. The first new arrangements Village Representative elections was held in 2019. The next Village Representative elections would be held in 2023.

<text>Good Riddance () is a 1980 French-language Canadian drama film. Directed by Francis Mankiewicz and written by Réjean Ducharme, the film concerns Manon (Charlotte Laurier), an unstable young girl who lives with her mother Michelle (Marie Tifo) and her alcoholic and intellectually disabled uncle Ti-Guy (Germain Houde).

Starting as the first screenplay by the novelist Ducharme, the film was shot by Mankiewicz and cinematographer Michel Brault on a low budget. It debuted at the Berlin International Film Festival and won several Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture. It was established as a classic Canadian film, with the Toronto International Film Festival repeatedly placing it in the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. The film was selected as the Canadian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 53rd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

==Plot==
Manon is a precocious 13-year-old girl living with her mother Michelle and intellectually challenged uncle Ti-Guy in the Laurentides. Manon wants to quit school and obtain the true love of her mother, whom she accuses of not loving her. Michelle is pregnant with the child of Maurice, a police officer who tries to convince her to give up caring for Ti-Guy, by placing him in an institution. Ti-Guy is frequently stealing from Michelle, drinking excessively, driving dangerously and stalking the family&#x27;s wealthy female neighbour. Maurice also pressures Michelle to get an abortion. Michelle is determined to have the child, and insistent on keeping Ti-Guy with her.

Manon strongly dislikes Ti-Guy for his misbehavior and Maurice for being a cop, and when Michelle tells Manon of her pregnancy, Manon becomes upset. Manon prefers Gaetan, Michelle&#x27;s former lover who gives her marijuana, and also steals the book &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; from their neighbour and starts reading it.

On her birthday, Manon runs away for a time and phones her mother asking for her exclusive love, which Michelle takes as hurtful. After Manon comes back, she tells Michelle that Maurice molested her, at which point Michelle angrily chases Maurice away. Michelle consequently begins dining with Gaetan and Manon, with Manon promising to no longer hurt her. Confronting Ti-Guy in his vehicle, Manon screams at him and convinces him to commit suicide by crashing the vehicle. While sleeping with her mother, Manon receives Maurice&#x27;s call about the death, but shields Michelle from the news.

==Themes==
There have been numerous interpretations of the film. Critic Ian Lockerbie suggested the film is an allegory for Quebec nationhood in the aftermath of the 1980 Quebec referendum, substituting nationalism for victimization. However, author Peter Morris replies English Canadian films were exploring similar themes at the time and that &quot;Les bons débarras&quot; was made before the referendum. Author Chris Gittings observes interpretations of &quot;Les bons débarras&quot; as symbolism of Quebec as being a victim of English Canada, and writes that the film depicts class inequality in Quebec society, given the impoverished state of Michelle&#x27;s family.

Author Janis L. Pallister argues the film fits in Québécois cinema as introspective, and that it is about desire and envy and is in part psychological horror and political symbolism. Professor Claire Portelance, writing for &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, suggested the impoverished state of the family indicated the film&#x27;s message was that the Quiet Revolution did not improve the lives of Quebeckers, and that many things still looked like the past.

==Production==

The screenplay was written by Quebecois novelist Réjean Ducharme, marking his first attempt at writing a film. It was shot by Francis Mankiewicz at an inexpensive cost of about $600,000 in a &quot;Gothic&quot; style creating &quot;a sense of the menace of evil.&quot; Mankiewicz had selected Michel Brault as his cinematographer, aiming for a textured look without high contrasts. They also took inspiration from the paintings of Edward Hopper. Filming took place in 1979.

In 1981, Mankiewicz said the character of Manon symbolizes a romantic outlook, whereas Michelle was more realistic. &quot;Manon is the filmmaker and Michelle is the everyday person in me. I am a dreamer,&quot; he said. The film was produced by Productions Prisma, based in Montreal.

==Release==
The film was first screened in the 30th Berlin International Film Festival in 1980. It subsequently had a release in France. As the film is in Canadian French, a survey found 48% of viewers in France had difficulty understanding it. It opened in Kentucky in October 1981. &quot;Les bons débarras&quot; was seen by more people than any French Canadian film since &quot;Mon oncle Antoine&quot; (1971), but it was later eclipsed by Denys Arcand&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot; (1986) and &quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; (1989).

In 2013, the film was given a 4K resolution restoration by the Elephant project and Quebecor and screened at the Lumière Film Festival in Lyon, France, on 14 October 2014. The Elephant restoration subsequently screened in the classics section of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic in July 2015.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Good Riddance&quot; is widely considered one of the classic films in both Quebec and Canadian cinema. Don Haig of the National Film Board of Canada said it was considered &quot;one of the great Quebecois films of all time.&quot; The Toronto International Film Festival ranked it in the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time three times, in 1984, 1993 and 2004. In 1998, &quot;Take One&quot; named it as one of the 20 best Canadian films, writing &quot;the kid is a dangerously compelling seductress who wreaks havoc out of a need to control those she loves.&quot; It was selected for preservation in 2006 by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada, a charitable non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the preservation of Canada’s audio-visual heritage. In 2015, &quot;La Presse&quot; columnist Marc Cassivi named it one of Quebec&#x27;s best films, saying Mankiewicz&#x27;s intimate direction and Ducharme&#x27;s poetic writing blended particularly well, citing Manon&#x27;s speech about a flower growing out of her and her mother&#x27;s blood.

The film received less favourable reviews in the United States. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a meandering movie with a curious kind of staying power.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote &quot;Mankiewicz possesses a dark, provocative sensibility, yet he isn&#x27;t sufficiently in control of his medium to produce a coherent work out of his conflicting moods.&quot; Conversely, David Denby of &quot;New York&quot; wrote the Manon character was &quot;a little monster&quot; but heart-breaking, and that Jean Cocteau would have admired the film. William Mootz of &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; in Louisville, Kentucky wrote the film &quot;has obviously been much admired in Canada, and with good reasons. It is a beautifully acted movie, filmed with an almost painful sincerity under the direction of Francis Mankiewicz.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film won the Genie Award for Best Canadian Film, along with seven other Genies, including for best original screenplay. It was selected as the Canadian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 53rd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

<doc id="1243189" wikidata="Q1155870" url="?curid=1243189" title="USB mass storage device class">
<text>The USB mass storage device class (also known as USB MSC or UMS) is a set of computing communications protocols, specifically a USB Device Class, defined by the USB Implementers Forum that makes a USB device accessible to a host computing device and enables file transfers between the host and the USB device. To a host, the USB device acts as an external hard drive; the protocol set interfaces with a number of storage devices.

== Uses ==
Devices connected to computers via this standard include:
* External magnetic hard drives
* External optical drives, including CD and DVD reader and writer drives
* USB flash drives
* Solid-state drives
* Adapters between standard flash memory cards and USB connections
* Digital cameras
* Portable media players
* Card readers
* PDAs
* Mobile phones

Devices supporting this standard are known as MSC (Mass Storage Class) devices. While MSC is the original abbreviation, UMS (Universal Mass Storage) has also come into common use.

== Operating system support ==
Most mainstream operating systems include support for USB mass storage devices; support on older systems is usually available through patches.

=== Microsoft Windows ===
Microsoft Windows has supported MSC since Windows 2000. There is no support for USB supplied by Microsoft in Windows before Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. Windows 95 OSR2.1, an update to the operating system, featured limited support for USB. During that time no generic USB mass-storage driver was produced by Microsoft (including for Windows 98), and a device-specific driver was needed for each type of USB storage device. Third-party, freeware drivers became available for Windows 98 and Windows 98SE, and third-party drivers are also available for Windows NT 4.0. Windows 2000 has support (via a generic driver) for standard USB mass-storage devices; Windows Me and all later Windows versions also include support.

Windows Mobile supports accessing most USB mass-storage devices formatted with FAT on devices with USB Host. However, portable devices typically cannot provide enough power for hard-drive disk enclosures (a hard drive typically requires the maximum 2.5 W in the USB specification) without a self-powered USB hub. A Windows Mobile device cannot display its file system as a mass-storage device unless the device implementer adds that functionality. However, third-party applications add MSC emulation to most WM devices (commercial Softick CardExport and free WM5torage). Only memory cards (not internal-storage memory) can generally be exported, due to file-systems issues; see device access, below.

The AutoRun feature of Windows worked on all removable media, allowing USB storage devices to become a portal for computer viruses. Beginning with Windows 7, Microsoft limited AutoRun to CD and DVD drives, updating previous Windows versions.

=== MS-DOS ===
Neither MS-DOS nor most compatible operating systems included support for USB. Third-party generic drivers, such as Duse, USBASPI and DOSUSB, are available to support USB mass-storage devices. FreeDOS supports USB mass storage as an Advanced SCSI Programming Interface (ASPI) interface.

=== Classic Mac OS and macOS ===
Apple&#x27;s Mac OS 9 and macOS support USB mass storage; Mac OS 8.6 supported USB mass storage through an optional driver.

=== Linux ===
The Linux kernel has supported USB mass-storage devices since version 2.3.47 (2001, backported to kernel 2.2.18). This support includes quirks and silicon/firmware bug workarounds as well as additional functionality for devices and controllers (vendor-enabled functions such as ATA command pass-through for ATA-USB bridges, used for S.M.A.R.T. or temperature monitoring, controlling the spin-up and spin-down of hard disk drives, and other options). Mobile devices running Android 6 or higher also support USB mass storage through dual-role USB on USB-C ports, and USB-OTG on older ports.

=== Other Unix-related systems ===
Solaris has supported devices since its version 2.8 (1998), NetBSD since its version 1.5 (2000), FreeBSD since its version 4.0 (2000) and OpenBSD since its version 2.7 (2000). Digital UNIX (later known as Tru64 UNIX), has supported USB and USB mass-storage devices since its version 4.0E (1998). AIX has supported USB mass-storage devices since its 5.3 T9 and 6.1 T3 versions; however, it is not well-supported and lacks features such as partitioning and general blocking.

=== Game consoles and embedded devices ===
The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 support most mass-storage devices for the data transfer of media such as pictures and music. As of April 2010, the Xbox 360 (a) used a mass-storage device for saved games and the PS3 allowed transfers between devices on a mass-storage device. Independent developers have released drivers for the TI-84 Plus and TI-84 Plus Silver Edition to access USB mass-storage devices. In these calculators, the usb8x driver supports the msd8x user-interface application.

==Device access==

The USB mass-storage specification provides an interface to a number of industry-standard command sets, allowing a device to disclose its subclass. In practice, there is little support for specifying a command set via its subclass; most drivers only support the SCSI transparent command set, designating their subset of the SCSI command set with their SCSI Peripheral Device Type (PDT). Subclass codes specify the following command sets:
# Reduced Block Commands (RBC)
# SFF-8020i, MMC-2 (used by ATAPI-style CD and DVD drives)
# QIC-157 (tape drives)
# Uniform Floppy Interface (UFI)
# SFF-8070i (used by ARMD-style devices)
# SCSI transparent command set (use &quot;inquiry&quot; to obtain the PDT)

The specification does not require a particular file system on conforming devices. Based on the specified command set and any subset, it provides a means to read and write sectors of data (similar to the low-level interface used to access a hard drive). Operating systems may treat a USB mass-storage device like a hard drive; users may partition it in any format (such as MBR and GPT), and format it with any file system.

Because of its relative simplicity, the most common file system on embedded devices such as USB flash drives, cameras, or digital audio players is Microsoft&#x27;s FAT or FAT32 file system (with optional support for long filenames). However, USB mass storage devices may be formatted with any other file system, such as NTFS on Windows NT, HFS Plus on macOS, ext2 on Linux, or Unix File System on Solaris or BSD. This choice may limit (or prevent) access to a device&#x27;s contents by equipment using a different operating system. OS-dependent storage options include LVM, partition tables and software encryption.

In cameras, MP3 players and similar devices which must access a file system independent of an external host, the FAT32 file system is preferred by manufacturers. All such devices halt their file-system (dismount) before making it available to a host operating system to prevent file-system corruption or other damage (although it is theoretically possible for both devices to use read-only mode or a cluster file system). Some devices have a write-protection switch (or option) allowing them to be used in read-only mode.

Two main partitioning schemes are used by vendors of pre-formatted devices. One puts the file system (usually FAT32) directly on the device without partitioning, making it start from sector 0 without additional boot sectors, headers or partitions. The other uses a DOS partition table (and MBR code), with one partition spanning the entire device. This partition is often aligned to a high power of two of the sectors (such as 1 or 2 MB), common in solid state drives for performance and durability. Some devices with embedded storage resembling a USB mass-storage device (such as MP3 players with a USB port) will report a damaged (or missing) file system if they are reformatted with a different file system. However, most default-partition devices may be repartitioned (by reducing the first partition and file system) with additional partitions. Such devices will use the first partition for their own operations; after connecting to the host system, all partitions are available.

Devices connected by a single USB port may function as multiple USB devices, one of which is a USB mass-storage device. This simplifies distribution and access to drivers and documentation, primarily for the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X operating systems. Such drivers are required to make full use of the device, usually because it does not fit a standard USB class or has additional functionality. An embedded USB mass-storage device makes it possible to install additional drivers without CD-ROM disks, floppies or Internet access to a vendor website; this is important, since many modern systems are supplied without optical or floppy drives. Internet access may be unavailable because the device provides network access (wireless, GSM or Ethernet cards). The embedded USB mass storage is usually made permanently read-only by the vendor, preventing accidental corruption and use for other purposes (although it may be updated with proprietary protocols when performing a firmware upgrade). Advantages of this method of distribution are lower cost, simplified installation and ensuring driver portability.

== Design ==
Some advanced hard disk drive commands, such as Tagged Command Queuing and Native Command Queuing (which may increase performance), ATA Secure Erase (which allows all data on the drive to be securely erased) and S.M.A.R.T. (accessing indicators of drive reliability) exist as extensions to low-level drive command sets such as SCSI, ATA and ATAPI. These features may not work when the drives are placed in a disk enclosure that supports a USB mass-storage interface. Some USB mass-storage interfaces are generic, providing basic read-write commands; although that works well for basic data transfers with devices containing hard drives, there is no simple way to send advanced, device-specific commands to such USB mass-storage devices (though, devices may create their own communication protocols over a standard USB control interface). The USB Attached SCSI (UAS) protocol, introduced in USB 3.0, fixes several of these issues, including command queuing, command pipes for hardware requiring them, and power management.

Specific USB 2.0 chipsets had proprietary methods of achieving SCSI pass-through, which could be used to read S.M.A.R.T. data from drives using tools such as smartctl (using the option followed by &quot;chipset&quot;). More recent USB storage chipsets support the SCSI / ATA Translation (SAT) as a generic protocol for interacting with ATA (and SATA) devices. Using esoteric ATA or SCSI pass-through commands (such as secure-erase or password protection) when a drive is connected via a USB bridge may cause drive failure, especially with the hdparm utility.

<text>Tamir Goodman (; born January 18, 1982) is a former American-Israeli professional basketball player. He was dubbed the &quot;Jewish Jordan&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine.

After playing basketball for the Talmudical Academy of Baltimore in 11th grade, he was ranked the 25th-best high school player in the country, with an average of 35.4 points per game. He accepted a scholarship from Towson University. Goodman then moved to Israel and signed a 3-year contract with Maccabi Tel Aviv in 2002. He was loaned to Giv&#x27;at Shmuel for the 2002–03 season, then played for Elitzur Kiryat Ata in the 2003–04 season, and returned to Giva&#x27;t Shmuel for the 2005–06 season.

==Early life==
Goodman grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, in an Orthodox Jewish family with six brothers and two sisters. He began playing basketball at five years of age, but he first garnered national attention as a junior in high school, averaging 35.4 points per game for the Talmudical Academy of Baltimore. In 11th grade, he was ranked the 25th-best high school player in the country, and was dubbed the &quot;Jewish Jordan&quot;. Goodman graduated from Takoma Academy of Takoma Park, Maryland, in 2000.

== College career ==
Goodman received a scholarship offer to the University of Maryland, which had one of the top-ranked basketball teams in the country. The team&#x27;s schedule included activities on Friday nights and Saturdays (against the rules of Orthodox Judaism). Maryland&#x27;s coaching staff and Tamir had friction over his refusal to play on the Sabbath, so he declined Maryland&#x27;s offer.

Instead, Goodman accepted a scholarship from nearby Towson University. Goodman was the first freshman to start at Towson in eleven seasons. He averaged 6 points, 4 assists, and 2.5 rebounds per game in his freshman year in 2000–2001, and was awarded the coach&#x27;s award for his performance on the court and in the classroom. Goodman continued at Towson for his sophomore campaign until December 2001, when Goodman filed a complaint that the newly hired coach allegedly assaulted him.

== Professional career ==

=== Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C. (2002) ===
Goodman fulfilled a dream of his by moving to Israel and signing a 3-year contract with Maccabi Tel Aviv on July 22, 2002.

=== Giv&#x27;at Shmuel (2002–2003) ===
To get more playing time, Goodman was loaned to Giv&#x27;at Shmuel for the 2002–03 season.

=== Elitzur Kiryat Ata (2003–2004) ===
Goodman played for Elitzur Kiryat Ata in the 2003–04 season.

=== Return to Giv&#x27;at (2005–2006) ===
Goodman went on to serve in the Israeli Defense Force, a requirement for all Israeli citizens. He suffered a knee injury that required major surgery. After nine months of intensive physical therapy, he beat the odds and returned to Giva&#x27;t Shmuel to fulfill his contract for the 2005–06 season.

=== Maccabi Shoham (2006–2007) ===
Still recovering from his injury, Goodman dropped down to Liga Leumit to play for Maccabi Shoham. In his first two games, he played more than 20 minutes and scored close to 20 points a game. But in December 2006, Goodman&#x27;s left knee gave out again and his doctors ordered him to undergo weeks of physical therapy. He did not get to play again until March 2007.

=== Maryland Nighthawks (2008) ===
In late 2007, Goodman moved back to Maryland to play for the Maryland Nighthawks of the newly formed Premier Basketball League (the league began play in January 2008). In his first game, he suffered a complex dislocation of his finger which required surgery and a year of physical therapy.

=== Maccabi Haifa (2008) ===
In July 2008, Goodman signed with Maccabi Haifa. After shattering several bones in his left hand in practice, Goodman was unable to play the remainder of the season.

<doc id="1243208" wikidata="Q83772" url="?curid=1243208" title="Toplessness">
<text>Toplessness refers to the state in which a woman&#x27;s breasts, including her areolas and nipples, are exposed, especially in a public place or in a visual medium. The male equivalent is known as barechestedness.

Social norms around toplessness vary by context and location. Many indigenous societies consider breast exposure to be normal and uncontroversial. At specific beaches and resort destinations, notably in Europe and Australia, girls and women may sunbathe topless either by statute or by custom. However, in most countries, norms of female modesty require girls and women to cover their breasts in public, and many jurisdictions prosecute public toplessness as indecent exposure. The topfreedom movement opposes such laws on the grounds of gender equality.

Art and visual media throughout history, from painting and sculpture to film and photography, have frequently featured toplessness. Such representations are often defended on the grounds of artistic merit; toplessness may also be defended on educational, medical, or political grounds. Toplessness also features prominently in erotica, pornography, and at adult venues ranging from strip clubs to upmarket cabarets (such as the Moulin Rouge).

== Usage and connotations ==
The word &quot;topless&quot; usually refers to a woman whose breasts, including her areolas and nipples, are exposed to public view. It can describe a woman who appears, poses, or performs with her breasts exposed, such as a &quot;topless model&quot; or &quot;topless dancer&quot;, or to an activity undertaken while not wearing a top, such as &quot;topless sunbathing&quot;. It may indicate a designated location where one might expect to find women not wearing tops, such as a &quot;topless beach&quot; or &quot;topless bar&quot;. It can also be used to describe a garment that is specifically designed to reveal the breasts, such as the &quot;topless swimsuit&quot; (also known as the monokini) designed by Rudi Gernreich in the 1960s.

The word &quot;topless&quot; may carry sexual or exhibitionist connotations. Because of this, advocates of women&#x27;s legal right to uncover their breasts wherever men may go bare-chested have adopted the alternative term &quot;topfree&quot;, which is not perceived to have these connotations.

===Barechestedness===

Barechestedness is the state of a man or boy wearing no clothes above the waist, exposing the upper torso. Bare male chests are generally considered acceptable in or around the house; at beaches, swimming pools and sunbathing areas; when exercising outside in hot weather; and in certain outdoor construction work settings. However, some stores and restaurants have a &quot;no shirt, no service&quot; rule to prevent barechested men from coming inside. While going barechested at outdoor activities may be acceptable, it is taboo in workplaces, churches and other formal settings.

In most societies, male barechestedness is much more common than female toplessness, even among children. Exposure of the male pectoral muscles is often considered to be far less taboo than of the female breasts, despite some considering them equally erogenous. Male barechestedness is often ascribed to practical reasons such as heat, or the ability to move the body without being restricted by an upper body garment. In several sports, such as swimming and boxing, it is encouraged or even obligatory for males to be barechested. Barechestedness may also be used as a display of power, or to draw attention to oneself, especially if the upper body muscles are well-developed.

=== Exposure ===

The cultural tendency to hide the female nipple under clothing has existed in Western culture since the 19th century. As female nipples are often perceived an intimate part, covering them might have originated under Victorian morality as with riding side saddle. Exposing the entire breast and nipple is a form of protest for some and a crime for others. The exposure of nipples is usually considered immodest and in some instances is viewed as lewd or indecent behavior.

A case in Erie, Pennsylvania, concerning the exposure of breasts and nipple proceeded to the US Supreme Court, City of Erie v. Pap&#x27;s A. M.. The Erie ordinance was regulating the nipple in public as an act that is committed when a person &quot;knowingly or intentionally, ... appears in a state of nudity commits Public Indecency.&quot; Later in the statute, nudity is further described as an uncovered female nipple. But nipple exposure of a man was not regulated. An opinion column credited to Cecil Adams noted: &quot;Ponder the significance of that. A man walks around bare-chested and the worst that happens is he won&#x27;t get served in restaurants. But a woman who goes topless is legally in the same boat as if she&#x27;d had sex in public. That may seem crazy, but in the US it&#x27;s a permissible law.&quot;

The legality around the exposure of nipples is inconsistently regulated throughout the US. Some states do not allow the visualization of any part of the breast. Other jurisdictions prohibit any female chest anatomy by banning anatomical structures that lie below the top of the areola or nipple. Such is the case in West Virginia and Massachusetts. West Virginia&#x27;s regulation is very specific and is not likely to be misinterpreted, stating: &quot;[The] display of &#x27;any portion of the cleavage of the human female breast exhibited by a dress, blouse, skirt, leotard, bathing suit, or other wearing apparel [is permitted] provided the areola is not exposed, in whole or in part.

Instagram has a &quot;no nipples&quot; policy with exceptions: material that is not allowed includes &quot;some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too&quot;. Previously, Instagram had removed images of nursing mothers. Instagram removed images of Rihanna and had her account cancelled in 2014 when she posted selfies with nipples. This was incentive for the Twitter campaign #FreeTheNipple. In 2016, an Instagram page invited users to post images of nipples from both sexes; @genderless_nipples, which displays close ups of both the nipples of men and women for the purpose of spotlighting what may be inconsistency. Some contributors have circumvented the policy. Facebook has also been struggling to define its nipple policy.

Filmmaker Lina Esco made a film entitled &quot;Free the Nipple&quot;, which is about &quot;laws against female toplessness or restrictions on images of female, but not male, nipples&quot;, which Esco states is an example of sexism in society.

== In traditional societies ==

Attitudes towards toplessness have varied considerably across cultures and over time. The lack of clothing above the waist for both females and males was the norm in traditional cultures of North America, Africa, Australia and the Pacific Islands until the arrival of Christian missionaries, and it continues to be the norm in many indigenous cultures today. The practice was also the norm in various Asian cultures before Muslim expansion in the 13th and 14th centuries.

=== Minoan civilization===
During the Middle Minoan era (2000–1600 BCE), women wore close-fitting blouses that were cut low in the front and exposed the breasts. The breasts were further emphasized by a narrow waist, similar to the shape that corsets gave women during the late 19th century.

===India===
In certain parts of northern India, some women did not wear an upper garment except during winter before the Muslim conquest of India. Women and men typically wore an antriya on the lower body and were nude from the waist up, aside from pieces of jewelry. This was the standard form of dress unless women opted to wear a sari, in which case they covered their upper bodies with a robe.

Toplessness was the norm for women among several communities of South India and Sri Lanka until the 19th or early 20th century. Such communities included the Tamils along the Coromandel Coast, Tiyan and other peoples on the Malabar Coast, Kadar of Cochin Island, Toda, Cheruman (Pulayar), Kuruba, Koraga, Nicobarese, and the Uriya.

===Thailand===
In traditional Thai society, women dressed similarly to men, wearing only a loose lower garment while normally being bare-breasted. Before the introduction of Western dress codes, Thai women were depicted both fully clothed and topless in public. Until the early 20th century, women from northern Thailand wore a long tube-skirt (&quot;Pha-Sin&quot;), tied high above their waist and below their breasts, which were uncovered. In the late 19th century the influence of missionaries and modernization under King Chulalongkorn encouraged local women to cover their breasts with blouses. Between 1939 and 1942, the government of Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram issued a series of cultural standards; Mandate 10, issued on 8 September 1941, instructed Thai people not to appear in public places &quot;without being appropriately dressed&quot;. Inappropriate dress included &quot;wearing no shirt or wearing a wraparound cloth&quot;.

===Laos===
In Laos, Frenchman Henri Mouhot took a picture in 1858 of Laotian women that depicted virgins with clothed breasts and married women with their entire breasts exposed in public, because the baring of breasts for breastfeeding was considered to be nonsexual.

===Indonesia===

In the Indonesian archipelago, toplessness was the norm among the Dayak, Javanese, and the Balinese people of Indonesia before the introduction of Islam and contact with Western cultures. In Javanese and Balinese societies, women had gone topless to work or rest comfortably. Among the Dayak, only big-breasted women or married women with sagging breasts covered their breasts because their breasts interfered with their work.

===Middle East===
In most Middle Eastern countries, toplessness has not been socially accepted since at least the beginning of Islam (7th century), because of Islamic standards for female modesty. However, toplessness was the norm in some pre-Islamic cultures in Arabia, Egypt, Assyria and Mesopotamia. Tunisia and Egypt are an exception among Arabic states, allowing foreign tourists to swim topless on private beaches.

===Africa===
Among Himba women of northern Namibia and Hamar of southern Ethiopia, besides other traditional groups in Africa, the social norm is for women to be bare-breasted. Female toplessness can also constitute an important aspect of indigenous cultural celebrations. For example, in the annual Reed Dance festival mature girls between the ages of 16 and 20 dance topless before the Zulu king.

===Australia===
Traditional topless practices can lead to cross-cultural and legal conflict. In 2004, Australian police banned members of the Papunya community from using a public park in the city of Alice Springs to practice a traditional Aboriginal dance that included topless women.

===Korea===
In the 16th century, women&#x27;s &quot;jeogori&quot; (an upper garment) was long, wide, and covered the waist. The length of women&#x27;s &quot;jeogori&quot; gradually shortened: it was approximately 65 cm in the 16th century, 55 cm in the 17th century, 45 cm in the 18th century, and 28 cm in the 19th century, with some as short as 14.5 cm. A &quot;heoritti&quot; (허리띠) or &quot;jorinmal&quot; (졸잇말) was worn to cover the breasts. The trend of wearing a short &quot;jeogori&quot; with a &quot;heoritti&quot; was started by the &quot;gisaeng&quot; and soon spread to women of the upper class. Among women of the common and lowborn classes, a practice emerged in which they revealed their breasts after childbirth to proudly indicate that they had given birth to a son, i.e., a male heir.

Travelers like the American Harry A. Franck remarked that they &quot;displayed to the public gaze exactly that portion of the torso which the women of most nations take pains to conceal&quot;.

===South Pacific===

In the South Pacific, toplessness was common prior to contact with Western missionaries, but is less common today. On the French territory of Moorea, toplessness is common. In the Marshall Islands, women were traditionally topless before contact with Western missionaries and still do not sexually objectify female breasts as is common in much of Western society. Marshall Island women typically swim in their muumuus which today are made of a fine polyester that dries quickly. Wearing of bikinis and one-piece, breast-covering swimsuits in the Marshall Islands is mainly seen at Western, restricted-access beaches and swimming pools like those at private resorts or on United States government facilities on the Kwajalein Atoll within the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site.

=== Vietnam ===
During the Vietnam War, American GIs encountered the Montagnards, native inhabitants of the Central Highlands, whose women Infantry Lieutenant A.T. Lawrence described &quot;completely uninhibited in their bare-breasted nakedness&quot;.

=== Japan ===
In traditional Japanese society, topless nudity (&quot;hadanugi&quot;) and complete nudity (&quot;maru hadaka&quot;) were widely accepted culturally and morally for both men and women, with the exception of the samurai aristocracy. It was not uncommon to see women, young and old, with torso exposed. Francis Hall, 1861, described such an encounter: &quot;The screens of the house are wide open to the street for the summer fervors are great and a half dozen women, married as their black teeth denote, are lying face downwards and leaning upon their elbows on the mats. Each one has thrown off her upper garments from her shoulders and is bare to the waist balancing this nudity by tucking up her lower garments till her legs are left bare to her thighs. Their faces are to the center of the room and their feet describe the periphery of a circle.&quot;

== In Western societies ==
In most Western societies, it is a cultural norm for girls after puberty, if not earlier, to have their breasts covered especially while in a public place, as an act of modesty. At least, it is not culturally acceptable for women to expose their nipples and areolas in public. Though many women do not regard their breasts as sexual, most would not go against the social norm, let alone challenge various laws that cover toplessness. Until recent times, women who went topless in a public place may have been cited for indecent exposure, lewdness or similar laws. Women and the law in most Western countries generally do not regard breasts as indecent. Some women campaign for what they call &quot;topfreedom&quot;, seeking to change these laws. The strictness of the etiquette varies depending on the social context. For example, at specific cultural events the norm may be relaxed, such as at Fantasy Fest, at Mardi Gras in New Orleans and at the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. The same may also apply at designated topless beaches.

=== Public breast-baring fashions ===
In many European societies between the Renaissance and the 19th century, exposed breasts were acceptable while a woman&#x27;s bared legs, ankles or shoulders were considered risqué. During the Renaissance, many artists were strongly influenced by classical Greek styles and culture, and images of nude and semi-nude subjects in many forms proliferated in art, sculpture and architecture of the period. In aristocratic and upper-class circles the display of breasts also invoked associations with classical Greek nude sculptures and art and a classic breast shape was at times regarded as a status symbol, as a sign of beauty, wealth or social position. To maintain youthful-looking bosoms women could employ wet nurses to breastfeed their children.

Breast-baring female fashions have been traced to 15th-century courtesan Agnès Sorel, mistress to Charles VII of France, whose gowns in the French court sometimes exposed one or both of her breasts. (Jean Fouquet&#x27;s portrayal of the Virgin Mary with her left breast uncovered is believed to have taken Sorel as a model.) Aristocratic women sought to immortalise their breasts in paint, as in the case of Simonetta Vespucci, whose portrait with exposed breasts was painted by Piero di Cosimo in c. 1480. During the 16th century, women&#x27;s fashions displaying their breasts were common in society, from Queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes.

Similar fashions became popular in England during the 17th century when they were worn by Queen Mary II and by Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England, for whom architect Inigo Jones designed a masque costume that fully revealed both of her breasts.

In a survey of 190 different societies, researches found that very few associated exposed breasts with sexuality, but that there was an insistence that women conceal their breasts. Different standards apply to art, with one example being the dome of the United States Capitol featuring an 1865 fresco depicting goddesses with their breasts exposed.

=== Social attitudes ===
Although some social attitudes to increased body exposure began to soften during the late 1960s, contemporary Western societies still generally view toplessness unfavorably. During a short period in 1964, &quot;topless&quot; dress designs appeared at fashion shows, but those who wore the dresses in public found themselves arrested on indecency charges. However, toplessness has come to be a feature in contemporary haute couture fashion shows.

A wide-ranging review of 190 different societies during 1951 found that few insisted that women conceal their breasts. In Europe, topless swimming and sunbathing on public beaches has become socially acceptable. In 1994–95, Australian researchers asked 118 college-age students to rate the behavior of women who go topless on an 8-point scale, ranging from &quot;Women should have the same right to go topless as men&quot; to &quot;Topless women are exhibitionists&quot;. They found that 88% of Australian university students of either gender considered it acceptable for women to go topless on public beaches, although they felt that women exposing their breasts in other contexts, such as public parks, was inappropriate. They did not find a correlation between exposed breasts and sexuality in social situations.

A more recent study of 116 college-age women in Australia found that those who had gone topless were more accepting of toplessness generally, more sexual, and had higher self-esteem and higher body image. In contemporary society, the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context. Women&#x27;s swimsuits and bikinis commonly reveal the tops and sides of the breasts. Displaying cleavage is considered permissible in many settings, and is even a sign of elegance and sophistication on many formal social occasions, but it may be prohibited by dress codes in settings such as workplaces and schools, where sexualized displays of the female breast may be considered inappropriate. In a number of cultures, including Europe and other Westernized countries outside the United States, there are fewer social restrictions against sunbathing or swimming topless. Despite being illegal or socially proscribed in many places in the United States, topless beaches have majority legislative support in some areas.

In Canada, a poll in 1992 found that 38% favored general female public toplessness. Following that survey, several legal rulings in Canadian courts from 1996 to 2000 made public toplessness legal, but very few women go topless in public.

Some cultures have even begun to expand social prohibitions on female toplessness to prepubescent and even infant girls. This trend toward covering the female nipple from infancy onward is particularly noticeable in the United States, Eastern Asia and the Middle East, but is much less common in Europe.

== In politics and law ==
Political attitudes and laws vary greatly around the world in regards to female toplessness.

===Asia===
====Taiwan====
In support of Icelandic student Adda Smaradottir&#x27;s FreeTheNipple act in public cyberspace, young women uploaded their topless photos to Facebook and protested against its Community Standards of considering women&#x27;s breasts as sexual materials. Those photos and related news articles were blocked initially, but Facebook considered those photos did not violate Community Standards.

===Europe===
====Denmark====
Bathing and sunbathing in the nude (including topless) is legal on Danish beaches. Nudity and toplessness in other public outdoor places is generally also legal, unless it involves &quot;offensive conduct&quot; or is likely to cause public outrage. The public outrage law is rarely used in practice, but in 1972 audience members were convicted of being nude in the Royal Danish Theatre. In December 2007, a group of women and men calling themselves Topless Front swam topless in public swim baths to promote topless equality. In March 2008, after a campaign by the group, Copenhagen&#x27;s Culture and Leisure Committee voted to allow topless bathing in its swimming pools. After the committee had voted, it was revealed that no laws had existed against topless bathing, effectively making the vote unnecessary. However, some public baths had (and have) restricted it themselves. Public breastfeeding is supported by the vast majority of both sexes in Denmark, is entirely legal and accepted in almost all places, except for a few private cafés and restaurants that have restricted it.

====Finland====
In Finland, toplessness is not illegal, yet topless women have been removed from beaches. Sandra Marins and Säde Vallarén criticized this and organized Finland&#x27;s first event demanding topless equality, called Tissiflashmob (Breast flash mob). On Finland&#x27;s Independence day, 6 December 2019, both Marins and Vallarén showed their breasts on live TV and it sparked a lot of conversation. Tissiflashmob 2020 was bigger than the previous one, now organized at the same time in eight different cities.

====France====
In France, the feminist collective Les TumulTueuses organized a topfree protest in Paris in May 2009. It is legal to sunbathe topless in France, although local regulations may ban the practice with directives about clothing. In 2020, after a police incident, topless sunbathing was defended by the French interior minister.

====Germany====

There are few legal restriction on public nudity in Germany. A number of court cases have established a &quot;de facto&quot; right to nudity in the vicinity of beaches, which is broadly tolerated.

Swimming pools, whether private or public, can establish their own dress regulations. In 2022, a woman in Berlin was told to cover up her chest at a public swimming pool, and was forced to leave when she refused to do so. This led to a successful legal complaint on the basis of gender discrimination, as the men at the pool were not similarly obligated to cover their chests. In March 2023, the city&#x27;s pool authorities updated their regulations to permit all guests to be topless, regardless of gender. Several other German cities, such as Dresden, Göttingen, and Hannover, have also issued rules explicitly recognizing that persons of all genders have a right to be topless at public swimming pools.

Nudity in nature is a legal gray area, as it is not specifically forbidden, but can be treated as a public nuisance in the event of a complaint. Security services and law enforcement agencies may ask women to cover their breasts, usually under § 118 of the &quot;Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz&quot;, which forbids vaguely defined &quot;nuisances to public order&quot;. For parks and swimming areas owned or operated by a municipality or private company, the house regulations apply. These house regulations commonly specify that women, but not men, must cover their chests, and are increasingly seen as discriminatory.

Courts have protected the right to nudity at home and on one&#x27;s own property, even if visible to others. Nudity on one&#x27;s own property can only be restricted in very exceptional circumstances, usually limited to cases involving &quot;moral or sexual harassment&quot;.

====Greece====
In Greece, toplessness is legal.

====Iceland====
In Iceland, toplessness is legal in public.

====Italy====
Female toplessness has been officially legalized (in a nonsexual context) in all public beaches and swimming pools throughout the country (unless otherwise specified by region, province or municipality by-laws) on 20 March 2000, when the Supreme Court of Cassation (through sentence No. 3557) determined that the exposure of the nude female breast, after several decades, is now considered a &quot;commonly accepted behavior&quot;, and therefore, has &quot;entered into the social costume&quot;.

====Poland====
In Poland in 2008–2009, two women from Szczecin including glamour model Dorota Krzysztofek, won a court battle that reasserted the women&#x27;s right to sunbathe topless on public beaches. Krzysztofek, along with her female companion, were fined by local municipal officials for topless sunbathing at a public recreation area. The women refused to pay the fine and took the matter to Civil Court. Their first hearing had to be postponed due to remarkable media interest.

On November 7, 2008, judge Szczepańska upheld the city staff decision, and charged the women with indecent exposure, explaining that their personal freedoms cannot encroach on the freedoms of families with children who frequent the same recreation spot. Although topless sunbathing is not prohibited in Poland, the judge sentenced them to pay a fine of 230 zlotys (150 zlotys by different source, or €40, $55) for breaking the rules of conduct. In her rationale, the judge also said that it is not up to the defendants to teach youngsters human anatomy; however, her decision was appealed by Krzysztofek&#x27;s female friend soon afterwards, with the plea of not guilty.

In 2009, the appellate court declared both women to be innocent, because the city staff were unable to prove that anyone at the beach was indignant or scandalized by their toplessness, and no complaint was ever reported. On the contrary, some visitors stood up to their defense. There were no signs at the recreation area against what is otherwise legal. The appellate court&#x27;s decision was binding, but it also created an aura of ambivalence, with topless sunbathing in public declared acceptable only if nobody else including families with children formally objects to it.

====Romania====
In Romania, women are allowed to appear topless in public as long as it does not have sexual connotations.

====Spain====
There are no laws in Spain that officially prohibit public nudity (in a non-sexual context), and because of this, both topless sunbathing and naturism (the latter on a smaller scale) are frequently practiced without any issues in all beaches throughout the country, while the amount of partakers may vary depending on the location and the day. It is very common in the Balearic Islands, Canaries, Costa Brava and Costa del Sol (a few municipalities, such as Barcelona, have created by-laws to forbid public nudity, including female toplessness on their streets, not on the beach). Due to the widespread practice of topless sunbathing, the municipalities of Galdakao and L&#x27;Ametlla del Vallès decided to legalize female toplessness on their public pools (in March 2016 and June 2018, respectively), and it is tolerated in many others, like in Madrid (without the need of a specific rule). It is less common on private or condominium pools, and a few have by-laws to ban it. Moreover, there are some surveys indicating that more than 40% of the Spanish women who were interviewed (aged 18 or older) reported to have been topless on a beach at least once.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, toplessness is not illegal. It is a little unclear, because the law usually used against nudity is about &quot;annoying behaviour&quot; – it does not say anything about how undressed one can be, so it is a matter of legal tradition, although there is a law against gender discrimination. However, private or public establishments are permitted to establish dress codes which may require women to wear tops, and deny access or remove individuals who breach these standards. In September 2007, &quot;Bara Bröst&quot; (a pun meaning both &quot;Just Breasts&quot; and &quot;Bare Breasts&quot;) appeared to promote topless equality in these semi-public facilities. The group staged several events in public swim baths in September and October 2007, starting in Uppsala from which they were evicted several times, before succeeding in Sundsvall.

The group scored a victory in June 2009 when the Malmö city&#x27;s sports and recreation committee approved new rules that, while requiring everybody to wear bathing suits at indoor public swimming pools, did not require women to cover their breasts. &quot;We don&#x27;t define what bathing suits men should wear so it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to do it for women. And besides, it&#x27;s not unusual for men to have large breasts that resemble women&#x27;s breasts&quot;, said a council spokesman.

===North America===
====Canada====
In 1991 toplessness as an indecent act was challenged by Gwen Jacob in Guelph, Ontario, who removed her shirt and was charged with indecency. Part of her defense was the double standards between men and women. Although she was convicted, this was overturned by the Court of Appeal. This case determined that being topless is not indecent under the meaning of the Criminal Code. However it did not establish any constitutional right of equality. This case subsequently led to the acquittal of women in British Columbia and Saskatchewan who faced similar charges. Although each province and territory technically reserves its right to interpret the law as it pleases, the Ontario case has proven influential. Since the matter has not been determined by the Supreme Court of Canada, it is still possible that a woman could be convicted elsewhere in Canada, but interpretation of moral law in Canada has become increasingly liberalized. There do not appear to have been any further women charged in Canada since these cases were determined.

In February 2023, the cities of Edmonton and Calgary, both in the province of Alberta, changed their policies so that wearing bathing suit tops in city-operated pools was an individual&#x27;s choice.

====Mexico====
The only public place in Mexico that officially allows female toplessness is Playa Zipolite (a nude beach located in the state of Oaxaca), where the practice of naturism was legalized in 2016. However, the practice of topless sunbathing (as well as naturism in some cases) is commonly tolerated on a few beaches in the state of Quintana Roo, more precisely in the Riviera Maya region (especially between the cities of Playa del Carmen and Tulum); furthermore, there are a few clothing-optional resorts made for adults only (also located in the Riviera Maya) where all men and women aged 18 (or older) can frequent the facilities without the need to wear clothes (if so they wish).

====United States====
In the United States, states have primary jurisdiction in matters of public morality. The topfreedom movement has claimed success in a few instances in persuading some state and federal courts to overturn some state laws on the basis of sex discrimination or equal protection, arguing that a woman should be free to expose her chest in any context in which a man can expose his. Other successful cases have been on the basis of freedom of expression in protest, or simply that exposure of breasts is not indecent (or similar terminology).

Laws and ordinances barring female toplessness are being challenged in federal courts around the nation. Each lawsuit, if it prevails at the appellate level, will legalize topfreedom in the following U.S. circuit courts of appeals (from west to east): 9 (California), 8 (Missouri) and 1 (Maryland). A federal lawsuit in the 7th Circuit (Illinois), was lost at the appellate level and the petition for review by the U.S. Supreme Court was denied. A preliminary injunction in a federal lawsuit in the 10th Circuit (Colorado), was won at the appellate level. In September 2019, after spending over $300,000, Fort Collins decided to stop defending their ordinance and repeal it. That effectively gave females of all ages the right to go topless wherever males can in the jurisdiction of the 10th Circuit (Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma states as well as all counties and cities therein).

===Oceania===
====Australia====
In Australia, indecent exposure laws only refer to the genital area, so technically both male and female toplessness is legal. However, many local councils impose their own rules, and have the power to ask topless people to leave an area. Additionally, women who go topless are sometimes slapped with more vague charges such as being a public nuisance, or offensive behaviour.

On public beaches, local bylaws are not heavily enforced, and women can often sunbathe topless without legal repercussions.

Breastfeeding in public places is a legal right in Australia. Under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, no business or service provider can discriminate against a breastfeeding woman. Women can still breastfeed even if no other food/drink is allowed in the area. If a special baby care room is available for breastfeeding, women are not required to use it unless they wish to. If someone abuses a breastfeeding woman or forces her to leave, this may come under state/territory harassment laws. These protections also include women who are expressing breast milk for their baby.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, there is no specific law prohibiting nudity in public places. If a person is nude &quot;and&quot; also exhibiting lewd and lascivious, or obscene behaviour, then they may fall afoul of laws.

The High Court of New Zealand has upheld a conviction of disorderly conduct for nudity in the street, because it was not a place where nudity was known to occur or commonplace. Being nude in the street is likely to incur a small fine if a complaint is made against the person, or if the person ignores a police order to cover themselves. However, in practice, the likelihood of being prosecuted for nudity on a public beach is low, provided the person keeps to themselves.

In 2012, a woman swam topless on Ōpunake beach. The police were called, but informed the callers that toplessness was not an offence.

In 2017, nudists used the beach at Tauranga, which caused consternation among some residents. However, the local council said there were no bylaws dealing with the issue, and that nudity was not an offence.

===South America===
====Argentina====
Female toplessness is allowed in the official nude beaches of Puerto Escondido, located near Miramar, and Playa Querandí, located in Villa Gesell, as well as in some private naturist resorts.

On 7 February 2017, hundreds of topless women protested in Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Mar del Plata and Rosario, among other cities throughout the country. The protest was called in Spanish &quot;tetazo&quot; (a portmanteau of the Spanish word &quot;tetas&quot;, meaning &quot;tits&quot;, and the Spanish suffix &quot;-azo&quot;, which denotes a hitting action). The protestors objected against the &quot;objectification&quot; of the female body, and also disapproved the decision made by 20 police officers, who days before, had expelled from a beach located in Necochea 3 women who were topless sunbathing there.

====Brazil====
The Article 233 of the Chapter VI of the Title VI of the Penal Code asserts that indecent exposure (known in Portuguese as &quot;ato obsceno&quot;, meaning &quot;obscene act&quot;) is a wrongdoing act punished with imprisonment or fine, but does not specify what are the nude parts of the human body which could be fitted on this misdemeanor. Despite this vagueness, female toplessness tends to be considered an &quot;obscene act&quot; by the Brazilian authorities, and the practice has been frequently repressed, including some arrests made by the police throughout the years.

Generally, the practice of topless sunbathing by women has been accepted only in official nude beaches and in some private naturist clubs. However, for many years, there has been one notable exception: the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. During the famous two-night parades yearly held by 12 samba schools (6 on each day) at the Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí, the official policy is that only the genital area cannot be publicly shown (in this case all nude men and women must wear a merkin, which is known in Portuguese as &quot;tapa-sexo&quot;, roughly translated as &quot;sex cover&quot;). Thus, both men and women can openly expose their bare breasts and buttocks to the public during the marches without any problem.

Since the early 2010s, there are reports of some small and sporadic protests, especially in some beaches located in Rio de Janeiro. These protests are called in Portuguese &quot;toplessaços&quot; (a portmanteau of the English word &quot;toplessness&quot; and the Portuguese suffix &quot;-aço&quot;, translated from the Spanish &quot;-azo&quot;, which denotes a hitting action). In each protest, a group of women, soon after being reunited, decide to quickly take off all clothes they were wearing above the waist (including bras, bikinis or any other tops), culminating in a state of public &quot;breast-flashing&quot; for a few minutes before putting on their clothes again. This way, these are considered a kind of topless flash mob protests. The purpose of these protests is to claim for the official legalization of female toplessness in Brazil under the principle of gender equality.

====Chile====
Exposing the breasts in public is not a crime, although it is an offense applicable according to the Article 373 of the Penal Code to those who &quot;in any way offend modesty or good customs&quot;. Similarly, the Article 495 says: &quot;Shall be punished with a fine of one monthly tax unit (first paragraph) whoever contravenes the rules that the authority dictates to preserve public order or prevent it from being altered, unless the act constitutes a crime or simple offense&quot;.

Faced with so much inconvenience, a group of women together with the photographer and pioneer of naturism in Chile, René Rojas, managed to create the first nude beach in the country in 2000, called Playa Luna, as well as the unofficial restricted areas that were created in Playa Luna Norte (Tarapacá), Playa Luna Sur (Coliumo), Playa Escondida (Antofagasta), Playa Blanca (Tongoy) and Pichilemu, where it is possible to completely undress with total normality.

====Uruguay====
The practice of female toplessness is allowed in the official nude beaches of Chihuahua, located in the resort of the same name, and La Sirena, located in the resort of Aguas Dulces.

=== As a form of liberation ===
While an exposed breast in public can have many associated connotations, some women in America today argue the exposed breast is a symbol of liberation. They speak against the proposed notion that their rightful place was below their male counterparts. Throughout the late 20th century, more and more women began to link the struggle for female equality and the repossession of the female body. This can be especially seen in the work of Second Wave Feminists beginning in the early 1960s.

The reaction to exposed breasts as a symbol of liberation was two-sided. Women who took part in the movement expressed their desire to turn attention away from the excessive eroticization of the female body in American popular culture to more essential societal needs. Opposition to the braless movement ironically viewed it as an attack to American morals and public decency. The bralessness movement evolved into a bare-breasted movement, which became another way for women to &quot;thumb one&#x27;s nose at society&quot;. While some women exposed their breasts individually, there was also an upsurge in topless demonstrations used to draw public attention to women&#x27;s issues such as pornography and sexism. The sexualization of the breast is found only in a few Western nations, and this, many women argue, causes women to turn to plastic surgery and view their breasts as determinants of beauty rather than potentially nourishing life forces. Because of this, women are able to liberate their breasts as a way to gain attention, make political statements, and combat breast exposure laws&#x27; reinforcement of the supposed uncontrollable seductive nature of women&#x27;s breasts.

=== As a form of protest ===

In Western countries, toplessness in public often generates media coverage, leading some female political demonstrators to deliberately expose their breasts in public to draw media and public attention to their cause. For example, in January 2012, three members of the Ukrainian protest group FEMEN attracted worldwide media attention after they staged a topless protest at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

== In religion ==
In European pre-historic societies, sculptures of female figures with pronounced or highly exaggerated breasts were common. A typical example is the so-called Venus of Willendorf, one of many Venus figurines from the Paleolithic era with ample hips and bosom. Artifacts such as bowls, rock carvings and sacred statues with breasts have been recorded from 15,000 BC up to late antiquity all across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Many female deities representing love and fertility were associated with breasts and breast milk. Figures of the Phoenician goddess Astarte were represented as pillars studded with breasts. Isis, an Egyptian goddess who represented, among many other things, ideal motherhood, was often portrayed as suckling pharaohs, thereby confirming their divine status as rulers. Even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breast-like appendices, such as the river god Hapy who was considered to be responsible for the annual overflowing of the Nile. Female breasts were also prominent in the Minoan civilization in the form of the famous Snake Goddess statuettes.

In Ancient Greece there were several cults worshiping the &quot;Kourotrophos&quot;, the suckling mother, represented by goddesses such as Gaia, Hera and Artemis. The worship of deities symbolized by the female breast in Greece became less common during the first millennium. The popular adoration of female goddesses decreased significantly during the rise of the Greek city states, a legacy which was passed on to the later Roman Empire.

During the middle of the first millennium BC, Greek culture experienced a gradual change in the perception of female breasts. Women in art were covered in clothing from the neck down, including female goddesses like Athena, the patron of Athens who represented heroic endeavor. There were exceptions: Aphrodite, the goddess of love, was more frequently portrayed fully nude, though in postures that were intended to portray shyness or modesty, a portrayal that has been compared to modern pin-ups by historian Marilyn Yalom. Although nude men were depicted standing upright, most depictions of female nudity in Greek art occurred &quot;usually with drapery near at hand and with a forward-bending, self-protecting posture&quot;. A popular legend at the time was of the Amazons, a tribe of fierce female warriors who socialized with men only for procreation and even removed one breast to become better warriors. The legend was a popular motif in art during Greek and Roman antiquity and served as an antithetical cautionary tale.

== In popular culture ==
The French have traditionally been relaxed with nudity and toplessness in entertainment, and dancers and actresses performed topless during the 1910s and beyond in musical theater and cinema. Toplessness in entertainment has survived to this day at the Folies Bergère and the Moulin Rouge. Some female groups have also performed topless, such as the two female groups called The Ladybirds (one and another ), which performed topless in the late 1960s.

Women are also at times employed in adult-only venues to perform or pose topless in forms of commercial erotic entertainment. Such venues can range from downmarket strip clubs and topless bars to upmarket cabarets, such as the Moulin Rouge. Topless entertainment may also include competitions such as wet T-shirt contests, especially during spring break in the United States, in which women display their breasts through translucent wet fabric—and may end up removing their T-shirts in front of the audience.

Female toplessness has also become somewhat common during Mardi Gras in New Orleans during which women &quot;flash&quot; (briefly expose) their breasts in return for strings of plastic beads, and at Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro, where floats occasionally feature topless women.

Pasties are sometimes worn by erotic dancers or burlesque entertainers to give the impression of toplessness while avoiding prosecution under local public indecency laws which prohibit exposure of the nipple and areolas. To stay within the law, liquid latex pasties may be used. Pasties may be worn by neo-burlesque performers and are also found in night clubs, fetish parties and parades, such as Pride Parades.

=== Swimsuits ===
Toplessness in a public place is most commonly practised or encountered near water, either as part of a swimming activity or sunbathing. The introduction of the bikini in 1946 and increasingly common glamour shots of popular actresses and models on either side of the Atlantic wearing the minimal swimsuit design played a large part in bringing the bikini and sunbathing into the mainstream.

In 1964, fashion designer Rudi Gernreich went further and designed and produced a topless swimsuit, which he called the &quot;monokini&quot; in the United States. Gernreich&#x27;s monokini consisted primarily of a brief, close-fitting bottom that &quot;extended from the midriff to the upper thigh&quot; and was &quot;held up by shoestring laces that make a halter around the neck&quot;. It first appeared in print in &quot;Look&quot; magazine, introducing the concept of a topless swimsuit into commercial fashion. He later said he did not really mean for the swimsuit to be popular as it was, but rather as a fantastical concept and prediction of the future. &quot;[Women] drop their bikini tops already&quot;, he said, &quot;so it seemed like the natural next step.&quot; A photograph of Peggy Moffitt, the famous model for the suit, appeared in &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;, &quot;Life&quot; and numerous other publications.

Despite the negative reaction of fashion critics and church officials, shoppers purchased about 3000 of his swimsuit design at $24 each that summer, though the only woman reported as having worn it to a beach in the United States was arrested. The novelty of the design caught significant attention. &quot;Life&quot; writer Shana Alexander noted in an article about the introduction of the monokini in July 1964, &quot;One funny thing about toplessness is that it really doesn&#x27;t have much to do with breasts. Breasts of course are not absurd; topless swimsuits are. Lately people keep getting the two things mixed up.&quot;

The topless swimsuit failed to catch on in the United States. The Soviet government called it &quot;barbarism&quot; and a sign of social &quot;decay&quot;. The New York City Police Department was strictly instructed to arrest any woman wearing a swimsuit by the commissioner of parks. In Chicago, a 19-year-old female beachgoer was fined US$100 for wearing a topless swimsuit on a public beach. Copious coverage of the event helped to send the image of exposed breasts across the world. Women&#x27;s clubs and the church were particularly active in their condemnation. In Italy and Spain, the Catholic Church warned against the topless fashion. In France in 1964, Roger Frey led the prosecution of the use of the monokini, describing it as &quot;a public offense against the sense of decency, punishable according to article 330 of the penal code. Consequently, the police chiefs must employ the services of the police so that the women who wear this bathing suit in public places are prosecuted.&quot; At St. Tropez on the French Riviera, where toplessness later became the norm, the mayor ordered police to ban toplessness and to watch over the beach via helicopter. Jean-Luc Godard, a founding mover of French New Wave cinema, incorporated a shot of a woman in a topless swimsuit on the Riviera into his film &quot;A Married Woman&quot;, but it was edited out by the censors.

=== Media and photography ===
In many Western cultures today, images of topless women are regularly featured in magazines, calendars, and other print media, often covering their breasts in a &quot;handbra&quot;, that is, the use of the woman&#x27;s hands or arms to cover their breasts, especially the nipples and areolas. In the United Kingdom, following a tradition established by the British newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1970, several mainstream tabloid newspapers featured topless female models on their third page, known as &quot;Page 3&quot; girls, although this is no longer the case. The subject of glamour photography is often a topless woman.

Photographers such as Jock Sturges and Bill Henson have been prosecuted or been embroiled in controversy for producing images of topless teen girls as part of their ongoing work.

=== Cinema ===
In the 1920s, nudity, including toplessness, was featured in some Hollywood silent films as well as on the stage, though not without objections from various groups, and several jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere set up film censorship boards to censor films. In the 1930s, the Hays Code brought an end in Hollywood films to nudity in all its forms. To remain within the censors&#x27; guidelines or community standards of decency and modesty, breasts of actresses in an otherwise topless scene would be covered, especially the nipples and areolas, with their hands (using a &quot;handbra&quot; stance), arms, towel, pasties, some other object, or the angle of the body in relation to the camera.

Film making in other centres were not subject to the Hays Code, but were subject to various national censorship regimes. The Italian film &quot;Era lui... sì! sì!&quot; (1951), for example, also had a French version which included topless actresses in the harem scene. This version was especially made for the French market, where censorship was less rigorous than in Italy. Social and official attitudes to toplessness and nudity had eased by the 1960s and the Hays Code came under repeated challenge. For example, in &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962) all Tahitian girls were topless and there was a long native dance scene, though the topless female dancers&#x27; breasts were covered by leis. The historical epic film &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966) also featured scenes of topless native girls, their breasts being strategically covered by leis.

In 1968 the Hays Code was replaced by the MPAA film rating system. Women now appear topless in mainstream cinema, although usually somewhat briefly. Film critic Roger Ebert argued that there was a double standard in relation to the toplessness of &quot;native&quot; women. He wrote that the producers of &quot;Rapa-Nui&quot; (1994), which featured repeated scenes of bare-breasted native women, got away with ongoing toplessness because of the women&#x27;s brown skin:

Besides those actresses who have appeared nude or partially nude in films, it has also become increasingly common for actresses to appear topless in movies. Notable actresses who have appeared topless include Jane Fonda (&quot;Coming Home&quot;, 1978), Julie Andrews (&quot;S.O.B.&quot;, 1981), Kate Winslet (&quot;Titanic&quot;, 1997), Gwyneth Paltrow (&quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, 1998), Reese Witherspoon (&quot;Twilight&quot;, 1998), Rene Russo (&quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, 1999), Katie Holmes (&quot;The Gift&quot;, 2000), and Halle Berry (&quot;Swordfish&quot;, 2001). In an interview in March 2007, Halle Berry said that her toplessness in &quot;Swordfish&quot; was &quot;gratuitous&quot; to the movie, but that she needed to do the scene to get over her fear of nudity, and that it was the best thing she did for her career. Having overcome her inhibitions, she went on to a role in &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot;, which included a nude scene and which won her an Oscar for Best Actress. Some actresses prefer not to expose their breasts and use a body double.

Pasties were and may still be worn by some actresses while filming an otherwise apparently topless or nude scene, which is not caught by the camera angle.

=== Topless dancing ===
On 12 June 1964, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; featured a woman wearing a monokini with her exposed breasts on its first page. Two weeks later on 22 June 1964, Carol Doda started dancing topless wearing a monokini (designed by Rudi Gernreich) at the Condor Club in San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach district. Her debut as a topless dancer was featured in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in April 1965. Doda was the first modern topless dancer in the United States, renewing the burlesque era of the early 20th century in the U.S. San Francisco Mayor John Shelley said, &quot;topless is at the bottom of porn&quot;. Within a few days, women were baring their breasts in many of the clubs lining San Francisco&#x27;s Broadway St., ushering in the era of the topless bar.

San Francisco public officials tolerated the topless bars until 22 April 1965, when the San Francisco Police Department arrested Doda on indecency charges. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the police department, calling for release of both Doda and free speech activist Mario Savio, held in the same station. Doda rapidly became a symbol of sexual freedom, while topless restaurants, shoeshine parlors, ice-cream stands and girl bands proliferated in San Francisco and elsewhere. Journalist Earl Wilson wrote in his syndicated column, &quot;Are we ready for girls in topless gowns? Heck, we may not even notice them.&quot; English designers created topless evening gowns inspired by the idea. The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; published a real estate advertisement that promised &quot;bare top swimsuits are possible here&quot;.

=== The arts ===
The artifacts in the Ancient Siam open-air museum near Bangkok depict Thai women topless. The Ramakien Mural representing the epic lives of the Thai people found at the Wat Phra Kaew Temple depict women wearing only a skirt in public.

As a result of the Renaissance, in many European societies artists were strongly influenced by classical Greek styles and culture. As a result, images of nude and semi-nude subjects in many forms proliferated in art and sculpture.

During the Victorian era, French Orientalist painters such as Jean-Léon Gérôme presented an idealized depiction of female toplessness in Muslim harem baths, while Eugène Delacroix, a French romantic artist, invoked images of Liberty as a topless woman.

<text>Golden Bisquits is the sixth album (fifth studio album) by American rock band Three Dog Night, released in 1971.

The album is a compilation of hits from Three Dog Night&#x27;s first four studio albums, including all nine single A-sides issued by the band to date. The album was released concurrently with the band&#x27;s tenth single (not included on &quot;Golden Bisquits&quot;), &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, from their previous album &quot;Naturally&quot; (1970). &quot;Joy to the World&quot; reached #1 in early 1971, becoming one of Three Dog Night&#x27;s most enduring songs. The three songs included in &quot;Golden Bisquits&quot; that were not issued as single A-sides are &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Promises&quot;, &quot;Woman&quot;, and &quot;Your Song&quot;.

According to Chuck Negron&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Three Dog Nightmare&quot;, the band originally suggested the title &quot;Dog Style&quot; for the album. ABC/Dunhill Records rejected this as too risqué, but liked the idea of a &quot;dog&quot;-themed title for the album, and proposed the title &quot;Golden Bisquits&quot; instead.

Some editions of the album utilized alternative cover art, featuring a cropped version of the rejected cover photo for Three Dog Night&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;.

<doc id="1243211" wikidata="Q1796232" url="?curid=1243211" title="Kingdom of Ndongo">
<text>The Kingdom of Ndongo (formerly known as Angola or Dongo, also Kimbundu: Utuminu ua Ndongo, Utuminu ua Ngola) was an early-modern African state located in the highlands between the Lukala and Kwanza Rivers, in what is now Angola.

The Kingdom of Ndongo is first recorded in the sixteenth century. It was one of multiple vassal states to Kongo, though Ndongo was the most powerful of these with a king called the &quot;Ngola&quot;.

Little is known of the kingdom in the early sixteenth century. &quot;Angola&quot; was listed among the titles of the King of Kongo in 1535, so it was likely somewhat subordinate to Kongo. Its oral traditions, collected in the late sixteenth century, particularly by the Jesuit Baltasar Barreira, described the founder of the kingdom, Ngola Kiluanje, also known as Ngola Inene, as a migrant from Kongo, chief of a Kimbundu-speaking ethnic group.

==Political structure==
The Kimbundu-speaking region was known as the land of Mbundu people. It was ruled by a &quot;Ngola&quot;, or king, who lived with his extended family in the capitol, or &quot;kabasa&quot;. The kingdom was divided into political territories that were independently ruled by &quot;sobas&quot;, or nobles. These sobas governed territories (called &quot;murinda&quot;) and paid tribute to the Ngola, as well as fighting for the kingdom during a war. Ndongo&#x27;s internal wars sometimes resulted in alliances forming between sobas, which combined murindas and created large provinces, or &quot;kandas&quot;.

The Ngola of Ndongo and his sobas relied on other officials to carry out his orders. The most important position was that of &quot;tendala&quot;, a chief advisor with the authority to rule in the Ngola&#x27;s absence. He also managed much of his day-to-day duties. A tendala was usually a former captive chosen from the class of enslaved serfs called &quot;kijikos&quot;. Below the tendala was the military commander, called &quot;ngolambole&quot;, who was also a former member of the kijikos class. 

The Ngola also had a large group of bureaucrats, called the &quot;makotas,&quot; or &quot;the gentlemen of the land,&quot; who helped manage the capitol and advise the Ngola on important decisions for the kingdom. They included the &quot;mwene lumbo&quot;, who managed the palace, the &quot;mwene kudya&quot;, who managed ted food and monetary taxes, the &quot;mwene miste&quot;, who managed religious affairs, and the &quot;mwene ndongo&quot;, who was the great priest. The king also took advice from a &quot;nganga marinda&quot;, a spiritual leader believed to have a supernatural connection to the ancestors.

These political units were often grouped into larger units called &quot;kanda&quot; and sometimes provinces. &quot;O-mbala&quot; is the name of the court, and &quot;se-kulu&quot;, chieftain means &quot;old father&quot; in the Mbundu language, is the chieftain&#x27;s name. &quot;Di-kanda&quot; is the name for a count, &quot;mvunda&quot; is a duke, and &quot;mbanza&quot; means a baron.

Larger kingdoms may have emerged earlier, but in the sixteenth century, most of these regions had been united by the rulers of Ndongo. Ndongo&#x27;s capital city was called &quot;Kabasa&quot; (Caculo Cabaça), located on the highlands near modern-day N&#x27;dalatando. This was a large town, holding as many as 50,000 people in its densely populated district.

== Social structure ==
The Kingdom of Ndongo was composed mostly of free commoners, who were called &quot;ana murinda,&quot; or &quot;children of the murinda&quot;. In addition to the commoners, there were two enslaved groups. The &quot;ijiko&quot; or &quot;kijikos&quot; (sing., &quot;kijiko&quot;) were enslaved commoners who were originally captured during a war, permanently attached to specific territories as serfs, and could not be sold. The &quot;abika&quot; or &quot;mubikas&quot; (sing., &quot;mubika&quot;) were war captives who were judicially enslaved and could be bought, sold, or inherited.

Due to the close pretexts of kijiko and mubika enslavement, Ndongo had stringent rules on slavery or the export of enslaved people. To ensure that no ana murinda or kijiko was unjustly taken and sold, the kingdom even went so far as to interview every enslaved person who was marked for export. The legitimacy of their enslavement had to be proven before they were sold outside of the Ndongo.

==History==

===Rise of Ndongo===
The Mbundu people founded the Kingdom of Ndongo under a king of the Ngola dynasty, using their artisan, blacksmithing, and agricultural skills to become influential traders in the region. They established massive farming communities, created unity through the veneration of &quot;zumbi&quot; (ancestors) and &quot;ilundu&quot; (deities), and organized military strategies to fortify their borders and protect their people.

====Seeds of independence====
In 1518, Ngola Kiluanji of the Kingdom of Ndongo sent ambassadors to Portugal, requesting that Catholic priests visit his kingdom to learn more about the European invaders. A Portuguese mission arrived in Ndongo in 1520, but local disputes and perhaps Kongo pressure forced the missionaries to withdraw. Afonso I of Kongo took the missionaries to Kongo and left his priest in Ndongo.

====War of 1556====
Around 1556, Ndongo sent another mission to Portugal seeking military assistance and offering to be baptized, even though Portuguese officials were unsure of the religious sincerity at the time. In 1901, historian E.G. Ravenstein claimed that this mission was the result of a war between Kongo and Ndongo, in which Ndongo won and declared its independence, which was also claimed by historian Jan Vansina in 1966 and then others, but this appears to have been a misreading of the sources. Ndongo may have seen the mission as a declaration of independence since Kongo&#x27;s response to the 1518 mission suggests that it still maintained sufficient control to prevent it from being an independent move.

The second Portuguese mission arrived at the mouth of the Cuanza River in 1560, headed by Paulo Dias de Novais, grandson of the famous explorer Bartolomeu Dias, and including several Jesuit priests including Francisco de Gouveia. This mission also failed, and Dias de Novais returned to Portugal in 1564, leaving Gouveia behind.

===The Portuguese colony of Angola===
By the time of the third mission in 1571, the King of Portugal Sebastian I had decided to charge Dias de Novais with the conquest and subjugation of the &quot;Kingdom of Angola&quot;, authorizing him to govern the region, bring in settlers, and build forts. Dias de Novais arrived in Luanda by arrangement with Kongo&#x27;s king Álvaro I in compensation for Portugal&#x27;s assistance against the Jaga. Quilongo, the king of Angola, renewed the connection with Portugal in 1578. Unable to conquer any territory on his own, Dias de Novais made alliances with both Kongo and Ndongo, serving as a mercenary army.

===The First Portuguese-Ndongo War===
In 1579, Portuguese merchants who had settled in Kongo, led by Francisco Barbuda, advised Njinga Ndambi Kilombo kia Kasenda that Portugal intended to take over his country. Acting on this intelligence and advice, Njinga Ndambi tricked the Portuguese forces into an ambush and massacred them at his capital.

The following war witnessed a Kongo invasion, which was narrowly defeated in 1580, and a Portuguese offensive up the Kwanza River, resulting in the founding of their fort at Massangano in 1582. Several sobas switched their allegiance to Portugal, and many of the coastal provinces soon joined the colony. By 1590, the Portuguese decided to attack the core of Ndongo and sent an army against Kabasa itself. Ndongo, however, had recently sealed an alliance with nearby Matamba, and the Portuguese force was crushed. Following this defeat, Ndongo made a counteroffensive, and many of the formerly pro-Portuguese sobas returned to Ndongo. But Portugal managed to retain much of the land they had gained in the earlier wars, and in 1599, Portugal and Ndongo formalized their border.

=== The Imbangala period ===
During the early seventeenth century, an uneasy peace was held between Portugal and Ndongo. The Portuguese continued their expansion along the Kwanza, founding the presidio of Cambambe in 1602 and attempted, whenever possible, to meddle in Ndongo&#x27;s politics, especially as it concerned Ndongo&#x27;s tenuous hold on Kisama and other lands south of the Kwanza River. During their activities in the region south of the Kwanza, the Portuguese came into contact with the Imbangala, a rootless group of nomadic raiders ravaging the country. In 1615, the temporary Angolan governor Bento Banha Cardoso encouraged some Imbangala to cross the river and enter Portuguese service, and with their help, he expanded the colony along the Lukala River, north of Ndongo.

In 1617, the new governor Luis Mendes de Vasconcelos, after first rejecting the use of Imbangala troops, committed himself to the alliance and began aggressive campaigns against Ndongo. Thanks to the help of Imbangala bands commanded by Kasanje, Kasa, and others, he invaded Ndongo, sacked the capital, and forced King Ngola Mbandi to take refuge on the island of Kindonga in the Kwanza River. Thousands of Ndongo subjects were taken prisoner, and Mendes de Vasconcelos sought unsuccessfully to create a puppet government to allow Portuguese rule.

Mendes de Vasconcelos&#x27; successor, João Correia de Sousa, tried to make peace with Ndongo. In 1621, Ngola Mbandi sent his sister, Nzinga Mbandi to Luanda to negotiate. She negotiated a peace treaty in which Portugal agreed to withdraw its advance fort of Ambaca on the Lukala, which had served as a base for the invasion of Ndongo, return a large number of captive &quot;ijiko&quot; to Ndongo, and force the Imbangala bands who were still ravaging Ndongo to leave. In exchange, Ngola Mbandi would leave the island, reestablish himself at the capital, and become a Portuguese vassal, paying 100 enslaved people per year as tribute.

However, João Correia de Sousa became involved in a disastrous war with Kongo and, in the aftermath, was expelled from the colony by angry citizens. His temporary successor, the bishop, was unable to execute the treaty, and it was then left to the new governor, Fernão de Sousa, to settle matters when he came in 1624.

===The rise of Queen Nzinga===
Portugal&#x27;s failure to honor its treaty took a toll on Ngola Mbandi. In desperation, he committed suicide, leaving the country in the hands of his sister Nzinga, who was to serve as regent for his minor son, then in the protective custody of the Imbangala leader Kaza, who had left Portuguese service and joined with Ndongo. Nzinga, however, only briefly served as regent and had the young son murdered and succeeded to the throne as ruling queen. Some European sources call her Anna Xinga.

Father Giovanni took this opportunity to reopen negotiations with Nzinga, whose legitimacy he questioned. He refused to return the Ijiko and insisted that Njinga first acknowledge Portuguese sovereignty. Although Nzinga was prepared to do this, she would not leave the island until her complete control was established and the Ijiko returned. When the Portuguese refused, Nzinga encouraged them to run away and enter her service. The dispute over the Ijiko led to war in 1626. Sousa&#x27;s army was able to oust Nzinga from Kidonga but not to capture her.

Sousa felt confident enough at this point to declare Nzinga deposed and convened some sobas who had supported her to re-elect as new king Hari a Kiluanji, lord of the rocky fortress of Mpungo a Ndongo (or Pungo Andongo) in 1626. Still, he died in the smallpox epidemic that broke out as a result of the war and was replaced by Filipe Hari a Ngola.

Nzinga refused to recognize Hari a Ngola, claiming that he was of slave origin and not eligible to reign. She reoccupied Kindonga and began mobilizing the support of all the sobas opposed to Hari an Angola and Portuguese rule, leading to a second war with Portugal. Sousa&#x27;s army defeated Nzinga again in 1628, forcing her to flee the islands. Nzinga narrowly escaped capture, at one point having to descend into the Baixa de Cassange on ropes with only a few hundred of her followers remaining.

Desperate, Nzinga joined forces with the Imbangala band of Kasanje, who forced her to accept a humiliating position as wife and give up her royal regalia. Nevertheless, she was able to win one of his supporters, subsequently known as Nzinga Mona (or Nzinga&#x27;s son), away and rebuild her army. Using this support, Nzinga moved northward and captured the Kingdom of Matamba, which became her base, even as she sent a detachment to reoccupy the Kindonga Islands, now sacred because her brother&#x27;s remains were buried there.

At this point, the history of Nzinga becomes that of Matamba, and her career can be followed in that country.

===Ndongo under Filipe Hari a Ndongo&#x27;s dynasty===

Filipe I served the Portuguese loyally in the following decades, even when the Portuguese made a separate peace with Nzinga in 1639. His troops were the most significant component of the army the Portuguese used to make conquests and consolidate their rule in the Dembos area to the north. When the Dutch invaded Brazil, Filipe served against them, forming the bulk of the forces that defended the rump colony at Masangano, though he suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Nzinga&#x27;s army with its Dutch allies in 1647 at the Battle of Kombi.

Following the expulsion of the Dutch, however, Filipe began to feel that the Portuguese were not giving him his full due. He became involved in disputes with them over his subordinates and jurisdiction, even as his forces marched into disastrous wars in Kisama and the Dembos. His son and successor was equally disappointed, especially following the Portuguese treaty with Ndongo, which recognized Nzinga as queen of Ndongo and Matamba in 1657, leaving him feeling dishonored as the only ruler of Pungo a Ndongo. Therefore, in 1670, he revolted, and after a long siege, his fortress fell to the Portuguese army in 1671, thus effectively ending Ndongo as an independent kingdom.

== Military ==
The Ndongo army did not rely on arms such as shields for defense. Instead, its personnel were trained to be agile to dodge arrows, javelins, and lance thrusts. On offense, the army was trained in fencing. This Central African martial arts was referred to as &quot;Sanguar&quot;. It was described by a Jesuit witness in the 1570s as;
Professional forces trained for war in the army were referred to as &quot;quimbares&quot;. Before the war against Portugal in the late 16th century, Ndongo could hire Portuguese mercenaries such as the forces of Paulo Dias de Novais in 1575. There also existed special forces referred to as the &quot;Flower of Angola&quot; from 1585 who fell solely under the auspices of the King. Prominent weapons in service of the army included swords and battle axes. Ndongo developed its musketeers starting from the 16th century. In 1585, the army deployed 40 musketeers against Portugal. Queen Nzinga fielded 3 Dutch artillery pieces around 1648 in a failed siege of a Portuguese stronghold at Muxima.

Ndongo&#x27;s army was organized into mass units called &quot;mozengos&quot; or &quot;embalos&quot;, divided into sub formations of a center and two wings. The military force could be redivided once more into units called &quot;lucanzos&quot; that were tasked with special operations. In battle, the &quot;gunzes&quot; detachment laid out the initial attacks. During campaigns, the Ndongo army could build field fortifications mostly made of wood. According to the research of historian Thornton, in the 1585 campaign against Portugal, the army &quot;constructed four or five forts &#x27;of wood and straw after their fashion&#x27; each a day&#x27;s journey apart to cover their retreat.&quot; Ndongo possessed, in addition, a naval force of rivercraft. In 1586, the navy employed 8 &quot;great canoes&quot; across the Lucala River, each possessing some personnel of 80–90 people.

== Sources ==
Ndongo&#x27;s history is primarily known through the writings of Portuguese missionaries, administrators, and travelers. Much of this work was gathered in the monumental collection of sources, in the original languages 
by António Brásio. In addition, several Italian Capuchin missionaries, especially Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi and António da Gaeta, wrote book-length descriptions of the country in the mid-seventeenth century when it split into Nzingha&#x27;s half and Hari a Kiluanji&#x27;s half. However, the Capuchin&#x27;s work included detailed recountings of oral tradition.

<text>Willard was an American metal band from Seattle, Washington, formed around 1989. They were a part of the grunge music scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

== History ==
Mark Spiders, Otis P. Otis, and Darren Peters were in a band named Sunshine alongside vocalist Faye West and drummer Patty Schemel. They self-released one EP in 1989, &quot;Spread the Love&quot;, followed by a disbandment. Schemel would later go on to join the band Hole while Spiders, Otis, and Peters formed Willard. The lineup was expanded with Johnny Clint on vocals and Steve Wied, who departed from the band Tad shortly after joining Willard, on drums. Otis was also an early member of Napalm Beach while Clint and Peters played in H-Hour.

Willard initially released a self-titled EP on Green Gel Records in 1991. Jeff Gilbert, and Tad Doyle were then instrumental in Willard&#x27;s record deal with Roadrunner Records, which resulted in the &quot;Steel Mill&quot; album in 1992, produced by Jack Endino. Gilbert called Willard the &quot;drunkest band in Seattle&quot; in his &quot;Rocket&quot; article. They toured alongside bands such as White Zombie, Cannibal Corpse, and the Melvins (another band which drew comparisons to Willard). After performing an outdoor show for the &quot;Pain in the Grass&quot; Festival at the Seattle Center, Willard was banned from further performances by the Seattle Police Department and the City of Seattle, resulting in band shirts displaying &quot;Banned by the SPD&quot;.

Willard recorded eleven songs in November 1993, followed by the departure of Peters. He was replaced on bass by Tyson Garcia. The band drastically reduced their activity, and the recorded tracks were not released. They eventually disbanded in 1995. The songs from November 1993 were eventually transferred from 2&quot; tape to digital by Stuart Hallerman at Avast!. Guitarist Spiders and Aaron Skok mixed the songs, and Black Guitar Records published the album, &quot;Underground&quot;, in 2018. Otis and Spiders currently play guitars in Smoke It And See with two members of Green Apple Quick Step, MariAnn Braeden - vocals and bass, and Geoff Reading - drums.

<doc id="1243225" wikidata="Q966431" url="?curid=1243225" title="Taghaza">
<text>Taghaza () (also Teghaza) is an abandoned salt-mining centre located in a salt pan in the desert region of northern Mali. It was an important source of rock salt for West Africa up to the end of the 16th century when it was abandoned and replaced by the salt-pan at Taoudenni which lies to the southeast. Salt from the Taghaza mines formed an important part of the long distance trans-Saharan trade. The salt pan is located south of Sijilmasa (in Morocco), north-northwest of Timbuktu (in Mali) and north-northeast of Oualata (in Mauritania).

==Early Arabic sources==

The Taghaza mines are first mentioned by name (as Taghara) in around 1275 by the geographer al Qazwini who spent most of his life in Iraq but obtained information from a traveller who had visited the Sudan. He wrote that the town was situated south of the Maghreb near the ocean and that the ramparts, walls and roofs of the buildings were made of salt which was mined by slaves of the Masufa, a Berber tribe, and exported to the Sudan by a caravan that came once a year. A similar description had been given earlier by Al-Bakri in 1068 for the salt mines at a place that he called Tantatal, situated twenty days from Sijilmasa. It is possible these were the same mines.

In 1352 the Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta arrived in Taghaza after a 25-day journey from Sijilmasa on his way across the Sahara to Oualata to visit the Mali Empire. According to Ibn Battuta, there were no trees, only sand and the salt mines. Nobody lived in the village other than the Musafa slaves who dug for the salt and lived on dates imported from Sijilmasa and the Dar&#x27;a valley, camel meat and millet imported from the Sudan. The buildings were constructed from slabs of salt and roofed with camel skins. The salt was dug from the ground and cut into thick slabs, two of which were loaded onto each camel. The salt was taken south across the desert to Oualata and sold. The value of the salt was chiefly determined by the transport costs. Ibn Battuta mentions that the value increased fourfold when transported between Oualata and the Malian capital. In spite of the meanness of the village, it was awash in Malian gold. Ibn Battuta did not enjoy his visit; he found the water brackish and the village full of flies. He goes on to say, &quot;For all its squalor, &quot;qintars&quot; of qintars of gold dust are traded in Taghaza.&quot;

The salt mines became known in Europe not long after Ibn Battuta&#x27;s visit as Taghaza was shown on the Catalan Atlas of 1375 on the trans-Saharan trade route linking Sijilmasa and Timbuktu.

Alvise Cadamosto learned in 1455 that Taghaza salt was taken to Timbuktu and then on to Mali. It was then carried &quot;a great distance&quot; to be bartered for gold.

In around 1510 Leo Africanus spent 3 days in Taghaza. In his &quot;Descrittione dell’Africa&quot; he mentions that the location of the mines, 20 days journey from a source of food, meant that there was a risk of starvation. At the time of Leo&#x27;s visit, Oualata was no longer an important terminus for the trans-Saharan trade and salt was instead taken south to Timbuktu. Like Ibn Battuta before him, Leo complained about the brackish well water.

==Sixteenth century==
At some point Taghaza came under the control of the Songhai Empire which had its capital at the city of Gao on the Niger River across the Sahara. Al-Sadi in his &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; chronicles the efforts of the Moroccan rulers of the Saadi dynasty to wrestle control of the mines from the Songhai during the 16th century. In around 1540 the Saadian Sultan Ahmad al-Araj asked the Songhai leader Askia Ishaq I to cede the Taghaza mines. The Askia responded by sending men to raid a town in the Draa valley as a warning and demonstration of Songhai power. 

In 1556-7 Sultan Muhammed al-Shaykh briefly occupied Taghaza and killed the Askia&#x27;s representative. However the Tuareg shifted the production to another mine called Taghaza al-ghizlan (Taghaza of the gazelles). On his succession in 1578 Ahmad al-Mansur asked for the tax revenues from Taghaza but Askiya Dawud responded instead with a generous gift of 47 kg of gold. In 1586 a small Saadian force of 200 musketeers again occupied Taghaza and the Tuareg moved to yet another site – probably Taoudeni. Finally, a new demand by Ahmad al-Mansur in 1589–90 was met with defiance by Askiya Ishak II. This provided the pretext for Ahmad al-Mansur to send an army of 4,000 mercenaries across the Sahara led by the Spaniard Judar Pasha. The defeat of the Songhai in 1591 at the Battle of Tondibi led to the collapse of their empire. After the conquest Taghaza was abandoned and Taoudenni, situated to the southeast and thus nearer to Timbuktu, took its place as the region&#x27;s key salt producer.

In 1828 the French explorer René Caillié stopped at Taghaza on his journey across the Sahara from Timbuktu. He was travelling with a large caravan that included 1,400 camels transporting slaves, gold, ivory, gum and ostrich feathers. At that date the ruins of houses constructed of salt bricks were still clearly visible.

==Ruins==
At Taghaza there are ruins of two different settlements, one on either side of the ancient salt lake (or sabkha). They are separated by a distance of 3 km. The larger more westerly settlement extended over an area of approximately 400 m by 200 m. All the houses, except the mosque, were aligned in a northwest to southeast direction, perpendicular to the prevailing wind. The houses in the more easterly settlement were aligned in the same manner and occupied an area of 200 m by 180 m. The reason for the dual settlements is not known but could be connected with Taghaza&#x27;s service both as a salt mine and as a stopping point on an important trans-Saharan trade route.
==Climate==
Taghaza has a hyper-arid hot desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;). It is one of the driest places on earth and one of the hottest during summer, only being behind Chenachène. The average high temperature in July is , which is 0.8°C higher than Furnace Creek, Death Valley, California, 0.3°C higher than Taoudenni and only 0.1°C cooler than Chenachène.

<text>Juntos Podemos Más por Chile (Spanish literal: &quot;Together we can do more for Chile&quot;, &quot;Podemos&quot; is an acronym of &quot;Po&quot;der &quot;Demo&quot;crático &quot;S&quot;ocial, Spanish for &quot;Social Democratic Power&quot;) was a political coalition created in 2003, consisting of the Communist Party of Chile, the Humanist Party, the Christian Left Party of Chile, and several other smaller left-wing organizations.

The Coalition presented at first five candidates (including the sociologist Tomás Moulián for the Communist Party) for the 2005 presidential election, but then finally agreed on the Humanist Party candidate, Tomás Hirsch. He obtained 5.4% of the vote (375,048 votes). The Coalition divided itself during the runoff vote, some conditionally voting for left-of-center candidate Michelle Bachelet and others proposing blank votes.

In the 2005 parliamentary election, the pact obtained 7.38% of the vote in the lower chamber election, and 5.98% in the Senate election, but did not win seats in either chamber. Members of the coalition blame this upon the binomial system, which privileges the two largest coalitions: &quot;Concertación&quot; and the Alliance for Chile.

For the 2009 parliamentary election, the coalition joined the Concertación list and won three seats in the lower chamber, all from the Communist Party. At the concurrent presidential election, Juntos Podemos supported the candidacy of former Socialist Party member Jorge Arrate as President, who won 6.2% of the vote. The Humanist Party left the coalition and supported independent candidate Marco Enríquez-Ominami.

== Composition ==

The coalition was made up of more than 50 parties and organisations, including the Communist Party (PCCh), the Humanist Party (PH) (until 2009), &quot;Izquierda Cristiana&quot; (Christian Left),Chilean Communist Party (Proletarian Action)(PCAP) ,MIR, the MPMR (&quot;Movimiento Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez&quot;), the &quot;Bloque por el Socialismo&quot; (BS) — which itself gathers three parties: &quot;Izquierda Socialista&quot; (Socialist Left), the Movimiento Por el Socialismo (MPS) and the &quot;Partido Alternativa Socialista&quot; (PAS) — &quot;Identidad Rodriguista&quot; (IR), &quot;Movimiento Fuerza Ciudadana&quot; (FC), &quot;Cambio Democrático&quot;, &quot;Partido Radical de Chile&quot; (PRCh), &quot;Revolución Democratizadora&quot; (RD), &quot;Generación 80&quot; (G-80), &quot;Partido de los Trabajadores&quot; (PT) and the &quot;Juventudes Comunistas de Chile&quot;.

<text>Reginald Wayne (born November 17, 1978) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played 14 seasons with the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, and was selected by the Colts in the first round of the 2001 NFL draft with the 30th overall pick. A six-time Pro Bowl selection, Wayne was a member of the Colts&#x27; Super Bowl XLI winning team over the Chicago Bears. He ranks second in Colts&#x27; franchise history to Marvin Harrison in major receiving categories: receptions, receiving yards, targets, and receiving touchdowns. On December 14, 2014, Wayne played in both his 209th game and his 142nd win as a member of the Colts, breaking the franchise records set by Peyton Manning.

==Early life==
Wayne is the youngest of three sons. His father, Ralph, is a former linebacker for Grambling State. A New Orleans Saints fan in his youth, he was more interested in baseball growing up but chose football by the time he attended John Ehret High School.

==College career==
Wayne attended the University of Miami, where he was a four-year starter for the Hurricanes. He set a school record of 173 career catches (including 36 consecutive games with a reception). He is one of only five wide receivers in school history to post 20 or more touchdowns in his career, along with Michael Irvin, Lamar Thomas, Leonard Hankerson, and Andre Johnson. Wayne&#x27;s 48 receptions during the 1997 season set a school record for freshmen, which still stands today. Wayne also ran track and field at the University of Miami, where he recorded a personal best of 21.87 seconds in the 200 meters. Wayne graduated with a degree in liberal arts; his roommate was future Baltimore Ravens safety Ed Reed. Wayne was also teammates with future Indianapolis Colts teammate Edgerrin James while at &#x27;The U&#x27;.

===College statistics===
Wayne was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame at their 43rd Annual Induction Banquet held on March 24, 2011.

He led the league in receiving yards and was selected to go to the Pro Bowl for the second consecutive year.

In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, Wayne had a receiving touchdown in the 28–24 loss to the San Diego Chargers.

====2008====
Wayne opened the 2008 season with a receiving touchdown four of the Colts&#x27; first five games. In that stretch was an eight-catch, 118-yard, one-touchdown game against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 6, a 31–3 victory. In the 2008 season, Wayne posted a Pro Bowl season for the third consecutive year with 82 catches for 1,145 yards and six touchdowns. He had a 65-yard score on the opening drive of Week 10 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

In Week 15, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had five receptions for 132 yards and a touchdown in the 35–31 victory.

In Super Bowl XLIV, Wayne had five catches for 46 yards, but the Colts lost 31-17 to the New Orleans Saints.

====2010====

In 2010, Wayne was second in the NFL receptions with 111 (a career-high), and third in receiving yards with 1,355. During a season where the Colts heavily relied on Peyton Manning to win games, Wayne again cemented himself as one of the top receivers in the NFL. This included a franchise-record 15 receptions which he converted into 196 yards against Jacksonville in Week 4, and 14 receptions for 200 yards in Week 13 against Dallas. Wayne was selected to his fifth Pro Bowl and earned first team All-Pro honors for the first time. He was ranked 31st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

====2011====
Wayne&#x27;s numbers were lower than usual in 2011 without Peyton Manning starting at quarterback, though he still led team in receptions (75) and receiving yards (960). He had four touchdown receptions as well. He had three games going over the 100-yard mark on the year, including a season-high 122 against the Carolina Panthers in Week 12.

====2012====
On March 13, 2012, the Colts re-signed Wayne to a three-year contract. Wayne started off the season with nine receptions for 135 yards against the Chicago Bears. Before the Colts&#x27; Week 5 matchup with the Green Bay Packers, the news of head coach Chuck Pagano&#x27;s leukemia surfaced. Wayne&#x27;s history with Pagano goes back to his college years, where Pagano was the Hurricanes&#x27; defensive backs coach, and Pagano&#x27;s hiring as the Colts&#x27; head coach was a large factor in Wayne&#x27;s decision to re-sign with Indianapolis. In response, Wayne caught 13 passes for a career-high 212 receiving yards and a game-winning touchdown from rookie quarterback Andrew Luck; Wayne earned the AFC Offensive Player of the Week award due to his performance, the first of his career. In Week 12 against Buffalo Bills, Wayne broke Cris Carter&#x27;s record of consecutive games with three or more receptions with 59 games. He also passed former Washington Redskins receiver Art Monk for 12th on the NFL&#x27;s all-time receptions list during the first half. In the 2012 season, Wayne had 106 receptions for 1,355 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns. He was named to his sixth Pro Bowl.

During the Wild Card Round against the Baltimore Ravens, Wayne had 114 yards on nine receptions and moved into second in career playoff catches with 92–59 behind leader Jerry Rice. However, the Colts lost the game, 24–9. He was ranked 21st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.

Wayne was selected as the wide receiver for USA Football&#x27;s 2012 All-Fundamentals Team, which honors 26 NFL players each year for executing the fundamentals of their position.

====2013====
In the 2013 season, Wayne recorded five receptions for 100 yards and a touchdown against Jacksonville in Week 4, a 37–3 victory. In a Week 6 loss to San Diego, Wayne became the ninth player to reach 1,000 career receptions. However, a week later, Wayne tore his ACL during a 39–33 victory over Denver, in Peyton Manning&#x27;s first bout against the Colts since leaving Indianapolis in 2012; it was announced the next day that he would miss the remainder of the 2013 season. The injury also ended his consecutive games played streak at 189, the third-longest for a wide receiver in NFL history.

====2014====
With the retirement of Tony Gonzalez, 36-year-old Wayne entered 2014 as the active leader in career receiving yards. He gained 98 more on nine receptions in a 31–24 season-opening loss to the Denver Broncos, and 119 on seven receptions in Week 4 against the Tennessee Titans. In Week 8, Wayne became the ninth receiver in NFL history to record 14,000 receiving yards. He suffered an elbow injury in the game and missed the following week&#x27;s matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Near the conclusion of the Colts&#x27; 2014 season, it was announced that Wayne had played with a torn triceps since Week 6, which would require an offseason surgery to repair. He finished the 2014 season with 64 receptions for 779 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns.

He had just one reception in the Colts&#x27; three post-season games, concluding his career with franchise records for postseason receptions (93); receiving yards (1,254), receiving touchdowns (9), and games with 100+ yards receiving (3, shared with Dallas Clark and T. Y. Hilton).

On March 6, 2015, the Colts announced that they would not re-sign Wayne, which made him a free agent on March 10.

====Retirement====

On August 24, 2015, Wayne signed a one-year contract with the New England Patriots worth up to $3 million. On September 5, 2015, Wayne requested and was granted his release from the Patriots.

On January 15, 2016, after not playing the entire 2015 season, Wayne announced his retirement from professional football, saying, &quot;It was fun, but it&#x27;s time. It&#x27;s just time. Whenever you can admit that you&#x27;re done, you know you&#x27;re done.&quot; At the time of his retirement, he finished his NFL career 7th all-time in career receptions, 8th all-time in receiving yards, and 17th in career touchdown receptions.

On January 2, 2020, Wayne was named one of 15 modern-era finalists for election into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. He and Pittsburgh Steelers safety Troy Polamalu are the only two finalists for 2020 to be nominated in their first year of eligibility. As of 2021, Wayne has been nominated four times for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but has not yet been selected.

For the 2021 NFL draft, Wayne joined Bleacher Report as a positional expert. He applauded the Giants first round pick of Kadarius Toney. Wayne went on to compare him to Percy Harvin and called him the toughest wide receiver in the draft.

<text>Atom Ant is a cartoon ant and superhero, created by Hanna-Barbera in 1965. Atom costarred in &quot;The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show&quot; (sharing top billing with Secret Squirrel) on Saturday mornings. In syndication, Atom Ant aired alongside &quot;The Hillbilly Bears&quot; and &quot;Precious Pupp&quot;. Reruns aired on cable on Cartoon Network and Boomerang in the 1990s and 2000s.

==Biography==
Atom Ant (originally voiced by Howard Morris, then by Don Messick in later episodes) is a superhero ant who operates out of an anthill in the countryside, where he possesses such things as a mainframe computer and exercise equipment. His powers mostly consist of the ability to fly, superspeed, incredible strength, and invulnerability. His catchphrase is &quot;Up and at &#x27;em, Atom Ant!&quot; He was often contacted by the police, who sent him out on an assignment.

Some of these missions parody the missions of Batman. The police force is constantly shown to be underfunded and inept, as they rely on Atom Ant to do all their police work. As seen in &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool,&quot; the only two police officers are the chief of police and the deputy chief. The department has only one rusted patrol car. Atom Ant fights various villains, including recurring ones like Ferocious Flea (also voiced by Messick) and mad scientist Professor Von Gimmick (voiced by Allan Melvin).

<text>The Didessa (pronounced: ɗeɗ:e:s:a; ) is a river in western Ethiopia. A tributary of the Abay River, it rises in the mountains of Gomma, flowing in a northwesterly direction to its confluence where the course of the Abay has curved to its southernmost point before turning northwards. The Didessa&#x27;s drainage area is about , covering portions of the Benishangul-Gumuz Region and the West Welega Zone of the Oromia Region.

Tributaries on the right bank include the Enareya, Aet, Wama, and the Angar rivers; on the left side the most important tributary is the Dobana River. Exploring this river in the mid-1890s and from interviews with local inhabitants, Alexander Bulatovich asserted that downstream of its junction with the Angar, the Didessa is rapid-free and potentially navigable.

==Human history==
The early 20th-century explorer Herbert Weld Blundell opined that &quot;Didessa&quot; appears to have replaced a much older name for this river, finding no earlier usage for it &quot;before 1861, when d&#x27;Abbadie was travelling in Western Shoa and made inquiries.&quot; At the time of his visit, in 1905, the Handak forest on the right side of the Didessa was &quot;famous as a favourite haunt for elephants. They seem to come up towards the Nile by both the Didesa and Dabus rivers, attracted, no doubt, in the latter river-bed by the rich growth of young bamboo.&quot; He also notes that at the confluence of the Didessa and the Abay, &quot;the serious work of goldwashing begins, and continues along the Nile and down the course of the Dabus and its tributaries,&quot; adding that:
The deep erosion of the upper strata of basalt and trap, and subsequent decomposition, lays bare the gneissic and hornblendic schist formations below, so that nearly the whole country from the foot of Chochi to the river, a distance of 15 miles, is covered with quartz pebbles and boulders, and shows numerous outcrops. The decomposed portions of the reefs are strewn over the ground, and the gold they contain is thus washed into the small streams, and then carried into the Abai.

Despite the efforts of these explorers, and the presence of humans in the area since roughly the origins of the species, the course of the Didessa from its point near Nekemte to its confluence with the Abay apparently was only traced in 1935 by Dunlop and Taylor. They were told by &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Habte Maryam, the local official in Nekemte, &quot;that nobody, even the local Shankallas, as far as he knew, had ever followed the course of the river to its junction with the Abbai.&quot; 
Admittedly, at certain times of the year [the &quot;Dejazmach&quot; continued], a few Shankallas worked in some cotton fields, which he had just planted 15 miles north of the Dadessa bridge; but even these few miles were, to use his own words, &quot;a country fit only for monkeys.&quot; He emphasized the difficulties which we would encounter: no paths, thick bamboo forests, fever, and, with an expressive upward wave of his hand, the steepness of the mountains bordering the river. He suggested that, if we were anxious to see the confluence of the Abbai and Dadessa, we would be well advised to follow the track from Nekemti to Nejo, thence along a known track to the junction.

==Anger Irrigation Dam==
On 14 June 2021, the construction of the Anger Irrigation Dam at Didessa River was launched by the President of Oromia regional state, Shimelis Abdisa, and Minister of Water, Irrigation and Energy, Sileshi Bekele, to be completed in three years.

<text>Josef Franz Leo Schwammberger (14 February 1912 – 3 December 2004) was a German SS (&quot;Schutzstaffel&quot;) Non-Commissioned Officer, Oberscharführer, war criminal, and commandant of the camps in Rozwadów, Przemyśl, and Mielec.

==Biography==
During the Second World War, Schwammberger was a commander of various SS Arbeitslager (forced-labor camps) in the Kraków district (late August 1942 until spring 1944).

He was arrested in Innsbruck, Austria, in the French occupation zone after the war on 19 July 1945, but escaped in January 1948 and within months was able to enter Argentina, where he lived under his own name and obtained citizenship. West German authorities sought his extradition beginning in 1973, and Argentine officials tracked him down on 13 November 1987. After two years of fighting extradition, he was returned to West Germany in May 1990 for trial. His capture cost the German state of Baden-Württemberg just under 500,000 Deutschmark.

At his trial, which lasted nearly a year (1991 until 1992), Schwammberger denied being guilty of the crimes of which he was charged; he simply admitted that &quot;Ghetto A&quot; was taken to the Przemyśl camp. On 18 May 1992 he was sentenced by the Stuttgart regional court (&quot;Landgericht&quot;) to life imprisonment, which he was to serve in Mannheim. He was found guilty of seven counts of murder and 32 counts of being an accessory to murder.

In August 2002, the Mannheim regional court declined a parole request due to the unusual cruelty of his offences; he had been found guilty of carrying out arbitrary murders based on racial hatred against Jewish people.

His wife Käthe Schwammberger died in 2003 at the age of 87 in Argentina before Schwammberger himself died in prison on 3 December 2004, aged 92.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center was instrumental in bringing him to justice. Also contributing to the case against Schwammberger, including his extradition from Argentina, was Elliot Welles and Anna Unger Weinberg.

<doc id="1243260" wikidata="Q1680475" url="?curid=1243260" title="James D. Griffin">
<text>James Donald Griffin (June 29, 1929 – May 25, 2008) was an American politician who served in the New York State Senate (56th District, 1967–77) and then for 16 years as the Mayor of Buffalo, New York (1978–93). He later returned to public life serving as a member of the Buffalo Common Council.

==Early life==
Griffin, an Irish American, hailed from South Buffalo, the son of Helen (O&#x27;Brien) and Thomas Griffin. He served in the United States Army during the Korean War.

Griffin was a registered Democrat during his political career. However, he was very conservative compared to the party platform, especially on social issues. He was frequently cross-endorsed by the Conservative and Republican parties. He was a Buffalo city councilman in the 1960s.

He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1967 to 1977, sitting in the 177th, 178th, 179th, 180th, 181st, and 182nd New York State Legislatures.

==Mayor of Buffalo==
Griffin was elected mayor of Buffalo in November 1977, and was sworn in on January 1, 1978. He had lost the Democratic primary for mayor to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker Arthur Eve. In the general election, he was the nominee of the Conservative Party and defeated Eve to be elected mayor. He was reelected in 1981, 1985, and 1989.

As mayor, Griffin was sometimes known for his outspoken personality. During a January 1985 blizzard, he recommended to Buffalo residents &quot;go home, buy a six pack of beer, and watch a good football game.&quot; This earned him the nickname &quot;Jimmy Six Pack&quot;.

While mayor, he was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for Erie County executive in 1991, losing to incumbent Dennis Gorski. In 1996, Griffin sought the Democratic nomination for president in the New Hampshire primary, finishing a very distant eighth to Bill Clinton. After the &quot;Spring of Life&quot; demonstration in April 1992 where Griffin encouraged pro-life groups such as Operation Rescue to protest in Buffalo, he declined to seek a fifth term as mayor and was succeeded by Democrat Anthony Masiello.

==Postmayoral career==

Griffin remained as outspoken and controversial as a former mayor as he was during his career in City Hall. He frequently commented on public policy issues in Buffalo. He ran again for Mayor in the 1997 election, running on the Right to Life line and losing to Masiello. He then unsuccessfully sought a seat in the New York State Assembly against future Congressman Brian Higgins (where Griffin was defeated in his home base of South Buffalo for the only time in his elector career) and was rumored to have an interest in a seat in the Erie County Legislature that was vacated in 2001, although in the end he did not run. In 2002, he led an effort to recall Masiello from office. This effort fell through because of petition discrepancies and disputes over whether a recall election was legal in New York State.

In 1996, Griffin entered the New Hampshire Democratic Presidential Primary election, finishing well behind incumbent Bill Clinton, and even garnering fewer votes than perennial candidate and satirist Pat Paulsen.

In 2003, Griffin was elected to a two-year term in the Buffalo Common Council, representing the South District. Taking office in 2004, Griffin was named Chairman of the Claims Committee and started working on fiscal issues relating to the Buffalo fiscal crisis. He also criticized Masiello&#x27;s handling of city finances. Griffin focused much of his time on issues in his district.

In the spring of 2005, Griffin resigned from the council with several months left in his term. He said he had completed what he sought to accomplish as a councilman and was retiring from public life.

On January 28, 2007, during an interview on the Hardline with Hardwick radio program on Buffalo radio station WBEN, Griffin said he might once again run for Erie County Executive as a Democrat. The County Executive at that time, Joel Giambra, had announced he would not be seeking re-election. Then on April 15, 2007, he announced on WWKB&#x27;s &quot;Public Opinions with Wayne Mack&quot; that he had discussed running again with his wife, and decided he did not wish to seek public office anymore.

However, on July 17, 2007, Griffin announced that he was joining the race for the Erie County Executive seat, against fellow South Buffalonian and endorsed Democratic Party candidate Jim Keane. Griffin was correctly considered an underdog and did not have much—if any—money with which to run a campaign. When the votes were counted after the primary on September 18, 2007, Griffin ran 3rd in a three-way race with about 23% of the vote. He ran his campaign with only $11,000.00 against the millions his opponents spent on their campaigns. Griffin then said he had run his last electoral race and considered himself retired from political competition. Griffin later endorsed the candidacy of Republican candidate and with the assistance of his group of campaign volunteers, helped Christopher C. Collins win the election for Erie County Executive.

Griffin died on May 25, 2008, at the Father Baker Manor in Orchard Park, from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. His wife, Margaret &quot;Margie&quot; Griffin (née McMahon), died in July 2011. The couple had three children.

==Legacy==

Griffin had 3 children named Maureen, Megan, and Tom.

Following his death, the Buffalo Common Council voted to rename the address of Sahlen Field to One James D. Griffin Plaza in his honor.

A bronze sculpture of Griffin titled &quot;The First Pitch&quot; by artist William Koch was erected outside Sahlen Field in 2012 to honor Griffin&#x27;s contributions in bringing the ballpark and professional baseball to Buffalo.

Until Byron Brown swept his opponent to win a record 5th term in 2021, Griffin was the longest-serving mayor of Buffalo, and from January 3, 2021 until December 31, 2021, he shared this title with Brown, but at midnight on January 1, the tie was broken.

<doc id="1243282" wikidata="Q5466540" url="?curid=1243282" title="Footplate">
<text>A footplate provides the structure on which a locomotive driver and fireman stand in the cab to operate a British or continental European steam locomotive. It comprises a large metal plate that rests on top of the locomotive frame, usually it is covered with wooden floorboards. It takes up the full width of the locomotive cab, and in depth it extends from the front of the cab to the coal bunker on the tender. The cab and other superstructure elements are in turn mounted on it. On some locomotives, the footplate is extended beyond the front of the cab to form a walkway around the boiler – usually referred to as the &quot;running board&quot; or &quot;foot board&quot; – to facilitate inspection and maintenance. 

In Britain, the word remains in use as a synonym for the cab or working in the cab, even in the context of diesel and electric locomotives, as in the expression of working &quot;on the footplate&quot;. 

The term can also be applied to the external step along the side of a classical tram.

==National variations==

Although a footplate was almost universal in British locomotive design, and often in continental European locomotives, it was never a common feature of steam locomotives constructed in North America, and disappeared from Russian locomotives and big-power locomotives in British colonies (or former colonies), Australia and New Zealand during the 20th century. On those locomotives, the boiler and cab were mounted directly on the frame, and the walkway around the boiler – &quot;running board&quot; or &quot;foot board&quot; – was not a structural element.

==Details==

The footplate has openings cut in it for various purposes. The firebox always extends beneath the footplate. The cylinders are beneath the footplate, and steam pipes pass through holes to them. The reversing gear control for the valve gear also passes through, and in some locomotives part of the valve motion also extends through the footplate. 
 
On British Railways Standard Locomotives the running plate/board was high enough to clear the wheels; on earlier British locomotives, the tops of driving wheels usually projected through slots in it and were covered by &quot;splashers&quot; – analogous to mudguards on a road vehicle.

<doc id="1243286" wikidata="Q7435484" url="?curid=1243286" title="Scot Thompson">
<text>Scot Thompson (born February 11, 1981, in New York, New York) is an American soccer player.

On January 20, 2010, he was ranked 21st in the USL First Division Top 25 of the Decade, which announced a list of the best and most influential players of the previous decade. He was the official community ambassador for the Portland Timbers and involved in social media connecting with fans, both Twitter and Facebook, for the Timbers.

==Career==

===Youth and College===
Thompson grew up in Rancho Santa Margarita, California, and was a standout defender at Trabuco Hills High School from 1995 to 1999, where he was a four-year Varsity starter, and earned all South Coast League 1st Team Honors for three years. During this time, Thompson was invited to train with the US National Under-19 Squad. In Thompson&#x27;s senior year the Mustangs earned a share of the South Coast League title and were knocked out of the quarter-finals of the CIF playoffs.

Thompson played college soccer at UCLA from 1999 to 2002, helping lead the Bruins to a national championship in 2002. He finished his career at UCLA with 68 starts, and was named to the first-team All-Pac-10 as a senior.

===Professional===
Thompson was selected in the second round (16th overall) in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by Los Angeles Galaxy. Unfortunately for Thompson, he tore his ACL in the preseason, and missed the entire 2003 season as a result. Returning healthy in 2004, Thompson was nevertheless unable to break into the Galaxy&#x27;s starting lineup - he was loaned mid-season to the Portland Timbers of the A-League, where he excelled. Thompson started 13 games for the team, registering two assists, while helping lead the team to the A-League&#x27;s best regular season record. When the Timbers were eliminated from the playoffs, Thompson returned to the Galaxy; however, he only made one appearance, playing a single minute.

Thompson was released at the end of the season and, despite professing intentions of going to Europe, re-signed with the Timbers. In July 2005, Thompson put in an impressive performance for the Timbers in a friendly match against English soccer team Sunderland, which had been recently promoted to the English Premier League. He was invited to participate in a several week training session with Sunderland later in 2005, although he was not offered a contract with the club. History repeated itself in 2006: after an impressive performance in an exhibition match against English soccer team Coventry City, he was invited to a 10-day trial training session in August.

Thompson became the Timbers all-time leader in minutes on July 23, 2009. On February 26, 2010, Portland announced the re-signing of Thompson to a new contract for the 2010 season.

After a particularly noteworthy play, his fans in Portland routinely chant &quot;S-C-O-T, Scot with One T!&quot;

===Coaching===
On March 7, 2014, Portland Thorns FC announced Thompson had been hired as an assistant coach for the 2014–2015 season.

<doc id="1243294" wikidata="Q19816406" url="?curid=1243294" title="Titi monkey">
<text>The titis, or titi monkeys, are New World monkeys of the subfamily Callicebinae, which contains three extant genera: &quot;Cheracebus&quot;, &quot;Callicebus&quot;, and &quot;Plecturocebus.&quot; This subfamily also contains the extinct genera &quot;Miocallicebus, Homunculus&quot;, and &quot;Carlocebus&quot;.

Titi monkeys live in South America, from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, east through Brazil, and south to Bolivia and northern Paraguay.

==Description==
Depending on species, titis have a head and body length of , and a tail, which is longer than the head and body, of . The different titi species vary substantially in coloring, but resemble each other in most other physical ways. They have long, soft fur, and it is usually reddish, brownish, grayish or blackish, and in most species the underside is lighter or more reddish than the upperside. Some species have contrasting blackish or whitish foreheads, while all members of the genus &quot;Cheracebus&quot; have a white half-collar. The tail is always furry and is not prehensile.

==Behaviour==
Diurnal and arboreal, titis predominantly prefer dense forests near water. They easily jump from branch to branch, earning them their German name, &quot;Springaffen&quot; (jumping monkeys). They sleep at night, but can also take a midday nap.

Titis are territorial. They live in family groups that consist of parents and their offspring, about two to seven animals in total. They defend their territory by shouting and chasing off intruders but rarely engage in actual fighting. Their grooming and communication is important for the co-operation of the group. They can typically be seen in pairs sitting or sleeping with tails entwined.

The diet of the titis consists mainly of fruits, although they also eat leaves, flowers, insects, bird eggs and small vertebrates.

Titis are monogamous, mating for life. The female bears a single young after about a five-month gestation. Twins occur rarely, having been documented in only 1.4% of all births in captive groups of &quot;Plecturocebus moloch&quot;. While the second infant usually does not survive, cases where neighbouring groups have adopted infants are known, suggesting that twins may be reared successfully under certain circumstances. Often it is the father who cares for the young, carrying it and bringing it to the mother only for nursing. Fathers tend to engage in more grooming, food-sharing, inspecting, aggression and playing with infants than mothers. The young are weaned after 5 months and are fully grown after two years. After three or more years, they leave their family group in order to find a mate. While the life expectancy of most species is unclear, the members of the genus &quot;Cheracebus&quot; may live for up to 12 years in the wild, while members of the &quot;P. moloch&quot; group have been known to live for more than 25 years in captivity.

They make elaborate, powerful vocal duets used in long-range communication.

== Classification ==
The number of known species of titis has doubled in recent years, with eight, &quot;P. stephennashi&quot;, &quot;P. bernhardi&quot;, &quot;P. caquetensis&quot;, &quot;P. aureipalatii,&quot; &quot;P. miltoni&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; &quot;urubambensis&quot;, &quot;P. grovesi&quot;, and &quot;P. parecis&quot; being described from the Amazon basin since 2000. Furthermore, the most recent review uses the phylogenetic species concept (thereby not recognizing the concept of subspecies) rather than the &#x27;traditional&#x27; biological species concept. The classification presented here is therefore very different from the classifications used twenty years ago. The naming rights to a recently discovered species were auctioned off (with the funds going to a nonprofit organization), and the winner was the online casino GoldenPalace.com, as reflected in both the common and scientific name of &quot;P. aureipalatii&quot;. While this typically is a highly unusual event in scientific classification, the possibility of naming a species of titi in exchange for a sizable donation to a nonprofit foundation was also presented a few years before, resulting in &quot;P. bernhardi&quot; being named after Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.

Historically, titis were monogeneric and formed the genus &quot;Callicebus&quot; Thomas, 1903. Owing to the great diversity found across titi monkey species, a new genus-level taxonomy was recently proposed that recognises three genera within the subfamily Callicebinae; &quot;Cheracebus&quot; Byrne et al. (2016) for the species of the &quot;torquatus&quot; group (Widow titis); &quot;Callicebus&quot; Thomas, 1903, for species of the Atlantic Forest &quot;personatus&quot; group; and &quot;Plecturocebus&quot; Byrne et al. (2016) for the Amazonian and Chaco titis of the &quot;moloch&quot; and &quot;donacophilus&quot; groups.

<text>HMS &quot;Rushen Castle&quot; (K372) was a of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy. She was named after Castle Rushen in Castletown, Isle of Man.

Built by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Ltd, she was launched on 16 July 1943 and finished on 23 February 1944 - she served as a convoy escort during the Second World War.

She was transferred to the British Air Ministry on 26 September 1960 for use as a weather ship, and was commissioned as &quot;Weather Surveyor&quot; on 21 December 1961. She was sold on 15 July 1977 and converted to a salvage vessel. She was scrapped at Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht in the Netherlands in 1983.

The wartime commanding officer, R. C. Warwick, RNR, published a book, &quot;Really Not Required&quot;, detailing his wartime experience on this ship and his previous command, the anti-submarine trawler .

<text>Callicebus is a genus of monkeys known as titi monkeys.

Historically, titis were monogeneric, comprising only the genus &quot;Callicebus&quot; . Owing to the great diversity found across titi monkey species, a new genus-level taxonomy was recently proposed that recognises three genera within the subfamily Callicebinae; &quot;Cheracebus&quot; for the species of the &quot;torquatus&quot; group (Widow titis); &quot;Plecturocebus&quot; for the Amazonian and Chaco titis of the &quot;moloch&quot; and &quot;donacophilus&quot; groups; and &quot;Callicebus&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, for species of the Atlantic Forest &quot;personatus&quot; group.

In 2014, a previously unknown orange &quot;Callicebus&quot; was spotted in the Peruvian Amazon; it has not been determined whether this constitutes a color variant or a new species.

==Species==
There are 5 species in this genus:
*Barbara Brown&#x27;s titi monkey, &quot;Callicebus barbarabrownae&quot;
* Coimbra Filho&#x27;s titi monkey, &quot;Callicebus coimbrai&quot;
* Coastal black-handed titi monkey, &quot;Callicebus melanochir&quot;
* Black-fronted titi monkey, &quot;Callicebus nigrifrons&quot;
* Atlantic titi monkey, &quot;Callicebus personatus&quot;

<text>Paul Louis Denis Bellot (7 June 1876 in Paris – 5 July 1944 in Montreal) was a French monk and modern architect.

==Biography==
He became an architect in 1900 having studied at the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1902 he became a monk of the Benedictines of Solesmes. These monks were in exile in England, and Bellot began building Quarr Abbey on the Isle of Wight.

In the Netherlands Bellot designed St. Paul&#x27;s Abbey, Oosterhout, for the Order. He designed several churches in the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Canada and Portugal. Most of these are built largely of concrete or brick which were his preferred materials.

Bellot was a member of L&#x27;Arche, an organisation whose goal was to use modern materials and art for religious purposes. In Canada, where he moved in 1937, he influenced several architects (i.e. Dom Claude-Marie Côté, also a Benedictine monk, and Adrien Dufresne, a layman) and his architectural influence became known as &quot;Bellotism&quot;.

His ideas are expounded in &quot;Propos d&#x27;un bâtisseur du Bon Dieu&quot; which was published posthumously in 1949; it is based on lectures he gave in Canada in 1934.

<text>An Olympic Village is a residential complex built or reassigned for the Olympic Games in or nearby the host city for the purpose of accommodating all of the delegations. Olympic Villages are usually located close to the Olympic Stadium within an Olympic Park.

Olympic Villages are built to house all participating athletes during the two weeks of the Games, as well as officials and athletic trainers. After the Games are over, the Olympic Village is typically sold or rented to the local population and turned into a new residential zone for the host city.

The accommodation provided for the 1932 Summer Games in Los Angeles is considered to be the first official modern Olympic Village, and the first permanent Olympic Village was established at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland.

After the Munich massacre at the 1972 Olympics, the Villages have been made extremely secure. Only athletes, trainers and officials are allowed to room at the Village, though family members and former Olympic athletes are allowed inside with proper checks. Press and media are also barred.

==History==

For the first editions of the modern Olympic Games, between 1896 and 1920, there were no official living arrangements for athletes. Some athletes stayed in hotels or hostels, others in schools or barracks, and some even slept in the boats they had taken to the host city.

The prototype for the Olympic Village comes from Pierre de Coubertin, then president of the International Olympic Committee. The &quot;General Technical Rules&quot; applicable to the 1924 Summer Games in Paris stipulated that &quot;The Organising Committee for the Olympic Games is required to provide the athletes with accommodation, bedding and food, at a fixed rate which shall be set beforehand per person and per day….&quot;

As result, the organizers built wooden huts and established an accommodation centre near the Stade Olympique de Colombes called the &quot;Olympic Village,&quot; allowing the various world teams to stay in the same location, under the same conditions, and with common services.

Consideration was given to creating an Olympic Village ahead of the 1928 Games in Amsterdam, but the organizers opted for other solutions.
The accommodation provided for the 1932 Summer Games in Los Angeles is considered to be the first official modern Olympic Village, with a capacity of 2,000 people and located to the west of the city. Consisting of a group of buildings with rooms to lodge athletes (men only), as well as providing a place to eat and train, it serves as the model for today&#x27;s Olympic Villages. It also provided certain community services for the first time, including a hospital, a fire station, and a post office.

Following the 1932 Games, a Village would be created for every edition of the Summer Games, apart from the 1948 London Games due to material challenges brought on by the immediate post-war period. For the Winter Games between 1924 and 1956, the teams would still mainly stay in hotels, with the exception of the 1952 Games in Oslo, where three accommodation sites were created.

Women, on the other hand, stayed in other accommodation sites until 1952. This changed with the Melbourne Games of 1956, where women had their own part of the main Olympic Village. This area of the Village would not admit male athletes, and it was only from the 1984 Games in Los Angeles onward that athletes were accommodated by team rather than gender.

The first permanent Olympic Village was established at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland.

After the Munich Massacre at the 1972 Olympics, the Villages have been made extremely secure.

==List of Olympic Villages==
Prototype complexes:
* Athens 1906 (Intercalated Games): The Zappeion, which was used during Athens 1896 as the main Fencing Hall, was used in 1906 as a (not purpose-built) Olympic Village.
* Paris 1924: In Paris in 1924, a number of cabins were built near the stadium to house visiting athletes; the complex was called &quot;Olympic Village&quot;.
Official Olympic Villages
* Los Angeles 1932: An Olympic Village was built for the first time in Baldwin Hills, occupied by male athletes. It consisted of several hundred buildings, including post and telegraph offices, an amphitheater, a hospital, a fire department, and a bank. Female athletes were housed at the Chapman Park Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard.

* Berlin 1936: About 145 one- and two-story apartment buildings, &quot;Haus der Nationen&quot; refectory, &quot;Hindenburghaus&quot; theater, a hospital, an indoor arena, a swimming pool and a sauna in Wustermark about 9.5 kilometres west of Berlin. Used as barracks for over 50 years, the buildings are partially ruined. A men&#x27;s residence has been restored under the name &quot;Jesse Owens house&quot;.
* Helsinki 1952: The first Olympic Village, &quot;Olympiakylä&quot;, was constructed in the Käpylä district of Helsinki for the planned 1940 Summer Olympics, which were cancelled due to World War II. Another Olympic Village, &quot;Kisakylä&quot;, was built nearby for the 1952 Olympics. Kisakylä couldn&#x27;t accommodate all athletes so other villages were also designated for instance in Otaniemi and the Santahamina military base. Both Olympiakylä and Kisakylä areas are listed by Docomomo as significant examples of modern architecture in Finland.

* Melbourne 1956: The area in Heidelberg West, Victoria, where the athletes stayed is still called &quot;Olympic Village&quot;. After the games, athlete residences were used for public housing. The area now consists of a sports center, a primary school, shopping strip, a community health centre which also houses a registered training organization and a legal service. 
* Squaw Valley 1960: Four identical three-story apartment buildings, two of which still stand, modified into condominiums.
* Rome 1960: consist of 33 buildings with two, three, four and even five floors.
*Innsbruck 1964 and 1976: A two phases housing buildings at Neu Arzl Olympic Village district.
* Tokyo 1964: Main village in Yoyoki, with 4 other satellite village in Tokyo. 
* Mexico City 1968: 904 apartments distributed in 29 multi-story buildings in the Miguel Hidalgo Olympic Village Complex.
* Munich 1972: Multiple buildings of 25, 22, 20, 19, 16, 15, and 12 stories, used now as Olympic Village student housing.

* Montreal 1976: Olympic Village (Montreal) consists of two 23-story pyramid-shaped buildings, which are now apartment buildings.
* Lake Placid 1980: Later converted into a Federal Prison FCI Ray Brook.
* Moscow 1980: Eighteen 16-story buildings.
* Sarajevo 1984: Apartment buildings now used as condominiums and tourist facilities.
* Los Angeles 1984 and 2028: The UCLA residents&#x27; facilities, CSULA, USC, and UCSB.
* Calgary 1988: Presently student accommodations on the campus of the University of Calgary. The athlete&#x27;s village consisted of the existing Kananaskis, Rundle, Castle, Norquay and Brewster buildings, as well as the newly constructed Glacier and Olympus buildings.
* Seoul 1988: Twenty-one multiple-story buildings located in Jamsil. 
* Albertville 1992: Brides-les-Bains
* Barcelona 1992: A new neighbourhood, La Vila Olímpica, was built on reclaimed sea front in Poblenou; it became residential after the Games. Secondary villages were built in Banyoles and La Seu d&#x27;Urgell for rowing and white water canoeing athletes respectively.
*Lillehammer 1994: The village was built on a west-facing slope just to the north of Lillehammer, and took its form from the old farms of Gudbrandsdal.
* Atlanta 1996: Housing was built on the campus of Georgia Institute of Technology, Clark Atlanta University, and Georgia State University. The Olympic village at Georgia State was later bought by Georgia Tech for students&#x27; housing. The village on the campus of Clark Atlanta, later became housing for students at CAU.
* Nagano 1998: The village is located 7 kilometers southwest of Nagano Station. The total land space is 19 hectares. There are 1032 apartments in 22 buildings, and is capable of accommodating 3,000 people. A secondary Village was in Karuizawa, the site for the newly entered Olympic sport of curling. Karuizawa is about 70 kilometers southeast of Nagano City. 120 people from 9 countries stayed at the Karuizawa Skate Center Hotel during the Winter Games.

<doc id="1243326" wikidata="Q5597675" url="?curid=1243326" title="Gratia Countryman">
<text>Gratia Alta Countryman (pronounced gray-sha) (November 29, 1866 – July 26, 1953) was a nationally-known librarian who led the Minneapolis Public Library from 1904 to 1936. She was the daughter of immigrant farmers Alta and Levi Countryman. She pioneered many ways to make the library more accessible and user-friendly to all of the city&#x27;s residents, regardless of age or economic position. Countryman was called the &quot;first lady of Minneapolis&quot; and the &quot;Jane Addams of the libraries&quot;.

== Early life ==
Gratia Countryman was born on November 29, 1866 to Levi and Alta Chamberlain Countryman. Her father was a Latin scholar and Civil War veteran who had studied at Hamline University, and named her after the Latin root of thanks. She had two older brothers and a younger sister. Countryman graduated from Hastings High School in 1882, and her father moved the family to Minneapolis so that both she and her sister could attend college.

== Professional life ==
Countryman graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Science degree and Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1889. She was recommended by university president Cyrus Northrop to Herbert Putnam for a job at the Minneapolis Public Library, where she started in 1889 under James Kendall Hosmer. She was the nation&#x27;s first female head librarian at the Minneapolis Public Library from 1904 to 1936. When she accepted this job, she knew that she would be making one third less than her predecessor, with a yearly salary of $2,000.

Due to her philosophy of outreach, collections and reading rooms were established in Minneapolis fire halls, factories, hospitals, and an open-air reading area in Gateway Park. Countryman was a capable leader who, over her 32 years as head librarian, helped increase the library’s scope and reach exponentially. She oversaw the building of 12 branches and a mobile library truck, and she and her staff added over 500,000 volumes to the already substantial catalog. The programs she developed encouraged children to read, continued the education of adolescents and young adults, and helped adults find and hold jobs during times of war, recession and depression.

She was very active in the Minnesota Library Association and served as MLA president in 1904 and 1905. She established The Minnesota Library Commission and remained recording secretary of that group until 1918. From 1912 to 1914, Countryman organized and was president of the Foreign Policy Association Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom. She also served on the National Liberty and War Service Committee and the Woman&#x27;s Warfare League.

In 1931, she was awarded the Civic Service Honor Medal by the Inter-Racial Service Council of Minneapolis for Outstanding Civic Service for work with immigrants. In 1932, she was awarded an honorary MA degree from the University of Minnesota for Distinguished Public Service; this was &quot;only the fourth honorary degree conferred by the university and the first received by a woman.&quot;

In 1934, Countryman served as president of the American Library Association. She was forced into retirement by the city&#x27;s pension law at age 70 in 1936.

== Personal life ==
Countryman never married but lived with her longtime partner, Marie Todd, for thirty eight years. In May 1917, they took in a homeless boy named Wellington Wilson, and Countryman later was awarded guardianship of him. Wellington Wilson later changed his name to Wellington Countryman. He eventually married and had a daughter whom he named Alta Countryman after his adoptive mother. The Countrymans lived in Chicago, Illinois, and Wellington died in 1997.

Gratia Countryman&#x27;s eulogy summed up her life perfectly: &quot;In her youth a library was a sacred precinct for guarding the treasures of thought, to be entered only by the scholar and the student... Her crusading zeal carried the book to every part of her city and county, to the little child, the factory worker, the farmer, the businessman, the hospital patient, the blind and the old.&quot;

<text>Casey State Recreation Site is a day-use only state park located 29 miles northeast of Medford, Oregon off Oregon Route 62. The parks offers picnic and boating facilities, as well as access to the Rogue River. It is located on the Crater Lake Highway and is a popular salmon fishing area.

The land for the park was leased from the federal government in 1932 and purchased in 1937. At the time of the lease, there were two residents on the land. One of them, James Allen Casey (J.A. Casey or &quot;Jack&quot; Casey), who was born in Kansas, had built a small restaurant and tourist camp, called Casey&#x27;s Auto Camp. James Allen Casey believed he had homesteaded the land, many years before it was &quot;discovered&quot; to be federal land. ([James &quot;Jack&quot; Casey was directly
descended from John Wallace—Sir John Wallace [Sir John—Brother of William &quot;Braveheart&quot; Wallace—Laird of Elderslie, 1273-1306], who was executed for essentially the same reason, and in the same way,
as his father and brother William were before him.])

Since the residents did not then own the land, they were granted three-year leases. The Civilian Conservation Corps improved the existing facilities; adding a parking lot, more tables, individual stoves, a boat ramp,
and trails.

<text>Carey Talley (born August 26, 1976) is an American former professional soccer player.

==Career==

===College===
Talley played high school soccer for Houston High School in Germantown, Tennessee. His team won the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association soccer championship his junior and senior years in 1993 and 1994. He played his club soccer for Memphis Futbol Club. Some notable teammates on his Memphis Futbol Club &#x27;76 youth soccer team were future Major League Soccer standouts and United States men&#x27;s national soccer team members, Richard Mulrooney, Tony Kuhn, Ross Paule and Jonny Walker. Talley played college soccer at the University of North Carolina from 1994 to 1997. He finished his career at UNC with 26 goals and 22 assists in 75 games. On February 1, 2020, Carey was inducted into the Tennessee State Soccer Association Hall of Fame.

===Professional===
Upon graduating, Talley was drafted 14th overall by D.C. United in the 1998 MLS College Draft. Talley immediately earned a spot in the United lineup, starting 19 games and appearing in 29; he would remain in that role for the next three years, winning an MLS Cup with the team in 1999. During the 1999 MLS Cup title season Talley scored a career-high 4 goals. He scored his first MLS goal on May 15, 1999, at Kansas City, and started all six playoff matches for DC, including MLS Cup 1999, which United won 2–0 over the Galaxy.

In 2002, Talley was traded to the Kansas City Wizards for future considerations; although he was usually a starter when healthy. Talley had injury problems in 2003, and was subsequently traded in the off-season to the Dallas Burn along with Eric Quill in exchange for Shavar Thomas. Although he had little playing time at the beginning of the season, Talley eventually supplanted Philip Salyer as the team&#x27;s starting right back, and finished the year with one assist in 19 starts.

After playing in 20 games in 2005, he was shipped to Real Salt Lake. In his first season with RSL, he Posted career-highs after starting in all 30 appearances and logging 2,618 minutes played, and tied for second on squad and recorded a career-best eight assists from his right back position. On May 13, 2006, he recorded his first two-assist game at the Los Angeles Galaxy, helping RSL to a 3–0 win and its first-ever road victory.

On May 9, 2008, he was traded to Chivas USA for a future conditional pick in the 2010 or 2011 MLS SuperDraft. During his stay with Chivas, he appeared in 43 league matches scoring 1 goal, being primarily deployed as the club&#x27;s starting right back.

In March 2010, he was released by Chivas USA and later signed by D.C. United. Talley appeared in 15 league matches for United upon his return to the side appearing in 15 matches and scoring 1 goal.

He was traded by D.C. United to New York Red Bulls on September 15, 2010, in exchange for a 2011 MLS SuperDraft 2nd round pick. The move was made by New York to help strengthen the squad during its playoff run.

After the 2010 MLS season New York declined Talley&#x27;s contract option and he elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Talley became a free agent in Major League Soccer when he was not selected in the Re-Entry draft.

On January 19, 2011, Talley officially announced his retirement from professional soccer.

===International===
Although he has played at the U-17, U-20, and U-23 levels, Talley has never made a full United States national team appearance. He has been called into several camps, and came very close to entering a game against Chile in 2000; he was about to be employed as a late-game substitute, but the game was called.

==Honors==

===D.C. United===
*MLS Cup (1): 1999
*CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup (1): 1998
*Copa Interamericana (1): 1998

<text>The Chachapoyas, also called the &quot;Warriors of the Clouds&quot;, were a culture of the Andes living in the cloud forests of the southern part of the Department of Amazonas of present-day Peru. The Inca Empire conquered their civilization shortly before the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. At the time of the arrival of the &quot;conquistadores&quot;, the Chachapoyas were one of the many nations ruled by the Incas, although their incorporation had been difficult due to their constant resistance to Inca troops.

Since the Incas and conquistadors were the principal sources of information on the Chachapoyas, little first-hand or contrasting knowledge of the Chachapoyas has been found. Writings by the major chroniclers of the time, such as Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, were based on fragmentary, second-hand accounts. Much of what is known about the Chachapoya culture is based on archaeological evidence from ruins, pottery, tombs, and other artifacts. Spanish chronicler Pedro Cieza de León noted that, after their annexation to the Inca Empire, they adopted customs imposed by the Cusco-based Inca. By the 18th century, the Chachapoyas had been devastated, but they remain a distinct strain within the indigenous peoples of modern Peru.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Chachapoya&quot; was given to this culture by the Inca; the name that these people may have actually used to refer to themselves is not known. The meaning of the word Chachapoya may be derived from the Quechua &quot;sach&#x27;a phuyu&quot; (&quot;sach&#x27;a&quot; = tree, &quot;phuyu&quot; = cloud) meaning &quot;cloud forest&quot;. Another possibility is that it may derive from &quot;sach&#x27;a-p-qulla&quot; (&quot;sach&#x27;a&quot; = tree, &quot;p&quot; = of the, &quot;qulla&quot; = the name of a pre-Inca kingdom from Puno) that the Incas used as a collective term for the many kingdoms around Lake Titicaca, the equivalent of &quot;qulla people who live in the woods&quot;.

==Geography==
The Chachapoyas&#x27; territory was located on the eastern slopes of the Andes, in present-day northern Peru. It encompassed the triangular region formed by the confluence of the Marañón River and the Utcubamba in Bagua Province, up to the basin of the Abiseo River where the Gran Pajáten is located. This territory also included land to the south up to the Chuntayaku River, exceeding the limits of the current Amazonas Region towards the south. The center of the Chachapoya culture, though, was the basin of the Utcubamba River. Due to the great size of the Marañón River and the surrounding mountainous terrain, the region was relatively isolated from the coast and other areas of Peru, although archaeological evidence shows some interaction between the Chachapoyas and other cultures.

The contemporary Peruvian city of Chachapoyas, Peru, derives its name from the word for this ancient culture, as does the defined architectural style. Inca Garcilaso de la Vega noted that the Chachapoyas territory was extensive:
The area of the Chachapoyas is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Amazonian Andes&quot; due to its being part of a mountain range covered by dense tropical forest. The Amazonian Andes constitute the eastern flank of the Andes, which were once covered by dense Amazon vegetation. The region extended from the cordillera spurs up to elevations where primary forests still stand, usually above . The cultural realm of the Amazonian Andes occupied land situated between in elevation.

==History==

The period from the adoption of ceramic technology until conquest, around 1400 to 1450 AD, is called the &quot;Initial Period Manachaqui phase&quot;.

Following the Inca conquest, multiple available sources point to how the Chachapoya responded to said conquest. While archaeological evidence shows both Inca and Chachapoya settlements in the area, suggesting that they accepted Inca rule over their lands, historical sources say that the Chachapoya had more of a rebellious attitude towards their conquerors.

==Archaeological sites==

The major urban centers, such as the great fortress of Kuelap, with more than 400 interior buildings and massive exterior stone walls reaching upwards of in height, and Gran Pajatén possibly served to defend against the Wari culture around 800 AD, a Middle Horizon culture that covered much of the coast and highlands. Referred to as the &quot;Machu Picchu of the north&quot;, Kuélap receives few visitors due to its remote location.

Other archaeological sites in the region include the settlement of Gran Saposoa, the Atumpucro complex, and the burial sites at Revash and Laguna de las Momias (&quot;Mummy Lake&quot;), among others. An estimated only 5% of sites of the Chachapoyas have been excavated according to a BBC documentary from January 2013.

===Inca occupation and forced resettlement===
The conquest of the Chachapoyas by the Inca Empire took place, according to Garcilaso, during the government of Tupac Inca Yupanqui in the second half of the 15th century. He recounts that the warlike actions began in Pias, a community on a mountain on the edge of Chachapoyas territory likely to the southwest of Gran Pajatén.

According to de la Vega, the Chachapoyas anticipated an Inca incursion and began preparations to withstand it at least two years earlier. The chronicle of Pedro Cieza de León also documents Chachapoya resistance. During the time of Huayna Capac&#x27;s regime, the Chachapoyas rebelled:

In response, Huayna Capac, who was in the Ecuadorian Cañaris&#x27; land at the time, sent messengers to negotiate peace, but again &quot;his messengers were greeted with threats of death&quot;. Huayna Capac then ordered an attack. He crossed the Marañón over a bridge of wooden rafts that he ordered to be built, probably near Balsas District near Celendín.

From here, Inca troops proceeded to Cajamarquilla (now in Bolívar Province, Peru), with the intention to &quot;raze the entire country&quot; of the Chachapoyas. From Cajamarquilla, a delegation of women came to meet them, led by a matron who was a former concubine of Tupac Inca Yupanqui, Huayna Capac&#x27;s father. They asked for mercy and forgiveness, which the Sapa Inca granted them. In memory of this event of a peace agreement, the place where the negotiation had taken place was declared sacred and closed so from that point on, &quot;no creature, man or beast, should ever set foot upon it.&quot;

To assure the pacification of the Chachapoyas, the Incas installed garrisons in the region. They also arranged the transfer of groups of villagers under the system of &quot;mitma&quot; (forced resettlement):
The Inca presence in the territory of Chachapoyas left structures at Quchapampa, Amazonas, in the outskirts of the Utcubamba in the current Leimebamba District, as well as other sites.

In the 15th century, the Inca empire expanded to incorporate the Chachapoyas region. Although fortifications such as the citadel at Kuélap may have been an adequate defense against the invading Inca, by this time the Chachapoyas settlements may have become decentralized and fragmented after the threat of Wari invasion had dissipated. The Chachapoyas were conquered by Inca ruler Tupac Inca Yupanqui around 1475. The defeat of the Chachapoyas was fairly swift, although smaller rebellions continued for many years. Using the &quot;mitma&quot; system of ethnic dispersion, the Inca attempted to quell these rebellions by forcing large numbers of Chachapoya people to resettle in remote locations of the empire.

When civil war broke out within the Inca empire, the Chachapoyas were located on middle ground between the northern capital at Quito, ruled by Atahualpa, and the southern capital at Cusco, ruled by Atahualpa&#x27;s brother, Huáscar. Many of the Chachapoyas were conscripted into Huáscar&#x27;s army, and heavy casualties ensued. After Atahualpa&#x27;s eventual victory, many more of the Chachapoyas were executed or deported due to their former allegiance with Huáscar.

Due to the harsh treatment of the Chachapoyas during the years of subjugation, many of the Chachapoyas initially chose to side with the Spanish conquistadors when they arrived in Peru. Huaman, a local ruler from Quchapampa, pledged his allegiance to conquistador Francisco Pizarro after the capture of Atahualpa in Cajamarca. The Spanish moved in and occupied Cochabamba, extorting from the local inhabitants whatever riches they could find.

During Manco Inca Yupanqui&#x27;s rebellion against the Spanish Empire, his emissaries enlisted the help of a group of Chachapoyas, but Huaman&#x27;s supporters remained loyal to the Spaniards. By 1547, a large faction of Spanish soldiers arrived in the city of Chachapoyas, effectively ending the Chachapoyas&#x27; independence. Residents were relocated to Spanish-style towns, often with members of several different &quot;ayllu&quot; occupying the same settlement. Disease, poverty, and attrition led to severe decreases in population; by some accounts, the population of the Chachapoyas region decreased by 90% over the course of 200 years after the arrival of the Spanish.

Choquequirao, an Incan site in southern Peru close to Machu Picchu, was in part built by &quot;mitmaqkuna&quot; of Chachapoyan origin during the regime of Tupac Inca Yupanqui.

==Appearance and origins==
Cieza de León remarked that among the indigenous Peruvians, the Chachapoyas were unusually fair-skinned and famously beautiful:
However, no other account at the time from other travelers to the region mentions the particular &quot;whiteness&quot; of the Chachapoyas. These comments have led to claims, not supported by Cieza de León&#x27;s chronicle, that the Chachapoyas were blond-haired and European in appearance. The chronicle&#x27;s use of the term &quot;white&quot; here antedates its emergence as a racial classification. Another Spanish author, Pedro Pizarro, described all indigenous Peruvians as &quot;white&quot;. Although some authors have quoted Pizarro saying that Chachapoyas were blond, these authors do not quote him directly; instead, they quote remarks attributed to him and others by race scientist Jacques de Mahieu in support of his thesis that Vikings had brought civilization to the Americas. Following up on these claims, anthropologist Inge Schjellerup examined Chachapoya remains and found them consistent with other ancient Peruvians. She found, for example, a universal occurrence of shovel-shaped upper incisors and a near-complete absence of the cusp of Carabelli on upper molars — characteristics consistent with other indigenous peoples and inconsistent with Europeans.

According to the analysis of the Chachapoya objects made by the Antisuyo expeditions of the Instituto de Arqueología Amazónica, the Chachapoyas do not exhibit Amazon cultural tradition, but one more closely resembling an Andean one. Given that the terrain facilitates peripatric speciation, as evidenced by the high biodiversity of the Andean region, the physical attributes of the Chachapoyas are most likely reflecting founder effects, assortative mating, and/or related phenomena in an initially small population sharing a relatively recent common ancestor with other indigenous groups.

The anthropomorphous sarcophagi resemble imitations of funeral bundles provided with wooden masks typical of the &quot;Middle Horizon&quot;, a dominant culture on the coast and highlands, also known as the Tiwanaku–Wari culture. The &quot;mausoleums&quot; may be modified forms of the &quot;chullpa&quot; or &quot;pucullo&quot;, elements of funeral architecture observed throughout the Andes, especially in the Tiwanaku and Wari cultures.

Population expansion into the Amazonian Andes seems to have been driven by the desire to expand agrarian land, as evidenced by extensive terracing throughout the region. The agricultural environments of both the Andes and the coastal region, characterized by its extensive desert areas and limited soil suitable for farming, became insufficient for sustaining a population like the ancestral Peruvians, which had grown for 3000 years.

This theory has been described as &quot;mountainization of the rain forest&quot; for both geographical and cultural reasons: First, after the fall of the tropical forests, the scenery of the Amazonian Andes changed to resemble the barren mountains of the Andes; second, the people who settled there brought their Andean culture with them. This phenomenon, which still occurs today, was repeated in the southern Amazonian Andes during the Inca empire, which projected into the |mountainous zone of Vilcabamba, raising examples of Inca architecture such as Machu Picchu.

==Characteristics==

The architectural model of the Chachapoyas is characterized by circular stone constructions, as well as raised platforms constructed on slopes. Their walls were sometimes decorated with symbolic figures. Some structures, such as the monumental fortress of Kuelap and the ruins of Cerro Olán, are prime examples of this architectural style.

Chachapoyan constructions may date to the 9th or 10th century; this architectural tradition still thrived at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire until the latter part of the 16th century. To be sure, the Incas introduced their own style after conquering the Chachapoyas, such as in the case of the ruins of Quchapampa in Leimebamba District.

The presence of two funeral patterns is also typical of the Chachapoyas culture. One is represented by sarcophagi, placed vertically and located in caves that were excavated at the highest point of precipices. The other funeral pattern was groups of mausoleums constructed like tiny houses located in caves worked into cliffs.

Chachapoyan handmade ceramics did not reach the technological level of the Moche or Nazca cultures. Their small pitchers are frequently decorated by cordoned motifs. As for textile art, clothes were generally colored in red. A monumental textile from the precincts of Gran Pajatén had been painted with figures of birds. The Chachapoyas also used to paint their walls, as an extant sample in the tunnels of San Antonio in Luya Province reveals. These walls represent stages of a ritual dance of couples holding hands.

The Chachapoyan culture indicated an egalitarian nonhierarchical society through a lack of archaeological evidence and a lack of power expressing architecture that would be expected for societal leaders such as royalty or aristocracy.

==In popular culture==
In the Indiana Jones franchise, the Golden Idol of the Chachapoyans is the artifact of the opening section seen in the film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Later, Indiana Jones encounters the fictional Hovitos tribe, who are the modern descendants of the Chachapoyan region. While the temple and idol are entirely fictionalized, screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan describes a &quot;Temple of the Chachapoyan Warriors [which is] 2000 years old.&quot;

<text>Ecclesfield is a village and civil parish in the City of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, about 4 miles (6 km) north of Sheffield City Centre. Ecclesfield civil parish had a population of 32,073 at the 2011 Census. Ecclesfield wards of the City of Sheffield had a population of 35,994 in 2011 (Ecclesfield West and Ecclesfield East wards). The population of Ecclesfield village stood at 7,163 in the most recent census.

==History==
Evidence of early settlement in the Ecclesfield area include remnants of Romano-British settlements and field systems in Greno Wood. The earliest known written record of Ecclesfield is from the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, where it is referred to as &quot;Eclesfeld&quot;. The meaning of the name is uncertain. Traditionally it has been derived from the Celtic &quot;egles&quot;, meaning a church, specifically a Romano-British one, and the Old English &quot;feld&quot;, meaning a woodland clearing. Thus the name could mean &quot;Open land near a Romano-British Christian church&quot;. However, an alternative suggestion is that the first element &quot;eccles-&quot; derives from a Saxon personal name or an association with water.

The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; does not mention a church at Ecclesfield. The present Church of St Mary, one of only five Grade I listed buildings in Sheffield, largely dates from the late 15th century, but incorporates features from about 1200. It was the centre of the ancient parish of Ecclesfield, which was one of the most extensive in England before it was broken up in the 19th century. Its style is Perpendicular, with a central tower, and it formerly bore the title of the &quot;Minster of the Moors.&quot;

The Benedictine Ecclesfield Priory, established in the 12th century, served as a cell of St Wandrille&#x27;s Abbey in Normandy until the 14th century, when it passed to the Carthusians. It is a Grade II* listed building.

Ecclesfield had a paper mill in the 1800s.

During the First World War the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) established a Relief landing Ground just outside the eastern boundary of the village, on land that is now largely given over to an industrial estate, near to the current M1 motorway.
&#x27;A&#x27; flight of 33 Squadron used the site during 1916 as part of a Home Defence scheme to protect against Zeppelin raids, but as the threat of raids diminished the Ecclesfield landing site along with several others in the area was de-commissioned. No further flying has been recorded as having taken place.

==Governance==
Local government in Ecclesfield civil parish is in the hands of Ecclesfield Parish Council, which since the election of May 2019 consists of 10 Ecclesfield Parish Independent Councillors and 5 Liberal Democrats.

Before 1974 Ecclesfield Parish was part of Wortley Rural District in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Some southern parts of the parish were annexed to Sheffield City Council in 1968, which has sole control over them. The remainder of the parish was transferred to Sheffield in 1974, as part of local government reorganisation throughout England. The part to the east of the M1 motorway (mainly part of Thorpe Hesley) was subsequently transferred to Rotherham Metropolitan District in 1994 and no longer belongs to Ecclesfield Parish.

The civil parish includes the West Ecclesfield and most of the East Ecclesfield ward of Sheffield. These belong to the Penistone and Stocksbridge parliamentary constituency, whose member since the general election in December 2019 is Miriam Cates.

==Amenities and setting==
Ecclesfield lies in the north of Sheffield, about north of the city centre. The suburb of Ecclesfield is in the south-east of the civil parish with the suburbs Chapeltown and High Green to the north, and Grenoside to the west. Its altitude is to above mean sea level. At the 2001 census the civil parish—which also includes the Sheffield suburbs of Chapeltown, Grenoside, High Green, and formerly Thorpe Hesley (now a suburb of Rotherham)—had a population of 31,609.

Near Ecclesfield&#x27;s old village is Whitley Hall, a 16th-century mansion property now converted into a four-star hotel and restaurant. It is a Grade II* listed building. Ecclesfield also has an old square, a cricket club, a large park, the Gatty Memorial Hall, a cemetery, various shops and other civic amenities. There are two schools, Ecclesfield Comprehensive School, previously Ecclesfield Grammar School, and Ecclesfield Primary School.

On the border of Ecclesfield Parish is Greno Wood, a forested area listed as Grade B on the English Nature Invertebrate Site Register, as of special archaeological and geological significance. The wood is managed by the Wildlife Trust for Sheffield and Rotherham.

==Demography==
The population of Ecclesfield civil parish was recorded as 31,609 in the United Kingdom 2001 Census That of the suburb itself, which extends beyond the civil parish, was about 7,000. The ethnic mix was put at 98.3 per cent white (White British, White Irish, or White Other), 0.4 per cent Asian, 0.4 per cent Black British, 0.1 per cent Chinese, and 0.8 per cent mixed race. In 2011, Ecclesfield was described as being 96.1 per cent White British, 1.0 per cent Asian, 0.4 per cent White Irish, 0.5 per cent Other White and 0.7 per cent Black.

==Gradings==

The Church of St. Mary is a Grade I listed building. It was once the church for the whole of Hallamshire, incorporating the parishes of Sheffield (now Sheffield cathedral) and Bradfield. The remains of Ecclesfield Priory and the Whitley Hall Hotel are Grade II* listed. Greno Wood is listed as Grade B on the English Nature Invertebrate Site Register, as being of special archaeological and geological significance.

==Transport==

The main road routes are the A61, running north–south, and the M1 motorway, skirting the eastern edge. Bus services by First South Yorkshire, Stagecoach Sheffield, Powells Bus Co. and TM Travel link with Sheffield City Centre, Barnsley, Rotherham, Meadowhall Centre and surrounding suburbs. Chapeltown railway station, in the Chapeltown suburb, connects with central Sheffield, Huddersfield and Leeds.

==Sport==
Ecclesfield F.C. was a prominent football team in the area from the 1880s, and Ecclesfield United also represented the area in the FA Cup. Ecclesfield Red Rose FC now represents the area in the Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire County Senior Football League. Whitley Hall Cricket Club plays at Cinder Hill Lane in Ecclesfield.

==The Ecclesfield Carols==
Ecclesfield retains some local, traditional Christmas carols sung in villages, particularly pubs around Sheffield. They are older than today&#x27;s generally known carols and differ from them. They can be heard at the Ecclesfield &quot;Black Bull&quot; on the six Thursdays before Christmas. The repertoire consists of around 30 carols and other songs, some unique to the village, some popular throughout the Sheffield area, some local variants, and some with familiar words to different tunes. (There is a vast number of tunes to &quot;While Shepherds Watched&quot;.) They are often referred to collectively as the Sheffield Carols.

<text>Tengiz Kitovani ( &quot;tengiz k’it’ovani&quot;; 9 June 1938 – 13 November 2023) was a Georgian politician and military commander with high-profile involvement in the Georgian Civil War early in the 1990s when he commanded the National Guard of Georgia.

Kitovani also served as a minister of defense until being gradually sidelined by Eduard Shevardnadze who had earlier been invited to lead the nation after a successful coup d&#x27;etat launched by Kitovani and his allies against President Zviad Gamsakhurdia.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Tbilisi on 9 June 1938, Kitovani graduated from the Tbilisi Fine Arts Academy and taught at a boarding school in the town of Tetritsqaro.

Kitovani entered national politics early in 1990 when the independence movement reached its climax in then-Soviet Georgia. Elected to the Supreme Council of Georgia the same year, he was closely associated with Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a Soviet-era dissident who went on to become the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council and eventually the President of Georgia in 1991. 

In December 1990, Gamsakhurdia decreed the creation of the National Guard of Georgia and appointed Kitovani as its head. However, the two men feuded in August 1991, when Gamsakhurdia sacked him as National Guard commander. Kitovani subsequently claimed that Gamsakhurdia was intending to disband the National Guard, and had been ordered to do so by the leaders of the 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt, but did not produce the documents he claimed to possess confirming this. Kitovani refused to accept his dismissal and left Tbilisi with most of his troops to entrench himself in the Rkoni Gorge. This was the beginning of the end for Gamsakhurdia, whose inflexible politics forced many of his former supporters into opposition.

== Military coup and civil war ==

The confrontation between pro- and anti-Gamsakhurdia factions quickly degenerated into a series of strikes and armed clashes, and eventually, Kitovani, joined by Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s former Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua and the paramilitary leader Jaba Ioseliani, launched a violent coup in December 1991. Ioseliani, as well as Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s supporters and some independent observers, claimed that Kitovani hired some Soviet/Russian troops stationed in Tbilisi to join the attack on the government.

On 2 January 1992, the deposition of Gamsakhurdia and the formation of the Military Council was announced with Kitovani and Ioseliani as its leaders. Gamsakhurdia was forced into exile on 6 January 1992, and the coup leaders invited the former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze to head the post-coup provisional government – the State Council – in March 1992. As a result of the power-sharing arrangement that was eventually struck between Ioseliani, Kitovani, Sigua and Shevardnadze, Kitovani remained the commander of the National Guard and retained a considerable influence on decision-making. In May 1992, Shevardnadze appointed Kitovani Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister in an effort to bring the National Guard under central control. However, both Kitovani and Ioseliani were reluctant to concede power to Shevardnadze and tended to engage in unilateral actions, and in doing so frequently conflicted with each other.

The first and most obvious of such actions were taken by Kitovani during a planned military operation against Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s supporters who had formed pockets of armed resistance in western Georgia and had taken Georgian government officials hostage. On the night of 13 August 1992, Kitovani&#x27;s force entered the autonomous republic of Abkhazia, whose leadership had taken a series of steps towards secession from Georgia, in order to establish control over the region&#x27;s railways sabotaged by Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s loyal militias. Although this operation and show of force resulted in the eventual release of the hostages, Kitovani, acting most probably on his own initiative, proceeded towards Abkhazia&#x27;s capital of Sukhumi and forced the Abkhaz leaders into flight. Shevardnadze failed to have Kitovani&#x27;s force withdrawn from Abkhazia and the country became involved in a thirteen-month-long war which would end in Georgia&#x27;s loss of control over most of Abkhazia. Another version of these events, often quoted in Georgia, says that Russia, while supporting the Abkhaz, also instigated Kitovani to trigger the conflict and perhaps even promised support for his leadership ambitions in Georgia after a successful operation. Later, Shevardnadze would accuse Kitovani of provoking an armed conflict in Abkhazia, claiming that Kitovani disavowed his order and advance with his military to Sukhumi. Kitovani however blamed Shevardnadze for preventing him from following up an offensive on Sukhumi with an attack on the Abkhaz stronghold in Gudauta, home to a Russian military base which supplied the secessionist forces with instructors and munitions.

== Conflict with Shevardnadze ==
During the war in Abkhazia, Kitovani developed a power centre rivalling Shevardnadze&#x27;s and on several occasions challenged Shevardnadze, now Head of State, on defence matters, suggesting that he should be responsible only for foreign policy. Kitovani stood as a candidate in Georgia&#x27;s parliamentary elections of 11 October 1992 and was elected in the single-mandate constituency of Bolnisi. In the aftermath of the elections, Shevardnadze attempted to replace him as Minister of Defence with a professional soldier, General Anatoli Kamkamidze but was unable to do so. Amid persistent rumours that he was planning a new military coup, Kitovani was finally forced into resignation in May 1993 – though a protégé, Gia Karkarashvili, was named as his replacement, and he was able to retain some of his power – partly, according to widespread rumours in Tbilisi, through his control over Georgia&#x27;s &quot;energy mafia&quot; and his &quot;special relationship&quot; with Russian defence minister Pavel Grachev. 

However, Shevardnadze was able to exploit the military setback in Abkhazia to embark on a crackdown on the paramilitary groups and ultimately their leaders. After the pro-Gamsakhurdia rebellion had been quashed with Russian aid by December 1993, Shevardnadze was able to increasingly consolidate his power and deprive both Kitovani and Ioseliani of influence over national security policy.

After spending some time in Russia, Kitovani returned to Tbilisi and, together with Tengiz Sigua and Boris Kakubava, leader of a faction of ethnic Georgian IDPs from Abkhazia, founded the National Front for the Liberation of Abkhazia in the autumn of 1994.

On 13 January 1995, Kitovani, with the support of Tengiz Sigua, led a force of some 700 lightly armed supporters in a march against Abkhazia. They were stopped by Georgian police and arrested. Kitovani was tried for having organized an unlawful armed force and sentenced to eight years&#x27; imprisonment in October 1996. He served four years of his eight-year term and was pardoned by Shevardnadze on medical grounds on 22 May 1999.

== Emigration and return ==
From the early 2000s, Kitovani lived in Moscow from where he harshly criticized the Shevardnadze government on several occasions. In February 2002, he responded scandalously to the mysterious suicide of Nugzar Sajaia, Shevardnadze&#x27;s close ally and an influential Chairman of Georgia&#x27;s National Security Council, making allegations that Sajaia was a homosexual and had ordered the 2001 murder of journalist Giorgi Sanaia. Later that year, Kitovani accused Shevardnadze of being behind the 2002 assassination of Kakhi Asatiani, a businessman and former football star. He also upheld Russia&#x27;s claims that some 700 Chechen fighters had spent that winter in Georgia&#x27;s Pankisi Gorge. He further claimed that Russian General Gennady Shpigun, abducted and killed in Chechnya in 1999/2000, was in fact held captive and put to death in Pankisi, with the body then taken to southern Chechnya. Georgia dismissed all these claims.

Georgian Prosecutor-General Nugzar Gabrichidze claimed that Kitovani had been in close contact with National Guard veterans who staged a failed mutiny on 23 March 2003. Kitovani, however, denied any links with the mutiny.

Kitovani returned to Tbilisi, in December 2012, after the change of government in the aftermath of the October 2012 parliamentary election. In early 2014, President Giorgi Margvelashvili stripped him of his Georgian citizenship.

Kitovani died on 13 November 2023, at age 85.

<text>Archibald Wright &quot;Moonlight&quot; Graham (November 12, 1876 – August 25, 1965) was an American professional baseball player and physician who appeared as a right fielder in a single major league game for the New York Giants on June 29, 1905. His story was popularized by &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot;, a novel by W. P. Kinsella, and the subsequent 1989 film &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, starring Kevin Costner, and featuring Burt Lancaster and Frank Whaley, respectively, as older and younger incarnations of Graham.

==Biography==
Graham was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, the second of ten children born to Alexander (September 12, 1844 – November 2, 1934) and Katherine B. Sloan Graham (March 8, 1855 – January 1, 1939). His brother, Frank Porter Graham, was president of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was later a U. S. Senator. Every one of Graham&#x27;s siblings also finished college.
He played baseball at UNC, where he was also a member of the Dialectic Society, a debating organization.

===Professional baseball career===
Graham went on to play baseball in the minor leagues for seven seasons, starting with the Charlotte Hornets in the Class C North Carolina League in 1902. The following year, he played with Nashua, New Hampshire&#x27;s team in the Class B New England League. Graham also played for the Lowell, Massachusetts and Manchester, New Hampshire teams that season, eventually batting .240 in 89 games with seven triples. In 1904, he spent the entire season with Manchester, hitting .272 in 108 games.

Graham started the 1905 season with the Binghamton Bingoes in the Class B New York State League. He was purchased by the Giants, who had won the National League pennant the previous year (and had refused to play the Boston Americans in a World Series), reporting to the team on May 23, 1905. On June 29, the Giants were the visiting team against the Brooklyn Superbas at Washington Park. At the conclusion of the eighth inning, Graham replaced right fielder George Browne. In the top of the ninth inning, Graham was on deck when Claude Elliott flied out, resulting in the third and final out. Graham played the bottom of the ninth in right field, recording no putouts or assists. That game turned out to be his only appearance in the major leagues.

Graham returned to the New York State League, appearing with the Scranton Miners for the rest of the season and in 1906. For the 1905 minor league season, playing for two teams, he hit .288 in 64 games. The following season, he hit a career-best .329, split between two teams: Scranton, where he hit .336 in 124 games; and the Memphis Egyptians of the Class A Southern Association, where he hit .262 in a dozen games. He returned to Scranton for the 1907 and 1908 seasons, where he hit .285 and .263 in 131 and 130 games, respectively. Graham ranked second in batting average for the New York State League, losing the 1906 batting title by four points. However, according to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball, 2nd Edition&quot; (Lloyd Johnson, Miles Wolff editors), he led the league in batting with an average of .336.

===Medical career===
Graham completed his Doctor of Medicine from the University of Maryland in 1905. While there, he had also played on the school&#x27;s 1904 and 1905 baseball teams. Graham had also added some weight to his 5’ 10&quot; frame and resumed his collegiate football career. He played halfback for Maryland&#x27;s football team in 1904 and 1905. He obtained his license the following year and began practicing medicine in Chisholm, Minnesota.

&quot;Doc&quot; Graham, as he became known after his career as a ballplayer, served the people of Chisholm for fifty years. From 1909 to 1959, Graham was the doctor for the Chisholm schools. For many years, &quot;Doc&quot; Graham made arrangements to have used eyeglasses sent to his Chisholm office. On Saturdays, he would have the children of the Iron Range (Minnesota) miners, from Grand Rapids to Virginia, come to his office, have their eyes checked and then fit them with the proper set of glasses, all free of charge.

===Death===
Graham died in Chisholm in 1965. He is buried in Rochester, Minnesota. The Graham Scholarship Fund, established in his honor, provides financial assistance to two Chisholm High School graduating seniors each year. The award is given to one boy and one girl, $500 to each.

A biography of Graham, &quot;Chasing Moonlight: The True Story of Field of Dreams&#x27; Doc Graham&quot;, was written by sportswriter Brett Friedlander and college professor Robert W. Reising in April 2009.

==In fiction==
In 1975, author W. P. Kinsella happened to notice Graham&#x27;s entry in &quot;The Baseball Encyclopedia&quot;. He made note of his unusual career, and then incorporated Graham as a character in his 1982 novel &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot;, on which the movie &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; was based. Much of the description of Graham&#x27;s life in the novel came from the people of Chisholm as Kinsella visited seeking information on him.

In the novel, the dates of Graham&#x27;s big-league appearance and death are kept as in real life, making the 1905 appearance 74 years before the book&#x27;s 1979 timeframe, and the Ray Kinsella character quickly finds out that Graham has been dead since 1965. The time-travel scene has Kinsella meeting Graham in 1955, ten years before Graham&#x27;s death.

In the movie, the Fenway Park scoreboard shows Graham&#x27;s appearance as having taken place in 1922, 66 years prior before film&#x27;s 1988 time frame. A woman in Chisholm (Anne Seymour), a long-time friend of Graham&#x27;s who wrote his obituary in the newspaper on the day of his death, later tells Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) and author Terrance Mann (James Earl Jones) that Graham had died in 1972. In the time-travel sequence of the movie, lead character Ray Kinsella goes back to the year of Graham&#x27;s death, and is told by &quot;Doc&quot; Graham (Burt Lancaster) that his appearance was on the final day of the season, rather than the middle.

Also from the movie, Graham does not play professional baseball at all after his one appearance in the major leagues. In real life, Graham played three additional seasons in the minor leagues (1906 through 1908) after the one major league game that he played in 1905.

In the film, Graham, played by Whaley, is seen batting right-handed, but he in fact batted left-handed.

<text>Betty&#x27;s Bunch was a television drama/adventure series from New Zealand, produced in 1989. Aimed at a young audience, the story revolved around four foster kids living with Betty. Though things are not always easy financially for the family, they keep the spirit up. Things quickly become more difficult when they attract the attention of the two thieves Arthur and The Charmer. Soon afterwards, Betty is kidnapped and her foster children are forced to search for her, as well as avoid being separated by social services.

The series was repeated on New Zealand afternoon television in 1993 and screened in the UK on Channel Four.

The music and theme tune was performed by Dave McArtney of Hello Sailor.

<doc id="1243401" wikidata="Q2229726" url="?curid=1243401" title="Broccolini">
<text>Broccolini, Aspabroc, baby broccoli or tenderstem broccoli, is a green vegetable similar to broccoli but with smaller florets and longer, thin stalks. It is a hybrid of broccoli and gai lan (which is sometimes referred to as &quot;Chinese kale&quot; or &quot;Chinese broccoli&quot;), both cultivar groups of &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;. In the United States, the name &quot;Broccolini&quot; is a registered trademark of Mann Packing.

== History ==
Broccolini was originally developed over eight years by the Sakata Seed Company of Yokohama, Japan, as a hybrid of broccoli and gai lan, rather than as the product of genetic modification. It was developed to create a milder-tasting vegetable which could grow in hotter climates than broccoli, to expand Sakata&#x27;s broccoli market.

Sakata partnered with Sanbon Incorporated in 1994 to begin growing the product commercially in Mexico under the name Asparation, implying a similarity to asparagus due to its slim, edible stem. After first becoming available in US markets in 1996, in 1998, Sakata began a partnership with Mann Packing Company in Salinas, California, and marketed the product as Broccolini. New forms of Broccolini continue to be developed, including purple broccolini.

== Description ==
Broccolini has a similar structure to sprouting-type broccoli. It grows to , with a slender elongated stem that is long. It is annual or biennial, herbaceous, and glabrous.

== Culinary use==

The entire vegetable (leaves, young stems, unopened flower shoots, and flowers) is edible. Its flavor is sweet, with notes of both broccoli and asparagus, although it is not closely related to the latter.

Common cooking methods include sautéing, steaming, boiling, and stir frying. According to a 2005 study assessing how Australians cooked broccolini, the majority used steaming, with fewer choosing stir-frying, and a small minority ate it raw or in a salad.

=== Nutrition ===
Broccolini is a source of vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin K, folate and glucosinolates.

Broccolini contains a similar profile of phenolic acids to other vegetables in the Brassica family, most notably containing flavonoids. Research into flavonoids in broccolini leaves has suggested they can inhibit the growth of some cancers. Such research has found that common cooking methods reduce broccolini&#x27;s phenolic acid content, particularly boiling.

==Production==

=== Climate ===
Broccolini grows in cool climates and is intolerant of extreme climates. It is more sensitive to cold temperatures than broccoli but less sensitive to hot temperatures.

===Growth and distribution===
Broccolini takes 50–60 days to grow after being transplanted. It is harvested when the heads are fully developed but are not flowering. By cutting off the head, the harvest time is extended as new side shoots of smaller heads will grow. Unlike other cruciferous vegetables, which are harvested once per growth cycle, broccolini is harvested 3 to 5 times in a growth cycle, depending on growing conditions. Further unlike broccoli, the stalk is inedible; rather, the side shoots are harvested and consumed.

After being harvested, the produce is cooled to , preventing the flower heads developing to maintain quality. Shelf life can be further extended with the use of modified atmosphere packaging.

In the US, broccolini is grown in California during the summer and in Arizona during the winter.

===Produce reference===
The International Federation for Produce Standards assigns it the price look-up code 3277, &quot;baby broccoli&quot;. It is also known as &quot;asparation&quot;, &quot;asparations&quot;, &quot;sweet baby broccoli&quot;, &quot;broccoletti&quot;, and &quot;broccolette&quot; &quot;Italian Sprouting broccoli&quot;. It is sold under the registered trademarks Bimi and Tenderstem.

<doc id="1243409" wikidata="Q1773348" url="?curid=1243409" title="Metric Martyrs">
<text>The Metric Martyrs was a British advocacy group who campaigned for the freedom to choose what units of measurement are used by traders. The group believed that vendors should have the freedom to mark their goods with imperial weights and measurements alone. This opposes the current legal position that imperial units may be used so long as metric units are also displayed.

The advocacy group was formed by individuals who had been accused of offences related to selling loose produce using imperial measures, including not displaying metric signage, and for using unstamped weighing machines (which had had their stamps removed by the authorities). Newspapers dubbed the group the &quot;metric martyrs&quot; after Chris Howell, then weights and measures spokesman for the Institute of Trading Standards Administration (today the Trading Standards Institute), said that they could martyr themselves if they wanted to.

==Legal cases==
In 2001 Steve Thoburn, a greengrocer in Sunderland, the main defendant in the original case, was convicted of two offences under the Weights and Measures Act 1985 of using weighing equipment that was not stamped by a Weights and Measures Inspector. The stamps had been obliterated because the scales were not capable of weighing in the metric system as well as imperial, and hence were no longer permitted for commercial use. He was initially convicted and given a six-month conditional discharge. In &quot;Thoburn v Sunderland City Council&quot; the fines were challenged in court; the verdict was in favour of Sunderland City Council, upholding the imposition of the fines. The challenges were made on the grounds that British law does not prohibit the use of imperial units when selling loose goods, but metric units must also be displayed.

The magistrates&#x27; court&#x27;s decision was upheld on appeal by a divisional court. A petition for leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused, as was an application to the European Court of Human Rights (alleging a breach of the right to a fair trial).

Thoburn died of a heart attack in March 2004.

Colin Hunt, who runs a fruit and veg stall in Hackney, was convicted in 2001 of six offences under the Price Marking Order 1999 for failing to display a unit price per kilogram.

John Dove, a fishmonger, and Julian Harman, a greengrocer, were also convicted in Cornwall in 2001 of two offences under the Price Marking Order 1999 of failing to display a unit price per kilogram, and of two offences of using a scale that was only capable of weighing in the imperial system.

Peter Collins, a fruit seller in Sutton who was prosecuted in 2000, was not convicted of any criminal offence. Collins appealed to a Magistrates&#x27; court to have limits on his street trading licence removed. These limits, to which all traders are subject, allowed him to label his goods in imperial quantities only if metric quantities were also displayed no less prominently.

In 2008, Nic Davison was served with an infringement notice for selling draught beer by the litre rather than pints, at his Polish restaurant in Doncaster. Trading Standards officers threatened Davison with prosecution, and called on him to change the glasses used in his restaurant. Davison refused, stating the supremacy of EU law in UK law in matters of weights and measures. The case against him was dropped. Davison had sought the help of then Prime Minister Gordon Brown and of his MP Ed Miliband.

==Pardon campaign==
UK regulations drawn up in response to EEC/EU weights and measures directives had required the use of metric units for certain activities, including sale by weight or measure in the retail trade of certain produce. Prior to 1 January 2000, these regulations applied to most pre-packaged food but on that date, they were extended to cover selling transactions where the product was weighed in front of the customer. The regulations permitted the equivalent imperial unit to be displayed alongside the metric unit as a &quot;supplementary indicator&quot;. In 2007 the European Commission announced that for the cases where metric units were required, it had extended the option to also use imperial units indefinitely. These changes followed from public pressure, and concerns that phasing out dual-labelling would create a trade barrier with the United States, where dual-labelling is required.

In response to the European Commission&#x27;s announcement, there have been calls for a posthumous pardon for Steve Thoburn, who died after having his petition to the European Court of Human Rights denied. Despite an early day motion by Philip Davies MP, the pardon was denied on the grounds that an offence had been committed under the law which was in force at the time. The 2007 EU announcement was not about a change to existing (2001) legal requirements, but rather abandoned plans for a change in 2009. Moreover, the Office for Criminal Justice Reform claimed that even if the law &quot;were&quot; to be changed, there would still be no case for a pardon &quot;as citizens are expected to comply with the law as it is at the time&quot;.

==Regulation and units of measure==
In the original case, several statutes were cited including &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, the Acts of Union 1707 and European Communities Act 1972.

Since medieval times, The Crown has asserted the right to regulate weights and measures in the market place. Even though the barons forced King John to accept &quot;Magna Carta&quot; in 1215, it was issued in the name of the king. Article 35 stated:

Prior to England and Scotland uniting in 1707, each kingdom enforced their own system of weights and measures. Article 17 of the Act of Union ensured that there was a single system of weights and measures across the newly created United Kingdom by requiring that both nations adopted the English system.

The concept of a single system of measures under government control continues. In 2003 the summary of a government report stated:

<text>Fisher is a Canadian comic strip, which ran daily exclusively in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; from 1992 to September 2012. On 8 September 2012, the last strip was published in the Globe after the paper decided to drop the comic as part of a reorganization of the page. After its cancellation it restarted as a web only comic. In May 2013 the first book collection of Fisher strips was published by Nestlings Press in Toronto. Titled &quot;When Tom Met Alison&quot;, it details the courtship of the two leading characters in the strip.

Fisher is drawn by Philip Street and first appeared in the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; on 24 June 1992. The strip&#x27;s central character is Tom Fisher, an advertising copywriter and follows his life and friends. Other notable main characters are Fisher&#x27;s wife Alison, a former art student who currently draws her father&#x27;s comic strip &quot;The Snugglebunnies&quot;, Ruth, a school teacher, and Eugene, a business consultant.

Tom and Alison married in June 2002, and Ruth and Eugene followed suit in August. It was not long after that Tom and Alison moved into a home of their own, and recently they&#x27;ve had a baby, Paul. After the move the comic strip changed focus from the four in the household and shifted it to Alison, Tom, and their new family.

Ruth and Eugene were also trying to have a baby, but ran into some difficulties. As a result, while they are still friends with Alison and Tom, they do not seem to be as close as they used to be. This is possibly due to feelings of jealousy, but it could just be because they now live in different houses. Ruth and Eugene are an interracial couple; Ruth is black and Eugene is white.

Tom&#x27;s established career at Waverly &amp; Mogul came to an abrupt end when J.B. Mogul informed Tom of his dismissal. Tom theorizes he was terminated because he had &quot;lost touch&quot; with today&#x27;s youth.

Recurring characters include Fisher&#x27;s former ad agency boss J. B. Mogul, Fisher&#x27;s sister Marion and her husband Biff, Alison and Tom&#x27;s pets Newcombe (a cat) and Bixby (a sentient robotic personal assistant), a trendy beatnik-type character named Comrade Black and a panhandler/street poet named Homer with whom the characters sometimes interact on the street.

The strip often carries a layer of social commentary. Strips set in Fisher&#x27;s workplace satirize office politics and corporate bureaucracy; strips set in Fisher&#x27;s home lean to relationship humour, with a strong focus on Tom&#x27;s tendency to be introspective. With Paul&#x27;s arrival the wry satirical observations have an added perspective, since baby Paul seems to have wisdom beyond his age.

<text>The National War Museum is a museum dedicated to warfare, which is located inside Edinburgh Castle in Edinburgh, Scotland. Opened in 1933 in a converted 18th-century ordnance storehouse, the museum is run by the National Museums Scotland and covers 400 years of Scotland at war from the 17th century through permanent exhibits and special exhibitions.

It was formerly known as the Scottish United Services Museum, and prior to this, the Scottish Naval and Military Museum.

==Location and description==
The museum is located in the Hospital Square of Edinburgh Castle, within the Old Town area of Edinburgh, Scotland. The building, which has been category-B listed since 1970, comprises two storeys with a ten-bay rectangular-plan. It is managed by National Museums Scotland. Admission to the museum is included in the entry charge for the castle.

The museum&#x27;s collection includes items used by Scotland&#x27;s armed forces over many centuries. These include broadswords from the Scottish Highlands, protection against chemical warfare, and letters sent home from combat by personnel. It also houses a gallery, with works such as &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; by Robert Gibb, and a library.

==History==

Various movements proposing museums dedicated to warfare arose during World War I, and the consensus amongst those involved was that they should be regional in nature. Preliminary ideas for a Scottish museum were drawn up in 1917 by Alexander Ormiston Curle, curator of the National Museum of Scotland, under advice from organisers in London, as well as a civic committee of the Edinburgh council, set up by Lord Provost John Lorne MacLeod. John Stewart-Murray, 8th Duke of Atholl, was also a supporter of the idea. The committee worked through 1918 and 1919 on ideas for the museum, including plans for procuring exhibits. After the end of the war, however, priority was given to the construction of the Scottish National War Memorial, which opened in 1927, and the museum project was put on hold.

The museum project was resurrected in the late 1920s by the Duke of Atholl, utilising a building inside Edinburgh Castle which was built in the 1748 by William Skinner as a storehouse for ordnance. Construction took more than three years, and the museum was opened by Lord High Commissioner John Buchan on 23 May 1933 as the Scottish Naval and Military Museum.

In 1949, recognising the importance of the Air Force to the war effort in World War II, the museum was renamed to the United Services Museum. The museum was refurbished in 2000, and upon reopening was renamed to its present name of the National War Museum.

<text>Joseph Anthony Tainter (born December 8, 1949) is an American anthropologist and historian.

==Biography==
Tainter studied anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley and Northwestern University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1975. he holds a professorship in the Department of Environment and Society at Utah State University. His previous positions include Project Leader of Cultural Heritage Research, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station, Albuquerque, New Mexico and assistant professor of anthropology at the University of New Mexico.

Tainter has written and edited many articles and monographs. His best-known work, &quot;The Collapse of Complex Societies&quot; (1988), examines the collapse of Maya and Chacoan civilizations,
and of the Western Roman Empire, in terms of network theory, energy economics and complexity theory. Tainter argues that sustainability or collapse of societies follow from the success or failure of problem-solving institutions and that societies collapse when their investments in social complexity and their energy subsidies reach a point of diminishing marginal returns. He recognizes collapse when a society involuntarily sheds a significant portion of its complexity.

With Tadeusz Patzek, he is author of &quot;Drilling Down: The Gulf Oil Debacle and Our Energy Dilemma&quot;, published in 2011.

Joseph Tainter is married to Bonnie Bagley and they have one child, Emmet Bagley Tainter.

== Social complexity ==
As described in Tainter&#x27;s &quot;Collapse of Complex Societies&quot;, societies become more complex as they try to solve problems. Social complexity can be recognized by numerous differentiated and specialised social and economic roles and many mechanisms through which they are coordinated, and by reliance on symbolic and abstract communication, and the existence of a class of information producers and analysts who are not involved in primary resource production. Such complexity requires a substantial &quot;energy&quot; subsidy (meaning the consumption of resources, or other forms of wealth).

When a society confronts a &quot;problem,&quot; such as a shortage of energy, or difficulty in gaining access to it, it tends to create new layers of bureaucracy, infrastructure, or social class to address the challenge. Tainter, who first identifies seventeen examples of rapid collapse of societies, applies his model to three case studies: The Western Roman Empire, the Maya civilization, and the Chaco culture.

For example, as Roman agricultural output slowly declined and population increased, per-capita energy availability dropped. The Romans &quot;solved&quot; this problem by conquering their neighbours to appropriate their energy surpluses (as metals, grain, slaves, other materials of value). However, as the Empire grew, the cost of maintaining communications, garrisons, civil government, etc. grew with it. Eventually, this cost grew so great that any new challenges such as invasions and crop failures could not be solved by the acquisition of more territory.

Intense, authoritarian efforts to maintain cohesion by Domitian and Constantine the Great only led to an ever greater strain on the population. The empire was split into two halves, of which the western soon fragmented into smaller units. The eastern half, being wealthier, was able to survive longer, and did not collapse but instead succumbed slowly and piecemeal, because unlike the western empire it had powerful neighbors able to take advantage of its weakness.

It is often assumed that the collapse of the western Roman Empire was a catastrophe for everyone involved. Tainter points out that it can be seen as a very rational preference of individuals at the time, many of whom were actually better off. Tainter notes that in the west, local populations in many cases greeted the barbarians as liberators.

==Diminishing returns==
Tainter begins by categorizing and examining the often inconsistent explanations that have been offered for collapse in the literature. In Tainter&#x27;s view, while invasions, crop failures, disease or environmental degradation may be the &quot;apparent&quot; causes of societal collapse, the ultimate cause is an economic one, inherent in the structure of society rather than in external shocks which may batter them: &quot;diminishing returns on investments in social complexity&quot;. Finally, Tainter musters modern statistics to show that marginal returns on investments in energy (EROEI), education and technological innovation are diminishing today. The globalised modern world is subject to many of the same stresses that brought older societies to ruin.

However, Tainter is not entirely apocalyptic: &quot;When some new input to an economic system is brought on line, whether a technical innovation or an energy subsidy, it will often have the potential at least temporarily to raise marginal productivity&quot;. Thus, barring continual conquest of your neighbors (which is always subject to diminishing returns), innovation that increases productivity is – in the long run – the only way out of the dilemma of declining marginal returns on added investments in complexity.

And, in his final chapters, Tainter discusses why modern societies may not be able to choose to collapse: because surrounding them are other complex societies which will in some way absorb a collapsed region or prevent a general collapse; the Mayan and Chacoan regions had no powerful complex neighbors and so could collapse for centuries or millennia, as could the Western Roman Empire - but the Eastern Roman Empire, bordered as it was by the Parthian/Sassanid Empire, did not have the option of devolving into simpler, smaller entities.

Tainter&#x27;s concept of diminishing marginal returns on complexity, when applied to contemporary societies, has been termed Peak complexity. This term was coined by analogy to concepts such as Peak oil. It implies that &quot;all societies and civilizations have natural limits to complexity and diversity&quot; beyond which they are vulnerable to collapse. He later went on to work with others on a specific element of this process: the diminishing marginal returns on innovation.

His paper &quot;Complexity, Problem Solving, and Sustainable Societies&quot; (1996) focuses on the energy cost of problem solving, and the energy-complexity relation in manmade systems.

<text>Carl Ray Pohlad (August 23, 1915 – January 5, 2009) was an American financier from Minnesota. Pohlad is best known as the owner of the Minnesota Twins baseball franchise from 1984 (succeeding Calvin Griffith) until his death in 2009.

In 2009, Pohlad had an estimated net worth of $3.6 billion, placing him 102nd on the annual Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans.

==Early life and education==
Carl Pohlad was born on August 23, 1915, in Valley Junction, Iowa, to poor parents of Slovak descent, Mary M. (Sodak) and Michael Pohlad. He grew up in West Des Moines, Iowa and graduated from Valley High School in West Des Moines in 1934. He attended and played football for Compton Junior College in Southern California for a short time. Bing Crosby saw him play football and recruited him to play for his alma mater, Gonzaga University in Washington. Pohlad attended Gonzaga but dropped out after the football season of his senior year.

Pohlad was drafted in World War II and served from 1943 to 1946. During his service, he fought in Europe, spending time in France, Germany, and Austria. Pohlad was scheduled to participate in the Normandy Invasion (D-Day), but a case of poison oak kept him out of the invasion&#x27;s early stages. He was wounded in battle, and was awarded the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star Medal.

After the war, Pohlad returned to Iowa and met Mary Eloise O&#x27;Rourke. They married and later moved to Edina, Minnesota. Eloise died in 2003. They had three sons during their 56-year marriage: James, Robert, and William, who all serve as Executive Board Members of the Minnesota Twins.

==Career==

Pohlad got his start in the banking business by foreclosing farms during the Great Depression. After the Depression, he began investing in community banks. Over several decades, he built a banking empire. He bought deposits from The Midwest Federal Savings &amp; Loan after its collapse in 1989. In late 1991 he sold his bank, Marquette Bank, which was owned by the Bank Shares, Inc. holding company, to First Bank System (now US Bank), with the deal finally closing in 1993. In 2006 Forbes ranked him tied for the 107th richest person in the United States, with a net worth of $2.6 billion.

Pohlad became president of the Twin City Rapid Transit (the Minneapolis St. Paul bus and streetcar company), saving it from Fred A. Ossanna (who was convicted in 1960 of illegally taking personal profit from the company). Pohlad was also the Vice President of Pohlad Companies, which owns several companies large and small, including Marquette Financial Companies, United Properties, River Road Entertainment, Stanton Group Holdings, Arcadia Solutions, KTWN FM (96.3 FM) Radio Station (through Northern Lights Broadcasting, a holding company), and JB Hudson&#x27;s Jewelers in the Twin Cities, as well as a controlling interest in PepsiAmericas, the second-largest bottling group in the United States.

===Minnesotan sports===
Pohlad purchased the Minnesota Twins baseball franchise in 1984. The franchise and its predecessor, the original Washington Senators, had been in the hands of the Griffith family since 1919. Calvin Griffith inherited the team from uncle and family patriarch Clark Griffith in 1956 and moved it to the Twin Cities in 1961. Pohlad bought the team for $43.5 million—$32 million for the controlling 52% stake held by Calvin and his sister, Thelma Griffith Haynes, and $11.5 million for minority owner H. Gabriel Murphy&#x27;s 40.4% interest.

The Twins won their first World Series in Minnesota (and the franchise&#x27;s second overall) in 1987, and another World Series in 1991. Pohlad claimed he was close to selling the Twins in 1997 to North Carolina businessman Don Beaver, who would have moved the team to the Piedmont Triad area of the state. The defeat of a referendum for a stadium in that area and a lack of interest in a move to Charlotte killed the deal.

In 2001, he offered to sell the team for a reported $150 million to Major League Baseball as part of a contraction plan by the league, in effect eliminating the Twins. The deal was not completed due to a court order binding the Twins to their lease with the Metrodome, and the team continued to play.

Pohlad also owned a part of the Minnesota Vikings from the mid-1980s to 1991.

==Death==
Pohlad died of natural causes on January 5, 2009, at the age of 93. His funeral was held at the Basilica of Saint Mary, Minneapolis. His son Jim took over day-to-day operations of the Twins organization.

A bronze statue of Pohlad and his wife was installed at Target Field in 2010. It includes a plaque quoting Pohlad: &quot;The great thing about baseball is the way it brings families and a community together. The chance to spend an afternoon with your kids at the ballpark pulling for your team—well, there&#x27;s nothing better!&quot;

<text>Claudette Boyer (January 9, 1938 – February 16, 2013) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. She was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1999 as a Liberal, but was later forced to leave the party as a result of legal difficulties. She retired from politics in 2003.

==Background==
Boyer was born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. She attended the University of Ottawa, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Teacher&#x27;s Certificate. She worked as a teacher for thirty years, and was actively involved in the &quot;Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens&quot; (Franco-Ontarian teachers association), the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Federation and the Canadian Teachers Federation. She and her husband, Jean-Robert Boyer, raised three children, Pierre, Michel and Julie.

==Politics==
In 1982, Boyer was elected as a school trustee for the Ottawa Board of Education. She represented Vanier separate school supporters. She remained as a trustee until 1986 when new legislation created a French language school board in Ottawa. She decided not to run for the new board. Soon after she joined the board of the &quot;l&#x27;Association Canadienne-Francaise de l&#x27;Ontario&quot;.

In 1990 she became the president of the riding association for Ottawa-Vanier. She stayed as president until 1994 when she resigned to compete for the nomination as federal Liberal candidate when Jean-Robert Gauthier resigned to accept a senate appointment. She was narrowly beaten by Mauril Belanger who became the MP in a subsequent by-election. She maintained her ties to the Liberal party as campaign manager for several local politicians including Jean-Robert Gauthier, Bernard Grandmaitre and Guy Cousineau.

In the provincial election of 1999, Boyer was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the redistributed riding of Ottawa—Vanier, successor to Ottawa East. She easily defeated her Progressive Conservative opponent by almost 9,000 votes in what is considered a safe Liberal seat. She became the first Franco-Ontarian woman to be elected to Queen&#x27;s Park. She served as the party&#x27;s critic for Francophone Affairs and Women&#x27;s Issues.

In December 1999, she was charged with obstruction of justice. In August, her husband was involved in an incident where he accidentally backed his car into Denis Grandmaitre, the son of former area MPP Bernard Grandmaître. He suffered a broken leg. An investigation resulted since several versions of the accident were given to police. During the investigation she was asked to step down from her legislative role as critic. It was revealed that Boyer asked three other people to claim they were driving instead of her husband. Her niece agreed to tell this version. In March 2001 Boyer and her husband pleaded guilty to one charge each of obstruction of justice to which they were granted a conditional discharge. As a result of this, Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty suspended her from the caucus. In September 2001, McGuinty said that she would not be allowed back into caucus and that she would have to serve the remainder of her term as an independent. Boyer was bitter about the rejection. She said, &quot;It was very harsh... I made an error of judgment and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I&#x27;m clear. I paid my dues. I cannot accept the way this went.&quot;

In 2003, Boyer put her name forward to be re-nominated as the Liberal candidate but McGuinty intervened and used his executive powers to appoint Madeleine Meilleur as the candidate. Boyer was rueful about the situation. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m not bitter, I&#x27;m not frustrated either. I&#x27;m just sad about what is going on.&quot; Boyer elected not to run as an independent and retired from politics. Meilleur easily won the 2003 election.

==Later life==
In 2004, she was awarded the &quot;Prix anniversaire&quot; by the &quot;Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens&quot; in recognition of her years of service to the community. In 2007 she became the President of the Ottawa chapter of the Francophone Assembly of Ontario. In August 2011 she was hospitalized due to a stroke.

She died at Montfort Hospital in Ottawa in 2013 of an intracranial hemorrhage. She was 75.

<text>In mathematics, the Thom space, Thom complex, or Pontryagin–Thom construction (named after René Thom and Lev Pontryagin) of algebraic topology and differential topology is a topological space associated to a vector bundle, over any paracompact space.

==Construction of the Thom space==

One way to construct this space is as follows. Let

:formula_1

be a rank &quot;n&quot; real vector bundle over the paracompact space &quot;B&quot;. Then for each point &quot;b&quot; in &quot;B&quot;, the fiber formula_2 is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real vector space. We can form an &quot;n&quot;-sphere bundle formula_3 by taking the one-point compactification of each fiber and gluing them together to get the total space. Finally, from the total space formula_4 we obtain the Thom space formula_5 as the quotient of formula_4 by &quot;B&quot;; that is, by identifying all the new points to a single point formula_7, which we take as the basepoint of formula_5. If &quot;B&quot; is compact, then formula_5 is the one-point compactification of &quot;E&quot;.

For example, if &quot;E&quot; is the trivial bundle formula_10, then formula_4 is formula_12 and, writing formula_13 for &quot;B&quot; with a disjoint basepoint, formula_5 is the smash product of formula_13 and formula_16; that is, the &quot;n&quot;-th reduced suspension of formula_13.

Alternatively, since &quot;B&quot; is paracompact, &quot;E&quot; can be given a Euclidean metric and then formula_5 can be defined as the quotient of the unit disk bundle of &quot;E&quot; by the unit formula_19-sphere bundle of &quot;E&quot;.

==The Thom isomorphism==

The significance of this construction begins with the following result, which belongs to the subject of cohomology of fiber bundles. (We have stated the result in terms of formula_20 coefficients to avoid complications arising from orientability; see also Orientation of a vector bundle#Thom space.)

Let formula_21 be a real vector bundle of rank &quot;n&quot;. Then there is an isomorphism called a Thom isomorphism
:formula_22
for all &quot;k&quot; greater than or equal to 0, where the right hand side is reduced cohomology.

This theorem was formulated and proved by René Thom in his famous 1952 thesis.

We can interpret the theorem as a global generalization of the suspension isomorphism on local trivializations, because the Thom space of a trivial bundle on &quot;B&quot; of rank &quot;k&quot; is isomorphic to the &quot;k&quot;th suspension of formula_13, &quot;B&quot; with a disjoint point added (cf. #Construction of the Thom space.) This can be more easily seen in the formulation of the theorem that does not make reference to Thom space:

In concise terms, the last part of the theorem says that &quot;u&quot; freely generates formula_24 as a right formula_25-module. The class &quot;u&quot; is usually called the Thom class of &quot;E&quot;. Since the pullback formula_26 is a ring isomorphism, formula_27 is given by the equation:

:formula_28

In particular, the Thom isomorphism sends the identity element of formula_29 to &quot;u&quot;. Note: for this formula to make sense, &quot;u&quot; is treated as an element of (we drop the ring formula_30)

:formula_31

The standard reference for the Thom isomorphism is the book by Bott and Tu.

==Significance of Thom&#x27;s work==

In his 1952 paper, Thom showed that the Thom class, the Stiefel–Whitney classes, and the Steenrod operations were all related. He used these ideas to prove in the 1954 paper &quot;Quelques propriétés globales des variétés differentiables&quot; that the cobordism groups could be computed as the homotopy groups of certain Thom spaces &quot;MG&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). The proof depends on and is intimately related to the transversality properties of smooth manifolds—see Thom transversality theorem. By reversing this construction, John Milnor and Sergei Novikov (among many others) were able to answer questions about the existence and uniqueness of high-dimensional manifolds: this is now known as surgery theory. In addition, the spaces &quot;MG(n)&quot; fit together to form spectra &quot;MG&quot; now known as Thom spectra, and the cobordism groups are in fact stable. Thom&#x27;s construction thus also unifies differential topology and stable homotopy theory, and is in particular integral to our knowledge of the stable homotopy groups of spheres.

If the Steenrod operations are available, we can use them and the isomorphism of the theorem to construct the Stiefel–Whitney classes. Recall that the Steenrod operations (mod 2) are natural transformations

:formula_32

defined for all nonnegative integers &quot;m&quot;. If formula_33, then formula_34 coincides with the cup square. We can define the &quot;i&quot;th Stiefel–Whitney class formula_35 of the vector bundle formula_21 by:

:formula_37

==Consequences for differentiable manifolds==

If we take the bundle in the above to be the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold, the conclusion of the above is called the Wu formula, and has the following strong consequence: since the Steenrod operations are invariant under homotopy equivalence, we conclude that the Stiefel–Whitney classes of a manifold are as well. This is an extraordinary result that does not generalize to other characteristic classes. There exists a similar famous and difficult result establishing topological invariance for rational Pontryagin classes, due to Sergei Novikov.

==Thom spectrum==

=== Real cobordism ===
There are two ways to think about bordism: one as considering two formula_38-manifolds formula_39 are cobordant if there is an formula_40-manifold with boundary formula_41 such that

:formula_42

Another technique to encode this kind of information is to take an embedding formula_43 and considering the normal bundle

:formula_44

The embedded manifold together with the isomorphism class of the normal bundle actually encodes the same information as the cobordism class formula_45. This can be shown by using a cobordism formula_41 and finding an embedding to some formula_47 which gives a homotopy class of maps to the Thom space formula_48 defined below. Showing the isomorphism of

:formula_49

requires a little more work.

=== Definition of Thom spectrum ===
By definition, the Thom spectrum is a sequence of Thom spaces

:formula_50

where we wrote formula_51 for the universal vector bundle of rank &quot;n&quot;. The sequence forms a spectrum. A theorem of Thom says that formula_52 is the unoriented cobordism ring; the proof of this theorem relies crucially on Thom’s transversality theorem. The lack of transversality requires that alternative methods be found to compute cobordism rings of, say, topological manifolds from Thom spectra.

<doc id="1243455" wikidata="Q241210" url="?curid=1243455" title="Sophonisba">
<text>Sophonisba (in Punic, 𐤑𐤐𐤍𐤁𐤏𐤋 Ṣap̄anbaʿal) (fl. 206 - 203 BC) was a Carthaginian noblewoman who lived during the Second Punic War, and the daughter of Hasdrubal Gisco. She held influence over the Numidian political landscape, convincing king Syphax to change sides during the war, and later, in an act that became legendary, she poisoned herself rather than be humiliated in a Roman triumph.

==Name==
The form of the name Sophonisba is not known until the fifteenth century, in a few late manuscripts of Livy, but it is the better known form because of later literature. She is also called Sophonisbe and Sophoniba. However, her true name might be unclear. Her story is told in Livy (30.12.11–15.11), Diodorus (27.7), Appian (Pun. 27–28), and Cassius Dio (Zonaras 9.11), but Polybius, who had met Masinissa, never refers to Sophonisba by name in his allusions to her (14.4ff.). Nevertheless, it has been proposed that Polybius&#x27; account provides the basis for the Sophonisba story.

== Race ==
As a native Carthaginian woman, Sophonisba&#x27;s race has been the subject of some discussion. Ancient and medieval sources make little reference to her race, focusing instead on the African origins of her husband. Sophonisba herself, in Petrarch&#x27;s later Renaissance telling, is described as blonde-haired, with milky skin. This interpretation is adopted by later authors, like the playwrights Thomas Nabbes and Nathaniel Lee, who conversely emphasize the North African, Berber origins of Masinissa and Syphax.

==Biography==

In 206 BC, Sophonisba had been betrothed to the King Masinissa, a leader of the Massylii or eastern Numidians who served along with Gisco against Rome in Hispania, in order to conclude the diplomatic alliance between Carthage and the Massylii. However, the Carthaginian Senate prohibited the wedding and ordered Sophonisba to marry Syphax, chieftain of the western Masaesyli, who up to that point had been allied to Rome. Cassius Dio suggests that this was because Syphax was considered a better ally, while Appian says that Syphax was in love with Sophonisba and actively pressed for the marriage, harassing Carthage with revolts and threatening attacks alongside Roman forces until they conceded. In any case, Sophonisba married Syphax in 206 BC, turning him into Carthage&#x27;s greatest ally in African terrain. Meanwhile Masinissa, disgruntled by the circumstances, secretly allied himself with Scipio Africanus and returned to his lands. Some believe those accounts might be embellished, as Livy implies Masinissa met her for the first time after the Battle of Cirta, but this is not entirely incompatible with the previous.

Classical chroniclers praise Sophonisba for her virtues and skill. Diodorus Siculus called her &quot;comely in appearance, a woman of many varied moods, and one gifted with the ability to bind men to her service,&quot; while Cassius Dio states she had a high education in music and literature and was &quot;clever, ingratiating, and altogether so charming that the mere sight of her or even the sound of her voice sufficed to vanquish every one, even the most indifferent.&quot; Polybius also emphasizes her youth, calling her a &quot;child&quot; bride, something which Diodorus also mentions. Nevertheless, those traits have led modern historians to consider her a true political agent for Carthage instead of a mere pawn of the war.

Loyal to her city, Sophonisba managed to make Syphax join forces with Hasdrubal and face Scipio and Masinissa in the battles of Utica and the Great Plains, but the Punic forces ended up ultimately defeated. Syphax was then defeated and captured himself in 203 BC in the Battle of Cirta. When Sophonisba fell in Masinissa&#x27;s hands, he freed her and married her, accepting that she had been forced to marry Syphax against her will. However, after hearing claims (confirmed by Gaius Laelius&#x27;s inquiries) that Syphax had acted against Rome under the influence of Sophonisba, Scipio refused to agree to this arrangement, fearing she would turn Masinissa against him as well. He insisted on the immediate surrender of the princess so that she could be taken to Rome and appear in the triumphal parade. On the other hand, Plutarch considers Scipio asked for Sophonisba&#x27;s delivery for safety reasons, fearing Masinissa could torment her in revenge for her marriage to Syphax.

Although Masinissa loved Sophonisba, he agreed to leave her to avoid being declared an enemy to Rome, and went to Sophonisba. He told her that he could not free her from captivity or shield her from Roman wrath, and so he asked her to die like a true Carthaginian princess. With great composure, she drank a cup of poison that he offered her and died, berating Masinissa for making their marriage short and bitter. Afterwards, Masinissa handed Scipio her corpse. His kingdom and Rome remained allied for long after Masinissa&#x27;s death in 148 BC. (Masinissa survived his wife by 55 years.)

==In literature, art and film==

Petrarch elaborated her story in his epic poem &quot;Africa&quot;, published posthumously in 1396.

The playwright John Marston wrote &quot;The Wonder of Women&quot;, a Roman tragedy based on the story of Sophonisba, in 1606 for the Children of the Queen&#x27;s Revels.

There are a number of paintings of Sophonisba drinking her poison, but the subject is often very similar to that of Artemisia II of Caria drinking her husband&#x27;s ashes, and the Rembrandt in the Prado (now known as &quot;Judith at the Banquet of Holofernes&quot;) and a Donato Creti in the National Gallery are examples of works where the intended subject remains uncertain between the two. A 17th century tapestry, showing the meeting of Sophonisba and Masinissa, is preserved from Brussels, following a painting by Rubens.

Sophonisba became the subject of tragedies (and later operas) from the 16th to the 19th centuries, and, along with the story of Cleopatra, furnished more dramas than any other. The first tragedy is credited to the Italian Galeotto Del Carretto (c. 1470–1530) which was written in 1502, but issued posthumously in 1546. The first to appear, however, was Gian Giorgio Trissino&#x27;s play of 1515 which, &quot;in codifying the forms of Italian classical tragedy, helped consign Del Carretto&#x27;s Sofonisba to oblivion.&quot; In France, Trissino&#x27;s version was adapted by Mellin de Saint-Gelais (performed in 1556), and may have served as the primary model for versions by Antoine de Montchrestien (1596) and Nicolas de Montreux (1601). The tragedy by Jean Mairet (1634) is one of the first monuments of French &quot;classicism&quot;, and was followed by a version from Pierre Corneille (1663).

The story of Sophonisba also served as subject for dramatic works by John Marston (1606), David Murray (1610), Nathaniel Lee (1676), Daniel Caspar von Lohenstein (1680), James Thomson (1729), François Joseph Lagrange-Chancel, revised by Voltaire (1770), Vittorio Alfieri (1789), Emanuel Geibel (1869), Jeronim de Rada (1892), (1904), Vasco Graça Moura (1993), and others.

Sophonisba was also the subject of vocal musical works by composers including Henry Purcell (1685), Antonio Caldara (1708), Leonardo Leo (1718), Luca Antonio Predieri (1722), Niccolò Jommelli (1746), Baldassare Galuppi (1747, 1764), Maria Teresa Agnesi (1747-49), Tommaso Traetta (1762), Antonio Boroni (1764), Christoph Gluck (1765), (1766), Christian Gottlob Neefe (1776), António Leal Moreira (1783), Joseph Joaquín Mazuelo (1784), Pietro Alessandro Guglielmi (1802), Marcos Portugal (1803), Ferdinando Paer (1805), Vincenzo Federici (1805), Luigi Petrali (1844), and Dimitrie Cuclin (1945).

Sophonisba also appears in film, first in Giovanni Pastrone&#x27;s 1914 silent film &quot;Cabiria&quot; and again in Carmine Gallone&#x27;s 1937 epic movie &quot;Scipio Africanus: The Defeat of Hannibal&quot;.

Lastly, she appears as an estranged lover of the East Numidian Prince Masinissa married to Syphax against her will in the manga &quot;Ad Astra – Scipio to Hannibal&quot;.

<doc id="1243463" wikidata="Q131267" url="?curid=1243463" title="Sinornithosaurus">
<text>Sinornithosaurus (derived from a combination of Latin and Greek, meaning &#x27;Chinese bird-lizard&#x27;) is a genus of feathered dromaeosaurid dinosaur from the early Cretaceous Period (late Barremian) of the Yixian Formation in what is now China. It was the fifth non–avian feathered dinosaur genus discovered by 1999. The original specimen was collected from the Sihetun locality of western Liaoning. It was found in the Jianshangou beds of the Yixian Formation, dated to 124.5 million years ago. Additional specimens have been found in the younger Dawangzhangzi bed, dating to around 122 million years ago.

Xu Xing described &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; and performed a phylogenetic analysis which demonstrated that it is basal, or primitive, among the dromaeosaurs. He has also demonstrated that features of the skull and shoulder are very similar to &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and other avialans. Together these two facts demonstrate that the earliest dromaeosaurs were more like birds than the later dromaeosaurs were.

&quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; was among the smallest dromaeosaurids, with the holotype measuring long and weighing .

==Description==

Specimens of &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; have preserved impressions of feathers both covering the entirety of the body and forming the wings. These feathers were indistinguishable in form from those found on birds from the same geological deposits. The body (contour) feathers were generally between 3–4.5 cm long and included two types: the first type are formed of several filaments joined into &quot;tufts&quot;, similar to modern down feathers. The second type, including those on the arms, were composed of rows of filaments (&quot;barbs&quot;) joined along a main shaft (&quot;rachis&quot;), making them similar in structure to modern bird feathers. However, unlike the wing feathers of flying birds, they did not have the secondary branches with tiny little hooks (&quot;barbules&quot;) that flight feathers have, which allow the flight feathers to form a continuous vane. Some scientists have suggested that the feathers might have allowed &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; to glide for short distances after leaping from trees.

A 2010 study indicated that &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; may have had feathers which varied in color significantly across different regions of the body, based on analysis of microscopic cell structures in preserved fossils. Based on the rod and spherical melanosomes found in some samples, scientists have interpreted that &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; had black and rufous feathers.

==Paleobiology==

===Possible venomous bite===

In 2009, a team of scientists led by Empu Gong examined a well-preserved &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; skull, and noted several features suggesting it was the first-identified venomous dinosaur. Gong and colleagues noted that the unusually long and fang-like mid-jaw (maxillary) teeth had prominent grooves running down the outer surface, towards the rear of the tooth, a feature seen only in venomous animals. They also interpreted a cavity in the jaw bone just above these teeth as the possible site for the soft-tissue venom gland. Gong and colleagues suggested that these unique features indicated that &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; may have specialized in hunting small prey such as birds, using its long fangs to penetrate feathers and envenomate and stun the prey, like a modern snake. They also suggested that the short, slightly forward-pointing teeth at the tip of the jaw could have been used to strip feathers from birds.

However, in 2010, another team of scientists led by Federico Gianechini published a paper casting doubts on the claim that &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; was venomous. They noted that grooved teeth are not unique to this genus, and in fact grooved teeth are found in many other theropods, including other dromaeosaurids. They also demonstrated that the teeth were not abnormally long as Gong and his team claimed, but rather had come out of their sockets, a preservational artifact common in crushed and flattened fossils. Finally, they could not independently verify the presence of supposed chambers for venom glands cited by Gong&#x27;s team, finding only the normal sinuses of the skull.

In the same journal issue, Gong and his team submitted a reassessment of the 2009 study, casting doubt on their findings. They admitted that grooved teeth were common among theropods (though they suggested they were really only prevalent among feathered maniraptorans), and hypothesized that venom may have been a primitive trait for all archosaurs if not all reptiles, which was retained in certain lineages. They also disputed the claim that the teeth were significantly out of their sockets in the holotype specimen of &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot;, though they admitted that they were not in a completely natural position. Gong&#x27;s reassessment also claimed that certain undescribed specimens had fully articulated teeth showing a similar length. However, these grooved teeth are not direct evidence of venom, as non-venomous species of animals (such as baboons) have similarly grooved teeth.

===Circadian rhythm===
Comparisons between the scleral rings of &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; and modern birds and reptiles indicate that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and night at short intervals.

===Flight/gliding===
The possibility that &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; was capable of gliding has been presented several times, due to its close relation to flying or gliding dromaeosaurs like &quot;Microraptor&quot;. Chatterjee and Templin 2004 found &quot;S. millenii&quot; as grouping within dinosaurs with aerodynamic potential for aerial locomotion, an opinion latter also expressed by Darren Naish, while Longrich &amp; Currie 2009 have expressed that it was probably too heavy to fly, though it is worth to note that this latter study was published before the formal description of &quot;Changyuraptor&quot;, a larger microraptorine with evident flight capacities.

==Classification==

&quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; was a member of the family Dromaeosauridae, a group of agile, predatory dinosaurs with a distinctive sickle-shaped toe claw, which also includes &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and &quot;Utahraptor&quot;. &quot;S. millenii&quot; lived about 125 million years ago in the Barremian age of the Early Cretaceous period, which makes it among the earliest and most primitive dromaeosaurids yet discovered. Fossils of &quot;S. haoiana&quot; and the possible &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; specimen NGMC 91 were found in younger strata dating to about 122 million years ago. The presence of vaned feathers on &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; is consistent with feather evidence from other dromaeosaurs.

Two species of &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; have been described. &quot;S. millenii&quot; (&quot;millennium Chinese bird-lizard&quot;) is the type species, described in 1999. A second species, &quot;S. haoiana&quot; (&quot;Hao&#x27;s Chinese bird-lizard&quot;) was described by Liu &quot;et al.&quot; in 2004 based on a new specimen, D2140, which differed from &quot;S. millenii&quot; in features of the skull and hips. However, according to Turner, Makovicky and Norell (2012) the supposed distinguishing features of &quot;S. haoiana&quot; &quot;are either present in &quot;Sinornithosaurus millenii&quot; or variable among the number of &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; specimens&quot;; the authors considered &quot;S. haoiana&quot; to be a junior synonym of &quot;S. millenii&quot;. In 2024, the new informal combination name &quot;Jeholraptor&quot; &quot;haoiana&quot; was coined by Gregory S. Paul in the third edition of The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs.
An incredibly well-preserved microraptorian nicknamed &quot;Dave&quot; (specimen NGMC 91), was first described in a paper published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; by Ji Qiang and colleagues in 2001. They declined to name the specimen because, although it is completely articulated, almost all of the bones shattered when the fossil slabs were split, so that only the silhouettes of these bones are clear in most of the part and counterpart. This obscured diagnostic skeletal features, which made the specimen&#x27;s genus uncertain. They noted that it was similar in some respects to &quot;Sinornithosaurus millenii&quot;, and they suggested that the differences between the two could have been due to age. Ji, along with another team of scientists, further emphasized this similarity in a 2002 paper, in which they formally referred the specimen to &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot;, though they considered the exact species questionable. Meanwhile, Stephen Czerkas and colleagues considered the specimen to represent an example of their newly described species &quot;Cryptovolans pauli&quot; (now usually considered a synonym of &quot;Microraptor gui&quot;), based on supposed wing proportions.

Phylogenetic studies did not support the idea that NGMC 91 was a close relative of &quot;S. millenii&quot;. In a 2004 analysis, Phil Senter and colleagues found that it was, in fact, more closely related to &quot;Microraptor&quot;. Subsequent studies, also by Senter, have continued to show support for this finding despite the fact that some data used in the original study was later found to be flawed.

However, in a 2011 publication Senter stated that a personal examination of the holotype of &quot;S. millenii&quot; led him to conclude that his earlier separation of NGMC 91 from &quot;S. millenii&quot; was based on anatomical misinterpretations. As the two specimens were &quot;identical in all character states&quot; used in his phylogenetic analysis, were from similar stratigraphic levels and &quot;uniquely share the presence of a triangular coracoid with a large, oval foramen&quot;, Senter concluded that NGMC 91 does belong to the species &quot;Sinornithosaurus millenii&quot;.

The same conclusion was also reached independently from Senter by Turner, Makovicky and Norell (2012). According to these authors, NGMC 91 shares several apomorphies with both &quot;Microraptor zhaoianus&quot; and &quot;Sinornithosaurus millenii&quot;; however, as it &quot;lacks elongate middle caudals that are three to four times the length of the dorsal vertebrae&quot;, it cannot be referred to &quot;M. zhaoianus&quot;. On the other hand, it does possess a posteriorly bifurcated dentary, which is an apomorphy of &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot;. The authors concluded that NGMC 91 was a subadult specimen of &quot;S. millenii&quot;.

==Discovery and specimens==

&quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; was discovered by Xu Xing, Wang Xiaolin and Wu Xiaochun of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of Beijing. An almost-complete fossil with feather impressions, was recovered from Liaoning Province, China, in the Yixian Formation; the same incredibly rich location where four dinosaurs with feathers were discovered previously, &quot;Protarchaeopteryx&quot;, &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, &quot;Caudipteryx&quot;, and &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;. &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; was the first dromaeosaurid discovered with feathers. The holotype specimen is IVPP V12811, in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China.

The NGMC 91 specimen is in the collection of the National Geological Museum of China. It was collected in Fanzhangzi quarry, near Lingyuan City, Liaoning Province. This location is part of the Dawangzhangzi fossil beds, which have been dated to about 122 million years ago, during the early Aptian age. A specimen of the fish &quot;Lycoptera&quot; is also preserved near the foot.

<doc id="1243465" wikidata="Q391341" url="?curid=1243465" title="Andy Slaughter">
<text>Andrew Francis Slaughter (born 29 September 1960) is a British Labour Party politician who is currently serving as Member of Parliament (MP) for Hammersmith and Chiswick, and before that, Hammersmith and Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, since 2005. Prior to his election to Parliament, he had served as Leader of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham Council.

In the 2024 general election, Slaughter stood in the new seat of Hammersmith and Chiswick.

==Early life and education==
Slaughter was born on 29 September 1960. He studied at the University of Exeter, College of Law, and the Inns of Court School of Law.

==Legal career==
Slaughter was called to the bar at Middle Temple in 1993, thereby qualifying to practice as a barrister. He was a barrister with Bridewell Chambers from 1993 to 2006, before joining Lamb Chambers in 2006.

==Parliamentary career==
He stood at the Uxbridge by-election in July 1997, following the unexpected death seven days after the 1997 general election of incumbent Sir Michael Shersby. The seat, which had a small Conservative majority, was held for the Conservatives by John Randall.

At the 2005 general election, Slaughter was elected as the member of parliament for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush in London, retaining the seat for Labour following the retirement of his predecessor, Clive Soley.

Slaughter is currently a member of the Justice Select Committee. He was a member of the Communities and Local Government Select Committee in 2009–10 and in 2010 of the London Regional Select Committee and Joint Committee on Human Rights. Previously he was member of the Regulatory Reform Select Committee (2005–07) and Children, Schools and Families Select Committee (2007–09).

Slaughter&#x27;s interests include the Middle East and particularly Palestine. He is Secretary of the Britain-Palestine All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) and Vice-Chair of Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East. His interests are reflected in the other APPGs of which he is a member, including Democracy and Human Rights in the Gulf, Fire Safety and Rescue, Gypsies, Travellers and Roma, Heathrow, and Legal Aid.

He has spoken in the House of Commons on fire safety, housing, legal aid, local government, education and climate change issues.

Slaughter has campaigned against Heathrow expansion. He also played a part in successful local campaigns against the planned demolition of social housing by the Conservative Council in his constituency and the planned demolition of Charing Cross Hospital.

The Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush constituency underwent a boundary change for the 2010 general election, and on 30 November 2006, the new Hammersmith Constituency Labour Party selected Slaughter as the Labour candidate for the new Hammersmith seat which he won in the 2010 general election with an increased majority.

===In government===
He was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Stephen Ladyman MP, Minister of State for the Department for Transport and served from November 2005 to June 2007. In June 2007, he was appointed PPS to Lord Malloch-Brown, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and also served as PPS to Lord Digby Jones, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and between July 2007 and October 2008.

On 27 January 2009, he resigned his PPS role as he opposed the Government&#x27;s plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport.

===In opposition===
In October 2010, Slaughter was invited to join the Labour frontbench as Shadow Justice Minister with responsibility for courts and tribunals, criminal law, freedom of information, the legal profession, civil justice reform and Legal Aid. Slaughter served as the lead shadow minister opposing the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 and the Justice and Security Act 2012. He resigned in June 2016, citing concerns over Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership. He supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election.

Slaughter was appointed as Shadow Minister for Housing in October 2016, however he was sacked from the frontbench in June 2017 after he voted in favour of an amendment to the Queen&#x27;s Speech which called on the UK to remain in the European Single Market, in defiance of the Labour whip.

In the November 2021 British shadow cabinet reshuffle, he became the new Shadow Solicitor General.

On 15 November 2023, Slaughter voted for an SNP amendment to the King&#x27;s Speech, demanding an immediate Ceasefire in Gaza, contrary to the Labour Party&#x27;s official stance to support HM Government line on the Gaza war. He was dismissed by Sir Keir Starmer from his position as Shadow Solicitor General.

<text>Twenty Minutes of Love is a 1914 American silent comedy film made by Keystone Studios. The film is widely reported as Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s directorial debut; some sources name Joseph Maddern as the director, but generally credit Chaplin as the creative force.

==Reviews==
The reviewer for &quot;Bioscope&quot; wrote, &quot;Here Chaplin plays the role of the undesired but persistent suitor. The comic element is given special prominence and is quite safe in the hands of this well known comedian.&quot;

A reviewer from &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Plenty of the comic element is introduced and the person who does not laugh at the peculiar antics of Chas. Chaplin--well, must be hard to please.&quot;

==Plot==
Set in modern-day Japan, the series centers on 13-year-old extrovert , who uses astrology to solve crimes, and manages her missing mother&#x27;s fortune-telling business on the side. Her childhood friend, , assists her, after he returns from the United States, where he studied criminal psychology. As Detective Spica, Lili uses the magical star ring, left to her by her missing mother, to aid her in solving crimes by consulting with one of the twelve astral spirits in the ring and learning the victim&#x27;s horoscope. Her father, , disapproves of her actions. Periodically, she encounters rival private investigator , who tests her mystery-solving skills. 

While solving cases, Lili eventually learns from Hiromi&#x27;s elder sister, , that Hiromi&#x27;s allergy to girls resulted from her: ten years ago, he waited in the rain for Lili to show after he left her a love letter. Lili encounters , a fortuneteller and hypnotist who kidnaps her father. After Hiromi rescues him, Zeus takes Hiromi captive and demands the star ring in exchange. Realizing that Sirius is her missing mother, Lili frees her from Zeus&#x27;s hypnosis. Lili learns that her mother disappeared to protect her family from Zeus, who hates Sirius, as he believes that she kidnapped his girlfriend and caused her to become comatose. Lili uncovers the truth: his girlfriend feared that he desired the star ring more than her love and asked Sirius to stage a kidnapping and have him decide between her or the star ring. When he hesitated, she was devastated and threw herself off the cliff. After learning this, Zeus loses his desire for the star ring and lets Lili, Hiromi, and Lili&#x27;s mother leave. Lili accepts Hiromi&#x27;s love for her. In the conclusion, Lili&#x27;s mother takes over her fortune-telling business, and Lili continues to solve crimes with Hiromi&#x27;s assistance.

==Development==
Manga artist Natsumi Ando enjoyed astrology in her childhood and had a fondness for stars and Greek mythology. For File 2, which deals with a mystery in a piano school, Ando researched a local music school. The design for the Libra astral spirit originated from the winner of the Astral Spirit Design Contest; many of the design submissions were for the Libra, Pisces, and Cancer spirits.

Ando included references to Greek mythology in &quot;Zodiac P.I.&quot; in the names of the astral spirits. The astral spirit of Virgo, Demeter, takes her name from the goddess of the harvest, while the astral spirit for Capricorn, Parn, is a reference to the god Pan. Astrea, the astral spirit for Libra, is named after the goddess of justice. The twin astral spirits for Gemini take their names from twin brothers Castor and Pollux. The centaur Chiron is alluded to in the name of the astral spirit for Sagittarius.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando, Natsumi 2003 https://archive.org/details/zodiacpi03ando/page/39 39&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The name of astral spirit for Taurus is a reference to the woman Io. The astral spirit for Pisces and the spirit for Aquarius take their names from the goddess of love and Ganymede, respectively. Other references include stars. Ando named Antares, the astral spirit of Scorpio, Praesepe, the astral spirit of Cancer, and 
Regulus, the astral spirit of Leo, after the Antares, Praesepe and Regulus stars, respectively. Aries is the only astral spirit that named after the zodiac itself.

==Release==
Written and illustrated by Natsumi Ando, &quot;Zodiac P.I.&quot; appeared as a serial in the monthly manga magazine &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from the April 2001 issue to the January 2003 issue. It published the series in four bound volumes from November 6, 2001, to March 4, 2003.

In North America, Tokyopop licensed the series for an English-language translation.

In his review of the second volume, Anime News Network&#x27;s Allen Divers described the series as similar to &quot;Detective Conan&quot; and wrote that despite the predictable endings, the series was potentially enjoyable for readers interested in astrology and mysteries.

<text>Mockingbird Don&#x27;t Sing is a 2001 American independent film based on the true story of Genie, a modern-day feral child. The film is told from the point of view of Susan Curtiss (whose fictitious name is Sandra Tannen), a professor of linguistics at University of California, Los Angeles. Although the film is based on a true story, all of the names are fictitious for legal reasons (e.g. the pseudonym &quot;Genie&quot; has been changed to &quot;Katie&quot;). The film was released to US theaters on May 4, 2001. It won first prize for best screenplay at the Rhode Island International Film Festival (tied with &quot;Wings of Hope&quot;).

==Plot==

In Los Angeles, 1970, Katie Standon, a girl who has been imprisoned in her room (and without any human contact) since the age of one, is now thirteen years old. Her mother Louise, who has cataracts, has taken enough abuse from her domineering husband Wes; she gets her son, Billy, a few years older than Katie, to help her and Katie escape their home.

At a welfare office a social worker notices something peculiar about Katie and guesses her age to be about seven while, in fact, she is thirteen. Katie is taken to Children&#x27;s Hospital, and Louise and Wes find themselves being arrested for &quot;what authorities are calling the worst case of child abuse they&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. Shortly before his trial begins, Wes kills himself. The doctors and psycholinguists investigating the case form the &quot;Katie Team&quot;, a group of experts dedicated to helping Katie learn to speak and interact with others. One of the team members, Judy Bingham, a special education teacher, sees Katie as a pawn whom she can use to attain international fame. She claims Katie will make her &quot;the next Anne Sullivan.&quot; University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) graduate student Sandra Tannen is one of the people who appear to have Katie&#x27;s welfare at heart. 
Katie comes to live with Dr. Norman Glazer who works at Children&#x27;s Hospital, and his family, where she stays for four years. His family helps Katie become a civilized human being. Although Katie shows outstanding progress in some things (such as learning vocabulary words and sign language, preparing hygiene, showing off anger, and certain other activities), she never really learns grammatical structure. Meanwhile, Louise has surgery to remove her cataracts and visits Katie off and on.

When Katie turns eighteen, the funding for her help is cut off and she returns to Louise&#x27;s care. Soon, it comes to the point where Louise does not know how to handle Katie herself and Katie gets placed in another foster home. One day, Katie is physically abused for vomiting and responds by never eating or speaking because she was afraid if she opened her mouth she would vomit again and face more abuse.

Sandra does all that she can to make sure that Katie is handled in the proper way and even has Norman help her. Katie is taken back to Children&#x27;s Hospital, and Sandra is suggested by social services to have Katie live with her. Before any decisions are made about this, Louise takes Katie out of the hospital and puts her in another foster home. Sandra is not allowed to say goodbye to Katie. Louise even threatens to take legal action on Sandra if she ever sees Katie again.

Sandra finally asks Louise why Katie was placed in extreme isolation before her discovery. Louise tells the entire story; Wes loved his mother very much, and when she died due to an accident, he projected his feelings for her onto Katie. After a doctor examined Katie sometime later, she was diagnosed as intellectually disabled and Wes locked her up, afraid that the doctors might take her away, and because Louise was starting to go blind, Wes took care of Katie.

Sandra then leaves the house, running into Judy again. It is now clear that she knew Louise for a long time. Sandra and Judy have a quick argument, after which Judy enters Louise&#x27;s house, leaving Sandra crying. At this point, different kinds of footage of Katie appear on screen; Sandra looks at tape recordings of Katie on her TV. She then is seen writing something on a typewriter, while her voice addresses the viewers; she&#x27;s hoping to see Katie once more. The camera then turns to her and her boyfriend, now holding a baby of their own. The screen fades while she sings the &quot;Hush, Little Baby&quot; lullaby. The screen fades, and footage of Katie on the beach can be seen.

Messages appear, saying what has happened to everyone after the movie: Judy continues to harass the &quot;Katie Team&quot; until her death in 1988; Louise, who is now once again blind, resides in a nursing home in Southern California; Sandra Tannen is now a professor of linguistics at UCLA and has two teenage daughters, however, she is still not allowed to have any contact with Katie, who lives in a foster home nearby. The last message before the screen turns black and the credits appear, reads: &quot;Katie&#x27;s inability to learn a language proved the legitimacy of the Critical Period Hypothesis&quot;.

<text>Rachel Claire Paiement (born 1955) is a Canadian musician and songwriter. She is best known as a former member, singer and songwriter for the Franco-Ontarian band CANO in the 1970s. She also appeared as a guest musician on albums by Bruce Cockburn, Michel Rivard, Paul Hyde and many more. She appeared in theatre productions for the Théâtre du Nouvel-Ontario and worked as a session singer in Vancouver for many years.

Paiement left CANO in 1980 to join their producer, Jim Vallance, in Vancouver, later marrying him. Vallance is best known as the longtime songwriting partner of Bryan Adams and has also worked as music industry songwriter for many other artists. Vallance and David Foster primarily wrote the charity song &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot; in 1985 to which Paiement wrote the French verse.

==Personal life==
She and Vallance have a son, Jimmy, born in 1989, who became a member of music duo Bob Moses. Paiement has chosen not to maintain an active music career; when CANO reunited at the 2010 La Nuit sur l&#x27;étang festival in Sudbury, her sister Monique appeared as the band&#x27;s female vocalist.

<text>The Országos Középiskolai Tanulmányi Verseny (OKTV) in Hungarian (rough translation: &quot;National Secondary School Academic Competition&quot;) is the most famous high level academic competition for secondary-school students in Hungary (after qualification for Olympiads), whose winners are usually selected for International Student Olympiads, and they often receive gold medals or become Overall Winners. Students 15–18 years old (grades 9–12) compete in the OKTV in various subjects, such as the natural sciences, IT, mathematics, history, philosophy, Hungarian literature and foreign languages. The top competitors receive additional points in the university admissions system. As the number of additional points that one can obtain are capped at 100 and they can be obtained using far less competitive methods, this usually does not advantage the top-performers in the admissions process.

The OKTV has been broadcast on the Australian Christian Channel in Australia.

The competition requirements are increasingly higher than IB&#x27;s or Hungarian Matura&#x27;s, also known as érettségi (vizsga), because the solution of these tasks need not only eminent knowledge of facts, but also creativity.

Students in 10th or 11th grade who were granted exemption from taking entrance exams were eligible for a scholarship in one of the United World Colleges. However, , these scholarships are open for other applicants, the grade requirements remaining the same.</text><links>

<doc id="1243492" wikidata="Q1641970" url="?curid=1243492" title="John R. Wooden Award">
<text>The John R. Wooden Award is an award given annually to the most outstanding men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s college basketball players. The program consists of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Player of the Year awards, the Legends of Coaching award, and recognizing the All-America Teams.

The awards, given by the Los Angeles Athletic Club, are named in honor of John Wooden, the 1932 national collegiate basketball player of the year from Purdue. Wooden later taught and coached men&#x27;s basketball at Indiana State and UCLA. Coach Wooden, whose teams at UCLA won ten NCAA championships, was the first man to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a player and coach. His 1948 Indiana State team was the NAIB (now NAIA) National Finalist.

The award, which was originally given only to male athletes, was first given in 1977. Starting in 2004, the award was extended to women&#x27;s basketball. Additionally, the Legends of Coaching Award was presented first in 1999.

==Selection process==

===Men&#x27;s award===
Each year, the Award&#x27;s National Advisory Board, a 26-member panel, selects approximately 20 candidates for Player of the Year and All-American Team honors. The candidates must be full-time students and have a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 or higher throughout their college career. Players who are nominated must have made outstanding contributions to team play, both offensively and defensively, and be model citizens, exhibiting strength of character both on and off the court.

The selection ballot is announced prior to the NCAA basketball tournament. The voters consist of 1,000 sportswriters and sportscasters representing the 50 states.

The top ten vote-getters are selected to the All-American Team, and the results are announced following the Elite Eight round of the NCAA Tournament. The person who receives the most votes is named the Player of the Year, and the winner is announced following the NCAA championship game.

The Player of the Year is awarded a trophy consisting of five bronze figures. The player&#x27;s school receives a duplicate trophy as well as a scholarship grant. The other top four members of the All-American Team receive an All-American Team trophy, a jacket, and a scholarship grant which goes to their school. Each coach of the top five All-American Team members also receives a jacket. The All-American Team members ranked six through ten receive an All-American Team trophy and a jacket, but their schools do not receive a scholarship.

===Women&#x27;s award===
The criteria for the women&#x27;s Player of the Year award and All-American Team honors are similar to those for the men. For the women&#x27;s award, the National Advisory Board consists of 12 members, and approximately 15 candidates are selected for the ballot. The voters are 250 sportswriters and sportscasters.

In contrast to the men&#x27;s All-American Team, only five members are selected for the women&#x27;s team. The Player of the Year receives a trophy, and her school receives a duplicate trophy and a scholarship grant.

==The trophy==

The trophy features five bronze figures, each depicting one of the five major skills that Wooden believed that &quot;total&quot; basketball player must exhibit: rebounding, passing, shooting, dribbling, and defense.

The concept for the trophy originated with Wooden Award Chairman, Richard &quot;Duke&quot; Llewellyn. Work began on the trophy in 1975, and sculptor Don Winton, who had sculpted many top sports awards, was given the task of designing the model of the trophy.

The figures are bronze plated and attached to a pentagonal base plate. The tallest figure is 10 inches high (26 cm). The trophy&#x27;s base is 7 inches high (19 cm), and is made from solid walnut. The total height of the trophy is , and it weighs .

==Wooden Award winners==

==Trademark dispute==
The Wooden family announced in August 2005 that he would no longer participate because of a trademark dispute concerning the use of his name. However, he never contested the use of his name prior to his death in 2010, and the award continues to bear his name. “I don’t want anything to interfere with the continuation of the award,” (Wooden) told &quot;The Associated Press&quot; at the time.
In 2011 the Wooden Family began participation. Coach John Wooden&#x27;s son, Jim, presented the Wooden Award to Brigham Young senior Jimmer Fredette. In 2012 John Wooden&#x27;s grandson, Greg, on behalf of The Los Angeles Athletic Club, presented the Wooden Award to University of Kentucky freshman Anthony Davis. Greg Wooden made the announcement on ESPN College GameDay.

==High School Player of the Year Award==
The John R. Wooden High School Player of the Year awards are given to the most valuable player in each of the five divisions of the California Interscholastic Federation Southern Section, and one Los Angeles City division.

==Legends of Coaching Award==
The Legends of Coaching Award recognizes the lifetime achievement of coaches who exemplify Coach Wooden&#x27;s high standards of coaching success and personal achievement. When selecting the individual, the Wooden Award Committee considers a coach&#x27;s character, success rate on the court, graduating rate of student athletes, his or her coaching philosophy, and identification with the goals of the John R. Wooden Award.

All listed honorees coached in the men&#x27;s game unless otherwise noted. The first recipient who was never a head coach in NCAA Division I was 2021 recipient Dave Yanai, whose entire head coaching career was in NCAA Division II.

<text>&quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot; is a 1985 charity single recorded by a supergroup of Canadian artists, under the name Northern Lights, to raise funds for relief of the 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia. It was one of a number of such supergroup singles recorded between December 1984 and April 1985, along with Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in the United Kingdom, USA for Africa&#x27;s &quot;We Are the World&quot; in the United States, &quot;Cantaré, cantarás&quot; by a supergroup of Latin American and Spanish singers, Chanteurs sans Frontières&#x27;s &quot;Éthiopie&quot; in France, and Fondation Québec-Afrique&#x27;s &quot;Les Yeux de la faim&quot; in Quebec.

Although recorded independently of the USA for Africa project, it was included on the full-length &quot;We Are the World&quot; album.

The project was organized by Bruce Allen, who brought together a large group of artists to record a song written by David Foster, Jim Vallance, Bryan Adams, Rachel Paiement, Paul Hyde and Bob Rock. Foster and Vallance wrote the music and initial lyrics, Adams completed the English lyrics, Paiement wrote the one French verse, Rock &amp; Hyde contributed the song title. The song was recorded on February 10, 1985 at Manta Sound studios in Toronto.

Foster revealed the melody of the song was originally offered to filmmaker Joel Schumacher as incidental music for his film &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;. Schumacher reported hated it but was later, in Foster&#x27;s words, &quot;really pissed&quot; when it showed up later as a charity single.

The song was issued as the album&#x27;s second and final single by Columbia Records on May 1, 1985, and quickly reached number one on the Canadian Top 40 chart. It also finished number one on the year-end Canadian charts for that year. The song&#x27;s video also received extensive airplay on MuchMusic.

The vocals were recorded at Manta Sound Studios in downtown Toronto on Sunday, February 10, 1985. Gordon Lightfoot drove himself to the recording in a pick-up truck. Neil Young and Joni Mitchell arrived together in a taxi. Mark Holmes of Platinum Blonde arrived in a white stretch limousine.

Bryan Adams performed a live version of &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot; on July 13, 1985 during his Live Aid performance in Philadelphia.

On December 22, 1985, CBC Television aired a 90-minute documentary by John Zaritsky on the song and its creation. A CBC reporter, Brian Stewart, had been the first Western journalist to bring the famine in Ethiopia to worldwide attention. The film was a Genie Award nominee for Best Documentary Film at the 7th Genie Awards in 1986.

By 1990, the project had raised $3.2 million for famine relief projects in Africa. Ten percent of the funds raised was set aside to assist Canadian food banks.

==Recording process==
Bruce Cockburn could not participate in the Toronto recording session, due to performing in Germany at that time. Producer Jim Vallance flew to Germany to record audio and video of Bruce performing his line in the song, which were eventually edited into the song and music video respectively.

Joni Mitchell later spoke to writer Iain Blair about the recording experience: &quot;I know it sounds ridiculous, but I was literally starving when we did the session &#x27;cause my yoga teacher had sent me to a psychic dietician who, while rubbing her chin and swinging her arm around in a circle, had diagnosed a lot of food allergies. The result was, predictably, that I was hardly allowed to eat anything, so by the time I arrived with an apple and a rice patty, my poor stomach was making all these strange noises. Then we get in the studio, and the engineer says he can&#x27;t record &#x27;cause he&#x27;s picking up some weird rumbling sound coming from my direction. (She laughed.) And it was all pretty ironic, considering the subject matter!&quot;

At one point during the recording process, Foster also had Neil Young re-record his line after singing the word &quot;innocence&quot; flat, to which Young famously quipped, &quot;That&#x27;s my sound, man.&quot;

==Artists not appearing==

* Buffy Sainte-Marie - According to journalist Terry David Mulligan, Sainte-Marie was supposed to be part of the project but did not show up to recording sessions. As a result, the term &quot;Buffy bailed&quot; became an expression in certain Canadian music circles.
* Leonard Cohen - Because Cohen performed the day before the recording session in Copenhagen, Denmark, he would have been unable to appear on the recording.
* Rik Emmett - The Triumph (band) frontman was on tour in the United States at the time &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot; was recorded. Triumph played a show at the Beaumont Civic Center in Beaumont, Texas that day. Emmett says he was invited and would have loved to be part of the recording but scheduling wouldn&#x27;t allow and recording verses remotely wasn&#x27;t an option.
* Randy Bachman - On the Toronto Mike&#x27;d podcast, Bachman revealed he was never asked to appear on the recording.
* Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors - The recording of &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot; overlapped with Connors&#x27; self-imposed retirement, a move meant to protest the lack of support given to Canadian stories by the policies of the Federal government. Therefore, Connors was unable to attend the sessions.

==Video==

The song&#x27;s video opens with footage from Brian Stewart&#x27;s original CBC News report on the famine, and then cuts to the performers singing the song in a studio. Near the end of the video, footage also appears from the 1985 NHL All-Star Game in Calgary, depicting the Campbell Conference All-Stars and the Wales Conference All-Stars — including Wayne Gretzky, Grant Fuhr, Jari Kurri and Miroslav Frycer — singing along as the audience waves flags and banners in the air.

==2022 live version==

A live version of &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot; was performed at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame gala in Toronto on September 24, 2022. The rendition included many original Northern Lights members including soloists Hart, Hill, and Cockburn plus new Canadian talent such as Alessia Cara and Charlotte Cardin.

<doc id="1243511" wikidata="Q3091714" url="?curid=1243511" title="Léonce Verny">
<text>François Léonce Verny, (2 December 1837 – 2 May 1908) was a French officer and naval engineer who directed the construction of the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Japan, as well as many related modern infrastructure projects from 1865 to 1876, thus helping jump-start Japan&#x27;s modernization.

==Early life==
Léonce Verny was born in Aubenas, Ardèche. He studied at Lyon and then went on to the prestigious École Polytechnique in 1856. He entered the Institute for Applied Maritime Science at Cherbourg in 1858, where he became a Naval Engineer. He worked for the French state in the arsenals of Brest and Toulon.

==China mission==
Verny was sent to Ningbo and Shanghai in China from 1862 to 1864, to supervise the construction of four gunboats for the Chinese Navy, as well as a new shipyard. During that time, he was also French Vice-Consul in Ningbo.

==Career in Japan==
Japan had started a modernization effort in 1853 and the Tokugawa government decided to build a modern naval shipyard and arsenal in collaboration with the French government. Verny was persuaded to go to Japan by his distant relative, French ambassador Léon Roches in September 1865, who negotiated the substantial annual salary of $10,000. He stayed on after the Meiji Restoration overthrew the Tokugawa government, continuing to work for the new Meiji government for a total of 12 years, returning home to France on 13 March 1876.

===Yokosuka arsenal===

Verny was appointed chief administrator and constructor of the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in 1865. Yokosuka was chosen because it was a well protected inlet, in close proximity to Yokohama and Tokyo. The same year, he briefly returned to France to purchase all necessary machinery and recruit French naval experts from Brest, Toulon, and Cherbourg (45 families in all) to help organize the construction of the arsenal. During the months in France, Verny also helped in the negotiations for the first French military mission to Japan, consisting of military advisors under Jules Brunet to help train and re-equip the Tokugawa army from 1867, and to assist it in the Boshin War against the Satchō Alliance.

In Yokosuka, Verny trained 65 Japanese technicians and hired 2500 workers. The construction of the shipyard itself was only the central point of a major infrastructure development project, which encompassed foundries, brick kilns, gunpowder and weapons factories, an aqueduct and hydraulic power facilities, modern buildings and technical schools to train Japanese technicians were established.

The Yokosuka Naval Arsenal completed its first warship, the &quot;Yokosuka-maru&quot; in November 1866, but the planned two repair yards, three shipyards and iron works were not completed by the time of the Meiji Restoration. Initial fears that the pro-&quot;Bakufu&quot; French engineers would be replaced by British engineers were soon proven groundless, and Yokosuka continued to employ on French engineers until 1878. 
&lt;br&gt;
===Lighthouses===
In addition to the construction of the Yokosuka Arsenal, Verny also built four lighthouses in the Tokyo area, some of which still exist, such as the Jōgashima Lighthouse, the Kannonzaki Lighthouse and the Nojimazaki Lighthouse. He also built the Shinagawa Lighthouse.

Léonce Verny also managed the building of the shipyard at Nagasaki, the largest in the Far East at that time. In Kobe, he built a metallurgical plant, as well as a patent slip.

Verny experienced numerous problems during his tenure in Japan, as the expectations of the Japanese government and military were very high, but funding was very limited, and Verny had to create much of the necessary infrastructure from scratch. When visited by the French construction director of the Chinese Fuzhou arsenal in 1871, Verny noted that the Chinese budget was three times larger than his.

Verny returned to France in 1876, when the Japanese were able to take full control of the operations.

==Later life==
Upon his return to France, Verny went to work at one of the largest mining companies in France (Compagnie des houllières de Firminy) at Firminy in Roche-la-Molière in January 1877 and rose to the position of director in September 1895. He then served on the Board of Trade of Saint-Étienne (1881–1900) of which he was secretary from 1883 to 1896. He was subsequently awarded the Legion of Honour.

Verny died on 2 May 1908 in his home in Pont d&#x27;Aubenas.

==Legacy==

Yokosuka became one of the main arsenals of the Imperial Japanese Navy into the 20th century, in which were built battleships such as , and aircraft carriers such as and .

Léonce Verny is remembered in Japan as a symbol of modernization and of friendship with France. A park has been built in his name (&quot;Verny Park&quot;) on the seafront at Yokosuka, with a bronze bust of Verny, and a small museum. The &quot;Verny Commemorative Museum&quot; is located near the site of the former Yokosuka Naval Arsenal.

The dry docks built by Verny are still intact and are currently used by the US Navy as part of the United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka.
