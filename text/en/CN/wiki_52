<text>Subirrigation also known as seepage irrigation, is a method of irrigation where water is delivered to the plant root zone. The excess may be collected for reuse.

Subirrigation is used in growing field crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and sugar cane in areas with high water tables such as Florida and in commercial greenhouse operations.

Three basic types of subirrigation system are in general use for potted plants in greenhouses: ebb-and-flow (bench-mounted enclosures holding pots are filled and then drained); trough (water is flowed through bench-mounted, slightly sloping enclosures containing pots); and flooded floor (special sloped concrete flooring is flooded and drained).

Greenhouse subirrigation has been growing in popularity since the 1990s. Advantages are water and nutrient conservation, and labor-saving. The outfitting cost is relatively high. Potential problems, such as the possibility of increased presence of disease in recycle water, have only begun to be investigated.

One of the disadvantages of sub-irrigated closed systems, such like Earth Boxes and sub-irrigated planters, is that soluble salts cannot be flushed into the lower soil profile and build up over time.

<doc id="1247551" wikidata="Q5149835" url="?curid=1247551" title="Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility">
<text>The Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (CSBF), established in
1961 and formerly known as the National Scientific Balloon Facility 
(NSBF), is a NASA facility responsible for providing launch, tracking and control, airspace coordination, telemetry and command systems, and recovery services for unmanned high-altitude balloons. Customers of the CSBF include NASA centers, universities, and scientific groups from all over the world.

==Mission==
CSBF has a threefold mission:
* Provide maintenance, operations and logistics support for NASA&#x27;s scientific balloon program and facilities.
* Provide sophisticated ground and flight systems for launch, control, data retrieval, commanding, and recovery of NASA&#x27;s balloon missions.
* Perform research and development to advance the capabilities of NASA&#x27;s suborbital programs.

==History==
The Balloon Facility was established by Vincent E. Lally at NCAR in Boulder, Colorado in 1961 under the auspices of the National Science Foundation. It was moved to Palestine, Texas in 1963 and designated as the National Scientific Balloon Facility (NSBF) in January 1973.

In 1982, sponsorship of the NSBF was transferred from the National Science Foundation to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the NSBF became a separate entity under the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).

From October 1987 to January 2015, the CSBF was operated by the Physical Science Laboratory under the auspices of New Mexico State University located in Las Cruces, New Mexico. In February 2015, operation of the facility was transferred to the Technical Services Division of Orbital ATK. It is administered by Goddard Space Flight Center&#x27;s Wallops Flight Facility Balloon Program Office.

Its Texas location put the NSBF in the middle of the area where the debris from the Space Shuttle Columbia dropped to Earth on February 1, 2003. In February 2006, the NSBF was renamed the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility in honor of the Crew of STS-107.

==Ballooning==

===Balloon===

CSBF conventional and long duration (LDB) balloons are made of 20 micrometer thick polyethylene film, and at float have a diameter of up to and a volume of up to . The balloons are filled with helium gas, can carry payloads up to , fly at altitudes of up to , and can remain at float in excess of 40 days.

The balloons are zero pressure difference balloons, and are vented at the bottom. They are only partially inflated when launched, and as they rise up, the lower atmospheric pressure causes them to fully inflate.

The bottom of the balloon is attached to a parachute, which is then attached by steel suspension cables to the payload. A flight is terminated by firing an explosive squib which separates the parachute from the balloon. A rip line simultaneously tears open the top of the balloon. The balloon quickly deflates and falls to the ground, to be retrieved and disposed of (balloons are single use). The payload descends, suspended by the parachute, and is recovered by the ground crew.

Conventional payloads typically have a float duration at altitude of 72+ hours. Long Duration Ballooning payloads float at durations of 42+ days. Ultra long duration balloons (ULDB) are being developed which can operate at float for +100 days. The limiting factor is the diurnal cycle of the sun, rising and setting. Heat during the day causes the balloon to expand and gain altitude, thereby losing helium. Heat loss at night causes the balloon to sink and contract. Ballast is carried to overcome the effect. Flying in a polar region during full sunlight allows more negligible altitude variations.

ULDB balloons or superpressure balloons (SPB) are sealed to prevent helium loss and have a pumpkin shape at flight altitude. The SPB TRAVALB-2 surpassed previous Antarctic balloon flights by staying aloft for 149 days, 3 hours, and 58 minutes after launch from the NASA Long Duration Balloon (LDB) site at LDB Camp, McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The operation was supported by National Science Foundation and United States Antarctic Program. After the Travalb-1 launch abort, the Travalb-2 lifted off on 29 December 2019 to test NASA balloon trajectory predictions in Antarctica and to study electron losses from Earth&#x27;s radiation belts.

===Preparation, launch, and flight===
A balloon flight involves both the CSBF and a scientific team(s). The CSBF determines the launch site based on scientific goals, and provides local preparation facilities, a balloon(s), launch and recovery vehicles, and personnel to support the logistical aspects of pre flight, flight, and post flight activities. Scientific teams ship a payload to the launch site, and set up a small field station to assemble their equipment, make last-minute preparations, and manage the experiment during flight. The payload is typically a large instrument or cluster of instruments, plus onboard computers, radio telemetry equipment, and ballast.

Launching a balloon requires the conjunction of light low-level winds (to comply with the limitations of the CSBF dynamic launch technique) and suitable upper-level winds (so the balloon remains within telemetry range of a ground station, and within the permitted flight region). The payload may be rolled out to the launch area several times before surface and upper atmosphere conditions are acceptable for launch.

During the flight, data is transmitted to the ground for quick-look analysis, and is usually recorded on board as well. Scientists on the ground usually actively control the payload. An astronomical telescope, for example, can be real time directed toward a variety of sources for observations, or left in an autonomous mode of operation.

===Launch sites===

CSBF launches balloons from several sites in the world, depending on the needs of the experiment they carry. Sites include:
*Palestine, Texas
*Fort Sumner, New Mexico
*McMurdo Station, Antarctica
*Alice Springs, Australia
*Esrange, Sweden
*Fairbanks, Alaska
*Lynn Lake, Manitoba
*Wānaka, New Zealand

==Backup Control Center==
Since 2017, CSBF has been designated as the Backup Control Center (BCC) for the International Space Station&#x27;s Mission Control Center (MCC) in Houston, TX. Approximately 3 hours from Houston, CSBF provides facilities that NASA can utilize for short-term control of the ISS in case MCC is evacuated. The BCC was temporarily activated in August 2020 while the Johnson Space Center prepared for Hurricane Laura.

<text>Adlai E. Stevenson High School (AESHS), commonly called Stevenson High School (SHS), is a four-year public high school located in Lincolnshire, Illinois, United States. It is named after Adlai E. Stevenson II, the 31st Governor of Illinois.

==History==
In 1964, growing disagreement between the western (Lake Zurich) and eastern (current Stevenson) sections of the district emerged regarding the school&#x27;s direction. Before the opening of Stevenson, the students in the Stevenson area attended Ela-Vernon High School in Lake Zurich. Stevenson was planned to be a second school for the growing district, but the western side (Lake Zurich) of the district decided to build their own district. Adlai E. Stevenson High School opened in September 1965. This left Stevenson with an unfinished building, no board or administration, and no faculty. When Stevenson opened to 467 students and 31 teachers in 1965, the building was not carpeted, the library was empty, most classrooms were without desks and athletic fields were non-existent, as most of the school furniture had been shipped to Prairie View, Texas instead of Prairie View, Illinois.

In the 1980s, the release of &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot; and the arrival of Richard DuFour as school principal marked pivotal events. During the 1980s and 1990s, the school&#x27;s student activities program expanded, providing over 100 clubs and teams for students. By the late 1990s, intense student competition led to the formation of a task force to find solutions to issues like grading system manipulation. In 1992, a community referendum determined that Stevenson would remain the district&#x27;s only high school, with 52% supporting this option. In 1995, Stevenson underwent its largest expansion, growing by more than 50% with a $25 million project.

Stevenson has grown since its opening to become one of the largest high schools in the area. The school has undergone various additions over the years, the first being in 1970 where the school gym and pool were renovated. To accommodate the increasing student population, another round of remodeling occurred in the mid-1990s. After the addition of the three-level east building in 1995, the physical size of SHS increased to more than six times its original size of 113,000 square feet. The new east building included 60 new classrooms, a new Performing Arts Center (PAC), the Patriot Aquatic Center, Field House, and the Technology Center, among other projects as well. Also built was a new indoor walkway (&quot;The Link&quot;) between the original west building and the new east building.

In 2002, a referendum seeking an increase in the education tax rate received nearly 70% support from the community, stabilizing the district&#x27;s finances. Since 2002, DuFour&#x27;s retirement year, he had become a leading voice for school reform within the education community until his death in 2017. In April 2008, Education Week featured Stevenson High School in an article about its successful implementation of professional learning community practices.

In 2004, the main entrance to the school was completely rebuilt and transformed into another commons area now known as &quot;The Point.&quot; Other renovations that year included more fine arts areas around the band, choir, and orchestra rooms in the west building. Around 2008, many of the athletic fields were expanded and the football field received new turf. In that same year, the original auditorium was renovated as well.
In the 2005–06 school year, Stevenson had its highest enrollment of 4,573 students. Between the 2005–06 and 2014–15 school years, each school year saw progressively declining enrollment in the student body. In the 2014–15 school year, Stevenson had its first enrollment increase since the peak in the 2005–06 school year. Stevenson&#x27;s enrollment was 4,337 for the 2018–19 school year, and enrollment is expected to surpass 4500 by 2020.

In 2011, the school library and student resource center in the old/west building were renovated for the first time in Stevenson&#x27;s history. The project was finished in 2015 when the removal of the two lecture halls was completed to make way for the Quiet Learning Center (QLC). In addition to the new ILC/QLC, the photography studio was also renovated in the summer of 2013.

In 2019, the school added an extension to the east building, including 22 new classrooms, conference rooms, a green roof and flower garden, multiple living walls and solar panels, with the intent of making the new addition a net-zero building.

In 2020, Stevenson began planning for an additional expansion, with new athletic courts, an artificial turf playing field, a larger running track, an area for exercise equipment, and other features to be built in the enlarged field house. This addition was finished in August 2022.

==Demographics==
In 2023, the demographics were: White: 46.6%, Asian: 39.3%, Hispanic: 9.0%, Black: 1.7%, Two or More Races: 3.2%, and American Indian: 0.2%.

==Communities served==
The school serves students in the area&#x27;s District 125 coming from Lincolnshire, Long Grove, Prairie View, portions of Buffalo Grove, Mundelein, Kildeer, Hawthorn Woods and smaller portions of Vernon Hills, Lake Zurich, Riverwoods, Bannockburn, and Mettawa.

==Controversies and incidents==
===Newspaper censorship===
In November 2009, a dispute erupted between school officials and the student newspaper, &quot;The Statesman&quot;, regarding censorship of stories. The administration stopped publication of the November 20 issue, objecting to stories regarding drugs, teen pregnancy, and shoplifting. When students wanted to leave the front page blank in protest of the censorship, the officials instead required the students to produce other stories approved by the administration. The Stevenson public information officer released a statement November 20 stating the administration did not think anonymous sources discussing alleged illegal activity was fit for print.

The Chicago Tribune, in a November 26 editorial, said the school was wrong to force students to produce administration-approved stories. &quot;This isn&#x27;t editing, it&#x27;s censorship,&quot; wrote columnist Zak Stambor. The Society of Professional Journalists&#x27; Freedom of Information chairman called the censorship &quot;immoral, un-American, irresponsible and not fit for education.&quot;

Following the censorship fiasco, 11 of 14 Statesman staffers — and all the paper&#x27;s top editors — resigned from their positions at the start of the spring 2010 semester.

===Confiscation of student cellphones===
In February 2012, the school administration initiated an investigation into marijuana sales at the school, during which the cellphones of students suspected of marijuana sales were confiscated, and the text messages stored on the phones were read. The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois described the incident as a &quot;fishing expedition&quot;, while school officials stated they were &quot;perfectly within our rights&quot;. In one instance a student was suspended for five days and barred from participating in extracurricular activities because he refused to provide the password to his cellphone. The probe resulted in two arrests on misdemeanor drug charges.

===Student altercations===
In 2017, three female students were put on academic suspension when a video surfaced of a student attacking another student on a bus. The student was later charged in juvenile court for aggravated battery.

===Discrimination against Black students===
In January of 2020, a black student at Stevenson was allegedly targeted and disrespected by dean Nick Valenziano on a recorded video. This led to student protesting and an uproar in the Stevenson community. School administrators accepted Valenziano&#x27;s resignation around June of 2020, and hired a diversity director to address racial issues within the school.

==Awards and recognition==
Stevenson High School is one of the only high schools in the country to receive the United States Department of Education&#x27;s &quot;Excellence in Education&quot; Blue Ribbon Award five times. In addition, Stevenson has been named one of America&#x27;s top high schools by both U.S. News &amp; World Report and Newsweek magazines, and has been named a National School of Distinction in Arts Education by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

Niche ranked Stevenson as one of the best public high schools in America in 2017. In 2016, Niche gave A+ ratings in the following areas: academics, teachers, educational outcomes, health and safety, resources and facilities, sports and fitness, co-curricular activities, food service, and administration and policies.

Several national publications have regularly included Stevenson in their lists of America&#x27;s best public high schools. Stevenson was the top-ranked open-enrollment public high school in Illinois in 2021, 2015, and 2014 in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, and was the top-ranked open-enrollment school in Illinois in the &quot;Washington Post’s&quot; rankings in 2014, 2013, and 2012.

In 2021, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Stevenson as 171st in national rankings and 6th in Illinois.

For the class of 2016, 99.9% attended college. In 2015–2016, 360 students were named Illinois State Scholars. In addition, there were 32 National Merit Semi-Finalists in the Class of 2016 and 38 Commended students.

<text>Susan Frances Harmar Nicholls (born 23 November 1943) is an English actress, known for her roles on British television in &quot;Crossroads&quot; (1964–1968), &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot; (1976–1979), &quot;Rentaghost&quot; (1981–1984), and, especially, for her long-running part as Audrey Roberts on the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (1979–1982, 1984–present). She also appeared on Broadway in the 1974 revival of &quot;London Assurance&quot;.

Nicholls made her first appearance on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1979 and appeared intermittently for six years, before joining the cast permanently in 1985. For her portrayal of Roberts, she won the 2000 British Soap Award for Best Comedy Performance and the 2003 British Soap Award for Best Dramatic Performance, as well as receiving an Outstanding Achievement Award in 2019.

==Early life and education==
Susan Frances Harmar Nicholls was born in Darlaston, Wednesbury. Her father was Sir Harmar Nicholls, later Lord Harmar-Nicholls, the former Conservative MP for Peterborough (1950–1974) and MEP for Greater Manchester South (1979–1984), and subsequently a life peer; she is thus entitled to be referred to as &quot;The Honourable Susan Nicholls&quot;. She has a sister, Judith. She was educated at the School of St Mary and St Anne (later known as Abbots Bromley School for Girls), and is a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

==Career==
Nicholls first became known as Marilyn Gates on &quot;Crossroads&quot;, a role she played from 1964 to 1968. A song she first sang on the programme, &quot;Where Will You Be?&quot;, charted on 3 July 1968, eventually reaching number 17 in the UK Singles Chart.

Nicholls&#x27;s second single was less successful and she embarked on a career in a cabaret, performing her solo act all over the country. She returned to the stage in a variety of popular plays and pantomimes. During the 1970s, she had two very different stints abroad. In Vienna she sang between strip acts at a nightclub while in 1974 she toured America and Canada with the Royal Shakespeare Company in &quot;London Assurance&quot;, finishing with a six-week run on Broadway.

She played the role of the secretary, Joan Greengross (later Webster and Millbeck) in the sitcom &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot; (1976–1979) and its sequel &quot;The Legacy of Reginald Perrin&quot; (1996), as well as Nadia Popov in &quot;Rentaghost&quot; and Mrs Muddle in &quot;Pipkins&quot; (1973) and appeared as Derinda Forbes in the hard-hitting police drama &quot;The Professionals&quot;; episode &quot;The Acorn Syndrome&quot; (1980).

She has played Audrey in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as an occasional visitor since April 1979, and a full-time permanent character since 1985.

==Personal life==
Nicholls was married to Mark Eden from 1993 until his death in 2021; Eden appeared as Alan Bradley on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; from 1986 until 1989.

In 2011, while watching an episode of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, Sister Anna Bianconi-Moore, a senior nurse at the dermatology department at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge, noticed a mole on Nicholls&#x27; shoulder. The nurse contacted the show immediately via email to express her concerns. Nicholls was seen by Zeena Islam – &quot;Coronation Street&#x27;s&quot; in-house doctor, who referred her to a skin cancer specialist, where she was diagnosed with malignant melanoma. After the mole was surgically removed, ITV contacted Bianconi-Moore to inform her of the situation and she was invited to the &quot;Coronation Street&quot; set to meet Nicholls.

Diseases associated with this genus include: Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman&#x27;s disease, caused by Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). The term rhadino comes from the Latin fragile, referring to the tendency of the viral genome to break apart when it is isolated.

== Species ==
The genus consists of the following 12 species:

* &quot;Rhadinovirus atelinegamma2&quot;, also called Ateline gammaherpesvirus 2
* &quot;Rhadinovirus atelinegamma3&quot;, also called Ateline gammaherpesvirus 3
* &quot;Rhadinovirus bovinegamma4&quot;, also called Bovine gammaherpesvirus 4
* &quot;Rhadinovirus colobinegamma1&quot;
* &quot;Rhadinovirus cricetidgamma2&quot;, also called Cricetid gammaherpesvirus 2
* &quot;Rhadinovirus humangamma8&quot;, commonly called Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)
* &quot;Rhadinovirus macacinegamma5&quot;, also called Macacine gammaherpesvirus 5
* &quot;Rhadinovirus macacinegamma8&quot;, also called Macacine gammaherpesvirus 8
* &quot;Rhadinovirus macacinegamma11&quot;, also called Macacine gammaherpesvirus 11
* &quot;Rhadinovirus macacinegamma12&quot;, also called Macacine gammaherpesvirus 12
* &quot;Rhadinovirus muridgamma4&quot;, also called Murid gammaherpesvirus 4
* &quot;Rhadinovirus muridgamma7&quot;, also called Murid gammaherpesvirus 7
* &quot;Rhadinovirus saimiriinegamma2&quot;, also called Saimiriine gammaherpesvirus 2

== Hosts ==
In general, rhadinoviruses infect lymphocytes and adherent cells, such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells and once infection occurs, it is, in general, lifelong. Rhadinoviruses infect a wide range of mammals, include humans. Rhadinoviruses have been found in New World monkeys such as the squirrel monkeys (herpesvirus saimiri) and in mice (&quot;Murid gammaherpesvirus 68&quot;). More recently, both KSHV-like viruses and a new form of rhadinovirus called rhesus rhadinovirus have been discovered in Old World monkeys. These findings suggest that an additional human tumor virus related to KSHV may be found in humans.

== Structure ==
Viruses in &quot;Rhadinovirus&quot; are enveloped, with icosahedral, spherical to pleomorphic, and round geometries, and T=16 symmetry. The diameter is around 150-200 nm. Genomes are linear and non-segmented, around 180kb in length. They are large double-stranded viruses that possess up to 100 genes in a single long chromosome, which is flanked by repetitive DNA sequences called terminal repeats. 
== Life cycle ==
Viral replication is nuclear, and is lysogenic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the dsDNA bidirectional replication model. DNA-templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear egress, and budding. Humans and other mammals serve as natural hosts. Transmission routes are sexual, contact, and through saliva.

== Notes ==
Rhadinoviruses are unique because they have mastered the ability to pirate cellular genes from their host cells and incorporate them into their genomes. For example, most rhadinoviruses have a copy of the cyclin gene, which regulates the ability of the cell to divide. These viruses tend to cause tumors when infection occurs outside of their native hosts or in the case of KSHV, in humans when the host is immunosuppressed due to AIDS, old age, or in the setting of organ transplantation.

<text>The Laval Titan was one of the names used by a junior ice hockey team in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) franchise that played in Laval, Quebec, Canada, between 1971 and 1998.

==History==
The Rosemont National began in the 1969–70 QMJHL season as one of the founding franchises of the QMJHL, playing in the Montreal borough of Rosemont, Quebec at the Paul Sauvé Arena. After only two seasons in Rosemont the team moved to Laval, Quebec, where they would play the next 27 years under several names. Laval National was the team&#x27;s original name, but they were renamed the Laval Voisins (meaning neighbours) in 1979, and then the Titan (&quot;Titans&quot;) in 1985.

During the 1983-1984 season, Laval won their first QMJHL championship. The team was coached by Jean Bégin, and featured Mario Lemieux who had scored 133 goals and 282 points in 70 games during the regular season. In game six of the championship, Laval defeated the Longueuil Chevaliers by a score of 17–1 to clinch the league title. Mario Lemieux led his team with six goals and two assists.

For the 1994–95 QMJHL season the team was renamed Laval Titan Collège Français, when the Collège Français came aboard as a sponsor, bring some of its management when the Verdun Collège Français folded in the off-season. In 1998, faced with an aging Colisée de Laval and dwindling attendance, the team moved to Bathurst, New Brunswick, becoming the Acadie–Bathurst Titan.

The Titan won the President&#x27;s Cup four times, in 1984, 1989, 1990 and 1993. They participated in the Memorial Cup five times and made the final once in 1994, when they hosted the tournament. They lost that year to the Kamloops Blazers.

<doc id="1247603" wikidata="Q5683106" url="?curid=1247603" title="Havana Sugar Kings">
<text>The Havana Sugar Kings () were a Cuban-based minor league baseball team that played from 1946 to 1960. From 1954 until 1960, they belonged in the Class AAA International League, affiliated with Major League Baseball&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds. Their home stadium was Gran Estadio del Cerro (sometimes called Gran Stadium) in Havana.

==History==
The Sugar Kings began life in 1946 as the Havana Cubans, founded by Washington Senators scout Joe Cambria. That year, they (rather than a Cuban League side) represented Cuba at the inaugural Interamerican Series, the predecessor to the modern Caribbean Series.

Led by manager Oscar Rodriguez, the Cubans experienced tremendous success both on and off the field. Havana finished first in Class C (later Class B) Florida International League in each of their first five seasons of play, winning over 100 games twice and compiling a record of 474-249 in five years under Rodriguez. The overall record would be even better had Havana not been stripped of 17 wins in 1946 for having too many experienced players for their class. Nonetheless, the Cubans still had the league&#x27;s top record even without the victories.

Havana then won consecutive FIL championships in 1947 and 1948. The 1947 Cubans were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. The team was also successful at the box office, leading the league in attendance each year from 1946-50. In their first three seasons, Havana led all Class C teams in attendance, including a mark of 264,813 in 1947 that is still the highest total ever recorded by a Class C franchise.

During the 1953 season, Roberto &quot;Bobby&quot; Maduro bought the team and immediately had aspirations of bringing Major League Baseball to Havana. After the 1953 season, the Springfield Cubs folded, leaving an opening in the Triple-A International League. Maduro moved his franchise to the IL and renamed it the Sugar Kings. After playing the 1954 season as an independent club, the franchise signed an agreement with the Cincinnati Reds for the 1955 season and the Sugar Kings became Cincinnati&#x27;s top farm club for the remainder of their existence. In addition to Reds prospects, several talented Cuban players and other Latinos who eventually made it to the Major Leagues donned the Sugar Kings uniform, including Luis Arroyo, Pompeyo Davalillo, Tony González, Cookie Rojas, Elio Chacón, Danny Morejón, Preston Gómez, Leo Cárdenas, and Mike Cuellar.

In their inaugural season at the Triple-A level, the Sugar Kings drew 295,453 fans despite a fifth-place finish, second behind only pennant-winning Toronto. The next season, Havana won 87 games, their most in IL play, and drew a franchise-record 313,232 fans, again second to Toronto. However, the Sugar Kings were eliminated by the Maple Leafs in the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs.

The next three seasons were less successful, as Havana finished with identical 72-82 records in 1956-57, finishing in sixth place both years. In 1957, attendance cratered to 84,320, less than half that of any other IL club. However, despite a franchise-worse 65-88 record and last-place finish in 1958, attendance rebounded to 178,000.

===1959 championship===
In 1959, led by future major league manager Preston Gómez, the Sugar Kings rebounded to finish 80-73, finishing third in the IL standings. Amid revolution in Cuba that saw Fidel Castro rise to power, the Sugar Kings did not escape the turmoil. The most notable incident occurred on the night of July 25 in a home game against the Rochester Red Wings. As the game dragged on into extra innings, the clock passed midnight to the 26th, marking the anniversary of the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. Celebratory gunfire outside the ballpark grazed Cincinnati shortstop Leo Cardenas and third base coach Frank Verdi, who both sustained minor injuries. Rochester pulled their team off the field and left Cuba, cancelling the final game of the series.

However, the Sugar Kings were allowed to finish out their schedule and returned to the postseason. In the playoffs, Havana swept the Columbus Jets 4-0 and defeated the Richmond Virginians 4-2 to win the Governors&#x27; Cup. They then took on the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association in the Junior World Series. After two games with small crowds and frigid conditions at Metropolitan Stadium, the decision was made to move the balance of the series to Havana.

On their home turf, the Sugar Kings took the series the distance, rallying to walk off in Game 7 to take the series 4-3. The five games in Havana drew 100,000 people.

===Nationalization and departure from Cuba===
In 1960, Castro nationalized all U.S.-owned enterprises in Cuba, and on July 8, Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick (under pressure from Secretary of State Christian Herter) announced that the Sugar Kings would move to Jersey City, New Jersey, and became the Jersey City Jerseys. They lasted only through the 1961 season, then folded due to poor attendance. The franchise was then sold to a Florida group from Jacksonville and became the Jacksonville Suns, who began play in the International League in 1962. That franchise moved to Portsmouth, Virginia, in 1969 and became the Tidewater Tides, and remains in that region as the Norfolk Tides.

In February 1987, the Miami City Commission voted unanimously in favor of the renaming Miami Stadium in honor of Bobby Maduro, who had migrated to USA. The ballpark became known officially as Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium one month later.

==2021 Miami Marlins alternate uniform==
On May 17, 2021, The Miami Marlins unveiled a new alternate uniform which pays homage to the old Sugar Kings uniform.

<text>Houghton House is a ruined mansion house in the parish of Houghton Conquest, Bedfordshire. It is a Grade I listed building, positioned above the surrounding countryside, and commands excellent views. Built from 1615 to 1621, it is said that the house was the model for &quot;House Beautiful&quot; in John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1678). It was abandoned in 1794 and stripped (by the owner) of its interiors and roof for sale as building supplies. Today the property is owned by English Heritage, and is open to free public access during daylight hours.

==Descent==
===Herbert===
The estate of Houghton was granted by King James I of England (1603-1625) to Mary Herbert, Dowager Countess of Pembroke (1561-1621), a.k.a. Mary Sidney, a courtier, writer, translator, and literary patron, who commenced the building of the existing house in about 1615. Two architects were very likely responsible for the design, John Thorpe, who worked in the Jacobean tradition, and Inigo Jones, who introduced the Classical style of architecture into England. The Countess of Pembroke was visited there by King James I in 1621, soon after its completion. Shortly afterwards, on 25 September 1621, she died of the smallpox. The surviving Jacobean-style frieze on the western side of the house displays heraldic elements relating to the Sidney family and to the Countess&#x27;s relations, the Dudley family.

===Bruce===
Two years after the death of the Countess of Pembroke, the house reverted to King James I by the Countess&#x27; brother, the King then granted the estate to Thomas Bruce, 1st Earl of Elgin (1599–1663) in 1624, which became the main residence of the Bruce family for three generations. King Charles I of England later granted him nearby Houghton Park to preserve game for the royal hunt, but persistent hunting and hawking by the local Conquest family forced the King&#x27;s subsequent intervention.

In the churchyard of nearby Maulden Church, the advowson of which was owned by the Bruce family, is the Ailesbury Mausoleum, the earliest free-standing mausoleum in England, built in 1656 by Thomas Bruce, 1st Earl of Elgin in memory of his 2nd wife, Lady Diana Cecil. The Bruce family resided in the house until Thomas Bruce, 3rd Earl of Elgin, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury went into exile on the Continent in 1696 on account of his loyalty to the deposed King James II of England (1685-deposed 1688, died 1701).

===Russell===
Thomas Bruce, 3rd Earl of Elgin, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury never returned to Houghton and in 1738 sold the house to John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, whose principal seat was Woburn Abbey, about seven miles from Houghton. His son and heir apparent, Francis Russell, Marquess of Tavistock (d.1767), lived at Houghton from 1764 until he died in a hunting accident in 1767. Thus the 4th Duke&#x27;s estates, including Houghton, and titles passed to his grandson, Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford (d.1802), who having let the deerpark to a neighbour found he was unable to let the house without its grounds. Considering the house as a liability, in 1794 he ordered Houghton to be dismantled, and accordingly the furnishings were stripped out and the roof removed to be sold as building materials. The staircase survives in The Swan Hotel in Bedford, roughly north of Houghton House. The 5th Duke never married and thus did not produce a legitimate male heir. He died in 1802 by which time the house, by then long open to the elements, was already in decay.

===21st century===
The ruins were acquired by English Heritage, and is open to free public access during daylight hours. Conservation work was undertaken in 2006 to help maintain safety and improve the understanding of the site and new visitor information boards were installed. By 2007 several of these had been vandalised leaving empty boards behind, but these have since been restored.

<doc id="1247607" wikidata="Q324981" url="?curid=1247607" title="Francis Cabrel">
<text>Francis Christian Cabrel (; born 23 November 1953) is a French singer-songwriter, composer and guitarist. Considered one of the most influential French musical artists of all time, he has released a number of albums falling mostly within the realm of folk, with occasional forays into blues or country. Several of his songs, such as &quot;L&#x27;encre de tes yeux&quot;, &quot;Je l&#x27;aime à mourir&quot;, &quot;Petite Marie&quot;, &quot;La Dame de Haute-Savoie&quot;, &quot;Encore et encore&quot;, &quot;Il faudra leur dire&quot;, &quot;Sarbacane&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;est écrit&quot;, &quot;Je t&#x27;aimais, je t&#x27;aime, je t&#x27;aimerai&quot; and &quot;La corrida&quot;, have become enduring favourites in French music. Since the start of his career, Cabrel has sold over 25 million albums.

His first hit song was &quot;Petite Marie&quot; in 1974, which was about the woman who soon became his wife, Mariette. His song &quot;Je l&#x27;aime à mourir&quot; was covered by Shakira; this version, both sung in French and Spanish, became a major hit single. His song &quot;Edition Spéciale&quot; was featured in the 1987 film Broadcast News starring Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks and William Hurt.

Although Francis Cabrel is best known as a French-speaking singer, he also sings in Spanish (&quot;La quiero a morir&quot;, &quot;Vengo a ofrecer mi corazón&quot;), and even a little in Occitan (&quot;Giors&quot;, &quot;Rockstars du Moyen Âge&quot;) and Italian. 

An unauthorised biography was published in 2015. Cabrel, who is one of the most private French singers, attempted to have the book suppressed.

==Biography==
Francis Cabrel was born in Agen, Lot-et-Garonne into a modest family of Venetian Veneto
descent. His father was a labourer in a biscuit factory and his mother a cashier in a cafeteria. He has a sister, Martine, and a brother, Philippe. He spent his childhood in Astaffort, in Lot-et-Garonne.

<text>Samuel Belzberg, (June 26, 1928 – March 30, 2018) was a Canadian businessman and philanthropist.

==Biography==
Samuel Belzberg was born to a Jewish family in Calgary, Alberta and educated at the University of Alberta. In 1962, he founded the provincial trust company, City Savings and Trust in Edmonton which was heavily involved in real-estate development financing. In 1968, he moved to Vancouver with his brothers, Hyman Belzberg (1925-2017) and William Belzberg (1932-2014), and formed Western Realty. In 1970, he founded First City Financial Corp as the parent company for City Savings and Trust. In 1973, Belzberg and his brothers sold Western Realty and purchased Far West Financial Corp of California, marking their entrance into the United States. By the late 1980s, First City Financial Corp, now a diversified holding company, had assets of $5.4 billion with operations in Canada and the US. First City was involved in many large investment transactions including Bache Securities before it was sold to Prudential, Gulf Oil, Armstrong World (a large building supply company) and Scovill (a manufacturing company which included Yale Locks, Hamilton Beach, NuTone) which they purchased in 1985 for $523 million.

During the 1990s, Belzberg founded Balfour Holdings Ltd., a real estate company which, at its peak, operated over 26 projects spreading through the United States. Balfour&#x27;s mandate was to profit from the dislocations in value in the United States due to the Savings and Loan crisis. Balfour subdivided and serviced its purchased lands and sold the lots to National Builders. In 1997, Balfour was sold to The Blackstone Group, a large U.S. private equity group and generated realized returns in excess of 20% per annum. During the 1990s, Mr. Belzberg was an active acquirer of distressed property in Alberta where values had dramatically declined due to the softness in the oil industry. These properties were subsequently divested when the market recovered. In 1992, Belzberg started a private real estate and equity investments company, which is now called Gibralt Capital Corporation.

==Philanthropy and awards==
Belzberg served on various Board of Directors and is involved with numerous charities. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1989 from the Governor General, and also in 1989 he received an honorary doctorate from Simon Fraser University. 

The &quot;Samuel and Frances Belzberg Library&quot; at Simon Fraser University is named after the couple.

==Personal life==
Belzberg died on March 30, 2018, in Vancouver, and is survived by his wife of 68 years, Frances (née Cooper), and four children: Marc, Lisa, Wendy, and Cheri. His daughter Wendy married and has 3 children with American businessman Strauss Zelnick. His daughter Lisa, was married to and has three children with American businessman and philanthropist Matthew Bronfman, son of Canadian billionaire Edgar Bronfman Sr.

<text>&quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; is a song by American singer Al Green from his 1972 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot;. It was produced and recorded by Willie Mitchell, and mixed by Mitchell and Terry Manning. Released as a single in 1971, &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and remained on the chart for 16 weeks and also topped &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart for nine weeks. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as eleventh-highest selling song of 1972.

It was ranked the 60th greatest song of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine on their 2004 list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and has been covered by numerous other performers, most notably Tina Turner.

It was selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The song went on to claim the number 1 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End chart as an R&amp;B song for 1972.

In 1999, the 1971 recording on Hi Records by Al Green was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Tina Turner version==
&quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; was later covered by Tina Turner, her second collaboration with the British Heaven 17 and British Electric Foundation production team after &quot;Ball of Confusion&quot; in 1982, and served as her comeback single in late 1983. Unlike Al Green&#x27;s version, Turner sings verse 2 first, then verse 1 when the band starts playing.

Released by Capitol Records in November 1983, the single charted at number 6 in the UK (one place higher than Al Green&#x27;s original) and became the third time she reached the UK top ten, the first two being with former husband Ike Turner on &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; and &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot;. Following the US release in January 1984, the single reached #24 in Cash Box, #26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Chart.

At the time, the song was the most successful solo single Turner had released. It was included on her multi-platinum selling album &quot;Private Dancer&quot;, released a few months later in the spring of 1984. The music video was directed by David Mallet. The cover photography was by Norman Seeff.

<text>Steven R. Appleton (March 31, 1960 – February 3, 2012) was an American business executive, the CEO of Micron Technology, based in Boise, Idaho.

Born and raised in Southern California, Appleton attended Boise State University and played tennis for the Broncos. A lifelong aviation enthusiast, he died when his single-engine plane crashed shortly after takeoff from the Boise Airport on February 3, 2012.

==Career==
Appleton started his career at Micron shortly after graduation from BSU in 1983, working the night shift in production for less than five dollars an hour. He held a variety of positions in the company, including wafer fab manager, production manager, director of manufacturing, and vice president of manufacturing before being appointed president and COO in 1991. Appleton was appointed CEO and chairman of the board in 1994 at age 34. In January 1996, he was fired and then rehired eight days later.

He formerly served on the board of directors for SEMATECH, the Idaho State Supreme Court Advisory Council, and was appointed by the Clinton Administration to serve on the National Semiconductor Technology Council. At the time of his death, he was serving on the board of directors for the Semiconductor Industry Association, and the board of directors for National Semiconductor Corporation, The U.S. Technology CEO Council, and was a member of the World Semiconductor Council and the Idaho Business Council. After his death, Mark Durcan assumed Appleton&#x27;s position as CEO of Micron.

In 2011 he received the Robert Noyce Award from the Semiconductor Industry Association.

==Personal life==
Appleton participated in a number of sports, including professional tennis. His hobbies included scuba diving, surfing, wakeboarding, motorcycling, and more recently, off-road car racing. His aviation background included multiple ratings and professional performances at air shows in both propeller and jet-powered aircraft. He also had a black belt in taekwondo.

On the 43rd edition of the Tecate SCORE Baja 1000 on 2010, Appleton finished 1st on a SCORE Class 1 buggy and 7th overall with a time of 20:32.18.

He was married to his wife Dalynn, and had 4 children.

==Death==
On February 3, 2012, Appleton was killed while attempting an emergency landing in a Lancair IV-PT experimental-category, four-seat, turboprop airplane at the Boise Airport, moments after taking off. He had aborted a take off a few minutes earlier for unknown reasons.

Eight years earlier in 2004 with a passenger aboard and several miles south of the same airport, Appleton had a serious plane crash piloting an Extra 300; he sustained a punctured lung, head injuries, ruptured disk, and broken bones. The passenger was a Micron employee and was also injured; he was photographing Appleton for an upcoming corporate presentation.

<doc id="1247622" wikidata="Q7303715" url="?curid=1247622" title="Red Barn (restaurant)">
<text>The Red Barn restaurant was a fast-food restaurant chain founded in 1961 in Springfield, Ohio, by Don Six, Martin Levine, and Jim Kirst. In 1963, the small chain was purchased by Richard O. Kearns, operated as Red Barn System, with the offices moving briefly to Dayton, Ohio and in August 1964 to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During the late 1960s United Servomation, also called Servomation, bought the Red Barn chain.

In 1978, United Servomation merged with the City Investing Company&#x27;s GDV division which also owned the Motel 6 motel chain. Only interested in real estate, construction, and financial services, the new owners ceased advertising for the chain and allowed the franchise leases to expire. The last one expired in around 1988. At its peak, Red Barn had 300–400 restaurants in 19 states, as well as outlets in southern Ontario, elsewhere in Canada, and in Australia.

Following the shutdown of operations, most of the Red Barn buildings were converted to other uses. A few of the restaurants were renamed &quot;The Farm&quot; in various states, and continued using the same menu as when they were under their Red Barn franchise. Two locations under &quot;The Farm&quot; name were in Racine, Wisconsin and Bradford, Pennsylvania. The Bradford location closed for a brief period in 2014 after a small fire, and permanently closed in December 2015. The Racine, Wisconsin store closed on February 2, 2020. Some Australian Red Barn stores were converted into McDonald&#x27;s restaurants. 

==History==

===Building design===
Originally, Red Barn restaurants were in the shape of a barn, with a glass front and limited seating. That design was patented in 1962 by Red Barn Systems, incorporated of Springfield, Ohio, which granted the franchise licenses. Later buildings had the familiar fast-food style mansard roof which allowed them to comply to more local building codes.

===Menu items===
Red Barn was known for &quot;Big Barney&quot;, a hamburger similar to a Big Mac, and the &quot;Barnbuster&quot;, similar to a McDonald&#x27;s Quarter Pounder or Whopper.)

The chain was quite forward-looking with its food choices: the Big Barney predated the Big Mac by a few years, and it was the first chain to have self-service salad bars.

===Advertising and promotions===

The restaurant chain had a TV commercial jingle the lyrics of which were: &quot;When the hungries hit / When the hungries hit / Hit the Red Barn.&quot; Another commercial jingle used in north-east Ohio included the line &quot;You&#x27;ll find more of what you are hankerin&#x27; for, at the Red Barn&quot;. Three mascots were used in the franchise&#x27;s commercials: &quot;Hamburger Hungry&quot;, a humanoid figure with a hamburger in bun for a head, &quot;Chicken Hungry&quot;,a chicken leg, and &quot;Big Fish Hungry&quot;, a blue fish.

In Australia, Red Barney commonly appeared on &quot;Cartoon Corner&quot; with Daryl Somers. He was an affable clown who gave away prizes and preceded Ronald McDonald.

In the spring of 1970, the chain found itself at the center of controversy when a franchisee wanted to erect a store in Dinkytown, a neighborhood adjacent to the University of Minnesota-East Bank campus in Minneapolis. Protestors, who were already riding a wave of anti-corporatism, as well as an anti-Vietnam war sentiment, occupied a vacant building that the Red Barn franchisee had bought. The franchisee demolished the existing building, but the replacement restaurant was never constructed, and the property was later sold off. A Red Barn location later opened nearby in Stadium Village.

<text>Liberty in North Korea (LiNK) is a US 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. It has offices in Long Beach, California, United States, and Seoul, South Korea. The organization rescues refugees hiding in China and resettles them in South Korea or the United States, so that they can avoid being forcibly repatriated back to North Korea, where they can face harsh punishments. The refugees first travel from China to Southeast Asia through what the organization calls an &quot;Underground Railroad&quot;, and then on to South Korea where they are recognized as refugees.

LiNK also seeks to raise awareness of human rights issues in North Korea through media production, conducting research, and through tours. Having sprung out of Korean-American student activism at universities in the United States, the organization grew rapidly and produced several feature-length documentaries, as well as TED talks by its leaders and rescuees. The organization now has a Research &amp; Strategy department based in Seoul, that conducts research on North Korean issues with an emphasis on human rights issues. The organization positions itself as different from governmental positions and media narratives that focus on the dismantling of North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons program and other national security issues, focusing instead on refugees who were considered economic migrants by the Chinese government and who risked repatriation. LiNK provides support to resettlement programs for North Koreans beyond those provided by the South Korean government.

==History==

===Early years and leadership===
Liberty in North Korea was founded at Yale University on March 27, 2004, the last day of the eighteenth annual Korean American Students Conference (KASCON) which described LiNK as &quot;an explosive organization.&quot; The co-founders were Adrian Hong and the comedian Paul Kim. The launch included a talk from a North Korean defector and video clips of escape attempts. In December 2004, LiNK sent two teams to the border of China and North Korea to interview North Korean refugees and to investigate conditions.

Led by Adrian Hong, LiNK&#x27;s name recognition spread through the efforts of Korean-Americans at universities and colleges who registered 40 chapters in a short period of time. Volunteers worked on staging protests, petition drives, and public awareness campaigns. In January 2007, Adrian Hong wrote that &quot;two LiNK field workers and 6 North Korean refugees were caught and imprisoned by Chinese authorities&quot; en route from Shenyang, and that Hong himself had been detained in Beijing. The Wall Street Journal took interest in the case and one of its reporters, Melanie Kirkpatrick, supported LiNK&#x27;s activities in China in her book &quot;Escaping North Korea: The Untold Story of Asia’s Underground Railroad&quot;. The organization continued to grow and LiNK&#x27;s mission expanded to include more field projects; by March 2007, LiNK had 100 chapters in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Korea. In March 2007, its director Adrian Hong stated that &quot;LiNK has briefed and advocated to the highest levels of governments and agencies around the world,&quot; then called for a day of fasting.

In 2007–08, LiNK made changes to its strategy and leadership. In March 2007, LiNK altered its grassroots strategy and shifted to a membership-based model, which led to the disbanding of all chapters that year and a more unified approach to events. In the summer of 2008, Hannah Song took over as executive director, replacing Adrian Hong. Song began talks with Justin Wheeler of The Option, another organization focused on North Korean refugees, and in the fall of 2008 the two groups merged, retaining the structure and name of LiNK. South Korean newspaper &quot;Chosun Ilbo&quot; reported that &quot;Hong left LiNK when he became convinced that bolder action was required in 2009,&quot; and according to a statement made by LiNK, Adrian Hong&#x27;s involvement with the organization ended around this time. Wheeler was a persuasive advocate for the organization, giving TED talks and other presentations in the early 2010s. Wheeler noted that from 2011, all funding received went to LiNK programs.

===Move to Los Angeles===
In 2009, LiNK moved from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles. The organization also changed its activism strategy from political lobbying to bringing attention to the people of North Korea instead of the politics already frequently reported on. Beginning in the spring of 2009, they also began to send groups of interns to give presentations to schools, colleges, churches and other venues about the North Korean human rights crisis. LiNK has conducted 13 tours as of fall 2014, which occur twice a year on a semester basis.

==Refugee assistance==
LiNK has focused its work on North Korean refugees in China, who are vulnerable to exploitation and punishment in China, and can be repatriated if caught. If repatriated, North Koreans face reprisal in the forms of interrogation, prison camps, and execution. As a result, LiNK works to rescue North Korean refugees hiding in China and helps them escape through Southeast Asia. As of March 2019, LiNK had resettled 1,000 refugees throughout the U.S. and South Korea.

According to LiNK, the cost of each rescue is $3,000 USD. LiNK coordinates a &quot;Resettlement Assistance Program&quot; to help newly resettled refugees.

==Raising awareness==
LiNK works to shift the attention on North Korea away from high politics and towards the North Korean people through a combination of media, tours, and campaigns. They are supported in their efforts by Rescue Teams.

===Rescue Teams===
Formerly known as chapters, Rescue Teams are groups formed at universities, colleges, high schools, churches, and other venues that raise funds for refugee rescues through bake sales, concerts, and other fundraising activities.

===Tours===
In the past LiNK conducted biannual informational national tours of the United States and Canada. The tours generally lasted eleven weeks and consisted primarily of LiNK Nomads visiting high schools, colleges, churches, and other community locations to screen LiNK media and answer questions about North Korea and LiNK&#x27;s work.

===Campaigns===
LiNK creates and implements campaigns which highlight specific facets of importance regarding North Korea and work to bring under-publicized issues to the attention of the public. The most recent campaign was titled Jangmadang, referring to the Korean word for &quot;market&quot; (&quot;Jangmadang&quot;) that is used in North Korea to refer to a place where North Koreans gather to buy and sell goods. Past campaigns have included Bridge (2013), SHIFT (2012), The Reliance (2011), and TheHundred (2009).

====Jangmadang (2014)====
Jangmadang focused on the markets (&quot;Jangmadang&quot;) that are proliferating in North Korea to circumvent the government&#x27;s control of trade. These markets began forming in the late 1990s in response to a severe famine in the country and an inability of the government to provide adequate food supplies. The markets also provide a venue for information dissemination through electronic media, such as DVDs and portable DVD players, USB flash drives, SD cards, portable radios, Chinese cell phones with international calling capabilities, and through word-of-mouth.

The event included videos from North Korean defectors Joo Yang, Yeon-mi Park, and Joseph Kim. The campaign ran during the fall of 2014.

====Bridge (2013)====
Bridge focused on rescuing &quot;game-changers&quot; who can build &quot;bridges&quot; of information and money back to North Korea. This campaign focuses on the power an individual has to bring change to North Korea. By helping these refugees, LiNK hoped to spark increased market and information-sharing activity within the country. The initiative&#x27;s goal was to raise $200,000.

====SHIFT (2012)====
SHIFT was focused on changing the public&#x27;s perception on North Korea from politics to the people. SHIFT encouraged people to tell the stories of the North Korean people themselves and to challenge media moguls to change the way that they are reporting on the North Korean issue. It has since become an integral part of LiNK&#x27;s focus.

====The Reliance (2011)====
The Reliance was a drive to create a human network of people committed to seeing every North Korean refugee free. LiNK used social media to mobilize people across the world to start their own fundraising campaigns online with 100% of proceeds going to rescue missions.

====TheHundred (2009)====
TheHundred was started to kick start LiNK&#x27;s fundraising efforts to begin rescuing refugees. The initial goal was to fund 100 rescue missions, which has since been accomplished.

===Videos===

====Bridge to North Korea (2013)====
In the fall of 2013, LiNK released &quot;Bridge to North Korea&quot;, which discussed the ongoing changes within the country as well as highlighting how refugees are helping to drive those changes even while residing in other countries by sending back money and information to their families.

====Danny from North Korea (2013)====
In 2013, LiNK released a documentary titled &quot;Danny From North Korea&quot;. It features Danny Lee and focuses on his story of escape from North Korea in March 2005 and resettlement into the United States. It has been used in both their spring and fall tours of 2013, and has been featured in a number of independent film festivals.

====SHIFT campaign video (2012)====
In the fall of 2012, LiNK released a short film to support its SHIFT campaign, loosely referred to as &quot;The SHIFT Campaign Video&quot;. Supported by an anonymous partner, every view of the video on YouTube raises $0.25 on behalf of LiNK&#x27;s work.

====The People&#x27;s Crisis (2012)====
In 2012, LiNK released its first independent feature-length documentary titled &quot;The People&#x27;s Crisis&quot;. Rather than seeking to evoke an emotional reaction, the film was purposed to inform the viewer about North Korea as a whole and LiNK&#x27;s work.

==Summit==
Liberty in North Korea held its first Summit at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, in June 2014. North Korean speakers included activists Joseph Kim, Joo Yang, Yeon-mi Park and others. The event concluded with a private show from Run River North, David Choi, and Eatyourkimchi.

==Research and strategy==
LiNK&#x27;s Research and Strategy department, led by Director of Research and Strategy Sokeel Park, contributes independent research and analysis to the North Korea issue while collaborating with experts around the globe in seeking an end to the North Korea crisis. Park is an academic with degrees from the London School of Economics and experience working at the United Nations. He regularly is quoted in major newspapers and on major broadcasts. His Research and Strategy team produces a weekly summary of North Korea-related news, which serves as an aggregate regarding North Korea&#x27;s internal situation, human rights, economy and food security, refugee issues, international politics and security, and expert analysis and opinion.

===Theory of change===
LiNK advocates for a people-centered theory of change and lobbies on behalf of a citizen empowerment model. Their goals include the sharing of illegal media such as foreign DVDs and conveying subversive information fosters dependence on others outside the government. Marketization is another area of emphasis for change, recognizing that corruption among officials at local levels both eases access to foreign media and drives black market activity that erodes people&#x27;s dependence on the regime. Cross-border trade and attendant ideological erosion are also areas which the organization sees as essential to change in North Korea.

==Partnerships==
LiNK partners with several like-minded organizations to increase its reach. One of these partnerships is with the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK), which has collaborated with LiNK and the Simon Wiesenthal Center to host an event at the Museum of Tolerance titled &quot;North Korea&#x27;s Political Prisoner Camp System and the Plight of North Korean Refugees: A Call for Action&quot;.

==Media attention==
In May 2008, Google Tech Talk hosted an event with then-Director of LinK, Adrian Hong, and the North Korean refugee and former ambassador for LiNK, Shin Dong-hyuk.

Shin spoke of his time with the organization in his &quot;New York Times&quot;-bestselling biography, &quot;Escape from Camp 14: One Man&#x27;s Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West,&quot; written by Blaine Harden. In his book, he criticizes LiNK for excessively controlling his movements and appearances.

Current President/CEO Hannah Song and Director of Research &amp; Strategy Sokeel Park have each been hosted individually by TED. Joseph Kim, one of LiNK&#x27;s first rescued refugees, also appeared at TED Global in June 2013. In a speech that reached more than one million viewers, he spoke about his life in North Korea during the famine of the 1990s, the family he lost and gained, and the power of hope.

Adding a hard research edge to the more emotional narratives of North Korean escapees, Sokeel Park has been interviewed by major media outlets on topics regarding North Korea, and cited in &quot;The Economist&quot;. His writings have included &quot;China&#x27;s better route for North Korean refugees&quot; and &quot;Kim Jong-eun prepares balancing act&quot; for &quot;Asia Times Online&quot; and &quot;How to Build on Growing NKHR Interest&quot; for &quot;Daily NK&quot;.

In March 2019, LiNK founder Adrian Hong was identified in Spanish court documents as Adrian Hong Chang, the leader of an assault on the North Korean embassy in Madrid on February 21, 2019. LiNK responded to the controversy around this event with a statement to NK News: &quot;Adrian Hong was a co-founder of Liberty in North Korea as a college student but has had no involvement with the organization for over ten years. We have no knowledge of his recent activities, and we have no information on the Madrid Embassy incident other than what has been published by the media.&quot;

LiNK publishes news and analysis via its blog and Facebook page. In addition, financially oriented annual reports are published each year, and this financial data is confirmed by GuideStar, a third-party charity monitoring service.

<doc id="1247634" wikidata="Q326178" url="?curid=1247634" title="J. R. Simplot">
<text>John Richard Simplot (; January 4, 1909 – May 25, 2008) was an American entrepreneur and businessman best known as the founder of the J. R. Simplot Company, a Boise, Idaho–based agricultural supplier specializing in potato products. In 2007, he was estimated to be the 89th-richest person in the United States, at $3.6 billion. At the time of his death at age 99 in May 2008, he was the oldest billionaire on the Forbes 400.

==Early life==
Born in Dubuque, Iowa, he was the third of six children of Charles R. and Dorothy (Haxby) Simplot. His maternal grandmother was English, as were both parents of both his maternal grandfather and paternal grandmother. His paternal great-grandparents were both French.

A year later in 1910, the family relocated a thousand miles (1,600 km) west to homestead in the newly irrigated Magic Valley of south central Idaho; the Minidoka Dam on the Snake River was completed a few years earlier. After differences with his father, Simplot left school in the eighth grade at age 14 in 1923. He then worked on a farm near Declo, Cassia County, Idaho. He developed a low-cost method for feeding hogs when the market fell, feeding wild horse meat and potatoes to his hogs. When the market recovered he sold at a profit and got into the potato and vegetable processing business.

==J. R. Simplot Company==

By World War II, the J. R. Simplot Company had become the largest shipper of fresh potatoes in the nation.

In 1967, Simplot and McDonald&#x27;s founder Ray Kroc agreed by handshake that the Simplot Company would provide frozen french fries to the restaurant chain. Previously, restaurants had cut potatoes at each location for fresh french fries, but the favored russet potato was not available for three months in the summer, leading to a quality control problem. Simplot was able to supply frozen russet potatoes all year long. By 1972, all fries were frozen. The frozen fry deal led to expansion of Simplot potato processing plants and construction in 1977 of a new plant at Hermiston, Oregon. By 2005, Simplot supplied more than half of all french fries for the fast food chain. Simplot also produces fertilizers for agriculture.

Simplot retired as president of his company in 1973, but remained as chairman until 1994. He held the title of chairman emeritus until his death in 2008. Simplot received an honorary degree from Utah State University in Logan in 2001, honoring him for his many contributions to the agricultural industry of America, particularly the Intermountain West.

Simplot was responsible for the Potato Bust of 1976, after making massive short plays he refused to honor those contracts. This resulted in millions in dollars of losses for the New York Merchant Exchange. A public outcry followed, and the newly created Commodity Futures Trading Commission held hearings.

Further enhancing his enormous wealth, the J.R. Simplot Company provided startup capital in the early 1980s for the fledgling Micron Technology, a Boise-based manufacturer of computer memory chips; in 1994, he owned a 20% stake in the company. Additionally, he invested heavily in Remington Oil.

In 1961, Simplot financed the Brundage Mountain ski area near McCall, two hours north of Boise. The Simplot Company sold its 50% interest in Brundage in April 2006 to the longtime co-owner, the DeBoer family. In the early 1950s, Simplot was the benefactor to the fledgling Bogus Basin ski area near Boise when it had financial difficulties; the base area lodge is named in his honor.

In 1995, the J.R. Simplot Company expanded into Australia, acquiring iconic food brands like Birds Eye, Leggo&#x27;s, Chiko, and Edgell.

Simplot&#x27;s first marriage was to Ruby Rosevear (1911–2004) of Glenns Ferry, whom he had met on a ; he proposed to her in his Model A Ford in 1931. After 29 years and four children, the marriage ended in divorce in 1960, when she suddenly left Simplot for another man. Years later, Simplot admitted that while he was growing his business empire in the 1950s, he had not spent enough time with his family.

He and his second wife, Esther Becker (born 1934), a former opera singer, met in the mid-1960s in New York. He was on a business trip and she was working as a receptionist for the Henry Phipps Foundation; they were married in 1972.

Before his death, Simplot and his wife Esther resided in the Grove Hotel building in downtown Boise, a few blocks from the company&#x27;s headquarters. The couple donated their hilltop home, in Boise&#x27;s north end, to the state of Idaho in late 2004 for use as a governor&#x27;s mansion. (Known as &quot;The Idaho House,&quot; it was returned to the Simplot family in 2013, and demolished in January 2016.)

==Accident==
On January 1, 2007, while attending the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, with his wife and son, Simplot fell from a motorized scooter and suffered a cranial hematoma. He was taken to St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix, where he spent his 98th birthday. Simplot returned to Idaho several days later for further rehabilitation.

==Death==
Simplot died suddenly at his home at age 99 on May 25, 2008, with his wife at his side, following a bout of pneumonia from which he appeared to be recovering. His death occurred moments after he had invited a friend to his home to play cards.

Simplot was survived by his wife, two sons, Don and Scott, and his daughter, Gay, who was the first wife of politician Butch Otter. His eldest son, Richard, died in 1993 at age 59. He was interred at Morris Hill Cemetery in Boise.

In 1996, Simplot was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

<doc id="1247645" wikidata="Q902584" url="?curid=1247645" title="David Burke (British actor)">
<text>David Burke (born 25 May 1934) is an English actor, known for playing Dr. John Watson in the initial series of Granada Television&#x27;s 1980s &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which starred Jeremy Brett in the title role. He also starred as Joseph Stalin in the last two episodes of &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot;.

==Early life==
Burke was born on 25 May 1934 in Liverpool, England, and trained at Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

==Career==
In the theatre, Burke originated the part of Niels Bohr in Michael Frayn&#x27;s &quot;Copenhagen&quot;.

Burke played Dr. Watson in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; for the initial series and then left the programme after receiving an invitation to join the Royal Shakespeare Company along with his wife, Anna. They both considered the joint work to be the best idea for their young son, Tom, who was around 3 years old at the time. He was thought by many to portray Dr. Watson with an excellent style. He was replaced by Edward Hardwicke, whom he had recommended as his successor. Burke had earlier experience with Holmes having played the villain in an adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet&quot; for the 1965 BBC series starring Douglas Wilmer and Nigel Stock.

Other notable TV appearances include his turn as Joseph Stalin in the British serial &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot; and the John Wyndham science fiction story &quot;Random Quest&quot;. He also played William Morris in the 1975 series &quot;The Love School&quot;. Burke frequently portrays Johannes Coenradus Klene in the Dutch commercials for Klene liquorice. He appeared with his son, Tom Burke, in the 2006 BBC adaptation of the M.R. James ghost story, &quot;Number 13&quot;. He appeared with his wife, Anna Calder-Marshall, in the 2018 short film &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;. He was also in an episode of Midsomer Murders

==Personal life==
Burke is married to Anna Calder-Marshall. Their son Tom Burke is also an actor. Burke is an Everton supporter.

<text>The Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri) is a species of tortoise in the family Testudinidae. The species &quot;G. berlandieri&quot; is one of six species of tortoises that are native to North America.

==Geographic range==
&quot;G. berlandieri&quot; is found from southern Texas southward into the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas.

==Etymology==
The specific epithet, &quot;berlandieri&quot;, is in honor of naturalist Jean Louis Berlandier, who worked for the Mexican government on one of the first biological surveys of Texas. As such, some sources refer to it as Berlandier&#x27;s tortoise.

==Biology==
The Texas tortoise, unlike other species of gopher tortoise, is not an adept burrower. Its preferred habitat is dry scrub and grasslands. Succulent plants, a preferred food of the Texas tortoise, are common in these areas. It especially likes the fruit of cacti such as the prickly pear.

==Conservation status==
Though considered an animal of low concern by the IUCN Red List, the Texas tortoise is listed as a threatened species in the state of Texas, and thus protected by state law. It is illegal to collect or possess them. The Mexican federal government lists &quot;Gopherus berlandieri&quot; as A (= Threatened) in Mexico. Likewise, using Environmental Vulnerability Scores, &quot;Gopherus berlandieri&quot; scored 18, a high vulnerability species on a scale of 0–20, in evaluations of both Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon herpetofauna. In 2018, the IUCN Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group recommended a re-assessment and re-classification of all six &quot;Gopherus&quot; species. This reclassification would move &quot;G. berlandieri&quot; from Near Endangered (NE) to Near Threatened (NT).

<doc id="1247651" wikidata="Q3641072" url="?curid=1247651" title="Bloodshot (The J. Geils Band album)">
<text>Bloodshot is the third studio album by American rock band The J. Geils Band. The album was released on April 12, 1973, by Atlantic Records. It was the breakthrough release for the band, reaching #10 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; album chart in the United States, a peak that the band would not surpass until their 1981 multi-platinum album &quot;Freeze Frame&quot;. The single version of &quot;Give it to Me&quot;, which had a very different ending from the album version, reached #30 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; and #15 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100.

Original US vinyl copies of &quot;Bloodshot&quot; were issued using red vinyl instead of the customary black, and utilized matching red 1950s style Atlantic Records labels. The band would continue to use these vintage-style Atlantic labels, in different colors with each album release, throughout their remaining tenure with the label.

<text>The [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] EOS 650 is a 35 mm single-lens reflex camera. It was introduced on 2 March 1987, Canon&#x27;s 50th anniversary,
and discontinued in February 1989. 
It was the first camera in Canon&#x27;s new EOS series, which was designed from scratch to support autofocus lenses. The EOS system features the new EF lens mount, which uses electrical signals to communicate between the camera and the lens.
Focusing and aperture control are performed by electric motors mounted in the lens body. The EF mount is still used on Canon SLRs, including digital models. Canon&#x27;s previous FD mount lenses are incompatible with EOS bodies.

Canon&#x27;s first EOS camera had the latest technologies, including a microprocessor and a Canon-developed BASIS sensor for high-precision AF. Canon claimed incomparable autofocusing for the EOS 650. A range of high-precision ultrasonic motor EF autofocus lenses were also developed successfully for the 650.

An EOS 650 was used in 1992 to take the first photographic image that was uploaded on the World Wide Web, a picture of the band Les Horribles Cernettes.

The EOS 5D Mark III DSLR was announced on the 25th anniversary of the announcement of the EOS 650.

==Variants==

The more advanced EOS 620 followed in May 1987, and the EOS 630/600 in March 1989. The 620 was equipped with LCD backlight, multiple exposure and auto-bracketing capability, and a higher flash sync speed of 1/250 and shutter speed of 1/4000. The 630/600 was the first EOS camera sold with different names in different markets (630 in Japan and USA, 600 in Europe) and the first available in multiple colors (the 630 in black or &quot;metallic gray&quot;, the 600 only in &quot;metallic gray&quot;). All 630/600 models have faster autofocus with &quot;focus prediction&quot;, 7 custom functions (including options for back-button focus and film leader out), 7 Programmed Image Control (PIC) modes and 5 frames per second film transport, an improvement from the 650&#x27;s 3 fps. The Canon EOS RT is a pellicle mirror version of the EOS 630 with 8ms shutter lag and an additional eight custom functions (15 in total). Only 25,000 RT bodies were made.

<text>Cecilia Veronica &quot;CeCe&quot; Peniston (; born September 6, 1969) is an American singer and former beauty queen. In the early 1990s, she scored five number one hits on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play. Her signature song &quot;Finally&quot; reached the number 5 spot on the Hot 100 and number 2 in the UK Top 75.

Peniston has performed at private engagements for Aretha Franklin&#x27;s private birthday party in Detroit, Michigan, Pope John Paul II in Rome at the Vatican (as a member of the gospel band Sisters of Glory) and the 42nd President of the United States, Bill Clinton, during both of his inauguration ceremonies in Washington, D.C. She was the first foreign female entertainer to perform in post-apartheid South Africa. According to Peniston, her vocal range vacillates between &quot;five to seven octaves&quot;.

In February 2011, Peniston signed a record deal with West Swagg Music Group/Bungalo Records, with full distribution through Universal Music Group Distribution, and announced release of a new solo album 15 years after her last studio set (&quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot; from 1996 on A&amp;M Records). By the end of the year, however, only three digital singles had been issued including a new song called &quot;Stoopid!&quot;, and two cover versions of her prior hits, &quot;Keep On Walkin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Finally&quot;.

In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine listed her among the 100 Top Dance Club Artists of All Time (as the 52nd).

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Peniston was born in Dayton, Ohio, but spent the majority of her formative years in Phoenix, Arizona, where she was raised from the age of nine. She is the third of four siblings. The daughter of Ronald Peniston, a military veteran and Barbara Anne, she started singing at church and doing plays and musicals such as &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in the 6th grade. She participated in local karaoke contests and singing talent shows, while taking piano lessons.

She attended Trevor G. Browne High School, class of 1987, in Phoenix, and landed a part in a local theater group&#x27;s production of &quot;Bubblin&#x27; Brown Sugar&quot; (playing the young Sweet Georgia Brown). After earning her diploma, she continued to study liberal arts at Phoenix College, where she got involved in athletics, and entered beauty pageants. She was crowned Miss Black Arizona in 1989.

Peniston began writing pop lyrics while at school. The words of her international hit &quot;Finally&quot; were penned during a chemistry class, while thinking about dating in college.

===1990–91: &quot;Female Preacher&quot;===
Her music career began in January 1991, when Felipe &quot;DJ Wax Dawg&quot; Delgado, her friend and a record producer based also in Phoenix, asked Peniston to record back-up vocals for Tonya Davis, a black female rapper known as Overweight Pooch after her childhood nickname.

Davis, headed in a direction of a &quot;new&quot; Monie Love, was searching for a singer to add vocals to the title track of her album &quot;Female Preacher&quot;, which was to be released on A&amp;M Records that summer. At a talent show she met a woman named Malaika LeRae Sallard, but when it came time to get Sallard into the studio, the rapper found she&#x27;d lost her future label-mate&#x27;s number. When Delgado, who&#x27;d preferred Peniston instead, brought his favorite in to do background parts, the response from everyone was immediate, but did not move the Pooch to invite Peniston back for more vocals – unless she was successful in locating Sallard.

Later, as it became clear that Peniston was leaping from the Overweight Pooch&#x27;s album to the top of the charts, rumor had it the Pooch was stewing over Peniston&#x27;s using &quot;Female Preacher&quot; as her springboard. Tonya Davis, pregnant at the time of recording her album, swore she harbored no jealousy towards Peniston. &quot;There&#x27;s no jealousy, because she has a voice. I gave her the chance, but I didn&#x27;t give her a voice,&quot; the rapper insisted for &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; in July 1992, and Peniston, interviewed by the same newspaper in the meantime, reacted by her own words. &quot;I feel like anything&#x27;s possible and I know one thing. If I wasn&#x27;t at this spot, I still would be achieving to get to this spot.&quot; Ironically enough, Sallard eventually threw in a few back-up vocals for Peniston on a song with a significant title, &quot;You Win, I Win, We Lose&quot;, while Peniston, who in return played an agent to get a record deal also for Malaika (whose album &quot;Sugar Time&quot; scored in 1993 two Top 5 hits on the US Dance chart, including the No. 1 single &quot;Gotta Know (Your Name)&quot;) mentioned the Pooch&#x27;s name on her own debut album in addition, leaving Davis a note saying &quot;thanks for letting me be a part of Female Preacher&quot;.

Besides Peniston&#x27;s vocal performance on three tracks in total, of which &quot;I Like It&quot; was released as a single with a moderate success (at #16 in US Dance and #58 in UK Top 75 the following January), she was eventually given also a credit for co-writing two of those, &quot;Kickin&#x27; Da Blues&quot; and the title&#x27;s, &quot;Female Preacher&quot;. But the Overweight Pooch&#x27;s album flopped on the market, and A&amp;M was the first major label for Delgado himself, who was facing contractual disputes with the record company. After Manny Lehman (a DJ, then A&amp;M Art Director and one of the executive producers of &quot;Female Preacher&quot;) also noticed the powerful voice of a still back-up vocalist, he offered Delgado a second chance, and commissioned him to produce a track for Peniston herself as a solo artist. Not looking to lose his major deal connections, Delgado called on music producer Rodney K. Jackson, who she had met through mutual friends in Arizona, who was brought to the A&amp;M family to help co-produce Peniston&#x27;s single, which was soon to be recognized as &quot;Finally&quot;.

Despite an initial label&#x27;s resistance to sign Peniston to more than a one-off single deal, the &quot;Finally&quot; session resulted in recording her own debut album after the final approval of A&amp;M&#x27;s Vice President, Mark Mazzetti.

===1991–92: &quot;Finally&quot;===
Peniston was 21 years old when her debut single &quot;Finally&quot; was released. The song burst on to the US club scene in the fall of 1991, where it became an instant dance anthem peaking, in October, at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play for two weeks, while achieving a respectful starting position (at No. 29) overseas.

After her first song climbed the international charts, Peniston was headed into the studio to record a full-length album. However, she &quot;had two months to pull the whole album together&quot; and &quot;didn&#x27;t realize the impact the record was having until it reached the top five&quot;. She also described how difficult it was to begin her career at such an extreme pace, but the result was a solidly produced ten track collection titled &quot;Finally&quot;, issued in January of the following year.

Both the single and album entered the US Hot 100, as well as the UK Top 75 chart (at No. 5 and No. 2 for single, respectively at No. 70 and at No. 10 for album release), and ultimately earned Peniston a gold or silver certification in both countries. By the end of 1992 her debut (in Europe re-released in 1997 with a bonus remix &quot;Finally &#x27;97&quot;) sold over 540,000 in United States.

&quot;We Got a Love Thang&quot;, the second single (co-written by Chantay Savage), with a video clip in heavy rotation on TV music channels, went to No. 1 in the US Dance chart in February (No. 20 in the Hot 100), and in England (where &quot;Finally&quot; skipped to No. 2 eventually) &quot;We Got a Love Thang&quot; peaked at No. 6. Who provided backing vocals on the album remains a source of contention. While on her album &quot;Finally&quot; Darnnel Rush was credited, on its single release, the name of Kym Sims (who was a co-writer of &quot;Keep On Walkin&#x27;&quot;) appeared as one of back-up vocalists.

With another hit record on the charts, Peniston began a year of touring clubs and small theaters in the US in support of her album. Her travels started with a series of shows in the Philippines, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Italy, and after her return to the US, Peniston continued with such R&amp;B acts as Joe Public, the Cover Girls, R. Kelly and LeVert.
While on tour, &quot;Keep On Walkin&#x27;&quot;, a hip hop swinging composition, joined the list of Peniston&#x27;s three consecutively running hits, bringing Peniston in June her third No. 1 in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart (No. 15 in the Hot 100), and another Top 10 hit in UK. Later in August, that was also her highest outing in the US R&amp;B chart, scoring at No. 3.

On October 17, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine announced that Peniston was the leading nominee in the Billboard Music Awards, being nominated in four categories: three times in the dance category with &quot;Finally&quot; (Best New Artist, Best Female Artist and Best Director), and one in the R&amp;B/Rap category (Best Female Artist) for her urban hit &quot;Keep On Walkin&#x27;&quot;. Ultimately the song won two awards, and three of her singles released in 1992 were listed also within the Top 100 songs of the Billboard Year-End chart (at No. 20 with &quot;Finally&quot;, at No. 61 with &quot;Keep On Walkin&#x27;&quot;, and at No. 97 with &quot;We Got a Love Thang&quot;). In the UK, Peniston was listed as the 20th of Top Selling Singles Artists in 1992.

Additional songs taken from album &quot;Finally&quot; achieved the Top 40 status at least in the hip hop/R&amp;B field. The grieving lyrics of her ballad &quot;Inside That I Cried&quot;, co-written by Peniston&#x27;s then-husband, Malik Byrd (who appeared also in its video), and produced in conjunction with Anita Baker&#x27;s cohort, Steve Lindsey, peaked at No. 10 in the US R&amp;B (No. 94 in the Hot 100 and No. 42 in UK Top 75). The fifth single, a midtempo, &quot;Crazy Love&quot;, climbed to No. 31 (No. 97 in the Hot 100 and No. 44 in UK).

By the end of the year, Peniston received several awards for her achievements in the music industry for 1992. Among them, one Billboard Music Award (as Best New Artist – Dance, the second went to the video director Claude Borenzweig), three ASCAP Awards (for Song of The Year, Most Performed Song of The Year, and Pop Songwriter of The Year), another three awards (as Best New Dance Artist, Best Dance Solo Artist, and for Best 12&quot; Dance Record) at the Annual Winter Music Conference, and the BMI Urban Award of Achievement. The album itself was nominated on a Soul Train Music Award &#x27;93 in the Best R&amp;B/Soul Album – Female category.

===1993–95: &quot;Thought &#x27;Ya Knew&quot;===
Within a year, Peniston was back in the studios to record her sophomore release, and the particular challenge for the vocalist was to avoid getting pigeonholed into the dance genre. For that reason, several ballads were arranged to appear on the final set (in the front with &quot;Forever In My Heart&quot;, produced by Brian McKnight), of which, however, none was chosen for a single release. This time around, Peniston co-authored three of thirteen tracks (&quot;Whatever It Is&quot;, &quot;Give What I&#x27;m Givin&quot; and &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s The Way&quot;, a ballad about her father), and along with Manny Lehman and Damon Jones, who later became Peniston&#x27;s manager, she was also credited as an executive producer of her scheduled album release, &quot;Thought &#x27;Ya Knew&quot;. Apart from others, also fellow Ohio-born singer Norma Jean Wright joined the session.

After a certain level of hesitation over the first single, &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood&quot; (originally produced by Soulshock and Karlin) was picked to be the final leader—though as support for &quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot;, which would be separately delivered on vinyl only to DJs. &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood&quot; did well by itself, and with a video accompanied by a hip-hop remix from M-Doc &amp; Jere M.C. (better known as In Da Soul) the title was on singles reproduced by David Morales for the dance floor. The song spawned Peniston&#x27;s fourth No. 1 (dethroning from the top of the US Dance chart Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;A Deeper Love&quot;) and peaked at No. 16 in UK (#32 in the Hot 100).

On January 25, 1994, the album &quot;Thought &#x27;Ya Knew&quot;, which was to represent Peniston&#x27;s musical zenith at that time, arrived on all available formats, including digital compact cassettes. However, as the record promptly entered the music charts, it was soon to be evident &quot;Thought &#x27;Ya Knew&quot; was not enjoying the high-profile success of her previous set &quot;Finally&quot;. After its progress had stalled in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 96, &quot;Thought &#x27;Ya Knew&quot; climbed to No. 31 in the UK, but the album charted for only two weeks in the UK.

Not certain about the second single either, &quot;Keep Givin&#x27; Me Your Love&quot; was accepted to become the British follow-up. But the track, remixed by Eddie Gordon&#x27;s West End production team, had no supporting music video, and after peaking at No. 36 in April in the United Kingdom, an alternative title (&quot;I&#x27;m Not Over You&quot;) was chosen for the US market as the second cut from the &quot;Thought &#x27;Ya Knew&quot; album.

&quot;I&#x27;m Not Over You&quot; (written by Steve Hurley, Jamie Principle, and M-Doc) might have missed the highest position of the US Dance chart, but only by about one point (at No. 2), and the single was later classified in the overall &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart as the ninth most successful track of 1994 (leaving &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood&quot; far behind, at #44). However, although the song had sealed the Top 10 of the US R&amp;B chart, it did not succeed in the Hot 100 that much, failing to crack Top 40 (No. 41). Considering that expectations of A&amp;M Records company must have been bigger than a club play sale of Peniston&#x27;s singles, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Over You&quot; was released in UK only on B-side of the &quot;Hit by Love&quot; release.

&quot;Hit by Love&quot; was to be the third song taken from the album. As with her previous releases, the song (with additional remixes by David Morales) became Peniston&#x27;s next US Dance hit in a line of her No. 1s, but while on the top of the chart &quot;Hit by Love&quot; stayed for another week, the single stuck at No. 33 in the UK Top 75, as well as on the bottom positions of the American Hot 100 chart (at No. 90).

Along with &quot;Hit by Love&quot; in the charts, A&amp;M issued a rare compilation, &quot;Remix Collection&quot;, in Japan with nine alternate versions of her songs previously available only on vinyl, which tracked Peniston&#x27;s music career since the &quot;Keep On Walkin&#x27;&quot; release. A similar remix collection, however, consisting of only two singles (&quot;Finally&quot; and &quot;We Got a Love Thang&quot;), was earlier issued in Japan as an EP under the title &quot;Finally / We Got a Love Thang: Remix Collection&quot; featuring overall eight remixed versions.

At the end of the year Peniston was named the No. 1 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play Artist, summarizing all her songs released in 1994 (&quot;I&#x27;m Not Over You&quot; #9, &quot;Hit by Love&quot; #24, and I&#x27;m in the Mood&quot; #44). While A&amp;M was listed as the sixth best dance label in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End chart, Peniston was also rated as the 5th Top R&amp;B Singles Female Artist (behind Janet Jackson, Toni Braxton, Aaliyah and Mariah Carey).

In addition, a remix of &quot;Keep Givin&#x27; Me Your Love&quot; was popularized on the original motion picture soundtrack of the &quot;Prêt-à-Porter (Ready To Wear)&quot; film, and released in the U.S. after a one-year delay, scoring No. 4 in the US Dance charts in March 1995. &quot;Keep Givin&#x27; Me Your Love&quot; became Peniston&#x27;s first song not to enter the Hot 100 chart (No. 101), possibly as the result of appearing as a B-side on her previous release, and sharing its sales with the single &quot;Hit by Love&quot;.
;The Sisters of Glory
Between releases, Peniston made a jazzy cameo &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Love&quot; with words and music by a Grammy Award-nominated composer, Jeff Lorber, and Eric Benét (also a later Grammy Award nominee) for his album &quot;West Side Stories&quot;. The title of the Lorber&#x27;s album was his response to residing the West Side of L.A. (not an adaptation of songs from the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;), and after its issue in November 1994, the studio record peaked at No. 5 in the &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; list of Top Contemporary Jazz albums.

As a member of the gospel quintet called The Sisters of Glory, which included Thelma Houston, Phoebe Snow, Lois Walden, Albertina Walker, and herself, Peniston also recorded a spiritual album, &quot;Good News in Hard Times&quot;, that featured two solo traditionals (&quot;How I Got Over&quot; and &quot;Precious Memories&quot;) performed by Peniston, four standards with her solo part (&quot;Rough Side of the Mountain&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot;, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Be Back No More&quot; and &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot;), as well as her chorus vocals on additional nine tracks. &quot;Good News in Hard Times&quot; (produced by Jennifer Cohen and Lois Walden) was released in August 1995 on Warner Bros, and the album brought Peniston an entry also in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Gospel Albums list, where it reached in October No. 29, remaining in the chart for 6 weeks.

===1996–98: &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot; and &quot;The Best Of&quot; album===
In February 1996, &quot;Billboard&quot; posted information that singer was putting the finishing touches to her new studio album, &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot;, slated for its release in May. Judging from the magazine&#x27;s earlier preview of several cuts, &quot;Billboard&quot; published that Peniston was about to explore more mature jeep-soul fare a la Faith Evans, and that she has never sounded so assured and convincingly soulful. Though &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot; with a noticeably slimmed-down Peniston adorning its cover was not released until September, a similarly sleek sound marked its title single delivered to the radio stations on July 17, while hitting music stores one week later.

&quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;, the song considered as the strongest track to reach core R&amp;B listeners with potential across several genres, was produced by Dave &quot;Jam&quot; Hall, the hit maker behind Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Dreamlover&quot;, whose earlier work included also Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; album. The song cracked the Top 40 on the US R&amp;B/Hip Hop at No. 29, but failed to show up in the UK chart, while scoring at weak No. 83 in the Hot 100.

On September 9, &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot;, the record with evident absence of her ever-dependable club workouts finally arrived. Peniston contributed to the set with three songs she co-wrote (except the title track, the ballad &quot;The Last To Know&quot; and a club potential, &quot;Don&#x27;t Know What To Do&quot;, that was not promoted). After peaking at No. 48 on the US R&amp;B, the album passed by the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Albums chart, and soon largely fell victim to mismarketing.

Despite insistence from the Peniston&#x27;s management to release &quot;Somebody Else&#x27;s Guy&quot; as a follow-up, A&amp;M label preferred an alternate composition, &quot;Before I Lay (You Drive Me Crazy)&quot;, which featured Peniston&#x27;s then-beau JoJo Hailey (of K-Ci &amp; JoJo) who was supposed to help establish Peniston as an R&amp;B artist. But the duet reached its top in the US R&amp;B already at No. 52, with no entry in the Hot 100 chart (No. 121) or in England.

However, Peniston herself seemed to be not worried about losing her audience, when interviewed at the time of &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot; release by &quot;Billboard: &quot;When you&#x27;re first coming out as an artist, many times label executives have their own vision for you. But as you move forward, it&#x27;s only fair that you begin determining your own direction. People will make the change with you as long as you&#x27;re honest about your craft and display a comfort for what it is that you&#x27;re doing,&quot;&quot; two years later Peniston actually confirmed her doubts, after being questioned by the magazine: &quot;I can speak about this firsthand, believe me. Sometimes doing what you feel isn&#x27;t always accepted by the public. You&#x27;ve got to choose where you want to go and be consistent,&quot; (said by the artist at the 5th annual Billboard Dance Music Summit that urged members of the dance music community to work together toward greater credibility, visibility and sales for the genre, held July 8–10 in 1998).
After only two singles released from her R&amp;B set, A&amp;M did not decide to select a song that would cater to another music format, and capitulated to progress with &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot; album that Peniston promoted also during Bill Clinton&#x27;s election campaign, on which she performed several track from the set. Clinton commented on her performance on November 4, 1996 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, mentioning: &quot;I want to thank CeCe Peniston for singing so beautifully.&quot;

Following her dismissal, Peniston took playing as Glinda the Good Witch in a theatrical production of musical play &quot;The Wiz&quot;. The staged concert was opened at Oakland&#x27;s Paramount Theatre for a five-day run on June 11, 1997, and besides herself, Grace Jones and Peabo Bryson appeared to act.

In September, A&amp;M re-released the single &quot;Finally&quot; that re-entered the UK Top 75 (No. 26), and also her debut album on CD enhanced with the new remix, Finally (Classic Funk Radio Mix), both re-issued only in the overseas.

In February 1998, a David Morales remix of &quot;Somebody Else&#x27;s Guy&quot;, originally popularized by Jocelyn Brown and recorded for the album &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot;, became a hit in Europe, where it reached No. 13 in the UK Top 75 (as her last entry to date in England), as well as in April No. 26 in Japan, after being picked to promote Peniston&#x27;s import greatest-hits collection simply titled &quot;The Best Of&quot;. The black and white photographs for its booklet were done by Daniela Federici, whose art work was noticed already on &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot; release, and later also on album and single covers of other female recording artists, such as Céline Dion, Toni Braxton, or Pink.

After her departure from A&amp;M Peniston contributed with two songs to the M.C. Magic&#x27;s compilation of various Phoenix-based artists called &quot;Desert Funk!&quot; that was issued on Nastyboy Records. The first title, &quot;I Know You Want Me&quot;, was a hip-hop duet recorded in common with Nastyboy Klick (#109 on the US R&amp;B), while the second, a Latino hip-hop ballad, &quot;When I&#x27;m with You&quot; was her own solo track also produced by Marcus Cardenas.

===1998–2000: Cancelled &quot;Nobody Else&quot; album===

Rumors about Peniston working in Chicago on a new album with Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley sprang up after &quot;Nobody Else&quot;, a gospel-infused sirene and her debut on the producer&#x27;s label, saw its official release in 1998. However, apart from the &quot;Billboard&quot;, the inlay details of &quot;Nobody Else&quot; also informed her fan base a studio album with the same title was due that summer, this information seemed to be rather optional than reality that followed the artist&#x27;s future, while she had been signed to the Silk Entertainment company.

To make things surrounding her potential comeback even worse, ferocious house groove &quot;Nobody Else&quot;, which was premiered at the 5th Annual Billboard Dance Music Summit on the stage at the Green Dolphin Street, failed to enter the music charts, despite favorable reviews of the &quot;Billboard&quot; that rated the song &quot;&quot;among the artist&#x27;s strongest recordings&quot;, &quot;a sure to-thrill die hards&quot;,&quot; and as &quot;a triumphant return to clubland&quot; commenting in addition her summit live performance.

In 1999, &quot;He Loves Me 2&quot;, co-written by M-Doc (known for a remix production for such major artists as Madonna, Janet Jackson or Keitha Sweat) to whom the singer returned the favor providing background vocals on &quot;Keep It Real&quot;, a song recorded for his own album &quot;Young, Black, Rich and Famous&quot;, seemed to bring more competitive results than her previous endeavor, reaching No. 24 on the Hot Dance Club Play.

But Peniston&#x27;s next single, &quot;My Boo&quot;, with then already Grammy Award-nominee Hurley (apart from other five remixes for another artists, also for his own &#x27;Silk&#x27;s 12&quot; Mix&#x27; of &quot;He Loves Me 2&quot;, eventually lost in favor of Peter Rauhofer alias Club 69, who became the Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical, in 2000) happened to become disappointing again for both actually, and the last act distributed through the producer&#x27;s record company. The song contained a sample of &quot;The Bottle&quot; by Gil Scott-Heron, one of the most important progenitors of rap music, at that time imprisoned for one to three years following series of drug possession charges.

===2000–present: Singles era===
====&quot;Lifetime to Love&quot;====
While looking for alternative options for the cancelled production of her album, Peniston decided to make a step back and record a cover version of &quot;Lifetime to Love&quot;, written by Steven Nikolas and Brendon Sibley, for her ex-major label producer and the Manny Lehman&#x27;s compilation &quot;Circuit Sessions 00.1&quot;. The composition almost revived her No. 1 status in February 2001, returning her into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play list, and delivering her a Top 3 entry also in the millennium (No. 2). Although the song was at the end of the year classified as the 30th most successful US Dance track of 2001, it did not enter the official Hot 100 chart.

The digital version of &quot;Lifetime to Love&quot; was to be offered, along with photos and other information regarding Peniston, for free of charge download via Napster, an online music file-sharing service. Timing prevented the deal&#x27;s follow-through, unfortunately, and singer left 4 Play label afterwards.

====&quot;Reminiscin&quot;====
Following the millennium Peniston, no longer part of the mainstream that brought her success in the early &#x27;90s, spent the first decade supporting numerous recording artists of various musical styles and influences who would keep her in the music industry and in the public eye mostly as a guest, but prominent vocalist.
In 2001, she collaborated with Ella Mae Saison, a singer from Philippines, on a common track. The duet partially mixed in France, and partially in N.Y.C., was sponsored by a multiple world-champion boxer, Evander Holyfield, and released on his record label in April. After its slow start, while being classified as the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Breakout No. 1 for Maxi-Singles Sales category, the song hit No. 30 in US Dance chart eventually on August 18, under title &quot;Reminiscin&quot; and with Peniston being credited as a featuring artist.

Peniston later commented on her recording with Saison, &quot;I had the pleasure of working with a very talented and inspiring artist by the name of Saison. Last January 2001, we collaborated on a duet, Reminiscin. I was fortunate to witness the warmth of a beautiful personality and the great talent of a rising star. I hope the world will be allowed to share in this experience too.&quot;

====&quot;For My Baby&quot; and &quot;Colour of My Soul&quot;====
Accompanied by a line-up of seven other female vocalists coming from both sides of the Atlantic, she joined Rob Derbyshire and Paul &#x27;Solomon&#x27; Mullings, the Birmingham&#x27;s R&amp;B production duo known as Full Flava, to record lead vocals for their album &quot;Colour of My Soul&quot;. The modern soul set was to be made in England, released on Dôme Records in 2003, and one of the compositions performed by Peniston, &quot;For My Baby&quot;, was later given also a treatment for the dance floor with stand-out house mixes from Dave &quot;Leggz&quot; Longmore and Sam Junior Bromfield known as Ruff &#x27;N&#x27; Tumble, and duo KT &amp; C.

&quot;For My Baby&quot; did not succeed on the music charts, however Ruf N Tumble&#x27;s dance remixes of the song were based on a sample of the Delegation hit single &quot;Heartache No. 9&quot; (that scored at number fifty-seven in US Dance in 1980). Her second solo number on the Full Flava&#x27;s compilation &quot;Colour of My Soul&quot; was titled &quot;I Think about Him&quot;, and it was a mid-tempo that Peniston co-wrote with Derbyshire and Mullings.

====&quot;Eternal Lover&quot;====
Her next steps afterwards led to Better Days Studios in Paris where, for a change, singer was supposed to work with a French producer, Fréderic Tharreau alias BIBI, on exclusively import single &quot;Eternal Lover&quot;. In addition to being released in France on RLPMix Records, the song was also issued in Australia and New Zealand on the domestic premier dance label, Vinyl Pusher Records, in 2004.

====&quot;Gimme the Mike!&quot; and &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot;====
Back to the States on 2 June 2005, Peniston appeared on the NBC network as a contestant of the summer&#x27;s reality TV &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot;.
During each program five former pop stars would sing their biggest hit plus a cover version of one contemporary hit, and every week the winner, picked by the studio audience, would get a donation of $20,000 in their name to a charity of free choice. Peniston competed on the show performing &quot;Finally&quot; plus a Faith Hill&#x27;s song, &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be&quot;, in favor of a hip-hop group, Arrested Development (the final winner of the program that night). When two years later asked, while being interviewed by the &quot;Say What News&quot; online magazine, Peniston would not confirm to record &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be&quot; also in the studio.

====&quot;Pastor Jones&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch if You Ain&#x27;t Prayed&quot;====
In the first half of 2005, Peniston wrapped up shooting an independent film called &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch if You Ain&#x27;t Prayed&quot;. Her character was a forty-year-old Christian woman saving herself for marriage, and the film featured gospel music performed by herself. In addition, Peniston took a small part in another urban Gospel film appealing to Christian market, &quot;Pastor Jones&quot;.

On September 19, 2005, Peniston was invited to appear at Manhattan Center, Grand Ballroom, NYC, to be present at the 2nd Annual Dance Music Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, along with Wanda Dee (of KLF), Nile Rodgers, Freddie Jackson, and Kathy Sledge. The Dance Music Hall of Fame, created by veteran John Parker in 2003, was supposed to recognize the contributions of those, who have had a significant impact on the evolution and development of dance music, and celebrate the history and significance of the genre. An awards ceremony announcing the inductees in the event was to take place annually at a formal dinner event in New York, but due to financial differences among the Board members, the Dance Music Hall of Fame ceased operations after its second ceremony (in 2005).

====&quot;Deeper Love&quot;====
Peniston&#x27;s following music project was a common duet with David Longoria, a songwriter and trumpet player whose work was previously noticed on records of for example Sting and George Michael. The union became successful when a composition combining jazz and dance music, &quot;Deeper Love&quot;, written and produced by Longoria, after six weeks on the chart climbed to No. 14 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play (on November 19), returning Peniston lost dance chart positions since another duet number (&quot;Reminiscin&quot;) from 2001. The single was released with the copyright owned by Del Oro Music, and included eleven remixes from Junior Vasquez, Ryan Humphries, L.E.X., and Richard Earnshaw. According to David Longoria&#x27;s official web site, the newest radio version of &quot;Deeper Love - Robert Eibach Mix&quot; is directed at Rhythmic Radio and dance clubs and was released in August 2024.

====&quot;You Are the Universe&quot; and &quot;Music Is Our Way of Life&quot;====
Interviewed by &quot;5 Chicago&quot; magazine in June 2006, singer stated that she was, &quot;working on another album,&quot; with George Jackson (a former manager of the Silk Entertainment label), Tre, and Ron Carroll, and expressed her wish to work with Steve Hurley as well back again. She further calculated to be done &quot;within the next three or four months&quot; with her studio record.
Instead, Peniston co-wrote with Jackson single &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; for RaShaan Houston, and took part in another proto-D&#x27;vas project, produced by Full Flava, to which she contributed with a Brand New Heavies hit from 1997 (No. 21 in UK), &quot;You Are the Universe&quot;. Her cover version was attached to Full Flava&#x27;s retro album, &quot;Music Is Our Way of Life&quot;, which reconstructed eleven dancefloor classics in total, and the compilation was released on Dôme. The Peniston&#x27;s track was remixed by a Japanese producer, DJ Hasebe, to be featured in his disco medley named after the song, and for the purpose of a limited-edition single available only in Japan on vinyl.

====&quot;EP Live&quot; and &quot;Divas of Disco&quot;====
On April 25, 2007, her icon stood on the stage of Avalon, Hollywood on the occasion of a five star concert &quot;Divas of Disco – Live&quot;, which included Thelma Houston, Linda Clifford, A Taste of Honey, France Joli and herself. Each diva performed overall three songs as a solo artist, while Peniston was the main star closing the night. Her performances of &quot;Keep On Walkin&#x27;&quot;, the Donna Summer&#x27;s cover version of &quot;Last Dance&quot;, and &quot;Finally&quot; were released as a digital live EP on One Media Publishing the following year. The whole concert, titled &quot;Divas of Disco&quot;, was available in Europe on DVD on ZYX Music in 2008, as well as on CD in 2010, while in U.S. only its DVD release followed (on RSM Records in 2009).

====&quot;I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; U&quot;====
In 2007, Peniston teamed up with US house DJ Ron Carroll for a funky bomb, &quot;I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; U&quot;, which was released in May on the Soulfuric Recordings label. The song caught an attention in the European clubland (No. 2 in the DJ House chart) The four-track single included also additional mixes from a French, DJ Fudge, and Brian Tappert, but as with her previous Japanese release (&quot;You Are the Universe&quot;), &quot;I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; U&quot; was available for sale exclusively on vinyl, or as a digital single to be downloaded.

====&quot;Shame Shame Shame&quot;====
Her following promotional single, &quot;Shame Shame Shame&quot;, released in UK in June 2007, was co-written by Matt, Warren Meyers and Kelly Mueller, better recognized as Soulshaker (alias The Soul Shakers). The British music producers&#x27; team produced for Peniston a composition, which by the end of the year achieved several No. 1 statuses within specialized UK magazine charts (including No. 1 Music Week Pop Tip Chart, No. 1 Music Week Club Chart, and No. 1 DJ Mag Hype Chart). While in England Shame Shame Shame&quot; was issued on the AATW label, in the States the title was released on Trackworks Records in several promo editions.

On August 26, 2007, one year after her interview for &quot;5 Chicago Mag&quot;, Peniston mentioned again her plans regarding a new album project also for &quot;Say What News&quot;, however she did not go further this time. When asked, with whom from the industry she would like to once collaborate, she named the winner of twenty-two Grammy Awards, Stevie Wonder.

====&quot;Still I&quot;====

Originally, the potential release of an R&amp;B song after a lengthy absence, &quot;Still I&quot;, was to be cancelled, but the final record actually leaked out after one of the producers, allowed the Adrenaline Music company to distribute the song.
Behind the song&#x27;s production were recognized Peniston&#x27;s former folks from Arizona, Felipe Delgado and Jackson (both in charge of her initial hit, &quot;Finally&quot;, from 1991) who reunited in 2005 to form a new production crew, collectively known as SandWorx, altogether with Nick &quot;Cello&quot; Valentine (which joined them in the spring of the following year). Though Peniston herself, who supported the trio by performing live in the Next In club in Scottsdale, Arizona, did not consider the record as strong enough to be offered for sale, &quot;Still I&quot; was eventually released as a four-track virtual single in September 2007, and the session that was supposed to rejoin the former producers with Peniston ended up with an apparent contradiction. The rest of to date unreleased recordings are songs titled &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Next to Me&quot; and &quot;Right Here&quot;.

====&quot;Above Horizons&quot;====
However, the year of 2008 also passed with no significant news regarding her new solo studio project, the following June Peniston released &quot;Above Horizons&quot;, a national PTA anthem as a tribute to the families, teachers and communities who help children reach their dreams through the PTA, Parent Teacher Association, which resulted from her role being a National Ambassador of the US largest volunteer child advocacy organization. The ballad was written by Byron V. Garrett, Peniston, Erric Carrington, Essej and Marcus L. Barnum, and the CD promo release, issued on National PTA Recordings, included overall four versions. Among others, also two mixes from a Detroit house music producer and DJ, Aaron-Carl Ragland, who listed one of Peniston&#x27;s compositions (&quot;Nobody Else&quot; from 1998) as one of his musical influences.

On June 17, 2009, &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; interviewed the artist, who declared that after over a decade she was about to finish recording her comeback album. Although she did not concrete its release date, Peniston revealed that she was working with such likes as Track Kingz West, Vudu, Status (&quot;Above Horizons&quot;), David Givens, Montell Jordan (on their common duet &quot;He Say, She Say&quot;), Mateo (on &quot;Piece of That&quot;), Isalene Elliot, and Ragland. &quot;Once I reach an agreement and sign with a record company, the album will drop,&quot; she added. One month later, Peniston confirmed information regarding her new studio album live as a guest of the Wendy Williams birthday show, during which she performed &quot;Finally&quot;. Subsequently, the diva allowed to prelisten a few of her new recordings to her community via her myspace.com page. Among them, the song &quot;Runway&quot; met with instant positive feedback due to its hip-hop/dance sound comparable to Timbaland&#x27;s production. After a New York correspondent, Kenya Thomas, questioned Peniston for &quot;Skinny&quot;, she wished to subtitle the album &quot;CeCe&quot;. Her long-waited record would not be out even following years.

;&quot;In Love with a DJ&quot;
In June 2010, &quot;Hip-Hop Press&quot; posted information about Ron Carroll launching his own independent record label called Electricity, which is to be part of One Entertainment company that will specialize in marketing and promoting concerts, fashion shows and club events all over the world, and signing Electronic, Hip-Hop/R&amp;B and gospel artists. According to the producer himself, Carroll&#x27;s goal with the label (which has a major distribution deal with Universal) is to focus on artist development, music education and ensuring that Electricity creates a solid foundation for the music industry in Chicago. Following this announcement, a house/groove, &quot;In Love with a DJ&quot;, with Peniston as its lead vocalist was released in July, including four remixes. In an interview for &quot;Great British Life&quot;, Carroll said that he &quot;wanted to make a song that gives the perspective of a woman groovin&#x27; to my music, and loving me enough make her night complete.&quot;

====&quot;Make Me Say Oh&quot;, &quot;Stoopid!&quot; and &quot;Celebrate&quot;====
On February 4, 2011, Peniston signed a recording contract with the independent label West Swagg Music Group (WWMG), established by Lupe Rose in 2010. The company currently has a deal with Bungalo Records, which is exclusively distributed by Universal Music Group Distribution. Peniston&#x27;s first single on the label, &quot;Stoopid!&quot; was officially released on April 26 as a download single. One month prior to that, Peniston contributed to the March-issued various artists digital compilation titled &quot;Miami 2011&quot; with &quot;Make Me Say Oh&quot;, which is her fourth track recorded in collaboration with Ron Carroll (their previous works included songs &quot;My Boo&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; U&quot; and &quot;In Love with a DJ&quot;). On August 9, WWMG released &quot;Keep On Flossing&quot; (a remixed version of her former single from the &#x27;90s) recorded as a duet with her fellow rapper Lavon Collins (aka L.C.) While on October 3, a new version of &quot;Finally&quot; by Paul Oakenfold followed. Another track called &quot;Celebrate&quot; was released on March 27.

==Personal life==
In 1992, subsequent to the release of the debut album &quot;Finally&quot;, Peniston was briefly married to Malik Byrd, who co-wrote &quot;Inside That I Cried&quot; and appeared by her side also in its video. In 2003, Peniston married real estate professional Frank Martin from Halifax, Massachusetts. The couple divorced in 2011. On reality TV series &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot; in August 2015, she dated personal trainer Marcus Matthews. This relationship ended soon after the series ended.

While Peniston&#x27;s mother, Barbara Anne Quick Peniston was also her manager, one of Peniston&#x27;s brothers, Gregory, now manages Cece. She previously had a financial struggle with a former account manager, Alvin Grubman, of Grubman and Associates of New York City. Grubman and Associates created a tax debt for Peniston.

==Controversies==
===Plastic surgery===
With the exception of her formative years when she was crowned a beauty queen, Peniston was struggling with her weight constantly. &quot;When I first got in this business, People were actually erupting in fits of laughter when I introduced myself, but I was comfortable with who I was, but that was an issue for the record company,&quot; she disclosed in 2006. &quot;But see in this day and age where I&#x27;m at, it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for the record company, I&#x27;m going to make sure that it&#x27;s not. But for somebody who&#x27;s getting into the business, realize that you&#x27;re a commodity, and if the record company&#x27;s investing in you, make sure that you invest in yourself. Look is important because people see the physical first,&quot; she was advising up-comers in the &quot;5 Magazine&quot; interview.

However, three years later, in November 2009, Peniston herself was spotted in Culver City, California posing for &quot;Inside Edition&quot; (produced daily at the CBS Broadcast Center in N.Y.C.), which first revealed details about her radical physical makeover and tumescent liposuction she, reportedly, got recommended by her new record executives.
In addition, she was featured in several national celebrity news and fashion magazines, including the national &quot;Us Weekly&quot;, which tracked her progress as she sought to lose weight through plastic surgery. The surgery was a &quot;hit&quot; for Peniston, who then claimed to &quot;feel great&quot; after having liposuction, fat removed from her neck.

===Misunderstanding with Monica===
American R&amp;B singer Monica, whose first two singles made her the youngest recording act to ever have two consecutive chart-topping hits on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B Singles chart in 1995 was interviewed by a gossip blog in 2008. The young singer outspokenly talked about her professional life, upcoming wedding as well as her past relationships. During the interview she recalled her manager-cousin Melinda asking CeCe Peniston, &quot;who was huge at that time&quot;, if Monica could sing for her. Monica remembered Peniston being &quot;rude&quot; and doing &quot;everything she possibly could while I sang&quot;, and that she was &quot;devastated&quot; by the experience.

A friend of Peniston had brought the article to her attention later, and she responded to Monica via the social networking website MySpace, saying that she did not recall the event but wanted to apologize for it, saying she had always encouraged and supported children and speculating that she may have been distracted by her staff at the time. Peniston said &quot;At that time I was young and still pretty new to the industry myself, and so I hadn&#x27;t learned how to balance everything just yet. It really hurts me that I made you feel like that.&quot; Monica thanked her for the apology, and for caring &quot;after all the years have passed&quot;.

==Charity work==
===LOTS alias CeCe Peniston Youth Foundation===
Originally in 1997, singer, along with her friend Heather, founded the CeCe Peniston Youth Foundation to help raise funds for many other organizations, particularly those concerned with HIV/AIDS, women and children in need, hunger and the equality of mankind. After the September 11 attacks, Michael Jackson requested her presence for his &quot;United We Stand&quot; concert to benefit the families of 9/11. She has also blazed two tracks (&quot;The Christmas Song&quot; and &quot;What a Wonderful World) on the albums &quot;Merry Arizona II&quot; and &quot;Merry Arizona 97&quot;, with proceeds going to multiple sclerosis. She had been requested to perform for U.S. troops on the U.S.S. Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1993, and has continued to travel to entertain the U.S. troops overseas since.

Later in 2006, the foundation was to be re-named as the LOTS Foundation (Lifting Others To Succeed), after her statement in the interview for &quot;5 Mag&quot; in June the same year, and she was planning doing a benefit for cancer research, because of her father, a cancer survivor.

===National PTA Ambassador===
In October 2008, singer was along with Dara Torres named a National Ambassador for the Parent Teacher Association, which is the largest volunteer child advocacy organization with more than 5 million members. In her new role, she visited with hundreds of children across the country to reinforce the importance of an arts education and pursuing their dreams. She also joined parents and educators to work toward improving the lives of children, as well as urging families to be more involved.
Following this announcement, Peniston started to record the official PTA anthem, &quot;Above Horizons&quot;, which was released on the organization&#x27;s recording label, National PTA Recordings in June 2009, as its first music release. The single was available in three different mixes (&quot;Original Mix&quot;, &quot;Status Mix&quot; and &quot;Aaron-Carl Mix&quot;) at PTAmusic.org, and its release coincided with PTA&#x27;s unofficial announcement of Downloadfundraiser.com as a PTA National Member Benefits Provider, and the &quot;category exclusive&quot; digital music retailer for National PTA.

<doc id="1247697" wikidata="Q1876144" url="?curid=1247697" title="Luigi Chinetti">
<text>Luigi Chinetti (July 17, 1901 – August 17, 1994) was an Italian-born racecar driver, who emigrated to the United States during World War II. He drove in 12 consecutive 24 Hours of Le Mans races, taking three outright wins there and taking two more at the Spa 24 Hours race. Chinetti owned the North American Racing Team, which successfully ran privateer Ferraris in sports car and Formula One races. For many years he was the exclusive American importer of Ferrari automobiles to the United States.

==Biography==
Chinetti was born in Jerago con Orago, a little north of Milan. The son of a gunsmith, he apprenticed in his father&#x27;s workshop where he earned a lathe operator&#x27;s certificate at age 12 and qualified as a mechanic at age 14. In 1917, at age 16, he went to work for Alfa Romeo as a mechanic, where he met another young hire named Enzo Ferrari. The rise to power of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s National Fascist Party in his native country prompted a move to Paris where he worked for Alfa Romeo as a salesman. 

He also began to race sports cars as a driver, earning a reputation in endurance events, the 24 Hours of Le Mans in particular. Driving cars from Alfa Romeo, Talbot, and Ferrari, Chinetti competed in every Le Mans race held between 1932 and 1953. He entered a car in the 1954 race, but as sponsor rather than driver.

Following the outbreak of World War II in Europe, Chinetti went to the United States of America. He traveled as part of the Lucy O&#x27;Reilly Schell Écurie Bleue team, that also included driver René Dreyfus, for an appearance at the 1940 Indianapolis 500. Chinetti remained in New York, getting approval to work at Pratt and Whitney and then supporting the Allied war effort at J. S. Inskip, working on Rolls-Royce engines in the same shop as Italian master mechanic Alfred Momo. Chinetti applied for American citizenship in 1947, and took the oath of allegiance on 6 March 1950. His naturalization was sponsored by Zora Arkus-Duntov.

When the war ended, Chinetti returned to Europe in late 1949. He first went to Paris, only to find that his property had been lost in the war. From there he carried on to Modena for a meeting with Enzo Ferrari, whose car factory had been converted to making machine tools for wartime production. The two men met on Christmas Eve in Ferrari&#x27;s office. Some accounts of this evening describe a highly dramatic meeting between an uncertain and somewhat despondent Ferrari considering abandoning the making of sports cars, and a confident and enthusiastic Chinetti countering that Ferrari must stop making machine tools and resume building racing cars; that the race cars would be paid for by building road cars that Chinetti would sell in America; and placing an order then and there for 25 cars. Other sources point out that in June of that year, Ferrari had already begun building a new racing car; the 125. This new car would use an engine designed by Gioacchino Colombo in August 1945 and first fired on a test bench in September 1946, and that one month after that Ferrari issued a brochure outlining the types of cars he planned to build. It is also pointed out that, while Chinetti had been selling cars such as pre-war Alfas and Talbots to American customers from as early as 1946, he would not have then been in a position to commit to an order of the rumored magnitude. In either case, it seems that Chinetti left the meeting with an agreement to be Ferrari&#x27;s agent in France and the United States.

As both an individual team owner and through N.A.R.T., Chinetti not only left a legacy of fielding some of the best drivers of the era, but of cultivating some of the highest quality up-and-coming talent, the two groups including names such as Stirling Moss, Mario Andretti, Phil Hill, Pedro and Ricardo Rodríguez, Graham Hill, and Jean-Pierre Jarier. One driver that Chinetti tried to promote was journalist Denise McCluggage. The three-time Le Mans winner submitted McCluggage&#x27;s name as one of his drivers for Le Mans, but the application was denied. Chinetti was able to sponsor Yvonne Simon in the 1950 24 Hours of Le Mans partnered with Michel Kasse, and fielded the all-female team of Simon and Betty Haig at the 1951 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Chinetti Sr. sold his business in 1977. He remained in Greenwich, Connecticut after his retirement and died on 17 August 1994 at the age of ninety-three.

===Ferrari===
Enzo Ferrari appointed Chinetti as his Ferrari factory agent in the United States. Chinetti opened the first—and for a while the only—Ferrari dealership in the country. Later his territory became all areas east of the Mississippi River. Chinetti&#x27;s reputation continued to draw clients from across the country throughout his career. In addition to handling Ferrari, Chinetti Motors was also U.S. agent for Automobili OSCA of Bologna until 1967. The original showroom of his Greenwich, Connecticut business has been demolished but the business with new location remains open, owned by Miller Motorcars, a Ferrari-Maserati dealership.

The first Ferrari sold by Chinetti to the US was a Tipo 166 MM Touring Barchetta, chassis 0002 M, sold to Tommy Lee in Los Angeles in the first three months of 1949. The second car sold, and the first sold through the dealership, was a Ferrari Tipo 166 Spyder Corsa, chassis 016-I, to Briggs Cunningham. Cunningham drove it to second place at Watkins Glen in 1949. That car ultimately ended up in Cunningham&#x27;s motorcar museum. The third car was Tipo 166 MM Barchetta 0010 M sold to Kimberly-Clark tissue-paper fortune heir Jim Kimberly. Kimberly and the Ferrari appeared at some eastern events, but on 1 April 1951 with Marshall Lewis behind the wheel it would be the first Ferrari to race and win west of the Mississippi. In 1952 Chinetti sold 1951 Ferrari 212 Export Barchetta 0078E to Phil Hill near the beginning of the future World Champion&#x27;s career. Chinetti would later hire Hill as a driver, and later still recommend him to Ferrari, who at first put him in sports-racing cars and later added Hill to their Formula One (F1) team. Most of Chinetti&#x27;s other sales were kept secret to protect the privacy of his wealthy clients.

===N.A.R.T.===

Chinetti founded the privateer North American Racing Team (N.A.R.T.) with financial support from George Arents and Jan de Vroom. Chinetti&#x27;s reputation and existing relationship with Ferrari guaranteed a supply of former works cars and support for many years. The team ran very successful endurance racing programs both at Sebring and Le Mans right into the 1970s.

Ferrari&#x27;s F1 158s raced in N.A.R.T. blue and white for two races at the end of the 1964 season. When the FIA refused to homologate the Ferrari 250 LM for international sports car racing, Enzo Ferrari returned his competition license and vowed to never race in Ferrari Red again. With the championship on the line, Ferrari&#x27;s cars appeared in N.A.R.T. colors for the 1964 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, and again at the 1964 Mexican Grand Prix. By the start of the 1965 season the dispute was resolved, and the cars were painted red once again.

In addition to the racing cars, the team commissioned limited-run special variants of Ferrari road cars. One such project was the 275 GTS/4 NART Spyder. Left without a convertible model after production of the 250 GT California ended in 1962, Chinetti obtained factory permission to have coachbuilder Scaglietti convert a series of 4-cam 275GTB/4 coupés into open-top cars. Of a planned run of 25, only 10 are believed to have been built.

In the mid-1970s Chinetti commissioned Giovanni Michelotti to begin a series of Ferrari Daytonas with heavily customized bodywork that would be called the Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona NART Spider. The first was shown at the 1974 Turin Auto Show. The second conversion was chassis number 15965, and was built up as a racing car in anticipation of an appearance at the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans, although the car was withdrawn before the race. In 1975 Chinetti ordered three more Michelotti conversions built to road car specifications. One of these three, chassis 14299, was completed in 1977 and then specially customized by Chinetti as a gift for his wife.

==Personal life==
Chinetti married on 18 April 1942. He and wife Marion had one son; Luigi &quot;Coco&quot; Chinetti Junior.

On 27 July 1963 Luigi Jr. married Mamie Spears Reynolds (1942–2014), daughter of U.S. Senator Robert Rice Reynolds and Evalyn Washington &quot;Evie&quot; McLean. Reynolds was the first woman to qualify for the Daytona 500. Luigi Jr. and Reynolds divorced after two years.

==Racing career==

Driving an Alfa Romeo race car entered by his co-driver Raymond Sommer, Chinetti won at his very first 24 hours of Le Mans race in . The following year, with Louis Chiron as co-driver, he won the Spa 24 Hours endurance race in Belgium. He teamed up with Philippe Étancelin in to win his second 24 hours of Le Mans.

At the 1949 24 Hours of Le Mans race he drove the first Ferrari ever to win the event, and became the second three-time winner of the race. The Ferrari 166M in which Chinetti won was turned over to Baron Selsdon of Scotland (Peter Mitchell-Thomson) for twenty minutes during the race, making Thomson the official co-driver although Chinetti had driven twenty-three of the hours of the race. Following the race, Thomson purchased that automobile through Chinetti.

Chinetti made three appearances at the Spa 24 Hours, taking outright wins in 1933 in an Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 partnered with Phillipe Varent, and again in 1949 in a Ferrari Tipo 166 MM driving for Ferrari with Jean Lucas.

He also posted wins at the Paris 12 Hours; once in 1948 in a Ferrari Tipo 166 SC, and again in 1950 in a Tipo 166 MM teamed with Jean Lucas.

In 1951, he was the riding mechanic in the Ferrari 212 that won the grueling Carrera Panamericana race, a , five-day competition across Mexico. Chinetti appeared in the Carrera Panamericana three more times in subsequent years, with the highest finish being a third place in 1952.

<doc id="1247702" wikidata="Q2118059" url="?curid=1247702" title="Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph">
<text>In mycology, the terms teleomorph, anamorph, and holomorph apply to portions of the life cycles of fungi in the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota:

*Teleomorph: the sexual reproductive stage (morph), typically a fruiting body.
*Anamorph: an asexual reproductive stage (morph), often mold-like. When a single fungus produces multiple morphologically distinct anamorphs, these are called synanamorphs.
*Holomorph: the whole fungus, including anamorphs and teleomorph.

==Dual naming of fungi==
Fungi are classified primarily based on the structures associated with sexual reproduction, which tend to be evolutionarily conserved. However, many fungi reproduce only asexually, and cannot easily be classified based on sexual characteristics; some produce both asexual and sexual states. These species are often members of the Ascomycota, but a few of them belong to the Basidiomycota. Even among fungi that reproduce both sexually and asexually, often only one method of reproduction can be observed at a specific point in time or under specific conditions. Additionally, fungi typically grow in mixed colonies and sporulate amongst each other. These facts have made it very difficult to link the various states of the same fungus.

Fungi that are not known to produce a teleomorph were historically placed into an artificial phylum, the &quot;Deuteromycota,&quot; also known as &quot;fungi imperfecti,&quot; simply for convenience. Some workers hold that this is an obsolete concept, and that molecular phylogeny allows accurate placement of species which are known from only part of their life cycle. Others retain the term &quot;deuteromycetes,&quot; but give it a lowercase &quot;d&quot; and no taxonomic rank.

Historically, Article 59 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permitted mycologists to give asexually reproducing fungi (anamorphs) separate names from their sexual states (teleomorphs); but this practice was discontinued as of 1 January 2013.

The dual naming system can be confusing. However, it is essential for workers in plant pathology, mold identification, medical mycology, and food microbiology, fields in which asexually reproducing fungi are commonly encountered.

== From dual system to single nomenclature ==
The separate names for anamorphs of fungi with a pleomorphic life-cycle has been an issue of debate since the phenomenon was recognized in the mid-19th century. This was even before the first international rules for botanical nomenclature were issued in 1867. Special provisions are to be found in the earliest &quot;Codes&quot;, which were then modified several times, and often substantially. The rules have been updated regularly and become increasingly complex, and by the mid-1970s they were being interpreted in different ways by different mycologists – even ones working on the same genus. Following intensive discussions under the auspices of the International Mycological Association, drastic changes were made at the International Botanical Congress in 1981 to clarify and simplify the procedures – and the new terms anamorph, teleomorph, and holomorph entered general use. An unfortunate effect of the simplification was that many name changes had to be made, including for some well-known and economically important species; at that date, the conservation of species names was not allowed under the &quot;Code&quot;.

Unforeseen in the 1970s, when the 1981 provisions were crafted, was the impact of molecular systematics. A decade later, it was starting to become obvious that fungi with no known sexual stage could confidently be placed in genera which were typified by species in which the sexual stage was known. This possibility of abandoning the dual nomenclatural system was debated at subsequent International Mycological Congresses and on other occasions, and the need for change was increasingly recognized. At the International Botanical Congress in Vienna in 2005, some minor modifications were made which allowed anamorph-typified names to be epitypified by material showing the sexual stage when it was discovered, and for that anamorph name to continue to be used.

The 1995 edition of the influential &quot;Ainsworth and Bisby’s Dictionary of the Fungi&quot; sought to replace the term anamorph with &quot;mitosporic fungus&quot; and teleomorph with &quot;meiosporic fungus&quot;, based on the idea that the fundamental distinction is whether mitosis or meiosis preceded sporulation. This is a controversial choice because it is not clear that the morphological differences which traditionally define anamorphs and teleomorphs line up completely with sexual practices, or whether those sexual practices are sufficiently well understood in some cases.

The Vienna Congress (2005) established a Special Committee to investigate the issue further, but it was unable to reach a consensus. Matters were becoming increasingly desperate as mycologists using molecular phylogenetic approaches started to ignore the provisions, or interpret them in different ways.

==One fungus, one name==
The International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 made a change in the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&quot; and adopted the principle &quot;one fungus, one name&quot;. After 1 January 2013, one fungus can only have one name; the system of permitting separate names to be used for anamorphs then ended. This means that all legitimate names proposed for a species, regardless of what stage they are typified by, can serve as the correct name for that species.

All names now compete on an equal footing for priority. In order not to render illegitimate the names that had been introduced in the past for separate morphs, it was agreed that these should not be treated as superfluous alternative names in the sense of the &quot;Code&quot;. It was further decided that no anamorph-typified name should be taken up to displace a widely used teleomorph-typified name without the case&#x27;s having been considered by the General Committee established by the Congress. Recognizing that there were cases in some groups of fungi where there could be many names that might merit formal retention or rejection, a new provision was introduced: Lists of names can be submitted to the General Committee and, after due scrutiny, names accepted on those lists are to be treated as conserved over competing synonyms (and listed as Appendices to the &quot;Code&quot;). Lichen-forming fungi (but not lichenicolous fungi) had always been excluded from the provisions permitting dual nomenclature.

The problem of choosing one name among many remains to be examined for many large, agriculturally or medically-important genera like &quot;Aspergillus&quot; and &quot;Fusarium&quot;. Articles have been published on such specific genera to propose ways to define them under the newer rules.

<text>Diane Joyce Bish (born May 25, 1941) is an American organist, composer, conductor, as well as executive producer and host of &quot;The Joy of Music&quot; television series. As a concert organist, she performs at concerts throughout North America and Europe. Bish also continues to tape episodes for her television series by visiting notable organs throughout the world.

== Education and personal life ==

Diane Joyce Bish was born in Wichita, Kansas, the youngest daughter of Howard Leroy Bish and his wife Esther Jeanette, born Schuessler. Her great-grandparents, George Harold Schuessler and Magdalena Bender, migrated from Eschelbach, Germany, to Furley, Kansas, during the 1870s. Bish changed her middle name from &quot;Joyce&quot; to &quot;Joy&quot; after graduating from high school.

Bish began piano lessons when she was 6 years old and started organ lessons at age 14. She noted that her foundation in piano gave her the background needed to succeed with organ studies, which required not only excellent keyboard technique but also added in the pedal.

Bish graduated from Wichita East High School in Wichita, Kansas, in 1959. She had played on the 1925 Austin Organ installed in the school auditorium. In 1984, she returned there to play a benefit concert, which raised enough money for the organ to be restored. She became interested in the organ as a young child when listening to the Mormon Tabernacle organist Alexander Schreiner on Sunday morning programs on the radio, as well as recordings of E. Power Biggs.

Bish began studying organ as a student of Dorothy Addy, who challenged her to learn much of the classic organ repertoire during her high school years, which helped her later when she needed a variety of music for concerts and programs. In college, she studied under Mildred Andrews. Later, she was a recipient of Fulbright and French government grants for study in Amsterdam with Gustav Leonhardt, and in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and Marie-Claire Alain. Bish credited Leonhardt with teaching her &quot;the art of music.&quot; Leonhardt taught both the harpsichord and the organ and emphasized articulation and spacing in his lessons.

Bish began her college career on a full scholarship at Asbury College in Kentucky, which had a four-manual Austin pipe organ. In her junior year, Bish transferred to the University of Oklahoma, after auditioning to become a student of Mildred Andrews at the university. After receiving her Bachelor of Music degree, Bish stayed at the university to earn a Master of Music degree.

While at the University of Oklahoma, Bish joined the Mu Kappa chapter of Mu Phi Epsilon, an international, co-educational professional music fraternity that is composed of collegiate chapters, alumni chapters, and allied members. She joined the organization for the camaraderie of fellow musicians as well as the opportunities it offered, such as musical activities and competitions.

On October 31, 2002, in Bloomington, Indiana, a fire consumed the home that Bish shared with harpist Susann McDonald. Among the many personal possessions lost were a Yamaha grand piano and Rodgers digital organ, but both women escaped without injuries. Bish also lost most of her signature concert attire in the fire.

Despite a busy schedule of concerts and program tapings, Bish believes in living a well-rounded life. While practice is important for a musician&#x27;s success, she has also enjoyed sports and being with friends and family. She describes herself as a people person and enjoys traveling, fishing, snow skiing, and animals, especially Poodles or Maltese dogs. When asked if she has any vices, Bish admits to procrastination at times, as well as taking a break from 3 to 4 p.m. to &quot;have a cup of coffee, some chocolate, and I sit with my dog and just enjoy being alive.&quot; As of 2020, she makes her home in Naples, Florida.

Her advice for young musicians is to determine what they want to do and then work hard at it. It is important to learn good technique with a serious teacher. It is also important to think about musical interpretation. She noted, &quot;Don&#x27;t be a robot – technique is one thing, but without the heart, the soul, the music doesn&#x27;t touch people.&quot;

== Career ==
After graduating with her master&#x27;s degree, Bish was the organist at the East Heights Methodist Church in Wichita, Kansas. She left for a year to study in Amsterdam, and then returned to the church organist position. She also taught organ and harpsichord at Friends University for two years, along with continuing to offer concerts and lectures. In 1969, Bish received a scholarship from the French government to return to Europe for further study with Marie-Claire Alain. Upon her return from Europe, she moved to Wichita Falls, Texas to teach for a year, before realizing that, instead of teaching, she wanted to have a church job and continue her performance career.

Besides her teachers, three organists, in particular, had an influence on her musical style. She used to listen to recordings of E. Power Biggs, as well as Alexander Schreiner, who was the organist on the Sunday morning Mormon Tabernacle programs on the radio. In addition, she was acquainted with the organist Virgil Fox. Bish has stated that she has tried to combine the styles of Biggs and Fox, while choosing inspirational literature that makes use of the full resources of the organ, as Schreiner did.

Beginning in the 1970s, Bish served for more than 20 years as organist and artist-in-residence at the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where she designed the 117-rank Ruffatti organ in the sanctuary. She also co-founded the church&#x27;s concert series as well as the Church Music Explosion international workshop for church musicians. Bish continues to perform occasionally at the church, most recently in an April 12, 2019 concert that featured two of her works, &quot;Symphony of Hymns&quot; and the &quot;Passion Symphony&quot;, which were written for the Ruffatti organ.

Bish has been on television for most of her career. Her first regular appearances were on the &quot;Coral Ridge Hour&quot;, a weekly television series that was produced at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church. In 1982, she began recording &quot;The Joy of Music&quot;.

No longer resident organist at the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, Bish made frequent concert appearances at recitals throughout North America. During her concerts, she shows the audience what the organ she is playing that day can do, making sure to include music that includes stops &quot;from the tiniest flutes to big, thunderous sounds.&quot; She also explains the music by introducing nearly every number played.

Even when Bish was playing full-time at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, she was free to travel as a concert organist. When playing a new organ, she first registers it, or memorizes where all of the stops are. She explained, &quot;The first thing I do when I sit down at a new organ is just register it. I don&#x27;t actually play that much because it&#x27;s very important to know, first of all, where everything is. I don&#x27;t preset a lot of things. It&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve had to do, and I find whether you have a little time or a lot, you tend to take the time you have.&quot; While it can be a challenge to play different organs, it is also rewarding to figure out how to produce different effects on new organs.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated the cancellation of many church services and concerts, Bish found a creative way to bring the joy of the organ to her neighbors on Easter Sunday 2020. She played a concert from her home organ, using an additional sound system through large, opened patio doors. More than 150 people attended.

Bish has written numerous musical compositions, including original works and arrangements of hymns and other works, and writes everything out by hand. She has to be in the mood for the work of composing, noting that she needs to &quot;be at peace, and be composed to compose.&quot; Woodruff noted that Bish has &quot;produced her richest compositions at the happiest points in her life, in the moments of great personal triumph. Unlike many other composers, Diane cannot compose as an escape from sorrow or frustration. She must be in a content and cheerful frame of mind.&quot;

Bish has also completed numerous hymn arrangements. In a hymn arrangement, she tries to bring out the melody while making use of rhythm. She laments &quot;unimaginative&quot; arrangements, noting that &quot;we have a whole orchestra to use in terms of the organ, and in my hymn arrangements, I try to utilize them all.&quot; Bish also reads the verses of the hymn so that her arrangements are reflective of the message of the hymn.

In addition to her work as a recitalist, television host/producer, and composer, Bish is also an organ designer. As noted above, Bish designed the Ruffatti organ that was installed in 1974 at the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, working with Piero Ruffatti and architect Harold Wagoner. A dedication service and recital by Bish were held on January 5, 1975.

The Diane Bish Signature Series of organs is available through the Allen Organ Company. In an interview where she was asked about these organs, Bish said, &quot;My organs have more of the French in them, the reeds are more French. They’ll play anything in the strings. That’s one thing I really like in an organ — good strings. They’re very rich, very beautiful and warm, and the reeds are very fiery and exciting. The flutes are also very distinct, whether they’re a German flute or a harmonic flute or whatever, they’re very distinct. That’s very important in an organ. So I tried to pull all those aspects together in my organs.&quot; The Diane Bish Signature Series of organs also include special console finishes and six complete stop lists, including Classic Allen, Cavaillé-Coll, Schlicker, English Cathedral, Aeolian-Skinner and Arp Schnitger.

Bish is known for her elegant concert attire and sparkly organ shoes. Many of her gowns are custom-made or adapted from clothing bought off the rack. Bish said that her attire helps to create a concert performance atmosphere, noting that other concert performers do not wear black robes to perform. She regularly receives comments from fans about her attire.

The organ shoes that Bish wears are gold with rhinestones and are designed by her manager, Janet Jarriel. Originally, the rhinestones were multicolored, but in 2006, the shoe design was changed to use white rhinestones, which also surround the heel of the shoes.

One book has been written about Bish and her life. This book, &quot;First Lady of the Organ, Diane Bish: A Biography&quot;, by Warren L. Woodruff , was partially based on a doctoral dissertation by Woodruff about Bish and her work.

Bish herself is also an author. In 1977, she published &quot;Church Music Explosion&quot;, which provided information and inspiration for church musicians, especially church organists. The book was updated with a new edition in 1982. The book provided guidance for the organist in selecting music, playing for worship services, working with others, and establishing a concert series. In addition, there was advice on how to demonstrate the organ to children, to build an audience for the future, along with suggested repertoire listings that could be used with both choirs and organs.

In 2013, Bish authored a book of faith entitled &quot;Warnings! End Time Scenarios&quot;, which was dedicated to the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. This 110-page book featured scenarios of people who unexpectedly faced life-changing challenges and disasters; each chapter began with Bible verses that were appropriate to the situations described. In the introduction to the book, Bish noted that she had been reading various print and online sources that led her to think about how contemporary events mirrored end-time events predicted in the Bible. Accordingly, the purpose of the book was to issue a reminder that people should &quot;hear the life-changing good news of the gospel&quot; before it was too late.

Faith has been an important element for Bish throughout her career. She noted that she always tries to include music that provides spiritual inspiration in each of her concerts. In addition, despite her renowned talent, Bish always attributes her success to God. Her sister, Judy (Bish) Priest, was quoted as saying: &quot;“Diane is very, very gifted,” she said, “but she always gives God the glory. She knows where her gifts come from.”

In June 2023, Bish partnered with the Institute for Faith &amp; Culture at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church to establish the Diane Bish Center for Music and the Arts, with Lisa B. Wilson as its director. In a June 28, 2023 email from the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church announcing the center, a quote from Bish noted that it was expected to be &quot;a revitalizing force in every facet of the Arts--performance, composition, creativity, and education.&quot;

=== The Joy of Music Program ===
There are three purposes for &quot;The Joy of Music&quot; program, according to Bish: &quot;To feature great churches and organs with performances of classical and sacred music; to reflect &#x27;Excellence in all things and all things to God&#x27;s glory;&#x27; and to educate, inspire, and enrich the lives of people through God&#x27;s gifts of creation.&quot;

The idea for what became The Joy of Music began when Bish listened to recordings of E. Power Biggs playing famous European organs. When she was in high school, she thought it would be nice for listeners to be able to see the organs and their surroundings as well as hear them. After graduating from college, when Bish was studying in Europe and playing different European organs, she continued to think about her dream of eventually hosting a television program.

During her time at Coral Ridge, Bish began producing the weekly television program of organ music, &quot;The Joy of Music&quot;. A music writer for the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; newspaper said in 1986 that Bish &quot;combines masterful music and religion in a life filled with church work, concerts, and writing and producing her own TV show&quot;. It had taken ten years of work to make the new program a reality.

Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church had constructed a new church, with a new Ruffatti organ, in 1974. The new church had television cameras that were used to broadcast the services. Between 1971 and 1981, Bish wrote proposals for a potential series but was unable to garner any interest. Then, in 1981, a supporter donated $20,000 and Bish was able to create two pilot episodes in 1982. The pilot episodes included a Christmas program and a program for trumpet and organ. The donor also knew the owner of Trinity Broadcasting Network, Paul Crouch. From this contact, Trinity Broadcasting put &quot;The Joy of Music&quot; into a national 8:30 p.m. slot on Friday evenings, giving the new program an audience of millions.

By 1984, Bish began traveling to Europe to record episodes on famous organs throughout the continent. These episodes combined music and a travelogue with information about the organs, churches, cities, art, and scenery. Bish stated that the travel aspect of the programs helped to bring in additional viewers. In addition, she played a variety of music on the program, so that every listener could find something enjoyable. This was especially important to be able to reach listeners who did not know much about the organ.

The &quot;Joy of Music&quot; tapings have occurred in many famous cathedrals on well-known organs. Bish noted that when playing the organs that were also played by Bach, Handel, or Mozart, &quot;you&#x27;re touching history when you do that. It&#x27;s pretty amazing, really.&quot; When determining the locale for a taping, 90 percent of the time, Bish first decides on an organ that she would like to feature, and then builds the tour around that instrument.

Bish serves as executive producer of the program and is involved in all aspects of its production. She spends a lot of time at &quot;The Joy of Music&quot; office taking care of paperwork and planning. She writes all of the scripts, drawing upon her earlier writing experience as the editor of her high school newspaper to write succinct commentary for the show. When writing the commentary, she does all of the research on the music she will play, information on the composers, the churches and organs, and the locations where she visits. Bish also enjoys working with guest artists, including violinists, choirs, brass ensembles, and even an Alp hornist.

When planning a tour, Bish first selects the location and the guest artists. She then selects the music and begins to prepare it, while doing the research for the programs. Once on location, all of the musical pieces and all of the introductory and regional scenes are shot live.

Once the taping has concluded, Bish handles the initial review of the finished footage to decide what will be included in each program. She is also responsible for approval of the program once the footage is arranged in its final production stage. One taping trip can result in over forty hours of footage to edit, and a two-week trip can include six to eight tapings.

It can take a year to plan a European tour because the churches, guest artists, and camera crews have to be lined up. Fundraising also needs to occur. In addition, Bish works with a tour company to open the trips up to fans and friends, which are then advertised on &quot;The Joy of Music&quot; website.

The majority of current European &quot;Joy of Music&quot; trips use a riverboat for travel between sites. This has made touring easier, because there is no need to pack and unpack when moving from city to city. At each stop, the group visits a church and Bish records for the program. After the records are finished, Bish then tapes the introductions and information shots that are included on the program.

For the first 15 years of the program, 26 episodes per year were produced, each of which would be repeated once to cover a 52-week programming span. Currently, fewer programs are produced each year because of expense. When producing the full 26 episodes per year, it was necessary to raise an average of US$350,000–$400,050. Ninety percent of the funding for the program comes from donations. Other funding and support is provided by corporate sponsors.

Production of &quot;The Joy of Music&quot; is expensive because when traveling, the guest artists, crew, and equipment must be transported to the taping sites. Proper equipment must be obtained. Following a taping trip, there are editing hours, along with production, duplication, and distribution costs, and staff costs to prepare the files for television stations. Bish once noted, &quot;We literally sweat it out every month and pray that the money will come in. We do so much on so little that Hollywood would laugh at our small budget for one show.&quot;

Bish has encountered challenges when filming &quot;The Joy of Music&quot;. It is sometimes difficult to secure permission to tape in churches and cathedrals because there have been problems in the past with other television crews at these locations. In addition, scheduling time in the churches can be difficult. Bish related the time when her crew had to start taping at midnight because there was a light show and a trumpet recital scheduled there first. At the Strasbourg Cathedral, filming had to be done in the middle of the night, and there were 130 steps plus a walk out onto the roof in order to reach the organ loft. The organ loft was mounted 80 feet high on a wall, and the camera person was afraid of heights. Furthermore, the restrooms were downstairs. There were also environmental issues, such as at the Ettal Monastery in Bavaria that was so cold that everyone had to wear coats, Bish had to warm her hands with a hair dryer between pieces, and the soloist&#x27;s breath could be seen on the tape of the program. The console of the organ caught on fire in Notre Dame and lightning struck the church where Bish was to play in Germany.

Bish does not often have the time to rehearse extensively prior to taping a program. Due to scheduling, &quot;The Joy of Music&quot; team is generally allowed only one day at a location. She sometimes can rehearse for only an hour and a half prior to recording, while the camera crew sets up. The churches generally do not close because of the taping, so there is background noise to contend with during taping. The actual recording takes place over three to four hours, followed by taping of the introduction and information sections for the program. Outdoor filming of the surrounding area also has to be done. The whole process can take up to 14 to 16 hours in one day. Once all of the work is finished, Bish and her crew go to eat.

As of 2018, &quot;The Joy of Music&quot; continues to feature her performances, taped on location at prominent organs in North America and Europe. &quot;The Joy of Music&quot; is seen in North America via independent, faith-based, and satellite networks, and selected PBS stations. The show has an international audience via The Church Channel, BibelTV, Roku, VelugaTV, Gospel Channel, Alfa/Omega TV, and YouTube. The program can be seen by over 300,000 people worldwide on a weekly basis. The program receives letters from many different countries, including Ghana, Thailand, Uganda, and Italy. In 2017, a &quot;Joy of Music&quot; live stream was added to the show&#x27;s YouTube channel to enable listeners to tune in 24-hours per day.

Since the program&#x27;s beginning in the early 1980s, Bish has recorded over 500 episodes, each of which shows her playing one or more different pipe or digital organs. Many people tell her that they began playing the organ because of the &quot;Joy of Music&quot; program. Bish&#x27;s ability to demonstrate the variety of sounds and volume levels that an organ can produce has inspired new organists. One organist, Stephen Price, noted that he was &quot;blown away&quot; when he first saw Bish on the &quot;Joy of Music&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
Bish began winning organ competitions during college. In her junior and senior years at the University of Oklahoma, she placed first in the American Guild of Organists&#x27; Competition. She also won the National Organ Competition of the National Federation of Music Clubs, as well as the Original Composition Contest of the Mu Phi Epsilon National Competition.

In 1989, Bish was awarded the National Citation by the National Federation of Music Clubs of America, considered to be the Federation&#x27;s highest honor; this award was previously given to other music legends including Leonard Bernstein, Eugene Ormandy, Van Cliburn, and Robert Shaw. In 1994, she received the Elizabeth Mathias Award, one of Mu Phi Epsilon&#x27;s highest honors.

On April 29, 2016, Bish was awarded the inaugural Distinguished Career Award by the New York City Chapter of the American Guild of Organists, presented to her at the historic Marble Collegiate Church. On November 4, 2016, Bish was named the organist emerita of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church. Also in November 2016, Bish was honored as one of the 2016 Women of Distinction by Celebrating Women International (CWI) in Nassau, Bahamas. This award is reserved for women who have made significant contributions worldwide in many fields, including the arts.

On April 7–8, 2018, Bish was honored by her alma mater, the University of Oklahoma. The American Organ Institute at the University of Oklahoma held a Gala Weekend in her honor, which included a private master class, a gala dinner, and a special concert, which featured many of her musical works. A scholarship in her name was also established.

== Discography ==
Bish has made over thirty recordings on many of the great organs of the world, including the celebrated Müller organ of the St.-Bavokerk (or Grote Kerk) in Haarlem, Netherlands, Canterbury Cathedral, and Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. She is the first American woman to record at the organ of Freiburg Cathedral in Freiburg, Germany. Her recordings include music for organ and orchestra, brass and organ, cello and organ, most of the great masterpieces for solo organ, original compositions and hymn arrangements.

<text>The Cape Breton Eagles are a Canadian junior ice hockey team in the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) based in Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia. They are members of the Maritimes Division, and play their home games at Centre 200 in Sydney, Nova Scotia.

==History==
The franchise was originally granted to the Sorel Éperviers (Black Hawks) for the 1969–70 season. They then moved from Sorel to Verdun in 1977 to become the Verdun Éperviers. In 1979, they played in both Sorel and Verdun before moving back to Sorel for the next season. In 1981, they moved to Granby to become the Granby Bisons, and in 1995 changed their names to the Granby Prédateurs. In 1996, the Prédateurs won the Memorial Cup. In 1997, the franchise was relocated to Sydney to become the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles. Prior to the Eagles&#x27; arrival, Sydney played host to the American Hockey League (AHL)&#x27;s Cape Breton Oilers from 1988 to 1996.

===Early years in Cape Breton (1997–1999)===
The Screaming Eagles&#x27; first captain was Daniel Payette under coach Dany Dubé.

===The Vincent era (1999–2008)===
In 1999, Pascal Vincent was promoted as the new head coach following the dismissal of Bruce Campbell. The Screaming Eagles attempted to strengthen the club by drafting future National Hockey League (NHL) star Ilya Kovalchuk tenth overall in the 2000 CHL Import Draft. However, Kovalchuk declined to report to the team. Along with star players Marc-André Fleury, Dominic Noel, Stuart MacRae and Stephen Dixon, the Screaming Eagles reached the QMJHL&#x27;s conference final in 2002, only to lose in five games to Acadie-Bathurst Titan. Fleury&#x27;s number 29 jersey went on to be retired by the Screaming Eagles in 2008. Kovalchuk&#x27;s number 71 was retired in 2014, as an April Fools&#x27; Day prank.

Vincent stacked the Screaming Eagles lineup with many NHL prospects for the 2003–04 season in hopes of bringing a league title to Cape Breton. After the Screaming Eagles won 49 games and captured a division title, with Fleury also returning from the Pittsburgh Penguins before the playoffs, but the Screaming Eagles lost in the second round to the Chicoutimi Saguenéens.

At the 2004 QMJHL Draft, the Screaming Eagles chose James Sheppard with the first overall pick. In 2006–07, along with star players Luc Bourdon, Ondrej Pavelec and Oskars Bartulis, Sheppard led the Screaming Eagles to the league semifinals, only to lose in seven games to the Val-d&#x27;Or Foreurs.

The 2007–08 season saw 16-year-old goaltender Olivier Roy rise to prominence. The Screaming Eagles finished fourth in their division and won their first round playoff series despite having a roster that normally dressed at least ten rookies. Vincent went on to be named the 2008 QMJHL Coach of the Year. Following the end of the season, Vincent became the head coach and general manager of the Montreal Junior Hockey Club.

===2010s history (2008–2019)===
Following Vincent&#x27;s departure, assistant coach Mario Durocher took over the role of head coach and general manager. In a bid to host the Memorial Cup in 2012, Durocher added former NHL players Mike McPhee and Guy Chouinard, former NHL coach Pierre Creamer and Michel Boucher to the hockey staff in consulting roles in 2010. Durocher was relieved of his duties on April 12, 2011, after a lackluster season in which the team finished 16th in the league and last in the Atlantic Division with just 41 points.

The team&#x27;s then-head coach Ron Choules replaced Durocher as general manager in April 2011, though the team failed to improve on the ice. After a poor start to the 2012–13 season, Choules himself was fired on December 3, 2012, with former Val-d&#x27;Or head coach Marc-André Dumont announced as his replacement. The Screaming Eagles failed to reach the playoffs for the first time in franchise history in the 2012–13 season. At season&#x27;s end, assistant coach Jean-François David was fired.

After being eliminated in the second round of the 2019 playoffs, the Screaming Eagles fired their coaching staff. Dumont was replaced with Nova Scotia native, Jake Grimes, along with former Eagles alumni Chris Culligan as assistant coach.

The team mascot is an eagle named Screech.

===Cape Breton Eagles (2019–present)===
On August 14, 2019, the team rebranded itself as the Cape Breton Eagles.

On November 30, 2021, head coach Jake Grimes resigned as head coach citing personal reasons. He finished with a winning record overall with the club, at 46–34–0–7 record over one-and-a-half seasons but had started the 2021–22 season with a 6–14–0–4 record. The Eagles spent approximately two months with an interim head coach before hiring Chadd Cassidy on January 7, 2022.

<doc id="1247730" wikidata="Q5668259" url="?curid=1247730" title="Harry Danning">
<text>Harry Danning (September 6, 1911 – November 29, 2004), nicknamed &quot;Harry the Horse&quot;, was an American professional baseball player. He played his entire Major League Baseball career as a catcher for the New York Giants, and was considered to be both an excellent hitter and one of the top defensive catchers of his era. He batted and threw right-handed, and was a member of the National League All-Star team for four consecutive years, 1938-41.

==Early and personal life==
Danning was born in Los Angeles to Jewish parents: his father, Robert Danning, was a Polish immigrant and owned a used-furniture store; his mother, Jennie Danning (née Goldberg), was a Latvian immigrant. Danning was one of six children, including three sons; Robert Danning took his sons to see baseball games, including the Pacific Coast League and the Negro league games. Robert&#x27;s love of baseball inspired both Harry and his older brother Ike Danning, who played for the St. Louis Browns in .

Danning attended Los Angeles High School in Los Angeles. His father became ill and Harry started working at 13, including delivering ice. Danning also worked for a rug salesman after high school. By that time, Danning&#x27;s father had passed away, and the rug store job paid well — $90 a month — helping Danning support his family. He supplemented his income playing semipro baseball on Sundays, for $7.50 a week.

==Baseball career==
In 1931, Danning signed a $150-a-month contract with the Class-A team in Bridgeport, Connecticut, owned by the Giants. When the Bridgeport franchise folded, mid-season 1932, Danning moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina to be part of the Piedmont League. Danning&#x27;s batting average in the minor leagues was above .300 every season.

Danning first played with the New York Giants in 1933. From 1934 to 1936, he served as the Giants reserve catcher, working behind Gus Mancuso. In 1934 in spring training, despite a team reservation Jewish ballplayers Phil Weintraub and Danning were refused entry to the Flamingo Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, which had a &quot;No Jews&quot; policy. However, they were allowed to stay when Giants manager Bill Terry threatened he would take the whole team to another hotel if his Jewish ballplayers were not allowed in.

In the 1937 season, Danning and Mancuso shared the catching duties with Danning appearing in 93 games, while Mancuso appeared in 86 games. In 1938 Danning took over the role as the Giants starting catcher. He was selected for the National League All-Star squad in four consecutive years (1938–1941), was on the world champion Giants team that defeated the Washington Senators in the 1933 World Series, and appeared in the pennant-winning clubs that were defeated by the New York Yankees in the 1936 and 1937 World Series.

In the 1937 series, CBS announcer Ted Husing nicknamed Danning &quot;Harry The Horse&quot; for Damon Runyon&#x27;s Broadway character.

From 1938 through 1940 Danning hit .306, .313 and .300, and finished in the top 10 in National League MVP voting in 1939 (9th) and 1940 (7th). He collected career highs in home runs (16) in 1939, and in RBIs (91) in 1940. He led all National League catchers with a .991 fielding average in 1939.

On June 9, 1939 against the pennant-winning Cincinnati Reds at the Polo Grounds, Danning was one of five Giants to hit a home run in the fourth inning, breaking the prior record of four home runs by a team in one inning. Remarkably, all five were hit by the Giants with two outs. Then, on June 15, 1940, he hit for the cycle in a game against Pittsburgh. His home run came on an inside-the-park home run that landed on the fly in front of the Giants&#x27; clubhouse, wedged behind the Eddie Grant memorial.

Through 2010, he was ninth all-time in career hits (behind Al Rosen) among Jewish major league baseball players.

==Career statistics==
In addition to batting .300 or higher in three consecutive seasons, Danning had a .285 career batting average, tying Yogi Berra for the 18th highest lifetime batting average among Hall of Fame eligible major league baseball catchers. He hit 57 lifetime home runs and 397 RBIs in 890 games. He had a career fielding percentage of .985, leading National League catchers three times in putouts, and twice in assists and baserunners caught stealing. During his career, he threw out 47% of runners attempting to steal. He caught the screwballer Carl Hubbell, and was also a teammate of Mel Ott, Bill Terry and Travis Jackson, four Hall of Famers.

==After baseball==
During World War II, Danning served in the United States Army, and announced his retirement from baseball after his military service. He went into the automobile business in Los Angeles, and also worked as a minor league coach.

He received one vote each for the Hall of Fame in both 1958 and 1960. In 1996 he was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

He died in Valparaiso, Indiana, at the age of 93. His obituary and photograph appeared in the December 13, 2004, edition of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine.

==Other highlights==

<text>Troilus ( ; ; ) is a legendary character associated with the story of the Trojan War. The first surviving reference to him is in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad,&quot; composed in the late 8th century BC.

In Greek mythology, Troilus is a young Trojan prince, one of the sons of King Priam (or Apollo) and Hecuba. Prophecies link Troilus&#x27; fate to that of Troy and so he is ambushed and murdered by Achilles. Sophocles was one of the writers to tell this tale. It was also a popular theme among artists of the time. Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. He was also regarded as a of youthful male beauty.

In Western European medieval and Renaissance versions of the legend, Troilus is the youngest of Priam&#x27;s five legitimate sons by Hecuba. Despite his youth he is one of the main Trojan war leaders. He dies in battle at Achilles&#x27; hands. In a popular addition to the story, originating in the 12th century, Troilus falls in love with Cressida, whose father Calchas has defected to the Greeks. Cressida pledges her love to Troilus but she soon switches her affections to the Greek hero Diomedes when sent to her father in a hostage exchange. Chaucer and Shakespeare are among the authors who wrote works telling the story of Troilus and Cressida. Within the medieval tradition, Troilus was regarded as a paragon of the faithful courtly lover and also of the virtuous pagan knight. Once the custom of courtly love had faded, his fate was regarded less sympathetically.

Little attention was paid to the character during the 18th and 19th centuries. However, Troilus has reappeared in 20th and 21st century retellings of the Trojan War by authors who have chosen elements from both the classical and medieval versions of his story.

==The story in the ancient world==
For the ancient Greeks, the tale of the Trojan War and the surrounding events appeared in its most definitive form in the Epic Cycle of eight narrative poems from the archaic period in Greece (750 BC – 480 BC). The story of Troilus is one of a number of incidents that helped provide structure to a narrative that extended over several decades and 77 books from the beginning of the &quot;Cypria&quot; to the end of the &quot;Telegony&quot;. The character&#x27;s death early in the war and the prophecies surrounding him demonstrated that all Trojan efforts to defend their home would be in vain. His symbolic significance is evidenced by linguistic analysis of his Greek name &quot;Troilos&quot;. It can be interpreted as an elision of the names of Tros and Ilos, the legendary founders of Troy, as a diminutive or pet name &quot;little Tros&quot; or as an elision of &quot;Troíē&quot; (Troy) and &quot;lúein&quot; (to destroy). These multiple possibilities emphasise the link between the fates of Troilus and of the city where he lived. On another level, Troilus&#x27; fate can also be seen as foreshadowing the subsequent deaths of his murderer Achilles, and of his nephew Astyanax and sister Polyxena, who, like Troilus, die at the altar in at least some versions of their stories.

Given this, it is unfortunate that the &quot;Cypria&quot;—the part of the &quot;Epic Cycle&quot; that covers the period of the Trojan War of Troilus&#x27; death—does not survive. Indeed, no complete narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the myth that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.

Partially compensating for the missing texts are the physical artifacts that remain from the archaic and classical periods. The story of the circumstances around Troilus&#x27; death was a popular theme among pottery painters. (The Beazley Archive website lists 108 items of Attic pottery alone from the 6th to 4th centuries BC containing images of the character.) Troilus also features on other works of art and decorated objects from those times. It is a common practice for those writing about the story of Troilus as it existed in ancient times to use both literary sources and artifacts to build up an understanding of what seems to have been the most standard form of the myth and its variants. The brutality of this standard form of the myth is highlighted by commentators such as Alan Sommerstein, an expert on ancient Greek drama, who describes it as &quot;horrific&quot; and &quot;[p]erhaps the most vicious of all the actions traditionally attributed to Achilles.&quot;

===The standard myth: the beautiful Troilus murdered===

Troilus is an adolescent boy or young man, the son of Hecuba, queen of Troy. As he is so beautiful, Troilus is taken to be the son of the god Apollo. However, Hecuba&#x27;s husband, King Priam, treats him as his own much-loved child.

A prophecy says that Troy will not fall if Troilus lives to the age of twenty. So the goddess Athena encourages the Greek warrior Achilles to seek him out early in the Trojan War. Troilus is known to take great delight in his horses. Achilles ambushes him and his sister Polyxena when he has ridden with her for water from a well in the Thymbra – an area outside Troy where there is a temple of Apollo.

The Greek is struck by the beauty of both Trojans and is filled with lust. It is the fleeing Troilus whom swift-footed Achilles catches, dragging him by the hair from his horse. The young prince refuses to yield to Achilles&#x27; sexual attentions and somehow escapes, taking refuge in the nearby temple. But the warrior follows him in, and beheads him at the altar before help can arrive. The mourning of the Trojans at Troilus&#x27; death afterward is great.

This sacrilege leads to Achilles’ own death, when Apollo avenges himself by helping Paris strike Achilles with the arrow that pierces his heel.

===Ancient literary sources supporting the standard myth===

====Homer and the missing texts of the archaic and classical periods====
The earliest surviving literary reference to Troilus is in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, which formed one part of the &quot;Epic Cycle&quot;. It is believed that Troilus&#x27; name was not invented by Homer and that a version of his story was already in existence. Late in the poem, Priam berates his surviving sons, and compares them unfavourably to their dead brothers including &quot;Trôïlon hippiocharmên&quot;. The interpretation of &quot;hippiocharmên&quot; is controversial but the root &quot;hipp-&quot; implies a connection with horses. For the purpose of the version of the myth given above, the word has been taken as meaning &quot;delighting in horses&quot;. Sommerstein believes that Homer wishes to imply in this reference that Troilus was killed in battle, but argues that Priam&#x27;s later description of Achilles as &quot;andros paidophonoio&quot; (&quot;boy-slaying man&quot;) indicates that Homer was aware of the story of Troilus as a murdered child; Sommerstein believes that Homer is playing here on the ambiguity of the root &quot;paido-&quot; meaning boy in both the sense of a young male and of a son.
Troilus&#x27; death was also described in the &quot;Cypria&quot;, one of the parts of the &quot;Epic Cycle&quot; that is no longer extant. The poem covered the events preceding the Trojan War and the first part of the war itself up to the events of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Although the &quot;Cypria&quot; does not survive, most of an ancient summary of the contents, thought to be by Eutychius Proclus, remains. Fragment 1 mentions that Achilles killed Troilus, but provides no more detail. However, Sommerstein takes the verb used to describe the killing (&quot;phoneuei&quot;) as meaning that Achilles murders Troilus.

In Athens, the early tragedians Phrynicus and Sophocles both wrote plays called &quot;Troilos&quot; and the comic playwright Strattis wrote a parody of the same name. Of the esteemed Nine lyric poets of the archaic and classical periods, Stesichorus may have referred to Troilus&#x27; story in his &quot;Iliupersis&quot; and Ibycus may have written in detail about the character. With the exception of these authors, no other pre-Hellenistic written source is known to have considered Troilus at any length.

Unfortunately, all that remains of these texts are the smallest fragments or summaries and references to them by other authors. What does survive can be in the form of papyrus fragments, plot summaries by later authors or quotations by other authors. In many cases these are just odd words in lexicons or grammar books with an attribution to the original author. Reconstructions of the texts are necessarily speculative and should be viewed with &quot;wary but sympathetic scepticism&quot;. In Ibycus&#x27; case all that remains is a parchment fragment containing a mere six or seven words of verse accompanied with a few lines of scholia. Troilus is described in the poem as godlike and is killed outside Troy. From the scholia, he is clearly a boy. The scholia also refer to a sister, someone &quot;watching out&quot; and a murder in the sanctuary of Thymbrian Apollo. While acknowledging that these details may have been reports of other later sources, Sommerstein thinks it probable that Ibycus told the full ambush story and is thus the earliest identifiable source for it. Of Phrynicus, one fragment remains considered to refer to Troilus. This speaks of &quot;the light of love glowing on his reddening cheeks&quot;.

Of all these fragmentary pre-Hellenistic sources, the most is known of Sophocles &quot;Troilos&quot;. Even so, only 54 words have been identified as coming from the play. Fragment 619 refers to Troilus as an &quot;andropais&quot;, a man-boy. Fragment 621 indicates that Troilus was going to a spring with a companion to fetch water or to water his horses. A scholion to the &quot;Iliad&quot; states that Sophocles has Troilus ambushed by Achilles while exercising his horses in the Thymbra. Fragment 623 indicates that Achilles mutilated Troilus&#x27; corpse by a method known as maschalismos. This involved preventing the ghost of a murder victim from returning to haunt their killer by cutting off the corpse&#x27;s extremities and stringing them under its armpits. Sophocles is thought to have also referred to the maschalismos of Troilus in a fragment taken to be from an earlier play &quot;Polyxene&quot;.

Sommerstein attempts a reconstruction of the plot of the &quot;Troilos&quot;, in which the title character is incestuously in love with Polyxena and tries to discourage the interest in marrying her shown by both Achilles and Sarpedon, a Trojan ally and son of Zeus. Sommerstein argues that Troilus is accompanied on his fateful journey to his death, not by Polyxena, but by his tutor, a eunuch Greek slave. Certainly there is a speaking role for a eunuch who reports being castrated by Hecuba and someone reports the loss of their adolescent master. The incestuous love is deduced by Sommerstein from a fragment of Strattis&#x27; parody, assumed to partially quote Sophocles, and from his understanding that the Sophocles play intends to contrast barbarian customs, including incest, with Greek ones. Sommerstein also sees this as solving what he considers the need for an explanation of Achilles&#x27; treatment of Troilus&#x27; corpse, the latter being assumed to have insulted Achilles in the process of warning him off Polyxena. Italian professor of English and expert on Troilus, Piero Boitani, on the other hand, considers Troilus&#x27; rejection of Achilles&#x27; sexual advances towards him as sufficient motive for the mutilation.

====&quot;Alexandra&quot;====
The first surviving text with more than the briefest mention of Troilus is &quot;Alexandra&quot;, a Hellenistic poem dating from no earlier than the 3rd century BC by the tragedian Lycophron (or a namesake of his). The poem consists of the obscure prophetic ravings of Cassandra:

This passage is explained in the Byzantine writer John Tzetzes&#x27; scholia as a reference to Troilus seeking to avoid the unwanted sexual advances of Achilles by taking refuge in his father Apollo&#x27;s temple. When he refuses to come out, Achilles goes in and kills him on the altar. Lycophron&#x27;s scholiast also says that Apollo started to plan Achilles&#x27; death after the murder. This begins to build up the elements of the version of Troilus&#x27; story given above: he is young, much loved and beautiful; he has divine ancestry, is beheaded by his rejected Greek lover and, we know from Homer, had something to do with horses. The reference to Troilus as a &quot;lion whelp&quot; hints at his having the potential to be a great hero, but there is no explicit reference to a prophecy linking the possibility of Troilus reaching adulthood and Troy then surviving.

====Other written sources====
No other extended passage about Troilus exists from before the Augustan Age by which time other versions of the character&#x27;s story have emerged. The remaining sources compatible with the standard myth are considered below by theme.
; Parentage : The Apollodorus responsible for the &quot;Library&quot; lists Troilus last of Priam and Hecuba&#x27;s sons – a detail adopted in the later tradition – but then adds that it is said that the boy was fathered by Apollo. On the other hand, Hyginus includes Troilus in the middle of a list of Priam&#x27;s sons without further comment. In the early Christian writings the Clementine &quot;Homilies&quot;, it is suggested that Apollo was Troilus&#x27; lover rather than his father.

; Youthfulness : Horace emphasises Troilus&#x27; youth by calling him &quot;inpubes&quot; (&quot;unhairy&quot;, i.e. pre-pubescent or, figuratively, not old enough to bear arms). Dio Chrysostom derides Achilles in his Trojan discourse, complaining that all that the supposed hero achieved before Homer was the capture of Troilus who was still a boy.

; Prophecies : The First Vatican Mythographer reports a prophecy that Troy will not fall if Troilus reaches the age of twenty and gives that as a reason for Achilles&#x27; ambush. In Plautus, Troilus&#x27; death is given as one of three conditions that must be met before Troy would fall.

; Beauty : Ibycus, in seeking to praise his patron, compares him to Troilus, the most beautiful of the Greeks and the Trojans. Dio Chrysostom refers to Troilus as one of many examples of different kinds of beauty. Statius compares a beautiful dead slave missed by his master to Troilus.

; Object of pederastic love : Servius, in his scholia to the passage from Virgil discussed below, says that Achilles lures Troilus to him with a gift of doves. Troilus then dies in the Greek&#x27;s embrace. Robert Graves interprets this as evidence of the vigour of Achilles&#x27; love-making but Timothy Gantz considers that the &quot;how or why&quot; of Servius&#x27; version of Troilus&#x27; death is unclear. Sommerstein favours Graves&#x27;s interpretation saying that murder was not a part of ancient pederastic relations and that nothing in Servius suggests an intentional killing.

; Location of ambush and death : A number of reports have come down of Troilus&#x27; death variously mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Iliad&quot; says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo&#x27;s walls. Gantz struggles to make sense of what he sees as contradictory material, feeling that Achilles&#x27; running down of Troilus&#x27; horse makes no sense if Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building. He speculates that the ambush at the well and the sacrifice in the temple could be two different versions of the story or, alternatively, that Achilles takes Troilus to the temple to sacrifice him as an insult to Apollo.

; Mourning : Trojan and, especially, Troilus&#x27; own family&#x27;s mourning at his death seems to have epitomised grief at the loss of a child in classical civilization. Horace, Callimachus and Cicero all refer to Troilus in this way.

===Ancient art and artifact sources===

Ancient Greek art, as found in pottery and other remains, frequently depicts scenes associated with Troilus&#x27; death: the ambush, the pursuit, the murder itself and the fight over his body. Depictions of Troilus in other contexts are unusual. One such exception, a red-figure vase painting from Apulia c.340BC, shows Troilus as a child with Priam.

In the ambush, Troilus and Polyxena approach a fountain where Achilles lies in wait. This scene was familiar enough in the ancient world for a parody to exist from c.400BC showing a dumpy Troilus leading a mule to the fountain. In most serious depictions of the scene, Troilus rides a horse, normally with a second next to him. He is usually, but not always, portrayed as a beardless youth. He is often shown naked; otherwise he wears a cloak or tunic. Achilles is always armed and armoured. Occasionally, as on the vase picture at , or the fresco from the Tomb of the Bulls shown at the head of this article, either Troilus or Polyxena is absent, indicating how the ambush is linked to each of their stories. In the earliest definitely identified version of this scene, (a Corinthian vase c.580BC), Troilus is bearded and Priam is also present. Both these features are unusual. More common is a bird sitting on the fountain; normally a raven, symbol of Apollo and his prophetic powers and thus a final warning to Troilus of his doom; sometimes a cock, a common love gift suggesting that Achilles attempted to seduce Troilus. In some versions, for example an Attic amphora in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston dating from c.530BC (seen here ) Troilus has a dog running with him. On one Etruscan vase from the 6th century BC, doves are flying from Achilles to Troilus, suggestive of the love gift in Servius. The fountain itself is conventionally decorated with a lion motif.

The earliest identified version of the pursuit or chase is from the third quarter of the 7th century BC. Next chronologically is the best known version on the François Vase by Kleitias. The number of characters shown on pottery scenes varies with the size and shape of the space available. The François Vase is decorated with several scenes in long narrow strips. This means that the Troilus frieze is heavily populated. In the centre, (which can be seen at the Perseus Project at ,) is the fleeing Troilus, riding one horse with the reins of the other in his hand. Below them is the vase—which Polyxena (partially missing), who is ahead of him, has dropped. Achilles is largely missing but it is clear that he is armoured. They are running towards Troy where Antenor gestures towards Priam. Hector and Polites, brothers of Troilus, emerge from the city walls in the hope of saving Troilus. Behind Achilles are a number of deities, Athena, Thetis (Achilles&#x27; mother), Hermes, and Apollo (just arriving). Two Trojans are also present, the woman gesturing to draw the attention of a youth filling his vase. As the deities appear only in pictorial versions of the scene, their role is subject to interpretation. Boitani sees Athena as urging Achilles on and Thetis as worried by the arrival of Apollo who, as Troilus&#x27; protector, represents a future threat to Achilles. He does not indicate what he thinks Hermes may be talking to Thetis about. The classicist and art historian Professor Thomas H. Carpenter sees Hermes as a neutral observer, Athena and Thetis as urging Achilles on, and the arrival of Apollo as the artist&#x27;s indication of the god&#x27;s future role in Achilles&#x27; death. As Athena is not traditionally a patron of Achilles, Sommerstein sees her presence in this and other portrayals of Troilus&#x27; death as evidence of the early standing of the prophetic link between Troilus&#x27; death and the fall of Troy, Athena being driven, above all, by her desire for the city&#x27;s destruction.

The standard elements in the pursuit scene are Troilus, Achilles, Polyxena, the two horses and the fallen vase. On two tripods, an amphora and a cup, Achilles already has Troilus by the hair. A famous vase in the British Museum, which gave the Troilos Painter the name by which he is now known, shows the two Trojans looking back in fear, as the beautiful youth whips his horse on. This vase can be seen at the Perseus Project site . The water spilling from the shattered vase below Troilus&#x27; horse, symbolises the blood he is about to shed.

The iconography of the eight legs and hooves of the horses can be used to identify Troilus on pottery where his name does not appear; for example, on a Corinthian vase where Troilus is shooting at his pursuers and on a peaceful scene on a Chalcidian krater where the couples Paris and Helen, Hector and Andromache are labelled, but the youth riding one of a pair of horses is not.

A later Southern Italian interpretation of the story is on vases held respectively at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. On the krater from c.380-70BC at Troilus can be seen with just one horse trying to defend himself with a throwing spear; on the hydria from c.325-320BC at , Achilles is pulling down the youth&#x27;s horse.

The earliest known depictions of the death or murder of Troilus are on shield bands from the turn of the 7th into the 6th century BC found at Olympia. On these, a warrior with a sword is about to stab a naked youth at an altar. On one, Troilus clings to a tree (which Boitani takes for the laurel sacred to Apollo). A crater contemporary with this shows Achilles at the altar holding the naked Troilus upside down while Hector, Aeneas and an otherwise unknown Trojan Deithynos arrive in the hope of saving the youth. In some depictions Troilus is begging for mercy. On an amphora, Achilles has the struggling Troilus slung over his shoulder as he goes to the altar. Boitani, in his survey of the story of Troilus through the ages, considers it of significance that two artifacts (a vase and a sarcophagus) from different periods link Troilus&#x27; and Priam&#x27;s death by showing them on the two sides of the same item, as if they were the beginning and end of the story of the fall of Troy. Achilles is the father of Neoptolemus, who slays Priam at the altar during the sack of Troy. Thus the war opens with a father killing a son and closes with a son killing a father.

Some pottery shows Achilles, already having killed Troilus, using his victim&#x27;s severed head as a weapon as Hector and his companions arrive too late to save him; some includes the watching Athena, occasionally with Hermes. At is one such picture showing Achilles fighting Hector over the altar. Troilus&#x27; body is slumped and the boy&#x27;s head is either flying through the air, or stuck to the end of Achilles&#x27; spear. Athena and Hermes look on. Aeneas and Deithynos are behind Hector.

Sometimes details of the closely similar deaths of Troilus and Astyanax are exchanged. shows one such image where it is unclear which murder is portrayed. The age of the victim is often an indicator of which story is being told and the relative small size here might point towards the death of Astyanax, but it is common to show even Troilus as much smaller than his murderer, (as is the case with the kylix pictured to the above right). Other factors in this case are the presence of Priam (suggesting Astyanax), that of Athena (suggesting Troilus) and the fact that the scene is set outside the walls of Troy (again suggesting Troilus).

===A variant myth: the boy-soldier overwhelmed===
A different version of Troilus&#x27; death appears on a red-figure cup by Oltos. Troilus is on his knees, still in the process of drawing his sword when Achilles&#x27; spear has already stabbed him and Aeneas comes too late to save him. Troilus wears a helmet, but it is pushed up to reveal a beautiful young face. This is the only such depiction of Troilus&#x27; death in early figurative art. However, this version of Troilus as a youth defeated in battle appears also in written sources.

====Virgil and other Latin sources====
This version of the story appears in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, in a passage describing a series of paintings decorating the walls of a temple of Juno. The painting immediately next to the one depicting Troilus shows the death of Rhesus, another character killed because of prophecies linked to the fall of Troy. Other pictures are similarly calamitous.

 In a description whose pathos is heightened by the fact that it is seen through a compatriot&#x27;s eyes, Troilus is &quot;infelix puer&quot; (&quot;unlucky boy&quot;) who has met Achilles in &quot;unequal&quot; combat. Troilus&#x27; horses flee while he, still holding their reins, hangs from the chariot, his head and hair trailing behind while the backward-pointing spear scribbles in the dust. (The First Vatican Mythographer elaborates on this story, explaining that Troilus&#x27;s body is dragged right to the walls of Troy.)

In his commentary on the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Servius considers this story as a deliberate departure from the &quot;true&quot; story, bowdlerized to make it more suitable for an epic poem. He interprets it as showing Troilus overpowered in a straight fight. Gantz, however, argues that this might be a variation of the ambush story. For him, Troilus is unarmed because he went out not expecting combat and the backward pointing spear was what Troilus was using as a goad in a manner similar to characters elsewhere in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Sommerstein, on the other hand believes that the spear is Achilles&#x27; that has struck Troilus in the back. The youth is alive but mortally wounded as he is being dragged towards Troy.

An issue here is the ambiguity of the word &quot;congressus&quot; (&quot;met&quot;). It often refers to meeting in a conventional combat but can have reference to other types of meetings too. A similar ambiguity appears in Seneca and in Ausonius&#x27; 19th epitaph, narrated by Troilus himself. The dead prince tells how he has been dragged by his horses after falling in unequal battle with Achilles. A reference in the epitaph comparing Troilus&#x27; death to Hector&#x27;s suggests that Troilus dies later than in the traditional narrative, something that, according to Boitani, also happens in Virgil.

====Greek writers in the boy-soldier tradition====
Quintus of Smyrna, in a passage whose atmosphere Boitani describes as sad and elegiac, retains what for Boitani are the two important issues of the ancient story, that Troilus is doomed by Fate and that his failure to continue his line symbolises Troy&#x27;s fall. In this case, there is no doubt that Troilus entered battle knowingly, for in the &quot;Posthomerica&quot; Troilus&#x27;s armour is one of the funerary gifts after Achilles&#x27; own death. Quintus repeatedly emphasises Troilus&#x27;s youth: he is beardless, virgin of a bride, childlike, beautiful, the most godlike of all Hecuba&#x27;s children. Yet he was lured by Fate to war when he knew no fear and was struck down by Achilles&#x27; spear just as a flower or corn that has borne no seed is killed by the gardener.

In the &quot;Ephemeridos belli Trojani&quot; (&quot;Journal of the Trojan War&quot;), supposedly written by Dictys the Cretan during the Trojan War itself, Troilus is again a defeated warrior, but this time captured with his brother Lycaon. Achilles vindictively orders that their throats be slit in public, because he is angry that Priam has failed to advance talks over a possible marriage to Polyxena. Dictys&#x27; narrative is free from gods and prophecy but he preserves Troilus&#x27; loss as something to be greatly mourned:
The Trojans raised a cry of grief and, mourning loudly, bewailed the fact that Troilus had met so grievous a death, for they remembered how young he was, who being in the early years of his manhood, was the people&#x27;s favourite, their darling, not only because of his modesty and honesty, but more especially because of his handsome appearance.
==The story in the medieval and Renaissance eras==

In the sources considered so far, Troilus&#x27; only narrative function is his death. The treatment of the character changes in two ways in the literature of the medieval and renaissance periods. First, he becomes an important and active protagonist in the pursuit of the Trojan War itself. Second, he becomes an active heterosexual lover, rather than the passive victim of Achilles&#x27; pederasty. By the time of John Dryden&#x27;s neo-classical adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; it is the ultimate failure of his love affair that defines the character.

For medieval writers, the two most influential ancient sources on the Trojan War were the purported eye-witness accounts of Dares the Phrygian, and Dictys the Cretan, which both survive in Latin versions. In Western Europe the Trojan side of the war was favoured and therefore Dares was preferred over Dictys. Although Dictys&#x27; account positions Troilus&#x27; death later in the war than was traditional, it conforms to antiquity&#x27;s view of him as a minor warrior if one at all. Dares&#x27; &quot;De excidio Trojae historia&quot; (&quot;History of the Fall of Troy&quot;) introduces the character as a hero who takes part in events beyond the story of his death.

Authors of the 12th and 13th centuries such as Joseph of Exeter and Albert of Stade continued to tell the legend of the Trojan War in Latin in a form that follows Dares&#x27; tale with Troilus remaining one of the most important warriors on the Trojan side. However, it was two of their contemporaries, Benoît de Sainte-Maure in his French verse romance and Guido delle Colonne in his Latin prose history, both also admirers of Dares, who were to define the tale of Troy for the remainder of the medieval period. The details of their narrative of the war were copied, for example, in the Laud and Lydgate Troy Books and also in Raoul Lefevre&#x27;s &quot;Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye&quot;. Lefevre, through Caxton&#x27;s 1474 printed translation, was in turn to become the best known retelling of the Troy story in Renaissance England and influenced Shakespeare among others. The story of Troilus as a lover, invented by Benoît and retold by Guido, generated a second line of influence. It was taken up as a tale that could be told in its own right by Boccaccio and then by Chaucer who established a tradition of retelling and elaborating the story in English-language literature, which was to be followed by Henryson and Shakespeare.

===The second Hector, wall of Troy===
As indicated above, it was through the writings of Dares the Phrygian that the portrayal of Troilus as an important warrior was transmitted to medieval times. However, some authors have argued that the tradition of Troilus as a warrior may be older. The passage from the Iliad described above is read by Boitani as implying that Priam put Troilus on a par with the very best of his warrior sons. The description of him in that passage as &quot;hippiocharmên&quot; is rendered by some authorities as meaning a warrior charioteer rather than merely someone who delights in horses. The many missing and partial literary sources might include such a hero. Yet only a single known ancient vase shows Troilus as a warrior falling in a conventional battle.

====Dares====
In Dares, Troilus is the youngest of Priam&#x27;s royal sons, bellicose when peace or truces are suggested and the equal of Hector in bravery, &quot;large and most beautiful... brave and strong for his age, and eager for glory.&quot; He slaughters many Greeks, wounds Achilles and Menelaus, routs the Myrmidons more than once before his horse falls and traps him and Achilles takes the opportunity to put an end to his life. Memnon rescues the body, something that didn&#x27;t happen in many later versions of the tale. Troilus&#x27; death comes near the end of the war not at its beginning. He now outlives Hector and succeeds him as the Trojans&#x27; great leader in battle. Now it is in reaction to Troilus&#x27;s death that Hecuba plots Achilles&#x27; murder.

As the tradition of Troilus the warrior advances through time, the weaponry and the form of combat change. Already in Dares he is a mounted warrior, not a charioteer or foot warrior, something anachronistic to epic narrative. In later versions he is a knight with armour appropriate to the time of writing who fights against other knights and dukes. His expected conduct, including his romance, conforms to courtly or other values contemporary to the writing.

====Description in medieval texts====
The medieval texts follow Dares&#x27; structuring of the narrative in describing Troilus after his parents and four royal brothers Hector, Paris, Deiphobus and Helenus.

Joseph of Exeter, in his &quot;Daretis Phrygii Ilias De bello Troiano&quot; &quot;(The Iliad of Dares the Phrygian on the Trojan War)&quot;, describes the character as follows:
The limbs of Troilus expand and fill his space.
In mind a giant, though a boy in years, he yields
to none in daring deeds with strength in all his parts
his greater glory shines throughout his countenance.
Benoît de Sainte-Maure&#x27;s description in &quot;Le Roman de Troie&quot; (&quot;The Romance of Troy&quot;) is too long to quote in full, but influenced the descriptions that follow. Benoît goes into details of character and facial appearance avoided by other writers. He tells that Troilus was &quot;the fairest of the youths of Troy&quot; with:
fair hair, very charming and naturally shining, eyes bright and full of gaiety... He was not insolent or haughty, but light of heart and gay and amorous. Well was he loved, and well did he love...
Guido delle Colonne&#x27;s &quot;Historia destructionis Troiae&quot; (&quot;History of the Destruction of Troy&quot;) says:
The fifth and last was named Troilus, a young man as courageous as possible in war, about whose valour there are many tales which the present history does not omit later on.
The &quot;Laud Troy Book&quot;:
The youngest doughti Troylus
A doughtier man than he was on
Of hem alle was neuere non,-
Save Ector, that was his brother
There never was goten suche another. 
The boy who in the ancient texts was never Achilles&#x27; match has now become a young knight, a worthy opponent to the Greeks.

====Knight and war leader====
In the medieval and renaissance tradition, Troilus is one of those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam&#x27;s council. In several texts, for example the &quot;Laud Troy Book&quot;, he says that those who disagree with him are better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers who follow him, have Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be reckless before the first battle.

In the medieval texts, Troilus is a doughty knight throughout the war, taking over, as in Dares, after Hector&#x27;s death as the main warrior on the Trojan side. Indeed he is named as a second Hector by Chaucer and Lydgate. These two poets follow Boccaccio in reporting that Troilus kills thousands of Greeks. However, the comparison with Hector can be seen as acknowledging Troilus&#x27; inferiority to his brother through the very need to mention him.

In Joseph, Troilus is greater than Alexander, Hector, Tydeus, Bellona and even Mars, and kills seven Greeks with one blow of his club. He does not strike at opponents&#x27; legs because that would demean his victory. He only fights knights and nobles, and disdains facing the common warriors.

Albert of Stade saw Troilus as so important that he is the title character of his version of the Trojan War. He is &quot;the wall of his homeland, Troy&#x27;s protection, the rose of the military...&quot;

The list of Greek leaders Troilus wounds expands in the various re-tellings of the war from the two in Dares to also include Agamemnon, Diomedes and Menelaus. Guido, in keeping his promise to tell of all Troilus&#x27; valorous deeds, describes many incidents. Troilus is usually victorious but is captured in an early battle by Menestheus before his friends rescue him. This incident reappears in the imitators of Guido, such as Lefevre and the Laud and Lydgate &quot;Troy Books&quot;.

====Death====
Within the medieval Trojan tradition, Achilles withdraws from fighting in the war because he is to marry Polyxena. Eventually, so many of his followers are killed that he decides to rejoin the battle leading to Troilus&#x27; death and, in turn, to Hecuba, Polyxena and Paris plotting Achilles&#x27; murder.
Albert and Joseph follow Dares in having Achilles behead Troilus as he tries to rise after his horse falls. In Guido and authors he influenced, Achilles specifically seeks out Troilus to avenge a previous encounter where Troilus has wounded him. He therefore instructs the Myrmidons to find Troilus, surround him and cut him off from rescue.

In the &quot;Laud Troy Book&quot;, this is because Achilles almost killed Troilus in the previous fight but the Trojan was rescued. Achilles wants to make sure that this does not happen again. This second combat is fought as a straight duel between the two with Achilles, the greater warrior, winning.

In Guido, Lefevre and Lydgate Troilus&#x27; killer&#x27;s behaviour is very different, shorn of any honour. Achilles waits until his men have killed Troilus&#x27; horse and cut loose his armour. Only then
And when he sawe how Troilus nakid stod,
Of longe fightyng awaped and amaat
And from his folke alone disolat


does Achilles attack and behead him.

In an echo of the Iliad, Achilles drags the corpse behind his horse. Thus, the comparison with the Homeric Hector is heightened and, at the same time, aspects of the classical Troilus&#x27;s fate are echoed.

===The lover===
The last aspect of the character of Troilus to develop in the tradition has become the one for which he is best known in modern times. Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; both focus on Troilus in his role as a lover. This theme is first introduced by Benoît de Sainte-Maure in the &quot;Roman de Troie&quot; and developed by Guido delle Colonne. Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Il Filostrato&quot; is the first book to take the love-story as its main theme. Robert Henryson and John Dryden are other authors who dedicate works to it.

The story of Troilus&#x27; romance developed within the context of the male-centred conventions of courtly love and thus the focus of sympathy was to be Troilus and not his beloved. As different authors recreated the romance, they would interpret it in ways affected both by the perspectives of their own times and their individual preoccupations. The story as it would later develop through the works of Boccaccio, Chaucer and Shakespeare is summarised below.

====The story of Troilus and Cressida====
Troilus used to mock the foolishness of other young men&#x27;s love affairs. But one day he sees Cressida in the temple of Athena and falls in love with her. She is a young widow and daughter of the priest Calchas who has defected to the Greek camp.

Embarrassed at having become exactly the sort of person he used to ridicule, Troilus tries to keep his love secret. However, he pines for Cressida and becomes so withdrawn that his friend Pandarus asks why he is unhappy and eventually persuades Troilus to reveal his love.

Pandarus offers to act as a go-between, even though he is Cressida&#x27;s relative and should be guarding her honour. Pandarus convinces Cressida to admit that she returns Troilus&#x27; love and, with Pandarus&#x27;s help, the two are able to consummate their feelings for each other.

Their happiness together is brought to an end when Calchas persuades Agamemnon to arrange Cressida&#x27;s return to him as part of a hostage exchange in which the captive Trojan Antenor is freed. The two lovers are distraught and even think of eloping together but they finally cooperate with the exchange. Despite Cressida&#x27;s initial intention to remain faithful to Troilus, the Greek warrior Diomedes wins her heart. When Troilus learns of this, he seeks revenge on Diomedes and the Greeks and dies in battle. Just as Cressida betrayed Troilus, Antenor was later to betray Troy.

====Benoît and Guido====
In the &quot;Roman de Troie&quot;, the daughter of Calchas whom Troilus loves is called Briseis. Their relationship is first mentioned once the hostage exchange has been agreed:
Whoever had joy or gladness, Troilus suffered affliction and grief. That was for the daughter of Calchas, for he loved her deeply. He had set his whole heart on her; so mightily was he possessed by his love that he thought only of her. She had given herself to him, both her body and her love. Most men knew of that.
In Guido, Troilus&#x27; and Diomedes&#x27; love is now called Briseida. His version (a history) is more moralistic and less touching, removing the psychological complexity of Benoît&#x27;s (a romance) and the focus in his retelling of the love triangle is firmly shifted to the betrayal of Troilus by Briseida. Although Briseida and Diomedes are most negatively caricatured by Guido&#x27;s moralising, even Troilus is subject to criticism as a &quot;fatuous youth&quot; prone, as in the following, to youthful faults.
Troilus, however, after he had learned of his father&#x27;s intention to go ahead and release Briseida and restore her to the Greeks, was overwhelmed and completely wracked by great grief, and almost entirely consumed by tears, anguished sighs, and laments, because he cherished her with the great fervour of youthful love and had been led by the excessive ardour of love into the intense longing of blazing passion. There was no one of his dear ones who could console him.
Briseis, at least for now, is equally affected by the possibility of separation from her lover. Troilus goes to her room and they spend the night together, trying to comfort each other. Troilus is part of the escort to hand her over the next day. Once she is with the Greeks, Diomedes is immediately struck by her beauty. Although she is not hostile, she cannot accept him as her lover. Meanwhile Calchas tells her to accept for herself that the gods have decreed Troy&#x27;s fall and that she is safer now she is with the Greeks.

A battle soon takes place and Diomedes unseats Troilus from his horse. The Greek sends it as a gift to Briseis/Briseida with an explanation that it had belonged to her old lover.
In Benoît, Briseis complains at Diomedes&#x27; seeking to woo her by humbling Troilus, but in Guido all that remains of her long speech in Benoît is that she &quot;cannot hold him in hatred who loves me with such purity of heart.&quot;

Diomedes soon does win her heart. In Benoît, it is through his display of love and she gives him her glove as a token. Troilus seeks him out in battle and utterly defeats him. He saves Diomedes&#x27; life, only so that he can bring her a message of Troilus&#x27; contempt.
In Guido, Briseida&#x27;s change of heart comes after Troilus wounds Diomedes seriously. Briseida tends Diomedes and then decides to take him as her lover, because she does not know if she will ever meet Troilus again.

In later medieval tellings of the war, the episode of Troilus and Briseida/Cressida is acknowledged and often given as a reason for Diomedes and Troilus to seek each other out in battle. The love story also becomes one that is told separately.

====Boccaccio====
The first major work to take the story of Troilus&#x27; failed love as its central theme is Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Il Filostrato&quot;. The title means &quot;the one struck down by love&quot;. There is an overt purpose to the text. In the proem, Boccaccio himself is Filostrato and addresses his own love who has rejected him.

Boccaccio introduces a number of features of the story that were to be taken up by Chaucer. Most obvious is that Troilus&#x27; love is now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative is the introduction of the go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, weeping when his love is unsuccessful, generous when it is.

Boccaccio fills in the history before the hostage exchange as follows. Troilus mocks the lovelorn glances of other men who put their trust in women before falling victim to love himself when he sees Cressida, here a young widow, in the Palladium, the temple of Athena. Troilus keeps his love secret and is made miserable by it. Pandarus, Troilus&#x27; best friend and Cressida&#x27;s cousin in this version of the story, acts as go-between after persuading Troilus to explain his distress. In accordance with the conventions of courtly love, Troilus&#x27; love remains secret from all except Pandarus, until Cassandra eventually divines the reason for Troilus&#x27; subsequent distress.

After the hostage exchange is agreed, Troilus suggests elopement, but Cressida argues that he should not abandon Troy and that she should protect her honour. Instead, she promises to meet him within ten days. Troilus spends much of the intervening time on the city walls, sighing in the direction where Cressida has gone. No horses or sleeves, as used by Guido or Benoît, are involved in Troilus&#x27; learning of Cressida&#x27;s change of heart. Instead a dream hints at what has happened, and then the truth is confirmed when a brooch – previously a gift from Troilus to Cressida – is found on Diomedes&#x27; looted clothing. In the meantime, Cressida has kept up the pretence in their correspondence that she still loves Troilus. After Cressida&#x27;s betrayal is confirmed, Troilus becomes ever fiercer in battle.

====Chaucer and his successors====

Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; reflects a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio&#x27;s poem. Chaucer does not have his own wounded love to display and therefore allows himself an ironic detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio&#x27;s final canto, which returns to the poet&#x27;s own situation, Chaucer&#x27;s palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness of earthly emotions. About a third of the lines of the &quot;Troilus&quot; are adapted from the much shorter &quot;Il Filostrato&quot;, leaving room for a more detailed and characterised narrative.

Chaucer&#x27;s Criseyde is swayed by Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and more active in what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This passivity is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde&#x27;s bedroom and is lifted into her bed by Pandarus. Troilus&#x27; repeated emotional paralysis is comparable to that of Hamlet who may have been based on him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.

Another difference in Troilus&#x27; characterisation from the &quot;Filostrato&quot; is that he is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers because of their putting trust in women, he mocks them because of how love affects them. Troilus&#x27; vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde&#x27;s vacillations and Pandarus&#x27; manoeuvrings.

In his storytelling Chaucer links the fates of Troy and Troilus, the mutual downturn in fortune following the exchange of Criseyde for the treacherous Antenor being the most significant parallel.
Little has changed in the general sweep of the plot from Boccaccio. Things are just more detailed, with Pandarus, for example, involving Priam&#x27;s middle son Deiphobus during his attempts to unite Troilus and Cressida. Another scene that Chaucer adds was to be reworked by Shakespeare. In it, Pandarus seeks to persuade Cressida of Troilus&#x27; virtues over those of Hector, before uncle and niece witness Troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with much damage to his helmet. Chaucer also includes details from the earlier narratives. So, reference is made not just to Boccaccio&#x27;s brooch, but to the glove, the captured horse and the battles of the two lovers in Benoît and Guido.

Because of the great success of the &quot;Troilus&quot;, the love story was popular as a free standing tale to be retold by English-language writers throughout the 15th and 16th centuries and into the 17th century. The theme was treated either seriously or in burlesque. For many authors, true Troilus, false Cresseid and pandering Pandarus became ideal types eventually to be referred to together as such in Shakespeare.

During the same period, English retellings of the broader theme of the Trojan War tended to avoid Boccaccio&#x27;s and Chaucer&#x27;s additions to the story, though their authors, including Caxton, commonly acknowledged Chaucer as a respected predecessor. John Lydgate&#x27;s &quot;Troy Book&quot; is an exception. Pandarus is one of the elements from Chaucer&#x27;s poem that Lydgate incorporates, but Guido provides his overall narrative framework. As with other authors, Lydgate&#x27;s treatment contrasts Troilus&#x27; steadfastness in all things with Cressida&#x27;s fickleness. The events of the war and the love story are interwoven. Troilus&#x27; prowess in battle markedly increases once he becomes aware that Diomedes is beginning to win Cressida&#x27;s heart, but it is not long after Diomedes final victory in love when Achilles and his Myrmidons treacherously attack and kill Troilus and maltreat his corpse, concluding Lydgate&#x27;s treatment of the character as an epic hero, who is the purest of all those who appear in the &quot;Troy Book&quot;.

Of all the treatments of the story of Troilus and, especially, Cressida in the period between Chaucer and Shakespeare, it is Robert Henryson&#x27;s that receives the most attention from modern critics. His poem &quot;The Testament of Cresseid&quot; is described by the Middle English expert C. David Benson as the &quot;only fifteenth century poem written in Great Britain that begins to rival the moral and artistic complexity of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus&quot;&quot;. In the &quot;Testament&quot; the title-character is abandoned by Diomedes and then afflicted with leprosy so that she becomes unrecognizable to Troilus. He pities the lepers she is with and is generous to her because she reminds him of the idol of her in his mind, but he remains the virtuous pagan knight and does not achieve the redemption that she does. Even so, following Henryson Troilus was seen as a representation of generosity.

====Shakespeare and Dryden====
Another approach to Troilus&#x27; love story in the centuries following Chaucer is to treat Troilus as a fool, something Shakespeare does in allusions to him in plays leading up to &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;problem play&quot; there are elements of Troilus the fool. However, this can be excused by his age. He is an almost beardless youth, unable to fully understand the workings of his own emotions, in the middle of an adolescent infatuation, more in love with love and his image of Cressida than the real woman herself. He displays a mixture of idealism about eternally faithful lovers and of realism, condemning Hector&#x27;s &quot;vice of mercy&quot;. His concept of love involves both a desire for immediate sexual gratification and a belief in eternal faithfulness. He also displays a mixture of constancy, (in love and supporting the continuation of war) and inconsistency (changing his mind twice in the first scene on whether to go to battle or not). More a Hamlet than a Romeo, by the end of the play his illusions of love shattered and Hector dead, Troilus might show signs of maturing, recognising the nature of the world, rejecting Pandarus and focusing on revenge for his brother&#x27;s death rather than for a broken heart or a stolen horse. The novelist and academic Joyce Carol Oates, on the other hand, sees Troilus as beginning and ending the play in frenzies – of love and then hatred. For her, Troilus is unable to achieve the equilibrium of a tragic hero despite his learning experiences, because he remains a human-being who belongs to a banal world where love is compared to food and cooking and sublimity cannot be achieved.

&quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;&#x27;s sources include Chaucer, Lydgate, Caxton and Homer, but there are creations of Shakespeare&#x27;s own too and his tone is very different. Shakespeare wrote at a time when the traditions of courtly love were dead and when England was undergoing political and social change. Shakespeare&#x27;s treatment of the theme of Troilus&#x27; love is much more cynical than Chaucer&#x27;s, and the character of Pandarus is now grotesque. Indeed, all the heroes of the Trojan War are degraded and mocked. Troilus&#x27; actions are subject to the gaze and commentary of both the venal Pandarus and of the cynical Thersites who tells us:
...That dissembling abominable varlet Diomed has got that same scurvy, doting, foolish knave&#x27;s sleeve of Troy there in his helm. I would fain see them meet, that that same young Trojan ass, that loves the whore there, might send that Greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve back to the dissembling luxurious drab of a sleeveless errand...


The action is compressed and truncated, beginning &quot;in medias res&quot; with Pandarus already working for Troilus and praising his virtues to Cressida over those of the other knights they see returning from battle, but comically mistaking him for Deiphobus. The Trojan lovers are together only one night before the hostage exchange takes place. They exchange a glove and a sleeve as love tokens, but the next night Ulysses takes Troilus to Calchas&#x27; tent, significantly near Menelaus&#x27; tent. There they witness Diomedes successfully seducing Cressida after taking Troilus&#x27; sleeve from her. The young Trojan struggles with what his eyes and ears tell him, wishing not to believe it. Having previously considered abandoning the senselessness of war in favour of his role of lover and having then sought to reconcile love and knightly conduct, he is now left with war as his only role.

Both the fights between Troilus and Diomedes from the traditional narrative of Benoît and Guido take place the next day in Shakespeare&#x27;s retelling. Diomedes captures Troilus&#x27; horse in the first fight and sends it to Cressida. Then the Trojan triumphs in the second, though Diomedes escapes. But in a deviation from this narrative it is Hector, not Troilus, whom the Myrmidons surround in the climactic battle of the play and whose body is dragged behind Achilles&#x27; horse. Troilus himself is left alive vowing revenge for Hector&#x27;s death and rejecting Pandarus. Troilus&#x27; story ends, as it began, &quot;in medias res&quot; with him and the remaining characters in his love-triangle remaining alive.

Some seventy years after Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus&quot; was first presented, John Dryden re-worked it as a tragedy, in his view strengthening Troilus&#x27; character and indeed the whole play, by removing many of the unresolved threads in the plot and ambiguities in Shakespeare&#x27;s portrayal of the protagonist as a believable youth rather than a clear-cut and thoroughly sympathetic hero. Dryden described this as &quot; that heap of Rubbish, under which many excellent thoughts lay bury&#x27;d.&quot; His Troilus is less passive on stage about the hostage exchange, arguing with Hector over the handing over of Cressida, who remains faithful. Her scene with Diomedes that Troilus witnesses is her attempt &quot;to deceive deceivers&quot;. She throws herself at her warring lovers&#x27; feet to protect Troilus and commits suicide to prove her loyalty. Unable to leave a still living Troilus on the stage, as Shakespeare did, Dryden restores his death at the hands of Achilles and the Myrmidons but only after Troilus has killed Diomedes. According to P. Boitani, Dryden goes to &quot;the opposite extreme of Shakespeare&#x27;s... all problems and therefore the tragedy&quot;.

==Modern versions==
After Dryden&#x27;s Shakespeare, Troilus is almost invisible in literature until the 20th century. Keats does refer to Troilus and Cressida in the context of the &quot;sovereign power of love&quot; and Wordsworth translated some of Chaucer but, as a rule, love was portrayed in ways far different from how it is in the Troilus and Cressida story. Boitani sees the two World Wars and the 20th century&#x27;s engagement &quot;in the recovery of all sorts of past myths&quot; as contributing to a rekindling of interest in Troilus as a human being destroyed by events beyond his control. Similarly Foakes sees the aftermath of one World War and the threat of a second as key elements for the successful revival of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus&quot; in two productions in the first half of the 20th century, and one of the authors discussed below names Barbara Tuchman&#x27;s &quot;The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam&quot; as the trigger for his wish to retell the Trojan war.

Boitani discusses the modern use of the character of Troilus in a chapter entitled &quot;Eros and Thanatos&quot;. Love and death, the latter either as a tragedy in itself or as an epic symbol of Troy&#x27;s own destruction, therefore, are the two core elements of the Troilus myth for the editor of the first book-length survey of it from ancient to modern times. He sees the character as incapable of transformation on a heroic scale in the manner of Ulysses and also blocked from the possibility of development as an archetypal figure of troubled youth by Hamlet. Troilus&#x27; appeal for the 20th and 21st century is his very humanity.

Belief in the medieval tradition of the Trojan War that followed Dictys and Dares survived the Revival of Learning in the Renaissance and the advent of the first English translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot; in the form of Chapman&#x27;s Homer. (Shakespeare used both Homer and Lefevre as sources for his &quot;Troilus&quot;.) However the two supposedly eye-witness accounts were finally discredited by Jacob Perizonius in the early years of the 18th century. With the chief source for his portrayal as one of the most active warriors of the Trojan War undermined, Troilus has become an optional character in modern Trojan fiction, except for those that retell the love story itself. Lindsay Clarke and Phillip Parotti, for example, omit Troilus altogether. Hilary Bailey includes a character of that name in &quot;Cassandra: Princess of Troy&quot; but little remains of the classical or medieval versions except that he fights Diomedes. However, some of the over sixty re-tellings of the Trojan War since 1916 do feature the character.

===Once more a man-boy===
One consequence of the reassessment of sources is the reappearance of Troilus in his ancient form of &quot;andropais&quot;. Troilus takes this form in Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;The Trojan War Will Not Take Place&quot;, his first successful reappearance in the 20th century. Troilus is a fifteen-year-old boy whom Helen has noticed following her around. After turning down the opportunity to kiss her when she offers and when confronted by Paris, he eventually accepts the kiss at the end of the play just as Troy has committed to war. He is thus a symbol of the whole city&#x27;s fatal fascination with Helen.

Troilus, in one of his ancient manifestations as a boy-soldier overwhelmed, reappears both in works Boitani discusses and those he does not. Christa Wolf in her &quot;Kassandra&quot; features a seventeen-year-old Troilus, first to die of all the sons of Priam. The novel&#x27;s treatment of the character&#x27;s death has features of both medieval and ancient versions. Troilus has just gained his first love, once more called Briseis. It is only after his death that she is to betray him. On the first day of the war, Achilles seeks Troilus out and forces him into battle with the help of the Myrmidons. Troilus tries to fight in the way he has been taught princes should do, but Achilles strikes the boy down and leaps on top of him, before attempting to throttle him. Troilus escapes and runs to the sanctuary of the temple of Apollo where he is helped to take his armour off. Then, in &quot;some of the most powerful and hair-raising&quot; words ever written on Troilus&#x27; death, Wolf describes how Achilles enters the temple, caresses then half-throttles the terrified boy, who lies on the altar, before finally beheading him like a sacrificial victim. After his death, the Trojan council propose that Troilus be officially declared to have been twenty in the hope of avoiding the prophecy about him but Priam, in his grief, refuses as this would insult his dead son further. In &quot;exploring the violent underside of sexuality and the sexual underside of violence&quot;, Wolf revives a theme suggested by the ancient vases where an &quot;erotic aura seems to pervade representations of a fully armed Achilles pursuing or butchering a naked, boyish Troilus&quot;.

Colleen McCullough is another author who incorporates both the medieval Achilles&#x27; seeking Troilus out in battle and the ancient butchery at the altar. Her &quot;The Song of Troy&quot; includes two characters, Troilos and Ilios, who are Priam&#x27;s youngest children – both with prophecies attached and both specifically named for the city&#x27;s founders. They are eight and seven respectively when Paris leaves for Greece and somewhere in their late teens when killed. Troilos is made Priam&#x27;s heir after Hector&#x27;s death, against the boy&#x27;s will. Odysseus&#x27;s spies learn of the prophecy that Troy will not fall if Troilos comes of age. Achilles therefore seeks him out in the next battle and kills him with a spear-cast to his throat. In a reference to the medieval concept of Troilus as the second Hector, Automedon observes that &quot;with a few more years added, he might have made another Hektor.&quot; Ilios is the last son of Priam to die, killed at the altar in front of his parents by Neoptolemos.

Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s &quot;The Firebrand&quot; features an even younger Troilus, just twelve when he becomes Hector&#x27;s charioteer. (His brother wants to keep a protective eye on him now he is ready for war.) Troilus helps kill Patroclus. Although he manages to escape the immediate aftermath of Hector&#x27;s death, he is wounded. After the Trojans witness Achilles&#x27; treatment of Hector&#x27;s body, Troilus insists on rejoining the battle despite his wounds and Hecuba&#x27;s attempts to stop him. Achilles kills him with an arrow. The mourning Hecuba comments that he did not want to live because he blamed himself for Hector&#x27;s death.

===Reinventing the love story===
A feature already present in the treatments of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration as soon as it is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.

William Walton&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; is the best known and most successful of a clutch of 20th-century operas on the subject after the composers of previous eras had ignored the possibility of setting the story. Christopher Hassall&#x27;s libretto blends elements of Chaucer and Shakespeare with inventions of its own arising from a wish to tighten and compress the plot, the desire to portray Cressida more sympathetically and the search for a satisfactory ending. Antenor is, as usual, exchanged for Cressida but, in this version of the tale, his capture has taken place while he was on a mission for Troilus. Cressida agrees to marry Diomedes after she has not heard from Troilus. His apparent silence, however, is because his letters to her have been intercepted. Troilus arrives at the Greek camp just before the planned wedding. When faced with her two lovers, Cressida chooses Troilus. He is then killed by Calchas with a knife in the back. Diomedes sends his body back to Priam with Calchas in chains. It is now the Greeks who condemn &quot;false Cressida&quot; and seek to keep her but she commits suicide.

Before Cressida kills herself she sings to Troilus to
...turn on that cold river&#x27;s brim
beyond the sun&#x27;s far setting.
Look back from the silent stream
of sleep and long forgetting.
Turn and consider me
and all that was ours;
you shall no desert see
but pale unwithering flowers.
This is one of three references in 20th century literature to Troilus on the banks of the River Styx that Boitani has identified. Louis MacNeice&#x27;s long poem &quot;The Stygian Banks&quot; explicitly takes its name from Shakespeare who has Troilus compare himself to &quot;a strange soul upon the Stygian banks&quot; and call upon Pandarus to transport him &quot;to those fields where I may wallow in the lily beds&quot;. In MacNeice&#x27;s poem the flowers have become children, a paradoxical use of the traditionally sterile Troilus who
Patrols the Stygian banks, eager to cross,
But the value is not on the further side of the river,
The value lies in his eagerness. No communion
In sex or elsewhere can be reached and kept
Perfectly for ever. The closed window,
The river of Styx, the wall of limitation
Beyond which the word beyond loses its meaning,
Are the fertilising paradox, the grille
That, severing, joins, the end to make us begin
Again and again, the infinite dark that sanctions
Our growing flowers in the light, our having children...
The third reference to the Styx is in Christopher Morley&#x27;s &quot;The Trojan Horse&quot;. A return to the romantic comedy of Chaucer is the solution that Boitani sees to the problem of how the love story can survive Shakespeare&#x27;s handling of it. Morley gives us such a treatment in a book that revels in its anachronism. Young Lieutenant (soon to be Captain) Troilus lives his life in 1185 BC where he has carefully timetabled everything from praying, to fighting, to examining his own mistakes. He falls for Cressida after seeing her, as ever, in the Temple of Athena where she wears black, as if mourning the defection of her father, the economist Dr Calchas. The flow of the plot follows the traditional story, but the ending is changed once again. Troilus&#x27; discovery of Cressida&#x27;s change of heart happens just before Troy falls. (Morley uses Boccaccio&#x27;s version of the story of a brooch, or in this case a pin, attached to a piece of Diomedes&#x27; armour as the evidence that convinces the Trojan.) Troilus kills Diomedes as he exits the Trojan Horse, stabbing him in the throat where the captured piece of armour should have been. Then Achilles kills Troilus. The book ends with an epilogue. The Trojan and Greek officers exercise together by the River Styx, all enmities forgotten. A new arrival (Cressida) sees Troilus and Diomedes and wonders why they seem familiar to her. What Boitani calls &quot;a rather dull, if pleasant, ataraxic eternity&quot; replaces Chaucer&#x27;s Christian version of the afterlife.

In Eric Shanower&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Age of Bronze&quot;, currently still being serialised, Troilus is youthful but not the youngest son of Priam and Hecuba. In the first two collected volumes of this version of the Trojan War, Shanower provides a total of six pages of sources covering the story elements of his work alone. These include most of the fictional works discussed above from Guido and Boccaccio down to Morley and Walton. Shanower begins Troilus&#x27; love story with the youth making fun of Polyxena&#x27;s love for Hector and in the process accidentally knocking aside Cressida&#x27;s veil. He follows the latter into the temple of Athena to gawp at her. Pandarus is the widow Cressida&#x27;s uncle encouraging him. Cressida rejects Troilus&#x27; initial advances not because of wanting to act in a seemly manner, as in Chaucer or Shakespeare, but because she thinks of him as just a boy. However, her uncle persuades her to encourage his affection, in the hope that being close to a son of Priam will protect against the hostility of the Trojans to the family of the traitor Calchas. Troilus&#x27; unrequited love is used as comic relief in an otherwise serious retelling of the Trojan War cycle. The character is portrayed as often indecisive and ineffectual as on the second page of this episode sample at the official site . It remains to be seen how Shanower will further develop the story.

Troilus is rewarded a rare happy ending in the early &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Myth Makers&quot;. The script was written by Donald Cotton who had previously adapted Greek tales for the BBC Third Programme. The general tone is one of high comedy combined with a &quot;genuine atmosphere of doom, danger and chaos&quot; with the BBC website listing &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; as an inspiration together with Chaucer, Shakespeare, Homer and Virgil. Troilus is again an &quot;andropais&quot; &quot;seventeen next birthday&quot; described as &quot;looking too young for the military garb&quot;. Both &quot;Cressida&quot; and &quot;Diomede&quot; are the assumed names of the Doctor&#x27;s companions Vicki and Steven. Thus Troilus&#x27; jealousy of Diomede, whom he believes also loves Cressida, is down to confusion about the real situation. In the end &quot;Cressida&quot; decides to leave the Doctor for Troilus and saves the latter from the fall of Troy by finding an excuse to get him away from the city. In a reversal of the usual story, he is able to avenge Hector by killing Achilles: they meet outside Troy and the Greek hero, despite being more than a match for the young Trojan, catches his heel on some vegetation and stumbles. Subsequently the two lovers join up with Aeneas, implying a role in the events of &quot;The Aeneid&quot;. The story was originally intended to end more conventionally, with &quot;Cressida&quot;, despite her love for him, apparently abandoning him for &quot;Diomede&quot;, but the producers declined to renew co-star Maureen O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s contract, requiring that her character Vicki be written out.

<text>Hotline is the sixth studio album by American rock band The J. Geils Band. The album was released on September 9, 1975, by Atlantic Records.

The original record used novel packaging similar to a pop-up book, requiring owners to physically &quot;pick up&quot; the receiver from the printed telephone to remove the sleeve.

The intro of &quot;Believe in Me&quot; also became the intro tune to the German Rockpalast rock events.

<text>The Cathedral Church of Saint German or Peel Cathedral, renamed Cathedral Isle of Man, is located in Peel, Isle of Man. The cathedral is also one of the parish churches in the parish of the West Coast, which includes the town of Peel. Built in 1879–84, it was made the cathedral by Act of Tynwald in 1980.

It is the cathedral church of the Church of England Diocese of Sodor and Man.

==History==

The patron of the cathedral, St German of Man (not to be confused with Germanus of Auxerre), was a Celtic missionary and holy man who lived from about 410 to 474. St German&#x27;s Day is celebrated each year on 13 July.

The original cathedral of St German was inside the walls of Peel Castle and was built sometime in the 12th century when St Patrick&#x27;s Isle was in the possession of Norse kings. At that time the church followed the Sarum Rite, prevalent throughout much of the British Isles. Around 1333 the Lords of Man refortified St Patrick&#x27;s Isle and occupied the church as a fortress. In 1392 William Le Scroop repaired the cathedral.

The building fell into ruin in the 18th century. After a considerable period of debate over who owned the ruins and site, it was decided not to rebuild that cathedral. The present building was constructed in 1879–84 to replace St Peter&#x27;s Church in Peel&#x27;s market place. Although the building of the New Church was intended to become the diocesan cathedral, Bishop Rowley Hill’s Cathedral Bill didn’t make its final reading in Tynwald before he died. His successor abandoned the proposed Bill.
In 1895, Bishop Straton consecrated his chapel at Bishopscourt, his official residence, as a pro-cathedral and instituted a chapter of canons with himself as dean; by 1960, St Nicholas&#x27; Chapel was still a pro-cathedral (or &quot;Cathedral Chapel&quot;). Bishopscourt&#x27;s sale in 1979 left the diocese without a cathedral, and forced the issue of choosing a new cathedral; after public consultation, Kirk German Parish Church was so designated, and officially made the cathedral in a service on All Saints&#x27; Day (1 November 1980). The arrangement (bishop as dean) persisted even after the consecration of the new cathedral. The bishop was later described by John Betjeman as &quot;that luckless Bishop whose cathedral is a beautiful ruin of green slate and red sandstone on an islet overlooking Peel&quot;.

The cathedral has a dean and chapter. Until 15 October 2011, the Bishop of Sodor and Man was dean &quot;ex officio&quot;, but on that date the vicar of the parish became dean &quot;ex officio&quot;; this is thought to have been the historical arrangement from the 12th century until the late 19th century. The chapter consists of the Archdeacon of Man &quot;ex officio&quot; and four canons who are all parochial clergy in the diocese.

St German&#x27;s Cathedral is the mother church of the Diocese of Sodor and Man, which today consists of only the Isle of Man.

In July 2015, Anne, Princess Royal, attended a thanksgiving service at Peel Cathedral as patron of the development campaign; the service also marked the rebranding of Peel Cathedral as &quot;Cathedral Isle of Man&quot;. In 2016, following the mass shooting at Pulse, a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, the cathedral displayed a rainbow flag at a candlelit vigil for the victims to &quot;show solidarity with the LGBT community.&quot;

In October 2024, Anne, Princess Royal, attended a further thanksgiving service for the reordering of the Cathedral. The seating is now fully adaptable for multiple uses in the Cathedral, with the added comfort of underfloor heating.

==Music==

Bishop Hildesley established a children&#x27;s choir at his private chapel at Bishopscourt as early as 1755. At the opening of Peel New Church in 1884, Ms ML Wood ARCO was appointed the first organist and directed a large choir. The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, first established at Truro Cathedral in 1880, made its first appearance in Peel in 1885.

However, the modern Cathedral Choir was re-established in 2012 and includes a mixed boy and girl treble line (aged 7–14 years) drawn from island schools, in addition to a large adult voluntary choir (SATB). Choral services are sung on Sundays and consist of a Choral Eucharist and Choral Evensong.

There is a developing programme of choral scholarships for secondary school students.

The cathedral has a large two-manual Brindley &amp; Foster organ in the chancel. It is planned that the pipe organ will be rebuilt, re-ordered and significantly enlarged over the next five years, to meet the demands of the cathedral&#x27;s developing choral programme.

<text>Publishers Weekly (PW) is an American weekly trade news magazine targeted at publishers, librarians, booksellers, and literary agents. Published continuously since 1872, it has carried the tagline, &quot;The International News Magazine of Book Publishing and Bookselling.&quot; With 51 issues a year, the emphasis today is on book reviews.

==History==
===Nineteenth century===
The magazine was founded by bibliographer Frederick Leypoldt in the late 1860s, and had various titles until Leypoldt settled on the name The Publishers&#x27; Weekly (with an apostrophe) in 1872. The publication was a compilation of information about newly published books, collected from publishers and from other sources by Leypoldt, for an audience of booksellers. By 1876, &quot;The Publishers&#x27; Weekly&quot; was being read by nine tenths of the booksellers in the country.

In 1878, Leypoldt sold &quot;The Publishers&#x27; Weekly&quot; to his friend Richard Rogers Bowker, in order to free up time for his other bibliographic endeavors. Augusta Garrigue Leypoldt, wife of Frederick Leypoldt, stayed with the publication for thirty years. The publication eventually expanded to include features and articles.

Harry Thurston Peck was the first editor-in-chief of &quot;The Bookman&quot;, which began in 1895. Peck worked on its staff from 1895 to 1906, and in 1895, he created the world&#x27;s first bestseller list for its pages.

===Twentieth century===

In 1912, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; began to publish its own bestseller lists, patterned after the lists in &quot;The Bookman&quot;. These were not separated into fiction and non-fiction until 1917, when World War I brought an increased interest in non-fiction by the reading public.

For much of the twentieth century, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; was guided and developed by Frederic Gershom Melcher (1879–1963), who was editor and co-editor of &quot;Publishers&#x27; Weekly&quot; and chairman of the magazine&#x27;s publisher, R. R. Bowker, over four decades. Born April 12, 1879, in Malden, Massachusetts, Melcher began at age 16 in Boston&#x27;s Estes &amp; Lauriat Bookstore, where he developed an interest in children&#x27;s books. He moved to Indianapolis in 1913 for another bookstore job. In 1918, he read in &quot;Publishers&#x27; Weekly&quot; that the magazine&#x27;s editorship was vacant. He applied to Richard Rogers Bowker for the job, was hired, and moved with his family to Montclair, New Jersey. He remained with R. R. Bowker for 45 years.

While at &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, Melcher began creating space in the publication and a number of issues dedicated solely to books for children. In 1919, he teamed with Franklin K. Mathiews, librarian for the Boy Scouts of America, and Anne Carroll Moore, a librarian at the New York Public Library, to create Children&#x27;s Book Week.

When Bowker died in 1933, Melcher succeeded him as president of the company; he resigned in 1959 to become chairman of the board of directors.

In 1943, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; created the Carey–Thomas Award for creative publishing, naming it in honor of Mathew Carey and Isaiah Thomas.

For most of its history, &quot;Publishers Weekly,&quot; along with the &quot;Library Journal&quot;-related titles, were owned by founding publisher R. R. Bowker. When Reed Publishing purchased Bowker from Xerox in 1985, it placed &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; under the management of its Boston-based Cahners Publishing Company, the trade publishing empire founded by Norman Cahners, which Reed Publishing had purchased in 1977.

The merger of Reed with the Netherlands-based Elsevier in 1993 led to many Cahners cutbacks amid takeover turmoil. Nora Rawlinson, who once headed a $4 million book selection budget at the Baltimore County Library System, edited &quot;Library Journal&quot; for four years prior to becoming editor-in-chief of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; in 1992, where he served until 2005.

===Twenty-first century===
In 2005, the magazine came under the direction of a new editor-in-chief, veteran book reviewer Sara Nelson, known for publishing columns in the &quot;New York Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Observer&quot;.
Nelson began to modernize &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; with new features and a makeover by illustrator and graphic designer Jean-Claude Suares. The switch to a simple abbreviated logo of initials effectively changed the name of the magazine to &quot;PW&quot;, the name long used for the magazine within the book industry.

She also introduced the magazine&#x27;s short-lived Quill Awards, with nominees in 19 categories selected by a nominating board of 6,000 booksellers and librarians. Winners were determined by the reading public, who could vote at kiosks in Borders stores or online at the Quills site. Reed Business dropped the Quill Awards in 2008.

Since 1872, the front covers of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; were used to display advertisements by book publishers. &quot;PW&quot; editorial covers now feature illustrations and author photographs tied to interior articles, these covers follow the front cover advertisement. The visual motif of each cover is sometimes repeated on the contents page.

The Nelson years were marked by turbulence within the industry as well as a continuing trend away from serious writing and towards pop culture. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; has enjoyed a near monopoly over the past decades, but now with vigorous competition from Internet sites, e-mail newsletters, and daily newspapers.

In 2008, faced with a decline in advertising support, Reed&#x27;s management sought a new direction. In January 2009, Sara Nelson was dismissed along with executive editor Daisy Maryles, who had been with &quot;PW&quot; for more than four decades. Stepping in as editorial director was Brian Kenney, editorial director of &quot;School Library Journal&quot; and &quot;Library Journal&quot;. The dismissals, which sent shockwaves through the industry, were widely covered in newspapers.

In April 2010, George W. Slowik Jr., a former publisher of the magazine, purchased &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; from Reed Business Information, under the company PWxyz, LLC. Cevin Bryerman remained as publisher along with co-editors Jim Milliot and Michael Coffey.

On September 22, 2011, &quot;PW&quot; began a series of weekly podcasts: &quot;Beyond the Book: PW&#x27;s Week Ahead&quot;.

In 2019, &quot;The Millions&quot; was acquired by PWxyz.

&quot;PW&quot; maintains an online archive of past book reviews from January 1991 to the present. The earliest articles posted in &quot;PW&quot;″s online archive date back to November 1995. A redesigned website was unveiled on May 10, 2010.

==Features==
===Writers and readers===
In 2008, the magazine&#x27;s circulation was 25,000. In 2004, the breakdown of those 25,000 readers was given as 6000 publishers; 5500 public libraries and public library systems; 3800 booksellers; 1600 authors and writers; 1500 college and university libraries; 950 print, film and broad media; and 750 literary and rights agents, among others.

Subject areas covered by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; include publishing, bookselling, marketing, merchandising and trade news, along with author interviews and regular columns on rights, people in publishing, and bestsellers. It attempts to serve all involved in the creation, production, marketing and sale of the written word in book, audio, video and electronic formats. The magazine increases the page count considerably for four annual special issues: Spring Adult Announcements, Fall Adult Announcements, Spring Children&#x27;s Announcements, and Fall Children&#x27;s Announcements.

===Book reviews===
The book review section of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; was added in the early 1940s and grew in importance during the 20th century and through the present day. It currently offers prepublication reviews of 9,000 new trade books each year, in a comprehensive range of genres and including audiobooks and ebooks, with a digitized archive of 200,000 reviews. Reviews appear two to four months prior to the publication date of a book, and until 2014, when &quot;PW&quot; launched BookLife.com, a website for self-published books, books already in print were seldom reviewed.

These anonymous reviews are short, averaging 200–250 words, and it is not unusual for the review section to run as long as 40 pages, filling the second half of the magazine. In the past, a book review editorial staff of eight editors assigned books to more than 100 freelance reviewers. Some are published authors, and others are experts in specific genres or subjects. Although it might take a week or more to read and analyze some books, reviewers were paid $45 per review until June 2008, when the magazine introduced a reduction in payment to $25 a review. In a further policy change that month, reviewers received credit as contributors in issues carrying their reviews. Currently, there are nine reviews editors listed in the masthead.
Now titled &quot;Reviews&quot;, the review section began life as &quot;Forecasts&quot;. For several years, that title was taken literally; reviews were followed with italicized comments that attempted to predict a book&#x27;s sales success. Genevieve Stuttaford, who greatly expanded the number of reviews during her tenure as the nonfiction &quot;Forecasts&quot; editor, joined the &quot;PW&quot; staff in 1975. Previously, she was a &quot;Saturday Review&quot; associate editor, reviewer for &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; and for 12 years on the staff of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. During the 23 years Stuttaford was with &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, book reviewing was increased from an average of 3,800 titles a year in the 1970s to well over 6,500 titles in 1997. She retired in 1998.

Several notable &quot;PW&quot; editors stand out for making their mark on the magazine. Barbara Bannon was the head fiction reviewer during the 1970s and early 1980s, becoming the magazine&#x27;s executive editor during that time and retiring in 1983. She was, notably, the first reviewer to insist that her name be appended to any blurb of her reviews, thus drawing attention to herself, to the review and to the influence of the magazine in predicting a book&#x27;s popularity and salability.

Sybil Steinberg came to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; in the mid-1970s and served as a reviews editor for 30 years, taking over after Barbara Bannon retired. Under Steinberg, &quot;PW&quot; instituted the starred review, a first in the industry, to indicate books of exceptional merit. She also called out particular books of merit by starting the practice of boxed reviews, a precursor to the &quot;PW&quot; &quot;signature reviews,&quot; boxed reviews that are attributed to the reviewer. The &quot;Best Books&quot; lists were also Steinberg&#x27;s brainchild, and these lists are still published annually, usually in November ahead of &quot;Best Books&quot; lists from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other prominent review venues. Steinberg edited the magazine&#x27;s author interviews, and beginning in 1992 put together four anthologies of them in book form, published by the Pushcart Press.
Formerly of &quot;InStyle&quot; magazine, novelist Louisa Ermelino took the reins of the &quot;PW&quot; review section in 2005. Under her watch, the number of reviews grew once again, to nearly 9,000 per year from 6,500.

In a sea change for the magazine, Ermelino oversaw the integration of self-published book reviews into the main review section of the magazine. Review editors vet and assign self-published books for review, which reviews are then published alongside the reviews of traditionally published books each week in the magazine.
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; does charge for self-published book reviews following the trend within the industry led by &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; and &quot;Foreword&quot;″s Clarion fee-for-review service, both of which offer independent book reviews in exchange for fees in the hundreds of dollars. 
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; does syndicate its reviews to a variety of online retail venues such as Amazon, Apple Books, Powell&#x27;s Books, Books-a-Million, and others. The reviews are also carried by library database services such as Baker and Taylor, ProQuest, Bowker, Cengage, EBSCO, and others.

<doc id="1247750" wikidata="Q1090828" url="?curid=1247750" title="100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd">
<text>100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd is a television sitcom created for Nickelodeon by Steven H. Berman, Mitchel Katlin, and Nat Bernstein. The series ran for three seasons, premiering on October 16, 1999, and airing its final episode on April 21, 2002.

==Plot==

Eddie McDowd (Jason Dohring) is considered to be a schoolyard bully by his peers. McDowd considers himself very attractive and powerful and so he bullies others without mercy. One day, while bullying a kid after school, he is caught by a kind of mystical man. He tells McDowd that due to his bullying he will be punished for his wrongdoings by living life as a dog, and that in order to be restored as a human, he has to do 100 good deeds for others. Besides The Drifter, the only one who can hear him talk is Justin Taylor, the last kid he bullied. At first, the two are firmly against the idea, but McDowd realizes that he must work alongside Justin and his family to finish his good deeds. Every time Eddie performs a good deed, the Drifter appears with a creatively presented number stating the remaining deeds he has left. Occasionally, when Eddie misbehaves the Drifter takes away one of his deeds. The series was cancelled before the 100th deed, so it is unknown if he changed back.

==Episodes==

==Characters==

===Main===
*Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; McDowd (played by Jason Dohring as a human and John Allan at 12; played &quot;Rowdy&quot; as a dog; voiced by Seth Green in season 1, and Jason Hervey in seasons 2–3) – Eddie is a 17-year-old bully from the southwest who was turned into an Australian Shepherd/Siberian Husky mix by the Drifter for his wrongdoings and can only be restored to human form if he does 100 good deeds. Besides the Drifter, the only other person who can hear him talk is Justin Taylor (who was the last kid that he bullied). It is explained by the Drifter in a later episode that should this happen, neither Justin nor Eddie&#x27;s family will outright remember their experiences (though Eddie will still be a better person for it).
*Justin Taylor (played by Brandon Gilberstadt) – The last kid Eddie had picked on and the only one who can hear him talk in his dog form. He assists Eddie into doing the good deeds to restore Eddie to human.

<text>Paolo Boselli (8 June 1838 – 10 March 1932) was an Italian politician who served as the 34th prime minister of Italy during World War I.

==Biography==
Boselli was born in Savona, Liguria. Boselli was the first professor of science at the University of Rome prior to entering politics. He served for 51 years as a liberal rightist parliamentary deputy, and as a senator from 1921. Appointed Minister of Education in 1888, Boselli reorganised the Bank of Italy with his next portfolio, as Minister of the Treasury in 1899. He also served in Sidney Sonnino&#x27;s 1906 government.

In June 1916, he was a relatively undistinguished center-right politician and one of the oldest members of the Italian parliament, when he was appointed prime minister, following the collapse of the Salandra government as a result of military defeats. Boselli formed an ideologically broad coalition composed of one Catholic, one republican, two reformist socialists, two radicals, five left-wing liberals, and six conservative-liberals. 

His government fell in October 1917 as a result of the military defeat in the Battle of Caporetto, in which Italy lost some 800,000 men, all of the conquest made so far in World War I, as well as Friuli and parts of the Veneto. Boselli had been a strong supporter of commander-in-chief Luigi Cadorna, who was also fired in the aftermath of Caporetto.

During Boselli&#x27;s time as prime minister, a decree of August 1917 extended the principle of compulsory insurance against accidents to agricultural workers generally. He died in Rome on 10 March 1932, and was buried in Turin.

<doc id="1247760" wikidata="Q5466842" url="?curid=1247760" title="For Real">
<text>For Real is an American R&amp;B and soul quartet, that formed in 1990. In the latter part of that decade they were nominated for a Billboard Music Award and a Soul Train Music Award. The ladies have now reunited and are touring.

==Biography==
For Real secured their recording contract by accident. &quot;We were picking up our manager from the airport. So we decided to greet him with an acappella song. Someone from A&amp;M Records just happened to be in the airport and heard us perform. Not long after, we were signed,&quot; said Latanyia Baldwin.

The band released their debut album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Natural Thang&quot;, with production from Brian McKnight on A&amp;M Records in 1994, and it became a critical success, including a rare four stars from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. Their first single, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Wanna Miss&quot; hit #28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart; the group&#x27;s second single, &quot;Easy to Love&quot;, peaked at #65 on the same chart. The third single, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Nothin&#x27;&quot;, peaked at #88 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song also peaked at #54 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1995. The album sold over one million copies worldwide, and peaked at #80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 1995, the band appeared in Italian &quot;Vogue&quot;, modeling men&#x27;s suits. They toured alongside Stevie Wonder, and lent their voices to the Martin Scorsese film project &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot;. The foursome also forayed into acting with appearances in the film &quot;Shake, Rattle and Rock!&quot; starring Renée Zellweger and Howie Mandel on Showtime.

They also hit the US Top 20 with the single &quot;Freedom (Theme from &quot;Panther&quot;)&quot; featuring Aaliyah, TLC, En Vogue, BlackGirl, SWV, and Vanessa Williams from the film &quot;Panther&quot;. They also recorded a duet with Stevie Wonder called &quot;Stubborn Kind of Fellow&quot;, which appeared on the Marvin Gaye tribute album, &quot;Inner City Blues: The Music of Marvin Gaye&quot;. For Real also recorded songs for the soundtracks of the films &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; and &quot;Fled&quot;.

After a label change from A&amp;M to Dallas Austin&#x27;s Arista imprint Rowdy Records in 1996, For Real released their second album &quot;Free&quot;. The first two singles were &quot;Like I Do&quot; and &quot;The Saddest Song I Ever Heard&quot;.
The band also recorded three songs (&quot;I Do&quot;, &quot;Born to Love That Boy&quot; and &quot;Unwanted Number&quot;) and appeared in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot;. The film&#x27;s soundtrack won a Satellite Award in 1997.

In January 1997, the band won an American Music Award for their work on the &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; soundtrack, with their featured song,&quot;Love Will Be Waiting at Home&quot;. In Summer 1997, the group earned a Soul Train Award nomination for Album of the Year (By a Group, Band or Duo) for &quot;Free&quot;.

In 1999, Wendi Williams lent her voice to the Emmy-winning film &quot;Introducing Dorothy Dandridge&quot; with Halle Berry, in which Berry plays a singer but Williams is behind her singing voice.

In 2007, Josina Elder-Epps began work on a solo album and released two songs &quot;Watcha Gonna Do&quot; and &quot;Doing It On My Own&quot; to her MySpace page. She began work with producer CoryLavel on an album in 2009.

In 2010, Necia Bray-Gates released her debut solo album &quot;Love Letters&quot; on an independent label.

On July 25, 2018, all four members reunited for a special “Unplugged” show in Los Angeles.

<text>Bethany College is a private Christian college in Lindsborg, Kansas. It was founded in 1881, making it one of the oldest colleges in Kansas.

==History==
Bethany College, established by Swedish Lutheran immigrants in 1881, is a college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Swedish-Lutheran settlers worked with the Rev. Carl Aaron Swensson, pastor of Bethany Lutheran Church, to establish Bethany Academy on October 15, 1881, in the sacristy of the church in Lindsborg, Kansas, with ten students. The first building erected contained classrooms and a dormitory for men. A separate dormitory for women was built next. J. A. Udden was the first teacher. In 1882, the Smoky Valley district of the Kansas conference of the Augustana Synod took responsibility for the college; a board of directors was appointed and a state charter was received.

In 1883, a large dormitory for men was constructed, and in 1885, a main hall with classrooms, a chapel museum, and library and science departments opened. The Kansas conference itself took responsibility for the school in the spring of 1885 and the name was changed to Bethany College and Normal Institute. By 1889, its present name, Bethany College, had been assumed and it had been granted permission to award academic degrees.

Notable Bethany presidents in the 20th century include Rev. Ernst Frederick Wilhelm Pihlblad (1873–1943), who was a professor from 1895 to 1904 and president from 1905 to 1941. Under Pihlblad, Bethany was accredited and became a member of the National Association of Schools of Music. Under the watch of Emory K. Lindquist (1908–1992), who took office of president in 1943, Bethany survived war troubles, grew in post-war America, and improved its reputation. He was the author of &quot;Bethany in Kansas: The History of a College&quot; (1975).

The Bethany College Board of Directors announced the appointment of Elizabeth Mauch as Bethany College President in 2020.

==Academics==
Bethany College has 14 academic departments. The school offers majors focused in education, humanities, fine arts, sciences, and social sciences; minors ranging from business and sacred music to theater and art; teaching endorsements for all majors in education; and six pre-professional studies including medicine, law and, physical therapy.

==Athletics==
The Bethany athletic teams are called the Swedes (or Terrible Swedes). The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC) since the 1902–03 academic year.

Bethany competes in 22 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading, dance and eSports.

==Traditions==
* Since 1903, students and alumni have rallied Bethany athletic competition with the &quot;Rockar! Stockar!&quot; cheer.
* Every year since 1882, Bethany Oratorio Society has presented Handel&#x27;s Messiah at the college, one of the longest-running annual performances in North America.
* The walk from Bethany Lutheran Church. In honor of its founding in the sacristy of Bethany Lutheran Church, students traditionally walk to the church for a welcome service on their first day at Bethany as freshmen. Then, before the baccalaureate services on the day of their commencement, Bethany seniors line up in front of Bethany Lutheran Church for a traditional procession to Presser Hall on campus.
* The ringing of the bell. When a Swedes athletics team wins conference, they gather in front of Hahn Gymnasium to ring the bell and spread the news to the rest of the campus, regardless of what time of day—or night—it may be.
* Lift High the Cross. Each year during Homecoming week, Bethany students celebrate the college’s heritage of faith by lifting high a wooden cross in the gazebo. Students sign up for shifts so that the cross is held high during every hour of the week.
* The number of feet out that the fence is for a home run in Anderson Stadium is 352, and it is also the place all Swedes baseball fans gather to cheer.

<text>Jon St. John is an American voice actor. He is best known for his voice roles such as Duke Nukem in the &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; video game series and Big the Cat and E-123 Omega in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; video game franchise.

==Career==
He started his career in voice work in 1975, when he was a radio DJ in North Carolina.

He has provided the voice for numerous video game characters, such as the voice for the drill instructor Dwight T. Barnes as well as various other Marines in &quot;Half-Life: Opposing Force&quot;. He has done the voices for Big the Cat in &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; and &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, Trash Man, General Warthog and other characters in &quot;Twisted Metal 4&quot;, E-102 Gamma in &quot;Sonic Battle&quot;, the announcer in &quot;Sonic Advance 3&quot;, E-123 Omega in &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, Bolt Logan in &quot;Chrome&quot; and &quot;&quot; and Agent Michael Ford in &quot;Conduit 2&quot;. He also voiced the &quot;Postal Dude“ in &quot;Postal 4: No Regerts&quot;.

St. John is best known for being the voice of Duke Nukem in the &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; video game series from 1996 onwards, starting with &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;. During the audition, voice director Lani Minella, told him &quot;I want you to think of Dirty Harry when he goes &#x27;Do you feel lucky, do you punk?” After he performed the line verbatim, Broussard suggested St. John approach the voice as &quot;a much bigger guy, much bigger than, say, Clint Eastwood.” St. Jon lowered the pitch of his voice, and Broussard was impressed, hiring him to voice the character.

He dubs the voice of professor Simon and Archibald in &quot;Runaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle&quot;. He provided the narrator&#x27;s voice in &quot;Forsaken&quot;. He voiced Jack Boyd in the video games &quot;This Is The Police&quot; and its sequel.

<doc id="1247770" wikidata="Q354715" url="?curid=1247770" title="Antonio Salandra">
<text>Antonio Salandra (13 August 1853 – 9 December 1931) was a conservative Italian politician, journalist, and writer who served as the 21st prime minister of Italy between 1914 and 1916. He ensured the entry of Italy in World War I on the side of the Triple Entente (the United Kingdom, France, and the Russian Empire) to fulfil Italy&#x27;s irredentist claims.

==Early life and political career==
Born in Troia (Province of Foggia, Apulia), he graduated from the University of Naples in 1875 and then became instructor and later professor of administrative law at the University of Rome.

He was Minister of Agriculture (1899–1900) in the conservative government of Luigi Pelloux and subsequently Minister of the Treasury (1906) and Italian Minister of Finance (1909–1910) in the governments of Sidney Sonnino.

==Prime minister==
In March 1914, the conservative Salandra was brought into the national cabinet upon the fall of the government of Giovanni Giolitti, as the choice of Giolitti himself, who still commanded the support of most Italian parliamentarians. Salandra&#x27;s government was the most conservative one that Italy had seen for a long time. Salandra soon fell out with Giolitti over the question of Italian participation in World War I.

At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Salandra declared that Italy would not commit its troops, maintaining that the Triple Alliance had only a defensive stance and Austria-Hungary had been the aggressor. In reality, both Salandra and his ministers of Foreign Affairs, Antonino Paternò Castello, who was succeeded by Sidney Sonnino in November 1914, began to probe which side would grant the best reward for Italy&#x27;s entrance in the war and to fulfil Italy’s irredentist claims.

==Entering World War I==

Salandra used the term &quot;sacred egoism&quot; (&quot;sacro egoismo&quot;) to define Italy&#x27;s outlook on which side Italy would enter the war. Expecting the war would be short – over by the late summer of 1915 – there was some pressure on the decision to make.

Negotiations had been started between Sonnino, the British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey and the French Foreign Minister Jules Cambon.

The secret pact, the Treaty of London or London Pact (), was signed between the Triple Entente (the United Kingdom, France, and the Russian Empire) and the Kingdom of Italy. According to the pact, Italy was to leave the Triple Alliance and join the Triple Entente. Italy was to declare war against Germany and Austria-Hungary within a month in return for territorial concessions at the end of the war.

While Giolitti supported neutrality, Salandra and Sonnino, supported intervention on the side of the Entente, and secured Italy&#x27;s entrance into the war despite the opposition of the majority in parliament. On 3 May 1915, Italy officially revoked the Triple Alliance. In the following days Giolitti and the neutralist majority of the Parliament opposed declaring war, while nationalist crowds demonstrated in public areas for entering the war. On 13 May 1915, Salandra offered his resignation, but Giolitti, fearful of nationalist disorder that might break into open rebellion, declined to succeed him as prime minister and Salandra&#x27;s resignation was not accepted.
On 23 May 1915, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. Salandra had expected that Italy&#x27;s entrance on the allied side would bring the war to a quick solution. However the stalemated bloody war lasted far longer than anticipated. This weakened Salandra&#x27;s ministry, especially when he refused to appoint neutralists to important positions. Five unsuccessful Italian offensives on the Isonzo and the Austro-Hungarian Trentino Offensive in May to July 1916 contributed to a military crisis that led to the collapse of Salandra&#x27;s government on 10 June 1916, due to a combination of neutralist deputies and those who believed that Salandra had not been effective enough in the war effort. He played no further role in the war but was a member of the Italian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.

After World War I, Salandra moved further to the right, and supported Mussolini&#x27;s accession to power in 1922. Nine years later he died in Rome.

He was awarded the Serbian Order of Karađorđe&#x27;s Star.

==Works==

He is the author of a considerable number of works on economics, finance, history, law, and politics (New International Encyclopedia). These include:

* &quot;Tratto della giustizia amministrativo&quot; (1904)
* &quot;La politica nazionale e il partito liberale&quot; (1912)
* &quot;Lezioni di diritto amministrativo&quot; (two volumes, 1912)
* &quot;Politica e legislazione : saggi, raccolti da Giustino Fortunato&quot; (1915)
* &quot;Il discorso contro la malafede tedesca&quot; (1915)
* &quot;Italy and the Great War: From Neutrality to Intervention&quot; (London: Edward Arnold, 1932),

<text>Phutthaloetla Naphalai (born Chim; 24 February 1767 or 1768 – 21 July 1824), also known by his regnal name Rama II, was the second King of Siam from the Chakri dynasty, ruling from 1809 to 1824. In 1809, Itsarasunthon succeeded his father Rama I, the founder of the Chakri dynasty, as Loetlanaphalai the King of Siam. His reign was largely peaceful, devoid of major conflicts. His reign was known as the &quot;Golden Age of Rattanakosin Literature&quot; as Loetlanaphalai was patron to a number of poets in his court, and the King himself was a renowned poet and artist. The most notable poet in his employ was the illustrious Sunthorn Phu, the author of &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot;. The rapid growth of the number of his descendants was outstanding: he is believed to have had over 240 grandchildren.

==Early life==

Chim was born in 1767 during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in Amphawa District, Samut Songkram. He was a son of Luang Yokkrabat of Ratchaburi and Nak of Samut Sakorn, as his father and mother were then known. They would later become King Rama I and Queen Amarindra, respectively.

In 1767, Ayutthaya fell to Konbaung Burmese invaders. His father, Phraya Ratchaburi, joined Taksin&#x27;s forces to recapture the city. Under King Taksin, Chim&#x27;s father rose rapidly to high rank as a military leader and was assigned with the campaigns to subjugate Laos and Cambodia. In 1782, his father crowned himself King of Siam (later named Rama I) and Chim himself was raised to the title of Prince Itsarasunthon of Siam.

Itsarasunthon with his concubine Riam (later elevated to Princess Mother Sri Sulalai by her own son), fathered Prince Tub ( – later Rama III) in 1787. Prince Itsarasunthon then had a secret affair with his own cousin, Princess Bunrot. In 1801, Rama I then found out that Princess Bunrod had been pregnant for four months and banished her out of the palace to live with her brother. Itsarasunthon, however begged his father to forgive him and the princess was reinstated and became his consort through the negotiation by concubine Khamwaen. Unfortunately, the baby died just after its birth. With Princess Bunrot, Itsarasunthon also fathered Mongkut (1804) and Pinklao (1808). His another concubine namely Prang Yai, gave birth to Prince Nuam in 1808.

He also married his agnatic half sister, Princess Kunthon Thipphayawadi. They had three sons: Prince Abhorn (1816), Prince Klang (1819), and Prince Piu (1822). Later, Prince Klang would be known as Prince Mahamala. He was granted the title of &quot;Krom Khun&quot; Bumraap Porapuksa, the 4th level of Krom ranks by Mongkut then elevated to &quot;Krom Phraya&quot; by Chulalongkorn.

Prince Itsarasunthon was appointed to the Front Palace as Lord of the Front Palace or Uparaja in 1807 to succeed his uncle Maha Sura Singhanat who had died in 1803, though he continued to stay at the Thonburi Palace. Among his many other children was Prince Wongsa Dhiraj Snid (born Prince Nuam), who was a royal physician for many years as well as a field commander and diplomat.

==Ascension==
As the eldest surviving legitimate son of Rama I, Prince Itsarasunthon succeeded to the throne when Buddha Yotfa Chulaloke died in 1809. No royal naming system was established at the time Rama II was crowned. He was later named by his son Nangklao as Loetlasulalai but changed to Loetlanaphalai by his other son Mongkut and by the Rama convention, called Rama II. His consort, Princess Bunrod, was raised to Queen Sri Suriyendra.

As soon as Loetlanaphalai ascended the throne, Prince Kshatranichit, the surviving son of Taksin, rebelled as pretender to the throne. Loetlanaphalai&#x27;s son, Prince Thap, effectively crushed the rebellion, proving himself to be competent, thus gaining his father&#x27;s favor. Prince Tub was raised to Kromma Muen, given the Sanskrit-derived name &quot;Chetsadabodin&quot;, and made Minister of Foreign Affairs.

===Countering the last major Burmese invasions===

The Konbaung king Bodawpaya, seeing that Rama I was dead, marched an army into Chumphon and conquered Thalang (Phuket City) in the same year. Loetlanaphalai sent his brother Maha Senanurak the Front Palace to recapture Thalang, which had been razed to the ground. This &quot;Thalang campaign&quot; was the last invasion by the Burmese into Thai territory.

In 1820, fearing an imminent attack by the Burmese on Siam, Rama II ordered his staff to collect all information in regards to potential Burmese invading routes into Siam.

==Culture and literature==

It was said that during Rama II&#x27;s reign, if one could write a refined piece of poetry, then one would be able to become a royal favorite, as Loetlanaphalai himself was a poet. The reign was a cultural renaissance after the massive wars that plagued the First Reign; particularly in the fields of arts and literature. Poets employed by Rama II included Sunthorn Phu the drunken writer (&quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot;) and Narin Dhibet (&quot;Nirat Narin&quot;). His sons, Jessadabodindra and Paramanuchitchinorot, were encouraged to excel in poetry. Poramanuchit later became a &quot;Sangharaj&quot; (Buddhist hierophant) and was well known for his religious works.

Rama II&#x27;s reign saw the reconstruction of Thai culture and royal traditions. In 1811, the grand royal funeral was held for King Rama I. In the same year, a cholera epidemic broke out in Bangkok. Loetlanaphalai ordered &quot;Apat Pinat&quot; or sickness-repelling ceremonies to be performed. He also established the education and the examination system of Buddhism by dividing it into nine levels. In 1817, the Vesak festival was restored.

==Foreign relations==
In 1810, the first Rattanakosin-to-China mission was sent to the Jiaqing Emperor.

Since the Siamese revolution of 1688, Western presence had been reduced to a small scale as the Thai Kings ceased to encourage foreign influence. This, coupled with the Napoleonic Wars, meant there was little contact between Thailand and foreigners.

However, the wars caused many subsequent changes, which were observed in Southeast Asia. The British interest in Malaya increased as their trade with China increased. The Sultan of Kedah, a Siamese vassal, gave Penang off to the British without consulting Siam in 1786, followed by the British acquisition of Seberang Perai. Soon the British replaced the Dutch as the dominating naval power south of Siam.

The mission of the Portuguese governor of Macau in 1818 was the first formal Western contact in Siam since the Ayutthaya times. The British founded Singapore in 1819 and Jaslis, a missionary from Yangon, introduced the printing press in the same year. The Portuguese established the first western consulate in 1820. The first renewed formal British visit was made by John Crawfurd in 1822.

==Death and succession==
In July 1824, he died &quot;very suddenly&quot;. It was said to be caused by strangury, but rumours were not without strong suspicions of his being poisoned. According to the succession rule then theoretically in force, the throne would go to the son of Queen Sri Suriyendra, Prince Mongkut; however, his elder half-brother Chetsadabodin succeeded the same day. Though only the son of a concubine, he had served their father in putting down a revolt and then as &quot;Kromma Tha&quot; (Ministry of Trade and Foreign Relations.) The elder brother&#x27;s experience counted for more than the theoretical claim of the much younger and inexperienced brother, who nevertheless did succeed his elder brother much later, and sired many sons but raised none of their mothers to the rank of queen, thus technically none of his sons had claim to the throne over their half-uncle whose mother was a Rama II&#x27;s principal consort.

<doc id="1247778" wikidata="Q35985" url="?curid=1247778" title="WWE Classics on Demand">
<text>WWE Classics On Demand was an American subscription video on demand television service provided by WWE. It featured footage from WWE&#x27;s vast archive of wrestling footage, including classic WWE, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and more. It offered around 40 hours of rotating programming per month, arranged into four (previously six) &quot;programming buckets&quot;, often centered on a specific theme. It was originally called WWE 24/7 On Demand. In September 2008, it was changed to WWE 24/7 Classics on Demand. In April 2009, it was changed again to WWE Classics On Demand.

WWE Classics was presented only on digital cable. Among the services carrying it were Comcast, AT&amp;T U-Verse (discontinued in 2012), Verizon FiOS, Mediacom, Charter Communications, Cox Communications, Rogers Cable, EastLink, Seaside Communications, Cogeco, Armstrong, Cablevision, Sky Italia and not long ago, Astro. Some of its programming was packaged as &quot;Madison Square Garden Classics&quot; and began airing on MSG Network in the summer of 2006. In November 2007, the service had around 115,000 subscribers.

The service closed on January 31, 2014 to make way for their new video-streaming and subscription service WWE Network.

==Programming buckets and programs ==
The programming buckets and the programs which usually or occasionally appear on them:
* WWE Legends–focuses on &quot;narrative, retrospective and thematic programs&quot; dealing with &quot;legendary&quot; wrestlers.
** &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;–&quot;Mean Gene&quot; Okerlund hosts an original profile of a specific WWE Hall of Famer.
*** Throughout the rest of the month a selection of matches featuring that star are featured, changing every two weeks.
** &quot;WWE Old School&quot; - Archival house shows from the 1970s to the 1990s. These shows mostly took place in New York, Boston, Toronto, and Philadelphia.
** &quot;Legends of Wrestling&quot;–A round table discussion. An occasional program.
** &quot;The Film Room with Gordon Solie&quot;–Jim Ross introduces classic footage documenting the career of a specific wrestler or tracing a specific event/feud as called by and featuring interviews with Gordon Solie. An occasional program.
** This section also contains DVD and video releases.
* The Big Events
** Vintage pay-per-views and &quot;super show&quot; events from WWF/WWE, WCW, NWA, and AWA. These events could be a few months to years old.
** &quot;WWE U-Choose&quot; (formerly &quot;Pick Your Big One&quot;) - Every month three &quot;Big One&quot; events, based on the next months theme, are offered up to be voted on at WWE&#x27;s Classics subsite, with the winning event offered for viewing amongst the next months &quot;Big Ones&quot; selections.
** Usually, a WWE pay-per-view that aired about a few months prior will be shown. This is shown in its entirety, but had also been broken down match by match as an additional option.
* TV Classics–The history of professional wrestling is shown through re-airings of wrestling television shows.
** Extreme Championship Wrestling - Hosted by Joey Styles, Tazz was the original host of the show until he left WWE in April 2009. Tommy Dreamer took over for Tazz as co-host until he left WWE in January 2010.
** WWF Championship Wrestling - Without a Host
** AWA All-Star Wrestling - without a host
** AWA Championship Wrestling - Hosted by Larry Nelson
** Championship Wrestling from Florida - Hosted by Mike Graham (discontinued in 2008)
** Smoky Mountain Wrestling - without a host
** World Class Championship Wrestling - Hosted by Michael &quot;P. S.&quot; Hayes and Kevin Von Erich, Jimmy Garvin fills in for Von Erich from time to time.
** World Championship Wrestling - without a host
** Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling - without a host
** &quot;WWF Prime Time Wrestling&quot; - without a host
*** Originally alternated with &quot;Tuesday Night Titans&quot; in the programming schedule until the final &quot;TNT&quot; aired in February 2009.
** &quot;The Monday Night War&quot; - Hosted by Jim Ross, formerly hosted by Michael Cole, chronological re-airings of the week to week competition between &quot;WWF Monday Night Raw&quot; and &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;. Airs as two separate programs. It originally aired as one program until January 2008.
** &quot;Monday Night War: The Beginning&quot; - Hosted by Michael Cole, alternating with the &quot;original&quot; &quot;Monday Night War&quot; programs, &quot;The Beginning&quot; focuses on the start of the &quot;war&quot; in 1995. It airs as one program like the &quot;original&quot; show did. When this show debuted, Michael Cole was seen sitting behind the RAW announce position inside an empty arena explaining the programming change. This lasted a few episodes until the show began airing without the interlude.
** Additional programming, sometimes but not always, related to the months theme, is also put into this section.
* Shorties
** Matches and/or memorable moments centered on the month&#x27;s theme are hosted by a particular superstar (&quot;e.g.&quot; moments or matches involving food for Thanksgiving).

== Previous buckets ==

When the service debuted it did so with six, more specialized, buckets. Around April 4, 2007 they were combined and pruned into a more broad set of four. This was done, according to the free &quot;Month Preview&quot; show hosted by Jack Korpela to make things easier for Classics viewers.

The original six buckets and their programming were:
* Hall of Fame - Featuring only the Okerlund hosted biography and matches of a particular Hall of Famer.
* Big Ones - Past pay-per-views
* Specials - Home video releases and network specials
* ECW - The &quot;History of ECW&quot; show (then hosted by Tazz alone)
* Prime Time - Any past wrestling programming that would have originally aired in or around &quot;prime time&quot;, including &quot;Monday Night Wars&quot;, which aired as one program.
* Old School - Recorded house shows

Over time the &quot;ECW&quot; bucket was expanded to &quot;Territories - ECW&quot; and began to incorporate shows from the &quot;territorial days&quot; of the business. Later still the name was changed to its current &quot;TV Classics&quot; when it started housing the programming found in the &quot;Prime Time&quot; bucket, which was removed altogether. The &quot;Old School&quot; and &quot;Big Ones&quot; buckets were combined, keeping the &quot;Big Ones&quot; name, and becoming a bucket for any and all larger shows. &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; was renamed to the less restrictive &quot;WWE Legends&quot; and began to house material from the &quot;Specials&quot; bucket, which was also removed.

== Legends of Wrestling ==
&quot;Legends of Wrestling&quot; is an original series made specifically for the Classics service. The program features various &quot;legends&quot; of the business, for their work in and out of the ring, having a roundtable discussion about specific topics, persons, or occurrences in the history of wrestling. The show was originally hosted by WWE commentator Jim Ross–with former interviewer Gene Okerlund filling in for him on a few occasions–until Okerlund took over hosting duties completely with the shows fourth panel.

The series was divided into unofficial &quot;seasons&quot; of hour-long episodes (each with a short intermission) featuring the same panels.

In January 2009, a DVD box set of three episodes: Sgt. Slaughter/Ric Flair, Jerry Lawler/the Junkyard Dog, and &quot;Heatseekers&quot;—about wrestlers who have a reputation of &quot;causing trouble&quot; backstage—along with bonus matches involving the stars. Best Buy exclusives episodes Bob Backlund/Hulk Hogan, The Iron Sheik/André the Giant, and &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper/Terry Funk were also released. The episodes come from the first season, with the exception of &quot;Heatseekers&quot;, which is a second-season episode.

== Extra material ==
* Before some selections begin there are short &quot;promos&quot; and clips shown featuring either memorable moments in the history of wrestling or a selection of highlights of a particular superstar before that star announces &quot;You&#x27;re watching WWE 24/7&quot;.
* Early in the service&#x27;s existence, it included an on-screen crawl during some content detailing historical moments—title changes, important matches, birthdays—in the history of wrestling for the month. The crawl was later changed to only featuring title changes.
* Other times a lower third will appear on screen to provide supplemental information to what&#x27;s going on on screen. Often it is tied into the month&#x27;s theme.
* On Monday Night Wars, an occasional segment called &quot;War Stories&quot; follows a key moment in the Monday Night War, where stars involved in the moment discuss the immediate reactions to the segment, but can also give insights into why a particular segment happened.

== WWE Video Library ==

The WWE Video Library is the largest professional wrestling tape library anywhere in the world, with well over 100,000 hours of content. It not only consists of World Wrestling Entertainment footage (dating back to 1970), but WWE has aggressively purchased regional and national competitors, through time amassing a gargantuan library of television programs, pay-per-view recordings, video productions, and recordings of wrestling matches dating back to the 1950s and representing a very significant portion of the visual history of modern professional wrestling and sports entertainment.

== Editing ==
Since World Wrestling Entertainment is no longer allowed to use the &quot;WWF&quot; initialism or their 1998–2002 logo except for &quot;specified circumstances&quot;, instances of both were edited and/or removed from pertinent programming. In late July 2012, WWE reached a settlement with the World Wide Fund for Nature which once again allows them to use the &quot;WWF&quot; initials and scratch logo on archive footage. Unedited footage first appeared on the 1000th episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; and since then has appeared in full length matches shown on the WWE website and on Classics on Demand. In addition, previously licensed music to which the rights have expired are removed or replaced with alternate songs. Additionally, some formerly live events are censored for language and/or nudity. Ring announcer Michael Buffer is also edited out of any programming due to his trademarked phrase, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready to Rumble&quot;.

In the wake of the Chris Benoit double murder-suicide a number of wrestling websites reported that the likeness of and references to both Chris and Nancy Benoit were being removed from pertinent programming. Eventually Nancy&#x27;s image was allowed to return to programming, though over six years later Benoit&#x27;s continued to be excised. Most notably both his wrestling and mention of his name was removed from episodes of &quot;Monday Night Wars&quot; airings of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, as well as match segments from other shows, though he is occasionally mentioned and shown in brief non-wrestling roles. His image eventually returned in a wrestling role during a rebroadcast of World War 3 from 1997. In early January 2014, WWE issued a memo stating that footage involving Chris Benoit would air on the WWE Network with the following advisory: &quot;The following program is presented in its original form. It may contain some content that does not reflect WWE&#x27;s corporate views and may not be suitable for all viewers. WWE characters are fictitious and do not reflect the personal lives of the actors portraying them. Viewer discretion is advised.&quot;

<text>Blow Your Face Out is the second live album by American rock band the J. Geils Band, released in 1976.

== Recording ==
The album was recorded at two concerts held in November 1975. The first show was at the Boston Garden in the band&#x27;s hometown (Boston, Massachusetts) on November 15, and recorded by Record Plant East Remote with David Hewitt.
The second was recorded by Metro Audio Detroit four nights later at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan, the same city where the band&#x27;s other two live albums &quot;&quot;Live&quot; Full House&quot; (1972) and &quot;Showtime!&quot; (1982) were also recorded.

==Track listing==

All songs written by Seth Justman and Peter Wolf, except where noted.

# &quot;Southside Shuffle&quot; – 4:16
# &quot;Back to Get Ya&quot; – 4:38
# &quot;Shoot Your Shot&quot; (Junior Walker, James Graves, Lawrence Horn) – 3:56
# &quot;Musta Got Lost&quot; – 6:34

Side Two
# &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; (Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, Eddie Holland Jr.) – 4:00
# &quot;Truck Drivin&#x27; Man&quot; (Terry Fell) – 1:52
# &quot;Love-Itis&quot; (Harvey Scales, Albert Vance) – 4:05
# &quot;Lookin&#x27; for a Love&quot; (J. W. Alexander, Zelda Samuels) – 2:06

# &quot;Start All Over&quot; – 2:21
# &quot;Give It to Me&quot; – 6:52

&quot;The track listing on the original release has several incorrect song titles. &quot;Must of Got Lost&quot; is listed as &quot;Musta Got Lost&quot;, &quot;Lookin&#x27; for a Love&quot; as &quot;Intro:&quot;, &quot;Start All Over Again&quot; as &quot;Start All Over&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; but a Houseparty&quot; as &quot;Houseparty&quot;. &quot;Musta Got Lost&quot; is possibly a simple error, but the other two are seemingly stylistic choices, as the label on the record notes the real titles of the songs in parentheses.&quot;

==Personnel==
*Peter Wolf – vocals
*J. Geils – guitar
*Magic Dick – harmonica
*Seth Justman – keyboards, vocals
*Danny Klein – bass

<text>Adolf Fredrik Church () is a church in central Stockholm, Sweden, named after Adolf Frederick. It was built in 1768–1774, replacing a wooden chapel from 1674, which was dedicated to Saint Olof. It was inaugurated on 27 November 1774.

Its cemetery is where René Descartes was first buried in 1650, before his remains were moved to France. Inside the church a memorial to the memory of Descartes was installed by Gustav III. Other famous people buried in the church cemetery include Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, who was assassinated only a block from the church, Prime Minister Hjalmar Branting, physicist Carl Benedicks, and the composer Anders Eliasson.

The church is currently headed by pastor Ted Harris.

<doc id="1247786" wikidata="Q6005196" url="?curid=1247786" title="Modern immigration to the United Kingdom">
<text>Since 1945, immigration to the United Kingdom, controlled by British immigration law and to an extent by British nationality law, has been significant, in particular from the former territories of the British Empire and the European Union. 

Since the accession of the UK to the European Communities in the 1970s and the creation of the EU in the early 1990s, immigrants relocated from member states of the European Union, exercising one of the European Union&#x27;s Four Freedoms. Immigration to and from Central and Eastern Europe has increased since 2004 with the accession to the European Union of eight Central and Eastern European states, since there is free movement of labour within the EU. In 2021, since Brexit came into effect, previous EU citizenship&#x27;s right to newly move to and reside in the UK on a permanent basis does not apply anymore.

A smaller number have come as asylum seekers (not included in the definition of immigration) seeking protection as refugees under the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention, though many of these people also come from former territories of the British Empire.

About 70% of the population increase between the 2001 and 2011 censuses was due to foreign-born immigration. As of 2013, 7.5 million people (11.9% of the population at the time) were born overseas, although the census gives no indication of their immigration status or intended length of stay.

The UK currently uses a points-based immigration system. The UK Government can also grant settlement to foreign nationals, which confers on them indefinite leave to remain in the UK, without granting them British citizenship. Grants of settlement are made on the basis of various factors, including employment, family formation and reunification, and asylum (including to deal with backlogs of asylum cases).

Net migration into the UK during 2022 is reported to have reached a record high of 764,000, with immigration at 1.26 million and emigration at 493,000. Net migration was 685,000 in 2023. Of the 1,218,000 migrants in 2023, only 10% were citizens of EU member states. Around 250,000 people came from India, 141,000 from Nigeria, 90,000 from China and 83,000 from Pakistan. Around 50,000 people, including those from Ukraine and Hong Kong, came for humanitarian reasons in 2023, down from 162,000 in 2022.

==Definitions==
According to an August 2018 publication of the House of Commons Library, several definitions for a migrant exist in United Kingdom. A migrant can be:
* Someone whose country of birth is different to their country of residence.
* Someone whose nationality is different to their country of residence.
* Someone who changes their country of usual residence for a period of at least a year, so that the country of destination effectively becomes the country of usual residence.

== Policy ==
The Immigration Act 1971, section 1, provides for &quot;rules laid down by the Secretary of State as to the practice to be followed in the administration of this Act&quot;. By August 2018, the Immigration Rules stood at almost 375,000 words, often so precise and detailed that the services of a lawyer are typically required to navigate them. Individuals wanting to apply for British citizenship have to demonstrate their commitment by learning English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic and by having an understanding of British history, culture and traditions. Any individual seeking to apply for naturalisation or indefinite leave to remain must pass the official Life in the UK test.

Visas for immigration are managed by UK Visas and Immigration, a department within the Home Office. Applications are made at UK embassies or consulates or directly to UK Visas and Immigration, depending upon the type of visa or permit required.

The UK uses a points-based immigration system. Tier 1 in the new system – which replaced the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme – gives points for age, education, earning, previous UK experience but not for work experience. The points-based system was phased in over the course of 2008, replacing previous managed migration schemes such as the work permit system and the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme.

A points-based system is composed of five tiers was first described by the UK Border Agency as follows:
*Tier 1 – for highly skilled individuals, who can contribute to growth and productivity;
*Tier 2 – for skilled workers with a job offer, to fill gaps in the United Kingdom workforce;
*Tier 3 – for limited numbers of low-skilled workers needed to fill temporary labour shortages;
*Tier 4 – for students;
*Tier 5 – for temporary workers and young people covered by the Youth Mobility Scheme, who are allowed to work in the United Kingdom for a limited time to satisfy primarily non-economic objectives.

Though immigration is a matter that is reserved to the UK Government under the legislation that established devolution for Scotland in 1999, the Scottish Government was able to get an agreement from the Home Office for their Fresh Talent Initiative which was designed to encourage foreign graduates of Scottish universities to stay in Scotland to look for employment. The Fresh Talent Initiative ended in 2008, following the introduction of points-based system.

== History ==

=== World War II ===
In the lead-up to World War II, many people from Germany, particularly those belonging to minorities which were persecuted under Nazi rule, such as Jews, sought to emigrate to the United Kingdom, and it is estimated that as many as 50,000 may have been successful. There were immigration caps on the number who could enter and, subsequently, some applicants were turned away. When the UK declared war on Germany, however, migration between the countries ceased.

At the end of the Second World War, substantial groups of people from Soviet-controlled territories settled in the UK, particularly Poles and Ukrainians. The UK recruited displaced people as so-called European Volunteer Workers in order to provide labour to industries that were required in order to aid economic recovery after the war. In the 1951 United Kingdom census, the Polish-born population of the country numbered some 162,339, up from 44,642 in 1931. There was also an influx of refugees from Hungary, following the crushing of the 1956 Hungarian revolution, numbering 20,990 people.

=== Empire to Commonwealth ===
Following the end of the Second World War, the British Nationality Act 1948 allowed the 800,000,000 subjects in the British Empire to live and work in the United Kingdom without needing a visa, although this was not an anticipated consequence of the Act, which &quot;was never intended to facilitate mass migration&quot;. This migration was initially encouraged to help fill gaps in the UK labour market for both skilled and unskilled jobs, including in public services such as the newly created National Health Service and London Transport. Many people were specifically brought to the UK on ships; notably the &quot;Empire Windrush&quot; in 1948.

The Ireland Act 1949 has the unusual status of recognising the Republic of Ireland, but affirming that its citizens are not citizens of a foreign country for the purposes of any law in the United Kingdom. This act was initiated at a time when Ireland withdrew from the Commonwealth of Nations after declaring itself a republic.

Commonwealth immigration, made up largely of economic migrants, rose from 3,000 per year in 1953 to 46,800 in 1956 and 136,400 in 1961. The heavy numbers of migrants resulted in the establishment of a Cabinet committee in June 1950 to find &quot;ways which might be adopted to check the immigration into this country of coloured people from British colonial territories&quot;.

Indians began arriving in the UK in large numbers shortly after their country gained independence in 1947, although there were a number of people from India living in the UK even in the earlier years. More than 60,000 arrived before 1955, many of whom drove buses, or worked in foundries or textile factories. The flow of Indian immigrants peaked between 1965 and 1972, boosted in particular by Ugandan dictator Idi Amin&#x27;s sudden decision to expel all 50,000 Asians (people of Indian or Pakistani origin) from Uganda. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians emigrated to the UK.

Following the independence of Pakistan, Pakistani immigration to the United Kingdom increased, especially during the 1950s and 1960s. Many Pakistanis came to Britain following the turmoil during the partition of India and the subsequent independence of Pakistan; among them were those who migrated to Pakistan upon displacement from India, and then emigrated to the UK, thus becoming secondary migrants. Migration was made easier as Pakistan was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Pakistanis were invited by employers to fill labour shortages which arose after the Second World War. As Commonwealth citizens, they were eligible for most British civic rights. They found employment in the textile industries of Lancashire and Yorkshire, manufacturing in the West Midlands, and car production and food processing industries of Luton and Slough. It was common for Pakistani employees to work nightshifts and at other less-desirable hours.

In addition, there was a stream of migrants from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). During the 1970s, a large number of East African-Asians, most of whom already held British passports because they had been British subjects settled in the overseas colonies, entered the United Kingdom from Kenya and Uganda, particularly as a result of the expulsion of Asians from Uganda by Idi Amin in 1972. A majority of the Pakistani immigrants to UK trace their origin to Mirpur district in the region presently called Azad Kashmir.

=== Restrictions against immigration from Commonwealth ===
Although the Committee recommended not to introduce restrictions, the Commonwealth Immigrants Act was passed in 1962 as a response to public sentiment that the new arrivals &quot;should return to their own countries&quot; and that &quot;no more of them come to this country&quot;. Introducing the legislation to the House of Commons, the Conservative Home Secretary Rab Butler stated that:

The new Act required migrants to have a job before they arrived, to possess special skills or who would meet the &quot;labour needs&quot; of the national economy. In 1965, to combat the perceived injustice in the case where the wives of British subjects could not obtain British nationality, the British Nationality Act 1965 was adopted. 

Shortly afterwards, mainly Asian British passport holders from Kenya and Uganda, fearing discrimination from their own national governments, began to arrive in Britain; as they had retained their British nationality granted by the 1948 Act, they were not subject to the later controls. To manage this exodus from the former East African colonies, the Home secretary James Callaghan under a Labour party government introduced a bill in February 1968, and got it passed within a week. The new act called Commonwealth Immigrants Act placed entry controls on holders of British passports who had &quot;no substantial connection&quot; with Britain by setting up a new system.
For the first time, the 1968 Act required migrants to have a &quot;substantial connection with the United Kingdom&quot;, namely to be connected by birth or ancestry to a UK national. Those who did not could only obtain British nationality at the discretion of the national authorities. 

The Conservative MP Enoch Powell had campaigned hard for tighter controls on immigration, however one month after the adoption of the Act, Enoch Powell made his &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech. Enoch Powell gave the famous &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech on 20 April 1968 in which he warned his audience of what he believed would be the consequences of continued unchecked immigration from the Commonwealth to Britain. Conservative Party leader Edward Heath fired Powell from his Shadow Cabinet the day after the speech, and he never held another senior political post. Powell received 110,000 letters only 2,300 disapproving. Three days after the speech, on 23 April, as the Race Relations Bill was being debated in the House of Commons, around 2,000 dockers walked off the job to march on Westminster protesting against Powell&#x27;s dismissal, and the next day 400 meat porters from Smithfield market handed in a 92-page petition in support of Powell. At that time, 43% of junior doctors working in NHS hospitals, and some 30% of student nurses, were immigrants, without which the health service would needed to have been curtailed.

Until the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, all Commonwealth citizens could enter and stay in the UK without any restriction. The Act made Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKCs), whose passports were not directly issued by the UK Government (i.e., passports issued by the Governor of a colony or by the Commander of a British protectorate), subject to immigration control.

In 1972, the Heath administration introduced the first proposed Immigration Rules under the 1971 act. The rules proposal drew criticism from Conservative Party backbenchers, because it formally implemented a limit of six months of leave to enter as a visitor for white &quot;Old Commonwealth&quot; citizens who were &quot;non-patrial&quot; (did not have Right of Abode under the 1971 act, generally because they did not have a parent or grandparent from the UK). At the same time the proposal opened the door to free movement of certain European workers from European Economic Community member states. Seven backbenchers voted against the proposed Rules and 53 abstained, leading to defeat. Minutes from a Cabinet meeting the next day conclude that &quot;anti-European sentiment&quot; among backbenchers, who instead preferred &quot;Old Commonwealth&quot; migration to the UK, was at the core of the result. The proposal was revised, and the first Rules were passed in January 1973.The Act abolished the distinction between Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth entrants. The Conservative government nevertheless allowed, amid much controversy, the immigration of 27,000 individuals displaced from Uganda after the coup d&#x27;état led by Idi Amin in 1971. 

In the 1970s, an average of 72,000 immigrants were settling in the UK every year from the Commonwealth; this decreased in the 1980s and early-1990s to around 54,000 per year, only to rise again to around 97,000 by 1999. The total number of Commonwealth immigrants since 1962 is estimated at 2,500,000.

The British Nationality Act 1981, which was enacted in 1983, distinguishes between British citizens and British Overseas Territories citizens. It also made a distinction between nationality &quot;by descent&quot; and nationality &quot;other than by descent&quot;. Citizens by descent cannot automatically pass on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or its Overseas Territories (though in some situations the child can be registered as a citizen). Immigration officers have to be satisfied with a person&#x27;s nationality and identity and entry can be refused if they are not satisfied.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the civil war in Somalia led to a large number of Somali immigrants, comprising the majority of the current Somali population in the UK. In the late-1980s, most of these early migrants were granted asylum, while those arriving later in the 1990s more often obtained temporary status. There has also been some secondary migration of Somalis to the UK from the Netherlands and Denmark. The main driving forces behind this secondary migration included a desire to reunite with family and friends and for better employment opportunities.

=== The UK joins the European Union ===
One of the Four Freedoms of the European Union, of which the United Kingdom is a former member, is the right to the free movement of workers as codified in the Directive 2004/38/EC and the EEA Regulations (UK).

Research conducted by the Migration Policy Institute for the Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009, 1.5 million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, but that many have returned home, with the result that the number of nationals of the new member states in the UK increased by some 700,000 over the same period. Migration from Poland in particular has become temporary and circular in nature. In 2009, for the first time since the enlargement, more nationals of the eight Central and Eastern European states that joined the EU in 2004 left the UK than arrived. Research commissioned by the Regeneration and Economic Development Analysis Expert Panel suggested migrant workers leaving the UK due to the recession are likely to return in the future and cited evidence of &quot;strong links between initial temporary migration and intended permanent migration&quot;.

The Government announced that the same rules would not apply to nationals of Romania and Bulgaria (A2 nationals) when those countries acceded to the EU in 2007. Instead, restrictions were put in place to limit migration to students, the self-employed, highly skilled migrants and food and agricultural workers.

A report by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) entitled &quot;International Migration and Rural Economies&quot;, suggests that intra-EU migration since enlargement has resulted in migrants settling in rural locations without a prior history of immigration.

Research published by University College London in July 2009 found that, on average, A8 migrants were younger and better educated than the native population, and that if they had the same demographic characteristics of natives, would be 13 per cent less likely to claim benefits and 28 per cent less likely to live in social housing.

Non-European immigration rose significantly during the period from 1997, not least because of the government&#x27;s abolition of the primary purpose rule in June 1997. This change made it easier for UK residents to bring foreign spouses into the country.
The former government adviser Andrew Neather in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; stated that the deliberate policy of ministers from late-2000 until early-2008 was to open up the UK to mass migration.

With the expansion of the EU on 1 May 2004, the UK has accepted immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe, Malta and Cyprus, although the substantial Maltese, Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot communities were established earlier through their Commonwealth connection. There are restrictions on the benefits that members of eight of these accession countries (&#x27;A8&#x27; nationals) can claim, which are covered by the Worker Registration Scheme. Many other European Union member states exercised their right to temporary immigration control (which ended in 2011) over entrants from these accession states, but some subsequently removed these restrictions ahead of the 2011 deadline.

In June 2010, The newly elected Coalition government brought in a temporary cap on immigration of those entering the UK from outside the EU, with the limit set as 24,100, in order to stop an expected rush of applications before a permanent cap was imposed in April 2011. The cap caused tension within the coalition, and then-Business Secretary Vince Cable argued that it was harming British businesses. Others have argued that the cap would have a negative impact on Britain&#x27;s status as a centre for scientific research.

The Immigration Rules, under the Immigration Act 1971, were updated in 2012 (Appendix FM) to create a strict minimum income threshold for non-EU spouses and children to be given leave to remain in the UK. These rules were challenged in the courts, and in 2017 the Supreme Court found that while &quot;the minimum income threshold is accepted in principle&quot; they decided that the rules and guidance were defective and unlawful until amended to give more weight to the interests of the children involved, and that sources of funding other than the British spouse&#x27;s income should be considered.

=== Migration crisis ===
Since the mid-2010s there has been a significant amount of discussion and controversy propagated by the now infamous &quot;migration crisis&quot; in 2015. The crisis marked a period of intense debate that saw a rise in racist and anti-immigration rhetoric, in particular both fueled by and fueling Islamophobia and Anti-Muslim sentiment. There have been far-reaching effects induced by the crisis including Brexit, protests and riots, the rise of far-right political parties. 

The foreign-born population increased from about 5.3 million in 2004 to nearly 9.3 million in 2018. In the decade leading up to 2018, the number of non-EU migrants outnumbered EU migrants while the number of EU migrants increased more rapidly. EU migrants were noted to be less likely to become British citizens than non-EU migrants.
=== Brexit and COVID ===
In 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to reduce net migration to the UK (the number of people immigrating minus the number emigrating) below 250,000 per year. In 2021, net migration to the UK was 488,000, up from 184,000 in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Net migration to the UK reached a record high of 764,000 in 2022, with immigration at 1.26 million and emigration at 493,000. Most of the migrants came from non-EU countries, including India, Nigeria, China and Pakistan. Of the 1,218,000 immigrants who came to the UK in 2023, only 126,000 were citizens of EU member states. Since the full implementation of Brexit, more EU nationals are leaving the UK than moving to it. In the 12 months to June 2023, net migration of EU nationals was negative 86,000.

In January 2021, analysis by the Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence suggested that there had been an &quot;unprecedented exodus&quot; of almost 1.3 million foreign-born people from the UK between July 2019 and September 2020, in part due to the burden of job losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic falling disproportionately on foreign-born workers. Interviews conducted by Al Jazeera suggested that Brexit may have been a more significant push factor than the pandemic. Subsequent analysis of the impact of the pandemic on population statistics generated by the Labour Force Survey (LFS) suggests that &quot;LFS-based estimates are likely to significantly overstate the change in the non-UK national population&quot;. Payroll data shows that the number of EU workers fell by 7 per cent between October–December 2019 and October–December 2020.

The effects of the migration crisis continue in public discourse beyond the 2010s, as evident in the racist and anti-immigration protests and riots that have increased following Brexit.

Office for National Statistics migration estimates published in November 2021 suggest that the number of EU nationals leaving the UK exceeded the number arriving by around 94,000, compared to net inward migration from the EU to the UK of 32,000 in 2019. Some commentators suggested that these figures underestimate the extent of emigration of EU nationals from the UK.

Following the introduction of a liberal post-Brexit points based immigration system, net migration increased from 484,000 in 2021 to 634,000 in 2022 and 906,000 in 2023.

== Viewpoints on immigration ==
The Migration Advisory Committee was established in 2007 to give policy advice.

In February 2011, the Leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband, stated that he thought that the Labour government&#x27;s decision to permit the unlimited immigration of eastern European migrants had been a mistake, arguing that they had underestimated the potential number of migrants and that the scale of migration had had a negative impact on wages.

== Deportation ==
Expulsions of immigrants who had committed crimes varied between 4,000 and 5,000 a year between 2007 and 2010.

==Refugees and asylum seekers==
The UK is a signatory to the UN 1951 Refugee Convention as well as the 1967 Protocol and has therefore a responsibility to offer protection to people who seek asylum and fall into the legal definition of a &quot;refugee&quot;, and moreover not to return (or refoule) any displaced person to places where they would otherwise face persecution. Cuts to legal aid prevent asylum seekers getting good advice or arguing their case effectively. This can mean refugees being returned to a country where they face certain death.

The issue of immigration has been a controversial political issue since the late 1990s. Both the Labour Party and the Conservatives have suggested policies perceived as being &quot;tough on asylum&quot; (although the Conservatives have dropped a previous pledge to limit the number of people who could claim asylum in the UK, which would likely have breached the UN Refugee Convention) and the tabloid media frequently print headlines about an &quot;immigration crisis&quot;.

This is denounced, by those seeking to ensure that the UK upholds its international obligations, as disproportionate. Concern is also raised about the treatment of those held in detention and the practice of dawn raiding families, and holding young children in immigration detention centres for long periods of time. The policy of detaining asylum-seeking children was to be abandoned as part of the coalition agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who formed a government in May 2010. However, in July 2010 the government was accused of back-tracking on this promise after the Immigration Minister Damian Green announced that the plan was to minimise, rather than end, child detention.

However, critics of the UK&#x27;s asylum policy often point out the &quot;safe third country rule&quot; – the convention that asylum seekers must apply in the first free nation they reach, not go &quot;asylum shopping&quot; for the nation they prefer. EU courts have upheld this policy. Research conducted by the Refugee Council suggests that most asylum seekers in the UK had their destination chosen for them by external parties or agents, rather than choosing the UK themselves.

In February 2003, Prime Minister Tony Blair promised on television to reduce the number of asylum seekers by half within 7 months, apparently catching unawares the members of his own government with responsibility for immigration policy. David Blunkett, then the Home Secretary, called the promise an &quot;objective&quot; rather than a &quot;target&quot;.

It was met according to official figures. There is also a Public Performance Target to remove more asylum seekers who have been judged not to be refugees under the international definition than new anticipated unfounded applications. This target was met early in 2006. Official figures for numbers of people claiming asylum in the UK were at a 13-year low by March 2006.

Human rights organisations such as Amnesty International have argued that the government&#x27;s new policies, particularly those concerning detention centres, have detrimental effects on asylum applicants and their children, and those facilities have seen a number of hunger strikes and suicides. Others have argued that recent government policies aimed at reducing &#x27;bogus&#x27; asylum claims have had detrimental impacts on those genuinely in need of protection. Some housing funded by the Home Office, such as that provided by Clearsprings Ready Homes, has been repeatedly criticised for its poor quality.

The UK hosts one of the largest populations of Iraqi refugees outside the Gulf region. About 65-70% of people originating from Iraq are Kurdish, and 70% of those from Turkey and 15% of those from Iran are Kurds.

Asylum seekers have been kept in detention after the courts ordered their release because the Home Office maintains detention is not dissimilar to emergency accommodation. Immigrants with the right to stay in the UK are denied housing and cannot be released. In other cases vulnerable asylum seekers are released onto the streets with nowhere to live. In January 2018 the government repealed a law that previously allowed homeless detainees to apply for housing while in detention if they had nowhere to live when released. Charities maintain around 2,000 detainees who before this applied for support each year can no longer do so.

On 9 August 2020, the reports suggested that the number of people who reached the United Kingdom shores in small boats, during that year, surpassed 4,000. The undocumented migrant crossings of the English Channel mounted tensions between the UK and France.

On 17 August 2021, the United Kingdom Government launched a new resettlement programme which aims to settle 20,000 Afghan refugees fleeing the 2021 Taliban offensive over a five-year period in the UK. This includes many Afghans who worked with British forces in Afghanistan. Hundreds of former members of Afghanistan&#x27;s special forces have been refused resettlement to the UK. That same year the government also launched a scheme for Hongkongers following the Hong Kong national security law, with an estimated thousands emigrating to the UK either as refugees, asylum seekers or under student visas. By January 2024, more than 191,000 Hong Kong-born residents had applied for a visa.

As of May 2023, the United Kingdom has issued 230,300 visas to Ukrainians as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine from a total of 292,900 applications received.

The UK also operates the UK Resettlement Scheme, Community Sponsorship Scheme and Mandate Resettlement Scheme. Previous UK resettlement schemes included the Gateway Protection Programme and the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Programme.

==Illegal immigration==

Illegal immigrants in the UK include those who have:
* entered the UK without authority
* entered with false documents
* overstayed their visas

Although it is difficult to know how many people reside in the UK illegally, a Home Office study released in March 2005 estimated a population of between 310,000 and 570,000.

A recent study into irregular immigration states that &quot;most irregular migrants have committed administrative offences rather than a serious crime&quot;.

Jack Dromey, Deputy General of the Transport and General Workers Union and Labour Party treasurer, suggested in May 2006 that there could be around 500,000 illegal workers. He called for a public debate on whether an amnesty should be considered. David Blunkett has suggested that this might be done once the identity card scheme is rolled out.

London Citizens, a coalition of community organisations, is running a regularisation campaign called &quot;Strangers into Citizens&quot;, backed by figures including the former leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, the Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#x27;Connor. Analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggested that an amnesty could net the government up to £1.038 billion per year in fiscal revenue, however the long term implications of such a measure are uncertain.

It has since been suggested that to deport all of the illegal immigrants from the UK might take 20 years and cost up to £12 billion. Former Mayor of London Boris Johnson commissioned a study into a possible amnesty for illegal immigrants, citing larger tax gains within the London area which is considered to be home to the majority of the country&#x27;s population of such immigrants.

In February 2008, the government introduced new £10,000 fines for employers found to be employing illegal immigrants where there is negligence on the part of the employer, with unlimited fines or jail sentences for employers acting knowingly.

Women who are illegal immigrants and also domestic violence victims risk deportation and are deported if they complain about violence. Women get brought illegally into the UK by men intending to abuse them. Women are sometimes deterred from complaining about violence to them due to the risk of deportation, therefore perpetrators including rapists remain at large. Martha Spurrier of Liberty said, &quot;It will leave people afraid to report crime, robbing them of protection under the law and creating impunity for criminals who target vulnerable people with unsettled immigration status. This is criminalising victims and letting criminals off the hook.&quot;

Nearly 30,000 undocumented migrants crossed the Channel in small boats to the UK in 2023.

On 20 March 2024, 514 people crossed the UK Channel, the busiest day for Channel crossings since the start of 2024. Following this, on 21 March 2024, the UK government announced that it was dealing with a &quot;migration emergency.&quot;

<text>&quot;She Used to Be My Girl&quot; is the fourth episode of the sixteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 5, 2004. The episode was written by Tim Long and directed by Matthew Nastuk.

In this episode, Marge becomes jealous of her successful high school friend when Lisa begins to bond with her. Kim Cattrall guest starred as Chloe Talbot. The episode received negative reviews.

==Plot==
One day, Marge sees a friend from high school, Chloe Talbot, on TV and is jealous of her success as a news reporter. When they meet, an embarrassed Marge confesses she never left Springfield, but the two are glad to see each other again. Chloe comes to the Simpsons&#x27; house for dinner, but her exciting stories annoy Marge and inspire Lisa, who goes out to dinner with Chloe.

Marge reveals that she and Chloe were reporters for their high school newspaper, but after high school Marge stayed with her sweetheart Homer after Bart was born, with Chloe leaving her sweetheart Barney when he proposed. With all of Chloe&#x27;s success, Marge seems to begin to resent both her decision and her family but receives supporting words from Homer.

On their way back from dinner, Chloe invites Lisa to the United Nations women&#x27;s conference, with Lisa saying she would need parental permission. Upon arriving at the Simpsons house, a drunk Marge, who is worried that Lisa likes Chloe more, provokes Chloe and the two fight on the lawn. This leaves Marge with a black eye.

After Marge talks with Lisa about what happened, she forbids her to go to the women&#x27;s conference, but Lisa sneaks out and hides in Chloe&#x27;s car&#x27;s trunk. Then, as Chloe drives off, her boss calls her, telling her to cover the story of the eruption of Springfield Volcano. When Lisa pops out of the trunk, Chloe has her be her cameraman after her original one fled at the sight of lava.

When Marge and Homer arrive at the women&#x27;s conference to find Lisa, they see Chloe&#x27;s live broadcast from the volcano, crediting Lisa behind the camera and the two trapped by a sea of lava. Marge and Homer race to the volcano and the former leaps from rock to rock to rescue Lisa. Moments later, Barney descends in a helicopter to rescue Chloe, who grants him a half hour of pity sex.

When Marge imagines her life as a reporter, she screams to her family, who shows little interest.

==Production==
The episode was written by Tim Long. Kim Cattrall guest starred as Chloe Talbot.

==Reception==
===Viewing figures===
In its original American broadcast, &quot;She Used to Be My Girl&quot; was viewed by 10.3 million people.

===Critical response===
Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; said the episode was better than the previous one but thought the season&#x27;s focus on Marge and Lisa so far has not provided any &quot;good material&quot;.

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Guy Davis and Brendan Dando did not like the episode but liked the performance by Kim Cattrall. They also thought they had already seen previous episodes of Marge being jealous of other women whom Lisa idolizes.

<doc id="1247800" wikidata="Q8014724" url="?curid=1247800" title="William Low">
<text>William Low &amp; Co plc, popularly referred to as Willie Low&#x27;s and latterly marketed as Wm Low, was a chain of supermarkets headquartered in Dundee, Scotland. Initially founded in 1868, Low&#x27;s had branches throughout Scotland, North East England, Cumbria and Yorkshire. As a group, it was smaller than most of its competitors and often served small towns, although it still had several large hypermarkets. Low&#x27;s use to trade on their &quot;Scottishness&quot; as a unique selling point in Scotland. At one stage, the company also ran a chain of frozen food stores known as Lowfreeze. Lowfreeze was sold in 1987 to Bejam. 

The remaining business was purchased by Tesco for £257M in 1994. Tesco had to compete with rival competitor Sainsbury&#x27;s for the chain, with both companies looking to expand their foothold in Scotland. Following on from the takeover, the 57 William Low stores were converted to Tesco. Prior to this, there were only around 17 Tesco branches in Scotland. The purchase of Wm Low by Tesco moved them to the largest supermarket chain in the United Kingdom, beating Sainsbury&#x27;s for the first time.

==Early years==
James Low, who was born near Kirriemuir in 1849, completed a grocery apprenticeship in Kirriemuir before moving to Dundee in 1866. Two years later, with a £300 loan from Clydesdale Bank, he opened his own grocery store at 19 Hunter Street. By 1870, he was listed in the &quot;Dundee Directory&quot; as a grocery, tea and wine merchant at 11–13 Hunter Street. At this point, James&#x27;s younger brother, William, joined the business at the age of 12. A year later, James Low and William Lindsay, a local preserve, confectionery and bakery manufacturing business owner, formed a partnership, Low &amp; Lindsay, and by 1874 they had a further branch at 304 Perth Road and had moved into wholesaling. In 1879, William Low bought the business and it was renamed William Low &amp; Co. By 1881, the &quot;Dundee Directory&quot; listed the business as wholesale grocers and wine merchants, and the business had seven branches across Dundee. In 1884, the company opened a warehouse and headquarters at Blackness Road.

In 1885, William Rettie joined Low in partnership. Rettie was described in the 1877 &quot;Dundee Directory&quot; as a grocery and tea dealer, with stores in Rosebank Street and Dudhope Street. Rettie had married Low&#x27;s sister, Annie, in 1884. The &quot;Dundee Directory&quot; of 1885 had listed that the company had eight stores. In 1888, the company opened a wholesale department in Glasgow which facilitated the opening of six stores in the city by 1895, and the expansion of the business to 46 stores across different towns, including Crieff, Inverness and Stirling. The company further expanded two years later when they purchased Farrquar and Farrell, an Edinburgh-based tea and provision merchant, for £5,000. The company continued to expand, and by the turn of the century, the business had 64 stores spread between Hawick in the south to Dingwall in the Highlands. In 1917, the company became a private limited company, with William Low as chairman. The business not only had grocery stores, but their own bakery, bottling factory and butchery departments producing goods. William Rettie died in 1922, and was replaced as managing director by his son, Archibald, while William Low died in 1936, a year after his only son. At the start of World War II, Low&#x27;s had 84 branches. It was one of the larger grocery multiples, but still far smaller than the giant of Home and Colonial Stores.

==After World War II==
By 1951, the company had recorded pre-tax profits of £57,013. In the same year, Archibald died and would be replaced by his nephew Philip Rettie, joined by William Low&#x27;s grandson Ian Stewart, as joint managing directors in 1953. During the 1950s, the company started a modernisation programme with the business closing smaller non-profitable stores, replacing them with larger stores, and in 1958 opened its first self-service store, in Bellshill, as an experiment. A year later, James Millar joined as the company&#x27;s financial controller. By 1960, the self-service experiment had grown to nine stores, and by a year later reported that they accounted for 34% of the company&#x27;s sales. The company, however, did not follow other multiples, keeping a similar line as Sainsbury&#x27;s by not adopting the issuing of trading stamps.

The company quickly expanded its self-service stores, and by 1962 the business operated 26 of them out of its portfolio of 75, with some branches having off-licences, and larger stores getting in-store butcher counters. With the increase in turnover seen at self-service stores, the company opened their first supermarkets in Aberdeen and Broughty Ferry in 1963, following these up with further supermarkets opening in Lochee, Wishaw, Arbroath, Corstorphine, Fort William, Helensburgh and Kirkcaldy. At the same time, older stores were being closed. Sandy Leslie, who became the company&#x27;s retail director, stated that it was square-footage of stores, not the number of branches, by which the new criteria was measured; however, as the boss of fellow grocery chain Moores Stores also stated, the cost of developing supermarkets was expensive; there were too many supermarkets to be successful. By the end of 1969, the company had modernised the store portfolio and had nineteen supermarkets, eighteen self-service stores and five counter-service shops, a reduction of 33 stores from the total in 1962. Supermarkets in 1969 accounted for 78% of the company&#x27;s profits, with the business making a pre-tax profit of £260,180, but the profit margin was being squeezed by the growth of supermarket rivals.

==Modernisation and growth==

The company continued to grow its supermarket portfolio, and by 1972 it had grown to 31, with ten self-service stores, an increase of floorspace of 25%. James Millar stated that none of their stores were older than fifteen years. This was further accentuated with the opening of a new head office and distribution centre, at Dryburgh Industrial Estate in Dundee in October 1972, which incorporated modern data processing and warehousing methods. The company became a public limited company in 1973, launching on to the London Stock Exchange. In 1975, the company launched the first Scottish freezer chain with the opening of the first Lowfreeze store in Glenrothes. The company opened its largest supermarket to date in 1976, with a brand new store in Irvine. This was followed by the 1978 opening of the company&#x27;s first superstore, in Perth, at the cost of £1.5 million. The company moved into the low end of the market in 1976, when they launched their &quot;Discount Price Policy&quot;, which was a year earlier than Tesco&#x27;s own &quot;Operation Checkout&quot;. By 1980, the average size of the stores had doubled since 1972, with the company having 46 supermarkets and thirteen Lowfreeze stores. Lowfreeze by this point were generating over £5 million of the company&#x27;s £74 million turnover (compared to a £9 million turnover in 1970), but the company&#x27;s profit margins had fallen from 4.1% in 1970 to 2.4% by 1980.

Low&#x27;s continued to grow in the 1980s, included replacing stores, such as in Kirkcaldy, where a new superstore was opened in 1981. That outlet not only sold food but also sold non-grocery products, such as bedding, and had a 125-seater restaurant. Further developments included the new store at the junction of Queensferry Road and Kings Road in Rosyth, a store in Baltic Chambers, Grangemouth and further new stores in Wishaw, Oban and Linlithgow which opened in 1982. Low&#x27;s moved into the fast-food business in 1981, with the opening of McTatties, with restaurants opening in Glasgow and Edinburgh; however, this was unsuccessful and closed just a year later at a write down of £775,000. During 1982, it was reported that Hintons, another supermarket chain, were planning a takeover of Low&#x27;s, and the current market valuation was £12 million. Wm Low also rose to be included as number 400 in &quot;The Times 1000&quot;, a list of top UK companies, in 1984, whereas in 1976 it was not even listed.

In 1984, Wm Low attempted but failed to take over Hintons, which later became part of Argyll Group. By 1984, the company had reduced the number of stores, with WM Low&#x27;s having 45 and Lowfreeze having dropped from a high of 17 to 16; however, the average size of their stores had grown from in 1980 to , and turnover had grown to £150 million by 1984. The company had now an estimated 10% of the Scottish grocery market and had seen profit margins rise to 3.5%. In 1985, Wm Low took over Laws Stores at a cost of £6.8 million. Laws had a group predominantly based in the north-east of England with a portfolio of smaller stores than Wm Low. James Millar said of the deal:
 Laws was not the only acquisition that Low&#x27;s tried to complete in 1985, with discussions held with Hillards that went no further. In 1985, Philip Rettie retired, leaving Ian Stewart, now deputy chairman, as the only family member on the board, with the finance director James Millar taking on the role of managing director. During 1986, Wm Low closed unprofitable Laws stores, but the company&#x27;s profits fell by £400,000, dragged down by Laws performance. In 1987, Wm Low sold its frozen-food chain, Lowfreeze, to Bejam for £3.8 million, as it was only providing £10 million to the company&#x27;s £233 million turnover. During the same year, Low&#x27;s lost out to Argyll Group in bidding for the UK business of Safeway.

During 1988, Ian Stewart, the final family member on the board, retired. In April 1989, Wm Low attempted a friendly take over of Budgens, a small supermarket chain based mainly in the South East of England. The bid was withdrawn in May, after it was discovered that Budgens&#x27; loan commitments were greater than had previously been reported. The pulling out of the takeover had cost Low&#x27;s £2.5 million as a result of fees and having to pay for underwriting commitments which were no longer required. The company opened new stores in Dumfries and Northallerton. In the 1988–89 trading year, Low&#x27;s turnover exceeded £300 million for the first time, and the company&#x27;s profit margin had increased to 5.8%. Low&#x27;s, by the start of the decade, had 46 stores and ; however, by the end of the 1980s the company had 63 supermarkets and of selling space. The business, at this point, was the tenth-largest Scottish company.

In 1990, Low&#x27;s were in discussion with Isosceles, owners of Gateway Supermarkets, to purchase 81 stores for £212 million, with some to be sold off to the Co-operative Wholesale Society to help fund the move, but this fell through as Low&#x27;s did not want to take on Gateway&#x27;s smaller outdated stores. The company floated a rights issue in December 1990 which raised £37.2 million. £12 million of this was used to develop a new multi-temperate distribution centre in Livingston and updating the company&#x27;s computer systems. In 1991, the company made a pre-tax profit of £23.6 million, but in 1992 they had fallen to £19 million, even though the company had invested in five news stores, including Milngavie and Whitehaven, which had added a further of retailing space to the company. The company chairman told shareholders:
Expansion into the north and midlands of England was a priority, with the £12 million, Loughborough store opening in 1993. The company announced that this was the furthest south that the business would grow to, as it was at the limit of the company&#x27;s distribution network. The business also opened new stores in Montrose, Tayside, Ilkeston, Campbeltown, Dundee and completed an extension to the Linlithgow store; however, during the year, the company started discussions with Safeway about a store swap, with Low&#x27;s trading some of their bigger stores for Safeway&#x27;s smaller units in more preferential geographical areas, but nothing came of it. The stockbroker Hoare Govett stated in their April 1994 circular they saw Low&#x27;s as &quot;neither a genuine superstore operator nor a genuine discounter&quot;.

The Scottish Business Insider quoted that Low&#x27;s yearly performance figures for the 1990s were:

*1991: £354 million turnover, £21 million profit
*1992: £394 million turnover, £23 million profit
*1993: £253 million turnover, £20 million profit
*1994: £446 million turnover, £21 million profit

Staff numbers at Low&#x27;s, prior to the takeover, had been reasonably static: from 8,799 employees in 1991 to 8,981 in 1994.

==The takeover==
The takeover battle for William Low started on 14 July 1994, when Tesco announced its formal bid of £154 million for the company to dramatically improve its Scottish portfolio and an assurance it would not cherry pick the best stores. Two weeks later, J Sainsbury launched a counter-bid of £210 million, with chairman David Sainsbury stating: 

Sainsbury was keen to gain a stronger foothold in Scotland, having only three stores in Scotland at the time of the bid. Tesco, at the time, had 7.1% of the Scottish grocery market, while Sainsbury&#x27;s had 4.9%, against Low&#x27;s 6.6%. Analysis at the time predicted that the cost, although fourteen times what Low&#x27;s earnings were, would be the same as building 25 new stores. Analysts reported that Sainsbury&#x27;s were interested in Low&#x27;s seventeen larger stores and its distribution centres, with Sainsbury&#x27;s suggesting they had received bids for some of the smaller stores.

The Argyll Group, owners of Safeway and Scotland&#x27;s biggest grocery retailer, announced in July 1994 that it would not be making a bid for Wm Low. Tesco reacted with an improved offer of £247 million and Sainsbury&#x27;s withdrew from the battle, with David Sainsbury stating: 
At the time, Tesco products were, on average, 9% cheaper than Low&#x27;s, with analysts predicting that Tesco could lift the company&#x27;s profits by £15 million; however, Tesco also had to take on Low&#x27;s debt, which stood at £77 million. Tesco formally took over Wm Low on 2 September 1994 for a total sum of £257 million, ending 126 years of business. The purchase of Wm Low doubled Tesco&#x27;s Scottish market share from 7.6% to 15.3% in 1995. After the takeover, &quot;The Financial Times&quot; questioned why Low&#x27;s share price only rose from 138p in April to 169p in July, when Tesco paid 360p, and &quot;was their something wrong with the financial community&#x27;s ability to value such quoted companies?&quot;

Tesco closed the Dundee headquarters of Wm Low, with the loss of 300 jobs, opening a smaller Tesco Scottish office to deal with local suppliers that employed twenty people. A re-fit programme followed, and Tesco scanning tills were installed at every store by August 1995, with the refit being completed by the end of 1996 at a cost of £35 million. At the time of the Tesco takeover, a number of new Wm Low Stores were earmarked for development. These were ultimately launched as Tescos but had been planned by Wm Low. This included Aviemore, Cupar, Falkirk and Dunblane, opened between 1995 and 1996. 

The distribution centre at the Dryburgh Estate in Dundee became the Tesco customer-service centre and one of two Scottish distribution depots for Tesco. In 2006, Tesco announced the closure of the Dundee depot to create a new centre in Livingston, on the site of the former NEC factory, which would also replace the current distribution centre already based in Livingston (now open as of October 2007). The adjacent customer-service centre was unaffected by the closure. The warehouse at Dundee was demolished in 2019.

Prior to the takeover, sales had been falling at a rate of 6%, a figure that Tesco reversed to a growth of 25% at the end of 1994–95 in the former Low&#x27;s stores.

== 1964 Aberdeen typhoid outbreak ==

On 6 and 7 May 1964, the Aberdeen branch delicatessen used a tin of Argentinian corned beef that had not been processed properly (and was infected with typhoid). The meat was sliced using a communal deli slicer, resulting in approximately 500 locals being with suspected typhoid. Wm Low was never successful in the city again, with their branch closing in the city three years later.

<text>Troublemaker Studios is an American independent production company founded and owned by filmmaker Robert Rodriguez and producer Elizabeth Avellán.

The company is based in Austin, Texas, and is at the former site of the Robert Mueller Municipal Airport. It shares space with Austin Studios, which is managed by the Austin Film Society, and houses production offices, sound stages and the largest green screen in Texas.

==Background==
The company was founded in 1991 as Los Hooligans Productions, taking its name from Rodriguez&#x27;s own comic strip, &quot;Los Hooligans&quot;, which he wrote and illustrated for three years while attending the University of Texas at Austin. Rodriguez chose the name so fans of the strip would recognize it when they saw his films. Since the 1990s, the studio has partnered with distributor Dimension Films on numerous projects; including the &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; films and &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;, the third film in the &quot;Mexico Trilogy&quot;. 

The company was reincorporated as Troublemaker Studios in 2000. 2001&#x27;s &quot;Spy Kids&quot;, a family-oriented film, was considered the studio&#x27;s first breakthrough hit. It has since spawned a long-running media franchise, including sequels and an animated series. 

On August 12, 2021, the company had signed a deal with HBO and its HBO Max streaming service.

<text>The Ústí massacre (, German: &quot;Massaker von Aussig&quot;) was a lynching of ethnic Germans in Ústí nad Labem (&quot;Aussig an der Elbe&quot;), a largely ethnic German city in northern Bohemia (&quot;Sudetenland&quot;), shortly after the end of World War II, on 31 July 1945. During the incident, 43 Germans were said to be killed but the estimated possible numbers ranged from 80 to hundreds of victims.

Intelligence officer and police commandant Bedřich Pokorný, who previously took part in the organisation of so called Brno death march in May 1945, has been sometimes accused of organizing this massacre towards the end of the Potsdam conference (17 July to 2 August 1945) after the government had halted such acts.

On 31 July 2005, the mayor of Ústí unveiled a memorial plaque on the bridge with the text &quot;In the memory of victims of violence on 31 July 1945&quot; (photographs).

==Cause and conflict==
On July 31, at 15:30, an ammunition dump in the part of the city called Krásné Březno exploded. The death toll was 26 or 27 people (7 of them Czechs), dozens were injured.

Immediately after the explosion, a massacre of ethnic Germans, who had to wear white armbands after the war and so were easy to identify, began in four places in the city. They were beaten and bayonetted, shot or drowned in a fire pond. On the Elbe bridge, a German, Georg Schörghuber, shouted something provocative and was thrown into the river by the crowd, and shot by soldiers when he was trying to swim out. Soon other people, including a woman with a baby and pram, were thrown into the water and later shot at. The perpetrators were the &quot;Revolutionary Guards&quot; (a post-war paramilitary group), Czech and Soviet soldiers, and a group of unknown Czechs who had recently arrived from elsewhere. Local Czechs, including the mayor, Josef Vondra, tried to help the victims. Finally, a state of emergency and a curfew were declared, and by 18:25, streets had been cleared by the army.

==Count of victims==
The estimated number of victims is 80–120, with 43 being accounted for specifically: 24 bodies gathered in the city were burned in the crematorium of the former concentration camp in Terezín on 1 August; a list was made of the 17 missing clerks from the &quot;Schicht&quot; factory, who were returning from work by way of the bridge at the time of the explosion; and two are mentioned in other sources. In Germany, several dozen bodies were recovered from the Elbe river in the following weeks; however, these could have come from elsewhere. The Sudeten Germans organisations give much higher numbers - from 400 up to 8,000.

==Subsequent effects==
The next day, 1 August, the government of Czechoslovakia established an investigation commission led by General Ludvík Svoboda. The commission was not able to discover the reason for the explosion but blamed it on the Werewolves (German saboteurs).

The explosion and subsequent massacre were used as a pretext by advocates of the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. During the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia (1948–1989) details of the event were suppressed, to the point of it being almost unknown to most Czechs.

==Suspected communist involvement==
After the 1989 Velvet Revolution, city archivist Vladimír Kaiser started to investigate the event, most recently publishing the results together with Jan Havel, another Ústí citizen, and German historian Otfrid Pustejovsky as &quot;Stalo se v Ústí nad Labem 31. července 1945&quot; (Ústí nad Labem 2005, ; German translation &quot;Ein Nachkriegs-Verbrechen: Aussig 31. Juli 1945&quot;; ). While only indirect evidence survived, they conclude that the explosion and massacre were prepared by Communists within the Czechoslovak secret services, specifically Bedřich Pokorný, leader of Ministry of Interior&#x27;s Defensive Intelligence (&quot;Obranné zpravodajství&quot;) department who earlier organised the Brno death march, in order to support the transfer of Germans from Czechoslovakia by presenting to the Potsdam Conference an argument that further cohabitation of Germans with Czechs was impossible. (Kaiser&#x27;s 2000 hypothesis that the motive was the Western powers&#x27; interest in destroying the new Daimler-Benz DB 605 airplane engines also stored in the dump was found far-fetched and untenable.)

<text>The Control-Vision (codenamed NEMO) is an unreleased video game console developed by Tom Zito. It is notable for using VHS tapes rather than ROM cartridges, prompting the creation of game content which survived on into much more advanced CD-ROM platforms.

== History ==
Originally codenamed &quot;NEMO&quot;, initial development began in 1985 and was supported by Nolan Bushnell&#x27;s company Axlon. The team, which included Apple Computer co-founder Steve Wozniak, created a prototype using a modified ColecoVision console to combine interactive images with a video stream transmitted through a cable. As a storage medium, NEMO employs VHS tapes that contain computer data alongside a grid of multiple tracks of video and audio that can be toggled.

To take the project beyond prototype status, they searched for a partner who would fund further development. The Hasbro toy company agreed to invest $7 million in exchange for the video game rights to the technology.

Three short trial games were finished by the middle of 1986: &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;, a four-minute interactive mystery; &quot;Bottom of the Ninth Inning&quot;, a baseball game; and an interactive music video for the song &quot;You Might Think&quot; by The Cars. The next step was the interactive movie &quot;Night Trap&quot;, inspired by &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;, and filmed in December 1986 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, the hometown of Hasbro. In 1987, Zito created the second full-size game named &quot;Sewer Shark&quot;, in one month&#x27;s filming time and at a cost of $3 million.

After filming for &quot;Sewer Shark&quot; was completed, and two months prior to the 1989 release, Hasbro abandoned the project because the projected price was deemed uncompetitive against the well established and much cheaper Nintendo Entertainment System. Zito purchased the rights to the games and stored everything in a Rhode Island warehouse. In the late 1980s, Zito hired Mark Turmell, who go on to create &quot;NBA Jam&quot; and &quot;Smash T.V.&quot;, to develop two more interactive games, &quot;Citizen X&quot;, and a licensed tie-in game of &quot;Police Academy&quot;.

== Legacy ==
It was not until the early 1990s that the CD-ROM became an affordable mass storage medium for video game consoles, enabling full-motion video (FMV) games at home. Sega was looking for content for the 1992 introduction of the Sega CD accessory for the Genesis console. They contacted Zito, who created versions of &quot;Sewer Shark&quot; and &quot;Night Trap&quot; for Sega CD through his Digital Pictures company. Ports to other systems would soon follow.

Footage of a presentation of a NEMO prototype to Hasbro executives can be found in the Sega CD version of &quot;Night Trap&quot; when entering a cheat code. Lawrence H. Bernstein, working for Milton Bradley Company at that time, plays &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;, the prototype of &quot;Night Trap&quot;. A playable version of &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; can be found in &quot;Night Trap: 25th Anniversary Edition&quot;.

<doc id="1247822" wikidata="Q3860900" url="?curid=1247822" title="Monkey Island (album)">
<text>Monkey Island is the seventh studio album by American rock band the J. Geils Band, though it is credited with the shortened band name of &quot;Geils&quot;, the only album in their catalog for which this was done. The album was released on June 9, 1977, by Atlantic Records.

The album did not perform well in the marketplace, and would be the J. Geils Band&#x27;s last original album for Atlantic Records after almost eight years with the label. It was, however, the band&#x27;s first album on which they did not use an outside producer, as well as their first project with recording engineer David Thoener, with whom they later collaborated on their best-selling albums &quot;Love Stinks&quot; and &quot;Freeze Frame&quot;.

The album contains the studio version of &quot;I Do,&quot; a live recording of which (from the album &quot;Showtime!&quot;) would be the J. Geils Band&#x27;s last hit single in 1982.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined that &quot;Geils is in dire need of a well-focused musical approach if the band wishes to revive its early power and promise.&quot;

<text>A trochophore () is a type of free-swimming planktonic marine larva with several bands of cilia.

By moving their cilia rapidly, they make a water eddy to control their movement, and to bring their food closer in order to capture it more easily.

== Occurrence ==
Trochophores exist as a larval form within the trochozoan clade, which include the entoprocts, molluscs, annelids (including echiurans and sipunculans) and nemerteans. Together, these phyla make up part of the Lophotrochozoa; it is possible that trochophore larvae were present in the life cycle of the group&#x27;s common ancestor.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;trochophore&quot; derives from the ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;wheel&quot;, and () — or () —, meaning &#x27;to bear, to carry&#x27;, because the larva is bearing a wheel-shaped band of cilia.

== Feeding habits ==
Trochophore larvae are often planktotrophic; that is, they feed on other plankton species.

== Life cycle==

The example of the development of the annelid &quot;Pomatoceros lamarckii&quot; (family Serpulidae) shows various trochophore stages (image: D-F):&lt;br&gt;
D - early trochophore ;&lt;br&gt;
E - complete trochophore ;&lt;br&gt;
F - late trochophore ;&lt;br&gt;
G - metatrochophore.

<text>NORA is an American metalcore band from Highland Park, New Jersey. The band took its name from Nora Diniro, a character from the film &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot;.

Nora&#x27;s members began playing together in 1996, and their first release was the &quot;Kill You For A Dollar EP&quot; followed soon after by a split CDEP with the Dillinger Escape Plan on Ferret Records. The band then moved over to Trustkill Records in 1999 and issued another EP, called Neverendingyouline. Following this EP, Mike Olender and John Kohler left to pursue Burnt By The Sun and Ex Number Five, and the band moved forward with Matt &quot;Portland&quot; Hay and Matt &quot;Frenchie&quot; Haick filling the guitar spots. Poison the Well guitarist Ryan Primack also filled in for the band&#x27;s performance at Hellfest in 2000.

The band released their first album, &quot;Losers&#x27; Intuition&quot; in 2001. Following the departure of Matt Haick, who left to pursue his other project Merciana, and original bassist Spliedt during 2002, the lineup of Severson, Hay (guitar), Ross (drums) welcomed new bassist Tim Cuccolo (ex-Ex Number Five) and Chris Byrnes (guitar) and released &quot;Dreamers &amp; Deadmen&quot; in 2003. Cuccolo later left and with Byrnes moving over to bass, second guitarist Steve &quot;Steve Jeff&quot; Chladnicek joined on in early 2004. The following year, Byrnes exited to go join Every Time I Die, and former Nora guitarist/Burnt by the Sun vocalist Mike Olender came back in his place. Nora entered the studio in early 2007 to record and release &quot;Save Yourself&quot;, and went dormant soon after until 2015.

Vocalist Carl Severson was owner of hardcore record label Ferret Music but has since moved on to start Good Fight Entertainment since the Warner Bros buy out of Ferret.

Carl Severson and Mike Olender attended high school with Trustkill owner and president Josh Grabelle.

<doc id="1247851" wikidata="Q9302554" url="?curid=1247851" title="Giygas">
<text>Giygas ( ), also known as Giegue, and in Japan, is a character in the &quot;Mother&quot; video game series by Nintendo, created by Shigesato Itoi. The character serves as the main antagonist and final boss of &quot;Mother&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Mother 2/EarthBound&quot;. In the series, he invades Earth in an attempt to wipe out humanity in &quot;Mother&quot;, and returns in &quot;EarthBound&quot; where he conquers the world and sends his forces into the past to prevent protagonist Ness from defeating him. The battle against Giygas, which depicts him in turmoil, drew inspiration from a Japanese film which traumatized Itoi as a child. He has received positive reception with critics referring to his battle as one of the creepiest in video games, and considered one of the greatest and most iconic video game antagonists of all time.

==Concept and creation==
Giygas was designed and written by the creator of the &quot;EarthBound&quot; series, Shigesato Itoi, and debuted in the original &quot;Mother&quot;, where he is called Giegue in the English localization. In an interview on his website, Itoi describes how his inspiration for the final battle with Giygas in &quot;EarthBound&quot; resulted from a traumatic childhood event where he accidentally viewed the wrong movie at a theater, a Shintoho film entitled &quot;Kenpei to Barabara Shibijin&quot;. The film featured a murder scene near a river that Itoi mistook for a rape scene which affected him so much that his parents began to worry about his well-being. Years later, Itoi integrated the experience into Giygas&#x27; dialogue for the final battle. Itoi described Giygas as something that people cannot make sense of, but also as a living being who deserves love. He described the film scene as a combination of atrocity and eroticism, and that is what his lines are in the end. While designing this battle, Itoi spoke all of the text out loud while another staff member, Matchan Miura, wrote it down. He spoke each hiragana character one-after-another because he found it scarier. There has been a misunderstanding regarding the influence of the film on Giygas, with some believing that imagery, dialogue, or audio from that film were used here, when the only thing Itoi took from it was the ability to &quot;manipulate an audience&#x27;s emotional state&quot;. Music composer Hirokazu Tanaka described Giygas as the &quot;embodiment of evil&quot;. As a result, he composed the music in a certain way based on the player&#x27;s proximity to him. For example, in battles where Ness and company encounter someone or something under Giygas&#x27; control, the music and sound effects reflect this.

Before the release of &quot;EarthBound&quot;, the localization team had at one point considered localizing Giygas as his original name Giegue or Geek. It was speculated that the change from Giegue to Giygas was due to a change in localization staff. An urban legend exists that suggests that the final battle with Giygas in &quot;EarthBound&quot; was an &quot;alien abortion&quot;. Marcus Lindblom, a member of the English localization team, acknowledged the urban legend, noting that he appreciated the speculation, but debunked the idea as an official interpretation.

==Appearances==
Giygas appears in the Family Computer video game &quot;Mother&quot;. Giygas was raised by Maria, a woman abducted along with her husband George by Giygas&#x27; alien race from Earth in the early 1900s. George studied the aliens&#x27; PSI powers without permission and escaped back to Earth. Once he matured, Giygas was tasked by his people to make sure that PSI never spread onto Earth. However, Giygas did not want to betray those who raised him, particularly Maria. In the end, he forced himself to detach from Maria and began preparations for the aliens&#x27; invasion. Eighty years later, strange things start happening on Earth. These events are eventually revealed to be the work of Giygas. Maria, now a Queen in a magical world called Magicant, explains everything to the protagonists of &quot;Mother&quot; after her memories are restored. When the protagonists encounter Giygas, he explains his motives to them while attacking them with his PSI power. Maria urges her descendant, the also PSI-user protagonist Ninten to sing her Eight Melodies, which weakens Giygas. Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd sing together, forcing Giygas to surrender and flee.

Giygas also appears in the Super NES sequel &quot;EarthBound&quot;. Giygas is an unseen villain for most of the story, although he possesses humans, animals, and objects who unknowingly do his bidding. According to a character from the future named Buzz Buzz, Giygas destroys the universe ten years in the future. One of his key minions is Pokey Minch, a boy who lived in Ness&#x27;s neighborhood. At first, Dr. Andonuts (the father of playable character Jeff) believes that Giygas is residing deep within the Earth, and transports himself and the party there using a machine called the Phase Distorter. When they arrive, they find that Giygas is attacking from that exact location, but from innumerable years in the past. The only way the protagonists can get to Giygas&#x27; time period is to alter the Phase Distorter to transport them back in time. When the group finally reaches Giygas, he initially resembles Ness while in the device called the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Machine&quot;. Pokey reveals that Giygas&#x27; PSI power has grown so strong that it destroyed his mind and drove him mad. Pokey then turns the Devil&#x27;s Machine off and releases Giygas, who now takes the form of a swirling red agonized face. At this point, Giygas&#x27; words and attacks are nondescript and nonsensical, more akin to a stream of consciousness than anything else. Giygas is eventually destroyed by Paula, who prays to the protagonists&#x27; friends and family for help. Her praying eventually reaches the player, and the combined prayers do enough damage to Giygas to kill him.

==Reception==
Since appearing in &quot;EarthBound&quot;, Giygas has received largely positive reception. His role and design was regarded as contrasting with the otherwise lighthearted tone of the rest of &quot;EarthBound&quot;″s story by Brittany Vincent for &quot;G4TV&quot;. Cassandra Ramos for &quot;RPGamer&quot; identified him as one of her favorite villains, while &quot;1UP.com&quot; staff described the battle with Giygas as one of the 25 best boss battles, citing the audio and imagery of Giygas as well as the final portion of the battle. Jeremy Parish for &quot;1UP.com&quot; used the battle as an example of how games subvert expectations, where the protagonists employ prayer instead of their most powerful attacks to win. &quot;IGN&quot; staff included the battle with Giygas in their list of the 10 most cinematic video game moments. &quot;NGamer UK&quot; staff listed Giygas as one of the most iconic boss encounters in Nintendo history, stating that the defining moment was his design and the method of defeating him. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; staff named him one of the best video game antagonists, finding him creepy and a more imposing villain than Kefka Palazzo from &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Staff for &quot;Complex&quot;, &quot;GameSpot&quot;, and &quot;UGO Networks&quot; listed the fight against Giygas as one of the hardest in video games, with the latter and Chloi Rad for &quot;IGN&quot; calling him one of the most frightening video game characters. He was featured in a &quot;GameSpot&quot; user-voted poll of the greatest villains in video games, where he lost in the first round to &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; antagonist Darth Malak.

Nadia Oxford for &quot;IGN&quot; described the battle with Giygas as one of the most memorable moments in &quot;EarthBound&quot; and stated that its significance resonated with people who had not played the game, a sentiment that Cassandra Ramos of &quot;RPGamer&quot; shared. In a work for &quot;1UP.com&quot;, Oxford claimed that Itoi took inspiration from Stephen King novels, including &quot;It&quot;. She suggested that Giygas was based on &quot;It&quot;″s antagonist due to a similarly &quot;borderline indescribable&quot; form and the fact that they both succumb to childlike qualities such as faith, friendship, and love. She discusses how the battle with Giygas in &quot;Mother&quot; deviates from traditional final boss battles, citing his deep motivations and music employed, which consists of a &quot;shrill background noise&quot; and a lullaby. She suggested that Giygas&#x27; degraded form in &quot;EarthBound&quot; was possibly the result of Giygas&#x27; longing for Maria&#x27;s love. Patricia Hernandez for Nightmare Mode discussed how his &quot;Mother&quot; incarnation &quot;echoes a motif&quot; of children without parental guidance doing poorly for it. Colin Snyder for &quot;Vice&quot; felt similarly, stating that his story is about the loss of childhood. William Hughes for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; argued that Giygas had an oedipal complex due to his infatuation with his surrogate mother and hatred for his surrogate father over him stealing information from the aliens.

<doc id="1247858" wikidata="Q963254" url="?curid=1247858" title="Write Anywhere File Layout">
<text>The Write Anywhere File Layout (WAFL) is a proprietary file system that supports large, high-performance RAID arrays, quick restarts without lengthy consistency checks in the event of a crash or power failure, and growing the filesystems size quickly. It was designed by NetApp for use in its storage appliances like NetApp FAS, AFF, Cloud Volumes ONTAP and ONTAP Select.

Its author claims that WAFL is not a file system, although it includes one. It tracks changes similarly to journaling file systems as logs (known as NVLOGs) in dedicated memory storage device non-volatile random access memory, referred to as NVRAM or NVMEM. WAFL provides mechanisms that enable a variety of file systems and technologies that want to access disk blocks.

==Design==

WAFL stores metadata, as well as data, in files; metadata, such as inodes and block maps indicating which blocks in the volume are allocated, are not stored in fixed locations in the file system. The top-level file in a volume is the inode file, which contains the inodes for all other files; the inode for the inode file itself, called the root inode, is stored in a block with a fixed location. An inode for a sufficiently small file contains the file&#x27;s contents; otherwise, it contains a list of pointers to file data blocks or a list of pointers to indirect blocks containing lists of pointers to file data blocks, and so forth, with as many layers of indirect blocks as are necessary, forming a tree of blocks. All data and metadata blocks in the file system, other than the block containing the root inode, are stored in files in the file system. The root inode can thus be used to locate all of the blocks of all files other than the inode file.

Main memory is used as a page cache for blocks from files. When a change is made to a block of a file, the copy in the page cache is updated and marked dirty, and the difference is logged in non-volatile memory in a log called the &quot;NVLOG&quot;. If the dirty block in the page cache is to be written to permanent storage, it is not rewritten to the block from which it was read; instead, a new block is allocated on permanent storage, the contents of the block are written to the new location, and the inode or indirect block that pointed to the block in question is updated in main memory. If the block containing the inode, or the indirect block, is to be written to permanent storage, it is also written to a new location, rather than being overwritten at its previous position. This is what the &quot;Write Anywhere&quot; in &quot;Write Anywhere File Layout&quot; refers to.

As all blocks, other than the block containing the root inode, are found via the root inode, none of the changes written to permanent storage are visible on permanent storage until the root inode is updated. The root inode is updated by a process called a &quot;consistency point&quot;, in which all dirty blocks not yet written to permanent storage are written to permanent storage, and a new root inode is written out, pointing to the blocks in the new version of the inode file. At that point, all of the changes to the file system are visible on permanent storage, using the new root inode. The NVLOG entries for changes that are now visible are discarded to make room for log entries for subsequent changes. Consistency points are performed periodically or if the non-volatile memory is close to being full of log entries.

If the server crashes before all changes to a file system have been made visible in a consistency point, the changes that have not been made visible are still in the NVLOG; when the server reboots, it replays all entries in the NVLOG, again making the changes recorded in the NVLOG, so that they will not be lost.

==Features==
As discussed above, WAFL does not store data or metadata in pre-determined locations on disk. Instead it automatically places data using temporal locality to write metadata alongside user data in a way designed to minimize the number of disk operations required to commit data to stable disk storage using single and dual parity based RAID.

Using a data placement based on temporal locality of reference can improve the performance of reading datasets which are read in a similar way to the way they were written (e.g. a database record and its associated index entry), however it can also cause fragmentation from the perspective of spatial locality of reference. On spinning HDDs this does not adversely affect files that are sequentially written, randomly read, or are subsequently read using the same temporal pattern, but does affect sequential read after random write spatial data access patterns because of magnetic head could be only in one position at a time to read data from platter while fragmentation does no effect on SSD drives.

Releases of ONTAP since 7.3.1 have included a number of techniques to optimize spatial data layout such as the &quot;reallocate&quot; command to perform scheduled and manual defragmentation, and the &quot;Write after Reading&quot; volume option which detects and automatically corrects suboptimal data access patterns caused by spatial fragmentation. Releases of ONTAP 8.1.1 include other techniques to automatically optimize contiguous free-space within the filesystem which also helps to maintain optimal data layouts for most data access patterns. Before 7G, the &quot;wafl scan reallocate&quot; command would need to be invoked from an advanced privilege level and could not be scheduled. Releases of ONTAP since 9.1 have included a number of techniques to optimize SSD usage such as Inline Data Compaction (in 9.1), starting with ONTAP 9.2 FabricPool functionality for automatic tiering of cold data to slow S3 storage and back if needed for SSD aggregates, and Cross Volume Deduplication within an aggregate with maximum of 800TiB for each aggregate.

===Snapshots===
WAFL supports &quot;snapshots&quot;, which are read-only copies of a file system. Snapshots are created by performing the same operations that are performed in a consistency point, but, instead of updating the root inode corresponding to the current state of the file system, saving a copy of the root inode. As all data and metadata in a file system can be found from the root inode, all data and metadata in a file system, as of the time when the snapshot is created, can be found from the snapshot&#x27;s copy of the root inode. No other data needs to be copied to create a snapshot.

Blocks are allocated when written using a block map, which keeps track of which blocks are in use and which blocks are free. An entry in the block map contains a bit indicating whether the block is in use in the current version of the file system and several bits, one per snapshot, indicating whether the block is in use in the snapshot. This ensures that data in a snapshot is not overwritten until the snapshot is deleted. Using block map all new writes and rewrites are written to new empty blocks, WAFL only reports that block rewrite successful, but no rewrites actually occur, this approach called Redirect-on-write (ROW) technique. ROW is much faster on rewrite operations compare to Copy-on-write where old data block going to be rewritten in-place and captured in a snapshot needs to be copied first to space allocated for snapshot reserve in order to preserve original data, this generates additional data copy operations once system get rewrites to that block.

Snapshots provide online backups that can be accessed quickly, through special hidden directories in the file system, allowing users to recover files that have been accidentally deleted or modified.

NetApp&#x27;s Data ONTAP Release 7G operating system supports a read-write snapshot called &quot;FlexClone&quot;. Snapshots are basis for technologies like SnapMirror, SnapVault and Online Volume Move while features like FlexClone, SnapLock, SnapRestore are snapshot-like technologies leverage on WAFL capabilities and properties like manipulations with inodes. Starting with ONTAP 9.4 maximum number of snapshots supported for each FlexVol is 1024, while for previous versions max limit was 255.

Starting with ONTAP 9.5 snapshot sharing functionality were added to run deduplication scan across Active file system and snapshots, and deduplication savings is a magnitude of number of snapshots. Before 9.5 not deduplicated data locked in a snapshot couldn’t be used by deduplication process and runs only in active file system.

===File and directory model===
An important feature of WAFL is its support for both a Unix-style file and directory model for NFS clients and a Microsoft Windows-style file and directory model for SMB clients. WAFL also supports both security models, including a mode where different files on the same volume can have different security attributes attached to them. Unix can use either access control lists (ACL) or a simple bitmask, whereas the more recent Windows model is based on access control lists. These two features make it possible to write a file to an SMB type of networked filesystem and access it later via NFS from a Unix workstation. Alongside ordinary files, WAFL can contain file-containers called LUNs with required special attributes like LUN serial number for block devices, which could be accessed using SAN protocols running on ONTAP OS software.

===FlexVol===

Each Flexible Volume (FlexVol) is a separate WAFL file system, located on an aggregate and distributed across all disks in the aggregate. Each aggregate can contain and usually has multiple FlexVol volumes. ONTAP during data optimization process including the &quot;Tetris&quot; which finishes with Consistency Points (see NVRAM) is programmed to evenly distribute data blocks as much as possible in each FlexVol volume across all disks in aggregate so each FlexVol could potentially use all available performance of all the data disks in the aggregate. With the approach of even data block distribution across all the data disks in an aggregate, performance throttling for a FlexVol could be done dynamically with storage QoS and does not require dedicated aggregates or RAID groups for each FlexVol to guarantee performance and provide the unused performance to a FlexVol volume which requires it. Each FlexVol could be configured as thick or thin provisioned space and later could be changed on the fly any time. Block device access with storage area network (SAN) protocols such as iSCSI, Fibre Channel (FC), and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) is done with LUN emulation similar to Loop device technique on top of a FlexVol volume; thus each LUN on WAFL file system appears as a file, yet have additional properties required for block devices. LUNs can also be configured as thick or thin provisioned and can be changed later on the fly. Due to WAFL architecture, FlexVols and LUNs can increase or decrease configured space usage on the fly. If a FlexVol contains data, internal space can be decreased no less than used space. Even though LUN size with data on it could be decreased on WAFL file system, ONTAP has no knowledge about upper-level block structure due to SAN architecture so it could truncate data and damage the file system on that LUN, so the host needs to migrate the blocks containing the data into a new LUN boundary to prevent data loss. Each FlexVol can have its own QoS, FlashPool, FlasCache or FabricPool policies.

If two FlexVol volumes are created, each on two aggregates and those aggregates owned by two different controllers, and the system administrator needs to use space from these volumes through a NAS protocol. Then they would create two file shares, one on each volume. In this case, the administrator will most probably even create different IP addresses; each will be used to access a dedicated file share. Each volume will have a single write waffinity, and there will be two buckets of space. Though even if two volumes reside on a single controller, and for example on a single aggregate (thus if the second aggregate exists, it will not be used in this case) and both volumes will be accessed through a single IP address, there will still be two write affinities, one on each volume and there always will be two separate buckets of space. Therefore, the more volumes you have, the more write waffinities you&#x27;ll have (better parallelization and thus better CPU utilization), but then you&#x27;ll have multiple volumes (and multiple buckets for space thus multiple file shares).

===Plexes===

Similar to RAID 1, plexes in ONTAP systems can keep mirrored data in two places, but while conventional RAID-1 must exist within the bounds of one storage system, two plexes could be distributed between two storage systems. Each aggregate consists of one or two plexes. Conventional HA storage systems have only one plex for each aggregate, while SyncMirror local or MetroCluster configurations can have two plexes for each aggregate. On the other hand, each plex includes underlying storage space from one or more NetApp RAID groups or LUNs from third-party storage systems (see FlexArray) in a single plex similarly to RAID 0. If an aggregate consists of two plexes, one plex is considered a master and second as a slave; slaves must consist of exactly the same RAID configuration and drives. For example, if we have an aggregate consisting of two plexes where the master plex consists of 21 data and 3 1.8 TB SAS parity drives in RAID-TEC, then the slave plex must consist of 21 data and 3 1.8 TB SAS parity drives in RAID-TEC. The second example, if we have an aggregate consisted of two plexes where master plex consists of one RAID 17 data and 3 parity SAS drives 1.8 TB configured as RAID-TEC and second RAID in the master plex is RAID-DP with 2 data and 2 parity SSD 960 GB. The second plex must have the same configuration: one RAID 17 data and 3 parity SAS drives 1.8 TB configured as RAID-TEC, and the second RAID in the slave plex is RAID-DP with 2 data and 2 parity SSD 960 GB.
MetroCluster configurations use SyncMirror technology for synchronous data replication. There are two SyncMirror options: MetroCluster and Local SyncMirror, both using the same plex technique for synchronous replication of data between two plexes. Local SyncMirror creates both plexes in a single controller and is often used for additional security to prevent failure for an entire disk shelf in a storage system. MetroCluster allows data to be replicated between two storage systems. Each storage system could consist of one controller or be configured as an HA pair with two controllers. In a single HA pair, it is possible to have two controllers in separate chassis and distance from each other could be tens of meters, while in MetroCluster configuration distance could be up to 300 km.

===Nonvolatile memory===

Like many competitors, NetApp ONTAP systems utilizing memory as a much faster storage medium for accepting and caching data from hosts and, most importantly, for data optimization before writes which greatly improves the performance of such storage systems. While competitors widely using non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) to preserve data in it during unexpected events like a reboot for both write caching and data optimization, NetApp ONTAP systems using ordinary random-access memory (RAM) for data optimization and dedicated NVRAM or NVDIMM for logging of initial data in an unchanged state as they came from hosts similarly as transaction logging done in Relational databases. So in case of disaster, naturally, RAM will be automatically cleared after reboot, and data stored in non-volatile memory in the form of logs called &quot;NVLOGs&quot; will survive after reboot and will be used for restore consistency. All changes and optimizations in ONTAP systems done only in RAM, which helps to reduce the size of non-volatile memory for ONTAP systems. After optimizations data from hosts structured in Tetris-like manner, optimized and prepared with passing few stages (i.e., WAFL and RAID) to be written in underlying disks in RAID groups on the aggregate where data are going to be stored. After optimizations, data is going to be sequentially written on disks as part of the Consistency Point (CP) transaction. Data written to aggregates will contain necessary WAFL metadata and RAID parity so no additional read from data disks, calculate and write to parity disks operations will occur as with traditional RAID-6 and RAID-4 groups. CP at first creating system snapshot on an aggregate where data are going to be written, then optimized and prepared data from RAM written sequentially as a single transaction to the aggregate, if it fails, the whole transaction fails in case of a sudden reboot which allows WAFL file system always to be consistent. In case of successful CP transaction new active file system point is propagated and corresponding NVLOGs cleared. All data are always going to be written to a new place, and no rewrites can occur. Data blocks deleted by hosts marked as free so they could be used later on next CP cycles and the system will not run out of space with the always-write-new-data-to-new-place policy of WAFL. Only NVLOGs in HA storage systems is replicated synchronously between two controllers for HA storage system failover capability, which helps to reduce overall system memory protection overheads. In a storage system with two controllers in HA configuration or MetroCluster with one controller on each site, each of the two controllers divides its own non-volatile memory into two pieces: local and its partner. In MetroCluster configuration with four nodes, each non-volatile memory divided into next pieces: local, local partner&#x27;s and remote partner&#x27;s.

Starting with the All-Flash FAS A800 system, NetApp replaced the NVRAM PCI module with NVDIMMs connected to the memory bus, increasing the performance.

<text>Stobswell is an area of Dundee, Scotland with a population of approximately 10,000. It was originally a small hamlet outside the city until the Industrial Revolution caused the growth of Dundee. The area is by and large a residential area. Schools in the area are Morgan Academy Secondary School, Glebelands Primary School and Clepington Primary School. The area is home to the Dundee International Sports Centre (D.I.S.C.).

==History==
The area developed around a well which serviced the nearby farmhouses of Janefield and Maryfield. The name &quot;Stob&quot; derives from the Scots word for a post indicating to travellers that it was to Dundee. Housing was developed in the area by the city&#x27;s &quot;jute barons&quot; in the 19th century to accommodate workers in the textile mills in the area and the city. In 1856, the East Dundee Poorhouse was built on a two-acre (8,000 m2) site in the area. After the inception of the National Health Service, the poorhouse was renamed &quot;The Rowans&quot; and later became a hospital and care-home for the elderly. The building now known as Morgan Academy opened in 1868 as Morgan Hospital, a charitable institution providing accommodation and education for &quot;sons of tradesmen and persons of the working class whose parents stand in the need of assistance&quot;. The present Stobswell Church (itself a union of four local churches) was built in 1874. It is the local Church of Scotland parish church.

==Education==
Schools in the area are Morgan Academy, Glebelands Primary School and Clepington Primary School. The Melrose Campus of Dundee College was also located in the area.

==Sports and recreation==
The area is home to the Dundee International Sports Centre (D.I.S.C.), which staged the European Hockey Championships in 1998. The local Rugby club is Stobswell R.F.C. and play at the McTaggart Sports Centre, Old Glamis Road.

The local community also run a number of events. The longest-established is the annual Celebration in the Park, which brings thousands to Baxter Park in August. It also includes a winter Doggyfest, the week-long Stobfest in May, and an annual motor show held by Dundee Museum of Transport.

==Notable residents==
* In the summer of 1812, Mary Shelley lived in the area with William Baxter, an acquaintance of her family. She developed a friendship with Baxter&#x27;s two daughters Christina and Isabel. The dunes, beach, and barren hills near Dundee inspired Mary, and she would describe this scenery in her novella Mathilda (written in 1819-1820).
* Doug Cowie Scottish International football player. Dundee F.C. and Scotland 
* Former Leeds United and Scotland football player, Peter Lorimer scored 176 goals in one season for Stobswell School.
* Billy Mackenzie singer with The Associates

<doc id="1247872" wikidata="Q7177425" url="?curid=1247872" title="Peter U. Murphey">
<text>Peter Umstead Murphey (born July 20, 1810, in Caswell County, North Carolina; died 1876) was a former officer of the United States Navy who joined the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War. He was the son of Archibald DeBow Murphey and Jane Armistead Murphey.

==Biography==
Murphey (sometimes incorrectly spelled Murphy) was born in Caswell County, North Carolina, the son of State Senator Archibald Debow Murphey and Jane Debow. Appointed from that state as a United States Navy midshipman on May 12, 1834, he was promoted to passed midshipman on July 8, 1839, and to the rank of lieutenant on May 29, 1846. Murphey resigned from the U.S. Navy, in which he served as an instructor at the Norfolk Military Academy in Norfolk, Va., in April 1861.

In April 1861 he joined the Virginia State Navy, and was appointed commander of the steam tug &quot;Arrow&quot; on picket duty in the vicinity of Craney Island. Murphey became a Confederate States Navy officer on 10 June 1861, with the rank of first lieutenant. After working on naval defenses in Virginia and North Carolina, he served at the Gosport Navy Yard in 1861–62, and then commanded the gunboat in the Mobile Squadron from March 7, 1862.

Murphey assumed command of the gunboat in July 1862, and was wounded when &quot;Selma&quot; was captured in the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864, by a U.S. Navy squadron headed by Admiral David Farragut. Murphey, who was fondly referred to by his crew and fellow officers as &quot;Captain Pat&quot;, was held as a prisoner of war at Fort Warren, until exchanged at Cox Wharf, Virginia, on October 18, 1864. He surrendered to Union forces on May 4, 1865, and was paroled on May 10, 1865.

<text>Michael Shayne Graham (born December 9, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a placekicker for 15 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Virginia Tech Hokies. He made his professional debut in May 2000 with the Richmond Speed of the Arena Football League&#x27;s now-defunct developmental league, AF2.

His first NFL contract was with the New Orleans Saints where he signed as an undrafted free agent in 2000. A journeyman most of his career, he played for 14 different NFL franchises over 9 seasons, excluding the 7 seasons he spent with the Cincinnati Bengals. With the Bengals, he made the Pro Bowl in 2005. In the latter part of his career, he was signed as an injury replacement or to provide competition during training camps for a number of teams.

In 2018, Graham was hired as a special teams intern at Michigan State University.

==Early life==
Graham attended Pulaski County High School in Dublin, Virginia, graduating in 1996. He holds many of the school&#x27;s kicking records including most field goals in career (28, from 1992 to 1995), most field goals in a season (15, 1995), and longest field goal, a 54-yarder against Anacostia in 1995.

==College career==
Graham played college football at Virginia Tech and was named to the first-team All-Big East Conference in all four seasons. In 1999, as a senior, Graham earned Big East Special Teams Player of the Year honors after leading the conference and breaking the school&#x27;s single-season scoring record with 107 points on 56-of-57 extra points and 17-of-22 field goals. He was 68-of-93 (73.1%) in field goals for his Virginia Tech career and set a Virginia Tech and Big East record with 97 consecutive successful extra points. He left Virginia Tech as the all-time scoring leader in school history and Big East history with 371 points. His contributions at Tech led to his induction in the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==

===Richmond Speed===
Following a tryout with the Cleveland Browns, it was announced in May 2000, that Graham would play in two games for the Richmond Speed of the AF2, and that he would use the time to practice for a future NFL tryout with the Tennessee Titans. As it turned out Graham played in only one game for the Speed, a 60 - 21 loss against the Arkansas Twisters on May 26, 2000. During the game, he missed two field goals, from 36 and 44-yards, and two of three extra points. After the game, Graham told the &quot;Roanoke Times&quot;: &quot;It was a big adjustment. In the arena game, the holder puts the ball down, then the kicker starts forward. I&#x27;ve always been accustomed to starting with the snap. My rhythm was all messed up.&quot; Graham left the team and was replaced by special teams coach Dave DeArmas, who unretired and played in the following week&#x27;s game against the Jacksonville Tomcats.

===New Orleans Saints (first stint)===
After going undrafted in the 2000 NFL draft, Graham signed with the New Orleans Saints on June 30, 2000. Graham was 1-for-1 on extra points and did not attempt a field goal during the preseason. He was waived on August 22.

===Seattle Seahawks===
Graham was signed by the Seattle Seahawks on April 27, 2001. He was 6-for-6 on extra points in the preseason but had his only field goal attempt blocked. He was waived on September 2. On October 30, Graham was invited back for a tryout after kicker Rian Lindell missed two field goals in a 24–20 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Graham did not get a contract and Lindell was retained as the Seahawks&#x27; kicker for the remainder of the 2001 season.

===Buffalo Bills===
The Buffalo Bills signed Graham on November 27, 2001, to replace rookie kicker Jake Arians; Arians had missed several key field goals and a crucial extra point over the course of the season. Graham played in the Bills&#x27; final six games, going 6-for-8 on field goals. He was released on April 23, 2002, and replaced by Mike Hollis.

===Seattle Seahawks (second stint)===
Graham was re-signed by the Seahawks on May 13, 2002. He began training camp with Seattle before being waived on August 13.

===Carolina Panthers===
Graham signed with the Carolina Panthers on September 28, 2002, after an injury to veteran John Kasay. Originally, Jon Hilbert replaced Kasay; however, after missing two field goals during the Week 3 game versus the Minnesota Vikings, Hilbert was replaced by Graham. The following week, in a game against the Green Bay Packers and after being on the team for only two days, Graham missed a 24-yard field goal inches to the right with 13 seconds remaining that would have tied the score. The Panthers ended up losing the game 17–14. In total he played in 11 of the Panthers&#x27; final 13 games, leading the team in scoring with 60 points. He was 13-of-18 on field goals and averaged 66 yards on his five kickoffs.

After spending the 2003 preseason with Carolina, Graham was waived on August 31, right before the season began.

===Cincinnati Bengals===
The Cincinnati Bengals claimed Graham off waivers on September 1, 2003. With the Bengals in 2003, Graham played in all 16 games and set a franchise record by making 88% (22-of-25) of his field goals.

In the following offseason, Graham was tendered a restricted free agent offer sheet by the Jacksonville Jaguars, but the offer was matched by the Bengals. In 2004, Graham narrowly missed matching his previous season&#x27;s accuracy mark, finishing the year 27-of-31 (87.1%) on field goals. In 2005, Graham made 28-of-32 field goals (87.5%), scored a franchise record 131 points, was selected to be the kicker for the AFC Pro Bowl squad, and helped the Bengals record their first winning season since 1990. Graham was the first kicker in franchise history ever to be selected to play in a Pro Bowl.

In 2005, Graham set the NFL record for tackles by a kicker with 11 combined (7 plus 4 assists.)

In 2006, Graham finished fourth in the AFC with 115 points and was 25-of-30 (83.3%) on field goals on the season.

In 2007, Graham missed his first field goal attempt of the season (a 53-yard attempt). But after that, he set a Bengals record by kicking 21 consecutive field goals without a miss over the season&#x27;s first 10 games. This included a game against the Baltimore Ravens where he set a franchise record by kicking 7 field goals (the second highest total in NFL history). His streak came to an end when he missed a 26-yard attempt in Week 12. By the end of the season, Graham set new franchise records for field goals in a season (31) and field goal percentage (91.2).

Graham finished the 2008 season with an 87.5 field goal percentage, going 21-of-24. In 2009, Graham went 23-of-28 in the regular season, his lowest percentage — 82.1 — in his Bengals career. In the Wild Card playoffs on January 9, 2010, Graham missed two field goals in the Bengals&#x27; 24–14 loss to the New York Jets, including a 28-yard attempt that would have cut the score to 24–17 late in the fourth quarter. After the game, Marvin Lewis commented on Graham&#x27;s missed field goals stating &quot;It is a shame, and it killed us. Unfortunately kicking is mostly a one-man operation. I know Shayne feels worse about it than anyone. Those points obviously make a big difference.&quot;

He was not re-signed as an unrestricted free agent following the 2009 season.

===Baltimore Ravens (first stint)===
In June 2010, Graham signed a 1-year-deal with the Baltimore Ravens worth up to $2.5 million. Graham was released during final cuts before the season started in favor of Billy Cundiff.

===New York Giants===
On October 16, 2010, the New York Giants signed Graham due to an injury to kicker Lawrence Tynes. Graham only played in one game for the Giants and did not attempt a field goal. He did, however, make all four of his extra point attempts. On October 18, just two days after being signed, the Giants released Graham.

===New England Patriots===
On November 10, 2010, the New England Patriots signed Graham after an injury to kicker Stephen Gostkowski. In his first game, in Week 10 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Graham was 2-for-2 on field goals but missed one of four extra point attempts on the night. In eight games, Graham finished the 2010 season 12-for-12 on field goals, and 35-for-37 on extra points.
In the playoffs, Graham was 2-for-2 in the Patriots&#x27; loss to the New York Jets.

===Washington Redskins===
On August 1, 2011, the Washington Redskins signed Graham to provide training camp competition for Graham Gano. After missing two field goals in a pre-season game, Graham was released.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On August 23, 2011, the Dallas Cowboys signed Graham due to a hip injury to David Buehler, but did not make the roster after being passed on the depth chart by rookie Dan Bailey.

===Miami Dolphins===
The Miami Dolphins signed Graham on November 19, 2011, after an injury to Dan Carpenter. Graham was waived November 30.

===Baltimore Ravens (second stint)===
The Baltimore Ravens signed Graham on December 21, 2011, to back up Billy Cundiff, who had a calf injury throughout most of December. He made both field goal attempts and both extra point attempts in his short stint with the team. Graham was released on January 3.

===Houston Texans===
The Texans signed Graham on May 7, 2012, to battle rookie Randy Bullock for the position. In August, Graham was named the team&#x27;s kicker after Bullock went on injured reserve. On January 13, 2013, Graham set his career longest field goal after he made a 55-yard field goal against the New England Patriots in the divisional round of the playoffs.

===Cleveland Browns===
On April 15, 2013, the Cleveland Browns signed Graham to replace Phil Dawson who left as a free agent. On August 31, he was surprisingly released, even after making all of his pre-season attempts, leaving the Browns with no kicker on the roster days before the season began.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
On September 9, 2013, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Graham due to a hamstring injury to Shaun Suisham. Graham was on the roster for one game, but was inactive due to Suisham&#x27;s ability to play through his injury. Since he was not needed, Graham was released by the Steelers on September 17.

===New Orleans Saints (second stint)===
Graham was re-signed by the New Orleans Saints on December 17, 2013, to replace Garrett Hartley. Hartley had been cut from the Saints after he had struggled in the 2012 and 2013 seasons and the final straw came when he missed two close range field goals in a game against the St. Louis Rams. On January 4, 2014, Graham went 4-for-4 including a 32-yard game winner as time expired to propel the Saints past the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round of the 2014 playoffs. However, the following week during the divisional round game he missed two field goals versus the Seattle Seahawks. On his first miss, from 45 yards, holder (and backup quarterback) Luke McCown had the laces facing the wrong way. Strong winds also contributed to his poor performance.

On February 14, 2014, the Saints re-signed Graham to a new one-year contract with a base salary of $955,000. In a surprise move, Graham along with kicker Derek Dimke were released as part of the final roster cuts on August 30, 2014, leaving the Saints with no kickers on their roster after the reduction to 53-players. A few days later on September 2, it was announced that the Saints had waived quarterback Ryan Griffin to make room for the re-signing of Graham to their 53-man roster.

Graham was selected as NFC special teams player of the month for October 2014, for making all nine field goals and all nine extra points he tried during the month. He also scored 14 points during the October 26, 2014 victory over the Green Bay Packers.

After Graham missed a 42-yard field goal during the Saints&#x27; loss to the Carolina Panthers on December 7, 2014, the Saints tried out kickers Garrett Hartley, Derek Dimke and Zach Hocker on December 10, 2014. However, in the end the Saints decided to stick with Graham as their kicker.

On February 12, 2015, Graham was re-signed to a one-year contract with the Saints. He was released on May 19.

===Atlanta Falcons===
On November 26, 2015, Graham signed with the Atlanta Falcons as a replacement kicker, after Matt Bryant injured his leg. On August 20, 2016, Graham was re-signed by the Falcons. On September 3, Graham was released by the Falcons.

On February 6, 2017, Graham announced his retirement from the NFL at the age of 39 to pursue jobs as a special teams coach. Graham signed an unofficial ceremonial contract on February 21, to retire as a Bengal.

<text>The sterile fungi, or &quot;mycelia sterilia&quot;, are a group of fungi that do not produce any known spores, either sexual or asexual. This is considered a form group, not a taxonomic division, and is used as a matter of convenience only, as various isolates within such morphotypes could include distantly related taxa or different morphotypes of the same species, leading to incorrect identifications. Because these fungi do not produce spores, it is impossible to use traditional methods of morphological comparison to classify them. However, molecular techniques can be applied to determine their evolutionary history, with ITS testing being the preferred method.According to one study, approximately 42% of fluids collected from broncho-alveolar lavage have had sterile mycelium observed in them.

<text>Milo ( ; stylised as MILO) is a chocolate-flavoured malted powder product produced by Nestlé, typically mixed with milk, hot water, or both, to produce a beverage. It was originally developed in Australia by Thomas Mayne (1901–1995) in 1934.

Most commonly sold as a powder in a green can, often depicting various sporting activities like badminton or football, Milo is available as a premixed beverage in some countries and has been subsequently developed into a snack bar, breakfast cereal and protein granola. Its composition and taste differ from country to country.

Milo maintains significant popularity in a diverse range of countries throughout the world, particularly in Australasia, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

== History ==

In 1934, Australian industrial chemist and inventor Thomas Mayne, who was working at Nestlé, developed &quot;Milo&quot; and launched it at the Sydney Royal Easter Show. Mayne came up with his formula for Milo combining malt extract (made from malted barley), full cream milk powder, cocoa, sugar, mineral salts, iron and vitamins A, D and B1, in an attempt &quot;to develop a completely balanced food drink which contained all the necessary proteins and minerals&quot;. It was intended to help children to obtain enough nutrients in their diet.

Nestlé, which had taken ownership of a milk-processing plant in Smithtown, New South Wales, in 1921, started producing the product not long after the show. The name was derived from the famous ancient Greek athlete Milo of Croton, after his legendary strength. The product was even noted as &quot;tonic food&quot;.

== Manufacture ==

Milo is manufactured by evaporating the water content from a thick syrup at reduced pressure, using a vacuum dryer to reduce the mix to granularform. The thick opaque syrup is obtained from malted wheat or barley sourced from companies that produce these raw products.

Milo&#x27;s composition and taste differ in some countries due to logistics limitations and personal preferences among different regions.

, the Smithtown factory, which produces the product for Australia and New Zealand, produces more than 13,000 tonnes of Milo a year. Nestlé Singapore states that Milo is produced locally at its factory in Jurong. Milo in Japan is manufactured using ingredients imported from Singapore.

== Nutritional information ==
The recipe for the standard product has remained almost exactly the same since its creation in 1934, the only variation being in the added minerals and vitamins.

Standard Milo consists of four main ingredients: malted barley, milk powder, sugar and cocoa. It contains 1,680 kJ (402 kilocalories) in every 100 g of the powder, mostly from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates can be used for energy by the body, which is the basis of Milo being marketed as an energy drink. Most of the carbohydrate content is sugar. The New Zealand version of Milo is 46 percent sugar.

Milo dissolved in water has a glycemic index (GI) of 55. However, milk has a much lower GI of 30 to 33, so mixing a very small amount of Milo into a mug of milk yields an overall GI closer to 33, however adding a lot of Milo into a mug of milk, yields an overall GI that is closer to 55.

Milo is high in calcium, iron and the vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12. Milo is advertised as containing &quot;Actigen-E&quot; which is Nestlé&#x27;s trademarked name for the vitamins in the Milo recipe. It also contains some theobromine, a xanthine alkaloid similar to caffeine, which is present in the cocoa used in the product.

A study conducted in Malaysia by the &#x27;Nutrition Society of Malaysia&#x27; suggested that Milo and similar products made children who consumed them &quot;more likely to be physically active and spend less time in front of a computer or television&quot;. A 2017 &quot;New York Times&quot; article found that Nestlé had been financing the society and vetting the articles before publication, leading to questions of scientific impartiality. The high concentration of sugar, and the presence of maltodextrin, also raised whether the product should be marketed as a health product.

== Versions ==
Since 2017, Nestle Philippines has produced Milo using its &quot;protomalt&quot; formulation. The protomalt is composed of carbohydrates derived from barley and cassava.

In Australia, a version of Milo called Milo B-Smart was released in 2008, which had a finer texture, added B vitamins and iodine, and a different taste from the original Milo formula, and was marketed as a health food for children. However, , this product is no longer available. A higher malt content form also existed in Australia and was marketed in brown and maroon coloured cans. Nestlé stopped advertising this higher malt form on their Australian products website sometime between March and April 2015.

, three other varieties are manufactured at the Australian plant: high protein, reduced sugar and a plant-based version.

As of 2021, Nestlé has launched dairy-free plant-based versions of Milo and other drinks under the brand. The new version of these drinks contain almond and soy milk, the two core ingredients cocoa and malt remain the same.

==Consumption==
Milo is typically mixed with milk, hot water, or both, to produce a beverage.

===Australia and New Zealand===
Traditionally in Australia and New Zealand, Milo is served mixed with either hot or cold milk, or sprinkled on top.

===Asia===

Milo manufactured outside Australia is customised for local methods of preparation. In Malaysia, as well as Brunei and some other parts of Asia, Milo with ice added is known as &quot;Iced Milo&quot;, &quot;Milo Ais&quot; in Malaysian, or &quot;Es Milo&quot; in Indonesian (alternatively, &quot;bing&quot; or &quot;peng&quot;, meaning ice in Cantonese and Hokkien respectively). Iced Milo is even available at fast food restaurants such as KFC and McDonald&#x27;s.

In Malaysia, Milo is also served locally in kopitiams and mamak stalls in versions such as &quot;Milo Dinosaur&quot; (a cup of Milo with an extra heaped spoonfuls worth of undissolved Milo powder added on top of it), &quot;Milo Godzilla&quot; (a cup of Milo with ice cream and/or topped with whipped cream) &quot;Neslo&quot; (combined with Nescafé powdered coffee) and &quot;Milo Mangkuk&quot; (Iced Milo that is served with shaved ice inside a plastic bowl). The Milo powder is also usually used in the making of Batik cake. In Hong Kong, Milo is served in Cha chaan teng.

In Malaysia, Milo is also sometimes sprinkled on ice cream or breakfast cereals, or mixed with milk into a paste and spread on bread. Milo can be used as an ingredient in roti canai, where it is usually called &quot;roti Milo&quot;.

At the present time , Malaysia has the world&#x27;s highest per capita consumption of Milo, Singapore coming second.

== Marketing ==

Apart from Australia, Milo is popular in many countries and regions, including New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Pakistan, Philippines, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Thailand, Japan, Jamaica, Guyana, Chile, Colombia, and countries in Southern Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, West Africa. In Australia and most other countries, the packaging is a green can and depicts people playing various sports. 

In Australia, the MILO in2CRICKET and MILO T20 Blast programs, operated in most areas by volunteers, teach children age 5–12 how to play the game of cricket. In the 2016–2017 season, over 78,000 children participated in the programs.

Milo is very popular in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, where the brand name is synonymous with chocolate flavoured drinks: Milo has a 90% market share in Malaysia, and Malaysians were said to be the world&#x27;s largest consumers of Milo. In Malaysia and Singapore, specialised trucks or vans, affectionately called Milo vans, serving up to three thousand cup of the drink are commonly seen at sports and community events and schools. 

In Peru, during the 1970s military dictatorship, Milo labels displayed Peruvian motifs, such as photos and pictures of Peruvian towns, history, crops, fruits, animals, plants, as an educational aid. After 1980, when the military left power, sports predominated on the labels.

Milo is sold by Nestlé in Canada at all major food retailers. Although Milo has been available since the 1970s, a Canadian-specific flavour launched within the last decade that dissolves more quickly but maintains the sweet malt flavour profile. It competes with the British brand Ovaltine.

Aside from the International section of specific grocery stores and certain Asian grocery stores, Nestlé does not market Milo in the United States. In 2017 Colombian-manufactured Milo started appearing on shelves in supermarkets in the United States such as Walmart.

It can also be found in the United Kingdom in some Sainsbury&#x27;s and Tesco supermarkets, which import it from Kenya and South Africa. Asian food specialists also stock it. Ovaltine is more popular with UK consumers.

In Ireland, it can be found in many Asian or African stores. Typically they will stock Kenyan or Filipino Milo.

In China, it is commonly sold in Western supermarkets, but also smaller convenience stores. Usually packaged in a 240gram flexible foil pouch, single-drink packets can also be purchased. The Milo itself contains more milk solids than the Australian Milo.

In the past, it was available in Portugal and Brazil. Nestlé Brazil discontinued production of Milo in Brazil, to focus on the much-popular domestic brands Nescau and Nesquik. The Chilean version of Milo is still in production and is identical in taste and texture to the one that was once produced in Brazil.

In May 2013, more than 20 years out of the Portuguese market, Nestlé reintroduced the brand, aiming at the high-end market.

In the Philippines, Nestlé partnered with the Department of Education in 2017, in a marketing response to the &quot;energy gap&quot; within school-aged children whose athletic and academic performance were impacted due to low energy. This raised the ethical question of advertising to children. 

== Derivative products ==

Milo was available as a snack in cube form in Nigeria, Ghana and Dubai in 1975.

The Milo chocolate bar was a brand of brownie, caramel, Milo and chocolate-covered candy bars, produced by Nestlé for sale in Australia and available in 2006. It included ingredients of Milo powder. It claimed to be the only milk chocolate with &quot;choco malt&quot; and &quot;all natural ingredients including cocoa, milk and malt&quot;. The chocolate bar was discontinued in Australia in 2003, replaced with an &quot;energy food bar&quot;, which is no longer available either. Two varieties of Milo snack bars can be bought in packs of six.

As of 2006, there was also Milo cereal (described as &quot;cornflakes with a Milo coating&quot;), Milo smoothies, Milo mousse, and Milo ice-cream (a vanilla ice-cream coated with hard Milo/chocolate shell).

In South Africa, Milo Cereal and Milo Chocolate bars are available and sold in most supermarkets. 

Milo nuggets have been available since 1994 in Southeast Asia and Colombia. Milo cereal balls and a range of other derivative products are marketed by Tesco in Malaysia.

<text>APACHE II (&quot;Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II&quot;) is a severity-of-disease classification system, one of several ICU scoring systems. It is applied within 24 hours of admission of a patient to an intensive care unit (ICU): an integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death. The first APACHE model was presented by Knaus et al. in 1981.

==Application==
APACHE II was designed to measure the severity of disease for adult patients admitted to intensive care units. It has not been validated for use in children or young people aged under 16.

This scoring system is used in many ways which include:

# Some procedures or some medicine is only given to patients with a certain APACHE II score
# APACHE II score can be used to describe the morbidity of a patient when comparing the outcome with other patients.
# Predicted mortalities are averaged for groups of patients in order to specify the group&#x27;s morbidity.

Even though newer scoring systems, such as APACHE III, have replaced APACHE II in many places, APACHE II continues to be used extensively because so much documentation is based on it.

==Calculation==

The point score is calculated from 12 admission physiologic variables comprising the Acute Physiology Score, the patient&#x27;s age, and chronic health status:

; A. Acute Physiology Score (measured within 24 hours of admission)
# AaDO2 or PaO2 (for FiO2≥0.5 or &lt;0.5, respectively)
# body temperature (rectal)
# mean arterial pressure
# blood pH 
# heart rate
# respiratory rate
# serum sodium
# serum potassium 
# creatinine (Double point score for acute renal failure)
# hematocrit
# white blood cell count
# Glasgow Coma Scale (15 minus actual GCS)

; B. Age points
; C. Chronic health points

If the patient has a history of severe organ system insufficiency (i.e. liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, NYHA class IV heart failure, severe respiratory disease, dialysis dependent) or is immunocompromised (i.e. due to chemotherapy, radiation, high dose steroid therapy, or advanced leukemia, lymphoma or AIDS) assign points as follows:

:a. for nonoperative or emergency postoperative patients: 5 points
:b. for elective postoperative patients: 2 points

The method is optimized for manual calculation, by using integer values and limiting the number of options so that data fits on a single-sheet paper form.

The score is not recalculated during the stay. It is by definition an admission score. If a patient is discharged from the ICU and subsequently readmitted, a new APACHE II score is calculated.

In the original research paper that described the APACHE II score, patient prognosis (specifically, predicted mortality) was computed based on the patient&#x27;s APACHE II score in combination with the principal diagnosis at admission.

==APACHE III==
A method to compute a refined score known as APACHE III was published in 1991.

The score was validated on the dataset from 17,440 adult medical/surgical intensive care unit (ICU) admissions at 40 US hospitals.

The prognostic system of APACHE III has two options:
*APACHE III Score
: Provides an initial risk classification of severely ill hospitalized patients in defined groups.
*APACHE III predictive equation
: Adds additional variables to the APACHE III Score including the primary reason for ICU admission (from a reference list of 212 conditions classified according to etiology, major organ involved, and distinction between surgical/medical categories); age, sex, race and preexisting comorbidities; and location prior to ICU admission (operating room, recovery or emergency department, transfer or readmission from another hospital or ICU).

When possible, the time between the patient&#x27;s arrival at the hospital and their ICU admission is recorded.

To evaluate the severity of disease 20 physiologic variables are measured, compared to 12 variables for APACHE II.

APACHE III scores range from 0 to 299.

==APACHE IV==
APACHE IV, published in 2006, is the latest version. The model was developed using data from 104 intensive care units (ICUs) in 45 U.S. hospitals and could be recommended to use in U.S. ICUs.

<text>GOMS is a specialized human information processor model for human-computer interaction observation that describes a user&#x27;s cognitive structure on four components. In the book &quot;The Psychology of Human Computer Interaction&quot;, written in 1983 by Stuart K. Card, Thomas P. Moran and Allen Newell, the authors introduce: &quot;a set of Goals, a set of Operators, a set of Methods for achieving the goals, and a set of Selection rules for choosing among competing methods for goals.&quot;
GOMS is a widely used method by usability specialists for computer system designers because it produces quantitative and qualitative predictions of how people will use a proposed system.

==Overview==

A GOMS model is composed of methods that are used to achieve specific goals. These methods are then composed of operators at the lowest level. The operators are specific steps that a user performs and are assigned a specific execution time. If a goal can be achieved by more than one method, then selection rules are used to determine the method.

* Goals are symbolic structures that define a state of affairs to be achieved and determinate a set of possible methods by which it may be accomplished
* Operators are elementary perceptual, motor or cognitive acts, whose execution is necessary to change any aspect of the user&#x27;s mental state or to affect the task environment
* Methods describe a procedure for accomplishing a goal
* Selection Rules are needed when a goal is attempted, there may be more than one method available to the user to accomplish it.

There are several different GOMS variations which allow for different aspects of an interface to be accurately studied and predicted. For all of the variants, the definitions of the major concepts are the same. There is some flexibility for the designer&#x27;s/analyst&#x27;s definition of all of the entities. For instance, an operator in one method may be a goal in a different method. The level of granularity is adjusted to capture what the particular evaluator is examining.
For a simple applied example see CMN-GOMS.

== Qualification ==

===Advantages ===

The GOMS approach to user modeling has strengths and weaknesses.
While it is not necessarily the most accurate method to measure human-computer interface interaction, it does allow visibility of all procedural knowledge. With GOMS, an analyst can easily estimate a particular interaction and calculate it quickly and easily. This is only possible if the average Methods-Time Measurement data for each specific task has previously been measured experimentally to a high degree of accuracy.

===Disadvantages ===

GOMS only applies to skilled users. It does not work for beginners or intermediates for errors may occur which can alter the data.
Also the model doesn&#x27;t apply to learning the system or a user using the system after a longer time of not using it.
Another big disadvantage is the lack of account for errors, even skilled users make errors but GOMS does not account for errors.
Mental workload is not addressed in the model, making this an unpredictable variable. The same applies to fatigue.
GOMS only addresses the usability of a task on a system, it does not address its functionality.

User personalities, habits or physical restrictions (for example disabilities) are not accounted for in any of the GOMS models. All users are assumed to be exactly the same. Recently some extensions of GOMS were developed, that allow to formulate GOMS models describing the interaction behavior of disabled users.

==Variations==

Basically there are five different GOMS models: the Keystroke-Level Model, CMN-GOMS, NGOMSL, CPM-GOMS, and SGOMS.
Each model has a different complexity and varies in activities.

===KLM===

The Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) is the first and simplest GOMS technique Stuart Card, Thomas P. Moran and Allen Newell created.
Estimating an execution time for a task is done by listing the sequence of operators and then totaling the execution times for the individual operators. 
With KLM the analyst must specify the method used to accomplish each particular task instance. 
Furthermore, the specified methods are limited to being in sequence form and containing only keystroke-level primitive operators. 
The biggest difference between GOMS and KLM is how time is assigned to cognitive and perceptual operators when it comes to execution time predictions.
Another major difference is that the goal-hierarchy is explicit in GOMS while it was implicit in the KLM.
The nature of unobservable operators is another important difference. KLM has a single M operator that precedes each cognitive unit of action. In contrast, GOMS assigns no time to such cognitive overhead. But both models include M-like operators for substantial time-consuming mental actions such as locating information on the screen and verifying entries.
Both methods assign roughly the same time to unobservable perceptual and cognitive activities.
Also they make different assumptions about unobservable cognitive and perceptual operators and so distribute the time in different ways.
KLM&#x27;s execution part is described in four physical-motor operators:

* K keystroking/ keypressing
* P pointing with a mouse to a target
* H homing the hand on the keyboard
* D drawing a line segment on a grid

One mental operator M that stands for the time a user has to mentally prepare themselves to do an action, and a system response operator R in with the user has to wait for the system.
Execution time is the sum of the times spent executing the different operator types:

:&quot;T&quot;execute = &quot;T&quot;K + &quot;T&quot;P + &quot;T&quot;H + &quot;T&quot;D + &quot;T&quot;M + &quot;T&quot;R.

Each of these operators has an estimate of execution time, either a single value or a parameterized estimate.

==== Touch Level Model (TLM) ====
GOMS and it variants were designed for keyboard interfaces, nowadays a new type of interface is omnipresent.
This addition to the GOMS family, together with updates to the existing KLM operators, is called the Touch Level Model (TLM). 
Andrew D. Rice and Jonathan W. Lartigue propose this model for the used to model human task performance on a constrained input touchscreen device and, with proper benchmarking, accurately predict actual user performance.

The goal is to provide an instrument for quantitative analysis of touchscreen interfaces.

A number of operators are added for touchscreen interactions: 
; Distraction (X) : a multiplicative operator that is applied to other operators to model real world distractions
; Gesture (G) : gestures are conceptualized as specialized combinations of finger movements across the device&#x27;s screen
; Pinch (P) : refers to the common two-finger gesture 
; Zoom (Z) : the reverse application of the Pinch operator. value in MS = 200 Ms
; Initial Act (I) : KLM assumed the user is prepared to begin an action, touchscreen devices require users to prepare them for use (home button or password)
; Tap (T) : operator refers to the physical action of tapping an area on the touchscreen device in order to initiate some change or action
; Swipe (S) : usually a horizontally or vertically swipe like changing the page in a book. value in MS = 70 Ms
; Tilt (L(d)) : used with an interacting with a devices equipped with accelerometers.
; Rotate (O(d)) : gesture in which two or more fingers are placed on the screen and then rotated about a central point
; Drag (D) : similar to Swipe, Drag also involves tapping a location on the screen and then moving one or more fingers in specific direction

===CMN-GOMS===

CMN-GOMS is the original GOMS model proposed by Stuart Card, Thomas P. Moran and Allen Newell. 

CMN stands for Card, Moran and Newell and it takes the KLM as its basic and adds subgoals and selection rules.
This model can predict operator sequence as well as execution time. A CMN-GOMS model can be represented in program form, making it amenable to analysis as well as execution. 
CMN-GOMS has been used to model word processors and CAD systems for ergonomic design(see CAD).
The CMN method can predict the operator sequence and the execution time of a task on a quantitative level and can focus its attention on methods to accomplish goals on a qualitative level. 

In the example by Bonnie E. John and David E. Kieras a simple CMN-GOMS on editing a manuscript is shown.

Shown below is a simple copy and paste example.
===NGOMSL===

NGOMSL is a structured natural language notation for representing GOMS models and a procedure for constructing them. 
This program form provides predictions of operator sequences, execution time and time to learn methods.
An analyst constructs an NGOMSL model by performing a top-down, breadth-first expansion of the user&#x27;s top-level goals into methods, until the methods contain only primitive
operators, typically keystroke-level operators. 
This model explicitly represents the goal structure just like the CMN-GOMS and can so represent high-level goals. 

Shown below is a simple example.

===CPM-GOMS===

Bonnie E. John and David Kieras describe four different types of GOMS. CMN-GOMS, KLM and NGOMSL assume that all of the operators occur in sequence and do not contain operators that are below the activity level. 
CPM-GOMS being the fourth method uses operators at the level of Model Human Processor which assumes that operators of the cognitive processor, perceptual processor, and the motor processor can work in parallel to each other.
The most important point of CPM-GOMS is the ability to predict skilled behavior from its ability to model overlapping actions.

===SGOMS===

SGOMS stands for Sociotechnical GOMS and was created to allow GOMS to model work in complex sociotechnical systems. GOMS is meant to model an individual user, working in isolation, with no unexpected interruptions, similar to a Cognitive Psychology experiment. This level of analysis is sometimes referred to as &quot;microcognition&quot; to distinguish it from macrocognition, which refers to real world cognition. SGOMS is meant to expand the applicability of GOMS to the macro cognitive level of analysis. To do this, SGOMS adds a high level control structure to GOMS, called the &quot;planning unit&quot;. This allows GOMS to deal with unexpected interruptions.

A planning unit is a list of unit tasks. Planning units can be ordered (the unit tasks must be done in order) or situated (the unit tasks in the list are done as the situation demands). Consistent with CPM-GOMS, SGOMS assumes that the agent can monitor the situation in parallel in order to detect threats (neurophysiologically, this function is associated with the amygdala). Planning units can be interrupted and bookmarked so they can be resumed later. When a planning unit is interrupted the agent considers the situation and can resume the same planning unit or bookmark it and switch to a different planning unit. SGOMS does not prescribe how this choice is made but, if the decision is based on routine expertise, it can be included in the SGOMS model.

==Assumptions and errors==

===Importance of assumptions in GOMS analysis===

Accurate assumptions are vital in GOMS analysis. Before applying the average times for detailed functions, it is very important that an experimenter make sure he or she has accounted for as many variables as possible by using assumptions. Experimenters should design their GOMS analysis for the users who will most likely be using the system which is being analyzed. Consider, for example, an experimenter wishes to determine how long it will take an F22 Raptor pilot to interact with an interface he or she has used for years. It can probably be assumed that the pilot has outstanding vision and is in good physical health. In addition, it can be assumed that the pilot can interact with the interface quickly because of the vast hours of simulation and previous use he or she has endured. All things considered, it is fair to use fastman times in this situation. Contrarily, consider an 80-year-old person with no flight experience attempting to interact with the same F22 Raptor interface. It is fair to say that the two people would have much different skill sets and those skill sets should be accounted for subjectively.

===Accounting for errors===
The only way to account for errors in GOMS analysis is to predict where the errors are most likely to occur and measure the time it would take to correct the predicted errors. For example, assume an experimenter thought that in typing the word &quot;the&quot; it was likely that a subject would instead incorrectly type &quot;&quot;. The experimenter would calculate the time it takes to type the incorrect word, the time it takes to recognize that a mistake has been made, and the time it takes to correct the recognized error.

==Applications of GOMS==

=== Workstation efficiency ===
A successful implementation of CPM-GOMS was in &quot;Project Ernestine&quot; held by New England Telephone. New ergonomically designed workstations were compared to old workstations in terms of improvement in telephone operators&#x27; performance. CPM-GOMS analysis estimated a 3% decrease in productivity. Over the four-month trial 78,240 calls were analysed and it was concluded that the new workstations produced an actual 4% decrease in productivity. As the proposed workstation required less keystrokes than the original it was not clear from the time trials why the decrease occurred. However CPM-GOMS analysis made it apparent that the problem was that the new workstations did not utilize the workers&#x27; slack time. Not only did CPM-GOMS give a close estimate, but it provided more information of the situation.

=== CAD ===

GOMS models were employed in the redesign of a CAD (computer-aided design) system for industrial ergonomics.
An applied GOMS model shows where the interface needs to be redesigned, as well as provides an evaluation of design concepts and ideas. 
In Richard Gong&#x27;s example, when GOMS revealed a frequent goal supported by a very inefficient method, he changed the method to a more efficient one. 
If GOMS showed that there were goals not supported by any method at all, then new methods were added. 
GOMS also revealed where similar goals are supported by inconsistent methods, a situation in which users are likely to have problems remembering what to do, and showed how to make the methods consistent.

<text>Robert Samuel Morris (born January 18, 1975) is an American former professional football player who spent his entire eight-year career as a linebacker for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the BYU Cougars and was selected by the Colts in the first round (28th overall) of the 2000 NFL draft. With the Colts, Morris won Super Bowl XLI against the Chicago Bears.

==Early life==
Morris was born and raised in Nampa, Idaho, and graduated from Nampa High School in 1993. He was an all-state fullback for the Bulldogs in football and &quot;USA Today&quot; All-American, and also lettered in basketball and track. Morris was also an Eagle Scout and was inducted into the NHS hall of fame in 2010.

==College career==
Morris attended Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, and played college football for the Cougars. Morris was a semi-finalist for the Butkus Award and was named as a first-team All-American by the Associated Press, &quot;Sporting News&quot;, and &quot;The Football News&quot;. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in communications from BYU.

==Professional career==
In 2000, Morris was selected in the first round (28th overall) of the NFL draft by the Indianapolis Colts, where he spent his entire career. Morris started at middle linebacker for the Colts for the first 5 years of his career, and was the Colts&#x27; leading special teams tackler in the 2006 season. Morris also started 9 games for the Colts during the 2006 season, including 3 games in the playoffs and Super Bowl XLI, replacing Gilbert Gardner to improve the Colts&#x27; run defense. In 2001, Morris had his best statistical year with 114 total tackles (84 solo) and one sack. Morris was an unrestricted free agent after the 2006 season concluded and was re-signed by Indianapolis on March 5. He injured his left knee in the fourth game of 2007, and had season-ending surgery. He was released after a failed physical on February 27, 2008.

<text>Conecuh Ridge Whiskey was rebranded as Clyde May&#x27;s Whiskey in 2017. It is a high-quality, high-proof, aged whiskey that is available as an Alabama-style whiskey, Straight Bourbon and Straight Rye whisky. Originally it was produced illegally in Alabama during the mid to late 20th century by Clyde May but the brand was legalized by Clyde&#x27;s son, Kenny May in 2001. 

In 2004 it was designated the official &quot;State Spirit&quot; of Alabama by legislative resolution. Later the same year the brand&#x27;s founder Kenny May was charged with several violations of Alabama liquor laws, to which he pleaded guilty. After a 15-month period during which the whiskey was unavailable for purchase, the brand ownership was restructured and production resumed.

== History ==
The History of Conecuh Ridge Whiskey begins with Clyde May, a legendary Alabama moonshiner and bootlegger. After returning from World War II with a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star, Clyde May started to produce his own moonshine whiskey as a side hustle. From the 1950s to the 1980s Clyde managed to produce around 300 gallons a week in a still of his own design in the woods near Almeria, Alabama in Bullock County, southeast of Montgomery. His product was known for its high quality relative to typical moonshine. According to his son, Kenny, the reason was his painstaking insistence on using the best equipment he could fabricate and taking extra steps during production to maintain the purity and quality of the product. While much of it was sold, unaged, as corn liquor, a certain amount would be casked in charred barrels with a couple of dried apples for flavor. This would be aged for about one year. Clyde claimed that the hot Alabama summers accelerated the effect of aging, requiring only one year instead of the minimum of two required for it to be called a Straight Bourbon. This would be bottled and given to friends and valued customers as &quot;Christmas Whiskey&quot;. Always operating outside the state liquor laws, Clyde May served an 18-month sentence at Maxwell Air Force Base in 1973. He gave up his cell to the man who convicted him, Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who was convicted in 1974 on charges from the Watergate scandal.

When Clyde May died in 1990 his son Kenny began looking for a way to honor his father&#x27;s memory by producing legal whiskey from his recipe. Careful planning led to a production run of 4000 bottles of Conecuh Ridge in 2002. Though Conecuh Brands&#x27; offices were in Union Springs, the actual producer for its first batches was Kentucky Bourbon Distillers, Ltd. of Bardstown, Kentucky, overseen by master distiller Even Kulsveen. Under contract from Conecuh Brands they had a mash produced using Conecuh Ridge spring water trucked in from Alabama, had the product distilled, aged in oak barrels, and bottled, and returned it to Alabama for distribution.

In April 2004, both houses of the Alabama Legislature voted to override the veto of Governor Bob Riley and adopted a resolution, now known as Act of Alabama 2004-97 naming &quot;Conecuh Ridge Alabama Fine Whiskey&quot; the &quot;official state spirit&quot;. For a few months it was sold in Alabama&#x27;s 147 ABC State Liquor Stores and privately owned package stores in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida. During 2004, citing distribution difficulties and limited demand for the boutique-priced liquor, the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board stopped stocking Conecuh Ridge in its stores, but would still take special orders for customers who requested it.

In December 2004, state liquor agents charged Kenny May with misdemeanor violations in two counties. He pleaded guilty to charges of selling liquor without a license, possessing excessive quantities of liquor in a dry county, and selling alcohol to a minor. The Control Board immediately moved to revoke Conecuh Ridge&#x27;s distribution licence, meaning that once stores sold out of their existing stock, the state&#x27;s official spirit could no longer be sold in Alabama. May&#x27;s stock was held in trust pending the outcome of his trial. Attorney Alva Lambert assumed interim leadership of the company, followed by spirits industry veteran Wesley Henderson, who led the company through turbulent times. Under Henderson&#x27;s leadership, distribution was expanded to additional domestic and international markets.Wesley Henderson then went on to create Angel&#x27;s Envy Bourbon in 2010.

After May entered his guilty plea, the Alabama House of Representatives moved to repeal the declaration of Conecuh Ridge as Alabama&#x27;s &quot;Official State Spirit&quot;. However, the reversal legislation never passed the Alabama Senate. It remains the &quot;Official State Spirit&quot; today. Kenny May passed away in 2016.

As of March 2009, Conecuh Ridge was purchased by Dallas, Texas-based Spirits Acquisition Corp. In 2014, the company was recapitalized by an investment group, Conecuh Ridge Distillery, Inc., led by chairman James Ammeen and is currently expanding the brand into selected markets throughout the U.S. and abroad.

In June 2017, L.C. May, the grandson of Clyde May, joined the company as their National Brand Ambassador thus helping bring the family heritage and history to the brand.

In September 2017, Clyde May&#x27;s Whiskey announced their plans to build a distillery in Troy, Alabama. Troy is located about 20 miles from where Clyde May made his whiskey. Prior to 2013, distillation of Spirits in Alabama was illegal, and Clyde May&#x27;s Whiskey began searching for a distillery site in early 2015.

== Character ==
Conecuh Ridge is described as an &quot;Alabama Style Tippling Whiskey&quot;, a rather imprecise designation which basically means that it is patterned after the spirits that would have been available at informal &quot;tippling houses&quot;. Clyde May used spring water from Southern Alabama and added oven-dried apples to his barrels. The resulting hints of green apple and cinnamon not only made it smoother than other whiskeys—they&#x27;re what made it Alabama Style. It is then aged for five to six years in heavy-toast charred white oak barrels.

==Awards ==
Clyde May&#x27;s Whiskey continues to win awards &amp; accolades across the globe. In 2023 alone, the brand won 11 medals and received numerous 90+ ratings in various competitions and tastings. Some of the highlights include:

Clyde May&#x27;s Straight Bourbon won Double Gold at the 2023 San Francisco Spirits Competition and scored 95 points at the New York International Spirits Competition. 

Clyde May&#x27;s Alabama Style Whiskey received a 93 rating from Tasting Panel Magazine and a Gold Medal at the 2023 Ascot Awards. 

Clyde May&#x27;s Straight Rye Whiskey won Double Platinum at the 2023 Ascot Awards and a 92 rating at the New York International Spirits Competition. 

Clyde May&#x27;s Special Reserve 6-Year Old 110-Proof Straight Bourbon was awarded Double Gold at the 2022 San Francisco Spirits Competition. 

Clyde May&#x27;s 9 Year Old Cask Strength Whiskey was listed in Liquor.com&#x27;s list of “10 Great New Aged Bourbons and Ryes.”

==Reviews==
*In the 2014 book &quot;Southern Living Bourbon &amp; Bacon: The Ultimate Guide to the South&#x27;s Favorite Foods&quot;, food critic Morgan Murphy said &quot;Conecuh uses the formula of an old Alabama moonshiner, Clyde May, and the tradition shines through.&quot;
*At the 2013 Los Angeles International Spirits Competition, the whiskey was rated at 96 points and named Best of Division (Small Batch Bourbon 10 years or less $30).
*&quot;Wine Enthusiast Magazine&quot; named Clyde May&#x27;s Conecuh Ridge Whiskey among its Top 50 Spirits of 2012, and its reviewer Kara Newman said it was &quot;A spry chameleon of a whiskey. At first, this dark amber spirit reads as light and sweet, from its distinct ripe apple and hazelnut notes to the light-bodied feel. But just when you think it&#x27;s going to be a lightweight, there&#x27;s surprising oomph on the finish, dry leather and clove notes that balance it out. This sippable whiskey would be great for whiskey sours and other cocktails. 93 points.&quot;
*&quot;Spirits Review&quot; by Chris Carlsson gave it a rating of 8 out of 10 (overall and for price/value) and said it was &quot;A interesting whiskey if a bit on the light side. A good starter whiskey for people who are starting to explore brown spirits. But not something that would challenge the serious bourbon drinker.&quot;

<text>The Greater Hartford Academy of Mathematics And Science (also known as GHAMAS) was located in the Learning Corridor in Hartford, CT. The building houses a grade 6-12 program, The Academy of Aerospace and Engineering (also known as AAE, Aerospace, and Aerospace and Engineering) is a magnet high school originally located in Hartford, CT and was a half-day program.

GHAMAS is run by the Capitol Region Education Council (CREC), one of 6 Regional Educational Service Centers (RESC) in Connecticut.

Trinity College has been involved in some of the projects with GHAMAS, such as the Brain Bee, a neuroscience competition. Hartford Hospital is involved in school activities as well.

The Academy of Aerospace and Engineering was built as GHAMAS in 1999. Labs at the academy include the Robotics, Physics, Earth Science, Biology, Cell Culture, Greenhouse &amp; Potting, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Special Instrumentation, and Engineering Labs. There are also several smaller student laboratories which are used by students to conduct independent research through a senior design and research course called Capstone.

Occasionally, speakers from industry or academia come to lecture full-day and morning half-day students (grades 9 and 10) about the field that they work in and educate them to possible careers in that field.

Students partake in a variety of clubs at the high school level, including competitive FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC )robotics, Science Fair, Model UN (United Nations) and Debate teams.

Select students pursue scientific research and engineering projects throughout the year and present their work at the Connecticut Science and Engineering Fair. Each year, some students that have presented exemplary work are chosen by CSEF to compete in the International Science and Engineering Fair

Aerospace was originally an exclusively half-day program operating as GHAMAS and is now solely a full-day program operating as The Academy of Aerospace and Engineering. Since the fall of 2011, the school holds 9-12 grade half-day, and 6-12 grade full-day students. At some point, the entire school became exclusively full-day.

When the school was a half day program, ninth and tenth-grade students took three foundation math (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-calculus, or higher) and science (Physics, Earth Science, Biology, and Chemistry) courses in the morning, followed by humanities and other classes at their sending district&#x27;s high school or with the full-day program. Half-day juniors and seniors take these humanities at their home schools during the morning and join the Aerospace juniors and seniors for up to four advanced elective courses in the afternoon, such as Molecular and Cellular Biology, Anatomy, Zoology, or Astronomy, along with Advanced Placement curricula.

Starting several years ago, all Aerospace students are full day students and attend all classes at the Windsor, Connecticut location.

Aerospace is a member of the NCSSSMST. This is an organization of secondary schools that promote Mathematics, Science, and Technology schools. Greater Hartford Academy of Math and Science has been involved as a NASA Explorer School. It is one of only three such schools in Connecticut. The director of both the high school and middle school academies is Adam Johnson.

<doc id="1247923" wikidata="Q500842" url="?curid=1247923" title="Loganiaceae">
<text>The Loganiaceae are a family of flowering plants classified in order Gentianales. The family includes up to 13 genera, distributed around the world&#x27;s tropics. There are not any great morphological characteristics to distinguish these taxa from others in the order Gentianales.

Many members of the Loganiaceae are extremely poisonous, causing death by convulsion. Poisonous properties are largely due to alkaloids such as those found in &quot;Strychnos&quot;. Glycosides are also present as loganin in &quot;Strychnos&quot;.

Earlier treatments of the family have included up to 29 genera. Phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that this broadly defined Loganiaceae was a polyphyletic assemblage, and numerous genera have been removed from Loganiaceae to other families (sometimes in other orders), e.g., Gentianaceae, Gelsemiaceae, Plocospermataceae, Tetrachondraceae, Buddlejaceae, and Gesneriaceae. Some classification schemes, notably Takhtajan&#x27;s, break the remaining Loganiaceae even further, into as many as four families; Strychnaceae, Antoniaceae, Spigeliaceae and Loganiaceae.

==Genera==
Some sources indicate the family consists of 13 genera. A more recent study considers some &quot;Labordia&quot; species synonymous with &quot;Geniostoma&quot;, resulting in 12 genera in other sources. As of November 2023 &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; accepts 16 genera:

<doc id="1247929" wikidata="Q2270424" url="?curid=1247929" title="Subthalamic nucleus">
<text>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a small lens-shaped nucleus in the brain where it is, from a functional point of view, part of the basal ganglia system. In terms of anatomy, it is the major part of the subthalamus. As suggested by its name, the subthalamic nucleus is located ventral to the thalamus. It is also dorsal to the substantia nigra and medial to the internal capsule. 

==Anatomy==
=== Structure ===
The principal type of neuron found in the subthalamic nucleus has rather long, sparsely spiny dendrites. In the more centrally located neurons, the dendritic arbors have a more ellipsoidal shape. The dimensions of these arbors (1200 μm, 600 μm, and 300 μm) are similar across many species—including rat, cat, monkey and human—which is unusual. However, the number of neurons increases with brain size as well as the external dimensions of the nucleus. The principal neurons are glutamatergic, which give them a particular functional position in the basal ganglia system. In humans there are also a small number (about 7.5%) of GABAergic interneurons that participate in the local circuitry; however, the dendritic arbors of subthalamic neurons shy away from the border and primarily interact with one another.

The structure of the subthalamic nucleus has not yet been fully explored and understood, but it is likely composed of several internal domains. The primate subthalamic nucleus is often divided in three internal anatomical-functional domains. However, this so-called &quot;tripartite model&quot; has been debated because it does not fully explain the complexity of the subthalamic nucleus in brain function.

===Afferent axons===
The subthalamic nucleus receives its main input from the external globus pallidus (GPe), not so much through the ansa lenticularis as often said but by radiating &#x27;comb&#x27; fibers crossing the medial pallidum first and the internal capsule (forming part of Edinger&#x27;s comb system, see figure), as well as the ansa subthalamica. These afferents are GABAergic, inhibiting neurons in the subthalamic nucleus. Excitatory, glutamatergic inputs come from the cerebral cortex (entire frontal cortex with a predominance for motor, premotor and oculomotor input to the posterolateral part of the nucleus), and from the pars parafascicularis of the central complex. The subthalamic nucleus also receives neuromodulatory inputs, notably dopaminergic axons from the substantia nigra pars compacta.
It also receives inputs from the pedunculopontine nucleus.

===Efferent targets===
The axons of subthalamic nucleus neurons leave the nucleus dorsally. The efferent axons are glutamatergic (excitatory). Except for the connection to the striatum (17.3% in macaques), most of the subthalamic principal neurons are multitargets and directed to the other elements of the core of the basal ganglia. Some send axons to the substantia nigra medially and to the medial and lateral nuclei of the pallidum laterally (3-target, 21.3%). Some are 2-target with the lateral pallidum and the substantia nigra (2.7%) or the lateral pallidum and the medial (48%). Less are single target for the lateral pallidum. In the pallidum, subthalamic terminals end in bands parallel to the pallidal border. When all axons reaching this target are added, the main efference of the subthalamic nucleus is, in 82.7% of the cases, clearly the internal globus pallidus (GPi).

Some researchers have reported internal axon collaterals. However, there is little functional evidence for this.

==Physiology==
===Subthalamic nucleus===
The first intracellular electrical recordings of subthalamic neurons were performed using sharp electrodes in a rat slice preparation. In these recordings three key observations were made, all three of which have dominated subsequent reports of subthalamic firing properties. The first observation was that, in the absence of current injection or synaptic stimulation, the majority of cells were spontaneously firing. The second observation is that these cells are capable of transiently firing at very high frequencies. The third observation concerns non-linear behaviors when cells are transiently depolarized after being hyperpolarized below –65mV. They are then able to engage voltage-gated calcium and sodium currents to fire bursts of action potentials.

Several recent studies have focused on the autonomous pacemaking ability of subthalamic neurons. These cells are often referred to as &quot;fast-spiking pacemakers&quot;, since they can generate spontaneous action potentials at rates of 80 to 90 Hz in primates.

Oscillatory and synchronous activity is likely to be a typical pattern of discharge in subthalamic neurons recorded from patients and animal models characterized by the loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which is the principal pathology that underlies Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

=== Lateropallido-subthalamic system===
Strong reciprocal connections link the subthalamic nucleus and the external segment of the globus pallidus. Both are fast-spiking pacemakers. Together, they are thought to constitute the &quot;central pacemaker of the basal ganglia&quot; with synchronous bursts.

The connection of the lateral pallidum with the subthalamic nucleus is also the one in the basal ganglia system where the reduction between emitter/receiving elements is likely the strongest. In terms of volume, in humans, the lateral pallidum measures 808 mm3, the subthalamic nucleus only 158 mm3. This translated in numbers of neurons represents a strong compression with loss of map precision.

Some axons from the lateral pallidum go to the striatum. The activity of the medial pallidum is influenced by afferences from the lateral pallidum and from the subthalamic nucleus. The same for the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The subthalamic nucleus sends axons to another regulator: the pedunculo-pontine complex (id).

The lateropallido-subthalamic system is thought to play a key role in the generation of the patterns of activity seen in Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Pathophysiology==
Lesioning the STN leads to alleviation of motor symptoms such as akinesia, rigidity, and tremor in Parkinson disease. This was first shown in the MPTP primate model in a paper by Bergman and colleagues. This inspired Benazzouz and colleagues to probe deep brain stimulation of the nucleus, which was known to exert similar effects as ablative lesions. Soon after, the team of Alim Louis Benabid showed that deep brain stimulation of the nucleus leads to symptom relief in human patients with Parkinson disease, as well, which led to the establishment of the currently FDA approved and widely applied form of deep brain stimulation. The first to be stimulated are the terminal arborisations of afferent axons, which modify the activity of subthalamic neurons. However, it has been shown in thalamic slices from mice, that the stimulus also causes nearby astrocytes to release adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a precursor to adenosine (through a catabolic process). In turn, adenosine A1 receptor activation depresses excitatory transmission in the thalamus, thus mimicking ablation of the subthalamic nucleus.

Before the Bergman paper, the stereotactic field avoided lesioning the nucleus, since it was known that unilateral destruction or disruption of the subthalamic nucleus — which may result from naturally occurring strokes — may lead to hemiballismus. While this remains generally true, iatrogenic lesioning of the STN has been carried out numerous times and has recently gained new wind with the advent of MR guided focused ultrasound, which has also been probed for subthalamic nucleotomies to treat Parkinson disease. Curiously, a team around Michael Fox could recently show that, while some lesions that led to hemiballism were indeed in and around the STN, the majority of reported cases were in other regions of the brain.

As one of the STN&#x27;s suspected functions is in impulse control, dysfunction in this region has been implicated in obsessive–compulsive disorder. Application of high frequency pulses by deep brain stimulation has shown some promise in correcting severe impulsive behavior and has been FDA approved for treatment resistant cases with the disorder.

== Function ==
The function of the STN is not fully understood but it is believed that, as a component of the basal ganglia, it plays a part in the so-called &quot;hyperdirect&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; pathways of motor control, as opposed to the direct pathway which bypasses the STN on its way from the Striatum to the internal pallidum. STN dysfunction has been implicated in motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia and tremor, behavioral features such as stopping of ongoing movements or impulsivity in individuals presented with two equally rewarding stimuli.

The physiological role of the STN has been for long hidden by its pathological role. But lately, the research on the physiology of the STN led to the discovery that the STN is required to achieve intended movement, including locomotion, balance and motor coordination. It is involved in stopping or interrupting on-going motor tasks. Moreover, STN excitation was generally correlated with significant reduction in locomotor activity, while in contrast, STN inhibition enhanced locomotion.

==History==
The STN was first described by Jules Bernard Luys in 1865.

<doc id="1247932" wikidata="Q4603746" url="?curid=1247932" title="2004–05 NCAA football bowl games">
<text>The 2004–05 NCAA football bowl games were a series of 32 post-season games (including the Bowl Championship Series) played in December 2004 and January 2005 for Division I-A football teams and their all-stars. The post-season began with the New Orleans Bowl on December 14, 2004, and concluded on January 29, 2005, with the season-ending Senior Bowl.

A total of 28 team-competitive games, and five all-star games, were played. For the first time in three years, the 56 available bowl slots were filled by teams with winning records, as no teams with non-winning seasons (6–6, or .500) were invited to participate in bowl games.

==Schedule==
==Non-BCS bowls==

Of the 59 Division I-A football teams with winning records, 56 were invited to the various bowl games. This season, bowl officials had more difficulty than usual filling their slots. Because the regular season was only 11 games, teams had to finish at least 6–5 to qualify. Teams that were allowed under NCAA rules to play a 12th regular-season game in return for playing at Hawaii had to finish at least 7–5.

Four conferences – the Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-10, and SEC – all failed to produce enough bowl-eligible teams to fill their contracted bowl slots. In addition, a massive brawl between Clemson and South Carolina players during their November 20 game, less than 24 hours following the Pacers–Pistons brawl during a National Basketball Association game, led both schools to announce that they would not go to any bowl game as a self-imposed punishment. Both schools were otherwise bowl-eligible, thus forcing bowl organizers to scramble even more to fill their slots. In addition, Utah&#x27;s unexpected entry into the BCS caused further shuffling of normal bowl tie-ins.

The main beneficiary of this unexpected chaos was the Mid-American Conference, which received five bowl bids instead of its contracted two. The only bowl-eligible team willing to accept an invitation that was left out of this season&#x27;s bowl games was another MAC school, Akron. The Zips would make their first bowl appearance the next season.

Three schools made their first-ever bowl appearance this season: UAB (Hawaii Bowl), UConn (2004 Motor City Bowl), and Troy State (Silicon Valley Football Classic). Of these three, only UConn won its game. For the first time since the 1968–1969 bowl season Nebraska did not go to a bowl game.

Records shown are pre-bowl.

===New Orleans Bowl===

*Southern Miss (6–5) 31, North Texas (7–4) 10
The bowl season kicked off on December 14 with the fourth annual New Orleans Bowl, one of two bowl games played at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. Dustin Almond passed for 249 yards and a touchdown, and rushed for a touchdown as well, as Southern Miss Golden Eagles (Conference USA) defeated the North Texas Mean Green (Sun Belt Conference) 31–10.

===Champs Sports Bowl===

*Georgia Tech (6–5) 51, Syracuse (6–5) 14
The first of two bowl games at the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Florida was the Champs Sports Bowl, held on December 21. It featured the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (ACC) and the Syracuse Orange (Big East). Georgia Tech quarterback Reggie Ball passed for two touchdowns and ran for another, while the Yellow Jackets defense recorded a touchdown off of an interception and a safety. Georgia Tech romped, 51–14.

===GMAC Bowl===

*Bowling Green (8–3) 52, Memphis (8–3) 35
The Bowling Green Falcons (MAC) met the Memphis Tigers (C-USA) on December 22 in Mobile, Alabama in the GMAC Bowl. In a meeting of high-powered offenses, Memphis&#x27;s Danny Wimprime threw for 324 yards and 4 touchdowns, but was outdone by his counterpart Omar Jacobs, who had 365 yards and 5 touchdowns. Bowling Green won, 52–35.

===Fort Worth Bowl===

*Cincinnati (6–5) 32, Marshall (6–5) 14
The Fort Worth Bowl, held on December 23 at Amon G. Carter Stadium in the titular city, matched a departing C-USA team with a future member of that conference. The Cincinnati Bearcats, which left C-USA for the Big East Conference after the 2004–05 season, played the Marshall Thundering Herd, which joined C-USA from the MAC for 2005–06. Cincinnati quarterback Gino Guidugli returned from a broken hand to throw for two touchdowns, and the Bearcats defense held Marshall to 134 yards of total offense in a 32–14 win. The loss broke the Thundering Herd&#x27;s streaks of 20 consecutive winning seasons and five winning bowl appearances (in nonconsecutive years).

===Las Vegas Bowl===
*Wyoming (6–5) 24, UCLA (6–5) 21
The first matchup of the bowl season that pitted a team from a BCS AQ conference against a BCS non-AQ conference team was the Las Vegas Bowl, held at Sam Boyd Stadium in Whitney, Nevada on December 23. The UCLA Bruins (Pac-10) played the Wyoming Cowboys (Mountain West Conference), with UCLA the heavy favorite. The underdog Cowboys took an early 10–0 lead, but the Bruins stormed back to take a 21–10 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Cowboys scored a touchdown early in the fourth quarter on a trick play, and capped off the first major upset of the bowl season with a touchdown pass from Corey Bramlet to John Wadkowski with 57 seconds left. The 24–21 Wyoming win was the Cowboys&#x27; first bowl victory since 1968.

===Hawaii Bowl===

*Hawaii (7–5) 59, UAB (7–4) 40
On December 24, the Hawaii Warriors (WAC) played the Hawaii Bowl on their home field, Aloha Stadium in Honolulu for the third time in the bowl&#x27;s three-year existence. The Warriors faced a first-time bowl participant in the UAB Blazers (C-USA). In an offensive shootout that saw both quarterbacks (Hawaii&#x27;s Timmy Chang and UAB&#x27;s Darrell Hackney) throw for over 400 yards, the homestanding Warriors won 59–40. The Warriors&#x27; Chad Owens caught two of Chang&#x27;s four touchdown passes and returned a punt for a TD. Chang finished his career as the first Division I-A quarterback to throw for over 17,000 yards in his career, and also finished with career records for pass attempts, completions, and total offense.

===MPC Computers Bowl===

*Fresno State (8–3) 37, Virginia (8–3) 34
On December 27, the second matchup between BCS AQ and BCS non-AQ conference teams took place in the MPC Computers Bowl in Boise, Idaho. The Fresno State Bulldogs (WAC) played the Virginia Cavaliers (ACC). UVa went out to a 21–7 second-quarter lead, but the Bulldogs stormed back to tie the game at 24 early in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers retook the lead early in the fourth quarter on a rushing touchdown by Wali Lundy, but Bulldogs quarterback Paul Pinegar threw a 3-yard TD pass to Jason Fairman with 19 seconds left; the ensuing extra point tied the game at 31, leading to the first overtime of the 2004–05 bowl season. In the overtime, the Cavaliers had the ball first and kicked a field goal. On the Bulldogs&#x27; first play in overtime, Pinegar threw his fifth TD pass of the day, connecting with Stephen Spach to give the Bulldogs a 37–34 upset win.

===Motor City Bowl===

*UConn (7–4) 39, Toledo (9–3) 10
The other bowl on December 27, the Motor City Bowl held at Ford Field in Detroit, was also a BCS AQ conference vs. BCS non-AQ conference matchup. The UConn Huskies made their first-ever bowl appearance in their second year in Division I-A and first as a member of the Big East. They faced the MAC champion Toledo Rockets, which were playing little more than an hour&#x27;s drive from their campus. Rockets quarterback Bruce Gradowski, affected by a broken hand suffered in the MAC championship game, was ineffective before being benched at halftime. However, the Huskies were effective enough that a healthy Gradowski may not have made a difference; UConn quarterback Dan Orlovsky threw for two TDs with no interceptions, and return specialist Larry Taylor had 157 return yards, including a punt return for a TD. UConn won 39–10, giving BCS AQ conferences their first win in three tries against BCS non-AQ conference teams this season.

===Independence Bowl===

*Iowa State (8–4) 17, Miami (Ohio) (8–4) 13
On December 28 in Shreveport, Louisiana, another BCS AQ/non-AQ matchup took place in the Independence Bowl between the Iowa State Cyclones (Big 12) and the Miami (Ohio) RedHawks (MAC). Iowa State went out to a 10–0 lead in the second quarter, but Miami scored a touchdown late in that quarter to reduce the Cyclones&#x27; halftime lead to 10–7. The RedHawks scored a TD to take a 13–10 lead in the third quarter, but missed the extra point. The Cyclones&#x27; Ryan Kock scored the winning TD early in the fourth quarter, and the Cyclones defense held on for the 17–13 win. Two Cyclones, quarterback Bret Meyer and running back Stevie Hicks, rushed for over 100 yards each. RedHawks receiver Michael Larkin extended his NCAA record of consecutive games with a reception to 50. This was the last game for RedHawks head coach Terry Hoeppner, who took the head job at Indiana.

===Insight Bowl===

*Oregon State (6–5) 38, Notre Dame (6–5) 21
The second bowl on December 28, the Insight Bowl held at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona, the home of the Arizona Diamondbacks, was the second of the 2004–05 bowl season to pit two BCS AQ member teams. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish, the only independent with BCS automatic qualifying privileges, took on the Oregon State Beavers from the Pac-10. The Beavers never trailed in the game, and easily defeated the Irish 38–21. Beavers quarterback Derek Anderson threw for 359 yards and four touchdown passes, with no interceptions.

The game was a rematch of the 2001 Fiesta Bowl, played at the nearby Sun Devil Stadium, with a similar result (Oregon State blowout victory).

===Houston Bowl===

*Colorado (7–5) 33, UTEP (8–3) 28
On December 29, the Colorado Buffaloes (Big 12) took on the UTEP Miners (WAC) in the Houston Bowl at Reliant Stadium in the host city. The Miners led for most of the game, but Buffaloes quarterback Joel Klatt threw two TD passes in the fourth quarter to lead CU to a 33–28 win. Klatt finished 24-for-33 for 333 yards. Miners QB Jordan Palmer, younger brother of 2002 Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer, threw for 328 yards and two TDs, but only completed two of his last 12 passes, finishing 22-for-42 with two interceptions.

===Alamo Bowl===

*Ohio State (7–4) 33, Oklahoma State (7–4) 7
In the other game on December 29, the Alamo Bowl held at the Alamodome in San Antonio, the Ohio State Buckeyes (Big Ten) took on the Oklahoma State Cowboys (Big 12), in a game which matched two schools whose initials spell &quot;OSU&quot;. This was also Ohio State&#x27;s first December bowl since the 1993 Holiday Bowl. The Buckeyes defense set the tone for the game early, intercepting Cowboys quarterback Donovan Woods during the game&#x27;s first possession. Justin Zwick, starting at quarterback in place of the suspended Troy Smith, threw a touchdown pass to Anthony Gonzalez three plays later, giving the Buckeyes a lead that they never relinquished. The Buckeyes won 33–7.

===Continental Tire Bowl===

*Boston College (8–3) 37, North Carolina (6–5) 24
In the first of four games on December 30, the Boston College Eagles, which left the Big East in July 2005 to join the ACC, played one of its future conference rivals, the North Carolina Tar Heels, in the Continental Tire Bowl at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina. Eagles quarterback Paul Peterson earned MVP honors by going 24-for-33 for 236 yards and two TDs before breaking his leg in the fourth quarter. Andre Callender added 174 rushing yards for the Eagles. The game was close for the first three quarters, and tied three times, but the Eagles pulled away to win their fifth consecutive bowl game and final game as a Big East member 37–24.

===Emerald Bowl===

*Navy (9–2) 34, New Mexico (7–4) 19
The second game on December 30, the Emerald Bowl held at SBC Park in San Francisco, pitted the Navy Midshipmen (independent) against the New Mexico Lobos (MWC). After the Lobos jumped to an early 7–0 lead, Navy QB Aaron Polanco took over the game, rushing for three touchdowns and throwing for a fourth. The Midshipmen defense performed well in the clutch, forcing two turnovers in the first half that led to TDs and making a successful goal-line stand in the third quarter. After the stand, the Midshipmen offense then went on a 26-play drive that lasted nearly 15 minutes, ending with a field goal, that sealed Navy&#x27;s 34–19 win. The Midshipmen finished the season 10–2, their first 10-win season since 1905. The Emerald Bowl is now known as the Fight Hunger Bowl.

===Holiday Bowl===
*Texas Tech (7–4) 45, California (10–1) 31
In the third game on December 30 (also the second of three in California), the Holiday Bowl was held at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, pitting the Pac-10&#x27;s California Golden Bears and the Big 12&#x27;s Texas Tech Red Raiders. Cal, edged out for a BCS bowl berth by Texas in the last week of the regular season, was out to prove that it deserved a BCS bowl berth. The Bears played well at first, finishing the first quarter with a 14–7 lead. However, the second and third quarters belonged to the Red Raiders, who outscored the Bears 31–3 in those periods, going on to score the biggest upset of the bowl season with a 45–31 win. Raiders QB Sonny Cumbie torched the Bears defense for 520 passing yards, going 40-for-60 with three TDs and no interceptions. The brightest spot for Cal was running back J.J. Arrington, who ran for 173 yards and a touchdown, making him only the third Pac-10 runner to reach 2,000 yards rushing in a season.

===Silicon Valley Football Classic===

*Northern Illinois (8–3) 34, Troy State (7–4) 21
The last game of December 30 was the Silicon Valley Football Classic at Spartan Stadium in San José. The Northern Illinois Huskies (MAC), playing in their first bowl game in 21 years, faced the Troy State Trojans from the Sun Belt, a school that joined NCAA Division I-A in 2001 and were playing in their first bowl game ever. The Trojans opened strong, scoring two touchdowns, a pass and a run by D.T. McDowell, in the first quarter to build a 14–0 lead. The Huskies came back, tying the score by the end of the first quarter with rushing touchdowns by Garrett Wolfe and Josh Haldi, then building a 34–14 lead in the fourth quarter. The Trojans attempted a comeback, with McDowell running in another touchdown, but failed on their next possession on fourth and goal, and the Huskies were able to run out the clock to complete a 34–21 win. This would be the last game ever for this bowl, as poor attendance due to a driving rainstorm, a rarity of December in the Bay Area, along with bad publicity as neither the Pac-10 or WAC had teams with the necessary winning records and other negative press led the NCAA to strip the Silicon Valley Football Classic of its certification on April 20, 2005.

===Music City Bowl===

*Minnesota (6–5) 20, Alabama (6–5) 16
The first game on December 31, the Music City Bowl held at The Coliseum in Nashville, matched the Alabama Crimson Tide (SEC) and Minnesota Golden Gophers (Big Ten). The first quarter was one of the sloppiest in recent years, with the two teams turning the ball over five times (Minnesota three times, Alabama twice). On the first play of the second quarter, the Gophers took a 14–7 lead on a touchdown run by Marion Barber III and never trailed again. Late in the fourth quarter, the Gophers, then leading 20–14, took a deliberate safety on a punt from their own end zone. On the ensuing possession, the Tide drove to the Gophers&#x27; 15-yard-line, but their threat ended with an incomplete pass on fourth down. The Gophers then ran out the clock for the 20–16 win. Barber ran for 187 yards, and fellow Gophers running back Laurence Maroney ran for 105. Alabama, which was second in the nation in total defense going into the game, had not given up a 100-yard game to an opposing rusher this season.

===Sun Bowl===

*Arizona State (8–3) 27, Purdue (7–4) 23
The next game on New Year&#x27;s Eve, the Sun Bowl, held at the stadium of the same name in El Paso, Texas, pitted the Arizona State Sun Devils against the Purdue Boilermakers in what would be the sole Big Ten/Pac-10 matchup on the bowl schedule. The first half of the game was a defensive struggle, with the Sun Devils taking a 3–2 lead into the locker room. The offensive fireworks began on the first play from scrimmage of the second half, with Boilermakers QB Kyle Orton connecting with Brian Hare on an 80-yard TD pass. The Sun Devils answered with a Sam Keller TD pass to Derek Hagan to retake the lead. This set the stage for a wild fourth quarter that featured four lead changes, two of them in the last two minutes of the game. Purdue got the ball with 1:55 remaining and trailing 20–16; Orton took the Boilermakers down the field in four plays and 33 seconds, completing the drive with a 6-yard TD pass to Charles Davis. The Sun Devils then took only four plays to move the ball 80 yards, ending in a 19-yard Keller TD pass to Rudy Burgess with 43 seconds left. The ensuing extra point gave the Devils a 27–23 lead. Purdue was unable to move the ball in the remaining seconds, sealing the Devils&#x27; win.

===Liberty Bowl===

*Louisville (10–1) 44, Boise State (11–0) 40
The third game on December 31, and the last of the bowl season to feature two BCS non-AQ conference schools, was the Liberty Bowl, held in the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis. One of the most intriguing matchups of the bowl season pitted the two top-ranked offenses in NCAA Division I-A. The Louisville Cardinals (C-USA) led the nation in scoring and total yardage per game; their opponents, WAC champion the Boise State Broncos, were second in both categories. The Broncos also took their undefeated regular season record and Division I-A&#x27;s then-longest winning streak of 22 games into the contest. In a wild game that saw five lead changes, the Cardinals won 44–40, ending the Broncos&#x27; streak, despite a season-high four turnovers. The Cardinals racked up 564 yards of total offense, surpassing the 500-yard mark for the ninth time this season. Starting Louisville QB Stefan LeFors threw for two touchdowns, ran for a third, and made the key block allowing a fourth touchdown to score, but also had an interception run back for a TD. The Broncos went into the game averaging 511 yards per game on offense, but could only manage 281. This was the last game for Louisville in C-USA; in July 2005, they joined a BCS AQ conference as a new member of the Big East.

===Peach Bowl===

*Miami (Florida) (8–3) 27, Florida (7–4) 10
The final game on December 31 was the Peach Bowl, held at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. It matched the Florida Gators of the SEC with one of their two bitter in-state rivals, the Miami Hurricanes from the ACC. The Hurricanes did most of their damage on special teams and defense, returning a blocked field goal and a punt for touchdowns, and intercepting Gators QB Chris Leak twice. Miami won 27–10, extending their winning streak against Florida to six games and giving &#x27;Canes senior QB Brock Berlin (a former Florida player) a 5–0 record as a starter against Miami&#x27;s two major in-state rivals (Florida and Florida State).

===Cotton Bowl Classic===

*Tennessee (9–3) 38, Texas A&amp;M (7–4) 7
The Cotton Bowl Classic, held in the stadium of the same name in Dallas on January 1, matched the Tennessee Volunteers (SEC) and the Texas A&amp;M Aggies (Big 12). On the game&#x27;s seventh play from scrimmage, Vols QB Rick Clausen, a third-stringer for most of the season, completed a short pass to C.J. Fayton, who promptly turned the reception into a 57-yard touchdown to give the Vols an early lead. Clausen passed for two more TDs with no interceptions, Vols running back Gerald Riggs racked up 102 yards and a touchdown on the ground, and the Vols defense pressured the Aggies into five turnovers. Tennessee ended with a 38–7 win, their most one-sided bowl win ever.

===Outback Bowl===

*Georgia (9–2) 24, Wisconsin (9–2) 21
Also on New Year&#x27;s Day, the Outback Bowl was held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. The game matched the Georgia Bulldogs and the Wisconsin Badgers in the first of two Big Ten-SEC New Year&#x27;s Day contests. The first 20 minutes of the game were mostly a defensive battle, with the Badgers taking a 6–3 lead. Georgia QB David Greene threw a TD pass in the second quarter to give the Bulldogs a lead they never relinquished. He added a second TD pass in the third quarter, but had an interception run back for a Badgers TD in the fourth. Thomas Brown added 111 rushing yards and a TD for the Bulldogs, and Lombardi Award winner David Pollack forced a key Badgers fumble with one of his three sacks. The Bulldogs held on for a 24–21 win, extending Greene&#x27;s NCAA record for wins by a starting quarterback to 42.

===Gator Bowl===

*Florida State (8–3) 30, West Virginia (8–3) 18
The third bowl game on January 1 was the Gator Bowl, held at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. It matched the Florida State Seminoles (ACC) and the West Virginia Mountaineers (Big East). Longtime Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden was facing his former school for the first time since the two met in this game in 1982. The &#x27;Noles went out to an early lead when Leon Washington ran 69 yards for a TD; he finished with 195 yards rushing on only 12 carries. However, inconsistent Seminoles QB Chris Rix helped keep the Mountaineers in the game, throwing two interceptions and fumbling three times, losing one, in the first half. Rix eventually settled down, leading the Seminoles on two touchdown drives in the second half. Lorenzo Booker added 101 yards rushing for the Seminoles. The Mountaineers ran for 238 yards against the nation&#x27;s top rushing defense, led by 134 yards and two TDs by Kay-Jay Harris. However, special teams miscues hurt the Mountaineers. In the first half alone, a return man fumbled away a kickoff, two different kickers missed extra points, a kickoff was booted out of bounds, and the Mountaineers faked a field goal but failed to convert the first-down run. Even more tellingly, the Mountaineers were unsuccessful in the red zone; they advanced the ball past the Seminoles 20 five times, but could only score a TD and a field goal. The Seminoles pulled away to a 30–18 win, saving them from a third straight bowl loss and giving Bowden his 18th bowl victory, one shy of Joe Paterno&#x27;s record of 19.

===Capital One Bowl===

*Iowa (9–2) 30, LSU (9–2) 25
The fourth bowl game on January 1, the second of the bowl season held at the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, and the other Big Ten vs. SEC contest on New Year&#x27;s Day was the Capital One Bowl, featuring the Iowa Hawkeyes and the LSU Tigers. The Hawkeyes scored on their first possession, with QB Drew Tate burning an LSU blitz by completing a pass to Clinton Solomon that turned into a 57-yard touchdown play. This gave Iowa a lead that it did not give up until the game&#x27;s last minute. The Hawkeyes defense largely bottled up the Tigers&#x27; running game, except for a 74-yard TD run by Alley Broussard in the second quarter, and Iowa had a 24–12 lead early in the fourth. Freshman QB JaMarcus Russell came off the bench for LSU and connected with Skyler Green for two fourth-quarter TD passes, the last of which gave LSU a 25–24 lead with 46 seconds left. After a failed 2-point conversion, Iowa got the ball back, and Tate completed two passes, but a penalty pushed the Hawkeyes back to their own 44 with 14 seconds left. Tate threw long to Warren Holloway, who was open because of an LSU coverage breakdown, and Holloway scored the winning touchdown with no time remaining. No extra point was attempted, and Iowa won 30–25. The result spoiled Nick Saban&#x27;s last game as LSU head coach; he left to become head coach of the Miami Dolphins. With the loss, Saban&#x27;s record fell to 30–1 when leading at the half with LSU, who also became the first defending BCS national champion to lose a non-BCS bowl the following year.

==Bowl Championship Series games==
Records shown are pre-bowl.

===Rose Bowl===

*Texas (10–1) 38, Michigan (9–2) 37
The Rose Bowl, held on January 1 in the stadium of the same name in Pasadena, California, pitted the Big Ten champions, the Michigan Wolverines, and the Texas Longhorns from the Big 12. Utah&#x27;s unexpected entry into the BCS games, combined with Texas leapfrogging Cal in the final BCS rankings, plus the fact that Pac-10 champion Southern California was playing in the Orange Bowl for the National Championship made it impossible for the Rose Bowl to maintain its traditional Big Ten–Pac-10 match-up for only the third time since 1947.

Nonetheless, the match-up promised to be highly entertaining, as well as historic for being the first ever game between Michigan and Texas, the winningest and third-winningest college football programs, respectively, of all time. The 2,271 games played by the two teams mark the most games ever played by two teams before they met for the first time. It was also the Longhorns&#x27; first trip ever to the Rose Bowl, and the game itself proved to be a record-setting performance as well—16 Rose Bowl individual or team records were set or tied during the game, as well as numerous team and conference records.

The game proved to be an offensive showcase. Longhorns QB Vince Young had 372 yards of total offense, rushing for 192 yards and four TDs and passing for 180 yards and a fifth TD, setting new Rose Bowl record for most total touchdowns. He became the first Texas quarterback to throw for over 1,000 yards and rush for over 1,000 yards in a single season. Together with Doak Walker Award-winning running back Cedric Benson, the two became the first Texas duo to each run for 1,000 yards in the same season.

Wolverines freshman QB Chad Henne threw for four TDs, tying both the Michigan and Rose Bowl single-game record. Three of Henne&#x27;s TDs went to All-American receiver and Fred Biletnikoff Award winner Braylon Edwards. Edwards set a Rose Bowl record for touchdown passes caught in a game, and also set Michigan and Big Ten records for career touchdown receptions (39). Another Wolverines receiver, Steve Breaston, amassed 310 all-purpose yards, breaking a Rose Bowl record set by O. J. Simpson in 1969.

By midway through the third quarter, the teams had been tied at 7, 14, and 21, but the Wolverines took a 31–21 lead going into the fourth quarter. In that quarter, Young ran for TDs before and after a Michigan field goal, giving the Longhorns a 35–34 lead. The Wolverines retook the lead with 3:04 remaining on Garrett Rivas&#x27; third field goal of the day. On the ensuing possession, Young led the &#x27;Horns into position for a 37-yard field goal with 2 seconds left. Michigan took both of its remaining timeouts in an attempt to &quot;ice&quot; Texas kicker Dusty Mangum. He finally put a wobbly kick through the uprights as time expired, giving the Longhorns a 38–37 win. The thrilling come-from-behind fourth quarter victory marked their sixth such victory of the year. The game was won on the final play for the first time in Rose Bowl history, and only the third time in Longhorns history.

===Fiesta Bowl===

*Utah (11–0) 35, Pittsburgh (8–3) 7
The final game on January 1 was the Fiesta Bowl, held at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona (suburban Phoenix). It matched the Pittsburgh Panthers, the Big East champions and the Mountain West champion Utah Utes. This was another historic matchup, as Utah became the first BCS non-AQ conference member to appear in a BCS bowl game. It was also the swan song for Utes head coach Urban Meyer, who left after the game to take the head coaching job at Florida.

The matchup was fairly controversial, though not because of the Utes&#x27; presence; in their 11–0 regular season, they had defeated three schools from BCS AQ conferences, two of which participated in bowl games, by an average of 22 points. No opponent came within two touchdowns of the Utes. The controversy surrounded the presence of Pittsburgh, or more to the point, the Big East, in the BCS AQ pool. The Panthers finished 8–3 in a conference that had just lost its two strongest programs (Miami-Florida and Virginia Tech) to the ACC—a tiebreaker among four teams granted Pittsburgh the Big East championship. However, the BCS was still contractually obligated to place the Big East champion in one of its bowls.

Utah&#x27;s vaunted offense started the game slowly, but the Utes nonetheless went into halftime leading 14–0. The tone for the game was initially set by the Utes defense, which mercilessly pressured Panthers QB Tyler Palko, and special teams, which blocked a Pittsburgh field goal attempt and nearly blocked a punt. In the third quarter, the Utah offense came alive, with QB Alex Smith, a Heisman Trophy finalist who became the top overall pick in the 2005 NFL draft, throwing two TD passes and connecting on a hook and lateral that ended in a Paris Warren TD. By the end of that quarter, the Utes led by their final margin of 35–7. The win capped off a fairy-tale 12–0 season, Utah&#x27;s first perfect season since 1930, and sent Meyer off to his new job in Gainesville with a historic win.

Smith went 29-for-37 passing for 328 yards and three TDs with no interceptions, and also led the Utes in rushing with 68 yards. Warren caught 15 passes for 180 yards and a TD, as well as scoring on the pass-and-lateral play. The Utes defense sacked Palko nine times.

===Sugar Bowl===

*Auburn (12–0) 16, Virginia Tech (10–1) 13
In the second game of the bowl season held at the Superdome in New Orleans, the SEC champion Auburn Tigers took on the Virginia Tech Hokies, the ACC champions in the Sugar Bowl on January 3.

Despite finishing the regular season 12–0 and winning the SEC, Auburn was not able to crack the top two in the BCS rankings, shutting the Tigers out of the BCS title game. Their main hope for a split national championship (as happened the season before with LSU and Southern California) was to score a resounding win over the Hokies and hope that Oklahoma unimpressively defeated Southern California in the Orange Bowl the following evening. Auburn would then have to hope that enough voters in the AP media poll switch their votes from Oklahoma to give the Tigers the AP title.

The Tigers had a chance to blow the game open in the first half, but were unable to score a touchdown in three trips inside the Hokies&#x27; 10-yard line, settling for three field goals from John Vaughn. Auburn&#x27;s defense was more than up to the challenge from the Hokies, shutting them out in the first half. Tech did not help itself, as Jesse Allen dropped an easy touchdown reception on fourth-and-goal at the Auburn 1 in the second quarter.

Auburn finally drove for a TD on the first possession of the second half, and kept their 16–0 lead into the fourth quarter. However, two second-half turnovers kept the Hokies in the game, and their offense finally awakened in the fourth quarter. Tech QB Bryan Randall threw two TD passes to Josh Howard, the last an 80-yard bomb, in the fourth quarter, cutting the Auburn lead to 16–13. The Hokies then attempted an onside kick, but the Tigers recovered and chose to run out the clock to instead of trying to score again. This preserved the Tigers&#x27; perfect 13–0 season; however, it effectively ended Auburn&#x27;s faint hopes for a split national championship.

Tigers QB Jason Campbell was the game&#x27;s MVP, completing 11 of his 16 pass attempts for 189 yards and a touchdown. However, he was intercepted once. For the Hokies, Randall went 21-for-38 passing for 299 yards and two TDs, but was intercepted twice.

===Orange Bowl===

*Southern Cal (12–0) 55, Oklahoma (12–0) 19
In the final major bowl game of the BCS, the Orange Bowl, played on January 4, 2005, the top two 12–0 teams met for the likely National Championship (see Sugar Bowl, above). The top-ranked Southern California Trojans, the Pac-10 Champions, were able to obtain the National Championship title with a huge 55–19 victory over the second-ranked and Big 12 champion Oklahoma Sooners.

An Orange Bowl record five touchdown passes were thrown by Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart, and 38 points were scored by the Trojans in the first 20 minutes of the first half alone to effectively seal the victory.

The game was billed as the Game of the Century by many. It was the first time that two teams went wire-to-wire ranked #1 and #2. It featured the winner (Leinart) and the runner-up (Oklahoma&#x27;s Adrian Peterson) in that year&#x27;s Heisman Trophy voting. USC came into the game as a slight underdog after opening as a 3-point favorite. Most of the &quot;experts&quot; predicted an Oklahoma win, calling the Trojans thin at all positions except for all-purpose threat Reggie Bush. The Sooners looked to prove the experts correct by driving the field on their first possession for a 7–0 lead. The Trojans tied the score 7–7 on a spectacular diving catch by tight end Dominique Byrd. It looked like it would be a classic back-and-forth battle until a key turnover turned the tide to USC for good. USC had just punted to Oklahoma and got a good roll inside Oklahoma&#x27;s 10-yard line. Inexplicably, Senior Mark Bradley tried to pick up the ball and promptly fumbled it away. LenDale White scored on the next play and USC never looked back. From that point on, Matt Leinart was on fire as was his primary target, Sophomore WR Steve Smith. Smith caught 3 TD passes on the night, also an Orange Bowl record. Oklahoma continued turning the ball over as the Trojan defense proved too tough all night. Freshman RB sensation Adrian Peterson was held to well under 100 yards, despite having been the first freshman to finish second in the Heisman balloting.

Many fans left after the third quarter at which point the score was 48–10, USC. After the Trojans took a 55–10 lead, Oklahoma got a safety on USC QB Matt Leinart. The Sooners followed it up with a short drive for the final points.

===USC Sanctions===
On June 10, 2010, the NCAA placed the University of Southern California (USC) on a probation period of four years, with two years without any bowl game appearances, and forfeiture of all games in which Reggie Bush (an ineligible player because of accepting payments from an agent) participated in beginning in December 2004, and therefore, includes the Orange Bowl BCS National Championship game. On June 6, 2011, the NCAA officially vacated USC&#x27;s Orange Bowl BCS National Championship game win.

==All-Star Games==

===Gridiron Classic===
In the Gridiron Classic, the first of the four post-BCS bowl games played January 15, 2005, at The Villages retirement center in Lady Lake, Florida, Marcus Randall (quarterback for LSU) ran seven out of eleven passes for 88 yards as he led the South squad to a win over the North by the score of 24–21. Randall was also declared the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

===East–West Shrine Game===
The 80th East–West Shrine Game, played January 15, 2005, (just after the Gridiron Classic) at SBC Park in San Francisco, saw two Louisville teammates, Stefan LeFors and J. R. Russell, propel the East squad to a 45–27 win over the West team. The two teams combined for 1,013 yards of offense in the highest-scoring Shrine Game since 1979.

LeFors was named the MVP for the offense, while Alex Green of Duke won the MVP for the defense.

===Las Vegas All-American Classic===
The 4th edition of the Las Vegas All-American Classic was played January 22, 2005, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The West won the game by a score of 21–16 over the East.

===Hula Bowl===
A total 92 of the best seniors in college football were represented in the January 22, 2005, version of the Hula Bowl game played in Wailuku, Hawaii. Michigan State&#x27;s Ronald Stanley scored with two defensive touchdowns to help win the game for the East over the West by the score of 20–13. For his efforts, Stanley won Most Valuable Player. This was the first time since 1996 that the Hula Bowl used the East and West squads format.

===Senior Bowl===
In the Senior Bowl, the final game of the 2004–05 college football season, Kansas State&#x27;s Darren Sproles, Akron&#x27;s Charlie Frye, and Ohio State&#x27;s Mike Nugent led the North to a 23–13 victory over the South in the annual bowl game played January 29, 2005, in Mobile, Alabama. Frye won the Most Valuable Player honors for his completion of 10 to 12 passes and making possible a 22-yard touchdown at the game&#x27;s conclusion to seal the victory for the North. Nugent scored three field goals from 25, 36, and 41 yards, respectively, while Sproles earned the North&#x27;s defensive player of the game for five carries gaining 55 yards. Leroy Hill of Clemson earned the defensive player honors for the South team.

<doc id="1247937" wikidata="Q6783578" url="?curid=1247937" title="Mason Gaffney">
<text>Merrill Mason Gaffney (October 18, 1923 – July 16, 2020) was an American economist and a major critic of Neoclassical economics from a Georgist point of view. Gaffney first read Henry George&#x27;s masterwork &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; as a high school junior. This interest led him to Harvard University in 1941 but, unimpressed with their approach to economics he left in 1942 to join the war effort. After serving in the southwest Pacific during World War II he earned his B.A. in 1948 from Reed College in Portland, Oregon. In 1956 he gained a Ph.D. in economics at the University of California, Berkeley. There he addressed his teachers&#x27; skepticism about Georgism with a dissertation titled &quot;Land Speculation as an Obstacle to Ideal Allocation of Land.&quot; Gaffney was Professor of Economics at the University of California, Riverside from 1976 onwards. He died in July 2020 at the age of 96.

==Career==
Gaffney was a professor of economics at several universities; a journalist with &quot;TIME, Inc.&quot;; a researcher with Resources for the Future; the head of the British Columbia Institute for Economic Policy Analysis, which he founded; an economic consultant to several businesses and government agencies; and a frequent speaker on economic topics, domestic and foreign, and in political campaigns. He was elected as a Director of Robert Schalkenbach Foundation in 1984.

Gaffney had a wide and varied professional career. His professional positions included:

* University of Oregon 1953-54 Instructor
* North Carolina State University 1954-1958 Assistant Professor
* University of Missouri, 1958-62 Associate Professor and Professor of Agricultural Economics
* University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee 1962-1969 Professor of Economics; department chair 1963-1965
* UCLA 1967- Visiting Professor of Economics
* Resources for the Future, Washington, DC 1969-1973 Senior Research Associate
* British Columbia Institute for Economic Policy Analysis, Victoria, B.C., 1973-1976 Founder and Director
* University of California, Riverside 1976-2012 Professor of Economics, teaching both Managerial Economics in the (Graduate School of Administration) and Economics.

==Publications==
Gaffney published many books and articles on public finance, land use, economics, taxation, and public policy. These include:

* Gaffney, M. Mason. &quot;Concepts of financial maturity of timber and other assets.&quot; (Raleigh: North Carolina State College, 1957).
* LAND: A Special Issue (of House and Home Magazine)
* Gaffney, Mason. &quot;Extractive Resources and Taxation: Proceedings&quot; (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1967) (some pages available on Dr. Gaffney&#x27;s personal site)
* Gaffney, Mason; Alaska Dept. of Natural Resources.; Alaska Legislature Interim Committee on Oil and Gas Taxation and Leasing Policy. &quot;Oil and gas leasing policy: alternatives for Alaska in 1977: a report&quot;. (1977)
* Gaffney, M. (1997). What price water marketing?: California&#x27;s new frontier. &quot;The American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 56,&quot; 475-520.
* Gaffney, M., Harrison, F., &amp; Feder, K. &quot;The Corruption of Economics.&quot; (London: Shepheard-Walwyn (Publishers) Ltd., 1994) (hardback), (paperback). In this book, Gaffney shows how Neoclassical economics was designed and promoted by landowners and their hired economists to divert attention from George&#x27;s extremely popular insight that since land and resources are provided by nature, and their value is given by society, they - rather than labor or capital - should provide the tax base to fund government and its expenditures.
* Gaffney, Mason. &quot;After the Crash: Designing A Depression Free Economy.&quot; (Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell (Publishers), 2009) (hardback), (paperback). This anthology of papers and essays by Gaffney provides a detailed explanation for the business cycle through a synthesis of Georgist, Austrian, and other schools of economic thought. It is both a pointed critique of Neoclassical economics and a prescription for a financial sector that is self-correcting, rather than crisis-prone. Includes introduction by editor Clifford Cobb. Available through the Robert Schalkenback Foundation in &quot;HardCover&quot; and &quot;Paperback &quot;.

<doc id="1247939" wikidata="Q983850" url="?curid=1247939" title="Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus">
<text>Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the ninth known human herpesvirus. It is also called Human herpesvirus 8, or HHV-8 in short. This virus causes Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, a cancer commonly occurring in AIDS patients, as well as primary effusion lymphoma, HHV-8-associated multicentric Castleman&#x27;s disease and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome. It is one of seven currently known human cancer viruses, or oncoviruses. Even after many years since the discovery of KSHV/HHV8, there is no known cure for KSHV associated tumorigenesis.

== History ==
In 1872, Moritz Kaposi described a blood vessel tumor (originally called &quot;idiopathic multiple pigmented sarcoma of the skin&quot;) that has since been eponymously named Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma (KS). KS was at first thought to be an uncommon tumor of Jewish and Mediterranean populations until it was later determined to be extremely common throughout sub-Saharan African populations. This led to the first suggestions in the 1950s that this tumor might be caused by a virus. With the onset of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, there was a sudden resurgence of KS affecting AIDS patients, with up to 50% of reported AIDS patients having this tumor—an extraordinary rate of cancer predisposition.

Careful analysis of epidemiologic data by Valerie Beral, Thomas Peterman and Harold Jaffe, led these investigators to propose that KS is caused by an unknown sexually transmitted virus that rarely causes tumors unless the host becomes immunosuppressed, as in AIDS.
As early as 1984, scientists reported seeing herpesvirus-like structures in KS tumors examined under electron microscopy. Scientists had been searching for the agent causing KS, and over 20 agents were proposed as the possible cause, including cytomegalovirus and HIV itself. The pathogen was ultimately identified in 1994 by Yuan Chang and Patrick S. Moore, a wife and husband team at Columbia University, through the isolation of DNA fragments from a herpesvirus found in a KS tumor in an AIDS patient. Chang and Moore used representational difference analysis, or RDA, to find KSHV by comparing KS tumor tissue from an AIDS patient to his own unaffected tissue. The idea behind this experiment was that if a virus causes KS, the genomic DNA in the two samples should be precisely identical except for DNA belonging to the virus. In their initial RDA experiment, they isolated two small DNA fragments that represented less than 1% of the actual viral genome. These fragments were similar (but still distinct from) the known herpevirus sequences, indicating the presence of a new virus. Starting from these fragments, this research team was then able to sequence the entire genome of the virus less than two years later.

The discovery of this herpesvirus sparked considerable controversy and scientific in-fighting until sufficient data had been collected to show that indeed KSHV was the causative agent of Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma. The virus is now known to be a widespread infection of people living in sub-Saharan Africa; intermediate levels of infection occur in Mediterranean populations (including Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Italy, and Greece) and low levels of infection occur in most Northern European and North American populations. Gay and bisexual men are more susceptible to infection (through still unknown routes of sexual transmission) whereas the virus is transmitted through non-sexual routes in developing countries.

==Virology==
KSHV is a herpesvirus, and is a large double-stranded DNA virus with a protein covering that packages its nucleic acids, called the capsid, which is then surrounded by an amorphous protein layer called the tegument, and finally enclosed in a lipid envelope derived in part from the cell membrane. KSHV has a genome which is approximately 165,000 nucleic acid bases in length. The viral genome consists of a ~145 kilobase-long unique region, encoding all of expressed viral genes, which is flanked by ~20-30 kilobases of terminal repeat sequences.
Each terminal repeat unit is 801 bp in length, has 85% G+C content and is oriented in a repetitive head-to-tail fashion. KSHV is a rhadinovirus, a Herpes genus remarkable since it has stolen numerous genes from host cells including, in the case of KSHV, genes that encode for complement-binding protein, IL-6, BCL-2, cyclin-D, a G protein-coupled receptor, interferon regulatory factor and Flice inhibitory protein (FLIP), as well as DNA synthesis proteins including dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase, thymidylate synthetase, DNA polymerase and many others. While no other human tumor virus possesses these same genes, other tumor viruses target the same cellular pathways illustrating that at a basic level, all tumor viruses appear to attack the same cellular control pathways, so-called tumor suppressor pathways.

Crucial for the entry of KSHV into cells

are the EPH receptor A2,
Hrs,
TSG101,
and a few integrins (whose identity has yet to be confirmed).
After infection, the virus enters into lymphocytes via macropinosomes.
Once the virus newly infects a cell, the lipid membrane is shed and the virion travels to the nucleus. The viral genome is released where it circularizes into an episome through a poorly understood process that appears to involve homologous recombination of the terminal repeats. The viral episome is chromatinized upon entry into the host cell nucleus.

After entry, the virus typically remains in a latent (&quot;quiet&quot;) state. Only a subset of genes that are encoded in the KSHV latency associated region (KLAR) are expressed during latency, including latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), vFLIP, vCyclin and 12 microRNAs. Latency is the hallmark of all KSHV-associated etiologies known to date including all KSHV-associated oncogenesis. It has been shown that both protein coding genes such as LANA and noncoding genes (microRNAs) encoded in KLAR are important for KSHV associated tumorigenesis. To study the functions of microRNAs, a detailed protocol of bacmid mutagenesis and a complete set of cell-lines carrying microRNA deletion mutants have been established and are available as a resource to researchers.
Additionally, it has been shown that vFLIP and vCyclin interfere with the TGF-β signaling pathway indirectly by inducing the oncogenic host mir17-92 cluster. These observations represents a novel mechanism that may be important for KSHV tumorigenesis and angiogenesis, a hallmark of KS.

During latency, LANA is the only viral protein that is required for viral replication, which is carried out by the host replication machinery. LANA tethers the viral DNA to cellular chromosomes, inhibits p53 and retinoblastoma protein and suppresses viral genes needed for full virus production and assembly (&quot;lytic replication&quot;). Why only a subset of virus genes expressed during latency is not fully understood. But it has been shown that the latency associated gene expression can be explained in part by a characteristic epigenetic state that KSHV episome acquires during latency. LANA plays an important role during latency, regulating both host and virus transcripts and binding to multiple active promoters; it also associates with the host protein hSET1 that creates H3K4me3 marks in chromatin.

Various signals such as inflammation may provoke the virus to enter into lytic replication. The primary viral protein responsible for the switch between latent and lytic replication is known as the ORF50 Replication Transactivation Activator (RTA). When cell signaling conditions activate the generation of RTA, it in turn activates synthesis of a stereotypic cascade of secondary and tertiary viral proteins that ultimately make components of the virus capsid and also the DNA synthesis enzymes required to replicate the virus genome.
During lytic replication, it is believed that the virus genome is replicated as a continuous linear molecule off of an episome (so-called rolling circle model). As each unit genome is replicated, it is cut within the terminal repeat region, and then packaged into a virus particle (virion). The virus then becomes enveloped with a lipid membrane as it transits the nucleus and the cytoplasm to exit the cell. Thus, whereas KSHV genome is circular in the nucleus of latently infected cells, it is packaged into infectious viruses as a linear molecule. When the virus enters into lytic replication, thousands of virus particles can be made from a single cell, which usually results in death of the infected cell.

===COVID-19 and KSHV===
It was discovered in 2020 that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus which causes COVID-19, may induce the lytic reactivation of KSHV in the human body, causing the herpes virus to cease latency and begin the formation of cancerous cells. Further, it was discovered that some medications used to treat the infection with SARS-CoV-2, namely Nafamostat and Azithromycin, ended up promoting the production of mature virions, &quot;... potentially inducing KSHV lytic reactivation.&quot;

== Pathophysiology ==
The mechanisms by which the virus is contracted are not well understood. Healthy individuals can be infected with the virus and show no signs or symptoms, due to the immune system&#x27;s ability to keep the infection in check. Infection is of particular concern to the immunocompromised. Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, AIDS patients, and organ transplant patients are all at a high risk of showing signs of infection..

Recent advances in sequencing technologies have uncovered that virus is chromatinized during latency. It has also been shown that virus encoded microRNA manipulates and interacts not only with host mRNA but also deregulate host long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). More recently, circularRNAs (circRNAs) are recently discovered in both EBV and KSHV 

Infection with this virus is thought to be lifelong, but a healthy immune system will keep the virus in check. Many people infected with KSHV will never show any symptoms. Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma occurs when someone who has been infected with KSHV becomes immunocompromised due to AIDS, medical treatment, or, very rarely, aging.

KSHV is a known causative agent of four diseases:
* Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma – an angioproliferative tumor that can involve skin (most often), lymph nodes, or viscera,
* HHV-8-associated multicentric Castleman&#x27;s disease – a lymphoproliferative disorder,
* Primary effusion lymphoma – KSHV-associated aggressive lymphoma involving B-cells that are immature plasma cells termed plasmablasts and regarded as one type of lymphoid neoplasms with plasmablastic differentiation,
* KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome – a syndrome with MCD-like symptoms but without associated pathology.

==Epidemiology==
In the 1970s, the global prevalence rate for HHV-8 was 2 to 10%. The seroprevalence of HHV-8 varies significantly geographically and infection rates in northern European, southeast Asian, and Caribbean countries are between 2-4%, in Mediterranean countries at approximately 10%, and in sub-Saharan African countries at approximately 40%. In South America, infection rates are low in general but are high among Amerindians. Even within individual countries, significant variation can be observed across different regions, with infection rates of about 19.2% in Xinjiang compared to about 9.5% in Hubei, China. Although seroprevalence has been consistently shown to increase with age in a linear manner, countries with high infection rates may see higher seroprevalence in younger age groups. Educational level has shown an inverse correlation with infection rates. Individuals infected with HIV-1 or genital warts are generally more likely to be co-infected with HHV-8.

In countries with low seroprevalence, HHV-8 is primarily limited to AIDS and KS patients. In countries with high seroprevalence, infection is frequent in childhood, indicating a likely mother-to-child transmission by saliva. In a Zambian survey, all children with KS had mothers who were positive for HHV-8, whereas not all children whose mothers had KS were HHV-8 positive. In another Zambian survey, 13.8% of children were seropositive for HHV-8 by age 4. Seroprevalence has not been shown to vary significantly because of gender or marital status.

==Evolution==

The most recent common ancestor of this virus in the Mediterranean, Iran, and Xinjiang, China, has been estimated to have evolved 29,872 years (95% highest probability density 26,851–32,760 years) ago. the most recent common ancestor for viruses isolated in Xinjiang was 2037 years (95% highest probability density 1843–2229 years) ago. Given the historical links between the Mediterranean and Xinjiang during the Roman period it seems likely that this virus was introduced to Xinjiang along the Silk Road. The mutation rate was estimated to be substitutions per site per year (95% highest probability density to ). However, the global distribution of different genotypes of KSHV and the potential transmission path need further studies.

Typing of isolates is based on the variable K1 membrane protein. Six types are recognised (A–F).

==Prevention==
Since persons infected with KSHV will asymptomatically give the virus, caution should be used by sex partners in having unprotected sex and activities where saliva might be shared during sexual activity. Prudent advice is to use condoms when needed and avoid deep kissing with partners who may have KSHV infections.

==Treatment==
Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma is usually a localized tumor that can be treated either surgically or through local irradiation. Chemotherapy with drugs such as liposomal anthracyclines or paclitaxel may be used, particularly for invasive disease. Antiviral drugs, such as ganciclovir, that target the replication of herpesviruses such as KSHV have been used to successfully prevent development of Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, although once the tumor develops these drugs are of little or no use. For patients with AIDS-KS, the most effective therapy is highly active antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV infection. AIDS patients receiving adequate anti-HIV treatment may have up to a 90% reduction in Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma occurrence.

Although KSHV affects the host immune system, there is ample chance for clinical intervention to recover this change. One challenge is overexpression inhibitory of target cell repress immune. Under longtime inflammation stimulation, the target cell becomes unable to respond, which leads to an exhausted phenotype. The activation immunotherapies can revive and enhance immune cell function. Comparing to other immunotherapies, therapies targeting the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has been a great success. Because of KSHV infection, the monocytes increase the expression of PD-1, which is an inhibitory molecule, and cause immune escape in many tumor types. There is high PD-1 expression in NK cells from KS-HIV patients and cause exhausted phenotype. The anti-PD-1 antibody, (nivolumab or pembrolizumab), demonstrated a significant antitumor effect. Nivolumab is currently an ongoing phase I clinical trial, and Pembrolizumab has shown its function in treatment for HIV and KS patients in phase I and is in a phase II trial for treatment. A thalidomide analog medicine – Pomalidomide was also granted by the FDA in 2011. Pomalidomide was shown to recover the expression of MHC-1, which help cell display intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells, and it also can repress the expression of PD-L1 and increase the CD8+ T cell killing.

== KSHV genes ==
KSHV encodes for ~90 genes and multiple non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs. The &quot;ORF&quot; genes are named based on genome position of the homologous genes in the first rhadinovirus described, herpesvirus saimiri.

<text>The chorale motet was a type of musical composition in mostly Protestant parts of Europe, principally Germany, and mainly during the 16th century. It involved setting a chorale melody and text as a motet.

Stylistically chorale motets were similar at first to motets composed in Catholic countries, and made use of the full range of techniques of Franco-Flemish polyphony. In the earlier period, the chorale was typically used as a cantus firmus, fairly easy to hear, with other lines either weaving in and out contrapuntally around it, or following along in the same rhythm in an entirely homophonic style. Later in the century, especially around 1600, the successive verses of the chorale were used to begin imitative sections in a fugal style. Shortly after 1600 the form began to disappear, overtaken by newer forms based on Italian (especially Venetian) models: the chorale concerto, and later the chorale cantata. The chorale cantata was to become the most substantial of the descendants of the chorale motet, and eventually culminated in the work of J.S. Bach.

Composers of early chorale motets included Johann Walter, who typically used a cantus firmus type of motet setting; Balthasar Resinarius, who wrote in the complex polyphonic style; , who chose the simpler homophonic style; and Ludwig Senfl, Lupus Hellinck, Thomas Stoltzer, and others. Some of these composers were Roman Catholic: the Thirty Years&#x27; War had not yet torn Germany apart, and composers from both branches of Christianity were still mixing freely.

Between the late 1560s and the early 1580s, the renowned composer Orlande de Lassus, who was working in Munich, contributed several volumes of chorale motets of his own: &quot;Newe Teütsche Liedlein mit fünf Stimmen&quot; (books 1 and 2) and &quot;Newe teutsche Lieder&quot;. In these motets the voices are equally balanced, as in the style of Palestrina.

Around 1600 a new group of composers, many of whom had studied in Italy, brought new ideas to the chorale motet. Some of these composers were among the most famous and talented in Europe, including Melchior Franck, Hans Leo Hassler, and the spectacularly prolific Michael Praetorius. Praetorius&#x27;s &quot;Musae Sioniae&quot; (1605-1610), an enormous collection of approximately 1200 pieces, includes some of the finest and most advanced examples of the form; however, by this time the chorale concerto and other types of chorale settings were beginning to eclipse the chorale motet as a primary means of expression for the German chorale.

Bach&#x27;s son Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach composed a motet in three movements in the second half of the 18th century, &quot;Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme&quot;, still using Baroques techniques such as a chorale fantasia on Nicolai&#x27;s &quot;Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme&quot; and the inclusion of a setting by his father.

<text>Terrence Dewayne McGee (born October 14, 1980) is an American former professional football cornerback and return specialist who played in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Northwestern State Demons and was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the fourth round of the 2003 NFL draft. During his career, McGee was considered a versatile threat for his kick return skills as well as his defensive play.

== Early life and college ==
Terrence McGee grew up in Athens, Texas with his mother and brother, the latter of whom has been incarcerated since 1993. One of his hobbies outside of playing football included drawing with charcoal.

McGee attended Northwestern State University, where he played on the football team for four years. He saw sporadic snaps at cornerback in his freshman season before taking on punt return duty the following season, setting the NCAA FCS record with a 23.7 yard average on returns that year with three return touchdowns as a sophomore and earning All-America honors. As the Demons made the FCS playoffs in two consecutive years, McGee became one of the top FCS cornerbacks and even played safety and receiver his final year. He broke up 44 passes and collected 11 interceptions during his college career.

== Professional career ==
McGee was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the fourth round of the 2003 NFL draft. In his rookie season, McGee intercepted two passes and forced a fumble as a part-time player.

After the departure of Antoine Winfield, the Bills acquired CB Troy Vincent who was injured and replaced. McGee was inserted as a starting cornerback alongside Nate Clements. During the 2004 season, McGee returned three kickoffs for touchdowns, leading Buffalo as it totaled six total kick return touchdowns on the year, which remains an NFL record.

On Christmas Eve 2005 against the Cincinnati Bengals, he became the first player to score touchdowns on an interception and a kick return in the same game. In 2006, he ran a fumble back for a touchdown in a 17–16 loss against the Indianapolis Colts.

McGee exhibited his speed in a Monday Night game against the Dallas Cowboys in 2007. Six minutes into the third quarter, McGee returned a kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown.

McGee signed a contract extension in September 2009. On December 22, 2009, McGee was placed on Injured Reserve due to a shoulder injury.

On February 14, 2013, McGee was cut by the Bills after a few more injury-plagued seasons and he retired shortly afterwards. He played in 122 games, starting 90 of them, and retains numerous cornerback and kick return records for the franchise to this day, making the Pro Bowl once and being named an All-Pro twice.

=== Bills franchise records ===
* Most career kickoff return yards (5,450)
* Most career kickoff return touchdowns (5)
* Longest Kickoff return touchdown: 104
* Most career fumble return yards (106)
* Most passes defended (99)

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal life==
In 2010, McGee donated $25,000 to the Northwestern State athletic department, which at the time was the largest single donation by a former NSU player still professionally active.

Along with prominent local figures and fellow Bills alumni Fred Jackson and Brian Moorman, he operates SEAR, a high-end steakhouse in downtown Buffalo.
