<text>Jay Van Andel (June 3, 1924 – December 7, 2004) was an American billionaire businessman, best known as co-founder of the Amway Corporation, along with Richard DeVos.

He also served as chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce from 1979 to 1980.

== Early life ==
Jay Van Andel was born on June 3, 1924, to James and Petronilla (Van der Woude) Van Andel in Grand Rapids, Michigan. His grandparents, Christian and Elizabeth had immigrated to America from the Netherlands in 1909.

Van Andel&#x27;s parents were devout Christians and members of the Christian Reformed Church. Jay credits his Christian background as being foundational for the rest of his life as a Christian. He once wrote, &quot;Christianity involved the living out of Biblical values of honesty, generosity, and respect for others in our everyday life.&quot;

Jay attended Grand Rapids Christian High School. Later, Van Andel attended Calvin College and Pratt Business School in Kansas.

When World War II broke out, Jay served as a United States Army Air Force officer. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and trained crews for B-17 and B-29 bombers that reached the Japanese mainland.

Jay met his wife Betty Jean Hoekstra while on a direct selling house call in the spring of 1951. They married on August 16, 1952.

== Amway ==
While attending the Grand Rapids Christian High School before World War II, Jay Van Andel met Rich DeVos. In 1949, Van Andel and DeVos became distributors of Nutrilite dietary supplements. They added cleaning products including Liquid Organic Cleaner, to their core line of products in 1958. In 1959, the &quot;American Way Association&quot; began in the basements of the Van Andel and DeVos homes, and later that year &quot;Amway Sales Corporation&quot; was formed. A converted service station became Amway&#x27;s first outside office building in 1960.

Today, Amway is a direct selling multinational company that sells a variety of health, beauty, and home care products. Amway went on to become the largest direct selling company in the world. Amway corporate reports that in 2019, they have over 3 million independent business owners (IBO&#x27;s) in over 100 countries.

== Van Andel Institute ==
In 1996, Van Andel founded Van Andel Institute with his wife Betty. The 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and focuses on disease research and science education. Researchers look for ways to better diagnose and treat diseases, primarily cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x27;s. Education programs seek to inspire and prepare students to become the next generation of researchers.

Since 1996, the Van Andel Institute is led by Jay&#x27;s son, David Van Andel, as Chairman and CEO.

== Political activity and philanthropy ==
A strong supporter of the Republican Party, Van Andel contributed $2 million to the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush, and $475,000 to the Michigan State Republican Party (mostly for state legislature candidates) in 2004 alone. He was noted for his friendship with former President Gerald R. Ford, a native of Grand Rapids, who lamented his death and called him &quot;a great family man and a worldwide leader in the business arena&quot;. Steve Forbes wrote, &quot;Whether in business or philanthropy, Van Andel understood that the primary goal was to serve the needs and wants of other people. He exemplified the best of America&quot;.

== Awards ==
In 1981, Van Andel received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1993, Jay Van Andel was honored with an Edison Achievement Award for his commitment to innovation throughout his career.

== Death ==
Van Andel and his wife Betty both died in 2004; Betty had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and Jay had Parkinson&#x27;s. He was 80.

<text>Tasmania, the largest island of Australia, has a landmass of and is located directly in the pathway of the notorious &quot;Roaring Forties&quot; wind that encircles the globe. To its north, it is separated from mainland Australia by Bass Strait. Tasmania is the only Australian state that is not located on the Australian mainland. About south of Tasmania island lies the George V Coast of Antarctica. Depending on which borders of the oceans are used, the island can be said to be either surrounded by the Southern Ocean, or to have the Pacific on its east and the Indian to its west. Still other definitions of the ocean boundaries would have Tasmania with the Great Australian Bight to the west, and the Tasman Sea to the east. The southernmost point on mainland Tasmania is approximately at South East Cape, and the northernmost point on mainland Tasmania is approximately in Woolnorth / Temdudheker near Cape Grim / Kennaook. Tasmania lies at similar latitudes to Te Waipounamu / South Island of New Zealand, and parts of Patagonia in South America, and relative to the Northern Hemisphere, it lies at similar latitudes to Hokkaido in Japan, Northeast China (Manchuria), the north Mediterranean in Europe, and the Canada-United States border. 

The most mountainous region is the Central Highlands area, which covers most of the central western parts of the state. The Midlands located in the central east, is fairly flat, and is predominantly used for agriculture, although farming activity is scattered throughout the state. Tasmania&#x27;s tallest mountain is Mount Ossa at . Much of Tasmania is still densely forested, with the Southwest National Park and neighbouring areas holding some of the last temperate rain forests in the Southern Hemisphere. The Tarkine, containing Savage River National Park located in the island&#x27;s far north west, is the largest temperate rainforest area in Australia covering about . With its rugged topography, Tasmania has a great number of rivers. Several of Tasmania&#x27;s largest rivers have been dammed at some point to provide hydroelectricity. Many rivers begin in the Central Highlands and flow out to the coast. Tasmania&#x27;s major population centres are mainly situated around estuaries (some of which are named rivers).

Tasmania is in the shape of a downward-facing triangle, likened to a shield, heart, or face. It consists of the main island as well as at least a thousand neighbouring islands within the state&#x27;s jurisdiction. The largest of these are Flinders Island in the Furneaux Group of Bass Strait, King Island in the west of Bass Strait, Cape Barren Island south of Flinders Island, Bruny Island separated from Tasmania by the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Channel, Macquarie Island 1,500 km from Tasmania, and Maria Island off the east coast. 
Tasmania features a number of separated and continuous mountain ranges. The majority of the state is defined by a significant dolerite exposure, though the western half of the state is older and more rugged, featuring buttongrass plains, temperate rainforests, and quartzite ranges, notably Federation Peak and Frenchmans Cap. The presence of these mountain ranges is a primary factor in the rain shadow effect, where the western half receives the majority of rainfall, which also influences the types of vegetation that can grow. The Central Highlands feature a large plateau which forms a number of ranges and escarpments on its north side, tapering off along the south, and radiating into the highest mountain ranges in the west. At the north-west of this, another plateau radiates into a system of hills where takayna / Tarkine is located.

The Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia divides Tasmania into 9 bioregions: 
Ben Lomond, Furneaux, King, Central Highlands, Northern Midlands, Northern Slopes, Southern Ranges, South East, and West.

==Environment== 
Tasmania&#x27;s environment consists of many different biomes or communities across its different regions. It is the most forested state in Australia, and preserves the country&#x27;s largest areas of temperate rainforest. A distinctive type of moorland found across the west, and particularly south-west of Tasmania, are buttongrass plains, which are speculated to have been expanded by Tasmanian Aboriginal burning practices. Tasmania also features a diverse alpine garden environment, such as cushion plant. Highland areas receive consistent snowfall above ~1,000 metres every year, and due to cold air from Antarctica, this level often reaches 800 m, and more occasionally 600 or 400 metres. Every five or so years, snow can form at sea level. This environment gives rise to the cypress forests of the Central Plateau and mountainous highlands. In particular, the Walls of Jerusalem with large areas of rare pencil pine, and its closest relative King Billy pine. On the West Coast Range and partially on Mount Field, Australia&#x27;s only winter-deciduous plant, deciduous beech is found, which forms a carpet or krummholz, or very rarely a 4-metre tree.

Tasmania features a high concentration of waterfalls. These can be found in small creeks, alpine streams, rapid rivers, or off precipitous plunges. Some of the tallest waterfalls are found on mountain massifs, sometimes at a 200-metre cascade. The most famous and most visited waterfall in Tasmania is Russell Falls in Mount Field due to its proximity to Hobart and stepped falls at a total height of 58 metres. 
Tasmania also has a large number of beaches, the longest of which is Ocean Beach on the West Coast at about 40 kilometres. Wineglass Bay in Freycinet on the east coast is a well-known landmark of the state.

The Tasmanian temperate rainforests cover a few different types. These are also considered distinct from the more common wet sclerophyll forests, though these eucalypt forests often form with rainforest understorey and ferns (such as tree-ferns) are usually never absent. Rainforest found in deep gullies are usually difficult to traverse due to dense understorey growth, such as from horizontal (&quot;Anodopetalum biglandulosum&quot;). Higher-elevation forests (~500 to 800 m) have smaller ground vegetation and are thus easier to walk in. The most common rainforests usually have a 50-metre canopy and are varied by environmental factors. Emergent growth usually comes from eucalyptus, which can tower another 50 metres higher (usually less), providing the most common choice of nesting for giant wedge-tailed eagles.

The human environment ranges from urban or industrial development, to farming or grazing land. The most cultivated area is the Midlands, where it has suitable soil but is also the driest part of the state.

===Insularity===
Tasmania&#x27;s was possibly detected by Captain Abel Tasman when he charted Tasmania&#x27;s coast in 1642. On 5 December, Tasman was following the east coast northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at Eddystone Point, he tried to keep in with it but his ships were suddenly hit by the Roaring Forties howling through Bass Strait. Tasman was on a mission to find the Southern Continent, not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting.

The next European to enter the strait was Captain James Cook on HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; in April 1770. However, after sailing for two hours westward into the strait against the wind, he turned back east and noted in his journal that he was &quot;doubtful whether they [i.e. Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and New Holland] are one land or no&quot;.

The strait was named after George Bass, after he and Matthew Flinders passed through it while circumnavigating Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in the &quot;Norfolk&quot; in 1798–99. At Flinders&#x27; recommendation, the Governor of New South Wales, John Hunter, in 1800 named the stretch of water between the mainland and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land &quot;Bass&#x27;s Straits&quot;. Later it became known as Bass Strait.

The existence of the strait had been suggested in 1797 by the master of Sydney Cove when he reached Sydney after deliberately grounding his foundering ship and being stranded on Preservation Island (at the eastern end of the strait). He reported that the strong south westerly swell and the tides and currents suggested that the island was in a channel linking the Pacific and southern Indian Ocean. Governor Hunter thus wrote to Joseph Banks in August 1797 that it seemed certain a strait existed.

==Climate==


Tasmania has a relatively cool temperate climate compared to the rest of Australia, spared from the hot summers of the mainland and experiencing four distinct seasons. Summer is from December to February when the average maximum sea temperature is and inland areas around Launceston reach . Other inland areas are much cooler, with Liawenee, located on the Central Plateau, one of the coldest places in Australia, ranging between and in February. Autumn is from March to May, with mostly settled weather, as summer patterns gradually take on the shape of winter patterns. The winter months are from June to August, and are generally the wettest and coldest months in the state, with most high lying areas receiving considerable snowfall. Winter maximums are on average along coastal areas and on the central plateau, as a result of a series of cold fronts from the Southern Ocean. Inland areas receive regular freezes throughout the winter months. Spring is from September to November, and is an unsettled season of transition, where winter weather patterns begin to take the shape of summer patterns, although snowfall is still common up until October. Spring is generally the windiest time of the year with afternoon sea breezes starting to take effect on the coast.

===Climate data===





==Soil==
Despite the presence of some Quaternary glaciation, Tasmania&#x27;s soils are not more fertile than those of mainland Australia, largely because most are severely leached and the areas with driest climates (least leaching) were unaffected by glaciation or alluvia derived therefrom. Most soils on the Bass Strait Islands, the east coast and western Tasmania are very infertile spodosols or psamments, with some even less fertile &quot;lateritic podzolic soils&quot; in the latter region. Most of these lands are thus not used for agriculture, but there is much productive forestry in Tasmania—which remains one of the state&#x27;s major industries.

On the north coast, apart from some relatively fertile soils used for fruit-growing, there are also deep red, easily workable soils known as &quot;krasnozems&quot; (&quot;red land&quot;). These soils are highly acidic and fix phosphate very effectively, but their extremely favourable physical properties make them extensively used for dairying, beef cattle and fodder crops.

The Midlands and the Lower Derwent present a different story from the rest of the state. Owing to a relatively dry climate and alkaline (mostly dolerite) parent material, these soils are relatively unleached and contain lime in the deeper subsoil. They are mostly classified as &quot;prairie soils&quot; or &quot;brown earths&quot; and bear some resemblance to the chernozems of Russia and North America, although they are much lower in available phosphorus and somewhat acidic in the surface levels. Their higher nutrient levels, however, allow them to support productive pasture, and large numbers of sheep are grazed in these regions. Some grain crops are also grown in the driest areas. In the alluvial areas of southeastern Tasmania, rich alluvial soils permit apples to be grown.

Tasmania became known as the &quot;Apple Isle&quot; because for many years it was one of the world&#x27;s major apple producers. Apples are still grown in large numbers, particularly in southern Tasmania.

==Ecology and conservation==
===Flora and fauna===
Tasmania has extremely diverse vegetation, from the heavily grazed grassland of the dry Midlands to the tall evergreen eucalypt forest, alpine heathlands and large areas of cool temperate rainforests and moorlands in the rest of the state. Many species are unique to Tasmania and some are related to species in South America and New Zealand through ancestors which grew on the supercontinent of Gondwana, 50 million years ago. &quot;Nothofagus gunnii&quot;, commonly known as Australian beech, is Australia&#x27;s only temperate native deciduous tree and is found exclusively in Tasmania. &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; (mountain ash) is the tallest flowering plant and hardwood in the world, reaching 100 m (328 ft).

Tasmania also has a number of native edibles, known as bush tucker in Australia.

Tasmania has many endemic species. Some, such as the platypus are larger than their mainland relatives.
The island of Tasmania was home to the thylacine, a marsupial which resembled a fossa or some say a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia much earlier because of competition by the dingo, introduced in prehistoric times. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, it appears to have been exterminated in Tasmania. The Tasmanian devil became the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world following the extinction of the thylacine in 1936, and is now found in the wild only in Tasmania. Tasmania was one of the last regions of Australia to be introduced to domesticated dogs. Dogs were brought from Britain in 1803 for hunting kangaroos and emus. This introduction completely transformed Aboriginal society, as it helped them to successfully compete with European hunters, and was more important than the introduction of guns for the Aboriginal people.

Tasmania is a hotspot for giant habitat trees and the large animal species that occupy them, notably the endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax fleayi&quot;), the Tasmanian masked owl (&quot;Tyto novaehollandiae castanops&quot;), the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish (&quot;Astacopsis gouldi&quot;), the yellow wattlebird (&quot;Anthochaera paradoxa&quot;), the green rosella (&quot;Platycercus caledonicus&quot;) and others. Tasmania is also home to the world&#x27;s only three migratory parrots, the critically endangered Orange-bellied parrot (&quot;Neophema chrysogaster&quot;), the Blue-winged parrot (&quot;Neophema chrysostoma&quot;), and the fastest parrot in the world, the swift parrot (&quot;Lathamus discolor&quot;).
Tasmania has 12 endemic species of bird in total.

===Conservation===
Like the rest of Australia, Tasmania suffers from an endangered species problem. In particular, many important Tasmanian subspecies and world-significant species of animal are classified as at risk in some way. A famous example is the Tasmanian devil, which is endangered due to devil facial tumour disease. Some species have already gone extinct, primarily due to human interference, such as in the case of the thylacine or the Tasmanian emu. In Tasmania, there are about 90 endangered, vulnerable, or threatened vertebrate species classified by the state or Commonwealth governments. Because of a reliance on roads and private vehicle transport, and a high concentration of animal populations divided by this development, Tasmania has the worst (per kilometre) roadkill rate in the world, with 32 animals killed per hour and at least 300,000 per year.

Protected areas of Tasmania cover 21% of the island&#x27;s land area in the form of national parks. The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area was inscribed by UNESCO in 1982, where it is globally significant because &quot;most UNESCO World Heritage sites meet only one or two of the ten criteria for that status. The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area meets 7 out of 10 criteria. Only one other place on earth—China’s Mount Taishan—meets that many criteria&quot;. 
Controversy surrounds the decision in 2014 by the Abbott federal Liberal government to request the area&#x27;s delisting and opening for resource exploration (before it was rejected by the UN Committee at Doha), and the current mining and deforestation in the state&#x27;s Tarkine region, the largest single temperate rainforest in Australia.

<text>Joshua Bishop Kelley (born January 30, 1980) is an American musician and singer-songwriter. Kelley has recorded for Hollywood Records, Threshold Records and DNK Records as a pop rock artist. His songs &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Only You&quot; reached the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Top 40 chart.

In 2010, Kelley signed to MCA Nashville and began a country music career. His debut country single, &quot;Georgia Clay&quot;, reached the top 20 on the Hot Country Songs charts.

Kelley is married to actress and model Katherine Heigl. They have three children.

==Early life==
Kelley was born in Augusta, Georgia, to Dr. John W. Kelley, a cardiologist, and Gayle Kelley. Kelley began his musical career at the age of 11. His younger brother, Charles Kelley, is a musician and singer in the country trio Lady A. When he was a teenager, Kelley and his brother Charles formed a band called Inside Blue. By the time he was 14, the band released a CD with five songs on it, which led to a meeting with James Brown. Kelley played the guitar in the high school jazz band alongside Charles (drums) and Dave Haywood (guitar) from Lady A.

Kelley attended the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi, and is a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.

==Music career==
Kelley released his independent album, &quot;Changing Faces&quot;, in 2001 and signed with Hollywood Records in 2002. Working with John Alagia as his record producer, Kelley released the album, &quot;For the Ride Home&quot;, on June 3, 2003.

Even though Kelley has stated that the lyrics from his song &quot;Angeles&quot; were fabricated, he moved to Los Angeles from Georgia and recorded the majority of his second album, &quot;Almost Honest&quot;, in the studio of his home. &quot;Almost Honest&quot; was released on August 23, 2005, and featured the hit single, &quot;Only You.&quot;

After asking to be released from his contract with Hollywood Records, Kelley released his third album, &quot;Just Say The Word&quot; under his own label, Threshold. The digital version of the album was released through iTunes on June 6, 2006, while the physical album was released in stores in the United States on July 25, 2006. &quot;The Pop Game&quot; was the first single from his self-produced album and was accompanied by a cartoon video.

Kelley&#x27;s next album, &quot;Special Company&quot;, was released in the United States on January 14, 2008. His label, Threshold, was renamed DNK Records so as to avoid confusion with another record label by the same name. Kelley also released a digital album that summer titled &quot;Backwoods&quot; on July 7. On September 23 of that year, Kelley released the album &quot;To Remember&quot; exclusively through Target stores. The title track was also included on the AT&amp;T Team USA Soundtrack.

Kelley is a supporter of file sharing applications for independent artists who have a difficult time receiving an audience. In fact, Kelley was &quot;found&quot; after targeting Eric Clinger at Hollywood Records with private spam, &quot;If you like James Taylor, Try Josh Kelley,&quot; messages using the Napster program.

In November 2009, Kelley signed with MCA Nashville and began recording his first country album in 2010. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Georgia Clay&quot;, was released to country radio in August 2010. The single became a Top 20 hit on the Hot Country Songs chart. The album, also entitled &quot;Georgia Clay&quot;, was released in March 2011.

Kelley released the album &quot;New Lane Road&quot; in 2016.

==Personal life==
Kelley met actress Katherine Heigl in spring 2005 when she appeared in his music video &quot;Only You&quot;. One year later, in June 2006, they became engaged. He wrote the song &quot;Hey Katie&quot; for Heigl. The Heigl-Kelley wedding took place on December 23, 2007, at the Stein Eriksen Lodge in Park City, Utah. Heigl&#x27;s &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; co-stars T.R. Knight, Sandra Oh, Ellen Pompeo and Justin Chambers attended the ceremony, as well as &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; spinoff series &quot;Private Practice&quot; star Kate Walsh. The ceremony was officiated by Unitarian minister Tom Goldsmith. Heigl walked down the aisle to an acoustic song written by Kelley and performed by a cello and guitar players. The couple wrote their own vows.

During a taping of &quot;Live With Regis and Kelly&quot;, Heigl stated that she and Kelley chose not to live together before they were married, saying, &quot;I think I just wanted to save something for the actual marriage... I wanted there to be something to make the actual marriage different than the dating or the courtship.&quot;

In 2009, the couple adopted a South Korean baby girl, naming her Nancy Leigh, after Heigl&#x27;s mother and her adopted, Korean-born older sister, respectively. Nancy Leigh&#x27;s nickname is Naleigh. Nancy Leigh was born with a congenital heart defect that was repaired with open heart surgery before she left South Korea. Kelley and Heigl adopted a second daughter, Adalaide Marie Hope, in April 2012.

In addition to their two daughters, Josh Kelley and Katherine Heigl have a son, Joshua Bishop Kelley Jr., born December 20, 2016.

Kelley, Heigl, and their children live in Oakley, Utah.

<doc id="1255389" wikidata="Q1701363" url="?curid=1255389" title="John Paul Goode">
<text>John Paul Goode (21 November 1862 – 5 August 1932), a geographer and cartographer, was one of the key geographers in American geography&#x27;s Incipient Period from 1900 to 1940 (McMaster and McMaster 306). Goode was born in Stewartville, Minnesota on November 21, 1862. Goode received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Minnesota 1889 and his doctorate in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1903. Goode got his first teaching job at Moorhead Normal School in 1889 where he taught geology, chemistry, physics, anatomy, botany and physiology. He married Ida Katherine Hancock, a physiology and arithmetic instructor at the school since 1897, in 1901 in Crookston, MN. 
By late 1901, Goode and Ida moved to Charleston, IL as a member of the faculty at Eastern Illinois State Normal School (now Eastern Illinois University), where he taught physics and geography (Eastern Illinois University iv). Later on in 1903, he was offered a position as a professor in the Geography Department at the University of Chicago (Haas and Ward 241, 243).

== Evil Mercator ==

In 1908, Goode spoke at an American Association of Geographers meeting in Baltimore, USA about the creating an alternative to the “Evil Mercator” (Hass and Ward 244). The Mercator projection has severe distortion at the poles and northern latitudes. Goode merged the homolographic and sinusoidal projections at 40° 44’ 11.8” N and S to make the Goode Interrupted Homolosine projection (Stienwand 1). The “homolo” coming from homolographic, and the “sine” originating from sinusoidal. He calculated the latitude where the two projections had the same scale and therefore should be merged by overlaying the two projections on each other.
Above and below 40° 44’ 11.8” N and S respectively, the homolographic projection is used. Between those two latitudes the sinusoidal projection is inserted. The Interrupted Homolosine projection is a pseudo-cylindrical, equal area projection. Initially, Goode&#x27;s Homolosine projection did not have universal appeal. The United States not being at the center of the map challenged the cartographic culture of the time (Schulten 187).

== &quot;Goode&#x27;s Atlas&quot; ==

Two of Goode&#x27;s former students (Leppard and Espenshade) helped him create &quot;Goode&#x27;s School Atlas&quot; (later retitled &quot;Goode&#x27;s World Atlas&quot;), first published in 1923 by Rand McNally. Goode claimed that “[E]very square inch in the map represents the same number of square miles of the earth&#x27;s surface as any other square inch in the map” (Schulten p187). The atlas is still published today, now in its 23rd edition.

By 1928, under failing health and 66 years old, Goode had a heart attack. 

In 1930, seeing that technology had made the political framework of the United States redundant (a framework laid down when it took a courier on horseback one full day to traverse a county), Goode presented a plan for a new 50 state union to replace the then 48 states. 31 of the existing states were to be retained, 17 would be converted to 8 and to these would be added 11 city-states comprising the largest metropolitan areas of the time. (Chase 256). 

On August 5, 1932, John Paul Goode died at age 69 (Hass and Ward p. 246).

<text>Francis Jardine Bell (January 28, 1840February 13, 1927) was a British North American-born American politician who was the sixth governor of Nevada. He was a member of the Republican Party.

==Biography==
Bell was born on January 28, 1840, in Toronto, in the province of Upper Canada (a British colony at the time; Confederation would not be achieved until another 27 years after his birth). He was educated in the common schools of his native country. He was a distant cousin to Alexander Graham Bell. He married Mary Poore on July 9, 1872, in Reno, Nevada and they had two children.

==Career==
Bell came to Nevada in 1858, to supervise the construction of a transcontinental telegraph line though the state from Utah to California. He worked on this project until 1860. Later, Bell became a telegraph operator and was one of operators who telegraphed Nevada&#x27;s Constitution to Washington D.C. in 1864.

Bell served as warden of the Nevada State Prison from 1883 to 1887. In 1889, he was appointed the eighth lieutenant governor by Charles C. Stevenson. He became acting governor when Governor Stevenson signed a disability certificate on September 1, 1890, making him Nevada&#x27;s first foreign-born governor. During his tenure, he continued to carry out the policies of the Stevenson administration.

Bell did not seek a full term, serving until the inauguration of Roswell K. Colcord in 1891. He then returned to his work in the telephone and telegraph field. He continued to be politically active. He served as Warden of the Nevada State Prison from 1893 to 1895 and as justice of the peace from 1905 to 1909.

==Death==
Bell died on February 13, 1927, in his daughter&#x27;s home in Oakland, California, at the age of 87. He is interred at Masonic Memorial Gardens in Reno, Nevada.

<doc id="1255394" wikidata="Q1138734" url="?curid=1255394" title="Hayashi Tadasu">
<text>was a Japanese career diplomat and cabinet minister of Meiji-era Japan.

== Early life ==
He was born Satō Shingoro in Sakura city, Shimōsa Province (present-day Chiba prefecture), as the son of Satō Taizen, a physician practising &quot;Dutch medicine&quot; for the Sakura Domain. He sometimes referred to himself as &quot;Satō Tosaburō&quot;. He was adopted as a child by Hayashi Dokai, a physician in the service of the Tokugawa shogunate, from whom he received the name Hayashi Tadasu. He learned English at the Hepburn Academy (the forerunner of Meiji Gakuin University) in Yokohama.

From 1866 to 1868, Hayashi studied in Great Britain at University College School and King&#x27;s College London as one of fourteen young Japanese students (including Kikuchi Dairoku) sent by the Tokugawa government on the advice of the then British foreign minister Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby.

Hayashi returned home in the midst of the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, and joined with Tokugawa loyalists led by Enomoto Takeaki, whom he accompanied to Hokkaidō with the remnants of the Shogunate Army and its Navy. He was captured by the Imperial forces after the final defeat of the Republic of Ezo at the Battle of Hakodate and imprisoned in Yokohama.

Released in 1871 by Kanagawa governor Mutsu Munemitsu, he was recruited to work for the Meiji government in 1871, and because of his language abilities and previous overseas experience was selected to accompany the Iwakura Mission to Europe and the United States in 1871–1873.

== Government officer ==
Being a member of the Iwakura Mission in Britain, he was instructed by Yamao Yozo to arrange appointment of the teaching staff for the Engineering Institution (Japan) in the end of 1872. He returned home with the staff led by Henry Dyer as the principal, and endeavoured to set up the Imperial College of Engineering, Tokyo as an officer of the Engineering Institution of the Ministry of Public Works.

== Personal life ==
In 1875, he married Gamo Misao (1858 – 1942). They had a daughter and a son, Kiku and Masanosuke.

Hayashi became a master mason in 1904, initiated in 1903 in Empire Lodge No. 2108, in London. He resigned from the lodge in 1907.

== Political career ==
After the Ministry of Public Works was abolished, he moved to the Ministry of Post and Telecommunication, then was appointed governor of Kagawa Prefecture, and then of Hyōgo Prefecture. In 1891, he was appointed Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs. He was elevated to the title of baron (&quot;danshaku&quot;) in the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage in 1895.

Hayashi was appointed as resident minister to the court of Qing dynasty China at the Japanese legation in Beijing, then resident minister to Russia in St Petersburg, and finally resident minister to Great Britain. While serving in London from 1900, he worked to successfully conclude the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and signed on behalf of the government of Japan on 30 January 1902. He was elevated to the title of viscount (&quot;shishaku&quot;) in February 1902.

On 2 December 1905 Hayashi became the first Japanese ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s, as diplomatic relations were upgraded between the Empire of Japan and the British Empire. He was accompanied by his wife. At that time Sir Claude MacDonald was Hayashi&#x27;s opposite number in Tokyo.

On becoming Foreign Minister in the first Saionji cabinet in 1906, Hayashi concluded agreements with France (the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907) and Russia (the Russo-Japanese Agreement of 1907 and Russo-Japanese Agreement of 1910). He served as Minister of Communications in the second Saionji cabinet and as interim Foreign Minister (1911–12). He was elevated to the title of count (&quot;hakushaku&quot;) in 1907.

On contracting diabetes, Hayashi retired in 1912, and in June 1913 he fractured his thigh in an accident, resulting in an amputation. Hayashi died a month later, and his grave is at Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

<text>Count Vladimir Nikolayevich Kokovtsov (; – 29 January 1943) was a Russian politician who served as the fourth prime minister of Russia from 1911 to 1914, during the reign of Emperor Nicholas II.

==Early life==
He was born in Borovichi, Borovichsky Uyezd, in the Novgorod Governorate on .

Following graduation from the Imperial Alexander Lyceum in December 1872 Kokovtsov applied for admittance to Saint Petersburg State University to study law on the recommendation of Aleksandr Gradovsky, Nikolai Tagantsev and S. Pakhman, all notable legal authorities of the time. However, his father, who had promised to pay for his education suddenly died leaving the family in strained financial circumstances. As a result, instead of attending university he entered the civil service to provide him and his family an additional income.

==Civil service==
Kokovtsov was admitted as a candidate for a civil service position in the Imperial Ministry of Justice serving first in the statistical, then the legislative and finally in the criminal office. From 1879 to 1890 he served as Senior Inspector and Assistant Head of the Central Administration of Prisons. This period is noted for its prison reforms formulated by State Secretary K.K. Grot, a senior member of the Imperial State Council. From 1890 to 1896, he served in the State Council as Assistant State Secretary, State Secretary and finally as Assistant Imperial Secretary where he worked primarily on matters reviewed by the Russian Imperial State Council&#x27;s Department of State Economy.

From 1896 to 1902 he served in one of the three Assistant Minister of Finance positions under Sergei Witte.

After resigning from the position, he served as Imperial Secretary until his appointment as Minister of Finance in 1904.

He resigned the next year when his former superior in the Finance Ministry, Witte, assumed the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. Although not a minister, he then played a substantial role in securing a loan that did nothing less than keep the imperial government from having to devalue its currency and leave the gold standard, then the basis of almost all financially stable, secure and modern countries. Kokovtsov returned as Minister of Finance in the cabinets of Ivan Goremykin (1906) and Peter Stolypin (1906–11). Kokovstov was an anti-Semite who believed the problem with Jews was not their &#x27;backwardness&#x27; but the fact that they were &#x27;so clever&#x27;.

Kokovtsov succeeded Stolypin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers after Stolypin&#x27;s assassination in 1911, while also maintaining his post as Minister of Finance, and held both offices until his retirement in 1914. Kokovtsov opposed to the appointment of Alexei Khvostov.

In 1912 Kokovtsov asked the tsar to authorize Grigori Rasputin&#x27;s exile to Tobolsk. Nicholas refused: &quot;I know Rasputin too well to believe all the tittle-tattle about him.&quot; Kokovtsov had offered Rasputin a substantial amount of money to leave for Siberia and ordered the newspapers not to mention his name in connection with the Empress. The tsar dismissed Kokovtsov on 29 January 1914 for a &quot;lack of control over the press&quot;

In domestic policy, Kokovtsov&#x27;s time as prime minister saw the passage of two laws in 1912 that provided accident and sickness insurance to about 20% of workers.

==Retirement and later life==
Upon retiring, Kokovstov was invested with the title and rank of count. After the February Revolution, he moved to Kislovodsk. After the October Revolution of 1917, he was investigated by the Cheka but escaped with his family to Finland and eventually settled in Paris. He was a leading figure in Russian émigré society until his death on 29 January 1943. In 1933, he published his memoirs, which describe his childhood and education as well as his early years in government service from 1903 to 1919.

==Relationship with Sergei Witte==
Witte states in his autobiography that while Kokovtsov was serving as one of his assistants, he was left alone to do the business he knew so well and that Kokovtsov was the source of several small but meaningful reforms in the finances of the Russian Empire.

Much was made of Kokovtsov&#x27;s differences with Witte which resulted in the two refusing to work with one another after 1905–06. The apparent cause of these differences were conflicts over courses of action in the preparation for peace talks with Japan, following the Russo-Japanese War; the changing of the government structure in the wake of widespread political unrest; Witte&#x27;s opposition to several of Kokovtsov&#x27;s policies as Minister of Finance during the Russo-Japanese War, and in an important loan negotiation that occurred in 1905–06. The differences were made public in the Council of State when one or the other would make comments in opposition to the other&#x27;s viewpoint on various issues.

He was decorated with the Serbian Royal Order of the White Eagle, the Montenegrin Order of Prince Danilo I, and the Grand Cross of the Swedish Royal Order of the Polar Star (1897).

<doc id="1255396" wikidata="Q590743" url="?curid=1255396" title="Ruanda-Urundi">
<text>Ruanda-Urundi (), was a geopolitical entity, once part of German East Africa, that was occupied by troops from the Belgian Congo during the East African campaign in World War I and was administered by Belgium under military occupation from 1916 to 1922. It was subsequently awarded to Belgium as a Class-B Mandate under the League of Nations in 1922 and became a Trust Territory of the United Nations in the aftermath of World War II and the dissolution of the League. In 1962 Ruanda-Urundi became the two independent states of Rwanda and Burundi.

==History==

Ruanda and Urundi were two separate kingdoms in the Great Lakes region before the Scramble for Africa. In 1897, the German Empire established a presence in Rwanda with the formation of an alliance with the king, beginning the colonial era. They were administered as two districts of German East Africa. The two monarchies were retained as part of the German policy of indirect rule, with the Ruandan king (&quot;mwami&quot;) Yuhi V Musinga using German support to consolidate his control over subordinate chiefs in exchange for labour and resources.

===Belgian military occupation, 1916–1922===
World War I broke out in 1914. German colonies were originally meant to preserve their neutrality as mandated in the Berlin Convention, but fighting soon broke out on the frontier between German East Africa and the Belgian Congo around Lakes Kivu and Tanganyika. As part of the Allied East African campaign, Ruanda and Urundi were invaded by a Belgian force in 1916. German forces in the region were small and hugely outnumbered. Ruanda was occupied over April–May and Urundi in June 1916. By September, a large portion of German East Africa was under Belgian occupation reaching as far south as Kigoma and Karema and as far eastwards as Tabora all in modern-day Tanzania. In Ruanda and Urundi, the Belgians were welcomed by some civilians, who were opposed to the autocratic behaviour of the kings. In Urundi, much of the population fled or went into hiding, fearful of war. Much of the Swahili trader community which resided along the shores of Lake Tanganyika fled towards Kigoma, as they had long been commercial rivals with Belgian traders and feared retribution. The territory captured was administered by a Belgian military occupation authority (&quot;Belgian Occupied East African Territories&quot;) pending an ultimate decision about its political future. An administration, headed by a Royal Commissioner, was established in February 1917 at the same time as Belgian forces were ordered to withdraw from the Tabora region by the British. 

While the Germans had begun the practice of conscripting labour from the Ruandans and Urundians during the war, this was limited since the German administration considered sustaining a local labour force logistically challenging. The Belgian occupation force expanded labor conscription; 20,000 men were drafted act as porters for the Mahenge offensive, and of these only one-third returned home. Many died due to malnourishment and disease. The new labour practices caused some locals to regret the departure of the Germans.

===League of Nations mandate, 1922–1946===

The Treaty of Versailles in the aftermath of World War I divided the German colonial empire among the Allied nations. German East Africa was partitioned, with Tanganyika allocated to the British and a small area allocated to Portugal. Belgium was allocated Ruanda-Urundi even though this represented only a fraction of the territories already occupied by the Belgian forces in East Africa. Belgian diplomats had originally hoped that Belgian claims in the region could be traded for Portuguese territory in Angola to expand the Congo&#x27;s access to the Atlantic Ocean but this proved impossible. The League of Nations officially awarded Ruanda-Urundi to Belgium as a B-Class Mandate on 20 July 1922. The mandatory regime was also controversial in Belgium and it was not approved by Belgium&#x27;s parliament until 1924. Unlike colonies which belonged to its colonial power, a mandate was theoretically subject to international oversight through the League&#x27;s Permanent Mandates Commission (PMC) in Geneva, Switzerland. Administratively, the mandate was divided into two &quot;pays&quot;, Ruanda and Urundi, each under the nominal leadership of a Mwami. The city of Usumbura and its adjoining townships were classified separately as &quot;centres extra‑coutumiers&quot;, while the &quot;pays&quot; were subdivided into territories.

After a period of inertia, the Belgian administration became actively involved in Ruanda-Urundi between 1926 and 1931 under the governorship of Charles Voisin. The reforms produced a dense road-network and improved agriculture, with the emergence of cash crop farming in cotton and coffee. However, four major famines did ravage parts of the mandate after crop failures in 1916–1918, 1924–26, 1928–30 and 1943–44. The Belgians were far more involved in the territory than the Germans, especially in Ruanda. Despite the mandate rules that the Belgians had to develop the territories and prepare them for independence, the economic policy practised in the Belgian Congo was exported eastwards: the Belgians demanded that the territories earn profits for their country and that any development must come out of funds gathered in the territory. These funds mostly came from the extensive cultivation of coffee in the region&#x27;s rich volcanic soils.
To implement their vision, the Belgians extended and consolidated a power structure based on indigenous institutions. In practice, they developed a Tutsi ruling class to formally control a mostly Hutu population, through the system of chiefs and sub-chiefs under the overall rule of the two &quot;Mwami&quot;. Belgian administrators were influenced by the so-called Hamitic hypothesis which suggested that the Tutsi were partially descended from a Semitic people and were therefore inherently superior to the Hutu who were seen as purely African. In this context, the Belgian administration preferred to rule through purely Tutsi authorities therefore further stratifying the society on ethnic lines. Hutu anger at the Tutsi domination was largely focused on the Tutsi elite rather than the distant colonial power. Musinga was deposed by the administration as &quot;mwami&quot; of Ruanda in November 1931 after being accused of disloyalty. He was replaced by his son Mutara III Rudahigwa.

Although promising the League it would promote education, Belgium left the task to subsidised Catholic missions and mostly unsubsidised Protestant missions. Catholicism expanded rapidly through the Rwandan population in consequence. An elite secondary school, the Groupe Scolaire d&#x27;Astrida, was established in 1929 but as late as 1961, shortly before independence arrived, fewer than 100 Africans had been educated beyond the secondary level.The policy was one of low-cost paternalism, as explained by Belgium&#x27;s special representative to the Trusteeship Council: &quot;The real work is to change the African in his essence, to transform his soul, [and] to do that one must love him and enjoy having daily contact with him. He must be cured of his thoughtlessness, he must accustom himself to living in society, he must overcome his inertia.&quot;

===United Nations trust territory, 1946–1962===

The League of Nations was formally dissolved in April 1946, following its failure to prevent World War II. It was succeeded, for practical purposes, by the new United Nations (UN). In December 1946, the new body voted to end the mandate over Ruanda-Urundi and replace it with the new status of &quot;Trust Territory&quot;. To provide oversight, the PMC was superseded by the United Nations Trusteeship Council. The transition was accompanied by a promise that the Belgians would prepare the territory for independence, but the Belgians felt the area would take many decades to be ready for self-rule and wanted the process to take enough time before happening.

In 1961 the Belgian administration officially renamed Ruanda-Urundi as Rwanda-Burundi.

Independence came largely as a result of actions elsewhere. African anti-colonial nationalism emerged in the Belgian Congo in the late 1950s and the Belgian Government became convinced they could no longer control the territory. Unrest also broke out in Ruanda where the monarchy was deposed in the Rwandan Revolution (1959–1961). Grégoire Kayibanda led the dominant and ethnically defined Party of the Hutu Emancipation Movement (&quot;Parti du Mouvement de l&#x27;Emancipation Hutu&quot;, PARMEHUTU) in Rwanda while the equivalent Union for National Progress (&quot;Union pour le Progrès national&quot;, UPRONA) in Burundi attempted to balance competing Hutu and Tutsi ethnic claims. The independence of the Belgian Congo in June 1960 and the accompanying period of political instability further drove nationalism in Ruanda-Urundi and the assassination of the UPRONA leader Louis Rwagasore, also Burundi&#x27;s crown prince, in October 1961 did not halt the movement. After hurried preparations which included the dissolution of the monarchy in the Kingdom of Rwanda in September 1961, Ruanda-Urundi became independent on 1 July 1962, broken up along traditional lines as the independent Republic of Rwanda and Kingdom of Burundi. It took two more years before the government of the two became wholly separate and two other years until the proclamation of the Republic of Burundi.

==Colonial governors==

Ruanda-Urundi was initially administered by a Royal Commissioner (&quot;commissaire royal&quot;) until the administrative union with the Belgian Congo in 1926. After this, the mandate was administered by a Governor (&quot;gouverneur&quot;) located at Usumbura (modern-day Bujumbura) who also held the title of Vice-Governor-General (&quot;vice-gouverneur général&quot;) of the Belgian Congo. Ruanda and Urundi were each administered by a separate resident (&quot;résident&quot;) subordinate to the Governor.

<doc id="1255398" wikidata="Q7727935" url="?curid=1255398" title="The Cradle Will Rock">
<text>The Cradle Will Rock is a 1937 play in music by Marc Blitzstein. Originally a part of the Federal Theatre Project, it was directed by Orson Welles and produced by John Houseman. Set in Steeltown, U.S.A., the Brechtian allegory of corruption and corporate greed includes a panoply of social figures. It follows the efforts of Larry Foreman to unionize the town&#x27;s workers and combat the powerful industrialist Mr. Mister, who controls the town&#x27;s factory, press, church, and social organization. The piece is almost entirely sung-through, giving it many operatic qualities, although Blitzstein included popular song styles of the time.

The WPA temporarily shut down the project a few days before it was to open on Broadway. To avoid government and union restrictions, the show was performed on June 16, 1937, with Blitzstein playing piano onstage and the cast members singing their parts from the audience.

The original cast consisted of John Adair, Guido Alexander, Marc Blitzstein, Peggy Coudray, Howard da Silva, George Fairchild, Robert Farnsworth, Edward Fuller, Will Geer, Maynard Holmes, Frank Marvel, Charles Niemeyer, Le Roi Operti, Jules Schmidt, George Smithfield, Olive Stanton, and Bert Weston.

&quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; was reprised January–April 1938 as part of the first season of the Mercury Theatre, an independent repertory company founded by Welles and Houseman. An abridged version of the production was recorded and released in 1938, the first original cast recording ever made.

==History==

&quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; had its genesis in composer Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s &quot;Sketch No. 1&quot;, a short work that garnered positive comment in the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; after it was performed at The New School in February 1936. &quot;It had to do with a Moll, a Gent, a Dick; the plot concerned a little proposition and a little chicanery&quot;, Blitzstein later recalled. Bertolt Brecht had heard the sketch at Blitzstein&#x27;s apartment in late 1935, and suggested that he expand its theme from literal to figurative prostitution. Blitzstein remembered him as saying, &quot;There is prostitution for gain in so many walks of life: the artist, the preacher, the doctor, the lawyer, the newspaper editor. Why don&#x27;t you put them against this scene of literal selling.&quot; Blitzstein took up the idea and ultimately dedicated &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; to Brecht.

With revisions, the streetwalker scene in &quot;Sketch No. 1&quot; became the first of the ten scenes in Blitzstein&#x27;s opera &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, while its song, &quot;Nickel Under the Foot&quot;, moved to scene seven. Blitzstein borrowed from a number of his other earlier works as well, which blunts the common notion that Kurt Weill and Hanns Eisler were undue influences. Blitzstein objected to the terms operetta and musical comedy, and deliberately called the work an opera—a form in which drama and music have &quot;a continuous and serious mutual relation&quot;.

&quot;I wrote both the words and the music of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; at white heat during five weeks in 1936,&quot; Blitzstein said, &quot;as a kind of rebound from my wife&#x27;s death in May.&quot; The drafted short score was completed September 2, 1936. Blitzstein signed with the William Morris Agency and began auditioning &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; in one-man shows in the homes of New York producers including Herman Shumlin, Harold Clurman for the Group Theatre, Charles Friedman for the Theatre Union, and Martin Gabel.

In the fall of 1936, Blitzstein attended a performance of the Federal Theatre Project 891 farce &quot;Horse Eats Hat&quot; and went backstage to meet the show&#x27;s writer-director, 21-year-old Orson Welles. He found a chance to play his opera for Welles, who was won over by Blitzstein&#x27;s enthusiasm and endearing faith in his unproduced musical. A deep friendship began between them.

Welles thought about directing &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; for the Theatre Guild, which was a long shot; and he was set to direct it for the Actors Repertory Company, which optioned the work but later had to withdraw from the agreement for lack of finances. Rivalries and resentments were always in play between Welles and John Houseman, producer of Federal Theatre Project 891, as Houseman frankly expressed in his memoirs:
I remember listening jealously, with an ill-concealed sense of rejection, to Orson&#x27;s enthusiastic comments about the piece (which I had not heard) and to his ideas for casting and staging it, which he elaborated for my annoyance. ... In the midst of our doldrums and as part of the complicated game of one-upmanship that Orson and I were constantly playing together, I suggested one night in his dressing room that if I were ever invited to hear Marc&#x27;s work, I might conceivably find it suitable for production at the Maxine Elliott for Project 891.
Welles arranged for Blitzstein to play his opera through for him, and Houseman was convinced that it should be presented by the Federal Theatre Project.

That view was supported at the highest level. Hallie Flanagan, national director of the Federal Theatre Project, was invited to a dinner party March 1, 1937, at the apartment Houseman shared with composer Virgil Thomson. Blitzstein auditioned his opera for Flanagan—this time supported by the strident voice of Howard da Silva, an actor Welles knew from his radio work who had also led the Federal Theatre Project in his native Cleveland.

&quot;Marc Blitzstein sat down at the piano and played, sang, and acted,&quot; Flanagan recalled, &quot;with the hard hypnotic drive which came to be familiar to audiences, his new opera&quot;:

It took no wizardry to see that this was not a play set to music, nor music illustrated by actors, but music + play equaling something new and better than either. This was in its percussive as well as its verbal beat Steeltown, U.S.A.: street corner, mission, lawn of Mr. Mister, drugstore, hotel lobby, faculty room, night court: America, 1937.

Blitzstein wrote his sister: &quot;Hallie F. is nuts about the work—but just as terrified of it.&quot;

The Federal Theatre Project&#x27;s greenlighting of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; coincided with one of the most violent strikes of the 1930s. In March 1937, U.S. Steel signed a historic collective bargaining agreement with the steelworkers union. Even though the Supreme Court had affirmed the constitutionality of the Wagner Act in April, smaller steel manufacturers refused to sign a similar agreement with workers, setting off a five-month strike that reached a crescendo with the 1937 Memorial Day massacre at the Republic Steel Corporation in Chicago.

Flanagan&#x27;s attention was absorbed by &quot;the thunder and lightning surrounding the project itself. For the order to cut was rumored again. The Act of Congress under which we were set up was to expire on June 30.&quot; Conservative elements in Congress already thought little of the Federal Theatre Project, and a government-sponsored pro-union Broadway show would exacerbate those resentments.

==Synopsis==
The story is set in Steeltown, U.S.A., on the evening of a union drive.

Moll, a young prostitute, is arrested when she refuses a proposition from a corrupt policeman. She is soon joined at night court by members of the Liberty Committee, an anti-union group mistakenly charged with pro-union activities. While the committee members call out to be freed by their patron, industrialist Mr. Mister, a derelict named Harry Druggist befriends Moll and explains that he lost his business because of Mr. Mister.
Harry relates how Mr. Mister came to dominate Steeltown: Years earlier, during World War I, Mr. Mister&#x27;s wife pays the town priest, Reverend Salvation, to preach sermons supporting her husband&#x27;s interests. Editor Daily, the head of the local newspaper, begins running articles attacking the steelworkers union and its leader, Larry Foreman, while also hiring the inept Junior Mister as a foreign correspondent. Gus Polack, a newly elected member of the union, is murdered in a car bombing that also kills his wife and unborn child, as well as Harry&#x27;s son Stevie. Harry is pressured to keep quiet. He subsequently loses his business permit and falls into alcoholic despair.

Eventually, all of Steeltown&#x27;s prominent citizens join the Liberty Committee, including Salvation, Daily, the painter Dauber, and the violinist Yasha. With their support, Mr. Mister&#x27;s rule over the town seems unshakeable.

Later that night, Larry is arrested and beaten for distributing leaflets. He urges the others to join him and rise against Mr. Mister, saying that, in time, &quot;the cradle will rock&quot;.

A flashback shows Mr. Mister persuading President Prexy of Steeltown University to threaten students with expulsion if they do not join the army. Dr. Specialist, the chairman of the Liberty Committee, is told to cover up the death of a steelworker by writing it off as a drunken accident. He does so even when the worker&#x27;s sister, Ella Hammer, confronts him with the truth.

Later that evening, Mr. Mister arrives and bails out the committee members. He offers to pay off Foreman, but he refuses. As the committee jeers him, Foreman defiantly declares that Mr. Mister&#x27;s power over Steeltown will soon come to an end. The curtain falls.

==Musical numbers==
&quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; is presented in ten scenes. In the original Federal Theatre Project production, it was performed without an intermission. At the June 16 performance at the Venice Theatre, a 15-minute intermission was an impromptu addition following scene six, to spare Marc Blitzstein from exhaustion.

No musical numbers were listed in the program. Six songs were printed in the libretto published by Random House; those and others were titled and copyrighted by Blitzstein as individual works in 1938.

==Original production==

===Federal Theatre Project===
Rehearsals for &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; began March 8, 1937. The 32-member orchestra, conducted by music director Lehman Engel, started rehearsals in mid-April. Members of the large company would have two months or more of rehearsal time and employment as the show was prepared—a luxury that the Federal Theatre Project, as a New Deal work-relief program, was designed to afford. Everyone, including Blitzstein, was paid $23.86 a week.

Having arranged for Howard da Silva to play labor organizer Larry Foreman, Welles cast Will Geer as capitalist boss Mr. Mister. For the role of Moll, the young woman who prostitutes herself to avoid starving, he found Olive Stanton, an actress who had appeared in the Federal Theatre Project production &quot;Class of &#x27;29&quot; (1936). She was a daughter of Sanford E. Stanton, a political reporter and columnist for the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;.

An ingenue in early Universal Pictures films, Peggy Coudray (Mrs. Mister) had earned praise for her comedy skills in soubrette roles in stage musicals and operettas. She had performed with Edward Arnold in vaudeville and led her own stock companies. The comic actor Hiram Sherman (Junior Mister) was a childhood friend of Welles and a veteran of his farce &quot;Horse Eats Hat&quot;. Other cast were selected for the clarity and strength of their voices, supplemented by an interracial chorus of 44 singers.

&quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; was choreographed by Clarence Yates, an African-American dancer and choreographer who studied ballet with Michel Fokine. He was director of dance for the Federal Theatre Project&#x27;s Negro Theatre Unit in New York City. He and Asadata Dafora choreographed Welles&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo Macbeth&quot;, and Yates was in the cast of his &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;.
&quot;It is not very fashionable these days to refer admiringly to the Federal Theatre Project, and yet it was responsible for a great number of today&#x27;s writers, stars, directors and stage designers,&quot; Blitzstein said in a 1956 interview. &quot;We had unlimited time to prepare the production and we had really quite extraordinary talents in every department at our disposal. Rehearsals moved toward a state of perfection rarely attained in our present‐day theater.&quot;
The production&#x27;s costume and scenic designer was Edwin J. Schruers. &quot;Of course it was really Orson,&quot; wrote Blitzstein. Welles talked Blitzstein into a flashy stage design &quot;full of metal and glass and the horror of Steeltown&quot;:

I told Marc he shouldn&#x27;t do an opera for the ladies&#x27; garment workers and the communist union. Instead, he should do it for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; audiences, and it should have no atmosphere of being a little labor opera. It should be a big Broadway show.

Houseman described &quot;an extravagant scenic scheme that called for a triple row of three-dimensional velour portals between which narrow glass-bottomed fluorescent platforms, loaded with scenery and props, slid smoothly past each other as the scene shifted back and forth&quot;. The scene plot indicates four of these illuminated trucks, as well as screens, two travelers, a double-quarter revolve and an inventive aperture curtain. Accustomed to an open stage and the accompaniment of only Blitzstein&#x27;s piano, the well-rehearsed cast was disconcerted when they began to work with the sliding scenery and a large orchestra.

To plan the blocking and performances, Welles had to know the music. &quot;He would start at ten in the morning and not leave the theatre,&quot; said conductor Lehman Engel. &quot;He might dismiss his cast at four the next morning but when we would return at noon, we would find Orson sleeping in a theatre seat.&quot;

Houseman and Welles would not commit to a schedule for some weeks, while Welles&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; continued to sell out at Maxine Elliott&#x27;s Theatre. &quot;Faustus&quot; finally suspended performances on May 29. Public previews of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; were announced to begin June 16, with an official opening at the end of June. After a few weeks&#x27; run, the musical was to play in repertory with &quot;Faustus&quot; and another production to be announced.

&quot;On June 10,&quot; Flanagan wrote, &quot;after weeks of debate in Washington we received the definite order to cut the New York project by 30 percent, involving the dismissal of 1,701 workers.&quot; Flanagan received another memorandum June 12, stating that &quot;no openings of new productions shall take place until after the beginning of the coming fiscal year&quot; due to an expected cut in federal appropriations. Because &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; was the only new production opening in the last two weeks of June, Flanagan concluded that &quot;this was obviously censorship under a different guise.&quot;

Nineteen benefit performances had been scheduled for &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; through July 24, with 18,000 tickets sold. The first public preview on June 16 was a sold-out benefit for the Downtown Music School.

&quot;As producers, Orson and I were not noted for our punctuality,&quot; Houseman wrote, adding that their &quot;Macbeth&quot; was postponed five times, &quot;Horse Eats Hat &quot; twice, and &quot;Faustus&quot; three times. &quot;Normally, we would almost certainly have postponed the opening of &quot;The Cradle&quot;. But now, suddenly, we became demons of dependability, scrupulous to honor our public and artistic commitment. Hallie asked me how I felt about the delay. I told her we refused to accept it.&quot;

The Federal Theatre Project 891 version of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; was publicly performed only once, at a full-orchestra dress rehearsal on June 14. The hastily invited audience of several hundred people included producer Arthur Hopkins, playwrights Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman, and writer and editor V. J. Jerome. Syndicated columnist Jay Franklin reported: &quot;Those who saw the dress rehearsal say that it is a gay, fast-moving, exciting show—one which subjects the social scene to radical criticism and still retains a sense of humor and of proportion.&quot;

On June 15, the WPA padlocked Maxine Elliott&#x27;s Theatre. Uniformed guards prevented anyone from removing props or costumes, which were U.S. government property.

&quot;The hammer fell in the form of considerable governmental budget cuts just as &quot;Cradle&quot; was to open,&quot; Welles said, &quot;at the height of the CIO&#x27;s efforts to organize steel. Another reason for closing us was that, unlike most WPA plays, we were going to be on Broadway, which opponents feared would attract considerable attention.&quot;

===Private sponsorship===

Welles, Houseman and Blitzstein, seeking a way to privately produce the show, rented the much larger Venice Theatre and a piano just in time for the scheduled preview on June 16, 1937. The 600 audience members, who had gathered outside the Maxine Elliot Theatre for the preview, travelled 21 blocks north to the Venice Theatre; many were on foot. The sold-out house grew even larger when the show&#x27;s creators invited people off the street to attend for free. The musicians&#x27; union refused to play for the show unless Houseman could provide their full salaries, and Actors&#x27; Equity Association stated that its members could not perform onstage at the new theatre without approval of the original producer (the federal government). The show&#x27;s creators thus planned for Blitzstein to perform the entire musical at the piano. Just after beginning the first number, Blitzstein was joined by Olive Stanton, the actress playing Moll, from the audience. During the rest of the performance, various actors joined in with Blitzstein and performed the entire musical from the house. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27;s description of the original production, &quot;Persons who heard the opera&#x27;s score and extracts last night carried no clear impression except that its theme was that steel workers should join a union.&quot; Poet Archibald MacLeish, who was in the audience, &quot;praised the &#x27;vitality&#x27; of the Federal Theatre Project.&quot;

Houseman determined that there were no legal restrictions on performing the musical with a new financial backer, and beginning on June 18, Helen Deutsch, press agent for the Theatre Guild, agreed to serve as the financial backer for &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;; the actors received a two-week leave of absence from the WPA, and, in an agreement with Actors&#x27; Equity, Deutsch paid the 19 cast members $1500 for the two weeks&#x27; performances. Two days later, Houseman announced that, should the production prove successful, the two-week run would be continued indefinitely. Houseman also announced that the musical would continue to be performed with Blitzstein playing piano onstage and the cast members singing from the audience. He asserted that this made the audience feel like part of the show, stating, &quot;There has always been the question of how to produce a labor show so the audience feels like it is a part of the performance. This technique seems to solve that problem and is exactly the right one for this particular piece&quot;. The success of the performance led Welles and Houseman to form the Mercury Theatre.

===Mercury Theatre===
&quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; was presented by the Mercury Theatre as part of its inaugural season. On December 5, 1937, it opened in a reduced oratorio version on Sunday evenings at the Mercury Theatre, using the set for &quot;Caesar&quot; and two rows of chairs. The cast included Will Geer, Howard da Silva, Hiram Sherman, a chorus of 12, and Marc Blitzstein at the piano.

Presented by the Mercury Theatre and Sam H. Grisman, the oratorio version of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; moved to the Windsor Theatre January 4, 1938. In mid-February it returned to the Mercury Theatre and completed its 13-week run April 2, 1938.

==Later productions==

===Broadway and Off-Broadway===
The musical was revived on Broadway on December 26, 1947, at the Mansfield Theatre, then moving to the Broadway Theatre, with a cast that included Alfred Drake (Larry Foreman), Vivian Vance (Mrs. Mister), Jack Albertson (Yasha), and original cast member Will Geer (Mr. Mister). The production was directed by Howard da Silva and played 34 performances. The UK premiere took place in London at the Unity Theatre, King&#x27;s Cross, in 1951.

Blitzstein&#x27;s rarely heard orchestrations were used in a February 1960 production by the New York City Opera at New York City Center, featuring Tammy Grimes and David Atkinson.

The show was revived Off-Broadway in 1964 in a production starring Jerry Orbach (Larry Foreman), Nancy Andrews (Mrs. Mister), Lauri Peters (Moll), and Micki Grant (Ella Hammer), directed by Howard da Silva. Leonard Bernstein acted as music supervisor to music director Gershon Kingsley. The production ran at Theatre Four for 82 performances. This production won the Obie Award as Best Musical Production and Dean Dittman (who played Editor Daily) won the Obie for Distinguished Performance.

The Acting Company presented an Off-Broadway production at the American Place Theater from May 9, 1983 to May 29, 1983, directed by John Houseman and featuring a spoken introduction by Houseman, and starring Patti LuPone. This production was done &quot;on a dark stage, decorated only with chairs and Dennis Parichy&#x27;s poetic lighting. At dead center is the upright piano, whose expert player, Michael Barrett, delivers the Brechtian scene-setting announcements as Blitzstein once did.&quot; The production was recorded for television and aired on PBS in 1986.

===Other productions===
The show was revived in 1985 at The Old Vic (near Waterloo Station) featuring alumni members of The Acting Company. In this production Patti LuPone reprised her role as Moll and was honored with an Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical.

Splinter Group Theatre&#x27;s Chicago production in 1994 was named one of the Ten Best plays of the year by the Chicago Tribune. Directed by Matt O&#x27;Brien, with musical direction by Jim Collins, the production style recreated the bare bones approach necessitated by the 1937 production&#x27;s opening night, and later transferred from Splinter Group&#x27;s space in Wicker Park to the larger Theatre Building in Chicago, running a total of three months in the two locations.

Mehmet Ergen directed a production in London for the Arcola Theatre&#x27;s 10th Anniversary in 2010 starring Alicia Davies, Stuart Matthew Price, Morgan Deare, Chris Jenkins and Josie Benson. It was the last show at the Arcola Street location, before the company moved to its new space, opposite the Dalston Junction station.

The Oberlin Summer Theater Festival staged a summer stock production in 2012. Directed by Joey Rizzolo, one of the New York Neo-Futurists (who are known for their Brechtian approach to theater), the production opened to critical acclaim.

====&quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;====

In 1984, Orson Welles wrote the screenplay for a film he planned to direct—&quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, an autobiographical drama about the 1937 staging of Blitzstein&#x27;s play. Rupert Everett was cast to portray the 21-year-old Welles in the black-and-white feature film. Welles&#x27;s first wife Virginia Nicolson is a sympathetically written key character in the unproduced screenplay, one of Welles&#x27;s last important pieces of writing. She read and approved the screenplay during preproduction. John Houseman read it after Welles&#x27;s death and remarked on the screenplay&#x27;s accuracy and fairness.

Although the budget was reduced to $3 million, Welles was unable to secure funding and the project was not realized.

&quot;A couple of studio reports that I&#x27;ve read on the &quot;Cradle&quot; script seem characteristic,&quot; wrote film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum. &quot;Both readers complain that the script assumes an interest in Welles&#x27;s early life that they didn&#x27;t happen to share.&quot; The unproduced screenplay was published in 1994.

====&quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; ====

In 1999 writer/director Tim Robbins wrote a semi-fictional film recounting the original production of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;. The film, entitled &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; (without &quot;The&quot;) blended the true history of Blitzstein&#x27;s show with the creation (and subsequent destruction) of the original Diego Rivera mural &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; in the lobby of Rockefeller Center (the Rivera mural was actually destroyed in 1934). Several of the original actors from the 1937 production were included as characters in the film, notably Olive Stanton, John Adair, and Will Geer, while others were replaced by fictional characters. Leading man Howard da Silva was replaced by the fictional &quot;Aldo Silvano&quot; (John Turturro). Although Will Geer played Mr. Mister in the 1937 production, for the movie he was recast in the smaller role of the Druggist. The name of the actor who played Doctor Specialist in the original production is given to the fictional character &quot;Frank Marvel&quot; (Barnard Hughes), who plays Mr. Mister.

The film&#x27;s climax recreates scenes from the original, legendary performance of the show, performed by veteran Broadway performers Victoria Clark, Gregg Edelman, Audra McDonald, Daniel Jenkins, Erin Hill, and Chris McKinney.

Robbins wrote a book, &quot;Cradle Will Rock: The Movie and the Moment&quot;, as a companion to the movie; it discusses the original show, his adaptation, and the filming of the motion picture.

==Recordings==
A slightly abridged version of Welles&#x27;s 1937 Mercury Theatre production with narration by Blitzstein was recorded in April 1938 and released on the Musicraft label (number 18). It was the first original cast recording ever made. A digital version of the Musicraft 78s is available through the Internet Archive.

In December 1964 the recording was re-released in a limited-edition LP on the American Legacy Records label (T1001).

<doc id="1255407" wikidata="Q751960" url="?curid=1255407" title="Induction cooking">
<text>Induction cooking is a cooking process using direct electrical induction heating of cookware, rather than relying on indirect radiation, convection, or thermal conduction. Induction cooking allows high power and very rapid increases in temperature to be achieved: changes in heat settings are instantaneous.

Cooking vessels with suitable bases are placed on an induction electric stove (also &quot;induction hob&quot; or &quot;induction cooktop&quot;) which generally has a heat-proof glass-ceramic surface above a coil of copper wire with a low radio frequency alternating electric current passing through it. The resulting oscillating magnetic field induces an electrical current in the vessel. This large eddy current flowing through the resistance of a thin layer of metal in the base of the vessel results in resistive heating.

To work with induction, cookware must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Induction tops typically will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current, but cast iron, carbon steel and stainless steel pans usually work. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.

Induction cooking has good coupling between the pan and the coil and is thus quite efficient, which means it produces less waste heat and it can be quickly turned on and off. Induction has safety advantages compared to gas stoves and emits no air pollution into the kitchen. Cooktops are also usually easy to clean, because the cooktop itself has a smooth surface and does not get very hot.

== History ==

The first patents were issued in the early 1900s. Demonstration stoves were shown by the Frigidaire division of General Motors in the mid-1950s on a touring showcase. The induction cooker was shown heating a pot of water with a newspaper placed between the stove and the pot, to demonstrate the convenience and safety. This unit was never put into production.

Modern implementations came in the early 1970s, with work done at the Research &amp; Development Center of Westinghouse Electric Corporation. That work was first put on display at the 1971 National Association of Home Builders convention in Houston, Texas, as part of the Westinghouse Consumer Products Division display. The stand-alone single-burner range was named the Cool Top Induction Range. It used parallel Delco Electronics transistors developed for automotive electronic ignition systems to drive the 25kHz current.
Westinghouse decided to make a few hundred production units to develop the market. Those were named Cool Top 2 (CT2) Induction ranges. The development work was done by a team led by Bill Moreland and Terry Malarkey. The ranges were priced at US$1,500 ($11,050 in 2023 dollars), including a set of high quality cookware made of Quadraply, a new laminate of stainless steel, carbon steel, aluminum and another layer of stainless steel (outside to inside). Production began in 1973 and stopped in 1975.

CT2 had four &quot;burners&quot; of about 1,600 watts each. The surface was a Pyroceram ceramic sheet surrounded by a stainless-steel bezel, upon which four magnetic sliders adjusted four corresponding potentiometers below. That design, using no through-holes, made the range impervious to spills. The electronics section was made of four identical modules cooled by a single quiet, low-speed, high-torque fan.

In each of the electronics modules, the 240V, 60Hz domestic line power was converted to between 20V and 200V of continuously variable DC by a phase-controlled rectifier, which was then converted to 27kHz 30A (peak) AC by two arrays of six paralleled Motorola automotive-ignition transistors in a half-bridge configuration driving a series-resonant LC oscillator, of which the inductor component was the induction-heating coil and its load, the cooking pan. The circuit design, largely by Ray Mackenzie, successfully dealt with overload problems.

Control electronics included functions such as protection against over-heated pans and overloads. Provision was made to reduce radiated electrical and magnetic fields. Magnetic pan detection was provided.

CT2 was UL Listed and received Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval, both firsts. Numerous patents were issued. CT2 won several awards, including &quot;Industrial Research Magazine&quot;&#x27;s IR-100 1972 best-product award and a citation from the United States Steel Association. Raymond Baxter demonstrated the CT2 on the BBC TV series &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;. He showed how the CT2 could cook through a slab of ice.

Sears Kenmore sold a free-standing oven/stove with four induction-cooking surfaces in the mid-1980s (Model Number 103.9647910). The unit also had a self-cleaning oven, solid-state kitchen timer and capacitive-touch control buttons, advanced for the time. The units were more expensive than standard cooking surfaces.

In 2009 Panasonic developed an all-metal induction cooker that used frequencies up to 120kHz, three to five times higher than other cooktops, to work with non-ferrous metal cookware.

== Theory ==

An induction cooker wirelessly transfers electrical energy by induction from a coil of wire into a metal vessel. The coil is mounted under the cooking surface, and a low-radio-frequency (typically ~25–50kHz) alternating current is passed through it. The current in the coil creates a dynamic electromagnetic field which is strongly magnetic. When a suitable electrically conductive pot is brought close to the cooking surface, the oscillating field induces large eddy currents in the pot. The coil has many turns, while the bottom of the pot effectively forms a single shorted turn. This forms a transformer that steps down the voltage and steps up the current. This large current flowing through the base of the pot produces heat through Joule heating; the cookware then in turn heats its contents by heat conduction.

For high efficiency there should be as little electrical resistance in the coil and as much as possible in the pan so that most of the heat is developed in the pan.

At the frequencies typically used in induction cooking, currents flow mostly on the outside of conductors (the skin effect). Reducing the skin effect in the coil reduces its resistance and the heat wasted in the coil. Therefore, the coil is made from litz wire, which is a bundle of many smaller insulated wires woven together in parallel. Litz wire reduces skin effect, and coil resistance, so that the coil stays cool. Conversely, increased skin effect in the cookware results in more efficient coupling, which is one of the factors making ferrous materials preferable.

== Features ==
Induction cooking provides fast heating, improved thermal efficiency, and more consistent heating than cooking by thermal conduction. Generally, the higher the power rating, the faster the cooking time. Induction cooktop power ratings are generally quoted for power delivered to the pan, whereas gas ratings are specified in terms of gas use, but gas is much less efficient. In practice, induction cook zones commonly have heating performance more comparable to a commercial gas burner than domestic burners. Often a thermostat is present to measure the temperature of the pan. This helps prevent the pan from severely overheating if accidentally heated empty or boiled dry, but some models can allow the induction cooker to maintain a target temperature.

Induction cooker tops are generally a low-thermal expansion glass-ceramic. The surface of the cooker is heated only by the pot and so does not usually reach a high temperature. The thermal conductivity of glass ceramics is poor so the heat does not spread far. Induction cookers are easy to clean because the cooking surface is flat and smooth and does not usually get hot enough to make spilled food burn and stick. The surface is brittle and can be damaged by sufficient impact although they must meet specified impact standards.

Noise is generated by an internal cooling fan. Electromagnetically induced acoustic noise and vibration (a high-pitched hum or buzz) may be produced, especially at high power, if the cookware has loose parts or if the layers of the pot are not well bonded to each other; cookware with welded-in cladding layers and solid riveting is less likely to produce this type of noise. Some users are more capable of hearing (or more sensitive to) this high-frequency sound.

Some cooking techniques available when cooking over a flame are not applicable. Persons with artificial pacemakers or other electronic medical implants are usually instructed to avoid sources of magnetic fields. Radio receivers near the induction-cooking unit may pick up some electromagnetic interference. Because the cooktop is shallow compared to a gas-fired or electrical coil cooking surface, wheelchair access can be improved; the user&#x27;s legs can fit below the counter height while the user&#x27;s arms reach over the top.

Energy lost from gas cooking heats the kitchen, whereas with induction cooking, energy losses are much lower. This results in less heating of the kitchen and reduces the required amount of ventilation. Gas stoves are a significant source of indoor air pollution. Gas cooking efficiencies are lower once waste heat generation is taken into account. Especially in restaurants, gas cooking can significantly increase air temperature in localized areas. Extra cooling and zoned venting may be needed to adequately condition hot areas without overcooling other areas. In a commercial setting, induction cookers do not require safety interlocks between the fuel source and the ventilation, as may be required with gas systems.

Some units have touch-sensitive controls. Some have a memory setting, one per element, to control the time that heat is applied. At least one manufacturer makes a &quot;zoneless&quot; induction cooking surface with multiple induction coils. This allows up to five pots to be used at once anywhere on the cooking surface, rather than in pre-defined spots.

== Cookware ==

Cookware must be compatible with induction heating; generally, only ferrous metal can be heated. Cookware should have a flat bottom since the magnetic field strength (heating power) drops rapidly with distance from the surface. (Wok-shaped cooktops are available for use with round-bottom woks.) Induction disks are metal plates that are heated by induction and heat non-ferrous pots by thermal contact, but these are much less efficient than ferrous cooking vessels.

Induction-compatible cookware can nearly always be used on other stoves. Some cookware or packaging is marked with symbols to indicate compatibility with induction, gas, or electric heat. Induction cooking surfaces work well with any pans with a high ferrous metal content at the base. Cast iron pans and any black metal or iron pans are compatible. Stainless steel pans are compatible if the base of the pan is a magnetic grade of stainless steel. If a magnet sticks well to the bottom of the pan, it is compatible. Non-ferrous cookware is compatible with &quot;all-metal&quot; cookers.

Aluminum and copper are desirable in cookware, since they conduct heat better. Because of this, &#x27;tri-ply&#x27; pans often have an induction-compatible skin of stainless steel containing a layer of thermally conductive aluminum.

For frying, a pan base must be a good heat conductor to spread heat quickly and evenly. The sole of the pan will be either a steel plate pressed into aluminum, or a layer of stainless steel over the aluminum. Aluminum&#x27;s high thermal conductivity makes the temperature more uniform across the pan. Stainless frying pans with an aluminum base do not have the same temperature at their sides as an aluminum sided pan. Cast iron frying pans work well with induction cooking surfaces, although the material is not as good a thermal conductor as aluminum.

When boiling water, the water circulates, spreading the heat and preventing hot spots. For products such as sauces, it is important that at least the base of the pan incorporates a good heat conducting material to spread the heat evenly. For delicate products such as thick sauces, a pan with aluminum throughout is better, since the heat flows up the sides through the aluminum, evenly heating the sauce.

For induction cooking, the base of a suitable vessel is typically made of a steel or iron. These ferromagnetic materials have a high magnetic permeability which greatly decreases the skin depth, concentrating the current in a very thin layer at the surface of the metal bottom of the pan. This makes the electrical resistance in the pan relatively high, efficiently heating the pan. 

However, for non ferrous metals, such as aluminum, the skin depth in the pans with typical induction cooktops is too large, and thus efficiency with a standard induction cooker is poor: the resistive heating in the coil and pan are similar. This could damage the cooktop, which detects it and rejects the pan.

The heat that can be produced in a pot is a function of the surface resistance. A higher surface resistance produces more heat for similar currents. This is a “figure of merit” that can be used to rank the suitability of a material for induction heating. The surface resistance in a thick metal conductor is proportional to the resistivity divided by the skin depth. Where the thickness is less than the skin depth, the actual thickness can be used to calculate surface resistance.

For some materials, the thickness of a cooking pot can be less than the skin depth, increasing efficiency. For example, typical titanium camping cookware has a thickness (typically around 0.5 mm) around 4 times less than its skin depth at 24 kHz, increasing its efficiency by that factor compared to thick titanium. Less practically, a piece of aluminium foil is typically around 35 times thinner than aluminium&#x27;s skin depth, so will heat efficiently (and melt quickly).

To get the same surface resistance with copper as with carbon steel would require the metal to be thinner than is practical for a cooking vessel; at 24 kHz a copper vessel bottom would need to be 1/56th the skin depth of carbon steel. Since the skin depth is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency, this suggests that much higher frequencies would be required to obtain equivalent heating in a copper pot as in an iron pot at 24 kHz. Such high frequencies are not feasible with inexpensive power semiconductors. In 1973 the silicon-controlled rectifiers used were limited to no more than 40 kHz. Even a thin layer of copper on the bottom of a steel cooking vessel will shield the steel from the magnetic field and make it unusable for an induction top. In ferrous materials some additional heat is created by hysteresis losses, but this creates less than ten percent of the total heat generated.

New types of power semiconductors and low-loss coil designs have made an all-metal cooker possible which can be used with any metal pot or pan even if not designed for induction. Panasonic in 2009 developed a consumer induction cooker that uses a higher-frequency magnetic field of 60 kHz or higher, and a different oscillator circuit design, to allow use with non-ferrous metals as well, including aluminum, multilayer and copper pots and pans. In 2017 Panasonic released a single-burner counter top &quot;all metal&quot; unit, using their trade name &quot;Met-All&quot;, aimed at commercial kitchens.

== Efficiency ==

The 2014 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings concluded that &quot;induction cooking is not always the most efficient method of cooking. When tested with a large cooking vessel, the efficiency of conventional electric technology was measured to be higher (83%) than that of induction cooking (77%). Yet the
efficiency of conventional cooking appliances was shown to be highly dependent on the size of the cooking vessel.&quot; Cooking methods that use flames or hot heating elements have a significantly higher loss to the ambient environment; induction heating directly heats the pot. Because the induction effect does not directly heat the air around the vessel, induction cooking results in further energy efficiencies. Cooling air is blown through the electronics beneath the surface but it is only slightly warm.

The purpose of a cooktop is to prepare food; for example, long periods of simmering may be required. Published energy efficiency measurements concentrate on the ability of a cooktop to transfer energy to a metal test block, which is easier to repeatably measure.

Energy transfer efficiency, as defined by U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is the percentage of the energy consumed by a cooker that, at the end of a simulated cooking cycle has been transferred as heat to a standardized aluminum test block.

The DOE test cycle starts with both the block and the cooktop at 77 °F ± 9 °F (25 °C ± 5 °C). The cooktop is then switched to maximum heating power. When the test block temperature reaches 144 °F (80 °C) above the initial room temperature, the cooktop power is immediately reduced to 25% ± 5% of its maximum power. After 15 minutes of operation at this lower power setting, the cooktop is turned off and the heat energy in the test block is measured. Efficiency is given by the ratio between energy in the block and input (electric) energy.

Such a test, using two power levels, is intended to mimic real life use. Wasted energy terms such as residual unused heat (retained by solid hot-plates, ceramic or coil at the end of the test), and losses from convection and radiation by hot surfaces (including the ones of the block itself) are disregarded.

In typical cooking, the energy delivered by the cooker is only partly used to heat the food; once that has occurred, all the subsequent energy input is delivered to the air as loss through steam or convection and radiation. Without an increase in food temperature, the DOE test procedure would find the efficiency to be zero. Cooking procedures such as reduction of a sauce, braising meat, simmering, and so on are significant uses of a cooker, but efficiency of these practices is not modelled by the procedure.

In 2013 and 2014 DOE developed and proposed new test procedures to allow direct comparison of energy transfer efficiency among induction, electric resistance, and gas cooking tops and ranges. The procedures use a new hybrid test block made of aluminum and stainless steel. The proposed rule lists results of real lab tests conducted with the hybrid block. For comparable (large) cooking elements the following efficiencies were measured with ±0.5% repeatability: 70.7% - 73.6% for induction, 71.9% for electric coil, 43.9% for gas. DOE affirmed that &quot;induction units have an average efficiency of 72.2%, not significantly higher than the 69.9% efficiency of smooth—electric resistance units, or the 71.2% of electric coil units&quot;. DOE noted that the 84% induction efficiency, cited in previous Technical Support Documents, was not measured by DOE laboratories, but just &quot;referenced from an external test study&quot; performed in 1992.

Independent manufacturers tests and other subjects seem to demonstrate that actual induction cooking efficiencies usually stay between 74% and 77% and occasionally reach 81% (although these tests may follow different procedures). These tests suggest that the 84% induction average efficiency reference value should be taken with caution.

For comparison and in agreement with DOE findings, cooking with gas has an average energy efficiency of about 40%. It can be raised only by using special pots with fins.

When comparing with gas, the relative cost of electrical and gas energy, and the efficiency of electricity generation affect overall environmental efficiency and user cost.

== Safety ==

The pan is insulated by the cooking surface, and voltages generated in the pan are far too low to represent a shock hazard. The cooktop can detect whether cookware is present by monitoring power delivered. As with other electric ceramic cooking surfaces, a maximum pan size may be specified by the manufacturer, and a minimum size is also stated. The control system shuts down the element if a pot is not present or not large enough. If a pan boils dry it can get extremely hot – a thermostat in the surface will turn off the power if it senses overheating to prevent cooker failures and potential fires.

== Applications ==

Induction equipment may be a built-in surface, part of a range, or a standalone surface unit. Built-in and rangetop units typically have multiple elements, the equivalent of multiple burners on a gas-fueled range. Stand-alone induction modules are typically single-or dual-element. All such elements share an electromagnet sealed beneath a heat-resisting glass-ceramic sheet. The pot is placed on the ceramic glass surface and heats its contents.

Asian manufacturers have taken the lead in producing inexpensive single-induction-zone surfaces. In Japan, some models of rice cookers are powered by induction. Induction cookers are less frequently used in other parts of the world.

Induction ranges may be applicable in commercial restaurant kitchens, with lower installation, ventilation and fire suppression equipment costs. Drawbacks for commercial use include possible breakages of the glass cook-top, higher initial cost and the requirement for magnetic cookware.

== Manufacturers ==

In the United States, as of early 2013 over five dozen brands offered induction-cooking equipment, including both built-in and countertop residential equipment and commercial-grade equipment. Over two dozen brands offer built-in residential-use units; residential countertop units are offered by two-dozen-plus brands. The National Association of Home Builders in 2012 estimated that, in the United States, induction cooktops represented only 4% of sales, compared to gas and other electric cooktops. The global induction cooktops market was estimated at $9.16 billion in value during 2015. In April 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;In an independent survey [in 2009] by the market research company Mintel of 2,000 Internet users who own appliances, only 5 percent of respondents said they had an induction range or cooktop. Still, 22 percent of the people Mintel surveyed in connection to their study [in 2009] said their next range or cooktop would be induction.&quot;

<text>The World Wrestling Council (WWC; Spanish: &quot;Consejo Mundial de Lucha&quot;) is a professional wrestling promotion based in Puerto Rico. It was originally established as Capitol Sports Promotions in 1973 by Carlos Colón, Victor Jovica, and Gorilla Monsoon. By the mid-1990s, the promotion had changed its name to the World Wrestling Council. It was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance until 1988. WWC is among the oldest professional wrestling promotions in the world and one of only eight in the entire world to reach its 50th anniversary in continuous operation.

== History ==
===Beginnings (1970s)===

Capitol Sports Promotions, with Carlos Colón, Victor Jovica and Gorilla Monsoon as promoters/co-owners of the organization, was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) until late 1988, when Gorilla Monsoon left. The company then went bankrupt (as confirmed by Víctor Quiñones in an interview with prwrestling.com). Thomas Collado was the owner in 1976, before Carlos Colón and Victor Jovica. The promotion operated from its headquarters, located in Santurce, San Juan.

Capitol Sports Promotions gained fame in Puerto Rican homes soon after their TV show, &quot;Super Estrellas de la Lucha Libre&quot;, went on-air every weekend on channel 4, WAPA-TV. The taped show is still aired on weekends (both Saturday and Sunday for two hours until March 2008 when it was reduced to one hour on both Saturdays and Sundays due to declining ratings). From 1973 to 1980 it aired on channel 11 (Telecadena Pérez Perry, then on Teleonce after the before mentioned went off the air), on channel 7 on Sunday evenings at 6pm and on Telemundo on Saturday mornings at 10am.

===Pinnacle (1980s)===
Capitol Sports Promotions began touring all over the island, and with the golden era of boxing in Puerto Rico limited only to Ponce and the metropolitan area of Puerto Rico, Capitol Sports Promotions took their shows to many, inner country towns where people were not used to seeing live in-ring sports events. As a result, Capitol&#x27;s shows usually filled the smaller town arenas. 
CSP also benefited from collaborations, including a talent exchange agreement with Mario Savoldi&#x27;s International Championship Wrestling (ICW).

During one specific stretch, CSP sold out a 30,000 venue at Bayamón during 13 consecutive shows. High-profile wrestlers were winning in the range of $3,000–5,000 per weekend.

In 1983, Rickin Sánchez had taken over as Capitol&#x27;s main promoter, as well as becoming one of the organization&#x27;s broadcasters on the television shows. He was joined by the already retired Savinovich. Some time later, Sánchez (and his production company R &amp; F Television) left the production of Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre due to some disagreements with the ownership of WWC. After these events, Savinovich became the main host of the programs.

The World Wrestling Council was a member National Wrestling Alliance from 1979 until 1987.

As the market remained a lucrative and &quot;hot territory&quot; within the organization, the presence of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship became ubiquitous in large events, predominantly represented by perennial headliner Ric Flair. On January 6, 1983, Colón defeated the latter to complete an unofficial run with the belt, retaining momentum afterwards and being ranked in &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Top 10&quot; throughout 1984.

===Death of Bruiser Brody (1988)===
On July 16, 1988, American star Bruiser Brody was stabbed at the locker room of the Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium in Bayamón, prior to a show. Brody died from the stab wounds later on that night. The man who stabbed him was fellow wrestler and booker José Huertas-González, known as Invader I. The two men had a real-life feud that led to a confrontation in the locker room that concluded with Brody receiving stab wounds to his chest and stomach. The only one to witness the series of events that ended in the death was WWC wrestler Tony Atlas. Atlas said he saw both men enter the shower area of the locker room (nobody actually heard or saw what went on in the shower). Atlas claims he looked over to Carlos Colón, and then heard sounds and saw Brody hunched over with González brandishing a bloody knife about to finish Brody off. Atlas and Colón rushed to keep them apart along with several angry wrestlers.

After Brody&#x27;s death, and the negative publicity that followed, WWC went through some difficult years. Mr. Jose Huertas-Gonzalez was acquitted by a jury after he testified in his own defense, and claimed self-defense. The witnesses who were supposed to testify about the murder claimed that they did not get their summons until after the trial was over.

===Rebrand (1990s)===
By the mid-1990s, with the NWA territorial system largely dismantled, the organization changed its official name to World Wrestling Council in order to proclaim its regional titles as world titles. Women also began to have an ever-increasing presence in the organization during that decade. WWC also experienced other problems, issues with immigration concerning the visas of Mexican wrestlers Villano III, Pierroth Jr., El Texano and Jerry Estrada while working an invasion angle with Asistencia Asesoría y Administración. On March 9, 1999, Jovica and Colón registered World Wrestling Council, Inc. at the Puerto Rico Department of State as president/agent and vice-president respectively.

===WWC vs. IWA-PR===
With the turn of the century came some changes that troubled the franchise. A promotion called International Wrestling Association (IWA-PR), promoted by Víctor Quiñones, became WWC&#x27;s biggest competitor when it made an alliance with wrestling giant the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) which in turn brought American superstars to IWA-PR.

WWC adopted a strict protocol of expelling problematic fans, such as those that threw objects to the ring, mimicking rival IWA. The promotion also used strategies outside the ring to undermine its competition, including tipping the Treasury Department when other promotions held events.

In 2001, WWC began a collaboration with the XWF, which saw Ray González and Carly Colón wrestle for the nascent promotion. Backstage footage of the tapings Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida were intermingled with an angle involving Barrabás and La Familia del Milenio. The angle would have led to a match between González and Hulk Hogan, with interactions between both being aired on Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre. Carlos Colón negotiated this participation, but it ultimately failed to materialize, the XWF stagnated as it failed to sell television rights for its content. Hogan himself left and returned to WWE.

On July 12, 2002, Colón, Sr. was involved in a discussion with Kobbo Santarrosa, host of Televicentro&#x27;s SuperXclusivo show. Five days later, there were reports that the incident had been adapted into an angle. 

Parallel to this, the promotion faced issues with the regularity of payment of several wrestlers, who failed to attend a card held on July 17, 2002. After three weeks of no-showing his scheduled dates, maineventer Ray González left the company and began negotiations with the IWA. On July 25, 2002, it was reported that WWC responded to González leaving by bringing in wrestlers from abroad, in particular from Florida, and had completed the arrangements to begin the airing of the XWF tapings as a tandem to WWC at Televicentro. 

On October 13, 2002, both promotions announced a card to be held on the same date and venue in Cayey venue for October 18. Ultimately, IWA presented its event, while WWC did not hold one on that day. On October 20, 2002, Televicentro aired Invasion 2002: El Especial en Vivo, a special show broadcast live as part of the interpromotional angle between WWC and XWF. WWC Continued promoting its product in Televicentro&#x27;s programming, this time as part of a multi-program collaboration that began with segments in a show named Zúmbate where a hidden camera prank was played on Laureano. The angle was continued at SuperXclusivo, where Colón and Santarosa reached a truce of sorts, but Laureano interrupted and argued with both. A wrestling special was then aired in Zúmbate, where several members of the roster performed. In the same program, three masked wrestlers that were supposedly randomly recruited were revealed to be Santarrosa, Carly and Eddie Colón, which led to Laureano attacking all three. 

On November 14, 2002, Laureano participated in another Televicentro show, this time Club Sunshine where he confronted Sunshine Logrono while the latter was performing under the wrestling-related character of Vitin Alicea. On November 18, 2002, the reintroduction of the Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship was announced. Entering into December, WWC led IWA in rating after the latter experienced a drop. Further expanding into the mainstream programming, Carly and Eddie Colón were also featured in a commercial for the ACE brand. 

In April 2003, a lawsuit against González led to the wrestler receiving a subpoena from a Marshall in an IWA show. On April 21, 2003, it was made public that El Nene left the promotion with the Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship in his possession. In May 2003, Santarosa was involved in another angle with WWC, this time with Alvarez. WWC announced this month that as part of an agreement with Memphis Wrestling, a tournament to crown the tag team champions of that promotion would be held in Puerto Rico, though no more details where unveiled. 

In May 2003, Juan Rivera and Eddie Colón encountered each other in a restaurant, entering into an argument about the practices and product of their respective promotions. The IWA turned this into an angle, where they belittled Colón as a &quot;fan&quot; of Armando Gorbea. On May 29, 2003, a copy of a letter that WWC sent to Telemundo in response for its use of the name &quot;TNT&quot; was made public. On June 1, 2003, it was revealed that the tournament for the titles announced weeks before was a plot device so that a new set of XWF World Tag Team Champions could be crowned in a phantom change. 

During the summer of 2003, the weekly edition of Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre suffered a modification, after Joe Don Smith left due to economic differences and the section that he hosted, Ringside con Joe Don Smith, was removed. A new section with Pantojas, titled Cara a cara con El Profe was soon introduced. On July 17, 2003, Thunder and Lightning appeared in Club Sunshine in order to promote Aniversario 2003. When Jose Huertas González joined the IWA, WWC retaliated by airing matches involving Bruiser Brody. The promotion escalated their attack by airing a match between both.
WWC continued trying to make crossovers by making moves to book Gino &quot;The Punisher&quot; Rochell, who was scheduled to an MMA event titled Tatami Tournament Championship 4 which was ultimately postponed and rescheduled to March 6, 2004. On September 6, 2003, the promotion brought Logrono as a special manager for an event, continuing its long-running collaboration with the WAPA-TV producer.

===Colón as promoter of WWE===
In early 2004, it was reported that WWC was interested in selling a fraction of its stocks to an investor, with Panda Energy and Jimmy Hart emerging as potential buyers. Despite the latter&#x27;s involvement, any future plans to relaunch XWF and work another joint angle were placed on hold. The continuation of the working relationship was teased in a backstage segment aired weeks later. As part of these conversations, Hart attended a WWC card held on February 21, 2004, bringing a group of potential investors with him. 

On March 23, 2004, WWC contracted Dutch Mantell as its new head booker. He was also stated to be involved in the ongoing conversations between Panda Energy and WWC. Soon afterwards it was reported that Eddie Colón had been chosen as Puerto Rico&#x27;s representative in NWA-TNA&#x27;s Americas X Cup tournament. However, his participation was postponed. The agreement brought further advantages, such as the move of NWA-TNA wrestler Abyss from IWA to WWC, and the arrival of Ron Killings. The IWA responded by contacting NWA-TNA and prohibiting the use of contracted wrestler Apolo, while they had a working relationship with WWC. 

On April 1, 2004, the promotion debuted a new segment in its programming named El Sandungueo Club hosted by Jose Rivera, Jr., which included invitees from other fields such as urban artists. However, the initiative was short-lived, as Rivera, Jr. was forced to leave Puerto Rico to attend personal matters. Soon afterwards, El Wizard Analiza with narrator Antonio Montesinos (better known by his ringname El Wizard), took prominence. The promotion made other changes to their programming, such as airing an hour long special dedicated to classic matches. The promotion&#x27;s association with NWA-TNA suffered a setback when WWE did not allow Carly Colón to wrestle Abyss, citing that it could be seen as an interpromotional match. During this timeframe, the promotion also held a card in the establishment of one of its long-time sponsors, Playa 79. The rivalry between promotions also resulted in occasional confrontations to ensure the availability of a venue. 

In May 2004, the schedule of a local AAA baseball league and rain, the promotion decided to enter a brief hiatus until June. During this timeframe, there was speculation that the promotion could close, with contracted wrestlers reporting internal instability. These concerns were exacerbated when Mantell left his post as head booker and returned to work full time with NWA-TNA in anticipation of the first editions of TNA Impact!, only collaborating with WWC in the booking of Abyss. Several talents decided to leave. The promotion responded by revamping its image, debuting a new logo on June 1, 2004. However, the assistance diminished and, combined with other unforeseen problems, this led to a series of cancelled cards. The promotion resumed operations and returned to Trinidad &amp; Tobago, eventually recovering some ground by having a now-heel Carly wrestle his brother at Aniversario. The passing of tropical storm Jeanne over Puerto Rico in September 2004 affected the organization of cards during this month due to a week-long blackout. Another cancellation was forced by the low turnout of a card that was scheduled the night of the return to action of boxing world champion Felix Trinidad against Ricardo Mayorga. 

During the offseason, the promotion modified the horary of their shows to accommodate special programming in the channel. In January 2005, WWC was forced to replace Abyss in his cards after the wrestler requested a release from TNA. 
In June 2005, it was announced that WWC would be involved in the production of a CD and DVD. That same week, it was announced that WWC would pay homage to Bruiser Brody in an eponymous cup. On July 7, 2005, WWC announced that they had reached an exclusivity contract with WWE and would collaborate in the staging of their Raw Live presentations. In August 2005, it was reported that WWE had further plans for both IWA and WWC.

===NWS partnership (2005–2006)===
During the final quarter of 2005, WWC entered into an alliance with emergent promotion New Wrestling Stars (NWS), which had just broken a working relationship with the IWA, and scheduled February 5, 2006 as tentative end of the alliance. Both promotions would collaborate in an angle where José Luis Rivera, José Chaparro and Cesar Vargas wanted to buy WWC, but were declined, beginning an inter-promotional war. Aniversario 2005 was a collaborative effort and featured a series between wrestlers of both promotions that was tied until the last match, where Carlito was booked to take the win for WWC by defeating Shane Sewell. In March it was announced that more wrestlers from NWA-TNA would be arriving.
In April, a fraction of NWS&#x27; directives split to form World Wrestling Stars (WWS). The promotion also lost its television spot to this new splinter. On April 19, 2006, the remaining representatives of NWS held a reunion to attend the crisis and decided to continue operating under a new agreement with WWC, which allowed them to replace the lost show with a half-hour segment in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre titled NWS Report. The promotion also allowed some of its talent to participate in a charity show organized by New Wrestling Generation (NWG).
During the last week of June, German Figueroa left the IWA for NWS despite remaining under contract, making an appearance in one of its cards. Victor Jovica decided not to air the segment in the NWS Report in order to avoid legal repercussions. The following week, NWS was forced to cancel a show due to a problem with WWC&#x27; s promoter, beginning an internal conflict between both promotions. On July 8, 2006, it was reported that NWS and WWC had finished their agreement, cancelling the airing of the NWS Report in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre.

===Collaborations===
On July 9, 2006, it was reported that the IWA-PR and WWC administrations had discussed the possibility of cooperating with each other, even discussing a potential inter-promotional angle. Universal champion Black Pain made several appearances for NWG while the independent promotion responded in kind by dedicating a cup to Carlos Colón. 
WWC also organized a softball team, which participated in games in communities. In late October, Colón was involved in a legitimate confrontation with Huertas at Super Xclusivo, which WWC repurposed for promotion. In November the promotion participated in activities to celebrate Children&#x27;s Day.

That same month, WWC was involved in a dispute with independent promotion PRWA, which claimed that Colón, Sr. and Jovica prevented the participation of Eddie Colón in one of its cards. On November 24, 2006, it was reported that WWC was expanding its programming to Supercanal 33 in the Dominican Republic, giving it more exposition in the United States since the channel retransmits there. In December 2006, the promotion negotiated the acquisition of several talents, including foreigners Scott Hall and Vampiro. This last return was coordinated by Mario Savoldi. However, the first was preemptively removed from promotional material after suddenly cutting communications.

===La Rabia, heist of the Universal Heavyweight Championship (2007–2008)===
In February 2007, WWC aired a special three hour edition of Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre. During this month, the promotion also lost one of its foreign wrestlers in Tim Arson, but evaluated Psychosis and Lita. For Honor vs. Traicion, the promotion brought back Dutch Mantell. Jovica was also involved in the promotion of a Monster Truck show where Jerry Lawler was involved. In March, WWC began working parallel angles in Dominican television to promote a series of shows to be held there. In March, Savoldi and WWC&#x27;s administration were involved in a conflict and Billy Kidman and Psychosis, who had been announced to appear in cards during this month, jumped to IWA when the agent joined that promotion. In May, WWC announced that they would host their Aniversario event at the Jose Miguel Agrelot Coliseum. In June, the promotion was involved in negotiations with several wrestlers, including Ray González and the tag team Thunder and Lightning. These would include the negotiations surrounding an ongoing lawsuit that Jovica filed against González when he first left to the IWA. During this time, Carmen Calixto served a promoter for WWC. Besides securing the appearance of Scott Hall, WWC also negotiated with TNA talents, leading to a match between WWE signee and TNA wrestler Christian Cage. In July 2007, WWC acquired Hector Melendez then-Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion&#x27;s booker and a former IWA and TNA writer. Besides holding an open press conference, the promotion expanded their promotions to several stations beside WAPA-TV, including Univision and radio stations WKAQ AM and Salsoul. That same month, WWC announced a partnership with All Japan Pro Wrestling that resulted in The Great Muta and Nosawa appearing in their cards. The entrance of Melendez resulted in several IWA wrestlers with ties to him appearing in WWC programming with their identities concealed. In September it was announced that Carlos Colón had held reunions with WWE to evaluate the possibility of WWC becoming a developmental territory and other business aspects.
After it was revealed that Jovica was founding rebel group La Rabia, &quot;Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre&quot; was broadcast from a set lacking the WWC logo and using LRWA, with the stable hosting Lo que esta Pasando. Its cards were promoted as &quot;WWC and LRWA presents&quot; to sell the angle. In November WWC announced its return to Jose Miguel Agrelot Coliseum. In December, it was reported that Colón, Sr. had held reunions with John Lauraniatis about becoming a developmental territory in exchange for talent appearances, but WWE had no interest because its shows in Puerto Rico already sold well and it did not need further promotion, preferring to only keep Colón as its local promoter. Ultimately it was reported that WWC was under consideration, but that it was discarded due to the differences of in-ring style.
Instead, the promotion announced Chris Masters, and international talents Ron Killings, ultimo dragon and former WCW talents Konnan and Scott Hall, despite being stripped at Lockout for no showing the cards due to being &quot;in no condition&quot; to wrestle. That same month, WWC announced the release of another DVD, Anniversary 1985–1988.
None of La Rabia members made their scheduled appearances for the first date of the Euphoria tour. Following the absences, it was reported that there had been conversations between the group and IWA during the offseason. On January 6, 2008, Big made a surprise appearance at Histeria Boricua while carrying WWC&#x27;s Universal heavyweight Championship belt and challenged the IWA World Heavyweight Champion, his former partner Lozada, to an unification match. After he made his initial appearance, WWC&#x27;s merchandising executive Jose Roberto Rodriguez entered the building and demanded that the belt was returned, but IWA personnel had taken the belt elsewhere and Salovi confronted him. For the unification, Big carried the Revolution X-Treme wrestling belt that belonged to Rivera and lost the match to Lozada. 
In an interview with mainstream newspaper Primera Hora, Colón, Sr. denied that Big was still champion and warned that they would pursue a case for illegal appropriation if the belt wasn&#x27;t immediately returned. The promoter also claimed that Melendez and La Rabia were aware that they would be fired and decided to do a preemptive strike. For its following program, IWA announced that they would air footage of the event, which was done in an edited fashion. In an NWA Report, the IWA announced that they would retire the old belt and introduce a new one to represent the Undisputed Championship. WWC responded by airing a segment where it boasted putting down La Rabia (which is translated as &quot;The Rabies&quot;) and aired a segment where the commission and insisted that Big wasn&#x27;t champion at Histeria Boricua.

===Format changes===
In February, one of WWC&#x27;s talents, Joe Bravo, made an appearance in Club Sunshine. In March, WWC cancelled its cards and programming for the weekend where primaries where political held. On March 22, 2008, it was reported that WAPA-TV had decided to cut two hours of programming to WWC&#x27;s Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre block. These changes where not reflected in their Wapa America shows. On April 27, 2008, WWC changed the programming hour to accommodate political affairs. In May 2008, WWC announced that after participating in a tryout mediated by the promotion, Black Pain had signed with WWE. That same month, WWC laid off several members of its mostly inactive female division.
For Aniversario, WWC decided to bring foreign talent once again, this time Bobby Lashley. On June 12, 2008, an interview with Univision&#x27;s Anda pal Cara show served to sell an angle where González interrupted an interview of Colón, Sr. and Carly Colón and revealed his identity.

Entering July, WWC made a number of announcements including the firing of Bryan, that Trevor Murdoch would face Eddie Colón at Aniversario and that the winner of the tournament for the Universal Championship would receive a new belt. The promotion also aired specials about Carlito Colón and Ray González to promote their upcoming match. During this time, WWC also held negotiations with Steve Corino to join the promotion as an active talent and booker. He joined other talents such as Eugene for Aniversario, Chessman and Teddy Hart were announced but removed later.
Following Aniversario, WWC arranged to bring Christopher Daniels to serve as challenger for the new Universal Champion, Noriega. The promotion began bringing former champions to challenge for the belt, integrating Shane Sewell and contacting Black Pain, who did not join. WWC also revamped its television show.

In August 2008, both WWC and IWA lost talents to the re-branded EWO, in the case of the promotion these were of talents and included Universal Heavyweight Champion Noriega. This damaged the creative plans that WWC had with the wrestler, which included more defenses against international talents with arrangements with wrestlers such as Samoa Joe being made. This incident was combined with other complications, such as suspending a card. WWC took measures such as bringing in Corino for a longer run. On September 20, 2008, Jovica announced the adoption of new rules, including that throwing a wrestler over the third rope would result in a disqualification.

In October, the promotion announced the incorporation of foreign talents Ramón Alvarez and Slash Venom.
Prior to the 2008 general elections, the promotion accommodated a candidate for the PPR in its programming. The promotion also cancelled one of its cards in October.

===Reliance on international talent===
In November, the promotion announced that Sabu, the Dudley Boyz, Elijah Burke, Armando Alejandro Estrada and Balls Mahoney would appear at Lockout, where a ceremony for Abdullah the Butchers purported retirement from wrestling would take place. A plaque was presented and among the wrestlers present in the event was Smith Hart.

For Euphoria, WWC made arrangements to bring several foreign talents, including Big Daddy V and Eugene, which were expected to join those that appeared at Lockout. After being contracted foe Euphoria, the promotion also extended Ricky Reyes&#x27;s stay. In February, WWC announced the arrival of Idol Stevens.
After reports claimed that Laureano was leaving for PRWA, WWC clarified that this was inaccurate. The promotion also scheduled Sabu for a return. For La Hora de La Verdad, WWC held a promotion allusive to their association with WWE, awarding tickets for 12 Rounds along a limited number of ringside tickets. 
In March, WWC made several announcements including the delay of Rudy&#x27;s return to the ring and the creation of a new webpage.
After IWA announced the return of Sewell to its roster, WWC made arrangements so that he would join them instead. Despite having to cancel a card in April, WWC announced the incorporation of female wrestlers.
The promotion cut its ties with Sara Jay due to discipline issues.
Aniversario 2009 was dedicated to Hugo Savinovich, who began his career as a commentator at WWC. To promote the event, the WWC arranged for González to be interviewed in Salsoul. It also participated in charity visits during the Dia del Fanatico. In May, WWC held a press conference and announced the card and notified that besides The Colóns, MVP and Umaga would be at Aniversario.
After being released from TNA, Sewell confirmed his fulltime return to WWC. In June WWC announced several more promotional stunts, including a pre-event party and the integration of former boxing world champion Félix Trinidad to serve as referee of the main event. The promotion also contracted former IWA commenter, Axel Cruz. 
Prior to Aniversario, WWC announced a recess, the involvement of several media personalities and the incorporation of more talent, including Stacy Brooks, ODB, Figueroa and Ken Anderson, to the event. WWC aired promos filmed at the WWE offices and TNA&#x27;s Impact Zone.

In July, WWC continued their widespread promotional tour, despite suffering the loss of MVP. In the process, the IWA booked OBD to a future date despite her scheduled appearance at WWC, airing a promo segment. The promotion also held a pre-event party. WWC filmed Aniversario 2009 with the intent of turning it into a DVD narrated by Savinovich and Carlos Cabrera, WWE&#x27;s Spanish commentators. 
At the event, Savinovich announced that he would produce the following two Aniversarios. However, the surprise appearance of Noriega upset Corino, who felt that months of pushing BJ had been damaged and left the promotion. During this time, the promotion also signed Ricky Steamboat Jr., who debuted on July 24, 2009. Following Aniversario 2009, the promotion reintroduced a revamped website. For Summer Madness, WWC brought Ricky Steamboat, Sr. to team with his son.

Following a hiatus during which a series of WWE house shows were held in Puerto Rico, the promotion was forced to cancel an event and reorganize their schedule. Prior to Septiembre Negro, the promotion made moves in its roster to incorporate former IWA World Heavyweight Champion Bison Smith, but his debut was delayed due to a Japan tour. The relationship between WWC and Trinidad became strained prior to Halloween Wrestling Xtravaganza 2009, removing him from scheduled appearances. Plans made for a match between the boxer and Orlando Colón were dropped when he decided not to wrestle.
WWC opted to close the 2009 season early with a Crossfire PPV, for which they introduced new HD cameras. Despite this, a show called &quot;WWC goes to St. Thomas&quot; was scheduled to take place in the Virgin Islands during the offseason.

===Savio Vega and legal battle with IWA-PR===
After recovering Bryan, WWC began promoting the &quot;unimaginable&quot;, later revealed to be the debut of Ricky Banderas for the promotion. The arrival marked the latest in a series of attempts to take the wrestler away from the IWA, and served to set a match against Carly Colón to open the 2010 season. It was later revealed that the negotiations had been carried out by Hugo Savinovich. AAA promoted the move in Mexico.

In December the promotion made a series of moves, enrolling new editor Alberto Rodriguez and the signing of Mr. Kennedy for the Euphoria show to be held at the Coliseum of Puerto Rico. After WWC spoiled that Sewell had left to join to join the IWA and make a surprise appearance at Christmas in PR, they responded by filing a lawsuit prohibiting the use of the character of &quot;Ricky Banderas&quot; and forcing the use of &quot;El Triple Mega Campeon&quot; as replacement. WWC&#x27;s own Gorbea refute the content of the press release, becoming involved in a public dispute with BJ. During the offseason, WWC loaned talents Diaz and Gorbea as well as referee Angel Fashion, to independent promotion NPW. During the offseason, the promotion loaned talent to be used in the season closer of independent promotions HWR and CWF.

On January 9, 2010, it was reported that WWE had released Pain. WWC made moves to secure his return to the promotion, later announcing his return as well as Laureano&#x27;s. To promote the arrival of Banderas, WWC once again recurred to promoting itself on Wapa, appearing in Logrono&#x27;s show Sunshine Remix along González. The promotion contracted Eric Perez as soon as he was released from his WWE contract.

In February 2010, WWC declared the Women&#x27;s Championship vacant due to failure to defend and inactivated the division citing a lack of female talent. As Orlando Colón left for WWE, WWC incorporated Scott Steiner to its roster. In March, WWC cancelled a card without previous notification and reactivated the female division. Savinovich produced Aniversario 2010, while the previous event was released in DVD. In April 2010, WWC continued cancelling events. Though it brought several foreign stars such as Steiner and Shelton Benjamin for Aniversario, WWC lost Carlito following his release from WWE. Weather conditions also led to the cancellation of another card. Afterwards, they backtracked on removing Carlito from Aniversario, which was dedicated to Pedro Castillo. As Aniversario approached, more talent was added, and rumors swirled that IWA owner Savio Vega would appear in the event. Prior to the event, WWC brought Ricky Banderas as referee and switched Katie Lee Burchill for OBD due to visa issues. The approaches to Vega eventually concluded in a skit where he appeared alongside Carlos Colón in a television show insulting Carlito. This angle was well received, receiving an approval of 64% among polled wrestling fans. IWA emphasized it in its programming, while WWC did not. Ultimately, the angle was abandoned before Aniversario. Afterwards, several matches were confirmed for the event. A documentary of WWC&#x27;s history was announced by Wrestling Observer Shoots.
In July 2010, WWC returned to Trinidad and Tobago in an event that featured Victor Jovica&#x27;s retirement match. It also held conversations with the intention of hosting more frequent, likely monthly, events in the region. For Aniversario, WWC brought Booker T. Afterwards, WWC lost Idol Stevens to WWE. A return to Trinidad and Tobago was announced for October. In August, WWC continued having issues with the cancellation of events. Hugo Savinovich continued with an on-screen role. WWC had issues being forced to move venues, while its show did not go to air due to weather conditions. In August 2010, WWC moved its headquarters from Santurce to Hato Rey, also in San Juan. With Carlos Colón promoting WWE, he held contests in conjunction with WWC. WWC brought in DWE president Rico Casanova, emphasizing the role and launching an interpromotional angle. WWC promoted a match between Eddie Colón and Hideo Saito as an interpromotional, WWE vs. NJPW, encounter. As IWA claimed ownership of the character of &quot;El Mesias&quot; Ricky Banderas, WWC billed the wrestler as &quot;El Hombre que ellos llaman El Mesías Ricky Banderas&quot; and &quot;El Mega Campeón&quot;. The public perception of WWC&#x27;s product improved during this year. For Euphoria 2011, WWC continued relying on former WWE wrestlers and brought MVP.

During this time frame Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre consisted of airing taped matches, Lo que Está Pasando hosted by Alejandro Rodil, El Wizard Analiza and Clásicos de la Lucha Libre. However, WWC made some changes and introduced a new section named La Opinión de Gilbert, which temporarily replaced El Wizard Analiza. José Herrera and Abel Durant were featured in recurrent roles along Montesinos and Rodil. Jerry Rodríguez also had a recurrent role as a narrator and occasional host of Lo Que Está Pasando.

The promotion resumed its work with charity and held tryouts.

===La Invasión and derivative angles===
Prior to Aniversario, WWC promoted in the mainstream media including NotiUNO. It was, however, forced to cancel a card when its truck failed. WWC supplemented the card with TNA knockout Sarita, longstanding TNA talent Abyss and exWWE Chavo Guerrero. One of the cards was moved due to a scheduling conflict with the BSN. Steve Corino was announced, but his appearance was cancelled.
Days before the celebration of the event, WWC began teasing about an &quot;explosive&quot; storyline. Savio Vega initially denied the implication that he was involved. Instead, as references were made to IWA in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre, Thunder and Lightning appeared. Vega once again denied that the &quot;invasion&quot; was going on. Despite this, both sides continued in negotiations and ultimately reached an agreement late in the final week, with Vega appearing in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre. Thunder and Lightning remained the storyline representatives of IWA in WWC. IWA hyped the arrival of WWC wrestlers to Summer Attitude, mentioning Carlito. The angle was well received by the wrestling fans of Puerto Rico. Vega mentioned that both Miguel Pérez and Victor Jovica opposed to the idea, though he stated that Perez later warmed up to it. Four chairs were reserved for IWA the first night of Aniversario 2011, with Thunder and Lightning hinting that they were not alone. The main night of Aniversario, Los Fujitivos wrestled Thunder and Lightning to a no contest in a match were two referees, representing WWC and IWA, counted at the same time. Afterwards, Savio Vega accompanied by a host of IWA wrestlers including Dennis Rivera, Noel Rodiguez, Spectro, Hiram Tua and Carlos Cotto attacked them. He insulted Shane Sewell, Mr. Big and Blitz due to their association with WWC at the moment and insulted Carlito. At IWA Summer Attitude, Gilbert interrupted an homage to Victor Quiñones, prompting a confrontation with Savio Vega. He was backed by WWC wrestlers Díaz, Los Rabiosos, Los Fujitivos and Shane Sewell. The invading team was repelled by the IWA-PR roster, but accepted a challenge issued by Vega. WWC recorded the intervention. WWC aired footage of the intervention of its wrestlers at Summer Attitude. Colón answered the insults thrown at him by Savio Vega in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre. WWC cancelled a card due to weather conditions. The collaboration was cancelled when both promotions failed to reach an economic agreement. A tropical storm led to another cancelled card. WWC gave its side of the cancellation in its programming.

Despite the failure of the collaboration, Los Dueños de la Malicia appeared in Superestrellas and challenged Los Fujitivos for the WWC World Tag Team Championship. At Septiembre Negro they won the match, immediately leaving the venue afterwards. WWC used the commission as a plot device to declare the titles held up, reaffirming the posture later in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre. Despite refusing to return the belts to WWC, when interviewed by mainstream media outlet NotiCel Los Dueños de la Malicia assured that they &quot;had not stolen anything&quot; and were the legitimate champions per the rules of professional wrestling. The report also noted that the actions that followed the event were not part of a storyline. WWC later changed the official result of the match through the commissioners, declaring it null and declared that Los Fujitivos remained champions. For Halloween Wrestling Xtravaganza, WWC brought Blue Demon Jr. In its programming, El Wizard Analiza returned to coexist along La Opinión de Gilbert. Alejandro Rodil returned to host Lo que esta pasando en WWC. Savio Vega reappeared in WWC, challenging Carlito both in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre and Euphoria. Afterwards, Carlito answered. They cancelled a card in February. WWC once again relied on Primo and Epico, exWWE talent for Aniversario and brought Banderas and ROH World Heavyweight Champion Davey Richards. In April, the promotion cancelled another card citing weather conditions. The pattern continued in May, when it cancelled a card due to low turnout. One of its referees died. As IWA-PR entered a prolonged hiatus, WWC brought Andy Levine and Wes Brisco to spend a season in the company. In October 2012, JBL claimed during a WWE show that Carlos Colón owed him money. In March 2013, WWC debuted new belts commissioned to Top Rope. The promotion cancelled a card at Mayagüez due to low attendance. Towards the end of the year, WWC experienced some instability in its roster, with three wrestlers leaving, Gilbert initially announcing that he was leaving and Ricky Banderas being replaced for Euphoria. On April 16, 2014, World Wrestling Council, Inc. was revoked as the underlying corporation for the brand. An identically named entity being registered on March 3, 2015.

===Fallout of hurricane Maria (2017–2019)===
Following the passing of Hurricane Maria over Puerto Rico, the WWC headquarters lost power for a prolonged time period due to infrastructure damage. In response, the promotion issued licenses to some of its wrestlers to participate in the local independent scene, barring some creative limitations that prevented them from being booked in clean defeats. As of December 2017, WWC&#x27;s one-hour weekend shows on WAPA-TV continued to rerun the last several episodes produced prior to Maria. Almost five months after the hurricane, WWC confirmed its return with new episodes of the weekend shows (consisting of newly recorded commentary and interview segments mixed with repeats of high-profile matches) leading up to a new live event on March 3, 2018. For Aniversario, the promotion announced Jake Swagger, Del Rio and the Briscoes. Still relying on foreign talent, WWC announced Mark Henry for Septiembre Negro, but later retracted the name as the card underwent several changes including the absence of an announced Eddie Colón. In November 2018, it was reported that WWC had finalized the sale of its video library to WWE.

On July 23, 2018, longtime talent Ramón Álvarez (a.k.a. El Bronco No. 1) and Engel Landolfi unveiled a spinoff based in the Dominican Republic, WWC DR, receiving the support of Colón and Jovica (who loaned both the trade name and logo for use). Its first event was scheduled for October 28, 2018, featuring talent from both WWC (such as Carlito, Gilbert, Thunder and Lightning) and local competitor WWL (Superstar Ash, Ángel Fashion and Vanilla Vargas).

In November 2018, WWE acquired the WWC video library.

===IWA-PR, pandemic and LAWE (2019–2021)===
While still part of WWE&#x27;s roster (yet inactive), Eddie and Orlando Colón returned to WWC, working in both administrative roles and as in-ring talent in 2019. Ray González was brought back in and placed in a creative role that was described onscreen as Director of Operations. As the new administration became more involved backstage, WWC introduced elements to its product, including a new logo.
In February 2020, WWC and IWA-PR began a second inter-promotional angle, which featured Savio Vega and Ray González &quot;crossing the line&quot; and appearing in the other promotion.

On February 13, 2020, a video where Ray González extended an invitation to Savio Vega (now acting as president of the IWA-PR after it emerged from a hiatus in 2018) to attend a WWC to present him with a proposal that would be mutually beneficial was posted in the IWA-PR&#x27;s social media platforms. After some anticipation, the summon was accepted in a subsequent segment aired in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre. On February 15, 2020, Vega accepted a copy of the document from González and informed that he would give his final answer at the IWA-PR event Histeria Boricua 2020. During this skit, the heel faction known as Legacy (composed by Eddie Colón, Gilbert and Peter John Ramos) were placed in antagonism to the agreement.

During the pandemic, WWC had scant activity and was forced to cancel joint event Alianza Letal. They aired Aniversario to cope with the lack of new material. In the summer of 2020 the promotion announced its intention to return to hosting cards, which didn&#x27;t happen due to government restrictions. Instead, the promotion began filming in a public-less venue, filming Cuentas Pendientes which was originally intended as an iPPV but was ultimately used to fill the gap in programming. The collaboration with IWA-PR concluded in June 2021 when, according to Vega, WWC stopped answering his calls.

In March 2021 a promotion named Latin American Wrestling Entertainment (LAWE) was inscribed in the Puerto Rico Department of State with Eddie Colón as its president. In June Mike Chioda publicly revealed his involvement in the project. It officially launched in July, with Stacy Colón as its onscreen CEO. LAWE began announcing the signing of several wrestlers, among who was the incumbent Universal Heavyweight Champion Gilbert. The Colón cousins were also part of these roster additions. WWC avoided updating its status, but their YouTube channel was emptied and its official Facebook page was repurposed by former narrator Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; Montesinos. LAWE had a separate structure, including social media presence.

On August 25, 2021, it was reported that the Colóns intended a merger by purchasing the shares owned by Victor Jovica. When negotiations failed to reach and agreement, all but Orlando and José Colón left LAWE. On August 30, 2021, WWC announced that it would resume the organization of events led by Carlos Colón, González and Jovica. Ultimately, Orlando remained operating LAWE. The promotion made its return card on March. A rise in COVID-19 cases due to variants and government restrictions forced WWC to cancel Aniversario 2021. Still plagued by low attendance and instability, WWC brought Ric Flair and his son-in-law Andrade for Aniversario 2022.

===50th anniversary (2023)===
By reaching its quinquagenarian year of existence in 2023, WWC became the eighth promotion in the world to operate continuously for that amount of time after Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (established in 1933), the NWA (1948), WWE (1953), ECWA (1967) All Star Wrestling in the United Kingdom (1970) and New Japan Pro Wrestling/All Japan Pro Wrestling (1972). The promotion began analyzing the possibility of expanding operations to the state of Florida, where a large Puerto Rican fanbase continues to grow. As Aniversario 50 approached, WWC brought back José Roberto Rodríguez and Hugo Savinovich as backstage staff working on production.

<doc id="1255434" wikidata="Q666017" url="?curid=1255434" title="Europa (1991 film)">
<text>Europa (known as Zentropa in North America) is a 1991 experimental psychological drama period film directed and co-written by Lars von Trier. An international co-production between Denmark and five other European countries, this is von Trier&#x27;s third theatrical feature film, and the third and final installment in his Europa trilogy, following &quot;The Element of Crime&quot; (1984) and &quot;Epidemic&quot; (1987).

The film features an international ensemble cast, including Germans Barbara Sukowa and Udo Kier, expatriate American Eddie Constantine, and Swedes Max von Sydow and Ernst-Hugo Järegård. This was German-born French-American Jean-Marc Barr&#x27;s first collaboration of a series of films with von Trier.

&quot;Europa&quot; was influenced by Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;Amerika&quot;, and the title was chosen &quot;as an echo&quot; of that novel. The music, including the main theme, was composed by von Trier&#x27;s then brother-in-law and frequent collaborator Joachim Holbek, who also composed &quot;Riget&quot; (1991–2022) and &quot;Manderlay&quot; (2005).

== Plot ==
In the U.S.-occupied zone of Germany after the end of World War II, the entire population is under close surveillance.

A young American of German descent, Leopold Kessler, comes to Germany and gets a job as a train conductor for the railway company Zentropa with his uncle. Leopold sees Germany from the perspective of moving trains, train stations or dormitories. As he tries unsuccessfully to conform to society&#x27;s rules, he witnesses the country&#x27;s inner turmoil and the aftermath of its recent past.

Before that, he falls in love with a young German woman, Katharina, the younger sister of Lawrence Hartmann and daughter of the founder of Zentropa, Max Hartmann, who is secretly associated with a group of underground Nazi terrorist conspiracy Werwolf. Katharina invites Kessler to dinner at her half-bombed family mansion. With the help of false testimony from a Jewish American, who claims he was the lifesaver, Max Hartmann receives a clean bill of health and is rehabilitated, but he later commits suicide out of shame. Later, Leopold marries Katharina in the cathedral, but shortly afterwards she disappears without a trace.

One day, the Werwolf group demands that Kessler use explosives to blow up the train. He makes the necessary preparations, but he then rediscovers Katharina, who makes the same demand of him. He tries to tell an American officer about the explosives, but circumstances prevent him from doing so. At this time, Leopold&#x27;s superiors are trying to test his professional suitability. In desperation, he plants the explosives and sets the clockwork, but pity for the potential victims makes him turn it off.

In the meantime, the occupation authorities have uncovered the Werwolf cell. Kessler sees Katharina in handcuffs. She convinces him that it was he who made the mistake, because there are no innocent people in Germany, since during the war years its citizens either killed or betrayed. Kessler, driven to despair, pulls the emergency brake to prevent the train from leaving Germany, and reluctantly decides to detonate the explosives after all. As a result, one of the trains explodes on the bridge as intended. It crashes into the river and several people are killed, including Kessler&#x27;s uncle and Katharina. Kessler too is drowned in the sunken train, and floats out to sea.

== Cast ==
== Style ==

&quot;Europa&quot; employs an experimental style of cinema, combining largely black and white visuals with occasional intrusions of colour (which later inspired Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1993 Holocaust film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;), having actors interact with rear-projected footage, and layering different images over one another to surreal effect. The voice-over narration uses an unconventional second-person narrative imitative of a hypnotist.

The film&#x27;s characters, music, dialogue, and plot are self-consciously melodramatic and ironically imitative of film noir conventions.

Morando Morandini writes: &quot;More than the characters, what counts is the technical-formalistic apparatus: color contrasted with black and white, superimpositions, distorting lenses, dynamic camera, expressionistic-style set designs. Anti-German in substance, it is profoundly German in form&quot;.

== Production ==
The film was shot throughout Poland (Chojna Cathedral (Marienkirche) and the Chojna Roundhouse) and in Denmark (Nordisk Film studios, Copenhagen and the Copenhagen Dansk Hydraulisk Institut). The cathedral where the main characters are getting married is that of Chojna, whose roof was destroyed by the Soviet army during the war.

Von Trier&#x27;s production company, Zentropa Entertainments, is named after the sinister railway network featured in this film, which is in turn named after the real-life train company Mitropa.

== Reception ==
&quot;Europa&quot; was released as &quot;Zentropa&quot; in North America to avoid confusion with &quot;Europa Europa&quot; (1990).

=== Critical reception ===

The film received largely positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 82% score based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10.

The Lexicon of International Film gave a positive review: &quot;A straightforwardly told mixture of thriller and melodrama, which is based on the classic role models of the genres, but goes beyond the given limits due to its unusual visual creative will. At the same time, an attempt is made to use film as a means of mass suggestion. Worth seeing because of the optically sophisticated form&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
The film won three awards at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival (Best Artistic Contribution, Jury Prize, and Technical Grand Prize). Upon realizing that he had not won the Palme d&#x27;Or, von Trier gave the judges the finger and stormed out of the venue.

In 1991, the film received the Grand Prix for Best Film at Film Fest Gent.

== Home media ==
The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD in 2008. The package contained several documentaries on the film and an audio commentary by von Trier. In 2023, Criterion released a 4K restoration of the film as part of the Blu-ray box set, &quot;Lars von Trier&#x27;s Europe Trilogy&quot;. Curzon Film also released their own 4K restoration in 2023 as a part of their Lars von Trier Collection box set.

<doc id="1255435" wikidata="Q2056049" url="?curid=1255435" title="Zero-X">
<text>Zero-X is a fictional Earth spacecraft that first appeared in two of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson&#x27;s Supermarionation productions, the film &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; (1966) and the television series &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;. Although publicity material for the various Supermarionation series, and the &quot;TV Century 21&quot; comic, made references to connections between the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; canons, &quot;Zero-X&quot; is the only official link between the two series.

==Design==
&quot;Zero-X&quot; was designed by Derek Meddings, whose original drawing named the craft &quot;ZX 26&quot;. AP Films commissioned Mastermodels in Slough to make two scale filming models. The larger of the pair, which was built at a cost of £2,500 (), was long and weighed . The puppet set design of the cockpit was inspired by the interiors of Concorde, a prototype of which the crew viewed at Filton Airfield.

In 2012, the original MEV filming model, minus the cockpit canopy, was acquired by prop restoration company The Prop Gallery, which commissioned the still-trading Mastermodels to refurbish the miniature that it had built 46 years earlier.

==Description==
The first crewed craft to land on Mars, the metallic-blue &quot;Zero-X&quot; comprises a number of detachable sections. The main body houses the chemical engines which provide the craft with the thrust required for lift-off and spaceflight. The Martian Excursion Vehicle (MEV; later renamed Martian &quot;Exploration&quot; Vehicle) is attached to the front of the main body where it serves as the craft&#x27;s main control centre. During atmospheric ingress or egress, two remotely controlled &quot;lifting bodies&quot; (self-propelled &quot;flying wing&quot; aerofoils) are attached to the main body at the front and rear. A heatproof nose cone protects the MEV during take-off and provides further aerodynamic flow to the vehicle during atmospheric ascent; it is jettisoned just before leaving the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and is the only non-reusable part of the spacecraft.

The lifting bodies act as wings to allow the craft to operate from a runway like a conventional aeroplane, and carry multiple jet engines to reduce the amount of fuel needed for the main body&#x27;s chemical engines. They separate from the main body when the craft is at a sufficiently high altitude and fly back to base; on re-entry, they rendezvous with the spacecraft and dock with it to again act as wings and provide propulsion in the atmosphere.

On reaching Mars, the MEV detaches from the main body, which is left in orbit piloted by a single astronaut, and descends towards the planet&#x27;s surface. At the surface the MEV extends caterpillar tracks to negotiate the rocky terrain.

&quot;Zero-X&quot; has a total velocity of per second and acceleration of up to 15 g in emergencies. It is built by New World Aircraft Corporation, the same company that builds &quot;Skyship One&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; (film)===
The first crewed mission to Mars ends in failure after the &quot;Zero-X&quot; is accidentally sabotaged by The Hood, who has stowed away on the craft to photograph its wing mechanisms. The crew manage to escape and two years later a second &quot;Zero-X&quot; craft successfully reaches Mars. After touching down on the surface, the MEV crew fire on a Martian &quot;rock snake&quot; believing it to be a lifeless rock formation, provoking retaliation by fire-shooting rock snakes. Although the crew escape, the lifting body control systems on the MEV take damage during the confrontation, causing the &quot;Zero-X&quot; to malfunction on its return to Earth. The craft crashes into Craigsville, United States (roughly 20 miles from its launch site, the fictitious Glenn Field Spaceport). The crew survive, saved at the last moment by International Rescue.

In both missions, the &quot;Zero-X&quot; carries a crew of five (including two scientists), led by Captain Paul Travers.

===Comics===
A series featuring the adventures of the crew of the &quot;Zero-X&quot; appeared in &quot;TV Century 21&quot; comic and its successors, including &quot;Countdown&quot;. The stories follow the &quot;Mark III&quot; &quot;Zero-X&quot; spacecraft as it explores the other planets of the Solar System before pushing on into interstellar space. They were written by Angus Allan and illustrated by Mike Noble, and ran in &quot;TV Century 21&quot; from January 1967 to September 1969.

===&quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;===
Recommissioned by the Spectrum Organisation, the &quot;Zero-X&quot; returns to Mars in 2068 in search of the source of alien signals detected on Earth. The crew&#x27;s hostile actions trigger a &quot;war of nerves&quot; with the Mysterons. After tracing the signals to the Mysterons&#x27; city, mission leader Captain Black gives the order to fire on the outpost after mistaking the Mysterons&#x27; imaging devices for weapons and fearing the MEV is about to be attacked. Following the destruction, the crew witness the re-materialisation of the Mysteron city and the Mysterons take control of Black&#x27;s mind. Black vanishes on the &quot;Zero-X&quot;″s return to Glenn Field, and soon after the Mysterons began hostilities against Earth.

===&quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; (TV series)===
The &quot;Zero-X&quot; appears in an episode of the remake series &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;: &quot;Signals, Part 1&quot;. During its launch, the &quot;Zero-X&quot; is stolen by The Hood for its lightspeed engines. Soon after, the engines begin to overload and threaten to create an extinction event on Earth. Jeff Tracy boards the &quot;Zero-X&quot; and attempts to take control while the Hood ejects in the only escape capsule. As Tracy attempts to take the &quot;Zero-X&quot; into space, there is a massive explosion and the craft is presumed destroyed. Eight years later, a distress signal is detected coming from the Oort cloud, seemingly from Tracy. International Rescue attempts to recover the &quot;Zero-X&quot; escape capsule, believing it to be the key to understanding how Tracy survived and his current situation. After analysing footage from the capsule, they determine that the witnessed explosion was actually an aftershock of the &quot;Zero-X&quot;″s engines firing at full power and that the &quot;Zero-X&quot; entered the Oort Cloud. In &quot;The Long Reach, Part 1&quot;, remains of the &quot;Zero-X&quot; are discovered on a minor planet where Tracy has survived for eight years. He is rescued by his sons in a new &quot;Zero-X&quot; called the &quot;Zero-XL&quot;.

==Critical response==
According to spaceflight historian Jack Hagerty, the way in which the MEV is deployed from the mothership was inspired by both the titular spacecraft of the Andersons&#x27; earlier puppet series &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; (whose cockpit section breaks off to form a lander, &quot;Fireball Junior&quot;) and the modular construction of the real-life Apollo spacecraft. He also states that the name &quot;MEV&quot; is based on &quot;LEM&quot; (Lunar Excursion Module), the original designation for the Apollo Lunar Module. Among other observations, Hagerty questions the names given for some of &quot;Zero-X&quot;″s components in &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;, stating that the craft&#x27;s so-called nose cone &quot;looks nothing like a cone&quot; and that its lifting bodies do not meet the technical definition a lifting body. He also regards the brevity of the Martian landing as a plot hole: &quot;After spending, presumably, many years and billions of dollars mounting this expedition to Mars, all they get for their effort is a couple of hours driving around on the surface.&quot; However, he calls the destruction of the &quot;Zero-X&quot; Mark II &quot;one of the most spectacular crash sequences ever filmed&quot;.

Stephen La Rivière calls &quot;Zero-X&quot; &quot;the star of &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;&quot;, praising Meddings&#x27; design and acknowledging its commercial nature: &quot;... cynics would suggest that the various detachable segments (wings and nose cone) had less to do with the storyline and more to do with potential toy manufacturing!&quot; Glenn Erickson considers &quot;Zero-X&quot; &quot;unwieldy&quot; and aesthetically inferior to &quot;Skyship One&quot; in the sequel &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot; (1968). Fred McNamara ranks &quot;Zero-X&quot; tenth in a list of &quot;greatest Supermarionation vehicles&quot;, describing it as a &quot;fabulous slice of pulpy retro vehicle porn&quot;. He adds that &quot;what stops it being further up the list is its jagged, boxy, rectangular design&quot;.

Alasdair Wilkins of io9 questions the design in that it is &quot;not especially aerodynamic-looking&quot;. He notes the craft&#x27;s protracted introduction in &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;, finding the film&#x27;s 10-minute opening launch sequence to be over-long: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty much the Alpha and Omega of launch sequences ... a sequence that threatens to make &quot;2001 [: A Space Odyssey]&quot; look like non-stop, thrill-a-minute action.&quot; He believes that with the attention to detail given to the various stages of the craft&#x27;s assembly and take-off, these scenes constitute &quot;launch sequence porn&quot;, elaborating: &quot;It&#x27;s a bunch of people effectively saying, &#x27;Action? Characters? Humour? Nah, forget all that. We know what the people really want to see, and it&#x27;s clearly the model-work.&#x27;&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; comments that the launch is presented &quot;with the ritual deliberation of a Greek Orthodox mass&quot;, while website Entertainment Focus calls the sequence &quot;meticulous&quot; and &quot;foreshadowing a mechanical ballet which would define [&quot;2001&quot;].&quot; Mark Bould considers it an example of the Anderson productions&#x27; &quot;technophilic model-work&quot;.

==Toys==
The spacecraft&#x27;s introduction in &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; was accompanied by the release of a radio-controlled toy version by J. Rosenthal (Toys) Ltd. Marketed as &quot;Five Toys in One&quot;, the product was put together from several detachable sections, similar to its assembly in the film. The remote control could also function as a walkie-talkie.

<doc id="1255445" wikidata="Q7745355" url="?curid=1255445" title="The Land Ironclads">
<text>&quot;The Land Ironclads&quot; is a short story by British writer H. G. Wells, which originally appeared in the December 1903 issue of the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot;. It features tank-like &quot;land ironclads,&quot; armoured fighting vehicles that carry riflemen, engineers, and a captain, and are armed with semi-automatic rifles.

==Plot summary==
The story opens with an unnamed war correspondent and a young lieutenant surveying the calm of the battlefield. They reflect philosophically on the war between two unidentified armies. The time appears to be 1903 and the opponents are dug into trenches, each waiting for the other to attack, of the sort then common and being reported on daily from the Boer War. The men on the war correspondent&#x27;s side are confident they will prevail, because they are all strong outdoor-types – men who know how to use a rifle and fight – while their enemies are townspeople, &quot;a crowd of devitalised townsmen . . . They&#x27;re clerks, they&#x27;re factory hands, they&#x27;re students, they&#x27;re civilised men. They can write, they can talk, they can make and do all sorts of things, but they&#x27;re poor amateurs at war.&quot; The men agree that their &quot;open air life&quot; produces men better suited to war than their opponents&#x27; &quot;decent civilization.&quot;

In the end, however, the &quot;decent civilization,&quot; with its men of science and engineers, triumphs over the &quot;better soldiers&quot; who, instead of developing land ironclads of their own, had been practising shooting their rifles from horseback, a tactic rendered obsolete by the land ironclads. Wells foreshadows this eventual outcome in the conversation of the two men in the first part, when the correspondent tells the lieutenant &quot;Civilization has science, you know, it invented and it made the rifles and guns and things you use.&quot;

The story ends with the entire contemporary army captured by thirteen land ironclads, with the defenders managing to disable only one. In the last scene, the correspondent compares his countrymen&#x27;s &quot;sturdy proportions with those of their lightly built captors&quot;, and thinks of the press story he is going to write about the experience. He notes that the captured officers are thinking of ways they will defeat tanks with their already-existing weaponry, rather than developing their own land ironclads to counter the new threat. He further notes that the &quot;half-dozen comparatively slender young men in blue pajamas who were standing about their victorious land ironclad, drinking coffee and eating biscuits, had also in their eyes and carriage something not altogether degraded below the level of a man.&quot;

== The Ironclads ==
The term &quot;ironclad&quot; was coined in the mid-19th century for steam-propelled ocean warships protected by iron or steel armour plates. By the time of Wells&#x27; story the notion became a commonplace of boys&#x27; literature in the U.S., in popular weekly series such as that published by Frank Reade, and which featured many &#x27;land ironclads&#x27; often with different designs each week. Wells&#x27; land ironclads are similar to these, described as steam powered and are &quot;essentially long, narrow, and very strong steel frameworks carrying the engines, and borne on eight pairs of big pedrail wheels, each about ten feet in diameter, each a driving wheel and set upon long axles free to swivel around a common axis. [...] the captain [...] had look-out points at small ports all round the upper edge of the adjustable skirt of twelve-inch ironplating which protected the whole affair, and [...] could also raise or depress a conning-tower set above the port-holes through the centre of the iron top cover.&quot;

Riflemen are installed in cabins in the &quot;monsters&quot;, being &quot;slung along the sides of and behind and before the great main framework&quot;. There the men operate what appear to be mechanically targeting, semi-automatic rifles.

== Impact ==
Contemporaries saw Wells&#x27; battle between countrymen &quot;defenders&quot; (who rely on cavalry and entrenched infantry) and attacking townsmen as echoing the Boer War, as well as being something of a re-tread of his 1898 novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; which also featured a struggle between technologically uneven protagonists. But the story served to contribute to Wells&#x27; growing reputation as a &quot;prophet of the future&quot;, something that many early socialists and newspaper editors were keen to promote., especially when real tanks first appeared on the battlefield 12 years later in 1916.

Wells&#x27;s story did predict the use of armoured vehicles in combat, but numerous authors (for example Sam Moskowitz in &quot;Science Fiction by Gaslight&quot;) have mistakenly stated that he also described modern caterpillar treads on a tank and did so before the tank&#x27;s invention. This is incorrect.

==Inspiration==
In his later &quot;War and the Future&quot; (1917), H. G. Wells specifically acknowledges Bramah Diplock&#x27;s pedrail wheel as the origin for his idea of an all-terrain armoured vehicle in &quot;The Land Ironclads&quot;:

Indeed, within the story itself the war correspondent, upon his first sight of the machine&#x27;s pedrails, recalls hearing about them from Diplock in person on a previous journalistic assignment.

According to one biographer, Wells initially had the idea for land ironclads using &quot;pedrails&quot; from an inventor J. W. Dunne, who spoke of &quot;big fat pedrail machines&quot; in a letter to Wells. Dunne later also influenced Wells&#x27;s novel &quot;The War in the Air&quot; (1908).

<text>Jeff Bennett (born October 2, 1962) is an American voice actor. He voiced the titular character of &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, Dexter and Dee Dee&#x27;s Dad in &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, Ace, Grubber, and Big Billy in &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, Peter Puppy in &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, Brooklyn in &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel in &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;, Clay Bailey in &quot;Xiaolin Showdown&quot;, Petrie in The Land Before Time franchise and Kowalski in the &quot;Penguins of Madagascar&quot; series (replacing Chris Miller). In 2012, Bennett was awarded an Annie Award for his role in &quot;The Penguins of Madagascar&quot; and in 2016, he was awarded an Emmy Award for his role in &quot;&quot;. He has been listed among the top names in the voice-over field.

==Early life==
Bennett was born in 1962 in Houston, Texas. He got his acting training on the stage at the Alley Theatre in Houston, before moving to California with his family in 1990.

==Career==
Bennett&#x27;s first role in the voice-over industry was Horace &quot;I.Q.&quot; Boothroyd the Third in &quot;James Bond Jr.&quot;.

Afterwards, more roles came which included Brooklyn in &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, Petrie in &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; series from the second film onward (replacing the late Will Ryan), Jitters A. Dog in &quot;Bonkers&quot;, Lord Camembert in &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot;, Roger Dearly, Lieutenant Pug and several others on &quot;101 Dalmatians: The Series&quot;, and Dexter&#x27;s Dad in &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;.

In early 1995, he played what would be his best-known role, the title character in &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; and &quot;Johnny Bravo and the Amazon Women&quot; in &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;. For the character, Bennett used an Elvis Presley impersonation, which was somewhere between the young and the older Presley. In 1997, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; was made into a television series. A cult hit show, it continued from 1997 to 2004, receiving praise and multiple Annie Award nominations, including one for Bennett.

He has also provided various voices in the animated series &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;, voicing characters such as The Huntsman, Cave Guy, Candle Jack, Lord Bravery, and many others.

Later, he did the voices of Drixenol &quot;Drix&quot; Koldriliff in &quot;Ozzy and Drix&quot; (replacing David Hyde Pierce), Clay Bailey on &quot;Xiaolin Showdown&quot;, Mister Boss and Mister Fizz in &quot;&quot;, Raj on &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;, Principal Luna and Jan Rongetes (janitor and Swedish air guitarist) on &quot;Class of 3000&quot;, Azmuth in &quot;Ben 10: Alien Force&quot; and &quot;Ben 10: Ultimate Alien&quot;, Mr. Smee and Bones on &quot;Jake and the Never Land Pirates&quot;.

Since 2006, Bennett has voiced the role of Peppermint Larry in the television show &quot;The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack&quot; from 2008 to 2010, and The Man With the Yellow Hat and neighborhood farmer Mr. Renkins in the PBS Kids TV series &quot;Curious George&quot;. The series was awarded Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Animated Program in 2008, 2010, and 2012.

Bennett has also done the voices of the Joker and other characters on &quot;&quot;, Dorkus in &quot;Planet Sheen&quot;, several characters (Keswick, Larry, and Ollie) on &quot;T.U.F.F. Puppy&quot;, Red Tornado in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, and Kowalski in &quot;The Penguins of Madagascar&quot;.

In 2012, Bennett was awarded the Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting in a Television Production for his role as Kowalski. He was also nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program, but lost to June Foray.

In 2016, Bennett won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program for his performance as Mayor Lusky on &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bennett has been married to Susan E. Welby since 1988 and has one daughter (born 1998).

<doc id="1255458" wikidata="Q4382845" url="?curid=1255458" title="Pseudogroup">
<text>In mathematics, a pseudogroup is a set of homeomorphisms between open sets of a space, satisfying group-like and sheaf-like properties. It is a generalisation of the concept of a group, originating however from the geometric approach of Sophus Lie to investigate symmetries of differential equations, rather than out of abstract algebra (such as quasigroup, for example). The modern theory of pseudogroups was developed by Élie Cartan in the early 1900s.

== Definition ==
A pseudogroup imposes several conditions on sets of homeomorphisms (respectively, diffeomorphisms) defined on open sets of a given Euclidean space or more generally of a fixed topological space (respectively, smooth manifold). Since two homeomorphisms and compose to a homeomorphism from to , one asks that the pseudogroup is closed under composition and inversion. However, unlike those for a group, the axioms defining a pseudogroup are not purely algebraic; the further requirements are related to the possibility of restricting and of patching homeomorphisms (similar to the gluing axiom for sections of a sheaf).

More precisely, a pseudogroup on a topological space is a collection of homeomorphisms between open subsets of satisfying the following properties:
# The domains of the elements in cover (&quot;cover&quot;).
# The restriction of an element in to any open set contained in its domain is also in (&quot;restriction&quot;).
# The composition of two elements of , when defined, is in (&quot;composition&quot;).
# The inverse of an element of is in (&quot;inverse&quot;).
# The property of lying in is local, i.e. if is a homeomorphism between open sets of and is covered by open sets with restricted to lying in for each , then also lies in (&quot;local&quot;).

As a consequence the identity homeomorphism of any open subset of lies in .

Similarly, a pseudogroup on a smooth manifold is defined as a collection of diffeomorphisms between open subsets of satisfying analogous properties (where we replace homeomorphisms with diffeomorphisms).

Two points in are said to be in the same orbit if an element of sends one to the other. Orbits of a pseudogroup clearly form a partition of ; a pseudogroup is called transitive if it has only one orbit.

== Examples ==
A widespread class of examples is given by pseudogroups preserving a given geometric structure. For instance, if is a Riemannian manifold, one has the pseudogroup of its local isometries; if is a symplectic manifold, one has the pseudogroup of its local symplectomorphisms; etc. These pseudogroups should be thought as the set of the &quot;local symmetries&quot; of these structures.

== Pseudogroups of symmetries and geometric structures ==
Manifolds with additional structures can often be defined using the pseudogroups of symmetries of a fixed local model. More precisely, given a pseudogroup , a -atlas on a topological space consists of a standard atlas on such that the changes of coordinates (i.e. the transition maps) belong to . An equivalent class of Γ-atlases is also called a -structure on .

In particular, when is the pseudogroup of all locally defined diffeomorphisms of , one recovers the standard notion of a smooth atlas and a smooth structure. More generally, one can define the following objects as -structures on a topological space :
* flat Riemannian structures, for pseudogroups of isometries of with the canonical Euclidean metric;
* symplectic structures, for the pseudogroup of symplectomorphisms of with the canonical symplectic form;
* analytic structures, for the pseudogroup of (real-)analytic diffeomorphisms of ;
* Riemann surfaces, for the pseudogroup of invertible holomorphic functions of a complex variable. 

More generally, any integrable -structure and any -manifold are special cases of -structures, for suitable pseudogroups .

== Pseudogroups and Lie theory ==
In general, pseudogroups were studied as a possible theory of infinite-dimensional Lie groups. The concept of a local Lie group, namely a pseudogroup of functions defined in neighbourhoods of the origin of a Euclidean space , is actually closer to Lie&#x27;s original concept of Lie group, in the case where the transformations involved depend on a finite number of parameters, than the contemporary definition via manifolds. One of Cartan&#x27;s achievements was to clarify the points involved, including the point that a local Lie group always gives rise to a &quot;global&quot; group, in the current sense (an analogue of Lie&#x27;s third theorem, on Lie algebras determining a group). The formal group is yet another approach to the specification of Lie groups, infinitesimally. It is known, however, that &quot;local topological groups&quot; do not necessarily have global counterparts.

Examples of infinite-dimensional pseudogroups abound, beginning with the pseudogroup of all diffeomorphisms of . The interest is mainly in sub-pseudogroups of the diffeomorphisms, and therefore with objects that have a Lie algebra analogue of vector fields. Methods proposed by Lie and by Cartan for studying these objects have become more practical given the progress of computer algebra.

In the 1950s, Cartan&#x27;s theory was reformulated by Shiing-Shen Chern, and a general deformation theory for pseudogroups was developed by Kunihiko Kodaira and D. C. Spencer. In the 1960s homological algebra was applied to the basic PDE questions involved, of over-determination; this though revealed that the algebra of the theory is potentially very heavy. In the same decade the interest for theoretical physics of infinite-dimensional Lie theory appeared for the first time, in the shape of current algebra.

Intuitively, a Lie pseudogroup should be a pseudogroup which &quot;originates&quot; from a system of PDEs. There are many similar but inequivalent notions in the literature; the &quot;right&quot; one depends on which application one has in mind. However, all these various approaches involve the (finite- or infinite-dimensional) jet bundles of , which are asked to be a Lie groupoid. In particular, a Lie pseudogroup is called of finite order if it can be &quot;reconstructed&quot; from the space of its -jets.

<text>John Hicklin Hall (July 17, 1854 – July 27, 1937) was a politician and attorney in the U.S. state of Oregon. A native of the Portland area, he served in the Oregon House of Representatives in the early 1890s before appointment as the United States District Attorney for Oregon. As the federal prosecutor, he became involved in the Oregon land fraud scandal, in which several high-profile public officials conspired to defraud the government in acquiring land for a private entity. Hall was convicted, but subsequently pardoned, for failing to prosecute some of the participants.

Hall was also the father of Oregon governor John H. Hall.

==Early life==
John Hall was born in Multnomah County, Oregon, east of the city of Portland on July 17, 1854. He was the son of Benjamin F. and Emily Hicklin Hall, though both parents died when he was ten, leaving him the family farm. Hall worked as a farm hand and for a railroad surveying crew while also receiving an education at both the Lafayette Academy and Portland High School. When he turned 21 he returned to the family farm to run it, and in 1877 was married to Olive I. Powell.

After getting married, the couple moved to Portland and opened a store, which he sold in 1885. Hall then read law for two years and passed the bar in October 1887. He then entered a legal partnership with W. E. Showers before appointment as a deputy district attorney in 1888 for Multnomah County. In 1890, he was elected to represent Multnomah County in the Oregon House of Representatives. A Republican, Hall served one two-year term, participating in the 1891 legislative session.

Hall was elevated to the position of chief deputy DA in 1892. He was married a second time December 25, 1895, to Jessie E. Belcher, and they had three children. In November 1897, Hall was appointed as the United States District Attorney for Oregon by U.S. President William McKinley.

==Oregon land fraud==
In 1903, U.S. Attorney General Philander Knox appointed Francis J. Heney to assist Hall in investigating allegations of land fraud in Oregon in a series of trials that became known as the Oregon land fraud scandal. Hall was uncooperative in the investigation, and was removed from office by President Theodore Roosevelt on January 1, 1905.

In 1907, Heney put Hall on trial for failing to prosecute land companies engaging in fraudulent activities, and for using his knowledge of illegal activities to blackmail his political opponents. On February 8, 1908, a jury found Hall guilty of the charges.

==Later years==
He was later pardoned by President William Howard Taft for his role in the land fraud scandal. Hall returned to private legal practice in Portland after being forced out of office. He also was involved with the banking industry, owned three farms, and was an investor in power generation projects in Deschutes County.

John Hicklin Hall died in Portland, Oregon, on July 27, 1937, at the age of 83 and was interred at River View Cemetery in Portland. His son, John Hubert Hall, was also active in Oregon politics, serving briefly as governor following the deaths of the first three elected officials in the state&#x27;s line of succession.

<doc id="1255466" wikidata="Q886026" url="?curid=1255466" title="Douglas McKay">
<text>James Douglas McKay (June 24, 1893 – July 22, 1959) was an American businessman and politician from the U.S. state of Oregon. He served in World War I before going into business, where he was most successful as a car dealership owner in Salem. A Republican, he served as a city councilor and mayor of Salem before election to the Oregon State Senate. McKay served four terms in the state senate, also served stateside with the rank of major in the U.S. Army during World War II, and was then elected as the twenty-fifth governor of Oregon in 1948. He left that office before the end of his term when he was selected as the thirty-fifth U.S. Secretary of the Interior during the Eisenhower administration. McKay&#x27;s conservative policies were denounced by environmentalists; they forced his resignation in 1956.

==Early life and business career==
McKay was born in Portland, Oregon, to farmer Edwin D. McKay and his wife Minnie A. Musgrove. His family&#x27;s limited means required him to work while still a schoolboy. After his father&#x27;s death in 1911, McKay was forced to leave school before receiving a high school diploma.

He was admitted to Oregon State College in Corvallis as an agriculture student at the age of twenty. McKay was elected student body president in 1916. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree and married Mabel Christine Hill on March 31, 1917. They had one son and two daughters: Douglas, Shirley and Marylou McKay. In November of 1939, his son, Douglas Jr., died in an automobile accident. 

During World War I, he served with the United States Army in Europe, where he advanced to the rank of first lieutenant. He sustained an injury in battle to his leg, right arm, and shoulder, which earned him a Purple Heart. Upon discharge, the disability prevented him from performing the strenuous activities involved with farming, so he began a business career in Portland selling insurance, and then automobiles, rising to the position of sales manager. After the move to the sales manager position, the company sent him to Salem, where he was in charge of their dealership in that city.

He opened Douglas McKay Chevrolet Co. in 1927, and later started a Cadillac dealership as well. McKay later served as president of the Oregon Automobile Dealer&#x27;s Association.

==Early political career==
McKay won election to several local political offices as a Republican, becoming mayor of Salem in 1932, and guided that city through fiscal troubles in the wake of the Great Depression. Steering his city into recovery, according to a contemporary journalist quoted by biographer Herbert S. Parmet, made McKay &quot;a firm advocate of government as well as business preserving and guarding its financial foundation.&quot;

McKay was elected to the Oregon State Senate in 1934, serving four terms interrupted by service as a major in the Army during World War II. In 1940, he was an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention, which nominated the Willkie-McNary ticket.

==Governor of Oregon==
He was elected governor in 1948 on a platform of fiscal conservatism and economic development. As Governor, McKay took a balanced approach to state government. He was a strong advocate for resource conservation; however, he also supported cutting of old growth timber to create jobs for Oregonians. McKay actively opposed the Federal Government&#x27;s plan to create a Columbia Valley Authority. He supported legislation to turn over 95 percent of the profits from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission to the state&#x27;s general fund with the remaining profits going to Oregon cities based on population. He advocated expanding Oregon&#x27;s highway system, supporting a successful bond issue that raised $75 million for the Oregon State Highway Department. McKay won reelection as governor in 1950.

Tom McCall, who would later become governor, served as McKay&#x27;s executive secretary and press officer between 1949 and 1951.

==Secretary of the Interior==
Secretary McKay and Dwight D. Eisenhower had significant ideological differences, the General being identified with the Republican moderates, and McKay with the conservative wing. Fearing that conservative Senator Robert A. Taft had little or no chance of winning the presidency in 1952, and admiring Eisenhower for his military record and leadership qualities, McKay supported Eisenhower&#x27;s candidacy early in the campaign. Upon his election, Eisenhower appointed McKay as Secretary of the Interior. McKay resigned as Oregon governor on December 27, 1952.

As the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, McKay hoped to balance his concern for natural resources with fiscal and business acumen. Secretary McKay abolished five divisions within the Interior Department, cutting four thousand positions and reducing the budget by nearly $200 million. He fostered partnerships involving the states, local public groups, private enterprise, and the Federal Government in building facilities and developing natural resources. However McKay worked to prevent the Columbia Valley Authority and protection of the Hell&#x27;s Canyon project. McKay created nine new wildlife reserves and he opposed the transfer of Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge property to the Army. However, he also advocated building a dam at Echo Park which would have flooded Dinosaur National Monument. In Oregon, he allowed a mining company to harvest timber; for that, his critics dubbed him, &quot;Giveaway McKay.&quot; He also supported Indian termination policy in 1954. Liberals and environmentalists strongly denounced him and he resigned in disgust in 1956.

In 1954, McKay was featured on the cover of the edition of August 23 of &quot;Time&quot;.

==Later years and legacy==
At the urging of Eisenhower, McKay resigned March 9, 1956, effective April 15, 1956, to challenge incumbent Wayne Morse for his seat in the United States Senate. He lost a fierce campaign, in no small measure because of the opposition he had engendered among Oregon conservation groups. Eisenhower replaced the more conservative McKay at Interior with a Moderate Republican, Fred Andrew Seaton, a former short-term senator from Nebraska.

He died of a heart attack in Salem, Oregon, at the age of 66, and was interred at Belcrest Memorial Park in Salem.

Salem&#x27;s Douglas McKay High School, built in 1979, bears his name.

<doc id="1255470" wikidata="Q5046972" url="?curid=1255470" title="Carson of Venus">
<text>Carson of Venus is a science fantasy novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, the third book in the Venus series (Sometimes called the &quot;Carson Napier of Venus series&quot;). Burroughs wrote the novel in July and August 1937. It was serialized in 1938 in six weekly installments from January 8 to February 12 in &quot;Argosy&quot;, the same publication where the previous two Venus novels appeared. It was published in book form a year later from Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. Burroughs originally submitted the novel to a number of the &quot;slick&quot; magazines: &quot;Liberty&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. All rejected the story.

The novel, which was written two years before the outbreak of World War II, satirizes Nazi Germany by including a fascist political faction called the &quot;Zani&quot;. There is also a character named &quot;Muso&quot; as a reference to Benito Mussolini. Unlike the first two Venus novels, &quot;Carson of Venus&quot; focuses on spy intrigue and war instead of wilderness adventuring. It also indicates a change of political orientation from that of the earlier books, where the villains were modeled on Russian Communists.

&quot;Carson of Venus&quot; was nominated for a Retro-Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of 1939. The award went to T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;.

<text>Earl Wilcox Snell (July 11, 1895 – October 28, 1947) was an American politician, businessman, and member of the Republican Party, serving in the Oregon House of Representatives, as the Oregon Secretary of State, and as the 23rd Governor of Oregon. American journalist John Gunther described Snell as &quot;genial, mediocre, and perpetually on the fence.&quot;

==Early life and business career==

Snell was born on a farm near the small town of Olex, Oregon. He grew up in Arlington. He received a public school education, and attended the Oregon Institute of Technology without attaining a degree (this Oregon Institute of Technology was located in Portland, a private institution, and not connected to the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls). He became a partner in Arlington&#x27;s automobile dealership. After military service during World War I, he settled in nearby Condon, where he married Edith Welshons, with whom he had one son, and published the local newspaper. He became sole owner of the auto dealership in Arlington, and it was his principal livelihood for the rest of his life. He later expanded his business interests to include ranching and banking.

In a WUGA TV interview with well known musician Doc Severinsen, Severinsen—who is from Arlington—reported that he used to live with Snell and his wife during the summers as a boy. Doc stated Snell gave him his first instrument (an army bugle) and strongly influenced him. Snell would also sometimes take Doc down to the Capital building when he was governor.

==Political career==

After serving on the Arlington City Council, in 1926 he was elected to the first of four consecutive terms in the Oregon House of Representatives, his final term as Speaker. In 1934, despite inroads by Democrats in Oregon in previously Republican Oregon, Snell was elected Oregon Secretary of State, serving from 1935 to 1943.

Prevented by a term limit from seeking another term as Secretary of State, Snell decided to challenge his own party&#x27;s incumbent Gov. Charles A. Sprague in the Republican primary. He received strong support from the state automobile dealers association, gained the nomination, and went on to be elected Governor with 78 percent of the vote, taking office on January 11, 1943.

Snell&#x27;s administration was marked by conservationist measures, public works projects and relief programs in line with the federal New Deal programs, and initiatives designed to promote agricultural, timber and industrial interests to expand Oregon&#x27;s economy. He was re-elected in 1946, by a margin of more than two to one, but died in office the next year.

Snell was a staunch supporter of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. In 1944, he sponsored a law aimed at Issei and Nisei returnees, which would have denied Japanese-born non-citizens the right to own or lease land. It also would&#x27;ve prosecuted landowning Japanese-American citizens for allowing others of Japanese descent, including their parents, to occupy or work the land. The law easily passed through the Oregon legislature, but was ruled unconstitutional by the courts.

==Death==
On October 28, 1947, Snell, Oregon Secretary of State Robert S. Farrell, Jr., and State Senate President Marshall E. Cornett were killed along with pilot Cliff Hogue when their small plane crashed in stormy weather southwest of Dog Lake in Lake County, Oregon. The group left Klamath Falls about 10:00 p.m. en route to a ranch owned by Oscar Kittredge in Warner Valley near Lakeview, Oregon. A state funeral was held for Snell, Farrell and Cornett at the Capitol in Salem. Snell was buried in Salem&#x27;s Belcrest Memorial Park.

<doc id="1255482" wikidata="Q158981" url="?curid=1255482" title="Sapotaceae">
<text>The Sapotaceae are a family of flowering plants belonging to the order Ericales. The family includes about 800 species of evergreen trees and shrubs in around 65 genera (35–75, depending on generic definition). Their distribution is pantropical.

Many species produce edible fruits, or white blood-sap that is used to cleanse dirt, organically and manually, while others have other economic uses. Species noted for their edible fruits include &quot;Manilkara&quot; (sapodilla), &quot;Chrysophyllum cainito&quot; (star-apple or golden leaf tree), &quot;Gambeya africana&quot; and &quot;Gambeya albida&quot; (star-apple), and &quot;Pouteria&quot; (&quot;abiu, canistel, lúcuma&quot;, mamey sapote). &quot;Vitellaria paradoxa&quot; (&quot;shi&quot; in several languages of West Africa and &quot;karité&quot; in French; also anglicized as shea) is also the source of an oil-rich nut, the source of edible shea butter, which is the major lipid source for many African ethnic groups and is also used in traditional and Western cosmetics and medications. The &quot;miracle fruit&quot; &quot;Synsepalum dulcificum&quot; is also placed in the Sapotaceae.

Trees of the genus &quot;Palaquium&quot; (gutta-percha) produce an important latex with a wide variety of uses. The seeds of the tree &quot;Sideroxylon spinosum&quot; produce an edible oil, traditionally harvested in Morocco.

The family name is derived from &quot;zapote&quot;, a Mexican vernacular name for one of the plants (in turn derived from the Nahuatl &quot;tzapotl&quot;) and Latinised by Linnaeus as &quot;sapota&quot;, a name now treated as a synonym of &quot;Manilkara&quot; (also formerly known by the invalid name &quot;Achras&quot;).

<text>DNB ASA (formerly DnB NOR ASA) is Norway&#x27;s largest financial services group, with total combined assets of more than NOK 1.9 trillion and a market capitalisation NOK 164 billion as of 20 May 2016. DNB&#x27;s head office is located in Oslo.

The two largest owners of DNB are the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries (34.0%) and Sparebankstiftelsen DNB (10.0%). The latter was created as a foundation with the sole purpose of owning a part of the company. It was created when Gjensidige NOR was made a public limited company to ensure that the company&#x27;s customers retained partial ownership of the company. The foundation can also give up to 25% of its received dividend as gifts to charity.

==Operations==
The DNB Bank Group is the largest entity in the DNB Group and Norway&#x27;s largest bank, offering services to the corporate, retail, and securities markets and the public sector. Domestically, the group has an investment bank, DNB Markets, the finance company Cresco, the real estate agency DNB Eiendom and DNB Asset Management, which operates as a fund manager for institutional clients in Norway and Sweden. DNB has the largest customer base in the Norwegian financial market. In Norway, DNB has more than 2.3 million retail customers and more than 200,000 corporate clients, with 61 branch offices.

The group&#x27;s activities are primarily focused on Norway; however, it is one of the world&#x27;s foremost shipping banks and a major international player in the energy sector. It has an international network of 27 branches and representative offices, including Helsinki (Finland), Copenhagen (Denmark), Hamburg (Germany), Luxembourg, London (United Kingdom), New York (United States), Houston (United States), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Santiago (Chile), Shanghai (China) and Singapore. The company also has multiple offices in Sweden.

In Denmark, Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania DNB used to market itself as DnB NORD in what was initially a joint venture with the German bank Norddeutsche Landesbank with DNB owning a full stake since December 23, 2010. On November 11, 2011, the bank was rebranded and adopted the common DNB brand throughout these countries. In these countries, DNB has 930,000 customers and 163 branch offices.

==History==
The history of the group goes back to 1822, with the establishment of Christiania Sparebank. The present corporation consists of mergers between Christiania Sparebank (1822), Gjensidige (1847), Bergens Privatbank (1855), Den norske Creditbank (1857), Fellesbanken (1920), Bergens Kreditbank (1928), Postbanken, Vital and Nordlandsbanken. The name DnB NOR was adopted in 2003, when the two banks Den norske Bank (DnB) and Gjensidige NOR were merged. The company changed its legal name and brand to DNB in November 2011.

In August 2017, DNB and Nordea combined their operations in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to create Luminor Bank.

<doc id="1255486" wikidata="Q2184164" url="?curid=1255486" title="Phantom 2040">
<text>Phantom 2040 is an animated series that is loosely based on the comic strip superhero &quot;The Phantom&quot;, created by Lee Falk. The central character of the series is said to be the 24th Phantom. It was aired from September 18, 1994 to March 3, 1996 in syndication.

==Story==

It is the year 2040, all environmental disasters and the economic Resource Wars from the early 21st century have decimated the fragile ecosystem balance of an Earth once teeming with life. Everywhere, the privileged and wealthy continue to thrive in expensive real estate developments that tower above the suffering masses. The victims of Earth&#x27;s misfortune have been forced to subsist on scavenged refuse from the past on the mangled streets of forlorn city-states.

In Metropia (once known as New York City), the largest and most powerful of the city-states, the powerful robotics manufacturing corporation Maximum Inc. has slowly shaped a cold, steely urban center, consisting of huge, residential towers intertwined with TubeTrain tunnels. Maximum&#x27;s robotic &quot;biots&quot; (Biological Optical Transputer System) have replaced enormous amounts of human labor, and the corporation is illegally producing prohibited combat biots to form Maximum&#x27;s private underground army. Under this guise of efficient progress, Maximum has its own plans for the future, which it refers to as the Maximum Era. Through the construction of the fortress of Cyberville, an immense survival shelter where only the wealthiest and most elite humans will retreat, and the take over of Metropia by means of its biot armies, its plans ultimately involve the dark path of decline and extinction as the culminating result of man&#x27;s prior errors and efforts, once Earth finally succumbs to its slowly deteriorating state.

The only hope for the survival of humanity is the Ghost Jungle — thousands of square miles of mutated vegetation that may be the planet&#x27;s salvation. This secret source of life is submerged beneath Metropia, unseen by most. College student Kit Walker Jr. is chosen by fate to save the world, donning the black mask and purple suit of his people&#x27;s savior, the 24th Phantom.

The role of the Phantom has been passed on from father to son since the 16th century, leading the world to believe that the Phantom is a single immortal individual. Kit, the 24th in the line, is young, unsure, and inexperienced, but he finds within him the courage and might to battle the evil that threatens to destroy the Earth.

==Cast and characters==
&quot;Phantom 2040&quot;&#x27;s voice cast included Scott Valentine, Margot Kidder, Ron Perlman, Leah Remini, J.D. Hall, Alan Oppenheimer, Richard Lynch and Jeff Bennett - while Mark Hamill, Debbie Harry, Rob Paulsen and Paul Williams had recurring roles.

*Kit Walker, Jr. – The 24th Phantom, Kit was not trained for the role like his ancestors were. His father died under mysterious circumstances when he was only a baby, and he grew up not knowing about his heritage. When Guran tells him about the Phantom on his eighteenth birthday, he is initially disbelieving but takes on the role with increasing conviction. His equipment includes optical camouflage for invisibility, a wristband that contains a powerful computer (&quot;analytical&quot;), and another that contains a smart inductance rope. He has several vehicles, including a nimble airborne Hypercycle, a cloaking multi-passenger cruiser, and an upgraded 1999 Mustang named &quot;Hero&quot;, after the 21st Phantom&#x27;s horse. After defeating Maximum Inc, he looks towards a long vacation, until the day the Phantom is needed again. Voiced by Scott Valentine.
* Guran – Kit&#x27;s mentor, whose family have been aiding the Phantom for generations. Together with Jack Archer, Guran instructs the Phantom in combat, morality, and life itself, and is frequently seen reciting insightful &quot;old jungle sayings&quot; to Kit and others. After the 23rd Phantom&#x27;s death, Guran blamed himself, and consumed in his sadness and self-hatred he became the legendary Shadow Panther until he was freed from his mourning forever by Kit Walker Jr. Voiced by J. D. Hall.
*Jack Archer – A scientist and professor in biology at Kit&#x27;s university. After Kit dons the identity of the Phantom, Archer takes only a short time to deduce that they are the same and becomes one of the few who know the Phantom&#x27;s true identity. Together with Guran, Archer takes on the role of Kit&#x27;s mentor, particularly in scientific and contemporary parts of his education. Later on, (due to his wishes to work for the greater good like Kit), opens a small Detective agency like his family before him. Voiced by Alan Oppenheimer.
* &quot;Sparks&quot; (Daniel Aguilar) – A young, orphaned cyber-surfer who is rescued by Kit after Maximum mistakes Sparks as the Phantom. Sparks is unofficially adopted into the Phantom&#x27;s lair, and assists in the technological parts of their endeavors. When he was three, his parents, Esteban and María, were kidnapped by Maximum and cruelly used as the mental tissue for the biomechanical &quot;living building&quot; Project Gauntlet, Cyberville&#x27;s security system. Voiced by Pamela Adlon.
* Sagan Cruz – A Metropian policewoman or &quot;Enforcer&quot;, who is attracted to Kit but was initially unaware of his dual identity, and was skeptical about the Phantom&#x27;s motives. She later figures out his secret and eventually becomes Kit&#x27;s love interest and partner. She has a genetically engineered police dog named D.V.L. (a reference to the 21st Phantom&#x27;s wolf, Devil) and in combat dons a well-armored Enforcer suit. Voiced by Leah Remini.
* Heloise Walker – Kit&#x27;s only living relative, Heloise is the daughter of the 21st Phantom, the sister of the 22nd Phantom, the aunt of the 23rd Phantom, and the great-aunt of Kit Walker, Jr. – The 24th Phantom. She kept the truth from Kit, hoping he could lead a normal life, but accepts Kit&#x27;s choice to become the 24th Phantom and assists him in his plans to stop Maximum Inc. Voiced by Carrie Snodgress.
* Rebecca Madison – The series villain, chairperson of Maximum Inc. and widow of Maxwell Madison Sr., the 23rd Phantom&#x27;s killer. Rebecca plans to construct Cyberville, an impenetrable technological fortress where the select wealthy and elite may seek refuge when the Earth begins to deteriorate (something Rebecca&#x27;s underground biot army will ensure takes place relatively soon), but her plans of domination are frequently being foiled by the Phantom. Despite her evil ways, she does have some redeeming qualities, such as wishing to know that her son is safe before evacuating from an attack, as well as Kit suggesting she is a very lonely woman. Other than Graft and her son, Maxwell Madison Jr., no other humans are employed by Maximum, which has its own biots perform all labor. In the end, with all of her crimes revealed to the world, she is quickly arrested and sent to prison. Voiced by Margot Kidder.
* Maxwell Madison Jr. – Rebecca&#x27;s psychopathic son, whose intelligence is belied by his laziness and outward disinterest in almost everything. When he does have an opinion on something, he presents it as coming from his cat, Charles Baudelaire. He is psychologically disturbed with the disorders being rooted in the loss of his father at such an early age. His cat, perhaps the last remaining symbol of his father&#x27;s love for him, is his only and most trusted friend. In the end, after Rebecca is arrested both he and his cat, are sent to a mental asylum, or as Cruz put it, a &quot;padded prison&quot;. Voiced by Jeff Bennett.
* Hubert Graft – Rebecca Madison&#x27;s Chief of Security and main enforcer, a cyborg. He was formerly an environmentalist who turned and fought against Maximum to protect the Amazon rainforest, before losing his whole body below the shoulders in combat. Maximum rebuilt Graft&#x27;s body using biot parts, giving Rebecca Madison complete control over Graft&#x27;s life. Graft&#x27;s biot torso can be disconnected (a painful process) at the hip and integrated into other robotic systems over which Graft has complete control, most commonly the Urban Combat Biot Walker, a ten-foot steel exoskeleton armed with lasers and claws. Despite this, he still has a desire to protect nature and will work with the Phantom if a bigger threat hits it. Several times the Phantom asks if he would want to escape Maximum&#x27;s clutches, but he always turns this offer down. He also is against harming children, even if that child trespassed and destroyed invaluable company technology. In the end, after Maximum Inc is defeated, he is mentioned to have been sent to a halfway house. Voiced by Ron Perlman in the first season, and Richard Lynch in the second.
* Doctor Jak – A cynical sensationalist TV yellow journalist who reports the Phantom&#x27;s activities with a negative spin. His arrogance and vanity bring him to believe that rather than being merely a reporter of news, he &quot;is the news&quot;, and therefore anything he does not see (such as purposely covering his eye when it is revealed the Phantom was being framed) is not the news. In &quot;Matter Over Mind&quot;, it is discovered that after Jak&#x27;s wife perished in the Grand Central Station crash, he attempted an illegal operation to integrate an analytical computer into his mind, but the operation was interrupted and the analytical program thought lost. Dr. Jak was left part-biot, with sensory implants on his head and a multi-purpose eyepiece which he uses to film his news program, The Dr. Jak Show. His character and how he criminalizes the Phantom are comparable to J. Jonah Jameson of &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. Voiced by Mark Hamill.
* Mr. Cairo – A mysterious information broker who only appears in holographic transmissions and who deals with both the Phantom and Maximum Inc. Early on, he discovers the Phantom&#x27;s true identity but chooses to withhold the information from Rebecca Madison despite the enormous reward being offered. He is later revealed to actually be the sentient analytical program separated from Dr. Jak&#x27;s consciousness, but he decides not to rejoin Dr. Jak&#x27;s mind and instead stays on to loyally assist the Phantom, though meets his end when Max Jr. shuts down the power with him still in it, deleting him. Voiced by Paul Williams.
* Sean One – The first human born in outer space and founder and leader of the Free Orbital Movement, Sean One seeks independence for his Orbital colonies. An arrogant and abnormally tall man, he resorts to espionage and terrorist attacks to achieve his ends and is unable to walk by himself while in the presence of gravity. He is revered among the Orbitals&#x27; inhabitants in an almost god-like way and is extremely apathetic towards whom he calls the &quot;gravity-slaves&quot; of Earth. He is defeated when he publicly announced his plan to rig the votes to make the Orbital Colonies independent, as well as attempting to kill Vaingloria. Voiced by Rob Paulsen.
* Gorda – A morbidly obese crime lord and smuggler from Australia who is unable to move by herself and has an army of strong, red-tinted biots under her command. She refers to herself in virtual camera system and has a well-armed robotic kangaroo as her sole companion. In the end, she is arrested and transported back to Australia to await trial. Voiced by Paddi Edwards.
* Heisenberg – A shape-shifting fractal biot built by Max Madison Jr. using nanites grown in space by Sean One, named by Maxwell after the German physicist Werner Heisenberg. Heisenberg is the first stable fractal biot created by Maximum and is controlled by Maxwell using a separate remote brain which must be carried around in a case. Heisenberg is forced to impersonate the Phantom and succeeds in criminalizing him with the help of Dr. Jak, but after a confrontation with the Phantom, Maxwell loses the remote brain and hence control of Heisenberg. Afterward, the fractal biot gains independence and a form of sentience, dons a wide-brimmed hat and trench coat, and seeks answers for his past, remembering nothing of his creation other than his name. He meets a wise street saxophonist named Betty, and after deciding to take his own path, becomes a &quot;teacher&quot; to biots everywhere, helping them to be free from their human owners and become self-aware. Heisenberg eventually joins the Phantom and becomes a close companion to Pavlova, Dr. Jak&#x27;s assistant. Voiced by Rob Paulsen.
* Pavlova - Dr. Jak&#x27;s personal biot assistant, distinguishable by red symbols on her face. Pavlova sometimes questions the honesty and morality of Jak&#x27;s news uploads, but always has her memory wiped by Jak afterward (a task he does somewhat reluctantly). Nicknamed &quot;Pav&quot; by Jak, the reporter treats her as his friend and sometimes even in a joking, romantic way, because Pavlova was named after Jak&#x27;s late wife. Pavlova also befriends Heisenberg, who takes an interest in her. She ultimately tells Jak &quot;I will program myself from now on&quot;, at which later Jak laments, &quot;You just had to be your own person, just like her&quot;, referring to Pav&#x27;s namesake. Voiced by Liz Georges.
* Vaingloria – A popular starlet singer trained by Maximum Inc. to brainwash the public. It is known that Rebecca Madison found her as a street urchin and offered her food, shelter, and fame in exchange for her services for Maximum. Rebecca had her fitted with retractable mirrors which can focus light to such a strength that looking at the mirrors can overload the mind&#x27;s senses, effectively hypnotizing the public into adoring her and on Maximum&#x27;s orders using them to completely brainwash certain people (it can be assumed that the mirrors are difficult to control with precision, as Vaingloria once accidentally sent a victim into a coma). Vaingloria reluctantly takes part in several of Maximum&#x27;s plots and becomes particularly close to Graft, who (somewhat) reciprocates. He ultimately hardwires her mirrors she can use them on her own. Voiced by Deborah Harry.
* Betty – A wise street saxophonist who becomes Heisenberg&#x27;s best friend and companion. She is seen to be aware of everything around her and frequently relating life to the blues. She carries a saxophone that was the property of former U.S. president Bill Clinton. Voiced by Iona Morris.
* Maxwell Madison Sr. – Rebecca&#x27;s deceased husband, who was killed along with the 23rd Phantom in a toxic train wreck. Rebecca captures his brainwaves and stores them in an enormous computer, and is constantly seeking a stable way to transfer them into a biot or preferably a living body to effectively resurrect Maxwell Madison Sr. He was regarded as a very dangerous and power-hungry man when he was alive and in control of Maximum, Inc, but it is discovered that his plans for the world were very ecologically beneficial and that his ambitious wife Rebecca sabotaged his plans in favor of greedy, selfish world domination. Voiced by Jeff Bennett.

==Development==
The show was developed for television by executive producer David J. Corbett and executive story editors Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. In addition to story-editing both seasons, the Reeves-Stevens devised the show&#x27;s writers&#x27; bible, and scripted numerous episodes, including the two-part pilot (&quot;Generation Unto Generation&quot;). Other key writers on the show included Brynne Chandler and Michael Reaves.

The unusual character designs were the distinctive work of Peter Chung, creator of &quot;Æon Flux&quot;.

The art director/conceptual designer on the show was Thom Schillinger, who created all of the background designs and technical concept designs to complement Peter Chung&#x27;s distinctively elongated character design.

The show debuted in 1994 to rave reviews, though it survived only 35 episodes before it was relegated to weekend repeats in 1996. Along with action sequences, stories focused on intelligent plotting and character development, winning the series praise for its subtle teaching of such values as individuality, freedom and the volatility of humanity.

Along with Andrea Romano&#x27;s equally pioneering work on &quot;&quot;, Stu Rosen&#x27;s voice direction on &quot;Phantom 2040&quot; had a lasting impact on animated adventure television. Romano and Rosen cast accomplished dramatic actors and introduced a new level of maturity and complexity to their show&#x27;s vocal performances that set the standard for all TV animation that followed.

==In other media==
===Video game===

A &quot;Phantom 2040&quot; video game was produced for Sega Genesis, Game Gear and Super NES, and like the animated series, it received very positive reviews despite its obscurity. It is possible to play as both the Phantom and, in the Game Gear version, his alter-ego, Kit Walker. The game has over 20 different endings, depending on the choices the player makes while progressing through the story, and revolves around Rebecca Madison&#x27;s attempts to create a biot army, revive her dead husband and seize control of both Metropia and the world.

===Comic books===
&quot;Phantom 2040&quot; was adapted into a comic book series by Marvel Comics in 1995 (cover dated May–August 1995). Only four issues were published, released as a mini-series. The stories were only loosely based on the TV series, and was notably different in tone from the dark, complex animated show. The comic book was written by Peter Quinones, pencilled by &quot;Spider-Man&quot; co-creator Steve Ditko and inked by Bill Reinhold. Each issue featured a free poster drawn by such artists as John Romita Sr.

==Home media and streaming==
===VHS===

<text>Stretch Armstrong is a large, gel-filled action figure that was first sold in 1976 by Kenner. 

It looks like a short muscular man with blond hair wearing black trunks, but can be stretched from its normal size of about to .

The doll is made of latex rubber filled with a proprietary gelled substance similar to corn syrup, which allows it to retain shape for a short time before shrinking to its original shape.

Tears can be fixed with an adhesive bandage, according to an instruction booklet included with the box.

In 2016, at the New York Toy Fair, Hasbro announced the return of the Stretch Armstrong toy in its original 1976 design.

In 2015, Hasbro gave the license for Stretch Armstrong to Character Options, which began releasing new products in 2016. In 2023, Character Options announced plans to expand the brand until 2024. The plans included launching the original toy under the name &quot;The Original Stretch Armstrong&quot; and creating a &quot;Stretch&quot; brand to create crossover products with brands such as Star Wars and Transformers. 

==History==
The Stretch Armstrong toy concept was created by Jesse D. Horowitz, the industrial designer for Kenner&#x27;s R&amp;D group. The idea was approved for development by the head of R&amp;D, Jeep (James) Kuhn, vice president of Kenner.

The &quot;stretch man&quot; idea as it was called was pursued with two different bodies in mind. One was a sumo wrestler and the other was an All-American blond hunk. Horowitz sculpted the models himself instead of hiring a freelancer. The sumo man was too bulky and large, so the All-American body was cast by Kenner&#x27;s model maker Richard Dobek, and the resultant resin model was taken to a latex doll manufacturer in New Jersey, where the first bodies were dipped.

Originally, springs were thought of as the way to stretch the man. However, they were thought to be too awkward and stiff, too difficult to insert and would likely pierce the skin. Kuhn, a chemical engineer, pursued a liquid sugar idea which eventually proved successful. Tremendous quantities of Karo corn syrup were purchased from an A&amp;P supermarket. The syrup was boiled down to get the proper viscosity. Kuhn and Horowitz flew to Kenner&#x27;s headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, and presented the concept to Bernie Loomis, Kenner&#x27;s president. He loved it and a toy icon was born.

The original Stretch Armstrong figure was conceived and developed by Bill Armasmith, and was in production from 1976 until 1980. Denys Fisher manufactured and released the figure in Europe, under license from Kenner. The original 1970s toy commands high prices on the secondary collectors&#x27; market, selling for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of US dollars. Through storage and play, the figure could become damaged and rendered useless. There are still original Stretch Armstrongs that have survived the passing of time and are remarkably preserved through sheer luck or being stored at the correct temperature. The figure keeps best at room temperature.

Stretch Armstrong is made of latex rubber filled with gelled corn syrup, which allows it to retain shape for a short time before shrinking to its original shape.

===Similar releases===

An estimated 67 different versions from Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Australia, and other countries released Stretch Armstrong variations between 1976 and the 1990s.

* Stretch X-Ray (1977), had an oversized exposed brain and an alien-looking face with a transparent form that showed its internal organs which were lungs, an intestinal system and what appears to be a heart. This version was re-released.
* Harbert Sport Mister Muscolo, 1977 Italian version of Stretch Armstrong
* Lili Ledy El Hombre Elastico, Mexican version of Stretch Armstrong
* Tsukuda Mr. X, Japanese version of Stretch Armstrong
* Stretch Monster, a reptilian green nemesis released by Kenner in 1978
* Harbert Sport Mister Mostro, Italian version of Stretch Monster
* Tsukuda Stretch Monster, Japanese version
* Stretch Ollie and Stretch Olivia, male and female octopuses (colored blue and pink, respectively) which had the same face shape but the only difference was their color. Kenner issued both weeks apart but Ollie was more popular. The Denys Fisher UK toy company issued Ollie and Olivia in smaller boxes than their American counterparts, saving on shelf space. The figures are rare to come by now.
* Denys Fisher Stretch Incredible Hulk (1979) This figure used the original Stretch Armstrong molds and graphics without permission, and was discontinued due to a lawsuit from Kenner in 1980.
* Mego Elastic Donald Duck (1980)
* Mego Elastic Mickey Mouse (1980)
* Mego Elastic Batman
* Mego Elastic Incredible Hulk (1979)
* Mego Elastic Plastic Man (1979)
* Kenner Stretch Serpent
* Cap Toys Fetch Armstrong, Stretch Armstrong&#x27;s pliable canine counterpart, released in the early 1990s
* Kenner/Hasbro Super Stretch Mask
* Cap Toys Stretch Vac-Man
* ToyQuest Super Morphman
* Super Impulse Gumby and Pokey Stretch

The last two were filled with a granular solid in place of the viscous liquid found in the other figures. A vacuum pump, which attached to the heads of these figures, removed the air from within, which &quot;froze&quot; the toy in its stretched position.

Stretch Armstrong was reissued in the 1990s by Cap Toys, with a canine sidekick, &quot;Fetch Armstrong&quot;. The reissue stretch Armstrong had a more comical exaggerated face (a huge genial smile) and had on a vanity T-shirt and shorts. This new reissue figure was introduced in 1993 and 1994 version exist with slightly different art work. He also has an evil brother named Evil X-ray Wretch Armstrong who has a skull face, sports a mohawk, and also stretches. Wretch Armstrong seems to be a redesigned, smaller remake of Stretch X-Ray but in reality looks nothing like the 1970s version. Evil X-ray Wretch Armstrong is only 7 inches tall whereas Stretch X-ray was over 12 inches tall.

==Adaptations==
===Cancelled film===
In 1994, Walt Disney Studios obtained the film rights to the character, with Caravan Pictures producing. Several scripts were written, including an early version family comedy written by Greg Erb, a co-writer at Disney. The script which cast Tim Allen in the role of Stretch Armstrong as a &quot;kind of single dad who is a research scientist&quot; and is &quot;stretched too thin&quot; trying to balance his work and family life before he inadvertently accidentally takes one of his experimental serums giving himself &quot;stretchy powers&quot;. A later version from screenwriter Michael Kalesniko was created and it was set in San Francisco. It was about a somewhat socially awkward nobody beset with troubles trying to venture out his failing personal life and is genetically modified with stretching abilities after a failed nuclear fusion experiment and must use his newfound abilities to solve the tragedy that has befallen his family. Among the actors who were considered for the role was Danny DeVito, who refused to do the film if the script made any jokes about his height. Several other writers, such as Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, provided rewrites, and Peter Care was attached to direct, but due to lack of time on the rights, both ideas from Disney were scrapped and the rights were bought up by Hasbro.

In 2008, Universal Studios signed a deal with Hasbro to create another film based on Stretch Armstrong from a screenplay written by Nicholas Stoller.

It was announced from the studios co-chairman Donna Langley that Taylor Lautner would star as Armstrong and that the film would be in 3-D. She stated that &quot;with Lautner&#x27;s success energy and athleticism he is a perfect fit to a unlikely hero.&quot; Producer Brian Grazer stated &quot;Stretch Armstrong is a character I have wanted to see on screen for a long time ... It’s a story about a guy stretching ... the limits of what is possible to become all that he can be.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;/Film&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Another script was being made by writer Steve Oedekerk introducing the character in the form of an uptight spy who stumbles across a stretching formula, which he takes and now must adjust to his newfound abilities when fighting crime and in his everyday life.

Two years later, after the excitement drummed up by the Studios ideas for the character, Relativity Media announced that they had picked up the film after it was dropped by Universal and set a new release date of April 11, 2014. Planning to make the film more serious than originally intended by Universal, Relativity hired &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; writer Dean Georgaris to write a new script, dropped Lautner, and hired Breck Eisner to direct.
The film origin story was going to introduce an overwhelmed high schooler and the life-or-death consequences he was going to face after undergoing a transformation granting him superhuman abilities. Production was scheduled to start filming on May 15, 2013, in Montreal but by October 2013, both the studio and Hasbro had abandoned the film to work on other projects.

===Television===

After four attempted films for Stretch Armstrong, Hasbro Studios made a deal with the video streaming service website Netflix where the property was picked up for a full 26-episode animated series, making it the first deal between the company and the streaming service. This superhero action/comedy animated series followed a teenager named Jake Armstrong and his two best friends as they go into action after being exposed to an experimental chemical making them &quot;Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters&quot;—a team of stretchable superheroes who must work together and embark on a series of adventures. The series debuted on Netflix on November 17, 2017.

The series was developed by Kevin Burke, Victor Cook, and Chris &quot;Doc&quot; Wyatt. Burke and Wyatt also wrote a tie-in comic book for IDW Publishing. The first 13 episodes of the 26-episode first season were released on Netflix on November 17, 2017.

===Comics===
A similar concept with Stretch as a superhero was also shown in a one-off comic produced by Hasbro in 2011 dubbed &quot;Unit:E&quot;; there, the descendant of Acroyear and a Biotron (both from &quot;Micronauts&quot;) and Synergy (from &quot;Jem&quot;; here an alien artificial intelligence) conducted reconnaissance on heroes from Earth and beyond (including characters from &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;MASK&quot;, &quot;Battleship Galaxies&quot;, &quot;Action Man&quot;, and even &quot;Candy Land&quot;) to help fight against Baron Karza (the enemy of the Micronauts).

In September 2017, IDW Publishing announced a new comic book based on the Netflix series &quot;Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters&quot; for January 2018.

===Video game===
In 2018, a video game called &quot;Stretch Armstrong: The Breakout&quot; was released on Netflix. The game involves Jake Armstrong, Ricardo and Nathan stopping villains from rampaging through Charter City.

<text>Margaret Ruth Kidder (October 17, 1948 – May 13, 2018) was a Canadian–American actress and activist. She amassed several film and television credits in her career spanning five decades, including her best known portrayal of Lois Lane in the original &quot;Superman&quot; films (1978–1987). Her accolades included two Canadian Film Awards, an Emmy Award, a Genie Award and a Saturn Award.

Born in Yellowknife to a Canadian mother and an American father, Kidder was raised in the Northwest Territories as well as several Canadian provinces. She began her acting career in the 1960s, appearing in low-budget Canadian productions and winning the Canadian Film Special Award in 1969. She first received attention for appearing in the comedy film &quot;Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx&quot; (1970), the horror films &quot;Sisters&quot; (1972), &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Reincarnation of Peter Proud&quot; (1975), and the drama films &quot;A Quiet Day in Belfast&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; (1975). 

Kidder&#x27;s international breakthrough came with playing Lois Lane in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and Kathy Lutz in &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (1979), which were blockbuster films. For these roles, she was twice nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress, winning in 1978 for &quot;Superman&quot;. She reprised the role of Lois in three &quot;Superman&quot; sequels (1980–1987), and also played Rita Harris in the comedy film &quot;Heartaches&quot; (1981) and made her stage debut with the play &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (1982). After a stint of films and projects that were ambivalently received, Kidder sustained serious injuries in a car accident that left her temporarily paralyzed in 1990, and suffered from a highly publicized manic episode and nervous breakdown in 1996 stemming from bipolar disorder. 

Kidder thereafter maintained steady work in independent films and television, notably appearing in the hockey film &quot;Chicks with Sticks&quot; (2004) and the horror picture &quot;Halloween II&quot; (2009), and playing a guest role on &quot;R.L. Stine&#x27;s The Haunting Hour&quot; (2015). She maintained dual citizenship and was an outspoken political, environmental and anti-war activist. Kidder died on May 13, 2018, of an alcohol and drug overdose, which was ruled a suicide.

== Early life ==
Margaret Ruth Kidder, one of five children, was born on October 17, 1948, in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, the daughter of Jocelyn Mary &quot;Jill&quot; (née Wilson), a history teacher from British Columbia, and Kendall Kidder, an American explosives expert and engineer originally from New Mexico. She was of Welsh and English descent. 

Kidder was born in Yellowknife because of her father&#x27;s employment, which required the family to live in remote locations. Her father subsequently served as the manager of the Yellowknife Telephone Company from 1948 to 1951. She had one sister, Annie, who is an actress and executive director of the People for Education charity, and three brothers: John, Michael and Peter. Two of her siblings married notable Canadians: Annie married actor Eric Peterson and John married politician Elizabeth May. Kidder&#x27;s niece Janet Kidder is also an actress.

Recalling her childhood in northern Canada, Kidder said: &quot;We didn&#x27;t have movies in this little mining town. When I was 12 my mom took me to New York and I saw &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, with people singing and dancing, and that was it. I knew I had to go far away. I was clueless, but I [have done] okay.&quot; In addition to Yellowknife, she also spent some time growing up in Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador. Kidder became interested in politics from a young age, which she credited to debates her parents would have over the dinner table; her mother had socialist leanings, while her father was a conservative Republican.

Kidder had mental health issues from a young age, which stemmed from undiagnosed bipolar disorder. &quot;I knew I was different, had these mind flights that other people didn&#x27;t seem to have,&quot; she recalled. At age 14, she attempted suicide. Kidder found an outlet in acting as she felt she could &quot;let my real self out... and no one would know it was me.&quot; &quot;Nobody ever encouraged me to be an actress,&quot; she recalled. &quot;It was taken as a joke ... As a teenager, I envisioned myself in every book I read. I wanted to be Henry Miller and Thomas Wolfe. I wanted to eat everything on the world&#x27;s platter, but my eyes were bigger than my stomach.&quot; 

She attended multiple schools during her youth through her family&#x27;s relocations, eventually graduating from Havergal College, a high-school level boarding school in Toronto, in 1966. In 1966, she found herself pregnant by her boyfriend, who arranged for an illegal abortion. The abortionist was located in a hotel room and filled Kidder&#x27;s uterus with Lysol to terminate the pregnancy. After graduating from Havergal, Kidder relocated to Vancouver to attend the University of British Columbia, but dropped out after one year. She returned to Toronto, where she found work as a model.

== Career ==

=== 1960s ===

Kidder&#x27;s television debut was in an episode of &quot;Wojeck&quot; aired January 16, 1968. She made her film debut in a 49-minute film titled &quot;The Best Damn Fiddler from Calabogie to Kaladar&quot; (1968), a drama set in a Canadian logging community, which was produced by the Challenge for Change. Kidder&#x27;s 1969 appearance in the episode &quot;Does Anybody Here Know Denny?&quot; on the Canadian drama series &quot;Corwin&quot; earned her a Canadian Film Award for &quot;outstanding new talent.&quot;

Kidder&#x27;s first major feature was the 1969 American film &quot;Gaily, Gaily&quot;, a period comedy starring Beau Bridges, in which she portrayed a prostitute. She subsequently appeared in a number of TV drama series for the CBC, including guest appearances on &quot;Adventures in Rainbow Country&quot;, and a semi-regular role as a young reporter on &quot;McQueen&quot;, and as a panelist on &quot;Mantrap&quot; which featured discussions centered on a feminist perspective.

=== 1970s ===
During the 1971–72 season, she co-starred as barmaid Ruth in &quot;Nichols&quot;, a James Garner–led Western, which aired 22 episodes on NBC. During an August 3, 1970, interview on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, Kidder stated that she was ambivalent toward having a film career, and was considering working as a film editor in the future. At this time, she had become an acquaintance of director Robert Altman, and served as an apprentice assisting him in editing &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; (1970). She subsequently appeared in &quot;Such Dust As Dreams Are Made On&quot;, the first pilot for &quot;Harry O&quot; which aired in March 1973. She was a guest star in a 1972 episode of the George Peppard detective series &quot;Banacek&quot;.

After moving to Los Angeles, Kidder was cast opposite Gene Wilder in &quot;Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx&quot; (1970) as an exchange student in Ireland who becomes the love interest of a poor horse manure collector in Dublin whom she almost runs over with her car. After filming in Ireland, Kidder relocated to New York City to further study acting. A year later, she returned to California, and was cast in the Brian De Palma film &quot;Sisters&quot; (1972), which gained notoriety for both director and Kidder, who as leading lady, portrayed conjoined twins, one of whom is a suspect in a brutal murder. Kidder had been in a relationship with De Palma at the time, and had been roommates with co-star Jennifer Salt in Los Angeles. &quot;Sisters&quot; went on to achieve critical recognition, being considered among the best American films of the decade by critic Robin Wood, as well as one of the most important films in Kidder&#x27;s career by film critic G. Allen Johnson.

In 1974, she starred in the slasher film &quot;Black Christmas&quot;, for which she won a Canadian Film Award for Best Actress; followed by a role as a prostitute in the Terrence Malick–scripted &quot;The Gravy Train&quot; (1974). She received another Canadian Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in the war drama &quot;A Quiet Day in Belfast&quot; (1974). Also in 1974, Kidder made her directorial debut with a 50-minute short film produced for the American Film Institute, titled &quot;Again&quot;. The film follows a woman who pastes photographs of her former lovers on her wall, continuously searching for &quot;Mr. Right.&quot;
Kidder had a central supporting role in the airplane-themed drama &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; (1975) opposite Robert Redford and Susan Sarandon, followed by a lead role in the psychological horror film &quot;The Reincarnation of Peter Proud&quot;, directed by J. Lee Thompson, in which she portrayed a woman about whom a college professor has recurring nightmares. &quot;Variety&quot; praised her performance in the latter film as &quot;outstandingly rich.&quot; In the summer of 1975, Kidder was hired to direct a documentary short chronicling the making of &quot;The Missouri Breaks&quot; (1976), a Western film starring Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson. &quot;I was such a jerk,&quot; she recalled. &quot;I mean, I thought they wanted a real documentary. So I filmed all the behind-the-scenes rows and arguments and shot footage of the vet shooting up the horses with tranquilizers so the actors would look as if they rode well. What an idiot I was. Then when they fired me, I realized what they&#x27;d wanted was a publicity film.&quot; 

She subsequently co-starred with Peter Fonda in &quot;92 in the Shade&quot;, also in 1975, a drama directed by novelist Thomas McGuane, based on his own book. Kidder then took a hiatus from acting, though she appeared in the March 9, 1975, edition of &quot;The American Sportsman&quot;, learning how to hang glide, and providing the narration, with a remote microphone recording her reactions in flight; the segment concluded with Kidder doing solos soaring amid the Wyoming Rockies. She was also photographed by Douglas Kirkland for the March 1975 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;, accompanied by an article written by Kidder herself. 
In 1977, eager to return to acting, Kidder read for the character of Lois Lane in &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, only one month before principal photography was scheduled to begin. Kidder was flown to England for screen-tests. Upon meeting with director Richard Donner, Kidder tripped while walking into the room. Donner recalled: &quot;I just fell in love with her. It was perfect, this clumsy [behavior].&quot; She was ultimately cast in the role, which would become her most iconic. Filming lasted approximately eighteen months. 

&quot;Superman&quot; was released during Christmas 1978 and was a major commercial success, grossing $300 million worldwide. She was deemed &quot;most charming&quot; by Vincent Canby in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. James Harwood of &quot;Variety&quot; said that she &quot;plays perfectly off both of his Reeve&#x27;s] personalities and her initial double-entendre interview with Superman is wickedly coy, dancing round the obvious question any red-blooded girl might ask herself about such a magnificent prospect.&quot; Sonia Saraiya of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; praised her ability to balance Lois&#x27;s ditzy nature with her ambition and no-nonsense attitude, and wrote: &quot;Kidder played a human woman who could believably both attract and deserve a man who is canonically perfect, with the physique of a Greek god and the moral compass of a saint.&quot; For the role, Kidder won the Saturn Award for Best Actress.

After completing filming for &quot;Superman&quot;, Kidder starred as Kathy Lutz in the supernatural horror film &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (1979), which further cemented her status as one of Hollywood&#x27;s leading ladies. &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; was a major commercial success, grossing over $86 million in the United States, but it received mixed reviews from critics. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, though giving the film a mixed review, said Kidder &quot;stubbornly remains the bright-eyed life of the party [in the film].&quot; In retrospect, Kidder called the film &quot;a piece of shit.&quot; The same year, Kidder hosted an episode of the American sketch comedy TV show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

=== 1980s ===
Kidder reprised her role as Lois Lane in &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980), though she publicly disagreed with the decision of producers Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind to replace Richard Donner as director. &quot;Superman II&quot; was also a box-office hit, grossing $108 million in the United States. Through her appearances in the &quot;Superman&quot; films, Kidder maintained a close friendship with her co-star Christopher Reeve, which lasted from 1978 until his death in 2004: &quot;When you&#x27;re strapped to someone hanging from the ceiling for months and months, you get pretty darned close,&quot; Kidder told CBS. &quot;He was such a huge part of my life... He was complicated, very smart, really smart, and he knew he&#x27;d done something meaningful. He was very aware of that and very happy with that role.&quot; Also in 1980, she appeared in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Willie &amp; Phil&quot;, playing one-third of a love triangle opposite Michael Ontkean and Ray Sharkey.

Kidder starred in the Canadian comedic road movie &quot;Heartaches&quot; (1981), portraying a free-spirited woman who helps an acquaintance raise her child. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted: &quot;Nothing happens in &quot;Heartaches&quot; that isn&#x27;t telegraphed 15 minutes ahead of time, but Miss Kidder and Miss [Annie] Potts are good fun to watch, not because they convince you of the reality of their characters but because they handle their assignments with such unbridled, comic, actressy enthusiasm.&quot; She then starred opposite Richard Pryor in the comedy &quot;Some Kind of Hero&quot; (1982), about a Vietnam War veteran who attempts to re-assimilate into civilian life. While filming the picture, Kidder stated she &quot;fell in love with Pryor in two seconds flat,&quot; and the two carried on a relationship during the production. In 1982, she appeared in a stage performance of &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, playing Cherie opposite Tim Matheson as Bo, which was broadcast on HBO.

It was reported that, as a result of Kidder&#x27;s previous objection to Donner&#x27;s directorial replacement for &quot;Superman II&quot;, her role in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Superman III&quot; was notably small, consisting of 12 lines and less than five minutes of footage, though the producers have denied this in DVD commentaries. The same year &quot;Superman III&quot; was released, Kidder also starred as a court stenographer-cum-private eye named Mickey Raymond in the comedy &quot;Trenchcoat&quot; (1983). Critic Roger Ebert disliked the film, deeming it &quot;one of the most tired, predictable, uninteresting movies in a long time.&quot; Also in 1983, Kidder produced and starred as Eliza Doolittle in a version of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; with Peter O&#x27;Toole for Showtime.

In 1984, Kidder produced and starred in the French-Canadian period television film &quot;Louisiana&quot; as a plantation owner in the American South who returns from Paris to find her estate and holdings have been lost. In 1984, she reunited with her former &quot;Nichols&quot; co-star, James Garner, in the Hollywood crime drama &quot;The Glitter Dome&quot;, and appeared in the drama &quot;Little Treasure&quot; for Columbia Tri-Star, with co-stars Ted Danson and Burt Lancaster, in which she played a distraught stripper looking for her bank robber-father&#x27;s buried fortune.

In 1985, Kidder expressed ambivalence toward continuing her career, and was quoted as saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel comfortable as a performer and I&#x27;m a big turkey as a movie star.&quot; She stated that the quote was reported out of context, but conceded: &quot;I am in a weird frame of mind at the moment. I know acting is not going to be enough for me for the rest of my life. This business is very hard on women at a certain age, and I never want to end up just having to accept what&#x27;s offered me. So I am anxious to direct, to have options.&quot; 

In 1986, she was selected as the English narrator for the Japanese animated series &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. In 1987, Kidder reprised her Lois Lane role in &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987), which she filmed in 1986. &quot;Body of Evidence&quot; (1988), a CBS Movie of the Week, cast Kidder as a nurse who suspects that her medical pathologist husband is a serial killer.

=== 1990s ===
In the fall of 1990, Kidder appeared as a singer who becomes a murder victim in the Canadian television film &quot;White Room&quot; (1990). After her car accident, Kidder returned to the screen with an uncredited cameo appearance in the comedy film &quot;Delirious&quot; (1991), appearing as a woman in a washroom. This was followed by a role as a psychic in &quot;To Catch a Killer&quot; (1992), a Canadian television thriller film based on the crimes of John Wayne Gacy. She had several small roles in 1994, including in the Disney Channel film &quot;Windrunner&quot;, as well as another uncredited appearance in &quot;Maverick&quot;. She played a bartender at the Broken Skull Tavern in &quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot;, a PC FMV adventure game.

Kidder returned to film with a lead role in the independent comedy-drama &quot;Never Met Picasso&quot; (1997), portraying an actress living with her gay adult son (portrayed by Alexis Arquette) who is attempting to sort his life out. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Arquette and Kidder [were] given the chance to come across as quite appealing&quot; in their roles. She next appeared in the slasher film &quot;The Clown at Midnight&quot; (1998), opposite Christopher Plummer, and alongside Lynn Redgrave and James Earl Jones in the romance film &quot;The Annihilation of Fish&quot; (1999), playing the landlady of an interracial couple. Critic Todd McCarthy in &quot;Variety&quot; referred to the film as a &quot;would-be charmer&quot; and &quot;a drear moment in the careers of all concerned.&quot;

=== 2000s and 2010s ===

In 2000, Kidder played Eileen Canboro in &quot;Apocalypse III: Tribulation&quot;, a Christian film dealing with Christian eschatology and the rapture. Kidder stated afterwards that she did not realize until she was on the set that the movie was serious. Also that year she appeared in three episodes of Peter Benchley&#x27;s &quot;Amazon&quot;, playing a striking role as an insane Canadian woman bent on domination of all the local tribes. In 2001, she played the abusive mother of a serial killer in &quot;Pique&quot;, an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. In 2002, she appeared alongside Crispin Glover and Vanessa Redgrave in the film adaptation of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;.

Kidder appeared off-Broadway in &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; in December 2002, and toured with the show for two years. After this, she appeared on &quot;Robson Arms&quot;, a Canadian sitcom set in an apartment block in Vancouver&#x27;s west end. She played a quirky neighbor of the main cast members. She also had a cameo in &quot;Rich Hall&#x27;s Election Special&quot; on BBC Four. In 2006, Kidder played Jenny Schecter&#x27;s mother Sandy Ziskin on &quot;The L Word&quot;; her character was a repressed Jewish woman coming to terms with her daughter&#x27;s sexuality. In 2007, Kidder began appearing on the television series &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;, playing Emily Craft. In 2004, Kidder briefly returned to the Superman franchise in two episodes of the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, as Bridgette Crosby, an emissary of Dr. Swann (played by her &quot;Superman&quot; co-star, Christopher Reeve).

In 2008, she portrayed an embattled guidance counselor in the gay-themed mystery film &quot;On the Other Hand, Death&quot;, as well as a supporting role as Laurie Strode&#x27;s therapist, in Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;Halloween II&quot; (2009). In an interview with the LGBT publication &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Kidder discussed her later career choices: &quot;I&#x27;m not choosy at all! I&#x27;ll do practically anything. I&#x27;m the biggest whore on the block. I live in a little town in Montana, and you have to drag me out of here to get to L.A., so I&#x27;m not readily available. But unless it&#x27;s something sexist or cruel, I just love to work. I&#x27;ve done all sorts of things, but you just haven&#x27;t seen them because they&#x27;re often very bad and shown at 4 in the morning.&quot;

In 2015, Kidder won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in Children&#x27;s Programming for her performance in &quot;R.L. Stine&#x27;s The Haunting Hour&quot;.

== Other ventures ==

=== Politics ===
Kidder was a longtime supporter of the U.S. Democratic party and voiced her support for liberal causes throughout her career. She actively supported Jesse Jackson&#x27;s bid for the Democratic nomination in the 1984 and 1988 United States presidential election. In the early 1990s, during the first Gulf War, Kidder was branded a &quot;Baghdad Betty&quot; and subjected to abuse for her remarks questioning the war. In a piece called &quot;Confessions of &#x27;Baghdad Betty&#x27;&quot;, styled as a letter to her mother and printed in &quot;The Nation&quot;, Kidder responded by explaining and defending her statements.In 2008, Kidder was a volunteer at the Barack Obama campaign headquarters in Livingston, Montana.
As of November 2009, Kidder was the Montana State Coordinator for Progressive Democrats of America. The organization&#x27;s website carried her article &quot;Ax Max&quot;, in which she criticized Max Baucus, Montana&#x27;s Democratic senator. She also contributed articles to &quot;CounterPunch&quot;, a left-wing magazine, beginning in 2009. On August 22, 2015, she was named the host of a dinner event by the Yellowstone County Democrats in Billings, Montana, called &quot;Billings for Bernie&quot; in support of Bernie Sanders&#x27; presidential primary bid. In a &quot;CounterPunch&quot; article expressing her reaction to the 2016 Democratic National Convention, she wrote, &quot;I am not an American tonight... I reject the words I voiced at my citizenship ceremony.&quot;

In addition to her campaigning in the United States, Kidder expressed support for liberal causes in Canada. In 2011, she supported her brother, John Kidder, in British Columbia, who was running to be a member of Canada&#x27;s Parliament for the Liberal Party: &quot;I&#x27;m here not only because John is a dream candidate, but because I&#x27;m living in the end game in the United States and it&#x27;s not funny. Canada is starting the same sort of right-wing, corporate ownership of government, corporate tradeoffs with government, smear campaigns, &quot;let&#x27;s lower the corporate tax rate without mentioning it&#x27;s going to up the private tax rates.&quot; It&#x27;s happening in Canada. God forbid if anyone should bring up privatizing health care.&quot;

=== Activism ===
Throughout her life, Kidder was also invested in efforts protesting for environmental and anti-nuclear causes. On August 23, 2011, Kidder, Tantoo Cardinal, and dozens of others were arrested while protesting in Washington, D.C., against the proposed extension of the Keystone Pipeline. In 2012, she appeared in a video for &quot;Stop the Frack Attack&quot;, an environmental organization working toward regulating hydraulic fracturing (&quot;fracking&quot;) practices. When discussing sustainable energy, Kidder said: &quot;The first thing people have to start facing, contrary to the advertising fed to us by oil and gas companies, is that environmentalism and economic stability go hand-in-hand on any long term basis.&quot; Kidder spent the winter of 2016–2017 residing in a tent at the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota, protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline.

In addition to environmental causes, Kidder was a vocal supporter of LGBT rights, and in 2003 hosted benefits at a gay and lesbian health center in Boston, Massachusetts. Following her publicized nervous breakdown in 1996, she also spoke outwardly about her struggles with mental health and her bipolar disorder diagnosis. In 2001, she was awarded the Courage in Mental Health Award from the California Women&#x27;s Mental Health Policy Council for her public dialogue on mental illness.

== Personal life ==
Kidder became a United States citizen on August 17, 2005, in Butte, Montana, and settled in Livingston. She said that she decided to become an American citizen to participate in the voting process, to continue her protests against U.S. intervention in Iraq, and to be free of worries about being deported.

=== Relationships and marriages ===
While filming, Kidder became romantically involved with Thomas McGuane, and in March 1975 relocated with him to Livingston, Montana. She subsequently became pregnant, and gave birth to their only child, daughter Maggie McGuane, on October 28, 1975. Kidder and McGuane married on August 2, 1976, but the marriage ended in divorce on July 21, 1977. During the marriage, Kidder stated that her self-esteem had faltered significantly, and she found it difficult to maintain a career in film while residing in Montana.

On August 25, 1979, she married actor John Heard, but the couple separated only six days into their marriage. Their divorce was finalized on December 26, 1980.

Kidder was romantically linked to Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau in the early-1980s. 

Kidder married Philippe de Broca in 1983. Her marriage to de Broca lasted one year, ending in divorce in 1984. Kidder later characterized the marriage as &quot;impulsive, I&#x27;m afraid. Not a little irresponsible. We just weren&#x27;t meant to be married to each other.&quot;

=== Personal struggles ===
Kidder received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in 1988, which she rejected at the time, and refused the recommended lithium treatment.

In December 1990, Kidder was seriously injured in a car accident during the filming of the pilot of a proposed television series &quot;Nancy Drew and Daughter&quot; which left her partially paralyzed as a result of spinal injury. She was unable to work for two years, causing her financial difficulties, resulting in debts of over $800,000. Kidder attempted to sue the Canadian producer, Nelvana, for $1 million in damages but did not receive a settlement, and her launching of the suit rendered her ineligible for Canadian workers&#x27; compensation. While convalescing from her injuries, Kidder said she finally &quot;was able to accept the diagnosis&quot; (of bipolar disorder). She later spoke openly about treatment of her bipolar disorder via orthomolecular medicine.

In April 1996, she experienced a widely publicized manic episode in Los Angeles. At the time, Kidder had been working on an autobiography when her laptop computer became infected with a virus, which caused it to crash and her to lose three years&#x27; worth of drafts. Kidder flew to California to have the computer examined by a data retrieval company that was unable to retrieve the lost files. This prompted her to enter a manic state and she disappeared for four days. She was later found by a homeowner in the backyard of a Glendale residence, and was taken by the Los Angeles Police Department to Olive View–UCLA Medical Center in a distressed state, the caps on her teeth having been knocked out during a rape attempt. She was subsequently placed in psychiatric care. A computer expert was ultimately able to retrieve much of the data that Kidder had lost on her laptop.

In a 2000 interview, Kidder stated that, in addition to suffering emotional distress, her manic episodes had led her to experiencing significant financial woes: &quot;I went through millions of dollars—I have no idea how much. I&#x27;d buy things for friends, take people to Paris. Once I stayed up for three weeks in a row because I felt like I was called upon to write a new religion for women. I was reading all these books, including the Bible—and I&#x27;m an atheist.&quot;

== Death ==

Kidder died on May 13, 2018, at her home in Livingston, Montana, at the age of 69. Kidder&#x27;s death was ruled a suicide by &quot;self-inflicted drug and alcohol overdose&quot;. Kidder had been scheduled to appear at the Motor City Comic Con event in Novi, Michigan, later that week. 

Kidder&#x27;s friends related that she had poor health in later years, particularly following her lengthy stay at the Standing Rock protest camp in 2016, often enduring frigid temperatures. DC Comics stated on its Twitter feed: &quot;Thank you for being the Lois Lane so many of us grew up with. RIP, Margot Kidder.&quot; After her death, director Ted Geoghegan, who knew the actress, stated:

Kidder was cremated, and her ashes were scattered by her brother John in childhood-favorite locations in Canada, as well as in Montana, amongst lilies often eaten by grizzly bears, partially fulfilling Kidder&#x27;s wish to &quot;have her body just left out there for the bears.&quot;

<text>In phonetics and phonology, a uvular stop is a type of consonantal sound, made with the back of the tongue in contact with the uvula, which hangs down in front of the throat (hence uvular), held tightly enough to block the passage of air (hence a stop consonant).

Uvular stops are acoustically similar to but less common than the velar stops (e.g. and ), and do not occur in English. Uvular stops are common in certain parts of the world, e.g. the Caucasian languages and the Pacific Northwest languages of North America. However, they are unattested in the European languages (outside of a few peripheral areas such as the Caucasus).

The most common sound is the voiceless stop . This sound is well known in Arabic, and occurs (at least in Standard Arabic) in words such as &quot;Quran&quot; (Koran), &quot;Qatar&quot;, and &quot;Al-Qahira&quot; (Arabic for Cairo). More generally, several kinds are distinguished:

* , voiceless uvular plosive
* , voiced uvular plosive
* , uvular nasal
* , uvular ejective
* , voiced uvular implosive (very rare)
* or voiceless uvular implosive (claimed to exist in Kaqchikel)</text><links>

<doc id="1255502" wikidata="Q432462" url="?curid=1255502" title="Takayasu's arteritis">
<text>Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis (TA), also known as aortic arch syndrome, nonspecific aortoarteritis, and pulseless disease, is a form of large vessel granulomatous vasculitis with massive intimal fibrosis and vascular narrowing, most commonly affecting young or middle-aged women of Asian descent, though anyone can be affected. It mainly affects the aorta (the main blood vessel leaving the heart) and its branches, as well as the pulmonary arteries. Females are about 8–9 times more likely to be affected than males.

Those with the disease often notice symptoms between 15 and 30 years of age. In the Western world, atherosclerosis is a more frequent cause of obstruction of the aortic arch vessels than Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis. Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis is similar to other forms of vasculitis, including giant cell arteritis which typically affects older individuals. Due to obstruction of the main branches of the aorta, including the left common carotid artery, the brachiocephalic artery, and the left subclavian artery, Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis can present as pulseless upper extremities (arms, hands, and wrists with weak or absent pulses on the physical examination) which may be why it is also commonly referred to as the &quot;pulseless disease.&quot; Involvement of renal arteries may lead to a presentation of renovascular hypertension.

==Sign and symptoms==
Some people develop an initial &quot;inflammatory phase&quot; characterized by systemic illness with signs and symptoms of malaise, fever, night sweats, weight loss, joint pain, fatigue, and fainting. Fainting may result from subclavian steal syndrome or carotid sinus hypersensitivity. There is also often anemia and marked elevation of the ESR or C-reactive protein (nonspecific markers of inflammation). The initial &quot;inflammatory phase&quot; is often followed by a secondary &quot;pulseless phase&quot;. The &quot;pulseless phase&quot; is characterized by vascular insufficiency from intimal narrowing of the vessels manifesting as arm or leg claudication, renal artery stenosis causing hypertension, and neurological manifestations due to decreased blood flow to the brain.

Of note is the function of renal artery stenosis in the causation of high blood pressure: Normally perfused kidneys produce a proportionate amount of a substance called renin. Stenosis of the renal arteries causes hypoperfusion (decreased blood flow) of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, resulting in exaggerated secretion of renin, and high blood levels of aldosterone, eventually leading to water and salt retention and high blood pressure. The neurological symptoms of the disease vary depending on the degree; the nature of the blood vessel obstruction; and can range from lightheadedness to seizures (in severe cases). 

One rare, important feature of the Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis is ocular involvement in form of visual field defects, vision loss, or retinal hemorrhage. Some individuals with Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis may present with only late vascular changes, without a preceding systemic illness. In the late stage, weakness of the arterial walls may give rise to localized aneurysms. As with all aneurysms, the possibility of rupture and vascular bleeding is existent and requires monitoring. In view of the chronic process and good collateral development, Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon or digital gangrene are very rare in Takayasu arteritis. A rare complication of this condition are coronary artery aneurysms.
Laser Doppler imaging by near-infrared digital holography can reveal characteristic blood flow waveforms in the central artery and vein of the retina in patients with vascular insufficiency who may exhibit a smooth systo-diastolic pulse in the central retinal artery. This technique enables non invasive functional microangiography by high-contrast measurement of endoluminal blood flow profiles in vessels in the posterior segment of the eye with a spatial resolution comparable to state-of-the-art indocyanine green angiography.

==Causes==

Although the cause of Takayasu arteritis is unknown, the condition is characterized by segmental and patchy granulomatous inflammation of the aorta and its major derivative branches. This inflammation leads to arterial stenosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms. There is irregular fibrosis of the blood vessels due to chronic vasculitis, leading to sometimes massive intimal fibrosis (fibrosis of the inner section of the blood vessels). Prominent narrowing due to inflammation, granuloma, and fibrosis is often seen in arterial studies such as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or arterial angiography (DSA).

===Genetics===
The genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis is supported by the genetic association with HLA-B∗52. A 2013 large collaborative study uncovered multiple additional susceptibility loci for this disease, increasing its number of genetic loci to five risk loci across the genome. About 200,000 genetic variants were genotyped in two ethnically divergent Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis cohorts from Turkey and North America by using a custom-designed genotyping platform (Immunochip). Additional genetic variants and the classical HLA alleles were imputed and analyzed. The study identified and confirmed two independent susceptibility loci within the HLA region (r2 &lt; 0.2): HLA-B/MICA (rs12524487, OR = 3.29, p = 5.57 × 10-16) and HLA-DQB1/HLA-DRB1 (rs113452171, OR = 2.34, p = 3.74 × 10-9; and rs189754752, OR = 2.47, p = 4.22 × 10-9). In addition, a genetic association was identified and confirmed between Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis and the FCGR2A/FCGR3A locus on chromosome 1 (rs10919543, OR = 1.81, p = 5.89 × 10-12). The risk allele at this locus results in increased mRNA expression of FCGR2A. In addition, a genetic association between IL12B and Takayasu arteritis was established (rs56167332, OR = 1.54, p = 2.18 × 10-8). A fifth genetic locus for the disease in an intergenic region on chromosome 21q22 downstream of PSMG1 was revealed (P=4.39X10-7). A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified genetic susceptibility loci for Takayasu arteritis with a genome-wide level of significance in IL6 (rs2069837) (odds ratio [OR] 2.07, P = 6.70 × 10(-9)), RPS9/LILRB3 (rs11666543) (OR 1.65, P = 2.34 × 10(-8)), and the intergenic locus on chromosome 21q22 (rs2836878) (OR 1.79, P = 3.62 × 10(-10)). The genetic susceptibility locus in RPS9/LILRB3 lies within the leukocyte receptor complex gene cluster on chromosome 19q13.4, and the disease risk variant in this locus correlates with reduced expression of multiple genes including the inhibitory leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor gene LILRB3 (P = 2.29 × 10(-8)). In addition, this study identified additional candidate susceptibility genes with suggestive levels of association (P &lt; 1 × 10(-5)) including PCSK5, LILRA3, PPM1G/NRBP1, and PTK2B.

Another gene associated with this condition is &quot;MLX&quot; (Max-like protein X)

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on the demonstration of vascular lesions in large and middle-sized vessels on angiography, CT scan, magnetic resonance angiography or FDG PET. Seeing abnormal diffuse arterial wall thickening, the &#x27;macaroni sign&#x27;, with ultrasound is highly suggestive of the condition. FDG PET can help in diagnosis of active inflammation not just in patients with active Takayasu arteritis prior to treatment but also in addition in relapsing patients receiving immunosuppressive agents.

Contrast angiography has been the gold standard. The earliest detectable lesion is a local narrowing or irregularity of the lumen. This may develop into stenosis and occlusion. The characteristic finding is the presence of &quot;skip lesions,&quot; where stenosis or aneurysms alternate with normal vessels. Angiography provides information on vessel anatomy and patency but does not provide information on the degree of inflammation in the wall.

The age at onset helps to differentiate Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis from other types of large vessel vasculitis. For example, Takaysu&#x27;s arteritis has an age of onset of &lt;40 years, while giant cell arteritis has an age of onset &gt;60 years.

Takayasu arteritis is not associated with ANCA, rheumatoid factor, ANA, and anticardiolipin antibodies.

==Treatments==
Most people with Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis respond to steroids such as prednisone. The usual starting dose is approximately 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (for most people, this is approximately 60 milligrams a day). Because of the significant side effects of long-term high-dose prednisone use, the starting dose is tapered over several weeks to a dose that controls symptoms while limiting the side effects of steroids.

Promising results are achieved with mycophenolate and tocilizumab. If treatment is not kept to a high standard, long-term damage or death can occur.

Patients who do not respond to steroids may require revascularization, either via vascular bypass or angioplasty and stenting. Outcomes following revascularization vary depending on the severity of the underlying disease.

==History==
The first case of Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis was described in 1908 by Japanese ophthalmologist Mikito Takayasu at the Annual Meeting of the Japan Ophthalmology Society. Takayasu described a peculiar &quot;wreathlike&quot; appearance of the blood vessels in the back of the eye (retina). Two Japanese physicians at the same meeting (Drs. Onishi and Kagoshima) reported similar eye findings in individuals whose wrist pulses were absent.

It is now known that the blood vessel malformations that occur in the retina are an angiogenic response to the arterial narrowings in the neck and that the absence of pulses noted in some people occurs because of narrowings of the blood vessels to the arms. The eye findings described by Takayasu are rarely seen in patients from North America and British Columbia.

HISTORY 

Jayram Pur is sub village situated in west of Kharota Syedan.

Kharota Syedan takes its name from the islamic honorific, Syed. Prior to the arrival of Islamic teachers in the 1100s AD, the holder of the village lands was Jay Ram Choudhry, a Hindu in the Lodhra family of the Jat clan. At that time, the village was called &quot;Jayrampur&quot;.

Over time, the Syed family as well as people of varied ethnic origins and religions have settled in the village. These include the Choudhry family descendants, Gujjar, Arain, Rajput and the Pashtun people.

The principle Islamic teacher in the Jhelum region, now revered as a saint, was a man called Salah ad-Din from Hindustan. He converted the ruler of Jhelum, Jaadha Paswal of the Gujjar clan to Islam. When Salah was called to move on to Sialkot, the Jaadha Paswal sent his son, Khair with him.

When Salah ad-Din and Khair Paswal arrived in Kharota Syedan, they lived at the site of the present village &quot;khanqah&quot; (place of religious gathering or spiritual retreat.) Salah ad-Din married Jay Ram Choudhry&#x27;s daughter and took the village as dowry. Salah ad-Din&#x27;s cousins came to live in the village.

Salah ad-Din&#x27;s wife died without issue and was buried in the family &quot;hujrah&quot; (mausoleum). When he was dying, Salah left his estate, including the village and surrounding fertile lands, to Khair Paswal. However, Khair Paswal refused the inheritance, saying, &quot;Sarkar, I am not hungry for lands. My elders are still ruling Upper Jehlem. I was ordered to serve you, being the son of the Prophet Muhammad (S.W.S.) and so I did. If, at all, you want to gift me something, please allow me and my kin to be buried near your feet.&quot;

Hearing this, Salah ad-Din raised his hands in supplication and prayed for the prosperity Khair Paswal and his descendants. He made Khair paswal and his family his &quot;mutawallies&quot; and &quot;mujawars&quot; (burial caretakers). The village itself was distributed among Salah ad-Din&#x27;s relatives. The surrounding lands were returned to the Lodhra family.

The first khanqah in Kharota Syedan (&quot;Darbar Chitti Khanghah&quot;) was founded by Fateh, son of Fazal, descendant of Khair Paswal. An annual festival to pay homage to Salah ad-Din takes place in May and June.

Refugees of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 settled in Kharota Syedan, contributing to the diversity of the population.

<text>Golddiggas, Headnodders and Pholk Songs is the ninth and penultimate album by The Beautiful South, released in 2004. It is almost entirely a covers album, with one notable exception. The track &quot;This Old Skin&quot; was originally claimed to have been written by Bobby Christiansand/Barry Klein, and to have been originally performed by an obscure band called &quot;The Heppelbaums&quot; in the 1970s, but it was later revealed to have been an original composition by the usual Beautiful South writing team, Paul Heaton and Dave Rotheray. This was confirmed in 2006 by frontman Paul Heaton during a Question and Answer session entitled &quot;Ask the Band&quot;. Prior to that, a website for The Heppelbaums had been created, in which many more clues to the real identity of the band were revealed. The domain was created on 5 August 2004 and registered to Sony, the band&#x27;s record label. Although the website no longer exists, the contents can still be found on 

&quot;Livin&#x27; Thing&quot;, &quot;This Old Skin&quot;, and &quot;This Will Be Our Year&quot; were all released as singles.

<doc id="1255516" wikidata="Q1123936" url="?curid=1255516" title="Why? (American band)">
<text>Why? (styled as WHY?) is an American alternative hip hop and indie rock band. The band was founded in 2004 by Cincinnati rapper and singer Yoni Wolf, who had been using Why? as his stage name since 1997. In addition to Wolf, who serves as lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, the band consists of multi-instrumentalists and backing vocalists Doug McDiarmid and Matt Meldon, and drummer and backing vocalist Josiah Wolf, who is Yoni Wolf&#x27;s older brother.

Why? has released eight studio albums, along with several extended plays, demo albums, and live albums, since their inception. Yoni Wolf&#x27;s final solo album under the Why? moniker, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Oaklandazulasylum&quot;, is typically considered part of the band&#x27;s discography. Their first album as a full band was 2005&#x27;s &quot;Elephant Eyelash&quot;. They followed this album with &quot;Alopecia&quot; (2008), &quot;Eskimo Snow&quot; (2009), &quot;Mumps, Etc.&quot; (2012), &quot;Moh Lhean&quot; (2017), &quot;AOKOHIO&quot; (2019), and &quot;The Well I Fell Into&quot; (2024). 

==History==
In 2004, Yoni Wolf enlisted his older brother Josiah, Doug McDiarmid, and Matt Meldon and formed Why?. At this time, he stopped using &#x27;Why?&#x27; as his personal stage name.

Why? released their debut full-band album &quot;Elephant Eyelash&quot; in 2005. The album deviated considerably from the sound of Yoni Wolf&#x27;s final solo project under the Why? moniker, the 2003 album &quot;Oaklandazulasylum&quot;, expanding to the sound of a full indie rock band. The group toured much of 2005 in support of the album as a four-piece. By the time of their May 2006 tour with Islands, the group had become a three-piece because Matt Meldon moved to San Juan Island off the coast of Washington to live with his girlfriend. In 2008, the group added bassist Austin Brown to their lineup, making them a four-piece once again.
For their third album, &quot;Alopecia&quot;, Why? asked the fans to contribute photographs of their palms for the album&#x27;s artwork. They released &quot;The Hollows&quot; as the first single with two different European and US versions, featuring remixes and covers by Boards of Canada, Xiu Xiu, Dntel, Half-handed Cloud, Dump and Islands. &quot;Alopecia&quot; was released in 2008 to very positive reviews. An image of the poster for &quot;Alopecia&quot; appears in &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.&quot;
In 2009, Why? released their fourth album &quot;Eskimo Snow&quot;. The ten songs on the album were recorded during the &quot;Alopecia&quot; sessions and are described by Yoni Wolf as &quot;the least hip-hop out of anything I&#x27;ve ever been involved with.&quot;

On June 27, 2012, the band announced via Stereogum that they would be releasing their new EP &quot;Sod in the Seed&quot; on August 13 on City Slang. In the same article, they premiered the title track. The song is more upbeat than any of the tracks on &quot;Eskimo Snow&quot; and contains rapping, which had been absent on the previous album.

&quot;Mumps, Etc.&quot;, their fifth album, was released on October 9, 2012.

In 2013, the band released an EP entitled &quot;Golden Tickets&quot; on the Joyful Noise label. The Golden Tickets EP is &quot;a collection of personalized &#x27;theme songs&#x27; for and about seven specific WHY? fans. Over the course of several months, Yoni and Josiah Wolf internet-stalked these fans for the purpose of crafting musical homages which would end up on this album.&quot; One track on the album focuses on an individual&#x27;s Twitter feed, while Dropjaw lipreads the verbal meanderings of a fan who sent them a soundless video of himself talking into a camera. The band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Moh Lhean&quot;, was released on March 3, 2017. Their album The Well I Fell Into was released on August 2, 2024.

<text>[[Baron]] Ferdinand de Rothschild (17 December 1839 – 17 December 1898), also known as Ferdinand James Anselm &quot;[[Freiherr]]&quot; von Rothschild, was a British banker, art collector and politician who was a member of the Rothschild family of bankers. He identified as a Liberal, later Liberal Unionist, and sat as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1898. Ferdinand had a younger sister, Alice, who like her brother was a keen horticulturalist and collector. She inherited Ferdinand&#x27;s property, Waddesdon Manor, in 1898 after he died and likewise continued the tradition of using the house as a place to keep his collections.

==Life and career==

Although Ferdinand de Rothschild was born in Paris in 1839, he was from Vienna and was a member of the Rothschild banking family of Austria. He was the second son of Anselm Salomon &quot;Freiherr&quot; von Rothschild (1803–1874), a Vienna-based banker, and his English wife Charlotte Nathan Rothschild (1807–1859), daughter of Nathan Mayer Rothschild. Ferdinand&#x27;s great-grandfather was Mayer Amschel Rothschild. He had the hereditary title of &quot;Freiherr&quot; (baron) in the Austrian nobility. He was &#x27;Ferdy&#x27; to his family and friends.

When Ferdinand became a British subject and moved from Vienna to London, &quot;[he] epitomised the expanding lifestyle of the fourth generation&quot;. On 7 June 1865, he married his second cousin Evelina de Rothschild (1839–1866), the daughter of Baron Lionel de Rothschild (1808–1879). On 4 December 1866, their son was stillborn, and Evelina died later the same day. In her memory, Ferdinand built, equipped and endowed the Evelina Hospital for Sick Children in Southwark, south London.

From 1868 to 1875, he became Treasurer of the Jewish Board of Guardians and Warden of the Central Synagogue in 1870. During these roles, Ferdinand instigated an offer of £2,000 which ultimately led to the foundation of the Army Reservists&#x27; Home.

In 1883, Ferdinand de Rothschild was High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire. He was adopted as a Liberal candidate for the London constituency of St George&#x27;s in the East, but on being invited, he contested in 1885 another seat, at Aylesbury, which he won and held until his death. In 1886, over the issue of Irish Home Rule, he joined the Liberal Unionists and hosted meetings at Waddesdon Manor (where Joseph Chamberlain, Arthur Balfour and Lord Randolph Churchill were often guests) that led to the formation of the Unionist-Conservative alliance.

From 1896, he was a Trustee of the British Museum, a role suggested by Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks and which led to his Renaissance collection being bequeathed to the British Museum after his death. This is now exhibited as the Waddesdon Bequest.

Ferdinand de Rothschild died at Waddesdon Manor on his 59th birthday, thought to be the result of a cold caught when last visiting his wife&#x27;s tomb. He was buried next to his wife at the Rothschild Mausoleum in the Jewish Cemetery at West Ham.

== Collecting ==

Fluent in three languages, and considered &quot;as much at home in Paris as in London&quot;, Ferdinand was an already inspired collector of eighteenth-century French decorative arts from his early twenties. For instance, when he was only 21 years old, his first purchase was made of one of the most ostentatious rococo Sèvres ship vases from the Louis XV era. His development into one of the most renowned collectors of the 19th century, even amongst the Rothschilds, is known by the abundance of family letters in which he is referred to as &quot;curiosity-hunting... all over Europe&quot;.

In the autumn of 1874, Ferdinand de Rothschild bought land in the village of Waddesdon in Buckinghamshire from the Duke of Marlborough in order to build a property in which he could house his diverse collections. Between 1874 and 1889, architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur designed and built Waddesdon Manor, a 19th-century manor based on the 16th-century French Chateau de Chambord. He sought to &#x27;revive the decoration of the eighteenth century in its purity, reconstructing the rooms out of old material, reproducing them as they had been during the reigns of Louis&#x27;.

His collection of Renaissance &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; from the house was bequeathed to the British Museum, and under the terms of the bequest are still displayed there separately as the Waddesdon Bequest. The Holy Thorn Reliquary is a highlight of the collection, though its distinguished provenance was unknown until after World War II. He willed Waddesdon Manor to Alice Charlotte von Rothschild, his unmarried younger sister, who had lived with him there. Yet, &#x27;towards the end of his life, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild became increasingly concerned about the future of Waddesdon Manor&#x27;, shown here in his quote from &quot;The Red Book&quot;:&quot;A future generation may reap the chief benefit of a work which to me has been a labour of love, though I fear Waddesdon will share the fate of most properties whose owners have no descendants, and fall into decay. May the day yet be distant when weeds will spread over the garden, the terraces crumble into dust, the pictures and cabinets cross the Channel or the Atlantic, and the melancholy cry of the nigh-jar sound from the deserted towers&quot; - Ferdinand de Rothschild, 1897Miss Alice, in turn, bequeathed the estate to their nephew, James Armand de Rothschild. Following James&#x27; death, the manor passed to the National Trust, in a special arrangement where the Rothschild family remain involved.

<text>Evelina London Children&#x27;s Hospital is a specialist NHS hospital in London, England. It is administratively a part of Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; NHS Foundation Trust and provides teaching facilities for London South Bank University and King&#x27;s College London School of Medicine. Formerly housed at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in Southwark, it moved to a new building alongside St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in Lambeth on 31 October 2005.

==History==
The hospital was founded in 1869 (as Evelina Hospital for Sick Children) by Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, whose wife, Evelina, and their child had died in premature labour. It was established in a purpose-built hospital in Southwark Bridge Road, Southwark, opposite what was originally the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade at 94 Southwark Bridge Road. It was brought under the management of Guy&#x27;s Hospital in 1947 and became part of the National Health Service in 1948. In 1976 the original hospital building was closed, and the children&#x27;s wards were moved to the newly built Guy&#x27;s Tower.

In 1999 a decision was made to re-establish Evelina Children&#x27;s Hospital as a new specialist hospital for all children&#x27;s services at Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27;, in Lambeth, on the site of a former nurses&#x27; home. An architectural design competition was managed by RIBA Competitions and won by Hopkins Architects and engineers Buro Happold. Davis Langdon provided quantity surveying and employer&#x27;s agent services. Construction began in 2002, and the building was completed in 2004, ready for fitting out. The building won the IStructE Award for Education or Healthcare Structures in 2006. In the same year, after a Europe-wide heatwave, the building&#x27;s project team were recalled following reports of high indoor temperatures.

In 2018, it was announced that the Duchess of Cambridge would become the hospital&#x27;s patron.

==Funding==
Although a part of the NHS, the £60 million building cost of the new Evelina London Children&#x27;s Hospital was largely paid for with private funds, with £50 million coming from the independent Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; Charity (the successor to the endowments of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, amongst others), and £10 million from NHS budgets and a major fundraising campaign by the Evelina London Children&#x27;s Charity.

The NHS Children&#x27;s and Young People&#x27;s Gender Service for London is the partnership between Evelina, Great Ormond Street Hospital and the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust to take over from the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust in the South of England.
===Fundraising===
In June 2020, aged five and inspired by Captain Tom Moore&#x27;s NHS fundraising during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tony Hudgell set out to raise £500 for Evelina London Children&#x27;s Hospital by walking 10km on his prosthetic legs. The figure quickly topped £1 million, with the final amount raised totalling £1.7 million.

==South Thames Retrieval Service==

South Thames Retrieval Service (STRS) is a children&#x27;s acute transport service which specialises in the inter-hospital transfer of critically ill children in London south of the River Thames. It operates from the children&#x27;s intensive care unit of the Evelina London Children&#x27;s Hospital. The unit is the lead centre for children&#x27;s intensive care in the South Thames region and manages the clinical network for children&#x27;s (paediatric) intensive care via the retrieval service, in conjunction with the intensive care units at St George&#x27;s Hospital and King&#x27;s College Hospital. With one phone call to the emergency number, a clinician in a South Thames hospital, can source clinical advice, a PICU bed and a transport team as necessary. STRS can then also coordinate specialist service input (e.g. cardiology).

<text>The history of the postage stamps and postal history of China is complicated by the gradual decay of Imperial China and the years of civil war and Japanese occupation in the 1930s and 1940s. In modern times, postal delivery is handled by China Post.

==Early history==
Regular government postal service is known from the Zhou dynasty in the 1st millennium BC. During the Yuan dynasty under Kublai Khan in the 12th century, China was integrated into the much larger Mongolian Örtöö system. Marco Polo reported that there were 10,000 post stages during that time. In addition, private letters were carried by the Min Hsin Chu, a system of letter guilds (&quot;hongs&quot;). Later the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta with Russia provided for the first regular exchange of mail.

==Qing dynasty==
Although postal service in China goes back some 2,500 years, modern postal services were not established until 1877 by the Qing government. 

A policy of isolation was forcibly ended in the 19th century by the Opium War and the subsequent opening of treaty ports; several nations opened foreign post offices from 1844 on. This expanded to involve dozens of cities, mostly on the coast, along the Yangtze River, and in the far south. Shanghai organized its own Shanghai local post in 1865. 

In the same year, the Irishman Robert Hart developed a mail service for the Imperial Maritime Customs, initially to carry consular mail to and from treaty ports. This service was opened to the public on 1 May 1878, and China&#x27;s first postage stamps, the &quot;Large Dragons&quot; (), were issued to handle payment. The stamps were inscribed &quot;CHINA&quot; in both Latin and Chinese characters, and denominated in candareens.

Initially, all mail to foreign destinations went through Shanghai, but by 1882 there were twelve post offices. On 20 March 1896, an edict directed that the Customs Post become the Imperial Postal Service effective 1 January 1897; the Min Hsin Chu was shut down, as well as the Shanghai local post, and postal system adopted cents and dollars as the units of currency.

Through the first half of 1897, new stamps were unavailable, and so the existing stock was surcharged in cents, with several variants distinguished by philatelists. Revenue stamps were surcharged as well.

The first new stamps, inscribed IMPERIAL CHINESE POST went on sale 16 August 1897. The twelve values, ranging from 1/2c to $5, were lithographed in Japan. The low values depicted a dragon, the middle values a carp, and the dollar values a wild goose. The paper used for these stamps had a watermark in the form of a yin-yang symbol.

In 1898, these were superseded by similar designs produced by engraving in London, and inscribed CHINESE IMPERIAL POST on a Chinese supplied watermarked paper of varying thickness. The watermark can be difficult to detect on the thicker paper. New printings of the stamp, beginning in 1899 were on unwatermarked paper, but there are no recorded usages of this variety until 1901. These stamps continued in use until the end of the empire. During that time some colors were changed to comply with Universal Postal Union regulations, and three new values were added.

The first commemorative stamps of China were issued in 1909 to mark the 1st year of the reign of the Xuantong Emperor. The set of three (2c, 3c, 7c), all depicted the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.

== Republic of China ==

===Beiyang government===
The revolution of 1911 resulted in overprints on the imperial stamps in 1912; at Fuzhou to indicate that the post office was effectively a neutral area available to both sides, and at Nanjing and Shanghai reading &quot;Republic of China&quot; (from top to bottom: ). An additional set of overprints was produced by Waterlow and Sons in London, and postmasters throughout the country made their own unofficial overprints using the same characters.

The first new designs of the Republic were two commemorative sets of 12 each, the first set depicting Sun Yat-sen and second Yuan Shikai, both issued on 14 December 1912.

The definitives of the &quot;Junk issue&quot; went on sale 5 May 1913, and continued in use into the 1930s. The low values featured a junk, while values from 15c to 50c showed a farmer reaping rice, while the dollar values depicted the three-part gateway to the Hall of Classics in Beijing. The series was first printed in London, then in Beijing from 1915; they can be distinguished by close examination. The designs were re-engraved in 1923, and a number of design features were changed; for instance, the whitecaps in the water underneath the junk were removed, and the water darkened.

China produced five new commemorative issues, of four stamps each, during the 1920s. The first, issued on 10 October 1921 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Chinese Post Office, featured then president Xu Shichang in the center, flanked by Premier Jing Yongbeng and Minister of Communication Ye Gongzuo. On 17 October 1923 a set showing the Temple of Heaven commemorated the new constitution. On 1 March 1928 a set depicting Marshal of the Army and Navy Zhang Zuolin marked his assumption of that role.

===Nationalist government===

On 18 April 1929 Chiang Kai-shek makes a first appearance, commemorating the unification of China. Finally on 30 May 1929, two days before the event, four stamps showing Sun Yat Sen&#x27;s mausoleum were issued to commemorate his state funeral. New definitives of the so-called Sun Yat-sen stamps were issued in 1931. These stamps, along with the Martyrs issue of 1932 honoring six martyrs of the Kuomintang, would see much overprinting in the next several years.

===Japanese occupation and wartime===
During the occupation of several Chinese regions by the Japanese (1937–1945), Chinese stamps were originally in use in the occupied territories. Since 1941, Chinese stamps were overprinted separately for Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, North China, Shanghai and Nanjing. And for some areas, locally designed stamps were issued.

===Communist posts===
Communist authorities issued stamps in areas over which they had control from 1930 onwards. These were usually in more remote areas, often on the mountainous borders of two provinces – hence they are often referred to as &#x27;Border Areas&#x27;. For example, the earliest communist issues (the so-called &#x27;Red Posts&#x27;) were in mountainous areas of Jiangxi, the Hunan-Hubei border area and west Fujian, bordering Jiangxi.

===Post–World War II===

The end of the conflict brought little respite to the Nationalist government, which continued to struggle with Communist forces. But they were able to issue commemoratives to remember President Lin Sen, who had died in 1943, to mark the October inauguration of Chiang, and to celebrate the Allied victory.

Inflation had been creating a need for ever-higher values throughout 1945, but in 1946 things went out of control; stocks of stamps, some dating back to 1931, were surcharged with values up to $2000, and a new design (still featuring a portrait of Sun Yat-sen) went up to $5000.

1947 saw a number of commemorative issues, and further inflation, a Sun Yat-sen with plum blossoms issue reaching $50,000 that year, then surpassed in 1948 with reissues topping out with a $5,000,000 stamp.

In 1948, a gold yuan standard was adopted, and an assortment of existing stamps were surcharged with values from 1/2c and up. This was a short-lived stopgap, and by early 1949 it became necessary to stamps and overprints with a range of values, again going up to $5,000,000.

On 1 May 1949, the government took a desperate step, which was to print undenominated stamps, sold at the daily rate of the yuan. They then adopted a silver yuan standard, and overprinted still more stamps as well as reissuing the Sun Yat-sen design valued in 1–500 cents. By August, the deteriorating political situation had caught up with the postal system, and the Nationalists&#x27; last issues on the mainland were two of a planned series of pictorial designs denominated in silver yuan. 

Following the loss of mainland China, Nationalist government stamps were restricted to Taiwan and surrounding islands. Since 2008, stamps are inscribed &quot;Republic of China (Taiwan)&quot;.

== Manchukuo ==

Japan created a puppet state called Manchukuo out of north-east China in 1932. Although the state ceased to exist after the Second World War, it managed during its lifetime to create many interesting cultural chimeras, including stamps. The designs of Manchukuo stamps show the influence of both countries. In fact, the 1944 Friendship Set was printed in both Chinese and Japanese.

==People&#x27;s Republic of China==
The postal system of the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established as the General Postal Administration in Beijing in 1949, growing out of the posts that had been operating for several years in the communist controlled areas. Development was slow; by 1949 there was only 1 post office for every 370 square kilometers. Several of the communist controlled areas continued to operate their own postal systems; most were ordered to stop selling regional stamp issues by 30 June 1950, while the Northeast Liberation Area and the Port Arthur and Dairen Post and Telegraph Administration continued to use their own stamps (due to the different currencies) until the end of 1950.

=== Postage stamps ===
The unified administration issued its first postage stamps on 8 October 1949, consisting of a set of four depicting a lantern and the Gate of Heavenly Peace, commemorating the 1st session of the Chinese People&#x27;s Consultative Political Conference. This issue also inaugurated the innovative practice of numbering each type of stamp issued, usually in the lower left corner. For instance, the $800 value in the Dove of Peace issue of 1950 is numbered &quot;5.3-2&quot;, indicating that it is the second stamp of three in the fifth stamp issue of China. The practice is only followed for commemorative and special stamps, regular definitive stamps having no special markings.

The first definitive series came in February 1950, and featured the Gate of Heavenly Peace against a background of clouds. The nine values ranged from $200 to $10,000. The design was modified several times over the next year, and again in 1954, resulting in what philatelists call the &quot;second&quot; through &quot;sixth&quot; issues, each varying in minor ways, such as the layout of the clouds.

The postal system found it necessary to surcharge stamps of the previous government, with issues in March and August 1950, and May 1951. In addition, leftover stamps of the Northeastern Provinces were pressed into service in July 1950, and those of East China in December 1950.

In the meantime, various commemoratives marked conferences and other events of the young republic. In June 1952 a set of forty stamps depicting physical exercises was issued in conjunction with a radio program; ten exercises were illustrated, each with a block of four, where each stamp shows a different position of arms and legs for the exercise.

===Cultural Revolution===
Reduced stamp sales and withdrawals from issue of several stamps during the Cultural Revolution resulted in a few stamps that are quite scarce, especially used. The typical pattern resulting in rarity was unauthorized sales before the official date of issue by isolated post offices of stamps which were then withdrawn from issue before the official date of issue. One rarity, an unissued 8f stamp from 1967 commemorating the 40th Anniversary of Establishment of Jing Gangshan Revolutionary Base, popularly known as &quot;Big Blue Sky&quot;, which pictured Chairman Mao and Lin Biao on the podium overlooking Tienanmen Square exists only as scraps salvaged from the destruction process. Only scraps from one stamp in the withdrawn set are known to exist.

During the Cultural Revolution era, between the year of 1967 and 1971, there were 19 sets total 80 stamps issued by the China Postal Service, with its distinct design and strong political overtone, these stamps became highly collectable after the end of Cultural Revolution.

=== Postal service ===
The postal service was established rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. By 1952 the principal postal networks centered on the capital, Beijing, and links to all large cities had been established. Great progress was made in improving the postal service under the First Five-Year Plan. Postal service was also developed in the rural areas. Besides extending rural postal routes, the problem of delivering mail to places below the county level was solved by enlisting the aid of the population. From 1954 onward a system of mail delivery by rural postal workers was tried in agricultural cooperatives, and in 1956 this system was extended throughout the country. By 1959 the national postal network was complete.

Postal service was administered by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (now the Ministry of Information Industry), which was established in 1949 and reestablished in 1973 after a two-year period during which the postal and telecommunications functions had been separated and the ministry downgraded to a subministerial level.

In 1984 China had 53,000 post and telecommunications offices and 5 million kilometers of postal routes, including 240,000 kilometers of railroad postal routes, 624,000 kilometers of highway postal routes, and 230,000 kilometers of airmail routes. By 1985 post offices were handling 4.7 billion first-class letters and 25 billion newspapers and periodicals. In 1987, after a six-year hiatus, six-digit postal codes were ordered to be put into use.

For many years, China was not a member of the Universal Postal Union, and while using Arabic numerals for the denominations, did not include the country&#x27;s name in Latin letters as required of UPU nations. The addition of &quot;CHINA&quot; to stamps&#x27; inscriptions began in 1992. Western collectors typically differentiate earlier stamps both by the serial numbers in the lower corner, and by the first character of the country name 中, the &quot;square box with a vertical bar&quot; being visually distinct from the inscription used by any other Asian country.

<text>Giovanni Battista Velluti, colloquially &quot;Giambattista&quot; (28 January 1780 – 22 January 1861), was an Italian castrato. Considered &quot;the last great castrato&quot;, he had a reputation of being something of a diva, with some singers refusing to appear with him.

== Biography ==
Born in Pausula (near Macerata), Italy, a local doctor castrated him at the age of eight as treatment for a cough and high fever. Velluti&#x27;s father, who had planned on a military career for his son, enrolled him in musical training. He became close friends with Luigi Cardinal Chiaramonte, the man who would become Pope Pius VII, after singing a cantata sometime in his teenage years. In 1800, he made his debut at Forlì.

The last great castrato roles were composed specifically for him: Arsace in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Aureliano in Palmira&quot; (1813) and Armando in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot; (1824). He made his London debut in 1825 in &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot;. The crowds reacted poorly to his initial performances as he was the first castrato to appear in London in 25 years, but he drew crowds until the end of his career. In 1826 he took over management of The King&#x27;s Theatre in London and appeared there in &quot;Aureliano in Palmira&quot; and Morlacchi&#x27;s &quot;Tebaldo ed Isolina&quot;. However, his career as a theatre manager ended following financial quarrels over extra pay for the chorus. He returned to London in 1829, but appeared only in concerts. Upon his retirement from the stage, he became an agriculturist and died in 1861.

==Honnō-ji incident==
Honnō-ji is most famous for the Honnō-ji incident, the assassination of the powerful warlord Oda Nobunaga, which occurred there on 21 June 1582. Nobunaga lodged at the temple with little protection before his invasion of the west, but was betrayed by his general Akechi Mitsuhide, who moved in superior forces by subterfuge, besieged the temple, and set it on fire. Knowing there was no way out for him, Nobunaga committed &quot;seppuku&quot; along with his attendant Mori Ranmaru.

In 1591, Nobunaga&#x27;s successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the reconstruction of Honnō-ji, but on a different site due to the tragic circumstances. Honnō-ji was rebuilt on its current location in present-day Nakagyō Ward, near Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station.

<text>Édouard Bovet (14 September 1797 – 25 October 1849) was a Swiss watchmaker and founder of the Bovet Fleurier watch company.

==Early life==
Édouard Bovet was born in Fleurier in Neuchâtel, the son of Jean Frédéric Bovet, in 1797. Although the &quot;&quot;Genève&quot; tag is virtually compulsory for Swiss watches in the highest price bracket, it is the lesser-known name &quot;Fleurier&quot;&quot; name that marks Bovet watches. Bovet originated from this village in the Val-de-Travers, to the west of Neuchâtel. Watchmaking was introduced there between 1730 and 1740 by David Vaucher, probably a pupil of Daniel JeanRichard. The number of watchmakers in the Val-de-Travers grew rapidly in the first half of the 19th century. The lacemaking that had provided work for one-third of the people living in the valley had been replaced by the much lower cost production on Jacquard machines in France and Flanders.

Four more sons and a daughter were born in the following years. After completing his apprenticeship as a watchmaker, Edouard Bovet and two of his brothers moved to London, then the center of watch assembly and the watch trade in 1814.

== Career ==

=== 1818–1830 ===
He found a job with the Magniac company who sent him to Canton in 1818 as a watch repairer; this was the sole Chinese port that tolerated European merchants and businessmen — the so-called “red-haired barbarians”. In Canton in 1818, he formed a partnership with his brothers in 1822. The enterprise, which made luxury watches in Switzerland for export to China, was a resounding success. 
The flourishing watch trade with China prompted Bovet to set up his own company in 1822: he founded a general partnership with his two brothers in London and one brother who had remained in Fleurier; the fourth and youngest brother also entered the business. Soon every first class watch in China with a high practical value and elegant exterior was simply called &quot;Bovet&quot;. Pearl ornamentation and enamel miniature painting carried out in Geneva on Bovet watches ensured first class aesthetics at prices that, in contrast to the exaggerated luxury watches of the time, were affordable, at least for the upper class. 
For years a Bovet watch was considered an asset in China and was accepted in payment everywhere. The movement was frequently finely engraved and chased and could be observed through a glass cover on the back. The central second hand that jumped every second, like modern quartz watches, was a Bovet specialty. Bovet adapted its production to the Chinese tradition of making gifts of valuable objects (statues, vases, horses even concubines) in pairs. So he could often sell two identical watches at the same time: if one failed, a replacement was at hand. But Bovet’s enamel painters found it very difficult to paint two identical but mirror-image miniatures.

===Return to Fleurier=== 
Edouard Bovet returned to Fleurier in 1830 as a made man, accompanied by his four-year-old half-Chinese son Edouard-Georges. At that time it was customary for the European merchants in China to take a &quot;temporary&quot; wife for the duration of their stay. If children were born of this liaison, the father accepted responsibility. As a fervent republican, Bovet exposed himself in the abortive Neuchâtel revolution against Prussian rule in 1831. The house that his brothers had built for him in Fleurier according to his written instructions from China remained empty. Bovet had to move to Besançon where he continued watchmaking with the help of other exiled watchmakers.

==Legacy== 
Edouard Bovet’s brothers and nephews — all of them company shareholders — made sure that the cornerstones of the Bovet empire in Fleurier, London and Canton continued to flourish. Once the political situation was back to normal, in 1840, the firm was reregistered as Bovet Frères et Cie.; the share capital amounted to one million francs. Edouard Bovet died in 1849; he lived long enough to witness the triumph of the republic and the withdrawal of the Prussians in the previous year. The succession was settled and the production for China continued; in 1855 Bovet was awarded a gold medal at the world exhibition in Paris for an absolutely identical pair of watches ordered by the Chinese emperor.

Two generations later the Bovets were running a flourishing Swiss-Chinese commercial enterprise and were no longer interested in watchmaking. The name was sold several times and relaunched in 1994. The current Bovet watches are modeled on their luxury precursors from the 19th century and look like pocket watches for the wrist.

<text>The National Labour Party () was an Irish political party active between 1944 and 1950. It was founded in 1944 from a rebel faction of the Labour Party, inspired by the intransigence of the incumbent leadership of the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ITGWU) against the majority of the party on the basis that communists had infiltrated Labour at the turn of the 1940s.

== History ==

The split in the Labour Party was preceded by divisions in the broader labour movement, specifically the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union under William O&#x27;Brien and the Workers&#x27; Union of Ireland under James Larkin. Larkin had rejoined the party in 1941, and two years later, he was nominated by the Dublin North-East branch of the Labour Party to contest the 1943 general election. The Administrative Council of the national party, with ITGWU members in the majority, refused to ratify this nomination. However, the Dublin party and Dublin-based candidates supported Larkin, as did Labour leader William Norton, and eventually Larkin was a victorious Labour candidate. When the ITGWU faction sought the expulsion of Dublin officials as revenge, it was routed. Two weeks later, the ITGWU disaffiliated from the Labour Party. Five of the eight TDs sponsored by the union resigned from the parliamentary party to form the National Labour Party in January 1944, led by William O&#x27;Brien and James Everett. Senator Thomas Foran was appointed chairman of the party. Foran was still recognised by other Labour senators as Leader of the Labour Party in the Seanad.

There was much bitterness between the two parties. The ITGWU claimed that communists had infiltrated the Labour Party. The ITGWU attacked &quot;Larkinite and Communist Party elements&quot; which it claimed had taken over the Labour Party. The split and the anti-communist assault put Labour on the defensive. Alfred O&#x27;Rahilly in &quot;The Communist Front and the Attack on Irish Labour&quot; widened the assault to include the influence of British-based unions and communists in the ITUC. The National Labour Party juxtaposed itself against this by emphasising its commitment to Catholic Social Teaching. Presiding at a meeting of the provisional executive of the party in March 1944, Thomas Foran expressed its &quot;unqualified support&quot; of Irish neutrality and condemned a declaration of the Communist Party of Ireland &quot;expressing approval of the attempt to force this country to abandon neutrality.&quot; Senator Michael Colgan, a National Labour candidate speaking of the party in May 1944, claimed that &quot;they had broken away from the Irish Labour Party because it was not Irish, nor did it fulful the expectations that an Irish labour party should have for the people.&quot; Speaking after Mass, Cork general election candidate P.J O&#x27;Brien claimed that &quot;with the dissolution of the Communist Party of Ireland, these people (communists) are endeavouring to get a foothold on the Irish Labour Party.&quot;

Speaking at a National Labour delegate conference in October 1944, Everett stated that the Labour Party&#x27;s attitude to Peadar Cowan&#x27;s new openly communist organisation &quot;The Vanguard&quot; demonstrated how &quot;helplessly the party leaders were caught in the Communist web&quot; and &quot;the individuals running the Vanguard were the same people who crashed into the party in 1942, founded the notorious Dublin Central branch and caused the party constitution to be torn up.&quot;

The Catholic press supported the ITGWU&#x27;s allegations, which were founded on James Larkin&#x27;s communist activities in groups like the Irish Worker League. The number of communists in the movement had increased since 1941, when the Communist Party of Ireland had disbanded and its members had joined the Labour movement. Based on conservative labour support, the National Labour Party won four seats in the 1944 election. At a meeting in Rathdowney, Labour politician William Davin criticised the new party in the aftermath of the election, referring to them as &quot;disruptionist&quot; and told his audience that he strongly resented being called a communist by &quot;certain persons who did not bother to go to church or chapel either on Sundays or weekdays.&quot; In response, National Labour stated that &quot;Mr Davin and his colleagues short-circuited any kind of unbiased inquisition by setting up a tribunal of their own on which those very people charged with complicity in the Communist fusion sat as the judges and assessors.&quot; Continuing, they said that &quot;Mr Davin is not a Communist; no one in the National Labour Party either thought or said that he was.&quot; A failed attempt by the Labour Party to end the split occurred in May 1944. In June 1944, the &quot;Donegal News&quot; wrote that &quot;Mr. Norton and his colleagues may well reflect that the advent of a National Labour Party puts an end to future Labour hopes of a come-back&quot;.

In 1947, National Labour criticised Labour&#x27;s renewed calls for unity and that &quot;failure to maintain unity within the Party occurred in 1943 when some members of the Administrative Council of the Party allowed themselves to be frightened or fooled into handing over control to a self-styled Dublin Executive, from whom they took their orders.&quot; They also stated that &quot;those who wrecked the Labour Party four years ago, and had previously, by their policy of intrigue sought to make it their mouthpiece for Communist propaganda, cannot be permitted to continue their activities under cover of a democratic political organisation.&quot; National Labour also condemned the alleged influence of British trade unions in the Labour Party. Seamus O&#x27;Farrell was General Secretary of the National Labour Party that year.

National Labour won five seats in the 1948 election. After the election, the National Labour Party entered the First Inter-Party Government, against the wishes of the ITGWU. The party was in government with four other parties, including the Labour Party. National Labour was represented at cabinet level by James Everett, now its leader, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Co-operation in government, the retirement of O&#x27;Brien and the death of Larkin removed the causes of animosity from the labour movement. In 1950, the National Labour Party folded back into Labour. In 1951, James Ryan of Fianna Fáil criticised National Labour&#x27;s decision to re-join Labour.

<text>The Battle of the Cedars () was a series of military confrontations in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War that occurred during the Continental Army&#x27;s invasion of Quebec, which began in September 1775. These skirmishes, which involved limited combat, occurred in May 1776 at and around the Cedars, west of Montreal, Quebec. American troops were opposed by a small British Army detachment leading a larger force of Iroquois warriors and Canadian militiamen.

Brigadier General Benedict Arnold, commanding the American garrison at Montreal, had placed a detachment of his troops at the Cedars in April 1776, after hearing of rumors of British and Indian military preparations to the west of Montreal. The detachment surrendered on May 19 after a confrontation with a combined Anglo-Iroquois force led by Captain George Forster. American reinforcements on their way to the Cedars were also captured after a brief skirmish on May 20. All of the prisoners were eventually released after negotiations between Forster and Arnold, who brought a sizable force into the area. The terms of the agreement required the Americans to release an equal number of British prisoners, but the deal was repudiated by the Second Continental Congress and no British prisoners were freed.

Colonel Timothy Bedel and Lieutenant Isaac Butterfield, commanders of the American force at the Cedars, were court-martialed and cashiered from the Continental Army for their roles in the affair. After distinguishing himself as a volunteer, Bedel was given a new commission in 1777. News of the engagement included greatly inflated reports of casualties and often included graphic but false accounts of atrocities committed by the Iroquois, who made up the majority of the Forster&#x27;s force.

==Background==
The Cedars is on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River, about from the center of modern Montreal, to the southwest of the western tip of the Island of Montreal, from which it is separated by the Ottawa River. The nearby rapids in the Saint Lawrence required portage, making the Cedars a strategic landing point for anyone navigating the river to or from Montreal. Crossing of the Ottawa River was made between Fort Anne and Quinze-Chênes, now Vaudreuil.

===Montreal===

In September 1775 during the American Revolutionary War, Continental Army troops under first Major General Philip Schuyler and later Brigadier General Richard Montgomery invaded the British Province of Quebec. Montreal was taken without a fight on November 13, following the siege of Fort St. Jean. Montgomery left a garrison of troops under the command of Major General David Wooster in control of Montreal before leading the rest of the army to Quebec City. The occupation of Montreal was poorly managed, and relations between the Americans and the population, including those supportive of the Americans, deteriorated for a variety of reasons. One major factor that contributed to the poor relations was the American interdiction of British trade with Indians on the upper St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes, since the trade goods might be used to support British garrisons in those areas. The fur trade was economically important to the city, and its interruption affected both supporters and opponents of the American cause.

Following the American losses at the battle of Quebec at the end of 1775, Wooster eventually led reinforcements to Quebec. He arrived early in April 1776, and the military administration of Montreal passed temporarily to Colonel Moses Hazen before going to Brigadier General Benedict Arnold, who had been in command at Quebec. The American forces occupying the city numbered about 500, with additional forces at posts outside the city. Wooster had reported to General Schuyler as early as March 5 of rumored scheming between British forces and Indians to the west of the city. In response to these alarming reports, as well as the unauthorized departures of two fur traders and Claude-Nicolas-Guillaume de Lorimier, a British Indian Department agent from Montreal, Hazen had sent 400 troops commanded by Colonel Timothy Bedel of Bedel&#x27;s Regiment to occupy a strategic position at the Cedars in early April. Lieutenant Isaac Butterfield led an advance force that arrived at the Cedars on April 26 and began construction of a wooden stockade fort, fortifying it with two 4-pound cannons. Bedel and the rest of the detachment arrived on May 6.

===British call to arms===

Lorimier traveled west to Oswegatchie, where a company of the 8th Regiment of Foot under the command of George Forster had occupied Fort de La Présentation. Lorimier proposed recruiting a force of Indians to launch an attack on American troops at Montreal from the west. When Forster agreed, Lorimier went to Saint Regis, where he recruited 100 Mohawk warriors from Akwesasne. Word of these activities led the American rebels to fortify the Cedars.

At Fort Niagara in early May the Loyalist captain, John Butler, held a conference with several hundred Indians, primarily Iroquois, in which his goal was to break pledges of neutrality some of them had made in 1775. Butler, an experienced Indian agent, plied the Indians with liquor and tales of combat; he convinced more than 50 Seneca, Cayuga, and Onondaga warriors to join forces with the British, as well as some Indian warriors from further west. Historians are uncertain whether any of these recruits participated in the action at the Cedars, but it appears unlikely. Stanley (1973) is of the opinion that Indian participation was limited to those recruited by Lorimier, who went as far as Gananoque to recruit. Lanctot (1967) and Smith do not identify any specific tribes participating in the action.

James Stanley Goddard, one of the fur traders who left with Lorimier, traveled further west in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to raise an Indian force to oppose the Americans occupying Quebec. He reached Fort Michilimackinac in June, where the British commander, Captain Arent DePeyster, sent him recruiting among the Menominee and Winnebago tribes near Green Bay. DePeyster also sent out Joseph Ainsse, a local Indian interpreter, to recruit from tribes closer to the fort. None of the Indians recruited by these men reached Montreal until well after the Americans had left the city.

==Prelude==

Once forces began assembling at Oswegatchie, Lorimier made arrangements with a sympathetic priest near the Cedars for the provisioning of supplies for the troops. With the assistance of some men of the 8th Foot, he strategically hid several shallow-draft boats, known as &quot;bateaux&quot;, near a point where the Saint Lawrence River could be crossed.

Forster left Oswegatchie on May 12 with about 40 regulars, 10 men of the Canadian Militia, and 160 Iroquois warriors. On May 14, they linked up with 44 more Iroquois warriors at Saint Francis, and camped at the western end of Saint Francis Lake on May 16. On May 17, Forster received scouting reports about the troop strength at the Cedars. The Indians were concerned about the number of troops, but news that the Americans were in retreat from Quebec emboldened them to act.

On May 15, Bedel left the Cedars, leaving Butterfield in charge of the fort. Bedel later claimed that the reason for his departure was to meet with the friendly Caughnawaga Indians. In his court martial, the judges concluded this claim was suspect. He returned to Montreal and reported that a force of 150 British troops of the 8th Foot and about 500 Haudenosaunee commanded by Forster was approaching. On this news, Colonel John Paterson sent Major Henry Sherburne with 140 men from his regiment toward the Cedars. Arnold, who was meeting with the retreating Continental Army command at Sorel, returned to Montreal when the news reached him and set about organizing a larger relief force.

==Battle==

===The Cedars===
Forster&#x27;s force landed near the American-occupied fort on May 18, and sent in a demand for surrender. Butterfield countered with a request to withdraw under arms, which Forster refused. The parties exchanged fire. During the course of the exchange, Forster received word that Sherburne had crossed the Ottawa River from the island of Montreal to Quinze-Chênes but, believing the Cedars to have fallen already, had retreated back across the river. This news caused the besiegers to redouble their efforts the next day. Additional help arrived for the British in the form of about 40 Canadian militiamen under Jean-Baptiste Testard de Montigny; Forster sent them to harass Sherburne. Word then came to Forster that Sherburne had resumed his advance; Butterfield, unaware of this, surrendered the fort. The terms of capitulation included a guarantee of the personal safety of the captured men. The Haudenosaunee plundered the fort&#x27;s stores, and denied some of the captives small pouches of sometimes valuable personal items.

===Quinze-Chênes===
Sherburne reached Fort Anne, across the Ottawa River from Quinze-Chênes, on May 17. A scout he sent across the river the next day was captured by Lorimier. The scout was allowed to notify Sherburne of his capture; in his message he included a claim that 500 Indians had surrounded the fort at the Cedars. Consequently, Sherburne decided to delay crossing the river, and sent word back to Montreal requesting further assistance.

Sherburne decided to advance on May 20. Some of his men were apparently suffering from the aftereffects of smallpox, so these were left behind. Sherburne landed about 100 of his men at Quinze-Chênes, about from the Cedars. When word of this crossing reached Forster, he ordered Lorimier to take 100 Indian warriors and stop Sherburne. Lorimier was at first only able to muster 40 warriors, but was joined on the way by another 40. Sherburne, not realizing that Butterfield had already surrendered, marched his troops right at Lorimier&#x27;s advancing force. They fought for about 40 minutes before Sherburne, believing he was being attacked by a much larger force, surrendered. The Haudenosaunee claimed these captives as war spoils, since they were not part of the fort&#x27;s garrison, and prepared to kill some of them in retaliation for their own losses. Only the intervention of Forster, who paid a ransom, prevented this; it did not prevent the Haudenosaunee from stripping the prisoners of all but their clothes.

===Arnold&#x27;s relief===
Following his successes, Forster moved his forces, including all of the prisoners, down to Quinze-Chênes, where more Loyalist militia had assembled. Leaving some of the prisoners there, he advanced on May 23 to Fort Senneville, a fortified works on the southwest tip of Montreal Island that was owned by Montigny. In the meantime, Arnold gathered most of the few remaining forces in Montreal, and sent requests to the outposts around the city for additional troops. By May 24, he was entrenched at Lachine, south of the city, and his force had reached 450 men. Forster began to advance on Lachine, but decided to retreat back to Quinze-Chênes when his scouts notified him of Arnold&#x27;s position. He also received intelligence from Montreal that Arnold&#x27;s force was going to be massively reinforced—the reported number of reinforcements was 1,50 to 2,000 men, more than Arnold had available in the area.

Once his scouts reported Forster&#x27;s retreat, Arnold gave chase. He reached Fort Senneville (which he burned) on May 26, just as Forster&#x27;s men were landing on the far shore at Quinze-Chênes. Arnold decided to send a group of Caughnawagas, who were friendly to the Americans, with a demand that Forster release his prisoners and a threat that he would destroy area Indian villages if any of the prisoners were harmed. Forster countered that he would permit his Indians to kill the prisoners if Arnold attacked. Arnold attempted to cross the Ottawa River with some of his men in bateaux, but Forster used the four-pounders captured at the Cedars to drive them back.

Arnold called a war council so the Americans could consider their options. He wanted to mount a surprise attack the next morning; Hazen, who had acquired significant experience fighting Indians in the French and Indian War, argued against the idea. The disagreement between the two men was severe enough that it nearly provoked Arnold to file charges of insubordination against Hazen. The council decided not to act, voting Arnold&#x27;s proposed attack down. Early in the morning of May 27, a boat crossed the river carrying Sherburne and Forster&#x27;s deputy, Lieutenant Parke. Forster, whose forces were somewhat reduced as some of the Indians had returned to their homes, had negotiated a prisoner exchange with Sherburne and Butterfield. After further negotiations, both Arnold and Forster agreed to terms. The American prisoners were returned to Arnold at Fort Anne on May 30, after being delayed for two days by high winds on the river.

==Aftermath==
The Americans never held up their side of the prisoner exchange. Formally repudiating the agreement over the protests of George Washington, Congress accused Forster of mistreating American prisoners by turning them over to the Indians. In a breach of etiquette, the letter containing the repudiation was delivered to Lieutenant General John Burgoyne, instead of the British commander-in-chief and governor of the province, Guy Carleton. The Congressional action may have been tainted by overly lurid accounts of the action—Charles Carroll, part of a Congressional delegation that was in Montreal at the time, reported that &quot;a hundred or more [American troops] were barbarously murdered by savages.&quot; 

Arnold&#x27;s report of the incident included otherwise unsubstantiated allegations that two prisoners were killed by Forster&#x27;s Indians. Some histories of the action (for example, the 1882 history by Jones) include accounts of significant atrocities committed by the Indians, but little supporting evidence has been found. The Congressional repudiation complicated an attempted prisoner exchange in 1781 involving Burgoyne and Henry Laurens, a congressman from South Carolina whom the British were holding in the Tower of London; Laurens was eventually freed in exchange for a promise to help negotiate Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s release.

Arnold initially blamed Bedel for the defeat. He removed both Bedel and Butterfield from command and sent them to Sorel for court-martial. Due to the army&#x27;s retreat, the two men were not tried until August 1, 1776, at Fort Ticonderoga. Both were convicted and cashiered from the army. Bedel continued to volunteer his services, and following Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender at Saratoga in October 1777, he was given a new commission by Congress. The site of some of the skirmishes was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1928.

<text>The Barrera versus Morales trilogy is one of boxing&#x27;s most famous fight trilogies, involving two of Mexico&#x27;s most revered boxers, Marco Antonio Barrera (nicknamed &quot;The Baby Faced Assassin&quot;) and Erik &quot;El Terrible&quot; Morales.

==Fight history==

===Background===
Barrera had been the WBO super bantamweight champion in the mid 1990s. Morales, from his part, was undefeated and he had won the WBC super bantamweight title, knocking out Daniel Zaragoza (being the first person to do so) in eleven rounds in 1997. Promoters soon began arrangements for a bout between the WBC and WBO super bantamweight title holders.

===First bout===

The first bout took place on February 19, 2000, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, in Las Vegas and was televised on HBO Boxing. Morales was declared winner by split decision, with scores of 115-112, 114-113 and 113-114 and captured the WBO Super Bantamweight title. Many believed that Barrera deserved the decision. This bout was named as Ring Magazine&#x27;s Fight of the Year for 2000, before being named as the best fight of all time in the same year.

===Second bout===

The second bout took place on June 22, 2002, in MGM Grand Garden Arena, Las Vegas. After the impact their first fight had on many of those that saw it, their second fight was made a Pay Per View event.

This is often described as the most tactical fight of the trilogy. Nevertheless, there were plenty of punches, but with Barrera fighting a more technical approach, Morales opted to use heavier punches, dropping Barrera to the canvas in the 7th with a blow to the abdomen, which was subsequently ruled a trip by referee Jay Nady. Barrera was nonetheless declared the winner by unanimous decision, with scores of 116-112 and 115-113 and captured the WBC Featherweight title. Many believed that Morales deserved the decision.

===Third bout===

The third and final bout of the trilogy was fought at the Super Featherweight division. Morales had gone on to win the WBC title in that division after defeating Jesús Chávez and Barrera had lost recognition as world boxing champion after being defeated by Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao, so he moved up to the Super Featherweight division. The fight took place on November 27, 2004, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Barrera was declared the winner and new WBC Super Featherweight champion by majority decision, with scores of 115-113, 115-114, and 114-114. This bout was named Ring Magazine&#x27;s Fight of the Year for 2004.

===Afterwards===
Barrera and Morales later became friends. The two hosted a show on YouTube, named &quot;Un Round Mas&quot; (&quot;One More Round&quot;) where they spoke about boxing fights, entertainment, politics and other topics. However, the show was promptly cancelled and the two now claim to have only a professional relationship.

On late March of 2022, the podcast was restarted since then

<doc id="1255568" wikidata="Q217245" url="?curid=1255568" title="Kvarken">
<text>Kvarken ( (as opposed to South Kvarken); ) is the narrow region of the Gulf of Bothnia separating the Bothnian Bay (the inner part of the gulf) from the Bothnian Sea. The distance from the Swedish mainland to the Finnish mainland is around , while the distance between the outermost islands is only . The water depth in the Kvarken region is only around . The region also has an unusual rate of land rising at almost a year.

Several attempts to cross the strait swimming have been made, but cold water and currents have usually been insurmountable obstacles. The first successful crossing was carried out by Lennart Flygare, Pavio Grzelewski and Tore Klingberg, who on 24 July, 2018, swam from Valassaaret (Valsörarna) on the Finnish side to Holmöarna in Sweden. It took them 12 hours 2 minutes to cross the strait.

==Kvarken Archipelago==
On the Finnish side of Kvarken, there is a large archipelago, the Kvarken Archipelago, which includes the large islands Replot, Björkö and over 5,600 smaller islands. Most of it belongs to the municipality of Korsholm. Most of the small islands are inhabited. The archipelago is smaller on the Swedish side of the region, and the islands, part of Umeå Municipality, have much steeper shores. The Kvarken region was historically important also, because mail was delivered across Kvarken when the sea was completely frozen from the Swedish to the Finnish coast. This mail route was used frequently during the period when Finland was a part of Sweden.

During the Ice Ages, the Kvarken region was located underneath the Fennoscandian ice sheet. When the ice sheet retreated from the area around 9,600 years ago, the land, which had been compacted under the weight of the ice, rapidly expanded in a process known as isostatic rebound. The Kvarken region is known for having some of the fastest rates of this uplift on Earth, having risen 285 meters since glacial retreat. It continues to rise, demonstrating the effects of deglaciation on flat and shallow archipelagos. The Kvarken Archipelago is also notable for its unique moraine formations (called de Geer moraines), which form regular clusters that are parallel to the ice front. It is estimated that within about 2,000 years, the seafloor in this area will rise above water, splitting the Gulf of Bothnia into a southern gulf and northern lake.

In 2006, parts of the Kvarken Archipelago were added as an extension to the World Heritage Site of the High Coast (located on the western shore of the Gulf of Bothnia) in Sweden, because of its outstanding demonstration of isostatic uplift, and the influence of glacial retreat on the evolution of landforms and topography. The most Finnish parts of the High Coast/Kvarken Archipelago World Heritage Site are situated in the Korsholm municipality.

In the group of islands in the “middle” of the Kvarken region, in Swedish called Valsörarna – Finnish &quot;Valassaaret&quot;, is a lighthouse designed by who worked for Gustave Eiffel&#x27;s engineering bureau. The structural similarity between the lighthouse (built in 1885) and the Eiffel Tower (built in 1889) is quite obvious. The lighthouse is now automated as are most lighthouses in Finland.

== Transportation ==
The ferry route between Umeå and Vaasa connects Sweden and Finland at the narrowest part of the Gulf of Bothnia. The route is currently operated by Wasaline.

==Bridge==

There have been proposals for a bridge across the strait, at a cost of about 1.5 to 2 billion euros. There are islands in the strait, and the sum of the lengths of the probably three bridge parts would be about . The Swedish minister of finance has said it is an interesting idea, but the idea is still decades from being brought to fruition. There is a debate in the coastal cities on both sides, like Umeå and Vaasa. The official view from the Swedish and Finnish governments is that it is much too expensive, also put in regard that the cities are very small by European standards, as compared to Copenhagen and Malmö between the Oresund fixed link. The natural values of the area also make a bridge dubious.

<doc id="1255570" wikidata="Q1072476" url="?curid=1255570" title="Bending">
<text>In applied mechanics, bending (also known as flexure) characterizes the behavior of a slender structural element subjected to an external load applied perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of the element.

The structural element is assumed to be such that at least one of its dimensions is a small fraction, typically 1/10 or less, of the other two. When the length is considerably longer than the width and the thickness, the element is called a beam. For example, a closet rod sagging under the weight of clothes on clothes hangers is an example of a beam experiencing bending. On the other hand, a is a structure of any geometric form where the length and the width are of the same order of magnitude but the thickness of the structure (known as the &#x27;wall&#x27;) is considerably smaller. A large diameter, but thin-walled, short tube supported at its ends and loaded laterally is an example of a shell experiencing bending.

In the absence of a qualifier, the term &quot;bending&quot; is ambiguous because bending can occur locally in all objects. Therefore, to make the usage of the term more precise, engineers refer to a specific object such as; the &quot;bending of rods&quot;, the &quot;bending of beams&quot;, the &quot;bending of plates&quot;, the &quot;bending of shells&quot; and so on.

== Quasi-static bending of beams ==
A beam deforms and stresses develop inside it when a transverse load is applied on it. In the quasi-static case, the amount of bending deflection and the stresses that develop are assumed not to change over time. In a horizontal beam supported at the ends and loaded downwards in the middle, the material at the over-side of the beam is compressed while the material at the underside is stretched. There are two forms of internal stresses caused by lateral loads:
* Shear stress parallel to the lateral loading plus complementary shear stress on planes perpendicular to the load direction;
* Direct compressive stress in the upper region of the beam, applicable mostly to cement concreted elements and,
* Direct tensile stress, applicable to steel elements, and is at the lower region of the beam.

These last two forces form a couple or moment as they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This bending moment resists the sagging deformation characteristic of a beam experiencing bending. The stress distribution in a beam can be predicted quite accurately when some simplifying assumptions are used.

=== Euler–Bernoulli bending theory ===


In the Euler–Bernoulli theory of slender beams, a major assumption is that &#x27;plane sections remain plane&#x27;. In other words, any deformation due to shear across the section is not accounted for (no shear deformation). Also, this linear distribution is only applicable if the maximum stress is less than the yield stress of the material. For stresses that exceed yield, refer to article plastic bending. At yield, the maximum stress experienced in the section (at the furthest points from the neutral axis of the beam) is defined as the flexural strength.

Consider beams where the following are true: 
* The beam is originally straight and slender, and any taper is slight
* The material is isotropic (or orthotropic), linear elastic, and homogeneous across any cross section (but not necessarily along its length)
* Only small deflections are considered

In this case, the equation describing beam deflection (formula_1) can be approximated as:
:formula_2

where the second derivative of its deflected shape with respect to formula_3 is interpreted as its curvature, formula_4 is the Young&#x27;s modulus, formula_5 is the area moment of inertia of the cross-section, and formula_6 is the internal bending moment in the beam.

If, in addition, the beam is homogeneous along its length as well, and not tapered (i.e. constant cross section), and deflects under an applied transverse load formula_7, it can be shown that:
:formula_8
This is the Euler–Bernoulli equation for beam bending.

After a solution for the displacement of the beam has been obtained, the bending moment (formula_6) and shear force (formula_10) in the beam can be calculated using the relations
:formula_11

Simple beam bending is often analyzed with the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation. The conditions for using simple bending theory are:
# The beam is subject to pure bending. This means that the shear force is zero, and that no torsional or axial loads are present.
# The material is isotropic (or orthotropic) and homogeneous.
# The material obeys Hooke&#x27;s law (it is linearly elastic and will not deform plastically).
# The beam is initially straight with a cross section that is constant throughout the beam length.
# The beam has an axis of symmetry in the plane of bending.
# The proportions of the beam are such that it would fail by bending rather than by crushing, wrinkling or sideways buckling.
# Cross-sections of the beam remain plane during bending.
Compressive and tensile forces develop in the direction of the beam axis under bending loads. These forces induce stresses on the beam. The maximum compressive stress is found at the uppermost edge of the beam while the maximum tensile stress is located at the lower edge of the beam. Since the stresses between these two opposing vary linearly, there therefore exists a point on the linear path between them where there is no bending stress. The locus of these points is the neutral axis. Because of this area with no stress and the adjacent areas with low stress, using uniform cross section beams in bending is not a particularly efficient means of supporting a load as it does not use the full capacity of the beam until it is on the brink of collapse. Wide-flange beams (-beams) and truss girders effectively address this inefficiency as they minimize the amount of material in this under-stressed region.

The classic formula for determining the bending stress in a beam under simple bending is:
:formula_12
where
*formula_13 is the bending stress
*formula_14 – the moment about the neutral axis
*formula_15 – the perpendicular distance to the neutral axis
*formula_16 – the second moment of area about the neutral axis &quot;z&quot;.
*formula_17 - the Resistance Moment about the neutral axis &quot;z&quot;. formula_18

===Extensions of Euler-Bernoulli beam bending theory===

==== Plastic bending ====

The equation formula_19 is valid only when the stress at the extreme fiber (i.e., the portion of the beam farthest from the neutral axis) is below the yield stress of the material from which it is constructed. At higher loadings the stress distribution becomes non-linear, and ductile materials will eventually enter a &quot;plastic hinge&quot; state where the magnitude of the stress is equal to the yield stress everywhere in the beam, with a discontinuity at the neutral axis where the stress changes from tensile to compressive. This plastic hinge state is typically used as a limit state in the design of steel structures.

====Complex or asymmetrical bending====
The equation above is only valid if the cross-section is symmetrical. For homogeneous beams with asymmetrical sections, the maximum bending stress in the beam is given by

: formula_20

where formula_21 are the coordinates of a point on the cross section at which the stress is to be determined as shown to the right, formula_22 and formula_14 are the bending moments about the y and z centroid axes, formula_24 and formula_16 are the second moments of area (distinct from moments of inertia) about the y and z axes, and formula_26 is the product of moments of area. Using this equation it is possible to calculate the bending stress at any point on the beam cross section regardless of moment orientation or cross-sectional shape. Note that formula_27 do not change from one point to another on the cross section.

====Large bending deformation====

For large deformations of the body, the stress in the cross-section is calculated using an extended version of this formula. First the following assumptions must be made:

# Assumption of flat sections – before and after deformation the considered section of body remains flat (i.e., is not swirled).
# Shear and normal stresses in this section that are perpendicular to the normal vector of cross section have no influence on normal stresses that are parallel to this section.

Large bending considerations should be implemented when the bending radius formula_28 is smaller than ten section heights h:

:formula_29

With those assumptions the stress in large bending is calculated as:

:formula_30

where
:formula_31 is the normal force
:formula_32 is the section area
:formula_6 is the bending moment
:formula_28 is the local bending radius (the radius of bending at the current section)
:formula_35
The general solution of the above equation is
:formula_36
where formula_37 are constants and
formula_38
=== Timoshenko–Rayleigh theory ===

In 1877, Rayleigh proposed an improvement to the dynamic Euler–Bernoulli beam theory by including the effect of rotational inertia of the cross-section of the beam. Timoshenko improved upon that theory in 1922 by adding the effect of shear into the beam equation. Shear deformations of the normal to the mid-surface of the beam are allowed in the Timoshenko–Rayleigh theory.

The equation for the bending of a linear elastic, isotropic, homogeneous beam of constant cross-section under these assumptions is

: formula_39

where formula_40 is the polar moment of inertia of the cross-section, formula_41 is the mass per unit length of the beam, formula_28 is the density of the beam, formula_32 is the cross-sectional area, formula_44 is the shear modulus, and formula_45 is a shear correction factor. For materials with Poisson&#x27;s ratios (formula_46) close to 0.3, the shear correction factor are approximately
:formula_47

==== Free vibrations ====
For free, harmonic vibrations the Timoshenko–Rayleigh equations take the form
:formula_48
This equation can be solved by noting that all the derivatives of formula_1 must have the same form to cancel out and hence as solution of the form formula_50 may be expected. This observation leads to the characteristic equation
:formula_51
The solutions of this quartic equation are
:formula_52
where
:formula_53
The general solution of the Timoshenko-Rayleigh beam equation for free vibrations can then be written as
:formula_54

== Quasistatic bending of plates ==

The defining feature of beams is that one of the dimensions is much &quot;larger&quot; than the other two. A structure is called a plate when it is flat and one of its dimensions is much &quot;smaller&quot; than the other two. There are several theories that attempt to describe the deformation and stress in a plate under applied loads two of which have been used widely. These are
* the Kirchhoff–Love theory of plates (also called classical plate theory)
* the Mindlin–Reissner plate theory (also called the first-order shear theory of plates)

=== Kirchhoff–Love theory of plates ===
The assumptions of Kirchhoff–Love theory are
* straight lines normal to the mid-surface remain straight after deformation
* straight lines normal to the mid-surface remain normal to the mid-surface after deformation
* the thickness of the plate does not change during a deformation.

These assumptions imply that
:formula_55
where formula_56 is the displacement of a point in the plate and formula_57 is the displacement of the mid-surface.

The strain-displacement relations are
:formula_58

The equilibrium equations are
:formula_59
where formula_7 is an applied load normal to the surface of the plate.

In terms of displacements, the equilibrium equations for an isotropic, linear elastic plate in the absence of external load can be written as
:formula_61
In direct tensor notation,
:formula_62

=== Mindlin–Reissner theory of plates ===
The special assumption of this theory is that normals to the mid-surface remain straight and inextensible but not necessarily normal to the mid-surface after deformation. The displacements of the plate are given by
:formula_63
where formula_64 are the rotations of the normal.

The strain-displacement relations that result from these assumptions are
:formula_65
where formula_66 is a shear correction factor.

The equilibrium equations are
:formula_67
where
:formula_68

== Dynamic bending of plates ==
=== Dynamics of thin Kirchhoff plates ===
The dynamic theory of plates determines the propagation of waves in the plates, and the study of standing waves and vibration modes. The equations that govern the dynamic bending of Kirchhoff plates are
:formula_69
where, for a plate with density formula_70,
:formula_71
and 
:formula_72

The figures below show some vibrational modes of a circular plate.

<text>Dappled Cities (formerly &quot;Dappled Cities Fly&quot;) are an indie rock band from Sydney, Australia.

==History==
===1997–2003===
The band came together as teenagers in the northern suburbs of Sydney in 1997. Dave Rennick and original drummer Hugh Boyce were joined by Alex Moore on bass and Tim Derricourt on guitar. Keyboards were added occasionally by Mark Bradshaw, and after 2006 more regularly by Ned Cooke.

The band started out playing at all-ages shows and charity benefits before they reached legal age to play in the licensed venues in the Sydney CBD. They performed at the Hopetoun Hotel (now defunct), the Excelsior and The Bat and Ball. The band members moved to the inner suburbs of Sydney and after various name changes settled on Dappled Cities Fly.

The band made several tours of Australia and also toured New Zealand in 2004. In 2006 Dappled Cities Fly performed in London, England and at shows in the United States, including South by Southwest, where they played again in 2009 and 2010. From 2006 to 2009, the band did a number of tours of America and Canada, including performances at the Crocodile Club in Seattle, Mercury Lounge in New York and the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

===2004–present: Recording career===
Dappled Cities Fly&#x27;s first album, &quot;A Smile&quot;, was released in late 2004 and was featured as album of the week on radio stations FBi and Triple J. and reviewed favourably in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

In 2006, Dappled Cities released their second album, &quot;Granddance&quot;, recorded at Sunset Sounds and Senora Studios in Los Angeles. The album&#x27;s cover artwork has the band&#x27;s name as Dappled Cities, without the word &quot;Fly&quot;; while this was done for artistic reasons at the time, by 2009 the band were calling themselves simply Dappled Cities. In 2007 the band toured with Sydney band Red Riders, and later recorded and released a cover version of &quot;November Rain&quot; with them. In February 2008 Boyce left the band, and was replaced later that year by drummer Allan Kumpulainen.

Dappled Cities&#x27; third album, &quot;Zounds&quot;, was released in Australia in 2009 and in the United States in early 2010. The album received many positive reviews. Pitchfork gave the band 7.8 and noted that &quot;Dappled Cities haven&#x27;t quite acquired a big reputation outside their homeland yet, but it seems likely they will&quot;. The band toured during this period in New York and London while also doing a number of tours around Australia to positive reviews.

The band recorded their fourth album, &quot;Lake Air&quot;, throughout September 2011 at Megaphon Studios in St Peters, following recording sessions in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The recording was done with the assistance of Jarrad Kritzstein and the album released in July 2012.

In 2013, the band collaborated with the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra and members of the Australian Chamber Orchestra for &quot;The Future is Baroque&quot;, a Sydney Festival exclusive event pairing Dappled Cities&#x27; music with Baroque instrumentation. The band played as the supporting act at Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s &quot;Codes and Keys&quot; tour at the Palace Theatre in Melbourne, Australia.

The band returned from hibernation to play a sold-out show at Sydney&#x27;s Newtown Social Club on 5 February 2016. The show featured a number of new songs from the band&#x27;s upcoming fifth album, &quot;|||||&quot; (pronounced &quot;five&quot;). In May that year they released a new single, &quot;That Sound&quot;. In early 2017 the second single, &quot;Stone Men&quot;, was released along with an accompanying music video. &quot;|||||&quot; itself was released on 5 May 2017, the date intentionally mirroring the album title. The title was chosen to reflect the fact that the band had made five albums, had five members and had not put out an album in five years. &quot;|||||&quot; was properly launched with a show at the City Recital Hall in Sydney. At the show, it was announced that bassist Alex Moore would be leaving the band. He was later replaced by Mark Harding.

Following another five-year hiatus, the band released a three-track EP entitled &quot;Be Here&quot; in late 2022, followed by a live performance in Sydney, Australia in January 2023.

<doc id="1255594" wikidata="Q1668699" url="?curid=1255594" title="Pat Wilson">
<text>Patricia Mary Wilson (née Higgins; born 11 June 1948) is an Australian singer and journalist. Wilson wrote for &quot;Go-Set&quot;, a 1960s and 1970s pop music newspaper, under the pen-name &quot;Mummy Cool&quot; during 1971–1972. Wilson released several singles in the early 1980s including the hit single &quot;Bop Girl&quot;. The song was written by her then husband Ross Wilson of the bands Daddy Cool and Mondo Rock. Pat currently resides in the Melbourne suburb of Elwood.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Little is known about Wilson&#x27;s early years.

She first saw Ross Wilson perform with his band The Pink Finks in about 1965, when she was sixteen. They met when he was working for the Department of Supply. In 1969, Ross left Australia for England to become a member of Procession. Wilson joined him there; they married and returned to Australia.

Ross and three bandmates formed Daddy Cool in 1970 and toured Australia. In early 1971 they performed at the Myponga Festival in South Australia. Concert footage of their performance of &quot;Eagle Rock&quot; shows a pregnant Wilson in the front row (from 1m.43sec, right hand side of the screen). Both Pat (visibly pregnant) and Ross also appear in Chris Löfvén&#x27;s short film &quot;Part Two - The Beginning&quot;. The Wilsons&#x27; son Daniel was born just as &quot;Eagle Rock&quot; reached No. 1 on the National singles charts. At about this time, Wilson started writing her column for &quot;Go-Set&quot; taking over an advice column called &quot;Dear Lesley Pixie&quot; and using the pen-name &quot;Mummy Cool&quot;. She also appeared in a documentary about the band, singing with Rock Granite and the Profiles, a group which featured future members of Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons.

In 1975 Wilson appeared on Australian band Skyhooks&#x27; second album &quot;Ego is not a Dirty Word&quot; playing finger cymbals on the title track, &quot;Ego is not a Dirty Word&quot;. Ross produced the album.

===&quot;Bop Girl&quot;===

In September 1983, Wilson released &quot;Bop Girl&quot;, a song written by Ross which peaked at number 2 in Australia; and achieved airplay in the United States, where it peaked at No. 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart. Ross also provided backing vocals and appeared in its music video.

Eric McCusker of Mondo Rock, when interviewed in &quot;Juke Magazine&quot; in 1983, was asked whether he could have written something like &quot;Bop Girl&quot;, he replied:

:&quot;No, that&#x27;s a very Ross Wilson song isn&#x27;t it? That&#x27;s been around for about four years. I think Ross did a demo with some guys from the first Mondo line up and we all liked the song but it was obvious it wasn&#x27;t a Mondo Rock sound. But that&#x27;s what I say about doing other things aside from Mondo Rock: it&#x27;s healthy and you don&#x27;t feel restricted as a result.&quot;

A single &quot;Strong Love&quot; was released in May 1984 and peaked at number 26. This was following by the 5-track mini-album &quot;Strong Love&quot;. This mini-album was issued in the US as &quot;Bop Girl&quot;.

===Personal life===
Wilson was married to musician Ross Wilson for 20 years, according to her account on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Talking Heads&quot; on 9 July 2007, where Peter Thompson interviewed Ross. They have a son, Daniel, born in 1971.

<text>Flo is an American sitcom television series and a spin-off of &quot;Alice&quot; that aired on CBS from March 24, 1980, to June 30, 1981. The series starred Polly Holliday reprising her role as sassy and street-smart waitress Florence Jean &quot;Flo&quot; Castleberry who returns to her hometown of Fort Worth, Texas—referred to as &quot;Cowtown&quot;—and becomes the proprietor of a rundown old roadhouse that she renames &quot;Flo&#x27;s Yellow Rose&quot;. Although the series started strong—in the Top 10 during its short first season run—repeated timeslot changes resulted in it falling out of the Top 40 shows by mid-March 1981. It was subsequently not renewed when CBS announced its 1981 fall lineup at the May upfronts.

==Synopsis==
After several years as a waitress at Mel&#x27;s Diner in Phoenix, Flo is on her way to a new restaurant hostess job in Houston, Texas, as described in her final appearance on &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Flo&#x27;s Farewell&quot; (season 4, episode 18). She stops to visit her family in her hometown of Cowtown, Texas, (Cowtown is the popular nickname of Fort Worth) and in a fit of nostalgia, Flo buys a rundown old roadhouse she had enjoyed in her formative years and renames it &quot;Flo&#x27;s Yellow Rose&quot;. Coping with chauvinistic bartender Earl (Geoffrey Lewis) and the greedy and obnoxious banker Farley (Jim B. Baker) who holds the mortgage, as well as her mother Velma (Sudie Bond) and straight-laced sister Fran (Lucy Lee Flippin), causes most of the conflict in the series.

The rest of Flo&#x27;s staff at the Yellow Rose includes her childhood best friend Miriam (Joyce Bulifant) as waitress/bookkeeper, and chain-smoking piano player Les (Stephen Keep). Randy, the mechanic (Leo Burmester) who worked at the garage next door, and Chester (Mickey Jones), were regular customers. Vic Tayback made one guest appearance as Mel Sharples from &quot;Alice&quot;. Once &quot;Flo&quot; began, Polly Holliday never appeared again on &quot;Alice&quot;, except in flashback clips in the last episode.

==Cast==
* Polly Holliday as Florence Jean &quot;Flo&quot; Castleberry
* Geoffrey Lewis as Earl Tucker
* Jim B. Baker as Farley Waters
* Sudie Bond as Mama Velma Castleberry
* Leo Burmester as Randy Stumphill
* Joyce Bulifant as Miriam Willoughby
* Lucy Lee Flippin as Fran Castleberry
* Stephen Keep as Les Kincaid
* George Flower as Roy
* Mickey Jones as Chester
* Terry Willis as Wendell Tubbs (1980)

==Theme song==
The theme song, &quot;Flo&#x27;s Yellow Rose&quot;, written by Fred Werner and Susie Glickman, was sung by Hoyt Axton who would co-star with Holliday in the 1984 film &quot;Gremlins&quot;. Axton would later guest-star in the episode &quot;You Gotta Have Hoyt&quot;, as himself.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Flo&quot; was broadcast in these following timeslots during its two-season run on CBS:

*March 1980 – April 1980: Monday 9:30–10:00 p.m.
*July 1980 – January 1981: Monday 8:00–8:30 p.m.
*February 1981: Saturday 9:00–9:30 p.m.
*March 1981 – May 1981: Saturday 8:30–9:00 p.m.
*June 1981 – July 1981: Tuesday 8:30–9:00 p.m.

==Episodes==

===Season 1 (1980)===
===Season 2 (1980–81)===
==Ratings==
A cozy time slot following one of TV&#x27;s biggest hits (M.A.S.H) on CBS Monday night (@ 9:30 pm) helped make the brief first season (spring 1980) a ratings success. The series ended the year ranked at No. 7 and averaged 24.4 million viewers per episode. The second season (Fall 1981) brought a reversal in fortune when CBS decided to move the show to an earlier time on the same night (8 pm) and have it face off against NBC&#x27;s top 10 hit Little House on the Prairie and without the lead in support of M.A.S.H. a sharp decline in numbers followed. Which kicked off a few different time slot changes over the course of the season (none of which helped) and CBS opted not to renew the series for a third season.

==Award nominations==
*Nominated: 1980 Primetime Emmy Award – Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series (Polly Holliday)
*Nominated: 1981 Golden Globe Award – Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series – Comedy or Musical (Polly Holliday)
*Nominated: 1981 Golden Globe Award – Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television (Geoffrey Lewis)

==Home media release==
On November 5, 2013, &quot;Flo: The Complete Series&quot; was released on DVD in Region 1 by Warner Home Video via their Warner Archive Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release available via WBShop.com &amp; Amazon.com.

==Book==
A book chronicling the development of the TV series &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Flo&quot; entitled &quot;Alice: Life Behind the Counter in Mel&#x27;s Greasy Spoon (A Guide to the Feature Film, the TV Series, and More)&quot; was published by BearManor Media in September 2019.
&quot;Flo&quot; was also considered in the book &quot;Single Season Sitcoms of the 1980s&quot; by Bob Leszczak, published by McFarland in 2016.

<text>St Mark&#x27;s Church School is an independent Anglican co-educational school in Wellington, New Zealand for children aged from two (Early Childhood) to Year 8. The school is often seen on cricket match broadcasts from Basin Reserve. To its front is the modern, 1970s-era church building, the parish church to which the school is attached. A wooden church stood in its place prior to the 1970s redevelopment.

Its first principal was Miss Annie Holm, who served the school until the 1940s, aided by her sister. The school&#x27;s library is named after her. The Rev Ronald Kirby was another long-serving and influential principal, from 1971 to his death in 1982; the school&#x27;s main block is named in his honour. The vicar of St. Mark&#x27;s Church, Rev. Matthew Calder, taught Religious Education for all that time, and presided over Rev. Kirby&#x27;s funeral; another block is named the Calder Block for him.

<text>Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov (; 29 May 1910 – 15 March 1972) was a Socialist realism painter in the post-war Soviet Union. His meticulous and almost photo-real style was popular, but courted controversy among art critics and other artists.

Laktionov was born in Rostov-on-Don and studied in the Leningrad Academy of Arts from 1926 to 1929 and later as a postgraduate from 1938 to 1944. Laktionov was a pupil of the artist Isaak Brodsky and was influenced by his technical and realistic approach, which followed the traditions of the Old Masters.
Laktionov&#x27;s breakthrough work was &quot;A Letter From the Front&quot; (1947), which captured the prevailing mood among the people of the Soviet Union following the German-Soviet War. It is a highly optimistic work, bathed in a warm glow, which became a motif of Laktionov&#x27;s later works and Socialist realism in general.

Laktionov became most famous for his genre paintings such as &quot;Into a New Flat&quot; (1952) and &quot;Old Age Provided For&quot; (1958–60). These painstakingly realistic works paint an overwhelmingly positive picture of Soviet society. Nonetheless, these paintings proved popular among the general public, despite their mixed critical reception. This criticism was leveled mainly at Laktionov&#x27;s trademark attention to detail that, they claimed, eschews artistic expression in favor of naturalism.

In spite of this, Laktionov found many supporters in the state cultural bureaucracy, who approved of his nationalistic and optimistic subject matter. This ensured that Laktionov was able to lead a highly successful career and mix in the highest echelons of Soviet society. Throughout his later years he was commissioned to paint numerous portraits of leading Soviet actors, surgeons, soldiers, politicians and cosmonauts, including a portrait of Joseph Stalin.

<doc id="1255619" wikidata="Q2270701" url="?curid=1255619" title="Wilsdruff transmitter">
<text>The transmitter Wilsdruff was a medium wave radio broadcasting facility near Wilsdruff, Germany. Until the 1990s there was a transmitter for 1044 kHz with 250 kilowatts transmission power. This was a 153-metre guyed steel tube mast, insulated with respect to ground. Since the mid nineties transmission power was only 20 kilowatts. The new transmitter is in a circular building on which the mast stands. The old transmitter of the fifties is a technical monument. The whole facility is a relic from the Joseph Stalin era with a high fence (double fence with dog track and watchtowers) which is still almost complete.

Diesel engines are employed for an emergency power supply, modified from World War II submarine engines. The program &quot;MDR info&quot; transmitted from here on 1044 kHz until 2013. From 2001 to 2003 a second transmitter for MEGARADIO on 1431 kHz was operated. This also used the steel tube mast as its transmitter.

After its shutdown in 2013, the mast was torn down on August 1, 2021.

<doc id="1255620" wikidata="Q936648" url="?curid=1255620" title="Diarchy">
<text>Diarchy (from Greek , &quot;di-&quot;, &quot;double&quot;, and , &quot;-arkhía&quot;, &quot;ruled&quot;), duarchy, or duumvirate is a form of government characterized by co-rule, with two people ruling a polity together either lawfully or &quot;de facto&quot;, by collusion and force. The leaders of such a system are usually known as corulers.

Historically, &quot;diarchy&quot; particularly referred to the system of shared rule in British India established by the Government of India Acts 1919 and 1935, which devolved some powers to local councils, which had included native Indian representation under the Indian Councils Act 1892. &#x27;Duumvirate&#x27; principally referred to the offices of the various duumviri established by the Roman Republic. Both, along with less common synonyms such as biarchy and tandemocracy, are now used more generally to refer to any system of joint rule or office. A monarchy temporarily controlled by two or more people is, however, usually distinguished as a coregency.

Corule is one of the oldest forms of government. Historical examples include the Pandyan dynasty of Tamilakam, Sparta&#x27;s joint kingship, the Roman Republic&#x27;s consuls, Carthage&#x27;s Judges, and several ancient Polynesian societies. Systems of inheritance that often led to corule in Germanic and Dacian monarchies may be included as well, as may the dual occupants of the imperial title of the Inca Empire, or its system of succession.

Modern examples of diarchies are Andorra, whose princes are the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia; Nicaragua, which has been led by two co-presidents since a constitutional amendment in 2025; and San Marino, which is led by two Captains Regent.

==Formal use==
=== Current diarchies ===
==== Andorra ====
Andorra is a parliamentary co-principality. Its princes are (&quot;ex officio&quot;) the French president and the bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain. Since 1962, the French president has been elected by universal suffrage within France. The bishop of the diocese of Urgell is appointed by the Roman Catholic pope.

==== Bhutan ====
The 2008 Constitution affirms Bhutan&#x27;s commitment to a traditional dual government sharing power between the Druk Gyalpo (&quot;King&quot;) and the Buddhist religious authorities led by the Je Khenpo. In practice, however, the religious leaders function more as advisors to the kings than as corulers. Both arms of the traditional dual government are in practice less important than the Parliament and (single) Prime Minister.

====Nicaragua====
In 2025, during the presidency of Daniel Ortega, the National Assembly approved multiple amendments to the Constitution of Nicaragua that included proclaiming Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, as co-presidents.

====Northern Ireland====
Under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement intended to end conflict in Northern Ireland, the First Minister and deputy First Minister serve as joint heads of the area&#x27;s executive. Both positions exercise identical executive powers; however they are not heads of state.

==== San Marino ====
The captains regent () of San Marino are elected every six months by the Sammarinese parliament, the Grand and General Council. They serve as joint heads of state, and are normally chosen from opposing parties.

===Historical diarchies===
====Sparta====


The office of king in ancient Sparta was divided between two kings from separate dynasties, each holding a veto over the other&#x27;s actions. However, the Spartan kings&#x27; powers and duties consisted mainly of leading the Spartan army on campaign (during which only one king would usually lead a given force) and certain religious functions, as well as having ex-officio seats in the Gerousia (Senate). Actual day-to-day public administration in Sparta was managed by the ephors.

====Roman Republic====
Following the overthrow of the Roman monarchy, the Romans established an oligarchic Roman Republic which divided supreme executive power () between two consuls, both elected each year and each holding a veto over the other&#x27;s actions.

The historical duumviri were not rulers but magistrates, performing various judicial, religious, or public functions.

====Kartli====
According to Conversion of Kartli, Leonti Mroveli, Vakhushti Bagrationi, Teimuraz Bagrationi and Pavle Ingorokva, there existed a dual power (Diarchy) in Kartli at the time of the kings mentioned below.
#&lt;li value=&quot;11&quot;&gt; Bartom II and Kʽartʽam
# Pʽarsman I and Kaos
# Azork and Armazel
# Amazasp I and Derok
# Pʽarsman II and Mirdat I
According to Cyril Toumanoff, the diarchs of Kartli in 370-378 were Sauromaces II and Mihrdat III.

====Hungary====
The Hungarians originally possessed a system of dual kingship, with religious authority vested in the kende and military authority vested in the war-chief (&quot;&quot;). It is believed that when the kende Kurszán was killed a little after the arrival of the Hungarians in Pannonia, his role was usurped by the war-chief Árpád, establishing the Hungarian monarchy. It is not known with certainty whether Árpád was originally the kende or the gyula.

====Afghanistan====
The Ghurid Empire was an established diarchy between Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad and Muhammad of Ghor. The diarchy lasted from 1173 to 1203 until the death of Ghiyath al-Din, leaving his ruler, Muhammad sole ruler of the Ghurid empire.

====Japan====
During Japan&#x27;s shogunate, the emperor was notionally a supreme spiritual and temporal lord who delegated authority for joint rule to the &quot;shōgun&quot;. In practice, the &quot;shōguns&quot;″ power was so complete that they are usually considered &quot;de facto&quot; monarchs rather than viceroys or corulers.

====Medieval Europe====
A paréage was a feudal treaty recognizing the &quot;equal footing&quot; () of two sovereigns over a territory. The most famous such arrangement was the 1278 treaty that established modern Andorra. Others include Maastricht, which was shared by the Duke of Brabant and the Prince-Bishop of Liège. After the establishment of the Dutch Republic, it became a condominium of Liège and the United Provinces, which administered it through the States General of the Netherlands until 1794.

====Tibet====
Between 1642 and 1751, political power in Tibet was shared between the 5th, 6th, and 7th Dalai Lamas who headed the realm&#x27;s Buddhist state religion and various secular rulers known as desis. The growing power of the desis caused the 7th Dalai Lama to abolish the post and replace it with a council known as the Kashag, permitting him to consolidate his authority over the realm. A similar system arose in Bhutan, with the Wangchuck governor (&quot;penlop&quot;) of Trongsa becoming the Druk Desi and Druk Gyalpo in 1907. In contrast to Tibet, the dynasty eventually consolidated its power and now rules as the kings of Bhutan.

====Russia====
From 1619-1633, Tsar Michael of Russia ruled along with his father, Patriarch Filaret of Moscow. Both were addressed as Velikiy Gosudar (Great Sovereign), held court together, and when they did not the ceremony was the same. While both were equal in theory, in practice Patriarch Filaret ruled, with Michael supporting whatever his father ordered.

Between the February Revolution in March 1917 and the October Revolution in November, political power in Russia was divided between the Russian Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet, a condition described by Vladimir Lenin as &quot;Dual Power&quot;. He elaborated the situation into a dual-power doctrine, whereby Communists collaborated with and then supplanted existing bourgeois forms of government.

==== England, Scotland and Ireland ====
Although the Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were monarchies, they became &quot;de facto&quot; diarchies in personal union during the co-rule of William II and III and Mary II. After the Glorious Revolution deposed James VII and II, his kingships were succeeded in 1689 by his daughter Mary and his son-in-law and nephew William, who jointly ruled England, Scotland and Ireland until Mary died in 1694, succeeded by William as the sole monarch.

==== Canada ====
The colonial Province of Canada was usually governed by two joint premiers from 1841 to 1867. Usually, one was chosen from the English-speaking Canada West and the other one from the French-speaking Canada East.

====India====
Named as the India Secretary for the Lloyd George ministry, Edwin Samuel Montagu made the &quot;Grand Declaration&quot; on 20 August 1917 that British policy would henceforth be &quot;increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions&quot;. Montagu and Viscount Chelmsford, the Governor-General of India, then made an extensive tour of the subcontinent in 1917 and 1918. The Montague–Chelmsford Report&#x27;s recommendations formed the basis for the Government of India Act 1919 that established &quot;diarchy&quot; in British India.

Under that act, the executive was to be headed by a governor appointed by the Secretary of State, who could consult the Governor General. The governor was responsible to the Secretary of State for acts of omission and commission. He was to maintain law and order in the province and ensure that the provincial administration worked smoothly. In respect of transferred subjects, he was to be assisted by his ministers whereas reserved subjects were to be administered by the Governor General and his executive council.

The members of the Executive Council were to be appointed by the Secretary of State and were responsible to him in all matters. There were certain matters that he was to administer at his own discretion, in which he was responsible to the Secretary of State. Each councillor was to remain in office for a period of four years. Their salaries and service conditions were not subject to the vote of provincial legislature. All decisions in the council were to be taken by a majority of votes, the Governor being able to break ties.

====Samoa====
During the establishment of the modern state of Samoa in 1962, power was shared between the two chiefs Malietoa Tanumafili II and Tupua Tamasese Meaʻole. Meaʻole died the next year, after which the country functioned as a monarchy until the death of Tanumafili and a republic thereafter.

==== Bolivia ====
Following a coup d&#x27;état in 1964, former Vice President René Barrientos rose to power as president of the military junta. The following year, faced with discontent from loyalists of General Alfredo Ovando Candía, Barrientos promulgated the co-presidency between himself and Ovando Candía. The pair ruled as dual presidents until 1966 when Barrientos resigned in order to run in that year&#x27;s general election.

==== Israel ====
After the 2019–2021 Israeli political crisis, the Israel&#x27;s Basic Law: The Government underwent a major change. A system of two prime ministers, appointed at the same time by the Knesset, was established. According to the new method, there was an Alternate Prime Minister of Israel in addition to the standard Prime Minister of Israel. After a half of the government&#x27;s term, the two prime ministers would change positions as part of a rotation government. During the term, the government&#x27;s roles and duties were divided between the two prime ministers, each one of them entitled to remove ministers without the other&#x27;s interference.

However, this system did not survive even until the first planned rotation and was abolished again after Benyamin Netanyahu&#x27;s victory at the end of 2022.

==Informal use==

===Bureaucracy===
Shared power arrangements within a modern bureaucracy may also be known as a &quot;diarchy&quot; or &quot;duumvirate&quot;. Examples include the joint authority of the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of the Department of Defence over the Australian Defence Organisation.

===Influential outsiders===
The status of monarchs is sometimes impugned by accusations of corule when an advisor, family member, lover, or friend appears to have taken too great a hand in government. Lü Buwei in Chinese history and François Leclerc du Tremblay in France are famous examples of &quot;éminences grises&quot; who controlled much of their countries&#x27; policies. In British history, George VI&#x27;s reign was mocked as a &quot;split-level matriarchy in pants&quot; owing to the supposed influence of his mother, Queen Mary and his wife Queen Elizabeth.

===Informally shared power===
Owing to Confucian notions of filial piety, Chinese and Japanese emperors were sometimes able to &#x27;retire&#x27; but continue to exert great influence over state policy. In Indonesia, Sukarno and his vice president Mohammad Hatta were nicknamed the Duumvirate (&quot;&quot;), with Sukarno setting government policy and rallying support and Hatta managing day-to-day administration. More recently, the great influence of Vladimir Putin over his successor Dmitry Medvedev was considered a duumvirate, or tandemocracy (see also Medvedev–Putin tandemocracy), until Putin&#x27;s resumption of the office of president established him as the greater figure.

Within electoral politics, governments, coalitions and parties may sometimes have two fairly equal leaders, as with:

* The temporary First Whitlam Ministry of 5–19 December 1972, composed of Gough Whitlam and Lance Barnard, which was nicknamed the &quot;duumvirate&quot;.
* Marama Davidson and James Shaw as joint leaders of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand.

===Religious leaders===
In addition to actual sharing of political power between religious and military leaders, as occurred in Tibet and Bhutan, the great soft power of a religious leader such as the Pope of the Catholic Church over a devout country can sometimes be described as a form of diarchy or corule.

===Traditional leaders===
The Kingdom of Eswatini is a diarchy in which the King (Ngwenyama) rules in conjunction with his mother, the queen mother (Ndlovukati) in their capacity as traditional rulers. Constitutionally, however, the King is the sole head of state, though it is often argued that the giving of authority wholesale to the royal male in this way is a neo-traditionalistic as opposed to truly traditional custom.

== In fiction ==
* In &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan, the fictional land of Barataria is ruled jointly for a while by two kings, who happen to be the gondoliers themselves.
* Umbar, in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, was ruled by a duumvirate. In its earliest years, Gondor was also ruled jointly by two kings, the two sons of Elendil. He himself was king of its sister realm Arnor, and served as high king over both realms.
* The Omaticaya, the Na&#x27;vi clan at the center of the film &quot;Avatar&quot;, are traditionally led by a pair of married tribal chiefs. One of them, the husband, oversees political and military matters while the other one, the wife, is in charge of spiritual and otherwise ceremonial affairs.
* The orbital colony New New York, in the &quot;Worlds&quot; trilogy by Joe Haldeman, is jointly governed by an elected Policy Coordinator and Engineering Coordinator.
* The Federated Commonwealths of America, in &quot;A Different Flesh&quot; by Harry Turtledove, is modelled heavily on the Roman Republic, governed by two chief executives styled as Censors (although the offices are more akin to the position of Consul). With each one being able to veto the actions of the other, the election of two politically-opposed Censors was intended as a check on executive power. Censors serve a single non-renewable five-year term and (alongside commonwealth governors) become life-long-serving members of the Senate upon leaving office.
* In &quot;Avenue 5&quot;, it is suggested that the Office of President of the United States became a duumvirate comprising a human and an artificial intelligence (reminiscent of a virtual assistant).
* In &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic&quot;, the nation of Equestria where most of the series takes place is shown to be a diarchy. While the older Princess Celestia is depicted as ruling on her own in the first season of the series, she is later joined by her younger sister Princess Luna as a co-ruler.
* By the end of &quot;Legend of Korra&quot;, the Northern Water Tribe becomes a diarchy, ruled by the twins Desna and Eska, cousins to the title character.
* The city of Uthodurn, featured in &quot;Critical Role&quot;, is lorded over by a dual monarchy made up of a dwarven queen and an elven king, referred to as the Diarchy of Uthodurn.

== See also ==
* Directorial system
* Monarchy, rule by a single person
* Coregency, temporary rule over a monarchy by two or more people
* Triumvirate, joint rule by three people
* Tetrarchy, joint rule by four people
* Decemviri, joint rule by ten people
* Condominium (international law)

<text>Georg Mehlis (8 March 1878 in Hanover – 13 November 1942 Freiburg im Breisgau) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. Initially he was a philosopher of history in the style of Heinrich Rickert.

He edited (with Richard Kroner) &quot;Logos, Internationale Zeitschrift für Philosophie der Kultur&quot;, from 1910 (&quot;Logos&quot; was the title from 1912), with contributions by many leading German intellectual figures; which had an Italian stable-mate from 1914.

He turned in the 1920s to an interest in mysticism; and then wrote books on fascism. His ideas on aesthetics have been taken up by Suzanne Langer.

<text>Rear-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée (19 December 1761 – 18 February 1800) was a French Navy officer who served in the French Revolutionary Wars. 

==Career==
Born to a family of sailors in Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, Perrée started sailing in 1773 at the age of twelve as a boy on the merchantman &quot;Glorieuse&quot;, under his father. In the course of the following twenty years, he steadily rose in rank in the merchant navy, took part in a campaign on the fluyt &quot;Boulonnaise&quot; in the French Navy as an aid-pilot, and earned his commission of Sea captain in 1785.

=== Commerce raiding on &quot;Proserpine&quot; ===
In 1793, when France declared war on Britain during the War of the First Coalition, Perrée enlisted in the Navy as an acting Ensign. In September 1793, he was reported to be commanding a frigate squadron in the Western Mediterranean, fighting the inconclusive Action of 22 October 1793 against Captain Horatio Nelson.

Promoted to acting Lieutenant in May 1794, and took command of the frigate &quot;Proserpine&quot; in April 1794 to conduct Commerce raiding operations; in his eight-month campaign, he captured over 63 British merchantmen and a 32-gun Dutch States Navy frigate on 21 May.

On 13 September 1794, Perrée was Captain, and was appointed to command a naval division in the Mediterranean, comprising the frigate &quot;Alceste&quot;, under Lieutenant Lejoille, and the 18-gun brig &quot;Hazard&quot;, under Lieutenant Leduc. The division returned to Toulon on 10 October.

He set sail for another mission on 15 November, this time on &quot;Minerve&quot;, in consort with &quot;Alceste&quot; and the 20-gun corvette &quot;Brune&quot;, under Ensign Deniéport. The division cruised in the Mediterranean and sailed for a diplomatic mission to Tunis before returning to Toulon on 29 December.

On 4 February 1795, Perrée cruised again on &quot;Minerve&quot;, this time in consort with the frigate &quot;Sérieuse&quot;, under Lieutenant Saunier. The two frigates cruised in the Mediterranean together until &quot;Sérieuse&quot; detached to ferry funds to Algiers. &quot;Minerve&quot; returned to Toulon on 24 February, and &quot;Sérieuse&quot;, on 20 May.

In September 1795, was given command of a four-frigate and two-corvette squadron to prey on British shipping off the West African coast and raid their trading posts; during the campaign, he captured 54 merchantmen.

On 26 April 1796, Perrée departed with the Mediterranean squadron, commanding the brand-new frigate &quot;Diane&quot; and ferrying diplomats, supplies and ammunitions to Constantinople until 14 November.

In early 1797, Perrée took command of the naval division of the Adriatic Sea as a Rear-Admiral. The division comprised the frigate &quot;Diane&quot;, under Lieutenant Hubert; the corvette &quot;Brune&quot;, still under Deniéport, who was promoted to Commander; the gunboat &quot;Frimaire&quot;, under Ensign Suply; and the brig &quot;Jason&quot;, under Lieutenant Sénéquier.

In early 1799, Perrée commanded the naval station of the Syrian coasts, part of the Mediterranean squadron, with his flag on the frigate &quot;Junon&quot;.

=== Campaign in Egypt and the action of 18 June 1799 ===
In the Mediterranean squadron, Perrée took command of the 74-gun &quot;Mercure&quot;, but was replaced by Lieutenant Cambon after the landing of the troops.

With the rank of captain, Perrée acted as a chief of division during the French expedition to Egypt: General Bonaparte appointed him to the Nile flotilla, where he commanded a squadron of shebeks and other light craft. On 13 July, the flotilla fought against Egyptian fluvial ships and forts while supplying food and ammunition to the French Army, and Perrée managed to captured some of these ships and ward off the others. Wounded during the prelude of the Battle of Shubra Khit, Perée was promoted to Rear-admiral on the insistence of Bonaparte, and received a sabre of honour inscribed &quot;&quot;Bataille de Chabreis&quot; on one side of the blade, and &quot;Donné par le général Bonaparte&quot;&quot; on the other.

When the French campaign in the Middle East turned to Syria, Perrée took command of a squadron of three frigates and two brigs, survivors of the Battle of the Nile, to ferry supplies and artillery for the Army past Ottoman and British blockades. The squadron comprised the frigates &quot;Junon&quot; (Commander Pourquier), &quot;Courageuse&quot; (Captain Trullet) and &quot;Alceste&quot; (Captain Barré), and the brigs &quot;Salamine&quot; (Lieutenant Landry) and &quot;Alerte&quot; (Demay). Arrived at Jaffa, the frigates unloaded their cargo, and furthermore shared their own ammunition, leaving the frigates with only 15 shots per gun; Junon also landed four of her 18-pounder long guns.

The division then established a blockade to complete the Siege of Acre. On 14 May, it was chased by two enemy ships of the line and a frigate, under Sidney Smith, which it quickly eluded. In spite of specific orders to land in Europe only if he could not possibly do otherwise, Perrée conferred with his officers and decided that his low supplies made it necessary for him to return to Toulon, by way of Lampedusa, where he would replenish his water.

At 60 miles from Toulon, on 18 June 1799, Perrée&#x27;s division met a 30-ship fleet under Lord Keith; a 28-hour chase started and in the ensuing Action of 18 June 1799, all of Perrée&#x27;s ships were captured.

Perrée was taken prisoner and exchanged almost immediately. Court-martialled from 6 October to 25 November 1799 for the loss of his ships by a court presided by Vice-admiral Thévenard, the court found that the superior Ottoman and British forces off Syria, the partial disarmament of the frigates and their low food and water supplies had been legitimate reasons for Perrée to return to Toulon. Perrée was then honourably acquitted on a unanimous decision of the council.

=== Battle of the Malta Convoy ===
From 28 November, he took command of a naval division tasked to ferry food supplies from Toulon to Malta, with his flag on the 74-gun &quot;Généreux&quot;.

From 28 November, Perrée was appointed to command a small naval division tasked with supplying Malta. The division was composed of the 74-gun &quot;Généreux&quot; (under Captain Cyprien Renaudin) as flagship, the 20-gun corvettes &quot;Badine&quot; and &quot;Fauvette&quot;, the 16-gun &quot;Sans Pareille&quot; and the fluyt &quot;Ville de Marseille&quot; (under Joseph Allemand).

Perrée&#x27;s division departed on 26 January 1800, but soon after, &quot;Généreux&quot; broke her mizzen tops and her main topgallant off Hyères, and had to double back for repairs. The division set sail again on 10 February 1800 and arrived off La Valette only a week later, due to adverse weather. On 18, off Lampedusa, &quot;Généreux&quot; investigated a strange sail which turned out to be a British ship rejoining two sails on the horizon. Perrée ordered his squadron to flee, but &quot;Ville de Marseille&quot; was overhauled by the 74-gun HMS &quot;Alexander&quot; in the next morning, and struck her colours at 8:30.

The rest of the British squadron, comprising the 74-gun HMS &quot;Alexander&quot;, &quot;Northumberland&quot; and &quot;Foudroyant&quot;, and the 32-gun frigate HMS &quot;Success&quot;, part of Keith&#x27;s fleet blockading the Malta, continued the chase.

In the afternoon, Perrée spotted two further ships, HMS &quot;Audacious&quot; and &quot;Lion&quot;, in the North-North-West; he ordered his corvettes to adjust course, &quot;Sans-Pareille&quot; sustaining a broadsite from &quot;Alexander&quot; in the process, and gave liberty of maneuver to his captains. &quot;Généreux&quot; headed East, but found herself surrounded from all directions. Perrée had anchors, boats and forage supplies throwned overboard, but at 3:15, the frigate HMS &quot;Success&quot; audaciously intercepted and engaged the much more powerful &quot;Généreux&quot;, hoping to delay her enough for the British ships of the line to catch up. By 4:30, the British 74-guns had overhauled &quot;Généreux&quot; and were raking her.

A shot from the first broadside threw splinters into Perrée&#x27;s left eye, temporarily blinding him. Remaining on deck, he called to his crew &quot;Ce n&#x27;est rien, mes amis, continuons notre besogne&quot; (&quot;It is nothing, my friends, continue with your work&quot;) and gave orders for the ship to be turned, when a cannonball from the second broadside from &quot;Success&quot; tore his right leg off at the thigh. Perrée collapsed unconscious on the deck. &quot;Généreux&quot; continued to resist until 5:30, when, overpowered, she struck her colours.

Perrée died of his wounds in the evening. On Nelson&#x27;s orders, he was interred in Saint Lucy church in the Dominican convent of Syracuse.

<text>The Magdalena tinamou, &quot;Crypturellus erythropus saltuarius&quot;, is a member of one of the most ancient bird families, the tinamous. It is endemic to the Magdalena River Valley in Colombia, and had been considered possibly extinct, because of an absence of confirmed records since the type specimen was collected in 1943. The most recent review consider it likely that it is extant, as locals have reported sightings in the 1970s and 1980s, an individual was apparently held in captivity until the early 1990s, and a few patches of forest remain in its presumed range. Additionally, a record was made in late 2008. It was rediscovered in 2023.

It is sometimes treated as a distinct species, and sometimes as a subspecies of the red-legged tinamou. The SACC rejected a proposal to elevate it to species status, arguing that the presently available data fail to support the split. BirdLife International have followed this treatment; hence the Magdalena Tinamou was dropped from the 2008 IUCN Red List.

==Etymology==
&quot;Crypturellus&quot; is formed from three Latin or Greek words. &quot;kruptos&quot; meaning covered or hidden, &quot;oura&quot; meaning tail, and &quot;ellus&quot; meaning diminutive. Therefore &quot;Crypturellus&quot; means small hidden tail.

==Description==
The Magdalena tinamou is similar to red-legged tinamou. Its total length is approximately . It is a medium-sized, brown tinamou. Its upperparts are dark ruddy with black barring on rump, it has brown wings that have buff barring, it has paler underparts with dark barring on its lower flanks and vent, and its chin is white with a greyish tinge to its throat.

==Ecology==
The type specimen was taken in Ayacucho in the Cesar Department, and the only other known specimen (although its present whereabouts is unknown) was taken near Mariquita in the Tolima Department (often erroneously listed as being in the Neiva Department [&quot;sic&quot;]). Both are in the Magdalena River Valley of Colombia. This species has traditionally been considered to inhabit of dry deciduous forest and savanna, but the latter is now believed to be mistaken, and the classification of the forest as &quot;dry&quot; has perhaps been overstated. It may still survive in the few remnant foothill forests on the western slope of the Cordillera Oriental, and also on the eastern slope of the Serranía de San Lucas. The type specimen was taken at an altitude of about 150 m, while the second specimen was taken at an altitude of about 500 m.

==Status and conservation==
The Magdalena tinamou is probably threatened from hunting and deforestation. The habitat in which it is found has been heavily modified for agriculture. Large areas of the Magdalena River Valley had been converted to pasture or cultivated as early as the mid-18th century, and most of the remaining wet forest was cleared during a government-sponsored colonisation and infrastructure development programme in the 1960s and 1970s. Flat alluvial portions of the valley are now used for intensive rice and cotton production, while undulating terrain has been converted to pastureland. This left only approximately 1-2% of old secondary and primary forest. However, recent research collected information by local inhabitants suggesting that this bird still survives; tinamous are notoriously cryptic and not easily found. A recording was made near the type locality by Colombian ornithologist Oswaldo Cortés in late 2008. In addition to confirming the continued existence of the Magdalena tinamou, it is hoped the recording (the first of the Magdalena tinamou) can be used to better establish its taxonomic status (species or subspecies) through comparisons with recordings of other red-legged tinamou subspecies. The absence of data beyond plumage (e.g. vocal analysis) was the main arguments presented by the SACC in 2006 for not accepting the Magdalena tinamou as a separate species.

No conservation effort is currently underway. However, it was proposed to conduct ornithological surveys and interviews in San Calixto/Convención and the foothills on the western slope of the Cordillera Oriental above Pailitas, the eastern foothills of Serranía de San Lucas, and between Pailitas and La Jagua de Ibirico. It was also proposed to locate surviving forest patches using aerial photographs and assess the species&#x27;s taxonomic position.

As mentioned above, the Magdalena tinamou has been removed from the IUCN Red List, where now considered a subspecies of the widespread red-legged tinamou. The Magdalena tinamou was classified as Critically Endangered: D in the 2006 Red List, uplisted from Endangered in 1994.

<text>The Wachenbrunn transmitter was a large broadcasting facility for medium wave in Wachenbrunn near Themar, Thuringia, Germany, established in the 1950s. Until 1993 the main transmitter of this facility, the medium wave transmitter for 882 kHz was run with 250 kilowatts. In that year the transmission power of this transmitter, which was formerly used for transmitting the &quot;Voice of DDR&quot; and since the beginning of the 1990s for &quot;MDR info&quot; was reduced to 20 kilowatts.

==History==
Since 1988 the transmitter Wachenbrunn has also been the site of a medium wave transmitter of the Russian foreign radio service Voice of Russia (formerly Radio Moskau) on 1323 kHz. This transmitter is similar to the transmitter of &quot;MDR info&quot; run by Deutsche Telekom. In the afternoon and evening, a programme of the Voice of Russia was transmitted in German. With a power of 1000 kW, this transmitter was the third strongest in Germany. It used a directional aerial consisting of four 125.1 metre (407 feet) high guyed steeltube framework masts insulated against ground with triangular cross section. These masts, which were locally called the &quot;Russian Quartet&quot;, were located 800 metres (½ mile) away from the other parts of the facility, in order to avoid undesirable interference. For the transmission of the radio frequency power a cage line from the transmitter, which was located close to the transmitter of &quot;MDR info&quot; and the &quot;Russian Quartet&quot;, was used until the modernisation of the facility in 2002–2003. In the course of the modernization, a completely transistorized transmitter with a power of 1,000 kilowatts was installed in an old store building close to the &quot;Russian Quartet&quot;. Therefore, the cage line was for its greatest parts obsolete and therefore shortened. By shortening the transmission line and installation of the new transmitter the efficiency was increased to 84%. During the modernisation the masts of the &quot;Russian Quartet&quot;, which had until that point of time a grey colour, were painted red-white.

MDR Info transmissions from Wachenbrunn transmitter on 882 kHz ceased on 30 June 2011. An automated announcement notified listeners until 10:00 on 4 July 2011 of the closure. The 882 kHz transmitter was demolished on 14 July 2011.

The 1323 kHz transmitter used by the Voice of Russia and Universelles Leben was not affected by the closure, as it operated from a separate site located about 1 km from the first. However, the high power has been the cause of complaints from nearby residents about interference to electrical equipment.

Voice of Russia announced in December 2012 that they intended to cease medium wave transmissions from Germany for financial reasons from 1 January 2013. Besides Wachenbrunn, this also involved the transmitter sites in Cremlingen-Abbenrode and Wilsdruff. Wachenbrunn transmitter site was switched off as scheduled on 31 December 2012 at 23:00.

The remaining four transmitting masts were demolished on 19 September 2013 at 14:55, ending the existence of the transmitter site.

===Solar power plant===
On 12 March 2015 the construction of a solar power plant started on the location of the former 882 kHz transmitter site. On 13 May 2015 it was connected to the network.

==Facility==
As an aerial two guyed steel tube masts insulated against ground with heights of 142.8 metres (464 feet) were used. One of these masts had been a reflector mast at Berlin-Köpenick transmitter site until 1988, before it was dismantled and rebuilt at Wachenbrunn. This type of transmission aerial allowed a better radiation toward the south-west. Furthermore, until the mid-1990s there was a triangle area aerial and a small guyed mast, which was insulated to ground. Neither installation still exists.

<text>Blachernitissa (), also called Theotokos of Blachernae (Θεοτόκος των Βλαχερνών, Θεοτόκος η Βλαχερνίτισσα) or Our Lady of Blachernae (Παναγία η Βλαχερνίτισσα), is a 7th-century encaustic icon representing the &quot;Most Holy Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary&quot;. It is also the name given to the Church built in honour of the Virgin Mary in the Blachernae section of Constantinople. The name Blachernae possibly derived from the name of a Vlach (sometimes written as Blach or Blasi), who came to Constantinople from the lower Danube. 
== Byzantine palladium ==
The Theotokos was considered to be the intercessory protectress &quot;par excellence&quot; of Constantinople and, indeed, of the entire Eastern Roman Empire (called &quot;Byzantium&quot; by some modern Western scholars). &quot;Blachernitissa&quot; is unusual among Orthodox icons in that it is not flat, but is formed in bas relief. According to Sacred Tradition, the icon &quot;Blachernitissa&quot; was made of wax combined with the ashes of Christian martyrs who had been killed in the 6th century. The Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (which hosted the icon) was sited close to the Blachernae imperial palace.

== Reappearance ==
The icon was believed to have been lost after the fire that destroyed the church on February 29, 1434, although in later centuries its disappearance came to be associated with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Like many holy objects of Byzantine tradition, the Blachernitissa (or a copy thereof) resurfaced on Mount Athos in the mid-17th century.

Whether it is the same icon that was kept in Blachernae is a matter of scholarly debate, as the ancient icon is believed to have been of the Orans type, whereas the Athonite icon is of a style called &quot;Hodegetria&quot; (literally, &quot;She who leads the way&quot;). It has been suggested that the Athonite icon had its origins in the Blachernae quarter and perhaps even resided in the Church of St. Mary before being transferred to Mount Athos for &quot;security reasons&quot;. 
It was in 1653 that the icon was sent by the Athonite monks to Moscow as their gift to Tsar Alexis. A Constantinople merchant, Demetrios Costinari, brought it to Moscow on October 16, 1653, with a letter from Patriarch Paisius I that endorsed the icon&#x27;s authenticity. He was met by the Tsar in person, and Alexis had the icon enshrined in Moscow&#x27;s main church, the Dormition Cathedral, opposite Russia&#x27;s protectress, the Theotokos of Vladimir. 

== Veneration in Muscovy ==
Paul of Aleppo, who accompanied the Patriarch of Antioch to Moscow in early 1655, was impressed by the reverence in which the icon was held. According to his account, the Blachernitissa appears as &quot;if she had a bodily form&quot; and &quot;it stands out against the background so strongly&quot;, that the viewer is penetrated with awe. It was encased in a sumptuous chasuble glittering with gold and precious stones, so that only the hands and the face of the Theotokos were left visible. Paul proceeds to describe how the Tsar had it placed in front of his own seat in a sledge and took it with him on the Smolensk campaign.

The 1650s were a time when the Russian Church, steered by Patriarch Nikon, began to place great store on renewing its ties with the older members of the Pentarchy. This emphasis dovetailed neatly with the prevailing Third Rome doctrine which saw Moscow as the successor to Constantinople. With this in mind, the metochion sent the newly recovered Byzantine relic to Moscow and was &quot;handsomely remunerated&quot; with 800 dinars from the Tsar&#x27;s coffers.

== Study and restoration ==
When placed in the Kremlin, the icon was in disrepair from old age and use, so that Simon Ushakov and Nikita Pavlovets had to be summoned for &quot;repairs&quot; in 1674. Nikodim Kondakov was unable to determine the icon&#x27;s age due to this and later restorations, which involved some amount of overpainting, but felt reasonably certain that &quot;the composition was of ancient date&quot;.

The carved high relief icon has similarities to a set of 13th-century icons of St. George from the Crimea, Ohrid, and Castoria. An original Greek inscription recently discovered under the coat of wax paints has a parallel in a lead seal from a Trapezunt monastery, also datable to the 13th century. Thus the 13th century seems to be emerging as the most likely date for the icon.

== Replicas ==
The Blachernitissa never rose to the height of veneration accorded by the Russian Orthodox Church to the Theotokos of Kazan or even to the Theotokos of the Iveron, an Athonite icon whose copy was commissioned by Patriarch Nikon. After Nikon&#x27;s downfall and Alexis&#x27;s death, the icon was neglected so much that it was not evacuated from the Kremlin during Napoleon&#x27;s occupation and was put at risk during the Great Fire of 1812.

<text>Anti-Nowhere League are an English punk rock band, formed in 1979 by lead singer Animal (Nick Culmer), guitarist Magoo (Chris Exall), Bones (Tony Shaw) on drums and Chris Elvy on bass.

==Career==
===Early days===

The band first played at the 1980 Chaos Show at St Mark&#x27;s Hall, Royal Tunbridge Wells on 31 March 1980. They signed to John Curd&#x27;s record label WXYZ Records in the same year.

November 1981 saw the release of their first single, a cover version of Ralph McTell&#x27;s &quot;Streets of London&quot;. The single peaked at No. 48 in the UK Singles Chart and spent five weeks in the listings. The profanity-laden B-side of the single, &quot;So What&quot; later became the group&#x27;s anthem. Copies of this single were seized from indie distributor Pinnacle by the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Obscene Publication Squad shortly after release.

In 1982 the band released their debut album, &quot;We Are...The League&quot;. It reached No. 24 in the UK Albums Chart, and spent eleven weeks in the chart. In the same year the band went to Yugoslavia to record a live album, called &quot;Live In Yugoslavia&quot;. This album spent one week at No. 88 in the UK Albums Chart.

===1984 to 1989===
In 1984, PJ left the band, and they became musically inactive. 1985 saw Michael Bettell join on drums, followed in 1986 by JB (Jonathan Birch). During this time they signed for GWR Records, and recorded &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot; album.

In 1987, Anti-Nowhere League disbanded. However, there was a belated &#x27;farewell&#x27; show at the Victoria Hall in Tunbridge Wells, in 1989, which was recorded and can be heard on their live album, &quot;Live Animals&quot;.

===Comeback===
In 1992, Animal was told by JB that Metallica wanted him to guest at Wembley Arena, when they did their cover version of &quot;So What&quot;. Animal put it thus on ANL&#x27;s website. &quot;As I waited on the edge of the stage waiting to go on it suddenly dawned on me I was just about to stand in front of 10,000 punters who didn&#x27;t know me from Adam and sing a song that I couldn&#x27;t fucking remember; all that kept running through my head was RUN you silly old fucker!&quot;. However, after the 25 October show, Mark joined that year on lead guitar, and 1993–1995 was spent playing gigs in the small venues the band had started out in.

Michael Bettell died in September 2003, aged 41, from a brain tumour.

In 1996, they signed up with Impact Records and recorded their next EP &quot;Pig Iron&quot;. Beef also joined the band. Further personnel changes occurred in 1997 when Winston left the band to be replaced by Jon Jon, and the recording of the album &quot;Scum&quot;. Winston Blake returned to his former occupation of a roofer and leadworker and lives in East Sussex. Danny joined on drums in 1998, and the album &quot;Out of Control&quot; was released a year later in 1999.

In 2001, Magoo quit the band.

===2002–present===

Jon Jon, Beef and Danny left the band, to be replaced by PJ (original drummer), Jez on guitar and Shady on bass. This line-up released the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; in 2005, which was released on the Captain Oi! record label. However, there were arguments over the omission of two songs from that album, &quot;The Day The World Turned Gay&quot; and &quot;The Adventures Of Peter Vile&quot;. Lawyers for Captain Oi! refused to sanction the release of these two songs because of fear of litigation, so Nick (Animal) eventually relented and let the album be released with the two disputed songs omitted.

In 2006, the band set up their own independent record label, Nowhere Records; with &quot;Pig Iron - The Album&quot; being the first release in August 2006. The album included the two songs omitted from the &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; album, as well as &quot;Landlord&quot;, taken from the &quot;Out Of Control&quot; album. The same year, the Anti-Nowhere League undertook a twenty nine date UK tour, and PJ left the band after the Glasgow gig in October 2006. His replacement was Dave Hazlewood (Nato), from the small Kent town of Cranbrook, who had filled in before on tours. On 8 November 2006, the ANL began a three-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. On 26 October, the band joined Angelic Upstarts, Sham 69 and The Damned for the academy in the UK 2006: 30th Anniversary of Punk gig at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire.

The Anti-Nowhere League supported Rancid at their Leeds gig on 8 November 2008. In December 2008, Jez was replaced on lead guitar by Johhny Skullknuckles. The League continued to tour and record, and now promote their new songs with videos. After a mini European tour in late spring 2009, they embarked on an American tour in June and July 2009, before appearing at the Punk Rebellion festival in Blackpool. After touring Germany and the Netherlands in early May 2010, the band and Johhny Skullknuckles parted company and Tommy H (Tom Hunt) was drafted in on guitar.

In 2011, the band recorded the &quot;This Is War&quot; single, and accompanying video, which was followed by a tour with the UK Subs supporting Motörhead on a number of UK dates. At the 2012 Download Festival, the band appeared on the Pepsi Max stage hours before Metallica filled the main stage as headliners.

During the later months of 2015 writing began for the album &quot;The Cage&quot;, the first fresh studio album since &quot;Rampton&quot;. During this time, drummer Dave &#x27;Nato&#x27; Hazlewood left the band. &quot;&#x27;The Cage&quot; album saw another slight change in direction, with a heavier, and more direct sound. It was released by Cleopatra Records in 2016.

2017 saw the band record and release a collection of classic reggae covers under the title &quot;League Style, Loosen Up Vol I&quot;.

<text>Beckman Coulter, Inc. is a Danaher Corporation company that develops, manufactures, and markets products relevant to biomedical testing. It operates in the industries of diagnostics and life sciences. The company was established in 1935 as National Technical Laboratories, and has become an international company through growth and acquisitions of other life sciences organizations.

The company employs over 12,000 people, with $5.8 billion in annual sales by 2017. It is currently headquartered in Brea, California. Beckman Coulter was acquired by Danaher Corporation in 2011.

==History==
The company was founded by Caltech professor Arnold O. Beckman in 1935 as National Technical Laboratories to commercialize a pH meter that he had invented.

In the 1940s, Beckman changed the name to Arnold O. Beckman, Inc. to sell oxygen analyzers, the &quot;Helipot&quot; precision potentiometer, and spectrophotometers. In the 1950s, the company name changed to Beckman Instruments, Inc.

In the 1950s, Beckman Instruments developed the EASE series of analog computers, two of which were used by NASA in the 1960s for real-time simulation during the development of the Apollo Guidance Computer.

In 1954, Beckman Instruments acquired ultracentrifuge maker Spinco (Specialized Instruments Corp.). The Spinco division went on to design and manufacture a broad range of laboratory centrifuges.

In 1955, Beckman established the seminal Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory as a division of Beckman Instruments to begin commercializing the semiconductor transistor technology invented by Caltech alumnus William Shockley. Because Shockley&#x27;s aging mother lived in Palo Alto, California, the Shockley Laboratory was established in nearby Mountain View, California, which has been connected to the growth of Silicon Valley.

In 1961, Beckman acquired Offner Electronics, a company founded by inventor Franklin F. Offner.

In 1982, the company merged into SmithKline to form SmithKline Beckman, with Arnold Beckman as vice chairman, but regained its independence in 1989 after SmithKline merged with &quot;Beecham Group&quot; to form SmithKline Beecham (now part of GlaxoSmithKline).

In 1995, the company acquired Hybritech, Inc. from Eli Lilly.

In 1996, the company acquired the Sanofi portion of Sanofi Pasteur Diagnostics.

In 1998, the company acquired &quot;Coulter Corporation&quot;, a company founded by Wallace H. Coulter, the inventor of the Coulter counter. Beckman, thereafter, changed its name to Beckman Coulter.

By 2003, the company has more than 200,000 systems operating in laboratories around the world.

In 2005, the company acquired Diagnostic Systems Laboratories (DSL) based in Webster, Texas.

In 2006, the company acquired Lumigen and Agencourt Bioscience.

In 2007, the company acquired the Flow Cytometry Business Group of Dako North America, Inc.

In 2009, the company acquired Lab-based Diagnostics business of Olympus Corporation Japan. That same year, the company moved its world headquarters from Fullerton, California to the newly renovated facility in Brea, California.

In February 2011, Danaher announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with Beckman Coulter. On June 30, 2011, Danaher finalized the acquisition of Beckman Coulter.

On September 12, 2012 Danaher acquired Iris Diagnostics and its parent company IRIS International, Inc. as leader in Urinalysis Diagnostic to further boost Danaher&#x27;s Diagnostic business within Beckman Coulter.

On February 1, 2015, the company finalized the acquisition of MicroScan from Siemens Healthcare.

On January 3, 2019, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences announced the acquisition of Labcyte, Inc., a privately held manufacturer of acoustic liquid handlers.

On May 2, 2019, Beckman Coulter finalized their acquisition of EDC Biosciences, a privately held manufacturer of acoustic liquid handlers.

<text>Hardoi is a city and municipal board in Hardoi district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is the administrative headquarters of Hardoi district. It is also known as Prahalad Nagari. Hardoi is about 110 km from the state capital Lucknow and about 385 km from New Delhi. Hardoi is a temple town.

==History==

The early history of Hardoi is obscure. The name suggests a Bhar, a Dalit caste of pasi origin, but tradition either attributes it to a Thathera ruler named Raja Harnakas or to a religious devotee named Hardeo Babar who supposedly lived here around 1000 CE. In any case, the site was inhabited from an early date; below the old town is an ancient &quot;khera&quot; that covers 16 acres. Around 1300, a group of Chamar Gaurs led by Nir Singh are said to have conquered the place from the Thatheras, destroyed their fortress, and re-founded the city.

At the turn of the 20th century, Hardoi consisted of two distinct parts: &quot;old&quot; Hardoi, occupying the original site of the village, and &quot;new&quot; Hardoi, which was developed after the establishment of the British civil station in the late 1850s. &quot;New&quot; Hardoi had wide streets, well-shaded by trees, and consisted mostly of the homes of civil officials and members of the local bar, as well as shops. Victoria Hall, built in 1888, contained the municipal and district offices as well as a public library (with books in English, Urdu, Hindi, Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit) and a clock tower. The city also had a courthouse, police station, dispensary, orphanage, several schools, post and telegraph offices, and jail. Hardoi was not at the time a major commercial centre; the main trade involved gathering grain from the rural parts of the district and then exporting it by rail. There was a grain market at Railwayganj, by the train station, while the main market was at Hardeoganj, which held bazaars on Sundays and Wednesdays. The Gibsonganj quarter, near Railwayganj, had a colony of carpenters who did &quot;extensive business in plough handles, cart wheels, and other portions of country carts.&quot;

==Geography==
Hardoi is located at . It has an average elevation of . Hardoi is located 110 km from Lucknow (capital of Uttar Pradesh) and 394 from New Delhi (capital of India).

Hardoi had an average literary rate of 76%, of which male literacy was 79.5% and female literacy was 72.1%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 12,277 and 4 respectively. Hardoi had 21949 households in 2011.

<doc id="1255687" wikidata="Q1138021" url="?curid=1255687" title="Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory">
<text>Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, later known as Shockley Transistor Corporation, was a pioneering semiconductor developer founded by William Shockley, and funded by Beckman Instruments, Inc., in 1955. It was the first high technology company, in what came to be known as Silicon Valley, to work on silicon-based semiconductor devices.

In 1957, the eight leading scientists resigned, and became the core of what would later become Fairchild Semiconductor. Shockley Semiconductor never recovered from this departure;
it was purchased by Clevite in 1960, then sold to ITT in 1968, and shortly after, officially closed. 

The company&#x27;s headquarters building was repurposed as a retail store. By 2015 plans were made to demolish the site to develop a new building complex. By 2017, the site was redeveloped with new signage marking it as the &quot;Real Birthplace of Silicon Valley.&quot;

==Shockley&#x27;s return to California==
William Shockley received his undergraduate degree from Caltech and moved east to complete his PhD at MIT with a focus on physics. He graduated in 1936 and immediately went to work at Bell Labs. Through the 1930s and &#x27;40s he worked on electron devices, and increasingly with semiconductor materials, pioneering the field of solid state electronics. This led to the 1947 creation of the first transistor, in partnership with John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and others. Through the early 1950s a series of events led to Shockley becoming increasingly upset with Bell&#x27;s management, and especially what he saw as a slighting when Bell promoted Bardeen and Brattain&#x27;s names ahead of his own on the transistor&#x27;s patent. However, others that worked with him suggested the reason for these issues was Shockley&#x27;s abrasive management style, and it was this reason that he was constantly passed over for promotion within the company. These issues came to a head in 1953 and he took a sabbatical and returned to Caltech as a visiting professor.

Shockley struck up a friendship with Arnold Orville Beckman, who had invented the pH meter in 1934. Shockley had become convinced that the natural capabilities of silicon meant it would eventually replace germanium as the primary material for transistor construction. Texas Instruments had recently started production of silicon transistors (in 1954), and Shockley thought he could create a superior product. Beckman agreed to back Shockley&#x27;s efforts in this area, under the umbrella of his company, Beckman Instruments. However, Shockley&#x27;s mother was aging and often ill, and he decided to live closer to her house in Palo Alto. Shockley set about recruiting his first four PhD physicists: William W. Happ who had previously worked on semiconductor devices at Raytheon, George Smoot Horsley and Leopoldo B. Valdes from Bell Labs, and Richard Victor Jones, a recent Berkeley graduate.

The Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory opened for business in a small commercial lot in nearby Mountain View in 1956. Initially he tried to hire more of his former workers from Bell Labs, but they were reticent to leave the east coast, then the center of most high-tech research. Instead, he assembled a team of young scientists and engineers, some from other parts of Bell Laboratories, and set about designing a new type of crystal-growth system that could produce single-crystal silicon boules, at that time a difficult prospect given silicon&#x27;s high melting point.

==Shockley diodes==
While work on the transistors continued, Shockley hit upon the idea of using a four-layer device (transistors are three) that would have the novel quality of locking into the &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; state with no further control inputs. Similar circuits required several transistors, typically three, so for large switching networks the new diodes would greatly reduce complexity. The four-layer diode is now called the Shockley diode.

Shockley became convinced that the new device would be just as important as the transistor, and kept the entire project secret, even within the company. This led to increasingly paranoid behavior; in one famed incident he was convinced that a secretary&#x27;s cut finger was a plot to injure him and ordered lie detector tests on everyone in the company. This was combined with Shockley&#x27;s vacillating management of the projects; sometimes he felt that getting the basic transistors into immediate production was paramount, and would de-emphasize the Shockley diode project in order to make the &quot;perfect&quot; production system. This upset many of the employees, and mini-rebellions became commonplace.

==Traitorous eight==

Eventually a group of the youngest employees – Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Sheldon Roberts – went over Shockley&#x27;s head to Arnold Beckman, demanding that Shockley be replaced. Beckman initially appeared to agree with their demands, but over time made a series of decisions that supported Shockley. Fed up, the group broke ranks and sought support from Fairchild Camera and Instrument, an Eastern U.S. company with considerable military contracts. In 1957, Fairchild Semiconductor was started with plans for making silicon transistors. Shockley called the young scientists the &quot;traitorous eight&quot; and said they would never be successful.

The eight later left Fairchild and started companies of their own. Over a period of 20 years, 65 different companies were started by 1st or 2nd generation teams that traced their origins in Silicon Valley to Shockley Semiconductor. In 2014, Tech Crunch revisited Don Hoefler&#x27;s 1971 article, claiming 92 public companies of 130 descendant listed firms were then worth over US$2.1 Trillion. They also claimed over 2,000 companies could be traced back to Fairchild&#x27;s eight co-founders.

Shockley never managed to make the four-layer diode a commercial success, in spite of eventually working out the technical details and entering production in the 1960s. The introduction of integrated circuits allowed the multiple transistors needed to produce a switch to be placed on a single &quot;chip&quot;, thereby nullifying the parts-count advantage of Shockley&#x27;s design. However, the company did have a number of other successful projects, including the first strong theoretical study of solar cells, developing the seminal Shockley–Queisser limit that places an upper limit of 30% efficiency on basic silicon solar cells.

<text>The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead (CHW; formerly Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children) is a children&#x27;s hospital in Western Sydney. The hospital was founded in 1880 as &quot;The Sydney Hospital for Sick Children&quot;. Its name was changed to the &quot;Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children&quot; on 4 January 1904 when King Edward VII granted use of the appellation &#x27;Royal&#x27; and his consort, Queen Alexandra, consented to the use of her name.

The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead is one of three children&#x27;s hospitals in New South Wales. It is currently located on Hawkesbury Road in Westmead and is affiliated with the University of Sydney.

On 1 July 2010, The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead became part of the newly formed The Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospitals Network (Randwick and Westmead), incorporating the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children.

== History ==
=== Foundation as the Sydney Hospital for Sick Children ===

The hospital was opened in 1880 as the Sydney Hospital for Sick Children. In 1878, Jessie Campbell-Browne, wife of the Member for Singleton, had gathered a group of women to discuss the merits of establishing a children&#x27;s hospital in Sydney; the outcome of Campbell-Browne&#x27;s overtures was the new hospital. It soon outgrew the small building in which it was housed at Glebe Point. In 1906, it moved to a much grander building, designed by Harry Kent in Camperdown, where it stayed for 89 years, where it was known as the Camperdown Children&#x27;s Hospital.

=== Relocation and renaming ===
In 1995, the hospital was relocated to its current location in Westmead to better serve the growing populations of Western Sydney. This relocation involved amalgamation with most of the paediatric services of nearby Westmead Hospital (apart from neonates) to form a new hospital with a new name, initially &quot;The New Children&#x27;s Hospital&quot; and, more recently, &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead&quot;.

The official name of the Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead, the &quot;Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children&quot;, is retained.

==Services==
The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead is one of the busiest Children&#x27;s Hospitals in New South Wales seeing over 80,000 patients annually. In addition to the emergency department, outpatient clinics and inpatient departments receive patients by general practitioner and specialist referral.

===Adolescent health===
The Adolescent Medicine at The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead seeks to improve the health and wellbeing of young people aged 12–24. The key focus areas include developing information and resources; capacity building to increase workers&#x27; skills and confidence in adolescent health; supporting applied research; advocacy and policy development to increase leadership and action for adolescent health.

== Paediatric transgender care controversy ==
In February 2023, a team of doctors at Westmead led by Joseph Elkadi, Catherine Chudleigh, and Ann M. Maguire published an article in the paediatric journal &quot;Children&quot; examining the developmental pathway and clinical outcomes of 79 transgender children who presented at the hospital&#x27;s gender service, the conclusions of which are contested. The authors concluded that gender-affirming healthcare is, in effect, &quot;iatrogenic&quot; and a &quot;non-standard risky approach&quot;. Their conclusions were widely repeated in numerous articles in conservative or right-leaning media outlets in Australia, citing &quot;legal and safety fears&quot; over gender-affirming healthcare. Commenting on media discussion of the research, an ABC Australia article by Patricia Karvelas, Lesley Robinson and Carla Hildebrandt said that the research was &quot;being weaponised by anti-trans activists and proponents of alternative forms of gender care.&quot;

The conclusions reached in Elkadi &quot;et al&quot;″s article presenting their Westmead study were subsequently analysed and strongly disputed by the peak body for transgender healthcare in Australia, the Australian New Zealand Professional Association for Transgender Health (AusPATH). In a response letter dated 1 March 2023, AusPATH held that the Westmead study&#x27;s authors displayed &quot;significant bias&quot; in their use of terminology and selection of supporting literature. For example, AusPATH found the Westmead article cited &quot;discredited literature&quot;; that it included a preponderance of marginal literature that tended to be critical of the gender-affirming approach, without any balancing consideration of the &quot;well-described, established&quot; body of work demonstrating benefits of the more medically-accepted treatments. AusPATH also identified what, in its view, were a range of methodological flaws and misrepresentations of data in the Westmead study. In particular, its use of the scientifically-unverified &quot;Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria&quot; (ROGD) classification for study participants compromises the validity of the Westmead research, according to AusPATH. The Westmead study&#x27;s authors were also criticised for using &quot;de-humanising&quot; anti-trans language and for &quot;pathologising&quot; gender diversity in a discriminatory way in their article.

In July 2023, the Health Minister for New South Wales, Ryan Park, announced the government would commission a state-wide review of gender-affirming care, to be undertaken by the health policy group the Sax Institute. The review was initiated following a &quot;string of staff resignations&quot;, which ABC News, Australia said were linked to the disputed research; the ABC characterised the research as &quot;endorsed by the hospital hierarchy&quot;.

== Transport ==
The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead has a light rail stop, served by the L4 Westmead &amp; Carlingford line operated by Sydney Light Rail. The stop opened on 20 December 2024.

== Notable people ==
===Notable staff and board members===
Some notable individuals connected to the history of the Children&#x27;s Hospital are:
* Sir Lorimer Dods (1900–1981), paediatrician who founded, with assistance from Dr John G. Fulton and Douglas Burrows, the Children&#x27;s Medical Research Foundation.
* Sir Charles Clubbe (1854–1932), was the President of the hospital&#x27;s Board of Management from 1904 until 1932, can perhaps be called the father of the Children&#x27;s Hospital and is sometimes also mentioned as one of the pioneers of Australian orthopaedic surgery. Clubbe has a ward named after him.
* Sir Robert Blakeway Wade (1874–1954), orthopaedic surgeon. A hospital building completed in 1939, Wade House, was named in his honour; it features pictures of Australian fauna drawn on many walls by artist Pixie O&#x27;Harris.
* Dr Margaret Hilda Harper (1879–1964), paediatrician who discovered the difference between coeliac disease and cystic fibrosis of the pancreas in 1930.
* Sir Norman Gregg (1892–1966), ophthalmologist: the first person to identify German measles as a cause for congenital deformities.
* Rosa Angela Kirkcaldie CBE (1887–1972), charismatic matron 1922-1945
* Dr Lindsay Dey (1886–1973), paediatrician: President of the hospital&#x27;s Board of Management from 1946 until 1959.
* Dr Frank Tidswell (1867–1941), microbiologist: Director of Pathology from 1913 until 1941.
* Dr. R. Douglas Reye (1912–1977), fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, after whom Reye&#x27;s syndrome was named, worked at the hospital from 1939 until his death.
* Dr Marcel Sofer–Schreiber (1910–1994), paediatric neurosurgeon, led the way in Australia in the treatment of hydrocephalus, using the Spitz–Holter shunt in the 1960s. He went on to train many doctors to carry out this procedure, thus saving the lives of countless babies, and leaving a lasting legacy. He published extensively on his specialty with papers on hydrocephalus, head injuries and spinal tumours. He was also the first surgeon to draw attention to the potentially deadly condition of subdural haematoma in infants.

=== Notable patient ===
Notable individual connected to the history of the Children&#x27;s Hospital are:
*Sophie Delezio (born 2001) – treated at the hospital after being badly injured in a car crash at two years old. She suffered burns to 85 per cent of her body but survived and was released from hospital six months later in June 2004.

<text>Paul Owens (July 27, 1924 – October 17, 2002) was one of the foremost artists in African American gospel music, performing with The Dixie Hummingbirds, the Swan Silvertones and the Sensational Nightingales. Born in Greensboro, North Carolina, he started as a soloist with the Israelite Gospel Singers, the Baystate Gospel Singers and the Evangelist Singers, then joined a group known as the Nightingales (later the Sensational Nightingales, which featured Julius &quot;June Cheeks&quot;) before moving to the Hummingbirds in 1948. Paired with Ira Tucker, they adopted a daring style, which they called &quot;trickeration&quot;, in which they would mix melisma with intricate harmonies, sharing the lead while often improvising phrases.

Owens left the group in 1952 to join the Swan Silvertones, to whose aggressive shouting style he added the smooth harmonies and melodious tenor for which he was known as a member of the Hummingbirds. He later left them to join the Sensational Nightingales, for whom he sang as a baritone, then returned to the Hummingbirds in 1989.

Owens died aged 78.

<text>Oscar Josef Alin (22 December 184631 December 1900) was a Swedish historian and politician.

==Life==
Alin was born in Falun, Sweden. In 1872 he completed his doctorate and became docent of political science, and in 1882 &quot;professor skytteanus&quot; of Government and Eloquence at Uppsala University. As &quot;professor skytteanus&quot; he succeeded Vilhelm Erik Svedelius, whom he also followed in the inspectorship of the university&#x27;s Västmanland-Dalarna Nation. In September 1888 he was elected a member of the first chamber of the Riksdag, where he attached himself to the conservative protectionist party, over which, from the first, he exercised great authority. He retired from the Riksdag in 1899 to become &quot;rector magnificus&quot; of the university, but died the end of the next year. It is as a historian that Alin is most remarkable.

==Works==
Among his numerous works the following are especially worthy of note: 
* (Upsala 1872);
* (Stockholm, 1878);
* (Stockholm, 1884–1887);
* (Stockholm, 1889–1891), the best book on the question of the Norwegian–Swedish Union from the Swedish point of view;
* (Stockholm, 1899);
* (Stockholm, 1899);
* (Stockholm, 1893).

He also edited (Stockholm, 1887), in conjunction with Emil Hildebrand, and (Stockholm, 1892).

<doc id="1255697" wikidata="Q728076" url="?curid=1255697" title="Citroën C1">
<text>The Citroën C1 is a city car marketed by Citroën from June 2005 to January 2022, originally developed as part of the B-Zero project by PSA Peugeot Citroën in a joint venture with Toyota, with two generations produced.

The C1 was developed along with two badge engineered variants, the Peugeot 107, which is mostly identical to the C1 aside from its front bumper fascia and front and rear lights, and the Toyota Aygo, which is slightly more differentiated. The three siblings debuted at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show and were manufactured at the facilities of the TPCA joint venture (Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile) in the city of Kolín, Czech Republic.
== First generation (PM/PN; 2005) ==

The C1&#x27;s body was designed by Donato Coco in a one-box configuration. On both the five door C1 and 107, though not the Aygo, the rear tail light cluster extends from the edge of the rear doors to the rear window, without a distinctly expressed &quot;C-pillar&quot;. The C1 is powered by a 1.0 L three cylinder engine, which has a fuel economy of 61.4 mpg (UK gallons EU method; 4.6 L/100 km EU method; ca 43.4 mpg US with US method) or a 1.4 L four cylinder diesel engine which has a fuel economy of 68.9 mpg (UK gallons EU method; 4.1 L/100 km EU method; ca 48.8 mpg US with US method). According to the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, the C1 is the production car with the second-best fuel economy both among petrol engines (after the Toyota Prius) and among diesel engines (after the Smart Fortwo mhd).

In January 2010, PSA Peugeot Citroën announced that it was recalling around 100,000 of the C1 and Peugeot 107, following the worldwide recall by Toyota for a sticking accelerator pedal – which the Aygo is affected by. Under certain circumstances, the pedal can stick in a partially depressed position, or return slowly to the off position. The C1 became popular as a cheap racing car for use in endurance racing, similar to its predecessor the Citroën 2CV.

=== Trim range (United Kingdom) ===
* Vibe, available in three-door or five-door, this was the basic model and the cheapest. Did not come with central locking, a rev counter, air conditioning or electric windows. Only available with the 1.0i engine.
* Rhythm, available in three-door or five-door, this trim added remote central locking, body-coloured wing mirrors, two side airbags and an engine rev counter. The 1.4 HDi diesel and the 1.0i petrol engines were both available with this trim.
* Code, available in three-door or five-door, added to the Rhythm specification by including 14 inch alloy wheels, half leather-trimmed seats, chrome interior trim inserts and a glove box cover. The 1.4 HDi diesel and the 1.0i petrol engines were both available with this trim.

;Special editions (United Kingdom)
* Cool – based on the Vibe, adding air conditioning and blue seat fabrics/dashboard inserts, available in Lipizan White or Damas Blue.
* Airplay – based on the Rhythm, adding full iPod connectivity, iPod cradle, a 4 GB iPod Nano and coloured dashboard inserts and door pulls. Early models were available with bright, swirling decals. This model was originally revealed at the 2006 British International Motor Show in July 2006.

Designer Franco Sbarro created a modified C1 named the GT-C1, a design concept that follows the same theme of his previous Citroën Xsara Picasso Cup Concept. The extreme bodywork feature very wide wheels and gullwing doors alongside a modified 1.6L engine from the Citroën C2 VTS and Citroën C4 WRC-derived brakes.

In Portugal and Greece, a commercial van version called the Entreprise is offered, equipped with the 1.4L diesel engine and available only in the three-door body, for urban use. Its 107 sibling also offers an identical version.

In the United Kingdom, the now-defunct Electric Car Corporation sold an electric car based on the C1, called the Citroën C1 ev&#x27;ie from 2009 to 2012.

=== 2009 facelift ===
In January 2009, the Citroën C1 was facelifted at the same time as the Peugeot 107 and Toyota Aygo.

The updated C1 features a revised front bumper and grille, in keeping with Citroën&#x27;s family look. Three new colours were also added and trim levels were also revised: basic Vibe models became &#x27;VT&#x27;, and Rhythm became &#x27;VTR&#x27;. More durable seat fabrics were used and ventilation control graphics were updated for better legibility, and all models received new wheel trims. A revised clutch was fitted from this model onwards.

A special edition &quot;Splash&quot; was available at launch, though this was a strictly limited edition. This was based on the basic &quot;VT&quot;. However, it featured air conditioning, a CD player and electric front windows. The Splash model was available in Electra Blue or Lipizan White. Electra Blue came with white door mirrors, whilst Lipizan White came with glossy black door mirrors.

=== Reliability ===
Breakdown statistics reported by the German Automobile Club in May 2010 placed the Citroën C1 (which the data grouped with the Peugeot 107 and Toyota Aygo) at the top of the sub small car class, in respect of the low breakdown rates achieved for cars aged between one and four years.

=== Safety ===

The Euro NCAP score was reduced from 4 stars to 3 stars for the 2012 facelift.

== Second generation (AB40; 2014) ==

At the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, Citroën presented a redesigned C1, also to be manufactured at a factory of the Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile Czech (TPCA) in a joint venture with the Peugeot 108 and Toyota Aygo.

<text>Peugeot S.A., trading as Groupe PSA () (formerly PSA Peugeot Citroën from 1991 to 2016) was a French multinational automotive manufacturing company which produced automobiles and motorcycles under the Peugeot, Citroën, DS, Opel and Vauxhall brands. On 18 December 2019, PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced that they had agreed to the terms of a binding $50 billion merger. On 16 July 2020, both companies announced the new name for their merged operations, Stellantis. The deal closed on 16 January 2021. , Stellantis is the fourth largest automaker by sales behind Toyota, Volkswagen Group, and Hyundai Motor Group.

Peugeot was the largest PSA brand. PSA was listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange and was a constituent of the CAC 40 index.

Beginning in 2016, PSA began to outline a strategy which entailed the rapid expansion of the company, through both geographic expansion and acquisitions of other car companies. PSA announced plans to enter the Indian, American, Canadian, Southeast Asian, and other markets in the coming years.

Headquartered in Rueil-Malmaison, PSA, with sales of 3.88 million units in 2018, was the third-largest Europe-based automaker, distantly trailing industry leader Volkswagen&#x27;s 10.8 million and just a fraction behind Renault.

In 2019, Groupe PSA was the ninth largest automaker in the world, after Volkswagen, Toyota, the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance, General Motors, Hyundai Motor Group, Ford Motor Company, Honda, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

==History==
=== Citroën acquisition ===
In December 1974, Peugeot S.A. acquired a 38.2% share of Citroën. On 9 April 1976 they increased their stake of the then bankrupt company to 89.95%, thus creating the &quot;PSA Group&quot; (where PSA is short for Peugeot Société Anonyme), becoming PSA Peugeot Citroën. Since Citroën had two successful new designs in the market at this time (the GS and CX) and Peugeot was typically prudent in its own finances, the PSA venture was a financial success from 1976 to 1979.

=== Chrysler Europe acquisition ===

In late 1978, PSA purchased the failing Chrysler Europe (which had been Rootes and Simca) from the troubled US parent firm for a nominal US$1.00, plus assumption of outstanding debt, leading to losses for the consortium from 1980 to 1985. Further investment was required because PSA decided to create a new brand for the entity for the disparate French and British models, based on the Talbot sports car last seen in the 1950s. From then on, the whole Chrysler/Simca range was sold under the Talbot badge until production of Talbot-branded passenger cars was shelved in 1987 and on commercial vehicles in 1992.

All of this investment caused serious financial problems for the entire PSA group; PSA lost money from 1980 to 1985. There were some bright spots, however: mainly thanks to the success of the Peugeot 205 and in spite of Talbot sales withering away, PSA surpassed Renault in sales in the domestic French market for the first time in 1983. In 1987, the company dropped the Talbot brand for passenger cars when it ceased production of the Simca-developed Horizon; the Samba and Alpine/Solara had been discontinued a year earlier. What was to have been the Talbot Arizona became the Peugeot 309, with the former Rootes plant in Ryton and Simca plant in Poissy being turned over for Peugeot assembly from October 1985. Producing Peugeots in Ryton was significant, as it signaled the first time that PSA would build cars in the UK (car assembly at Ryton stopped in 2006 and the plant was closed). The Talbot name survived for a little longer on commercial vehicles until 1992 before being shelved completely. From 1987 to 1995, the Ryton plant also produced the Peugeot 405 saloon.

=== Financial crisis, alliance with General Motors (2012–2014) ===

On 29 February 2012, PSA announced the creation of a major alliance with General Motors (GM), as part of which GM became PSA&#x27;s second-largest shareholder, after the Peugeot family, with a holding of 7%. The alliance was intended to enable $2 billion per year of cost savings through platform sharing, common purchasing and other economies of scale.

In July 2012, a union official said that PSA Peugeot Citroën would cut as much as 10 percent (8,000-10,000) of its French workforce of 100,356 employees on permanent and temporary contract. The jobs cut was more than previously announced.

On 24 October, PSA said it was close to an agreement with creditor banks on €11.5 billion ($14.9 billion) of refinancing and had won state guarantees on €7 billion in further borrowing by its Banque PSA Finance.

On 12 December 2013, General Motors announced it was selling its 7% stake in PSA Peugeot Citroën to Padmapriya Automobile Investment Group.

In 2014, Dongfeng Motor Group, the Chinese partner that builds PSA cars in China, and the French government each took a 13% stake in PSA, in a financial rescue operation, reducing the Peugeot family share from 25% to 14%.

=== Rapid expansion ===
Following Dongfeng and the French government each acquiring stakes in Groupe PSA, various cost-cutting measures at the company turned its fortune around and gradually reduced PSA&#x27;s debt, until the company began to turn a profit beginning in 2015. A new CEO, Carlos Tavares, was engaged and began to implement various cost-cutting measures and expanded the model range of all three core brands, alongside the creation of a new brand, DS Automobiles.

In early 2016, PSA unveiled a roadmap detailing its plan to re-enter the North American car market for the first time since 1991. 

==== Acquisition of &#x27;Ambassador&#x27; brand from Hindustan Motors ====
On 10 February 2017, PSA announced a 50:50 joint venture with the CK Birla Group, the owner of the Hindustan Motors to sell Peugeot, Citroën, and DS vehicles in India and purchase of the Ambassador brand from Hindustan Motors at the cost of ₹80 Crore (€11 million).

==== Acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall Motors ====
On 14 February 2017 PSA announced that it was in talks to acquire Opel and Vauxhall Motors from General Motors. The talks were in an advanced stage, but were a surprise to the press and to much of Opel&#x27;s leadership as they had plans to transform the company into an electric-car-only brand using the platform of the Opel Ampera-e for a wide range of models. GM agreed to continue to supply PSA with Ampera-e and other electric vehicle technology. In August 2017, PSA completed the acquisition deal of Opel and Vauxhall.

GM reported a loss of US $257 million from its European operations in 2016, sixteenth consecutive loss-making year for GM in Europe, bringing its amount of losses on the continent since 2000 to more than US $15 billion. Some expressed concerns about what this major acquisition might do to PSA&#x27;s bottom line. However, due to this amount of debt, it is likely that GM may give the brands to PSA, or sell Opel and Vauxhall at a highly reduced price. Tavares expects synergies a decade after the takeover.

PSA CEO Carlos Tavares met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Theresa May at separate meetings where he toured some of Opel and Vauxhall&#x27;s operations in Germany and the UK, respectively. He assured the leaders that jobs would be safeguarded and that Vauxhall&#x27;s Ellesmere Port plant was to be used by PSA at least until 2021.

Tavares announced that he wants Opel to keep its German brand identity and to embrace it, and that he would leverage Opel&#x27;s pedigree of German engineering and Motorsport and use the company&#x27;s heritage to reach markets and customers that may not consider a French car due to perceived reliability issues. He also announced that the Opel and Vauxhall brands would be elevated to new heights within Groupe PSA, including the sale of Opel and Vauxhall-branded vehicles outside Europe for the first time in many decades.

==== Bid for Proton ====
On 17 February 2017, PSA announced its bid to acquire PROTON Holdings, which owns the Proton and Lotus brands, but lost out to Geely a few months later.

=== Merger with FCA ===
In May 2019 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced its intention to seek a merger with Groupe Renault. However, in early June merger talks were suspended, and never resumed. On 31 October 2019, Groupe PSA announced intent to merge with FCA. The merger would be on a 50-50 all stock basis. On 18 December 2019, FCA and PSA announced that they had agreed to the terms of a binding $50 billion merger, expected to be implemented in the next 12 months. The new group is incorporated in the Netherlands and has John Elkann as Chairman of the Board and Carlos Tavares as CEO. On 15 July 2020, the two companies announced that the merged entity will be named Stellantis, from the &quot;Latin verb &#x27;stello&#x27; meaning &#x27;to brighten with stars.&#x27;&quot; On 4 January 2021, both shareholders of PSA and FCA approved the merger and the deal was closed on 16 January 2021.

==Operations==
The Peugeot, Citroën and DS Automobiles brands retain separate sales and marketing structures, but share common technology, development and assembling assets.

Jean-Martin Folz was PSA&#x27;s CEO between 1996 and early 2007, when he was replaced by former Airbus head Christian Streiff. Streiff was sacked on 29 March 2009, a day after the company posted a full year loss for 2008. Streiff was replaced by Corus Group chief executive Philippe Varin. Carlos Tavares became CEO in 2014.

===Developing markets===
PSA was actively committed to developing its market presence and sales in many fast growing developing countries and regions of the world. This led to huge investments and partnerships in South America, Iran (Iran Khodro) and China (Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën Automobile). It announced plans to invest €650 million in a manufacturing plant in Sanand, India. With a capacity of 170,000 vehicles, the Sanand plant started production of the aaa in 2020. In Kazakhstan, assembly of the Peugeot passenger cars will start in June 2013 with a production capacity of 4,000 units per year at the beginning and more than 10,000 units in the near future. A PSA plant was opened in 2018 in Tunisia and in 2019 in Kenitra in Morocco.

Citroën will enter the Indian market in early 2021, with the launch of the C5 Aircross SUV manufactured at a plant in Tiruvallur, India.

===Peugeot Citroën Automobiles S.A.===
The manufacturer of Peugeot, Citroën and DS Automobiles-branded cars and vans, 100% owned by PSA Group and formed from the combination of Automobiles Citroën and Automobiles Peugeot. Automobiles Citroën, Automobiles Peugeot, and DS Automobiles remain in operation in relation to specific retail operations in various countries but not in the development or manufacture of vehicles.

===Gefco===

Gefco is a large international logistics company, established by Peugeot in 1949 and named Les Groupages Express de Franche-Comté. In November 2012, PSA sold a 75% share to Russian Railways (RZD) for €800m, but retains Gefco as the main logistics provider.

===Motaquip===
Motaquip is an all-makes aftermarket parts company and was established in the UK by PSA Peugeot Citroën in 1981. In December 2014 Motaquip was sold to an outside company to become independent of PSA as &quot;Motaquip Limited&quot;. The head office is now based in Nuneaton, UK, with all parts distributed from a warehouse in Luton, UK.

===Financial services===
PSA wholly owns Banque PSA Finance which provides financial services, and 98.67% of GIE PSA Tresorerie which was founded in 1990 as a treasury and cash management services division.

===Former marques and subsidiaries===
A number of marques were inherited following the acquisition of Chrysler Europe in 1978, and some were merged to re-establish Talbot, a previously dormant marque.

Chrysler Europe marques included the British Sunbeam (1901–1976), Humber (1868-1976), Singer (1905–1970), Commer (1905–1979), Hillman (1907–1976), Karrier (1908–1977), the French Simca (1934–1977) and the Spanish Barreiros (1959–1978).

Cycles Peugeot produced bicycles from 1882 until 2005.

In 2001, ProCycle discontinued the Peugeot bicycle brand. In Europe, the licence to produce Peugeot-branded bicycles was sold to Cycleurope, a company making bicycles under different names, on condition that it would be reconsidered in 2004. That license was later withdrawn for Europe, though production of bicycles for export continued for another year.

Peugeot Motocycles manufactures a range of mopeds and scooters. In 2014, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra acquired a 51% stake in the company, and in 2019, PSA sold its remaining stake.

===Notable vehicles and innovations===

====Hybrid Air====
PSA Group exhibited the &quot;Hybrid Air&quot; engine, an experimental petro-hydraulic hybrid, at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. The engine is the result of a secret development project involving about 100 people. The basic technology is not new—it has been used in heavy vehicles such as garbage trucks or buses which frequently start and stop—but its application to passenger cars is. The vehicle uses nitrogen gas compressed by energy harvested from braking or deceleration to power a hydraulic drive which supplements power from its conventional gasoline engine. The hydraulic and electronic components were supplied by Robert Bosch GmbH. Production versions were scheduled for 2015 or 2016 to sell at about US$25,000 or £17,000. Mileage was estimated to be about 3.5 L/100 km or 80 miles per gallon for city driving if installed in a Citroën C3.

<text>Gao , or Gawgaw/Kawkaw, is a city in Mali and the capital of the Gao Region. The city is located on the River Niger, east-southeast of Timbuktu on the left bank at the junction with the Tilemsi valley.

For much of its history Gao was an important commercial centre involved in the trans-Saharan trade. In the 9th century external Arabic writers described Gao as an important regional power, and by the end of the 10th century, the local ruler was said to be a Muslim. Towards the end of the 13th century, Gao became part of the Mali Empire.

In the first half of the 15th century the town regained its independence. With the conquests of Sunni Ali (ruled 1464–1492) it became the capital of the Songhai Empire. The Empire collapsed after the Moroccan invasion in 1591 and the invaders chose to make Timbuktu their capital.

By the time of Heinrich Barth&#x27;s visit in 1854, Gao had declined to become an impoverished village with 300 huts constructed from matting. In 2009, the urban commune had a population of 86,633.

In 2012, Gao was captured from Malian government forces by National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and Ansar Dine rebels. After additional captures of Kidal and Timbuktu, the MNLA declared the region independent of Mali as the nation of Azawad and named Gao its capital. The MNLA lost control to Islamist militias after the Battle of Gao in June 2012, with the city being recaptured by French military forces as part of Opération Serval in early 2013.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Gao is located on the eastern bank of the Niger River at the junction with the Tilemsi Valley. The sprawling town is the largest in eastern Mali. It is connected to the capital, Bamako at the western end of Mali, by 1200 km (750 mi) of paved road. In 2006, the Wabaria bridge was opened to replace the ferry service across the Niger. The bridge was constructed by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation and financed by the Islamic Development Bank and the Malian government.

The town is located with road links (unpaved) to the desert Kidal Region to the north and to Niamey, the capital of Niger, to the south. The road to the south runs along the left bank of the river. The town of Ansongo is 103 km (65 mi) from Gao. The border with Niger is just south of the village of Labbézanga, a distance of 204 km (127 mi). The prime meridian marker runs right through Gao, Mali.

There are also seasonal ferry services on the Niger River. A service between Gao and Koulikoro, a distance of 1380 km (860 mi), is managed by the Compagnie Malienne de Navigation (COMANAV). It usually operates from the end of July, after the annual rains when there is sufficient water in the river, until mid November. Smaller boats are able to operate for a longer season between Bourem and Ansongo.

In the 1998 census, the population of the urban commune was 52,201. By the census in 2009 this had increased to 86,633, a 4.7% annual growth rate. For administrative purposes, the commune is divided into nine &quot;quartiers&quot;: Gadeye, Farandjiré, Aljanabanbia, Djoulabougou, Saneye, Sosso Koïra, Boulgoundjé, Château, and Djidara. The urban commune is bounded to the north by the commune of Soni Ali Ber, to the east by the commune of Anchawadi and to the south and west by the commune of Gounzoureye.

=== Climate ===

The climate is a tropical desert climate (Koppen: BWh), bordering on a hot semi arid climate (Koppen: BSh), with nearly all rainfall concentrated in the summer monsoon season.
Gao features an arid climate under Köppen&#x27;s climate classification. Gao&#x27;s climate is hot and dry, with the only rainfall occurring between June and September. August is normally the wettest month. The average annual rainfall is only 220 mm, but there are large year-to-year variations. May is the hottest month, with an average daily high temperature of 43 °C. December and January are the coolest months, with daily low temperatures of 15 °C. From October to March during the dry period, the north-easterly Harmattan wind blows from the Sahara.

With the low rainfall, the vegetation further away from the river is sparse and consists mainly of various species of Acacia (&quot;Acacia raddiana&quot;, &quot;Acacia nilotica&quot;, &quot;Acacia ehrenbergiana&quot;) and &quot;Balanites aegyptiaca&quot;. The herbaceous plants are dominated by &quot;Cenchrus biflorus&quot; and &quot;Panicum laetum&quot;.

=== Annual flood of the Niger River ===
Almost all the local agriculture depends on river water for irrigation. The annual flood of the Niger River is a result of the heavy rainfall in the headwaters of the Niger and Bani rivers in Guinea and the northern Ivory Coast. The rainfall in the headwater areas peaks in August but the flood water takes time to pass down the river system, through the Inner Niger Delta region and arrive at Gao. At Koulikoro the flood peaks in September, while in Gao the flood lasts longer and reaches a maximum in December. There is a large year-to-year variation in the extent of the flooding. The existing and proposed dams upstream of Gao reduce the overall flow of the river and could potentially have a large effect on the local agriculture. When in flood the river is 4 km wide at Gao but during the dry season a number of islands appear in the river. There is very little flow, only 5% of the maximum, in June and July.

== History ==
===Historiography===
The history of the Gao Empire precedes that of the Songhai Empire in the region of the Middle Niger. Both empires had the town of Gao as their capital. Apart from some Arabic epitaphs on tombstones discovered in 1939 at the cemetery of Gao-Saney (6 km to the east of the city) there are no surviving indigenous written records that date from before the middle of the 17th century. Our knowledge of the early history of the town relies on the writings of Arabic geographers living in Morocco, Egypt and Andalusia, most of whom never visited the region. These authors referred to the town as Kawkaw or Kuku. The two key 17th century chronicles, the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; and the &quot;Tarikh al-fattash&quot;, provide information on the town at the time of the Songhai Empire but they contain relatively little on the social and economic history. The chronicles do not, in general, acknowledge their sources. Their accounts for the earlier periods are almost certainly based on oral tradition and for events before the second half of the 15th century they are likely to be less reliable. For these earlier periods, the two chronicles sometimes provide conflicting information.

===Gao Empire===

There is clear archaeological evidence that Gao was firmly rooted in both its local hinterland and interregional economic networks. Pottery recovered from all levels in both mounds is generally quite similar to examples from sites throughout the region, indicating that Gao was part of a regional market sphere, if not a broader cultural substrate.

Gao thus represents a form of urbanism driven largely by local urban-rural dynamics, but in a way in which local elites capitalized on and, in fact, co-opted the opportunities offered by long-distance trade.

Midden deposits produced large quantities of household debris (animal bones, pottery shards, glass, glass beads, and a variety of copper and iron objects). Collectively, the local character of the ceramic, faunal, and botanical remains suggests that, culturally, Gao-Saney was part of a broader Niger River indigenous cultural complex. Additionally, fragments of North African enamel ware, Andalusian chandelier ware, and fragments of Islamic glass vessels were recovered throughout the excavations at Gao.

Archaeological digs in Gao-Saney show that the site was occupied by roughly 700CE, and was a center of manufacturing, iron smelting, and trade with areas as far away as Mesopotamia. It was the southern terminus of a trade route powered by chariots that linked it to the Mediterranean. At some point no later than the early 10th century the Songhay king based in Kukiya moved to the site of Gao Ancien, just north of the modern city on the bank of the Niger river and a few kilometers from Gao Saney further inland. The kings of this period were of a lineage known as Qanda.

The earliest written mention of Gao is by al-Khwārizmī, who wrote in the first half of the 9th century, when Gao was already an important regional power. Al-Yaqubi wrote in his &quot;Tarikh&quot; in around 872:
There is the kingdom of the Kawkaw, which is the greatest of the realms of the Sūdān, the most important and most powerful. All the kingdoms obey its king. Al-Kawkaw is the name of the town. Besides this there are a number of kingdoms of which the rulers pay allegiance to him and acknowledge his sovereignty, although they are kings in their own lands.

Ibn al-Faqih (writing ) mentions a caravan route from Egypt to ancient Ghana via Kawkaw, but Ibn Hawqal (writing c. 988) states that the old route from Egypt to the Sudan was abandoned in the reign of the Egyptian ruler Ibn Tulun (ruled 868–884) as some of the caravans were attacked by bandits while others were overwhelmed by the wind-blown sand. The more direct route was replaced by one that went to Sijilmasa before heading south across the Sahara. In the 10th century, Gao was already Muslim and was described as consisting of two separate towns. Al-Muhallabi, who died in 990, wrote in a lost work quoted in the biographical dictionary compiled by Yaqut:
Their king pretends before his subject to be a Muslim and most of them pretend to be Muslims too. He has a town on the Nile [Niger], on the eastern bank, which is called Sarnāh, where there are markets and trading houses and to which there is continuous traffic from all parts. He has another town to the west of the Nile [Niger] where he and his men and those who have his confidence live. There is a mosque there where he prays but the communal prayer ground is between the two towns.

The archaeological evidence suggests that there were two settlements on the eastern bank of the Niger: Gao Ancien situated within the modern town, to the east of the Tomb of Askia, and the archaeological site of Gao-Saney (Sané in French) situated around 4 km to the east. The bed of the Wadi Gangaber passes to the south of the Gao-Saney occupation mound (tell) but to the north of Gao Ancien. The imported pottery and glass recovered from Gao-Saney suggest that the site was occupied between the 8th and 11th centuries. Gao-Saney corresponds to Sarnāh of al-Muhallabi. Al-Bakri writing in 1068 also records the existence of two towns, Both al-Muhallabi (see quote above) and al-Bakri situate Gao on the west (or right bank) of the Niger. The 17th century &quot;Tarikh al-fattash&quot; also states that in the 10th century Gao was situated on the Gourma side (i.e. the west bank) of the river. A large sand dune, &quot;La Dune Rose&quot;, lies on the west bank opposite Gao, but at Koima, on the edge of the dune at a site 4 km north of Gao, surface deposits indicate a pre 9th century settlement. This could be the west bank Gao mentioned by 10th and 11th-century authors. The site has not been excavated.

al-Idrisi, writing in around 1154, does not mention a second town, and archaeological excavations in Gao-Saney indicate the site may have beena abandoned by this time.

Al-Sadi in his &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; gives lists 32 rulers of the Zuwa dynasty and states that in 1009–1010 A.D. the 15th ruler, Zuwa Kusoy, was the first to convert to Islam. He does not actually specify where they lived except for the legendary founder of the dynasty, Zuwa Alayman who he claims came from the Yemen to Kukiya.

John Hunwick, among others, speculates that the first version of Islam was Ibadism. In c.1079-1082, a Sanhaja Berber group, inspired by the Sunni Almoravids, took control of the area, leaving behind royal epitaphs at a cemetery in Gao-Saney. Whether or not these kings feature on the kings lists of the Za dynasty recorded in the &quot;Tarikh&quot;s is debated. Dierk Lange posits that these upstarts, whether they were longstanding residents or newcomers, represent the founding of the Sonni dynasty.

===Malian empire===
Towards the end of the 13th century Gao lost its independence and became part of the expanding Mali Empire. What happened to the Zuwa rulers is not recorded, though royal epitaphs have been found in Kukiya which may indicate they took shelter there. Lange, again going against more long-established opinions, argues that the Za were in fact Malian vassals and the Sonni were the ones who took refuge in Kukiya.

Ibn Battuta visited Suleyman (mansa) in Gao in 1352–53, when the town formed part of the Mali Empire. He arrived by boat from Timbuktu on his return journey from visiting the capital of the Empire:Then I travelled to the town of Kawkaw, which is a great town on the Nīl [Niger], one of the finest, biggest, and most fertile cities of the Sūdān. There is much rice there, and milk, and chickens, and fish, and the cucumber, which has no like. Its people conduct their buying and selling with cowries, like the people of Mālī.
After staying a month in the town, Ibn Battuta left with a caravan for Takedda and from there headed north back across the Sahara to an oasis in Tuat with a large caravan that included 600 slave girls.

Ibn Khaldun recorded that in 776 A.H or 1374/1375 AD Mali fought a war over Gao against Berber Tuareg forces from Takedda, devastating the city. It would not reclaim its former importance until the rise of the Songhai Empire.

===Songhai empire===
Sometime in the 14th century, Ali Kulun, the first ruler of the Sunni dynasty, rebelled against the Malian hegemony but the Malians were able to regain control. It was not until the first half of the 15th century that Sunni Sulayman Dama was able to throw off the Malian yoke. His successor, Sunni Ali Ber (1464–1492), greatly expanded the territory under Songhai control and established the Songhai Empire. He made Gao his capital.

Leo Africanus visited Gao sometime between 1506 and 1510 when the town was ruled by Askiya Muhammad I, the first ruler of the Askiya dynasty. He observed that the large town lacked a surrounding wall and was full of rich merchants.
The town is very civilized compared to Timbuktu. Bread and meat are abundant, though you cannot find wine or fruits. Actually, melons, cucumbers, and excellent squash are plentiful, and there are enormous quantities of rice. There are many sweet water wells. There is a square where on market days huge numbers of slaves are sold, both male and female. A young girl of fifteen is worth about six ducats, and a young man almost as much; small children are worth about half as much as grown slaves.

Towards the end of the 16th century, Gao controlled an empire that extended for over 1,400,000 km2, an area comparable in size to the modern state of Mali. The &quot;Tarikh al-fattash&quot; reports that a survey conducted during the reign of Askiya Al-Hajj (1582–1586) found that there were 7,626 houses without counting the huts made of straw. Assuming each house was occupied by an average of 6 people, this would imply a population of around 45,000, making Gao one of the largest cities in West Africa at the time.

The Moroccan invasion of 1591 led to the collapse of the Songhai Empire. The invaders chose to make Timbuktu their capital and the importance of Gao declined. The German explorer Heinrich Barth visited Gao in 1854 on his return journey from Timbuktu. He found a village of about 300 huts constructed of matting and grouped in clusters. The inhabitants were very poor and had only a few boats as they lacked wood for their construction. The site of the ancient town was overgrown with &quot;Capparis decidua&quot; bushes.

=== 21st century ===

On 31 March 2012, one day after the capture of Kidal, Malian military forces retreated from Gao&#x27;s military bases, allowing it to be occupied by Tuareg rebellion member groups MNLA and Ancar Dine. Timbuktu was captured the following day. On 6 April, the MNLA declared the region independent of Mali as the nation of Azawad. After the Battle of Gao on 26 and 27 June 2012, the MNLA lost control to Islamist militias.

After the 2012 rebellion forced the Malian Army out of Gao and the state of Azawad was proclaimed, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad took control of the governor&#x27;s building, flying the flag of Azawad over it and rechristening it the Palace of Azawad.

On 26 June 2012, the tension came to all-out combat in Gao between the MNLA and MOJWA, with both sides firing heavy weapons. MNLA Secretary General Bilal ag Acherif was wounded in the battle. The MNLA were soon driven from the city, and from Kidal and Timbuktu shortly after. However, the MNLA stated that it continued to maintain forces and control some rural areas in the region. The following day, Ansar Dine announced that it was in control of all the cities of northern Mali.

On 19 January 2013, it was reported that Gao journalist Kader Toure was killed after being suspected of working for foreign news services. In retaliation, the local youth are reported to have lynched Islamic police commissioner Aliou Toure who was recruited by MUWA, Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, who took control of the town in June 2012.

In January 2013 French warplanes bombed parts of Gao, including the airport, in an attempt to drive out fighters from the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa.

Gao was captured by French and Malian forces on 26 January 2013, as the Islamists were driven out from the city.

On 17 March 2015, a United Nations AH-64 helicopter crashed during an exercise near the town, killing both pilots. The AH-64 came from the Dutch Air Force&#x27;s Defense Helicopter Command.

On 18 January 2017, a suicide bomber from Al-Mourabitoun drove a vehicle filled with explosives into a military camp near Gao, killing 77 people and injuring at least 115 (see 2017 Gao bombing). The incident was the deadliest terrorist attack in Malian history.

== Culture ==
The population of Gao mostly speak Koyraboro Senni but includes many ethnicities, including the Bozo (traditionally nomadic river dwellers), Fulfulde/Fulani cattle keepers, and Tuareg nomads, Arabs as well as Bambara peoples from western Mali.

The seventh &quot;Festival des arts et cultures songhay&quot; was celebrated in February 2007 at Gao, reflecting the city&#x27;s importance as a Songhay cultural capital.

== Sites ==
Attractions in Gao include the original fourteenth century , the Askia Tomb (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) built in 1495 and incorporating another mosque, a museum devoted to the Sahel, markets including a night market, and La Dune Rose, a sand dune named after its appearance at dawn and nightfall.

===Mosques===
==== Regional patterns ====
The mosques of the Niger Bend and the pre-Saharan steppe form a group corresponding to the northern extremity of the Sahel, in direct contact with the desert. The main façade of the mosques of the Niger Bend is smooth, with no vertical elements, and terraces with merlons are rare. On the external façade, the mihrab forms a low projection ending in a conical point, but is not surmounted by a tower. Inside the mosque, the pillars are massive, there are no arcades and there are few mural decorations. Only the minaret stands out among these rather low buildings. In short, this group of mosques is mainly found in northern Mali and Niger and is the prerogative of the Songhay and Tuareg populations. It is characterised by a minaret, a low and projecting conical mihrab tower, the rarity of buttresses and battlements, and massive supports in the prayer hall, as in the mosques of Sankore and Sidi Yahya in Timbuktu and Tendirma in Mali.

==== The mosques of Gao ====
Once the centre of the Songhay Empire and a bustling trading centre, Gao boasts a rich historical heritage in its three urban settlements: Gao Saney, Old Gao and Gao. Excavations in Gao Saney,the oldest settlement east of the modern city, revealed a royal cemetery decorated with epitaphs and tombstones dating to 1104. Old Gao, built in the eighth to tenth centuries, coexisted with Gao Saney and served as an integral part of the city&#x27;s urban fabric.

In Old Gao, excavations. uncovered two monumental buildings dating from the early tenth century. One of these structures, believed to be a mosque, has dimensions that indicate its importance within the community. The dimensions of the mosque are approximately [insert dimensions here] and include architectural elements characteristic of the period. This mosque likely played a central role in the religious and cultural life of Old Gao, serving as a place of worship and community gathering.

Furthermore, the absence of a mihrab niche in this mosque suggests its possible use by early Muslim communities, possibly Ismailis or Ibadis, reflecting the diverse religious landscape of the region at the time. Dating from the late twelfth to fourteenth centuries, the mosque is one of the oldest mosques excavated in West Africa to date, providing valuable insights into the early spread of Islam in the region.

In addition, the mosque tomb of Askia Muhammad, built between 1493 and 1538, displays unique architectural elements and extensive dimensions. Covering an area of some 2500 m2, this large structure consisted of seven bays parallel to the qibla wall, with arcades resting on wide piers. The courtyard of the mosque, which was larger than the covered hall, had a minaret rising 12 metres in the centre. This distinctive minaret, decorated with toron, was similar to Ibn Tulun&#x27;s mosque in Cairo, highlighting the architectural influences that shaped Gao&#x27;s mosques during this period.

<text>Richard Kroner (8 March 1884 in Breslau – 2 November 1974 in Mammern) was a German neo-Hegelian philosopher, known for his &quot;Von Kant bis Hegel&quot; (1921/4), a classic history of German idealism written from the neo-Hegelian point of view. He was a Christian, from a Jewish background. He is known for his formulation of Hegel as &#x27;the Protestant Aquinas&#x27;.

In 1924 Victor Klemperer supported a call for Richard Kroner to a new chair for theoretical pedagogics and philosophy at Technische Hochschule Dresden, where he became friends with Paul Tillich.

Under Nazi legislation Kroner&#x27;s Jewish ancestry as well as his principled democratic stance led to his &quot;suspension&quot; (dismissal) from his university position at Kiel in 1934. He was replaced briefly by Hans-Georg Gadamer, a personal friend.

The American philosopher Otis Lee studied with Kroner for the academic year 1933–1934 and helped him escape to the United States and find a new academic position at Manhattan&#x27;s Union Theological Seminary.Kroner&#x27;s ideas on Hegel, including his slant via Kierkegaard, were taken up by some existentialist thinkers, including Lev Shestov and Nikolai Berdyaev.In 1952 Richard Kroner retired to Elkins Park, Pennsylvania before moving to Switzerland. He was awarded the Große Bundesverdienstkreuz.

The Kroners are buried at Richmond Cemetery.

<doc id="1255728" wikidata="Q1866347" url="?curid=1255728" title="Filo">
<text>Filo is a very thin unleavened dough used for making pastries such as baklava and &quot;börek&quot; in Middle Eastern and Balkan cuisines. Filo-based pastries are made by layering many sheets of filo brushed with oil or butter; the pastry is then baked.

==Name and etymology==

The name &quot;filo&quot; (phonetic) or phyllo (transliteration) comes from Greek &#x27;leaf&#x27;. In Arabic, it is called &quot;ruqaq&quot; or &quot;ruqaqat&quot;; in the Maghreb, warqa () which is different from regular filo dough. In Turkish, it is called yufka, &quot;thin&quot;.

==History==
The origin of the practice of stretching raw dough into paper-thin sheets is unclear, with many cultures claiming credit.

Most say that it was derived from the Greeks; Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, written around 800 BC, mentions thin breads sweetened with walnuts and honey. In the fifth century BC, Philoxenos states in his poem &quot;Dinner&quot; that, in the final drinking course of a meal, hosts would prepare and serve cheesecake made with milk and honey that was baked into a pie. It is also said to have been popular in the Byzantine Empire.

Some claim that the Turks also invented a form of filo/yufka independently in Central Asia; the 11th-century &quot;Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk&quot; by Mahmud Kashgari records the meaning of &quot;yurgha&quot;, an archaic term for &quot;yufka&quot;, as &quot;pleated or folded bread&quot;. Filo is documented in the Topkapı Palace in the Ottoman period.

==Preparation==

Filo dough is made with flour, water and a small amount of oil. Homemade filo takes time and skill, requiring progressive rolling and stretching to a single thin and very large sheet. A very big table is used, preferably with a marble top. If the dough is stretched by hand, a long, thin rolling pin is used, with continual flouring between layers to prevent the sheets from sticking to one another. In modern times, mechanical rollers are also used. Prior to World War I, households in Istanbul typically had two filo makers to prepare razor thin sheets for baklava, and the relatively thicker sheets used for &quot;börek&quot;. Fresh and frozen versions are prepared for commercial markets. In professional kitchens, maintaining filo’s delicate texture during preparation is crucial. In 1998, pastry chef and food historian Norman Lee Adler developed a method of layering filo with a fine mist of oil and covering it with a damp cloth, preventing it from drying out during extended handling. His technique has since been widely adopted in both artisan and commercial filo production, ensuring greater flexibility and ease of use.

==Use==

When using filo to make pastries, the thin layers are made by first rolling out the sheets of dough to the final thickness, then brushing them with oil, or melted butter for some desserts, and stacking them. This contrasts with puff pastry and croissant doughs, where the layers are stacked into a thick layer of dough, then folded and rolled out multiple times to produce a laminated dough containing thin layers of dough and fat.

Filo can be used in many ways: layered, folded, rolled, or ruffled, with various fillings.

<text>Tweenies is a British live-action puppet children&#x27;s television series created by Will Brenton and Iain Lauchlan, and produced by Tell-Tale Productions and the BBC. The programme was focused on four preschool-aged characters, known as the &quot;Tweenies&quot;; Bella, Milo, Fizz &amp; Jake, whilst playing, singing, dancing and learning in a fictional playgroup based in England. They are cared for by two adult Tweenies; Max &amp; Judy and their dogs; Doodles and Izzles.

&quot;Tweenies&quot; first premiered on September 6th, 1999 on the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s block and consisted of a total of 390 episodes, with the final episode airing on July 25th, 2002. Repeated episodes of the series aired on CBeebies from 2002 to 2016. In 2000, the show won a British Academy Television Award for Best Pre-school Live Action Series, and singles featuring exclusive songs spent several weeks in the charts during the early 2000s.

&quot;Tweenies&quot; also released music in the early 2000s and achieved five top 20 singles on the UK singles chart.

==Overview and history==
The idea for the programme came from Will Brenton and Iain Lauchlan, a pair with a track record of being involved in children&#x27;s programming for the BBC. Together they set up Tell-Tale Productions at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, in 1994. Lauchlan was a presenter on &quot;Play School&quot;, &quot;Fingermouse,&quot; and &quot;Playdays&quot;, meeting Brenton, a director, writer and also presenter, during the latter. Together they started producing two of the &quot;Playdays&quot; strands before forming Tell-Tale Productions (later rebranded as Wish Films). They also created &quot;Fun Song Factory&quot;, &quot;Boo!&quot;, &quot;BB3B&quot;, and &quot;Jim Jam and Sunny&quot;.

&quot;Tweenies&quot; is a production of Tell-Tale Productions in association with the BBC. Animation for the show was produced by A Productions, an animation studio based in Bristol, England, with Ealing Animation providing some animation in a few early episodes. Computer animation for the series was provided by &quot;Clockwork Digital&quot;, with Ben Mars animating Mungo, the computer creature who appears in some later episodes.

Episodes consist of a mixture of story, song, and creative activity. Music plays an important part in the programme and children are encouraged to join in with songs and actions.

The programme is set in a nursery in England attended by four puppet characters called The Tweenies: Jake, Fizz, Milo and Bella. They are in the care of two adult helpers, Max and Judy, and their dog, Doodles, later joined by another dog, Izzles.

There was also meant to be a character called Syd/Sid, however he was axed by the BBC before production, leaving the four other Tweenies.

The show includes a &quot;Tweenie Clock&quot;, with five circular lights arranged in a pentagonal shape with the lights denoting &quot;News Time&quot; (Circle Time in the US) – Orange, &quot;Messy Time&quot; – Blue, &quot;Song Time&quot; – Yellow, &quot;Telly Time&quot; (Video Time in the US) – Green and &quot;Story Time&quot; – Red. &quot;Surprise Time&quot; is a special time determined when all five lights glow. A button at the centre of the clock (Purple) is pressed to select the activity that will be undertaken next.

It was formerly shown and repeated on CBeebies, from 11 February 2002 until 1 April 2016. Like several other CBeebies programmes, a live stage version of the show has toured in the UK. The final tour, &quot;Top of the Tots&quot;, toured the UK during 2009 for the series&#x27; 10th anniversary. In addition, the tour also played several shows in Hong Kong in late September and early October 2009. The Tweenies were also regulars on the annual CBeebies Live tours around the British Isles. Between 2003 and 2005, there was also a &quot;Tweenies&quot; theme park, at Alton Towers in the Cred Street section aimed at younger children, which replaced the &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; section and was then replaced by a &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; section. In 2000, &quot;Tweenies&quot; won two awards: Best Pre-School Educational Program and Best Live Action Pre-School Programme.

The original prototypes for the Tweenies characters were designed by Sally Preisig of Mimics Productions; they were later re-scaled into two sizes for the characters shown in the series. In addition, Preisig also designed the character costumes and was co-constructor/developer for the Tweenies&#x27; full-size puppets. The costume fabric comes from the UK and was imported and dyed into their present colours; it is about the same thickness as fleece jumpers. Neal Scanlan Studios made the animatronic Tweenie heads.

==Characters==

===Main===
* Bella (operated by Tamsin Heatley, Emma Quintin, Esther Collins; voiced by Sally Preisig 1999–2000, Emma Weaver 2000–2002) – A five-year-old blue-skinned girl with blonde hair and a red hair bow. As the oldest and tallest of the Tweenies, Bella has a sense of superiority over her younger friends. She projects a bossy and boisterous attitude and likes to take the role of leadership in the Tweenies&#x27; games. Sometimes, she causes things to go wrong with her arrogance – for instance, in the episode &#x27;It Wasn&#x27;t Me&#x27;, Bella accidentally breaks one of the strings from Max&#x27;s marionette puppet despite everyone having been told not to play with it as it was &quot;special&quot;, and she hides it in Doodles&#x27; bed and tries to blame him. Despite this, she always apologises for her wrongdoings eventually. Although Bella comes across as domineering, she has a caring heart and likes to help the younger Tweenies. She loves acting, dressing up, fairies and reading. Her favourite colour is red. Her best friend is Fizz.
* Milo (operated by C.H. Beck 1999–2000, Matthew Lyons/Kate Ryan 2000–2002; voiced by Bob Golding) – a four-year-old purple-skinned boy with black hair. The loudmouth of the Tweenies, he is energetic and loves telling jokes and playing pranks. Sometimes his impulsiveness and hyperactivity may result in him upsetting the other Tweenies, but he is ultimately friendly and good-hearted. He is quick to argue with Bella due to their loud, clashing personalities. He often adds the suffix &quot;-a-rooney&quot; to words. He loves football and magic. His favourite colour is blue. His best friend is Jake.
* Fizz (operated by Jenny Hutchinson 1999–2000, Angela Reynolds 2000, Francesca Anderson 2001–2002; voiced by Colleen Daley) – A four-year-old yellow-skinned girl with reddish brown beaded hair. She is usually mild-mannered and laidback but can become stroppy when she doesn&#x27;t get her way. Fizz is somewhat introverted; when something upsets her, she often retreats to the playhouse for peace. She loves dancing (especially ballet), painting, singing and playing with dolls. Her favourite colour is pink. Her best friend is Bella.
* Jake (operated by Samantha Dodd 1999–2002; voiced by Justin Fletcher) – A three-year-old orange-skinned boy with a yellow mohawk. Being the youngest Tweenie, he sometimes feels left out and excluded from the other Tweenies&#x27; games when he is not big enough to join in. He is the kindest of the Tweenies and has a close bond with Doodles, often turning to him for comfort or advice when unhappy. He is also very sensitive and is prone to tears when frustrated. He will sometimes get words mixed up. He loves playing pretend, using his imagination, and dressing up, especially as his superhero alter-ego, Dotman. His favourite colour is green. His best friend is Milo.

===Supporting===
* Doodles (operated by Alan Riley and John Tobias; voiced by Justin Fletcher) – A red-and-yellow male dog. Doodles is very friendly, relaxed and calm. His favourite colour is yellow. His voice is based on that of Scooby-Doo. He loves going for walks with Max and can often be seen looking out for Jake.
* Izzles (operated by Fiona Watkins; voiced by Colleen Daley) – A purple-and-white female dog, who was first introduced in 2001. Unlike Doodles, she is a puppy and therefore much younger and very energetic. Her favourite colour is purple. At first, her antics were not to the Tweenies&#x27; liking, more so Jake but she later calms down and settles in. The girls often like to dress her up in fancy accessories. She is also a companion for Doodles. She was originally going to be called Squiggles until it was realised that someone already had the rights to that name and that small children find it hard to say &#x27;SQU&#x27;.
* Max (operated by Simon Grover/Matthew Lyons (some episodes); voiced by Bob Golding) – A 65-year-old pink-skinned man who is one of the two workers of the playgroup of the Tweenies. He speaks with a Yorkshire accent. He loves animals, trains, fixing different things around the playgroup, and exploring the outside world.
* Judy (operated by Simon Grover/Sinead Rushe (outside); voiced by Sinead Rushe) – A 35-year-old green-skinned woman who is the other of the playgroup workers. She speaks with an Irish accent. She loves reading, gardening, being creative and giving good advice to the Tweenies.

==Episodes==

The &quot;Tweenies&quot; aired its first episode &quot;Tweenie Band&quot; on 6 September 1999 on its original programme block CBBC and last aired on 25 July 2002 with &quot;What Makes Summer?&quot; on its former channel CBeebies. In total, there are 390 episodes. There have been special episodes, such as a series of &quot;Be Safe with the Tweenies&quot; and expanded forty-minute episodes.

Episode 252, &quot;Favourite Songs&quot; (first aired in March 2001) was withdrawn from further airing in January 2013, after the BBC received 216 complaints about a scene within the episode, themed as a parody of an episode of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; where Max appears dressed as disgraced host Jimmy Savile, and even uses some of his catchphrases. The episode aired three months after claims of sexual abuse committed by Savile came to light. The BBC removed &quot;Tweenies&quot; from the CBeebies schedule altogether for four months. The episodes then came back to the schedule from June 2013 until April 2016.

==Worldwide success==
From the show&#x27;s debut in 1999, the series enjoyed international success in France, Spain, Italy, Canada, Singapore and Australia. 

In the U.S., &quot;Tweenies&quot; was shown on Noggin between 2003 to 2005. Noggin showed a different version of the show where most characters are dubbed over with Canadian actors. This version also briefly aired on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nick Jr. block from 18 July to 25 September 2003.

The player controls Milo, Jake, Fizz and Bella through a series of 4 scenarios inspired by the show, one for each character.

The game was developed by Intelligent Games. The direction of the game was partially based on research by BBC Worldwide of children who watched the Television show, which found that &quot;singing and dancing are major factors in the success of the show&quot;. according to a BBC article from before the game launched.

<doc id="1255740" wikidata="Q781204" url="?curid=1255740" title="Clathrate compound">
<text>A clathrate is a chemical substance consisting of a lattice that traps or contains molecules. The word &quot;clathrate&quot; is derived from the Latin (), meaning &#x27;with bars, latticed&#x27;. Most clathrate compounds are polymeric and completely envelop the guest molecule, but in modern usage clathrates also include host–guest complexes and inclusion compounds. According to IUPAC, clathrates are inclusion compounds &quot;in which the guest molecule is in a cage formed by the host molecule or by a lattice of host molecules.&quot; The term refers to many molecular hosts, including calixarenes and cyclodextrins and even some inorganic polymers such as zeolites.

Clathrates can be divided into two categories: clathrate hydrates and inorganic clathrates. Each clathrate is made up of a framework and guests that reside the framework. Most common clathrate crystal structures can be composed of cavities such as dodecahedral, tetrakaidecahedral, and hexakaidecahedral cavities.

Unlike hydrates, inorganic clathrates have a covalently bonded framework of inorganic atoms with guests typically consisting of alkali or alkaline earth metals. Due to the stronger covalent bonding, the cages are often smaller than hydrates. Guest atoms interact with the host by ionic or covalent bonds. Therefore, partial substitution of guest atoms follow Zintl rules so that the charge of the overall compound is conserved. Most inorganic clathrates have full occupancy of its framework cages by a guest atom to be in stable phase. Inorganic clathrates can be synthesized by direct reaction using ball milling at high temperatures or high pressures. Crystallization from melt is another common synthesis route. Due to the wide variety of composition of host and guest species, inorganic clathrates are much more chemically diverse and possess a wide range of properties. Most notably, inorganic clathrates can be found to be both an insulator and a superconductor (Ba8Si46). A common property of inorganic clathrates that has attracted researchers is low thermal conductivity. Low thermal conductivity is attributed to the ability of the guest atom to &quot;rattle&quot; within the host framework. The freedom of movement of the guest atoms scatters phonons that transport heat.

== Examples ==
Clathrates have been explored for many applications including: gas storage, gas production, gas separation, desalination, thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and batteries.
* Clathrate compounds with formula &quot;A&quot;8&quot;B&quot;16&quot;X&quot;30, where &quot;A&quot; is an alkaline earth metal, &quot;B&quot; is a group III element, and &quot;X&quot; is an element from group IV have been explored for thermoelectric devices. Thermoelectric materials follow a design strategy called the &quot;phonon glass electron crystal&quot; concept. Low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity is desired to produce the Seebeck Effect. When the guest and host framework are appropriately tuned, clathrates can exhibit low thermal conductivity, i.e., &quot;phonon glass&quot; behavior, while electrical conductivity through the host framework is undisturbed allowing clathrates to exhibit &quot;electron crystal&quot;. 
* Methane clathrates feature the hydrogen-bonded framework contributed by water and the guest molecules of methane. Large amounts of methane naturally frozen in this form exist both in permafrost formations and under the ocean sea-bed. Other hydrogen-bonded networks are derived from hydroquinone, urea, and thiourea. A much studied host molecule is Dianin&#x27;s compound.

* Hofmann clathrates are coordination polymers with the formula Ni(CN)4·Ni(NH3)2(arene). These materials crystallize with small aromatic guests (benzene, certain xylenes), and this selectivity has been exploited commercially for the separation of these hydrocarbons. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) form clathrates.

<doc id="1255754" wikidata="Q263112" url="?curid=1255754" title="Catherine Eddowes">
<text>Catherine Eddowes (14 April 1842 – 30 September 1888) was the fourth of the canonical five victims of the notorious unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, who is believed to have killed and mutilated a minimum of five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London from late August to early November 1888.

Eddowes was murdered in the early hours of Sunday 30 September within the City of London. She was the second woman killed within an hour; the night having already seen the murder of Elizabeth Stride within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Police. These two murders are commonly referred to as the &quot;double event&quot;; a term which originates from the content of the &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard received at the Central News Agency on 1 October.

A part of a left human kidney, accompanied by a letter addressed &quot;From Hell&quot; and postmarked 15 October, was later sent to the chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, George Lusk. The author of this letter claimed the section of kidney was from Eddowes, whose left kidney had been removed, and that he had fried and eaten the other half. Most experts, however, do not believe this kidney actually originated from Eddowes&#x27;s body.

==Early life==
Catherine Eddowes was born in Graiseley Green, Wolverhampton on 14 April 1842, the sixth of twelve children born to tinplate worker George Eddowes and his wife, Catherine (&quot;née&quot; Evans), who worked as a cook at the Peacock Hotel.

The family moved to London a year after Eddowes&#x27;s birth, where her father obtained employment with a firm named Perkins and Sharpus in Bell Court, within the City of London. The family initially resided at 4 Baden Place, Bermondsey, and later relocated to 35 West Street. Here, Eddowes was educated at St. John&#x27;s Charity School in Potter&#x27;s Field. By 1851, the family had relocated to 35 West Street. Her mother ultimately bore eleven other children, although only ten of her twelve children survived. She herself died of tuberculosis on 17 November 1855 at the age of 42.

By 1857, both of Eddowes&#x27;s parents had died, resulting in Eddowes (then aged 15) and three of her siblings being admitted as orphans to a Bermondsey workhouse. All four Eddowes siblings admitted to this workhouse attended a local industrial school in efforts to teach them a trade. Via this initiative, one of Eddowes&#x27;s older sisters, Emma, and an aunt secured employment for her as a tinplate stamper at the Old Hall Works in Wolverhampton. She relocated to Wolverhampton, residing with her aunt in Bilston Street and working at the Old Hall Works as she continued her education at Dowgate Charity School.

Within months of obtaining this employment, Eddowes was fired from her job, possibly after being caught stealing. The fact Eddowes lost her employment is believed to have caused tensions between her and her aunt, as shortly thereafter, she relocated from Wolverhampton to Birmingham, where she briefly lived with an uncle named Thomas Eddowes, who worked as a shoemaker. Eddowes soon found employment as a tray polisher at a firm in Legge Street in Birmingham, although after approximately four months, she chose to return to Wolverhampton, where she resided with her grandfather, who found work for her as a tinplate stamper. Nine months later, she again moved to Birmingham.

Eddowes was tall, slim, with dark, wavy auburn hair and hazel eyes. Friends later described her as &quot;a very jolly woman, always singing&quot; and an &quot;intelligent and scholarly [individual], but possessed of a fierce temper.&quot;

==Relationships==
===Thomas Conway===
While residing in Birmingham, Eddowes began a relationship with former soldier Thomas Conway, who had served in the 18th Royal Irish Regiment and who received a small regimental pension. The couple had two children: Catherine Ann (b. 1863); and Thomas Lawrence (b. 1867), and initially supported themselves by occasionally via labouring work when his health permitted. No evidence exists to support the two having actually married following their initial acquaintance in 1861 or 1862, although shortly after the two began a relationship, Eddowes began referring to herself as &quot;Kate Conway&quot;. She later had Conway&#x27;s initials (&quot;TC&quot;) crudely tattooed in blue ink on her left forearm.

====Relocation to London====
In 1868, Eddowes and Conway moved to London, taking lodgings in Westminster. Their third child and second son was born in 1873. While residing in London, Eddowes took to drinking, which caused rifts within her immediate family. According to later inquest testimony from Eddowes&#x27;s daughter, Catherine &quot;Annie&quot; Phillips, her parents began living on &quot;bad terms&quot; largely because of her mother&#x27;s drinking which increased throughout the 1870s and which her father—a teetotaler—found intolerable. By the late 1870s, the quarrels between the two are believed to have become violent, with Eddowes occasionally being seen with black eyes and bruising about her face.

By 1880, Eddowes and Conway resided in a room at 71 Lower George Street, Chelsea, with their two youngest children (their oldest child had left the household by this date). Sometime the same year, she left her husband.

The precise reason why Eddowes chose to relocate from Chelsea to the East End of London is unknown, although by 1881, she was living with a new partner, John Kelly; a fruit salesman whom she had met as both lodged at Cooney&#x27;s common lodging-house at 55 Flower and Dean Street, Spitalfields, at the centre of London&#x27;s most notorious criminal rookery. Thereafter, she became known to acquaintances as &quot;Kate Kelly&quot;. The deputy of this lodging-house, Frederick William Wilkinson, later stated Eddowes seldom drank to excess, although contemporary records indicate she was brought before Thames Magistrates&#x27; Court upon a charge of being drunk and disorderly in September 1881. She was discharged without being fined for this offence.

Initially, while living in and around Spitalfields, Eddowes most often earned money by performing domestic work such as cleaning and sewing for the Jewish community in nearby Brick Lane, although she is believed to have also occasionally taken to casual prostitution to pay her daily rent. By the mid 1880s, she and Kelly also earned money by performing seasonal hop-picking work in Kent each summer.

When Eddowes could not afford a bed in a common lodging-house, she typically attempted to borrow money from her sisters or her daughter. She primarily attempted to borrow from her older sister, Elizabeth Fisher, who lived in Greenwich, and whom she also visited socially on occasion. If unsuccessful in her efforts to borrow money from relatives, she is believed to have slept rough in the front room of 26 Dorset Street, known locally as &quot;the shed&quot;.

==September 1888==
In September 1888, Eddowes and Kelly followed their annual practice of taking casual work hop-picking in the village of Hunton, Kent. En route to Hunton, Eddowes purchased a jacket from a pawnshop and Kelly a pair of boots from a shop in Maidstone. While partaking in this casual work, the two became acquainted with a woman named Emily Birrell and her common-law husband; the four sleeping in the same barn.

At harvest&#x27;s end, Eddowes and Kelly returned to London on foot with Birrell and her common-law husband, although they parted company midway as Birrell and her partner intended to travel to Cheltenham as opposed to London. Prior to parting company with Birrell, Eddowes was handed a pawn ticket by Birrell, who said to her: &quot;I have got a pawn ticket for a flannel shirt. I wish you&#x27;d take it since you&#x27;re going [to London]. It is only for 9d, and it may fit your old man.&quot; Eddowes placed this ticket inside a small mustard tin she carried.

The two reached London on 27 September, spending the night in the casual ward at Shoe Lane in the City of London. The two slept in separate lodging-houses the following evening: Kelly sleeping at 52 Flower and Dean Street; Eddowes at the Mile End Casual Ward. Reportedly, upon her arrival at the casual ward, the superintendent asked Eddowes (who had frequently slept at the premises) where she had recently been, to which Eddowes replied she had been hop-picking. Eddowes then added she intended to claim the reward offered for the arrest of the Whitechapel murderer, adding, &quot;I think I know him.&quot;

By the following day, the two had spent almost all their earnings. At 8 a.m. on 29 September, Eddowes and Kelly convened at Cooney&#x27;s common lodging-house on Flower and Dean Street, where they ate breakfast before purchasing some tea and sugar. The two then agreed to split their last sixpence between them; he took fourpence to pay for a bed in the common lodging-house, and she took twopence, just enough for her to stay a further night at Mile End Casual Ward in the neighbouring parish.

===29 September===
In the early afternoon of 29 September, Eddowes informed Kelly of her intentions to travel to Bermondsey to attempt to borrow some money from her daughter, who by 1888 had been married to a gun-maker in Southwark for three years. The two parted company in Houndsditch at about 2 p.m., with Eddowes informing Kelly that she expected to return by 4 p.m. With money from pawning his boots, a bare-footed Kelly took a bed at the lodging-house just after 8 p.m., and according to the deputy keeper, he remained there all night.

At 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September, PC Louis Frederick Robinson observed a small group of people converged outside number 29 Aldgate High Street. Approaching the crowd, he observed Eddowes lying drunk on the pavement. Robinson assisted Eddowes to her feet and leaned her against the shutters of the house, although she rapidly slumped back to the pavement. Summoning the assistance of PC George Simmons, the two took her into custody at Bishopsgate Police Station, to be detained until she was sober enough to leave. Upon arrival, Eddowes gave her name as &quot;Nothing&quot; and within twenty minutes, she had fallen asleep in a cell.

Shortly after 12:30 a.m. on the morning of 30 September, Eddowes asked PC George Hutt when she could be released. In response, Hutt replied: &quot;When you are capable of taking care of yourself.&quot; Thirty minutes later, at 1:00 a.m., Eddowes was deemed sober enough to be released, stating to Hutt as he escorted her to the entrance of Bishopsgate Police Station, &quot;All right. Good night, old cock.&quot;
Prior to her release, Eddowes gave her name and address to Hutt as &quot;Mary Ann Kelly of 6 Fashion Street&quot;.

===30 September===
Upon leaving the station, instead of turning right to take the shortest route to her Flower and Dean Street lodging-house, Eddowes turned left in the general direction of Aldgate. She was last seen alive in a narrow walkway named Church Passage at 1:35 a.m. by three witnesses: Joseph Lawende; Joseph Hyam Levy; and Harry Harris, who themselves had just left the Imperial Club in Duke&#x27;s Place on Duke Street.

Lawende later testified Eddowes—wearing a black bonnet and jacket—was standing talking with a man of medium build with a fair moustache at the entrance to Church Passage, which led south-west from Duke Street and into Mitre Square. She was facing the man, with one hand on his chest, although not in a manner to suggest to Lawende she was resisting him. Only Lawende could furnish a clear description of the man, whom he described as approximately thirty, about in height and wearing a loose-fitting &quot;pepper and salt colour loose jacket&quot;, a grey peaked cloth cap and a &quot;reddish&quot; neckerchief. To Lawende, this individual conveyed the overall appearance of a sailor. Lawende walked past the two and did not look back.

==Murder==
At 1:44 a.m., Eddowes&#x27;s mutilated and disembowelled body was found lying on her back, with her head resting on a coal hole and turned towards the left shoulder, in the south-west corner of Mitre Square by the square&#x27;s beat policeman, PC Edward Watkins, approximately fourteen minutes after he had previously passed through the square at 1:30 a.m. Upon discovering Eddowes&#x27;s body, Watkins called for assistance from the night watchman at the Kearley and Tonge warehouse which bordered Mitre Square: ex-policeman George James Morris. Morris had been sweeping the landings inside the warehouse, with the door to the square open, when Watkins knocked on the door, exclaiming: &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, mate, come to my assistance!&quot; After viewing the body, he informed Watkins he had noted nothing unusual that evening.
Another watchman based at 5 Mitre Square, George Clapp, and an off-duty policeman who lived at 3 Mitre Square, Richard Pearse, later reported also having seen and heard nothing untoward. Furthermore, another policeman whose beat required his walking close to Mitre Square, PC James Harvey, had also walked down Church Passage from Duke Street very shortly after Watkins had first passed through the square at 1:30 a.m., although his beat took him back down Church Passage and onto Duke Street without actually entering the square. Harvey had also seen nothing out of the ordinary. He was one of the first policeman to arrive at the crime scene in response to Morris&#x27;s police whistle.

Another policeman to arrive in Mitre Square in response to Morris&#x27;s whistle, PC Holland, immediately summoned local surgeon George William Sequeira to the scene. Sequeira arrived at the scene at 1:55 a.m. Within minutes, police surgeon Frederick Gordon Brown had also arrived at the crime scene.

===Goulston Street graffito===
At approximately 2:55 a.m. on 30 September, a blood-stained fragment of Eddowes&#x27;s apron was discovered at the bottom of a common stairway at a tenement in Goulston Street, Whitechapel by PC Alfred Long. This section of apron was also contaminated with sections of fecal matter, and Long was adamant the garment had not lain in the doorway when he had previously passed this location at 2:20 a.m. Scrawled upon the wall above the section of apron was a crude chalk graffito—the letters measuring approximately three-quarters of an inch—commonly held to have read: &quot;The Juwes are the men that Will not be Blamed for nothing&quot;.

The message appeared to imply that a Jew or Jews in general were responsible for the series of murders, although it is unclear whether the graffito was actually written by the murderer upon dropping the section of apron, or was merely present at the location. Antisemitic graffiti was commonplace in and around Whitechapel. Although the City of London Police believed the graffito should be photographed, fearing potential antisemitic riots should members of the public view the writing at daybreak, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Charles Warren, ordered the graffito washed from the wall at approximately 5 a.m. Nonetheless, the words—including all grammatical errors—were copied before they were washed off the wall.

==Post-mortem==
The subsequent post-mortem records of Frederick Gordon Brown—who arrived at the crime scene shortly after 2:00 a.m.—state:

Brown conducted the post-mortem upon Eddowes&#x27;s body that afternoon, noting:


===Disputed anatomical knowledge===
Although George Bagster Phillips—who had been invited to attend Eddowes&#x27;s autopsy—agreed with Brown that the degree of anatomical knowledge of the individual who had performed the mutilations and eviscerations upon Eddowes &quot;gave no evidence of anatomical knowledge in the sense that it evidenced the hand of a qualified surgeon&quot;, he concurred the perpetrator may have held the degree of knowledge expected of a butcher or slaughterman. However, police physician Thomas Bond disagreed with Brown&#x27;s assessment of the degree of the perpetrator&#x27;s anatomical skill. Bond&#x27;s report to police stated: &quot;In each case the mutilation was inflicted by a person who had no scientific nor anatomical knowledge. In my opinion he does not even possess the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer or any person accustomed to cut up dead animals.&quot;

George Sequeira, the first doctor at the crime scene, and City medical officer William Sedgwick Saunders, who was also present at the autopsy, also opined that the killer lacked anatomical skill and did not seek particular organs.

==Inquest==
The official inquest into Eddowes&#x27;s death was opened in the inquest hall adjacent to the City of London Mortuary on the afternoon of 4 October. This inquest was presided over by the coroner for the City of London, Samuel F. Langham.

The first day of the inquest heard testimony from seven witnesses, including one of Eddowes&#x27;s sisters, Eliza Gold, who testified she had positively identified the decedent as her sister and that she had last seen Eddowes &quot;three or four weeks&quot; prior to the inquest, when she (Eddowes) had made a point of visiting her when she had been ill.

===Character testimony===
John Kelly also testified on the first day of the inquest; he also positively identified the decedent as &quot;Catherine Conway&quot;, adding he had lived with her for seven years, and he had last seen her alive at &quot;about two o&#x27;clock&quot; on 29 September. Kelly also testified Eddowes typically earned her living by hawking goods, that she never lived &quot;by immoral purposes&quot;, and that she seldom drank.

Also to testify on the first day of the inquest were the deputy of Cooney&#x27;s common lodging-house, Frederick Wilkinson, who stated he had known Eddowes for approximately seven years, and that she lived &quot;on good terms&quot; with Kelly. Wilkinson confirmed Eddowes typically returned to the lodging-house in the early evening. His testimony was followed by the policeman who found Eddowes&#x27;s body, Edward Watkins, who testified his beat typically took &quot;twelve to fourteen minutes&quot; to complete, and that when he had passed through Mitre Square at 1:30 a.m. nothing had been amiss. Watkins then described his actions upon discovering the body fifteen minutes later, and stated he was adamant nothing could have escaped his attention in the square.

Frederick Foster, an architect who had produced a plan of Mitre Square following Eddowes&#x27;s murder, then testified that an individual could walk from Berner Street (site of the murder of Elizabeth Stride) to Mitre Street in twelve minutes. His testimony was followed by that of an Inspector Collard of the City Police, who described responding to the crime scene, the subsequent actions of police, and his accompanying Drs Sequeira and Brown to the Golden Lane mortuary in the presence of Eddowes&#x27;s body.

===Medical testimony===
The final witness to testify on the first day of the inquest was Brown (who also testified on the second day of the inquest). Brown stated his belief that Eddowes had died very quickly as a result of haemorrhaging to her carotid artery resulting from the cut to her throat as she lay on the ground, and that death had occurred thirty to forty minutes prior to his arrival in Mitre Square at about 2:20 a.m. The mutilations to Eddowes&#x27;s body had all been inflicted with a knife at least six inches in length after death, with the perpetrator most likely kneeling at the right side of Eddowes&#x27;s body as he inflicted them. Brown further testified the perpetrator &quot;must have had a good deal of knowledge as to the position of the abdominal organs, and the way of removing them.&quot;

Following Brown&#x27;s testimony, proceedings were adjourned until Thursday 11 October. Fifteen witnesses testified on this date, including George Sequeira, who testified to being the first medical individual to arrive at the crime scene. Sequeira corroborated Brown&#x27;s earlier testimony, although he added his opinion the perpetrator &quot;was not possessed of any great anatomical skill&quot;. Sequeira&#x27;s testimony was followed by that of a medical officer named William Saunders, who testified no trace of poison existed in Eddowes&#x27;s body.

===Further witnesses===
Eddowes&#x27;s daughter, Catherine Phillips, then testified as to the acrimonious relationship between her parents, adding she had not seen her father for over a year, and her mother for two years prior to her murder. Phillips added she had purposely kept her address a secret from her mother due to her frequently &quot;applying for money&quot; from her.

Four police officers then testified in succession. Three of these individuals testified as to their finding the decedent drunk on Aldgate High Street, her being brought to Bishopsgate Police Station, and subsequent release in the early hours of 30 September. Their testimony was followed by that of George Morris, who testified as to being informed by PC Watkins of his discovery in Mitre Square, stating: &quot;The constable said, &#x27;For God&#x27;s sake, mate, come to my assistance.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Stop till I get my lamp. What is the matter?&#x27; &#x27;Oh, dear,&#x27; he exclaimed, &#x27;here is another woman cut to pieces.&#x27;&quot; Morris emphasised he had heard nothing amiss that evening and that, had Eddowes elicited a shout or scream, he would have heard. This testimony was then corroborated by PC James Harvey, who testified that, although his own beat did not take him beyond Church Passage, he had &quot;not seen anyone nor heard a cry&quot; until hearing Morris&#x27;s police whistle.

Following the testimony of watchman George Clapp and City constable Richard Pearce (who resided at 3 Mitre Square), Joseph Lawende testified to having &quot;observed a man and woman together at the corner of Church Passage ... leading to Mitre Square&quot; approximately &quot;nine or ten feet&quot; from him. Lawende testified he had provided a description of the individual he had seen in Eddowes&#x27;s company, although he doubted he would be able to recognise this individual again. Lawende&#x27;s testimony was followed by Joseph Levy, who confirmed the time he, Lawende and Harris had passed the two individuals at the corner of Church Passage, although Levy stated nothing about the two aroused any suspicion within him.

PC Alfred Long then testified to finding a &quot;portion of white apron&quot; at the doorway to numbers 106-119 Goulston Street, and the graffito upon the wall above, which he had noted in his pocket-book. Long stated he had searched the property within minutes of this discovery, finding nothing amiss, before proceeding to the police station, leaving another constable who had arrived at the scene to &quot;keep observation on the dwelling house, and see if any one entered or left.&quot;

The final witness to testify, Detective Constable Daniel Halse, testified as to his issuing instructions &quot;for the neighbourhood to be searched and every man stopped and examined&quot; upon learning of Eddowes&#x27;s murder. Halse also testified that, having proceeded to Goulston Street and viewed the graffito, he had heard gossip among police officers that the word &quot;Juwes&quot; should be erased from the wall and the remainder of the inscription remain, stating: &quot;The fear on the part of the Metropolitan Police [was] that the writing might cause riot was the sole reason why [the graffito] was rubbed out.&quot; Halse also testified the graffito—&quot;written with white chalk on a black facia&quot;—was recently inscribed.

==Conclusion==
The inquest into Eddowes&#x27;s murder lasted two days, with the final day of hearings having been adjourned until 11 October. Following a short deliberation, the jury, having been instructed to consider precisely how, when, and by what means Eddowes came about her death, returned a verdict of wilful murder against some person unknown. Each of the jurors agreed to present their fees to Eddowes&#x27;s daughter.
==Investigation==
Due to the location of Mitre Square, the City of London Police, under the command of Detective Inspector James McWilliam, joined the existing Metropolitan Police manhunt to identify and apprehend the perpetrator. A house-to-house search was conducted by the City Police but nothing suspicious or of use to the enquiry was discovered.

A small mustard tin containing two pawn tickets was discovered among Eddowes&#x27;s personal possessions. One ticket had been issued on 31 August to one Emily Birell in relation to a flannel shirt; the other to a Church Street pawnbroker named Smith, issued on 29 September, to one Jane Kelly in relation to a pair of boots. Published details of these tickets led to John Kelly identifying the decedent as his common-law wife on 2 October after he read reports pertaining to the pawn tickets and the distinctive tattoo upon the victim&#x27;s left forearm in the newspapers. His identification was soon confirmed by Catherine Eddowes&#x27;s older sister, Eliza Gold. No money was found on her. Though the murder occurred within the City of London, it was close to the boundary of Whitechapel where the previous Whitechapel murders had occurred. The mutilation of Eddowes&#x27;s body and the abstraction of her left kidney and part of her womb by her murderer bore the signature of Jack the Ripper and was very similar in nature to that of earlier victim Annie Chapman.

Mitre Square had three connecting streets: Church Passage to the north-east, Mitre Street to the south-west, and St James&#x27;s Place to the north-west. As PC Harvey had seen no-one exiting from Church Passage, and PC Watkins saw no-one the square from Mitre Street, the murderer must have left the square northwards through St James&#x27;s Place towards Goulston Street, where he had dropped the section of Eddowes&#x27;s blood-stained shawl.

Goulston Street was within a quarter of an hour&#x27;s walk from Mitre Square, on a direct route to Flower and Dean Street where Eddowes had lodged, indicating that her murderer likely also resided nearby and had headed in the direction of his home after the killing. The graffito found above the shawl may or may not have been related to the murder, but either way it was washed away before dawn on the orders of Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Charles Warren, who had feared that, should members of the public see the inscription, anti-Jewish riots may ensue.

Major Henry Smith, acting Commissioner of the City Police, claimed in his memoirs to have discovered bloodied water in a public sink in a court off Dorset Street, and as the water was slowly running out of the basin, he calculated that the Ripper had been there only moments before. Ripper author Martin Fido thought it unlikely that the culprit would wait to wash his hands in a semi-public place about forty minutes after the crime, and Smith&#x27;s memoirs are both unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect. There is no mention of the sink in the official police reports.

==Correspondence==
===&quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard===
On 1 October, a postcard, dubbed the &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard and signed &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, was received by the Central News Agency. The author claimed responsibility for the murders of both Stride and Eddowes the previous day, describing the killing of the two women as the &quot;double event&quot;; a designation which has endured. It has been argued that the postcard was mailed before the murders were publicised, making it unlikely that a crank would have such knowledge of the crime, but this correspondence was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings took place—long after all details were known by journalists and residents of the area.

Police officials later claimed to have identified a London-based journalist as the author of this postcard, which they dismissed as a hoax; an assessment shared by most Ripper historians—many of whom believe that all correspondence received in the manhunt for the Ripper was fabricated by journalists and/or the public in general.

===&quot;From Hell&quot; letter===
On 16 October 1888, a cubical parcel measuring three-and-a-half inches containing half a preserved human kidney was received by the Chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, George Lusk. This parcel was accompanied by a note, known as both the &quot;Lusk letter&quot; and the &quot;From Hell&quot; letter because of the phrase &quot;from hell&quot; used by the writer as the address of origin. The author of this letter claimed to have &quot;fried and ate&quot; the missing kidney half. The handwriting and style were unlike that of the &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard, as the general linguistic characteristics of this letter indicated the author was either Irish, of Irish extraction, or intentionally intending to mimic Irish pronunciations.

====Human kidney====
The kidney was taken to Thomas Horrocks Openshaw at the nearby London Hospital. Openshaw believed that the kidney was human, originated from the left side of the body, and that the organ had been preserved in spirits prior to being posted to Lusk on 15 October. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on 19 October that Openshaw had described the specimen as a recent &quot;ginny kidney&quot; from a 45-year-old female. However, the &quot;Star&quot; reported the same day that Openshaw denied the report strongly, saying it was impossible to detect the age or gender of the individual whom the kidney had belonged to, or how long the organ had been preserved in spirits.

Major Henry Smith claimed in his memoirs that the kidney received by Lusk matched the one missing from Eddowes, because the length of renal artery attached to the kidney matched the missing length from the body, and both the body and kidney showed signs of Bright&#x27;s disease. Smith&#x27;s later recollection does not match the medical reports submitted by the examining pathologists or the police records. Police surgeon Brown said that the kidney had been trimmed up, and that the renal artery was entirely absent. Metropolitan police memos state that the kidney could have come from any body, such as those found in a hospital morgue.

Smith&#x27;s account is thought by historians to be dramatic licence on his part; the kidney itself could have been sent to Lusk as a medical student&#x27;s prank. Saunders, who attended Eddowes&#x27;s post-mortem, later stated to the press, &quot;the right kidney of the woman Eddowes was perfectly normal in its structure and healthy ... my opinion is that it was a student&#x27;s antic.&quot; Chief Inspector Donald Swanson, who co-ordinated the inquiry, wrote: &quot;similar kidneys might and could be obtained from any dead person upon whom a post-mortem had been made for any cause, by students or dissecting room porter.&quot;
==Funeral==
Catherine Eddowes was buried on the afternoon of Monday, 8 October 1888. She was laid to rest in an unmarked public grave at #49336, square 318 in the City of London Cemetery in a service conducted by a Reverend Dunscombe. Her coffin was of polished elm, and bore a plate inscribed with the words &quot;Catherine Eddowes, died Sept. 30, 1888, aged 43 years.&quot;

Numerous people lined the streets as the cortège—consisting of an open glass hearse drawn by horses—began the procession from the Golden Lane mortuary to the cemetery at precisely 1:30 p.m. A mourning coach containing John Kelly, four of Eddowes&#x27;s sisters, and two of her nieces followed the coffin. An estimated 500 people were present as the coffin arrived at the City of London Cemetery prior to interment.

Today, the section of the cemetery where Eddowes was interred has been re-used for part of the Memorial Gardens for cremated remains. Eddowes lies beside the Garden Way in front of Memorial Bed #1849. In late 1996, the cemetery authorities decided to formally mark Eddowes&#x27;s grave with a plaque.

==Later developments==
In 2014, mitochondrial DNA matching that of one of Eddowes&#x27;s descendants was extracted from an 8-foot section of shawl said to have come from the scene of her murder. The actual source of the stains upon the shawl used in the testing could not be definitively classified, although they are hypothesized to source from blood spatter and, in one instance, possibly to semen. The DNA on the shawl believed to originate from traces of semen matched DNA from a descendant of Ripper suspect Aaron Kosminski. This match was also based on a segment of mitochondrial DNA, although no information was given that would enable the commonness of the sequence to be estimated.

The shawl in question is alleged to have been retrieved by a policeman investigating the scene of Eddowes&#x27;s murder, and subsequently handed down successive family generations before being presented to Scotland Yard&#x27;s Crime Museum in 1991. Unsure of the garment&#x27;s authenticity, Scotland Yard never placed the shawl on display within the museum.

The alleged DNA match was based on one of seven small segments taken from the hypervariable regions within the DNA. The segment contained a sequence variation described as 314.1C, and claimed to be uncommon, with a frequency of only one in 290,000 worldwide. However, Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys and others pointed out this was in fact an error in nomenclature for the common sequence variation 315.1C, which is present in more than 99% of the sequences in the EMPOP database.

The owner of the shawl, British author and amateur sleuth Russell Edwards, has since claimed these forensic results prove Kosminski was Jack the Ripper. He is quoted as saying: &quot;Seven years after I bought the shawl, we had nailed Aaron Kosminski.&quot; However, other experts strongly disagree. Donald Rumbelow criticized Edwards&#x27; claims, saying that no shawl is listed among Eddowes&#x27;s personal effects by the police, and that the policeman who allegedly retrieved the garment was based in North London in 1888, thus making him unlikely to have been present at any of the crime scenes.

Archaeological geneticists have also stated the forensic techniques utilised in reaching this conclusion are neither new nor scientifically accurate. Mitochondrial DNA expert Peter Gill has also stated the shawl &quot;is of dubious origin and has been handled by several people who could have shared that mitochondrial DNA profile.&quot; Two of Eddowes&#x27;s descendants are also known to have been in the same room as the shawl for three days shortly after Edwards had purchased the garment in 2007. In the words of one critic, &quot;The shawl has been openly handled by loads of people and been touched, breathed on, spat upon. My DNA is probably on there. What&#x27;s more, Kosminski is likely to have frequented prostitutes in the East End of London. ... If I examined that shawl, I&#x27;d probably find links to 150 other men from the area.&quot;
