<text>Guge (; ) was an ancient dynastic kingdom in Western Tibet. The kingdom was centered in present-day Zanda County, Ngari Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region. At various points in history after the 10th century AD, the kingdom held sway over a vast area including south-eastern Zanskar, Kinnaur district, and Spiti Valley, either by conquest or as tributaries. The ruins of the former capital of the Guge kingdom are located at Tsaparang in the Sutlej valley, not far from Mount Kailash and west from Lhasa.

==History==
=== Founding ===
Guge was founded in the 10th century. Its capitals were located at Tholing and Tsaparang. Kyide Nyimagon, a great-grandson of Langdarma, the last monarch of the Tibetan Empire, fled to Ngari (West Tibet) from the insecure conditions in Ü-Tsang in 910. He established a kingdom around 912, annexing Purang and Guge. He established his capital in Guge.

Nyimagon later divided his lands into three parts. The king&#x27;s eldest son Palgyigon became ruler of Maryul (Ladakh), his second son Trashigon (&quot;bKra shis mgon&quot;) received Guge-Purang, and the third son Detsukgon received Zanskar.

=== Second diffusion of Buddhism ===

Trashigon was succeeded by his son &quot;Srong nge&quot; or Yeshe-Ö (&quot;Ye shes &#x27;Od&quot;) (947–1024 or (959–1036), who was a renowned Buddhist figure. In his time a Tibetan lotsawa from Guge called Rinchen Zangpo (958–1055), after having studied in India, returned to his homeland as a monk to promote Buddhism. Together with the zeal of Yeshe-Ö, this marked the beginning of a new diffusion of Buddhist teachings in western Tibet. In 988 Yeshe-Ö took religious vows and left kingship to his younger brother &quot;Khor re&quot;.

According to later historiography, the Turkic Karluks (&quot;Gar log&quot;) took the Yeshe-Ö prisoner in a war. The episode has a prominent place in Tibetan history writing. The Karluks offered to set him free if he renounced Buddhism, which he refused to do. They then demanded his weight in gold to release him. His junior kinsman &quot;Byang chub &#x27;Od&quot; visited him in his prison with a small retinue, but &quot;Yeshe-Ö&quot; admonished him not to use the gold at hand for ransom, but rather to invite the renowned Mahayana sage Atiśa (982–1054). &quot;Yeshe-Ö&quot; eventually died in prison from age and poor treatment. The story is historically debated since it contains chronological inconsistencies.

=== Successions ===

In 1037, &quot;Khor re&quot;&#x27;s eldest grandson &quot;&#x27;Od lde&quot; was killed in a conflict with the Kara-Khanid Khanate from Central Asia, who subsequently ravaged Ngari. His brother &quot;Byang chub &#x27;Od&quot; (984–1078), a Buddhist monk, took power as secular ruler. He was responsible for inviting Atiśa to Tibet in 1040 and thus ushering in the so-called &quot;Chidar&quot; (Phyi-dar) phase of Buddhism in Tibet. &quot;Byang chub &#x27;Od&quot;&#x27;s son &quot;rTse lde&quot; was murdered by his nephew in 1088. This event marked the break-up of the Guge-Purang kingdom, since one of his brothers was established as separate king of Purang. The usurping nephew &quot;dBang lde&quot; continued the royal dynasty in Guge.

A new Kara-Khanid invasion of Guge took place before 1137 and cost the life of the ruler, &quot;bKra shis rtse&quot;. Later in the same century the kingdom was temporarily divided. In 1240 the Mongol khagan, at least nominally, gave authority over the Ngari area to the Drigung Monastery in Ü-Tsang.

&quot;Grags pa lde&quot; was an important ruler who united the Guge area around 1265 and subjugated the related Ya rtse (Khasa) kingdom. After his death in 1277 Guge was dominated by the Sakya monastic regime. After 1363, with the decline of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and their Sakya protégés, Guge was again strengthened and took over Purang in 1378. Purang was henceforth contested between Guge and Mustang, but was finally integrated into the former. Guge also briefly ruled over Ladakh in the late 14th century. From 1499 the Guge king had to acknowledge the Rinpungpa rulers of Tsang. The 15th and 16th centuries were marked by a considerable Buddhist building activity by the kings, who frequently showed their devotion to the Gelug leaders later known as the Dalai Lamas.

=== Ladakhi invasions ===

The first Westerners to reach Guge were António de Andrade, a Jesuit missionary, and his companion brother Manuel Marques, in 1624. De Andrade reported seeing irrigation canals and rich crops in what is now a dry and desolate land. Perhaps as evidence of the kingdom&#x27;s openness, de Andrade&#x27;s party was allowed to construct a chapel in Tsaparang and instruct the people about Catholic Christianity. A letter by De Andrade relates that some military commanders revolted and called the Ladakhis to overthrow the ruler. There had been friction between Guge and Ladakh for many years, and the invitation was heeded in 1630. The Ladakhi forces laid siege to the almost impenetrable Tsaparang. The King&#x27;s brother, who was chief lama and thus a staunch Buddhist, advised the pro-Christian ruler to surrender against keeping the state as tributary ruler. This treacherous advice was eventually accepted. Tibetan sources suggest that the Guge population was maintained in their old status. The last king, Tashi Drakpa De, (&quot;Khri bKra shis Grags pa lde&quot;) and his brother and other kin, were deported to Ladakh, where they lived comfortably until their death. The prince married a wife from the Ladakhi royal family.

=== Annexation to Central Tibet ===
Tsaparang and the Guge kingdom were later conquered in 1679–80 by the Lhasa-based Central Tibetan government under the leadership of the 5th Dalai Lama, driving out the Ladakhis.

== Historiography ==
Western archeologists heard about Guge again in the 1930s through the work of Italian Giuseppe Tucci. Tucci&#x27;s work was mainly about the frescoes of Guge. Lama Anagarika Govinda and Li Gotami Govinda visited the kingdom of Guge, including Tholing and Tsaparang, in 1947–1949. Their tours of central and western Tibet are recorded in black-and-white photos.

<doc id="1262268" wikidata="Q351091" url="?curid=1262268" title="Ben Rich (engineer)">
<text>Benjamin Robert Rich (June 18, 1925 – January 5, 1995) was an American engineer and the second director of Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works from 1975 to 1991, succeeding its founder, Kelly Johnson. Regarded as the &quot;father of stealth&quot;, Rich was responsible for leading the development of the F-117, the first production stealth aircraft. He also worked on the F-104, U-2, A-12, SR-71, and F-22, among others.

== Early in life ==
Rich was born in Manila in the Philippines. He was one of five children of British lumber mill superintendent Isidore Rich and his French wife, Annie, the daughter of one of his paternal grandfather&#x27;s Jewish customers who lived in Alexandria, Egypt. The Rich family was one of the first Jewish families to settle in Manila. Having fled the Philippines just weeks before the Empire of Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor, they moved to the United States in 1942, where Rich became a naturalized US citizen. He worked (with his father) in a Los Angeles, California, machine shop during World War II, and studied at Alexander Hamilton High School. After the war he started his college education when he was 21, majoring in mechanical engineering at University of California, Berkeley, followed by a master&#x27;s degree in aeronautical engineering at University of California, Los Angeles, instead of the medical field as originally planned. He would later complete the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.

== Career ==
=== Lockheed ===
Upon graduation Rich was hired by Lockheed as a thermodynamicist. There he worked on a variety of projects - he was awarded a patent for designing a nichrome heating system which prevented Navy patrol plane crew members&#x27; penises from freezing to their urine collection funnel. He designed inlet ducts for the F-104 Starfighter, the C-130 transport aircraft, and the F-90 fighter.

=== The Skunk Works ===
In December 1954 Rich transferred to the Skunk Works, the secret research and development section run by Lockheed&#x27;s Chief Engineer, Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson. There he designed the inlet ducts for the U-2, then led the effort to design and build a large-scale hydrogen liquefaction plant for project &quot;Suntan&quot;, a proposed hydrogen-powered supersonic very high-altitude aircraft to replace the U-2. After Suntan was canceled, Rich became propulsion systems program manager for the U-2&#x27;s successors, the A-12 and the SR-71 Blackbird. Rich was chief aerodynamicist for the projects, designer of the shock cone engine inlet, air conditioning and heat management systems. He was also involved in the specification of the aircraft&#x27;s black skin coatings which optimized dissipation of their tremendous aerodynamic heating as well as incorporating materials to reduce radar signature. The aircraft incorporated features that were later referred to as low observables or stealth technology.

When SR-71 crews became upset that engineers were not putting enough effort into solving a constant problem with violent engine unstarts in flight, Rich considered taking a flight in the SR-71 to experience the phenomenon himself, which included having to go through the same flight physical as pilots. He did not go through with the flight. He did eventually manage the problem by installing automatic controllers to maintain aircraft control during unstarts.

He briefly worked on a program that used ionizing radiation to help absorb radar coming from ahead of the aircraft. The radiation proved to be excessive and the test pilot disliked the heavy radiation shielding he had to wear. The project was cancelled when the military decided the radar signature was sufficiently low enough without the ionizing equipment. The concept was proven to work, but unfeasible.

Later, as Johnson&#x27;s successor as leader of the Skunk Works, Rich championed and directed the early experimental prototypes of stealth technology and led the development of the F-117 stealth fighter.

He is the author of &quot;Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed&quot;.

== Awards ==
A member of the National Academy of Engineering, he won numerous awards during his career, including the Collier Trophy. In 2005 he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. In January 1981, he received the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service for his work on the then-still-classified stealth airplane, in a secret ceremony in the office of then-Secretary of Defense Harold Brown. He was allowed to show the medal to his two children, Karen and Michael, but was not allowed to tell them why he had received it.

== Personal life ==
In 1950, Rich married Faye Mayer, a fashion model, who died in 1980. In 1982, Rich married Hilda Elliot. His son, Michael, is the former CEO and current President Emeritus of RAND Corporation and his daughter, Karen, is a botanist.

===Death===
Rich died of esophageal cancer in Ventura, California, on January 5, 1995.

== Selected aircraft ==
*F-104 Starfighter. Single-engine, high-performance, supersonic interceptor aircraft.
*XF-90. Experimental fighter / bomber escort aircraft.
*U-2 &quot;Dragon Lady&quot;. Reconnaissance aircraft. A high altitude jet aircraft used by the CIA and the US Air Force during the cold war.
*SR-71 &quot;Blackbird&quot;. An advanced, long-range, Mach 3.2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft. The Blackbird was designed to provide reconnaissance in defended airspace while improving aircrew survivability. In the Blackbird, mission success and survivability depended on aircraft speed. Ben Rich was responsible for engineering the spikes and engine inlet systems which made the Blackbirds the fastest jet aircraft in the world.
*F-117 Nighthawk. World&#x27;s first production stealth aircraft.
*YF-22, prototype of the F-22 Raptor.

<doc id="1262270" wikidata="Q5071586" url="?curid=1262270" title="Chang Apana">
<text>Chang Apana (December 26, 1871 – December 8, 1933; ) was a Chinese-Hawaiian member of the Honolulu Police Department, first as an officer, then as a detective. He was acknowledged by Earl Derr Biggers as the inspiration for his fictional Chinese American detective character, Charlie Chan.

== Early life ==
Chang Ah Ping (鄭阿平) was born December 26, 1871, in Waipio, Oahu, Hawaii. Apana is a Hawaiianized version of the Chinese name &quot;Ah Ping&quot;. His family moved back to China when he was 3, but Chang returned at the age of 10 to live with his uncle in Waipio. As an adult, Chang was fluent in Hawaiian, Hawaiian Pidgin, and Cantonese. He never learned to read, relying on his family to read newspapers and documents for him. In his youth, he worked as a paniolo (Hawaiian cowboy), starting in 1891, and it was as part of this job that he first began carrying a bullwhip on a regular basis. Three years later, Chang started working for the Hawaii Humane Society, which at the time was part of the police department on the island. The Humane Society was founded by Helen Kinau Wilder, the owner of the horses that Chang had handled as a paniolo. Wilder was the daughter of shipping magnate Samuel Gardner Wilder.

== Police career ==
In 1898, Chang joined the Honolulu Police Department, where he was assigned to patrol Chinatown. In his early years as a detective, beginning in 1916, Chang worked primarily on opium-smuggling and illegal gambling cases.

Due in part to his fluency in several languages, his wide network of informants and his shrewd and meticulous detective style, Chang was successful in solving many cases. Many stories about Chang&#x27;s career have arisen. Chang helped round up people infected with leprosy and send them to a leper colony on the island of Molokai. While performing this duty, Chang was attacked by a Japanese leper with a sickle, leaving him with a scar over his right eye. Another time Chang was thrown out of a second story window by drug addicts, only to land on his feet. There is an account that he raised the alarm on a shipment of contraband after being run over by a horse and buggy. One night in Honolulu, with no backup and armed only with his bullwhip, Chang arrested 40 gamblers, whom he then lined up and marched back to the police station.

== Inspiration for Charlie Chan ==

Earl Derr Biggers vacationed in Hawaii in 1920 where he was inspired to begin to write the novel &quot;House Without a Key&quot;. While reading Honolulu newspapers in the New York library in 1924, he read about the exploits of Apana Chang. Biggers then created a new character based on Chang for his novel, inserting him a quarter of the way through the book. The character became popular and Biggers expanded his presence in his novels.
Chang met actor Warner Oland, who portrayed Charlie Chan, when &quot;The Black Camel&quot; was filmed in Hawaii. When Biggers met Chang in 1928 the real detective was already being called &quot;Charlie Chan&quot;, and Chang enjoyed watching his fictional counterpart&#x27;s films. After five more novels, Biggers publicly acknowledged Chang as the inspiration for his character in a letter to the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; dated June 28, 1932. His widow states, though, that Chan was actually based on Biggers himself, resembling him in physique and character, whereas Chang was slight in build, quick to anger, and involved in very few actual murder cases.

== Retirement and death ==

After 34 years of service, Chang retired in May 1932 as a detective when he was injured in a car accident. He briefly worked as a watchman at the Hawaiian Trust building. On December 2, 1933, Chang was admitted to Queen&#x27;s Hospital after a serious month-long illness. On December 7, 1933, his gangrenous leg was amputated and he died the following day. Chang is buried at the Manoa Chinese Cemetery in Honolulu.

== Influence ==
Chang&#x27;s law enforcement career was an influence on other fictional works other than &quot;Charlie Chan&quot;. Max Allan Collins&#x27;s 1996 novel, &quot;Damned in Paradise&quot;, fictionalizes the famous Massie case. Collins included fictionalized depictions of several historical figures, including Chang Apana, who was an active-duty detective at the time of the Massie case (though there is no official record of Chang being one of the investigating officers).

&quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;, a comic book series by Stan Sakai that is set in 17th century Japan and features a cast of anthropomorphic characters, includes occasional appearances of a character named Inspector Ishida who is partially based on Chang Apana. As Max Allan Collins points out in the introduction to &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; Book 13: Grey Shadows, Inspector Ishida is, like the real Chang Apana, a more hardboiled character than the mild-mannered Charlie Chan.

In a 2011 comic story written by Mike Curtis and illustrated by Joe Staton for the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; newspaper strip, Tracy&#x27;s friend and colleague, HPD officer Haku Kou, is depicted as being the technical advisor on a movie being filmed in Tracy&#x27;s city because of the title character&#x27;s facility with a blacksnake whip. Kou explains that he became proficient with that weapon (leading to his being hired as the film&#x27;s technical advisor) in emulation of Chang Apana.

Chang was featured in the seventh episode of the ninth season of the &quot;remake&quot; of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, entitled &quot;Pua A&#x27;e La Ka Uwahi O Ka Moe&quot; (&quot;The Smoke Seen in the Dream Now Rises&quot;), which highlighted some of Chang&#x27;s stories and his successes in solving cases.

<text>Dominick Arduin (1961–2004) was a Frenchwoman who disappeared in her attempt to ski to the North Pole.

In 1988 Arduin moved to Finland. For 15 years she worked as a guide in Finnish Lapland and received dual citizenship. She said that she had grown up in the Alps, that she had been orphaned at an early age, had recovered from cancer and had been the only child aside from a dead sister. This backstory of hers was discovered to be fabricated after her disappearance.

Arduin reached the Magnetic North Pole in the spring 2001. She was rescued after the first failed attempt to reach the geographic North Pole in 2003. Most of her toes had to be amputated due to frostbite.

On 5 March 2004 Arduin began her second attempt to become the first woman to ski alone to the North Pole. She set out from Cape Arctichesky in Siberia. She lost contact after one day of travel. A helicopter search failed to find any trace of her though they recovered another traveler, Frédéric Chamard-Boudet. The search ended on 21 March.

After her disappearance the Finnish author Sven Pahajoki decided to write a book about her life and while researching her background, realized she&#x27;d been lying all along about her accomplishments and life. Her sister and uncle were found and it was found out she&#x27;d done disappearances earlier as well and that they did not believe she had died, but just done another disappearance to start anew yet another time due to financial reasons and getting caught of lying. She was born and grew up in Paris, she never had cancer, her sister never died. Her father died when she was 19, her mother a few years later.

<doc id="1262274" wikidata="Q7875083" url="?curid=1262274" title="USS Vicksburg (1863)">
<text>USS &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was a wooden steamship built in 1863 at Mystic, Connecticut; purchased by the United States Navy at New York City on 20 October 1863; converted into a gunboat; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 2 December, Lieutenant Commander L. Braine in command. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was named in honor of the great victory that General Ulysses S. Grant had recently won at Vicksburg, Mississippi.

==Service history==
On 7 December, a group of 17 Confederate sympathizers masquerading as passengers seized the steamer &quot;Chesapeake&quot; off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The panic caused by that daring Confederate exploit prompted the Navy to order &quot;Vicksburg&quot; on 21 December to take up station off Sandy Hook, N.J., and detain for inspection all commercial ships outbound from New York. She performed similar duty off Staten Island, N.Y., through January 1864 until she was finally relieved on 8 February and ordered to sail for Hampton Roads, Va., for duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; put into Hampton Roads two days later and was deployed with the blockade off Wilmington, North Carolina, on 18 February. In the spring, while on temporary duty off the coast of South Carolina, the gunboat seized the blockade-running British schooner &quot;Indian&quot; east of Charleston on 30 April. Returning to North Carolina, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; towed the stricken mortar schooner &quot;Oliver H. Lee&quot; to Beaufort, N.C., on 17 May and 18 May and chased a blockade runner on 31 May, recovering 79 bales of cotton thrown overboard by the vessel&#x27;s crew. The gunboat put into Hampton Roads for repairs in June.

On 11 July, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; received orders north to Annapolis, Maryland, to help protect Union emplacements there from Confederate raiders. She arrived off Annapolis in the Severn River on 13 July. Lt. Comdr. Braine found that the town was apprehensive over the proximity of Confederate forces and was mainly defended by 300 patients from the local hospital. Together with the gunboat , Lt. Comdr. Braine organized the town defenses and predicted that he would &quot;give the rebels a warm reception.&quot; That day, he also sent a boat party up the South River under the command of Acting Ensign Francis G. Osborn. The two-day expedition destroyed all means of crossing the South River and thereby protected the rear of the Union forces at Annapolis.

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; received orders to return to Hampton Roads on 15 July, arrived there on 17 July, and left for the blockade off Wilmington later in July in a convoy consisting of the side-wheel steamer and four tugboats. While deployed on patrol and reconnaissance duty off Wilmington, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; unsuccessfully chased a blockade-running side-wheel steamer on the night of 6 August and another on the night of 23 August which she found aground at daylight the next morning. The gunboat underwent repairs soon thereafter and spent September making an extensive survey of Confederate Fort Fisher and of other Southern land defenses in the Cape Fear River. After completing this mission on 10 October, she assisted in the capture of the new, steel-hulled, blockade-running British steamer &quot;Bat&quot; off the Cape Fear River and, on 20 October and 24 October, participated in two unsuccessful nighttime chases of blockade-running steamers in the same area.

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; remained off the Cape Fear River for the duration of the year and, on 26 December, assisted in covering the evacuation of troops after the unsuccessful first attack upon Fort Fisher on 24 December and 25 December. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; began the final year of the war assisting Union forces in mop-up operations following the fall of Fort Fisher during a second amphibious assault which took place between 13 January and 15 January 1865. She also participated in the bombardment of Half Moon Battery, situated on the coastal flank of the Confederate defense line which crossed Cape Fear Peninsula six miles above Fort Fisher, on 11 February. On 22 February, she was ordered north to Hampton Roads. In March, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was one of several vessels sent to White House, Virginia, to support General Ulysses Grant&#x27;s siege of Richmond by keeping open navigation between White House and the mouth of the York River.

With the end of the Civil War in April 1865, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 29 April and sold at auction to C. C. &amp; H. Cable on 12 July. She was documented for merchant service on 7 August 1865. Her name last appeared on lists of merchant vessels in the autumn of 1868.

<text>The Michigan Relics (also known as the Scotford Frauds or Soper Frauds) are a series of alleged ancient artifacts that were &quot;discovered&quot; during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. They were presented by some to be evidence that people of an ancient Near Eastern culture had lived in North America and the U.S. state of Michigan, which, is known as pre-Columbian contact. Many scholars have determined that the artifacts are archaeological forgeries. The Michigan Relics are considered to be one of the most elaborate and extensive pseudoarchaeological hoaxes ever perpetrated in American history.

==&quot;Discovery&quot; of the Relics==
In October 1890, James O. Scotford of Edmore, Michigan, claimed that he had found a number of artifacts, including a clay cup with strange symbols and carved tablets, with symbols that looked vaguely hieroglyphic. The find attracted interest and eager looters arrived to look for more artifacts. Many more elaborate discoveries were made in the area around Wyman in Montcalm County, Michigan following Scotford&#x27;s original discovery. Scotford was a well-known digger and sign painter in the area of Wyman. He and his company &quot;would dig until they located an artifact, and then the dignitaries who sponsored the work were invited to remove that artifact&quot;. Within the first year of Scotford&#x27;s initial discovery a syndicate was formed in Montcalm County of interested parties. The syndicate purchased many of the artifacts and attempted to exploit the finds financially for the region.

By 1907, Scotford joined forces with Daniel E. Soper, former Michigan Secretary of State, and together they presented thousands of objects made of various materials, supposedly found in 16 counties across Michigan. Soper had resigned as Secretary of State for the State of Michigan after being accused of embezzlement. The objects included coins, pipes, boxes, figurines and cuneiform tablets that depicted various biblical scenes, including Moses handing out the tablets of the Ten Commandments. On November 14, 1907, the &quot;Detroit News&quot; reported that Soper and Scotford were selling copper crowns they had supposedly found on heads of prehistoric kings, and copies of Noah&#x27;s diary. Scotford often arranged for a local person to witness him &quot;unearthing&quot; the objects.

Scotford and Soper had many trusting customers who strongly believed in the relics. In 1911, one John A. Russell published a pamphlet, &quot;Prehistoric discoveries in Wayne County, Michigan,&quot; in which he argued for their authenticity. James Savage, former pastor of the Most Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Detroit, bought 40 of the objects. Savage believed them to be &quot;remains relevant to the descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel,&quot; and continued to believe in the relics until his death (in 1927).

==Debunking==
In 1891, Professor Albert Emerson came out to the sites to get a better look at the &quot;artifacts&quot; that he called &quot;bad enough in the photograph... an examination proved them to be humbugs of the first water.&quot; In 1892, Professor Francis W. Kelsey, professor of Latin and Literature at the University of Michigan, along with Professor Morris Jastrow, Jr., librarian and professor of Semitic languages at the University of Pennsylvania, assessed the languages found on the objects. Kelsey and Jastrow deemed the Michigan Relics frauds containing a &quot;horrible mixture&quot; of jumbled ancient scripts. The consensus among most all early scholars who assessed the relics was that they were archaeological forgeries, based on the following evidence: 
*The hieroglyphs were stamped cuneiform characters in random order.
*The figures on some of the discoveries included lions with no tails, an omission which would not have occurred by &quot;primitive&quot; artists.
*The clay items were dried on a machine-sawed board.
*The objects disintegrated in water, indicating that they could not have been buried in the ground for very long. 

Archaeologists and historians continually concluded that the objects were forgeries. On July 28, 1911, professor Frederick Starr of the University of Chicago declared in the &quot;Detroit News&quot; that the so-called relics were fakes. Mary Robson, who lived in a room next door to Scotford&#x27;s sons Percy and Charles, stated that the boys manufactured more &quot;relics&quot; all the time. In 1911, Scotford&#x27;s stepdaughter signed an affidavit in which she stated that she had seen him making the objects and when she denied their validity he threatened her life. While most scholars and academics have determined that Scotford was the craftsman and Soper was the salesman, and the men joined forces for personal financial gain, neither man ever confessed and remained active in the business until their respective deaths in the 1920s.

==The Relics and LDS==
The finds attracted the interest of some members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1909, Mormon scientist James E. Talmage participated in a &quot;dig&quot; and then thoroughly tested the artifacts in his lab back in Utah. His investigations led him to label the artifacts as frauds. In August 1911, he published a work on his findings titled &quot;The &#x27;Michigan Relics&#x27;: A Story of Forgery and Deception.&quot; Rudolph Etzenhouser, who was a traveling elder of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), saw the relics as proof of the historicity of the Book of Mormon. Etzenhouser even published a book on his collection of the Michigan Relics.

After James Savage died in 1927 he bequeathed his collection of the relics to the University of Notre Dame. While at Notre Dame, the relics sat dormant until the 1960s when Milton R. Hunter, president of the New World Archaeological Foundation, uncovered the relics. Hunter spent the rest of his life attempting to use the relics to prove the historicity of the Book of Mormon. Hunter connected the relics to the &quot;Michigan Mound Builders,&quot; which he deemed to be the Nephites from the Book of Mormon. Hunter&#x27;s rhetoric and work with the Michigan Relics perpetuated pseudoarchaeology in religion, with efforts to prove pre-Columbian contact and the myth of the mound builders. Notre Dame gave Hunter the collection in the 1960s and before his death in 1975 he deeded the collection to the LDS Church. Following Hunter&#x27;s death, the Church kept the collection in their museum in Salt Lake City, Utah for decades. In 2001, the Church had the relics examined by Professor of Anthropology Richard B. Stamps, of Oakland University and found that the artifacts were made with contemporary tools. 

The LDS Church kept 797 of the objects in their Salt Lake City Museum. In 2003, they gave them to the Michigan History Museum in Lansing where they currently reside. The Museum developed an exhibition surrounding the objects called &quot;Digging Up Controversy: The Michigan Relics&quot; which was on display in the fall and winter of 2003.

<text>Katherine Maria Routledge ( ; ; 11 August 1866 – 13 December 1935) was an English archaeologist and anthropologist who, in 1914, initiated and carried out much of the first true survey of Easter Island.

She was the second child of Kate and Gurney Pease, and was born into a wealthy Quaker family in Darlington, County Durham, northern England. She graduated from Somerville Hall (now Somerville College, Oxford), with Honours in Modern History in 1895, and for a while taught courses through the Extension Division and at Darlington Training College. After the Second Boer War, she traveled to South Africa with a committee to investigate the resettlement of single working women from England to South Africa. In 1906 she married William Scoresby Routledge. The couple went to live among the Kikuyu people of what was then British East Africa, and in 1910 jointly published a book of their research entitled &quot;With A Prehistoric People&quot;.

==Easter Island==
In 1910 the Routledges decided to organize their own expedition to Easter Island/Rapa Nui. They had a state-of-the-art long Schooner built and named it &quot;Mana&quot;. They affiliated with the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the British Museum and the Royal Geographical Society, recruited a crew and borrowed an officer from the Royal Navy. The Mana departed Falmouth on 25 March 1913.

They arrived on Easter Island on 29 March 1914. They established two base camps, one in the area of Mataveri and the other at the statue quarry, Rano Raraku and also explored Orongo and Anakena. With the help of an islander named Juan Tepano, Routledge proceeded to interview the natives and catalogue the moai (giant statues) and the Ahus they had once stood on. They excavated over 30 moai, visited the tribal elders in their leper colony north of Hanga Roa and recorded various legends and oral histories including that of Hotu Matua, the Birdman cult, clan names and territories and data on the enigmatic rongorongo script; Van Tilburg credits her with a primary role in assisting preservation of Rapa Nui&#x27;s indigenous Polynesian culture.

One of her findings was the cultural continuity between the statue carvers and the Polynesian Rapa Nui people resident on the island in her time; the designs carved on the backs of the statues she excavated included the same designs tattooed on the backs and posteriors of elderly islanders in the island&#x27;s leper colony. As the tattooing tradition had been suppressed by missionaries in the 1860s this particular primary evidence was unavailable to later expeditions except through her records.
During their stay, the German East Asia Squadron, including the armored cruisers &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, and the light cruisers &quot;Dresden&quot;, &quot;Leipzig&quot;, &quot;Nürnberg&quot;, rendezvoused off Hanga Roa. While the expedition covered up their main discoveries to hide them from the Germans, the Germans converted their fleet to a . By the time the Germans landed 48 British and French merchant seamen from sunken prizes it had become clear to all that World War I had broken out, and Routledge complained sharply of this infringement of neutral Chilean territory to the schoolmaster in his capacity as representative of the Government of Chile; whilst her husband sailed the &quot;Mana&quot; to Valparaíso to pass on a similar complaint to the British Consul in Santiago.

There is no record of what steps the schoolmaster took to persuade the German fleet to leave Chilean waters, but they did depart, most of them to Coronel and the Falklands. Some of the stranded French merchant seamen were recruited as labourers by the expedition. Routledge also decided to mediate in the native rebellion against the sheep ranch that was led by local medicine woman and visionary named Angata.

The Routledges departed the island in August, 1915 returning home via Pitcairn and San Francisco. She published her findings in a popular travel book, &quot;The Mystery of Easter Island&quot;, in 1919. Hundreds of the objects that she and her husband found are now in the Pitt Rivers Museum and the British Museum whilst her paper records are held by the Royal Geographical Society in London. Most of her scientific conclusions are accepted to this day.

==Health==

During early childhood, Routledge began developing what is today believed to be paranoid schizophrenia. However, she was able to carry out anthropological research (often under arduous conditions involving living in close quarters with others for years) with no sign of the condition. Her brother, Harold Pease, also had mental illness, although whether he also had schizophrenia is unclear. Routledge became involved with Spiritualism during her Oxford years and practised automatic writing.

After 1925, her schizophrenia got worse and displayed itself in the form of delusional paranoia. She threw Scoresby out of her Hyde Park, London mansion and locked herself inside. She also hid many of her field notes. In 1929 Scoresby and her family had her confined to a mental institution.

She died institutionalized in 1935. Her husband gave some of their field notes to the Royal Geographical Society. One of his executors found photographs of the Easter Island expedition ten years after his death. Maps of the expedition were also found in Scoresby&#x27;s house in Cyprus in 1961. Another, final cache of the papers of Katherine Routledge and her husband William Scoresby Routledge devolved to his residual legatee in England, John Charles Dundas Harington (1903-1980), British judge and barrister. That large archive consisted of diaries, field notes, original illustrations, photographs, and artifacts, among other materials, relating to the expeditions of Katherine Routledge and her husband in Kenya and Polynesia, among other places. The archive was sold and dispersed in a series of auctions between 2017 and 2021; a portion is now owned by The Jack Daulton Collection in California. Family papers and photographs, previously unpublished, including details of her illness, were made public through a biography of her. Archaeology on Easter Island continues to make use of her field notes and ethnographic research.

<text>David Marcus Robinson ( – 28 January 1999) was an Irish painter and sculptor with a primitive representational style.

==Early life==
Robinson was born on in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the son of a house painter. Robinson began drawing at an early age and preferred it to playing outdoors with other children. His talents were first recognised whilst at Perth Street School were his teacher suggested he received artistic training. Unfortunately due to financial constraints this was not possible so Robinson held a succession of menial jobs such as dish-washer and pearl-diver until, the age of twenty when he began an apprenticeship in welding. As a child Robinson &quot;read voraciously on art&quot;.

For a time Robinson was a successful amateur featherweight boxer, fighting under the name &quot;Boyo Marko&quot;. At the outbreak of World War II he joined the Casualty Service of the Civil Defence. Robinson trained for a short time at Belfast School of Art in the late 1930s and early 1940s, working for a time with Sidney Smith who held a studio on Howard Street. He was seen to be a mysterious character who frequently disappeared for long periods of time, only to re-appear with numerous completed paintings. It is assumed that in these periods of absence that he was working at sea. Robinson held a studio on the Crumlin Road for a number of years. In 1944 he married a local stitcher called May Clarke, living initially just a few doors away from his parents. The couple were to have two daughters, Bernice and Annie.

== Artistic career ==
Throughout the 1940s Robinson showed with the Ulster Academy of Arts and at Heals Mansard Gallery in London. Robinson entered two works to the Civil Defence Art Exhibition in 1943. &quot;Bomb Crater in Eglington Street&quot; and &quot;Fire at the International&quot; were accepted from the 1,300 works submitted to the juried exhibition and went on display at Belfast Museum and Art Gallery. They were later amongst twelve works including Romeo Toogood&#x27;s &quot;Gleno&quot; and James McCord&#x27;s &quot;McAdam&#x27;s Farm&quot;, forwarded to London for inclusion in the Civil Defence Exhibition on Bond Street that summer. The Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts sponsored a group exhibition in the textile business of William Ewart &amp; Sons on Bedford Street in Belfast in 1944 when Robinson showed alongside Colin Middleton, George Campbell, Gerard Dillon and Sidney Smith.

Robinson travelled extensively in his time as a merchant seaman, visiting South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. His work shows the influence of native African and South American art. He spent time with Native Americans in Canada and travelled on the River Plate and on the Amazon. Robinson took his family across Europe and spent some time in Paris where he befriended Raoul Dufy and he lived in Spain on the same street as Joan Miró. Robinson was a great believer that you couldn&#x27;t be called an artist until you had visited Paris. During the turmoil of the 1940s he would often take his daughter Annie to Paris were they stayed in refugee camps. The gallery owner and dealer Hugh Charlton who was amongst the earliest to recognise Robinson&#x27;s worth commented on his internationalism a few days before the artist&#x27;s death:&quot;He is very concerned about Chernobyl, Northern Ireland and any human rights issues. The Troubles in the North are a source of much hardship for him. He simply cannot understand terrorism. The violence drove him out of Belfast and into Dublin in the seventies, but he is back up in the Shankill Road again.&quot;Robinson showed one painting, simply entitled &quot;Painting&quot; in the inaugural Irish Exhibition of Living Art in the 1940s. In his early career Robinson would sell his paintings from the railings of St. Stephen&#x27;s Green in Dublin and the Country Shop on St. Stephen&#x27;s Green became his gallery. The Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts hosted a one-man exhibition of Robinson&#x27;s work in 1947. The exhibition was visited by the cast of Sadlers Wells Opera Company, when the mezza-soprano singer Anna Pollak, who, like Robinson had no formal training, purchased one of his works. Robinson returned to the CEMA Gallery in the following year where he showed street scenes, portraits, and landscapes. The exhibition was opened by the actor and Head of CEMA in Northern Ireland, Jack Loudan. Robinson also arranged an exhibition of Ulster peasant art at Mills and Gray&#x27;s Gallery on Wellington Street in Belfast in November 1948. The exhibition showcased craftwork from across Northern Ireland and consisted of pottery, basketwork, toys and painted linen.

By the end of the 1940s Robinson had become an established artist, lauded by the young regionalist poet and founding member of CEMA, John Hewitt, and he was an active figure on the Belfast Arts scene. Amongst his social group numbered local artists such as Alicia Boyle, Rowel Friers, John Luke, and Colin Middleton and writers such as Roy McFadden and W R Rodgers. One of his closest friends was his mentor, the Ukrainian artist Paul Nietsche who is credited with not only improving Robinson&#x27;s technique but more importantly for introducing him to the influential art collector Zoltan Lewinter-Frankl. Frankl too became a close friend and patron, as did the writer F L Green. In Green&#x27;s 1945 novel &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; the character of Lukey Mulquin, a young and eccentric portrait painter was inspired by the ebullience of Markey Robinson.

Robinson held an exhibition in the unconventional surrounds of Cottar&#x27;s Kitchen, a cafe on Belfast&#x27;s Donegall Square in 1950. In the following year Robinson held a small show in the foyer of the Arts Theatre. Throughout the 1950s Robinson turned his hand to toymaking, supplying leprechauns, fairies and goblins for sale by his friend Mrs Ann Stonley, a Scottish native living in Belfast. He showed at the McNiece Gallery, Belfast in 1955 and at Robinson and Cleaver&#x27;s Gallery in 1956. He exhibited extensively throughout the sixties with solo exhibitions at the Piccolo Gallery in 1961, Furnishings Expert Limited, Belfast and at the Magee Gallery on Donegall Square, both in 1963. Upon his return from a period working in Spain in 1969, he found his studio had been razed in a fire, so he promptly returned to Spain. When Robinson returned to Belfast in the following year he found the civil disturbances too much to process so he relocated to Dublin.

Throughout the seventies he continued working and showing widely across Ireland at galleries such as the Oriel where he commanded five shows between 1973 and 1980, and at the Bell Gallery, Belfast in 1971 and the Sligo Art Gallery in 1977. Robinson also took his paintings across to the UK with exhibitions in the Attic Gallery, Cardiff and at the Redfern Gallery, London, and his work was also displayed in the Parisian Eleves Gallery.

Many dealers and critics did not take Robinson&#x27;s talents and work seriously, and yet more dismissed his works as amateurish, unfinished and repetitive. The reality was that only a small cross-section of his works were ever shown, primarily landscapes, because there was no market for the others. For this reason Robinson often repainted the same scenes whilst lamenting the dealers who he felt prohibited him from painting the subjects in which he was most interested.

Susan Stairs critiqued his work as follows:&quot;The beauty of Markey&#x27;s work is its spontaneity of line, its freshness of approach. His works do not have a contrived &#x27;finished&#x27; appearance. Some galleries felt that this rawness was detrimental to the sale of his work and actually employed people to touch up certain areas in Markey&#x27;s paintings which they felt was &#x27;unfinished&#x27;.&quot;Robinson showed in Philadelphia with a one-man exhibition at Villanova University in 1990. Robinson returned to his Belfast roots in 1996, making his home at Tudor Place off the Crumlin Road where he was to die just three years later.

== Death and legacy ==
Markey Robinson died at his home in Belfast on 28 January 1999, aged 80. He was survived by two daughters, an ex-wife, and three grandchildren. His ex-wife died in November of the same year. Robinson died intestate leaving at least eleven bank accounts where he had deposited large sums of cash, totalling in excess of £200,000.

Robinson&#x27;s works were often subject to squabbles amongst gallery owners over who had the right to show his works. Robinson was a shy and gentle character, who had little if any interest in the business of art, the dealer system or indeed in the financial benefits of his work. He spurned publicity and rarely attended opening nights or allowed his photo to be taken. He painted for himself and for those who appreciated his work. Legal arguments over Robinson&#x27;s work and his estate were to continue long after his death.

Robinson&#x27;s work can be found in many private collections across the world and in public collections such as the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Ulster Museum and Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast.

<text>Santi di Tito (5 December 1536 – 25 July 1603) was one of the most influential and leading Italian painters of the proto-Baroque style – what is sometimes referred to as &quot;Counter-Maniera&quot; or Counter-Mannerism.

==Biography==
He was born in Sansepolcro. There is little documentation to support the alleged training under Bronzino or Baccio Bandinelli. From 1558 to 1564, he worked in Rome on frescoes in Palazzo Salviati and the Sala Grande of the Belvedere (&quot;Homage of the People&quot;) alongside Giovanni de&#x27; Vecchi and Niccolò Circignani. He acquired a classical trait, described as &quot;Raphaelesque&quot; by S. J. Freedberg. This style contrasted with the reigning ornate Roman painterliness of Federico and Taddeo Zuccari or their Florentine equivalents: Vasari, Alessandro Allori, and Bronzino.

After returning to Florence in 1564, he joined the Accademia del Disegno. He contributed two conventionally Mannerist paintings for the Duke&#x27;s study and laboratory, the Studiolo of Francesco I in the Palazzo Vecchio. This artistic project was partly overseen by Giorgio Vasari. These paintings – the &quot;Sisters of Fetonte (Phaeton)&quot; and &quot;Hercules and Iole&quot; – like many of those in the studiolo, are stylized and overcrowded.

Baldinucci recounts that Santi completely rejected the &quot;maniera&quot; of Bronzino, and embraced a classical Reformist and naturalistic style. Santi went on to contribute a &quot;Sacra Conversazione&quot; for the Ognissanti and painted two altarpieces for Santa Croce in Florence: a crowded but monumental &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1570–74), and a creatively inspired and decorous &quot;Supper at Emmaus&quot; (1574).

Santi also painted a &quot;Resurrection of Lazarus&quot; for Volterra Cathedral; a &quot;Madonna&quot; for San Salvatore al Vescovo; a &quot;Burial of Christ&quot; for S. Giuseppe; a &quot;Baptism of Christ by St John&quot; for the Corsini palace, Florence. Santi died in Florence on July 23, 1603.

Santi&#x27;s mature style and likely his masterpiece is found in his masterpiece of the &quot;Vision of Saint Thomas Aquinas&quot;, also known as &quot;Saint Thomas dedicating his works to Christ&quot; located in the church of San Marco in Florence. It expresses a simple, pious gesture that appeared to have been lost from the courtly sensibility of Italian painting since the days of Raphael, while maintaining the brittle, demarcated colour that is classic of Tuscan works. The work has an earnest fervour lacking in his earlier mannerist works, which sometimes appear like a collection of posed statues over-painted with skin hues. This new contra-maniera style finds some echoes in the rising Bolognese Baroque style of the Carracci.

Among his pupils were Ludovico Cigoli, the leading painter of art Reform in late sixteenth and early seventeenth century Florence. Another pupil named Francesco Mochi became a prominent sculptor in the Baroque style and created, among other pieces, the colossal &quot;Saint Veronica&quot;, in the crossing of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.&quot;

<text>The Etruscan terracotta warriors are three statues that resemble the work of the ancient Etruscans, but are in fact art forgeries. The statues, created by Italian brothers Pio and Alfonso Riccardi and three of their six sons, were bought by The Metropolitan Museum of Art between 1915 and 1921.

==Early fakes==
The Riccardis began their career as art forgers when Roman art dealer Domenico Fuschini hired them to forge shards of ancient ceramics and eventually whole jars.

Their first sizeable work was a large bronze chariot. In 1908, Fuschini informed the British Museum that the chariot had been found in the old Etruscan fort near Orvieto, and that the Riccardis had been commissioned to clean it. The British Museum bought the chariot and published the find in 1912. Pio Riccardi died soon after the purchase.

==Warriors==
The Riccardis enlisted the aid of sculptor Alfredo Fioravanti and created a statue, later known as the Old Warrior. It was tall and was naked from the waist down. It was also missing its left thumb and right arm. In 1915, they sold it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art that also bought their next work, the Colossal Head, in 1916. Experts decided it must have been part of a statue.

The next work was designed by Pio&#x27;s eldest son Ricardo, who died in a riding accident before it was completed. When finished, the statue stood a little over tall. In 1918, the Metropolitan Museum of Art bought it for $40,000 and published the find as the Big Warrior in 1921. The forgers subsequently dispersed.

==Discovery of forgery==
The three warrior statues were first exhibited together in 1933. In the following years, various art historians, especially in Italy, presented their suspicions that on stylistic and artistic grounds alone, the statues might be forgeries, but there was no forensic proof to support the allegations. A later expert found that these exceptionally large pieces showed extraordinarily even firing characteristics, but he expressed this as cause for admiration, not suspicion. In 1960, chemical tests of the statue glazes showed the presence of manganese, an ingredient that Etruscans had never used. The museum was not convinced until experts deduced how they had been made. The statues had been sculpted, painted with glaze, then toppled while in an unfired, green state to produce fragments. Metropolitan director James Rorimer stated that studies by the museum&#x27;s Operating Administrator Joseph V. Noble (an antiquities collector and self-trained ceramic archaeologist) &quot;provided the first technical evidence of their having been made in modern times.&quot; This was confirmed by Alfredo Fioravanti, who on January 5, 1961, entered the US consulate in Rome and signed a confession. The forgers had lacked the skills – and the very large kiln – required to make such large pieces. The fragments had been fired, &quot;discovered&quot; and sold, or re-assembled (&quot;restored&quot;) then sold. As proof, Fioravanti presented the Old Warrior&#x27;s missing thumb, which he had kept as a memento. On February 15, the Metropolitan Museum announced that the statues were forgeries.

<text>Gottfried Mind (; 25 September 1768 – 17 November 1814) was a Swiss savant who specialized in drawing. He was called the Raphael of Cats because of the excellence with which he painted that animal.

== Early life ==
Gottfried Mind was born at Bern in the year 1768. His father had come as a joiner and form-cutter to Switzerland from Lipsich, in Upper Hungary. Mind was mostly left to himself because of his weak constitution.

Herr Gruner was a lover of art. During the summer, he had a German artist named Legel in his house who often drew buildings and cattle from nature. This excited the attention of young Mind in some of his idle rambles: he followed Legel everywhere, and watched him while he worked. Legel would take him along with him in his walks, or amuse him in his own apartment with exhibitions of prints. In particular, he allowed the boy to turn over Ridinger&#x27;s Animals, of which Herr Gruner had a collection; some of these Mind tried to imitate with the lead pencil, preferring above all lions. These attempts Legel from time to time corrected, and the youngster at length ventured to draw from nature, like his master, and to draw some sheep, goats, and cats.

His father, the joiner, however, thought that wood was the only material that was worthy of one&#x27;s effort and he also considered drawing on paper to be unworthy. Whenever the boy asked paper for drawing, he threw him a bit of wood; Gottfried also tried cutting animals in wood, an art in which he speedily attained such dexterity, that his wooden sheep and goats came to ornament all the presses and mantel-pieces in the village. He also tried drawing likenesses of some peasant boys of Worblaufen, or carving them in wood; and these attempts were not unsuccessful.

== Art education ==
Mind, in his eighth year, was placed at the academy for poor children, which Pestalozzi had previously instituted at Neuenhof, near Bern, Aargau. In the year 1778, in this authentic account of that institution, published by the Economic Society of Bern, the following short notice:—&quot;Friedly Mynth of Bossi (Mind of Pizy), of the bailliwick of Aubonne, resident in Worblaufen, very weak, incapable of hard work, full of talent for drawing, a strange creature, full of artist-caprices, along with a certain roguishness: drawing is his whole employment: a year and a half here: ten years old.&quot;

It is not known how long he remained at this academy; somewhere between the years 1780 and 1785, he came to the painter Sigmund Hendenberger at Bern. With him, Mind learnt his art of drawing, and colouring with water-colours. Mind&#x27;s education dealt mostly with art; he could with difficulty be made to write his name, and he had not the slightest idea of arithmetic.

Mind&#x27;s special talent for representing cats was discovered and awakened by chance. At the time when Hendenberger was painting that since-published picture of the peasant cleaving wood before his cottage, with his wife sitting by, and feeding her child with pap out of a pot, round which a cat is prowling, Mind cast a broad stare on the sketch of this last figure, and said in his rugged, laconic way, &quot;That is no cat!&quot; Hendenberger asked, with a smile, whether Mind thought he could do it better. Mind offered to try; he went into a corner, and drew the cat, which Hendenberger liked so much that he made his new pupil finish it out, and the master copied the scholar&#x27;s work.

== Work ==
It was not till after Hendenberger&#x27;s death that Mind fully developed his peculiar talent for drawing.

His pictures of peasant children, which, for the most part, are painted on small sheets, depict sports, banterings, quarrellings, sledge-parties of children, with their half-frozen but still merry faces, in their puffy yet picturesque costume.

In the course of his narrow, indoors life, he had worked himself into an almost paternal relation with domestic animals, especially with cats. While he sat painting, a cat might generally be seen sitting on his back or on his shoulder; many times he kept, for hours, the most awkward postures, that he might not disturb it. Frequently there was a second cat sitting by him on the table, watching how the work went on; sometimes a kitten or two lay in his lap under the table. Frogs (in bottle) floated beside his easel; and with all these creatures he kept up a most playful, loving style of conversation; though, often enough, any human beings about him, or such even as came to see him, were growled or grunted at in no social fashion.
His chief diligence and most careful elegance he brought to work in the painting of his beloved cats. He had both the art to seize the general nature of this animal and to reflect the specific character of each. The sycophantic look full of falseness, the dainty movements of the kittens, several of which are sometimes painted sporting round their dam—all this, in the most multifarious postures, turns, groups, sports, and quarrels, is depicted with a true observance to nature.

On Sundays and winter nights, Mind, by way of pastime, used, out of dried, wild chestnuts, to carve little cats, bears, and other beasts, and this with so much art that these little dainty toys were shortly in no less request than his drawings. It is a pity that insects, such as frequently exist in the interior of chestnuts, have already destroyed so many of these carvings.

At the &quot;Bärengraben&quot; (bear-yard) in Bern, where a few live bears are always to be seen, Mind passed many a happy hour. The moment he made his appearance, the bears hastened towards him with friendly grumbling, stationed themselves on their hind feet, and received, impartially, each a piece of bread or an apple out of his pocket. For this reason, bears, next to cats, were a favourite subject of his art; and he reckoned himself, not unjustly, better able to delineate these animals than even celebrated painters have been. Moreover, next to his intercourse with living cats and bears, Mind&#x27;s greatest joy was in looking at objects of art, especially copper-plates, in which, too, animal figures gave him most satisfaction.

Herr Sigmund Wagner, of Bern, who possessed a choice collection of copper-plates, frequently invited Mind, on winter Sunday evenings to his house, and would then show him his volumes. While Herr Wagner might be writing, reading, or drawing, Mind, grumbled to himself half-aloud, made his remarks on each sheet, and frequently gave a true, stubborn, rugged judgment even on the most celebrated masters, especially on pictures of animals. Among these, nothing pleased him but the lions of Rubens, of Rembrandt, and Potter, and the stags of Kidinger; the other animals of the latter he declared to be falsely drawn. Even the most applauded cats of Cornelis Visscher and Wenzel Hollar could not obtain his approbation.

Mind seldom drew from Nature; at most he did it with a few strokes. His conception was so strong, that whatever he had once strictly observed, stamped itself so firmly in his memory that, on his return home, and often a considerable time afterwards, he could represent it with entire fidelity. On such occasions he would look now and then, as it were, into himself; and when at these moments, he lifted his head, his eyes had something dreamy in them.

== Death ==
In late 1813, Mind began suffering from &quot;an increasing disorder in the breast&quot; which left him unable to exert himself. On 17 November 1814, he died of this illness, at the age of 46.

<doc id="1262296" wikidata="Q2416847" url="?curid=1262296" title="Trouton's rule">
<text>In thermodynamics, Trouton&#x27;s rule states that the (molar) entropy of vaporization has almost the same value, about 85–88 J/(K·mol), for various kinds of liquids at their boiling points. The entropy of vaporization is defined as the ratio between the enthalpy of vaporization and the boiling temperature. It is named after Frederick Thomas Trouton.

It is expressed as a function of the gas constant :

: formula_1

A similar way of stating this (Trouton&#x27;s ratio) is that the latent heat is connected to boiling point roughly as

: formula_2

Trouton’s rule can be explained by using Boltzmann&#x27;s definition of entropy to the relative change in free volume (that is, space available for movement) between the liquid and vapour phases. It is valid for many liquids; for instance, the entropy of vaporization of toluene is 87.30 J/(K·mol), that of benzene is 89.45 J/(K·mol), and that of chloroform is 87.92 J/(K·mol). Because of its convenience, the rule is used to estimate the enthalpy of vaporization of liquids whose boiling points are known.

The rule, however, has some exceptions. For example, the entropies of vaporization of water, ethanol, formic acid and hydrogen fluoride are far from the predicted values. The entropy of vaporization of at its boiling point has the extraordinarily high value of 136.9 J/(K·mol), or 16.5&quot;R&quot;. The characteristic of those liquids to which Trouton’s rule cannot be applied is their special interaction between molecules, such as hydrogen bonding. The entropy of vaporization of water and ethanol shows positive deviance from the rule; this is because the hydrogen bonding in the liquid phase lessens the entropy of the phase. In contrast, the entropy of vaporization of formic acid has negative deviance. This fact indicates the existence of an orderly structure in the gas phase; it is known that formic acid forms a dimer structure even in the gas phase. Negative deviance can also occur as a result of a small gas-phase entropy owing to a low population of excited rotational states in the gas phase, particularly in small molecules such as methane a small moment of inertia giving rise to a large rotational constant , with correspondingly widely separated rotational energy levels and, according to Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, a small population of excited rotational states, and hence a low rotational entropy. The validity of Trouton&#x27;s rule can be increased by considering

: formula_3

Here, if , the right-hand side of the equation equals , and we find the original formulation for Trouton&#x27;s rule.

<text>Fritz Hermann Michael Bayerlein (14 January 1899 – 30 January 1970) was a &quot;quarter-Jewish&quot; German general in the Wehrmacht, during World War II. He initially served as a staff officer, including with Erwin Rommel in the Afrika Korps. He then commanded the 3rd Panzer Division, the Panzer Lehr Division and LIII Army Corps (Wehrmacht) in the European theatre. Bayerlein was a recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. Prior to the second world war, Bayerlein served in the 9th Bavarian Reserve Division in 1917.

==Wehrmacht military career==

Bayerlein served as a staff officer of General Heinz Guderian for the invasion of Poland and the Battle of France. In Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, during June 1941, Bayerlein was assigned to Guderian&#x27;s Panzer Group 2 staff. After the Battle of Kiev, Bayerlein was transferred to Generaloberst Erwin Rommel&#x27;s staff. Bayerlein was moved to the Führerreserve in August 1942, then reassigned to the Afrika Korps as Chief of Staff.

He served as a staff officer under the command of Generalmajor Walter Nehring beginning in March 1942 upon Nehring&#x27;s transfer to Africa. Later, he served under Erwin Rommel and Wilhelm von Thoma. When Rommel left Tunisia in March 1943 after the failed attack during the Battle of Medenine (Operation Capri), Bayerlein was appointed German liaison officer under the new commander, Italian Giovanni Messe. He was sent to Italy before the German troops in Tunisia surrendered on 12 May 1943. Bayerlein was sent to the Eastern Front in October 1943, to lead the 3rd Panzer Division, which was surrounded at Kirovograd. Bayerlein led a breakout through the Soviet encirclement.

He was reassigned to command the Panzer Lehr Division, which moved to Normandy on 7 June. During the Allied Operation Cobra, Allied bombing near Saint-Lô decimated the division. The remnants of the Panzer Lehr Division slipped out of the Falaise pocket and moved east toward Vire in August 1944. The division next took part in the Ardennes Offensive, in December 1944, as part of the XLVII Panzer Corps; Bayerlein was relieved of command following the failed offensive. He took command of the LIII Army Corps (Wehrmacht) in February 1945 and surrendered to the U.S. Army in the Ruhr Pocket on 19 April 1945.

==After the war==
Bayerlein was a prisoner of war from April 1945 through April 1947. During this time, he and many other generals in Allied captivity wrote the European battle histories for the U.S. Army Historical Division. Bayerlein was released in 1947. He wrote about military subjects and continued his work for the Historical Division. He died in 1970. Bayerlein is credited as a technical advisor for the 1961 film, &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;.

<text>The Penetangore River is a river in Kincardine, Bruce County in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Great Lakes Basin and empties into Lake Huron. A boardwalk, a harbour, and the Kincardine lighthouse are located on the bank of this river near its mouth.

The name Penetangore is believed to come from an Ojibwa word meaning &quot;river with sand on one side&quot;, referring to the sand bar at the river&#x27;s mouth. Penetangore was also the original name of the settlement that became the town of Kincardine. The Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority has worked since the early 1970s to control erosion of steep banks within the town limit.

Every spring the river hosts an annual run of rainbow trout, as well as a few sucker species, lasting into May. In autumn, the river hosts a run of pacific salmon lasting well into October. Numbers of salmon travelling upriver, however, are particularly down from numbers anglers remember from the 1980s and 1990s, and thus anglers are strongly encouraged by the MNR to practice catch and release in an effort to increase natural reproduction.

Conservation efforts have been conducted since the early 2000s to restore the river. Important gravel spawning beds far upriver, enjoyed by the salmon and trout as recently as the 1990s, have become overgrown and many of the pools upriver once connected to prime gravel runs are now stagnant due to the reduced rapids connected to them. The Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority (SVCA) has reported that over 2002–06 the Penetangore River watershed had poor forest cover and wetland conditions and poor surface water quality. The report recommended allowing low-lying areas along the riverbanks to naturalize into wetlands and planting trees along the riverbanks and on property lines. The SVCA and the Lake Huron Fishing Club have been active in fencing off cattle and planting trees along the river, with the Penetangore Watershed Group also organizing tree-planting.

<text>The Asia Rocsta is a four-wheel drive off-road vehicle built by Asia Motors Corporation in South Korea. It was available as a Jeep or Pick-up Truck.

The Rocsta is derived from the K111 Jeep, also developed by Asia Motors. Because this model was cheaper than competing 4WD vehicles, it contributed to the increase in popularity of offroad racing in Korea.

Asia Motors launched the Rocsta in 1990, and retired it in 1997. From 1998, the Rocsta&#x27;s replacement, the Asia Retona, was sold with Kia badging.

UK sales of the Rocsta ran from 1994–1997 and included both the 1.8-litre petrol and 2.2-litre diesel engines. Both could be purchased with either a hard- or a soft-top. Both models were distributed by Kia Motors and used Kia copies of standard Mazda engines, with five-speed manual transmission.

The Rocsta was also sold in Australia between 1993 and 2000.

<text>Ralph Sydney Tubbs OBE FRIBA (9 January 1912 – 24 November 1996) was a British architect. Well known amongst the buildings he designed was the Dome of Discovery at the successful Festival of Britain on the South Bank in London in 1951.

==Background==
Ralph Sydney Tubbs was born in Hadley Wood, Hertfordshire, in 1912. He was educated at Mill Hill School and then the Architectural Association, which is highly regarded in Modern architecture and engineering.

==Career==
In 1935, Tubbs began working for Ernő Goldfinger, participating in the design of Goldfinger&#x27;s house on 2 Willow Road. In 1940 he designed the &quot;Living in Cities&quot; exhibition for the British Institute of Adult Education and the Council for Encouragement of Music and Arts, for which he made in 1942 a small book as well. During the World War II, Tubbs was not in services for medical reason, and worked as firewatcher.

Buildings designed by Tubbs include (dates shown for design to building)
* 1935–1938 only working drawings for 2 Willow Road, Hampstead, London (designed by Erno Goldfinger)
* 1948–1951 Dome of Discovery, South Bank, London
* 1952–1953 YMCA Indian Student Hostel, Fitzrovia, London
* 1956–1961 Baden-Powell House, Kensington, London
* 1960 Granada House, Manchester
*1959-1973 Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith, London (constructed 1969–73)

Ralph Tubbs&#x27;s Dome of Discovery project was given tribute at the Millennium Dome. In 1951, The Dome of Discovery was not only the largest diameter dome in the world, 365 feet across, but was totally unsupported except around the perimeter.

==Personal life==
In 1946, Tubbs married Mary Taberner. They were longtime residents of Wimbledon Village, and had two sons and a daughter. 

On 24 November 1996, Tubbs died from complications of sepsis and subacute bacterial endocarditis at St George&#x27;s Hospital in London, aged 84.

<doc id="1262338" wikidata="Q1362135" url="?curid=1262338" title="Paul Madeley">
<text>Paul Edward Madeley (20 September 1944 – 23 July 2018) was an English footballer, who played for Leeds United and the England national team. During his career with Leeds, Madeley played in a variety of different playing positions which led to him being described as a Utility player. Madeley made more than 500 appearances for Leeds in the Football League and appeared in 24 internationals for England between 1971 and 1977.

==Leeds United==
Born in the Beeston area of Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire Madeley signed for Leeds from non-league Farsley Celtic in May 1962 and made his debut for Leeds in January 1964, following injuries to Freddie Goodwin and Jack Charlton, and became a regular in the team from 1966 onwards.

Madeley was arguably the most versatile of players – in his Leeds United career, he played in every position on the pitch except goalkeeper and wore every shirt from No. 2 to No. 11 (and occasionally No. 12) as a result. His natural ability to adapt to a different role on a frequent basis meant that he was often in the side chosen by manager Don Revie at the expense of a &#x27;specialist&#x27; in that position, though the majority of the time there was a player either injured or suspended whom Madeley would replace – usually in defence.

However, Madeley was utilised in attacking positions when Leeds won their first major honours under Don Revie; in the 1968 Football League Cup Final, Madeley wore the No. 9 shirt (striker) in the 1–0 win over Arsenal, whilst in 1971 he scored the crucial away goal against Juventus which helped Leeds win the Fairs Cup – in the two legs he wore the No. 11 shirt (left wing/midfield). His versatility led to the nickname &quot;The Eleven Pauls&quot;, which was used in the 1972 FA Cup Final song Leeds United.

Having deputised so well for Paul Reaney at club level, Madeley was asked by Alf Ramsey to take Reaney&#x27;s place in the England squad for that summer&#x27;s World Cup in Mexico, but Madeley politely refused, saying he wanted to rest and, as a stand-in, was unlikely to kick a ball.

In the 1971–72 season, Madeley again found himself moving round the side as injuries and suspensions to his teammates, and in the end he never missed a League match, though for a third year in a row Leeds failed to clinch the title on the last day of the season. In April 1972, left back Terry Cooper suffered a broken leg, so Madeley switched to the No. 3 shirt for the season&#x27;s end and the FA Cup final, which Leeds finally won with a 1–0 win over Arsenal.

Revie signed Trevor Cherry as a replacement for Cooper in the summer of 1972, and Madeley moved across to the centre of defence for much of the next season as Jack Charlton&#x27;s distinguished career at Leeds wound down. He wore the No. 5 shirt as Leeds lost the FA Cup final to Sunderland, and the European Cup Winners Cup final a few days later in Salonika, which Leeds lost to A.C. Milan in controversial circumstances.

Leeds won the League in 1974 – Madeley missing just three matches – and even after Revie&#x27;s departure that summer to take over the England job, reached their first and only European Cup final a year later, with Madeley in the No. 5 shirt again.

In his autobiography, &quot;Right Back to the Beginning&quot;, Revie&#x27;s successor Jimmy Armfield related a telling story about Madeley negotiating a new contract: &quot;He once actually signed a new contract on what was virtually a blank piece of paper. I called him in to discuss terms and opened discussions by saying, &#x27;OK, Paul, we&#x27;ll give you so much&#x27;. He replied that he had no intention of leaving Leeds so he might as well sign the contract and let me fill in the details. I said, &#x27;What do you want, then, two years or three years?&#x27; He answered, &#x27;Either way, I&#x27;ll leave it to you. I just want to play for Leeds,&#x27; and that was that.&quot;

Madeley was granted a testimonial season in 1977, and eventually retired from playing in 1980 with 724 appearances in all competitions to his name.

==International career==
Madeley made his England debut in 1971 against Northern Ireland in Belfast in the 1970–71 British Home Championship at right-back; a position he was to win the majority of his 24 caps in a six-year international career. The then England manager Alf Ramsey had previously approached Madeley to replace injured Leeds teammate Paul Reaney at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, but Madeley politely declined, stating that he needed a rest and that as a stand-in he was unlikely to play a part.
Madeley later partnered Bobby Moore at centre-back as the latter won his 100th cap against Scotland in 1973. His final cap came against the Netherlands in a friendly at Wembley in 1977.

==Post-playing career==
After retiring Madeley invested in a shop in Leeds selling sports goods and worked for his family&#x27;s DIY business. He and his brothers sold this business for £27 million in 1987. In 1992, he had a benign brain tumour removed. He had a mild heart attack in 2002, and was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2004. Madeley was portrayed by actor Chris Moore in the 2009 film &quot;The Damned United&quot;, an adaptation of David Peace&#x27;s novel of the same name about Brian Clough&#x27;s ill-fated tenure at Leeds.

Madeley died on 23 July 2018, aged 73.

<text>An inspection locomotive was a special type of steam locomotive designed to carry railroad officials on inspection tours of the railroad property.

== Background ==
These were fitted with passenger car-like bodywork and seating. Many railroads in the nineteenth century owned one, but their use dwindled in the twentieth century. They were replaced with converted passenger-car inspection cars, or HiRail trucks, automobiles fitted with steel flanged wheels.

Some were especially built for this service, while others were rebuilt from obsolete locomotives. Many were quite small; the locomotive pictured is in fact one of the largest and most modern inspection locomotives ever constructed. They were generally well cared for and highly decorated.

== History by country ==

=== Brazil ===
In 1928, the Leopoldina Railway (de) purchased an inspection steam railcar by Sentinel Waggon Works.

===China===
In 1907, the South Manchuria Railway in Manchuria (today northeastern China) bought two inspection locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works. An engine of the same class was delivered to Rochester &amp; Pittsburg Coal &amp; Iron Company in 1903.

=== Peru ===

The 3 ft narrow gauge Chimbote Railway (de) had an inspection locomotive built 1880 by Baldwin Locomotive Works. The special feature was that it was equipped with a sleeping compartment.

=== Russia ===
The Russian Railways still has two inspection locomotives A ChS2 540 &amp; 549, which are converted electric locomotives of the ChS2 series. Since 2018, A ChS2 549 has been in the museum at the Moskovsky Rail Terminal.
=== United Kingdom ===

Railway companies in the United Kingdom rarely used inspection locomotives. Instead dedicated carriages (known as Inspection Saloons) were used. These were either rebuilt from obsolete coach stock or, occasionally, were newly built. However many companies maintained dedicated locomotives to haul Inspection Saloons. These were usually elderly engines that had been famous top-rank express locomotives when new but had since been surpassed. Examples of such engines include the Caledonian Railway Single, LNWR No.3020 &#x27;Cornwall&#x27; and NER No. 66 &#x27;Aerolite&#x27;.

Dugald Drummond, when Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London and South Western Railway had a small 4-2-4T tank locomotive classed F9 with a small saloon body mounted on its rear as his personal transport around the L&amp;SWR system on inspections and visits.

The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E&amp;GR) also had an inspection locomotive built in 1856. On 1 August 1865 the North British Railway absorbed the E&amp;GR. The engine got the No. 312, in 1895 No. 879, in 1901 No. 1079. It was withdrawn 1911.

In 1890, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway built an inspection locomotive called &quot;Inspector&quot;. It was withdrawn in 1899.

=== United States ===
By 1900, many railroads in the United States had inspection locomotives. A few examples:

The only known surviving U.S. example is the Reading Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Black Diamond&quot;, a tiny 2-2-2 with fully enclosed bodywork, at the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri. It was used by the President of Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal and Iron Co. and other railroad executives on short business or inspection trips.

<text>This is a list of Archbishops of [[Cyprus]] since its foundation with known dates of enthronement. According to tradition, the Church of Cyprus was created by St. Barnabas in 45 AD. The see of Cyprus was declared autocephalous by the Council of Ephesus, on 30 July 431; its autocephaly was abolished in 1260, and was restored in 1571. As the head of the Church of Cyprus, the holder is styled Archbishop of [[Erdek|Nova Justiniana]] and All [[Cyprus]].

<doc id="1262373" wikidata="Q2378102" url="?curid=1262373" title="Myringotomy">
<text>A myringotomy is a surgical procedure in which an incision is created in the eardrum (tympanic membrane) to relieve pressure caused by excessive buildup of fluid, or to drain pus from the middle ear. A tympanostomy tube may be inserted through the eardrum to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged time and to prevent reaccumulation of fluid. Without the insertion of a tube, the incision usually heals spontaneously within two to three weeks. Depending on the type, the tube is either naturally extruded in 6 to 12 months or removed during a minor procedure.

Those requiring myringotomy usually have an obstructed or dysfunctional eustachian tube that is unable to perform drainage or ventilation in its usual fashion. Before the invention of antibiotics, myringotomy without tube placement was also used as a major treatment of severe acute otitis media (middle ear infection).

==Nomenclature==
The words myringotomy, tympanotomy, tympanostomy, and &quot;tympanocentesis&quot; overlap in meaning. The first two are always synonymous, and the third is often used synonymously. The core idea with each is cutting a hole in the eardrum to allow fluid to pass through it. Sometimes a distinction is drawn between myringotomy/tympanotomy and tympanostomy, in parallel with the general distinction between an -otomy (cutting) and an (creating a stoma with some degree of permanence or semipermanence). In this distinction, only a tympanostomy involves tympanostomy tubes and creates a semipermanent stoma. This distinction in usage is not always made. The word &quot;tympanocentesis&quot; specifies that centesis (the removal of fluid) is being done.

Etymologically, &quot;myringotomy&quot; (&quot;&quot;, from Latin &quot;eardrum&quot;, + &quot;&quot;) and &quot;tympanotomy&quot; (&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;) both mean &quot;eardrum cutting&quot;, and &quot;tympanostomy&quot; (&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; means &quot;making an eardrum stoma&quot;.

== History ==
In 1649, Jean Riolan the Younger accidentally pierced a patient&#x27;s eardrum while cleaning it with an ear spoon. Surprisingly, the patient&#x27;s hearing improved. There are also reports from the 17th and 18th centuries describing separate experiments exploring the function of the eardrum. In particular, the animal experiments of Thomas Willis were expanded upon by Sir Astley Cooper, who presented two papers to the Royal Society in 1801 on his observations that myringotomy could improve hearing. First, he showed that two patients with perforations of both eardrums could hear perfectly well, despite conventional wisdom that this would result in deafness. Second, he demonstrated that deafness caused by obstruction of the Eustachian tube could be relieved by myringotomy, which equalized the pressure on each side of the tympanic membrane.

Widespread inappropriate use of the procedure later led to it falling out of use. However, it was reintroduced by Hermann Schwartze in the 19th century. An inherent problem became recognized, namely the tendency of the tympanic membrane to heal spontaneously and rapidly, reversing the beneficial effects of the perforation. In order to prevent this, a tympanostomy tube, initially made of gold foil, was placed through the incision to prevent it from closing. In 1819 the French physician Antoine Saissy (1756–1822) tried to keep the myringotomy unsuccessfully open with Catgut. Ádám Politzer, a Hungarian-born otologist practicing in Vienna, experimented with rubber in 1886. The German otologist Rudolf Voltolini (1819–1889) created in 1874 a grommet made of gold and later on one made of aluminium. The vinyl tube used today was introduced by Beverly Armstrong in 1954.

== Indications ==

There are numerous indications for tympanostomy in the pediatric age group, the most frequent including chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) which is unresponsive to antibiotics, and recurrent otitis media. Adult indications differ somewhat and include Eustachian tube dysfunction with recurrent signs and symptoms, including fluctuating hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitus, and a severe retraction pocket in the tympanic membrane. Recurrent episodes of barotrauma, especially with flying, diving, or hyperbaric chamber treatment, may merit consideration.

== Procedure ==
Myringotomy is usually performed as an outpatient procedure. General anesthesia is preferred in children, while local anesthesia suffices for adults. The ear is washed and a small incision made in the eardrum. Any fluid that is present is then aspirated, the tube of choice inserted, and the ear packed with cotton to control any slight bleeding that might occur. This is known as conventional (or &quot;cold knife&quot;) myringotomy and usually heals in one to two days.

A new variation (called &quot;tympanolaserostomy&quot; or &quot;laser-assisted tympanostomy&quot;) uses a CO2 laser, and is performed with a computer-driven laser and a video monitor to pinpoint a precise location for the hole. The laser takes one-tenth of a second to create the opening, without damaging surrounding skin or other structures. This perforation remains for several weeks and provides ventilation of the middle ear without the need for tube placement.

Though laser myringotomies maintain patency slightly longer than cold-knife myringotomies (two to three weeks for laser and two to three days for cold knife without tube insertion), they have not proven to be more effective in the management of effusion. One randomized controlled study found that laser myringotomies are safe but less effective than ventilation tube in the treatment of chronic OME. Multiple occurrences in children, a strong history of allergies in children, the presence of thick mucoid effusions, and history of tympanostomy tube insertion in adults, make it likely that laser tympanostomy will be ineffective.

Various tympanostomy tubes are available. Traditional metal tubes have been replaced by more popular silicon, titanium, polyethylene, gold, stainless steel, or fluoroplastic tubes. More recent ones are coated with antibiotics and phosphorylcholine.

==Aftercare==
There is little scientific evidence to guide the care of the ear after tubes have been inserted. A single, randomized trial found statistical benefit to using ear protective devices when swimming although the size of the benefit was quite small. In the absence of strong evidence, general opinion has been against the use of ear protection devices. However, protection such as cotton covered with petroleum jelly, ear plugs, or ear putty is recommended for swimming in dirty water (lakes, rivers, oceans, or non-chlorinated pools) to prevent ear infections. For bathing, shampooing, or surface-water swimming in chlorinated pools, no ear protection is recommended.

== Complications ==
The placement of tubes is not a cure. If middle ear disease has been severe or prolonged enough to justify tube placement, there is a strong possibility that the child will continue to have episodes of middle ear inflammation or fluid collection. There may be early drainage through the tube (&quot;tube otorrhea&quot;) in about 15% of patients in the first two weeks after placement, and developing in 25% more than three months after insertion, although usually not a longterm problem. Otorrhea is considered to be secondary to bacterial colonization. The most commonly isolated organism is &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, while the most troublesome is Methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA). Some practitioners use topical antibiotic drops in the postoperative period, but research shows that this practice does not eradicate the bacterial biofilm. A laboratory study showed that tubes covered in the antibiotic vancomycin prevented in-vitro formation of MRSA biofilm as compared to noncoated ones, although no study has been conducted on humans yet. Comparing phosphorylcholine-coated fluoroplastic tympanostomy tubes to uncoated fluoroplastic tympanostomy tubes showed no statistically significant difference in the incidence of post-operative otorrhea, tube blockage, or extrusion.

== Efficacy ==
Evidence suggests that tympanostomy tubes only offer a short-term hearing improvement in children with simple OME who have no other serious medical problems. No effect on speech and language development has yet been shown.

A retrospective study of success rates in 96 adults and 130 children with otitis media treated with CO2 laser myringotomy showed about a 50% cure rate at six months in both groups. To date, there have been no published systematic reviews.

Balloon dilation eustachian tuboplasty (BDET), a new treatment, has proven to be effective in treating OME secondary to eustachian tube dysfunction. However, the number of patients in the studies cited, 22 and 8 respectively and 18 in the tympanometric study, is extremely small and simply points to the need for large, well-controlled studies.

<doc id="1262377" wikidata="Q466158" url="?curid=1262377" title="Róisín Murphy">
<text>Róisín Marie Murphy ( , ; born 5 July 1973) is an Irish singer, songwriter and record producer who first became known in the 1990s as one half of the pop duo Moloko alongside the English musician Mark Brydon. After the breakup of Moloko, Murphy embarked on a solo career and released her debut solo album &quot;Ruby Blue&quot; (2005), which she wrote and produced with the experimental musician Matthew Herbert, to critical praise. Her second solo album &quot;Overpowered&quot; was released in 2007.

In 2015, after an eight-year hiatus that was sporadically interrupted by non-album singles, side projects and guest appearances on other artists&#x27; records, Murphy released her third solo album &quot;Hairless Toys&quot;, which was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and Ireland&#x27;s Choice Music Prize. The following year, she released her fourth album &quot;Take Her Up to Monto&quot;. In 2018, she released four releases in collaboration with producer Maurice Fulton. Murphy released her fifth and sixth solo albums &quot;Róisín Machine&quot; and &quot;Hit Parade&quot;, which received critical acclaim, in 2020 and 2023, respectively.

==Early life==
Róisín Marie Murphy was born in Arklow, Republic of Ireland, on 5 July 1973. When she was 12 years old, Murphy and her family moved to Manchester, England. She embraced 1960s fashion, going with her mother, who was an antiques dealer, to car boot sales and charity shops. When she was 15, her parents divorced and both of them moved back to Ireland. Murphy chose to remain in England by herself because she thought her mother did not have the strength to continue taking care of her. She lived with her best friend for a year until she could receive Housing Benefit and move into a nearby flat.

Murphy&#x27;s school years were difficult; in 2019 she said: &quot;I never felt it was like being bullied; I always felt I intimidated people, and that was why I got in trouble&quot;. She befriended a group of &quot;weird boys who wore black&quot; and who listened to The Jesus and Mary Chain. Murphy was inspired to become a performer when she attended a Sonic Youth concert with a friend. She concealed her singing voice, not wanting other people to know she &quot;sounded like Elaine Paige&quot;. Murphy later joined a post-punk band that split after a few performances. At the age of 17, Murphy enrolled in a sixth form college and later considered going to art school. At 19, she moved to Sheffield, where she began going to nightclubs and was inspired by the Vivienne Westwood designs she saw at Trash.

==Career==
===1994–2003: Moloko===
In 1994, Róisín Murphy met Mark Brydon at a party, using the chat-up line: &quot;Do you like my tight sweater? See how it fits my body.&quot; Brydon took Murphy to his business Fon Studios, where he auditioned her voice on tape and liked her theatrical delivery. They began dating and formed Moloko, who were signed to Echo Records and released their debut album &quot;Do You Like My Tight Sweater?&quot; the following year. Heather Phares of AllMusic described the album as combining elements of trip hop and funk with electronic dance music, using a more-humorous approach than some of their contemporaries. The band&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;I Am Not a Doctor&quot; covered similar musical ground, and a Boris Dlugosch remix of &quot;Sing It Back&quot; found international success, and was included on more than 110 compilation albums. Instead of paying Dlugosch, Murphy helped write &quot;Never Enough&quot;, which reached number sixteen on the UK Singles Chart in June 2001.

Moloko&#x27;s third album &quot;Things to Make and Do&quot; was released in October 2000; they used more live instrumentation and arrangements by keyboardist Eddie Stevens. The album reached number three on the UK Albums Chart, and &quot;The Time Is Now&quot; became the band&#x27;s most-successful British single, reaching number two. Murphy and Brydon broke up but were contractually obligated to deliver further albums. After the 2003 release of &quot;Statues&quot;, Brydon withdrew from much of the album&#x27;s promotion so Murphy handled most of it.

No official statement about Moloko&#x27;s future was issued but Murphy told &quot;Q&quot; magazine in May 2005: We left it on good terms after a very successful tour. We shook hands, said &quot;see you later&quot;, and haven&#x27;t spoken since. I don&#x27;t know what Mark thinks of this record or what he&#x27;s doing. I don&#x27;t know if we will or we won&#x27;t reunite. Myself, I don&#x27;t &quot;not&quot; want to.

===2004–2005: &quot;Ruby Blue&quot;===

While still in Moloko, Murphy began doing solo work, which included contributions to the works of other artists, including Handsome Boy Modeling School and the &quot;Never Enough&quot; collaboration with Boris Dlugosch.

In 2004, Murphy recorded her first official solo material with producer Matthew Herbert, who had previously remixed tracks for Moloko. Murphy wanted to work with Herbert again, commenting: &quot;it felt very natural ... because Matthew makes things seem quicker and easier&quot;. Murphy and Herbert recorded a few songs and continued working together with support from her label Echo Records. When Murphy presented the label with the album, they found it odd and did not hear any songs that would make successful singles. The A&amp;R division suggested Murphy make some changes to make it more radio-friendly. Murphy refused, stating she &quot;wanted it to be as pure as possible&quot;. The label later supported her.

Murphy released her debut solo album &quot;Ruby Blue&quot; in June 2005. Before the album&#x27;s release, the tracks &quot;Sequins #1&quot;, &quot;Sequins #2&quot; and &quot;Sequins #3&quot; were made available on three limited-edition, vinyl-only releases featuring artwork by Simon Henwood, who also directed two video clips for the album&#x27;s singles &quot;If We&#x27;re in Love&quot; and &quot;Sow into You&quot;. The album samples sounds made by everyday objects and actions, including cosmetics, brass mice, dancing and ornaments. It mixes the electronic music of Moloko with jazz and pop styles. Although the album was a commercial failure, it drew mainly positive reviews; Pitchfork Media called it &quot;perfect, the ultimate combination of human warmth and technological know-how&quot;.

===2006–2008: &quot;Overpowered&quot;===

In May 2006, Murphy signed with EMI Records. &quot;Overpowered&quot;, her first single for the label, was released on 2 July 2007. The single was written by Murphy and Paul Dolby (Seiji) of Bugz in the Attic, and mixed by Tom Elmhirst, and was accompanied by a series of remixes from Seamus Haji, Kris Menace, Hervé and Loose Cannons. A second single &quot;Let Me Know&quot;, a collaboration with Andy Cato, was released in September and the album, named &quot;Overpowered&quot;, was released soon after.

In September 2007, Murphy received a pre-nomination for the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Inter Act, but did not make it to the final list. She performed &quot;Let Me Know&quot; on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; on 5 October 2007.

Murphy sustained an eye injury on 27 October 2007, while on tour in Russia to promote &quot;Overpowered&quot;. She was forced to cancel several subsequent dates on the tour.

===2009–2014: Hiatus===
In mid 2008, Murphy started working with Sejii on a third studio solo album. In the same year, she recorded a cover of Bryan Ferry&#x27;s song &quot;Slave to Love&quot; that featured in a campaign for Gucci and was released on the promotional single &quot;Movie Star&quot;. In 2009, Murphy previewed material at the SeOne club in London, performing &quot;Momma&#x27;s Place&quot; and &quot;Hold up Your Hands&quot;, and in November, she premiered the single &quot;Orally Fixated&quot; on her Myspace page. The song was released later in the month and &quot;The Guardian&quot; offered a free download of the song for 48 hours.

From 2010 until early 2013, Murphy contributed vocals to Crookers&#x27;s album &quot;Tons of Friends&quot;; David Byrne and Fatboy Slim&#x27;s project &quot;Here Lies Love&quot;; Mason&#x27;s &#x27;&quot;Boadicea&quot;; Tony Christie&#x27;s &quot;7 Hills&quot;; The Feeling&#x27;s &quot;Dance for the Lights&quot;; an anonymous producer&#x27;s song &quot;Simulation&quot;; &quot;Golden Era&quot; by David Morales; &quot;Flash of Light&quot; and &quot;Invisions&quot; with Luca C &amp; Brigante; &quot;Look Around You&quot; by Boris Dlugosch; &quot;Alternate State&quot; by Hot Natured; Freeform Five&#x27;s &quot;Leviathan&quot;; and &quot;In My Garden&quot; with Invisible Cities.

The only release under her own name in this period was the single &quot;Simulation&quot;, which was released in August 2012 on the label Permanent Vacation.

===2014–2017: &quot;Mi Senti&quot;, &quot;Hairless Toys&quot;, &quot;Take Her Up to Monto&quot;===

In May 2014, Murphy released a six-track Italian language extended play (EP) titled &quot;Mi Senti&quot;, which includes a new composition and earlier Italian pop hits. Her third studio album &quot;Hairless Toys&quot; followed a year later and received positive reviews.

Her July 2016 album &quot;Take Her Up to Monto&quot; was recorded during the same sessions as &quot;Hairless Toys&quot;, and includes contributions from Murphy&#x27;s long-time collaborator and producer Eddie Stevens. The album&#x27;s title is derived from an eponymous Irish folk song &quot;Monto (Take Her Up to Monto)&quot;, which The Dubliners popularised in the 1960s and Murphy&#x27;s father sang to her as a child. The release was followed by a number of European festival dates and North American shows.

=== 2018–present: &quot;Róisín Machine&quot; and &quot;Hit Parade&quot;===
In 2018, The Vinyl Factory released a series of four discs that Baltimore house-music pioneer Maurice Fulton produced. Each disc includes two original songs, each of around six minutes, and Murphy directed music videos for the four A-side releases.

The single &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot; was released on 4 March 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Murphy gave home performances for a livestream concert that were released as six short films.

Murphy&#x27;s fifth solo album &quot;Róisín Machine&quot; was released 2 October 2020. The album has ten tracks, including the singles &quot;Simulation&quot; and &quot;Jealousy&quot; that were released several years prior, and the more-recently produced songs &quot;Incapable&quot;, &quot;Narcissus&quot;, &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot;, and &quot;Something More&quot;.

Murphy portrayed the blood witch Mercury in the 2022 Netflix series &quot;The Bastard Son &amp; The Devil Himself&quot;. She also took part in Homobloc&#x27;s charity T-shirt collection initiative which raised funds for LGBTQ+ focused organisations.

In March 2023, Murphy announced her signing to Ninja Tune with the single &quot;CooCool&quot;, which DJ Koze produced. Murphy collaborated with artist Beth Frey and photographer Connor Egan on the single&#x27;s cover art. On 17 May 2023, Murphy released the single &quot;The Universe&quot; and announced her sixth solo album &quot;Hit Parade&quot;, which was released on 8 September 2023 to critical acclaim. This was followed in 2024 by the companion &quot;Hit Parade Remixed&quot; while Murphy continued to tour in support of the release.

==Style==
Róisín Murphy has drawn considerable attention and praise for her eccentric, imaginative fashion style. &quot;Electronic Beats&quot; described Murphy as &quot;this adolescent century&#x27;s true art-pop queen&quot;; and said &quot;her sensuous and ominous output is scattered across various genres and moods&quot; and &quot;her reputation for sporting avant-garde couture into a place among fashion&#x27;s elite&quot;.

AllMusic described Murphy as &quot;a purveyor of adventurous, omnivorous pop that blended influences as far-flung as disco and hot jazz&quot;. The Australian publication &quot;OutInPerth&quot; called her &quot;Ireland&#x27;s queen of the avant-garde&quot;. According to &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;&#x27;s Giuseppe Zevolli, Murphy has &quot;merged pop, house, and disco with an avant-garde sensibility and a stunning, shape-shifting visual output that never ceases to provoke&quot;. Critic Mark Fisher, writing in the UK music magazine &quot;Fact&quot;, located her music in a glam rock lineage that includes Roxy Music, Grace Jones, and the New Romantics, noting Murphy&#x27;s attention to the cultivation of artifice and persona. Fisher wrote: &quot;Róisín Murphy is pop&#x27;s exiled princess of glam [rock]. She represents a confection—of disco and art, of sensuousness and intelligence, of sumptuous superficiality and existential anxiety—that once seemed inevitable, but which has now become all but impossible.&quot;

The sound of Moloko&#x27;s early work drew on electronic and trip hop influences before moving to a more organic sound. According to Elizabeth Vincentelli of &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;it was only after [Moloko&#x27;s] breakup that Murphy truly refined her trademark fusion of glossy sheen and playful experimentation&quot;. Murphy&#x27;s diverse solo work includes collaborations with experimental jazz composer Matthew Herbert and electronic producer Eddie Stevens, drawing on house music, ballroom culture and avant-garde electronica. Murphy has a contralto vocal range, which has been described as distinctive, smoky and jazzy. Heather Phares said Murphy&#x27;s voice &quot;combin[es] a wild variety of voices and textures, from impassively chilly to gorgeously lilting to gleefully offbeat&quot;. The first performers that left an impression on Murphy were Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth and Kim Deal from Pixies. Iggy Pop also inspired her with his &quot;energy—and he&#x27;s a giver&quot;. Murphy stated her biggest influences were Siouxsie Sioux, Grace Jones and Björk. She was also inspired by Italian female singers such as Mina and Patty Pravo for the way they owned the stage when they moved. Murphy described her performances as &quot;a bit like &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;&quot;; according to Jad Salfiti of &quot;Financial Times&quot;, her audiences &quot;dress up to mirror Murphy’s own spectacular fashions&quot;. Salfiti also said of Murphy: &quot;[her] clothes amplify her personality: exhibitionist, playful, eclectic, larger than life&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Murphy lives in Ibiza, Spain, having previously split her time between London and Ireland. She previously dated British artist Simon Henwood; they have a daughter together. , Murphy is in a relationship with Italian producer Sebastiano Properzi, with whom she has a son. Murphy is dyslexic.

=== Comments on puberty blockers ===
In August 2023, Murphy sparked controversy when a Twitter user shared a screenshot from Facebook showing Murphy commenting on a post about Irish anti-transgender activist Graham Linehan, in which she criticised the use of puberty blockers for transgender youth. Her statements were met with backlash on social media, including responses from LGBT+ allies and activists accusing her of transphobia and misinformation. Commentators noted the disappointment of fans, particularly due to her perceived role as a gay icon. In the weeks following the comments, Murphy&#x27;s material was removed from a scheduled BBC Radio 6 Music line-up, which had been due to broadcast five hours of her songs, interviews, and concert highlights. The BBC later stated that the schedule change was not a reaction to Murphy&#x27;s comments.

Murphy later issued an apology on social media, stating she was &quot;deeply sorry&quot; for any hurt caused by her words. However, she did not take back her comments on puberty blockers, only writing her “concern was out of love for all of us” .

<text>Dirk Philips (1504–1568) was an early Anabaptist writer and theologian. He was one of the peaceful disciples of Melchior Hoffman and later joined Menno Simons in laying out practical doctrines for what would become the Mennonite church.

== Biography ==

Dirk Philips was born in Leeuwarden in 1504, the son of a priest (it was not uncommon at the time for a priest to have unofficial wives and families). He was a Franciscan friar. He joined the Anabaptist Brotherhood in 1533 and became an elder in 1534. In 1537, he was named one of the outstanding Anabaptist leaders. In 1561, he was described as an old man, not very tall, with a grey beard and white hair. He died in Het Falder in 1568.

== Beliefs ==

He was the leading theologian of his time among Dutch Mennonites. He was known to be very systematic in his thinking, and very strict and unwavering in his beliefs. There were two key themes to his theology: the word of scripture, and the word incarnate in Jesus. Like other Anabaptists, he gave Christ pre-eminence.

He identifies seven ordinances and commandments that must be maintained to be recognized as an authentic church:
*Pure, unfalsified teaching of the divine Word by true ministers
*Scriptural use of the sacraments, baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper
*Washing the feet of the saints
*Separation of sinners (the ban and shunning)
*Command of love one for another
*Keeping all the commandments of Christ Jesus
*Suffering and persecution is expected for all Christians

He believed in strict adherence to the ban or shunning. This is when open sinners are expelled from the church until they repent. He felt this was necessary in order to maintain the purity of the church. His emphasis on the ban and the purity of the community makes Dirk Philips&#x27; writings more popular with the Old Order Amish. He believed in the absolute opposition between the church and the world, and therefore that believers should expect persecution.

<text>Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger, also black henbane and stinking nightshade) is a poisonous plant belonging to tribe Hyoscyameae of the nightshade family &quot;Solanaceae&quot;. Henbane is native to temperate Europe and Siberia, and naturalised in Great Britain and Ireland.

==Historical use==
The name &quot;henbane&quot; dates from AD 1265; &quot;bane&quot; meant &quot;death&quot;. Other etymologies of &quot;henbane&quot; derive from the Indo-European stem &quot;bhelena&quot; meaning &quot;crazy plant&quot; and with the Proto-Germanic element &quot;bil&quot; meaning &quot;vision&quot;, &quot;hallucination&quot;, &quot;magical power&quot;, and &quot;miraculous ability&quot;.

Historically, henbane was used in combination with other plants, such as the mandrake, the deadly nightshade, and the datura, as an anaesthetic potion, and for its psychoactive properties in &quot;magic brews&quot;. These psychoactive properties include visual hallucinations and a sensation of flight. It was originally used in continental Europe, Asia, and the Arab world, though it did spread to England in the Middle Ages. The use of henbane by the ancient Romans was documented by Pliny, who said it was &quot;of the nature of wine and therefore offensive to the understanding&quot;, and by Dioscorides, who recommended it as a sedative and analgesic.

The plant, recorded as &quot;Herba Apollinaris&quot;, was used to yield oracles by the priestesses of Apollo. Recently evidence for its use in the earlier British Neolithic has been debated. John Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball&quot; states: &quot;The leaves, the seeds and the juice, when taken internally cause an unquiet sleep, like unto the sleep of drunkenness, which continueth long and is deadly to the patient. To wash the feet in a decoction of Henbane, as also the often smelling of the flowers causeth sleep.&quot;

The plant was also purportedly used as a fumigant for magical purposes. Albertus Magnus, in his work &quot;De Vegetalibus&quot; (1250), reported that necromancers used henbane to invoke the souls of the dead as well as demons. Henbane was already being demonized as early as the Late Middle Ages when it became inseparably associated with witchcraft and malefic practices. “The witches drank the decoction of henbane and had those dreams for which they were tortured and executed. It was also used for witches’ ointments and was used for making weather and conjuring spirits. If there were a great drought then a stalk of henbane would be dipped into a spring, then the sun-baked sand would be sprinkled with this” (Perger 1864, 181).

Henbane was discovered among an assortment of imported spices during the underwater archaeological excavation of the royal Danish-Norwegian flagship, Gribshunden, which sank in 1495 near Ronneby, Sweden. The purpose of this henbane is not known: but could have been medicinal for soothing toothache, or as an anti-emetic and to prevent motion sickness.

During a Pomeranian witchcraft trial in 1538, a suspected witch &quot;confessed&quot; that she had given a man henbane seeds so that he would run around &quot;crazy&quot; (sexually aroused). In a file from an Inquisition trial, it was noted that &quot;a witch admits&quot; having once strewn henbane seeds between two lovers and uttering the following formula: &quot;Here I sow wild seed, and the devil advised that they would hate and avoid each other until these seeds had been separated&quot; (Marzell 1922, 169).

Henbane was one of the ingredients in gruit, traditionally used in beers as a flavouring. The recipe for henbane beer includes 40 g dried chopped henbane herbage, 5 g bayberry, 23 L water, 1 L brewing malt, 900 g honey, 5 g dried yeast, and brown sugar. Henbane fell out of usage for beer when it was replaced by hops in the 11th to 16th centuries, as the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516 outlawed ingredients other than barley, hops, yeast, and water.

Henbane is sometimes identified with the &quot;hebenon&quot; poured into the ear of Hamlet&#x27;s father, although other candidates for hebenon exist.

=== Theories ===

Henbane seeds have been found in a Viking grave near Fyrkat, Denmark, that was first described in 1977. This and other archaeological finds show that &quot;H. niger&quot; was known to the Vikings. Analysis of the symptoms caused by intoxication of this plant suggest that it may have been used by berserkers to induce the rage state that they used in war.

==Cultivation and use==

Henbane originated in Eurasia, and is now globally distributed as a plant grown mainly for pharmaceutical purposes. Henbane is rare in northern Europe; its cultivation for medicinal use is widespread and legal in central and eastern Europe and in India. Seeds of Henbane from NW Himalaya reported to exhibit dormancy, and germination can be induced by the application of gibberellic acid, nitrates, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and by moist cold stratification Sharma (2024) observed that fully matured seeds of &quot;H. niger&quot; exhibited dormancy and in contrast, the comparatively immature seeds germinated well. The latter can be manipulated for the propagation of Henbane without seed pre-treatments. 

Henbane is used in traditional herbal medicine for ailments of the bones, rheumatism, toothache, asthma, cough, nervous diseases, and stomach pain. It might also be used as analgesic, sedative, and narcotic in some cultures. Adhesive bandages with henbane extract behind the ear are reported to prevent discomfort in travel-sick people. Henbane oil is used for medicinal massage.

Henbane material in most Western countries can be bought in pharmacies with a prescription only. Sales of henbane oil are not legally regulated and are allowed in shops other than pharmacies in the US.

Henbane has travelled through the company of Romani people.

==Preparation, dosage, toxicity==
Henbane leaves and herbage without roots are chopped and dried and are then used for medicinal purposes or in incense and smoking blends, in making beer and tea, and in seasoning wine. Henbane leaves are boiled in oil to derive henbane oil. Henbane seeds are an ingredient in incense blends. In all preparations, the dosage has to be carefully estimated due to the high toxicity of henbane. For some therapeutic applications, dosages like 0.5 g and 1.5– 3 g were used. The lethal dosage is not known.

Henbane is toxic to cattle, wild animals, fish, and birds. Not all animals are susceptible; for example, the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including cabbage moths, eat henbane. Pigs are immune to henbane toxicity and are reported to enjoy the effects of the plant.

== Psychoactive material ==

Hyoscyamine, scopolamine, and other tropane alkaloids have been found in the foliage and seeds of the plant. The standard alkaloid content has been reported to be 0.03% to 0.28%.

Its psychoactive and pharmacological effects are a result of these alkaloids exerting an anticholinergic mechanism of action which blocks the function of acetylcholine in the brain and antagonizes the muscarinic receptors. This results in an altered state of consciousness, hallucinogenic experiences, and typically, delirium. This mechanism of action is not only linked to dangerous effects and accidents, but dementia as well. Since toxicity/lethality is such a major concern with plants like henbane; many traditional preparations of henbane or other similar scopolamine-containing plants were designed to be applied transdermally, often in “magical ointments” by herbalists, witches and cunning folk. The purpose of this was to absorb the primary and transdermally-active alkaloid scopolamine through the skin, thus eliminating the risk of the additional toxicity from atropine and hyoscyamine that is inevitably present with oral ingestion of the plant but not when used topically.

==Effects==
Henbane ingestion by humans is followed simultaneously by peripheral inhibition and central stimulation. Common effects of henbane ingestion include hallucinations, dilated pupils, narcosis, restlessness, and flushed skin. Less common effects are tachycardia, convulsions, vomiting, hypertension, hyperpyrexia, and ataxia. Initial effects typically last for three to four hours, while aftereffects may last up to three days. The side effects of henbane ingestion are dryness in the mouth, confusion, visual illusions, bizarre thoughts, locomotor and memory disturbances, and farsightedness, similar in style to those of other tropane-based deliriants such as plants of the New World genus &quot;datura&quot;. As a result of this distinct chemical and pharmacological profile, overdoses can result not only in delirium, but also severe anticholinergic syndrome, coma, respiratory paralysis, and death. Low and average dosages have inebriating and aphrodisiac effects.

In his book &quot;How Do Witches Fly?&quot;, Alexander Kuklin refers to an experience of black henbane had by German scientist Michael Schenck. Schenck recollected his experience:

Schenck&#x27;s pulse became rapid and he experienced a further increase in the hallucinogenic effects of the plant:

==Misidentification==
Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson accidentally recommended henbane as a &quot;tasty addition to salads&quot; in the August 2008 issue of &quot;Healthy and Organic Living&quot; magazine. The publication promptly warned subscribers against consuming the &quot;very toxic&quot; plant upon discovery of the error, and Thompson admitted to confusing it with fat hen, a member of the spinach family.

<doc id="1262382" wikidata="Q56312861" url="?curid=1262382" title="Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation">
<text>The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC; ) is a Canadian federal Crown Corporation created by Parliament in 1967 to provide deposit insurance to depositors in Canadian commercial banks and savings institutions. CDIC insures Canadians&#x27; deposits held at Canadian banks (and other member institutions) up to C$100,000 in case of a bank failure. CDIC automatically insures many types of savings against the failure of a financial institution. However, the bank must be a CDIC member and not all savings are insured. CDIC is also Canada&#x27;s resolution authority for banks, federally regulated credit unions, trust and loan companies as well as associations governed by the &quot;Cooperative Credit Associations Act&quot; that take deposits.

== History ==

The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation was created 4 March 1967 (under Schedule III, Part 1 of the &quot;Financial Administration Act&quot; and &quot;Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act&quot;). It is similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States. Since 1967, 43 financial institutions have failed in Canada and all 43 were members of CDIC. There have been no failures since 1996. On 31 December 2017, member institutions numbered 82, according to CDIC&#x27;s Summary of the Corporate Plan, 2018/19 to 2022/2023.

The roots of the CDIC can be traced back to the 19th century, such as the Upper Canada&#x27;s financial problems of 1866, the North American panic of 1873 and the 1923 failure of Toronto&#x27;s Home Bank, symbolized today by Casa Loma. Historically in Canada regional risk has always been spread nationally within each large bank, unlike the uneven geography of US unit banking, layered with savings &amp; loans of regional or national size, who in turn disperse their risk through investors. The Canadian banking system is regulated in part by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions who can, in an extreme case, close a financial institution. Alongside Canada&#x27;s mortgage rules, the risk of bank failures similar to the US are slim, but not impossible.

The original amount of insurance per eligible deposit account was $20,000. This was raised to $60,000 in 1983. As of 2005, CDIC covers $100,000 in eligible deposits per insured category at each CDIC member institution in the event of a failure.

On 22 June 2017, CDIC was formally designated as the resolution authority for Canada&#x27;s largest banks, a recognition of CDIC&#x27;s role in handling the failure of its member institutions. CDIC has a number of tools to assist or resolve a failing member institution.

As of 30 April 2020, coverage was expanded to include deposits in foreign currencies, and deposits with terms greater than 5 years, but coverage for travellers&#x27; cheques was eliminated (as member institutions no longer offer them). As of 30 April 2022, separate coverage was added for Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs) and Registered Disability Savings Plans (RDSPs), but deposits in mortgage tax accounts will no longer be considered a separate category.

==Coverage==
Insurance is restricted to CDIC member institutions, and covers $100,000 in certain types of deposits, such as savings accounts and chequing accounts, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and other term deposits, money orders, and bank drafts issued by CDIC members and cheques certified by CDIC members, and debentures issued by loan companies that are CDIC members. Eligible deposits are insured separately in each of nine categories:

* in one name
* in more than one name
* in a Registered retirement savings plan (RRSP)
* in a Registered retirement income fund (RRIF)
* in a Tax-free savings account (TFSA)
* in a first home savings account (FHSA)
* in a Registered education savings plan (RESP)
* in a Registered disability savings plan (RDSP)
* in a trust

A key characteristic of CDIC deposit protection is separate coverage. Given that each deposit category is protected separately, depositors can benefit from protection far in excess of $100,000 (i.e. they can be protected for $100,000 in each of the nine categories).

Most credit unions (and &quot;caisses populaires&quot; in Quebec or New Brunswick) are not insured federally, because they are created under provincial charters and backed by provincial insurance corporations which generally follow the CDIC model. Federal credit unions, such as the UNI Financial Cooperation &quot;caisse&quot; in New Brunswick, are incorporated under federal charters and are members of CDIC. ATB Financial, a financial institution owned by the Government of Alberta, is insured directly by the Alberta provincial government rather than through a federal or provincial insurance corporation.

Funds in foreign banks operating in Canada may or may not be covered depending on whether they are members of CDIC.

Not all types of investments are covered. The general principle is to cover reasonable deposits and savings, but not deposits deliberately positioned to take risks for gain, such as mutual funds, stocks, or cryptocurrencies.

<doc id="1262385" wikidata="Q457770" url="?curid=1262385" title="Lena Zavaroni">
<text>Lena Hilda Zavaroni (4 November 1963 – 1 October 1999) was a Scottish singer and television show host. At the age of 10, with her album &quot;Ma! (He&#x27;s Making Eyes at Me)&quot;, she was the youngest person to have had an album in the top 10 of the UK Albums Chart. Later she starred in her own television series, made numerous TV guest-star appearances, and appeared on stage. 

From age 13 Zavaroni suffered anorexia nervosa, and she developed clinical depression when she was 15. Following an operation to cure her depression, Zavaroni died at the age of 35 from pneumonia on 1 October 1999.

==Life and career==
===Early life===

Zavaroni was born in Greenock, Renfrewshire, and grew up in the small town of Rothesay on the Isle of Bute. Her parents owned a fish and chip shop. Her father Victor (b. 1939) played the guitar and her mother Hilda (née Jordan) ( 1940 – 1989) sang. Her grandfather Alfredo had emigrated from Italy.

Zavaroni began singing at the age of two. She was discovered in the summer of 1973 by record producer Tommy Scott, who was on holiday in Rothesay and heard her singing in a band with her father and uncle. Scott contacted impresario Phil Solomon, which led to his partner Dorothy Solomon becoming Zavaroni&#x27;s manager.

===Musical career===

In 1974, Zavaroni appeared on &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; (hosted by Hughie Green) and won the show for a record-breaking five weeks running. She followed this with the album &quot;Ma! (He&#x27;s Making Eyes at Me)&quot;, a collection of classic and then-recent pop standards which reached number 8 in the UK Albums Chart. She remains the youngest person to have an album in the top 10, having reached the position at 10 years, 146 days old.

Zavaroni sang at a Hollywood charity show with Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball in 1974, at which Ball said: &quot;You&#x27;re special. Very special and very, very good&quot;, although some sources attribute the words to Sinatra. Following this, Zavaroni guest-starred on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, and on 4 June 1974, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. She also appeared on &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot;, the 29 May 1975 episode of &quot;The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club&quot;, in the 1976 &quot;Royal Variety Show&quot; and performed at the White House for U.S. President Gerald Ford. Signed to the soul-oriented Stax Records label in the United States, Zavaroni was not especially successful in America despite the praise and television appearances; her &quot;Ma&quot; album did not enter the charts, and its title single only reached number 91 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 during a four-week chart run in the summer of 1974.

===Stage and television career===
While attending London&#x27;s Italia Conti Academy stage school, Zavaroni met and became long-term friends with another young star, Bonnie Langford. They starred in the ITV special &quot;Lena and Bonnie&quot;. In September 1978, the BBC broadcast &quot;Lena Zavaroni on Broadway&quot;. This episode which was chosen for the 1978 Golden Sea Swallow Festival, where it won the silver award.

In 1979, Zavaroni had her own TV series on the BBC titled &quot;Lena Zavaroni and Music&quot; and from 1980 to 1982 she had a TV series titled &quot;Lena&quot;.

===Later years===
From the age of 13, Zavaroni suffered from anorexia nervosa. While she was at stage school, her weight dropped to . She blamed this on the pressure placed upon her to fit into costumes while at the same time &quot;developing as a woman&quot;. She continued to have anorexia throughout the 1980s.

In 1989, Zavaroni married computer consultant Peter Wiltshire. The couple settled in north London but separated 18 months later. The same year, Zavaroni&#x27;s mother Hilda died of a tranquilliser overdose, and a fire destroyed all of her show business mementos.

After the breakup of her marriage, Zavaroni moved to Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, to be nearer to her father and his second wife. By this time, she was living on state benefits and, in 1999, was accused of stealing a 50p packet of jelly, but the charges were later dropped.

===Health issues and death===

Zavaroni underwent drug treatments and received electroconvulsive therapy in an attempt to end her depression. She begged doctors to operate on her to relieve her depression. Although the operation would not cure her anorexia, she was desperate for it to proceed, and threatened suicide if it did not (she also took a drug overdose).

In September 1999, Zavaroni was admitted to University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff for the psychosurgical operation. It took place on 7 September and was described as &quot;pioneering&quot;. After the operation, she appeared to be in satisfactory condition, and after a week she was &quot;making telephone calls, cheerful and engaging in conversation&quot;, even asking her doctor if he thought there was any chance that she would get back on stage and sing again. However, three weeks after the operation, she contracted pneumonia, which saw her weight drop to less than . She died from bronchial pneumonia on 1 October.

Although some reports said that the surgery was a lobotomy (also known as a leucotomy), the hospital said that it was not, and the treatment was intended for depression, rather than anorexia, as was rumoured at the time.

Her funeral took place at the Roman Catholic Church of St Augustine in Hoddesdon on 15 October 1999, and she was buried later that day at Hoddesdon Cemetery in Hertfordshire.

== Legacy ==
A BBC Scotland documentary, &quot;Lena Zavaroni: The Forgotten Child Star&quot;, was first broadcast in September 2024. It aired on BBC Two in December 2024.

<doc id="1262396" wikidata="Q1775997" url="?curid=1262396" title="Østensjøvannet">
<text>Østensjøvannet () is a lake located in the Østensjø borough in Oslo, Norway. It is well known for the wide variety of birds and other wildlife that can be found there. It is currently a wildlife preserve, though urban development posed a serious threat to the lake and its environs during the 1980s and early 1990s.
== Etymology ==
Østensjøvannet (&quot;Østensjø lake&quot;) is named after the Østensjø farm (old Norse &quot;Austansjór&quot;). The first element is &quot;austan&quot; &#x27;east of&#x27;, and the last element is &quot;sjór&quot; &#x27;sea, lake&#x27;. The farm was situated on the lake&#x27;s east side. The last element is the finite form of &quot;vann&quot; &#x27;water; lake&#x27;. The meaning of the name is then &#x27;the lake belonging to Østensjø&#x27;.

== Wildlife ==
Østensjøvannet is well known for its birdlife, and over 200 different species of birds have been sighted at or near the lake, quite a significant number by Norwegian standards.
Other wildlife is regularly sighted at the lake, but the variety of species is not much different from surrounding places, such as Østmarka.
Fishing during the summer is forbidden, while ice-fishing is allowed.

== Cultural history ==
Finds in the area suggest that people may have been living in the area as far back as the stone age. Farming in the area started around 500 AD. At various locations surrounding the lake, there are burial mounds from the Viking Age.

&quot;Abildsø gård&quot;, located on the lake&#x27;s west side, was Norway&#x27;s second farm school. It was where Minna Wetlesen started Europe&#x27;s, and possibly the world&#x27;s first &quot;household&quot; - school where girls and young women could learn about running a household and performing the various tasks related to it.

== Environmental issues ==
The lake itself has been a wildlife preserve since 1992, while Abildsø gård was preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage (&quot;Riksantikvar&quot;) in 1997. In 2002, the Oslo city council passed plans for the &quot;Østensjøvannet Environmental Park&quot;, which in effect preserves the various habitats and &quot;green areas&quot; surrounding the lake.

Situated inside the Oslo city limits, surrounded on all sides by built-up areas, has put a considerable strain on the lake, both in terms of pollution (especially caused by leaks from less-than-perfectly maintained sewage systems) and plans for using the fields and forested areas surrounding the lake for various purposes, including housing, a cemetery and even a small golf course. The sewage systems affecting the lake have been better maintained in recent years, and the environmental state of the lake is currently much better than it was a decade or two ago.

<doc id="1262397" wikidata="Q1909045" url="?curid=1262397" title="List of TAP Air Portugal destinations">
<text>TAP Air Portugal was founded as a division of Portugal&#x27;s Civil Aviation Department under the name &quot;Transportes Aéreos Portugueses&quot; on 14 March 1945, and started operations on 19 September 1946, initially serving the Lisbon–Madrid route using the Douglas DC-3. A year later, the carrier added a route to Angola and Mozambique, at the time claimed to be the world&#x27;s longest route operated with a Douglas DC-3, having 13 intermediate stops.

In 1957, the airline deployed Super Constellations on the Lisbon–London and Lisbon–Paris sectors, yet operations of the type date back to , when these aircraft started flying the route that linked Portugal with Portuguese Angola and Portuguese Mozambique. By , the carrier&#x27;s network consisted of the long-haul Lisbon–Kano–Leopoldville–Luanda–Lourenço Marques route, as well as medium- and short-haul routes radiating from Lisbon and serving Casablanca, London, Madrid, Paris and Tangier, and a single domestic flight between Lisbon and Oporto. On 1 November 1962, the airline started services between Lisbon and London, flying the route using the Sud Aviation Caravelle, taking over the services that had been operated by British European Airways on behalf of the company.

, TAP Portugal was the European airline with the most destinations in Brazil (10), being the leader in terms of passengers transported between this country and Europe, in comparison with their European counterparts, as well as with the Brazilian ones. As of August 2012, the airline was the third largest to serve Latin America by number of passengers; , the carrier shifted to the fourth place in the Europe-Latin America sector. Data from the latest financial report, corresponding to the fiscal year 2012, showed that the airline had its main source of traffic in Europe, and their most important long-haul market was South America.

Apart from Brazil, the countries with the most destinations served by the carrier are Spain (7), France (6) and Germany (5). TAP Portugal also flies to other 25 international destinations in Europe, 15 in Africa, in the United States and one more in Latin America (Caracas). At the end of 2013, TAP announced its plan to start flying to additional destinations in Europe during 2014 (Nantes, Hannover, Tallinn, Gothenburg, Belgrade and Saint Petersburg), whose schedule was announced before 31 March 2014. , the number of destinations in Brazil served by the carrier increased to 12 with the addition of Belém and Manaus to the route network.

<text>In physics, dephasing is a mechanism that recovers classical behaviour from a quantum system. It refers to the ways in which coherence caused by perturbation decays over time, and the system returns to the state before perturbation. It is an important effect in molecular and atomic spectroscopy, and in the condensed matter physics of mesoscopic devices.

The reason can be understood by describing the conduction in metals as a classical phenomenon with quantum effects all embedded into an effective mass that can be computed quantum mechanically, as also happens to resistance that can be seen as a scattering effect of conduction electrons. When the temperature is lowered and the dimensions of the device are meaningfully reduced, this classical behaviour should disappear and the laws of quantum mechanics should govern the behavior of conducting electrons seen as waves that move ballistically inside the conductor without any kind of dissipation. Most of the time this is what one observes. But it appeared as a surprise to uncover that the so-called dephasing time, that is the time it takes for the conducting electrons to lose their quantum behavior, becomes finite rather than infinite when the temperature approaches zero in mesoscopic devices violating the expectations of the theory of Boris Altshuler, Arkady Aronov and David E. Khmelnitskii. This kind of saturation of the dephasing time at low temperatures is an open problem even as several proposals have been put forward.

The coherence of a sample is explained by the off-diagonal elements of a density matrix. An external electric or magnetic field can create coherences between two quantum states in a sample if the frequency corresponds to the energy gap between the two states. The coherence terms decay with the dephasing time or spin–spin relaxation, &quot;T&quot;2.

After coherence is created in a sample by light, the sample emits a polarization wave, the frequency of which is equal to and the phase of which is inverted from the incident light. In addition, the sample is excited by the incident light and a population of molecules in the excited state is generated. The light passing through the sample is absorbed because of these two processes, and it is expressed by an absorption spectrum. The coherence decays with the time constant, &quot;T&quot;2, and the intensity of the polarization wave is reduced. The population of the excited state also decays with the time constant of the longitudinal relaxation, &quot;T&quot;1. The time constant &quot;T&quot;2 is usually much smaller than &quot;T&quot;1, and the bandwidth of the absorption spectrum is related to these time constants by the Fourier transform, so the time constant &quot;T&quot;2 is a main contributor to the bandwidth. The time constant &quot;T&quot;2 has been measured with ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy directly, such as in photon echo experiments.

What is the dephasing rate of a particle that has an energy &quot;E&quot; if it is subject to a fluctuating environment that has a temperature &quot;T&quot;? In particular what is the dephasing rate close to equilibrium (&quot;E~T&quot;), and what happens in the zero temperature limit? This question has fascinated the mesoscopic community during the last two decades (see references below).

<text>Meir Lublin or Meir ben Gedalia (1558 – 1616) was a Polish rabbi, Talmudist and Posek (&quot;decisor of Jewish law&quot;). He is well known for his commentary on the Talmud, &quot;Meir Einai Chachamim&quot;. He is also referred to as MaHaRam (Hebrew acronym: &quot;Our Teacher, Rabbi Meir&quot;).

==Biography==
MaHaRam was born in Lublin, Poland. He was descended from a family of rabbis, and his father, Gedalia, was an eminent Talmudist. His principal teacher was his father-in-law, Isaac ha-Kohen Shapiro, rabbi of Kraków. MaHaRam&#x27;s knowledge of the Talmud and Poskim was such that he was invited to the rabbinate of Kraków in 1587, when he was not yet thirty years old. In 1591 he became rabbi at Lemberg. (In Lemberg he was engaged in a controversy with Rabbi Joshua Falk concerning a bill of divorce.) In 1613 he became rabbi at Lublin and established a yeshiva. He was well known in the role of Rosh Yeshiva there, owing to his renown as a Talmudic scholar. Many of his students became prominent rabbis or heads of yeshivot; his most famous student is probably Isaiah Horowitz (&quot;Shelah HaKodesh&quot;).
A daughter of the MaHaRam was married to Benjamin Beinisch Gelernter, whose parents were Rabbi Zachariah Mendel Gelernter and the daughter of the Maharal of Prague. One of his sisters married Yehuda ha-Kohen Katz and they had Moshe ha-Kohen Katz as their son, who in turn will marry Nessla Wahl, granddaughter of Saul Wahl, who is said to have been King of Poland for one day, and with whom he had six children.

While the MaHaRam served as Dayan and Rabbi in Lemberg a dispute broke out between him and Rabbi Joshua Falk (known as the Sema) regarding a bill of divorce. The controversy turned out ugly and the MaHaRam offended the honor of rabbi Joshua Falk. Rabbi Abraham Shrenzel, a student of Joshua Falk and an influential scholar, thus avenged the honor of his rabbi and the MaHaRam was forced to leave the city by order of the local government.

R&#x27; Meir was a sharp polemicist and critical of the people around him, and did not refrain from criticizing the most respected scholars of his generation, including the Rema, Beis Yosef, Maharsha, Maharshal. He even disagreed with the Rishonim when he felt that they have erred. He was forceful in rejecting opinions of his own &quot;without any doubt, and there is no way of settling [the issue] in any other way.&quot; When the Maharsha&#x27;s commentary to the Talmud was first printed, he dismissed it and wrote, &quot;from what I wrote you can see that he can&#x27;t find his hands and feet in the house of learning, and it is an error.&quot; Only later when he realized that the Maharsha was a greatly respected scholar, he confessed to him &quot;and what happened happened, and love covers all sins.&quot; When a rabbi in Worms, whom he thought to be a lesser authority than him, rejected his opinion he was deeply offended. He writes that he wanted to embarrass him in the synagogue of Lublin and to convene with the leaders of the communities to demote him from his position, but he decided not to because &quot;perhaps it will be an honor for him that a person like me is occupied with someone like him&quot;.

While he served as the head of the Yeshiva in Lublin, R&#x27; Shimon Wolf Auerbach, the son-in-law of the Maharshal, headed another Yeshiva in the same town. They both had different styles of interpretation, and this usually lead to quarreling among the students as everyone claimed that their Rabbi had the correct way. From then on, the communal leaders decreed that the students could not tell one another of the new interpretation of the Rabbis and that whoever violated this ban would be expelled from the Yeshiva. However, this didn&#x27;t last for too long. When the MaHaRam once had difficulty explaining Tosafot and was eager to find out how R&#x27; Shimon Wolf had resolved the issue, he asked his students to find out. When the right opportunity came up, they grabbed one of the students of R&#x27; Shimon Wolf, beat him up and forced him to repeat the interpretation of his Rabbi. When the MaHaRam heard of it, he openly declared that only his interpretation is the correct one. A great controversy flared up between the two Yeshivot. The leaders of Lublin decided that they would send a letter to Shlomo Aboav Rav of Amsterdam to decide which one is the correct interpretation, and whichever interpretation he deems appropriate, the other would lose the right to remain as head of the Yeshiva. When the answer came back from Amsterdam it was clear that it was in favor of R Shimon Wolf. The communal leaders decided to demote the MaHaRam of his position as head of the Yeshiva. But the humble R Shimon Wolf refused to accept this decision. Instead, they invited the Maharsha to assume the Rabbinate in Lublin. The Maharsha gave a sermon on Shabbat night and convinced the community of Lublin to keep both of these Torah giants among them, and the controversy ended.

==Works==
Meir Einei Chachamim is his best known work, a &quot;casuistic commentary&quot; on the Talmud, Rashi, and Tosafot together. It was published by his son Gedaliah and has since been printed in all principal editions of the Talmud under the heading &quot;MaHaRam.&quot; It is considered one of the important commentaries on the Talmud. The commentary, generally, employs short and simple explanations.

After his death, over 140 of the Halachic questions posed to him were published in a collection of responsa entitled &quot;Manhir Einei Chachamim&quot;.

<text>Shmuel Eidels (1555 – 1631) ( Shmuel Eliezer HaLevi Eidels) was a renowned rabbi and Talmudist famous for his commentary on the Talmud, &quot;Chiddushei Halachot&quot;. Eidels is also known as Maharsha (, a Hebrew acronym for &quot;Our Teacher, the Rabbi Shmuel Eidels&quot;).

==Biography==
The Maharsha was born in Kraków in Poland. His father, Yehuda, was a Talmudist and both parents were descendants of rabbinic families—his mother Gitel was a cousin of Rabbi Yehuda Loew, the Maharal of Prague, and his father &quot;was a direct descendant of Rabbi Yehuda HaChasid.&quot; From early childhood, the Maharsha&#x27;s remarkable talents were evident. Maharsha studied and was a student of Rabbi Shalom Shachne in his yeshivah. When he came of marriageable age, the Maharsha was offered many prestigious shidduchim (marriage partners), but he rejected them, asserting that he wanted to devote himself solely to Torah study.

He married the daughter of Edel Lifschitz of Posen and the late Moshe Lifschitz, rabbi of Brisk. He then moved to Posen and, with his mother-in-law&#x27;s financial help, established a yeshiva there. She supported it for over 2 decades, including &quot;taking care of every bachur&#x27;s needs.&quot;

In appreciation of her support he adopted her name. After her death, he served as rabbi in the following prominent communities: Chelm (1610), Lublin, Tiktin and Ostroh. Eidels was also active in the Council of Four Lands.

His son-in-law was R. Moses ben Isaac Bonems of Lublin, who authored his own novellæ on the Talmud, published with the &quot;Ḥiddushe Halakhot&quot;, last recension (&quot;Mahdura Batra&quot;).

The Maharsha died &quot;5 days in(to) the month of Kislev, year&quot; 5392.

==Works==
Chiddushei Halachot ( - &quot;Novellae in Jewish Law&quot;) is an &quot;incisive and keenly analytical&quot; commentary on the Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot together, and with a focus on Tosafot. It is said that if one grasps the Maharsha, then one has understood the Tosafot. This commentary was quickly accepted and was printed in almost all editions of the Talmud. &quot;Chiddushei Halachot&quot; is based on Maharsha&#x27;s teaching in his yeshiva, and he refrained from printing his commentary on those pages that were studied while he served on the Council of Four Lands.

The Maharsha also wrote an extensive commentary on the aggadot of the Talmud known as the Chiddushei Aggadot ( - &quot;Novellae in Aggadah&quot;) reflecting a wide knowledge of philosophy and Kabbalah. &quot;Maharsha on Aggados&quot; is a multi-volume translation by Rabbi Avraham Yaakov Finkel.

Upon the publication of his works, the Maharsha wrote that he regretted publishing the commentaries as two different works, rather than as one large intertwined work in the style of the Halacha and Aggada found in the Talmud; the Maharsha called upon future publishers to combine his works into one. Per the Maharsha&#x27;s wishes, virtually all printed editions of his commentary found on the back of Gemaras today features the two works combined into one long running commentary with different fonts to differentiate between the Chiddushei Halachot and Chiddushei Aggadot.

In the book Leader of the Generation: Rabbi Ezra Attieh, it is stated that of all the commentaries written on the Torah, that of the Maharsha was the favorite of Rabbi Ezra Attieh.

==Legacy==
The Great Maharsha Synagogue in Ostroh (Ukraine) was named in his honour.

<doc id="1262407" wikidata="Q2227260" url="?curid=1262407" title="Acid-set cheese">
<text>Acid-set or sour milk cheese is cheese that has been curdled (coagulated) by natural souring, often from lactic acid bacteria, or by the addition of acid. This type of cheese is technologically simple to produce.

When making soft acid-set cheese using bacteria, the coagulum results from production of lactic acid by the starter microorganisms.

Cheeses can be classified according to a variety of features including ripening characteristics, special processing techniques (such as cheddaring) or method of coagulation. Acid-setting is a method of coagulation that accounts for around 25% of cheese production. These are generally fresh cheeses like, queso blanco, quark and cream cheese. The other 75%, which includes almost all ripened cheeses, are rennet cheeses.

Ricotta and most other whey cheeses are made by first heating the milk to between 90 and 92 degrees Celsius to create coprecipitation of casein and whey protein before addition of lactic or citric acid.

==Production==
Rennet is also sometimes used in the processing of other fresh, soft cheeses like fromage frais, but it is not an essential ingredient and these cheeses can be produced by traditional methods without rennet or other enzymes.

Ricotta is a high-moisture cheese, like cottage cheese, but it is not a pressed curd cheese. It can be made from whey or a blend of milk and whey. Traditionally, ricotta was produced from the whey byproduct of mozzarella and provolone production, but modern techniques usually use whole milk (sometimes without any whey). Milk can be blended into the whey to improve curd cohesiveness, neutralize the acid in whey and increase yield. This mixture of milk and whey is heated before enough food grade acid is added to drop the pH to the needed level (this could be some type of lactic, citric or acetic acid). Whichever type of acid is used by the cheesemaker it is important to maintain correct pH levels for the sweetness of the cheese&#x27;s flavor. Some methods of mass-produced cheeses will use food grade caustic soda to neutralize the acid of the whey, before heating the blend and adding the coagulating acid.

==Regional varieties==

In Germany the term &quot;Sauermilchkäse&quot; is usually applied to ripened acid-set cheeses only, but not to fresh cheeses. The various types of ripened sour milk cheese include:
* Handkäse
* Harzer
* Nieheimer
* Olomoucké syrečky (Olmützer Quargel)
* Tyrolean grey cheese

<doc id="1262411" wikidata="Q740553" url="?curid=1262411" title="Bpost">
<text>Bpost (stylised &quot;bpost&quot;), also known as the Belgian Post Group, is the Belgian company responsible for the delivery of mail in Belgium. The Belgian Post Group is one of the largest civilian employers in Belgium. It provides a range of postal, courier, direct marketing, banking, insurance, and electronic services in a highly competitive European market. The headquarters are located in Brussels at the Muntcenter (Bisschopsstraat).

Before 2010, it was known as De Post in Dutch and La Poste in French, meaning &quot;the Post&quot; in each case in English.

== Ownership ==

By Royal Decree of 17 March 2000, The Post cast off its status of autonomous public enterprise to adopt the status of a public limited liability company. Its public service missions are all described that it concluded with the Belgian State.

In January 2006, Post Danmark and CVC Capital Partners signed an agreement with the Belgian Government on the acquisition of 50% minus one share in the Belgian Post for €300 million. Post Danmark had been selected by the Belgian Government a partner because it would assist bpost in modernizing the company. The Belgian Government, bpost, Post Danmark and CVC have prepared a joint plan for developing the Belgian Post.

==Acquisitions==

Certipost is a Belgian electronic communications subsidiary of bpost based in Aalst founded in 2002. They produce solutions to issues with electronic document exchange and archiving including digital certificate and electronic identity cards.

In October 2017, bpost acquired American e-commerce company Radial, Inc. for US$820 million.

==Controversies==

Bpost is accused of having entered into spurious contracts with the Belgian Government, overstating costs for delivering newspapers to receive elevated subsidies and a host of other allegedly fraudulent operations. In April 2023 Bpost was forced to admit it had broken European competition rules and had overcharged by tens of millions of Euros amid reports of secret deals between the company and the Belgian state. In total, Bpost is said to have received €4 billion in public spending between 2013 and 2023. According to journalists, most of these subsidies and fees are questionable and are the result of close ties between the Belgian state and the company.

Bpost use monopoly power to allegedly make questionable price-fixing agreements with publishers DPG media and Mediahuis, as was revealed by an internal audit in 2023.

In August 2023, Kathleen Van Beveren, chief executive of E-logistics Eurasia at Bpost and a member of its executive committee, stepped down from her role amid accusations of fraud and foul play inside the company.

<doc id="1262421" wikidata="Q4724160" url="?curid=1262421" title="Algernon Lyons">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Algernon McLennan Lyons (30 August 1833 – 9 February 1908) was a senior Royal Navy officer who served as First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp to Queen Victoria.

Lyons also served as Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station, Commander-in-Chief, North America and West Indies Station, and then Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth.

He was the nephew of Admiral Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons, who served as Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, under whom he served for a time, and the cousin of Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons, and Richard Lyons Pearson, Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.

==Family==

Lyons was born at Bombay on 30 August 1833. He was the second son of Lieutenant General Humphrey Lyons (1833–1908) and his first wife, Eliza, daughter of Henry Bennett. Lyons&#x27;s uncle was Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons, via whom he was the cousin of Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons. He was also the cousin of Richard Lyons Pearson, Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Lyons&#x27;s grandfather was Captain John Lyons of Antigua.

Lyons was privately educated in Twickenham, Middlesex. He joined the Royal Navy in 1847.

==Naval career==

Lyons was appointed to the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Cambrian&quot; on the East Indies and China Station and then transferred to the second-rate HMS &quot;Albion&quot;, flagship of his uncle, Sir Edmund Lyons, who was Second-in-Command of the Mediterranean Fleet, in 1853.
Lyons was promoted to mate in October 1853 and transferred to the paddle frigate HMS &quot;Firebrand&quot;, which was engaged in the blockade of the Danube Delta, which was being held by the Russians at the start of the Crimean War. Lyons was promoted to lieutenant on 26 June 1854.

===Lyons’s Rampage at the Danube===

During the blockade of the mouth of the Danube, Captain Parker, Lyons&#x27;s commanding officer, decided to attack the guardhouses and signal stations higher up the River, for these were responsible for the supply and communication of the Russian enemy. On 8 July, Captain Parker proceeded up the Danube, the banks of which were lined by Cossacks, who opened fire. When he reached the first Russian fort, defended by a stockade and a battery, Captain Parker was shot and killed by a Cossack.

When Parker was killed, Lyons took control of the British boats and proceeded to destroy not only the first Russian signal station, but the next four signal stations up the River, causing the Russians to flee. For this, he was mentioned in dispatches.

Lyons then became commander of HMS Firebrand for the bombardment of Sevastopol in October 1854, which was led by his uncle, Admiral Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons. When the British flagship, HMS &quot;Albion&quot;, was set on fire by the Russians, Lyons attached it, whilst burning, to his own ship and towed it to safety.

===Kerch and Kinburn===

In December 1854, Lyons&#x27;s uncle Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons, became Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet and appointed Lyons as his Flag-Lieutenant. Lyons commanded the first-rate HMS &quot;Royal Albert&quot;, in December 1854 during the operations at Kerch in October 1854 and at the Battle of Kinburn in October 1855. He was promoted to commander on 9 August.

===American Civil War===

Lyons became commanding officer of the sloop HMS &quot;Racer&quot; on the North America and West Indies Station in May 1860. In HMS &quot;Racer&quot; he had the difficult task of protecting British merchant vessels seeking to evade the blockade being imposed by the United States Navy on Confederate ports.

===Pacific Station===

Lyons was promoted to captain on 1 December 1862. He became commanding officer of the corvette HMS &quot;Charybdis&quot; on the Pacific Station in January 1867 and commanding officer of the frigate in a detached squadron in October 1872.
He was appointed Commodore-in-Charge at Jamaica in 1875. In April 1878 he became commanding officer of the armoured turret ship HMS &quot;Monarch&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in April 1878. He was deployed to Constantinople during his tour in HMS &quot;Monarch&quot;.

===Admiral===
Lyons was promoted to rear-admiral on 26 September 1878. He became Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station, with his flag in the armoured ship HMS &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, in December 1881. On 27 October 1884, he was promoted to vice-admiral. He became Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station in September 1886: in this position, his flagship was the central battery ship HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, in September 1886.
Lyons was promoted to admiral on 15 December 1888 and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1889.

===Admiral of the Fleet===
He was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth, in June 1892. He became a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in June 1897 and was promoted Admiral of the Fleet on 23 August 1897. In February 1895, he was appointed First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp to Queen Victoria.

He was a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for Glamorgan.

He retired on 30 August 1903.
==Marriage==

Lyons married Louisa Jane Penrice (bapt. 1853), daughter and heir of Thomas Penrice, at Pennard Church in Kilvrough on 3 September 1879: they had two sons and two daughters. Their residence was Kilvrough Manor in Glamorgan, where he died on 9 February 1908.

<text>The Wanapitei River (French: &quot;Rivière Wanapitei&quot;) is a river in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Great Lakes Basin and is a right tributary of the French River.

The river&#x27;s source is Scotia Lake, a small lake east of Halfway Lake Provincial Park in Sudbury District. From there, it flows north and east, taking in two small tributaries and continuing to a point 20 kilometres southwest of the Ishpatina Ridge, where it turns south. After approximately 60 kilometres, the river flows into Lake Wanapitei in the northeastern portion of Greater Sudbury. At the south end of the lake, the river continues, flowing south until it joins the French River near the latter&#x27;s mouth on Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. The river is approximately in length and is a popular wilderness canoeing route.

Ontario Power Generation operates three hydroelectric generating stations on the river as well as one control dam, at Wanapitei Lake.

The river&#x27;s name comes from the Ojibwa word &quot;waanabidebiing&quot;, or &quot;concave-tooth [shaped] water&quot;, which describes the shape of Lake Wanapitei. A community which takes its name from the river is spelled Wahnapitae. However, the Wanapitei spelling is correct for both the lake and the river.

On June 2, 2013, a rail bridge crossing the Wanapitei River at Wanup collapsed, causing a train derailment.

<text>Kamaʻāina (, &#x27;child or person of the land&#x27;) is a word describing Hawaii residents regardless of their racial background who were born in Hawaii, as opposed to which means a person of Native Hawaiian ancestry. A may be considered to be someone who lives in Hawaii, or may be expanded to include people who once lived there but have moved away.

There is a statewide job placement program, founded in 1998 and sponsored by the Hawaii Island Economic Development Board, called &quot;Kamaʻaina Come Home&quot;. The initiative is intended to increase the state&#x27;s labor pool by inducing Hawaii college students and former residents who are now living in the continental United States to return to Hawaii. 

Many businesses in Hawaii offer a &quot;rate&quot;, an often sizable discount given to local residents. These rates are offered primarily at restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions. Merchants generally offer these &quot; discounts&quot; to anyone with a local ID, such as a Hawaii driver&#x27;s license or local military ID.

<text>Harzer cheese is a German sour milk cheese made from low fat curd cheese, which originates in the Harz mountain region south of Braunschweig.

Harzer is often small and round, in which case it is called &quot;Handkäse&quot; or &quot;Taler&quot;, or cylindrical, in which case it is called &quot;Stangenkäse&quot;. Frequently, the small and round variety is sold in a cylindrical package, which is then called &quot;Harzer Rolle&quot;.

Harzer cheese is typically flavored with caraway spice. Some varieties are white mold cheeses, others, red mold; the latter type generally has a stronger flavor. Both types develop a strong aroma after maturing for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Harzer has both a distinctive strong smell and flavor.

Harzer contains very little fat (less than 1%) but extremely high protein (usually around 30%), and is thus often used for special diets and sport nutrition.

<text>Definite Article is the title of British comedian Eddie Izzard&#x27;s 1996 performance, which was released on VHS and later on DVD. It was recorded on different nights at the Shaftesbury Theatre. Both recordings cover topics such as &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, Pavlov&#x27;s dogs, and European languages.

==Trivia==
At the beginning of the show, Eddie arrives on stage through a huge book which opens to reveal her sitting at the top of a staircase. The backdrop then closes and from then on, the background changes at various intervals with words from selected literature projected onto the pages of the huge book. The chosen selections are:

* &quot;A Marriage Proposal&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Proposal&quot;) - Anton Chekhov
* &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; - Lewis Carroll
* &quot;Macbeth&quot; - Shakespeare
* &quot;Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; - Thomas Hardy
* &quot;Edward II&quot; - Christopher Marlowe
* &quot;Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall&quot; - Spike Milligan

<doc id="1262443" wikidata="Q48767294" url="?curid=1262443" title="List of Aer Lingus destinations">
<text>This is a combined list of destinations operated by Aer Lingus, its subsidiary Aer Lingus UK, and regional franchise Aer Lingus Regional . The airline currently operates scheduled and limited charter flights to/from a total of 93 airports, across 24 countries in Europe, North America, the Canary Islands, and a seasonal flight to the Asian portion of Turkey.

== History ==
On 23 March 2020, Stobart Air which operated under the Aer Lingus Regional brand announced it would suspend all international flights due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its public service obligation (PSO) flights from Dublin Airport to Donegal Airport and Kerry Airport would continue.

On 29 March 2020, Aer Lingus began temporarily operating flights to Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA: PEK). This destination was organized in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to collect personal protective equipment which was made in China for use in Ireland. The flights were not available for passenger bookings and did not carry flight attendants.

On 24 March 2021, Aer Lingus announced the launch of four new routes from Manchester Airport; New York–JFK and Orlando from 29 July 2021, Barbados from 20 October 2021 and Boston from summer 2022.

On 12 June 2021, Stobart Air, the operator of Aer Lingus Regional flights, entered liquidation, resulting in Aer Lingus Regional ceasing operations with immediate effect.

In October 2022, it was announced that Aer Lingus operations between Belfast City and London–Heathrow would transfer to Aer Lingus UK due to Brexit-related requirements that a European carrier could no longer fly domestic routes within the United Kingdom. These flights are operated by British Airways under Wet-Lease terms using the Aer Lingus UK flight numbers and callsigns. This currently does not affect the operations carried out by Emerald Airlines from Belfast City as an agreement is in place between the UK CAA, British Airways and themselves before Emerald Airlines securing a UK AOC.

<doc id="1262451" wikidata="Q7607427" url="?curid=1262451" title="William Herbert, 18th Earl of Pembroke">
<text>William Alexander Sidney Herbert, 18th Earl of Pembroke, 15th Earl of Montgomery (born 18 May 1978) is an English peer. He became earl in 2003 following the death of his father, the 17th Earl.

==Early life==

Pembroke is the only son of Henry Herbert, 17th Earl of Pembroke, by his first wife, Claire. 

He has three older sisters (including Lady Emma Herbert) and three younger half-sisters by his father&#x27;s second marriage. He was educated at Bryanston School, and then at the University of Leeds for two years, where he took a foundation course in 3D computer graphics design. He then pursued a course in industrial design at Sheffield Hallam University and became the first Herbert to graduate with a first class honours degree.

In 2003, his father died, and he inherited the ancestral titles and estates, based on Wilton House, the family seat in Wiltshire.

==Career==

After graduating, Pembroke worked with Terence Conran as an industrial designer. In October 2004, a year after his father&#x27;s death, he left that job to assume the responsibilities of managing the house and estate at Wilton. In an interview with &quot;The Observer&quot; in July 2005, he spoke frankly of the responsibilities and difficulties in managing a historic home and estate. He wanted to increase the number of celebrity events, such as Madonna&#x27;s birthday party, at Wilton House to increase revenues; however, opening the property to more tourists does not pay in the long run, he said, as it increases wear-and-tear on the house. He also spoke of the need for him to marry and father a son to secure the succession, for the sake of his immediate family and also of the estate and house and all those who depend on them for a livelihood. His heir presumptive at that time was a distant cousin, the present George Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon (born 1956).

, the Wilton estate had around 30 employees. Its 14,000 acres are divided into 14 farms, one of which is run by the estate, and more than 200 residential properties. Although the house is open to the public, Pembroke and his wife occupy about a third of the house privately.

Since 2006, he has held the position of President of the Stars Appeal, a fundraising charity for Salisbury district hospital, and an active member of its fundraising committee. Since 2010, in partnership with his wife Victoria, he has overseen an extensive programme of renovation both externally and internally at Wilton along with its surrounding buildings and structures. The work has subsequently received a number of awards and accolades. In 2021 Pembroke completed an MSc in Rural Estate Management at the Royal Agricultural University, Cirencester.

==Motoring==
A keen car and motor racing enthusiast, Pembroke has raced at Le Mans in a Jaguar D-Type and in the Funcup endurance series since 2009. In 2011, he had a class win in the Spa 25 hour race against 120 international teams. He used to hold an annual Classic and Supercar show in the grounds of Wilton House but it was cancelled in 2017 for unknown reasons. He has owned various classic cars, and his road car collection includes a Mercedes 300SL, an Invicta Type-S &#x27;Low Chassis&#x27; and a Porsche 911.

In a 2019 interview with Campden FB, he offered advice to those looking to diversify their investment portfolios with the addition of vintage cars, highlighting the taxable benefits, but also some of the potential pitfalls.

==Personal life==
In April 2009, Pembroke announced his engagement to his long-time girlfriend, Victoria Bullough. They were married on 29 May 2010 at the parish church of St Mary and St Nicholas in Wilton, near Salisbury.

Their first child, Lady Alexandra, was born on 3 April 2011. A son and heir apparent, Reginald Henry Michael, Lord Herbert, was born on 21 October 2012. A third child, Louis Charles Alexander Herbert, was born on 20 September 2014, and a fourth, Lady Beatrice Aurelia Skye Herbert, on 15 March 2016.

The Countess of Pembroke is a daughter of Michael Bullough, owner of McEwens, a department store in Scotland. Her mother, Sandra Lee-Graham Bullough, is a former model. She grew up in Huntingtower, Perth, and was educated at Glenalmond College, and then studied interior architecture at Chelsea College of Art and Design. While there, she appeared in &quot;Country Life&quot; and met Lord Pembroke. She is now a patroness of the Royal Caledonian Ball.

Pembroke is collaterally related to the Meyrick Family, who seat a number of nearby Lordships.

==Succession==
Since Herbert&#x27;s father had no brothers, and his grandfather&#x27;s brothers died unmarried, and other lines of descent from earlier earls have become extinct, the heir presumptive to the earldoms of Pembroke (created 1551 by Edward VI) and Montgomery (created for the brother of the 3rd Earl, who succeeded him as 4th Earl) was the 8th Earl of Carnarvon (born 10 November 1956), holding the earldom created in 1793 for the first son of the second surviving son of the 8th Earl. However, since their marriage in 2010, the 18th Earl and Countess have produced two daughters and two sons; the heir apparent is Reginald, Lord Herbert, born in 2012.

<text>The 1977 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 2, 1977, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was the fifteenth race of the 1977 World Championship of F1 Drivers and the 1977 International Cup for F1 Constructors. The event was also referred to as the United States Grand Prix East in order to distinguish it from the United States Grand Prix West held on April 3, 1977, in Long Beach, California. It was covered on American radio by Motor Racing Network.

The 59-lap race was won from pole position by James Hunt, driving a McLaren-Ford. In wet conditions, Hunt held off a late charge from Mario Andretti in the Lotus-Ford to take his second consecutive Watkins Glen victory. Jody Scheckter was third in the Wolf-Ford, while Niki Lauda clinched his second Drivers&#x27; Championship by finishing fourth in his Ferrari.

==Report==
For the first time, the American race was being held before the Canadian Grand Prix, which would follow a week later. Lauda led the championship with 69 points, while Jody Scheckter was second with 42 points. With nine points being awarded for a win, Lauda needed only to score one point in any of the final three races to clinch the title, while Scheckter needed to win them all to have a chance (both would be on 69 points, but Scheckter would have the tiebreaker on wins with 5, compared to Lauda&#x27;s 3).

From the start of practice on Friday, Hunt&#x27;s McLaren was dominant, setting a track record of 1:40.863. Brabham teammates Hans-Joachim Stuck and John Watson were a quarter of a second back, followed by Andretti, Ronnie Peterson and the Ferraris of Carlos Reutemann and Lauda. On Saturday morning there was rain just before the end of untimed practice, and so the afternoon session served only as practice for a possible wet race on Sunday, as Friday&#x27;s times determined the grid.

Sunday began cold but dry, with a crowd over 100,000. Before the warmup, however, it began to drizzle, and by the five-minute signal, it had picked up enough that only John Watson was willing to gamble on starting with slicks. At the flag, everyone got away from the grid and through the first turn without incident, but the spray was so heavy that nothing was visible after the first five cars. Stuck quickly jumped ahead of Hunt, and after one lap, they were followed by Andretti, Reutemann, Peterson, Lauda, Scheckter, Jacques Laffite and Gunnar Nilsson.

Immediately, Scheckter began to take advantage of the others&#x27; uncertainty in the conditions and, by lap five had moved from ninth to fourth. Stuck was also going well in the wet, and, despite losing his clutch cable in the first few laps, pulled away from Hunt. Lauda passed his teammate Reutemann for fifth spot when the Argentine spun. On lap 15, with Hunt four seconds behind, Stuck, struggling to make gear changes without a clutch, popped out of gear entering a corner and went straight on. He retired with damage to the monocoque.

Hunt now led Andretti by 10.5 seconds, with Scheckter 14 seconds further back in third. The rain stopped, and drivers sought the wet sections of a drying track to cool their tires. With 10 laps remaining and the lead at 22 seconds, Hunt backed off in response to a pit signal. Lauda was coasting in fourth, a position sufficient to clinch the Championship. Scheckter had slowed in third to preserve his tires.

With two laps to go, Andretti, who had been closing while Hunt cruised home, was only 6.7 seconds behind. As they began the last lap, the margin had closed to 1.5 seconds, but Hunt increased his lead slightly to win by just over two seconds. The McLaren pit had not informed him how close the Lotus was until the start of the final lap, when Teddy Mayer gave him a frantic wave to pick up the pace.

Lauda thus took his second title, and Ferrari took their third consecutive Constructor&#x27;s Championship. For Lauda, it was the culmination of a comeback from the life-threatening injuries he had sustained at the Nürburgring in 1976. Almost immediately, the Austrian quit Ferrari, having already announced his intention to move to Brabham for 1978.

<text>The 1978 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 1, 1978, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. This event was also referred to as the United States Grand Prix East in order to distinguish it from the United States Grand Prix West held on April 2, 1978, in Long Beach, California.

At the preceding Italian Grand Prix, Mario Andretti had secured the driver&#x27;s championship. At Watkins Glen, Andretti put his Lotus 79 on the pole before a record crowd of over 150,000 fans, but Ferrari&#x27;s Carlos Reutemann completed a sweep of the two United States races in 1978 by finishing 19 seconds ahead of Australian Alan Jones. Andretti developed brake problems early on and would retire with a blown engine.

==Summary==
===Background and practice sessions===
Ronnie Peterson had been killed following a multiple car pile-up at the Italian Grand Prix. Following the race, the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association (GPDA) had a meeting centering on Riccardo Patrese, who the GPDA blamed for the crash. The GPDA filed an injunction to bar Patrese from participating in the 1978 United States Grand Prix weekend, which was allowed. Patrese, who believed that he was not to blame for the fatal accident at Monza, was furious at this action taken, and he tried unsuccessfully to stop the race from taking place.

Replacing the late Peterson for this race and the next one in Canada was Jean-Pierre Jarier.

Friday was warm and sunny, and Andretti set a new track record of 1:39.82. He later lowered that to 1:38.92, ahead of the Ferraris of Reutemann and Canadian rookie Gilles Villeneuve, then the two Brabhams of Niki Lauda and John Watson. American Brett Lunger, about to drive in his last Formula One race, was at the wheel of an Ensign for the first time, after his McLaren was damaged in the opening lap crash at Monza that claimed the life of Peterson. Bobby Rahal had been enlisted from Formula Atlantic to partner Jody Scheckter, as Canadian Walter Wolf was running two cars for the first time.

Starting carefully in his first F1 drive, Rahal took more than a second off his lap time in the Friday afternoon session, then another half-second on Saturday and qualified 20th. High winds on Saturday meant that only eight drivers improved their times, with Alan Jones jumping up to third spot on his last lap. Despite the wind, Andretti improved his pace-setting time to 1:38.114, more than a second ahead of Reutemann.

After Friday&#x27;s qualifying, Andretti had been so pleased with his car that he said, &quot;We don&#x27;t know any more that we can do. She is so right. What can I say?&quot; Race organizers feared that an Andretti win would trigger pandemonium in the massive crowd, and they had Mario and his wife, Dee Ann, pose for photos on the podium with the winner&#x27;s trophy before the race.

===Race===

Sunday produced threatening skies, but no rain. On the last lap of the morning warm-up, the rear stub axle on Andretti&#x27;s Lotus broke in the left-hander entering The Anvil (nicknamed &quot;Ickx&#x27;s Corner&quot; after a crash the Belgian had there in 1976). The car spun several times and then hit the barrier, knocking off a rear wheel. Faulty material in the part was blamed, and, with no time to test the spare car, Andretti used his teammate Jean-Pierre Jarier&#x27;s car for the race.

At the start, Andretti took the lead, while Emerson Fittipaldi and Héctor Rebaque (in 13th and 23rd places) both immediately burned out their clutches. Rebaque&#x27;s race was over, but Fittipaldi managed to get his car in gear, nursed it around for a lap while it cooled off, and then drove through the field to finish fifth.

After one lap, Andretti had a four car-length lead over Reutemann and Villeneuve. They were followed by Jones, Lauda, Jarier, Hunt, Watson and Scheckter. Knowing the car had a brake problem, Andretti was hoping he could cope with it, as he had at Monza. Immediately, his lead began to disintegrate. On lap three, Reutemann went by, and on lap four, Villeneuve. As the Ferraris pulled away, Jarier came in on lap 11 from 11th place to change a deflating front tire. After going back out, the car was still bottoming, but once his fuel load lightened, he set the race&#x27;s fastest lap, which would have qualified him third.

Nearing the halfway point, the Ferraris were running first and second. Then, on lap 23, Villeneuve&#x27;s engine blew a piston, and Jones, who had overtaken Andretti two laps earlier, inherited second, 35 seconds behind Reutemann. On lap 25, Lauda passed Andretti for third, and three laps later, Andretti&#x27;s engine blew. Scheckter and Jean-Pierre Jabouille&#x27;s Renault were battling for fourth, which became third when Lauda also blew up just a lap after Andretti. Jarier was immediately behind them and closing rapidly.

When Jabouille ran into brake trouble, he was caught by both Scheckter and Jarier. Jarier went by both of them to take third, while Scheckter also passed Jabouille to regain fourth. Jarier&#x27;s race ended with three and a half laps to go when he ran out of fuel, giving Scheckter the final podium position. Reutemann came home almost twenty seconds ahead of Jones to take the eighth Grand Prix win of his career, the third in the US. Jabouille&#x27;s fourth place scored the first points for Renault and the first for a turbocharged engine; within a few years, turbocharged engines dominated Formula One.

<doc id="1262460" wikidata="Q863696" url="?curid=1262460" title="Bond-dissociation energy">
<text>The bond-dissociation energy (BDE, D&quot;0, or DH°&quot;) is one measure of the strength of a chemical bond . It can be defined as the standard enthalpy change when is cleaved by homolysis to give fragments A and B, which are usually radical species. The enthalpy change is temperature-dependent, and the bond-dissociation energy is often defined to be the enthalpy change of the homolysis at 0 K (absolute zero), although the enthalpy change at 298 K (standard conditions) is also a frequently encountered parameter.

As a typical example, the bond-dissociation energy for one of the C−H bonds in ethane () is defined as the standard enthalpy change of the process
: &quot;DH&quot;°298() = Δ&quot;H°&quot; = 101.1(4) kcal/mol = 423.0 ± 1.7 kJ/mol = 4.40(2) eV (per bond).

To convert a molar BDE to the energy needed to dissociate the bond &quot;per molecule&quot;, the conversion factor 23.060 kcal/mol (96.485 kJ/mol) for each eV can be used.

A variety of experimental techniques, including spectrometric determination of energy levels, generation of radicals by pyrolysis or photolysis, measurements of chemical kinetics and equilibrium, and various calorimetric and electrochemical methods have been used to measure bond dissociation energy values. Nevertheless, bond dissociation energy measurements are challenging and are subject to considerable error. The majority of currently known values are accurate to within ±1 or 2 kcal/mol (4–10 kJ/mol). Moreover, values measured in the past, especially before the 1970s, can be especially unreliable and have been subject to revisions on the order of 10 kcal/mol (e.g., benzene C–H bonds, from 103 kcal/mol in 1965 to the modern accepted value of 112.9(5) kcal/mol). Even in modern times (between 1990 and 2004), the O−H bond of phenol has been reported to be anywhere from 85.8 to 91.0 kcal/mol. On the other hand, the bond dissociation energy of H2 at 298 K has been measured to high precision and accuracy: &quot;DH&quot;°298(H−H) = 104.1539(1) kcal/mol or 435.780 kJ/mol.

==Definitions and related parameters==
The term &quot;bond-dissociation energy&quot; is similar to the related notion of &quot;bond-dissociation enthalpy&quot; (or &quot;bond enthalpy&quot;), which is sometimes used interchangeably. However, some authors make the distinction that the bond-dissociation energy (&quot;D&quot;0) refers to the enthalpy change at 0 K, while the term bond-dissociation enthalpy is used for the enthalpy change at 298 K (unambiguously denoted &quot;DH&quot;°298). The former parameter tends to be favored in theoretical and computational work, while the latter is more convenient for thermochemical studies. For typical chemical systems, the numerical difference between the quantities is small, and the distinction can often be ignored. For a hydrocarbon RH, where R is significantly larger than H, for instance, the relationship &quot;D&quot;0(R−H) ≈ &quot;DH&quot;°298(R−H) − 1.5 kcal/mol is a good approximation. Some textbooks ignore the temperature dependence, while others have defined the bond-dissociation energy to be the reaction enthalpy of homolysis at 298 K.

The bond dissociation energy is related to but slightly different from the depth of the associated potential energy well of the bond, &quot;D&quot;e, known as the &quot;electronic energy&quot;. This is due to the existence of a zero-point energy ε0 for the vibrational ground state, which reduces the amount of energy needed to reach the dissociation limit. Thus, &quot;D&quot;0 is slightly less than &quot;D&quot;e, and the relationship &quot;D&quot;0 = &quot;D&quot;e − ε0 holds.

The bond dissociation energy is an enthalpy change of a particular chemical process, namely homolytic bond cleavage, and &quot;bond strength&quot; as measured by the BDE should not be regarded as an intrinsic property of a particular bond type but rather as an energy change that depends on the chemical context. For instance, Blanksby and Ellison cites the example of ketene (H2C=CO), which has a C=C bond dissociation energy of 79 kcal/mol, while ethylene (H2C=CH2) has a bond dissociation energy of 174 kcal/mol. This vast difference is accounted for by the thermodynamic stability of carbon monoxide (CO), formed upon the C=C bond cleavage of ketene. The difference in availability of spin states upon fragmentation further complicates the use of BDE as a measure of bond strength for head-to-head comparisons, and force constants have been suggested as an alternative.

Historically, the vast majority of tabulated bond energy values are bond enthalpies. More recently, however, the &quot;free energy&quot; analogue of bond-dissociation &quot;enthalpy&quot;, known as the &quot;bond-dissociation free energy&quot; (BDFE), has become more prevalent in the chemical literature. The BDFE of a bond A–B can be defined in the same way as the BDE as the standard free energy change (Δ&quot;G&quot;°) accompanying homolytic dissociation of AB into A and B. However, it is often thought of and computed stepwise as the sum of the free-energy changes of heterolytic bond dissociation (A–B → A+ + :B−), followed by one-electron reduction of A (A+ + &quot;e&quot;− → A•) and one-electron oxidation of B (:B− → •B + &quot;e&quot;−). In contrast to the BDE, which is usually defined and measured in the gas phase, the BDFE is often determined in the solution phase with respect to a solvent like DMSO, since the free-energy changes for the aforementioned thermochemical steps can be determined from parameters like acid dissociation constants (p&quot;K&quot;a) and standard redox potentials (ε°) that are measured in solution.

===Bond energy===
Except for diatomic molecules, the bond-dissociation energy differs from the &quot;bond energy&quot;. While the bond-dissociation energy is the energy of a single chemical bond, the bond energy is the average of all the bond-dissociation energies of the bonds of the same type for a given molecule. For a homoleptic compound EX&quot;n&quot;, the E–X bond energy is (1/&quot;n&quot;) multiplied by the enthalpy change of the reaction EX&quot;n&quot; → E + &quot;n&quot;X. Average bond energies given in tables are the average values of the bond energies of a collection of species containing &quot;typical&quot; examples of the bond in question.

For example, dissociation of HO−H bond of a water molecule (H2O) requires 118.8 kcal/mol (497.1 kJ/mol). The dissociation of the remaining hydroxyl radical requires 101.8 kcal/mol (425.9 kJ/mol). The bond energy of the covalent O−H bonds in water is said to be 110.3 kcal/mol (461.5 kJ/mol), the average of these values.

In the same way, for removing successive hydrogen atoms from methane the bond-dissociation energies are 105 kcal/mol (439 kJ/mol) for &quot;D&quot;(CH3−H), 110 kcal/mol (460 kJ/mol) for &quot;D&quot;(CH2−H), 101 kcal/mol (423 kJ/mol) for &quot;D&quot;(CH−H) and finally 81 kcal/mol (339 kJ/mol) for &quot;D&quot;(C−H). The bond energy is, thus, 99 kcal/mol, or 414 kJ/mol (the average of the bond-dissociation energies). None of the individual bond-dissociation energies equals the bond energy of 99 kcal/mol.

===Strongest bonds and weakest bonds===
According to experimental BDE data, the strongest measured single bonds are Si−F bonds. The BDE for H3Si−F is 152 kcal/mol, almost 50% stronger than the H3C−F bond (110 kcal/mol). The BDE for F3Si−F is even larger, at 166 kcal/mol. One consequence to these data are that many reactions generate silicon fluorides, such as glass etching, deprotection in organic synthesis, and volcanic emissions. The strength of the bond is attributed to the substantial electronegativity difference between silicon and fluorine, which leads to a substantial contribution from both ionic and covalent bonding to the overall strength of the bond. For the same reason, B–F bonds are also very strong, possibly stronger than Si−F, with the BDE for F2B−F computed to be 172 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory. The C−C single bond of diacetylene (HC≡C−C≡CH) linking two sp-hybridized carbon atoms is also among the strongest, at 160 kcal/mol. The strongest bond for a neutral compound, including multiple bonds, is found in carbon monoxide at 257 kcal/mol. The protonated forms of CO, HCN and N2 are said to have even stronger bonds, although another study argues that the use of BDE as a measure of bond strength in these cases is misleading.

On the other end of the scale, there is no clear boundary between a very weak covalent bond and an intermolecular interaction. Lewis acid–base complexes between transition metal fragments and noble gases are among the weakest of bonds with substantial covalent character, with (CO)5W:Ar having a W–Ar bond dissociation energy of less than 3.0 kcal/mol. Held together entirely by the van der Waals force, helium dimer, He2, has the lowest measured bond dissociation energy of only 0.022 kcal/mol.

==Homolytic versus heterolytic dissociation==
Bonds can be broken symmetrically or asymmetrically. The former is called homolysis and is the basis of the usual BDEs. Asymmetric scission of a bond is called heterolysis. For molecular hydrogen, the alternatives are:

In the gas phase, the enthalpy of heterolysis is larger than that of homolysis, due to the need to separate unlike charges. However, this value is lowered substantially in the presence of a solvent.

==Representative bond enthalpies==
The data tabulated below shows how bond strengths vary over the periodic table. 
There is great interest, especially in organic chemistry, concerning relative strengths of bonds within a given group of compounds, and representative bond dissociation energies for common organic compounds are shown below.

<text>The 1979 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 7, 1979 at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was the fifteenth and final race of the 1979 World Championship of F1 Drivers and the 1979 International Cup for F1 Constructors. This event was also referred to as the United States Grand Prix East in order to distinguish it from the United States Grand Prix West held on April 8, 1979 in Long Beach, California.

The 59-lap race took place in wet conditions, and was won by Gilles Villeneuve, driving a Ferrari. René Arnoux finished second in a Renault, with Didier Pironi third in a Tyrrell-Ford. The win, Villeneuve&#x27;s third of the season, enabled him to secure second place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship behind team-mate Jody Scheckter.

This was the final Formula One race for the 1969 and 1970 championship runner-up Jacky Ickx, Alex Ribeiro, Arturo Merzario and former Brabham driver Hans-Joachim Stuck, as well as the final race for the Wolf team. Villeneuve&#x27;s win was also to be the final one for a car with a flat-12 engine and the three points scored by Elio de Angelis would be the last points scored by the Shadow team.

==Summary==
By the time the teams got to Watkins Glen for the last race of the 1979 season, Jody Scheckter had already clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship, while his Ferrari team had secured the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

On Friday, the rain was heavy enough all day that only a few cars made any serious attempt at a lap time. Of the six that did actually record a time, Gilles Villeneuve was fastest by over nine seconds.

Saturday started bright and sunny, and Alan Jones topped the charts in his Williams for the entire session. He ended up 1.3 seconds quicker than the Brabham of Brazilian Nelson Piquet, who gained the front row in his first drive at Watkins Glen. Scheckter had trouble with the engine in his race car and traffic with his spare, and ended up 16th, one spot ahead of the previous season&#x27;s champion, Mario Andretti.

The forecast for Sunday was a 50% chance of rain. About twenty minutes before the start, the rain came, and all but two of the cars started with rain tires. The two that did not were Piquet and Andretti, who, in 17th spot on the grid, had nothing to lose by the gamble.

At the start, Piquet suffered with wheelspin on his slicks and was left behind. Scheckter took an outside line through turn one, but he got pushed onto the grass and had to wait for the entire field to go by before re-entering. Keke Rosberg spun and recovered, but he forced Bruno Giacomelli off behind him and into retirement with a bent steering arm. After one lap, the order was Villeneuve, Jones, Carlos Reutemann, Jacques Laffite, Jean-Pierre Jabouille, Clay Regazzoni, René Arnoux, Didier Pironi, John Watson and Jean-Pierre Jarier. After two laps, Villeneuve had extended his lead to five seconds.

By lap three, Jacky Ickx, in his last Grand Prix, had moved his Ligier from 24th to twelfth. As he closed on Derek Daly&#x27;s Tyrrell approaching the turn before the pit entrance, however, he bumped Daly from behind and went off. His teammate, Jacques Laffite, running in fifth place, spun off on the next lap at the same place. Reutemann crashed out on lap seven from third place when his fire extinguisher sensing unit came loose and interfered with his pedals. The other Lotus, driven by Andretti, decided his gamble to start on slicks had not worked and pitted for wets, since it was still raining. He returned in 20th, but retired soon after when his gearbox became permanently lodged in fourth.

The gap between Villeneuve and Jones varied, with Regazzoni quite a bit back in third. When the rain became heavier, the Ferrari&#x27;s Michelins performed better; when it slacked off, the intermediate surface favored the Goodyears on the Williams. On lap 20, Scheckter, now in third after fighting his way back from last place, pitted for slicks, as did Regazzoni. Scheckter later said that it was still too early, as he began sliding around down the straight, but the lap time comparison with Villeneuve helped the Ferrari crew to decide when to bring Villeneuve in.

On lap 21, Rosberg caught up with Pironi and tried to overtake on the inside. He could not hold his line, and when he slid wide, he took the Tyrrell with him. Pironi was able to continue, but Rosberg retired with a damaged gearbox. Beginning on lap 25, most of the cars came in for slicks, except the three leaders, Villeneuve, Jones and Arnoux. As the circuit continued to dry, Jones cut into Villeneuve&#x27;s lead, taking off two seconds per lap. By lap 31, Jones was on his tail, and then quickly past. In two laps, he was 3.1 seconds clear. Villeneuve came in to change tires on lap 34, and returned 39.5 seconds behind Jones.

The Williams crew prepared to fit Jones&#x27; car with slicks as he came in on lap 37. After some difficulty removing the right rear, the racing manager waved the jacks away and the car out. As the mechanic on the right rear shouted and waved that he was not finished, the car sped from the pits. At the beginning of the back straight, the wheel came off and Jones retired.

Villeneuve now led Scheckter by almost a lap. Arnoux lost two positions, to fifth, when he pitted for tires, but regained third place, ahead of Daly and Pironi, in two laps. On lap 48, Scheckter felt his car floating about and thought he had a puncture. He decided to go one more lap, but never made it back. The tire shredded and he retired, leaving only nine cars still running. Daly spun off from fourth, and Piquet, after setting fastest lap of the race in pursuit of John Watson&#x27;s McLaren, dropped out with a broken driveshaft five laps from the flag.

Villeneuve coasted home, allowing Elio de Angelis and Hans-Joachim Stuck to unlap themselves, but finishing with a 48-second margin over Arnoux. Later, Villeneuve revealed that he had been nursing the car with failing oil pressure for the final 25 laps. The American Shadow team celebrated de Angelis&#x27; fourth place, his only points of the year. The win by Villeneuve was his third, matching champion Scheckter&#x27;s total, securing a one-two finish in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

<text>The 1980 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 5, 1980 at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. This event was also referred to as the United States Grand Prix East in order to distinguish it from the United States Grand Prix West held on March 30, 1980 in Long Beach, California.

It was the fourteenth and final race of the 1980 Formula One season. The race was the 30th United States Grand Prix, the 20th and last to be held at Watkins Glen, and the last to be held for nine years (other Formula One races were held in the United States during that time, but none were billed as the United States Grand Prix). The race was held over 59 laps of the circuit for a total race distance of .

The race was won by the new World Champion, Australian driver Alan Jones, driving a Williams FW07B. It was Jones&#x27; fifth World Championship Formula One victory of the season and the sixth of the seven Grands Prix (including Spain and Australia) he would win in his career defining season. Jones won by four seconds over his Argentine team mate Carlos Reutemann with French driver Didier Pironi finishing third in his Ligier JS11/15. Two former World Champions, Emerson Fittipaldi and Jody Scheckter, retired after the race, although Fittipaldi would later return to racing in the American CART series.

==Summary==
Frank Williams&#x27; first Championship season, his eleventh as an owner, ended in style with another victory by team leader and new Driver&#x27;s Champion Alan Jones, but this was the last Grand Prix to be held on the historic Watkins Glen course in the wooded hills at the foot of Seneca Lake. The Glen&#x27;s demise came about when attempts to resurface the track proved not to be enough, runoff areas became too short for the speeds produced, and attendance was not what it had been, for even this race had been in doubt until just a month before.

As the track&#x27;s last Grand Prix weekend got under way, the big surprise of qualifying was the Alfa Romeo of Italian Bruno Giacomelli, who was quickest in both Friday&#x27;s and Saturday&#x27;s sessions, averaging . Giacomelli took the only pole of his 69-race career, and the first for Alfa Romeo since Juan Manuel Fangio at the 1951 Italian Grand Prix, by three-quarters of a second over a tightly-bunched group including Nelson Piquet&#x27;s Brabham, Carlos Reutemann&#x27;s Williams, Elio de Angelis&#x27; Lotus and Jones in the second Williams.

Race day threatened rain, but none appeared. Alain Prost, completing his first F1 season had a heavy crash at Turn 10 during Friday practice. He hit his head on his McLaren&#x27;s steering wheel and suffered a concussion, forcing him to miss the race. This enabled Dutchman Jan Lammers to start the race, and Prost, already having suffered 8 previous mechanical failures during the season chose to leave McLaren for the factory Renault team. At the start, Giacomelli got off the line well and led into the first turn. Jones rocketed forward from fifth on the grid to second entering Turn One, but he could not hold his line through the turn. He, along with Giacomelli&#x27;s teammate Andrea de Cesaris swung wide onto the dirt, then collected himself and continued, finishing the first lap in fourteenth place.

At the end of a lap, Giacomelli had opened a gap back to Piquet, followed by Reutemann, Didier Pironi, de Angelis and Héctor Rebaque. In two more laps, the Alfa was ahead by two and a half seconds. Meanwhile, Jones was battling his way back through the field, and on lap 7, he was already poking around the gearbox of John Watson&#x27;s McLaren, trying to take seventh place. Watson held him off until the tenth lap, and, once by, Jones quickly pulled away after de Angelis and Pironi.

Giacomelli continued to set an even pace, and his lead was ten seconds on lap 21, with Reutemann now threatening Piquet, whose tires were beginning to go off. Jones had caught up to de Angelis, and on the next lap, got around him for fifth.

Reutemann&#x27;s pressure, and the Brabham&#x27;s increasing lack of grip, finally got to Piquet on lap 26 as he spun off in turn one. The off-road excursion damaged a skirt, and he retired after reaching the pits. Three laps later, Jones passed Pironi for third, as the Ligier was also suffering from tire wear.

The only car between Jones and the leader now was teammate Reutemann, but with the Driver&#x27;s Championship already in Jones&#x27; hands, there would be no team orders. Understeer induced by a worn left front tire was plaguing the Argentine, however, and Jones easily overcame him on lap 30 and set his sights on Giacomelli, now 12 seconds ahead. The red and white Alfa Romeo coasted to a halt in the Boot on lap 32 with electrical trouble. Once in the lead, Jones went faster and faster, finally doing a 1:34.068 on lap 44, better than his qualifying time.

When Watson pitted to replace a broken shock absorber on his McLaren, crowd favorite Mario Andretti moved up to the final points position. A set of new tires allowed René Arnoux to catch and pass the American, but a broken skirt soon slowed the Renault, and Andretti was able to regain the sixth spot and score his only point of the season.

The Williams team celebrated the climax to a year in which they had taken the Driver&#x27;s and Constructor&#x27;s Championships by waving a huge Union Flag at their one-two finish. The race saw not only the end of Formula One at Watkins Glen, but former champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Jody Scheckter&#x27;s last Grand Prix and Mario Andretti&#x27;s last race for Colin Chapman and Lotus. This Grand Prix would also witness the final occasion where a privateer entry would be classified as a finisher with Rupert Keegan finishing in 9th place in a RAM Racing-entered Williams FW07.

==Classification==

=== Qualifying ===
*= &quot;Mansell was originally entered in this race, but Andretti used the car originally allocated to Mansell after Andretti wrote off his car during the Canadian Grand Prix one week earlier. Jabouille was also entered in this race, but had to miss out due to leg injuries sustained at the same Canadian race.&quot;

<doc id="1262466" wikidata="Q2940497" url="?curid=1262466" title="Electronic identification">
<text>An electronic identification (&quot;eID&quot;) is a digital solution for proof of identity of citizens or organizations. They can be used to view to access benefits or services provided by government authorities, banks or other companies, for mobile payments, etc. Apart from online authentication and login, many electronic identity services also give users the option to sign electronic documents with a digital signature.

One form of eID is an electronic identification card (eIC), which is a physical identity card that can be used for online and offline personal identification or authentication. The eIC is a smart card in ID-1 format of a regular bank card, with identity information printed on the surface (such as personal details and a photograph) and in an embedded RFID microchip, similar to that in biometric passports. The chip stores the information printed on the card (such as the holder&#x27;s name and date of birth) and the holder&#x27;s photo(s). Several photos may be taken from different angles along with different facial expressions, thus allowing the biometric facial recognition systems to measure and analyze the overall structure, shape and proportions of the face. It may also store the holder&#x27;s fingerprints. The card may be used for online authentication, such as for age verification or for e-government applications. An electronic signature, provided by a private company, may also be stored on the chip.

Countries which currently issue government-issued eIDs include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Estonia, Finland, Guatemala, Germany, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Portugal, Poland, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Slovakia, Malta, and Mauritius. Germany, Uruguay and previously Finland have accepted government issued physical eICs. Norway, Sweden and Finland accept bank-issued eIDs (also known as BankID) for identification by government authorities. There are also an increasing number of countries applying electronic identification for voting (enrollment, issuing voter ID cards, voter identification and authentication, etc.), including those countries using biometric voter registration.

==eID in Europe==
===European Union===
According to the EU electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) Regulation, described as a pan-European login system, all organizations delivering public digital services in an EU member state shall accept electronic identification from all EU member states from 29 September 2018.

=== Austria ===
Austria has initially issued eIDs (&quot;Bürgerkarte&quot;) via its national health insurance card (eCard), but has later introduced an app-based solution (&quot;Handy-Signatur&quot;). Electronic signatures were deemed equivalent to handwritten signatures since January 2000. As of 5 December 2023, the Handy-Signatur and the Bürgerkarte (Citizen Card) have been upgraded and replaced by &quot;ID Austria&quot;, which offers enhanced digital identification and authentication capabilities. More than 2 Million people are enrolled in ID Austria. It interconnects with eIDAS systems from other EU Member States. It is widely used for government online services, but also increasingly by the private sector.

===Belgium===

Belgium has been issuing eIDs since 2003, and all identity cards issued since 2004 have been electronic, replacing the previous plastic card.

====Chip contents====
The eID card contains a chip containing:

* the same information as legible on the card
* the address of the card holder
* the identity - and signature keys and certificates
* fingerprints
* place of birth

====Using the eID====
At home, the users can use their electronic IDs to log into specific websites (such as Tax-on-web, allowing them to fill in their tax form online). To do this the user needs

* an eID card
* a smartcard reader
* the eID middleware software

When other software (such as an Internet Browser) attempts to read the eID, the users are asked for confirmation for this action, and potentially even for their PIN.

Other applications include signing emails with the user&#x27;s eID certificate private key. Giving the public key to your recipients allows them to verify your identity.

====Kids ID====
Although legally Belgian citizens only have to carry an ID from the age of 12, as of March 2009, a &quot;Kids ID&quot; has been introduced for children below this age, on a strictly voluntary basis. This ID, beside containing the usual information, also holds a contact number that people, or the child themselves, can call when they, for example, are in danger or had an accident. The card can be used for electronic identification after the age of six, and it does not contain a signing certificate as minors cannot sign a legally binding document. An important goal of the Kids-ID card is to allow children to join &quot;youth-only&quot; chat sites, using their eID to gain entrance. These sites would essentially block any users above a certain age from gaining access to the chat sessions, effectively blocking out potential pedophiles.

===Bulgaria===
Bulgaria introduced a limited scale proof-of-concept of electronic identity cards, called ЕИК (Eлектронна карта за идентичност), in 2013.

===Croatia===
Croatia introduced its electronic identity cards, called &quot;e-osobna iskaznica&quot;, on 8 June 2015.

===Denmark===
Electronic identities in Denmark, issued by banks and the government jointly, is named MitID. The former eID, NemID, was depreciated as of October 2023. MitID authentication allows larger payments in MobilePay - a service used by more than half of the population as of 2017.

===Estonia===
The Estonian ID card, issued since 2002, is also used for authentication for Estonia&#x27;s Internet-based voting system. In February 2007, Estonia was the first country to allow for electronic voting for parliamentary elections. Over 30,000 voters participated in the country&#x27;s e-election.

At end of 2014 Estonia extended the Estonian ID Card to non-residents. The target of the project is to reach 10 million residents by 2025, which is 8 times more than the Estonian population of 1.3 million.

===Finland===
The Finnish electronic ID was first issued to citizens on 1 December 1999. Electronic identities in Finland are issued by banks. They make it possible to log into Finnish authorities, universities and banks, and to make larger payments using the MobilePay mobile payment service. The &quot;mobiilivarmenne&quot; is utilizing the mobile phone SIM card for authentication, and is financed by a fee to the mobile network operator for each authentication.

===Germany===
Germany introduced its electronic identity cards, called Personalausweis, in 2010.

=== Iceland ===
In Iceland, electronic IDs (Icelandic: &quot;Rafræn skilríki&quot;) are extensively used by the public and private sector today and were first introduced in 2008. The most widely used version today is on a mobile phone - with the authentication key held on a SIM card. In Iceland 95% of the eligible population (13 years or older) has an active eID, including 75% of over 75s. Icelandic eID holders used their eID more than 20 times a month in 2021.

During enrollment, users create a PIN. Each time they need to identify, verify or sign something online, a prompt via flash SMS is initiated and the PIN code is validated. Today this system is used by all banks, government services (island.is portal), healthcare, eductation, document signing and over 300 private companies using for customer page logins (linked to the Icelandic ID no.). Since the only thing to remember is one&#x27;s PIN code and their phone, it is very prevalent, and works as a sort of single-sign-on service. They are administered by Auðkenni hf., which was initially created by a consortium of banks but is now owned by the government.

The first form of the system in 2008 was a special smartcard with an EMV chip, paired with a smartcard reader on the client&#x27;s computer. The smartcard was first introduced in late 2008 for employees of government departments, large companies and the healthcare system. It was rolled out to all departments and companies handling sensitive data. It was also possible to store one&#x27;s eID on a debit card. In November 2013 the SIM card implementation for mobile phones was introduced, which led to a much quicker take-up of eIDs due to its ease of use. By 2014, 40% of Icelanders were using eIDs.

===Italy===

Italy introduced its electronic identity cards, called &quot;Carta d&#x27;Identità Elettronica&quot; (in Italy identified with the acronym &quot;CIE&quot;), to replace the paper-based ID card in Italy. Since 4 July 2016, Italy is in the process of renewing all ID cards to electronic ID cards.

=== Latvia ===
eID and eSignature service provider in Latvia is called eParaksts

===Malta===
Since 12 February 2014, Malta is in the process of renewing all ID cards to electronic ID cards.

===Netherlands===

Electronic identities in Netherlands are called DigiD and Netherlands is currently developing an eID scheme.

===Norway===
Electronic identities in Norway issued by banks are called BankID (different than Sweden&#x27;s BankID). They make it possible to log into Norwegian authorities, universities and banks, and to make larger payments using the Vipps mobile payment service, used by more than half of the population as of 2017. The Norwegian &quot;BankID på mobil&quot; service is utilizing the mobile phone SIM card for authentication, and is financed by a fee to the mobile network operator for each authentication.

=== Romania ===
Since 25 May 2023, Romanians are able to use their national ID to sign up to the RoEID application which allows them to access public services

===Spain===
Electronic identity cards in Spain are called DNIe and have been issued since 2006.

===Switzerland===
SwissID,
developed by SwissSign,
is a certified digital ID in Switzerland offered since 2017 (2010–17 as SuisseID). As a base for a new &quot;Federal Act on Electronic Identification Services (e-ID Act)&quot;,
an eID-concept had been developed by the authorities, yet experts criticized its technology part.
The law was accepted by the Swiss parliament on 29 September 2019. It would have updated current legislation and would have continued to allow private companies or public organizations to issue eIDs if certified by a new federal authority. However, an optional referendum called for a public vote on this issue in the weeks until Sunday, 7 March 2021. The vote resulted in 35.6% Yes and 64.4% No, rejecting the proposed new law.

SwissSign might develop the SwissID further, to make it compatible with future E-ID regulations.

===Sweden===
The most widespread electronic identification in Sweden is issued by banks and called BankID. The BankID may be in the form of a certificate file on disk, on card or on smart phones. The latter (Swedish &quot;mobile BankID&quot; service) was used by 84 percent of the Swedish population in 2019. A Mobile BankID login does not require a fee since the service is provided by banks rather than mobile operators. It can be used both for authentication within various apps and web services on the same smart phone, and also for web pages on other devices. It also supports fingerprint and face recognition authentication on compatible iOS and Android devices.

Electronic IDs are used for secure web login to Swedish authorities, banks, health centers (allowing people to see their medical records and prescriptions and book doctors visits), and companies such as pharmacies. Mobile BankID also allows the Swish mobile payment service, utilized by 78 percent of the Swedish population in 2019, at first mainly for payments between individuals. BankID was previously used for university applications and admissions, but this was prohibited by Swedbank since universities utilized the system for distribution of their own student logins. Increasingly, BankID is used as an added security for signing contracts.

=== Usage of eID systems in Europe ===
The adoption of eIDs varies per EU Member State. While some countries mainly rely on government eID systems, others have dominant private or public-private systems, like eIDs managed by banks. The table below provides an overview over eID adoption in various countries.
==eID in other countries==
===Afghanistan===

Afghanistan issued its first electronic ID (e-ID) card on 3 May 2018. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was the first to receive the card. Afghan President was accompanied by First Lady Rula Ghani, his VP, Head of Afghan Senate, Head of Afghan Parliament, Chief Justice and other senior government officials, and they also received their cards. As of January 2021, approximately 1.7 million Afghan citizens have obtained their e-ID cards.

===Costa Rica===
Costa Rica plans to introduce facial recognition data into its national identification card.

===Guatemala===
Guatemala introduced its electronic identity card called DPI (Documento Personal de Identificación) in August 2010.

===India===
===Indonesia===
Indonesia introduced its electronic identity cards, called e-KTP. Indonesian electronic ID was trialed in six areas in 2009 and launched nationwide in 2011.

===Israel===
Electronic identity cards in Israel have been issued since July 2013.

===Kazakhstan===
Kazakhstan introduced its electronic identity cards in 2009.

===Mauritius===
Mauritius has had electronic identity cards since 2013.

===Mexico===
Mexico had an intent to develop an official electronic biometric ID card for all youngsters under the age of 18 years and was called the Personal Identity Card (Record of Minors), which included the data verified on the birth certificate, including the names of the legal ascendant(s), a unique key of the Population Registry (CURP), a biometric facial recognition photograph, a scan of all 10 fingerprints, and an iris scan registration.

===Nigeria===
General Multi-purpose Electronic Identity Cards are issued by the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), a Federal Government agency under the Presidency. The NeID Card complies with ICAO standard 9303, ISO standard 7816–4., as well as GVCP for the MasterCard-supported payment applet.
NIMC plans to issue 50m multilayer-polycarbonate cards, the first set being contact only, but also dual-interface with DESFire Emulation in the near future.

===Pakistan===

Pakistan officially began its nationwide Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) distribution in 2002, with over 89.5 x CNICs issued by 2012. In October 2012, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) introduced the smart national identity card (SNIC), which contains a data chip and 36 security features. The SNIC complies with ICAO standard 9303 and ISO standard 7816–4. The SNIC can be used for both offline and online identification, voting, pension disbursement, social and financial inclusion programmes and other services. NADRA aims to replace all 89.5 million CNICs with SNICs by 2020.

===Serbia===
Serbia has its first trustful and reliable electronic identity since June 2019. The first reliable service provider is The Office for IT and eGovernment, through which citizens and residents of Serbia can access services on eGovernment Portal and eHealth portal. The electronic identification offers two levels of security, first basic level with authentication of only user name and password, and medium level of two-factor of authentication.

===Sri Lanka===
Since on 1 January 2016, Sri Lanka is in the process of developing a Smart Card based RFID E-National Identity Card which will replace the obsolete &#x27;Laminated Type&#x27; cards by storing the holders information on a chip that can be read by banks, offices etc. thereby reducing the need to have documentation of these informations physically by storing in the cloud.

===Turkey===
In Turkey the e-Government (e-Devlet) Gateway is a largely scaled Internet site that provides access to all public services from a single point. The purpose of the Gateway is to present public services to the citizens, enterprises and public institutions effectively and efficiently with information and communication technologies.

===Uruguay===
Uruguay has had electronic identity cards since 2015. The Uruguayan eID has a private key that allows to digitally sign documents, and has the user fingerprint stored in order to allow to verify the identity. It is also a valid travel document in some South American countries.
As of 2017 the old laminated ID coexists with the new eID.

==Manufacturing==
Electronic identification can also be attributed to the manufacturing sector, where the technology of electronic identification is transferred to individual parts or components within a manufacturing facility in order to track, and identify these parts to enhance manufacturing efficiency. This can also be referred to location detection technologies within the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

<doc id="1262468" wikidata="Q14608155" url="?curid=1262468" title="Mettwurst">
<text>Mettwurst () is a strongly flavored German sausage made from raw minced pork preserved by curing and smoking, often with garlic. The southern German variety is soft and similar to Teewurst. Braunschweiger mettwurst is partially smoked but still soft and spreadable, while other northern German varieties such as Holsteiner are harder and more akin to salami, due to longer duration of smoking.

==Etymology==
The Low German word &quot;mett&quot;, meaning &#x27;minced pork without bacon&#x27;, is derived from the Old Saxon word &quot;meti&quot; (meaning &#x27;food&#x27;), and is related to the English word &#x27;meat&#x27;. 

==Preparation and usage==
Mettwurst can be prepared and eaten in a variety of ways, such as cooked or fried or spread on rye bread with onions and eaten raw. When minced raw pork is prepared without curing or smoking, it is called simply Mett. The skin is designed to be eaten and is typically not removed.

It is important that high-quality, fresh ingredients are used; otherwise, deadly microorganisms and toxins can develop. In January 1995, 23 children became very ill, one of whom died, which the coroner found was a result of eating garlic mettwurst.

==Outside of Germany==
In South Australia, due to large German immigration in the 19th century (to, for example, the town of Hahndorf), mettwurst (sometimes spelled &quot;metwurst&quot;) is common: it is created in the northern German style and served as a cold cut. It is often consumed in school lunches and as a snack during parties.

In the United States, mettwurst is most commonly associated with the city of Cincinnati, where it is regarded as a signature dish. The town of Mineola, Iowa, which was settled almost exclusively by immigrants from Schleswig-Holstein, hosts an annual heritage dinner with &quot;Schoening-style&quot; cold-smoked Mettwurst known in the Low German dialect as &quot;Metvuss&quot;.

In Santa Catarina, Brazil, mettwurst is known as Linguiça Blumenau. It is associated with the Vale do Itajaí region due to past German immigration.

==Similar products==
Finnish &quot;meetvursti&quot; resembles the Dutch metworst or salami; it is dry, hard, strong-flavored and dense, and is eaten as a cold cut on bread.

<text>King Street is one of the most important thoroughfares of Manchester city centre, England. For much of the 20th century it was the centre of the north-west banking industry but it has become progressively dominated by upmarket retail instead of large banks.

==History==
King Street began in the 18th century at the Spring Gardens end when the Jacobite party in the town created James&#x27;s Square and to the west of it a fine street. Beyond what is now Cross Street it was much narrower and one 18th-century building remains (a former District Bank). Further west beyond Deansgate is King Street West on a different alignment. By the 1970s, there was a clear demarcation between the eastern section of mainly financial and office buildings and the narrower section to the west a mostly upmarket shopping street (later pedestrianised). Subsequently, the eastern section had the monumental National Westminster Bank offices built at no. 55 and some years later further changes increasingly brought more upmarket retail. In 2008, the grand Midland Bank building of Edwin Lutyens was vacated by HSBC Bank.

=== Old Town Hall ===
Manchester&#x27;s original civic administration (a commission of police) was housed in the Police Office on King Street from 1772; it was near the junction with Deansgate and Police Street is so called because of it. It was replaced by the first Town Hall, to accommodate the growing local government and its civic assembly rooms. The Town Hall, also located on King Street at the corner of Cross Street, was designed by Francis Goodwin and constructed during 1822–25, much of it by David Bellhouse. The building was designed in the Grecian style and Goodwin was strongly influenced by his patron John Soane. As the size and wealth of the city grew, largely as a result of the textile industry, its administration outstripped the existing facilities and a new building was proposed. The King Street building was subsequently occupied by a public library and then Lloyds Bank. The façade was removed to Heaton Park in 1912, when the current building was erected on the site (53 King Street).

==Notable buildings==
Many notable buildings survive and are preserved in a conservation area. On King Street there are 18 buildings listed at Grade II, one at Grade II* and one at Grade I; on King Street West is one at Grade II and on South King Street nearby one more at Grade II.

==Shopping area==
King Street (along with Bridge Street) is considered Manchester&#x27;s most upmarket shopping area; it has included the Manchester branches of Hermès, Whistles, Gant, Karen Millen, King Street Grooming, Emporio Armani, DKNY, Diesel, Timberland, Calvin Klein Jeans, Polo Ralph Lauren, Max Mara, T. M. Lewin, Jaeger, Cecil Gee, Agent Provocateur, Mulberry, Thomas Pink, Crombie. (However some of these are on Bridge Street to the south of King Street West.)

The part west of Cross Street was already a shopping street in the early 20th century.

<text>Matthew Stephen &quot;M.&quot; Ward (born October 4, 1973) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist from Glendale, California. Ward&#x27;s solo work is a mixture of folk and blues-inspired Americana analog recordings. He has released 10 studio albums since 1999, primarily through the independent label Merge Records. In addition to his solo work, he is a member of indie pop duo She &amp; Him and folk-rock supergroup Monsters of Folk, and also participates in recording, producing, and playing with multiple other artists.

== Early life ==
Ward was raised in Glendale, California, and moved to Portland, Oregon, after attending college at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. Growing up, Ward taught himself songs by the Beatles on his brother&#x27;s guitar, and began recording demos on a four-track analog tape recorder when he was about fifteen. Ward continues to record only analog, and starts all of his songs as demos on the same recorder he has had since his teens.

==Solo recordings==

=== &quot;Duets for Guitars #2&quot; and &quot;End of Amnesia&quot; (1999–2001) ===
Ward&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Duet for Guitars #2&quot;, was released by Co-Dependent Records in 1999, then reissued by Howe Gelb&#x27;s Ow Om record label in 2000. Described by Joshua Klein of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as &quot;ragged and lo-fi ... recorded on a shoestring and not necessarily worse for it&quot;, &quot;Duet for Guitars #2&quot; soon went out of print for a second time, before being reissued by Merge in 2007.

Ward&#x27;s second album, &quot;End of Amnesia&quot;, was put out by Future Farmer Records and Loose Music (Europe) in 2001. In a retrospective review, Ryan Kearney of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; compared the album to a contemporary band, Sparklehorse, saying that &quot;both Linkous and Ward are country-and folk-influenced artists who scratch unavoidable, but nominally disruptive marks on the traditional blueprint&quot;. Sparklehorse had released &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; to critical acclaim earlier in the year.

A collection of live recordings, &quot;Live Music &amp; The Voice of Strangers&quot;, was a self-released disc that was sold at his shows in 2001.

=== &quot;Transfiguration of Vincent&quot; and &quot;Transistor Radio&quot; (2003–05) ===
Ward released his third album, &quot;Transfiguration of Vincent&quot;, on Merge Records in 2003 to critical success. &quot;Transfiguration of Vincent&quot; received a weighted average score of 82 out of 100 by review aggregator website Metacritic, based on 13 critical reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. The title alludes to the 1965 album &quot;The Transfiguration of Blind Joe Death&quot; by John Fahey, and refers to the life and death of Vincent O&#x27;Brien, a close friend to Ward. Fahey&#x27;s pre-war style of folk music and production techniques, using basic equipment and simple arrangements, greatly influenced Ward&#x27;s own sound and recording practices.

&quot;Transistor Radio&quot;, Ward&#x27;s fourth album, was released on Merge in 2005, and he served as the opening act for The White Stripes that fall. The album consists of Ward&#x27;s own compositions as well as three covers, The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;You Still Believe in Me&quot;, Carmen Lombardo&#x27;s pop standard &quot;Sweethearts on Parade&quot;, and Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;. &quot;Transistor Radio&quot; received a score of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Josh Terry of Consequence of Sound, writing of &quot;Transistor Radio&quot; in 2014, described the album as &quot;one of the finer examples of ramshackle and intimate mid-aughts folk.&quot; A writer for &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, however, said that &quot;Most of Ward&#x27;s quiet, contemporary folk songs are mere sketches, mediocre if not unmemorable.&quot; &quot;Transistor Radio&quot; was reissued by Merge in December 2014 with four previously unreleased tracks.

=== &quot;Post-War&quot; and &quot;Hold Time&quot; (2006–09) ===
In August 2006, Ward released &quot;Post-War&quot; on Merge Records. &quot;Post-War&quot; was Ward&#x27;s first album with a full backing band, with players including Howe Gelb, Jim James, and Neko Case. &quot;Post-War&quot; was described by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in its August 2006 issue as thematic on the question &quot;How will America heal once this craziness in Iraq is over?&quot; Ward said in that article that he looked to the post-war music of the late 1940s and 1950s. &quot;I had the naive, simplistic idea that producers and writers and artists of the time helped in a minuscule way to change the mind-set of America.&quot; In addition to this inspired material, the album also contains a cover of Daniel Johnston&#x27;s &quot;To Go Home&quot;, which was subsequently re-released on the &quot;To Go Home&quot; EP in 2007. A critical success, &quot;Post-War&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; of 81 out of 100, aggregated by Metacritic and reached No. 146 on Billboard&#x27;s Top 200. Ward spent most of 2007 touring with Norah Jones in support of the album, as well as occasionally playing in Norah&#x27;s touring band, &quot;The Handsome Band&quot;. Ward played on Jones&#x27;s 2007 release &quot;Not Too Late&quot;.

&quot;Hold Time&quot;, the followup to &quot;Post-War&quot;, was released on Merge in February 2009. &quot;Hold Time&quot; includes guest performances by Jason Lytle of the band Grandaddy, Lucinda Williams, Tom Hagerman of DeVotchKa, and She &amp; Him co-contributor Zooey Deschanel. The album includes a cover of the Buddy Holly song &quot;Rave On!&quot; Described by Autumn De Wilde &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as &quot;[feeling] timeless, a musical wanderer&#x27;s dusty, train-hopping tour through folk, blues, and country,&quot; &quot;Hold Time&quot; received an aggregated 79 out of 100 on Metacritic, for &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; and reached No. 31 on Billboard&#x27;s Top 200.

=== &quot;A Wasteland Companion&quot; and &quot;More Rain&quot; (2012–present) ===
After several years of touring and releasing albums with pop project She &amp; Him and folk supergroup Monsters of Folk, Ward released his seventh studio album, &quot;A Wasteland Companion&quot;, in 2012 on Merge and Bella Union. Reaching number 21 in the US charts, &quot;A Wasteland Companion&quot; received an aggregated score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Will Hermes of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 3.5 of 5 stars, reflective of the aggregated score, and commented that &quot;[&quot;A Wasteland Companion&quot;] is his most vivid and varied yet, full of exquisite guitar work...gem-like songcraft...and inspired covers.&quot; Matthew McFarland of &quot;Prefix&quot; offered the criticism, &quot;What&#x27;s missing, though, is the familiar sense of deft control over the album&#x27;s arc, the lyrical intrigues, and the instrumental detail that make his other work so indispensable [sic] to the indie folk canon of last decade.&quot;

After another multi-year break from solo recording, M. Ward released his eighth album, &quot;More Rain&quot;, on March 4, 2016, via Merge and Bella Union. Ward began working on &quot;More Rain&quot; in 2012, initially experimenting with layering his own vocals to create a doo-wop record. After collaborating with other artists on the record such as R.E.M.&#x27;s Peter Buck, k.d. lang, Neko Case, and others, the sound of the album went in a different direction, described as a &quot;true gotta-stay-indoors, rainy-season record that looks upwards through the weather while reflecting on his past.&quot; 

On June 8, 2018, Ward self-released &quot;What a Wonderful Industry&quot;, his ninth studio album. Using a variety of anecdotes and metaphors, the album examines the complex challenges of working within the cutthroat music industry. As Ward stated in an interview with NPR, &quot;You quickly learn there&#x27;s a perfectly imperfect balance of cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals in the zoo...This record visits the most memorable characters. There&#x27;s a lot of very inspirational people I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to work with but there are also a few I wish I&#x27;d never met.&quot;

Ward&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Migration Stories&quot;, was released on April 3, 2020, on Anti Records. Later that year, Ward released &quot;Think of Spring&quot; which features songs originally recorded by Billie Holiday. In June 2023, Anti Records released Ward&#x27;s twelfth solo album &quot;Supernatural Thing&quot;.

==With other musicians==

=== She and Him ===
In 2006, Ward was working on the soundtrack for the film &quot;The Go-Getter&quot;, co-starring actress Zooey Deschanel, when Director Martin Hynes suggested Ward and Deschanel record a duet for the movie. Ward later referred to the collaboration as &quot;a fruitful, creative experience.&quot; Deschanel soon sent Ward demos of songs she had written, and the two formed the pop duo She &amp; Him to record together, with Deschanel writing the songs. The duo&#x27;s first album &quot;Volume One&quot; — which Ward produced – was released on Merge Records on March 18, 2008. &quot;Volume One&quot; found critical and commercial success for Deschanel and Ward&#x27;s pop music. The album reached No. 31 on Billboard&#x27;s Top 200, and Metacritic has the critical album reviews aggregated to 76 out of 100, or &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

She &amp; Him&#x27;s second album, &quot;Volume Two&quot;, was released on Merge in 2010. &quot;Volume Two&quot; peaked at No. 6 on Billboard&#x27;s Top 200, outperforming their first release. &quot;A Very She &amp; Him Christmas&quot; was released October 25, 2011 on Merge Records, peaking at No. 12. After a break, She &amp; Him released their third album of original songs, &quot;Volume 3&quot; in 2013 followed by a collection of standards, &quot;Classics&quot;, in 2014. Both albums also charted and were released on Merge. In 2016 they released their second christmas album, Christmas Party.

=== Monsters of Folk ===
Monsters of Folk is a project formed by Ward, Jim James of My Morning Jacket, and Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis of Bright Eyes. The four had been touring and playing together at various points throughout the 2000s and regularly talked of making an album together. The result, the eponymous &quot;Monsters of Folk&quot;, was released in September 2009. &quot;Monsters of Folk&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; with an aggregate score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic. &quot;Prefix&quot;″s Dave Clark said of the supergroup that &quot;The players on Monsters of Folk complement each other extremely well. There is definitely something to be said for group chemistry. These songs don&#x27;t always shine the way they could, but the album is a great effort.&quot; &quot;Monsters of Folk&quot; was a commercial success, peaking at No. 15 on Billboard&#x27;s Top 200.

=== Other artists ===
He has performed on recordings by Brian Wilson, Kim Deal, Giant Sand, Cat Power, Neko Case, Beth Orton (with whom he co-wrote the title track to her album &quot;Comfort of Strangers&quot;), The Court &amp; Spark, Bright Eyes (with whom he toured on the 2004 Vote for Change tour with R.E.M. and Bruce Springsteen), Jenny Lewis (whose debut solo album &quot;Rabbit Fur Coat&quot; he co-produced), and My Morning Jacket.

In 2005, Ward was – along with Aaron Burtch, Jason Lytle and Jim Fairchild from Grandaddy, Scout Niblett, Marie Frank or Jeremy Gara – involved in Howe Gelb&#x27;s project called Arizona Amp and Alternator, which had officially no band members but a lot of guest musicians (M. Ward&#x27;s voice can be recognized on the track &quot;Aaaa(3)&quot;).

In 2006, he helped produce and contributed a song to the John Fahey tribute album &quot;I Am the Resurrection&quot;. He also appears on Norah Jones&#x27; album &quot;Not Too Late&quot;, performing backing vocals and guitar on &quot;Sinkin&#x27; Soon&quot;, and toured as the opener and a member of her &quot;Handsome Band&quot; for the album in the spring of 2007. Also his cover of David Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; is featured on the soundtrack of the 2007 New Zealand film &quot;Eagle vs Shark&quot;. Ward was previously a member of the band Rodriguez with Kyle Field of Little Wings and Mike Funk of Echodrone. Their album &quot;Swing Like a Metronome&quot; was released in 2000 and produced by Jason Lytle of Grandaddy.

Songs or compositions written by M. Ward have been recorded or performed by: Bright Eyes (&quot;Seashell Tale&quot;), Feist (&quot;Post War&quot;), Cat Power (&quot;Sad Sad Song&quot;), Carrie Rodriguez (&quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot;), Grandaddy (&quot;Fishing Boat Song&quot;), Lloyd Cole (&quot;Chinese Translation&quot;), Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings (&quot;One Life Away&quot; &quot;Fuel for Fire&quot;), Norah Jones (&quot;Lullaby + Exile&quot;), and She and Him (&quot;Magic Trick&quot;).

In 2013, Ward contributed guitar work to the Neko Case album &quot;The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You&quot;. Neko noted on her September 2, 2013, appearance on &quot;Comedy Bang! Bang!&quot; that Ward not only contributed but was &quot;paid in full&quot;.

<doc id="1262495" wikidata="Q664482" url="?curid=1262495" title="Teewurst">
<text>Teewurst () is a German sausage made from two parts raw pork (and sometimes beef) and one part bacon; they are minced, seasoned and packed in casings (mostly porous artificial casings) before being smoked over beech wood. The sausage then has to mature for seven to ten days in order to develop its typical taste. Teewurst contains 30 to 40 percent fat, which makes it particularly easy to spread.
Teewurst was invented in Pomerania, probably in the small Baltic town of Rügenwalde (now Darłowo, Poland), in the middle of the 19th century. The name, which means &quot;tea sausage&quot;, is said to derive from the habit of serving it in sandwiches at teatime.

Up to 1945, the sausage industry in Rügenwalde was well established, and Teewurst was its best-known product. In 1927, the term &quot;Rügenwalder Teewurst&quot; was declared a protected designation of origin. After World War II, sausage makers from Rügenwalde fled or were expelled to the Federal Republic of Germany, where they established new companies and resumed the production of Teewurst. They established an association of former Rügenwald sausage makers, which registered the trademark &quot;Rügenwalder Teewurst&quot; in 1957. Teewurst was also made in East Germany, but the brand &quot;Rügenwalder Teewurst&quot; was never used there. Today, only companies that once had their headquarters in Rügenwalde are allowed to use the term &quot;Rügenwalder Teewurst&quot;. All others use the terms &quot;Teewurst&quot; or &quot;Rügenwalde-style Teewurst&quot;.

<doc id="1262496" wikidata="Q1772892" url="?curid=1262496" title="Ferguson-Brown Company">
<text>The Ferguson-Brown Company was a British agricultural machinery manufacturing company formed by Harry Ferguson in partnership with David Brown.

Ferguson-Brown produced the Model A Ferguson-Brown tractor incorporating a Ferguson-designed hydraulic three-point linkage hitch. Of the 1,356 produced 400 of the tractors were sold in Norway, which was the only export market. The early tractors were fitted with the Coventry Climax model E engine which was a descendant of the American Hercules engine as fitted to the prototype &quot;Black tractor&quot; later the engine manufacture was taken on by David Brown Ltd. who made a number of improvements such as a deeper sump, some of the earlier tractors suffered from oil starvation on hillside work. It has been narrowed down by surviving examples that the engine change from the Coventry Climax to the David Brown took place around tractors serial numbers 525 to 528. Harry Ferguson surmised that the tractor hitch was the key to having a better plough and designed a simpler tractor attachment for it.

==Agreement with Ford==
In 1938 Ferguson made a handshake agreement with Henry Ford to produce Ferguson System Ford-Ferguson tractors using Ferguson&#x27;s own self-regulating &quot;three-point hitch&quot; system, beginning with the Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. This tractor is recognizable by the blue Ford emblem on the front of the hood and the Ferguson System emblem on the grill. The three-point hitch soon became the favourite hitch attachment system among farmers in North America and around the world. This tractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (PTO) shaft that could be used to power three-point hitch mounted implements such as sickle-bar mowers. This PTO location set the standard for future tractor developments.

==Agreement with Standard==
In December 1945 Standard Motor Company Limited announced that an arrangement had been made to manufacture Ferguson&#x27;s tractors. Standard&#x27;s newly acquired factory at Banner Lane in Coventry would be used for the project. These tractors would be for the Eastern hemisphere, with Ferguson tractors built by Ford in America for the Western hemisphere. Production was expected to start in 1946. Following conversion of the former WW2 aircraft factory. Implements would be sourced and sold separately by Ferguson.

==Split with Ford==
In 1946 the Ford Motor Company parted from Ferguson, following several disagreements and a protracted lawsuit followed, involving Ford&#x27;s continued use of Ferguson&#x27;s patents. Ford altered the hydraulic design of its postwar tractors to avoid Ferguson&#x27;s hydraulic system patent, but continued to produce machines equipped with the basic Ferguson hitch arrangement. The postwar Ford 8N, equipped with Ferguson&#x27;s three-point hitch, became the top-selling tractor of all time in North America.

==Ferguson TE20==

After the split with Ford, Ferguson took the opportunity to have the Standard Motor Company of the UK produce a new design, the Model TE20. The model name came from Tractor, England but is affectionately known as the &quot;Little Grey Fergie&quot;. There were several variants of the TE20; the first tractors were designated TE20 Using an imported Continental Z120 engine. In 1948 the TEA20 was introduced with a Standard brand petrol engine, following the introduction of the TED20 which ran on TVO (tractor vapourising oil, similar to paraffin). Later a diesel model was introduced, the TEF20. There were other variants with narrow tracks for working in vineyards and orchards, such as the TEB20 and TEC20.

Over 500,000 Little Grey Fergies were built between 1946 and 1956, and many survive today. So successful was the TE20 that Ford nicknamed it the &quot;Grey Menace&quot; as sales of the tractor spread across the world. Some were used on an expedition to the South Pole in 1958 by Sir Edmund Hillary, a testament to the durability of the machine. Ford ultimately settled the legal proceedings with a multimillion-dollar sum that allowed Ferguson to further expand his own manufacturing interests.

There is a monument in Wentworth on the junction of the Darling and Murray Rivers in commemorating the time in 1956 when both rivers flooded and a fleet of Little Grey Fergies was used to build defensive banks to save the town.

==Ferguson Park==
Ferguson built a plant in Detroit where the TO20, TO30, and F40 were assembled. He named it Ferguson Park, perhaps because the 8Ns were then being assembled at Highland Park. Massey Ferguson stopped production at this plant in 1984. Part of the plant is currently in use by an auto parts manufacturer.

==Three-point linkage==
The principal feature of the Ferguson System was the three-point linkage. This allowed trailed implements to be supported on a hydraulic system. Two drag links attached under the rear axle with a single compression link connected to the upper rear transmission case automatically regulating the hydraulic suspension&#x27;s height. This allowed lighter implement to be used, with no attached wheels or separate manual controls. By assisting the tractor to maintain traction from a combined drag and rotary force to the axle, which kept the rear driving wheels on the ground, the front steering wheels had improved contact with the ground. Consequently, the &quot;rearing and bucking&quot; of overloaded tractors was reduced, making tractors much safer for the operator.

*Ferguson design implements
==Other innovations==
Ferguson&#x27;s designs, for tractors, were the first with single-wheel brakes that allowed the driver to turn sharply by braking the inside wheel. The TE20 was one of the first tractors to have a four-speed gearbox, with integrated differential, and a hydraulic system.

==Merger with Massey-Harris==
In 1953 Ferguson and Massey-Harris merged, and the combined company Massey-Harris-Ferguson (later shortened to Massey Ferguson) became the manufacturer of the tractors and other designs. By then, many manufacturers had developed their own three-point linkages, and the linkage had become standardised worldwide.

<doc id="1262498" wikidata="Q2137178" url="?curid=1262498" title="Victorian dress reform">
<text>Victorian dress reform was an objective of the Victorian dress reform movement (also known as the rational dress movement) of the middle and late Victorian era, led by various reformers who proposed, designed, and wore clothing considered more practical and comfortable than the fashions of the time.

Dress reformists were largely middle-class women involved in the first wave of feminism in the Western World, from the 1850s through the 1890s. The movement emerged in the Progressive Era along with calls for temperance, women&#x27;s education, suffrage and moral purity. Dress reform called for emancipation from the &quot;dictates of fashion&quot;, expressed a desire to &quot;cover the limbs as well as the torso adequately,&quot; and promoted &quot;rational dress&quot;. The movement had its greatest success in the reform of women&#x27;s undergarments, which could be modified without exposing the wearer to social ridicule. Dress reformers were also influential in persuading women to adopt simplified garments for athletic activities such as bicycling or swimming. The movement was much less concerned with men&#x27;s clothing, although it initiated the widespread adoption of knitted wool union suits or long johns.

Some of the movement&#x27;s proponents established dress reform parlors, or storefronts, where women could buy sewing patterns for the garments, or buy them directly.

Fashion in the 1850s through the 1880s accented large crinolines, cumbersome bustles, and padded busts with tiny waists laced into &#x27;steam-moulded corsetry&#x27;. &#x27;Tight-lacing&#x27; became part of the corset controversy: dress reformists claimed that the corset was prompted by vanity and foolishness, and harmful to health. The reported health risks included damaged and rearranged internal organs, compromised fertility; weakness and general depletion of health. Those who were pro-corset argued that it was required for stylish dress and had its own unique pleasures; dress historian David Kunzle theorized that some enthusiastic fans of tightlacing may have experienced sexual pleasure when tightlacing, or by rubbing against the front of the corset, which contributed to the moral outrage against the practice. Doctors such as Alice Bunker Stockham counseled patients against them, particularly during maternity; reformist and activist Catharine Beecher was one of the few to defy propriety norms and discuss the gynecological issues resulting from lifelong corset usage, in particular uterine prolapse. Feminist historian Leigh Summers theorized that some moral panic derived from the common but unspeakable idea that tightlacing could be used to induce an abortion. 

American women active in the anti-slavery and temperance movements, having experience in public speaking and political agitation, demanded sensible clothing that would not restrict their movement. While supporters of fashionable dress contended that corsets maintained an upright, &#x27;good figure&#x27;, as a necessary physical structure for moral and well-ordered society, these dress reformists contested that women&#x27;s fashions were not only physically detrimental, but &quot;the results of male conspiracy to make women subservient by cultivating them in slave psychology.&quot; They believed a change in fashions could change the whole position of women, allowing for greater social mobility, independence from men and marriage, the ability to work for wages, as well as physical movement and comfort.
== &quot;Emancipation waists&quot; and undergarment reform ==

Dress reformers promoted the emancipation waist, or liberty bodice, as a replacement for the corset. The emancipation bodice was a tight sleeveless vest, buttoning up the front, with rows of buttons along the bottom to which could be attached petticoats and a skirt. The entire torso would support the weight of the petticoats and skirt, not just the waist (since the undesirability of hanging the entire weight of full skirts and petticoats from a constricted waist—rather than hanging the garments from the shoulders—was another point often discussed by dress reformers). The bodices had to be fitted by a dressmaker; patterns could be ordered through the mail. Physician Alice Bunker Stockham railed against the corset and said of the pregnancy corset, &quot;The Best pregnancy corset is no corset at all.&quot; The &quot;emancipation union under flannel&quot; was first sold in America in 1868. It combined a waist (shirt) and drawers (leggings) in the form we now know as the union suit. While first designed for women, the union suit was also adopted by men, and is still sold and worn today, by both men and women, as winter underclothing.

In 1878, a German professor named Gustav Jaeger published a book claiming that only clothing made of animal hair, such as wool, promoted health. A British accountant named Lewis Tomalin translated the book, then opened a shop selling Dr Jaeger&#x27;s Sanitary Woollen System, including knitted wool union suits. These were soon called &quot;Jaegers&quot;; they were widely popular.

It is not clear how many women, in either the Americas or on the Continent, wore these so-called &quot;reform&quot; bodices. However, contemporary portrait photography, fashion literature, and surviving examples of the undergarments themselves, all suggest that the corset was almost universal as daily wear by women and young ladies (and numerous fashionable men) until the 1920s, when girdles began to take over.

=== The hygienic corset ===
The primary result of the dress reform movement seems to be the evolution, rather than elimination, of the corset. Because of the public health outcry surrounding corsets and tightlacing, many doctors took it upon themselves to become corsetieres. Many doctors helped to fit their patients with corsets to avoid the dangers of ill-fitting corsets, and some doctors even designed corsets themselves. Roxey Ann Caplin became a widely renowned corset maker, enlisting the help of her husband, a physician, to create corsets which she purported to be more respectful of human anatomy. Inès Gaches-Sarraute designed the straight-front corset in response to her patients&#x27; gynecological issues which were attributed to wearing corsets. The design was intended to reduce pressure on the abdomen and improve overall health. The new S-curve silhouette created by this design quickly caught on among fashion houses in the early 20th century.

==Bloomer suit ==

The most famous product of the dress reform era is the bloomer suit. In 1851, a New England temperance activist named Elizabeth Smith Miller (Libby Miller) adopted what she considered a more rational costume: loose trousers gathered at the ankles, like the trousers worn by Middle Eastern and Central Asian women, topped by a short dress or skirt and vest (waistcoat). She displayed her new clothing to temperance activist and suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who found it sensible and becoming, and adopted it immediately. In this garb, she visited yet another activist, Amelia Bloomer, the editor of the temperance magazine &quot;The Lily&quot;. Bloomer not only wore the costume, she promoted it enthusiastically in her magazine. More women wore the fashion and were promptly dubbed &quot;Bloomers&quot;. A dress reform was supported by a campaign of the National Dress Reform Association, which was founded in 1856.

They put up a fight for a few years, but were subjected to ridicule in the press and harassment on the street. The more conservative of society protested that women had &#x27;lost the mystery and attractiveness as they discarded their flowing robes.&quot;

Amelia Bloomer herself dropped the fashion in 1859, saying that a new invention, the crinoline, was a sufficient reform and that she could return to conventional dress. The bloomer costume died—temporarily. It was to return much later (in a different form), as a women&#x27;s athletic costume in the 1890s and early 1900s.

== Aesthetic Dress movement ==
In the 1870s, a largely English movement led by Mary Eliza Haweis sought dress reform to enhance and celebrate the natural shape of the body, preferring the looser lines of the medieval and renaissance eras. A historic nostalgia for more forgiving fashions, the aesthetic dress movement critiqued fashionable dress for its immovable shapes, and sought the &#x27;fashioning and adorning of a robe&#x27; as tastefully complementary to the natural body.

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and other artistic reformers objected to the elaborately trimmed confections of Victorian fashion with their unnatural silhouette based on a rigid corset and hoops as both ugly and dishonest. Some women associated with the movement adopted a revival style based on romanticised medieval influences such as puffed juliette sleeves and trailing skirts. These styles were made in the soft colors of vegetable dyes, ornamented with hand embroidery in the art needlework style, featured silks, oriental designs, muted colors, natural and frizzed hair, and lacked definitive waist emphasis.

The style spread as an &quot;anti-fashion&quot; called Artistic dress in the 1860s in literary and artistic circles, died back in the 1870s, and reemerged as &quot;Aesthetic dress&quot; in the 1880s, where two of the main proponents were the writer Oscar Wilde and his wife Constance, both of whom gave lectures on the subject. In 1881 The Rational Dress Society was founded in London. The Society advocated divided skirts as a more practical form of clothing, but its president and co-founder, Lady Florence Harberton, went further - when cycling, she wore full &#x27;Rational&#x27; dress, which was a shorter skirt worn over voluminous trousers.

==The rational dress movement by country==

The dress reform movement spread from the United States and Great Britain to the Nordic countries in the 1880s and from Germany to Austria and the Netherlands. The issue was internationally addressed at the International Congress for Women&#x27;s Work and Women&#x27;s Endeavors in Berlin 1896, in which Germany, America, Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Hungary participated.

===Austria===

In Austria the dress reform movement was connected to the Arts and Crafts movement, when the Wiener Secession was founded in 1897 by progressive artists in opposition to the Künstlerhaus.

Josef Hoffman, Koloman Moser, Otto Wagner, Alfred Roller and Hermann Bahr supported dress reform, which they expressed in the &quot;Dokumente der Frauen&quot; in 1902, and some of them contributed with reform dress designs.
Gustav Klimt and Emilie Flöge are said to have cooperated in designing reform fashion, and such clothing was associated with the Wiener Werkstätte.

===Denmark===

In Denmark, the bloomer costume was adopted for girls&#x27; sports wear during ice skating already in the 1860s. While there were no separate dress reform societies founded in Denmark, the women&#x27;s rights society &quot;Dansk Kvindesamfund&quot; actively addressed the issue under the influence of the Swedish Dress Reform Society in the 1880s; they published their own brochure, &quot;Om Sundheden og Kyindedraegten&quot; by J. Frisch, collaborated with Stockholm and Oslo with the design of reform costumes and the exposition of them, notably during the Nordic Exhibition of 1888.

===Finland===

While there were no separate dress reform societies founded in Finland, the women&#x27;s rights society &quot;Suomen Naisyhdistys&quot; actively addressed the issue under the influence of the Swedish Dress Reform Society in the 1880s; they held lectures in many Finnish cities, managed to have the reform costume accepted as sports wear in the girls&#x27; schools of the capital by 1887, and was awarded the grand silver medal for their reform costume for school girls in the exhibition of the Russian Hygienic Society in Saint Petersburg in 1893.

===France===

There were no separate dress reform societies founded in France. While the issue was adopted and discussed by several of the existing French women&#x27;s rights organisations, the issue was not given priority and it was not until the great enthusiasm for bicycling in France in the 1890s that women in general adopted the bloomer costume with trousers and no corsets as sports wear.

In the early 20th century, however, the French fashion industry was finally influenced by the reform dress movement, which abolished the corset by the 1910s.

===Germany===

Germany was a leading country of the in the 19th century, as it was an integrated part of the great health reform movement , which spoke for a health reform in clothing for both women and men supported by medical professionals and scientists such as Gustav Jaeger and Heinrich Lahmann, and freedom from the corset and trousers for women was advocated for already.

The women&#x27;s movement, however, did not engage in the issue until after the International Women&#x27;s Congress in Berlin in September 1896. Two weeks later the German dress reform association, Allgemeiner Verein zur Verbesserung der Frauenkleidung, was founded. Its first exhibition took place in April 1897 in Berlin. 35 manufacturers had submitted reform proposals. Since 1899 there was even a permanent exhibition in Berlin with examples of &quot;improved women&#x27;s clothing&quot;. Like their equivalents in Austria, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, the German dress reform association focused on the reform of women&#x27;s undergarments as the most realistic goal, mainly on corsets. The German movement managed to affect public opinion to such a degree that one of its leading figures, Minna Cauer, was able to report in 1907 that the German corset industry experienced hardships because of a drop in the use of corsets.

===Japan===
Utako Shimoda (1854-1936), a women&#x27;s activist, educator and dress reformer, found traditional kimono to be too restrictive, preventing women and girls from moving and taking part in physical activities, harming their health. While Western dress was being adopted at the time, she also believed corsets to be restrictive and harmful to women&#x27;s health. Utako Shimoda had worked as lady-in-waiting to Empress Shōken from 1871 to 1879. She adapted the clothing worn by ladies-in-waiting at the Japanese imperial court to make a uniform for her Jissen Women&#x27;s University. During the Meiji period (1868–-1912) and Taishō period (1912–-1926), other women&#x27;s schools also adopted the . It became standard wear for high schools in Japan, though it was later mostly replaced with Western sailor-style uniforms.

Inokuchi Akuri also designed sports clothes for children.

At the imperial court, simplified replaced more cumbersome garments.

===The Netherlands===

In the Netherlands, interest for the issue was aroused after the foundation of a dress reform society in neighboring Germany, and in 1899 the Dutch dress reform society &quot;Vereeniging voor Verbetering van Vrouwenkleeding&quot; (V.v.V.v.V.). The dress reform society held lectures, participated in exhibitions and worked with designed to produce a new fashion for women which could be not only attractive but also comfortable and healthy at the same time.

===Norway===

While there were no separate dress reform societies founded in Norway, the women&#x27;s rights society &quot;Norsk Kvinnesaksforening&quot; actively addressed the issue under the influence of the Swedish Dress Reform Society from the 1880s; they collaborated with Stockholm and Copenhagen with the design of reform costumes and the exposition of them, notably during the Nordic Exhibition of 1888.

Norway is in fact described as one of the countries were the interest and success for the issue was greatest. The physician Lorentz Dietrichson, a prominent participant for the abolition of the corset in the corset controversy in both Sweden and Norway, held a lecture in Norway in favor of dress reform already in 1886, as a commentary of the Swedish dress reform movement in which he himself also participated; the Swedish dress reform society successfully exhibited their reform dress in Oslo, the &quot;Norsk Kvinnesaksforening&quot; became interested, and the movement thereby started in Norway the same year as in Sweden. Johanne Biörn held lectures in the Oslo schools, and the Norwegian designer Kristine Dahl experienced success not only in her home country of Norway but also in Sweden, becoming a central figure of the dress reform movement.

===Sweden===
Sweden was a leading nation of the dress reform movement, as the movement came first to Sweden of all the Nordic countries and spread from there to Denmark, Finland and Norway.

In 1885, professor Curt Wallis brought with him the English language dress reform book &quot;Dress and Health&quot; from abroad, which was translated to Swedish by Oscara von Sydow as &quot;Reformdrägten: En bok för qvinnor skrifven af qvinnor&quot;. After a speech by Anne Charlotte Leffler held at the women&#x27;s club &quot;Nya Idun&quot;, the Friends of Handicraft gave Hanna Winge the assignment to design a reform costume, which was produced by Augusta Lundin and exhibited in public, which gave further publicity to the issue, and in 1886, the Swedish Dress Reform Society was founded.

After an initial attempt to launch a reform costume, the Swedish dress reform movement focused on a reform of women&#x27;s underwear, particularly the corset. The Swedish reform dress movement corresponded with their equivalent in Great Britain as well as the American dress reform movement of Annie Jenness Miller.

The dress reform movement did achieve some success in Sweden; by the 1890s, corsets were no longer accepted for the pupils of the Swedish girls&#x27; schools, and the leading Swedish fashion designer Augusta Lundin reported that her clients no longer subjected themselves to tight lacing.

==Eventual shifts in fashion==

Although the Victorian dress reform movement itself failed to enact widespread change in women&#x27;s fashion, social, political, and cultural shifts into the 1920s brought forth an organic relaxation of dress standards.

With new opportunities for women&#x27;s college, the national suffrage amendment of 1920 and women&#x27;s increased public career options during and after World War I, fashion and undergarment structures relaxed, along with the improved social standing of women. Embodying the New Woman idea, women donned masculine-inspired fashions including simple tailored skirt suits, ties, and starched blouses. By the 1920s, male-style garments for casual and sporting activities were less socially condemned. New fashions required lighter undergarments, shorter skirts, looser bodices, trousers, and praised slender &#x27;boyish&#x27; figures. As Lady Duff Gordon remarked, in the 1920s &quot;women took off their corsets, reduced their clothing to the minimum tolerated by conventions and wore clothes which wrapped round them rather than fitted.&quot;

Although forms of corsets, girdles and bras were worn well into the 1960s, as Riegel states, &quot;Feminine emancipation had brought greater dress reform than the most visionary of the early feminists had advocated.&quot;

<doc id="1262502" wikidata="Q7184481" url="?curid=1262502" title="Philip Toynbee">
<text>Theodore Philip Toynbee (25 June 1916 – 15 June 1981) was a British writer and communist. He wrote experimental novels, and distinctive verse novels, one of which was an epic called &quot;Pantaloon&quot;, a work in several volumes, only some of which are published. He also wrote memoirs of the 1930s, and reviews and literary criticism, the latter mainly via his employment with &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper.

==Early life==
He was born in Oxford; his father was the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, and his mother was Rosalind Murray. He was educated at Rugby School, where he became rebellious, reacting against the public school system. Inspired by the example of Esmond Romilly, later a friend, he ran away, returned shortly and was expelled. He later wrote a memoir of Romilly, and Jasper Ridley (1913–1944), entitled &quot;Friends Apart&quot;. Through Romilly, Toynbee met Jessica Mitford, who became a close friend after Esmond died in WWII. He was also influenced by bookshop owner and would-be encourager of the young radical element, David Archer, whom he met through David Gascoyne.

==Career and politics==
At Christ Church, Oxford in the late 1930s he became the first communist president of the Oxford Union, at the height of communism&#x27;s apparent success and social acceptability. He visited Spain at the end of 1936, at the start of the Spanish Civil War, in a student delegation. He was said to have been beaten up by Mosley&#x27;s Blackshirts at a fascist meeting. In 1938–39 he edited the &quot;Birmingham Town Crier&quot;.

During the 1950s he continued to work for &quot;The Observer&quot;, and was one of the more prominent intellectual figures in British life (perhaps to be compared with Edmund Wilson in the United States, for example). In an article written for &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1961, he notoriously proclaimed the irrelevancy of J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, just prior to its paperback publication in America and subsequent cultural phenomenon:
&quot;There was a time when the Hobbit fantasies of Professor Tolkien were being taken very seriously indeed by a great many distinguished literary figures. Mr. Auden is even reported to have claimed that these books were as good as &quot;War and Peace&quot;; Edwin Muir and many others were almost equally enthusiastic. I had a sense that one side or the other must be mad, for it seemed to me that these books were dull, ill-written, whimsical and childish. And for me this had a reassuring outcome, for most of his more ardent supporters were soon beginning to sell out their shares in Professor Tolkien, and today those books have passed into a merciful oblivion.&quot;

==Alternative lifestyle==
In the early to mid-1970s, Toynbee underwent a personal crisis, slowly entering into a period of deep depression. He had become increasingly concerned about ecological matters and this, along with his own ideological temperament, led him to the controversial decision to set up a self-sufficient farming community. His family and friends thought this decision to be close to insane, considering as they did his privacy and routine-loving nature. The community quickly became a commune when Toynbee, Sally and their youngest daughter moved out into a large cottage nearby. Nonetheless, Toynbee and Sally continued to have a great deal of contact with the communards, and along with both spouses&#x27; active alcoholism, it frequently caused considerable tension in their marriage.

Toynbee&#x27;s depression was sometimes immobilising and prevented him from enjoying his day-to-day life and work, and the regularity of his book reviews was sometimes interrupted as he struggled with the depression and the treatment he insisted on receiving for it against the advice of his general practitioner and consultant: electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). He finally got the go-ahead for the treatment in 1977; he received it in Bristol that summer.

The two books that followed the ECT consisted of journal writings Toynbee decided to edit and send off for publication. These largely revolved around his search for some kind of spiritual meaning. It could be said that this arose out of his wish to find some purpose for the deep misery of his worst depression. He was strongly urged to stop drinking alcohol and occasionally managed short periods of abstinence. Yet he never really wanted long-term abstinence enough to make any real success of this. He was as a whole capable of great self-discipline, but needed to want his objectives with intense singular-mindedness in order to achieve them.

The two journal-books were entitled &quot;Part of a Journey&quot; (covering 1977 to 1979) and &quot;End of a Journey&quot; (1979 to 1981). They were generally well-received.

==Personal life==
He married twice: in 1939, to Anne Powell, daughter of Lt-Col George Powell, and in 1950, Sally Smith. 

In the early 1940s Philip and Anne lived a bohemian life in London&#x27;s Fitzrovia, and Philip was drinking heavily. At that time they knew Lucian Freud, Donald Maclean and Robert Kee, Henrietta Moraes and others from David Tennant&#x27;s Gargoyle Club in Soho. Toynbee was later to be found, with Benedict Nicolson, in the Wednesday Club consisting of raffish male writers, artists and journalists. 

In 1945 they moved to the Isle of Wight, for a fresh start. They had two children, the second being Mary Louisa, better known as the journalist Polly Toynbee. Anne later married Richard Wollheim shortly after divorcing Philip in 1950. As a foreign correspondent with &quot;The Observer&quot;, Philip then traveled to Tel Aviv, where he met Sally, who was a secretary for the American Embassy there.

==Death==
Toynbee died at his home in St Briavels, Gloucestershire, with most of his family (he had five children altogether) at his bedside.

<doc id="1262509" wikidata="Q388573" url="?curid=1262509" title="The Christians (band)">
<text>The Christians are a musical ensemble from Liverpool, England. They had the highest selling debut album of any artist at Island Records and international chart hits in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 

==Band biography==
The name of the band refers to the surname of the three brothers that were originally in the line-up, and is also coincidentally guitarist Henry Priestman&#x27;s middle name.

Garry Christian (born 27 February 1955, Liverpool) (lead vocals), Roger Christian (born 13 February 1950; died 8 March 1998 of a brain tumour) (vocals, instrumentalist), Russell Christian (born 8 July 1956) (keyboards, saxophone, vocals), and Henry Priestman (born Henry Christian Priestman, 21 June 1955, in Hedon, brought up in Liverpool) (keyboards, guitars, vocals) formed the band in 1985. Paul Barlow (drums), Mike Bulger (guitar/vocals) and Tony Jones on bass were also early members. Because of a reluctance to tour, Roger left in 1987 to record a solo album.

In &quot;Rock: The Rough Guide&quot;, critic Charles Bottomley, described them as &quot;The Temptations in ripped jeans, producing gritty-centred songs in a sugary vocal shell&quot;.

===Chart history===
Their first five singles all made the top 40 in Britain, and their debut album &quot;The Christians&quot; (1987) entered the UK Albums Chart at number 2. It eventually sold over a million copies. The highest-placed single from this album was &quot;Ideal World&quot;, which reached number 14 in the UK Singles Chart.

In 1988, they released a cover of The Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Harvest for the World&quot;, with all proceeds going to charity. The video for the track was an animation, created by four leading animation companies, including Aardman Animations. The video won several awards, and the single reached number 8 in the UK singles chart, their sixth consecutive British top 40 hit.

1989 saw another charity single success, this time as performers on a version of &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;, released in aid of those affected by the Hillsborough disaster. The single stayed at number one for several weeks (No. 5 in Germany).

Their second album, &quot;Colour&quot;, released in 1990, reached number one in the UK Albums Chart and the top 20 in several other countries; it yielded the international hit &quot;Words&quot;, based on the Irish traditional &quot;Women Of Ireland&quot;, which was No. 18 in the UK (including the Hillsborough charity single, their eighth consecutive UK top 40 hit) and Sweden, No. 5 in the Netherlands (for two weeks), 
and No. 1 in France (also for two weeks). The second single from the album, &quot;I Found Out&quot;, reached No. 22 in France (No. 56 in the UK).

In 1992, the following LP, &quot;Happy in Hell&quot;, charted at number 18. Two songs from the album reached the UK top 40, &quot;What&#x27;s in a Word&quot; (the first single), which also was a top 20 hit in France (with a total chart run of 19 weeks) and entered the top 40 in the Netherlands and the German top 75, reaching No. 60, and &quot;The Bottle&quot;, a cover of the Gil Scott-Heron/Brian Jackson song.

The early 1990s saw the band continuing to tour. A greatest hits album, &quot;The Best of The Christians&quot;, was released in 1993, and peaked at number 22.

===Break up and reformation===
Garry Christian moved to Paris in 1995 to record a solo album &quot;Your Cool Mystery&quot; effectively breaking up the band, although no formal announcement was made, and the door was open to future reformation. In 1998 founding member Roger Christian died from a brain tumour. In 1997 The Christians began to perform together again in an &quot;unplugged&quot; acoustic format. They carried out a thirty-six date tour of the UK, with a similar tour undertaken in 2000, with guitarist and songwriter Paul Campbell, who accompanied them on all of their tours until 2003.

By 2001, The Christians began to write songs for &quot;Prodigal Sons&quot;, which was released in 2003. This was supported by a UK tour in October 2003, and further promotion in France, Spain and UK throughout 2004.

In 2005, Russell Christian decided he no longer wished to tour, and a decision was made to return to a full band format, rather than the four-man &quot;unplugged&quot; line-up that had been touring since 1999. This new &quot;band&quot; comprising Garry Christian (lead vocals), Joey Ankrah (singer, guitar), Neil Griffiths (singer and acoustic guitar), Cliff Watson (bass guitar), Lionel Duke (drums), Mike Triggs (keyboards) was unveiled on the 2009 tour. A download single (released on download on 5 March 2010) was a cover of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Where Do the Children Play?&quot;

2012 was the 25th anniversary for the band, who celebrated with a re-release of &quot;The Christians&quot; and &quot;Colour&quot;. A new album called &quot;Speed of Life&quot; was released in September, with the title track the first single. In August they embarked on a tour of the UK and, on 16 December, they played at Liverpool&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre. They were briefly joined on stage by former band member, Henry Priestman.

Between September 2013 and January 2014, the Christians toured with Go West and Hue &amp; Cry on a 32 date tour of the UK. Their most recent single, &quot;Inner City Blues&quot;, was released in September 2013.

In December 2021, the band released a version of their hit &quot;Man Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, renaming it &quot;Naz Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; in reference to the plight of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, an Iranian-British dual citizen who was detained in Iran from 3 April 2016 to 16 March 2022 on charges of espionage for the British government. The video for the single features her daughter with Richard Ratcliffe, Gabriella.

<doc id="1262528" wikidata="Q1071072" url="?curid=1262528" title="Hidden curriculum">
<text>A hidden curriculum is a set of lessons &quot;which are learned but not openly intended&quot; to be taught in school such as the norms, values, and beliefs conveyed in both the classroom and social environment. In many cases, it occurs as a result of social interactions and expectations. 

Any type of learning experience may include unintended lessons. However, the concept of a hidden curriculum often refers to knowledge gained specifically in primary and secondary school settings. In these scenarios the school strives, as a positive goal, for equal intellectual development among its students, but the hidden curriculum reinforces existing social inequalities through the education of students according to their class and social status. The distribution of knowledge among students is mirrored by the unequal distribution of cultural capital. 

The hidden curriculum can also be seen as a set of norms and behaviors that are not explicitly taught, and students with limited social awareness, such as students with autism spectrum disorder, may not pick up on these norms without having them be explained directly. This set of norms and behaviors also regards the culture of an environment that is unique to that environment, for example the norms and expectations of an office space would vary from those of a classroom. 

Breaktime is an important part of the hidden curriculum in schooling.

== Educational history ==

Early workers in the field of education were influenced by the notion that the preservation of the social privileges, interests, and knowledge of one group within the population was worth the exploitation of less powerful groups. Over time, this theory has become less blatant, yet its underlying tones remain a contributing factor to the issue of the hidden curriculum. Since then, several educational theories have been developed to help give meaning and structure to the hidden curriculum and to illustrate the role that schools play in socialization. 

Theoretical inquiries into the hidden curriculum, as cited by Henry Giroux and Anthony Penna, include for example a structural-functional view of education, a phenomenological view related to the &quot;new&quot; sociology of education, and a radical critical view corresponding to the neo-Marxist analysis of the theory and practice of education. The structural-functional view focuses on how norms and values are conveyed within schools and the acceptance of the idea that those norms and values are necessary for the functioning of society. The phenomenological view suggests that meaning is created through situational encounters and interactions, and it implies that knowledge is somewhat objective. The radical critical view recognizes the relationship between economic and cultural reproduction and stresses the relationships among the theory, ideology, and social practice of learning. 

Although the first two theories have contributed to the analysis of the hidden curriculum, the radical critical view of schooling provides the most insight. Additionally, it acknowledges the perpetuated economic and social aspects of education that are illustrated by the hidden curriculum.

==Aspects of learning==

Various aspects of learning contribute to the success of the hidden curriculum, including practices, procedures, rules, relationships, and structures. These school-specific aspects of learning may include, but are not limited to, the social structures of the classroom, the teacher&#x27;s exercise of authority, the teacher&#x27;s use of language, rules governing the relationship between teachers and students, standard learning activities, textbooks, audio-visual aids, furnishings, architecture, disciplinary measures, timetables, tracking systems, and curricular priorities. Variations among these sources can create the disparities found when comparing the hidden curricula in various class and social statuses. &quot;Every school is both an expression of a political situation and a teacher of politics.&quot;

While the actual material that students absorb through the hidden curriculum is of utmost importance, the personnel who convey it elicit special investigation. This particularly applies to the social and moral lessons conveyed by the hidden curriculum, for the moral characteristics and ideologies of teachers and other authority figures are translated into their lessons, albeit not necessarily on purpose. 

These unintended learning experiences can also result from interactions between peers. Similar to interactions with authority figures, interactions amongst peers can promote moral and social ideals as well as fostering the exchange of information. Thus, these interactions are important sources of knowledge that contribute to the success of the hidden curriculum.

=== Heteronormativity ===
According to Merfat Ayesh Alsubaie, the hidden curriculum of heteronormativity is the erasure of LGBT identities in the curriculum through the privileging of heterosexual identities. In a quote from Gust Yep, heteronormativity is the &quot;presumption and assumption that all human experience is unquestionably and automatically heterosexual&quot;. Laws such as &quot;No Promo Homo&quot; that prohibit the mention or teaching of LGBT identities are considered to reinforce the hidden curriculum of heteronormativity. According to Mary Preston, in addition to No Promo Homo laws, the lack of sexual education in schools removes LGBT identities from the explicit curriculum and contributes to the hidden curriculum of heteronormativity. Currently, over half of the states in the United States are not legally mandated to have any sexual education.

Depending on the cultural norm of the school, when students fall outside the heterosexual norm, other students and teachers have been shown to police them back in line with heteronormative expectations. C. J. Pascoe said policing takes place through the use of bullying behaviors such as the use of words such as &quot;fag, queer, or dyke&quot; which are used to shame students with identities outside the norm. Pascoe said the use of LGBT slurs forms a &quot;Fag Discourse.&quot; The &quot;Fag Discourse&quot; in schools upholds heteronormativity as sacred, works to silence LGBT voices, and embeds these heteronormative ideals within the hidden curriculum.

=== Autism ===
The term &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; also refers to the set of social norms and skills that autistic people have to learn explicitly, but that non-autistic people learn automatically, such as theory of mind. Another aspect of the &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; often taught to autistic students is that of labeling their emotions in an effort to help students avoid alexithymia.

== Function ==

Although the hidden curriculum conveys a great deal of knowledge to its students, the inequality promoted through its disparities among classes and social statuses often invokes a negative connotation. For example, Pierre Bourdieu asserts that education-related capital must be accessible to promote academic achievement. The effectiveness of schools becomes limited when these forms of capital are unequally distributed. Since the hidden curriculum is considered to be a form of education-related capital, it promotes this ineffectiveness of schools as a result of its unequal distribution. As a means of social control, the hidden curriculum promotes the acceptance of a social destiny without promoting rational and reflective consideration. 

According to Elizabeth Vallance, the functions of hidden curriculum include &quot;the inculcation of values, political socialization, training in obedience and docility, the perpetuation of traditional class structure-functions that may be characterized generally as social control.&quot; The hidden curriculum can also be associated with the reinforcement of social inequality, as evidenced by the development of different relationships to capital based on the types of work and work-related activities assigned to students varying by social class.

Although the hidden curriculum has negative connotations, it is not inherently negative, and the tacit factors that are involved can potentially exert a positive developmental force on students. Some educational approaches, such as democratic education, actively seek to minimize, make explicit, and/or reorient the hidden curriculum in such a way that it has a positive developmental impact on students. Similarly, in the fields of environmental education and education for sustainable development, there has been some advocacy for making school environments more natural and sustainable, such that the tacit developmental forces that these physical factors exert on students can become positive factors in their development as environmental citizens.

== Higher education and tracking ==

While studies on the hidden curriculum mostly focus on fundamental primary and secondary education, higher education also feels the effects of this latent knowledge. For example, gender biases become present in specific fields of study; the quality of and experiences associated with prior education become more significant; and differences in class, gender, and race become more evident at higher levels of education.

Additionally, tracking is another aspect of the hidden curriculum that plays a major role in the development of students. This method of imposing educational and career paths upon students at young ages relies on a variety of factors such as class and status in order to reinforce socioeconomic differences. Children tend to be placed on tracks that guide them towards socioeconomic occupations similar to that of their parents, without real considerations for their personal strengths and weaknesses. As students advance through the educational system, they follow their tracks by completing these predetermined courses.

== Literary references ==

John Dewey explored the hidden curriculum of education in his early 20th century works, especially in his classic, &quot;Democracy and Education&quot;. Dewey saw patterns evolving and trends developing in public schools which lent themselves to his pro-democratic perspectives. His work was quickly rebutted by educational theorist George Counts, whose 1929 book, &quot;Dare the School Build a New Social Order?,&quot; challenged the presumptive nature of Dewey&#x27;s works. Counts claimed that Dewey hypothesized a singular path through which all young people travelled in order to become adults without considering the reactive, adaptive, and multifaceted nature of learning. Counts emphasizes that this nature of learning caused many educators to slant their perspectives, practices, and assessments of student performance in directions that affected their students drastically. Counts&#x27; examinations were expanded on by Charles A. Beard and, later, Myles Horton who created what became the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee.

The phrase &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; was coined by Philip W. Jackson (&quot;Life In Classrooms&quot;, 1968). He argued that we need to understand &quot;education&quot; as a socialization process. Shortly after Jackson&#x27;s coinage of the term, MIT&#x27;s Benson Snyder published &quot;The Hidden Curriculum,&quot; which addresses the question of why students—even, or especially, the most gifted—turn away from education. Snyder advocates the thesis that much of campus conflict and students&#x27; personal anxiety is caused by a mass of unstated academic and social norms, which thwart the students&#x27; abilities to develop independently and think creatively.

The hidden curriculum has been further explored by a number of educators. Starting with &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot;, published in 1972, through the late 1990s, Brazilian educator Paulo Freire explored various effects of presumptive teaching on students, schools, and society as a whole. Freire&#x27;s explorations were in sync with those of John Holt and Ivan Illich, each of whom were quickly identified as radical educators. Other theorists who have identified the nature of hidden curricula and hidden agendas include Neil Postman, Paul Goodman, Joel Spring, John Taylor Gatto, and others.

More recent definitions have been given by Roland Meighan (&quot;A Sociology of Education,&quot; 1981) and Michael Haralambos (&quot;Sociology: Themes and Perspectives,&quot; 1991). Meighan wrote, &quot;The hidden curriculum is not taught by the school, and by any teacher...something is coming across to the pupils which may never be spoken in the English lesson or prayed about in assembly. They are picking-up an approach to living and an attitude to learning.&quot; Haralambos wrote, &quot;The hidden curriculum consists of those things pupils learn through the experience of attending school rather than the stated educational objectives of such institutions.&quot; 

Further, educational critics Henry Giroux, bell hooks, and Jonathan Kozol have also examined the effects of the hidden curriculum.

Additionally, developmental psychologist Robert Kegan addressed the hidden curriculum of everyday life in his 1994 book &quot;In Over Our Heads&quot;, which focused on the relation between cognitive development and the &quot;cognitive demands&quot; of cultural expectations.

Professor of communication Joseph Turow, in his 2017 book &quot;The Aisles Have Eyes&quot;, used the concept to describe acculturation to massive personal data collection; he wrote, &quot;The very activities that dismay privacy and anti-discrimination advocates are already beginning to become everyday habits in American lives, and part of Americans&#x27; cultural routines. Retailing is at the leading edge of a new &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; for American society—teaching people what they have to give up in order to get along in the twenty-first century.&quot;

<doc id="1262538" wikidata="Q314343" url="?curid=1262538" title="James Shaffer">
<text>James Christian Shaffer (born June 16, 1970), also known by his stage name &quot;Munky&quot;, is an American musician best known as a co-founder and guitarist of the nu metal band Korn. He was ranked at No. 26 of Guitar World&#x27;s 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time. 

Shaffer set up the side-project band Fear and the Nervous System in 2008 and is also the founder of Emotional Syphon Recordings, who have signed acts like Monster in the Machine and Droid.

==Early life==
Shaffer was born June 16, 1970, in Rosedale, California. He was adopted by his parents as an infant, along with two other siblings. Shaffer and the other members of Korn grew up in an agricultural town of Bakersfield, California, two hours north of Los Angeles. When trying to sneak out to a party, the tip of one of his fingers was severed by the chain on his three-wheeler, and, as part of his rehabilitation, Shaffer picked up a guitar. During high school, Shaffer met fellow guitarist Brian Welch and the two would often jam together.

==Career==
===Early musical career===
Shaffer, along with fellow future Korn members, David Silveria and Reginald Arvizu formed a band called L.A.P.D. with singer Richard Morill. When the band moved from Bakersfield, California to Los Angeles, Silveria dropped out of high school and Shaffer stayed in Bakersfield. When Shaffer reunited with the band, they found a manager and released an EP entitled Love and Peace Dude in 1989 through Triple X Records. L.A.P.D. released their first full-length studio album on May 3, 1991, which consisted of eleven tracks. The album was entitled Who&#x27;s Laughing Now. After releasing two albums, L.A.P.D. broke up. They were also briefly known as Creep, recording a demo with a singer named Corey until Shaffer, Arvizu, and Silveria enlisted Brian Welch and Jonathan Davis to form the band that went on to become Korn.

===Korn (1993–present)===

When thinking of a band name, someone suggested &quot;corn&quot;, but the band rejected that name, so Shaffer had the idea to spell the name with both a &quot;K&quot; instead of a &quot;C&quot;, and a backwards &quot;R&quot;, so the band&#x27;s name would appear as &quot;KoЯn&quot;. The idea of using a backwards &quot;R&quot; came from the logo of toy retailer Toys R Us, for which many of the band members had previously worked.

On February 22, 2005, Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch left the band. Shaffer accepted his friend&#x27;s choice and the two remained on good terms. When drummer David Silveria left the band, Shaffer said in an interview that he had a strong friendship with him and was very sad to hear that he had to leave.

On an interview about Welch&#x27;s departure, Shaffer said he felt pressure because they were always working together, writing songs, and creating albums. But when Welch left, he had to write all the guitar parts into one part, so Korn could play live, and he continued to play like that until Korn got a backing guitarist. Welch officially returned to the band on May 2, 2013, to work on the album &quot;The Paradigm Shift&quot; that was released in October 2013.

===Fear and the Nervous System (2008–present)===
On March 4, 2008, it was announced that Shaffer would be releasing a solo record on August 8, 2008, with his solo band Fear and The Nervous System which would feature Shaffer doing vocals and guitars, Brooks Wackerman of Bad Religion (who also performed on Korn&#x27;s eighth album) on drums, Leopold Ross on guitars and programming, Bill Gould of Faith No More fame, and Zac Baird (Korn&#x27;s keyboardist) on keyboards and programming. The record would be produced by Shaffer and Ross Robinson. Guitarist and friend Wes Borland originally recorded guitars for two songs on the album but they would not make the final cut. Borland also created cover art that would still be used on the album. The band&#x27;s debut album was originally due out August 8, 2008, but was pushed back multiple times until its release in 2011.

On Modlife in October 2009 (Korn.com), Shaffer explained that he would not be doing vocals on the Fear and the Nervous System album because he is not &quot;very good at singing.&quot; It was later announced that Steve Krolikowski of Repeater would be handling vocal duties.

===Emotional Syphon Recordings (2006–present)===
In 2006, Shaffer founded Emotional Syphon Records to give daring and diverse bands a chance to be heard. The first bands to be signed were Droid and Monster In The Machine, however Shaffer says he does not want to limit himself to only releasing metal acts but to create a multi-genre label.

===Venera (2023–present)===
In 2023, Shaffer announced the formation of Venera, an glitch music project with Chris Hunt; the self-titled debut album came out on Ipecac Recordings on October 13.

==Personal life==
On January 15, 2000, Shaffer married Stephanie Roush. Together, they had a daughter. In 2004, Shaffer and Roush got divorced. Shaffer then started to date actress and model Evis Xheneti in 2005. They were married on January 2, 2012, in Paris, France. They have three children together, born in 2012, 2015 and 2019.

==Equipment==

Shaffer predominantly uses Ibanez guitars, most often his signature Ibanez Apex 7-string model and Mesa/Boogie Triple Rectifier and Diezel guitar amplifiers. Like Welch, he uses many pedals and effects to shape the distinct Korn sound. Shaffer describes his live pedal board as a &quot;spaceship&quot; because of the large, diverse quantity of effects he uses.

<text>The Parliament of New South Wales, formally the Legislature of New South Wales, is the bicameral legislative body of the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW). It consists of the Monarch, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly (lower house) and the New South Wales Legislative Council (upper house). Each house is directly elected by the people of New South Wales at elections held approximately every four years. The legislative authority of the parliament derives from section 5 of the &quot;Constitution Act 1902&quot; (NSW). The power to make laws that apply to New South Wales is shared with the Federal (or Commonwealth) Parliament. The houses of the New South Wales Parliament follow the Westminster parliamentary traditions, green and red chamber colours and protocols for the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, respectively. The houses of the legislature are located in Parliament House on Macquarie Street in Sydney.

==History==
The Parliament of New South Wales was the first of the Australian colonial legislatures, with its formation in the 1850s. At the time, New South Wales was a British colony under the control of the Governor. A small, appointed Legislative Council began meeting in 1824 to advise the Governor on legislative matters. By 1843, this had been enlarged, with two-thirds of its members elected by adult males who met certain property requirements.

In 1850, the &quot;Australian Colonies Government Act&quot; was passed by the Imperial Parliament, which expanded the New South Wales Legislative Council so that by 1851 there were 54 members – again, with two-thirds elected. In 1853, a select committee chaired by William Wentworth began drawing up a constitution for responsible self-government in the colony. While many of the provisions in the committee&#x27;s proposed constitution were accepted when placed before the Legislative Council in August that year, a proposal to create a colonial nobility was subject to heavy criticism and later withdrawn.

The approved bicameral structure included a fully elected Legislative Assembly, as well as a Legislative Council whose members were appointed for life. A government assumed most of the Governor&#x27;s legislative powers. The new constitution was sent to the Imperial Parliament and passed into law on 16 July 1855. On 22 May 1856, the newly constituted New South Wales Parliament opened and sat for the first time. With the new 54-member Legislative Assembly taking over the Council chamber, a second meeting chamber for the 21-member upper house had to be added to the Parliament building on Macquarie Street.

The &quot;Electoral Act of 1858&quot; made additional changes. The right to vote was extended to most males over 21 years of age. However, men &quot;in the receipt of aid from any charitable institution&quot; were ineligible. This was deemed to include all people living on Aboriginal stations and reserves. Other men not able to vote included those &quot;of unsound mind&quot;, incarcerated individuals, and members of the military or the police.

In 1859 Queensland separated from New South Wales to form an independent colony. The Legislative Assembly was reduced from 80 to 72 members by the loss of the Queensland seats. In 1901, New South Wales became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, and many government functions were transferred to the new Commonwealth government. In 1902, the current constitution of New South Wales was adopted.

Women gained the right to vote in Commonwealth elections in April 1902, and in New South Wales state elections in August 1902. In 1918, reforms permitted women to be members of Parliament, although no woman was elected until 1925 when Millicent Preston-Stanley was elected to represent the Eastern Suburbs. That same year, a proportional representation system was introduced for the Legislative Assembly with multiple representatives from each electorate; this system lasted until it was abolished in 1926. Women were not able to be appointed to the Legislative Council until 1926; Premier John Storey attempted to appoint Kate Dwyer to the Legislative Council in 1921, but the appointment was ruled out of order. The first two women appointed to the Legislative Council were both Labor Party members proposed on 23 November 1931: Catherine Green, who took her seat the following day, and Ellen Webster, who joined her two days later.

In 1925, 1926, and 1929, Premier Jack Lang made unsuccessful attempts to abolish the Legislative Council, following the example of the Queensland Legislative Council in 1922. These attempts led to further reform, and in 1933 the law was changed so that a quarter of the Legislative Council would be elected every three years by members of the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, rather than being appointed by the Governor.

From 1926, people receiving aid could again be on the electoral roll. Compulsory voting was introduced in 1928.

In 1978, the Council became a directly elected body in a program of electoral reform introduced by the Wran Labor government. The number of members was reduced to 45, although transitional arrangements meant that there were 43 members from 1978 to 1981, and 44 from 1981 to 1984. Further reform in 1991 by the Greiner Liberal–National government saw the size of the Legislative Council cut to 42 members, with half being elected every 4 years. In 1991, the Legislative Assembly was reduced from 109 to 99 members and then to 93 members in 1999.

===Parliament House===

The Parliament building was originally built on the orders of Governor Lachlan Macquarie, to be Sydney&#x27;s second major hospital. In 1810, he awarded the contract to Garnham Blaxcell, Alexander Riley and D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth. The contract gave the builders the right to import 45,000 gallons of rum, for which they paid a duty of 3 shillings a gallon. They were able to sell it for a huge profit and in turn the government refunded them the duty as a payment for their work, thereby gaining for their construction the title of the &#x27;Rum Hospital&#x27;. Originally consisting of three buildings, the central main building was demolished in 1879 to make way for the new Sydney Hospital, which was completed in 1885. The first building, now known as the Sydney Mint, was given to the Royal Mint in 1851 to become the Australian branch of its operations; it remained a mint until 1927.

The second building, originally built as the Chief Surgeon&#x27;s quarters, was given to the government in 1829 for the purposes of a Parliament chamber. This chamber was added to following the growth of the legislature in 1843, and again in 1856. The last major renovation to the building was undertaken between 1974 and 1985, which saw a jumble of buildings that had become the parliamentary chambers demolished and replaced by a 12-story block linked by a fountain court to the original Parliament House. The building was also restored to its 1908 appearance.

==Composition and powers==

The legislative authority, the King-in-Parliament, has three separate elements: the monarch; the Legislative Assembly; and the Legislative Council. This authority is granted by section 5 of the &quot;Constitution Act 1902&quot;; an Act that itself was passed by the NSW Parliament under the authority granted to it from the &quot;Constitution Act 1855.&quot; This was an Act originating from a bill from the pre-responsible government Legislative Council, that was slightly modified and given the force of law by an Act of the UK Parliament. 

All 93 members of the Legislative Assembly are elected at each general election from single-member districts using optional preferential voting to terms of up to four years. The 42 Legislative Council members are elected for two terms (a maximum of eight years), with half elected at each general election. Elections for the Legislative Council are conducted on a statewide, at-large basis (meaning all members represent the entire state) using the single transferable vote system similar to that used for elections to the federal Senate.

In the running of Parliament, the two presiding officers have a role that is similar to Ministers and their departments. The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and the President of the Legislative Council are responsible for the employment of staff. In consultation with the parliamentary clerks, the presiding officers determine policy for the operation of their respective chambers and jointly for the Parliament.

The final step for a bill passed by the houses of parliament to become a law is the granting of royal assent by the Governor on behalf of the King. Other powers of the governor in relation to Parliament include the power to prorogue, summon and dissolve the houses, issue writs for elections and administer oaths to new members of parliament. These powers are in almost all circumstances exercised on the advice of the premier of New South Wales. The premier and government are directly accountable to Parliament through its control of public finances and the need for its confidence, and to the public through members of Parliament.

The governor chooses the premier, usually depending on the results of the general election, who then forms a government from members of the houses of Parliament. This must be someone who can command the confidence of a majority of members in the Legislative Assembly — usually as part of a political party. This is usually a straightforward decision, though occasionally the governor has to make a judgment, as in August 1939 when the governor, Lord Wakehurst, handled a major political crisis brought about when the former deputy leader of the governing United Australia Party, Eric Spooner, brought down Premier Bertram Stevens in a motion of no confidence. Wakehurst asked the treasurer, Alexander Mair, to form a government.

The current premier of New South Wales is Chris Minns of the Labor Party.

Government ministers (including the premier) must regularly answer questions in the chambers and there are a number of select committees that scrutinise particular issues and the workings of the government. There are also mechanisms that allow members of Parliament to bring to the attention of the government particular issues affecting their constituents.

For a bill to become law, it must be passed by both the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly and be assented to by the governor. Under Section 5A of the Constitution Act 1902, a bill appropriating revenue for the ordinary annual services of the government can be presented to the governor for assent even if the upper house has not agreed to it.

==State opening and traditions==
The state opening of Parliament is an annual event that marks the commencement of a session of the Parliament of New South Wales. It is held in the Legislative Council Chamber, usually in November or December, or in a general election year, when the new Parliament first assembles. It is an occasion for much pomp and ceremony, usually with a guard of honour and with dignitaries of the state attending. The New South Wales Parliament maintains many of the traditions of the original Parliament of the United Kingdom, from which the New South Wales Parliament was founded.

The Governor, or occasionally the Monarch, reads a prepared speech, known as the Speech from the Throne, outlining the government&#x27;s agenda for the coming year. The speech is not written by the governor, but rather by the Cabinet, and reflects the legislative agenda for which they seek the agreement of both houses of Parliament.

Queen Elizabeth II opened the New South Wales Parliament on two occasions, on 4 February 1954, as part of her first visit to Australia, which was also the first occasion in which a Monarch of Australia had opened a session of any Australian parliament. The other occasion was on 20 February 1992, during her visit to Sydney to celebrate the sesquicentenary of the incorporation of the City of Sydney, on which occasion she stated:
==Emblem==
The official emblem of the New South Wales Parliament is a crowned circlet featuring the coat of arms of New South Wales taking the form of a Scottish crest badge. Crest badges, much like clan tartans, do not have a long history, and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, having only been worn on the bonnet since the mid-19th century when the buckled strap device commonly used by the Order of the Garter was adopted as a popular design to encircle monogram escutcheons and heraldic crests.

The crest badge came to be accepted in the mid-20th century as the emblem of both houses of Parliament. The emblem appears on official stationery, publications and papers, and is stamped on various items in use in the Parliament, such as cutlery, silverware and china.

<text>Adam Keefe Horovitz (born October 31, 1966), popularly known as Ad-Rock, is an American rapper, guitarist, and actor. He was a member of the hip-hop group Beastie Boys. While Beastie Boys were active, Horovitz performed with a side project, BS 2000. Since the group disbanded in 2012 following the death of Adam Yauch, Horovitz has participated in several Beastie Boys-related projects, worked as a remixer, producer, and guest musician for other artists, and acted in a number of films.

== Early life and education ==
Horovitz was born on October 31, 1966, and raised on Park Avenue, Manhattan, New York, the son of Doris (&quot;née&quot; Keefe) and playwright Israel Horovitz. His sister is film producer Rachael Horovitz. His father was Jewish, whereas his mother, who was of Irish descent, was Catholic. He had a secular upbringing.

== Career ==

Horovitz began his music career with a stint in the punk rock band The Young and the Useless, who often performed with Beastie Boys. In 1982, Beastie Boys guitarist John Berry quit and Horovitz replaced him. He was only 16 at the time. After Horovitz joined the band, Beastie Boys changed their sound, evolving from a hardcore punk band to a more of a hip-hop group. The band was signed to Def Jam, and released its debut album, &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;, in 1986. The album was a huge commercial success and spawned six singles, of which one, &quot;(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)&quot;, reached the top 20 of the US Hot 100 (US #7). The album was certified diamond several years later. Several albums followed, with some attaining platinum or multi-platinum status, and by 2010, Beastie Boys had sold 40 million albums worldwide, including 22 in the U.S. In 2012, Beastie Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In addition to his work with Beastie Boys, Horovitz remixes numerous tracks for other artists under the alias 41 Small Stars. He plays bass in The Tender Moments, the backing band of New York-based cabaret performer Bridget Everett.

Horovitz has acted in several motion pictures and television shows. His roles include Tim &quot;Chino&quot; Doolan in &quot;Lost Angels&quot; (1989), Sam in &quot;Roadside Prophets&quot; (1992), Repulski in &quot;Godspeed&quot; (2007), Fletcher in &quot;While We&#x27;re Young&quot; (2014), and Nick in &quot;Golden Exits&quot; (2017).

In 2020, he was featured in the documentary &quot;Have a Good Trip&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In the late 1980s, Horovitz was in a relationship with American actress Molly Ringwald. They met on the set of &quot;The Pick-up Artist&quot;.

Horovitz was married to actress Ione Skye from 1992 to 1999. She is mentioned in the song &quot;Get It Together&quot;. They separated in 1995, got back together in 1996, and separated again that year. They divorced in 2000.

After his separation in 1996, he entered into a relationship with riot grrrl artist Kathleen Hanna; they married in 2006. Horovitz appeared prominently in &quot;The Punk Singer&quot;, a 2013 documentary film about Hanna&#x27;s life and career, and even shot some scenes. Horovitz and Hanna adopted a son, Julius Hanna Horovitz, in 2013. 

Horovitz began to wear a medical alert bracelet after having a tonic–clonic seizure in 2003.

Horovitz has been close friends with actress Nadia Dajani since childhood; the two attended elementary school together.

<doc id="1262556" wikidata="Q409304" url="?curid=1262556" title="Methylamine">
<text>Methylamine, also known as methanamine, is an organic compound with a formula of . This colorless gas is a derivative of ammonia, but with one hydrogen atom being replaced by a methyl group. It is the simplest primary amine.

Methylamine is sold as a solution in methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, or water, or as the anhydrous gas in pressurized metal containers. Industrially, methylamine is transported in its anhydrous form in pressurized railcars and tank trailers. It has a strong odor similar to rotten fish. Methylamine is used as a building block for the synthesis of numerous other commercially available compounds.

== Industrial production ==
Methylamine has been produced industrially since the 1920s (originally by Commercial Solvents Corporation for dehairing of animal skins). This was made possible by and his wife Eugenia who discovered amination of alcohols, including methanol, on alumina or kaolin catalyst after WWI, filed two patent applications in 1919 and published an article in 1921.

It is now prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with methanol in the presence of an aluminosilicate catalyst. Dimethylamine and trimethylamine are co-produced; the reaction kinetics and reactant ratios determine the ratio of the three products. The product most favored by the reaction kinetics is trimethylamine.
In this way, an estimated 115,000 tons were produced in 2005.

==Laboratory methods==
Methylamine was first prepared in 1849 by Charles-Adolphe Wurtz via the hydrolysis of methyl isocyanate and related compounds. An example of this process includes the use of the Hofmann rearrangement, to yield methylamine from acetamide and bromine.

In the laboratory, methylamine hydrochloride is readily prepared by various other methods. One method entails treating formaldehyde with ammonium chloride.
:
The colorless hydrochloride salt can be converted to an amine by the addition of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH):

Another method entails reducing nitromethane with zinc and hydrochloric acid.

Another method of methylamine production is spontaneous decarboxylation of glycine with a strong base in water.

== Reactivity and applications ==
Methylamine is a good nucleophile as it is an unhindered amine. As an amine it is considered a weak base. Its use in organic chemistry is pervasive. Some reactions involving simple reagents include: with phosgene to methyl isocyanate, with carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide to the sodium methyldithiocarbamate, with chloroform and base to methyl isocyanide and with ethylene oxide to methylethanolamines. Liquid methylamine has solvent properties analogous to those of liquid ammonia.

Representative commercially significant chemicals produced from methylamine include the pharmaceuticals ephedrine and theophylline, the pesticides carbofuran, carbaryl, and metham sodium, and the solvents &quot;N&quot;-methylformamide and &quot;N&quot;-methylpyrrolidone. The preparation of some surfactants and photographic developers require methylamine as a building block.

== Biological chemistry ==
Methylamine arises as a result of putrefaction and is a substrate for methanogenesis.

Additionally, methylamine is produced during PADI4-dependent arginine demethylation.

== Safety ==
The LD50 (mouse, s.c.) is 2.5 g/kg.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have set occupational exposure limits at 10 ppm or 12 mg/m3 over an eight-hour time-weighted average.

== Regulation ==
In the United States, methylamine is controlled as a List 1 precursor chemical by the Drug Enforcement Administration due to its use in the illicit production of methamphetamine.

== In popular culture ==
Fictional characters Walter White and Jesse Pinkman use aqueous methylamine as part of a process to synthesize methamphetamine in the AMC series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.

<doc id="1262558" wikidata="Q3365548" url="?curid=1262558" title="Parliament of Queensland">
<text>The Parliament of Queensland is the legislature of the Australian state of Queensland. As provided under the Constitution of Queensland, the Parliament consists of the King, represented by the governor, and the Legislative Assembly. It has been the only unicameral state legislature in the country since the upper chamber, the Legislative Council, was abolished in 1922. The Legislative Assembly sits in Parliament House in the state capital, Brisbane.

The Queensland Parliament retains plenary legislative power over Queensland, however Commonwealth laws apply to the extent of any inconsistency. Some laws from the colonial era passed by the New South Wales parliament and the Imperial Parliament also remain in force.

Following the outcome of the 2015 election, four additional seats were added to the Legislative Assembly (to a total of 93), the voting system changed from optional preferential voting to full-preferential voting, and unfixed three-year terms were replaced with fixed four-year terms.

==History==
The Parliament was founded 22 May 1860, less than a year after the Colony of Queensland was created in June 1859. It was convened at military and convict barracks converted for the purpose located on Queen Street, Brisbane. Immigration was an important issue for the early Parliament. Population growth was encouraged with new settlers enticed by land ownership.

In 1915, Queensland became the first state to make voting compulsory at state elections.

Since 1 April 2003, live audio broadcasts have streamed through the internet from the Parliament while it is in session. In June 2007, the Parliament started broadcasting video of parliamentary proceedings. Nine in-house television cameras are used to record sessions.

The first female Speaker, Fiona Simpson was elected on 15 May 2012.

==Membership==

The Assembly has 93 members of Parliament (MPs). These are intended to represent approximately the same population in each electorate. Voting is by the full preferential voting system, with elections held every four years.

In April 2016, legislation was passed to increase the number of seats in the parliament by four to a total of 93. An amendment was also passed to abolish optional preferential voting. A referendum held the previous month was passed, supporting a bill to establish fixed four-year terms.

==Royal assent==
The role of the monarch in Parliament is to give royal assent to legislation. This function is in practice exercised by the governor of Queensland, who conventionally will never refuse assent to a bill that has passed the Legislative Assembly. The party or coalition with the most seats in the house is invited by the governor to form a government.

The leader of that party subsequently becomes the premier of Queensland, leading a Cabinet of ministers. In the Liberal National Party, the premier selects members of their party to act as ministers. In the Labor Party, the ministers are elected by party room ballot, with the leader then assigning ministerial portfolios to each one.

==Operations==
Once all winning candidates have been declared, the governor of Queensland proclaims a date for the start of the new Parliament. It is the role of the Clerk of the Parliament to call members to attendance.

According to the Constitution of Queensland, members of Parliament must swear an oath or affirmation to the King as well as an oath of office before signing a Roll of Members. This oath or affirmation must be made to the governor or someone authorised by him or her—typically the clerk of the Parliament.

Sworn-in representatives are required to elect a Speaker to preside over the House&#x27;s business. Before this occurs, the longest serving member who is not a minister presides over the procedings. Once elected the Speaker is dragged to the chair and presented to the Governor at Government House. The symbol of the authority of the Parliament and its Speaker is the ceremonial mace. The sergeant-at-arms carries the mace into the chamber of parliament when the speaker enters at the start of each sitting day and removes it again when the speaker leaves at the end of the sitting day. During the sitting day, the mace rests on two raised brackets on the centre table with the head of the mace lying pointed towards the government&#x27;s side. The current mace was designed and made in 1978 and is sterling silver with gold plating and is encrusted with 32 Queensland gemstones. Despite being the symbol of Parliament, it is engraved with the words &quot;Government of Queensland&quot;.

The ceremonial opening of the new Parliament is marked by a speech by the governor. Traditionally the speech is written by the new government and it may outline current activities, budget details, statistics and proposed lists of legislation which are intended to be introduced.

A day in Parliament usually begins with housekeeping matters, including prayers, notifications and the tabling of any documents. An opportunity is then given to Ministers to make statements. During a period of no more than an hour, known as question time, any member may pose a question to a Minister.

==Regional sittings==
Starting in 2002, the Queensland Parliament has held regional sittings of parliament across the state. Originally being held every three years, the occurrence has become more sporadic, and, in 2023, the regional sitting took place in Cairns. It was the first sitting since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the second in twelve years.

==Distribution of seats==

As of 13 September 2024, the composition of Parliament is:
* 47 votes as a majority are required to pass legislation.

<text>The Parliament of Western Australia is the bicameral legislature of the Australian state of Western Australia, which constitutes the legislative branch of the state&#x27;s political system. The parliament consists of the King (represented by the governor), the Legislative Council (the upper house) and the Legislative Assembly (the lower house). The two houses of parliament sit in Parliament House in the state capital, Perth.

For a bill to become law, it must be passed by both the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, and receive royal assent from the Governor.

The party or coalition commanding the support of a majority of the members of the Legislative Assembly is invited by the governor to form government. The head of government holds the office of Premier of Western Australia.

Currently, the Legislative Council has 36 members elected for four-year terms from multi-member constituencies by proportional representation, and the Legislative Assembly has 59 members, elected for four-year terms from single-member constituencies, using preferential voting. As with all other Australian states and territories, enrolment to vote and voting for both Houses is compulsory for all resident Australian citizens—and eligible British citizens (i.e., those permanently resident and on the electoral roll prior to the passage of the Australia Act)—who are over the legal voting age of 18.

==History==
The Western Australian Legislative Council was created in 1832 as an appointed body. In 1870 the then colony was ruled by a governor and an advisory Legislative Council made up of appointed officials and elected members. The Western Australian Legislative Assembly was created in 1890 when the then colony attained self-government. The first premier was John Forrest, who held office until 1901.

On 3 November 2011, the government introduced fixed four-year terms for Parliament, with elections being held every four years on the second Saturday in March. The 2013 state election was the first election under the fixed date system.

==Acts of Parliament==
The oldest recorded act of Parliament in Western Australia is the &quot;Civil Court of Western Australia (1832)&quot; act, an act for establishing a Court of Civil Judicature, assented to on 10 February 1832, under the first Governor of Western Australia, James Stirling. It predates the Parliament of Western Australia and was passed by the Western Australian Legislative Council instead. All up, ten acts were passed in 1832.

Since 1832, acts have been passed in every year but 1890, the year the Western Australian Parliament was formed. The last act to be passed prior to the establishment of the Parliament was the &quot;Electoral Act 1889&quot;, assented to on 26 June 1890.

In 2023, the Western Australian Parliament passed 34 acts.

<text>The Parliament of South Australia is the bicameral legislature of the Australian state of South Australia. It consists of the 47-seat House of Assembly (lower house) and the 22-seat Legislative Council (upper house). General elections are held every 4 years, with all of the lower house and half of the upper house filled at each election. It follows a Westminster system of parliamentary government with the executive branch required to both sit in parliament and hold the confidence of the House of Assembly. The parliament is based at Parliament House on North Terrace in the state capital of Adelaide.

Unlike the federal parliament and the parliaments of most other states, the South Australian Constitution does not define the parliament as including either the monarch or the governor of South Australia as one of its constituent parts. However, the constitution also vests legislative power in the state&#x27;s governor acting with the advice and consent of both houses of parliament, making the role of the governor effectively the same as those of the other states. 

The parliament may make laws for any matter within South Australia, subject to the Constitution of South Australia. Its power is further limited by the ability for the federal parliament to override it in some circumstances, subject to the Constitution of Australia. Similarly, the Supreme Court of South Australia, and ultimately the High Court of Australia, provides judicial oversight of parliament. The parliament is also vested with other powers, such as the means to investigate matters, conduct research and summon witnesses.

==History==
===Early colonial period and establishment===
At the founding of the Province of South Australia under the &quot;South Australia Act 1834&quot;, governance of the new colony was divided between the Governor of South Australia and a Resident Commissioner, who reported to a new body known as the &quot;South Australian Colonization Commission&quot;. Under this arrangement, there was also a governing Council comprising the Governor, the Judge or Chief Justice, the Colonial Secretary, the Advocate-General and the Resident Commissioner, with broad legislative and executive powers including the imposition of rates, duties, and taxes. This council was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Legislative Council&quot;. Confusion and dispute about the division of power between the two roles led to the &quot;South Australia Government Act 1838&quot;, which combined the role of Resident Commissioner with that of the Governor.

In 1842, the &quot;South Australia Act 1842&quot; was passed in order to replace the South Australian Colonisation Commission appointed in 1834 with a more standard British model of government, with a Governor advised by a Legislative Council. The 1842 Act gave the British Government, which was responsible for appointing a Governor and at least seven other officers to the Legislative Council, full control of South Australia as a Crown Colony, after financial mismanagement by the first administration had nearly bankrupted the colony. This new Legislative Council was the first true parliamentary body in South Australia. The Act also made provision for a commission to initiate the establishment of democratic government, electoral districts, requirements for voting rights, and terms of office. Although the old governing Council advising the Governor met at Government House, this new Legislative Council met at a new purpose built chamber on North Terrace. This chamber eventually grew into what is now known as &quot;Old Parliament House&quot;.

The &quot;Australian Colonies Government Act 1850&quot; was a landmark development which granted representative constitutions to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and the colonies enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments with the British monarch as the symbolic head of state. In 1851 elections for the Legislative Council were held. The new Council consisted of 24 members, four official (filling what would be today ministerial positions) and four non-official members, both nominated by the governor on behalf of the Crown, and 16 elected members chosen from single-member districts. The right to vote for these positions was not universal, however, being limited to propertied men. In addition, the reforms meant that the Governor no longer oversaw proceedings, with the role being filled by a Speaker who had been elected by the members.

In 1853 the Legislative Council sent London a &quot;Parliament Act 1853&quot; that provided for a new constitution that established a bicameral parliament with an elected lower house and an upper house made up of members nominated for life. The colonists were mistakenly under the impression that only such a scheme would be acceptable to the British Government. The Governor, Sir Henry Young, had been advised that this was not the case but he kept this information to himself. The colonists were furious and 5,000 petitioned Westminster to give them two elected houses. The offending constitution was returned and in 1855, a new Legislative Council was elected with a mandate to establish something far more radical and democratic than had been seen in the British Empire before.
This was expressed by the &quot;Constitution Act 1856&quot; (headed &quot;1855–6: No. 2&quot; and followed by the long title &quot;An Act to establish a Constitution for South Australia, and to grant a Civil List to Her Majesty&quot;) establishing the constitution of the Parliament of the Province of South Australia.

===Responsible government===

This Constitution Act provided for a bicameral parliament with full authority to enact laws, apart from a few Acts requiring the monarch&#x27;s personal Royal Assent. The 18-member Legislative Council was elected by property owners only, while the 36-member House of Assembly was elected by a full male franchise. The Act also provided for a system of responsible government, where the members of the executive branch must sit in parliament and, by convention, can only remain in office while they hold the confidence of a majority of the members of the House of Assembly. It was the first Constitution in the Australian colonies to provide &quot;manhood&quot; suffrage. The adoption of the &quot;one man, one vote&quot; principle also removed the ability of voters to vote in any electorate in which they owned property. The Act also defined the rules of tenure for the parliamentarians.

Later in 1856, in preparation for responsible government, the old Legislative Council passed an Electoral Act providing for the secret ballot system of voting to be used for the new parliament, also known as the Australian Ballot.

The first bicameral parliament of South Australia was elected on 9 March 1857, with Boyle Travers Finniss as the inaugural Premier of South Australia responsible to parliament. The parliament first sat on 22 April 1857.

Until 1887, membership of parliament was an unpaid position as members were expected to be able to support themselves through other means. This changed with the passage of the &quot;Payment of Members Act 1887&quot; that set an annual salary of 200 pounds for members of both Houses who were not ministers. This rate has subsequently continued to evolve with the rate now set by an independent remuneration tribunal.

In 1889, the House of Assembly moved out of the original Parliament House and took up residence in a new building constructed next door. Due to costs, this &quot;New Parliament House&quot; would remain unfinished for 50 years while the Legislative Council continued to be housed in the original Parliament House.

Women gained the right to vote and stand for election in 1895, taking effect at the 1896 election. Once passed, South Australia become the fourth state in the world to give women the vote and the first to give women the right to be elected to parliament.

===After federation===
South Australia became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, following a vote to federate with the other British colonies of Australia. One consequence of federation was that the powers of the Parliament of South Australia were limited by the provisions of the Constitution of Australia, with some powers transferred to the federal parliament. Another consequence was a bit of a &quot;brain drain&quot;, with many of the parliament&#x27;s most prominent members moving to the federal sphere.

From 1857 to 1933, the House of Assembly was elected from multi-member districts, commonly known as &quot;seats,&quot; with each district returning between one and six members. The size of the Assembly grew during the colonial period—36 members from 1857 to 1875, 46 members from 1875 to 1884, 52 members from 1884 to 1890, 54 members from 1890 to 1902.

In response to the Federation of Australia, the House of Assembly was reduced to 42 members from 1902 to 1912 and 40 members from 1912 to 1915 after the Northern Territory was ceded to federal administration. From 1915 to 1938 the size was again increased to 46 members.

The Legislative Council half of the &quot;New Parliament House&quot; was finally completed in 1939, 50 years after the House of Assembly portion of the building.

===Playmander years===

One distinctive aspect of the history of the South Australian parliament was the &quot;Playmander&quot;, a gerrymandering system that instituted a pro-rural electoral malapportionment introduced by the incumbent Liberal and Country League (LCL) government, and in place for 32 years from 1936 to 1968. The already entrenched rural overweighting was increased to a 2:1 ratio, the number of MPs was reduced to 39 and the multi-member seats were abandoned for single-member seats. The House of Assembly now consisted of 26 low-population rural seats, which due to population shifts, were holding up to a 10-to-1 advantage over the 13 high-population metropolitan seats, even though rural seats contained only a third of South Australia&#x27;s population. At the peak of the malapportionment in 1968, the rural seat of Frome had 4,500 formal votes, while the metropolitan seat of Enfield had 42,000 formal votes.

Labor managed to win enough parliamentary seats to form government just once during the Playmander against the odds − in 1965. Labor won comprehensive majorities of the statewide two-party vote whilst failing to form government in 1944, 1953, 1962 and 1968.

More equitable boundaries were subsequently put in place following the 1968 (with the House increased to 47 members), 1975, and 1989 elections. Since 1975, the distribution of the 47 electoral boundaries has been set by the South Australian Electoral Districts Boundaries Commission, an independent body. Since a referendum in 1991, boundaries have been redistributed after each election. Previously they were redistributed after every third election. There are currently 34 in the Adelaide metropolitan area and 13 in rural areas. These seats are intended to represent approximately the same population in each electorate.

===Evolution of the Legislative Council===

The Legislative Council&#x27;s numbers and electoral makeup have also varied over time. From the inception of responsible government to 1882, it had 18 members elected by a single colony-wide district, with the scheme originally set up so that 6 members would be elected every 4 years to serve a 12 year term. In 1882, the single colony-wide district was split into 4 electoral districts which were drawn with a heavy bias in favour of rural areas in place. The new scheme was set up so that half of the Council was being elected each election. Originally these electoral districts were the &quot;Central District&quot;, the &quot;Southern District&quot;, the &quot;North-Eastern District&quot; and the &quot;Northern District&quot;, with each being represented by 6 members each. From 1902, the Central District continued to be represented by 6 members, while the rural districts were reduced to 4 members each. The North-Eastern District was replaced by the &quot;Midland District&quot; from the 1910 election and in 1915 the Central District was split in half and became the &quot;Cantral District No. 1&quot; and the &quot;Central District No. 2&quot;, each being represented by 4 members.

As for the size of the Council as a whole, from 1882 until 1902 it had 24 members; until 1915, 18 members; and until 1975, 20 members.

From 1975, the Council size was increased to 22 members, with half (11) to be elected at each election by the entire state voting as one electorate.

Although the lower house had universal suffrage from 1895, the upper house, the Legislative Council, remained the domain of property owners until the Labor government of Don Dunstan managed to achieve reform of the chamber in 1973.

Under the original 1856 Constitution, the franchise was restricted to men, &quot;having a freehold estate in possession, either legal or equitable, situate within the said Province, of the clear value of Fifty Pounds sterling money above all charges and encumbrances affecting the same, or having a leasehold estate in possession, situate within the said Province, the lease thereof having been registered in the General Registry Office, for the registration of deeds, and having three years to run at the time of voting, or containing a clause authorising the lessee to become the purchaser of the land thereby demised, or occupy a dwelling house of the clear annual value of Twenty-five Pounds sterling money.&quot;

In 1907, the right to vote was extended to any person occupying a dwelling house, or &quot;dwelling house and premises appurtenant thereto&quot;, with an annual rent of at least 17 pounds per annum (excluding any payment of rent by a wife to her husband); to a registered proprietor of a leasehold on which there were improvements to the value of at least 50 pounds and which were the property of the proprietor. At the same time, the franchise was also extended to ministers of religion, school head teachers, postmasters, railway stationmasters, and the officer in charge of a police station.

A further extension of the franchise came in 1913, when the qualification of an occupier of a dwelling house was altered to include any inhabitant occupier, whether owner or tenant.

In 1918, the right to vote for members of the upper house was extended to all those who had served in armed forced in the First World War. This was subsequently extended to Second World War veterans in 1940 and in 1969, it was simplified to apply to all Australian war veterans regardless of the war they served in.

In 1969, the franchise was granted to any person who owned or rented property, regardless of the value of the property. Further, the franchise was extended to the wedded spouse of the owner or renter.

Finally in 1973, all property qualifications were removed and the Council became a body elected via proportional representation by a single state-wide electorate from the same universal franchise as the House of Assembly. Since the following 1975 South Australian state election, no one party has had control of the state&#x27;s upper house with the balance of power controlled by a variety of minor parties and independents.

===Electoral systems===
Originally, the electoral system for both houses was a form of plurality voting, where each voter is given as many votes as there are candidates to be elected. From 1929, this was changed to instant-runoff voting, with multi-member districts using the preferential block voting variant of the system. In 1973, as part of the reforms to the upper house, the Legislative Council switched to using a party list form of proportional representation voting that was subsequently changed to the single transferable vote in 1982. From 1985 until 2017, the Legislative Council also used a form of Group voting tickets similar to that used in the Senate at the time. This enabled voters to choose between voting &#x27;above the line&#x27; (for a single party preference ticket that ranked all candidates on the ballot paper in the party&#x27;s preferred order) or &#x27;below the line&#x27; and number all candidates in order of preference, on the ballot paper. In 2017 this was changed to a form of optional preferential voting − instructions for above the line votes are to mark &#x27;1&#x27; and then further preferences are optional as opposed to preference flows from simply &#x27;1&#x27; above the line being determined by group voting tickets, while instructions for voters who instead opt to vote below the line are to provide at least 12 preferences as opposed to having to number all candidates, and with a savings provision to admit ballot papers which indicate at least 6 below the line preferences.

Today, the House of Assembly continues to use instant-runoff voting with compulsory preferences.

Compulsory voting was introduced for the House of Assembly in 1942 and for the Legislative Council in 1985.

Elections were held every 3 years until 1985 (with a brief flirtation with 5 year terms for the House of Assembly in the 1933-1938 parliament), when the parliament switched to 4 year terms, meaning 8 year terms for the upper house. Beginning in 2006, election dates have been fixed at the third Saturday in March of every fourth year.

==House of Assembly==


The House of Assembly (or &quot;lower house&quot;) is made up of 47 members who are each elected by the full-preference instant-runoff voting system in single-member electorates. Each of the 47 electoral districts (electorates) contains approximately the same number of voters. Casual vacancies, when a member retires or dies in office mid-term, are filled by a by-election in that member&#x27;s district.

Since 1975, the distribution of electoral boundaries has been set by the South Australian Electoral Districts Boundaries Commission, an independent body. Since a referendum in 1991, boundaries have been redistributed after each election. Previously they were redistributed after every third election.

Government is formed in the House of Assembly by the leader of the party or coalition who can demonstrate they have the support of the majority of the House, and is called upon by the Governor to form government. The leader of the government becomes the Premier. The House is presided over by a Speaker, who, as of the passage of the &quot;Constitution (Independent Speaker) Amendment Act 2021&quot;, is constitutionally banned from being a member of a registered political party outside of a &quot;relevant election period&quot;.

While South Australia&#x27;s total population is 1.7 million, Adelaide&#x27;s population is 1.3 million − uniquely, over 75 percent of the state&#x27;s population resides in the metropolitan area and has 72 percent of seats (34 of 47) alongside a lack of comparatively-sized rural population centres, therefore the metropolitan area tends to decide election outcomes. At the 2014 election for example, although the statewide two-party vote (2PP) was 47.0% Labor v 53.0% Liberal, the metropolitan area recorded a 2PP of 51.5% Labor v 48.5% Liberal.

The term for the House of Assembly is a fixed 4-year term but the state Constitution does allow the Governor to dissolve the House early and call for a fresh general election under certain circumstances. These are: If the House passes a motion of no confidence in the government, the House defeats a motion of confidence in the government, or if a bill that has been designated by the House as a &quot;bill of special importance&quot; is passed by the House of Assembly but is rejected by the Legislative Council. The House of Assembly can also be dissolved early together with the full Legislative Council in what is known as a double dissolution in order to resolve deadlocks between the two Houses. The circumstances for such a double dissolution are outlined below.

==Legislative Council==


The Legislative Council (or &quot;upper house&quot;) is made up of 22 councillors (MLCs) who are elected for the entire state by the Proportional Representation single transferable voting system (with optional preferential voting) to serve for a term that is usually 8 years. Elections for the Legislative Council are staggered so that 11 seats are up for re-election every 4 years, at the same time as House of Assembly elections. Legislative Councillors may serve shorter or longer terms than the usual 8 years in the event of an early dissolution of the House of Assembly. If half the chamber has served at least 6 years at the time of a dissolution, then they go up for election, but if all Legislative Councillors have served less than 6 years, only the House of Assembly faces the people.

In the event of a casual vacancy, members of the Legislative Council are filled by an assembly of the members of both houses of parliament. If the member whose seat has become vacant was elected as a member of a political party, the assembly must, if possible, replace them with a nominated member of that party.

The Legislative Council has almost equal powers to the House of Assembly. The only difference is that the upper house does not have the ability to initiate or amend bills that appropriate money or levy taxes. The Council may still request amendments to these bills and retains the right to reject money bills that it disagrees with.

The primary function of the Legislative Council is to review legislation which has been passed by the House of Assembly. This can cause tensions between the government and the Legislative Council, which may be viewed by the former as obstructionist if it rejects key legislation, as can happen at times when the electoral makeup of the two Houses are different. Another important function of the upper house is to scrutinise government activity, which it does both in the chamber and through committees. As Legislative Councillors have been elected using proportional representation since the mid-1970s, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. A government or opposition majority in the upper house has been unachievable since the introduction of this system, with the balance of power being held by a number of minor parties and independents.

==Resolution of deadlocks between the Houses==

In the event that there is a conflict between the two Houses over legislation, the South Australian Constitution lays out a mechanism for how these deadlocks can be resolved.

Under section 41 of the South Australian Constitution, if a bill is passed by the House of Assembly during a session of parliament and in the following parliament after a general election for the lower house is rejected by the Legislative Council on both occasions, it is permitted for the Governor of South Australia to either issue a writ for the election of 2 additional members of the Legislative Council or to dissolve both Houses at the same time to elect an entirely new parliament. This procedure is known as a double dissolution. As the upper house consists of 22 members, with 11 elected statewide at each general election for an 8-year term at a quota of 8.33%, this would result in an election for all 22 members at a quota of 4.35%. In the event of a double dissolution election, the 11 Legislative Councillors that would not have won their seats under an ordinary election go up for re-election at the first general election after only serving 3 years, rather than the usual 6 years.

Although it has been threatened, this South Australian double dissolution procedure has never been used.

Although the practice has mostly fallen out of favour in other parliaments that use a bicameral Westminster system, the South Australian parliament still regularly appoints a &quot;Conference of Managers&quot; from each House to negotiate compromises on disputed bills in private. The Conference Managers then prepare a report of recommendations that is submitted to both Houses.

==State First Nations Voice==
As of the passage of the &quot;First Nations Voice Act 2023&quot; in March 2023, South Australia also has an Indigenous Voice to Parliament able to represent South Australia&#x27;s indigenous population to the state parliament and government. The Act was launched in a ceremony led by premier Peter Malinauskas, who acknowledged the work done by Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister Kyam Maher, and First Nations Commissioner Dale Agius, to achieve the passing of the bill. A large crowd attended despite rainy weather, and Major &quot;Moogy&quot; Sumner spoke, danced, and performed the Welcome to Country.

The state is divided into six regions, whose Indigenous voters will, at each state election, elect a &quot;Local Voice&quot; with gender parity. These local voices then elect one male and one female member each to be their joint presiding officers and sit on the &quot;State First Nations Voice&quot;. The State Voice then in turn elects its own male and female joint presiding officers who have the right to enter either house of parliament to make speeches on bills that are of interest to Indigenous peoples in South Australia. They do not have the ability to vote on legislation. The State Voice can also address state cabinet and government departments.

==Location==

The seat of the Parliament of South Australia is Parliament House in the state capital of Adelaide. Parliament House sits on the North-Western corner of the intersection of King William Street and North Terrace. It was built to replace the adjacent and overcrowded Parliament House, now referred to as &quot;Old Parliament House&quot;, which dated from 1843 with extensions in 1857. Due to financial constraints, the current Parliament House was constructed in stages over 65 years from 1874 to 1939.

Following the completion of the New Parliament House in 1939, The Old Parliament House has been used for a variety of functions including as a Royal Australian Air Force recruiting office, offices for government departments and as a &quot;Constitutional Museum.&quot; In 1995, the building reverted to use by the parliament and has been used as offices and committee rooms ever since.

<text>Kevin Yagher (born June 23, 1962) is an American special effects technician, known for Freddy Krueger&#x27;s makeup and The Crypt Keeper creature.

==Career==
His company, Kevin Yagher Productions, has created effects for &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot;, &quot;Face/Off&quot;, &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;, &quot;Volcano&quot;, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot;, &quot;Radio Flyer&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot;. Yagher&#x27;s other credits include &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, and &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, where he met his wife, Catherine Hicks.

He is the designer and executor of the Chucky doll. Yagher frequently collaborated with puppeteer Brock Winkless on his productions. For example, Winkless performed the puppetry for Chucky in &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; and several of its sequels. Yagher and Winkless also worked closely on the visual effects of &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot; (1992).

Yagher directed &quot;&quot;, but decided to be credited as Alan Smithee after Dimension Films re-edited the film. He heads Kevin Yagher Productions, Inc.

Yagher has worked with &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic on a number of occasions. In 1988, Yagher created a fat suit and appliance makeup for Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;Fat&quot; video, which Yankovic later wore in his concerts while performing the song. A year later, Yagher created prosthetics that gave Yankovic a hypermuscular upper body when parodying Rambo in his film &quot;UHF&quot;.

==Personal life==
He was married to actress Catherine Hicks on May 19, 1990. The two have a daughter, Caitlin, who was born in 1992. He is a diabetic. He has two brothers: actor Jeff Yagher and special makeup effects artist Chris Yagher.

<doc id="1262569" wikidata="Q173293" url="?curid=1262569" title="Andrea Moda Formula">
<text>Andrea Moda Formula was a Formula One team that competed during the 1992 Formula One World Championship. The team was owned by Italian shoe designer Andrea Sassetti, who named the team after his company. The team contested nine races but managed to only qualify for one. Statistically, and by general perception, Andrea Moda is widely considered to be one of the poorest constructors to ever enter Formula One.

==Origins==
In September 1991, Sassetti bought the Coloni F1 team after it had failed to pre-qualify a car for every single race that year. Coloni&#x27;s four-year history resulted in 14 starts in 82 attempts. The team had not qualified for a Grand Prix in over two years, having not competed in a race since Roberto Moreno started 15th at the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix. Coloni&#x27;s best finish was 8th place, scored by Gabriele Tarquini in the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix.

The team hired a number of ex-Coloni staff and a deal was sought with Simtek to run a car that had been designed in 1990 for BMW. Now named the Andrea Moda S921 the chassis was fitted with Judd V10 engines, but the cars were not ready for the start of the season.

==1992 season==
For the season-opening round in South Africa, Sassetti arrived with a modified Coloni C4B chassis for drivers Alex Caffi and Enrico Bertaggia. The team was excluded from the event for not having paid the $100,000 deposit for new teams in the World Championship, Sassetti arguing that it was not a new team as he had simply taken over the Coloni team and not formed a new one but, since Sassetti neglected to buy Coloni&#x27;s entry to the Championship along with the team itself, the FIA were unmoved. Caffi performed a few reconnaissance laps in the Thursday familiarization session (arranged as the revised Kyalami circuit was new to all the teams) but did not participate in any official free practice or qualifying sessions. In Mexico, the team arrived with all its equipment but the cars were still being built and neither ran.

Following this both Caffi and Bertaggia were dropped for criticizing the team&#x27;s preparation, with Andrea Moda arriving at the Brazilian Grand Prix with the experienced Roberto Moreno and Perry McCarthy (who had previously tested for Williams and would later gain fame as The Stig on the BBC&#x27;s motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot;) nominated as the drivers. While Moreno gave the S921 its first competitive run (failing to pre-qualify), McCarthy was refused a Super Licence and did not run. McCarthy finally received his Super Licence for the following round in Spain, but the car only made it a short distance down the pitlane before expiring. Moreno was again unable to pre-qualify. Around this time Bertaggia approached the team again, having found $1 million in sponsorship funds. Sassetti wanted him to return in place of McCarthy but the FIA blocked any further driver changes after the team&#x27;s earlier shenanigans. Bitter at the loss of funding, Sassetti began to ignore McCarthy&#x27;s entry and concentrated the team&#x27;s resources on Moreno.
At the Monaco Grand Prix, McCarthy&#x27;s car was eliminated in pre-qualifying with an official lap time of 17:05.924. Moreno, meanwhile, successfully navigated both pre-qualifying and then qualifying to start the Monaco Grand Prix from 26th on the grid with a 20th on the grid after the first qualifying session on Thursday, retiring after 11 laps with an engine failure. After this progress the team ran into problems which some thought were bad luck and others down to basic disorganisation. In Canada the team was without engines because Sassetti had failed to pay Judd. A motor was borrowed from Brabham allowing Moreno to perform a few laps but he failed to pre-qualify while McCarthy was once again unable to run. Many people had left the team by this stage and the operation missed the French Grand Prix entirely because its truck was stuck in one of the blockades by French truck drivers; every other team had successfully negotiated the blockades. At this point the few sponsors the team had withdrew, leaving Sassetti reluctantly funding the team himself. By now the second car nominally being used by McCarthy was effectively a spare for Moreno and the Brit was receiving ever poorer treatment from the team - at his home race he was sent out on wet weather tyres on a dry track and at the Hungaroring he was only allowed out of the pitlane 45 seconds from the end of the pre-qualifying session making it impossible for him to set a lap time. At this point, Andrea Moda was warned to make a meaningful attempt to run McCarthy&#x27;s car as a second team entry, or its exclusion from the sport would be considered.

For the Belgian Grand Prix in late August, both Andrea Moda cars were guaranteed entry into qualifying, because Brabham had withdrawn. This reduced the entry list to 30 cars, eliminating the need for a pre-qualifying session. In qualifying, the Andrea Moda cars were the slowest two on track, with Moreno 13% slower than pole, and McCarthy, who suffered an accident in his session, 22% slower than pole; neither qualified to race. In the same weekend, Sassetti was arrested in the paddock for allegedly forging auto part invoices.

The FIA World Motor Sport Council expelled Andrea Moda Formula for the remainder of the 1992 season a week later, on September 8, on the regulatory grounds of &quot;[failure to operate a] team in a manner compatible with the standards of the championship or in any way brings the championship into disrepute.&quot; Following the decision, the team was refused entry into Monza&#x27;s paddock for the Italian Grand Prix.

The Andrea Moda name would later then move to CART, sponsoring Euromotorsport in 1993.

==Docufilm==

In October 2023, the docufilm, entitled &quot;Last and Furious - The true story of the Andrea Moda Formula&quot;, on the events of this team, was presented at the 80th Venice International Film Festival.

<doc id="1262571" wikidata="Q424424" url="?curid=1262571" title="Diazo">
<text>In organic chemistry, the diazo group is an organic moiety consisting of two linked nitrogen atoms at the terminal position. Overall charge-neutral organic compounds containing the diazo group bound to a carbon atom are called diazo compounds or diazoalkanes and are described by the general structural formula . The simplest example of a diazo compound is diazomethane, . Diazo compounds () should not be confused with azo compounds () or with diazonium compounds ().

== Structure ==
The electronic structure of diazo compounds is characterized by π electron density delocalized over the α-carbon and two nitrogen atoms, along with an orthogonal π system with electron density delocalized over only the terminal nitrogen atoms. Because all octet rule-satisfying resonance forms of diazo compounds have formal charges, they are members of a class of compounds known as 1,3-dipoles. Some of the most stable diazo compounds are α-diazo-β-diketones and α-diazo-β-diesters, in which the electron density is further delocalized into an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. In contrast, most diazoalkanes without electron-withdrawing substituents, including diazomethane itself, are explosive. A commercially relevant diazo compound is ethyl diazoacetate (N2CHCOOEt). A group of isomeric compounds with only few similar properties are the diazirines, where the carbon and two nitrogens are linked as a ring.

Four resonance structures can be drawn:

Compounds with the diazo moiety should be distinguished from &quot;diazonium&quot; compounds, which have the same terminal azo group but bear an overall positive charge, and &quot;azo&quot; compounds in which the azo group bridges two organic substituents.

== History ==
Diazo compounds were first produced by Peter Griess who had discovered a versatile new chemical reaction, as detailed in his 1858 paper &quot;Preliminary notice on the influence of nitrous acid on aminonitro- and aminodinitrophenol.&quot;

== Synthesis ==
Several methods exist for the preparation of diazo compounds.

=== From amines ===
Alpha-acceptor-substituted primary aliphatic amines R-CH2-NH2 (R = COOR, CN, CHO, COR) react with nitrous acid to generate the diazo compound.

=== From diazomethyl compounds ===
An example of an electrophilic substitution using a diazomethyl compound is that of a reaction between an acyl halide and diazomethane, for example the first step in the Arndt-Eistert synthesis.

=== By diazo transfer ===
In diazo transfer certain carbon acids react with tosyl azide in the presence of a weak base like triethylamine or DBU. The byproduct is the corresponding tosylamide (&quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonamide). This reaction is also called the Regitz diazo transfer. Examples are the synthesis of tert-butyl diazoacetate and diazomalonate. Methyl phenyldiazoacetate is generated in this way by treating methyl phenylacetate with p-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide in the presence of base.

The mechanism involves attack of the enolate at the terminal nitrogen, proton transfer, and expulsion of the anion of the sulfonamide. Use of the β-carbonyl aldehyde leads to a deformylative variant of the Regitz transfer, which is useful for the preparation of diazo compounds stabilized by only one carbonyl group.
=== From &quot;N&quot;-alkyl-&quot;N&quot;-nitroso compounds ===
Diazo compounds can be obtained in an elimination reaction of &quot;N&quot;-alkyl-&quot;N&quot;-nitroso compounds, such as in the synthesis of diazomethane from Diazald or MNNG:
:

(The mechanism shown here is one possibility. For an alternative mechanism for the analogous formation of diazomethane from an &quot;N-&quot;nitrososulfonamide, see the page on Diazald.)

=== From hydrazones ===
Hydrazones are oxidized (dehydrogenation) for example with silver oxide or mercury oxide for example the synthesis of from acetone hydrazone. Other oxidizing reagents are lead tetraacetate, manganese dioxide and the Swern reagent. Tosyl hydrazones RRC=N-NHTs are reacted with base for example triethylamine in the synthesis of crotyl diazoacetate and in the synthesis of phenyldiazomethane from PhCHNHTs and sodium methoxide.

Reaction of a carbonyl group with the hydrazine 1,2-bis(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)hydrazine to form the hydrazone is followed by reaction with the iodane difluoroiodobenzene yields the diazo compound:

=== From azides ===
One method is described for the synthesis of diazo compounds from azides using phosphines:

== Reactions ==

=== In cycloadditions ===
Diazo compounds react as 1,3-dipoles in diazoalkane 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions.

=== As carbene precursors ===
Diazo compounds are used as precursors to carbenes, which are generated by thermolysis or photolysis, for example in the Wolff rearrangement. (In this regard, they resemble diazirenes.) As such they are used in cyclopropanation for example in the reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with styrene. Certain diazo compounds can couple to form alkenes in a formal carbene dimerization reaction.

Diazo compounds are intermediates in the Bamford–Stevens reaction of tosylhydrazones to alkenes, again with a carbene intermediate:

In the Doyle–Kirmse reaction, certain diazo compounds react with allyl sulfides to the homoallyl sulfide. Intramolecular reactions of diazocarbonyl compounds provide access to cyclopropanes. In the Buchner ring expansion, diazo compounds react with aromatic rings with ring-expansion.

=== As nucleophile ===
The Buchner-Curtius-Schlotterbeck reaction yields ketones from aldehydes and aliphatic diazo compounds:
The reaction type is nucleophilic addition.

== Occurrence in nature ==
Several families of naturally occurring products feature the diazo group. The kinamycins and lomaiviticin are DNA intercalation, with diazo functionality as their &quot;warheads&quot;. In the presence of a reducing agent, loss of N2 occurs to generate a DNA-cleaving fluorenyl radical.

One biochemical process for diazo formation is the -aspartate-nitro-succinate (ANS) pathway. It involves a sequence of enzyme-mediated redox reactions to generate nitrite by way of a nitrosuccinic acid intermediate. This pathway appears to be active in several different &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species, and homologous genes appear widespread in actinobacteria.

<text>Bellasi is a Swiss-Italian motorsport company specialized in manufacturing composite parts for racing cars. From 1970 to 1971 it was a Formula One constructor. They participated in six grands prix, entering a total of six cars.

Guglielmo Bellasi was one of several car manufacturers to try to establish themselves in Italian Formula 3 circles in the late 1960s. The first Bellasi F3 car appeared in 1966, entered by Scuderia Inter Corse and driven by Guglielmo Bellasi himself. This Ford-engined machine clearly had some potential as it finished third in the Circuito del Lago di Garda race a month later. Bellasi F3 cars appeared again in 1967 with Bellasi and Sandro Angeleri driving on occasional outings, but there was a more concerted effort in 1968 with Scuderia Jolly Club running as many as four cars for Angeleri, Pino Mariella, Franco Conti and others. The best result was a fifth place for Mariella in the Coppa Autodromo at Monza. Similar cars continued to be seen in 1969 with Georges Ferreira, Pino Pica and Giorgio Pianta among the drivers. One odd feature of the 1969 car was a rear-mounted water radiator, with the coolant warmed by the exhaust.

For 1970 Swiss racer Silvio Moser commissioned Bellasi to design a Grand Prix car for him. This Cosworth-powered device (using some components from the Brabham BT24-3 Moser had raced for the Silvio Moser Racing Team SA) featured a simple riveted aluminium monocoque with tubular sub-frame carrying the radiator and front suspension. The Bellasi was ready for the Dutch Grand Prix in June but failed to qualify there and again in France. The team did not bother to go to Britain because there was no starting money and there was another failure to qualify in Germany before Moser finally made it onto the grid at the 1970 Austrian Grand Prix. The car lasted 13 laps before breaking down and at Monza it was back to non-qualification. The car reappeared for the non-championship Argentine Grand Prix in 1971, entered by the Jolly Club. In September the car was entered again at the 1971 Italian Grand Prix and qualified but retired after only five laps.

<doc id="1262579" wikidata="Q172148" url="?curid=1262579" title="British Racing Partnership">
<text>British Racing Partnership (BRP) was a racing team, and latterly constructor, from the United Kingdom. It was established by Alfred Moss and Ken Gregory – Stirling Moss&#x27;s father and former manager, respectively – in 1957 to run cars for Stirling, when not under contract with other firms, along with other up-and-coming drivers.

==History==

BRP ran a Cooper-Borgward Formula Two car and occasionally a BRM Formula One car in 1959, the latter being demolished in a spectacular crash at the Avus street circuit. BRP was the first Formula One team to sell the entire identity of the team in return for sponsorship income; they were sponsored by the Yeoman Credit Ltd. hire-purchase company from August 1959 and became Yeoman Credit Racing for the season. BRP was given a sum of £40,000 just to buy their equipment plus £20,000/year to operate the team. The team ran Coopers in both Formula One and Formula Two during 1960, with mixed success. During this time two of the team&#x27;s drivers were killed while racing their cars, and the Yeoman Credit management became concerned that the team was not generating solely positive publicity for their company. The Yeoman Credit deal was passed to Reg Parnell Racing at the end of the year, and for the and seasons BRP was renamed UDT Laystall Racing, as part of a new, similar sponsorship deal. UDT was United Dominions Trust, who among various holdings owned Laystall Engineering, the principal supplier of crankshafts to the British automotive and aviation industries.
For , the team reverted to its original name and became a true constructor; they had been running Lotus 24s and Cooper T51s for the previous few seasons, and had tried to acquire the more modern, monocoque Lotus 25 without success. This caused chief designer, Tony Robinson, to design his own monocoque car, patterned very closely after the Lotus 25, but with a thicker skin and running a BRM V8 rather than the typical Coventry Climax engine run in the Lotus 25. This car is commonly referred to as the BRP-BRM and was raced by Innes Ireland and Trevor Taylor.

As a constructor, BRP took part in 13 Grand Prix rounds, scoring a total of 11 championship points. After the team was forced to withdraw from F1 when BRP were denied membership of the Formula 1 Constructors Association which effectively deprived them of start money, then a significant factor in a team&#x27;s income. Instead, BRP was hired by Masten Gregory&#x27;s stepfather George Bryant to build two cars for the 1965 Indianapolis 500, but enjoyed little success.

<doc id="1262581" wikidata="Q1093218" url="?curid=1262581" title="Cisitalia">
<text>Cisitalia was an Italian sports and racing car brand named after &quot;Compagnia Industriale Sportiva Italia&quot;, a business conglomerate founded in Turin in 1946 by industrialist and sportsman Piero Dusio. One of the most memorable cars manufactured by the company was the 202 GT from 1946, which earned praise for its design and sold about 170 units.

==Selected models==
===D46===
Cisitalia was founded by Piero Dusio in Turin in 1946. The company initially deployed Fiat street car parts as the foundation for their D46. Designed by Dante Giacosa, who had a vast knowledge of Fiat parts as he had designed the 500 Fiat Topolino before WWII, the car featured engine and suspensions from the small Fiat car although substantially modified for racing purposes. Dry sump lubrication and further tweaks considerably increased the engine&#x27;s power to 60-70 bhp. With a spaceframe chassis and weighing under , the car was deemed fit for competing at top level. The D46 made a successful debut in 1946, dominating the voiturette series. A pool of talented drivers, including Tazio Nuvolari, drove the D46 to a few victories, beating more advanced but older racing cars.

===Grand Prix===
The D46&#x27;s success led Dusio to consider a more ambitious project - a single seater, Grand Prix car. Ferdinand Porsche was commissioned to design the car, his work resulting in the highly innovative but technically complex Cisitalia 360. With a mid engined layout and four wheel drive, the Type 360 turned out to be far too expensive for Dusio to build to the extent of almost bankrupting his company.

===202===

Dusio went on to commission some of Europe&#x27;s leading designers to work on his cars. In 1947 Pinin Farina created a chassis with an handcrafted aluminum body. When first launched on the occasion of the Villa d&#x27;Este Gold Cup show in Como, and at the 1947 Paris Motor Show, the two-seat 202GT was regarded as an aesthetic and technical achievement that radically transformed postwar automobile body design. Pinin Farina&#x27;s design was eventually honored by New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art in 1951 in the &quot;Eight Automobiles&quot; exhibition. The Cisitalia was displayed with seven other cars, including the (1930 Mercedes-Benz SS tourer; the 1939 Bentley saloon designed by James Young; the 1939 Talbot-Lago by Figoni teardrop coupé; the 1951 Willys Jeep; the 1937 Cord 812 Custom Beverly Sedan; the 1948 MG TC; and the 1941 Lincoln Continental coupe). The Cisitalia 202 is now part of the MoMA permanent collection. Despite the positive critical reception, the car wasn&#x27;t a commercial success due to its high cost. Only 170 were produced between 1947 and 1952. Most cars were coachbuilt by Pinin Farina, Vignale, and Stabilimenti Farina.

Built following aerodynamic studies developed for racing cars, the Cisitalia is to these days one of the most accomplished examples of single shell coachwork. The hood, body, fenders, and headlights are an integral part of the continuously flowing surface. This was an innovative approach as before the Cisitalia 202, the prevailing philosophy was to treat each part of the body as a separate elements, with one box to house the passengers, another one for the motor, and headlights as appendages. The Cisitalia, in contrast, didn&#x27;t feature sharp edges.
The 202 is featured in the 2011 video game L.A. Noire by Rockstar Games and Team Bondi as a secret car called the Cisitalia Coupe.

====202 MM====

Since the 202 never enjoyed large scale production (all the cars were handmade), the engineering group at Cisitalia, including Carlo Abarth, Dante Giacosa and Giovanni Savonuzzi, created several variants of the 202. Of the more important versions, the SMM Nuvolari Spider, was built and named after a class victory at the 1947 Mille Miglia by famed driver Tazio Nuvolari. It is easily identified by its large rear fins, twin windscreens and the classic Italian red paint scheme.

==== 202 SMM====
For the upcoming 1947 season, Giovanni Savonuzzi, who had designed most of the 202, sketched a coupe for Cisitalia&#x27;s competition car. The design was executed by Stabilimenti Farina upon both chassis #101 and #102. After two coupes had been finished, a spider version, called the SMM for Spider Mille Miglia, was manufactured, adorning all subsequent competition cars bearing the MM designation.

At the 1947 Mille Miglia, the Cisitalia spider driven by Nuvolari led most of the race until troubles ensued with heavy rain falling. In the end, the Cisitalia finished second overall and first in class. To acknowledge Nuvolari&#x27;s efforts, all subsequent competition spiders became known as 202 SMM Nuvolaris.

Stabilimenti Farina continued production of the design for several customers. In total about 20 cars were made very similar to Nuvolari&#x27;s winning car.

<doc id="1262583" wikidata="Q173536" url="?curid=1262583" title="Connaught Engineering">
<text>Connaught Engineering, often referred to simply as Connaught, was a Formula One, Formula Two and other sports car divisions constructor from the United Kingdom. Their cars participated in 18 Grands Prix, entering a total of 52 races with their A, B, and C Type Formula 2 and Formula 1 Grand Prix Cars. They achieved 1 podium and scored 17 championship points. The name &quot;Connaught&quot; is a pun on &quot;Continental Autos&quot;, the garage in Send, Surrey, which specialised in sales and repair of European sports cars such as Bugatti, and where the cars were built.

==History==

In 1950, the first single-seaters, the Formula 2 &quot;A&quot; types, used an engine that was developed by Connaught from the Lea-Francis engine used in their &quot;L&quot; type sports cars. The engine was extensively re-engineered and therefore is truly a Connaught engine. The cars were of conventional construction for the time with drive through a preselector gearbox to a de Dion rear axle. In 1952 and 1953, the Grand Prix races counting towards the World Championship were to Formula 2 rules so drivers of these cars could take part in those events as the table below shows.

Connaught designed a new car for the 2½ litre Formula 1 of 1954 which was to have a rear-mounted Coventry Climax V8 engine (the &quot;Godiva&quot;), but when the engine was not proceeded with, a conventionally arranged &quot;B&quot; type was designed using an Alta engine developed into 2½ litre form. The first cars were built with all-enveloping aerodynamic bodywork but later rebodied conventionally (as the photos below show). In 1955, driving a Connaught in this form, Tony Brooks scored the first win in a Grand Prix by a British driver in a British car since 1923, in a non World Championship race at Syracuse. Thereafter the &quot;B&quot; type has been known as the &quot;Syracuse&quot; Connaught and the name was used for the car presented in the 2004 revival.

In 1962, Jack Fairman attempted to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 in a Connaught race car, but failed to find the necessary speed to make the field.

==Sports cars==
Prior to the single-seat racing cars they built a small number of road going sports cars developed on the Lea-Francis Sports Chassis, which achieved considerable competition success. These were of types L2 and L3, and three examples of the stark Cycle Winged L3/SR Sports Racer. Two sports cars, based on the A Type Formula 2 cars, the ALSRs were also built for competition work.

In 2004, the Connaught name was revived by Connaught Motor Company for their Type D Syracuse and Type D-H hybrid sports cars.

<doc id="1262585" wikidata="Q15242179" url="?curid=1262585" title="Leckhampton, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge">
<text>Since 1961 Leckhampton has been the residential site for postgraduate students of Corpus Christi College of the University of Cambridge, England. It consists of the late-19th-century Leckhampton House, the George Thomson Building, dating from 1964, and several other nearby houses. In 2012, a new, purpose-built accommodation building was built to house additional students. The new building was opened on 14 September 2012 by the College Visitor and Chancellor of the University, David Sainsbury.

The buildings are set off Grange Road in the west of Cambridge amidst large, attractive gardens adjacent to Corpus&#x27;s sports grounds, about fifteen minutes&#x27; walk from the main college site in Trumpington Street. Leckhampton has its own library, dining hall and bar; it forms the social as well as residential centre of Corpus graduate life. It also houses a number of fellows, both visiting and of Corpus.

Removed from the city centre, yet close to many academic buildings including the University Library and the Sidgwick Site, Leckhampton is in a convenient location for graduate students, and was a pioneering development among Cambridge colleges when it was established as a graduate centre. Prior to this, graduate students at Cambridge, long a tiny minority of the student body, had for the most part lived among undergraduates in colleges&#x27; main sites. Corpus&#x27;s response to the rapidly growing number of graduate students in the 1960s was to establish in 1961 at Leckhampton a largely self-contained graduate community, a move which has since been emulated to some extent by many other colleges. Although at least one of these developments went much further than Leckhampton – Clare College&#x27;s graduate site became the independent college of Clare Hall in 1984. Since the separation of Clare and Clare Hall, it is once again unique among the colleges that admit both undergraduates and postgraduates in having a dedicated graduate site.

The interests of Leckhampton are represented by the Warden of Leckhampton, a senior Fellow of the College. The Warden has rooms in Leckhampton House, and hosts a number of social functions at Leckhampton throughout the year. The current Warden is John David Rhodes, who lectures on European and American cinema in the Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages.

==History==

Leckhampton House was designed by the architect William C. Marshall in 1881 for its first inhabitants, Frederic W. H. Myers and Eveleen Tennant. Frederic Myers was a classical scholar, poet, essayist and founder of the Society for Psychical Research. Eveleen Tennant Myers was a talented amateur photographer whose collection is displayed at the National Portrait Gallery, including many photographs of Leckhampton House.

In contrast to Leckhampton House&#x27;s suburban late-Victorianism, the George Thomson Building (named after the Nobel Prize-winning physicist George Paget Thomson, sometime master of the college) is Grade II listed example of postwar modernism, designed by Philip Dowson of Arup Associates. Like other buildings of its kind on University campuses, some have criticised it as unimaginative, boxy and out of place. Others, however, have hailed it as an outstanding example for the period. The other buildings of Leckhampton are late-nineteenth-century houses in the adjacent streets which have been bought by the college over the years and linked to the main buildings and gardens, and a new building opened in September 2012.

<text>The Oxford Internet Institute (OII) serves as a hub for interdisciplinary research, combining social and computer science to explore information, communication, and technology. It is an integral part of the University of Oxford&#x27;s Social Sciences Division in England.

==Overview==
The OII is spread across three locations on St Giles in Oxford, with its main hub at 1 St Giles, owned by Balliol College. This department focuses on exploring digital life to influence Internet research, policy, and usage.

Founded in 2001, the OII explores how the Internet affects lives of people. Since 2021 its director is Professor Victoria Nash.

==Research==
Research at the OII covers a diverse range of topics, with faculty publishing journal articles and books on issues including privacy and security, e-government and e-democracy, virtual economies, smart cities, digital exclusion, digital humanities, online gaming, big data and Internet geography. The OII currently has the following research clusters reflecting the diverse expertise of faculty: 
* Digital Politics and Government 
* Information Governance, and Security
* Social Data Science 
* Connectivity, Inclusion, and Inequality
* Internet Economies 
* Digital Knowledge and Culture 
* Education, Digital Life, and Wellbeing
* Ethics and Philosophy of Information

The research conducted at the OII covers a wide range of topics in Internet studies and the social impact of online technologies. Online politics, online education, social media and mental health, Internet-based collaboration, online dating, digital economy, the geography of the internet, and ethical and legal aspects of online technologies are among the main research topics followed at the Oxford Internet Institute.

===Studies of Wikipedia===
OII has published several studies on Internet geography and Wikipedia. In November 2011, The Guardian Data Blog published maps of geotagged Wikipedia articles written in English, Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, French, Hebrew and Persian. OII researcher Mark Graham led the study and published the results on his blog, &quot;Zero Geography&quot;.

Graham also leads an OII project focused on how new users are perceived, represented, and incorporated into the Wikipedia community.

In 2013, OII researchers led by Taha Yasseri published a study of controversial topics in 10 different language versions of Wikipedia, using data related to &quot;edit wars&quot;.

The OII has also been involved in research on the effects of computational propaganda, the ethics of big data in different contexts, and the political implications of the Internet and social media. It collaborates with other institutions of the University of Oxford such as the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, the Department of Computer Science, and the Oxford Martin School.

In 2020, OII researcher Fabian Stephany and his colleague Hamza Salem published a study on using information-seeking behaviour patterns of Wikipedia users to predict US congressional elections. Their model accurately predicted the election outcome for 31 of 35 states in the 2020 United States Senate elections.

=== Studies of Internet Economics ===
Several researchers at the OII study the digital economy. The OII is home of the Online Labour Index (OLI), the first economic indicator measuring the activity of the global online gig-economy, which was created and is administered by the OII researchers Otto Kässi, Vili Lehdonvirta, and Fabian Stephany. The index is a globally recognised reference for the measurement of the online freelance economy. Since 2021, the Online Labour Index is hosted on a new research hub, the Online Labour Observatory jointly administered by the OII and the International Labour Organisation.

In 2020, OII researchers initiated the CoRisk Index, the first economic indicator of industry risk assessments related to COVID-19.

==Teaching==
Since 2006, the OII has offered a DPhil (doctoral) degree in &quot;Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences.&quot; Since 2009, it has offered a one-year Master of Science (MSc) degree in &quot;Social Science of the Internet&quot;. From 2015, prospective students can apply to study the MSc degree part-time over two years. In addition, the department also runs an annual Summer Doctoral Programme which brings outstanding PhD students to study at the OII for two weeks each July. From 2018, prospective students also have the option to apply for a one-year Master of Science degree in Social Data Science with the related DPhil in Social Data Science available from 2020 onward.

==History==
The Oxford Internet Institute was made possible by a major donation from the Shirley Foundation of over £10m, with public funding totalling over £5m from the Higher Education Funding Council for England.

The idea originated with Derek Wyatt MP and Andrew Graham, then Master-Elect of Balliol. Two Balliol Alumni, who knew Dame Stephanie from The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, persuaded Dame Stephanie to meet Andrew Graham and it was following their meeting that she agreed to give the idea her support.

<text>David Randall Silveria (born September 21, 1972) is an American musician, best known as the original drummer for nu metal band Korn from 1993 until leaving the band in 2006. He then became the drummer for Infinika, which was formed in 2012 and disbanded in 2015.
As of 2019, Silveria was the drummer of a band called Breaking in a Sequence (B.I.A.S).

==History==

=== 1993–2006: Korn ===

Born in San Leandro, California, Silveria was raised in Bakersfield and attended South High School. He was one of the original five members of the nu metal band Korn, alongside Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch, James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer, Reginald &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu, and Jonathan Davis. Korn proceeded to popularize the nu metal subgenre in the music industry, selling over 40 million albums worldwide. Silveria sat out a part of the &quot;Sick and Twisted 2000&quot; and &quot;Summer Sanitarium&quot; tours due to injury, with Mike Bordin from Faith No More filling in on drums. Silveria then returned for the album recording of &quot;Untouchables&quot;, Silveria&#x27;s own explanation for the issue was that he &quot;hits too fucking hard&quot;.

On December 13, 2006, after the tour in support of &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot;, it was announced that Silveria would be going on hiatus, and Jonathan Davis later said Silveria would &quot;probably not&quot; appear on their next album. In 2009, after working with several different temporary drummers, Ray Luzier was announced as the official replacement.

=== 2006–2012: Leaving Korn and hiatus ===
For the first time in three years, Silveria made an appearance, promoting Lil&#x27; Kim in &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;; he also introduced himself as &quot;David Silveria from Korn&quot;. In May 2010, he appeared as a model for Remetee clothing.

====Comments on Korn since leaving====
Since January 2012, Silveria has become vocal about his time in Korn, and has often spoken negatively about the band, its members and in some cases its outspoken fans, during conversations on Korn fansite Kornspace.com. Although he maintains no relationship with his former bandmates, he has stated that he has no hard feelings towards guitarist James Shaffer. However, Silveria has spoken less fondly of singer Jonathan Davis and bassist Reginald Arvizu, such as calling Arvizu a &quot;cowardly little bitch&quot;. Silveria states that his relationship with Korn was flawed due to them not letting him back in the band after his long absence from music. Silveria mentioned during his conversation with fans on Kornspace that he had contacted then-former band member Brian Welch about a Korn reunion tour but Welch refused the offer. Silveria also confirmed his comments that he left Korn due to &quot;negative attitudes&quot; and that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t take it anymore&quot;. He mentioned at that point that he had not spoken with Davis since November 2006. However, after it was announced that original guitarist Welch would be returning to Korn for two shows at Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in 2013, Silveria commented on his Facebook page that he would be open to a reunion if all five original members were involved.

On January 7, 2013, Silveria updated his status on his official Facebook page stating, &#x27;Korn fans need to flood the Korn site telling them Korn isn&#x27;t Korn without the original five!!!&#x27; He then went on to say in a later status that fans should &#x27;Flood Jd&#x27;s and Munkys twitter to bring the original 5 back together&quot; and later commenting that he had &#x27;made contact&#x27;, after which fans began predicting that a full reunion would happen. On January 7, 2013, Welch stated in an interview that &quot;David has really said some crazy things online about personal things and he&#x27;s not in a place where people would really want him around. That happened before I talked with them but I guess the things he said were really crazy. Those guys were in a band together for so long so I don&#x27;t know, but for now it&#x27;s just not going to happen.&quot;

On August 11, 2013, Silveria took to his personal Facebook account to state that &quot;[t]here are a lot of things I did for the band that they don&#x27;t like to admit I did.&quot; He then went on to say in a later post that he blamed the band&#x27;s &quot;cookie cutter&quot; musical direction after &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; for his lack of interest from that point. On August 17, 2013, Silveria responded to the repeated misquoting of his post on Ray Luzier and Korn with &quot;To be clear I am NOT talking bad about Ray. My posts have been about my work with Korn during our early years specifically during our first three records.&quot; Silveria has claimed that he could restore Korn&#x27;s original sound, and says that he would like to have a discussion with the band about their early days, the future of the band and Korn&#x27;s original sound. However, Davis stated on Twitter that &quot;I will never never play with him again&quot; (which appears to be a reference to the title of Korn&#x27;s first single &quot;Never Never&quot; from the album &quot;The Paradigm Shift&quot;).

In February 2015, Silveria stated that he was suing his former bandmates in Korn for money owed after the band declined to allow him back in the group following a lengthy break. According to TMZ, Silveria is suing the other four original band members in an effort to reclaim the money owed to him and his &quot;ownership interest&quot; in the band since his departure. If Silveria is paid what he believes he is owed from the past 9 years, he will dissolve his partnership with the group.

===2012–2015: Infinika===
On January 24, it was announced on YouTube that Silveria was playing drums for the experimental rock band Infinika alongside the founding member of ANYONE (and filmmaker) Riz Story. On January 27, it was confirmed with an article on Blabbermouth.net. Silveria stated that he wished to expand his musical scope with Infinika adding that it was technically the most advanced drumming of his career. On January 30, fan site Kornspace.com confirmed that Silveria had in fact joined the site, with a picture of Silveria holding a Kornspace banner. This confirmed previous comments that had supposedly been made by the drummer on the site earlier that week. Silveria stated that he would be touring with Infinika and that he was looking forward to the release of the first full-length album by the band, &quot;Echoes and Traces&quot;.

On April 2, Infinika released a single and music video via YouTube called &quot;Beautiful World&quot;. The video features footage of Silveria recorded for the Infinika – Promotional Clip. 

The album &quot;Echoes and Traces&quot; was released worldwide in September 2014. It features 14 tracks which vary widely from acoustic to psychedelic metal. Silveria stated that &quot;the direction of the band would be defined by its rich mixture of sounds and unpredictable direction&quot;. Noting the mixed reviews from some Korn fans Silveria stated, &quot;I have no interest in repeating myself. I want to keep expanding my drumming and Infinika allows me to explore the wide range of my drumming&quot;.

On January 24, 2015, Infinika announced the band would be dissolved. The following year, Story claimed on Facebook that Silveria did not perform on &quot;Echoes and Traces&quot;, and that the album had already been completed when &quot;attaching silveria [sic] to it seemed like a good &#x27;business&#x27; move at the time.&quot; Story also stated that Silveria had been kicked out of the band due to political disagreements between the two, including Silveria&#x27;s support for then-President of the United States Donald Trump.

===2016–2018: Leaving Core10 for Breaking in a Sequence (B.I.A.S.)===
Silveria stated he would be joining a band by the name of Core10 on his Facebook page. On May 22, 2018, it was announced that Silveria and everyone else in the band, aside from their two frontmen, had quit the band due to mixed reviews and creative differences. 

Silveria then helped form a new band called Breaking in a Sequence (B.I.A.S) with singer Rich Nguyen, guitarist and vocalist Joe Taback, guitarist Mike Martin, and bassist Chris Dorame. According to &quot;Loudwire&quot;, in July 2022 Silveria decided to step down to spend more time with his family.

<text>Derrington-Francis Racing Team was a short-lived Formula One team from Britain. It was founded by Stirling Moss&#x27; former chief mechanic, Alf Francis, and engine tuner Vic Derrington, acquiring an old Automobili Turismo e Sport Tipo 100 car after the ATS operation had closed in 1963. The car, named the Derrington-Francis ATS after the team&#x27;s founders, featured a spaceframe chassis, a short wheelbase and square-shaped aluminium body panels.

The car made its début in the 1964 Italian Grand Prix, where it was driven by Portuguese driver Mário de Araújo Cabral. Qualifying 19th on the grid, Cabral fought with Peter Revson and Maurice Trintignant for the first part of the race, before an ignition problem forced him to retire on lap 25. Cabral was to have driven the car in future events, but Dan Gurney damaged the single chassis in private testing and the team did not make another race appearance.

<doc id="1262592" wikidata="Q173415" url="?curid=1262592" title="Ensign Racing">
<text>Ensign was a Formula One constructor from Britain. They participated in 133 grands prix, entering a total of 155 cars. Ensign scored 19 championship points and no podium finishes. The best result was a 4th place at the 1981 Brazilian Grand Prix by Marc Surer, who also took fastest lap of the race.
Ensign was founded by Morris Nunn who also carried out design duties during the first two seasons of the team&#x27;s existence. Nunn would later go on to be a prominent chief engineer in the American-based Champ Car series, winning championships with drivers Alex Zanardi and Juan Pablo Montoya in the late 1990s.

==Formula One==
Ensign entered Formula One in , with backing from pay driver, Rikky von Opel. Von Opel had driven for the team in Formula Three in 1972 and won the Lombard North Central, British Formula Three Championship that year. Based upon that success, von Opel commissioned a Formula One chassis. Their first season was not successful, von Opel only finished two races and the team&#x27;s best result that season was 13th at the 1973 British Grand Prix. However, the partnership continued into , but von Opel left after the first race of the season, having been offered a works Brabham drive. He was replaced at Ensign by Vern Schuppan whose only finish was 15th at the Belgian Grand Prix and was later himself replaced by Mike Wilds. Wilds only qualified in America; he finished the race after a pit stop for fuel but was not classified, nine laps behind.

For 1975 Ensign was sponsored by HB Bewaking (a Dutch company) leading them to sign Dutch drivers. Roelof Wunderink and Gijs van Lennep. Wunderink did not have much success, qualifying for three races and finishing one. Gijs van Lennep qualified for all his races and took sixth place in Germany, securing the first points for Ensign in Formula One. Chris Amon also raced for the team in Austria and Italy finishing 12th both times. In 1976 Amon stayed with Ensign having great qualifying results. He qualified third in Sweden and sixth in Britain but only took points in Spain where he finished in fifth place. Patrick Nève replaced Amon in France and Hans Binder replaced Amon in Austria. Jacky Ickx would race the rest of the season for Ensign.

In 1977 Clay Regazzoni raced for Ensign, scoring five points with best finishes of fifth in Italy and America. In 1978 the team entered cars for Danny Ongais and Lamberto Leoni, but Ongais left after two races and Leoni after four races. Jacky Ickx contested the next four races and Derek Daly raced the rest of the season scoring a point in Canada. Also in 1978 Nelson Piquet made his debut in Formula 1 at the German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring driving an Ensign. In 1979 Daly stayed with Ensign but he left after the Monaco Grand Prix and was replaced by Patrick Gaillard. Gaillard only qualified at two out of five races and was replaced by Marc Surer for the final three races of the season.

In 1980 Clay Regazzoni again joined Ensign but at Long Beach Regazzoni&#x27;s brake pedal broke causing him to go straight on at the Queen&#x27;s Hairpin crashing into the parked car of Ricardo Zunino leaving him paralyzed. Tiff Needell raced in Belgium, but failed to qualify for the Monaco Grand Prix. Jan Lammers raced the rest of the season.

Marc Surer raced for Ensign in 1981 and finished in fourth place in Brazil where he also took fastest lap of the race. Surer also finished sixth in Monaco. Eliseo Salazar replaced Surer from Spain onwards. Salazar finished sixth in the Netherlands. In 1982 Roberto Guerrero raced for Ensign. He only finished in two races.

Meanwhile, the team was also involved in the last year of British F1 Championship, winning the championship with the old MN180B cars and Jim Crawford as driver.

After the season, Ensign was merged into the Theodore team, which it had previous ties to via financier Teddy Yip and took that team&#x27;s name. During many seasons, the connection between Ensign and Theodore was so great that in some years they used almost the same car, much as Red Bull Racing has a second but separate team, Toro Rosso, in more recent times.

Ensign driver Roberto Guerrero continued on with the newly merged team for , as did the team&#x27;s main car designer.
The Theodore F1 team did not last the 1983 season, though, and shut down late in the year.

<text>EuroBrun Racing was a Swiss-Italian Formula One constructor based in Senago, Milan, Italy. They participated in 46 Grands Prix between 1988 and 1990, with an Italian license, entering a total of 76 cars.

==Background==
The team was a combination of two outfits – the mechanical manpower and skill of Giampaolo Pavanello&#x27;s &quot;Euroracing&quot; team, who had also run the factory-backed Alfa Romeo Formula One team from 1982–85, and the financial muscle and organisational skill of Swiss slot machine magnate and former touring car driver Walter Brun, who owned and ran the Brun Motorsport sports car team.

==1988==
For the team&#x27;s debut season in , Mario Tolentino designed the ER188 chassis, to be powered by a normally-aspirated 3.5-litre Cosworth DFZ engine. 1987 Formula 3000 champion Stefano Modena and long-time Brun sportscar stalwart Oscar Larrauri were signed to drive. Despite a solid if unspectacular start to the season, EuroBrun were soon struggling as money ran low. There was internal trouble when Brun unsuccessfully tried to replace Larrauri with Christian Danner (the Argentine driver had gained the unwanted reputation among his fellow drivers of being a &#x27;mobile chicane&#x27; in both qualifying and races) and Euroracing were showing disinterest in Formula One. Both drivers failed to qualify at certain events (Modena missing out four times and being excluded from another two races for technical infringements, and Larrauri failing seven times). Modena&#x27;s 11th place at the Hungarian Grand Prix was the team&#x27;s best result of the year.

==1989==
Before the season, Euroracing slimmed down to a nominal level of involvement, in the shape of a handful of engineers and mechanics. EuroBrun scaled back to a single car (being the only team to enter one car that year, as opposed to two) to be driven by Swiss driver Gregor Foitek, while the ER188 was modified slightly to take a Judd V8 engine and Pirelli tyres. The team would only make it through pre-qualifying once, in the opening race of the season in Brazil, and then Foitek failed to qualify. Even the introduction of George Ryton&#x27;s new ER189 for the German Grand Prix did not help. Foitek quit after the Belgian Grand Prix, to be replaced by the returning Larrauri, who was no more successful.

==1990==
Despite failing to start a single race in 1989, the team returned in with two cars once again. Euroracing had now left the partnership altogether and the team started the season with an upgraded version of the ER189 known as the ER189B. Roberto Moreno led the team, with Claudio Langes in the second car. Langes would not make it through pre-qualifying once. A freak qualifying session at the opening race of the season in the United States saw Moreno start 16th on the grid and he eventually finished 13th. The capable Brazilian qualified again in San Marino and came close on other occasions, but as Brun lost enthusiasm, the EuroBruns fell further and further away from the grid. After 14 rounds the team withdrew from the Formula One Championship, having made only 21 starts from 76 entries. In 2021, Moreno claimed that the team purposely did not want to qualify for races so as not to spend funds they did not have on extra tyres and engine rebuilds, stating that the team gave him race-marked tyres to qualify on and the Judd engines went as long as four events without rebuilds.

<doc id="1262596" wikidata="Q171665" url="?curid=1262596" title="Fittipaldi Automotive">
<text>Fittipaldi Automotive, sometimes called Copersucar after its first major sponsor, was a Formula One racing team and constructor that competed from to . It was the only Formula One team to have been based in Brazil. The team was formed during 1974 by racing driver Wilson Fittipaldi and his younger brother, double world champion Emerson, with money from the Brazilian sugar and alcohol cooperative Copersucar. The team raced under a Brazilian licence. Emerson Fittipaldi became a driver for the team in 1976 after leaving McLaren, but was unable to replicate his earlier success with the family-owned team. Future world champion Keke Rosberg took his first podium finish in Formula One with the team.

The team was originally based in the Fittipaldis&#x27; hometown of São Paulo, almost 6,000 miles (10,000 km) away from the centre of the world motor racing industry in the UK, before moving to Reading, UK during 1977. It participated in 119 Grands Prix between 1975 and 1982, entering a total of 156 cars. It achieved three podiums and scored 44 championship points.

==Origins==

In the 1960s the young Fittipaldi brothers, Wilson and Emerson, ran a successful business in their native Brazil building karts and tuning engines. They went on to build customer Formula Vee racing cars and various successful one-off sports cars, including a twin-engined, fibreglass-bodied Volkswagen Beetle, as well as maintaining a car and racing accessories business. They were also race-winning drivers in Brazil and in the late 1960s went to Europe, where they progressed through the junior ranks to reach Formula One, the highest international single seater racing category. The younger brother, Emerson, was the more successful; by 1970 he was driving for the Lotus team in Formula One and won his first world championship in 1972. Wilson drove for the Brabham team in Formula One in 1972 and 1973, scoring a best race finish of fifth place. In late 1973 the brothers decided to start their own Formula One team.

The 1974 season was spent setting up the new team, which was to have a strong Brazilian flavour. Wilson was able to persuade Brazilian sugar and alcohol cooperative Copersucar to sponsor the team. McLaren driver Emerson acted as a consultant to the team. The Copersucar-branded car was designed by Brazilian Richard Divila, who had worked for Fittipaldi Empreendimentos designing Formula Vee cars, and later for the European Formula Two Team Bardahl Fittipaldi, modifying their Lotus and Brabham chassis. National aerospace company Embraer was also involved, supplying materials to the fledgling team and providing wind-tunnel time. Mexican Jo Ramírez was hired as team manager. The team was initially based in Brazil, almost 6,000 miles (10,000 km) away from the United Kingdom, a bold move given the overwhelmingly British nature of Formula One technology from the 1960s onwards. The long and low Copersucar FD01, with bulbous bodywork enclosing the engine and unusual rear-mounted radiators, painted in silver with rainbow markings on the flanks, was unveiled in October 1974 at the Federal Senate in Brasília in the presence of President Ernesto Geisel. Like Brabham&#x27;s BT series of cars (Brabham and Tauranac), the car&#x27;s FD designation reflected the initials of the driver and the designer (Fittipaldi and Divila).

==Racing history==

===Copersucar-Fittipaldi (1975–1977)===

The team, initially known as Copersucar-Fittipaldi, did not have great success in its first racing season in 1975. Wilson crashed in chassis FD01 on lap 13 of their first race, the Argentine Grand Prix, which his brother went on to win in his McLaren. Chassis numbers FD02 and FD03, used for the rest of the year, were the same design as the original car but abandoned most of the original bodywork. Wilson was the sole driver and managed only five finishes, the highest of which was a 10th and last place at the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, and failed to qualify on three occasions. Italian Arturo Merzario did no better when he took over the chassis for his home Grand Prix after Wilson broke two bones in his hand in a practice crash at the Austrian Grand Prix. Despite the lack of success, the tiny team achieved a coup for the following year: Emerson Fittipaldi joined the team from McLaren, with whom he had taken his second Driver&#x27;s Championship in 1974. His brother stepped down from driving to look after the management of the team.

Emerson commented: &quot;I am aware that I will virtually have no chance of winning the world title next season...It will be a very difficult beginning, but I am very enthusiastic and I am certain that with everybody&#x27;s effort we will have the first positive results in the second half of next year. I think that in the medium term of one or two years Brazil will have one of the best Formula One teams in the world.&quot;

Emerson was the team&#x27;s main driver in 1976 although Brazilian Ingo Hoffmann joined him for four races. Fittipaldi qualified the new FD04 fifth for his debut, at Interlagos. In the race, although, he could only finish 13th due to engine problems – a result which was more representative of the rest of the season during which he scored only three points. The qualifying result remained the best the team would ever achieve. The experiment of basing the team in Brazil did not last – it was too far from their engine and gearbox suppliers and did not have the large community of expert component manufacturers available in the UK. Although the first FD04 was built there, future cars would be built at the team&#x27;s established base in Reading, UK, in what would become known as &#x27;motorsport valley&#x27;.

The team continued with the same setup for 1977. Fittipaldi was able to score several 4th and 5th places during the year. Hoffman only appeared twice at the beginning of the year, finishing 7th at the Brazilian Grand Prix. The new F5, liveried in yellow rather than silver, (Divila having left the role of technical director, the &#x27;D&#x27; was dropped from the designation) was introduced mid-season.

===Fittipaldi Automotive (1978–1979)===

While it was not a great success in 1977, in 1978 the F5A, modified to implement the principles of ground effect demonstrated to excellent effect by Lotus, allowed the former World Champion to score several good results. The best of these was a competitive second place, after fighting with Mario Andretti and Gilles Villeneuve, at the team&#x27;s perennial happy hunting ground in Brazil. Fittipaldi finished the year with 17 points and the team, now known as Fittipaldi Automotive, came 7th in the Constructor&#x27;s table – one place ahead of Emerson&#x27;s old team McLaren.

The 1979 season saw the promise of the previous year fade away. Implementing ground effect successfully was becoming crucial to success on the track but understanding of the phenomenon was in its infancy and Ralph Bellamy&#x27;s F6 was a failure on the track. Fittipaldi was again the team&#x27;s only driver, although Alex Ribeiro was run in the non-championship race which inaugurated the Imola circuit that year, before attempting and failing to qualify a car for the end of season North American championship races.

===Skol Fittipaldi Team (1980)===
At the end of 1979 Copersucar decided to end their sponsorship. The team bought the remains of close neighbour Wolf Racing, becoming a two car operation for the first time. The team was renamed Skol Team Fittipaldi for the 1980 season to reflect new sponsorship from Skol Brasil (now an AmBev brand). Emerson and Wolf Racing driver Keke Rosberg raced the first part of the season with reworked Wolf chassis from the previous year. The cars, designated F7s, brought a third place for each of the drivers before being replaced by the less successful F8. The design team that year was headed by Harvey Postlethwaite, another asset gained from Wolf, and also included very young chief aerodynamicist Adrian Newey – both were later designers of championship winning cars for other teams.

===Fittipaldi Automotive (1981–1982)===

Emerson Fittipaldi decided to retire from racing at the end of 1980. He has since said that his last two years in Formula One were very unhappy: &quot;I was too involved in the problems of trying to make the team work, and I neglected my marriage and my personal life&quot;, although at the time he cited colleagues&#x27; deaths as his reason. He was only 33, but had been racing in Formula One for a decade. He had failed to finish seven of the last ten races that year and had several times been outpaced by his Finnish team-mate. He moved into the management of the team and young Brazilian Chico Serra replaced him for 1981. The team, which reverted to the name of Fittipaldi Automotive as Skol sponsorship was lost again, entered a sharp decline from 1981 onwards. Postlethwaite left for Ferrari early in the year and the team once again raced updated variants of the previous season&#x27;s chassis, using tyres from Michelin, Avon and Pirelli – including one race in which the two cars were on different brands. Rosberg did manage to finish a fourth at the non-championship FOCA South African Grand Prix at the start of the year, albeit one lap down on the leaders (&quot;see FISA–FOCA war&quot;), but after that the drivers recorded a succession of DNQs and retirements. When they did finish they were normally at the back of the field and scored no points that year.

The Finn moved to Williams for 1982, where he would win the Drivers Championship. The team continued with a single F8 for Serra – often using a chassis that had raced through most of the 1981 season – and scored a final point from a sixth-place finish at the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder, although only after Niki Lauda had been disqualified. A final new car, the F9, was penned by the returning Divila and Tim Wright and introduced at the British Grand Prix that year, but failed to improve matters. The Fittipaldi brothers attempted to raise funds to continue in 1983, but the team closed its doors early in 1983.

==Aurora Formula One==
A Fittipaldi F5A chassis run by RAM Racing (in the guise of &#x27;Mopar Ultramar Racing Team&#x27;) took the make&#x27;s only race win in the Aurora Formula One championship at the Race of Champions at Brands Hatch on 15 April 1979 in the hands of Guy Edwards, albeit actually 7th on the road behind six cars from the world championship which were not entered in the Aurora series. Edwards and team-mate Bernard de Dryver scored other good results in the series, including a string of podium finishes.

Valentino Musetti, a British stuntman, raced an updated F5B variant in the 1980 Aurora Formula One UK championship, but with less success than the previous year.

==Drivers==

For much of its history Fittipaldi Automotive was entirely focussed around Emerson Fittipaldi. Emerson was a double world champion renowned for a smooth and quick style when he joined the family team. Although his older brother drove in the team&#x27;s first season, the suggestion that Emerson might drive for the team was always in the air and only a year later he cancelled contract discussions with his then team McLaren at a very late stage and signed with Fittipaldi. Although he remained capable of front-running performances, during his time with Fittipaldi Automotive he became an inconsistent performer. On several occasions team manager Jo Ramírez berated his driver after a sudden burst of speed indicated that he had not been driving to his full potential. By 1980 Fittipaldi&#x27;s teammate Keke Rosberg thought him long past his best, and found him demotivated. Emerson retired at the end of that year after five full seasons with the family team, but returned to racing in the CART series in 1984. He won the series championship in 1989, and the Indianapolis 500 in both 1989 and 1993. Emerson&#x27;s CART career came to an end in 1996, after he suffered serious injuries at the Michigan 500.
The young Finn Keke Rosberg was struggling to get into a competitive seat when he joined Fittipaldi for the 1980 season. He had previously driven two disjointed seasons for the Theodore Racing, ATS and Walter Wolf Racing teams but although he had won a non-championship race with Theodore, he had scored no world championship points. Fittipaldi bought the remains of Wolf at the end of 1979. Rosberg reports that Emerson, who had not previously had a full-time teammate while at Fittipaldi Automotive, wanted another Brazilian driver but was persuaded by ex-Wolf employees Peter Warr and Harvey Postlethwaite to offer the number two drive to the Finn. Rosberg himself saw a full season in Formula One with Fittipaldi as a step &quot;towards victory&quot;. He was competitive alongside Emerson during his first season, scoring a podium in his first race with the team, the 1980 Argentine Grand Prix. Rosberg passed Emerson on the track in his second race for the team, and claims that from then on there was friction between Fittipaldi and himself. During his disastrous second season with the team, during which not a single point was scored, Rosberg engineered his release from his contract. He went to Williams, where he would win the drivers world championship the next season.

Other notable Fittipaldi drivers included Wilson Fittipaldi, who drove the lone Fittipaldi car during its maiden season and the future 12-time Brazilian Stock Car champion Ingo Hoffmann, who drove a handful of races as the second entry for the team.

<text>Frazer Nash was a brand of British sports car manufactured from 1922 first by Frazer Nash Limited founded by engineer Archibald Frazer-Nash. On its financial collapse in 1927 a new company, AFN Limited, was incorporated. Control of AFN passed to Harold John Aldington in 1929.

Until the Second World War AFN continued to produce a small number of sports cars badged Frazer Nash incorporating a unique multi-chain transmission. It continued after the war making another 85 sports cars before ending manufacture in 1957. The post-war cars had conventional transmissions.

UK agents for BMW arranged coachwork and made modifications, including badging the cars &quot;Frazer Nash BMW&quot;.

Control of AFN Limited, UK agents for Porsche, passed from the Aldington family to Porsche in 1987.

==History==

===Archie Frazer Nash===
Frazer Nash Limited&#x27;s business was founded in 1922 by Archie Nash. Nash with friend Ron Godfrey had founded and run the GN cyclecar company in 1909 but their partnership split in 1922 and Nash began making his own cars by buying GN components and adding a new body. His new business&#x27;s activities were centred on Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. The first true Frazer Nash was made in 1924. However, Nash, a clever engineer and designer, seemed unable to run a business at a profit. Shareholders in this period even included author Evelyn Waugh. Eventually the faltering business was sold to a new company, AFN Limited, formed in 1927. Profitability did not improve and, with effect from 1 January 1929, H J Aldington was made managing director and Nash was given the post of &#x27;technical adviser&#x27;. Archie Nash managed to keep a small shareholding and as if to confirm the link in 1938 hyphenated his second name to his surname and became Archie Frazer-Nash.

===Aldington brothers===
During 1929 a majority of AFN&#x27;s capital was acquired by Harold Joseph (&quot;Aldy&quot;) Aldington (1902–1976) and AFN&#x27;s operations moved to Isleworth, Middlesex. Thereafter, the business was run by the three Aldington brothers: Aldy, Don and Bill. The other two were Donald Arthur Aldington (1907–1997) and William Henry Aldington (1900–1980). They were all usually referred to by their initials.

Frazer Nash and subsequently AFN produced around 350 of the famous chain drive models between 1924 and 1939.

The last of the family owners/directors was Aldy&#x27;s son, John Taylor (&quot;JT&quot;) Aldington, who sold AFN Ltd to Porsche GB in 1987.

===Frazer Nash BMW===

===Bristol BMW===
In 1946 at the 36th Ordinary General Meeting of the Bristol Aeroplane Company it was announced that its Engine Division had acquired the majority of the shares in AFN Ltd. AFN Ltd produced about 85 more cars from 1948 to 1957. These cars were entirely unrelated to the chain-drive pre-war Frazer Nash but were largely a direct evolution of the sporting BMW 328 mentioned above. 

AFN, as owners of the UK rights to the 328 engine, licensed Bristol to make it against an agreement for its supply to them. Models include the &quot;Le Mans Replica&quot;, the &quot;Mille Miglia&quot;, the &quot;Targa Florio&quot;, the &quot;Le Mans Coupé&quot; and the &quot;Sebring&quot;. Competition successes included a third place at Le Mans (1949) and wins in the Targa Florio in 1951 and the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1952. The post-war cars are very highly prized by collectors.

Formula 2 cars produced by the company contested various races including four Grand Prix events counting towards the 1952 World Championship of Drivers. The cars were driven by Tony Crook and Ken Wharton.

===Porsche===
In 1954 AFN Limited added Porsche cars becoming the official importer for Great Britain in 1956. This lasted until 1965 when Porsche Cars Great Britain was set up. Aldington family members remained on the board of this company until John Aldington sold out to Porsche in 1987.

===Post War Weapons and Multi Market Engineering until now===
Within the 1950s weapons technology grew into a major factor of the company&#x27;s operations. With the well tuned joining of several company parts in the year 1971 the still today existing unit of &quot;Frazer-Nash Consultancy&quot; was born. This moved through multiple hands over time and under the hood of various owners Besitzer: 1990 had a management buyout, 2004 it was moved to Devonport Management Limited which soon got acquired by Babcock International Group plc., 2021 it was taken over by KBR. Starting in 2010 the company opened multiple development and office locations in Australia. For summer 2022 a total staff of about 1000 employees is reported by the web pages of the company. Furthermore a revenue of 101 Million British Pounds (once equal to 186 Million Australian Dollars) for the fiscal year of 2020/2021 got reported.

==Products==

Considering the small number of cars made, the model range is vast and the following is not entirely comprehensive. Cars were all built to order and virtually any combination was possible. Some were rebuilt at the factory as different versions.

===Pre-war models===



===Post-war models===




==Complete World Championship of Drivers results==
Frazer Nash cars participated in four Grands Prix counting towards the World Championship of Drivers. Drivers of Frazer Nash cars scored 3 World Championship points.

All Grand Prix races counting towards the 1952 World Championship were restricted to Formula Two cars.


==World Sportscar Championship==
Frazer Nash placed equal 13th in the 1953 World Sportscar Championship with a Le Mans model having finished sixth in the 1953 RAC Tourist Trophy.

<text>Fry was a Formula Two constructor from the United Kingdom. The team was founded by David Fry and Alec Issigonis, whose previous employer John Parkes at Alvis brought his son Mike Parkes as a development driver. The car, built to Formula 2 specifications, was fitted with a Coventry Climax engine and was constructed with several advanced concepts, featuring a semi-monocoque design, an extreme forward driving position and a shark fin on its rear.

The Fry F2 made its début appearance in June 1958 at Brands Hatch, with Parkes finishing its first race sixth at the Crystal Palace circuit. Appearing in a number of Formula Two events throughout 1958 and 1959, the car was entered for the Formula One 1959 British Grand Prix. Parkes did not qualify for the race, setting the 27th fastest time, and the car was not entered for another World Championship Grand Prix. The car participated in several more races, before the final appearance with a second-place finish at the Brands Hatch Boxing Day event.

<doc id="1262600" wikidata="Q647341" url="?curid=1262600" title="Santos-Dumont 14-bis">
<text>The 14-bis (; (; , approximating &quot;14A&quot;), also known as  (&quot;bird of prey&quot; in French), was a pioneer era, canard-style biplane designed and built by Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont. In 1906, near Paris, the &quot;14-bis&quot; made a manned powered flight that was the first to be publicly witnessed by a crowd and also filmed. It was also the first powered flight by a non-Wright Brothers airplane aside from short powered &quot;hops&quot; by Clément Ader and Traian Vuia.

==Background==
In June 1905, French aviator Gabriel Voisin had flown a glider towed by a fast boat on the river Seine, making a flight of over . The glider&#x27;s wing and tail were made up of Hargrave cells, a box kite-like structure that provided a degree of inherent stability. This established the Hargrave cell as a configuration useful not only for kites but also for heavier-than-air aircraft. Santos-Dumont was living in Paris at the time, and was one of the most active &quot;aeronauts&quot; in Europe, having developed a series of non-rigid airships that displayed unparalleled agility, speed, endurance, and ease of control. Santos-Dumont met Voisin at the end of 1905, and commissioned him to help him construct an aircraft with the intention of attempting to win one of the prizes for heavier-than-air flights offered by the Aéro-Club de France to promote the development of heavier-than-air aviation in France. These included the &quot;Coupe Ernest Archdeacon&quot; prize of a silver trophy and 1500 francs for the first flight of and another prize of 1500 francs for the first flight of .

==Design==
Santos-Dumont supervised construction of a Hargrave-cell biplane powered by an Antoinette engine. The wings, each made up of three cells, were at the back and configured with pronounced dihedral to make the aircraft laterally stable. The Antoinette liquid-cooled, fuel-injected V8 engine was mounted at the extreme rear end of the fuselage, itself located almost vertically equidistant between the biplane wing panels&#x27; wing roots, with the rear-mount engine driving a pusher propeller, and the pilot stood in a wicker basket immediately in front of the engine. A movable boxkite-style cell at the nose, pivoted on a universal joint within it and controlled by cables was intended for yaw and pitch control. This layout would later come to be called a &quot;canard configuration&quot;. It was constructed from bamboo and pine joined by aluminium sockets and was covered with Japanese silk.

==Operational history==
The first trials of the aircraft were made on 22 July 1906 at Santos-Dumont&#x27;s grounds at Neuilly, where it had been assembled. In order to simulate flight conditions, Santos-Dumont attached the aircraft under his latest non-rigid airship, the Number 14, which is why the aircraft came to be known as the &quot;14-bis&quot;. The aircraft was then transported to the grounds of the Château de Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne, where there was more space. The forces imposed by the aircraft pulled dangerously at the airship&#x27;s envelope, nearly tearing it and only allowing limited control. The danger of these tests caused Santos-Dumont and his team to quickly abandon them, although some useful information was obtained that led to adjustments in the balance and weight distribution of the aircraft.

Further trials were made with the aircraft hung from a rope attached to pulleys running along a long steel cable slung between two posts, one high and the other high, much like a zip-line or &quot;tyrolienne&quot; of today.

The first free-flight trials of the &quot;14-bis&quot; took place at the Polo Ground in the Bois de Boulogne on 21 August, but were halted by damage to the newly fitted aluminium-bladed propeller, which replaced one with silk-covered wooden blades. After repairs another trial took place the following day; although the nosewheel left the ground, the aircraft had insufficient power to take off, and Santos-Dumont decided to replace the engine with a Antoinette. Trials resumed on 4 September without great success, and on 7 September, after the propeller was damaged, a new slightly larger one was fitted.

On 13 September 1906 Aéro-Club de France observers gathered to witness an attempt to make a prize-winning flight. The aircraft failed to take off during a first attempt, but during the second it lifted and flew between at an altitude of about . The aircraft then landed in a nose-up attitude, breaking the propeller and bringing an end to the day&#x27;s experiments. This brief flight did not qualify for any prize, but earned Santos-Dumont an ovation from the crowd.

On 23 October, after a series of engine tests and high-speed ground runs (one of which ended as one wheel came loose, but this was quickly fixed), Santos-Dumont made a flight of over at an altitude of . This earned Santos-Dumont the first of the aviation prizes, 3,000 francs for a flight of or more.
This landing damaged the aircraft slightly, but Santos-Dumont announced that he should be ready to attempt the prize on 12 November 1906. 

===Concluding flights, and the inclusion of ailerons===
Following the airframe damage from the 23 October flights, the &quot;14-bis&quot; was repaired, and octagonal ailerons, with a hinging and mounting location similar to Robert Esnault-Pelterie&#x27;s 1904-era biplane glider design, were added to the middle of each outermost wing cell, with the surfaces pivoting between the outermost forward struts, again like Pelterie&#x27;s 1904 glider. These were operated by cables attached to the shoulders of the pilot&#x27;s flightsuit, somewhat like the hip-movement wing-warping control of the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;.
On the morning of 12 November 1906 the aviation community of France assembled at the Château de Bagatelle&#x27;s grounds to witness Santos-Dumont&#x27;s next attempt. As Santos-Dumont allowed the &quot;14-bis&quot; to run down the field, a car drove alongside, from which Henry Farman dropped a plate each time he observed the wheels of the aircraft leave the ground or touch down again. The first attempt achieved a 5-second flight of about around 40 cm off the ground, and the second two brief flights of 40 and . A hurried landing due to the proximity of some trees after this second attempt damaged the wheel axles, and these were fixed during a lunch break. In the afternoon, further flights of 50 meters and then (achieving about 40 km/h), this one interrupted by the proximity of a polo barrier. As the sun set, Santos-Dumont attempted one more flight. In order to ensure he would not hit the spectators, who by this time were all over the field, he pulled up while flying over them. After 22 seconds, he cut the engine and glided in to land. He had flown for 220 meters (over 700 ft), qualifying for the second aviation prize offered for heavier-than-air-aircraft, 1,000 francs for a flight of 100 meters or more. The next notable Santos-Dumont flights were made a year later in November 1907, flying his No. 19 Demoiselle.

==&quot;14-bis&quot; vs. &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;==
Some contend that the &quot;14-bis&quot;, rather than the 1903 &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;, was the first true airplane. For takeoff the 1903 &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; used a launch rail and a wheeled dolly which was left on the ground; the airplane landed on skids due to the sandy landing surface at Kitty Hawk. After 1903 the Wrights used a catapult to assist most takeoffs of their 1904 and 1905 airplanes. The Santos-Dumont &quot;14&quot;-bis did not use a catapult and ran on wheels located at the back of the aircraftsaid to have been adopted by Santos-Dumont for his &quot;14-bis&quot; after personally witnessing Traian Vuia&#x27;s contemporary, four-wheeled aircraft&#x27;s flight attempts earlier in 1906 in the western suburbs of Paris, not far from the Château de Bagatelle&#x27;s groundswith a &quot;nose-skid&quot; under the front of the &quot;14-bis&quot;&#x27; fuselage.

In contrast to that view, on October 5, 1905, Wilbur Wright made a circling flight of in 39 minutes 23 seconds, over Huffman Prairie near Dayton, Ohio, a year before Santos-Dumont&#x27;s flight earned him his first aviation award. Furthermore, written and photographic documentation by the Wrights authenticated by historians shows that the 1903 &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; accomplished takeoffs in a strong headwind without a catapult and made controlled and sustained flight; nearly three years before Santos-Dumont made his first heavier-than-air takeoff. In addition, although the Hargrave cells gave the &quot;14-bis&quot; lateral stability, there was no lateral control, which is required for making turns, rolling, and banking. The Wright design used wing-warping for lateral control, something which they had been using since 1899 in their gliders. Without lateral control, the aircraft merely hops, or lifts off the ground and returns to it in a straight line. Dumont added octagonal ailerons to the 14 bis for lateral control in November 1906 (see media pictures below).

<text>Gilby Engineering was a British general engineering company and Formula One constructor owned by Syd Greene.

==History==

Greene had lost an arm in a bicycle accident at 16 but went on to compete in many UK speed trials very successfully in the early 1950s. After he stopped competing, he fed his enthusiasm for motor racing by founding a motor racing team named after his company and later constructing the Gilby racing car. The team competed in 12 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, including 6 with cars of their own construction, but scored no World Championship points. The Gilby cars were constructed by Syd Greene for his son Keith to drive, having previously entered a Maserati 250F for Roy Salvadori and Ivor Bueb and also a Cooper for Greene Jr. Keith Greene later became better known as a team manager in Formula One and sports car racing. Gilby made its debut in the 1954 French Grand Prix with the Maserati, for Salvadori, who also drove for the team in and , and the team&#x27;s last event was the 1962 Italian Grand Prix. After the team ceased competing in Formula One, the final Gilby car was purchased and entered in three events in by privateer Ian Raby. Keith Greene achieved a third-place finish in the non-championship Naples Grand Prix of 1962, with the BRM-engined car, behind the works Ferrari&#x27;s of Willy Mairesse and Lorenzo Bandini.

<doc id="1262602" wikidata="Q172541" url="?curid=1262602" title="Kauhsen">
<text>Kauhsen was a Formula One constructor from Germany, founded by former sportscar driver Willi Kauhsen. The team started in Formula Two in 1976, purchasing Renault cars, and raced with an assortment of drivers with limited success. Kauhsen then entered the 1979 Formula One season, spending 1978 designing their own chassis with Cosworth engines. They participated in two World Championship Grands Prix with Gianfranco Brancatelli, failing to qualify on both occasions, before the team was shut down.

== Formula Two ==
Willi Kauhsen, who had raced Porsches and quasi-works Alfa Romeo sports cars, founded his racing team in Formula Two in 1976, buying the championship-winning Elf-Renault 2J Formula Two cars. The cars, driven by Michel Leclère and Klaus Ludwig, were renamed to Kauhsen-Renaults and initially started successfully, with Leclère taking pole at the first race of the 1977 Formula Two championship at Silverstone. Continued modifications to the chassis by Kauhsen however led to downturns in performance, and the car&#x27;s original performance turned to successive failures to qualify; the poor results making Ludwig leave the squad mid-season. The second seat was then rotated between José Dolhem, Vittorio Brambilla and Alain Prost for the remainder of the season. Brambilla achieved a third place in the second heat at the Misano Circuit, which was the team&#x27;s best result in the Formula Two championship. Subsequent races saw a best result of 10th for Prost, and with successive retirements and failures to qualify Kauhsen gave up on the championship before the final races.

== Formula One ==
Although unsuccessful in Formula Two, Kauhsen decided to enter Formula One in , and after failing to secure a deal to run the Kojima cars used in the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix, Kauhsen spent 1978 designing their own chassis. Bringing in designer Klaus Kapitza from Ford, Kauhsen planned to construct a copy of the Lotus 79, a car that had dominated the 1978 championship due to the use of ground effects. Apart from the chassis, Kauhsen bought the rest of the components from suppliers, including the Cosworth DFV engine utilised by the majority of the teams at the time, and an outdated five-speed gearbox from Hewland. Having planned to follow the then-advanced use of ground effects by Lotus, initial testing of the prototype revealed fundamental design issues; the designers failed to take account of the variable ride height of cars during braking and acceleration, stopping the ground effects functioning correctly. These problems forced the team to redesign the entire car, bringing in drivers Patrick Nève and Harald Ertl to develop a new car with the limited funds available in the months before the Formula One season was to begin.

The problems in getting working ground effects on the chassis led to the team abandoning the concept, and returning to the older &quot;wing car&quot; that had been in prevalence before. These redesigns drained the team of funds; Kauhsen struggled to pay the entry fee for the championship, and only managed to acquire older tyres from Goodyear. After obtaining some sponsorship, and signing Italian driver Gianfranco Brancatelli, the Kauhsen WK004 made its début appearance at the first race of the 1979 British Formula One season in Zolder, albeit retiring early in the race due to engine issues. Kauhsen&#x27;s first World Championship appearance was at the , using another redesigned car. Brancatelli failed to qualify for the race, being the slowest out of the 27 entries, the closest competitor being three seconds quicker. Running an updated car at the next race in Belgium, Brancatelli again failed to qualify, with a broken clutch preventing an improvement in pace. After the two successive failures, and a lack of funds, Willi Kauhsen withdrew from Formula One and closed the team.

The team&#x27;s assets were purchased by Arturo Merzario, and was merged with his own eponymous Merzario team, which had been having a similar lack of success with the A2 chassis. The Kauhsen WK was used as the basis for the Giampaolo Dallara designed Merzario A4 car, but this did not improve from the performance of either of the cars, failing to qualify at the remaining World Championship rounds. The A4&#x27;s only racing appearance was at the non-championship Dino Ferrari Grand Prix, finishing in 11th place. Merzario later left Formula One at the end of 1979, and moved to the Formula Two championship.

<text>LEC Refrigeration Racing was a UK motor racing team and Formula One constructor based at Bognor Regis, West Sussex. They participated in ten Grands Prix using a March in and their own car, the LEC CRP1, in .

==Formula One==

===1973===

In David Purley hired a March 731 and with backing from his family&#x27;s refrigeration company LEC Refrigeration, made a largely unsuccessful attempt at Formula One. Purley and the team made their debut in Monaco where the fuel tank broke. Purley did not make the restart at the British GP after he spun off. It was at the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix, however, where Purley carried out arguably his most memorable actions. Upon witnessing a crash which left fellow British driver Roger Williamson trapped in his overturned and burning car, Purley abandoned his own race and attempted to save Williamson, who was participating in only his second Formula One race. Purley later recalled that upon arriving at the scene, he heard Williamson crying for help as the fire began to take hold. Purley&#x27;s efforts to right the car and extinguish the flames were in vain as he received no help from nearby track marshals or emergency workers, in spite of attempts to encourage them, and other passing drivers, to come to his aid; Williamson died from asphyxiation. Because the marshalls were not wearing fire resistant clothing and the passing drivers believed that Purley was attempting to extinguish his own car, having escaped a fiery crash unharmed; they had no idea that a second driver was involved. The team took their first finish at the German GP. Purley also finished in Italy.

===1977===

LEC racing returned to Formula One in 1977 with their own LEC chassis designed by Mike Pilbeam and run by Mike Earle. It was this car in which Purley suffered serious injuries in an accident during pre-qualifying for that year&#x27;s British Grand Prix. He survived an estimated 179.8 g when he decelerated from 173 km/h (108 mph) to 0 in a distance of 66 cm (26 inches) after his throttle got stuck wide open and he hit a wall. For many years, this was thought to be the highest g-force ever survived by a human being. He suffered multiple fractures to his legs, pelvis and ribs.

The second CRP1 has been restored and has competed in historic Formula One racing alongside a modern replica built by WKD Motorsport.

<doc id="1262612" wikidata="Q171972" url="?curid=1262612" title="Life Racing Engines">
<text>Life was a Formula One constructor from Modena, Italy. The company was named for its founder, Ernesto Vita (&quot;Vita&quot; is Italian for &quot;Life&quot;). Life first emerged on the Formula One scene in 1990, trying to market their unconventional W12 3.5-litre engine.

The team had a disastrous single season, and failed to make the grid in all 14 attempted starts during the 1990 season, often clocking in laps many seconds slower than their next competitor.

== W12 engine ==
Life&#x27;s W12, or &quot;broad arrow&quot;, engine had been designed by the former Ferrari engineer Franco Rocchi, who had been responsible for, among others, Ferrari&#x27;s 3-litre V8 for the 1970s 308 GTB and GTS. Rocchi&#x27;s W12 plans dated back to a 1967 single-module W3 of as a prototype for a 3-litre W18 Ferrari engine of a planned 480 hp. After his dismissal in 1980, Rocchi worked privately on an engine in a W12 configuration.
According to his concept, the engine had three banks of four DOHC cylinders; hence it was short like a V8 but taller than a regular V-banked engine. In France, Guy Nègre from Moteurs Guy Nègre worked on a similar machine that saw the light of day in 1989 before being tested privately in an out-dated AGS JH22, chassis. Apart from the W12 configuration, both engines bore no other similarities, nor were there any links between their designers. Life&#x27;s W12 architecture resembles closely that of the Napier-Lion W12 engine.

Ernesto Vita was able to convince the retired ex-Ferrari engineer to go back to the drawing board to make the W12 concept come true. Rocchi&#x27;s W12 was ready in the first half of the Formula One season. It was the time when turbocharged engines were no longer legal in Formula One and the rules required a naturally aspirated motor. New engine manufacturers entered Formula One (such as Ilmor, Judd and Yamaha), and new ideas broke through. Ferrari and Lamborghini used V12 engines (successfully in the former&#x27;s case), Carlo Chiti&#x27;s Motori Moderni unsuccessfully tried to revive flat-12 engines, badged as Subarus and used by the Coloni team, whilst Renault and Honda developed V10 engines, used successfully by Williams and McLaren.

Vita&#x27;s plan was to sell the engine concept to a well-funded Formula One team. During 1989, he searched for a partner without any success. Finally, he gave up his search and decided to run the engine on his own in the 1990 Formula One season.

==Birth of the team==
Vita founded the Life Team, &quot;life&quot; being the English translation of his family name. The team&#x27;s headquarters were originally split between the technical offices in Reggio Emilia and the factory in Formigine, near Modena, then regrouped under the same roof in Formigine. While not having state of the art facilities, the factory was equipped with a &quot;Borghi e Severi&quot; dyno bench and related AVL datalogging computers, which was used for the development of the W12 motor, standard toolshop machines, and a warehouse. As Life was not able to build a car on its own, the team purchased the still-born Formula One chassis from First Racing that had been designed by Richard Divila for Lamberto Leoni&#x27;s abortive Formula One team the year before. In late 1989, the chassis was fitted with his W12 engine. The major engineering work had been done by Gianni Marelli, another former Ferrari man. The car – now dubbed Life L190 – was ready by February 1990, and tested briefly at Vallelunga and Monza.

==1990 season==

When the new season came, the team had one chassis, four engines and spare parts, and a spare chassis. The W12 turned out to be the least powerful engine of the year: its output was 470 hp while others produced 600 to 700 hp. At the same time, the ex-First L190 chassis was one of the heaviest cars in the field at 530 kg. Handling was bad and reliability was poor. As a result, the Life was no faster than a Formula 3 car. Even in Formula 3000, it would have been outclassed.

Several drivers were approached to drive for the team, including Gabriele Tarquini, Pierluigi Martini, Marco Apicella, Roberto Moreno and Gianni Morbidelli. Ultimately Sir Jack Brabham&#x27;s son Gary Brabham was signed to drive with Franco Scapini hired as test driver and Sergio Barbasio as team manager. When Brabham failed to pre-qualify twice he left the team for good, as the car had coasted to a halt after 400 yards with a malfunctioning battery. Brabham later stated that the car did not have a functioning tachometer in either of the pre-qualifying sessions, and that the team did not possess a tyre pressure gauge, having to borrow one from the EuroBrun team.&lt;ref name=&quot;MN11/4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is disputed by the team&#x27;s former mechanics. He also made efforts to persuade the team to switch to a Judd CV V8 engine, but was unsuccessful. Designer Gianni Marelli also left the team at this stage, after a disagreement with Vita.&lt;ref name=&quot;MN25/4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After Brabham left, Vita tried to replace the Australian with Bernd Schneider, who had stood in at Arrows at the first race of the season, but the German driver refused. &quot;I definitely don&#x27;t want to drive for them&quot;, he said. Test driver Scapini was also a candidate to replace Brabham, but the Italian was not granted an FIA Super Licence.&lt;ref name=&quot;MN2/5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another driver contacted by the team was New Zealander Rob Wilson, who said he would be interested in driving for Life, especially if the team expanded to two cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;MN23/5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruno Giacomelli, an Italian veteran who had last raced in Formula One in 1983, was then signed by the team. Giacomelli was an attractive proposition as he had recent experience of Formula 1 cars in his role as test driver for Leyton House Racing and good contacts with Engine Developments, who designed and manufactured the Judd Formula 1 engines. The most laps made by the car during pre-qualifying was twenty-two in Silverstone. At the 1990 San Marino Grand Prix Giacomelli said that he was scared he might be struck from behind as his car was so slow. In the pre-qualifying sessions for that race, Giacomelli apparently finished his run with an almost six-minute gap to the second slowest time, as his car broke down at the end of the pit lane on the out lap, and the car&#x27;s transponder was left switched on, resulting in it being timed while being towed. For the Portuguese Grand Prix, the team replaced its original W12 engine with the more conventional Judd CV V8, an enormous undertaking completed in under three weeks by a minuscule and chronically underfunded company. The car successfully began the pre-qualifying round, however, on its first lap at Estoril, the engine cover came loose and flew off. The last appearance of the car was at Jerez for the Spanish GP. Subsequently, the team opted to withdraw before the final two Grands Prix.

The race team usually consisted of only nine people: the racing driver; Sergio Barbasio (team manager); Franco Scapini (test driver); Francesca Papa (Ernesto Vita&#x27;s wife); Maurizio Ferrari (engineer); Emilio Gabrielli (truckie and mechanic); and the three mechanics: chief mechanic Oliver Piazzi, Heinz Willi Mueller and Luca Cassoni.

== After Formula One ==
The Life L190 which took part in the 1990 Formula One World Championship was fully restored in 2009 by Oliver Piazzi and ran at the 2009 Goodwood Festival of Speed with its original W12 engine back in place. It made two successful attempts at completing the Goodwood hill climb, driven by Arturo Merzario, and Lorenzo Prandina, who at that time was the owner of the car.

<text>Lyncar was a racing car constructor from the United Kingdom. The company built one Formula One car, in 1974, which participated in two Grands Prix, the 1974 and 1975 British Grands Prix.

==History==

Lyncar&#x27;s founder Martin Slater had built and raced his own cars in junior formulae before becoming a designer for Lola, Brabham and March. In 1971, Slater built a car to enter the British Formula Atlantic Championship, the first of a series of machines which led to the Lyncar 005 with which McLaren engine-builder and amateur racer John Nicholson won the 1973 and 1974 championships.

===Formula One===

Based upon success in Formula Atlantic, Nicholson commissioned a Formula One chassis from Slater. Nicholson had by then established his own engine building business and was unable to spare the time for a full Grand Prix season. He entered non-championship races and the British Grand Prix in both and , qualifying for the latter. He was classified 17th (five laps behind) despite crashing in the heavy storm at the end of the race.

The car was later updated and entered for Emilio de Villota in the Shellsport International Series, winning a round in 1977 at Mallory Park.

===Sportscars===

In 1983, Greek racing driver Costas Los commissioned Slater to build a car for Group C2 class of the World Sportscar Championship. The car - dubbed the MS83 - was originally fitted with a Brian Hart 420R 2-litre engine, used before Los bought a Nicholson-fettled Cosworth DFV engine in May 1984, fitted after the Hart blew at the 1984 1000 km of Silverstone. It raced a number of times in the 1984 World Sportscar Championship season, without ever gaining a classified finish; however it would have been 2nd in class at the 1984 1000 km of Brands Hatch had it not been disqualified for its final lap taking too long.

<text>Maki Engineering was a Formula One constructor from Japan. 

==History==

A small team founded by Kenji Mimura, their entry into the 1974 Formula One World Championship was Japan&#x27;s first since Honda had withdrawn at the end of the 1968 season. They first entered the 1974 British Grand Prix, with New Zealand driver Howden Ganley driving a single Maki F101, powered by the ubiquitous Cosworth DFV V8 engine. He failed to qualify, and then badly injured his legs at the following German Grand Prix. The team then withdrew to Japan to repair and modify the car.

That seemed to be it, but then the small team re-emerged at the 1975 Dutch Grand Prix, with successful domestic driver Hiroshi Fushida driving the updated Maki F101C, and sponsorship from Citizen Watches. With only 25 entrants, he was guaranteed a starting place, but the DFV broke in practice and he was unable to start as the team had no spares. They missed the French Grand Prix, and then Fushida failed to qualify for the British Grand Prix. For the German Grand Prix, former Lotus F1 driver Tony Trimmer replaced Fushida, but was unable to qualify either there, or for the Austrian Grand Prix. Maki made its first and only race start in the non-championship Swiss Grand Prix, where Trimmer finished last of the finishers in 13th place, six laps behind Clay Regazzoni&#x27;s Ferrari.

The team disappeared once again, only returning to Formula One once – for the 1976 season-closing Japanese Grand Prix. With Trimmer in the seat, the upgraded F102A once again failed to make the grid, and the team were never seen in Formula One again.

<text>Automobiles Martini is a constructor of Formula racing cars from France, founded by Renato &quot;Tico&quot; Martini in 1965, when Martini and partner Bill Knight founded the Winfield Racing School at the Magny-Cours circuit, in France. Martini&#x27;s first car was the MW1 in 1967, a single seater for the racing driving school, from which was derived a Formula Three car, MW1A built in 1968.

Although better known for their successful efforts in Formula Three, Formula Renault and other lower formulae during the 1970s and 1980s, they are also known for having taken part in nine rounds of the 1978 Formula One season with the single MK23 chassis, giving René Arnoux (later a driver for Renault and Ferrari) his debut in Formula One. Future four time World Drivers&#x27; Champion Alain Prost also used a Renault powered Martini to win the 1978 and 1979 French Formula Three Championship while driving for French team Oreca.

With Reynard, Ralt and Dallara crowding out the F3 market in the late 1980s, Martini reduced their customer program, keeping a stubborn presence in the French F3 championship during the 1990s, until Tico Martini finally sold the company to Guy Ligier in 2004.

<text>McGuire was a Formula One racing car constructor founded by Australian driver Brian McGuire. The team participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix but failed to qualify.

Brian McGuire first started to race in the British-based Shellsport G8 International Series in 1976, as a private entry with the Formula One-specification Williams FW04. He also entered the car for the 1976 British Grand Prix but was only listed as a reserve and never made it on to the track. For the 1977 season McGuire made extensive modifications to the Williams and it was entered for the 1977 British Grand Prix as the McGuire BM1. However, the car was uncompetitive in the special pre-qualifying sessions, slower than all the other entrants except Mikko Kozarowitzky who had an accident, and McGuire failed to make it through to the full qualifying sessions. Brian McGuire was killed at the wheel of the car at Brands Hatch later in 1977.

<doc id="1262619" wikidata="Q172577" url="?curid=1262619" title="Merzario">
<text>Merzario was a Formula One and Formula Two team and constructor from Italy. The team participated in 38 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix but scored no championship points.

==Formula One==

===1977===
Merzario was set up in 1977 by former Ferrari, Williams and March driver Arturo Merzario when he could no longer find a drive with an established team. He initially campaigned a March 761B during , his best result being 14th in the 1977 Belgian Grand Prix. This proved to be the only occasion in three years of participation in Formula One that one of their cars was classified at the finish of a World Championship Grand Prix. During the early part of the season Merzario&#x27;s car was consistently the fastest of a number of March 761s on the grid, though as the season wore on, he slipped down the grids and finally decided to abandon the season and concentrate on the following year and his new car.

===1978===
In 1978 Merzario partnered with Swiss Formula One entrant Guglielmo Bellasi and laid the foundation for his own team. Merzario&#x27;s first self-built Formula One effort, the A1, appeared in 1978 and was a basically conventional car based largely on his March 761B, with a red colour scheme and crude bodywork vaguely reminiscent of a Ferrari 312T2 in its use of cockpit-side ducting for an air intake. It used the then-common combination of the Cosworth DFV engine and Hewland gearbox. The livery changed from red to black before the 1978 Monaco Grand Prix, though it was not until the Swedish Grand Prix that it finished a race, although unclassified, being eight laps adrift of the winner after a long pitstop. For the Austrian Grand Prix, a second A1 was unveiled, although it was suspected that this was actually the team&#x27;s old March 761B with new bodywork. With this car at his disposal, Merzario performed slightly better in qualifying but still failed to be classified in a race. For the Italian Grand Prix, both A1s were entered, with Alberto Colombo driving the original A1 and Merzario taking the newer second A1. Colombo posted the slowest time during qualifying and did not make the grid, while Merzario qualified comfortably, only for the engine to fail during the race. The team qualified the car on eight occasions during 1978, but retired seven times with mechanical failures.

===1979===
For the 1979 Formula One season the second A1 was revised into the A1B with more elegant bodywork and revised front suspension, and a new yellow and black livery. The A1B was the only Merzario to qualify for Grands Prix during 1979, which it did twice, though it retired on both occasions.

The A2 (designated A3 by some sources), designed by Merzario and Simon Hadfield and based on the first A1, was ready in time for the European rounds of the 1979 season with the same engine and gearbox combination, and it had been modified into a ground effect &#x27;wing&#x27; car. Only one example was built. The A2 first took to the racetrack at the 1979 United States Grand Prix West in the hands of Arturo Merzario. Merzario qualified the car for the race but after the front suspension failed he had to start the race in the A1B. The car officially made its debut at the 1979 Spanish Grand Prix, where Merzario set the 26th time during qualifying and failed to make the race. At the next race in Belgium, Merzario crashed during qualifying and broke his arm. For Monaco Merzario asked Gianfranco Brancatelli to drive his car, but Brancatelli failed to pre-qualify. Merzario was back at the wheel at the French Grand Prix. He set the 26th time during qualifying and was more than two seconds slower than the last qualifier. The A2 took to the track for the last time at the Austrian Grand Prix, after Merzario damaged the A4 in a practice accident.

By this time, Merzario and Bellasi had purchased the assets of the Kauhsen team (and their driver Brancatelli), arguably taking on cars even worse than his old March-based vehicle. The Kauhsen chassis was rebuilt by Giampaolo Dallara and renamed the Merzario A4. The A4 employed the same Cosworth / Hewland running gear and the suspension was similar to the A2, but the bodywork was less bulky, with better sidepods for improved airflow. However, the car again failed to qualify for every Grand Prix that it entered, proving even slower than its predecessors. The only time the A4 was not the slowest car in qualifying was at the Italian Grand Prix, where Héctor Rebaque was seven tenths slower in his Rebaque HR100. However, Merzario did qualify and race the car in the non-championship Dino Ferrari Grand Prix at Imola, where he finished 11th and last, two laps down.

==After Formula One==
After plans to modify the A4 into the A5 were not completed due to financial problems, Merzario turned to constructing Formula Two cars. He was keen to point out that the engine bay of his 1980 BMW-engined M1 F2 machine could easily be modified to take a Cosworth DFV F1 engine, though no such effort was ever made. The car was fairly unsuccessful in F2, and Merzario decided to return to running March chassis for 1981. With March 812s, the team finally scored two podiums in F2, with Piero Necchi at the wheel, but after a lacklustre 1982 season, Merzario again built his own cars for 1983 with minimal success. After moving down to Italian Formula 3, he finally moved away from team ownership in the mid-1980s.

<doc id="1262622" wikidata="Q172109" url="?curid=1262622" title="Onyx Grand Prix">
<text>Onyx Grand Prix is a former Formula One constructor from Britain that competed in the and Formula One seasons. The team participated in 26 World Championship Grands Prix (25 starts) and scored six World Constructors&#x27; Championship points. Its best result was third place, in the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix, for Stefan Johansson.

== Pre-Formula One beginnings ==
Onyx Grand Prix began life as Onyx Race Engineering in late 1978 as a partnership between old colleagues Mike Earle and Greg Field. Prior to approaching Field and asking him to join him in a new venture, Earle had had extensive experience in open-wheel racing, running the successful &quot;Church Farm Racing&quot; team in F3, F2 and Formula 5000, as well as previously working with Field and driver David Purley in the LEC racing team in Formula Atlantic, F2, European Formula 5000 and occasional Formula One races. In their first foray into team ownership the duo intended to enter their own chassis in Formula 2 for the 1979 season but it turned out to be a largely unsuccessful campaign. They returned in 1980 and 1981 running semi-works Marches for Johnny Cecotto and Riccardo Paletti. After a competitive 1981 season Paletti&#x27;s sponsors took him to Formula One with Osella. Not wanting to be left behind, Onyx tried their hand at F1 by entering a private March in 5 rounds for Spaniard Emilio de Villota, with de Villota failing to qualify for any of the races. Onyx planned to enter their own car once again in 1983 but this time taking a step up into the world of Formula One with a returning Paletti. Disaster struck as Paletti was killed at the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix and this seemed to curtail Onyx&#x27;s progression forward.

== Next step ==
At this time, co-founder Greg Field decided to leave the team and sold his share to racing enthusiast Jo Chamberlain, which looked like a further step backwards for the team. Some good fortune arrived as March Engineering co-founder Robin Herd had decided to outsource the running of the works March Formula 2 team and he approached Earle and Onyx to do it. Onyx had now inherited a class-leading chassis, a dominant BMW engine and the best Michelin tyres for the 1983 season, along with capable drivers in Beppe Gabbiani, Thierry Tassin and Christian Danner. The season did not turn out to be a good one as the team fell behind the works Ralts. 1984 would see the team slip further behind the Ralts and even a privately entered March. In 1985 Formula 3000 replaced F2 as the stepping-stone series to Formula One and Onyx continued to run the works March effort, finishing 3rd with Emanuele Pirro in 1985, then progressing even further as Pirro finished as runner-up in 1986, before Onyx achieved their finest moment as Stefano Modena was crowned the 1987 Formula 3000 champion. With Modena off to Formula One, Onyx set their sights on retaining the championship with Volker Weidler but 1988 turned out to be a huge disappointment, as Weidler battled with the March 88B, finishing in 15th position overall. Nevertheless, buoyed by a largely successful Formula 2 and Formula 3000 tenure, Earle was now eager to enter Formula One and set about building a solid team with which to enter the pinnacle of motorsport.

== Formula One ==
Prior to entering Formula One, Paul Shakespeare had purchased the majority shares of the team in September 1988 and this provided Onyx with the much needed injection of cash to make the step up. Martin Dickson was hired as team manager and the team was further boosted by sponsorship from Marlboro and &quot;Moneytron&quot;, a company owned by flamboyant Belgian Jean-Pierre Van Rossem. Van Rossem would soon purchase all of Shakespeare&#x27;s shares, becoming the majority owner in a deal that would cause the team a considerable number of problems in the future. In the meantime, the team, now rebranded as &quot;Onyx Grand Prix&quot;, had struck a deal to use Ford V8s and Goodyear tyres. Respected engineer Alan Jenkins, who had previously worked for McLaren, was commissioned to design the team&#x27;s first Formula One car, resulting in the tidy-looking Onyx ORE-1. Earle went for a mixture of youth and experience on the driving front and hired the respected Stefan Johansson and the young Belgian rookie Bertrand Gachot, who had actually been responsible for the arrival of Van Rossem and his &quot;Moneytron&quot; sponsorship. With a solid business plan in place, a wealth of experience in junior formulae, a sound car and engine package and a solid driver duo, Onyx Grand Prix looked set to have a rather promising future in Formula One. At the car&#x27;s debut in England, Autosport&#x27;s Nigel Roebuck described the &quot;Moneytron&quot; sponsorship as &quot;the most tasteless I have ever seen&quot;.

== 1989 season ==

Despite all of the excitement and preparation, Onyx only just made it to their first Grand Prix. Their cars were only completed on the morning of their launch, before having to be hastily packed and sent off to Heathrow Airport the same day for transportation to Brazil, the scene of the season&#x27;s first race. Having had no testing to fine-tune the cars, neither car would make it out of pre-qualifying in the first 3 rounds. Things got worse as a testing accident completely destroyed one chassis prior to the race at Imola and at the race itself, brake failure on Johansson&#x27;s car resulted in another car-destroying crash. Positive signs were beginning to show as Gachot just missed out on pre-qualifying in Imola, Johansson would do the same at Monaco, before finally Johansson would make it out of pre-qualifying in Mexico, setting the 6th fastest time in Saturday free practice before qualifying 21st for the race, ahead of the illustrious Nelson Piquet and respected drivers Pierluigi Martini, René Arnoux and Eddie Cheever. The car however, and expectedly, would suffer a mechanical failure in its debut race, but progress was being made. More good news arrived at Phoenix with the return of Greg Field who replaced Dickson as Team Manager and Johansson once again making the grid, qualifying 19th before a front suspension failure ended his day. Johansson was once again on the grid in Canada, this time 18th. Gachot had yet to make his first Grand Prix start but he was getting ever closer.

During this upswing things started to look ominous. Van Rossem&#x27;s lavish lifestyle and extravagance came to the fore, having purchased a US$20 million Gulfstream IV business jet prior to the Phoenix Grand Prix. Johansson was also disqualified in Canada after a botched pit-stop saw him tear the air gun rig apart. Amidst all the dark clouds, a sunny day arrived at the 1989 French Grand Prix. Both cars were ideally suited to the Paul Ricard circuit and comfortably finished 1–2 in pre-qualifying. They both had an even more impressive qualifying proper, with Gachot ending up 11th on the grid and Johansson 13th. Gachot ran with Alesi, who finished 4th, before a battery problem put him down to 13th, while Johansson scored the team&#x27;s first points with a fine 5th place. The two points were now set to get the team out of pre-qualifying for the remainder of the season, but it came to nothing at the next round in Britain. Johansson failed to qualify and Gachot qualified 21st before having his race blighted by handling problems. The Minardis would finish 5th and 6th however, condemning Onyx to the ruthless world of pre-qualifying, although the fact that the two Brabhams and Dallara&#x27;s Alex Caffi were no longer pre-qualifiers made this task easier for them. Johansson would qualify in Germany, Hungary and Belgium, with Gachot missing out in Germany (which would be the only time during the 1989 season that an Onyx would succeed in getting through pre-qualifying without then going on to qualify). Trouble flared up once again with Van Rossem and his flamboyancy as he had been quoted in the press as saying he was attempting to attract top drivers to the team and was in the process of investing US$40 million into Porsche&#x27;s F1 engine project while, in reality and behind closed doors, Van Rossem was beginning to bemoan the cost of running a Formula One team and was even rumoured to be reluctant to pay the team&#x27;s bills. Van Rossem went one step further by saying on Belgian TV that he would quit F1 if the Porsche engine deal fell through. Many saw this as an admission that he was tired of the sport and sought a reason to get out. Van Rossem&#x27;s spectacularly destructive and erratic antics went on: he also made some controversial comments in a Belgian newspaper during the Belgian GP weekend, drawing the ire of two of F1&#x27;s most powerful men, F1 commercial rights holder and F1 management CEO Bernie Ecclestone and then-FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre. He denied apparent allegations that he had referred to Balestre as a Nazi (Balestre apparently was part of the pro-Nazi Vichy French military during World War II) and Ecclestone as a Mafia boss. Ecclestone then banned Van Rossem from attending any further Grands Prix.

At the Italian Grand Prix Gachot qualified for what would be his final race for the team, while Johansson failed to make the grid. Gachot raised the ire of his erratic boss and was sacked for voicing his displeasure at the team&#x27;s lack of testing and an apparent lack of faith in his driving. JJ Lehto was drafted in at the last minute as his replacement, but with little time to familiarise himself with the new car he failed to qualify for the next round in Portugal. Yet again it was Johansson that came to the fore and gave Onyx a reason to smile at the Portuguese Grand Prix. He decided not to change tyres during the race and after everybody else had made their pit-stops and following Mansell and Senna&#x27;s collision, he was running an incredible 3rd before his tyres started to go off. He was rapidly caught and passed by both Williams but they soon retired and Johansson was left with a clear run home in 3rd, crossing the line with no fuel left. It was a great moment for the team but it would also turn out to be their last points finish. With Van Rossem reluctant to make funds available, development on the car was slow and Johansson would not qualify for the rest of the season, although Lehto would continue to improve, making the grid in Spain and Australia.

The team finished in a respectable 10th position overall in their debut season, scoring 6 points and being rewarded with not having to take part in pre-qualifying for the following season.

== 1990 season ==

After what should have been a solid foundation to build on in 1989, things started coming apart heading into 1990. At the end of the 1989 season Van Rossem&#x27;s lack of interest began to show. Finances quickly dried up and Van Rossem&#x27;s flamboyant and uncooperative personality resulted in Earle and Chamberlain quitting the team, with Field leaving for a second time. Alan Jenkins took charge, with Peter Rheinardt taking over as Team Manager from Field. Having failed to secure a deal for either Honda or Porsche V10s for , Van Rossem acted on his threats and left, taking his &quot;Moneytron&quot; sponsorship with him. Now seeking new ownership, Swiss car collector and former racer Peter Monteverdi purchased 50% of the team, with Karl Foitek purchasing 25% and Brune Frei purchasing the remaining 25%. Onyx was already in such dire financial straits that Foitek had to pay for Goodyear tyres used by the team in 1989 before the company would provide them with tyres for the 1990 season. The team then rehired Earle and Chamberlain, but Alan Jenkins was soon fired after refusing to work with Earle. To make matters worse Earle and Chamberlain left once again, along with Team Manager Rheinhardt and the bulk of Onyx&#x27;s experienced staff.

For 1990 the team retained JJ Lehto and opted to go with Gregor Foitek, son of part-owner Karl Foitek, in the second car. Foitek was contracted to Brabham for two races so Johansson was kept for the opening two rounds. As little money had been put into developing a car for the 1990 season, Onyx arrived at the opening two rounds with last year&#x27;s ORE-1. Neither driver qualified for the first two races, with Johansson destroying two chassis in the process. At the San Marino Grand Prix the team arrived with slightly updated ORE-1B chassis. Foitek replaced Johansson, who sued Onyx for breach of contract and, along with Alan Jenkins, attempted to get a court injunction to block Monteverdi&#x27;s planned relocation of the team. Both cars made the grid at Imola, with Lehto coming home 12th. At Monaco Foitek was running in 6th position at a late stage in the race when he collided with Éric Bernard&#x27;s Larrousse, resulting in him being classified 7th, a result that would be Onyx&#x27;s best finish of the season. Both cars made the grid in Canada and Mexico, but could only manage one finish between them, with Foitek&#x27;s 15th place in Mexico. In July Monteverdi had fulfilled his desire to move the team to Switzerland but that improved nothing. A clear indication of how far behind the team had fallen came in France where both cars failed to make the grid, where at the same track last season they had both qualified high up and netted a points finish. At the British Grand Prix neither car made the grid. By the time of the German Grand Prix, Monteverdi had succeeded in changing the team&#x27;s name to &quot;Monteverdi Onyx Formula One&quot;, but once again it meant nothing as although both cars scraped onto the grid, Foitek retired early and Lehto finished six laps behind and was unclassified.

There were also rumours circulating regarding poor car preparation, including broken suspension parts being welded back together instead of being replaced and the cannibalising of Monteverdi&#x27;s sports car collection for spare parts. One incident saw Lehto repeatedly complaining of poor handling, a problem that was finally solved when his driveshaft was discovered to have been installed the wrong way around. At around this time part-owner Karl Foitek withdrew his money and barred his son from driving a car that he now felt was dangerous. With finances already a huge problem, Foitek&#x27;s withdrawal was the final straw and the team would ultimately not see out the championship, wrapping up operations at the Hungarian Grand Prix.

== Reformation ==
After a time spent running Arena Motorsport, Earle reformed the team initially to contest the 2014 World Touring Car Championship with TC1 version of Ford Fiesta saloon. However the plans were abolished in February 2014 due to lack of support by Ford. Instead the team was to build the Ford Focus ST for the 2015 TCR International Series season. However, the car was underdeveloped and uncompetitive and only contested half the events in the inaugural season, recording just two classified finishes at Monza, before the assets were sold to the FRD racing team for 2016.

<text>Pacific Racing (later known as Pacific Grand Prix, and finally as Pacific Team Lotus) was a motor racing team from the United Kingdom. Following success in lower formulae, the team took part in two full seasons of Formula One, in and , entering 33 Grands Prix without any success.

==Origins and success in lower formulae==

The team was founded by former mechanic Keith Wiggins in 1984, to race in the European Formula Ford Championship, with Norwegian driver Harald Huysman and Marlboro backing. Huysman won both the European and Benelux titles. On Huysman&#x27;s advice, Pacific entered Bertrand Gachot in British Formula Ford with a Reynard in 1985. The following year, Gachot, also part of the Marlboro World Championship team, won the Formula Ford 2000 crown for Pacific. Marlboro stayed with Wiggins&#x27; team in FF2000 in 1987, winning the British title with JJ Lehto.

In 1988, Pacific entered the British F3 Championship with Lehto and a Reynard car, and won the title on their first attempt. Wiggins did not want to stay in F3 and moved up to Formula 3000, once more in association with Reynard and Marlboro. However, Lehto and Eddie Irvine&#x27;s season was disappointing and the tobacco company&#x27;s support moved to rival DAMS in 1990. The team returned to form in 1991, taking Christian Fittipaldi to the F3000 crown.

==Formula One==

Pacific Racing had won in every junior category it had participated in, and by 1992 Wiggins was determined that it would make the step up to F1 for the 1993 season, in the process renaming the team as Pacific Grand Prix. Lacking an in-house engineering staff and conscious of how limited his timescale was, Wiggins contacted F3000 constructor Reynard Racing to design and build the new PR01 chassis, hoping to benefit from several years of research and development that Reynard had invested in their recently scrapped in-house F1 project. Unfortunately for Pacific, the Rory Byrne-led design team had gone to Benetton at the end of 1991 and Reynard had sold the design (still in form of paper drawings) to Ligier. The small PR01 design team, working at Reynard but nominally employed by Pacific to conform to FIA Regulations, were forced to start a new design based on what little of the Reynard F1 research remained and utilizing a number of minor components from Reynard&#x27;s F3000 chassis in an attempt to constrain costs. With their roots in the same project, the resulting Benetton B193, Ligier JS37 and Pacific PR01 shared the same slab-sided, raised-nose profile that later became standard in Formula One.

They instead postponed their entry in January 1993 because of a recession and resulting failure of investors to pay up.

They were unable to enter F1 until 1994. The year was a disaster. Paul Belmondo and former Jordan driver Bertrand Gachot (who was a shareholder in the team) started the season as drivers, with Oliver Gavin testing. The PR01, designed for the 1993 season, had undergone none of the vital wind tunnel testing required to refine the car&#x27;s aerodynamics, had seen only a few dozen miles of track testing and its Ilmor 3.5 L V10 engine was underpowered by 1994 standards. That season the team failed to score a point or finish a single race, and from the French Grand Prix onwards, neither car qualified.

Aiming for a fresh start in 1995, Pacific made a deal with the owner of the former Team Lotus to enter as &quot;Pacific Team Lotus&quot;. Although no staff, equipment or technology came to the team as a result, the aim was for Pacific to benefit from association with the famous Lotus name. The obsolete Ilmor engines had been replaced by Ford ED V8s and a whole host of new sponsors were brought in. Good news also came when the PR02 was guaranteed a start each race, with Larrousse and Lotus disappearing from the entry lists and only Forti coming in. An embarrassing moment happened during the reveal of the car when it took Wiggins 25 minutes to open a bottle of champagne. Belmondo had been replaced with Andrea Montermini. Having had no luck in the first half of the season, team partner Gachot vacated his seat in mid-1995, making way for paydrivers Giovanni Lavaggi (four races, four DNFs) and Jean-Denis Délétraz (two races, one DNF, one NC). Gachot later returned after the money of the two pay-drivers dried up and two drivers Wiggins wanted to run (Formula Nippon driver Katsumi Yamamoto for Okayama and Suzuka and test driver Oliver Gavin for Australia) were denied superlicences. Pacific&#x27;s best finishes that season were 8th in the German and Australian Grands Prix, both times as the multi-lapped last car in the track.

==Withdrawal and aftermath==
At the end of the 1995 season, the team withdrew from Formula One and Wiggins went back to Formula 3000, resurrecting Pacific Racing with Patrick Lemarié and Cristiano da Matta as drivers, but was unable to recapture the success of the pre-F1 era. Both were replaced by Oliver Tichy and Marc Gené for the following season; Gené left the team after his accident at Pau, and Tichy continued alone until the team quit mid-season. In 1997, Pacific&#x27;s former F1 drivers Gachot and Belmondo were reunited in the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship, both acting as drivers of the Pacific-sponsored Toyota Supra entered by Cerumo in the GT500 class. On that same year, Wiggins also attempted to enter sportscar racing and the 24 Hours of Le Mans with a heavily modified BRM chassis known as the P301 and using Nissan engines. Following a series of failures for the project into 1998, Wiggins closed the team.

Wiggins joined Lola and helped the constructor reclaim ground in the Champ Car World Series. With a foothold in the United States, the mechanic-turned-team manager joined up with the Herdez brewery and in 2000 acquired Bettenhausen Motorsports, renaming it HVM Racing. In 2006, Paul Stoddart, former owner of the Minardi F1 team, bought an interest in the team and renamed it Minardi Team USA; the team reverted to the HVM Racing name after American open-wheel reunification two years later, before leaving the sport at the end of 2012 season.

<doc id="1262624" wikidata="Q172483" url="?curid=1262624" title="Vel's Parnelli Jones Racing">
<text>Vel&#x27;s Parnelli Jones Racing, commonly referred to simply as Parnelli or VPJ, was a motor racing constructor and team from the United States. The team was formed in 1969 by former USAC racer Parnelli Jones and his business partner Velko &quot;Vel&quot; Miletich. Parnelli was initially solely concerned with USAC racing, where success came quickly; their driver Al Unser won the Indianapolis 500 race in 1970, driving a VPJ Colt, after leading 190 of the 200 racing laps. Unser went on to win the USAC championship. Unser repeated the Indy 500 win in 1971 with a new Colt built without the left side chassis offset that had been made illegal by 1971 rules, ending the season in fourth place in the USAC drivers points while teammate Joe Leonard won the championship.

==Racing==

Parnelli secured the services of ex-Team Lotus designer Maurice Philippe and driver Mario Andretti for USAC racing in the early 1970s, and in 1974 decided to move into Formula One racing, with financial support from tire manufacturer Firestone. After a brief foray into Formula One at the end of the season, Vel&#x27;s Parnelli Jones mounted a full campaign in . Their Parnelli VPJ4 car owed much to Philippe&#x27;s Lotus 72 design. It appeared for the North American races at the end of the 1974 season and was gradually developed through 1975. However, Firestone&#x27;s decision to quit racing at the end of 1974 meant that a major partner was lost. Jones was unable to find a replacement title sponsor and despite improvements made to the car the team folded only three races into the season. Andretti only learned of the Formula One team&#x27;s future from journalist Chris Economaki, as he sat in the car on the grid for the Long Beach Grand Prix. This led to some bad feeling between Andretti and Jones, and Andretti returned to Lotus for the remainder of the season. In total, Vel&#x27;s Parnelli Jones participated in 16 Grands Prix and scored 6 championship points.

Concurrent with the Formula One venture, VPJ was developing a turbocharged version of Cosworth&#x27;s legendary DFV V8 Formula One engine, building on their experience from the previous two years. It was developed at their facility in Torrance, California, under the direction of engine builder Larry Slutter and dyno engineer Takeo &quot;Chickie&quot; Hirashima. The car debuted at the Speedway in 1975 in a modified Indy version of the Formula One Parnelli chassis, although it was not run regularly until late in 1976. This private project was quickly adopted by Cosworth itself, and the Parnelli engine evolved into the equally legendary Cosworth DFX, an engine which would go on to win every Indianapolis 500 race and USAC/CART Championship between 1978 and 1987.

<text>Team Rebaque was a Mexican Formula One entrant and constructor, based in Leamington Spa, UK. They participated in 30 Grands Prix, initially entering cars bought from Team Lotus, before finally building a car of their own. The Rebaque HR100 was entered for the team&#x27;s final three races before the team&#x27;s closure. The team qualified to race on 19 occasions, and achieved one World Constructors&#x27; Championship point with its best finish of sixth at the 1978 German Grand Prix.

==History==
The team was founded by, and centred on, Héctor Rebaque, a Mexican driver who first drove in Formula One in 1977 for Hesketh. Following his debut season he was dropped by Hesketh, and with no other team willing to take him on as a driver Rebaque decided to start his own team.

At the start of the 1978 Formula One season Rebaque agreed a deal with Team Lotus to buy their 1977 Type 78 model (JPS-15). He had very little experience, only having qualified for one race with Hesketh, and had a difficult year. Although he did score a point at the German Grand Prix, he also suffered the ignominy of being forced to retire from the Brazilian Grand Prix owing to driver fatigue.

==Rebaque HR100==
He continued the arrangement with Lotus for the season, this time buying the Championship winning Type 79 chassis. During the year he commissioned Penske to build a chassis, the Rebaque HR100. The design of the car - by Geoff Ferris with input from John Barnard - was heavily influenced by the design of the Lotus 79, also incorporating some elements of the Williams FW07&#x27;s sidepods. It was completed in time for the Italian Grand Prix that year, although it either failed to qualify or to finish the final three races of the year. The team was closed down at the end of the year. Rebaque himself moved to the Brabham team midway through the following season.

<text>Rial is a German producer of light alloy wheels and rims, and was a Formula One constructor competing in the and seasons. Founded in the 1970s as a wheel rim producer, the company was bought by Günter Schmid, ex-owner of the ATS wheels company in 1987. Schmid followed the same strategy as he had at ATS, advertising the Rial wheel brand by entering Formula One as a constructor. Rial participated in 32 Grands Prix, entering a total of 48 cars. They scored six championship points, finishing a highest of ninth in the constructors championship in 1988. After leaving Formula One at the end of the 1989 season, the Rial Racing division was closed, and the company did not race again. Rial continues to manufacture wheels and rims from its factory in Fußgönheim.

The team was, together with the Zakspeed, one of the two last German Formula One teams based in Germany (with the Rial Racing&#x27;s base in Fußgönheim).

== Racing history ==

Günter Schmid, ex-owner of the ATS company that competed in Formula One for eight years, bought Rial in 1987, ahead of the reduction in power of the turbo-engines in 1988, and set up a Formula One team at Rial&#x27;s base in Fußgönheim. With old-ATS designer Gustav Brunner, Schmid produced the Rial ARC1, powered by a Cosworth DFZ engine, an updated model of the ubiquitous design of the pre-turbo seasons. The ARC1, nicknamed the &quot;Blue Ferrari&quot; due to the similarities with the Brunner-designed Ferrari F1/87, featured a double wishbone pullrod suspension, with shock absorbers innovatively placed horizontally against the chassis. Andrea de Cesaris, with Marlboro sponsorship was hired to drive the car, which proved strong in testing due to a small fuel tank.

At Rial&#x27;s début race, the 1988 Brazilian Grand Prix, de Cesaris qualified 14th and reached sixth place in the race, but he ran out of fuel seven laps from the end. Mechanical failures occurred during the following races, and Rial twice breached regulations; for working on the car on-track and the drivers head being above the roll bar - necessitating a modification of the car. The fuel tank was again a problem in Canada where de Cesaris ran out of fuel in fifth place; however the next race in Detroit saw Rial finish in fourth place, scoring three points. After the , the team&#x27;s performance began to fall, and Brunner left the team after finishing 13th in their home race in Germany. Continuous mechanical problems and the fuel tank contributed to a six-race string of retirements, de Cesaris finishing the season classified 8th in Australia. The team finished in ninth place in the constructors championship, and Andrea de Cesaris was placed fifteenth in the drivers championship.

Rial expanded to two cars ahead of the 1989 season, and with de Cesaris moving to Dallara, German drivers Christian Danner and Volker Weidler were hired to drive the ARC2. Designed by new engineer Stefan Fober, the car was an updated version of the ARC1, with reworked aerodynamics by McLaren designer Bob Bell, and the improved Cosworth DFR engine being worked into the chassis. With turbo-charged engines banned for 1989, the entry list had increased to 39 cars from 20 teams; to accommodate the number of cars a pre-qualifying system was introduced, where the new cars and the teams ranked lowest in the previous season would compete for the 30 spaces available in qualifying, and then for the 26 starters in the race. Danner did not have to pre-qualify, while Weidler driving the new entry had to enter the session.

Danner achieved a 14th place at the opening Brazilian round, before the improving cars of Rial&#x27;s competitors forced Danner out of qualifying for the next two races, hampered by the older ARC2 chassis. The fifth race, the on the Phoenix street circuit, saw Danner finish in fourth place, in a similar attritional race to the year before, giving him the best result of his career. Weidler meanwhile had failed to pre-qualify for any race so far in the season, and following Danner&#x27;s 8th-place finish in Canada in what was to be Rial&#x27;s final race start, neither driver qualified for the following Grands Prix, despite both Rial cars being allowed to enter qualifying following the changing of pre-qualifying rankings after the . At the Hungarian race, where an illegal rear wing saw Weidler&#x27;s qualifying times deleted, both Fober and Weidler left the team following the blame by Schmid for the imposed fine. Pierre-Henri Raphanel was his replacement, bringing with him new designer Christian van der Pleyn. However the new design team could not improve the ARC2 to qualify for a race, and Danner quit following the . Gregor Foitek was brought in for Spain, but a rear wing breakage during qualifying caused an accident destroying his car, and he immediately left the team. Bertrand Gachot took over for the final two races, but neither Raphanel nor Gachot managed to qualify to race, with the outdated car several seconds off the nearest competitors in qualifying. Finishing 13th in the championship, Rial Racing closed down at the end of the year.

<doc id="1262629" wikidata="Q1077805" url="?curid=1262629" title="Shannon Racing Cars">
<text>Shannon Racing Cars was a Formula One constructor from the United Kingdom with Aiden Jones, formerly a mechanic for Prince Bira and Prince Chula, and Paul Emery as the principals. Using a car built by former Emeryson designer Emery and an old Coventry Climax engine, they participated in a single Grand Prix. Trevor Taylor drove for the team at the 1966 British Grand Prix, retiring early in the race. The car was then used for Formula 3 until 1969.

== SH1 ==
The only F1 chassis Shannon Racing Cars made had steel monocoque frame, upper and lower wishbone front suspension with outboard brake, and anti-roll bar. It was a very compact design with an upper I arm and lower reversed A arm with upper and lower radius arms mated with an outboard spring/damper unit, outboard brake, and anti-roll bar in the rear. The rear arm of the front upper A arm was much thicker than the front tube, acting as a canti-lever to operate the inboard spring/damper unit mounted vertically. The monocoque extended to the rear of the engine, with the gearbox sticking out further aft. Another monocoque tub was made in aluminium, but was never used.

The Coventry Climax 2.5-litre FPE Godiva V8 engine used in the Shannon had been built 12 years earlier in 1954 for Kieft F1, but was not released for a lack of proper fuel injection. The entire stock of parts was sold to Andrew Getley, who permitted Paul Emery to convert one unit to the 1966 3-litre F1 format, which required it to run on pump fuel as opposed to the original alcohol.

Paul Emery bored out the engine, used a Tecalemit Jackson fuel injection, and the 2-valve gear-driven DOHC 3-litre crossplane V8 made 312 bhp at Chrysler&#x27;s dynamometer located in Kew.

The SH1 arrived at Brands Hatch with Syd Fox as the driver, who drove on the practice day. 
Pannier fuel tanks were installed overnight to cope with the fuel consumption of the 3-litre engine. However, the decision was made to offer the seat to Trevor Taylor, who qualified and started the race. After one lap, one of the pannier tanks developed a leak, and the car was retired.

A petrol company sponsorship was promised but fell through, and SH1 received a 1-litre Cosworth MAE built by Holbay (later by EMC Motorsport), fitted with two twin-choke diagonal throat sand-cast Weber carburettors for Formula 3 racing. This car participated in many F3 races in the hands of John Wilson and Keith Jupp until 1969. Wilson later recalled the car handled better than the competition that had two or three years newer designs. 

The subsequent owner of SH1 obtained a Climax FPE from Gordon Chapman, then owner of the FPE parts, and the car and the engine are said to be in Austria with Mr. Burkhardt List along with a collection of Emeryson racing cars.

<doc id="1262631" wikidata="Q173088" url="?curid=1262631" title="Spirit Racing">
<text>Spirit Racing was a racing car constructor and racing team from the United Kingdom. Founded in 1981, it participated in the 1982 European Formula Two Championship, moved to Formula One in (staying to the end of the season), then competing in the 1988 F3000 season before finally folding at the end of that year. In 26 F1 races (including the non-championship 1983 Race of Champions), its best finish was seventh at the 1983 Dutch Grand Prix.

==Formula Two==

Spirit Racing was founded in August 1981 by ex-March employees Gordon Coppuck and John Wickham with backing from Bridgestone and Honda, who were keen to re-enter Formula One as an engine supplier. The initial plan was to participate in the 1982 European Formula Two Championship, and so ex-McLaren designer John Baldwin was hired to produce the Spirit 201 chassis with Coppuck, to be powered by a naturally-aspirated 2-litre Honda V6 engine. With sponsorship from Marlboro and capable drivers in Stefan Johansson and Thierry Boutsen, the car was an immediate success, taking pole position in eight of the 13 rounds of the championship, while Boutsen won three times and challenged for the title before losing out in the final round to the March of Corrado Fabi.

==Formula One==

Before the F2 championship was over, Honda had built prototypes for a turbocharged Formula One engine. After a dummy unit was sent to Spirit, the team modified one of its 201 chassis to meet F1 regulations, and began a testing programme with the new engine in November 1982 at Silverstone, with plans to join the F1 World Championship midway through the 1983 season. Honda were anxious to keep a low profile – much as they had been when they had first entered F1 two decades earlier – and so the team avoided testing at the same time as other F1 teams, while also taking its programme to Willow Springs and Riverside in California. Then, when the decision was made to enter one car into the World Championship, Johansson was chosen as the driver – he was seen as a faded talent having made a disappointing F1 debut for Shadow in 1980, whereas Boutsen was seen as a star of the future.

After a further test at Jacarepaguá, the team made its competitive F1 debut in April 1983, at the non-championship Race of Champions at Brands Hatch. In a field of 13 cars, Johansson set the second-fastest time in free practice, but suffered engine problems in qualifying and started 12th. He then retired early with a punctured radiator following a collision with the Theodore of Roberto Guerrero. Following this, the team resumed its testing programme, with sessions at Silverstone, Brands Hatch and Donington Park, before making its World Championship debut in July at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Driving a further revision of the F2 car, the 201C, Johansson qualified 14th out of 29 cars despite continued engine problems, and ran strongly in the early stages before retiring with a broken fuel pump.

The team then continued in the championship until the penultimate race of the season, the European Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. Johansson tended to qualify ahead of most of the naturally-aspirated cars, and finished seventh at Zandvoort, but mechanical problems continued to blight the car. In the meantime, the team was building its first purpose-designed F1 car, the 101, but at the same time, Honda were showing concern at the lack of progress and were being courted by Williams, who offered a record of success. Following a disastrous weekend for Spirit at Monza, where the 101 was presented but not driven and Johansson suffered another early retirement, the Japanese company decided to supply its engines to Williams only, and Spirit thus missed the final race of the season at Kyalami.

Spirit decided to continue in 1984 with Hart turbocharged engines. Initially twice world champion Emerson Fittipaldi and moneyed Italian Fulvio Ballabio were slated to drive. However Fittipaldi left to find a drive in Indy car racing after finding the machine uncompetitive and Ballabio was refused a Super Licence. Instead Mauro Baldi found funds and was nominated as the team&#x27;s sole driver, Johansson being released as he could not find the funding to continue. The 101 was a neat but underpowered car and Baldi struggled to move away from the rear of the grid. Jean-Louis Schlesser had planned to take over from the third race before the threat of litigation from RAM (still owed money by the Frenchman) saw Baldi stay until Huub Rothengatter took over. When the Dutchman&#x27;s money ran out Baldi found enough funds to complete the season. The team&#x27;s best result was 8th place, scored by Baldi on three occasions and Rothengatter once.

The 101 chassis (having been progressively upgraded throughout 1984) was updated again for 1985 and Baldi continued to drive. Allen Berg had arranged a deal to take over the seat later in the season. Money was even tighter, however, and after three rounds Wickham decided to take up an offer from Toleman to buy out the team&#x27;s tyre contract and folded the F1 outfit. Wickham initially promised to be back with a new car in 1986 but that never happened.

==Formula 3000==

Spirit briefly resurfaced in Formula 3000 in 1988, running Bertrand Gachot, Steve Kempton and Paolo Barilla with some success, but co-founder Wickham left the outfit midway through the season and the team folded at the end of the year.

<text>Tec-Mec (full name Studio Tecnica Meccanica) was a Formula One constructor from Italy. Founded by former Maserati designer Valerio Colotti in 1958, they participated in a single Grand Prix, scoring no World Championship points.

==History==
Tec-Mec used an improved, lightened version of the Maserati 250F, named the F415. The car was upgraded by the 250F&#x27;s designer, Colotti, and financed by Lloyd Casner of Camoradi International. The team made its single outing in the 1959 United States Grand Prix, but the car, driven by Fritz d&#x27;Orey lasted six laps before retiring, having qualified 17th on the grid ahead of only the midget racer of Rodger Ward.

Colotti sold the design studio at the end of the year to found Colotti Trasmissioni, and the company continued to produce cars for the Formula Junior series.

<text>Tecno is an Italian kart and former racing car constructor based in Bologna. It won the European Formula Two Championship in 1970 and became a Formula One constructor, participating in 10 grands prix and scoring one championship point.

==History==

Tecno started out as an engineering business in Bologna manufacturing hydraulic pumps. In 1961, the company&#x27;s owners, brothers Luciano and Gianfranco Pederzani, decided to enter motor sport as constructors of karts. In 1966 the company moved on up into car racing with Formula 3. Swiss driver Clay Regazzoni scored Tecno&#x27;s first international win in Spain in 1967 and by the end of the year Tecno had won 32 of the season&#x27;s 65 major F3 races. Tecno was the first company to build an offset (&#x27;sidewinder&#x27;) kart chassis to take advantage of the newly developed air-cooled rotary motors produced by Parilla. Tecno&#x27;s first chassis was named the Kaimano (a play on the Italian word for the Camen crocodile and the source of the logo). The Kaimano&#x27;s design was based on the American rear-engine karts of the early 1960s. The second chassis, the Piuma (&#x27;Feather&#x27;), revolutionized karting design, and was so successful that it won the World Championships in 1964, 1965 and 1966. In 1969 Ronnie Peterson drove for the team, winning 15 races. In 1970 Tecno debuted in Formula 2 and won that year&#x27;s championship with Regazzoni.

Tecno&#x27;s success in junior formulae stirred the interest of Count Teofilo Guiscardo Rossi di Montelera (of Martini &amp; Rossi fame), who became a partner and title sponsor of the Pederzani brothers in an attempt to build a Formula One car and engine. 

Tecno&#x27;s Formula One car made its first competitive appearance at the 1972 Belgian Grand Prix in the hands of Nanni Galli. The team chose to adopt the colour red for the chassis, partly to honour the long-standing tradition of Italian racing teams competing with that tonality, and partly to better accommodate their title sponsor. The engine, designed by Luciano Pederzani, Renato Armaroli and Giuseppe Bocchi, was a flat-twelve engine very similar to the contemporary Ferrari unit, although apparently considerably less powerful. Galli managed to finish third in the non-championship 1972 Italian Republic Grand Prix in Vallelunga, but he wouldn&#x27;t score points for the rest of the season. For the Italian Grand Prix Tecno fielded a second car driven by Derek Bell. Although Galli outqualified Bell, team manager David Yorke elected to retain Bell for the final two races in North America, terminating Galli&#x27;s involvement with the company.
In 1973, serious disagreements between the Pederzani brothers and Rossi and Yorke over the sporting and technical direction of the team generated a fracture that the two parties were never able to fully recompose. The Pederzanis were interested in hiring Clay Regazzoni, then a relatively new prospect, whereas Rossi and Yorke wanted the expert Chris Amon, who had been unable to agree terms with March Engineering for the season. Yorke and Rossi commissioned a new chassis from designer Gordon Fowell, while the Pederzanis hired Alan McCall to design a new car. McCall left before the project was fully developed, and the car was completed by Ron Tauranac, who was freelancing after selling Brabham at the end of 1972. 

After missing the early-season races due to the internal turmoil, Tecno finally debuted with the McCall/Tauranac car at the Belgian Grand Prix, where Amon finished sixth, achieving the team&#x27;s first and only point. The car continued to show good promise in its second outing at the drivers circuit of Monaco, where Amon qualified 12th, in front of Jacky Ickx&#x27;s Ferrari, and ran well in the upper midfield for 25 laps. 

At the British Grand Prix, Tecno found itself in the peculiar position of having two different cars available, with both the Fowell &quot;Goral&quot; car and the McCall/Tauranac car in the garage. Amon qualified last. He managed to escape the multiple collision triggered by Jody Scheckter during the opening stages of the race that took out nine cars but had to retire with a broken fuel pump after six laps. Amon moved up to qualify 23rd for the Dutch Grand Prix but he had to retire again after 22 laps with the same technical problem. 
Having two different, underfunded and underdeveloped cars competing with scarce resources made the team&#x27;s struggle untenable, and by the Austrian Grand Prix, the ongoing dispute between the Pederzanis and Yorke and Rossi resulted in a discontented Amon leaving the team to drive for Tyrrell. Despite having commissioned an eight-cylinder engine for the following year, the Pederzanis decided to shut down the Formula One program. Rossi took the Martini &amp; Rossi sponsorship to Brabham in 1974, and eventually established the racing brand Martini Racing; Luciano and Gianfranco Pederzani retired from the sport, citing the toxic atmosphere that pervaded the team in 1973 as the main cause of their disillusionment.
