<text>Micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) is a chromatography technique used in analytical chemistry. It is a modification of capillary electrophoresis (CE), extending its functionality to neutral analytes, where the samples are separated by differential partitioning between micelles (pseudo-stationary phase) and a surrounding aqueous buffer solution (mobile phase).

The basic set-up and detection methods used for MEKC are the same as those used in CE. The difference is that the solution contains a surfactant at a concentration that is greater than the critical micelle concentration (CMC). Above this concentration, surfactant monomers are in equilibrium with micelles.

In most applications, MEKC is performed in open capillaries under alkaline conditions to generate a strong electroosmotic flow. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is the most commonly used surfactant in MEKC applications. The anionic character of the sulfate groups of SDS causes the surfactant and micelles to have electrophoretic mobility that is counter to the direction of the strong electroosmotic flow. As a result, the surfactant monomers and micelles migrate quite slowly, though their net movement is still toward the cathode. During a MEKC separation, analytes distribute themselves between the hydrophobic interior of the micelle and hydrophilic buffer solution as shown in &quot;figure 1&quot;. 

Analytes that are insoluble in the interior of micelles should migrate at the electroosmotic flow velocity, formula_1, and be detected at the retention time of the buffer, formula_2. Analytes that solubilize completely within the micelles (analytes that are highly hydrophobic) should migrate at the micelle velocity, formula_3, and elute at the final elution time, formula_4.

== Theory ==
The micelle velocity is defined by:

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the electrophoretic velocity of a micelle.

The retention time of a given sample should depend on the capacity factor, formula_7:

:formula_8

where formula_9 is the total number of moles of solute in the micelle and formula_10 is the total moles in the aqueous phase. The retention time of a solute should then be within the range:

:formula_11

Charged analytes have a more complex interaction in the capillary because they exhibit electrophoretic mobility, engage in electrostatic interactions with the micelle, and participate in hydrophobic partitioning.

The fraction of the sample in the aqueous phase, formula_12, is given by:

:formula_13

where formula_14 is the migration velocity of the solute. The value formula_12 can also be expressed in terms of the capacity factor:

:formula_16

Using the relationship between velocity, tube length from the injection end to the detector cell (formula_17), and retention time, formula_18, formula_19 and formula_20, a relationship between the capacity factor and retention times can be formulated:

:formula_21

The extra term enclosed in parentheses accounts for the partial mobility of the hydrophobic phase in MEKC. This equation resembles an expression derived for formula_7 in conventional packed bed chromatography:

:formula_23

A rearrangement of the previous equation can be used to write an expression for the retention factor:

:formula_24

From this equation it can be seen that all analytes that partition strongly into the micellar phase (where formula_7 is essentially ∞) migrate at the same time, formula_4. In conventional chromatography, separation of similar compounds can be improved by gradient elution. In MEKC, however, techniques must be used to extend the elution range to separate strongly retained analytes.

Elution ranges can be extended by several techniques including the use of organic modifiers, cyclodextrins, and mixed micelle systems. Short-chain alcohols or acetonitrile can be used as organic modifiers that decrease formula_2 and formula_7 to improve the resolution of analytes that co-elute with the micellar phase. These agents, however, may alter the level of the EOF. Cyclodextrins are cyclic polysaccharides that form inclusion complexes that can cause competitive hydrophobic partitioning of the analyte. Since analyte-cyclodextrin complexes are neutral, they will migrate toward the cathode at a higher velocity than that of the negatively charged micelles. Mixed micelle systems, such as the one formed by combining SDS with the non-ionic surfactant Brij-35, can also be used to alter the selectivity of MEKC.

==Applications==
The simplicity and efficiency of MEKC have made it an attractive technique for a variety of applications. Further improvements can be made to the selectivity of MEKC by adding chiral selectors or chiral surfactants to the system. Unfortunately, this technique is not suitable for protein analysis because proteins are generally too large to partition into a surfactant micelle and tend to bind to surfactant monomers to form SDS-protein complexes.

Recent applications of MEKC include the analysis of uncharged pesticides, essential and branched-chain amino acids in nutraceutical products, hydrocarbon and alcohol contents of the marjoram herb.

MEKC has also been targeted for its potential to be used in combinatorial chemical analysis. The advent of combinatorial chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to synthesize and identify large numbers of potential drugs in relatively short periods of time. Small sample and solvent requirements and the high resolving power of MEKC have enabled this technique to be used to quickly analyze a large number of compounds with good resolution.

Traditional methods of analysis, like high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), can be used to identify the purity of a combinatorial library, but assays need to be rapid with good resolution for all components to provide useful information for the chemist. The introduction of surfactant to traditional capillary electrophoresis instrumentation has dramatically expanded the scope of analytes that can be separated by capillary electrophoresis.

MEKC can also be used in routine quality control of antibiotics in pharmaceuticals or feedstuffs.

<text>John Carter MacLean (born November 20, 1964) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player. He is the assistant coach for the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL). He spent the majority of his playing career as a member of the New Jersey Devils, and also spent time with the San Jose Sharks, New York Rangers and Dallas Stars.

==Playing career==
As a youth, MacLean played in the 1977 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Oshawa.

MacLean was selected 6th overall in the 1983 NHL entry draft. He was selected as the 1st choice of the New Jersey Devils. MacLean made his Devils debut on October 5, 1983 against the New York Rangers. Perhaps his most memorable moment as a Devil came on April 3, 1988, when he scored a goal in overtime against the Chicago Blackhawks to send the Devils to the playoffs for the first time. Following this breakthrough year, MacLean notched three straight 40-goal seasons before he was forced to miss the 1991–92 season due to a serious knee injury sustained during a preseason game. During his tenure with the Devils, MacLean won the Stanley Cup in 1995 while serving as the team&#x27;s alternate captain. He remained with the Devils until December 7, 1997 when he was traded to the San Jose Sharks. After finishing the 1997–98 season with the Sharks, MacLean signed as a free agent with the New York Rangers on July 9, 1998. The Rangers traded MacLean to the Dallas Stars in February 2001.

On June 7, 2002, MacLean retired from hockey after 18 seasons. He played a total 1,194 games, scoring 413 goals, adding 429 assists for 842 career points, and was the all-time leading scorer for the New Jersey Devils until March 17, 2009, when his record was surpassed by Patrik Eliáš.

MacLean has been a resident of Verona, New Jersey since 1991.

==Coaching career==
In September 2002, MacLean joined the coaching staff of the New Jersey Devils, and served as an assistant coach until July 2009. He earned his second Stanley Cup, as an assistant coach, in 2003. In 2007, he was a candidate for the head coach position but the job was given to Brent Sutter, and MacLean remained as assistant coach.

On June 9, 2009, Brent Sutter resigned as head coach of the Devils and remarked that MacLean was ready to be head coach. On July 13, 2009, MacLean was named head coach of the Lowell Devils.

On June 17, 2010, MacLean was named head coach of the New Jersey Devils.

On December 23, 2010, the Devils were sporting a 9–22–2 record and sitting in last place in the Eastern Conference. MacLean was fired from his coaching position and was replaced by Jacques Lemaire.

On December 1, 2011, the Carolina Hurricanes, after hiring Kirk Muller as their new head coach, hired MacLean as an assistant coach. MacLean, along with fellow assistant coach Dave Lewis, was relieved of his duties on May 5, 2014.

On July 27, 2017, MacLean joined the Arizona Coyotes as an assistant coach.

On September 8, 2021, the San Jose Sharks hired MacLean as an assistant coach. He was relieved of his duties on July 1, 2022.

On July 28, 2022, MacLean was hired as an assistant coach by the New York Islanders.

==Post-playing career==
In addition to working as an analyst on NHL Network, MacLean most recently served as a hockey analyst for MSG Networks, including the pre- and post-game coverage for the Devils.

<doc id="1232957" wikidata="Q261968" url="?curid=1232957" title="Isocitrate dehydrogenase">
<text>Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) () and () is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, producing alpha-ketoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate) and CO2. This is a two-step process, which involves oxidation of isocitrate (a secondary alcohol) to oxalosuccinate (a ketone), followed by the decarboxylation of the carboxyl group beta to the ketone, forming alpha-ketoglutarate. In humans, IDH exists in three isoforms: IDH3 catalyzes the third step of the citric acid cycle while converting NAD+ to NADH in the mitochondria. The isoforms IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the same reaction outside the context of the citric acid cycle and use NADP+ as a cofactor instead of NAD+. They localize to the cytosol as well as the mitochondrion and peroxisome.

== Structure ==
The NAD-IDH is composed of 3 subunits, is allosterically regulated, and requires an integrated Mg2+ or Mn2+ ion. The closest homologue that has a known structure is the &quot;E. coli&quot; NADP-dependent IDH, which has only 2 subunits and a 13% identity and 29% similarity based on the amino acid sequences, making it dissimilar to human IDH and not suitable for close comparison. All the known NADP-IDHs are homodimers.

Most isocitrate dehydrogenases are dimers, to be specific, homodimers (two identical monomer subunits forming one dimeric unit). In comparing &quot;C. glutamicum&quot; and &quot;E. coli&quot;, monomer and dimer, respectively, both enzymes were found to &quot;efficiently catalyze identical reactions.&quot; However, &quot;C. glutamicum&quot; was recorded as having ten times as much activity than &quot;E. coli&quot; and seven times more affinitive/specific for NADP. &quot;C. glutamicum&quot; favored NADP+ over NAD+. In terms of stability with response to temperature, both enzymes had a similar Tm or melting temperature at about 55 °C to 60 °C. However, the monomer &quot;C. glutamicum&quot; showed a more consistent stability at higher temperatures, which was expected. The dimer &quot;E. coli&quot; showed stability at a higher temperature than normal due to the interactions between the two monomeric subunits.

The structure of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; (Mtb) ICDH-1 bound with NADPH and Mn(2+) bound has been solved by X-ray crystallography. It is a homodimer in which each subunit has a Rossmann fold, and a common top domain of interlocking β sheets. Mtb ICDH-1 is most structurally similar to the R132H mutant human ICDH found in CNS WHO grade 4 astrocytomas, formerly classified as glioblastomas. Similar to human R132H ICDH, Mtb ICDH-1 also catalyzes the formation of α-hydroxyglutarate.

== Regulation ==

The IDH step of the citric acid cycle is often (but not always) an irreversible reaction due to its large negative change in free energy. It must therefore be carefully regulated to avoid depletion of isocitrate (and therefore an accumulation of alpha-ketoglutarate). The reaction is stimulated by the simple mechanisms of substrate availability (isocitrate, NAD+ or NADP+, Mg2+ / Mn2+ ), product inhibition by NADH (or NADPH outside the citric acid cycle) and alpha-ketoglutarate, and competitive feedback inhibition by ATP. A conserved ncRNA upstream of the &quot;icd&quot; gene which codes for NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) has been reported in bacterial genomes, due to its characteristics this ncRNA resembles previous regulatory motifs called riboswitches, icd-II ncRNA motif has been proposed as a strong candidate riboswitch.

== Catalytic mechanisms ==
Isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyzes the chemical reactions:
:Isocitrate + NAD+ formula_1 2-oxoglutarate + CO2 + NADH + H+
:Isocitrate + NADP+ formula_1 2-oxoglutarate + CO2 + NADPH + H+

The overall free energy for this reaction is -8.4 kJ/mol.

=== Steps ===

Within the citric acid cycle, isocitrate, produced from the isomerization of citrate, undergoes both oxidation and decarboxylation. The enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) holds isocitrate within its active site using the surrounding amino acids, including arginine, tyrosine, asparagine, serine, threonine, and aspartic acid.

In the provided figure, the first box shows the overall isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction. The necessary reactants for this enzyme mechanism are isocitrate, NAD+/NADP+, and Mn2+ or Mg2+. The products of the reaction are alpha-ketoglutarate, carbon dioxide, and NADH + H+/NADPH + H+. Water molecules help to deprotonate the oxygen atoms of isocitrate.

The second box in the figure illustrates step 1 of the reaction, which is the oxidation of the alpha-carbon (C2 here, also called alpha-C). In this process, the alcohol group of the alpha-carbon is deprotonated and the resulting lone pair of electrons forms a ketone group on that carbon. NAD+/NADP+ acts as an electron-accepting cofactor and collects the resulting hydride from C2. The oxidation of the alpha carbon introduces a molecular arrangement where electrons (in the next step) will flow from the nearby carboxyl group and push the electrons of the double bonded oxygen up onto the oxygen atom itself, which collects a proton from a nearby lysine.

The third box illustrates step 2, which is the decarboxylation of oxalosuccinate. In this step, the carboxyl group oxygen is deprotonated by a nearby tyrosine, and those electrons flow down to C2. Carbon dioxide, the leaving group, detaches from the beta carbon of isocitrate (C3) and the electrons flow to the ketone oxygen attached to the alpha carbon, granting a negative charge to the associated oxygen atom and forming an alpha-beta unsaturated double bond between carbons 2 and 3.

The fourth and final box illustrates step 3, which is the saturation of the alpha-beta unsaturated double bond that formed in the previous step. The negatively charged oxygen (attached to the alpha-carbon) donates its electrons, reforming the ketone double bond and pushing another lone pair (the one that forms the double bond between the alpha and beta carbons) &quot;off&quot; the molecule. This lone pair, in turn, picks up a proton from the nearby tyrosine.&lt;ref name=&quot;nfr154197/32&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction results in the formation of alpha-ketoglutarate, NADH + H+/NADPH + H+, and CO2.

=== Detailed mechanism ===

Two aspartate amino acid residues (below left) are interacting with two adjacent water molecules (w6 and w8) in the Mn2+ isocitrate porcine IDH complex to deprotonate the alcohol off the alpha-carbon atom. The oxidation of the alpha-C also takes place in this picture where NAD+ accepts a hydride resulting in oxalosuccinate. Along with the sp3 to sp2 stereochemical change around the alpha-C, there is a ketone group that is formed from the alcohol group. The formation of this ketone double bond allows for resonance to take place as electrons coming down from the leaving carboxylate group move towards the ketone.

The decarboxylation of oxalosuccinate (below center) is a key step in the formation of alpha-ketoglutarate. In this reaction, the lone pair on the adjacent Tyrosine hydroxyl abstracts the proton off the carboxyl group. This carboxyl group is also referred to as the beta subunit in the isocitrate molecule. The deprotonation of the carboxyl group causes the lone pair of electrons to move down making carbon dioxide and separating from oxalosuccinate. The electrons continue to move towards the alpha carbon pushing the double bond electrons (making the ketone) up to abstract a proton off an adjacent lysine residue. An alpha-beta unsaturated double bond results between carbon 2 and three. As you can see in the picture, the green ion represents either Mg2+ or Mn2+, which is a cofactor necessary for this reaction to occur. The metal-ion forms a little complex through ionic interactions with the oxygen atoms on the fourth and fifth carbons (also known as the gamma subunit of isocitrate).

After the carbon dioxide is split from the oxalosuccinate in the decarboxylation step (below right), the enol will tautomerize to the keto from. The formation of the ketone double bond is started by the deprotonation of that oxygen off the alpha carbon (C#2) by the same lysine that protonated the oxygen in the first place. The lone pair of electrons moves down kicking off the lone pairs that were making the double bond. This lone pair of electrons abstracts a proton off the Tyrosine that deprotonated the carboxyl group in the decarboxylation step. The reason that we can say that the Lys and Tyr residues will be the same from the previous step is because they are helping in holding the isocitrate molecule in the active site of the enzyme. These two residues will be able to form hydrogen bonds back and forth as long as they are close enough to the substrate.

The isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme as stated above produces alpha-ketoglutarate, carbon dioxide, and NADH + H+/NADPH + H+. There are three changes that occurred throughout the reaction. The oxidation of Carbon 2, the decarboxylation (loss of carbon dioxide) off Carbon 3, and the formation of a ketone group with a stereochemical change from sp3 to sp2.

=== Active site ===
The Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) enzyme structure in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; was the first IDH ortholog structure to be elucidated and understood. Since then, the &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; IDH structure has been used by most researchers to make comparisons to other isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes. There is much detailed knowledge about this bacterial enzyme, and it has been found that most isocitrate dehydrogenases are similar in structure and therefore also in function. This similarity of structure and function gives a reason to believe that the structures are conserved as well as the amino acids. Therefore, the active sites amongst most prokaryotic isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes should be conserved as well, which is observed throughout many studies done on prokaryotic enzymes. Eukaryotic isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes on the other hand, have not been fully discovered yet.
Each dimer of IDH has two active sites. Each active site binds a NAD+/NADP+ molecule and a divalent metal ion (Mg2+,Mn2+). In general, each active site has a conserved sequence of amino acids for each specific binding site. In &quot;Desulfotalea psychrophila&quot; (&quot;Dp&quot;IDH) and porcine (&quot;Pc&quot;IDH) there are three substrates bound to the active site.

# Isocitrate binds within the active site to a conserved sequence of about eight amino acids through hydrogen bonds. These acids include (may vary in residue but with similar properties) tyrosine, serine, asparagine, arginine, arginine, arginine, tyrosine, and lysine. Their positions on the backbone vary but they are all within a close range (i.e. Arg131 DpIDH and Arg133 PcIDH, Tyr138 DpIDH and Tyr140 PcIDH).
# The metal ion (Mg2+, Mn2+) binds to three conserved amino acids through hydrogen bonds. These amino acids include three Aspartate residues.
# NAD+ and NADP+ bind within the active site within four regions with similar properties amongst IDH enzymes. These regions vary but are around [250–260], [280–290], [300–330], and [365–380]. Again regions vary but the proximity of regions are conserved.

== Clinical significance ==

Specific mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene IDH1 have been found in several tumor types, notably brain tumors including astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma. Patients whose tumor had an IDH1 mutation had longer survival compared to patients whose tumor had an IDH1 wild type. Furthermore, mutations of IDH2 and IDH1 were found in up to 20% of cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations are known to produce D-2-hydroxyglutarate from alpha-ketoglutarate. D-2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates to very high concentrations which inhibits the function of enzymes that are dependent on alpha-ketoglutarate. This leads to a hypermethylated state of DNA and histones, which results in different gene expression that can activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor-suppressor genes. Ultimately, this may lead to the types of cancer described above. Somatic mosaic mutations of this gene have also been found associated to Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome. However, recent studies have also shown that D-2-hydroxyglutarate may be converted back into alpha-ketoglutarate either enzymatically or non-enzymatically. Further studies are required to fully understand the roles of IDH1 mutation (and D-2-hydroxyglutarate) in cancer. Recent research highlighted cancer-causing mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase which may cause accumulation of the metabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). Notarangelo et al. showed that such high concentrations of D-2HG could act as a direct inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase in mouse T cells. Inhibition of this metabolic enzyme altered glucose metabolism in the T cells and inhibited their proliferation, cytokine production, and ability to kill target cells.

<text>She Who Dwells in the Secret Place of the Most High Shall Abide Under the Shadow of the Almighty is a 2003 double album by Sinéad O&#x27;Connor.

It is a two-CD set. The first CD collects several rare tracks O&#x27;Connor recorded as B-sides, for soundtrack albums or in collaboration with other artists, and the second disc contains a live concert.

The album&#x27;s title is a modification of . This is the same psalm that gave O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Lion and the Cobra&quot;, its name.

<text>David Trotter Patterson (February 28, 1818November 3, 1891) was a United States Senator from Tennessee at the beginning of the Reconstruction period.

A staunch Union supporter (as were most of his fellow East Tennesseans), he was elected by the Tennessee General Assembly to the U.S. Senate when Tennessee was readmitted to the Union on July 24, 1866, the first state of the former Confederacy to do so. He presented his credentials to the Senate on July 26, but they were challenged; he was not permitted to take the oath of office until July 28.

==Early life and education==
David Trotter Patterson was born at Cedar Creek, near Greeneville, Tennessee, on February 28, 1818. He attended the common schools and later Greeneville College for two years. He studied law with a local attorney to prepare for a legal career.

==Career==
After being admitted to the bar in 1841, Patterson practiced in Greeneville. He also engaged in manufacturing. He owned slaves. He was appointed as a judge of the first circuit court of Tennessee and served from 1854 to 1863. In addition, he acquired substantial amounts of land in East Tennessee and grew commodity crops.

==Marriage and family==
On December 13, 1855, Patterson married Martha Johnson, daughter of Andrew Johnson and Eliza McCardle. They had two children, a son named Andrew (1857–1932), and a daughter named Mary (1859–1891).

==Political career==
A Unionist from East Tennessee, Patterson was elected by the Tennessee General Assembly to the U.S. Senate when Tennessee became the first Confederate state to be readmitted to the Union on July 24, 1866. His father-in-law Andrew Johnson had succeeded as President of the United States following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination the year before.

Johnson was impeached by the United States House of Representatives in February 1868, which caused Patterson personal conflict. According to the U.S. Constitution, the Senate had the duty to try Johnson on the charges, and did so from March to May 1868. Their vote was one short of the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority for conviction. Patterson believed that his father-in-law was not guilty and that the charges against him were contrived. In the decades since the impeachment, historians generally have agreed to a consensus with the same conclusion, but some disagreed.

==Post-political career==
Patterson retired from public life when his Senate term expired on March 3, 1869. He returned to East Tennessee to manage his relatively vast agricultural interests.

On November 3, 1891, Patterson died in the small community of Afton. He was interred with the Johnson family in the Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in Greeneville.

<doc id="1232963" wikidata="Q6398558" url="?curid=1232963" title="Keyword spotting">
<text>Keyword spotting (or more simply, word spotting) is a problem that was historically first defined in the context of speech processing.
In speech processing, keyword spotting deals with the identification of keywords in utterances.

Keyword spotting is also defined as a separate, but related, problem in the context of document image processing.
In document image processing, keyword spotting is the problem of finding all instances of a query word that exist in a scanned document image, without fully recognizing it.

==In speech processing==

The first works in keyword spotting appeared in the late 1980s.

A special case of keyword spotting is wake word (also called hot word) detection used by personal digital assistants such as Alexa or Siri to activate the dormant speaker, in other words &quot;wake up&quot; when their name is spoken. 

In the United States, the National Security Agency has made use of keyword spotting since at least 2006. This technology allows analysts to search through large volumes of recorded conversations and isolate mentions of suspicious keywords. Recordings can be indexed and analysts can run queries over the database to find conversations of interest. IARPA funded research into keyword spotting in the Babel program.

Some algorithms used for this task are:
* Sliding window and garbage model
* K-best hypothesis
* Iterative Viterbi decoding
* Convolutional neural network on Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients
* Transformer-based small-footprint keyword spotting

==In document image processing==

Keyword spotting in document image processing can be seen as an instance of the more generic problem of content-based image retrieval (CBIR).
Given a query, the goal is to retrieve the most relevant instances of words in a collection of scanned documents.
The query may be a text string (query-by-string keyword spotting) or a word image (query-by-example keyword spotting).

<doc id="1232967" wikidata="Q7872788" url="?curid=1232967" title="USS Pensacola (1859)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Pensacola&quot; was a screw steamer that served in the United States Navy during the U.S. Civil War.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Pensacola&quot; was launched by the Pensacola Navy Yard on August 15, 1859, and commissioned there on December 5, 1859, for towing to Washington Navy Yard for installation of machinery. She was decommissioned January 31, 1860, and commissioned in full on September 16, 1861, Captain Henry W. Morris in command.

==Service history==

===Civil War, 1862–1864===

&quot;Pensacola&quot; departed Alexandria, Virginia on January 11, 1862, for the Gulf of Mexico to join Admiral David Farragut&#x27;s newly created West Gulf Blockading Squadron. She steamed with that fleet in the historic dash past Confederate Fort St. Philip and Fort Jackson which protected New Orleans, Louisiana on April 24. The next day, &quot;Pensacola&quot; engaged batteries below that great Confederate metropolis. On April 26, a landing party of Marines raised the United States flag over the mint at New Orleans. Four of her sailors were awarded the Medal of Honor for their part in the battle: Boy Thomas Flood, Seaman Thomas Lyons, Captain of the Foretop James McLeod, and Quartermaster Louis Richards.

During the next two years, she helped guard the lower Mississippi River, returning to New York Navy Yard where she decommissioned April 29, 1864, for the installation of new and improved machinery originally intended for the cancelled sloop-of-war .

===Pacific Squadron, 1866–1884===
Recommissioned August 16, 1866, &quot;Pensacola&quot; sailed around Cape Horn to join the Pacific Squadron, serving from time to time as flagship. Her cruising ranged from Chile to Puget Sound and west to Hawaii. While in the harbor of Coquimbo, Chile, on 30 July 1873, Ordinary Seaman Patrick Regan jumped overboard and rescued a drowning shipmate, for which he was later awarded the Medal of Honor. But for two periods in ordinary, February 15, 1870 to October 14, 1871, and December 31, 1873 to July 13, 1874, &quot;Pensacola&quot; continued this duty until detached from the Pacific squadron in June 1883. Departing Callao, Peru on July 18, she sailed west across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, transited the Suez Canal, and steamed the length of the Mediterranean Sea before crossing the Atlantic to arrive in Hampton Roads on May 4, 1884. She decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia on May 23.

===Atlantic and Pacific, 1885–1892===
Recommissioned April 4, 1885, &quot;Pensacola&quot;, under the command of then Captain George Dewey, operated in European waters until returning to Norfolk in February 1888 for repairs. On April 7, 1889, she sank at Portsmouth Navy Yard when a drydock was inundated during a storm. Operations along the Atlantic Coast and a cruise along the coast of Africa ended when the ship returned to New York in May 1890. In August she headed back to familiar haunts in the Pacific, arriving in San Francisco on August 10, 1891. Following a visit to Hawaii, she decommissioned at Mare Island on April 18, 1892.

===Training and receiving ship, 1898–1911===
Recommissioned on November 22, 1898, &quot;Pensacola&quot; served as a training ship for Naval apprentices until going back into ordinary on May 31, 1899. She was back in commission July 14, 1901, subsequently used as receiving ship at Yerba Buena Training Station, San Francisco until finally decommissioning on December 6, 1911, and struck from the Navy Register on December 23. She was burned and sunk by the Navy in San Francisco Bay near Hunters Point early in May 1912.

<doc id="1232972" wikidata="Q572957" url="?curid=1232972" title="Club Alianza Lima">
<text>Club Alianza Lima, more commonly known as simply Alianza Lima, is a Peruvian professional sports club based in La Victoria District of Lima, Peru. The club was founded under the name of Sport Alianza on 15 February 1901 by working-class youth in the Chacaritas neighborhood of Lima. It is widely known for having one of the most historical and successful football teams in Peru; they have won a total of 25 league titles of the Peruvian Primera División and are currently the oldest team playing in that competition, since the club was founded in 1901. According to CONMEBOL, it is considered the most popular club in Peru, and the 6th most popular club in South America, with more than 12 million fans as of April 2016.

Alianza&#x27;s home stadium is the Estadio Alejandro Villanueva, named after Alejandro Villanueva, one of the most important players in the club&#x27;s history. The stadium is also popularly known as &quot;Matute&quot;, the name of the neighbourhood in which it is located. The stadium can hold up to 33,938 spectators.

Alianza Lima is one of the most successful Peruvian football clubs, with a total 59 official titles consisting of 25 Primera División titles, 31 domestic cup titles, 1 supercup, and 1 international cup, the Copa Simón Bolívar. The club has also won numerous regional and short league titles. Alianza enjoyed their most successful period throughout the first decades of their professional era. Their best international performance came in 1976 when they reached the semi-finals of the Copa Libertadores, repeating the feat in 1978. In 1987, tragedy struck Alianza when the entire squad and coaching staff died in an airplane crash as the team returned from an away fixture.

== History ==

=== Foundation &amp; early years ===
The club was founded under the name of Sport Alianza on 15 February 1901 by working-class youth in the Chacaritas neighborhood of Lima. The Alianza name was in reference to the Alianza Racing Horse Stud, where their first matches were played. The stud was located on the same street, Cotabambas, in Lima

The club is one of the oldest professional football teams in Peru. It was founded on 15 February 1901, as Sport Alianza, named for the stable that hosted its first games. It is the only surviving founding member of the Peruvian Football League, created as an amateur level league in 1912. The club&#x27;s first kit was green and white, honoring founding member Eduardo Pedreschi&#x27;s Italian heritage. Beginning in that first season, the colors of the Alianza stables, blue, white and black were used, and by the 1920s the classic vertically striped jersey had become the definitive kit. The club changed its name to Alianza Lima in 1920. The League turned professional in 1951.

Alianza participated in the amateur era of the Peruvian football league from that inaugural season, winning its first title in 1918. During its first years, it played irregularly against other teams from Lima and the port of Callao. Its matches against Atlético Chalaco from Callao stirred interest as a clash between &quot;limeños&quot; and &quot;chalacos&quot;. Sport Alianza had started to become a popular team drawing large support and this was the first derby or &quot;clasico&quot;.

=== Alleged four-in-a row ===
The Alianza Stud changed owners and locations continuously and, consequently, the team was forced to relocate in turn, until 1928, when under the new name Alianza Lima, the club settled at the third block of the Manco Capac avenue in the La Victoria District, where it would stay and become the emotional home-base for club and fans alike.

That same year Alianza played against the &quot;Federación Universitaria&quot; (University Federation) for the first time. This club which would later be renamed Universitario de Deportes and become Alianza&#x27;s greatest rivals, in what is today the most important Peruvian derby.

The 1930s brought great joy and frustration to the team. In 1931, 1932, 1933, and 1934, Alianza Lima won the National Championship four times in a row, for the first and so far only time in Peruvian football. However the Peruvian Football Federation did not recognize the championship of 1934 as won by Alianza. The championship was awarded to the club&#x27;s biggest rival, Universitario.

The memory of the four-in-a-row was tainted by the club&#x27;s relegation in 1938, but after one season in the Lima Provincial League, one of the de facto first division leagues, the team returned to the First Division.

===Titles and cup performances===

During the 1940s, and start of the professional era in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Alianza would win 10 championships. The club won two Peruvian titles in a row in 1977 and 1978, when its players formed the majority of the Peru national football team. The team had its greatest success at the international level in the 1976 and 1978 Copa Libertadores, in which managed to reach the semi-finals but lost to Deportivo Cali 1–4. Since then, its Copa Libertadores campaigns were not successful, during the 1990s the club managed to reach round of 16 several times including a semi-finals participation in the 1999 Conmebol&#x27;s Copa Merconorte losing to penalty shootout against Colombian side America de Cali the same way it had been defeated by Uruguay&#x27;s Peñarol a year before in the 1998 Copa Libertadores. Then had one of its worst campaigns in 2007, until the 2010 edition, when they did a great campaign even defeating the defending champion Estudiantes de la Plata by 4–1 in Lima, being one of the three top teams at the end of the first round however, in the Round of 16, they lost the chance to advance further with Universidad de Chile, after a controversial match in Chile, where Ecuadorian referee Carlos Vera gave the Chilean side a goal that had already been flagged by the sideline referee as offside and the play had been called off, however Universidad de Chile&#x27;s coaching staff including teammates and the pressure of a large local crowd seem to have given referee Carlos Vera the fast initiative to validate the goal, Alianza Lima had been eliminated in what Peruvian media and other South American media believed to be a robbery, Fox Sports network and ESPN agreed the play should not have been validated, Alianza Lima&#x27;s president Guillermo Alarcon flew to Asuncion, Paraguay to speak to Conmebol and claiming a straight entry to the next Copa Libertadores, the case was also taken to FIFA headquarters but was not approved.

In the 2011 preliminary phase of the Copa Libertadores Alianza Lima came into the tournament as Peru&#x27;s 3rd place having to face Mexico&#x27;s Jaguares de Chiapas in a back to back home and away matches for a pass to the Cup&#x27;s group stage but would lose both games 2–0 and lost a chance to participate . This 2012 version of the Copa Libertadores, Alianza Lima will participate in group 5 as Peru&#x27;s No. 2 seed against Nacional (Uruguay), Vasco da Gama (Brazil) and the winner of Ecuador&#x27;s 3rd and Paraguay&#x27;s 3rd.

===1980s decade===
The 1980s were probably the most bitter years in the club&#x27;s history. During the first years of the decade, despite having very good players, Alianza could not obtain titles, some which were snatched by Sporting Cristal, which was establishing itself as one of the three big football clubs of Peru.

====1987 air tragedy====

In 1987, Alianza Lima was first in the standings with a few matches left. On 8 December of that year, Alianza made a trip to Pucallpa to play against Deportivo Pucallpa for the league. The match was won 1–0, with Carlos Bustamante scoring. The team took a charter flight for the trip back. The flight departed on 8 December in a Peruvian Navy Fokker F27 airplane, which crashed into the sea when it was a few kilometers away from the Lima-Callao Airport, close to the Ventanilla district in Callao. The only survivor was the pilot, all the players and coaching staff died, being a game away from conquering another title.

Alianza finished the championship playing with members of the youth team and a few players on loan from Chile club Colo-Colo, which had offered to help sending four players (José Letelier, Parko Quiroz, Francisco Huerta and René Pinto). Friendship between both clubs has been strong since then. Alianza could not keep the first place and its greatest rival, Universitario de Deportes, obtained the title.

The team had to restart from scratch and even former players who had already retired, like Teófilo Cubillas, or others who were about to, like César Cueto, played to help the club get out of these bitter times.

Alianza Lima was close to relegation in 1988, but it managed to hold on in the last matches. In the next few years, despite being competitive, it failed to obtain a title.

===The titles, the centenary and the new titles===

In 1997, Alianza Lima obtained its first title after 18 years, under Colombian manager Jorge Luis Pinto. In 1999 it came in second place, after losing to Universitario in the finals. In the early hours 2000, tragedy struck again when young captain Sandro Baylón died in a car accident after crashing with a post while driving under the influence of alcohol.

In 2001 the club celebrated its centenary and obtained the national title after beating Cienciano in Cusco on penalty kicks. Later on, Alianza Lima would win the 2003 and 2004 championships, defeating Sporting Cristal in both finals, this time under Argentinian manager Gustavo Costas. In 2006 Alianza Lima again won the championship beating Cienciano del Cusco in the final play-off, enabling them to play the Copa Libertadores. In 2017, Alianza Lima won its first championship in over a decade by winning both the Apertura and Clausura and, thus, did not require playing in the final playoffs. Along with Sporting Cristal, Alianza Lima has been the most successful Peruvian club in this century, having won five championships.

At the end of 2020, Alianza was relegated to the second division, despite the fact that in that year all games were played in just Lima and Callao because of the COVID-19 epidemic and teams from the provinces were not able to use their home stadiums. As soon as the season ended, Alianza launched a campaign to try to remain in the first division. There was contention about the team that had finished one place above Alianza, Carlos Stein. The Peruvian FA gave them a fine. Alianza argued that this was not enough, since Alianza&#x27;s interpretation of the regulation was that they should be docked points. The Peruvian Football Association disagreed explaining that both fines and point reductions were allowed and used with other teams during the competition depending on the level of infraction by the team, and confirmed Alianza&#x27;s relegation. Then, Alianza took their case all the way to Switzerland, to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport. Eventually CAS decided in favor of Alianza and the team was returned to the first division and Carlos Stein sent to the second division despite the fact that the new season (2021) had already kicked off, and Carlos Stein had played a match. 
Eventually, the regular 2021 season ended with a two legged play off against Sporting Cristal. Alianza beat Sporting Cristal in the first game 1-0 and tied the second game 0–0 to become the champions for 2021. Carlos Stein, meanwhile, came through a penalty shoot out at the end of a play off in the second division and won promotion back to the first division again for 2022. 

Alianza Lima finished in fourth place for the 2022 Torneo Apertura and first in the Torneo Clausura. Due to coming in second in the aggregate table, they received a bye in the semi-finals of the championship playoffs. Melgar beat Sporting Crystal 2–0 in each leg, coming out 4–0 winners on aggregate to set up a showdown with Alianza Lima for the 2022 Liga 1 title. The first leg was played in Melgar&#x27;s stadium in Arequipa and Alianza lost 1-0 due to a Yordi Vílchez own goal. Yordi Vílchez made up for it by tying the series on aggregate with a header right before halftime in the second leg. Pablo Lavandeira then popped up to score a header of his own in the 74th minute to give Alianza a 2-1 aggregate lead. They held on to that lead and won back-to-back league titles for the first time since their 2003 and 2004 league title triumphs. This was, according to Peru&#x27;s official records, Alianza Lima&#x27;s 25th league title win, while Alianza will refute that this was their 26th. This was also their seventh title since the turn of the century, a record only matched by Crystal. In 2023, defending champions Alianza lost to historic rivals Universitario de Deportes in the final, 3–1 on aggregate.

==Kit and crest==


The team&#x27;s home colours consists of a shirt with navy blue and white vertical stripes, navy blue shorts and navy blue socks. Its away colours are not commonly used nor well established, playing sometimes in blue, white or green.

During the month of October, as a tribute to the Lord of Miracles, patron of the team, the regular colours are switched to purple and white. The color purple is often associated with the religious image and its procession, being the only team in the world to change the colour of its shirt for a religious tradition.

==Stadium==
Alianza Lima plays its home games at the Estadio Alejandro Villanueva, also known as &quot;Matute&quot; for the neighbourhood it is located in. Construction was announced on 15 February 1951, the club&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The land where the stadium was built was donated by Manuel Odría, then-President of Peru. Financial problems however, delayed the beginning of construction. It was only until 30 May 1969 that construction commenced. Uruguayan architect Walter Lavalleja was responsible for the project, with a contribution by Alfonso De Souza-Ferreyra.

The stadium was inaugurated on 27 December 1974, with a match between Alianza and Nacional of Uruguay in front of a crowd of 36,966 spectators. The match ended 2–2.

On 4 December 2010, the stadium became the first in Peru to own an LED screen in high definition. Likewise, it was also at the time the only national sports arena that had a digital banner intended for advertising in 101 square meters.

According to a survey carried out by the University of Lima, the Estadio Alejandro Villanueva is the most unsafe stadium in Peru to play football. This is particularly due to it being located in one of the most dangerous neighbourhoods of Lima. Because of this, since 2016, the stadium has a video-monitoring center and is equipped with 50 high-tech security cameras located in different areas throughout, including both grandstands and the interior and exterior.

==Supporters==

Alianza Lima&#x27;s supporters are the largest in Peru. Alianza Lima&#x27;s &quot;Barra Brava&quot;, or Ultras group are called the Comando Svr (spelled with a &quot;V&quot; instead of a &quot;U&quot;, intending to avoid the initial of bitter rivals Universitario). Alianza Lima are known for their large celebrations and dedication in fans. Historically, the club has been the club of the poor working class, while rivals Universitario were of the upper-class. This was one of the few differences that sparked their intense rivalry.

In 2001, results placed Alianza Lima first with 42% of the answers followed by Universitario with 35%. In 2002, the numbers varied but not significantly. Alianza Lima got 43% Universitario 37% and Sporting Cristal 13% of the answers. Alianza for 2003 reached nearly 50% of preferences compared with 31% of Universitario and 17% of Sporting Cristal. For socio-economic levels, Alianza won in A, C, D and E class, while the Universitario was leader in B class. The research found that Alianza&#x27;s supporters grow when the respondents where of down living standards (in the E class have the 63%).

In 2014, a research done by the &quot;Euromericas Sport Marketing&quot; agency, ranked Alianza Lima as the most popular soccer team in South America and the second most popular in Latin America. Fans&#x27;s loyalty to Alianza Lima cannot be matched in the continent, that it even surpassed other big soccer teams from Argentina and Brazil like Boca Juniors and Corinthians.

<text>Club Universitario de Deportes is a Peruvian sports club based in Lima, which has football as its main activity. It also has women&#x27;s football, voleyball and basketball sections. The football team, popularly known as Universitario, has competed in the top tier of Peruvian football, the Liga 1, since 1928. They are the most successful team in Peruvian football with 28 titles and have never been relegated. The club was founded in August 1924 under the name Federación Universitaria by students of the National University of San Marcos but was forced to rename in 1931.

The club won its first Peruvian title in 1929, one year after its debut in the first division. The club won its first double in the 1945 and 1946 seasons and won its only treble after conquering the 2000 season. Since then, Universitario has won twenty-seven first division titles, and was the first Peruvian club, and the Pacific, to reach the final of the Copa Libertadores in 1972. Universitario is one of the two most popular teams in Peru. Universitario&#x27;s youth team is U América FC which currently participates in the Copa Perú. According to the International Federation of Football History and Statistics, an international organization recognized by FIFA, Universitario was the best Peruvian club of the 20th century and the 28th most successful in South America.

In the year 2000, they opened the 80,000-capacity Estadio Monumental, currently the largest stadium in Peru and second-largest in South America, retiring their smaller Estadio Teodoro Lolo Fernández which was converted to a public training ground used by the club and the reserve team.

Universitario and Alianza Lima participate in the Peruvian Clásico, which has its roots in the club&#x27;s first participation in the Peruvian Primera División in 1928. The rivalry is among the fiercest on the continent and is the oldest and largest rivalry in Peru. It also has rivalries with Sporting Cristal, Deportivo Municipal, and Sport Boys.

Universitario has the most important football infrastructure in Peru, with Estadio Monumental, Lolo Fernández and Campo Mar as venues to train and practice not just football but varieties of other sports.

Along with a men&#x27;s football team, Universitario has a volleyball, futsal (indoor football), and women&#x27;s football team. It also has a women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s football reserves team.

==History==

===Foundation &amp; early years (1924–1927)===
The club was founded on 7 August 1924 as &quot;Federación Universitaria&quot; also known as &quot;Federación Deportivo Universitaria&quot; or &quot;Federación Universitaria de Fútbol&quot; (actual FEDUP) by students and professors of the National University of San Marcos such as José Rubio, the first president, and Dr. Luis Málaga, the creator of the club crest. Others present during the foundation were Plácido Galindo, Eduardo Astengo, Mario de las Casas, Alberto Denegri, Luis de Souza Ferreira and Andrés Rotta. At first, Federacion Universitaria was a small league that held tournaments between the faculty departments of the university.

The National Sports Committee (&quot;El Comité Nacional de Deportes&quot;)—the highest-ranking sports committee of Peru at the time—recognized &quot;Federación Universitaria&quot; as an official league; along with other small leagues in Lima and Callao. They all joined the Peruvian Football Federation. Although there was no requirement to play a tournament to be promoted to the Primera División, the club did not play in it between 1924 and 1927. During this period it only played friendly matches with other teams.

===The amateur era (1928–1950)===
In 1928, the Peruvian Football Federation allowed the club to enter the Peruvian Primera División, the country&#x27;s premier division. The club surprised opposing and supporting fans that year because they were the runners-up of the season. During that season, on 23 September 1928, Universitario played the first clásico with Alianza Lima, the defending champion of the season, and won 1–0. However, the team lost to Alianza in an end-of-season play-off for the league title after drawing 1–1 in the first leg and losing 2–0 in the second leg. The following year Universitario won its first season title and was crowned Peruvian champion, preventing &quot;los Blanquiazules&quot; from winning a third consecutive title.

In 1931, the rector of the university, José Antonio Encinas, forbade the club to use the name &quot;Federación Universitaria&quot;. As a result, the club changed its name to &quot;Club Universitario de Deportes&quot; retaining the symbolic &quot;U&quot; in their name. In that same year, 18-year-old Teodoro Fernández, historically known as &quot;Lolo&quot; Fernández, debuted as a regular player of the team in an international friendly against the Deportes Magallanes of Chile.

Universitario&#x27;s second title, in 1934, generated controversy because according to the season regulations, the season champion would be determined by the points earned by the senior teams and a fraction of the respective reserve teams. Under these regulations, Alianza Lima would be league champions; however, both senior teams had individually attained six wins, one draw, and one loss and the determining factor was the points obtained in the reserve league. Universitario&#x27;s officials asked that a play-off between the first division teams be played in order to determine the season champion. Alianza Lima agreed to the play-off match and was subsequently won by Universitario with a score of 2–1. But according to other sources, this title Universitario won was not the league title itself, but a secondary title; thus creating controversy. Because of that, Alianza Lima considered itself as the champion of this year. However, the Peruvian Football Federation and the Sports Association of Professional Football, both recognize the title of this year belong to Universitario. Furthermore, in 2012, FIFA published an article in which Universitario appears holding the 1934 championship.

The 1941 season included eight clubs and was played in 2 legs. However, by the twelfth round, the tournament was suspended due to participation of the national team in the South American Championship. Once the season resumed, Universitario de Deportes reached the title after winning their last two games against Atlético Chalaco and Alianza Lima, 1–0 and 3–1 respectively. Back-to-back titles in 1945 and 1946, led to the club&#x27;s first &quot;bicampeonato&quot; thanks to the offensive trio formed by Víctor Espinoza, Teodoro Fernández and his brother Eduardo Fernández; the three players accounted for 41 goals. The following season, in its worst performance in the amateur era, finished in a mediocre eighth place with Sporting Tabaco and only staved off relegation because both teams refused to play a play-off match to determine the relegated team. Hence, the organizing association of the time decided to suspend relegation for the season. In 1949, the club celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary by winning the championship after winning its last match against Atlético Chalaco 4–3.

In 1950, the last championship in the amateur era took place, where &quot;La U&quot; finished fifth after nine wins, two draws and seven defeats. They finished with seven league titles, one less than Alianza Lima, which held the most titles at the end of the amateur era.

===The professional era (1951–present)===
Professional football came to Peru in 1951, when the Peruvian Football Federation adapted the championship according to the global guidelines for a professional league, but only with the participation of clubs located in the city of Lima and Province of Callao. The club debuted in the professional era with a win over Mariscal Sucre FBC with a score of 4–1. On 20 July 1952, the inauguration of Teodoro Lolo Fernandez stadium took place, with sporting facilities and a spectator stand which previously belonged to the first national stadium of the country. At the opening, Universitario beat Universidad de Chile by 4–2, with three goals scored by Teodoro Fernández himself. In 1954 Plácido Galindo took the club&#x27;s presidency, in what was the first of his three administrations at the helm of the institution. Throughout this decade, the club conducted irregular campaigns in the newly professional league, which saw titles shared between Alianza Lima, Sport Boys, Mariscal Sucre, Sporting Cristal, and Centro Iqueño. The title drought of the fifties ended in 1959 when they won their eighth crown, after tying 3–3 with Deportivo Municipal in the final match, totaling fifteen wins, three draws and four losses.

In the 1960s, the club&#x27;s successes were the greatest yet after winning five more championships. The first of them in 1960 after a scoreless draw with Sport Boys, totaling eleven wins, three draws and four defeats in eighteen games; hence achieving its second &quot;bicampeonato&quot;. As 1960 champion, Universitario was the first Peruvian club to qualify to the first Copa de Campeones de América, the first edition of the Copa Libertadores. On 19 April 1961, the club debuted in South America&#x27;s premier competition in Montevideo, Uruguay against Peñarol, which ended in a loss of 5–0. After finishing third place in two consecutive season, Universitario rose again with the title in 1964, nine points ahead of second place. At the end of 1965, the Peruvian Football Federation expanded the professional league to the entire country by creating the first national tournament as the Torneo Descentralizado, or Decentralized Tournament. In 1966, the first Descentralizado was played. Under the leadership of manager Marcos Calderón, became the first national champion after nineteen wins, three draws and four defeats. In 1967, Universitario successfully defended its crown, winning its third &quot;bicampeonato&quot;. On 27 February 1968 in the Copa Libertadores, Universitario achieved its biggest win in Copa Libertadores against Always Ready of Bolivia by 6–0. The club finished the decade with a third national title after drawing 1–1 with Atlético Grau in the league final.

==== 1972 Copa Libertadores ====

In 1971, Universitario won its fourteenth First División title and qualified for the 1972 edition of the Copa Libertadores under the Uruguayan head coach Roberto Scarone along with Alianza Lima who placed second that season. They were grouped with the Chilean teams Unión San Felipe and Universidad de Chile in Group 4. Universitario&#x27;s first game was the Peruvian Superclásico which it won 2–1. The following game was held in Santiago de Chile against Universidad de Chile where it lost 1–0. Universitario later tied with the other Chilean team in Santiago. Universitario returned to Lima to face Alianza Lima again where they tied 2–2. At that point, Universitario and Universidad de Chile had accumulated 4 points while Alianza Lima and Unión San Felipe had 3. Universitario won the remaining games against the Chilean teams in Lima, obtaining 8 points and qualifying for the next round.

Universitario was grouped with the Uruguayan clubs Peñarol—a three-time winner of the Copa Libertadores—and Nacional—the previous edition&#x27;s winner—in the semi-final group stage. La U started off losing their first match against Peñarol in Lima. In that match, La U did not play with five of their starting players because they were called to play for the Peru national football team. However, they won the following game against Nacional 3–0. They then visited both teams in Montevideo tying both games, 3–3 against Nacional and 1–1 against Peñarol. Universitario had accumulated 4 points and there was only one game left between Peñarol and Nacional, which had 4 and 2 points respectively. All three teams had a chance of qualifying for the next round. Peñarol only needed a win but Nacional needed a win by 5 goals. The game ended 3–0 in favor of Nacional, allowing Universitario to qualify for the final round where they would face Independiente.

The first leg of the final was played in Lima where they tied 0–0. The game in Argentina ended 2–1 in favor of the Argentines; Percy Rojas scored the late goal for Universitario. This was Percy Rojas&#x27; sixth goal in the tournament. He, along with Oswaldo Ramírez, Teófilo Cubillas, and Toninho, were the top-scorers. Although Universitario lost, they had achieved something a Peruvian club had never before, reach the final of the Copa Libertadores, the most prestigious international competition in South America.

Two years later, in 1974, the club celebrated its 50th anniversary, created a football school for minors and finished the year as champion under the leadership of Argentine Juan Eduardo Hohberg.

====The regional tournaments (1980–1991)====
The 1980s of Peruvian football began to see notable changes in the competition format. The 1982 season saw the tournament played in group stages. Universitario advanced from its Metropolitan Group to Group B of the second stage and finally to the four-team group final, known as the Liguilla. Universitario successfully defeated all of its opponents in the Liguilla and reached its sixteenth first division title. The decisive victory was against Deportivo Municipal after a lone goal by Hugo Gastulo. In 1985, José Luis Carranza, to become an important icon of the club, debuted on the first team. Universitario won the Torneo Regional, or Regional Tournament, of the early season successfully remained at the top of the league by advancing to the Liguilla by placing second in the Torneo Descentrlizado and conquering the Liguilla by winning all five matches played, the last of which was a 4–0 win over Los Espartanos de Pacasmayo with goals by Miguel Seminario, Fidel Suárez, Eduardo Rey Muñoz and Jaime Drago. As Universitario won both tournaments of the season, they were automatically declared 1985 champions. Universitario de Deportes returned to the top of Peruvian football in 1987. As in 1985, Universitario began the season by winning the Regional Tournament, which put them in the season final to face off the winner of the Descentralizado for the national title. The Descentralizado went to their classic rival, Alianza Lima which meant the season final would be contested as another edition of the Clásico. Also, both Universitario and Alianza Lima reached the final with seventeen first division titles under their belts. The defining derby was won by Universitario with a single goal by Fidel Suárez, overcoming the tie they had in the most Peruvian titles. In 1990, with the arrival of Fernando Cuellar as coach, Universitario de Deportes won the First Regional Tournament of the season, automatically advancing to the season final where they faced Sport Boys, winner of the Second Regional Tournament.

====The mid-nineties (1992–1997)====
In the year 1992, the national championship regulations were generally amended again by dropping the regional tournaments and returning to a similar system before the 1980s where the clubs would first play in a league and subsequently advance to the Liguilla. The club won the title a week before the final round, after defeating CD San Agustín 4–1, with goals two goals from Ronald Baroni and the remaining coming from César Charún and José Luis Carranza. With Sergio Markarián in charge of the first team, &quot;la U&quot; defended its title in 1993, achieving a new &quot;bicampeonato&quot; for the club. The defining match that gave Universitario its twenty-first title was a 3–0 over San Agustín; two goals were scored by Jorge Amado Nunes and one by Roberto Martinez. This was the fourth time in the club&#x27;s history that it won back-to-back titles.

====The treble (1998–2000)====
By winning in 1998, 1999, and 2000, Universitario won their first treble or &quot;Tricampeonato&quot;. The 1998 title was won under Oswaldo Piazza, Miguel Company and Roberto Challe led the club to the other two titles. It was the third Peruvian team to do this; the first being in the amateur era won by Alianza Lima and the second in the early nineties by Sporting Cristal. It was also during the 2000 season that they were the second Peruvian club to win an Apertura and Clausura in a single season; the first being Alianza Lima in 1997. In the Copa Libertadores, Universitario made it to the Round of 16 in 1998 but lost to Vélez Sársfield. In 1999 and 2000 they failed to advance past the group stage. Universitario also participated in all four editions of the Copa Merconorte between 1999 and 2001 but did not have a lot of success, being eliminated in the group stage all four times.

====2001–2009====
Universitario saw little success after its &quot;Tricampeonato&quot;. In 2002, Universitario beat Alianza Lima in the Apertura two-legged play-off but were unable to finish in the top four of the 2002 Clausura and were ineligible to dispute the national title. In 2005, Universitario placed first on the aggregate table and qualified for the 2006 Copa Libertadores, where they won on away goals against Nacional in the first phase of the tournament, however, they were eliminated in the group stage. Universitario continually failed to win a twenty-fifth national title but qualified to the Copa Sudamericana in 2007 and 2008. In both editions, they were eliminated in the first stage.

Minor success came in 2008 when Ricardo Gareca led Universitario to an Apertura tournament. The last time they won an Apertura title was in 2002. They won the tournament on their twenty-second game 10 points ahead of Sporting Cristal and four games away from the end of the Apertura. They defeated Cienciano 3–1 to secure first place and accumulated 50 points to win the title. They qualified for the 2009 Copa Libertadores but did not finish in the top seven of the Clausura and consequently could not contest the season final for the national title against Universidad San Martín. In 2009, following the resignation of Ricardo Gareca the club hired Juan Reynoso as the new manager, a former player of the club in the 90s and with a long history in the Mexican football. Much of the 2008 squad remained for the 2009 season, but with the departure of some notable players like Héctor Hurtado, Mayer Candelo and Donny Neyra. The most important signing prior to the 2009 season was Nolberto Solano. Other players to arrive were Carlos Orejuela, John Galliquio, Piero Alva, Francisco Bazán, Rodolfo Espinoza, and Ronaille Calheira. 

In the season final, which would be a repeat of the 1987 final, Universitario would face arch-rival Alianza Lima. Universitario won both legs under intelligent management from Reynoso. In the first leg they won 1–0 with a goal from Piero Alva in and in the second leg Nolberto Solano scored the defining goal from the penalty mark in the tenth minute of play. 

As of 2009, Universitario has twenty-five Primera División titles. The first seven titles won by Universitario were during the amateur era. The remaining eighteen titles were won during the professional era, the most any Peruvian club has. The balance of the 2009 tournament could not be better with the Universitario ending the year with had the highest cumulative score and claiming victory in the four &quot;super clásicos&quot; of the year, ensuring their participation in the Copa Libertadores 2010.

==== 2010–Present ====
In the continental tournament &quot;la U&quot; was part of Group 4 of the Copa Libertadores 2010 with Blooming, Lanús from Argentina and Libertad. In the first game scored an away victory to Blooming 2–1. A week later defeated by a score of 2–0 to Lanús and then tied 0–0 with Libertad, this meeting was the number 200 in the history of the club in the Copa Libertadores.

Universitario ended his participation in the group stage with three more draws for a total of 10 points, and alongside Brazilian teams Internacional and São Paulo became the best defenders in the tournament to receive only two goals against. Coincidentally, the São Paulo was the merengue&#x27;s rival in the knockout stage, both matches ended 0–0 so the winner was decided by penalty kicks resulting in the Brazilian club winning 3–1. La U left the Cup undefeated, having achieved 2 wins and 6 draws,

Meanwhile, in the league the club had its worst season start in history after being defeated during the first three games of the season. The team quickly recovered with three straight wins and not again suffer defeat until the twelfth journey when they lost by 1–0 before the León de Huánuco in visitor status. Once again a number of problems dirigenciales and constant technical changes not allowed the team to fulfill a good season.

During the first part of the tournament the Chamber of Conciliation and Dispute Resolution Peruvian Football Federation took away two points for having an outstanding debt to Ricardo Gareca and finished in fifth place with 51 points product of 16 wins, 5 draws and 9 defeats. In the second stage championship of the &quot;U&quot; joined the league odd in which it scored 5 wins and 6 ties for a total of 72 points and obtain the qualification for the Copa Sudamericana 2011.

In the 2011 Peruvian Championship the team did not have a good start and it was only in the third round that they obtained their first victory; However, little by little, he began to raise his level and came to close his participation in the first phase at the top of the table. During the second phase of the tournament, the club was saved from relegation in the penultimate round after drawing 2–2 with Universidad César Vallejo at the Estadio Nacional. At the international level, the club showed a different face and for the first time in its history advanced to the quarterfinals of the Copa Sudamericana where they were eliminated by Vasco da Gama from Brazil by an aggregate score of 5–4. Due to the large debts of some football clubs in Peru (including Universitario), the National Customs and Tax Administration Superintendence requested the National Institute for the Defense of Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property to initiate a bankruptcy process to restructure the club. With this measure, the board of directors was disintegrated and Rocío Chávez Pimentel, president of Right Business S.A., was appointed temporary administrator of the club. In 2024, &quot;la U&quot; celebrated its 100th anniversary since being founded, and also won the Apertura and Clausura tournaments played in the season to claim its 28th league title.

==Colors and badge==

Universitario&#x27;s colors are cream (&quot;crema&quot; in Spanish), burgundy (&quot;granate&quot; in Spanish), and black. When playing a home game they use the cream-colored kit with black socks and when playing away they use the burgundy-colored kit with black socks.

The club&#x27;s colors at first were not cream. They started out with a white kit which had the badge on the chest. During one of their early seasons, Universitario could not participate in an upcoming match because their uniforms had been sent to the laundry to be washed. The managers pleaded that they hurry with the laundry and they quickly washed them. However, when the club received the jerseys, they found that they were no longer white, but yellow. The laundry workers had forgotten to remove the badges from the jerseys and consequently the red color from the badges mixed with the white jerseys giving it a yellow tint. The club had no choice but to use the jersey to play. They managed to win that game and a few others as well and thus the club kept the new-colored kit as a good-luck charm.

The badge is a red U inside a deep-red circle drawn by Luis Malaga, one of the founders of the club.

==Stadium==

Universitario&#x27;s first stadium was &quot;Estadio Lolo Fernandez&quot;. It had a capacity of 15,000. Its capacity was reduced to 4,000 and now serves as a football academy for its club members and hosts football games for the Segunda División reserve team &quot;América Cochahuayco&quot; and youth teams in the youth divisions. It was built in honor of Teodoro &quot;Lolo&quot; Fernandez, Universitario&#x27;s most revered player.

Estadio Monumental is a stadium that was built by the Peruvian construction company Gremco throughout the 1990s and opened in 2000, replacing &quot;Estadio Lolo Fernandez&quot; and the &quot;Nacional&quot;. The inauguration game was between Universitario and Sporting Cristal; Universitario won 2–0. It was given to Universitario the same year it was opened and they now own the largest stadium in Peru with a capacity of 85,000. This stadium is the third largest in South America. Its eastern and western stands are all-seaters and its northern and southern stands have standing terraces. Exactly 1,251 luxury boxes, known as &quot;palcos&quot;, are above the stands.

The stadium was deemed not fit to host the classic derby between Universitario and Alianza Lima between 2002 and 2007 by the Peruvian Police. The first time this stadium hosted the derby was on 26 June 2002—the first leg of the Apertura play-off—where Universitario won 1–0. Alianza&#x27;s fans, in the southern stand, reacted violently to the loss by vandalizing the premises and causing two reported stabbings. Consequently, La U was forced to play all future derbies at Estadio Nacional where the Instituto Peruano del Deporte installed artificial turf which is constantly criticized by the First Division players. For the next five years this derby was not played at this stadium. On 14 September 2008, the derby returned to the Estadio Monumental with a loss for Universitario.

This stadium was rejected as a venue for the Copa América 2004 because of problems with Alfredo Gonzalez, President of Universitario de Deportes, and the stadium&#x27;s owners. Many saw this as a typical bullying behavior on the part of the president since this stadium would have been the perfect venue to host the 2004 Copa América intro as well as final games.

==Supporters==
Universitario&#x27;s supporters are one of the largest in Peru, only rivaled by Alianza Lima&#x27;s supporters. Universitario&#x27;s ultra groups are known as &quot;Barra Oriente&quot; and &quot;Trinchera Norte&quot;. Asociación Barra Dale U, the official name of the Barra Oriente, started in 1968 that notably grew over the years. Trinchera Norte is a barra brava that was formed in 1988; in contrast to Alianza Lima&#x27;s supporters, named &quot;Comando Svr&quot;, &quot;Sicarios&quot;, and others.
The two most popular teams in Peru are Universitario and Alianza Lima. They are at the top of the polls conducted by many different groups. The group Apoyo, Opinion y Mercado in 2006 revealed that Alianza Lima was popular amongst 35%, followed by Universitario, with 32%. In 2005, a study by &quot;Grupo de Opinión Pública de la Universidad de Lima&quot; showed that Universitario was the most popular team in Lima and Callao with 31.7% followed by Alianza Lima with 29.3%. However, in 2006 and 2007 Alianza Lima appeared first in their polls. There was a narrow margin in 2007 as Alianza Lima reached 29.6% and Universitario followed with 29.5% under a margin of error of ±4.16% In 2009, the university&#x27;s results varied because Alianza reached first with 40% and Universitario second with 35.5% under a margin of error of ±4.47%. Another group known as CPI, revealed in May 2008 that Universitario was favored by 32% whilst Alianza Lima was favored by 33.5% under a margen of error of 2.7% at the national level. This report was divided into two parts. In the metropolitan capital, Universitario led with 42.8% and Alianza tailed behind with 39.9%. In the rest of the country, Universitario had a larger lead with 31.5% opposed to Alianza&#x27;s 24.1%. In 2009, CPI released another poll indicating the Universitario was still the most popular team in Peru with 38.6% while Alianza reached 33.1%. A survey conducted by &quot;Grupo de Opinión Pública de la Universidad de Lima&quot; in February 2009, said that Alianza Lima ranked first in popularity with 27.2%; Universitario second with 26.6%. However, a second poll released by the same university group in September of the same year ranked Universitario first with 37.9% and Alianza second with 36.6%. The most recent report from the group indicates that Universitario has more sympathizers than Alianza with 40.6% over 36.% in the Province of Lima and Callao. In 2010, South American Football Confederation (Conmebol) stated that Alianza Lima is the most popular team in Perú.

<doc id="1232977" wikidata="Q4360142" url="?curid=1232977" title="Peta Nocona">
<text>Peta Nocona, also known as Puhtocnocony, or Tah-con-ne-ah-pe-ah ( – 1864), the son of &quot;Puhihwikwasu&#x27;u&quot;, or Iron Jacket, was a chief of the Comanche Quahadi (also known as Kwahado, Quahada) band. He married Cynthia Ann Parker, who had been taken as a captive during the Fort Parker massacre in 1836 and was adopted into the tribe by Tabby-nocca&#x27;s family. Among their three children was Quanah Parker, the last war chief of the Comanche. 

Peta Nocona chose his wife from among the members of the Nokoni band. He led his tribe during the extensive Indian Wars in Texas, from the late 1840s until the 1860s, as the United States tried to suppress his people. He was the son of the Quahadi Comanche chief Iron Jacket. He became so renowned that a legend said that &quot;his&quot; band, the Nokoni (or Wanderers, or Travellers) band, were named for him, but the name of the Nokoni people had long antedated him, and, anyway, he was a Kwahadi, having a Nokoni wife. The city of Nocona, Texas is named after him.

Despite Sul Ross&#x27;s claim that Peta Nocona was killed at Pease River, his son Quanah insisted he was not present at the site of that battle, and died several years later. This claim is supported by contemporary Texas historian John Henry Brown. Brown had already disputed the identity of the person killed at Mule Creek, before Quanah Parker came onto the reservation, stating he was told the name of the man killed at Pease River was Mo-he-ew, not Peta Nocona. Quanah Parker then wrote an affidavit disputing his father&#x27;s death: &quot;while I was too young to remember the chief, it is likely that Brown was correct&quot; (but the killed warrior&#x27;s name results to have been Nobah, a former captive adopted in the tribe, and Col. Wilbur S. Nye personally met Peta Nocona time after the Pease River&#x27;s fight and his claimed death).

==Fort Parker Massacre==
Cynthia Ann Parker was born to Silas M. Parker and Lucy Duty Parker in Crawford County, Illinois. Considerable dispute exists about her age, as according to the 1870 census of Anderson County, Texas, she would have been born between June 2, 1824, and May 31, 1825. Because of the Americans&#x27; war-fighting ability against the Indians, the Mexican government had originally encouraged Americans to establish frontier settlements to block the continuing raids of the Comanche deep into Mexico. Consequently, the Parker clan, which had a long history of frontier settlement and fighting, was encouraged to settle in Texas. When Cynthia was nine years old, her family and extended kin moved to Central Texas and built Fort Parker, a log fort, on the headwaters of the Navasota River in what is now Limestone County. Her grandfather, Elder John Parker, the patriarch of the family, had negotiated treaties with the local Indians who were subject to the Comanches, and historians conjecture that he believed those treaties would bind all Indians and that his family was safe from attack.

However, the customs of the Comanche regarding treaties made by their subject tribes did not limit the Comanche as to their &quot;raison d&#x27;etre&quot; of being a raiding nation. Consequently, when the Comanche raiding season began, Fort Parker was one of the many settlements subject to the Comanche raiding custom. With substantial militia forces focused on guarding the Texans during the Great Scrape, all of the frontier settlements were woefully unprepared and undermanned for the invasion.

On May 19, 1836, a huge force of Nokoni Comanche warriors (at the time the head chief of the Nokoni band was Huupi-pahati, to English-speaking people &quot;Tall Tree&quot;), about 500 strong, accompanied by Kiowa and Kichai allies, who had also been promised by the Mexicans rich booty and hundreds of white females and slaves, made a raid against Limestone County, and a war group attacked the fort in force, killing most of the men. The Comanche, though, ordered some of the children spared for slavery into the tribe. Thus, after the attack, the Comanches seized five captives, including Cynthia Ann. Following the defeat of Mexico in the Texas War of Independence, the new government shifted its attention toward recovering the thousands of children and women captured during the invasion.

==Cynthia Ann Parker and Peta Nocona==
For his role in leading many raids and the strong allegiance given him, Peta Nocona&#x27;s band became recognized as a pre-eminent one. Afterward, his Kwahadi band was often confused with the Nokoni Comanche, the people who had adopted his wife when she was taken captive as a child. Peta Nocona married Cynthia Ann Parker (Naduah), a white captive who had been adopted by the Nokoni Comanche (her foster father was Tabby-nocca). Peta Nocona never took another wife, although it was common among the Comanche for such a successful war chief to do so. The couple had three children, including Quanah Parker, who also became noted as a war chief, another son named Pecos (Pecan), and a daughter named Topsannah (Prairie Flower).

The Texans never gave up on trying to find each of the captives taken during the raids and wars. Although hundreds were either ransomed or eventually rescued in Texas Ranger and Scout expeditions, many others remained in the hands of the Comanche, including those who remained by their own desire. In reprisal, the Texans launched a series of retaliatory attacks on Comanche settlements, finally forcing the war-chiefs to sue for peace. The negotiations for the end of hostilities and the return of the captives was to take place in San Antonio. However, at the subsequent negotiations, the Comanches&#x27; aggressive posture and known behavior of quickly attacking anyone led to a series of confrontations during the meeting and full-scale violence. 

Peta Nocona&#x27;s wife and daughter were captured and his band scattered on December 18, 1860, by Captain Lawrence Sullivan Ross and his Texas Rangers and militia at the Pease River fight.

==Death==

While Peta Nocona&#x27;s death is a matter of dispute, the destruction of his band is not. In early 1860, Peta Nocona led his band in a raid through Parker County, Texas, which had been named in honor of his wife&#x27;s family after their massacre. After the raid, he returned with his band to what he believed was a safe retreat under the sandstone bluffs of the Pease River near where Mule Creek flowed into the stream. The site was long a favorite of the Comanche, providing both cover from the fierce &quot;blue northers&quot; that hit the plains, and ample forage for their ponies, with easy buffalo hunting from the nearby herds.

The settlers had reacted to the Comanche raids with pressure in Austin to protect them. Texas Governor Sam Houston commissioned Ranger Captain Sul Ross to organize a company of 40 Rangers and 20 militiamen to put a stop to the raids. The company of 60 was based at Fort Belknap, in Young County.

Ross quickly realized he did not have enough men to defend the frontier. He decided to take the offensive to the Indians. To this end, he began to scout the area for sign of Indian camps, determined to confront them at the earliest opportunity. After Peta Nocona&#x27;s raid into Parker County, Ross and his fighters started tracking the Kwahadi, who were considered the hardiest fighters among the Comanche. The tribe overall was thought to be the fiercest of the Plains Indians. Modern research has revealed that Peta Nocona did not intend to stay at Pease River, and was preparing to move on when his camp was attacked.

At daybreak on December 18, 1860, Ranger Captain Ross had sent scouts to the area along the Pease River, where his scouts reported a fairly large hunting party and camp on the banks. With an oncoming blue norther blotting out sign, Ross moved close to the location of Peta Nocona&#x27;s Kwahadi on the Mule Creek head bank.

Ross sent a detachment of 20 men, of his force of 60, to position themselves behind a chain of sand hills to cut off retreat to the northwest. With the remaining 40 men, Ross led the charge into the Indian camp. The band was taken completely by surprise, and its members were massacred, either shot down where they stood or were killed by the 20 men to the north as they attempted to flee in that direction. The American forces shot the men, women, and children indiscriminately. Sul Ross wrote, quoted in &quot;Indian Depredations&quot;, by J. W. Wilbarger, that they fired at everyone present.

The attack was so sudden that a considerable number were killed before they could prepare for defense. They fled precipitately right into the presence of the sergeant and his men. Here they met with a warm reception, and finding themselves completely encompassed, everyone fled his own way, and was hotly pursued and hard pressed.

Two distinct versions of Peta Nocona&#x27;s death are given. The first is that he died trying to escape with his wife and infant daughter, which is the generally believed account, and the one officially reported by Sul Ross. Seeing that the camp was hopelessly overrun, Chief Peta Nocona and his wife Cynthia Ann fled to the east up a creek bed. Reportedly, mounted behind Peta Nocona was a 15-year-old Mexican girl, while Cynthia Ann carried her two-year-old child, Topsannah. Captain Ross and his lieutenant, Tom Killiheir, pursued the man they believed to be Peta Nocona.

Accounts vary as to what happened. Captain Ross, who was acclaimed a hero for the deed, claimed and probably honestly believed that he had caught and killed Peta Nacona, but in the melee, he pursued and shot a former Peta Nocona Mexican slave, whose Comanche name was Nobah, who was trying to save the fleeing Comanche women.

Quanah Parker, the chief&#x27;s oldest son, once reportedly said in Dallas to Sul Ross, &quot;No kill my father; he not there. I want to get it straight here in Texas history. After that, two year, three year maybe, my father sick. I see him die.&quot; Certainly, Quanah Parker told both friend and foe that his father had survived the massacre of his band, and died 3–4 years later of complications from old war wounds suffered against the Apache. In this account, strongly supported by the oral history of the Comanche people, Peta Nocona was away from the camp and hunting with Quanah Parker and a few other men when the attack occurred.

Several years after Pease River and the later death of his father, Quanah Parker was introduced into the band of his mother&#x27;s people, the Comanche Nokoni (also called &quot;Destanyuka&quot;, not necessarily because of the taboo of the famous dead chief&#x27;s, Quanah Parker&#x27;s father, name). Chief Horseback (alias Kiyou) took his brother Pecos and him under his wing. Quanah Parker temporarily had left the Kwahadi band, then led by &quot;Pawʉʉra&quot;-o-coom (Bull Bear) as first chief and Kobay-o-burra (Wild Horse) as second chief.

Until Peta Nocona died, he had taken care of his sons. Quanah Parker had not learned that his mother was White until Cynthia Ann Parker was abducted and forced back into White society, and he learned he was of mixed blood. Neither of his parents had discussed his white ancestry before. According to Quanah Parker and his warriors, Peta Nocona was a broken and bitter man after Pease River. He was never the same after his wife was taken from him, and died sometime around 1863 or 1864 of complications of old war wounds incurred fighting the Apaches, and from grief at the loss of his wife and infant daughter.

Nye claimed that he encountered men who saw Peta Nocona alive several years after Pease River when he was ill with an infected war wound. This version strongly supports Quanah Parker&#x27;s claim that his father survived Pease River and died 3–4 years later. Nye confirmed Quanah Parker&#x27;s account that Peta Nocona and Cynthia Ann Parker had been an exceptionally happy couple, and the forced separation killed them both: Cynthia Ann Parker starved herself to death, and Peta Nocona withered away.

<text>Timothy Peter Mo (born 30December 1950) is a British Asian novelist. Born to a British mother and a Hong Kong father, Mo lived in Hong Kong until the age of 10, when he moved to Britain. Educated at Mill Hill School and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, Mo worked as a journalist before becoming a novelist.

His works have won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, the Hawthornden Prize, and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize (for fiction), and three of his novels were shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction. Mo was also the recipient of the 1992 E. M. Forster Award. His novel &quot;An Insular Possession&quot; (1986) was among the contenders in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s list of the 10 all-time greatest Asian novels. 

In the early 1990s Mo became increasingly mistrustful of his publishers and increasingly outspoken about the publishing industry in general. Since 1994 when he rejected a £125,000 advance from Random House for his next novel, he has self-published his books under the label &quot;Paddleless Press&quot;. His first novel to be self-published was &quot;Brownout on Breadfruit Boulevard&quot;.

== Background ==
Mo has been described as a British Asian author.

<doc id="1232986" wikidata="Q2281747" url="?curid=1232986" title="Anticipation (video game)">
<text>Anticipation is a video board game developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1988. It is playable in either single-player or multiplayer mode, with up to four players competing against each other and/or computer-controlled opponents.

==Gameplay==
Before the game begins, the number of human and computer players must be chosen, as well as the difficulty setting. There must always be at least one human player, and the total number of players (human plus computer opponents) can be no more than four. Players use the controllers to buzz in during the game; if more than two players are competing, they may double up on two controllers. Anticipation is not compatible with the NES Four Score and Satellite multiplayer adapters.

&quot;Anticipation&quot; combines gameplay elements from &quot;Pictionary&quot; and &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; board games. The player is represented by one of four game pieces on a board: a pair of pink high-heeled shoes, a bugle, an ice cream cone, and a teddy bear. The game slowly draws a picture, and the first person to buzz in may try to guess it. A die counts down from six to zero while the picture is being drawn. As soon as a player buzzes in, the die and the drawing both freeze and the player has 25 seconds to spell out the answer. Making two mistakes, or running out of time, locks the player out; the drawing and the die countdown both resume, and the other players can then buzz in.

Four categories are in play per level, each corresponding to one of the four colors on the board (blue, green, pink, yellow). Correctly solving a puzzle credits the player with its color and moves his/her token by the number of spaces shown on the die; the next puzzle is played in the category for the color on which it lands. If no one solves a puzzle, a new one is played in the same color. Once a player has collected all four colors on a level, the token rises to the next higher level. The first player to complete every level wins the game.

There are three levels on the Easy and Medium difficulty settings, and four on the Hard and Very Hard settings. From the third level on, the board includes gray &quot;Feature Squares.&quot; Landing on one of these causes the player&#x27;s token to fly around the board until a button is pressed; a puzzle is then played in the color that was hit. The fourth level has the same layout as the third, but with several &quot;Drop-Out Squares,&quot; or gaps where spaces have been removed. Landing on a Drop-Out Square causes the player to fall back down to the corresponding position on the third level, but he/she retains credit for the colors of any solved fourth-level puzzles and must collect the others to climb back up.

===Difficulty settings===
On the easier difficulty settings, the players are initially shown a pattern of dots, which the game slowly connects to draw the picture. The category is shown on-screen, and a string of blanks is displayed to indicate the number of words and letters in the correct answer. These aids are gradually eliminated on the higher-level boards, and are not present at all on the harder difficulty settings.

<doc id="1232992" wikidata="Q419794" url="?curid=1232992" title="Sapphirine">
<text>Sapphirine is a rare mineral, a silicate of magnesium and aluminium, with the chemical formula ( (with iron as a major impurity). Named for its sapphire-like colour, sapphirine is primarily of interest to researchers and collectors: well-formed crystals are treasured and occasionally cut into gemstones. Sapphirine has also been synthesized for experimental purposes via a hydrothermal process.

== Properties ==

Typical colours range from light to dark sapphire blue, bluish to brownish green, green, and bluish or greenish gray to black; less common colours include yellow, pale red, and pink to purplish pink. Sapphirine is relatively hard (7.5 on Mohs scale), usually transparent to translucent, with a vitreous lustre. Crystallising in the monoclinic system, sapphirine is typically anhedral or granular in habit, but may also be tabular or in aggregates: Twinning is uncommon. Fracture is subconchoidal to uneven, and there is one direction of perfect cleavage. The specific gravity of sapphirine is 3.54–3.51, and its streak is white.

Sapphirine&#x27;s refractive index (as measured by monochromatic sodium light, 589.3 nm) ranges from 1.701 to 1.718 with a birefringence of 0.006–0.007, biaxial negative. Refractive index values may correspond to colour: brownish green specimens will possess the highest values, purplish-pink specimens the lowest, and blue specimens will be intermediate between them. Pleochroism may be extreme, with trichroic colours ranging from: colourless, pale yellow or red; sky to lavender blue, or bluish-green; to dark blue. There is no reaction under ultraviolet light.

== Formation and occurrence ==
While there is evidence of magmatic origin in some deposits, sapphirine is primarily a product of high grade metamorphism in environments poor in silica and rich in magnesium and aluminium. However, sapphirine occurs in a variety of rocks, including granulite and amphibolite facies, calc-silicate skarns, and quartzites; it is also known from xenoliths. Associated minerals include: calcite, chrysoberyl, cordierite, corundum, garnet, kornerupine, kyanite, phlogopite, scapolite, sillimanite, spinel, and surinamite.

Large crystals of fine clarity and colour are known from very few locales: The Central Province (Hakurutale and Munwatte) of Sri Lanka has long been known as a source of facetable greenish blue to dark blue material, and crystals up to 30 mm or more in size have been found in Fianarantsoa (Betroka District) and Toliara Province (Androy and Anosy regions), southern Madagascar. Sapphirine&#x27;s type locality is Fiskenaesset (Fiskenaes), Nuuk region, western Greenland, which is where the mineral was discovered in 1819.

Other notable localities include: Western Hoggar, Algeria; the Napier complex of Enderby Land and the Vestfold Hills of Antarctica; Delegate, New South Wales and the Strangways Range of the Northern Territory, Australia; Wilson Lake, Labrador; Donghai, Jiangsu province, China; Kittilä, Lapland, Finland; Ariège, Midi-Pyrénées, France; Waldheim, Saxony, Germany; , Province of Cuneo, Piedmont, Italy; Ulstein, Møre og Romsdal, and Meløy, Nordland, Norway; the Messina District of Limpopo Province and the Okiep Copper District of Northern Cape Province, South Africa; Falkenberg Municipality, Halland County, Sweden; Mautia Hill in the Kongwa region of Central Province, Tanzania; Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides, Scotland; the Bani Hamid area of Semail Ophiolite, United Arab Emirates; the Dome Rock Mountains of La Paz County, Arizona, Stockdale, Riley County, Kansas; Cortlandt, New York; and Clay County, North Carolina; India The Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt.

Sapphirine was also reported as a reaction product (together with garnet) in between Mg-Al-spinel and Ca-Tschermak-rich clinopyroxene in corundum-bearing mantle pyroxenites.

<text>In Greek cuisine, saganaki () is any one of a variety of dishes prepared in a small frying pan, the best-known being an appetizer of fried cheese. It is commonly flambéed in North America.

==Etymology==
The dishes are named for the frying pan in which they are prepared, called a (), which is a diminutive of (), a frying pan with two handles, which comes from the Turkish word , itself borrowed from Arabic ().

==Description==
The cheese used in &quot;saganaki&quot; is usually graviera, kefalograviera, halloumi, kasseri, kefalotyri, or sheep&#x27;s milk feta cheese. Regional variations include the use of formaela cheese in Arachova, halloumi in Cyprus, and vlahotiri in Metsovo. The cheese is melted in a small frying pan until it is bubbling and generally served with lemon juice and pepper. It is eaten with bread.

Other dishes cooked in a &quot;saganaki&quot; pan include &quot;shrimp saganaki&quot; (, ), and &quot;mussels saganaki&quot; (, ), which are typically feta-based and include a spicy tomato sauce.

===North American serving style===

In many Greek restaurants in the United States and Canada, after the saganaki cheese is fried, it is flambéed at table (often with a shout of &quot;opa!&quot;), after which the flames usually are extinguished with a squeeze of lemon juice. This is called &quot;flaming saganaki&quot; and apparently originated in 1968 at the Parthenon restaurant in Chicago&#x27;s Greektown, based on the suggestion of a customer.

<text>Derry City Football Club is a professional football club based in Derry, Northern Ireland. They play in the League of Ireland Premier Division, the top tier of league football in the Republic of Ireland, and are the League of Ireland&#x27;s only participant from Northern Ireland. The club&#x27;s home ground is the Brandywell Stadium and the players wear red and white striped shirts from which their nickname, the Candystripes, derives. The club are also known as the Red and White Army, Derry or City.

The club, founded in 1928, initially played in the Irish League, the domestic league in Northern Ireland, and won a title in 1964–65. In 1971, security concerns related to the Troubles meant matches could not be played at the Brandywell. The team played home fixtures away in Coleraine. The security forces withdrew their objections to the use of the Brandywell the following year, but in the face of insistence from the Irish League that the unsustainable arrangement continue, the club withdrew from the league. After 13 years in junior football, it joined the League of Ireland&#x27;s new First Division for 1985–86. Derry won the First Division title and achieved promotion to the Premier Division in 1987, and remained there until an administrative relegation in 2009. The club won a domestic treble in 1988–89.

After spending the majority of its time in the League of Ireland in the Premier Division, the club was expelled in November 2009 when it was discovered there were unofficial secondary contracts with players. It was reinstated a few weeks later but, as punishment, was demoted to the First Division, the second tier, from where it eventually won its way back to the Premier Division.

== History ==
Founded in 1928, the club decided against using the controversial official title of the city – Londonderry – in its name, while also deciding against continuing the name of the city&#x27;s previous main club, Derry Celtic, so as to be more inclusive to all identities and football fans in the city. Derry City was granted entry into the Irish League in 1929 as professionals and was given permission by the Londonderry Corporation to use the municipal Brandywell Stadium. The club&#x27;s first significant success came in 1935 when it lifted the City Cup. It repeated the feat in 1937, but did not win another major trophy until 1949, when it beat Glentoran to win its first Irish Cup. It won the Irish Cup for a second time in 1954, beating Glentoran again, and for a third time in 1964 – that year also winning the Gold Cup – despite the club&#x27;s conversion to part-time status after the abolition of the maximum wage in 1961. This led to the club&#x27;s first entry into European competition, in the 1964–65 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, in which it was beaten by Steaua Bucharest 5–0 on aggregate. The club won the 1964–65 Irish League and subsequently became the first Irish League team to win a European tie over two legs, beating FK Lyn 8–6 on aggregate in the 1965–66 European Cup. Derry did not complete the next round, as the Irish Football Association (IFA) declared its ground was not up to standard, after a game had been played there during the previous round. Derry suspected sectarian motives, as it played in a mainly nationalist city and so had come to be supported largely by Catholics. The IFA, Belfast-based, was dominated by Protestants and it was widely suspected that it would rather have been represented by a traditionally unionist team. Relations between the club and IFA quickly deteriorated.

There had been no significant history of sectarian difficulties at matches in the first 40 years of the club&#x27;s history, but in 1969 the Civil Rights campaign disintegrated into communal violence, which were followed by 30 years of the Troubles. Despite the social and political unrest, Derry reached the Irish Cup final in 1971, in which it was beaten 3–0 by Distillery. As the republican locality surrounding the Brandywell saw some of the worst violence, numerous unionist-supported clubs were reluctant to play there. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) ruled the zone unsafe for fixtures. With no other feasible local ground available, Derry had to travel to the majority unionist town of Coleraine, over away, to play its &quot;home&quot; games at the Showgrounds. This situation lasted from September 1971 until October 1972 when, faced with dwindling crowds (most Derry fans were unwilling to travel to Coleraine due to the political situation and the longer journey) and dire finances, the club formally requested permission to return to the Brandywell. Despite a new assessment by the security forces concluding that the Brandywell was no longer any more dangerous than any other league ground and a lifting of the security ban, Derry&#x27;s proposal fell by one vote at the hands of its fellow Irish League teams. Continuing without a ground was seen as unsustainable and on 13 October 1972 Derry withdrew from the league amidst a perception that it was effectively forced out.

The club continued as a junior team during the 13-year-long &#x27;wilderness years&#x27;, playing in the local Saturday morning league, and sought re-admission to the Irish League. Each time, the club nominated the Brandywell as its chosen home ground but the Irish League refused re-admission. Suspecting refusal was driven by sectarianism, and believing it would never gain re-admission, Derry turned its attentions elsewhere.

=== Entry into the League of Ireland ===
Derry applied to join the reorganised League of Ireland (the league in the Republic of Ireland) in 1985 with the Brandywell as its home. The move required special dispensation from the IFA and FIFA, but eventually Derry was admitted to the league&#x27;s new First Division for 1985, joining as semi-professionals. As its stadium was situated in a staunchly republican area once known as &quot;Free Derry&quot;, with a history of scepticism towards the RUC in the local community, Derry received special permission from UEFA to steward its own games. The presence of the RUC was regarded as more likely to provoke trouble than help prevent it.

Derry&#x27;s first match in the new system was a 3–1 League of Ireland Cup win over Home Farm of Dublin at the Brandywell on 8 September 1985. The return of senior football to Derry attracted large crowds. Later in the season, after turning professional, it won the League of Ireland First Division Shield with a 6–1 aggregate victory over Longford Town. The following year – 1987 – Derry won the First Division and promotion to the Premier Division, staying there since. The club reached the 1988 FAI Cup final, but lost to Dundalk. The next season – 1988–89 – the club was financially forced to revert to semi-professional status but Jim McLaughlin&#x27;s side managed to win a treble; the league, the League Cup and the FAI Cup. Qualifying for the 1989–90 European Cup, it met past winners, Benfica, in the first round.

=== Modern highs and lows ===
Since 1989, Derry has won the League of Ireland Premier Division once – in 1996–97 – but has been runner-up on three occasions. It added five more FAI Cups to its tally in 1995, 2002, 2006, 2012, and 2022, and was runner-up in 1994, 1997, 2008, and 2014 and has also won ten further League Cups.
The club has been beset by financial problems and was on the verge of bankruptcy due to an unpaid tax bill in 2000. An extensive fund-raising effort was undertaken by local celebrities and the city&#x27;s people to save the club from extinction. Derry played high-profile friendlies against clubs such as Celtic, Manchester United, Barcelona and Real Madrid to raise extra money. This helped keep the club in operation, but difficulties remained and Derry nearly lost its Premier Division place in 2003 when it finished ninth and had to contest a two-legged relegation-promotion play-off with local rivals, Finn Harps. Derry won 2–1 on aggregate after extra-time at the Brandywell and remained in the top flight, avoiding further damage.

With finances secured, the club became the first in Ireland to be awarded a premier UEFA licence in 2004. Derry re-introduced professional football and its form improved, as it finished second in 2005. Derry&#x27;s 2005 League Cup victory also saw the club qualify for the cross-border Setanta Cup for the first time in 2006. It entered the 2006–07 UEFA Cup&#x27;s preliminary rounds, beating IFK Göteborg and Gretna to reach the first round where it faced Paris Saint-Germain; after a home 0–0 draw it lost 2–0 away. Derry finished second again in 2006, but went on to win the FAI Cup and League Cup double. It qualified for the 2007 Setanta Cup, as well as the preliminary rounds of the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League, and was accepted into the restructured Premier Division for 2007. The club had a disappointing league campaign in 2007, finishing seventh despite being pre-season favourites. It did manage to win its eighth League Cup, though, thanks to a 1–0 victory over Bohemians at the Brandywell.

The club, by owing huge debts, was expelled from the League of Ireland by the FAI in November 2009 for breaching the Participation Agreement and dissolved, but a new Derry club using the &quot;Derry City&quot; name joined for 2010 – with the FAI allowing it into the First Division By January 2010 with a new board, the new chairman, Philip O&#x27;Doherty was reported to have acquired a new kit deal with Hummel. Additionally, O&#x27;Doherty was quoted in the &quot;Derry Journal&quot; referring to the application to play in the First Division:
On Monday 15 February 2010, the new Derry City was awarded a First Division licence by the Independent Club Licensing Committee, allowing it eligibility to compete in the 2010 First Division.
By the end of October 2010 Derry had clinched the First Division title and with it, promotion back to the premier division after winning 1–0 away at Monaghan United in the last game of the season.

Derry&#x27;s top goalscorer that season, Mark Farren, who finished with a tally of 20 goals, scored the winner against Monaghan before retiring from football for medical reasons as he sought to fight a benign tumour located in his brain. Farren died of cancer in February 2016 and his number 18 shirt was retired by the club.

== Colours and crests ==
Derry City wore Aston Villa Football Club&#x27;s famous claret and blue jerseys with white shorts for its first season – 1929–30. The colours lasted until 1932, when white jerseys with black shorts were adopted. This style was replaced by the now-traditional red and white &quot;candystripes&quot; with black shorts in 1934. The style derived from Sheffield United, who wore the pattern and, specifically, Billy Gillespie, a native of nearby County Donegal. He played for Sheffield United from 1913 until 1932, captaining them to a 1925 FA Cup win. The club&#x27;s most capped player with 25 appearances for Ireland, he was held in such high regard in his home country that when he left Sheffield United in 1932 to become Derry&#x27;s player-manager, they changed their strip within two years in appreciation of his career at Sheffield United.

Derry have worn red and white stripes since, except from 1956 to 1962, when the club&#x27;s players wore amber and black. Jerseys since 1962 have had &quot;candystripes&quot; of varying thickness. The kit features white socks – originally black socks were used and occasionally red if a clash with the opposition occurred. Similarly, white shorts were adopted for a spell in the early 1970s and for 1985. They are still sometimes worn if a clash occurs, as are black socks. Away jerseys have varied in colour from white, to navy and green stripes, to yellow, to white and light-blue stripes, and to black.

Derry have had various kit suppliers, including Adidas, Avec, Erreà, Fila, Le Coq Sportif, Matchwinner, Umbro, Spall O&#x27;Neills, Hummel, and, currently, O&#x27;Neills. Commercial sponsorship logos to appear on the shirt&#x27;s front have included Northlands, Warwick Wallpapers, Fruit of the Loom, Smithwick&#x27;s and AssetCo. Logos to have appeared on the sleeve have included the Trinity Hotel, Tigi Bed Head and Tigi Catwalk. For 2007, the logos of local media, Q102.9 and the &quot;Derry News&quot;, appeared on the back of the shirt just below the neck, along with the logo of Meteor Electrical on the jersey&#x27;s front.
The club did not sport a crest on the club jersey throughout the Irish League years, nor for most of the first League of Ireland season. Instead, the coat of arms of the city appeared on club memorabilia such as scarves, hats and badges. The symbols on the arms are a skeleton, three-towered castle, red St. George&#x27;s cross and sword. The sword and cross are devices of the City of London, and along with an Irish harp embedded within the cross, demonstrate the link between the two cities – the city&#x27;s official name under UK law is Londonderry and the city itself was developed by The Honourable The Irish Society, a livery company of the City of London. The castle is thought to be an old local Norman keep built in 1305 by the de Burca clan. The skeleton is believed to be that of a knight of the same clan who was starved to death in the castle dungeons in 1332. This is accompanied by the Latin motto, &quot;Vita, veritas, victoria&quot;, meaning &quot;Life, truth, victory.&quot;
In April 1986 the club ran a competition in local schools to design a crest for them. The winning entry was designed by John Devlin, a St. Columb&#x27;s College student, and was introduced on 5 May 1986 as Derry hosted Nottingham Forest for a friendly, with Liam Nelis and Paul Gormley (on his fifth birthday) acting as mascots. The crest depicted a simplified version of the city&#x27;s Foyle Bridge, which had opened 18 months previously, the traditional red and white stripes of the jersey bordered by thin black lines, the year in which the club was founded and a football in the centre representing the club as a footballing entity. The name of the club appeared in Impact font.

With the novelty of the Foyle Bridge wearing off over time, the crest lasted until 15 July 1997, when the current one was unveiled at Lansdowne Road with the meeting of Derry City and Celtic during a pre-season friendly tournament. The modern crest also features a centred football, the year of founding and the club&#x27;s name in a contemporary sans-serif font – Industria Solid. The famous red and white stripes are present along with a red mass of colour filling the left half of the crest, separated from the right by a white stripe. Known cultural landmarks or items associated with the city are absent from the minimalist design. The crests have always been positioned over the heart on the home jerseys.

== Home ground ==

Derry City&#x27;s home ground is the municipal Brandywell Stadium, situated just south-west of the Bogside in the Brandywell area of Derry. It is often abbreviated to &quot;the Brandywell&quot; and is also a local greyhound racing venue, with an ovoid track encircling the pitch. The dimensions of the pitch measure . The legal owner is the Derry City Council which lets the ground to the club. Due to health and safety regulations the stadium has a seating capacity of 2,900 for UEFA competitions, although it can accommodate 7,700 on a normal match-day, terraces included. The curved cantilever all-seated &quot;New Stand&quot; was constructed in 1991, while development on the still-insufficient facilities has been delayed numerous times and had yet to take place as of the end of the 2016 season.

Plans of Derry City&#x27;s to purchase a pitch fell through after its formation due to the tight time-scale between its foundation in 1928 and the season&#x27;s beginning in 1929 and so the Londonderry Corporation (now the Derry City Council) was approached for the use of the Brandywell which had been used for football up until the end of the 19th century. It agreed and the club still operates under the constraints of The Honourable The Irish Society charter limitations which declare that the Brandywell must be available for the recreation of the community. In effect, the club does not have private ownership and, thus, cannot develop by its own accord, with that discretion or whether to sell being left to the Derry City Council.
Derry City&#x27;s first game at the Brandywell was a 2–1 loss to Glentoran on 22 August 1929. In 1933, the purchase of Bond&#x27;s Field in the Waterside was mentioned, but it was thought to be too far away from the fan-base which had built up on the Cityside, especially in the Brandywell area. It also had first option on Derry Celtic&#x27;s old ground, Celtic Park, but hesitated on a final decision and the Gaelic Athletic Association bought it ten years later. It also decided against buying Meenan Park for £1,500.

Because of Northern Ireland&#x27;s volatile political situation during the Troubles and security fears for Protestants and those of the unionist tradition visiting the mainly nationalist city of Derry, the Brandywell has not always been the home ground of Derry City. In 1970 and 1971, Derry had to play its &quot;home&quot; ties against Linfield at Windsor Park in Belfast – the home-ground of Linfield. From September 1971 until October 1972 Derry was forced to play all its &quot;home&quot; games at the Showgrounds in mainly Protestant Coleraine, over away, as police ruled the republican Brandywell area as too unsafe for visiting unionists, who themselves made up at least half of Derry City&#x27;s own fanbase at that time. The Brandywell did not see senior football for another 13 years as the Irish Football League upheld a ban on the stadium and Derry decided to leave the league as a result. Only greyhound meetings and junior football were held during this time. Derry&#x27;s admission to the League of Ireland in 1985 saw a return of senior games.

In December 2010 the club introduced a new credit card type season ticket system to ensure abuse of tickets could no longer occur and additionally ensuring more accurate attendance count at matches.

They played all their home matches of the 2017 season at Maginn Park in Buncrana due to renovation works at the Brandywell.

== Supporters ==
By Irish standards, Derry City have a relatively large and loyal fan-base. The club was considered among the strongest and best-supported teams in the Irish League, and upon the club&#x27;s entry into the League of Ireland in 1985, crowds of nearly 10,000 attended to the Brandywell for the return of matches. More recently, Derry City became the best supported team at an FAI Cup Final ever, when over 20,000 Derry supporters attended the 2022 FAI Cup Final, in which Derry overcame Shelbourne. Derry&#x27;s average home attendance of 3,127 was the highest of any team for the 2006 season. The highest attendance was the last-night-of-the-season meeting between Derry and Cork City at the Brandywell on Friday 17 November when 6,080 watched Derry win 1–0. Domestically, Derry&#x27;s supporters travel to away games in &quot;bus-loads&quot;. They gave large support in the club&#x27;s 2006 UEFA Cup run – around 3,000 travelled to Motherwell and &quot;maintained a wall of sound&quot; as Derry beat Gretna 5–1 at Fir Park, and &quot;some 3,000&quot; went to Paris to see Derry play Paris Saint-Germain in the Parc des Princes. During the home legs, ticketless fans desperate to see the games watched from a distance while standing on the high vantage point overlooking the Brandywell offered by the City Cemetery in Creggan and parked hired double-decker buses outside the stadium to help them see over the ground&#x27;s perimeter.

The club is known for its community spirit, and the supporters have played a pivotal role in the survival and successes of the club. When debts brought Derry close to extinction in the 2000–01 season, the local community responded en masse to help save the club. During the club&#x27;s successful 2006 season, club captain, Peter Hutton said:
Likewise, former Social Democratic and Labour Party leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume, who was the club&#x27;s president, stated in 1998 of the club&#x27;s relationship with the community:
Support for the club is quite dependent on geography and crosses social boundaries. Fans come from both working class areas, such as the Brandywell area and Bogside, and more affluent regions of the city, like Culmore. The Cityside is seen as the traditional base of the club, especially the Brandywell area, although the Waterside is also home to a smaller number of supporters. The club are supported mainly by Derry&#x27;s nationalist community. The connection is argued to be rooted mainly in geography, as well as social, cultural and historical circumstances, as opposed to the club or its fans pushing towards the creation of a certain identity. Indeed, prior to 1969, over half of the club&#x27;s support base came from the sizeable Unionist community that lived in the cityside at the time. The onset of the troubles made the Brandywell&#x27;s Nationalist location too dangerous to visit and Unionist support fell away to a small minority, in keeping with the rapid Unionist depopulation of the cityside as a whole. The city&#x27;s wider Protestant community, almost entirely based in the Waterside, is largely apathetic, though some unionists and loyalists see the club as a symbol of Catholicism and nationalism as a result of the sectarian divide in support. Joining the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s league augmented the perception and, on occasion, Protestant hooligans have thrown missiles at Derry&#x27;s supporter buses as they journeyed to or returned from games across the border. Minor nationalist elements within the Derry City support-base see football as a means of reinforcing sectarian divides.

With the city being a focal point of culture and activity serving the north-west region of Ireland, support stretches beyond the urban border and into the surrounding county; Limavady, Strabane in nearby County Tyrone and areas of bordering County Donegal contain support. The club has numerous supporter clubs, along with ultra fans, and support beyond Ireland – mainly emigrated city natives. &quot;Derry City Chat&quot; is a discussion website run by fans. Derry&#x27;s fans share a rivalry with the supporters of Finn Harps and sing the Undertones&#x27; &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; as a terrace anthem.

== Records ==

Peter Hutton holds the club record for matches played in League of Ireland football with a total of more than 660 appearances for Derry City, a club record. Paul Curran has made the second highest number of appearances for the club in the League of Ireland with 518, followed by Sean Hargan with 408 since 1995.

The club&#x27;s all-time highest goal-scorer is Jimmy Kelly with 363 goals between 1930 and 1951. Since the entry of the club into League of Ireland football, Mark Farren is Derry&#x27;s top scorer with 114 goals after 209 competitive appearances for the club between 2003 and 2012. Derry&#x27;s first ever scorer was Peter Burke at home to Glentoran on 22 August 1929 as the club lost 2–1. Two days later, Sammy Curran had the honour of scoring Derry&#x27;s first hat-trick, as the club came back from 5 to 1 down away to Portadown, only to lose 6–5 to a late goal. Barry McCreadie was Derry&#x27;s first scorer in the League of Ireland as he scored during a 3–1 home win over Home Farm on 8 September 1985. Derry&#x27;s first hat-trick in the League of Ireland was scored by Kevin Mahon away to Finn Harps on 15 December 1985. Derry&#x27;s 1000th league goal was scored by Conor Sammon on 9 May 2008 against Shamrock Rovers. A number of capped internationals have also played for Derry.

Derry&#x27;s record League of Ireland defeat was to Longford Town in January 1986 – the score was 5–1. The club&#x27;s record League of Ireland win was 9–1 against Galway United in October 1986. The club has only suffered relegation in the Irish League due to a breach of regulations, in 2009. Derry are the only League of Ireland team to have completed a treble, in the 1988–89 season. Derry&#x27;s 5–1 away win against Gretna at Fir Park, Motherwell in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup second qualifying round is the largest away winning margin for any League of Ireland team in European competition. Derry played a record number of 54 games in the whole 2006 season, including all competitions. Previously, the record had been the 49 games played in all competitions during the treble-winning 1988–89 season.

The Brandywell&#x27;s record attendance in the League of Ireland system is 9,800 people who attended an FAI Cup second round tie between Derry and Finn Harps on 23 February 1986. In the Irish League, a crowd of 12,000 attended the 1929–30 season home game against Linfield.
== In popular culture ==
Derry City have made numerous appearances in popular culture. In the world of music, the club was given exposure by Derry punk band, The Undertones, which had the cover of its 1980 hit single, &quot;My Perfect Cousin&quot;, feature a Subbuteo figure sporting the colours of Derry City. The song&#x27;s video included the group&#x27;s front-man, Feargal Sharkey, kicking and leaping to head a ball while wearing the red and white jersey. Similarly, on the cover of its second ever single, &quot;Get Over You&quot;, the words &quot;Derry City F.C.&quot; can be seen.

The club have also featured on popular television. Due to the fact that it is a club based in Northern Ireland playing in the league of the Republic of Ireland, it often receives the attention of broadcasters in both jurisdictions. In the BBC documentary series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; shown the night before Derry&#x27;s clash with Paris St. Germain in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup first round, it was highlighted that Archie McLeod, the grandfather of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor David Tennant, was a Derry City player. Derry had supplied a lucrative signing-on fee and had enticed him over from Scotland. Likewise, features about the club were run by &quot;Football Focus&quot; prior to and after the same UEFA Cup game. Irish television has also featured the club. Derry City played in the first League of Ireland match ever to be shown live on television when it visited Tolka Park to play Shelbourne during the 1996–97 season. The game was broadcast on RTÉ&#x27;s Network 2 and finished 1–1 with Gary Beckett scoring for Derry.

Another medium to play host to the club has been the radio. On 20 April 2005, Derry City featured in an audio documentary &quot;The Blues and the Candy Stripes&quot; on RTÉ Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Documentary on One&quot;. The documentary was produced in the aftermath of the historic friendly game between Derry and Linfield that took place on 22 February 2005 – the first between the two teams to occur since a game on 25 January 1969 during which Linfield&#x27;s fans had to be evacuated from the Brandywell by police at half-time due to civil unrest and ugly scenes within the ground. The 2005 match was organised as a kind of security test in the run-up to the likely possibility that both teams, with socially polar fan-bases, qualified for and be drawn against one another in a Setanta Cup competition.

<text>Oikonomos (, from - &#x27;house&#x27; and - &#x27;rule, law&#x27;), Latinized œconomus, oeconomus, or economos, was an Ancient Greek word meaning &quot;household manager.&quot; In Byzantine times, the term was used as a title of a manager or treasurer of an organization.

It is a title of honor awarded to priests in the Eastern Orthodox Church. It is also a title in the Roman Catholic Church. In Canon 494 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, an œconomus is the diocesan finance officer.

== In Ancient Greece ==

=== Role in the &quot;oikos&quot; ===

The &quot;oikos&quot; (household) was the base unit for the organization of social, political, and economic life in the Ancient Greek world. The person in charge of all its affairs was the &quot;oikonomos&quot;. The &quot;oikos&quot; was composed of a nuclear family as well as extended family members such as grandparents or unmarried female relatives. The husband of the core nuclear family was generally the &quot;oikonomos&quot;. The ancient Greek world was a patrilocal society. A married woman would join her husband&#x27;s &quot;oikos&quot;. However, the woman would still remain a member of the &quot;oikos&quot; she grew up in and would return to her original &quot;oikos&quot; upon the end of a marriage. The &quot;oikonomos&quot; of a household, in addition to making economic decisions for the &quot;oikos&quot;, acted as legal guardian, or &quot;kyrios&quot; (a word meaning &#x27;lord&#x27; or &#x27;controller&#x27;), for other members of the household. In this capacity, they were generally responsible for male members of the household under the age of 18, unmarried women, as well as their wife. Marriage in the Greek world was seen as the transfer of responsibility over a woman from one &quot;kyrios&quot; to another; in most cases, from her father to her husband. The &quot;kyrios&quot; was understood to make decisions in the best interest of his wards about education, finances, and marriage. Although it differed between different Greek cities, an &quot;oikonomos&quot; in Athens would have the authority to dispose of his wife&#x27;s property owing to his role as her &quot;kyrios&quot;. In other cities, such as Gortyn and Sparta, it appears that married women had the right to use their property as they wished. The power of the &quot;oikonomos&quot; to act as &quot;kyrios&quot; was not unlimited. In Athens, an individual who had been under the care of a &quot;kyrios&quot; would be able to seek legal recourse for damages caused by their former &quot;kyrios&quot;. The &quot;oikonomos&quot; in his role as &quot;kyrios&quot; also had many responsibilities. He was expected to provide education for boys under his care, represent his wards in legal proceedings, provide for their everyday needs, as well as arrange marriages of women in his care.

In addition to family members by kinship or marriage, slaves or metics might have lived and worked within the household. Wealthy households would have had many slaves and metics working for them. The &quot;oikonomos&quot; of the household would have played a role in directing the labour of the slaves and metics. While the &quot;oikonomos&quot; did not have absolute power over members of his &quot;oikos&quot; owing to his role as &quot;kyrios&quot;, this was not the case for slaves. The Greeks did not consider him to be a &quot;kyrios&quot; to the slaves, he was instead their &quot;despotes&quot;, a word meaning master. In some extreme cases, slaves were seen as factors of production without any agency rather than autonomous human beings. A small &quot;oikos&quot; would have had only a few household slaves known as &quot;oiketai.&quot; Of the &quot;oiketai,&quot; the men might have had the responsibility to work in the field. In a larger &quot;oikos&quot;, many slaves would be entirely dedicated to agricultural work. This is generally considered to be less favourable than work in the house itself.
The &quot;oikos&quot; was the primary unit of economic organization within the ancient Greek world. Genuine urban commercial centers were relatively uncommon and sparse. Additionally, lack of trust between members of an &quot;oikos&quot; and nonmembers usually prevented larger businesses not associated with an &quot;oikos&quot; from forming. For these reasons, the &quot;oikos&quot; remained the pillar of ancient Greek economy. An &quot;oikos&quot; was expected to be self-sufficient in what it produced for itself. Thinkers such as Aristotle considered the self-sufficient &quot;oikos&quot; to be the fundamental, indivisible constituent of the &quot;polis&quot;. In order to be a true &quot;oikos,&quot; it had to be entirely self-sustaining it what it produced and consumed, as well as maintain its population over time. Most of the processing and storage facilities needed to run a farm, such as grain stores and oil presses, were found on the land owned by the &quot;oikos&quot;. The continued existence of the &quot;oikos&quot; was dependent on its ability to store goods for the future and the prudence of the &quot;oikonomos&quot; in anticipating future needs. Chance weather events, warfare, sick animals, pests, and even ageing members of the &quot;oikos&quot; could seriously threaten its existence. Households which practised a trade in addition to or instead of farming, often had their workshops located within the house in a room facing the street.

In addition to his plethora of economic and social responsibilities, the &quot;oikonomos&quot; would also be the representative of his &quot;oikos&quot; to the outside world. He would be expected to provide funds for religious festivals, attend important events such as births and marriages, as well as fulfill his civic duties as a member of the &quot;polis&quot;. Depending on the city, this might have included military service. The &quot;oikonomos&quot; was also expected to maintain relationships with other households in the &quot;polis&quot;. In the event of an emergency an &quot;oikonomos&quot; might be able to seek help from a neighbouring &quot;oikos&quot;. In return the &quot;oikonomos&quot; would be expected to provide material aid to these same neighbours in their own time of need. This effectively established a credit system for a pre-bank economy.

=== Ancient thinkers on the concept of &quot;oikonomos&quot; ===
Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Oeconomicus&quot; is one of the earliest sources to extensively discuss the management of a wealthy agrarian estate. Here, the role of the &quot;oikonomos&quot; largely concerned management of his household with the aim of accumulating and preserving wealth, rather than a relation to any modern sense of &quot;economics&quot;. Socrates and Crito consider household management to be an art or science, and the former argues that the best &quot;oikonomos&quot; is the one who makes the best use of resources; one with an abundance of material wealth which is insufficient to satisfy his needs is functionally poorer than one with little wealth which satisfies him. In this portrayal, though Socrates figures his own property to be worth a hundredfold less than Crito&#x27;s, he has enough to satisfy himself and friends who would help him if he did not; the latter has social obligations of sacrifice, patronage, entertaining guests, and financing potential wars. This leads Socrates to consider himself far wealthier than Crito. Meanwhile, Ischomachus, a &quot;fair and good&quot; upper-class farmer, focuses his instructions on household managing on the importance of ensuring his wife&#x27;s submissiveness and of close supervision of the house, as well as on a thorough understanding of agricultural techniques. In short, Xenophon characterizes the &quot;oikonomos&quot; as holding power over children, slaves, wife, and property, along with the power to delegate authority to overseers; however, this account specifically concerns wealthy estates.

Aristotle, however, argued that the role of &quot;master of the house&quot; is a position of nature rather than of particular skill in household management. He disagrees with the notion that household management is synonymous with wealth acquisition, instead proposing that it is &quot;the art which uses household stores&quot;. To the extent that there is a natural part of household management which concerns acquisition, it is limited to the provision of basic necessities. The obligation of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;oikonomos&quot; is to use and order wealth (the most essential of which are the necessities for survival which nature provides, which are presupposed) rather than to acquire it.

Nor does Aristotle believe that wealth acquisition is furthered solely by good home management, as he argues in &quot;Rhetoric&quot; that to pontificate on growing the wealth of a country, a political speaker must understand foreign and domestic affairs. Aristotle specifically objects to the sophist Alcidamas&#x27;s use of &quot;oikonomos&quot; in the context of a rhetorician as &quot;dispenser of pleasure to his audience&quot;. This was part of a repudiation of Alcidamas&#x27; tendency to use excessive metaphors and &quot;long, unseasonable, or frequent epithets&quot;.

Aristotle also emphasizes the importance of the household in tragedies and comedies. In &quot;Poetics&quot;, he writes that the tragedian Euripides is faulty in his &quot;oikonomia&quot;, translated as &quot;management&quot; as well as (more directly) &quot;economy&quot;, of the subject of tragedy. This is in part because the households he portrays are poorly suited to tragic plays. Meanwhile, a proper tragedy, such as those pertaining to the House of Atreus or Oedipus, must involve a family or household (oikos) which elicits pity from the audience; to this end, it must be familiar to the audience but not intimately so. The poet here is an &quot;oikonomos,&quot; responsible for the management and deliverance of his play, in addition to the presentation of the &quot;oikos&quot; which is the subject.

Hesiod presents in &quot;Works and Days&quot; instructions on household management, emphasizing the link between one&#x27;s wealth-getting and his work ethic with respect to farming and keeping his house in order. Here he appears to consider a &quot;house&quot; to represent the sum total of all that the &quot;oikonomos&quot; owns.

== In the Seleucid Empire ==
The Seleucid Empire was divided into administrative regions known as satrapies. Hypotheses differ as to the role of the &quot;oikonomos&quot;. Some theorize that they were managers of the royal treasuries or even royal estates, which would have made them completely separate from any actual administrative role. An &quot;oikonomos&quot; may also have been a satrapy&#x27;s financial director, or perhaps an accountant for tax receipts and administrative expenses. The &quot;oikonomos&quot; was probably a low-ranking figure, as accounts place them in charge of trivial local decisions and subordinate to the &quot;strategos&quot;, who functioned as governor of the satrapy. An inscription of a correspondence between two priests uncovered north of Sardis references an &quot;oikonomos&quot; named Asklepiades, and suggests that it was his duty to find and set up a location for a stele to be inscribed with the names of the priests and their initiates. Another inscription implies that &quot;oikonomoi&quot; were responsible for purchasing bulls for sacrifice at the &quot;Panegyreis&quot;.

<text>The Hitachi (also known as Silver trains, Martin &amp; King or Stainless Steel) was an electric multiple unit train that operated on the Melbourne suburban railway network between 1972 and 2014. Electrical equipment was supplied by Commonwealth Engineering, to designs by Hitachi of Japan, leading to their official name today, although no Hitachi-supplied components were used in their construction. They were the last suburban trains in Melbourne without air conditioning. A total of 355 carriages were built between 1972 and 1981, including a replacement carriage for one written off while the fleet was still being delivered.

==Configuration==
Based on a successful trial of longer Harris trailer cars built between 1967 and 1971, the Hitachi used carriages that were long, an increase from the standard length of earlier suburban cars. The revised carriage configuration enabled a six-car Hitachi to seat 560 passengers, up from 540 for a seven-car Harris, and allowed a maximum load of 1,500 passengers, 300 more than a Harris train.

As delivered, Hitachi trains were composed of three types of carriage: driving motor, trailer and driving trailer, coded M, T and D respectively. The cars were arranged in sets of M-T-T-M and M-D, which could be arranged together to create a six-car set. Early M and D carriages were provided with nose doors beside the driver&#x27;s cab, allowing passengers to move between coupled units on a train. That feature did not last long, and instructions were soon issued to lock the doors to the cab area to prevent unauthorised access. The nose doors also tended to leak and generate draughts, so that feature was omitted from later carriages, and the door was sheeted over on existing ones.

All but one of the 68 D carriages (353D having been written off after a collision at Pakenham on 16 April 1980) had been converted into T carriages by the late 1970s, to form symmetrical M-T-M units for the opening of the City Loop. Those units could be doubled to make six car sets, configured as M-T-M-M-T-M, which became the de facto configuration in the 1990s.

The 237 motor carriages were numbered 1M to 237M, and the 117 trailer carriages, 1901T to 2017T. On 15 August 2009, the remaining Hitachi carriages were renumbered to allow for the second order of X&#x27;Trapolis trains, which also started from 1M. The remaining Hitachi M cars were renumbered from 273M up to 300M, although the new numbering did not reflect the age of each car. The numbering reflected which T car was in each set, the lowest-numbered T car received the lowest-numbered M cars, in order of which M car was already the lowest. For example, 2007T was the highest-numbered T car, so 23M was renumbered to 299M, because it was lower than 233M, which was renumbered to 300M.

==Trials, early use and adaptations==
The first to Hitachi train to operate in revenue service, on 24 December 1972, was four-carriage set 1M-901T-902T-2M, on the St Kilda line.

Weekends in February and March 1973 saw the first four carriages being tested and advertised to the public on demonstration trips. On the afternoon of 6 March 1973, the set returned to the Workshops, where the consist was altered by swapping out 902T for 903T, and adding 301D-3M. Later, 301D was noted as having entered service with drawbars at both ends, preventing its use as a leading driving trailer. The six-carriage set was then used for brake tests between Seaford and Frankston on 8 March 1973.

A seven-car Silver train ran from Newport Workshops to Jolimont Workshops on Thursday 14 February 1974, with in-service pair 4M-305D used to transfer 4-car set 15M-911T-910T-14M, about to enter service, with an additional carriage, 902T, attached to the rear.

As originally introduced, the Silver fleet was going to use marker lights as route indications at all times, in contrast to previous fleets, which used destination discs in daytime and marker lights at night. Inadequate visibility of the marker lights during daylight led to that instruction being cancelled. Consequently, in 1973, the only daytime route indication was the destination rolls at each end of trains, and staff were expected to memorise the relevant rosters. Daylight use of the marker lamps was expected to be reintroduced from 7 February 1974 but, from February 1974, the trains were gradually fitted with route indication disc brackets. Most of the fleet had been equipped by 7 March 1974.

The fitting of shunter&#x27;s steps to the ends of carriages began around March 1974, enabling division of 6-car sets into a 2- and 4-car set. Additionally, subject to special instructions regarding the locking of all doors, Hitachi trains were permitted to stable at outstations &quot;for a few months&quot; prior to that time.

An investigation found that people preferred a new, contoured type of seat over the original slab type, with 82.6% of those surveyed being in favour of the new design.

==Service==
Intended to replace the first generation of Swing Door and Tait electric trains, the stainless steel Hitachi was the first Melbourne suburban train to feature heated carriages and power-closing doors, operated by the guard and opened by hand. The M and D carriages were built by Martin &amp; King, and the T carriages by Victorian Railways at their Newport Workshops.

Hitachi trains originally had an unpainted, silver stainless steel livery, with carriage numbers applied to the sides. They received green and gold side stripes following the introduction of the Metropolitan Transit Authority. Side logos were altered after their re-branding as The Met, and were again altered with the privatisation of metropolitan rail services as Hillside Trains (later Connex), and Bayside Trains (later M&gt;Train), with the latter also having branding applied to the front.

When the carriages were refurbished by Connex, they were returned to their original silver colour, with Metlink logos added near the saloon doors, Connex blue and gold striping on the front of the leading cars, and two blue and gold side panels near the driver&#x27;s cab. The passenger seats also received new fabric, similar to that of Alstom-refurbished Comeng trains. With the takeover of Connex by Metro Trains, the Connex logos were covered by Metro stickers.

Beginning in 1992, the Hitachi fleet received internal, external, and cab upgrades, at the PTC&#x27;s Ballarat North and Bendigo Workshops. The refurbishment included the replacement of existing rubber or carpet flooring with vinyl, the replacement of panels above the seats with a new anti-vandal material, and the substituting of the wood-grained upper panels and bone-coloured roof with off-white panels. New seat pads were provided on repainted and strengthened seat modules, luggage racks and advertising boards were removed, windows and doors overhauled, including the door-closing motors worked by air, along with a general clean of the exterior and the application of new green and gold stripes. The refurbishment of over half of the Hitachi M cars also included improved air-flow in the driver&#x27;s cab and double-thickness windscreens, with aluminium replacing the original rubber surrounds. The work on the M cars had been completed by early 1994. After the upgrades were effected, M cars which had not been upgraded were no longer allowed to lead a train in revenue service, effectively making them B units.

Starting in late 2007, Hitachi sets were further modified to meet union requirements for driver&#x27;s cab air conditioning, along with a refurbished interior. They were also re-stickered in Connex livery. In 2008, the remaining seven 6-car trains were again modified, and a more powerful driver&#x27;s air-conditioning system replaced the small vents on the roof. However, three other &quot;leading&quot; cars (9M, 89M and 225M, now 277M, 281M and 296M respectively) were not modified and so were relegated to being in the centre of trains sets.

==Retirement==
New X&#x27;Trapolis 100 and Siemens Nexas trains were progressively introduced from 2002 to replace the ageing Hitachi fleet. The X&#x27;Trapolis and Siemens trains have features such as push-button-operated doors and air conditioning, the lack of the latter feature making the Hitachis unpopular with passengers. A majority of the sets were withdrawn between 2002 and 2005, and were either scrapped, sold to private buyers across Australia, stored, or acquired by railway museums and preservation groups. Three Hitachi motor carriages were lifted and fixed to the roof of Easey&#x27;s Restaurant in Collingwood, although only one carriage is part of the restaurant.

The final six 6-carriage trains were to be withdrawn after the 2006 Commonwealth Games, but instead received a minor refurbishment and remained in revenue service until December 2013, due to a significant increase in train patronage. In February 2007, at which time 31 trains in the new Siemens Nexas fleet were out of service due to braking problems, it was reported that the Victorian Government was negotiating to lease one withdrawn 6-carriage set from rail preservation group Elecrail, and repurchase another three carriages from a private seller to supplement the fleet. In April 2007, an additional three 3-car Hitachi trains were bought back from Australian businessman John Horne to provide spare parts for the fleet. The Elecrail set re-entered service in December 2007.

In September 2008, Transport Safety Victoria withdrew the remaining trains from service due to concerns over corrosion around the doors and floor. A series of tests were carried out before the trains were sent to Ballarat North Workshops for repair work. It was decided to proceed with the repairs, costing approximately $2 million, because the trains were required for a new timetable starting in November 2008.

In April 2014, a farewell tour for the Hitachi trains was held, organised by Elecrail in cooperation with Metro Trains. The tour encompassed the Craigieburn, South Morang and Sunbury lines. During the event, Public Transport Victoria confirmed that Hitachi trains would no longer be used in revenue service in Melbourne.

M car (187M), as modified by the PTC, is on static display at the Newport Railway Museum. One 3-car set (3M, 304D and 178M) has been preserved by 707 Operations. M car (3M) has been preserved with its original unmodified cab, while M car (178M) has been preserved with a connex refurbished cab. The remaining carriages were progressively sold or scrapped.

<doc id="1233019" wikidata="Q1792144" url="?curid=1233019" title="Txakoli">
<text>Txakoli (pronounced ) or chacolí (pronounced ) is a slightly sparkling, very dry white wine with high acidity and low alcohol content produced in the Spanish Basque Country, Cantabria and northern Burgos in Spain. Further afield, Chile is also a minor producer.

It is normally served as an aperitif and drunk within one year of bottling as it cannot be stored for longer. The most common, white, variety has a pale green color, but there are red and rosé varieties. When served, it is normally poured into tall glasses from a height, often as an accompaniment to pintxos. It typically has between 9.5-11.5 ABV.

The 18th century Palace of Mendibile in Leioa near Bilbao today houses a museum dedicated to txakoli, the Museo del Txakoli, explaining the history of txakoli and with a large collection of machinery used for making it.

== Name ==
This wine is called txakolin (pronounced ) in Basque, txakolina meaning &quot;the &quot;txakolin&quot;&quot;. The term is attested from the middle of the 18th century onwards, occasionally also as a personal name. Traditionally the general form has been &quot;txakolin&quot;, although &quot;xakolin&quot; has been documented in Iparralde. &quot;Txakoli&quot;, considered a misspelling by the Euskaltzaindia, is attested from 1985 onwards. Derived forms are based on the root &quot;txakolin&quot;, for example &quot;txakolin-ardo&quot; (txakoli wine), &quot;txakolin-dantza&quot; (txakoli dance), &quot;txakolin-saltze&quot; (txakoli sale), &quot;txakolin gorri&quot; (red txakoli) or &quot;txakolin-etxe&quot; (txakoli house).

This wine is called chacolí (pronounced ) in Spanish, a word that comes from the Basque &quot;txakolin&quot;. The first reference to the name of this wine in Spanish was &quot;vino chacolín&quot; in a document from the Basque Country in 1520. The wine is occasionally called &quot;chacoli&quot; in French.

Most authors assume a Basque origin but the origin of the word is ultimately unknown, except for the ending &quot;-in&quot; which frequently occurs in liquids (cf &quot;ozpin&quot; &quot;vinegar&quot;, &quot;pitipin&quot; or &quot;txuzpin&quot; &quot;watered wines&quot;), the word is obscure.

Amongst the more fanciful attempts at derivation is a suggested origin from &quot;etxeko ain&quot; (just enough for the home). Others opt for a French origin as it initially appeared as a term to identify French wines in villages of eastern Gipuzkoa. There are also authors who suggest a Spanish origin of the term.

== History ==
Until the 1980s, txakoli was a home-made wine, drunk in the Basque Country, Cantabria and Valle de Mena, and almost in danger of dying out towards the middle of the 19th century. However, since some varieties of txakoli in the Basque Country managed to achieve denominación de origen certification from 1989 onwards, its quality, spread and appeal have increased.

== Varieties ==
Txakoli is traditionally fermented in foudres (very old, large oak barrels) but most txakoli produced today is fermented in stainless steel vats. There are three DO certified varieties.

Most txakoli is grown in the Atlantic regions of the Basque Country, areas with high rainfall (between 1000 mm and 1600 mm of annual rainfall on average) and average temperatures between 7.5 °C and 18.7 °C, occasionally suffering from frost.

===Txakoli from Getaria===

&quot;Getariako Txakolina&quot; in Basque, &quot;Chacolí de Guetaria&quot; in Spanish. This variety comes from a small region in Gipuzkoa around the towns of Getaria, Zarautz and Aia and is of a very pale yellow to green color. This was the first variety of txakoli to receive the DO certification in 1989.

The cultivated area has increased from 60 ha to 177 ha since certification. Annually some are produced in this area, mostly on south-east facing slopes to protect the vines from the harsh Atlantic weather. Unlike the other varieties which are grown as most varieties of grapes, the grapes for this txakoli are grown according to the treille or trellis system (called &quot;parra&quot; in Basque). In this system, the vines are cultivated at a greater height above the ground, with the foliage forming a contiguous canopy to improve the microclimate. The white variety used is Hondarribi Zuri, the red grape is Hondarribi Beltza.

In recent years, other towns in Gipuzkoa have also started producing txakoli under this DO certification, including Orio, Zumaia, Arrasate, Eibar, Mutriku, Deba, Zestoa, Hondarribia, Villabona, Urnieta, Oñati, Beizama, Zerain and Olaberria.

===Txakoli from Biscay===

&quot;Bizkaiko Txakolina&quot; in Basque, &quot;Chacolí de Vizcaya&quot; in Spanish. This variety is made in most parts of Biscay, except for the far western end. This was the second txakoli to receive the DO certification in 1994.

It is grown on approximately 150 ha by 85 villages and towns throughout Biscay, producing some of txakoli annually. Records of wine making in this region go back to the 8th century and references to txakoli go back several centuries themselves. The quality of the txakoli varies, as the microclimatic conditions vary.

Both white and red grapes are used for making txakoli in Biscay. White varieties are &quot;Hondarribi Zuria&quot; and Folle blanche (called &quot;Munemahatsa&quot; in Biscay); the red variety used is &quot;Hondarribi Beltza&quot; (&quot;black Hondarribia&quot;).

Historically another light red variety called &quot;Oilar Begi&quot; (&quot;chicken eye&quot;) was also used. This variety had almost become extinct and is making a slow comeback.

===Txakoli from Alava===

&quot;Arabako Txakolina&quot; in Basque, &quot;Chacolí de Álava&quot; in Spanish. This variety comes from the far north-western end of Álava. It is the youngest of the three DO varieties of txakoli, having gained certification in 2001. It is yellowish in color, very acidic and slightly frothy.

It is grown over some 55 ha of land around the towns of Aiara, Amurrio, Artziniega, Laudio and Okondo. Wine-making has a long tradition in this region, going back as far as 760 AD in the historical record. In the late 19th century, grapes were grown on more than 500 ha of land, declining to 5ha in the late 20th century before the recent revival.

The most commonly used grape for this txakoli is &quot;Hondarribi Zuria&quot; (&quot;white Hondarribia&quot;) but other grapes are also permitted: &quot;Bordeleza Zuria&quot; (Folle Blanche), &quot;Izkiriota Ttipia&quot; (Petit Manseng), &quot;Izkiriota&quot; (Gros Manseng) and Courbu.

===Chacolí from Cantabria===
Chacolí, in the original common French, Spanish and Basque spelling &quot;chacoli&quot;, was traditional also in the region of Cantabria until the end of the 19th century. Great amounts of wine were consumed and exported from the 13th to the 19th century, produced in the comarca of Trasmiera, with villages including Colindres, Arnuero, Meruelo, Argoños and Noja as the main vineyards and production areas of chacolí. The production of wine in Cantabria, even in the middle of the 20th century, far exceeded that of the Basque provinces. In Cantabria there are two wine geographical indications (one step below the DO) created in 2004 and 2005: Liébana wine and Costa de Cantabria wine. The Cantabrian region where the wine was called &quot;chacolí&quot; is included in the Costa de Cantabria wine GI. Chacolí is still produced in Cantabria, but on a very limited scale.

===Chacolí from Burgos===
It is also still produced in the Valle de Mena in the province of Burgos, included in the Castilla y León wine GI created in 2005, where efforts are being made to receive DO certification.

=== Chacolí from Chile ===

In Chile, a wine called &quot;chacolí&quot; has been made for centuries: «The permanence until today of two alcoholic beverages of Spanish origin, one called &quot;Pajarete&quot;, produced in the valley of the Huasco River and the valley of the Elqui River and, the other, &quot;chacolí&quot;, A genuine product of the Copiapó Valley and the Choapa Valley, it is a historical testimony of the adaptation and reproduction of certain European products to recreate the daily life of their cultural and telluric origins.» 

In the town of Doñihue in the Cachapoal Valley, the &quot;Fiesta del Chacolí&quot; is celebrated annually.

<text>Photopigments are unstable pigments that undergo a chemical change when they absorb light. The term is generally applied to the non-protein chromophore moiety of photosensitive chromoproteins, such as the pigments involved in photosynthesis and photoreception. In medical terminology, &quot;photopigment&quot; commonly refers to the photoreceptor proteins of the retina.

== Photosynthetic pigments ==

Photosynthetic pigments convert light into biochemical energy. Examples for photosynthetic pigments are chlorophyll, carotenoids and phycobilins. These pigments enter a high-energy state upon absorbing a photon which they can release in the form of chemical energy. This can occur via light-driven pumping of ions across a biological membrane (e.g. in the case of the proton pump bacteriorhodopsin) or via excitation and transfer of electrons released by photolysis (e.g. in the photosystems of the thylakoid membranes of plant chloroplasts). In chloroplasts, the light-driven electron transfer chain in turn drives the pumping of protons across the membrane.

== Photoreceptor pigments ==

The pigments in photoreceptor proteins either change their conformation or undergo photoreduction when they absorb a photon. This change in the conformation or redox state of the chromophore then affects the protein conformation or activity and triggers a signal transduction cascade.

Examples of photoreceptor pigments include:
*retinal (in rhodopsin)
*flavin (in cryptochrome)
*bilin (in phytochrome)

== Photopigments of the vertebrate retina ==

In medical terminology, the term photopigment is applied to opsin-type photoreceptor proteins, specifically rhodopsin and photopsins, the photoreceptor proteins in the retinal rods and cones of vertebrates that are responsible for visual perception, but also melanopsin and others.

<text>Drogheda United Football Club is a professional Irish association football club based in Drogheda, County Louth playing in the League of Ireland Premier Division. They play their home matches at Weavers Park.

The current club is the amalgamation of two former clubs in the town: Drogheda United, a non-league club founded in 1919; and Drogheda F.C., founded in 1962. The clubs merged their operations to form the current club in 1975 and have achieved success since 2005 by winning two Setanta Sports Cups,Two FAI Cups,a League Cup, and their first league title, the 2007 League of Ireland Premier Division.

Since 2021, the club has competed in the League of Ireland Premier Division, having been automatically promoted as winners of the 2020 League of Ireland First Division.

== History ==

=== 1919–1975: early years ===
Founded in 1919 the original Drogheda United were a non-league club for all of their early years of existence but on Saturday 22 June 1963 another Drogheda Club – Drogheda F.C. (founded in 1962) were elected to the League of Ireland when the league was expanded to include twelve teams rather than ten. In their first season there they finished tenth and also in each of the next three seasons finished in the bottom three. In the 1967–68 season they achieved a respectable fifth-place finish and the following season finished in sixth place. When the league expanded to include fourteen teams the club dropped down the table again finishing in the bottom five in each of the next six seasons and also recording their heaviest league defeat 8–1 to Cork Hibernians in the 1970–71 season. They did, however, get to FAI Cup final that season where they were beaten 3–0 by Limerick in a replay after the first match ended 0-0.

=== 1975–2003 ===
In 1975 Drogheda F.C. amalgamated with Drogheda United to form Drogheda United F.C. and the 1975–76 season saw an improvement in fortunes on the field as they finished sixth in the league and they also reached the FAI Cup Final for the second time, this time losing 1–0 to Bohemians. For the next three seasons, quite the opposite at what had happened before, they finished in third place. During these seasons Drogheda United also achieved two club records – their biggest league victory (7–1 v Finn Harps) and Cathal Muckian scoring 21 league goals in a season. The club then endured another tough spell in the league finishing in the bottom half for the next five seasons bar the 1982–83 season when they managed to achieve their second highest ever league placing of second-place (they later won the league in 2007) finishing sixteen points behind Athlone Town. They did win their first ever trophy during these seasons also, the League of Ireland Cup in the 1983–84 season.

The 1984–85 season saw the introduction of the League of Ireland First Division to begin the following season with Drogheda United among the four clubs who were relegated from the Premier Division but in this season also Drogheda United entered European Competition for the first time where they were destroyed against Tottenham Hotspur in the UEFA Cup First Round 14–0 on aggregate. They remained in the First Division until the 1988–89 season when they went up as First Division Champions. Their joy was short-lived, however, as the following season they were relegated although this time they achieved promotion at the first time of asking. In the next two seasons Drogheda battled bravely against relegation surviving by one point and on goal difference in the respective seasons. However, they were relegated for the third time in the 1993–94 season.

Drogheda United were very much becoming a yo-yo club, swapping divisions every season between the 1993–94 and 2000–01 seasons when in 2000–01 they finished a disappointing ninth in the ten-team First Division. In 2002–03 they were promoted to the Premier Division under Harry McCue and were there until the 2016 season, as they got relegated in 2015, coming in twelfth place.

=== 2003–2008: Paul Doolin ===
In 2003, McCue was sacked as manager of Drogheda United. Paul Doolin took over and upped the standard of training and fitness levels. However, he found that to compete with the big clubs like Bohemians and Shelbourne he would need a professional squad. In 2004, he made the squad fully professional and gave part-time players the option to turn professional or leave the club. The change to full-time saw the club&#x27;s fortunes drastically improve. They won their first FAI Cup in 2005, beating Cork City in the final and won back-to-back Setanta Cups in 2006 and 2007.

They also qualified for the UEFA Cup for the 2006–07 season thanks to their 2005 FAI Cup success. This time they fared better than in their first foray into Europe as they defeated HJK Helsinki 4–2 on aggregate in the first qualifying round and were just eliminated 11–10 in an epic penalty shoot-out in the next round against IK Start of Norway. They were also in the UEFA Cup Qualifying stages for the 2007–08 campaign, losing to Helsingborgs IF in the second round.

United finally won the League of Ireland for the first time in 2007, beating Cork City 2–1 at United Park with three games to go. Guy Bates scored the winning goal for Drogheda that day, shooting himself into Drogs folklore. Drogheda were dominant in the league, only losing three games and winning the title by seven points.

The league win meant that Drogheda would be playing in the Champions League Qualifiers for the first time in their history in the 2008–09 season. They succeeded in their first qualifier against Levadia Tallinn, beating them 3–1 on aggregate. They played the second qualifying round against Dynamo Kyiv which, they ended up losing 4–3 on aggregate. In the first a late goal for Kyiv secured a 2–1 victory at Dalymount Park. In the second game, an early Kyiv goal after 13 minutes seemed to have finished the tie, but remarkably, on 41 minutes, Drogheda were awarded a penalty. Shane Robinson stepped up and slotted home the spot-kick. Drogheda then worked tirelessly trying to get the second goal, but they gave away a penalty on 72 minutes, which was converted. 2–1 down, it seemed the tie was over now. Amazingly however, Graham Gartland scored an 88th-minute goal to make it 2–2. Adam Hughes got a further chance when he had an open goal, but miskicked the ball and it flew over the bar. Then, Shane Robinson hit a shot from a tight angle which hit the post. Despite Drogheda&#x27;s late rally, they were knocked out by Dynamo Kyiv.

=== 2008: examinership ===
In October 2008 Drogheda went into examinership, like Cork City, after failing to pay back a €500,000 loan to the Revenue Commissioners and €10,000 rent to Bohemians for their use of Dalymount Park in their Champions League Qualifiers. Their plans for a new €35m stadium fell through and in November 2008 they were deducted 10 points. After successfully raising money through various fund raisers arranged by the supporters, the club escaped extinction on 30 January 2009 when a judge ruled in Drogheda&#x27;s favour, to the delight of the teary eyed chairman Vincent Hoey.

=== 2009–2010 ===

====2009 season====
In the 2009 season Drogheda got off to a difficult start. Due to bankruptcy, the club went part-time and lost their entire league-winning squad, and manager, Paul Doolin, who took over Cork City. Former Cork and Longford boss Alan Mathews took over. Mathews had to sign a side of semi-pros and free agents. Drogheda were in the bottom half of the table for the whole season, despite some shock wins. On 10 November 2009 they beat Bray Wanderers 2–0 in a relegation play-off.

====2010 season====
The 2010 season was disastrous on and off the pitch. Drogheda started terribly and after a 6–0 loss at the hands of Sligo Rovers on 15 May, Alan Mathews quit his managerial post. The club appointed youth team coach and Drogheda native Darius Kierans as manager even though he had yet to complete his Europa A licence which is an FAI requirement for league managers. After much objection from the FAI, Kierans became Director of Football and the club appointed Paul Lumsden as Interim Manager. Lumsden took the team for only one game before resigning. Brian Donnelly was then appointed as the second Interim Manager of the season but he too resigned in September. On 27 September, the club announced the imminent arrival as manager of another former player – Bobby Browne. Despite finishing rock-bottom of the table with only four wins and nine draws (a total of 21 points) in 2010 and being relegated, Drogheda United were reprieved after the extinction of Sporting Fingal in February 2011.

=== 2011–2013: Mick Cooke ===

====2011 season====
Mick Cooke, manager of Monaghan took over as manager on 27 February 2011, becoming the sixth Drogheda manager in nine months. Cooke appointed former Drogs goalkeeper, Robbie Horgan as his assistant, and inherited the players who had been signed by Bobby Browne to play in the First Division so hopes weren&#x27;t high. After an awful start, Drogheda beat local rivals Dundalk 2–1 in Oriel Park. The win turned their season around and despite operating on the lowest playing budget in the league, Drogheda managed to avoid relegation. Shortly after, Cooke put pen to paper on a new three-year deal with the club.

====2012 season====
In 2012, Cooke and Horgan set about building on the foundations of the previous season. Cooke finally had his own team of players and despite having less than a tenth of the budget that the club had in the glory days under Paul Doolin, Drogheda have had their best season by far since then. Between 1 June and 4 August, Drogheda went on an eight-game winning run in the league and cup – the longest winning run in the club&#x27;s history. On 23 September 2012, Drogheda won the final of the EA Sports Cup beating Shamrock Rovers 3–1 – their first trophy since 2007. The icing on the cake came on 19 October when Drogheda beat the newly crowned 2012 League Champions Sligo Rovers 2–1 at United Park through a first half Alan McNally header and 88th minute Brian Gannon chip to qualify for the Europa League.

====2013 season====
In 2013, Drogheda reached three finals and despite failing to add to their silverware, reflected the club&#x27;s rise under Cooke. They were beaten 7–1 in the Setanta Cup final by Shamrock Rovers and 2–0 in the League Cup final by the same opponent. They also reached their first FAI Cup final since winning the competition in 2005, narrowly losing out on a 3-2 thriller against Sligo Rovers. In the Europa League qualifying rounds that season, the club were drawn against Swedish giants Malmö and only lost by a single goal over two legs after a battling performance. Despite this success, Mick Cooke left the club by mutual consent at the end of the season.

=== 2015–2020: First Division ===

====2016 and 2017 seasons====
In November 2015 Drogheda appointed former UCD manager Pete Mahon as manager of the club. John Gill took over as assistant manager with Mark Kinsella ex Irish international remaining part of the coaching staff.

In 2015, Drogheda were relegated after finishing bottom of the league. The following season they finished second in the First Division, achieving promotion through the play-offs, before being relegated again after another 12th-place finish in 2017. In 2018, Tim Clancy was appointed as manager after the departure of Mahon.

====2018 season====
Clancy&#x27;s first season in charge of the Drogs saw them finish in 4th place, after a rebuild of the squad who were relegated in 2017. It was enough for a place in the playoffs, but despite beating Shelbourne on penalties after 2 legs, Drogheda failed to beat Finn Harps on aggregate, meaning they would remain in the second tier. Harps would go on to win promotion after defeating Limerick 3–0 on aggregate.

====2019 season====
2019 was a bittersweet year for Drogheda. They managed to maintain a close title race with Shelbourne up until the penultimate game of the season, when the Reds beat them 3–1 on home soil to secure the title. A second-place finish granted them a playoff spot yet again, and after a 6–2 aggregate win over Cabinteely, they reached the playoff final, meeting Finn Harps for the second year running. Unfortunately for the Drogs, a late winner from Chris Lyons at United Park was not enough, as they shipped 2 goals in the second leg in Ballybofey, condemning them to playoff heartbreak once again. On 30 October, the club and wider Drogheda community was rocked by the passing of a legendary figure, Vincent Hoey, fondly remembered as &quot;Mr. Drogheda United&quot;, former chairman and the man responsible for keeping the club afloat through their years of administration

====2020 season====
Drogheda were pipped as favourites to go all the way in the 2020 season, as Tim Clancy strengthened his team with the additions of former captain Derek Prendergast, as well as Brandon Bermingham, Hugh Douglas and David Odumosu. United opened their season with a 2–0 away win at Cobh Ramblers on 22 February, followed by a 1–0 home loss to Longford Town F.C. 6 days later. They hammered relegated side UCD 5–1 at home on 6 March, and sat top of the table with 6 points when the league was suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic on 12 March. A break of over 3 months would follow, and they finally returned to action with a 2–2 draw to Shamrock Rovers II on 2 August, without spectators. The Drogs only lost 3 games between the months of August and November, and their title race with Bray Wanderers went down to the final day, when they travelled to the Stradbrook to face Cabinteely on 27 October. At the beginning of the evening, Drogheda were 1 point behind their Wicklow counterparts, but a 2–0 win courtesy of goals from James Brown and Luke Heeney meant they would lift the trophy on a historic night which granted them a place in the 2021 League of Ireland Premier Division.

=== 2021-present: back in the Premier Division ===

====2021 season====
There was little expectation on the newly promoted Drogs team as the 2021 season approached, but this changed when Tim Clancy began his recruitment. The young coach managed to attract the experienced heads of Gary Deegan, Dane Massey, Dinny Corcoran and Ronan Murray, all veterans of the league. Darragh Markey and Daniel O&#x27;Reilly also added to an already very youthful and talented group of players. The season was opened on 19 March when Drogheda beat Waterford 1–0 at home. A 4–0 away win against rivals Longford Town on 10 April turned heads the way of the County Louth side, but they had to wait a bit longer for their next 3 points of the campaign, a 7-0 thumping of Waterford&#x27;s reserve side at the RSC on 8 May. This was followed by a 4-game winning run, including a 3–1 win over Saint Patrick&#x27;s Athletic on 14 May, a 1–0 away victory at Finn Harps, and a 4–1 home win against Longford. Another impressive performance came when Drogheda won 2–1 against Sligo Rovers at the Showgrounds on 12 June, Chris Lyons scoring a brace. Their surprise victories meant the newly promoted side were pushing for European places deep into the season, when many expected them to be in a relegation dogfight. On 20 August, Drogheda pulled off a historic victory over their rivals Dundalk at Oriel Park, the first time they had done so for 9 years, courtesy of a Mark Doyle brace. Just over 2 weeks later, they defeated Bohemians at Head In The Game Park. Their last win of the season came against high fliers Derry City on 24 October. Unfortunately for the Drogs, they finished the season with 3 losses in a row, but it didn&#x27;t manage to take away from their impressive season, finishing 7th with a respectable 44 points, and making sure of a Premier Division place for 2022

====2022-2024 season====
Drogheda&#x27;s impressive 2021 campaign meant their squad was practically torn apart by the bigger clubs in the pre season of 2022. Their manager, Tim Clancy, was signed by St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic. Shelbourne legend Kevin Doherty, who had been assistant manager to Clancy since 2018, assumed the role of first team manager, and former Longford Town coach Daire Doyle joined his management team. Key players such as Killian Phillips and James Brown secured lucrative moves to the UK. Doherty had a big job on his hands to paper the cracks left in his team, but did well to hang on to a number of key players, as well as recruiting others. Drogheda grabbed their first win of the season on 4 March, beating UCD 4–2 at home. On 18 March, Drogheda beat their Louth rivals Dundalk for the 3rd time in 4 games. On 20 May, 10 man Drogheda came back from a 1–0 deficit to beat Finn Harps at home, with 3 goals in the final 20 minutes. They followed this up with a historic home victory over league champions Shamrock Rovers 3 days later, and a 1–1 draw at Dalymount Park against Bohemians on 27 May. On 9 July, Dean Williams scored one of the fastest goals in League of Ireland history, when his 1st-minute strike gave Drogheda their second derby win of the season at home to Dundalk. They secured safety with a 1–0 victory over Bohemians on 7 October, and finished the season in 8th place with 38 points.
2024 saw them collect their second FAI Cup win over Derry City under manager Kevin Doherty and six days later they secured their Premier Division survival with a 3-1 win over Bray Wanderers in the promotion relegation play off.

== The Claret &amp; Blue Club ==
In response to the economic difficulties facing the country, a group of supporters established The Claret &amp; Blue Club in June 2009 with the aim of providing a steady income stream to Drogheda United FC. Supporters who join the Claret &amp; Blue Club donate at least €5 per week to the club, and in return, they receive a membership card entitling them to discounts of up to 10% in a range of local businesses, including restaurants, tile shops, shoe shops and many more. Each member is also entered in a monthly prize draw, with a top prize every month of a sun holiday courtesy of Panorama Holidays. Other prizes include hotel vouchers, tickets to Irish World Cup qualifier games, betting vouchers etc. Publicity on the Derek Mooney Show on RTÉ Radio one and full-page ads in the Drogheda Independent and Drogheda People resulted in a surge of membership, and after only four weeks of existence, the Claret &amp; Blue Club was in a position to bring in over €35,000 to the club annually, with membership figures rising daily. It was hoped that the Claret &amp; Blue Club will take full ownership of the club in 2010 and run the club similar to the way Shamrock Rovers is run by the Shamrock Rovers Members Club. However the target of 500 members was not reached and membership levels settled at just over half that target.

=== Share issue ===
In January 2011, a Claret and Blue Club steering committee announced new plans for a share issue. It was hoped that 200 shares would be sold at €1000 each and that this new revenue would provide stability for 2011–12 and allow the club to finally become a supporter-owned community club. In early 2012 Drogheda United became a member&#x27;s owned and run club when a new company Drogheda Utd FC Limited was formed consisting of members who paid €1,000 each into the company.

== Emblem ==
 The crest of Drogheda United is an adaptation of the town arms of Drogheda, which feature the heraldic symbols of a star and crescent over a shield depicting St. Lawrence&#x27;s Gate, three lions and a ship. The three lions passant – as Drogheda lay within the Pale and was a besieged garrison town – and the ship represents the town&#x27;s port.

The club crest focuses on the star and crescent element of the town arms of Drogheda.

They share the same club colours as Trabzonspor, in Turkey – and in 2011 the two sides became sister clubs.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Drogs is a nickname for supporters of the club. When the name Drogs started to appear in two newspapers in the late 1990s, The Sun and the Drogheda Leader, the club wrote to the Drogheda Leader Newspaper demanding that the name not be used adding that it was not used in the stadium by the fans. The newspaper argued that it had not invented the name and that the fans in the shed side of the stadium often sing a song called Super Drogs. The club considered the name was degrading and was purely a Drogheda Leader nickname not used by the supporters. In recent years the club officially embraced the nickname.

The most vocal supporters stand on &quot;the shed side&quot; of United Park. Many Drogs attend every home match while a smaller group travel around the country to support the team at away matches. They sing football/Drogheda United chants, wear club colours (claret and blue), wave banners and flags and generally try to help lift the team and demonstrate fervent support. One section of their supporters are known as &#x27;F45U&#x27; (Famous 45 Ultras.)

Drogheda United Supporters Club (DUSC) was formed more than two years ago. Its main aim is to promote Drogheda United F.C. throughout the community. The supporters club works hand-in-hand with the football club in various ways including contributing to the match day programme, organising fund raising nights like quizzes and race nights and by organising buses to away matches.

Drogheda United&#x27;s main rivalry is with their neighbour club Dundalk FC, with whom they contest the Louth Derby. The club&#x27;s home grounds lie no more than 35 km apart, and fans regularly travel in their numbers to witness the encounter. Fans of the respective clubs despise each other and it makes for one of the biggest rivalries in the country. Since 2010, Dundalk have had the better share of results, but since Drogheda&#x27;s promotion from the First Division in 2020, it has been quite an even encounter, with 5 wins for Dundalk and 4 wins for Drogheda.

Following Dundalk&#x27;s relegation to the second tier in 2024, Drogheda&#x27;s nearest Premier Division opponents became Shelbourne. This fixture is usually a fiery encounter due to both teams historically competing in close proximity to each other on the league table, and the number of former Shelbourne players in the Drogheda United camp.

In 2023, Drogheda United became a sister club of Walsall F.C. in England, due to the Trivela Group&#x27;s shared ownership of both teams. This partnership has reaped rewards for both sides, with Emmanuel Adegboyega, Freddie Draper, Evan Weir and Douglas James-Taylor all having moved between the clubs in recent seasons. In July 2024, they contested a friendly match at Weavers Park, in which Drogheda won on penalties after a 1-1 draw. The occasion strengthened the bond between Drogheda United supporters and the travelling Walsall contingent, and the fans maintain a good relationship with one another.

<doc id="1233042" wikidata="Q1456042" url="?curid=1233042" title="Hadronization">
<text>Hadronization (or hadronisation) is the process of the formation of hadrons out of quarks and gluons. There are two main branches of hadronization: quark-gluon plasma (QGP) transformation and colour string decay into hadrons. The transformation of quark-gluon plasma into hadrons is studied in lattice QCD numerical simulations, which are explored in relativistic heavy-ion experiments. Quark-gluon plasma hadronization occurred shortly after the Big Bang when the quark–gluon plasma cooled down to the Hagedorn temperature (about 150 MeV) when free quarks and gluons cannot exist. In string breaking new hadrons are forming out of quarks, antiquarks and sometimes gluons, spontaneously created from the vacuum.

== Statistical hadronization ==
A highly successful description of QGP hadronization is based on statistical phase space weighting according to the Fermi–Pomeranchuk model of particle production. This approach was developed, since 1950, initially as a qualitative description of strongly interacting particle production. It was originally not meant to be an accurate description, but a phase space estimate of upper limit to particle yield. In the following years numerous hadronic resonances were discovered. Rolf Hagedorn postulated the statistical bootstrap model (SBM) allowing to describe hadronic interactions in terms of statistical resonance weights and the resonance mass spectrum. This turned the qualitative Fermi–Pomeranchuk model into a precise statistical hadronization model for particle production. However, this property of hadronic interactions poses a challenge for the statistical hadronization model as the yield of particles is sensitive to the unidentified high mass hadron resonance states. The statistical hadronization model was first applied to relativistic heavy-ion collisions in 1991, which lead to the recognition of the first strange anti-baryon signature of quark-gluon plasma discovered at CERN.

==Phenomenological studies of string model and fragmentation==
The QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) of the hadronization process are not yet fully understood, but are modeled and parameterized in a number of phenomenological studies, including the Lund string model and in various long-range QCD approximation schemes.

The tight cone of particles created by the hadronization of a single quark is called a jet. In particle detectors, jets are observed rather than quarks, whose existence must be inferred. The models and approximation schemes and their predicted jet hadronization, or fragmentation, have been extensively compared with measurement in a number of high energy particle physics experiments, e.g. TASSO, OPAL and H1.

Hadronization can be explored using Monte Carlo simulation. After the particle shower has terminated, partons with virtualities (how far off shell the virtual particles are) on the order of the cut-off scale remain. From this point on, the parton is in the low momentum transfer, long-distance regime in which non-perturbative effects become important. The most dominant of these effects is hadronization, which converts partons into observable hadrons. No exact theory for hadronization is known but there are two successful models for parameterization.

These models are used within event generators which simulate particle physics events. The scale at which partons are given to the hadronization is fixed by the shower Monte Carlo component of the event generator. Hadronization models typically start at some predefined scale of their own. This can cause significant issue if not set up properly within the Shower Monte Carlo. Common choices of shower Monte Carlo are PYTHIA and HERWIG. Each of these correspond to one of the two parameterization models.

==The top quark does not hadronize==
The top quark, however, decays via the weak force with a mean lifetime of 5×10−25 seconds. Unlike all other weak interactions, which typically are much slower than strong interactions, the top quark weak decay is uniquely shorter than the time scale at which the strong force of QCD acts, so a top quark decays before it can hadronize. The top quark is therefore almost a free particle.

<text>Cyrillic numerals are a numeral system derived from the Cyrillic script, developed in the First Bulgarian Empire in the late 10th century. It was used in the First Bulgarian Empire and by South and East Slavic peoples. The system was used in Russia as late as the early 18th century, when Peter the Great replaced it with Hindu-Arabic numerals as part of his civil script reform initiative. Cyrillic numbers played a role in Peter the Great&#x27;s currency reform plans, too, with silver wire kopecks issued after 1696 and mechanically minted coins issued between 1700 and 1722 inscribed with the date using Cyrillic numerals. By 1725, Russian Imperial coins had transitioned to Arabic numerals. The Cyrillic numerals may still be found in books written in the Church Slavonic language.

==General description==
The system is a quasi-decimal alphabetic numeral system, equivalent to the Ionian numeral system but written with the corresponding graphemes of the Cyrillic script. The order is based on the original Greek alphabet rather than the standard Cyrillic alphabetical order. 

A separate letter is assigned to each unit (1, 2, ... 9), each multiple of ten (10, 20, ... 90), and each multiple of one hundred (100, 200, ... 900). To distinguish numbers from text, a titlo () is sometimes drawn over the numbers, or they are set apart with dots. The numbers are written as pronounced in Slavonic, generally from the high value position to the low value position, with the exception of 11 through 19, which are written and pronounced with the ones unit before the tens; for example, ЗІ (17) is &quot;семнадсять&quot; (literally &quot;seven-on-ten&quot;, cf. the English &quot;seven-teen&quot;).

Examples:
* () – 1706
* () – 7118
*A long titlo may be used for long runs of numbers: .

To evaluate a Cyrillic number, the values of all the figures are added up: for example, ѰЗ is 700 + 7, making 707. If the number is greater than 999 (ЦЧѲ), the thousands sign (҂) is used to multiply the number&#x27;s value: for example, ҂Ѕ is 6000, while ҂Л҂В is parsed as 30,000 + 2000, making 32,000. To produce larger numbers, a modifying sign is used to encircle the number being multiplied. Two scales existed in such cases (similar to the long and short scales): one is &#x27;Малый счёт&#x27; or Lesser Count, giving a new name and sign every order of magnitude, and the other is &#x27;Великий счёт&#x27; or Greater Count, where every name and sign is the previous one squared, up until 1048- instead of going to 1096, it goes to 1049.

<doc id="1233062" wikidata="Q7390405" url="?curid=1233062" title="SIMPLE IRA">
<text>A Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees Individual Retirement Account, commonly known by the abbreviation &quot;SIMPLE IRA&quot;, is a type of tax-deferred employer-provided retirement plan in the United States that allows employees to set aside money and invest it to grow for retirement. Specifically, it is a type of Individual Retirement Account (IRA) that is set up as an employer-provided plan. It is an employer sponsored plan, like better-known plans such as the 401(k) and 403(b) (Tax Sheltered Annuity plans), but offers simpler and less costly administration rules, as it is subject to ERISA and its associated regulations. Like a 401(k) plan, the SIMPLE IRA can be funded with pre-tax salary contributions, but those contributions are still subject to Social Security, Medicare, and Federal Unemployment Tax Act taxes. Contribution limits for SIMPLE plans are lower than for most other types of employer-provided retirement plans as compared to conventional defined contribution plans like Section 402(g), 401(k), 401(a), and 403(b) plans.

==Rules==
*Only an &quot;eligible employer&quot; may establish a SIMPLE IRA. An eligible employer is one with no more than 100 employees. An employer who has already established a SIMPLE IRA may continue to be &quot;eligible&quot; for two years after crossing the 100-employee limit.
*Employees are not required to make regular IRA contributions to their SIMPLE IRA account.
*A SIMPLE IRA requires a certain minimum contribution from the employer. The employer may either: 
** Match the contributions of each employees dollar-for-dollar up to 3% of the employee&#x27;s compensation (or a smaller percentage in certain cases); or 
** Contribute a flat 2% of the compensation for each employee with at least $5,000 in compensation for the year, regardless of the amount the employee contributes.
*Employees who are not yet age 50 are allowed to contribute up to $14,000 in 2022. Participants who are age 50 or older are allowed to contribute $17,000 for 2022. These limits are different from the limits that apply to 401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans.
*The SIMPLE plan can technically be funded with either an IRA or a 401(k). There is almost no benefit to funding it with a 401(k), because the lower contribution limits of the SIMPLE are required as is the expensive extra administration of the 401(k).
*An employee is allowed to make a direct rollover from a SIMPLE IRA into a Traditional IRA after at least two years has passed from the date the employee first participated in the plan.
*An employee is allowed to make a direct rollover from an IRA, a 401(k), or a 403(b) into a SIMPLE IRA after two years of participation. An employee is allowed to make a direct rollover from another SIMPLE plan into a SIMPLE IRA during the first two years of participation in a SIMPLE IRA.

If a participant, who is not yet 59½ years old, wishes to take a distribution and it has been less than two years since their first contribution into the plan, they could be required to pay a penalty of up to 25% (10% if more than two years) to the Internal Revenue Service. This two-year rule applies to all distributions, including rollovers from the SIMPLE IRA. Any amount withdrawn and not rolled over, regardless of age, is also subject to ordinary income tax for the year in which the distribution is made.

<doc id="1233070" wikidata="Q1670674" url="?curid=1233070" title="Mineral lick">
<text>A mineral lick (also known as a salt lick) is a place where animals can go to lick essential mineral nutrients from a deposit of salts and other minerals. Mineral licks can be naturally occurring or artificial (such as blocks of salt that farmers place in pastures for livestock to lick). Natural licks are common, and they provide essential elements such as phosphorus and the biometals (sodium, calcium, iron, zinc, and trace elements) required for bone, muscle and other growth in herbivorous mammals such as deer, moose, elephants, hippos, rhinos, giraffes, zebras, wildebeests, tapirs, woodchucks, fox squirrels, mountain goats, porcupines, and frugivorous bats. Such licks are especially important in ecosystems such as tropical rainforests and grasslands with poor general availability of nutrients. Harsh weather exposes salty mineral deposits that draw animals from miles away for a taste of needed nutrients. It is thought that certain fauna can detect calcium in salt licks.

==Overview==
Many animals regularly visit mineral licks to consume clay, supplementing their diet with nutrients and minerals. In tropical bats, lick visitation is associated with a diet based on wild figs (&quot;Ficus&quot;), which have very low levels of sodium, and licks are mostly used by females that are pregnant or lactating.

Some animals require the minerals at these sites not for nutrition, but to ward off the effects of secondary compounds that are included in the arsenal of plant defences against herbivory. The minerals of these sites usually contain calcium, magnesium, sulfur, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium. Mineral lick sites play a critical role in the ecology and diversity of organisms that visit these sites, but little is still understood about the dietary benefits.

The paths animals made to natural mineral licks and watering holes became the hunting paths predators and early humans used for hunting. It is hypothesized that these salt and water paths became trails and later roads for early humans.

Nonetheless, many studies have identified other uses and nutritional benefits from other micronutrients that exist at these sites, including selenium, cobalt and/or molybdenum. In addition to the utilization of mineral licks, many animals suffer from traffic collisions as they gather to lick salts accumulated on road surfaces. Animals also consume soil (geophagy) to obtain minerals, such as moose from Canada mining for minerals from the root wads of fallen trees.

==Artificial salt licks==
Artificial salt licks are used in the husbandry of livestock and to attract or maintain wildlife, whether it be for viewing, photography, farming, or hunting purposes. Maintaining artificial salt licks as a form of baiting is illegal in some states in the United States, but legal in others. Inadvertent salt licks may lead to unintended wildlife-human interactions.

==History==
===In the Americas===
The indigenous peoples of the Americas and the longhunter watched salt licks to hunt game. Many became well-known, including Bledsoe Lick in Sumner County, Tennessee; the Blue Lick in central Kentucky; &#x27;Great Buffalo Lick&#x27; in Kanawha Salines, now present-day Malden, West Virginia; the French Lick in southern Indiana; and the Blackwater Lick in Blackwater, Lee County, Virginia.

===Mythology===
In Norse mythology, before the creation of the world, the divine cow Auðumbla licked salty ice for three days and uncovered Búri, ancestor of the gods and grandfather of Odin. On the first day as Auðumbla licked, Buri&#x27;s hair appeared from the ice, on the second day his head, and the third his body.

<text>California State Parks is the state park system for the U.S. state of California. The system is administered by the California Department of Parks and Recreation, a department under the California Natural Resources Agency. The California State Parks system is the largest state park system in the United States.

California State Parks administers 279 separate park units on , with over of California coastline; of lake and river frontage; nearly 15,000 campsites; and of hiking, biking, and equestrian trails. Headquartered in Sacramento, park administration is divided into 21 districts. 

==History==

California&#x27;s first state park was the Yosemite Grant, which today constitutes part of Yosemite National Park. In 1864, the federal government set aside Yosemite Valley for preservation and ceded the land to the state, which managed the famous glacial valley until 1906.

California&#x27;s oldest state park, Big Basin Redwoods State Park, was founded in 1902. Until 1921, each park was managed by an independent commission or agency.

In 1927, the California Legislature, with the support of Governor C. C. Young, established the State Park Commission, and its original membership included: Major Frederick R. Burnham, W. F. Chandler, William E. Colby (Secretary), Henry W. O&#x27;Melveny, and Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur. The following year, a newly established State Park Commission began gathering support for the first state park bond issue. Its efforts were rewarded in 1928 when Californians voted nearly three-to-one in favor of a $6 million park bond act. In addition, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. completed a statewide survey of potential park lands that defined basic long-range goals and provided guidance for the acquisition and development of state parks. With Newton B. Drury (later to be named director of the National Park Service) serving as acquisition officer, the new system of state parks rapidly began to grow. William Penn Mott Jr. served as director of the agency under Governor Ronald Reagan.

In May 2008, the National Trust for Historic Preservation listed the park system as a whole on their list of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Places.

On January 10, 2008, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s office announced that the California State Park System will consider indefinite closures of all or part of 48 specific individual parks (one in five) to help meet the challenges of the looming (projected) $14.5 billion deficit facing California for its 2008-2009 budget year. On September 25, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger&#x27;s office announced that all state parks would remain open during the 2009-2010 fiscal year using one-time budget reduction methods in maintenance, equipment, and services.

A record wet winter in 2023 caused more than $210 million in storm damage to California&#x27;s State Parks.

==Operation==

Responsible for almost one-third of California&#x27;s scenic coastline (280 miles), California State Parks manages the state&#x27;s finest coastal wetlands, estuaries, beaches, and dune systems. California State Parks contains the largest and most diverse natural and cultural heritage holdings of any state agency in the nation. State park units include underwater preserves, reserves, and parks; redwood, rhododendron, and wildlife reserves; state beaches, recreation areas, wilderness areas, and reservoirs; state historic parks, historic homes, Spanish era adobe buildings, including museums, visitor centers, cultural reserves, and preserves; as well as lighthouses, caverns, ghost towns, water slides, conference centers, and off-highway vehicle parks. 

These parks protect and preserve an unparalleled collection of culturally and environmentally sensitive structures and habitats, threatened plant and animal species, ancient Native American sites, historic structures and artifacts. The Department employs State Park Peace Officers Law Enforcement to protect and preserve the State Parks and the millions of people who visit them each year. Parks are patrolled by sworn State Park Peace Officers, of which there are two classifications, State Park Ranger and State Park Lifeguards.

Subdivisions of California State Parks include the California Office of Historic Preservation, Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation Division, and the Boating &amp; Waterways Division.

;Parks Forward Commission
The Parks Forward Commission was formed after the California Legislature called for the formation of a multidisciplinary advisory council to conduct an independent assessment and make recommendations. The commission issued a report in 2015 that noted the lack of maintenance for many parks along with visitors who do not reflect the diversity of California&#x27;s population. The report also said the agency is using outdated technology for managing the parks and providing reservations while being overwhelmed by the responsibility for managing the park system.

==Classification==
The sites managed and preserved by the department are categorized into different types. There are 87 State Parks, 63 State Beaches, 51 State Historic Parks, 32 State Recreation Areas, 16 State Natural Reserves, 14 State Park Properties, 8 Vehicular Recreation Areas, 2 State Marine Reserves, 1 State Historical Monument, 1 State Seashore, and 1 Wayside Park.

The Public Resources Code provides the classification of units of the state park system. All units that are or will become part of the system, except those units or parts of units designated by the state legislature as wilderness areas or are subject to any other provision of law are classified by the State Park and Recreation Commission into one of these classifications.

===State Park===

State Parks &quot;consist of relatively spacious areas of outstanding scenic or natural character, oftentimes also containing significant [...] values. State recreation units &quot;consist of areas selected, developed, and operated to provide outdoor recreational opportunities&quot; and are classified as either State Recreation Areas, Underwater Recreation Areas, State Beaches, and Wayside Campgrounds.

===State Recreation Area===
State Recreation Areas consist of &quot;areas selected and developed to provide multiple recreational opportunities,&quot; and are selected for &quot;having terrain capable of withstanding extensive human impact and for their proximity to large population centers, major routes of travel, or proven recreational resources.&quot; &quot;Underwater Recreation Areas&quot; consist of &quot;areas in the nonmarine aquatic environment selected and developed to provide surface and subsurface water-oriented recreational opportunities...&quot; 

===State Beach===

State Beaches consist of &quot;areas with frontage on the ocean or bays designed to provide beach-oriented recreational activities.&quot; &quot;Wayside Campgrounds&quot; consist of &quot;relatively small areas suitable for overnight camping and offering convenient access to major highways.&quot; Historical units are &quot;nonmarine areas established primarily to preserve objects of historical, archaeological, and scientific interest, and archaeological sites and places commemorating important persons or historic events.&quot; &quot;State seashores&quot; &quot;consist of relatively spacious coastline areas with frontage on the ocean, or on bays open to the ocean [...] possessing outstanding scenic or natural character and significant recreational, historical, archaeological, or geological values.&quot;

===State Historic Parks===

State Historic Parks consists of 47 specially-designated historic sites across California, that highlight crucial events in the history of California and provide an educational opportunity for those interested in learning about Californian history, namely students. These include battlegrounds, Californian missions, historic estates, cave paintings, and colonial fortifications, among others.

===State Reserve===

State Reserves &quot;consist of areas embracing outstanding natural or scenic characteristics or areas containing outstanding cultural resources of statewide significance,&quot; and are classified as either &quot;State Natural Reserves&quot; which consist of areas selected and managed to preserve their ecology, fauna, flora, geological features, and scenic qualities &quot;in a condition of undisturbed integrity,&quot; or &quot;State Cultural Reserves&quot; which consist of areas selected and managed to preserve the integrity of historic structures and features as well as areas with spiritual significance to California indigenous people.

===State Wilderness===
State Wildernesses are areas where the environment has not been affected by humans and are relatively undeveloped state-owned or leased lands which have retained their original characters and influence or have been restored to a near-natural appearance. State wildernesses can be established within other state parks system units. &quot;Natural preserves&quot; are nonmarine areas of outstanding natural or scientific significance established within the boundaries of other units to preserve features natural features such as rare or endangered species and their supporting ecosystems. &quot;Cultural preserves&quot; are those established also within other units to preserve cultural features such as sites, buildings or zones important to the human history of California.

===State Marine Reserve===

State Marine Reserves have a uniform classifications established by the Marine Managed Areas Improvement Act: State Marine Reserve, State Marine Park, State Marine Conservation Area, State Marine Cultural Preservation Area, and State Marine Recreational Management Area.

<doc id="1233074" wikidata="Q5146983" url="?curid=1233074" title="Collegiate a cappella">
<text>Collegiate a cappella (or college a cappella) ensembles are college-affiliated singing groups, primarily in the United States, and, increasingly, the United Kingdom and Ireland, that perform entirely without musical instruments. The groups are typically composed of, operated by, and directed by students. In the context of collegiate a cappella, the term &quot;a cappella&quot; typically also refers to the music genre performed by pop-centric student singing groups. Consequently, an ensemble that sings unaccompanied classical music may not be considered an a cappella group, even though technically it is performing &quot;a cappella&quot;.

According to the nonfiction book &quot;Pitch Perfect&quot;, &quot;a cappella&quot; music is one of the oldest forms of music in existence, &quot;the kind made without any accompaniment at all,&quot; and descended from the tradition of Gregorian chant. A cappella music as a form joined this early form with a later Puritan style, known as shape-note singing, which further extended into the American Gospel tradition. Further permutations leaked into the American pop landscape. Today, by some accounts, there exist as many as “twelve hundred collegiate a cappella groups in the United States alone.”

==History==
The RPI Glee Club of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, established in 1873, was one of the earliest known collegiate a cappella groups. The longest continuously operating group is thought to be The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was formed in 1909 to create a musical group with a more &quot;modern&quot; sound than that of the Yale Glee Club, and named for the lyrics to &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, a popular Broadway song at the time. Such names, normally intended for comedic effect, have come to define in some part the irreverent attitude found in modern collegiate a cappella. For example, the second-oldest continuously performing a cappella group (and oldest all-male group) is Yale&#x27;s Society of Orpheus and Bacchus, or &quot;SOB&#x27;s&quot;. The first a cappella groups at other American Ivy League universities include Notes and Keys of Columbia, which were founded in 1909, the same year as the Whiffenpoofs; the Princeton Nassoons (c.1941); the Dartmouth Aires (1946); the Harvard Krokodiloes (1946); Cayuga&#x27;s Waiters of Cornell University (1949); and the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949). The Smith College Smiffenpoofs are the oldest continuous soprano/alto a cappella group, founded in 1936.

In recent years, online a cappella communities have come together, allowing for greater involvement in the shaping of modern a cappella music, including stylistic trends. Among the most prominent online a cappella presences are the A Cappella Blog, Varsity Vocals, and CASA (The Contemporary A Cappella Society). According to The A Cappella Blog&#x27;s information section, &quot;The A Cappella Blog was founded in January 2007. Since that time, the site has reviewed over 40 International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella competitions. 

Similarly, the Varsity Vocals compose an international a cappella organization based around their two main competitions, the ICCA (International Competition of Collegiate A Cappella) and the ICHSA (International Competition of High School A Cappella). The South Asian a cappella competitive circuit is governed by the Association of South-Asian A Cappella (ASA), a non-profit organization formed in 2016, with some collegiate teams that compete in both circuits.

Collegiate a cappella is by far most common in the United States from which it originated; however in recent decades the trend has spread beyond to universities in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in Europe as well as up north into Canada and across the Pacific into Australia, New Zealand and a few nations in Asia.

==Modern growth==
College a cappella has grown rapidly since 1980. This growth was fueled in part by stylistic changes that had widespread appeal, and in part by the founding in 1991 of the Contemporary A Cappella Society (CASA) by Deke Sharon and Rex Solomon, which enabled interaction and collaboration of a cappella groups across the United States for the first time.

Sharon, a member of the Tufts a cappella group The Beelzebubs, co-created CASA after two years as the group&#x27;s musical director. Sharon sought to bring a cappella into the musical mainstream, popularizing a more pop format for the music, as well as helping to contribute to a standardization of a cappella performance through the founding of CASA.

One of CASA&#x27;s core values in its promotion of the a cappella community is that of innovation, stating &quot;We develop new methods for singers, groups, fans, and educators to sing, learn, connect, and interact with one another.&quot;

The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, marking a shift away from the more traditional sounds of jazz or classical ensembles and glee clubs to contemporary a cappella, with groups focusing on modern pop music, complete with complex textures and a driving beat (see vocal percussion). Today, even some glee clubs have a largely pop-music repertoire supplemented only in small part by the traditional genres.

In modern competing a cappella groups, there are several techniques that are making each group more and more distinctive. Beatboxing is at the top among them, but tone, sound effects, style, blend, and harmonies are all unique, too.

==Performance styles==

Collegiate a cappella spans many music genres and styles including jazz, pop, jazz-influenced pop, fusion, barbershop, rhythm and blues, madrigals, alternative and hard rock, comedy, Jewish (including Yiddish or Hebrew songs), Christian (including Christian pop and rearranged hymns), and South Asian fusion. Differences in musical styles and individual group preferences result in a great diversity of music arrangements and performances.

===Costume===
The costumes and uniforms that the groups display present a message to the audience. They may vary in levels of uniformity and formality. Each group has a &quot;brand&quot; and a &quot;look/style&quot; to their members. Costumes can be whatever a group wants them to be, but aesthetic appearances is a pleasing visual for the audience and, most importantly, the judges.

===Choreography===
Within the ICCA and ICHSA is a point system. Each group is judged based on several things, some of which including sound, blend, harmonies, choreography, and many more. Choreography is a big factor in determining how many points a group will get, and how clean and precise their movements are is also vital.

===Arch sing===

An &quot;arch sing&quot; is a casual, public performance, often held in an archway for reasons of acoustics and shelter from the weather. Typically, one or more a cappella groups will perform for a small audience, either as a concert or to promote upcoming concerts. The term is also sometimes used to describe similar casual, outdoor performances not held under arches.

===Live techniques===
In recent years, with the advent of more advanced audio equipment and the ability of a cappella groups to attract income with live performances for pay, there has been increased exploration into the importance of microphones. Whereas groups at schools with older campuses find themselves with arches and naturally acoustically accentuated spaces in which to perform, many groups find themselves lacking spaces such as these. Individual microphone use for each member of an ensemble has risen in popularity, allowing for, as Mike Chin of the A Cappella Blog states, a &quot;big...clear...crisp&quot; sound in an otherwise acoustically dull performance space. In addition, the use of individual microphones allows for added effects to be applied to a group&#x27;s live vocals, such as adding a digital lower octave (or &quot;octavizing&quot;) the bass vocalist to produce a tone that is outside the natural range of most singers. The integration of these technological advancements continues to shape the sound of modern a cappella music at the college level and beyond.

==Group structure and culture==
Most collegiate a cappella groups, whether all-male identifying, all-female identifying, or mixed, share similar traits. The groups often benefit from the talent of non-music majors who have significant experience with music, choral singing, or both. Participation in such groups provides both a social and creative outlet for students who are pursuing other academic fields. Groups are generally self-sustaining and often entirely run by students. Some groups receive financial support from their educational institution while others are entirely self-supporting.
Unlike professional groups, which typically have four to seven members, collegiate groups typically perform with eight to sixteen members, with full group rosters measuring up to 30 members in some cases. This large roster size is often driven by necessity, as college groups tend to see high turnover due to graduation and changing student commitments. A large member count enables a group to maintain continuity over time and it also affects the group&#x27;s aural aesthetic. For example, a large group may be able to perform arrangements that have more than a dozen separate parts, an impossible feat for smaller groups.

Some groups record albums of their music, typically at intervals of two or three years. The quality of such albums has recently improved markedly due to an increased focus on multi-track recording, greater access to home recording technology, and the emergence of professional a cappella production specialists (including arrangers, vocal editors, and mix/mastering engineers). Achievements in collegiate a cappella recording are recognized by awards programs (e.g., the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards, awarded by CASA) and compilation albums, such as the long-running Best of College A Cappella series.

Many college groups compete in annual competitions organized by the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA), which conducts various regional competitions, with winners of regional competitions advancing to a national competition. The South-Asian a cappella circuit, run by ASA, also conducts various regional competitions leading up to All-American Awaaz, their national championship.

<text>Pablo Santos (9 January 1987 – 15 September 2006) was a Mexican actor.

== Career ==
Santos was born in Monterrey, Nuevo León. At the age of 12 he moved with his family to Los Angeles, California. He began an acting career and starred as the son of a Mexican-Irish-American family portrayed in &quot;Greetings from Tucson&quot;, which ran on the WB network from 2002 to 2003.

After the series ended, he appeared in the 2004 film &quot;Party Animalz&quot;. He also appeared in television shows such as &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and &quot;Boston Public&quot;.

== Death ==
Santos died on 15 September 2006 in a plane crash at Toluca International Airport in Toluca, west of Mexico City. He was flying as a passenger, seated on the floor with no restraints, in a chartered plane (a Piper PA-46 Malibu) flown by a commercial pilot, from Monterrey to Acapulco with five friends to celebrate Mexican Independence Day when the plane crashed over a mile (1.6 km) short of the runway while the pilot was attempting an emergency landing at an intermediate airport in Toluca due to low fuel levels. Another passenger, Martel Fernández, was declared brain-dead the following day; his life support was terminated. All others on board were hospitalized for minor injuries. The aircraft was certified to carry six persons, including the pilot, and there were six seats in the plane, yet there were seven people onboard.

<text>Bösendorfer (L. Bösendorfer Klavierfabrik GmbH) is an Austrian piano manufacturer and, since 2008, a wholly owned subsidiary of Yamaha Corporation. Bösendorfer is unusual in that it produces 97- and 92-key models in addition to instruments with standard 88-key keyboards.

==History==

Bösendorfer, one of the oldest piano manufacturers, was established in 1828 by Ignaz Bösendorfer. It has a history of producing highly respected instruments.

In 1830, it was granted the status of official piano maker to the Emperor of Austria.

Ignaz&#x27;s son Ludwig Bösendorfer (1835–1919) assumed control in 1859, operating from new premises from 1860.

Between 1872 and its closure in 1913, the associated Bösendorfer-Saal was one of the premier concert halls of Vienna.

In 1909, Carl Hutterstrasser purchased the company and was succeeded by his sons Alexander and Wolfgang in 1931.

In 1966, the Jasper Corporation (later renamed Kimball International), parent company of Kimball Pianos, assumed control of Bösendorfer.

In 2001 Bösendorfer returned to Austrian hands, when the BAWAG PSK Gruppe purchased it.

On 21 December 2007 BAWAG signed an agreement to sell 100% of Bösendorfer to Yamaha Corporation.

Bösendorfer continues to make handcrafted pianos in the same Vienna factory. Almost 300 of these premium pianos are made each year.

== Characteristics ==
Bösendorfer pioneered the extension of the typical 88-key keyboard, creating the Imperial Grand (Model 290), which has 97 keys (eight octaves). Ferruccio Busoni initially ordered this innovation in 1909 as part of a custom piano, as he wanted to transcribe an organ piece that extended to the C below the standard keyboard. This innovation worked so well that this piano was added to regular product offerings and quickly became one of the world&#x27;s most sought-after concert grands. Because of the 290&#x27;s success, the extra strings were added to Bösendorfer&#x27;s other line of instruments such as the 225 model, which has 92 keys. The extra keys, at the bass end of the keyboard, were originally hidden beneath a hinged panel mounted between the piano&#x27;s conventional low A and the left-hand end-cheek to prevent their being struck accidentally during normal play; more recent models have omitted this device and simply have the upper surface of the extra natural keys finished in matte black instead of white to differentiate them from the standard 88.
The rim of a Bösendorfer grand piano is built quite differently from that of all other grands. Instead of veneers bent around a form, the rim is made in solid sections of spruce and jointed together. Spruce is better at transmitting sound than reflecting it. This is perhaps why Bösendorfers tend to have a more delicate treble and a bass that features the fundamental tone more than the higher harmonics. There are also two other features of Bösendorfers that are shared with only a few other piano brands: one is a removable &quot;capo d&#x27;astro&quot; bar in the treble, which facilitates rebuilding of the instrument and, Bösendorfer says, provides greater acoustic separation from the plate, decreasing tonal absorption; the other is single-stringing, providing each string its own individual hitch pin on the plate instead of connecting it to a neighbouring string. This design may slightly improve tuning stability and is an advantage in case of string breakage.

The latest development in the Bösendorfer range is the CEUS digital grand piano reproducing system, which incorporates a computer-controlled mechanism that records a performance on a digital storage medium (magnetic disk or memory chips) and plays it back. The requisite equipment can be fitted to most Bösendorfer pianos to allow the direct recording of pieces while capturing all the keyboard velocity data as a .boe file. Bösendorfer uses a proprietary format to record key and pedal movements as a digital file.

==Models==

Bösendorfer makes eight models of grand piano from 155 cm to 290 cm in length (5&#x27;1&quot; to 9&#x27;6&quot;) and two vertical pianos,120 cm and 130 cm in height (47&quot; and 51&quot;). The Imperial Grand is one of the world&#x27;s largest pianos.
Each numerical Bösendorfer model directly corresponds to its length in centimeters. For example, a Model 170 is 170 centimeters long (approximately 5&#x27;7&quot;). The following tables describes the current Bösendorfer models:

=== Grand pianos ===
Current Grand Piano Models
=== Upright pianos ===
Current Upright Piano Models
===Conservatory Series===
To appeal to a wider market, Bösendorfer designed the Conservatory Series for colleges and universities that could not afford Bösendorfer&#x27;s standard black-model pianos. The production of the two CS Series pianos spends less time in &quot;non-critical areas&quot;, cutting down costs of production and purchase, making them more affordable than standard models. The cases and frames are of satin finish, rather than polished and, initially, the pianos were loop-strung rather than single-strung, but those practices have since been abandoned.

===Special and Limited editions===
Bösendorfer has produced a number of specially designed pianos named after famous composers such as Franz Schubert, Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, as well as pianos designed for special occasions, such as Bösendorfer&#x27;s 170th and 175th anniversaries.

====SE reproducing piano====
Under the ownership of Kimball, Bösendorfer built and sold a small number of Stahnke Edition automatic reproducing pianos based on 3 of the &#x27;Imperial Line&#x27; models 225, 275 and 290. The &#x27;SE&#x27; designation was for Stahnke Engineering, whose founder, Wayne Stahnke, invented the mechanism. These instruments were fitted with sensors, electronics and mechanical systems to record and play back piano performances extremely accurately through electro-mechanical actuation of the piano keys and pedals. These instruments were designed to work with either performances stored on cassette tapes as digital data, or with an attached MS-DOS IBM PC computer. Using the computer, the SE instruments could be used for recording, editing and playback. The SE system instruments were the first commercially available computer-controlled &quot;player piano&quot; capable of accurately reproducing both the notes and intensity of a performer&#x27;s playing. This system was not further developed or patented due to its high cost. Competitors soon introduced patented reproducing piano technologies such as the Yamaha Disklavier in 1982.

The Bösendorfer SE instruments were used in a number of well-regarded commercially available audio recordings published on CD, where the performance was recorded on the SE system, but the piano was recorded playing back the performance later in a studio or hall, sometimes on a different instrument. Other audio recordings were produced using converted piano roll recordings from the early 20th century, including a two-disc series entitled &#x27;A Window in Time&#x27; featuring performances by Rachmaninoff and produced by Wayne Stahnke. 

Thirty-two SE pianos were produced by Bösendorfer between 1984 and 1987, including the 225SE, the 275SE, and the 290SE Imperial model pianos. In the 290 range, this included some 290 to 290SE conversions. One third of the production were 290SE models. Most of these instruments are still in use as of 2024.

The research that went into the SE reproducing system later laid the foundation for the CEUS computerized reproducing piano system, though much of the resulting design was completely different.

===Designer models===
Bösendorfer produces a limited number of Artisan Models annually, each available for order only during the calendar year in which it was developed. An example of a designer model is the Bösendorfer Swarovski Crystal Grand piano. Three of these special pianos were produced in 2003 in honour of Bösendorfer&#x27;s 175th anniversary. Each piano&#x27;s case is encrusted with 8000 crystals and layers of gold.

Three notable architects who have designed Bösendorfer piano models are Theophil Freiherr von Hansen (1866), Josef Hoffmann (1909) and Hans Hollein (1990). There were only two Hans Hollein 225 models produced in 1990; one can be found in the lounge of the Grand Bohemian Hotel in Orlando, Florida.

==Bösendorfer artists==

Among the earliest artists to be associated with Bösendorfer was Franz Liszt, who at least once opined that Bösendorfer and Bechstein pianos were the only instruments capable of withstanding his tremendously powerful playing. The renowned twentieth-century American composer–conductor Leonard Bernstein has also performed on a Bösendorfer. Another great pianist who championed Bösendorfer pianos was Wilhelm Backhaus.

In his memoirs, Arthur Rubinstein recounts having insisted on a Bechstein instead of the hall&#x27;s Bösendorfer before a recital in Austria. After the performance, the then-head of the Bösendorfer company came backstage to meet this young artist who refused to play a piano highly cherished by his Russian namesake, Anton Rubinstein; Rubinstein claims he thereafter always sought out Bösendorfers when in Austria.

In the late 1970s, following a concert performed in Vienna, jazz pianist Oscar Peterson turned to his impresario, Norman Granz, with the words: &quot;Dammit, Norman, where does this box go? I also gotta have such a thing!&quot; Such was his reaction to playing a Bösendorfer 290. Musician/comedian Victor Borge also played Bösendorfer pianos.

More recent examples of notable artists who have played the Bösendorfer include Russian pianist Sviatoslav Richter claiming it had a preferable pianissimo sound and control, according to his own interview); Hungarian pianist András Schiff; Austrian pianist Alfred Brendel; Italian pianist Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli; American free jazz pianist Cecil Taylor and American singer-songwriter Tori Amos; German pianist Wolfgang Rübsam; Austrian pianists Friedrich Gulda, Walter Klien and Paul Badura-Skoda; British pianists Leon McCawley and Mark Gasser.

Minimalist composer Charlemagne Palestine chose a nine-foot Bösendorfer as the vehicle on which to perform his 1974 composition &quot;Strumming Music&quot;. Released as his first compact disc in 1991, it features in excess of 45 minutes of Palestine forcefully playing two notes in rapid alternation, slowly expanding into clusters, with the sustain pedal depressed throughout.

Jazz pianist Keith Jarrett performed the solo improvisations (his Köln Concert) at the Cologne Opera House in Cologne, Germany, on 24 January 1975 on a Bösendorfer and became a Steinway &amp; Sons artist in 1981.

<text>The 33rd Street station is a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Park Avenue and 33rd Street in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan, it is served by trains at all times, &lt;6&gt; trains during weekdays in the peak direction, and trains during late night hours.

The 33rd Street station was constructed for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as part of the city&#x27;s first subway line, which was approved in 1900. Construction of the line segment that includes the 33rd Street station started on September 12 of the same year. The station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway. After the city&#x27;s first subway line was split into multiple lines in 1918, there was a failed proposal in the 1920s to convert 33rd Street into an express station. The station&#x27;s platforms were lengthened in the late 1940s.

The 33rd Street station contains two side platforms and four tracks; express trains use the inner two tracks to bypass the station. The station was built with tile and mosaic decorations, which are continued along the platform extensions. The platforms contain exits to 32nd Street to the south and 33rd Street to the north. The platforms are not connected to each other within fare control. The original station interior is a New York City designated landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==

=== Construction and opening ===

Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. However, development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. It called for a subway line from New York City Hall in lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side, where two branches would lead north into the Bronx. A plan was formally adopted in 1897, and all legal conflicts concerning the route alignment were resolved near the end of 1899. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

The 33rd Street station was constructed as part of the route segment from Great Jones Street to 41st Street. Construction on this section of the line began on September 12, 1900. The section from Great Jones Street to a point 100 feet (30 m) north of 33rd Street was awarded to Holbrook, Cabot &amp; Daly Contracting Company, while the remaining section to 41st Street was done by Ira A. Shaler. The section between 33rd and 41st Streets was built as two double-track tunnels. To accommodate a never-built connection to the mainline platforms at Grand Central Terminal, the tunnel carrying northbound trains was shifted eastward (nearly touching the eastern curb line of Park Avenue). At the time, the railroads that operated the terminal had not agreed to the connection. Property owners did not learn about the change until a series of accidents occurred along the excavation site in 1902. A dynamite explosion near Park Avenue and 41st Street on January 27, 1902, killed five people, and several mansions on Park Avenue fell into the excavation site that March due to rockslides. Shaler became known by the pejorative nickname of &quot;hoodoo contractor&quot; as a result. After Shaler was killed by a rockslide in his own excavation site on June 17, 1902, his estate completed the construction of the tunnel between 33rd and 41st Street.

By late 1903, the subway was nearly complete, but the IRT Powerhouse and the system&#x27;s electrical substations were still under construction, delaying the system&#x27;s opening. The 33rd Street station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. Litigation over the IRT&#x27;s Murray Hill tunnels continued for several years; in 1905, a judge found that the city government was responsible for the January 1902 explosion. In spite of this, the northbound tunnel was never relocated, as it had already been completed.

=== Service changes and station renovations ===

After the first subway line was completed in 1908, the station was served by local trains along both the West Side (now the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street) and East Side (now the Lenox Avenue Line). West Side local trains had their southern terminus at City Hall during rush hours and South Ferry at other times, and had their northern terminus at 242nd Street. East Side local trains ran from City Hall to Lenox Avenue (145th Street).

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. Both platforms at the 33rd Street station was extended to the south. New &quot;electric manholes&quot;, passageways leading to the equipment closets, were built at the southern ends of the platforms. Six-car local trains began operating in October 1910. The Lexington Avenue Line opened north of Grand Central–42nd Street in 1918, and the original line was divided into an H-shaped system. All local trains were sent via the Lexington Avenue Line, running along the Pelham Line in the Bronx.

In December 1922, the Transit Commission approved a proposal to convert the 33rd Street station into an express stop. It was estimated that the extra time spent by express trains at 33rd Street would be offset by the reduced dwell times at Grand Central. Local business owners supported the proposal, but the IRT opposed the plan, which would cost the company $750,000. In October 1923, the plan was postponed for a year due to a lack of funds. The Fifth Avenue Association requested in January 1924 that the Transit Commission again consider converting the 33rd Street station into an express stop, citing the fact that a 35-story structure was to be built immediately adjacent to the station. The express-stop proposal was postponed indefinitely in 1925. The Fifth Avenue Association requested in 1929 that the express-station proposal be reconsidered. The association said the conversion would &quot;complete a quadrilateral of express stops&quot; that included 34th Street–Penn Station, Times Square–42nd Street, and Grand Central–42nd Street.

In 1928, to alleviate overcrowding on the Lexington Avenue Line, a consulting engineer for the New York State Transit Commission proposed the construction of &quot;reservoir&quot; stations at 33rd/34th and 42nd Streets. The proposal entailed constructing a northbound-only tunnel under Lexington Avenue from 30th to 42nd Street, with stations at 34th and 42nd Streets, then converting the IRT tunnel under Park Avenue and the existing 33rd and 42nd Street stations to southbound-only use. The northbound and southbound stations at 33rd/34th and 42nd Streets would both have had two express tracks and one local track; the express tracks in either direction would have merged with each other north of 42nd Street and south of 30th Street. Although the &quot;reservoir&quot; plan was technically feasible, the $25 million projected cost was too high.

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. In January 1947, the New York City Board of Transportation awarded a $4.003 million contract for the lengthening of platforms at the , , and 33rd Street stations. The platform extensions at all three stations opened on April 13, 1948, after which they could accommodate ten-car trains. On December 27, 1948, a new entrance to the station at 32nd Street opened for use.

In 1979, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the space within the boundaries of the original station, excluding expansions made after 1904, as a city landmark. The station was designated along with eleven others on the original IRT. The original interiors were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

== Station layout ==

Like other local stations, 33rd Street has four tracks and two side platforms. The 6 stops here at all times, rush-hour and midday &lt;6&gt; trains stop here in the peak direction; and the 4 stops here during late nights. The two express tracks are used by the 4 and 5 trains during daytime hours. The station is between to the north and to the south. The platforms were originally long, like at other local stations on the original IRT, but later became long. The platform extensions are at the southern ends of the original platforms. The express tracks stay level, while the local tracks slowly incline from south to north to allow for the easier deceleration of local trains. This results in a layout where the express tracks are at a lower elevation than the local tracks in the northern half of the station.

North of the station, the two pairs of tracks in each direction separate into different tunnels because of the presence of the Murray Hill Tunnel, which runs under the center of this section of Park Avenue. As built, the tunnels were supposed to have been apart, but the northbound tunnel (to the east) was shifted eastward by another to accommodate a three-track connection from the original IRT subway north to the mainline Grand Central Terminal. There is a drainage pipe connecting the two tunnels between 37th and 38th Streets, as well as a cross-passage between 38th and 39th Streets.

===Design===

As with other stations built as part of the original IRT, the station was constructed using a cut-and-cover method. The tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The bottom of this trough contains a foundation of concrete no less than thick. Each platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The original platforms contain I-beam columns spaced every , while the platform extensions contain columns with white glazed tiles. Additional columns between the tracks, spaced every , support the jack-arched concrete station roofs. The ceiling height varies, being about above platform level near the northern fare control areas, and lower in other portions of the station. There is a gap between the trough wall and the platform walls, which are made of -thick brick covered over by a tiled finish.

The fare control areas are at platform level, and there is no crossover or crossunder between the platforms. The walls along the platforms near the fare control areas consist of a brick wainscoting on the lowest part of the wall, with bronze air vents along the wainscoting, and white glass tiles above. The platform walls are divided at intervals by buff and green mosaic tile pilasters, or vertical bands. In the original portion of the station, each pilaster is topped by green faience plaques depicting eagles, an allusion to the former 71st Regiment Armory at Park Avenue and 33rd Street; the eagles hold blue and white shields containing the number &quot;33&quot;. A cornice with yellow and brown vine and fretwork patterns runs atop these walls. The platform extensions contain tiles with the number &quot;33&quot; atop the pilasters. Mosaic plaques with the words &quot;33rd St.&quot; are also spaced at various intervals on the walls. The mosaic tiles at all original IRT stations were manufactured by the American Encaustic Tile Company, which subcontracted the installations at each station. The decorative work was performed by tile contractor John H. Parry and faience contractor Grueby Faience Company. The ceilings of the northern fare control areas contain plaster molding.

The 1997 artwork at this station is &quot;Lariat Seat Loops&quot; by James Garvey. These are composed of fourteen bronze loops surrounding the I-beam columns near the northern fare control areas, which are designed as handholds or seat rests. According to Garvey, &quot;the thick bronze bar ... resembles the lasso demonstration in a Will Rogers film clip&quot;. Garvey subsequently designed &quot;Lariat Tapers&quot;, a similar artwork at the Wall Street station, in 2011.

===Exits===

Each platform has exits to both 32nd and 33rd Streets. The northbound platform&#x27;s exits are on the eastern side of Park Avenue while the southbound platform&#x27;s exits are on the western side. The street staircases contain relatively simple, modern steel railings like those seen at most New York City Subway stations.

At 33rd Street, each control area contains two exits, one each to the north and south sides of 33rd Street. These exits are directly outside 4 Park Avenue to the northwest, 2 Park Avenue to the southwest, 3 Park Avenue to the northeast, and 1 Park Avenue to the southeast. At 32nd Street, each control area contains two exits to the south side of that street.

<text>Avicularia is a genus of the family Theraphosidae containing various species of arboreal tarantulas. The genus is native to Panama, the Caribbean, and tropical South America. Each species in the genus has very distinguishable pink foot pads.

Species belonging to this genus are amongst the relatively small exception of tarantulas that can jump moderate distances as juveniles, with most tarantulas being limited to lunges of 3-4 centimeters.

Urticating hairs are distinct to new world tarantulas including the &quot;Avicularia&quot; that are attached to the spider&#x27;s cuticle &quot;via&quot; a stalk. These spiny, barbed hairs are used as a defense against potential intruders as well as embedded into silk to protect the egg sac. In active defense, the hairs are released by contact with the stimulus and rubbed in.

At least three species of &quot;Avicularia&quot; are threatened by habitat loss and illegal trafficking, due to their popularity as exotic pets. &quot;Avicularia avicularia&quot; are among the tarantulas most commonly kept as pets for their &quot;stunning&quot; color and size.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Avicularia&quot; was erected in 1818 by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck for species previously placed in &quot;Mygale&quot; , the genus name used at the time for most mygalomorph spiders. One of the species Lamarck included in his new genus was &quot;Avicularia canceridea&quot;, which included &quot;Aranea avicularia&quot;, first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Araneologists continued to use the name &quot;Mygale&quot;, although this had been used for genus of mammals in 1800, so was not available for Latreille to use for spiders. Ausserer in 1871 used &quot;Avicularia&quot;, but a degree of confusion persisted until a decision of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 1928 established the correctness of &quot;Avicularia&quot;, with the type species being Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;Aranea avicularia&quot; in the combination &quot;Avicularia avicularia&quot;.

Linnaeus&#x27; name &quot;Avicularia&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;avicula&quot;, meaning &quot;little bird&quot;, with the suffix &quot;-aria,&quot; which is the Latin female singular form of &quot;-arius,&quot; meaning &quot;pertaining to.&quot; This refers to a 1705 illustration by 
Maria Sibylla Merian, showing a tarantula that appears to be of this genus feeding on a bird. The English names &quot;bird spider&quot; and &quot;bird-eating spider,&quot; and the German name for tarantula, &quot;Vogelspinne&quot; (a compound noun literally meaning &quot;bird&quot; [vogel] &quot;spider&quot; [spinne]) reflect this Latin name. Ironically, the term &quot;bird-eater&quot; is more typically applied to the common names of large terrestrial species of tarantulas, such as the Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), the burgundy Goliath bird eater (Theraphosa stirmi), and the Brazilian salmon pink bird-eating tarantula (Lasiodora parahybana).

A major review of the genus drastically reduced the number of species recognized, from over 50 to 12, . Some species have been transferred to other genera, with others reduced to synonymy. Yet more names are considered to be doubtful in their application (&quot;nomina dubia&quot;).

<text>Northborough is a small village and civil parish in the Peterborough district, in the ceremonial county of Cambridgeshire, England.
It has a pub, a shop, a school and a small castle. Northborough is around eight miles north of the city of Peterborough and one mile south of village of Deeping Gate and the Lincolnshire border.

The place-name &quot;Northborough&quot; is first attested in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for the year 656, where it appears as &quot;Northburh&quot;. In an Assize Roll of 1202 it appears as &quot;Norburg&quot;. The name means &#x27;northern &quot;burg&quot; or fortified settlement&#x27;.

Northborough Manor House is a fortified manor house, largely built by Roger de Norburgh in the early fourteenth century. A short way away is the parish church of St Andrew, of which the original Norman sections date back to the late twelfth century. After the restoration of the monarchy Elizabeth Cromwell, widow of Oliver, lived with John Claypole (her son in law) and is said to be buried in this church. However, there is no grave-stone or marker to be seen.

The village underwent its largest change in the 1970s, when it expanded hugely with the building of the new estate, increasing the population of the village.

Northborough also has a small primary school, which also takes children from other neighbouring villages, such as Maxey and Peakirk. Until relatively recently, the school was housed in the School House, almost opposite the manor along the Lincoln Road. Then, as the village grew, it moved to a new, larger and better equipped site. The school benefits from a large field and adjoining orchard.

<text>Shamrock Rovers Football Club () is an Irish professional football club based in Tallaght, South Dublin. The club&#x27;s senior team competes in the League of Ireland Premier Division and it is the most successful club in the Republic of Ireland. The club has won the League of Ireland title a record 21 times and the FAI Cup a record 25 times. Shamrock Rovers have supplied more players to the Republic of Ireland national football team (64) than any other club. In All-Ireland competitions, such as the Intercity Cup, they hold the record for winning the most titles, having won seven cups overall.

Shamrock Rovers were founded in Ringsend, Dublin. The official date of the club&#x27;s foundation is 1899. They won the League title at the first attempt in the 1922–23 season and established themselves as Republic of Ireland most successful club by 1949, winning 44 major trophies. During the 1950s, the club won three League titles and two FAI Cups and became the first Irish team to compete in European competition, playing in the European Cup in 1957.

They followed this by winning a record six FAI Cups in succession in the 1960s, when they were also one of the European club teams that spent the summer of 1967 in the United States, founding the United Soccer Association. They won the first of four League titles in a row in 1983–84, after a long decline.

The club played at Glenmalure Park from 1926 to 1987 when the owners controversially sold the stadium to property developers. Shamrock Rovers spent the next 22 years playing home games at various venues around Dublin and on occasions, Ireland. They moved into Tallaght Stadium prior to the start of the 2009 season after years of delays and legal disputes, during which time the club&#x27;s supporters saved them from extinction.

Shamrock Rovers wore green and white striped jerseys until 1926 when they adopted the green and white hooped strip that they have worn ever since. Their club badge has featured a football and a shamrock throughout their history. The club has a relatively large support base and shares an intense rivalry with Bohemian Football Club and St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic. On 25 August 2011, Rovers became the first Irish side to reach the group stages of either of the top two European competitions by beating Partizan Belgrade in the play-off round of the Europa League. During the 2024–25 season, Shamrock Rovers became the first Irish side to qualify for the knockout stages of a European tournament as they advanced past the group phase of the UEFA Conference League.

==History==
===Foundation and early history===
The foundation of Shamrock Rovers is disputed amongst supporters of the club. No official documentation of the era exists. For many years the earliest known mention of the club in the newspaper archives at the National Library of Ireland came from 1901, and an article in the club programme from 28 December 1941 claims that the club was founded in 1901. Research by the Shamrock Rovers Heritage Trust uncovered a very brief report in the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; from April 1899 on a match between Shamrock Rovers and Rosemount, which has established that the club was in existence from at least that time. The only two certainties about the origins of the club in relation to what year they were formed are the facts that, Rovers played only exhibition games for the first two years of their existence and the club registered with the Leinster Football Association in 1901. Essentially, the dispute is over whether the two years of exhibition games were played before or after the registration. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the date 1899 was written on the gates of Glenmalure Park but, since the 1990s, 1901 had been adopted as the founding year by the various regimes which have run the club. In light of the discovery of evidence supporting a founding date before April 1899 the club opened an &quot;1899 Suite&quot; in Tallaght Stadium in February 2017.

Shamrock Rovers originate from Ringsend, a Southside inner suburb of Dublin.
The name of the club derives from Shamrock Avenue in Ringsend, where the first club rooms were secured. In September 1906, after a few seasons in operation, Rovers withdrew from the First Division of the Leinster Senior League. In 1914, they were resurrected and started playing their matches at Ringsend Park. On 17 April 1915, the side won the Irish Junior Cup, which was then the top junior competition organised on an all-Ireland basis. They defeated Derry Celtic Swifts 1–0 in the final, played in Dublin. However, Ringsend park became unavailable within two years. The club disbanded and played only exhibition games for the next five years. In 1921, Shamrock Rovers were resurrected once more, as a Leinster Senior League outfit, and reached the final of the inaugural FAI Cup, where they lost to St James&#x27;s Gate in a fixture marred by crowd violence. The following season, the club won the League of Ireland title at the first attempt, going 21 games unbeaten and scoring 77 goals. In 1924, an influential member of the League winning side of two years earlier, Bob Fullam, returned to Rovers from Leeds United and combined with John Flood, John Fagan and Billy Farrell to complete the forward line known as &quot;The Four Fs&quot;. By the conclusion of their fifth season in the League of Ireland, the club had won three League titles and one FAI Cup. During the 1930s, the club won a further three League titles and five FAI Cups with Irish internationals, Paddy Moore and Jimmy Dunne playing key roles in their success, supported by crowds of up to 30,000 people at Glenmalure Park. By 1949, Shamrock Rovers had established themselves as Ireland&#x27;s most successful football club. Their 44 major trophies included six League of Ireland titles, 11 FAI Cups, seven League of Ireland Shields, six Leinster Senior Cups, two Dublin City Cups, four Intercity Cups and eight President&#x27;s Cups.

===Coad&#x27;s Colts===
In November 1949, following the death of Jimmy Dunne, Paddy Coad accepted the position of player-manager having played with the club for almost eight years, in which time he had established himself as one of the best players in the League of Ireland. Coad opted for a radical youth policy and over the course of his first three years in charge, signed virtually the entire schoolboy international side to Rovers. He employed revolutionary training methods with extra emphasis on technical skill and possession which resulted in a fast, passing style of football that contributed significantly to the development of the game in Ireland. In 1954, the club won the League of Ireland for the first time in fifteen years, while Paddy Ambrose finished the season as the team&#x27;s leading scorer. Led by players like Liam Tuohy and Coad himself, the team known as &quot;Coad&#x27;s Colts&quot; proceeded to win two more league titles and two FAI Cups, concluding the &quot;golden era&quot; of Irish football as one of its most successful teams.

===Six in a row===
After the departure of Coad in 1960 and an unsuccessful season under Albie Murphy, Seán Thomas took on the role of rebuilding the Rovers team which had suffered from the break-up of Coad&#x27;s Colts. Paddy Ambrose and Ronnie Nolan had remained with the club and were joined by a large selection of signings including Irish internationals, Frank O&#x27;Neill and Johnny Fullam. The decision by Liam Tuohy to return to the club as captain, after four successful years at Newcastle United, effectively saw the completion of Thomas&#x27; side. The club won every domestic honour except the Top Four Competition in the 1963–64 season and were narrowly defeated by holders and eventual finalists, Valencia, in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Thomas, however, quit the Hoops at the end of the season following a dispute with the Cunninghams (Owners) over team selection. Liam Tuohy took over as player-manager and led the club to a further five FAI Cups in succession, completing a series of six, including a 3–0 defeat of League of Ireland champions, Waterford in 1968, in front of 40,000 people at Dalymount Park. The summer of 1967 had been spent in the United States, participating in the foundation of the United Soccer Association, where Rovers represented Boston as Boston Rovers. The 1968–69 season saw Mick Leech score a total of 56 goals for the club, including two in the last FAI Cup final of the &quot;Six in a Row&quot; period, against Cork Celtic.

===Decline===
The Hoops&#x27; defeat to Shelbourne in the first round of the FAI Cup in 1970, their first defeat in 32 Cup games over seven years, marked the start of the decline in the fortunes of the club. Despite only narrowly missing out on the League title in the 1970–71 season in controversial circumstances, the next twelve years proved to be a disaster for the club both on and off the field. On 25 April 1971, Rovers met Cork Hibs in Dalymount in a League play-off watched by 28,000 people. Their pre-match buildup was thrown into disarray when players and directors clashed over win bonuses. Hibs won the play-off 3–1. The next season, the Cunninghams, now under the control of sons Arthur and Des, sold the club to three brothers from Dublin; Paddy, Barton and Louis Kilcoyne. The Kilcoynes had witnessed decades of huge attendances at Irish football games and sought to take over the club primarily for business reasons. However, within the space of five years, the large crowds disappeared from Irish football stadia and combined with the demise of Drumcondra and Cork Hibs, the decline in fortunes of a number of top clubs and the lack of action by the FAI, the League of Ireland was plunged into a drastic decline.
Faced with dwindling attendances, the Kilcoynes decided to starve the club and sold off senior players who were replaced by junior footballers. On a tour of Japan in 1975, Mick Meagan and Theo Dunne&#x27;s young side defeated the Japanese national team 3–2 in front of 60,000 spectators at the Olympic Stadium, but that victory was the highlight of a season that saw the team finish bottom of the table and re-apply for admission into the League of Ireland.

In 1976, Meagan and Dunne resigned from the club and were replaced by Seán Thomas, the architect of the &quot;Six in a Row&quot; side, who with limited resources, re-signed Johnny Fullam and Mick Leech, as well as John Conway from Bohemians. Rovers finished the 1976–77 season in eleventh but won the club&#x27;s only League of Ireland Cup, with Leech&#x27;s 250th career goal proving the difference against Sligo. In July 1977, Irish international player-manager John Giles returned to Dublin to take up the same role at Rovers. The Kilcoynes implemented a full-time policy and unveiled plans to rebuild Glenmalure Park as a 50,000 all-seater stadium as well as turning the club into a school of excellence for Irish football, capable of challenging for European honours. Giles signed Irish internationals, Ray Treacy, Eamon Dunphy and Paddy Mulligan to complement the youth setup. In his first season in charge, the club won their 21st FAI Cup, defeating Sligo in a controversial final, but despite that success and emphatic victories in European competition against Apoel Nicosia and Fram Reykjavík, Giles&#x27; conservative approach based on possession football proved unsuccessful and on 3 February 1983, he resigned.

===Four in a row===
In the summer of 1983, Jim McLaughlin replaced Noel Campbell as Rovers&#x27; manager, after a successful period at Dundalk. Louis Kilcoyne made money available to McLaughlin who responded by selling and releasing almost the entire squad he had inherited from the Giles era, including fans&#x27; favourite, Alan O&#x27;Neill, while retaining the services of Liam Buckley, Harry Kenny, Alan Campbell and Peter Eccles. He brought in what was effectively a League of Ireland XI which included Jody Byrne and Noel King from Dundalk, Mick Neville from Drogheda, the trio of Eviston, Brady and O&#x27;Brien from Bohemians, and Anto Whelan and Neville Steedman from Manchester United and Thurles Town .
On 1 April 1984, the club clinched their first League of Ireland title in 20 years with a 3–1 defeat of Shelbourne and 14 days later against Limerick at Glenmalure Park, midfielder and captain, Pat Byrne was presented with the trophy. Following that success, the club&#x27;s two star strikers, Campbell and Buckley, were transferred to Racing de Santander and K.S.V. Waregem. McLaughlin replaced them with Mick Byrne and Noel Larkin and the pairing proved successful as the club won a further three League titles and three FAI Cups, with Byrne finishing the final season of the &quot;Four in a Row&quot; period as the League&#x27;s top goalscorer. Dermot Keely managed and played for the club that year after McLaughlin&#x27;s decision to transfer to Derry City The Hoops won 74 League games out of 100 from August 1983 to April 1987, losing only 11.

===The homeless years (1987–2009)===

Shortly after winning their 14th League title, Louis Kilcoyne announced that the Kilcoynes were selling Glenmalure Park, which they had recently purchased from the Jesuits. The team played the entire 1987–88 season in an almost empty Tolka Park as a result of a boycott called for by the Shamrock Rovers Supporters Club and KRAM (Keep Rovers at Milltown), which was observed by the vast majority of Hoops fans. Following the completion of the boycott season in Tolka, the Kilcoynes sold the football club to Dublin businessman John McNamara, who put forward a controversial proposal to move in with Bohemians at Dalymount Park. KRAM congregated to vote on whether to lift the boycott and on the proposal to move to Dalymount. Both motions were passed and the club spent the next two seasons at the Phibsboro venue, with an unrecognisable side playing in front of small attendances.

As the 1989–90 season concluded, the club announced that they were moving to the RDS Arena in Ballsbridge, located halfway between Ringsend and Milltown on the Southside of Dublin. On 30 September 1990, the RDS played host to Shamrock Rovers against St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic, in front of approximately 25,000 people . The fixture started a six-year period at the venue that included a League title-winning season in 1993–94. Ray Treacy managed the League winning side which included Paul Osam, Gino Brazil, John Toal, Alan Byrne and Stephen Geoghegan, who ended the season as top goalscorer. The next season, a number of key players were released as Treacy and McNamara enforced a tight budget and opted to rebuild the side with young players. The team began the season with a heavy defeat to Górnik Zabrze in the UEFA Cup and struggled their way to a midtable standing. They started the 1995–96 season badly and by late that season, after almost two years of growing supporter discontent at the running of the club, Treacy resigned, with McNamara following him shortly afterwards. One of McNamara&#x27;s final acts was to appoint Alan O&#x27;Neill and Terry Eviston, who had both returned to the club in 1993, as joint managers of the side. They succeeded in removing the threat of relegation and almost guided the team to European qualification.

====Long road to Tallaght====
As the 1995–96 season concluded, John McNamara sold the club to Premier Computers, headed by Alan McGrath. McGrath unveiled a plan to build a state-of-the-art stadium in the Dublin southwest suburb of Tallaght, and employed Pat Byrne as commercial manager. However, after a couple of weeks and a loss in the first game of the season, O&#x27;Neill was dismissed, while Eviston resigned in solidarity. Byrne was appointed manager of the side playing in Tolka Park once again, and they struggled through the season with the League&#x27;s joint top scorer, Tony Cousins playing a leading role in avoiding relegation. In May 1997, Alan McGrath resigned as club chairman and was replaced by Brian Kearney, also of Premier Computers, who succeeded in acquiring planning permission for the new stadium in January 1998. However, the permission was delayed by objections until November 1998, by which time Joe Colwell had replaced Kearney as chairman and ended Premier Computers&#x27; involvement with the club. On the pitch, Mick Byrne guided Rovers to an Intertoto Cup spot in 1997–98 and an eighth-place finish, the next season. He was replaced by Damien Richardson, who managed the club during their stay at Morton Stadium before his dismissal in April 2002, after a disagreement with Colwell. By that time, a half-built shell of a stadium stood at the Tallaght site; Mulden International Ltd, recruited by Colwell to complete the project, had pulled out of building the stadium. They leased it to a separate company, transferring the responsibility, and focused on four acres that they had retained for themselves.

====Examinership and survival====

Tony Maguire replaced Colwell as chairman and began the search for potential investors. In his first season as manager, Liam Buckley guided the club to the FAI Cup final and European qualification, as the team played at Richmond Park. The 2003 season was marked by the club&#x27;s worsening finances as a deal with potential investor, Conor Clarkson was held up by Mulden&#x27;s reluctance to sell their land. Having successfully applied for a one-year planning extension in October 2003, the club applied for a further extension a few months after Buckley&#x27;s departure in September 2004. SDCC refused the application, but clarified their position by confirming their intention to build the stadium in partnership with the club, once the issue of ownership had been resolved. The trustees of the 400 Club (supporters group) informed the board of directors that they were no longer willing to bankroll their ownership of Shamrock Rovers.

Faced with the choice of remaining with Clarkson, whose plans were nullified by SDCC&#x27;s decision, or cooperating with the council, Maguire chose the former and with Mulden&#x27;s financing, initiated a High Court judicial review of the decision. The review failed and on 11 April 2005, facing debts of over two million Euro, the club entered into examinership. The 400 Club agreed to completely bankroll the club during the process. On 5 May 2005, Tony Maguire resigned on request by the FAI, who had discovered that the club had submitted their 2003 accounts in their application for a licence for the 2005 season. This resulted in a points deduction and subsequent relegation under Roddy Collins. The examinership concluded in July 2005 with the examiner accepting the 400 Club&#x27;s bid for Shamrock Rovers, saving the club from extinction, and the supporters-owned club won promotion at the first attempt in 2006 under Pat Scully. The 2007 and 2008 seasons at Tolka Park were ones of overachievement and stability, but the major event of the period was the recommencement of building on the stadium after more than two years of legal disputes between the council and Thomas Davis CLG.

===Tallaght===
The 2009 season proved to be a progressive one for the club, starting with the completion of the stadium and ending with a second-place finish and qualification to the Europa League under the management of Michael O&#x27;Neill. Tallaght Stadium hosted the highest attendances in the League of Ireland, regularly selling out its capacity. The season was also marked by the visit of Real Madrid to Tallaght Stadium, where they defeated The Hoops 1–0 in front of a record attendance of 10,900 people. The team entered the 2010–11 Europa League in the second qualifying round and defeated Bnei Yehuda of Israel to progress to a third qualifying round tie against Juventus. The Italian side won the tie 3–0 on aggregate. Shamrock Rovers finished the 2010 season as champions, ending a 16-year drought by narrowly beating Bohemians to the title on goal difference. Rovers also got to the FAI Cup final, the first in the Aviva Stadium, where, in front of a crowd of over 30,000, they were defeated on penalties by Sligo Rovers.

====2011 season====
In 2011 the club played its first-ever Champions League game and its first game in the highest level of European Cup Competition since the 1987–88 European Cup, beating Estonian Champions Flora Tallinn in the 2011–12 Champions League Second qualifying round. They accomplished this feat by triumphing 1–0 in the first leg at Tallaght Stadium and drawing 0–0 in the second leg in Estonia to advance 1–0 on aggregate. Rovers were then beaten 3–0 on aggregate in the next round by Danish Champions Copenhagen but advanced to the 2011–12 Europa League Play-off round. There they were drawn against Serbian Champions FK Partizan, whom they defeated 3–2 on aggregate (2–1 on the night after extra time) to reach the group stages of the Europa League.
This marked a famous victory for Irish football, as it was the first time an Irish club had reached the group stages of a major European competition. Rovers also won the All Ireland Setanta Sports Cup in 2011 by defeating Dundalk in the final at Tallaght Stadium. Rovers wrapped up a second league title in a row with a last-minute victory over UCD at Belfield on 25 October 2011.

===Bradley era===

The club suffered something of a lean spell after the highs of the 2011 season. Michael O&#x27;Neill departed to manage the Northern Ireland national team and was replaced by Stephen Kenny. However, Kenny was fired after less than a full season in 2012. His successor Trevor Croly&#x27;s tenure as manager was also shortlived. Despite winning two minor trophies, the League Cup and Setanta Cup in 2013, he was sacked halfway through the 2014 season. Pat Fenlon a former Rovers player was appointed the following season but he too failed to win major trophies. In 2016 he was replaced by Stephen Bradley, another former player, who at that time was coaching one of the club&#x27;s underage sides. It took some time for Bradley to rebuild a winning team to challenge the then-dominant Dundalk.

However, through developing young players and astute signings such as Jack Byrne, Rovers steadily improved under Bradley&#x27;s management. In 2019 Bradley&#x27;s team won the FAI Cup, defeating Dundalk after penalties in the final, before a crowd of over 33,000, the first time that Rovers had won the Cup since 1987. The following season, a campaign truncated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Rovers won a shortened league season unbeaten. In the Europa League qualifying rounds Rovers were narrowly beaten 2–0 by Italian giants AC Milan. Dundalk denied Bradley&#x27;s team a &#x27;double&#x27; however, beating them in the FAI Cup Final, which due to the pandemic, was played behind closed doors. In 2021, despite losing star players such as Jack Byrne and Aaron McEneff, before the start of the season, Shamrock Rovers retained the title, finishing sixteen points ahead of nearest rival St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic and picking up the trophy before a full house in Tallaght Stadium against Drogheda United. In 2022, Rovers won their third league title in a row, picking up the trophy in a 1–0 win against Derry City. The club also qualified for the group stages of the UEFA Conference League for the first time. Attendances also continued to improve, with an average of more than 6,000 fans attending home games in Tallaght stadium in 2022. In 2023 Shamrock Rovers again won the league title, equalling the record of four league championships in a row set by the club in the 1980s. However the team&#x27;s European performance was disappointing, losing convincingly on aggregate to Icelandic side Breidablik in the Champions League qualifiers and Hungarian champions Ferencváros in the Europa league. 

In 2024, by contrast, Rovers lost their league title, finishing second to Shelbourne, but had a lucrative run in Europe, again qualifying for the group stages of the UEFA Conference League, defeating Vikingur of Iceland and NK Celje of Slovenia. Rovers won three out of five games in the group stages, against Larne FC, The New Saints and FK Borac Banja Luka, drawing with Apoel Nicosia and Rapid Vienna and losing only to Chelsea FC. This meant that Rovers became the first Irish club to qualify for a European knock out stage, qualifying to a play off against Molde of Norway. 

==Colours and badge==

Until 1926, Shamrock Rovers wore green and white striped jerseys but following a suggestion by a committee member, John Sheridan, the club chose to adopt the green and white hooped strip. A close relationship existed between the club and Belfast Celtic and it was on account of this that the idea was formed. The first game featuring the new jerseys was against Bray Unknowns in a FAI Cup match on 9 January 1927 at Shelbourne Park. The Hoops lost the game 3–0 and senior members of the club considered abandoning the new strip. Despite this loss, the team continued to wear green and white hoops and have done ever since. The 2007 season was the first season since the hoops were introduced that they were not continuous around the main body of the jersey. The style of the shirt sleeves has been changed on numerous occasions. The away colours of the club have varied over time. In the early 1980s, the club had a yellow away jersey. In the mid-1990s, a hooped purple jersey was adopted. In 2011, the team wore an all-black away strip.

The club emblem features a football and a shamrock and has done so throughout the history of the club. Minor alterations to the club badge have included changing the style of the shamrock and the width of the diagonal lines. In 2005, a star was added above the badge to signify the first 10 League of Ireland titles won by the club. After the takeover of the club by the supporters, black became the club&#x27;s third official colour in recognition of the loss of Glenmalure Park. It was also decided that the number 12 would no longer be worn by any Shamrock Rovers player and instead would represent the club&#x27;s supporters.

==Stadiums==

===Glenmalure Park===

On 11 September 1926, Shamrock Rovers played their first game at Glenmalure Park, Milltown against Dundalk, having previously played at Ringsend Park, Shelbourne Park, Windy Arbour and a different pitch behind the famous Milltown one. The official opening took place on Sunday, 19 September 1926 as Belfast Celtic provided the opposition in an exhibition game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goggins/Doolan 1993&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When the Cunninghams acquired the club in the 1930s, the stadium was named Glenmalure Park in honour of their ancestral home in Glenmalure. They completed the stadium with the addition of terraces, one of which was covered. The stadium remained essentially unaltered from then until its demolition in 1990, excluding the destruction of a small terrace and the erection of floodlights in the 1980s. Its capacity was approximately 20,000 for most of its existence, its largest recorded attendance being 28,000, set against Waterford in 1968. Larger, unreported, attendances were present at the venue before then.

In 1987, the Kilcoynes decided to sell the stadium to property developers, having recently purchased it from the Jesuits. The last game at Glenmalure Park was an FAI Cup semi-final between Shamrock Rovers and Sligo Rovers on 12 April 1987. The game saw a pitch invasion by supporters protesting against the sale of the stadium. The next season, the supporters formed an association called &quot;Keep Rovers at Milltown&quot; and placed a picket on home games at Tolka Park, effectively bankrupting the club&#x27;s owners. They accumulated funds, through supporter contributions, in an effort to purchase the stadium but failed to match the offer of a property developer to whom the Kilcoynes eventually sold the site. After a lengthy appeals process, Glenmalure Park was demolished in 1990 to be replaced by an apartment complex.

===Tallaght Stadium===

In the 1990s, Shamrock Rovers were granted land in the Dublin suburb of Tallaght to build a new stadium. On 30 March 2000, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern turned the sod at the site. However, work on the stadium ceased in 2001 and in March 2005, South Dublin County Council announced that they were taking back the land that they had granted to the club, as the conditions of the planning permission had not been met. A public consultation process was initiated in July 2005 and a resolution was passed in December 2005 to alter the stadium to accommodate senior GAA games while still having Shamrock Rovers as the preferred tenants. This decision was subject to additional government funding. This funding was not made available and on 13 January 2006 the council voted to proceed with the original plan.

This second vote was challenged by a local Gaelic Athletic Association club, Thomas Davis who wanted the vote on 13 January 2006 declared illegal thus forcing the county council to build the GAA stadium. &quot;Thomas Davis&quot; claimed that the capacity of the stadium (initially 6,000, ultimately 10,000) would not be affected by the change, the other parties involved disputed this and argued that the capacity would be reduced. Requests under the freedom of information act to both South Dublin County Council and the Department of Sport showed that &quot;Thomas Davis&quot; had not submitted any plans showing that capacity would not be affected.

Thomas Davis GAA club instituted judicial review proceedings in the High Court in May 2006. Their main argument was that the decision of the council on 13 February 2006 to revert to the original plans for the stadium, which did not include a senior GAA pitch, was unlawful. Their submission on the technical point was accompanied by cultural arguments that &#x27;the youth of Tallaght will be restricted to a diet of Association football&#x27; and that a soccer-only ground would place the &#x27;applicant at a severe disadvantage in attracting the youth of Tallaght to the club, the sport and the GAA culture. The stadium, however, with the original design, could accommodate youth GAA games as the pitch used at this level fits within the stadium&#x27;s dimensions. It was only adult GAA games that would not have been facilitated.

The then Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, John O&#x27;Donoghue, consistently supported the government&#x27;s decision to support the stadium with soccer pitch dimensions, and claimed that the GAA were stalling the project which he believed they had no need for on top of their own site in Rathcoole. On 14 December 2006 the Football Association of Ireland pledged financial assistance for the Hoops&#x27; High Court battle involving &quot;Thomas Davis&quot;.

The judicial review began on 20 April 2007 and concluded on 14 December 2007. In the High Court decision Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy found in favour of South Dublin Co. Council and Shamrock Rovers. South Dublin County Council were correct in their 13 February 2006 vote to proceed with the stadium as originally planned. An application by &quot;Thomas Davis&quot; for leave to appeal this decision to the Supreme court was refused by Judge Murphy on 25 January 2008. Building commenced on the stadium on 6 May 2008. Shamrock Rovers played their first &#x27;home&#x27; game in over 20 years in the stadium in March 2009.

==Ownership==
Shamrock Rovers F.C. is partially owned (25%) by the Shamrock Rovers Members Club, with businessman Ray Wilson owning 50% of the club since 2016, a further 25% is owned by businessman Dermot Desmond, who purchased the stake in 2019. The Shamrock Rovers Members Club was originally formed as the 400 Club in November 2002, by the then privately owned football club&#x27;s board of directors, to raise funds through the fan base, with the sole purpose of facilitating a mortgage for the development of the stalled stadium project in Tallaght. The monthly membership fee was set at €40. However, it became apparent to the members that the funds raised were being used for purposes outside of the stated objective. As a result, the membership took control of the 400 Club, adopted a transparent structure and constitution, and declared itself totally independent of the then board of Shamrock Rovers. The 400 Club consortium played a crucial role in the survival of Shamrock Rovers when the club entered examinership in April 2005. They paid off a portion of the club&#x27;s debts and assumed responsibility for running it. After the successful acquisition of the club through the examinership process, the 400 Club Trustees became the Board of Directors of Shamrock Rovers Football Club and began the process of building a sustainable club through sensible business practices. Numerous clubs and supporters groups subsequently sought their advice with regard to using the model of the 400 club elsewhere. At the annual meeting of the 400 Club in 2006, the members voted to rename it as the SRFC Members Club, reflecting the reality of their ownership of the football club. At the 2008 meeting, the monthly membership fee was increased to €50. In January 2012, there were more than 400 members of the club. Membership is open to all.

==Supporters and rivalries==

The majority of Shamrock Rovers supporters originate from the Southside of Dublin, but the club attracts fans from across the city and country. Since its foundation, the club has maintained a proud Irish identity, and their supporters reflect this in the flags and banners they display. Their support base contains a number of clubs dedicated to supporting the team at away games. It also contains an ultras group, which was the first formed in Ireland, the SRFC Ultras, who produce choreographed displays of support at games. They have connections with other European groups including supporters of Roma, Hammarby and Panathinaikos.

Until the 1970s, Glenmalure Park regularly hosted attendances in the region of 20,000 people, but as the majority of the Irish public turned its back on Irish football, those numbers declined and despite winning the League of Ireland four times in succession in the 1980s, the attendances for the period averaged approximately a quarter of that figure. The sale of the stadium contributed to a further decline in support. During the homeless years, particularly those spent on the Northside, attendances continued to fall with the exception of those recorded during the club&#x27;s residence at the RDS, which included an opening attendance of 22,000. Prior to the relocation to Tallaght, the club&#x27;s support base had been reduced to a hardcore group of over a thousand people. However attendances improved markedly once the club moved to Tallaght stadium. As of 2010, the club had approximately 2,700 season ticket holders. The end of COVID-19 pandemic limitations on outdoor events coincided with a major boost in league attendances generally, from which Rovers also benefited. As of 2023, Rovers&#x27; average attendance stood at 6,109, the largest in the league. In 2024, with all four stands at Tallaght Stadium completed, Rovers achieved their first sell out at the new capacity over of 10,000 for the game against Bohemians. The number of season tickets sold for the 2024 season stood at over 4,200.

Throughout their history, Shamrock Rovers have shared many rivalries of differing importance and intensity. The oldest such rivalry is that shared with Shelbourne, formed on the basis of the clubs&#x27; foundations in Ringsend. It remains as a secondary rivalry of similar importance to the local derby contested with St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic. During the 1950s and 1960s, the club&#x27;s principal rival was the now-defunct, Drumcondra. In the 1970s, they were replaced as the major club on the Northside by Bohemians. Since then, the relatively minor rivalry that existed between Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians has developed into a classic rivalry, producing intense games and large attendances.

==Other teams==

===Women===
===Shamrock Rovers II===

Throughout its history Rovers have entered reserve teams in various leagues including the Leinster Senior League Senior Division, the League of Ireland B Division, the A Championship and the League of Ireland U19 Division. In 2014 they played in the League of Ireland First Division. In January 2020, it was announced that a team with the name Shamrock Rovers II would be entering the 2020 League of Ireland First Division

===Youth setup===
The current schoolboys&#x27; sections of Shamrock Rovers date back to 1996 when Rovers and Tallaght Town AFC merged to form a new section to serve the Tallaght area of South West Dublin. Tallaght Town initially remained in operation as a limited company and as trustee of a training facility used by the youth teams at Shamrock Rovers. The partnership between the two clubs broke up again in the mid-2000s, with Tallaght Town retaining the training facility at Carolan Park in Kiltipper. However, the schoolboy or underage section remained with Shamrock Rovers and was fully absorbed into the club once Rovers began playing at Tallaght Stadium in 2009. From then until 2014, Shamrock Rovers underage teams continued to play and train at Tallaght Town&#x27;s grounds at Kiltipper. However, in that year Rovers acquired their own training ground at Roadstone in Clondalkin, and the club&#x27;s underage as well as first-team moved their training base there. Shamrock Rovers also opened their own football academy at the site. The Roadstone facility has an AstroTurf pitch and two hybrid pitches (mainly grass) which were built to replace the existing grass pitches during 2016–17. The training ground was officially opened in 2017. As of February 2023, former player Shane Robinson is the director of the academy.

Over 200 underage players play for Shamrock Rovers. The club has teams at every age from under-8 up to under-13 playing in the Dublin and District Schoolboy League as well as U14, U15, U17 &amp; U19 male teams in the elite underage FAI National League.

===European record===
Shamrock Rovers have a long history in European competition. In the 1957–58 season they were the first League of Ireland side to enter European competition (Glenavon from the Irish League having entered in the same season) and featured regularly in the 1960s and 1980s. The club has had some relative success with victories in the Intertoto-Cup and the Europa League. Throughout their participation Rovers have beaten teams from Luxembourg, Cyprus, Iceland and Germany, and were the first Irish club to beat teams from Turkey, Poland, Israel, Serbia Slovakia, Albania and Hungary. Their first victory in the UEFA Champions League came in a 1–0 victory in the 2011–12 qualifying phase against FC Flora Tallinn at Tallaght Stadium.

Their biggest win was a 7–0 aggregate victory (3–0 away, 4–0 home) over Fram Reykjavik in the UEFA Cup first round in September 1982, which remains a record for League of Ireland clubs in European competition.

On 25 August 2011, they became the first Irish team to qualify for the UEFA Europa League group stage when they defeated Partizan Belgrade 2–1 after extra-time in Serbia, for a 3–2 aggregate victory.

Rovers qualified for the group stages of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League.

In the 2024–25 UEFA Europa Conference League Shamrock Rovers became the first League of Ireland side to qualify for the knockout stages of a UEFA club competition. With the 4-1 league stage win over Larne F.C., they also became the first League of Ireland side across five campaigns (three for Rovers and two for Dundalk) to win away from home in a UEFA group stage/league stage match.

<doc id="1233153" wikidata="Q5271683" url="?curid=1233153" title="Dianne Haskett">
<text>Dianne Louise Haskett (born March 4, 1955) is a Canadian lawyer, politician, and diplomat who served as the mayor of London, Ontario, Canada, serving from 1994 to 2000, and later ran unsuccessfully as the Conservative candidate in the 2006 federal by-election in the riding of London North Centre, placing third. She served two three-year mayoral terms, making a priority of downtown revitalization, heritage preservation, economic development, neighbourhood protection, protecting the environment, international relations, trade corridors&#x27; infrastructure, family values and anti-poverty initiatives.

==Early years==

Haskett was born and raised in London&#x27;s Kensal Park district north of Springbank Drive.

==Education==

Haskett earned her B.A. from the University of Waterloo in 1974, her LL.B. from the University of Western Ontario in 1977, her LL.M. from the London School of Economics in 1979 and a second LLM from The George Washington University Law School in 2005. She has also studied law at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and the Institute for Advanced Legal Studies at Cambridge University, England.

She later founded her own law firm, Haskett Menear &amp; Associates, which grew to include seven lawyers.

==Mayor==

From 1991 to 1994, Haskett was a member of London&#x27;s elected board of control on city council.

Once Haskett was elected mayor in November 1994, defeating Deputy Mayor Jack Burghardt by slightly more than 1,000 votes, she stepped aside from her duties as a lawyer and as a partner in her law firm. She was re-elected in 1997 with a landslide victory.

===Proclamation controversy===
In 1995, Dianne Haskett refused to issue a Gay Pride Proclamation on the basis that she&#x27;d previously formulated a policy of declining controversial proclamations. London City Council also declined to issue the Gay Pride Proclamation by a vote of 13-5 (Mayor Haskett abstained from voting).

Richard Hudler, president of the Homophile Association of London, Ontario (HALO), filed an official complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission in 1995, a tribunal of which ultimately determined in 1997 after a three-day public hearing that the City of London and Mayor Haskett had discriminated against HALO in the provision of a municipal service. Both the City of London and Haskett were fined $5,000.

Haskett placed a paid advertisement in The London Free Press on October 22, 1997, in which she stated that she believed the human rights case was unfairly decided and wrong in fact and law, and that the Tribunal&#x27;s decision undermined the freedoms guaranteed in the Canadian Constitution, notably freedom of expression and freedom of religion.

As an act of protest, she withdrew from her duties as mayor for three weeks (without pay) by staying in her Port Stanley, Ontario, townhouse and did not campaign during the last three weeks of the 1997 election. Deputy Mayor Grant Hopcroft, who became acting mayor during her absence, became an ardent supporter of issuing the gay pride proclamation after opposing it in 1995 in a recorded vote and refused to allow an appeal of the tribunal decision. Haskett was re-elected to a second term as mayor by a 2-1 landslide over Hopcroft. Haskett used no campaign signs during the 1997 civic election, instead using green-and-gold ribbons.

In 1996, Haskett was invited to bring greetings at an evangelical Christian rally in London called the &quot;March of Jesus&quot;. One of the speakers was Rev. Miguel Sanchez of the London Gospel Temple, who prayed for deliverance &quot;from the darkness and deception of the spirit of Islam&quot;. Haskett bowed her head during the prayer, and later said, &quot;From what I know of him, I believed Rev. Sanchez and all other participants have a great love for all people&quot;. She later described Sanchez&#x27;s comments as unfortunate. Haskett&#x27;s role in this event was strongly criticized at the time by some members of London&#x27;s Muslim community. In an effort to make sure that Londoners of all faiths felt appreciated and respected in the city, Haskett participated in a March for Tolerance from downtown to the London Muslim Mosque on Oxford Street West, where community leaders, including Haskett, addressed the crowd. She thanked the Muslim community for the many positive contributions they made to the city and urged people of all faiths to show love and respect for one another.

==Moves to Washington, D.C.==

Haskett&#x27;s second, three-year term as mayor ended in December 2000 after she decided not to run again for re-election. She was succeeded by deputy mayor Anne Marie DeCicco-Best. Haskett, her husband and daughter moved to Fairfax, Virginia, working with two D.C. area law firms in planning and implementing strategic business development and providing assistance in their immigration and estate planning work.

Haskett completed her second Master&#x27;s Law Degree in the Spring of 2005 from The George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C. She also passed the Washington D.C. Bar exam and was sworn in as an attorney and member of the D.C. Bar in December, 2005.

Haskett has also been involved in a number of other projects in the Washington, D.C. area, including speechwriting, research and marketing and acting in an advisory capacity in Senate and Congressional campaigns. She volunteered as a communications adviser and researcher for Republican Senator Elizabeth Dole. She sat as a member of the board of trustees for the International Center for Religion &amp; Diplomacy in Washington, D.C. and of Trinity Christian School of Fairfax, Virginia.

== 2006 federal by-election ==

On October 17, 2006, 1290 CJBK-AM, a London, Ontario radio station, and the A-Channel reported that Dianne Haskett had returned to London to seek the Conservative Party of Canada nomination in the London North Centre federal riding recently vacated by former Liberal MP Joe Fontana, who was a candidate for mayor of London in civic election 2006. This information was confirmed by Haskett on October 18, 2006.

On October 24, Haskett defeated Tom Weihmayr for the Conservative nomination in the federal riding of London North Centre. Haskett was widely considered to be the choice of the party hierarchy. The local riding association was ordered to hold the nomination meeting on October 24, 2006, a decision Haskett was informed of before the riding association was.

Key members of Haskett&#x27;s campaign team were campaign manager Ryan Sparrow (previously the communications director for Environment Minister Rona Ambrose), former law firm partner Michael Menear, former member of London city council Ted Wernham, London businessperson Randy Collins, and Dale Mackness.

Voting day for the federal by-election was November 27, 2006. With 253 of 253 polls reporting, the official by-election results from Elections Canada are as follows:

* 38,123 of 89,139 registered electors voted (42.8 per-cent turnout)

==Haskett returns to Washington==

A letter to Londoners appears on Haskett&#x27;s &quot;information [Web] site&quot; dated December 28, 2006, which says that she is returning to Washington, D.C. to be with her husband Jack and to continue her life there.

<doc id="1233162" wikidata="Q468413" url="?curid=1233162" title="Dominique Jean Larrey">
<text>Dominique Jean, Baron Larrey (8 July 1766 – 25 July 1842) was a French surgeon and soldier best known for his service in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. An important innovator in battlefield medicine and triage, Larrey invented the flying ambulance and is sometimes considered the first modern military surgeon.

==Early life and career==
Larrey was Born in Beaudéan, and the second of three children to Jean Larrey, a shoemaker, and Philippine Perès. His father died in 1780, When Larrey was only 13 years old. He was then sent to live with his uncle Alexis, a surgeon in Toulouse where he learned his first medical skills.

After an 8-year apprenticeship, he went to Paris to study under Pierre-Joseph Desault, who was chief surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris. His uncle gave him a letter of introduction but money was scarce and Larrey walked all the way from Toulouse to Paris. He then went to Brest, where he was appointed surgeon in the navy and began lecturing. In 1787 he boarded a ship deployed to the defense of Newfoundland, and was, at nearly 21 years-old at the time, the youngest medical officer in the French Royal Navy. While in America, Larrey took an interest in the local environment, writing observations on the local flora, fauna, climate and manners, which were published years later in his &quot; Mémoires de chirurgie militaire et campagnes du baron D.J. Larrey&quot;.

In 1789, Larrey was back in Paris, where he worked with Jean-Nicolas Corvisart, Xavier Bichat and Raphaël Bienvenu Sabatier in Les Invalides. On 14 July, Larrey was present during the Storming of the Bastille and he improvised an ambulance to treat the wounded.

== Revolutionary Wars ==
A supporter of the ideas of the Revolution, Larrey joined the French Army of the Rhine in 1792, during the War of the First Coalition. In Mainz he met with Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring. During this time, Larrey initiated the modern method of army surgery, field hospitals and the system of army ambulance corps. After seeing the speed with which the carriages of French horse artillery units maneuvered across the battlefields, Larrey adapted them as &quot;flying ambulances&quot; for rapid transport of the wounded and manned them with trained crews of drivers, corpsmen and litterbearers.

At the Battle of Metz (1793) Larrey successfully demonstrated the value of field ambulances. The quartermaster-general Jacques-Pierre Orillard de Villemanzy ordered prototypes to be built, after which ambulances would be supplied to all the Republic&#x27;s armies. The politicians heard of this, and ordered a national contest to find the best design, thus delaying their delivery by over two years. Larrey also increased the mobility and improved the organization of field hospitals, effectively creating a forerunner of modern Mobile Army Surgical Hospital units. He established a rule for the triage of war casualties, treating the wounded according to the seriousness of their injuries and urgency of need for medical care, regardless of their rank or nationality. Soldiers of enemy armies, as well as those of the French and their allies, were treated. Personally courageous, Larrey regularly worked under fire and tirelessly endeavered to rescue wounded soldiers. At one battle in 1793, he led a charge of his dragoon escort to save four injured soldiers who were being stripped of valuables by the Prussians. They were loaded into his ambulances and carried to the rear, where he operated on them and saved all their lives.

In 1794 he was sent to Toulon, where he organized the School of Surgery and Anatomy and met for the first time with Napoleon Bonaparte. He married his sweetheart, the painter Marie-Élisabeth Laville-Leroux. Larrey was a devoted husband who often wrote his wife while away and the couple would go on to have two children. In Spain he fell ill and was sent back to Paris, where he worked as a professor of anatomy at the Val-de-Grâce Medical School for a short time, in 1796, before being appointed surgeon-in-chief of the Revolutionary armies in Italy at the request of Napoleon who had heard of his distinguished reputation and remembered him from Toulon.

Larrey was appointed Surgeon-in-Chief of the Army of the Orient and departed with the Egyptian campaign in 1798. When the French army was disembarking west of Alexandria, General Caffarelli got his wooden leg caught in the rigging and fell overboard. Larrey dove into the water and dragged him to the beach, saving his life. In the aftermath of the Battle of the Pyramids, wounded Mamluk soldiers were surprised that Larrey treated them with the same humanity and respect as the French wounded. Shortly before the start of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Syria, Larrey noticed a group of British prisoners being held in deplorable conditions and asked Dupas to improve their treatment, but he refused. Larrey then went directly to Napoleon and told him of their conditions, and the general allowed them to be returned to the British on grounds that they had not directly fought against the French. At the Siege of Jaffa, an Egyptian entertainer who had been captured came to the French hospital for treatment. After helping the man, Larrey noticed the man&#x27;s pet monkey, both his companion and his livelihood, was also wounded and he offered to patch the animal up. Overcome with emotion at this unexpected offer of generousity and gentleness, the man accepted and held up the monkey while Larrey bandaged it up. The monkey returned to have its bandages replaced several times and would always run up and hug Larrey. Following the victory at the Battle of Abukir, he established a medical school for army physicians in Cairo. Many of his patients at the time were affected by ophthalmy, a disease known in Europe since the Crusades, which Larrey studied and wrote about in his memoirs. He improved the transportation of wounded soldiers through the use of dromedaries, with two chests attached to each side of their hump to carry the wounded, instead of horses of difficult movement in the desert. He was wounded during the Siege of Acre where he distinguished himself throughout the fighting and saved the life of General Arrighi who had been shot through the neck. When Jean-Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by a Syrian student in Cairo, Larrey embalmed the body which was later transported back to France for burial. The campaign ended with the Capitulation of Alexandria and Larrey returned to France in October 1801. He had been one of the privileged few offered the chance to return alongside Napoleon earlier but politely declined, saying that he would accompany him if ordered but would prefer to remain with the army who needed him more.

==Napoleonic Wars==

Larrey was well received by Napoleon upon his return and was made Surgeon-in-Chief to his Consular and later Imperial Guard and a Commander of the Légion d&#x27;honneur on 12 May 1807. Already a revered figure throughout the army, Larrey added to his laurels during the campaigns across Europe from 1805 through 1807. He was wounded at Austerlitz and at Eylau a Russian attack on the French left flank almost overran Larrey&#x27;s hospital but he calmly finished the operation he was engaged in and declared his intention to die with his patients if need be but fortunately a French cavalry charge threw the enemy back and kept the hospital safe. After the battle was over, Napoleon noticed that Larrey was not wearing a sword and Larrey explained to the Emperor that he had lost it in his baggage wagon which the Russians have overrun during the fighting. Napoleon removed his own sword and handed it to Larrey, telling him &quot;Here is mine. Accept it as a reminder of the services you rendered me at the Battle of Eylau&quot;. In 1809, he joined in the Battle of Aspern-Essling, where he operated on his close friend Marshal Jean Lannes and amputated one of his legs in two minutes. He had long been the favorite of the Emperor, who commented, &quot;If the army ever erects a monument to express its gratitude, it should do so in honor of Larrey&quot;, he was ennobled as a Baron on the field of Wagram in 1809. In 1811, Baron Larrey co-led the surgical team that performed a successful pre-anesthetic mastectomy on Frances Burney in Paris. His detailed account of this operation gives insight into early 19th century doctor-patient relationships, and early surgical methods in the home of the patient. Larrey was made head of all medical operations of the Grande Armée in the French invasion of Russia and performed wonders at Borodino where he worked himself to near exaustion due to the scale of the casualties. Larrey survived the winter retreat although he might have died during the crossing of the Berezina river had it not been for the efforts of the common soldiers. The bridge was starting to break, threatening to leave thousands stranded on the east bank and a panicked stampede erupted. Someone recognized Larrey caught up in the chaos and called out &quot;Monsieur Larrey! Save him who saved us&quot; Others joined in the call until it became a chorus and the men lifted Larrey up and passed him over their heads until he was safe on the other bank. Larrey was surprised by the reactions of the men but his selfless devotion to the well being of the sick and wounded soldiers had long become the stuff of legend by 1812 and they were going to return the favor by saving him.

Larrey continued to serve faithfully throughout the campaigns of 1813 and 1814 and when Napoleon was sent to Elba, Larrey proposed to join him, but the former Emperor refused, not wishing to make Larrey share his own fate. He rallied to Napoleon in 1815 and at Waterloo his courage under fire was noticed by the Duke of Wellington who ordered his soldiers not to fire in his direction so as to &quot;give the brave man time to gather up the wounded&quot; and saluted &quot;the courage and devotion of an age that is no longer ours&quot;. Larrey was wounded and knocked unconscious at the end of the battle. He attempted to escape to the French border once he had regained consciousness but was taken prisoner by the Prussians who bandaged his wound but wanted to execute him on the spot. Larrey was recognized by one of the German surgeons who had attended a lecture he gave years earlier in Berlin and pleaded for his life. Larrey was first sent to General Bülow who improved his condition by giving him new clothes and untying his hands, and then sent him on to Field Marshal Blücher. Larrey had previously saved the life of Blücher&#x27;s son when he was wounded near Dresden and taken prisoner by the French. Blücher treated him with respect and sent word to his wife that Larrey was alive, as the French had initially thought he had been killed on the field of Waterloo. Larrey was pardoned, invited to Blücher&#x27;s dinner table as an honored guest and sent back to France with money and proper clothes. Napoleon died in exile on May 5, 1821 and in his will, the Emperor left Larrey the sum of 100,000 francs and described him as &quot;the most virtuous man I ever knew&quot;.

==Later career==
After the empire, Larrey&#x27;s illustrious reputation ensured he was given multiple opportunities abroad, including those from the United States, Russia, and Brazil. However, he chose to remain in France. He devoted the remainder of his life to writing , but after the death of Napoleon he started a new medical career in the army as chief-surgeon in the royal guard of Louis XVIII. In 1826 he visited England, received well by British surgeons. In 1829 he was appointed in the Institut de France. A year later, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. When the July Revolution broke out in Paris in 1830, Larrey was on hand in the city and diligently tended to the wounded. The new French king, Louis Philippe I, made him a consultant surgeon and medical director at Les Invalides, a retirement home for aged and disabled soldiers. When Napoleon&#x27;s remains were returned to France in 1840, Larrey insisted on braving the cold to pay his respects as the emperor&#x27;s funeral procession passed through the streets of Paris. In 1842 Larrey went to Algiers for a health inspection, together with his son, but contracted pneumonia on his way back, dying in Lyon on 25 July. His body was taken to Paris and buried at the Père-Lachaise Cemetery. His remains were transferred to Les Invalides and re-interred near Napoleon&#x27;s tomb in December 1992.

Larrey&#x27;s writings are still regarded as valuable sources of surgical and medical knowledge and have been translated into all modern languages. Between 1800 and 1840 at least 28 books or articles were published. His son Hippolyte (born 1808) was surgeon-in-ordinary to the emperor Napoleon III.

<doc id="1233164" wikidata="Q349583" url="?curid=1233164" title="José Alencar">
<text>José Alencar Gomes da Silva (; 17 October 1931 – 29 March 2011) was a Brazilian businessman, entrepreneur and politician who served as the 23rd vice president of Brazil from 1 January 2003 to 1 January 2011. In business from a young age, Alencar became a self-made multimillionaire as the chief executive of Coteminas, a leading textile manufacturer. In the 1990s, Alencar groomed his son to succeed him at the company.

He opted to enter politics in his home state, Minas Gerais. Alencar had a business-oriented political platform, advocating market liberalization and deregulation of production. His expensive political campaigns received hefty funds from Coteminas. After a failed run in 1994 for governor of Minas Gerais, he won the election in 1998 as Senator representing his home state.

In 2002, Alencar was invited by the left-wing Workers&#x27; Party to run for vice president on the same ticket as Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The alliance between the leftist union leader and Alencar, an experienced entrepreneur, proved successful. They won the 2002 Brazilian general election and were re-elected in 2006. Over the years, Lula da Silva and Alencar developed a close and affectionate friendship. Diagnosed with cancer of the stomach and kidney in 1997, Alencar died of the disease in 2011.

Alencar came to be revered among journalists and politicians for his spirited personality and friendly demeanor. He overcame his lack of formal education. Based on his business success, he argued in favor of lower taxes, especially indirect taxation over consumers, and a simpler tax system; lower interest rates and greater oversight of the banking industry; and social welfare and assistance programs. As Vice President, Alencar sometimes spoke out against his own government&#x27;s orthodox policies, causing embarrassment for fellow administration members. His unwavering determination to live in the face of terminal cancer also marked public perception, during and after his time in office.

==Biography==
Alencar was born into a family of small entrepreneurs from Muriaé, in the inland state of Minas Gerais on 17 October 1931. He was the eleventh son of Antônio Gomes da Silva and Dolores Peres Gomes da Silva. As a child, he was a Boy Scout.

He started working while still a child, dropping out of primary school to help his father in the family business. He worked with his older brothers for years before becoming an independent successful businessman. For a time he worked as a travelling salesman and in food wholesale start-ups.

Alencar eventually turned his family&#x27;s small clothes factory and retail store into a major business. In 1967, he founded Coteminas, which he would lead to become one of Brazil&#x27;s largest textile manufacturers. He produced goods for traditional brands in its portfolio, such as Artex, Santista and Calfat. He vied for dominance of the global market after a merger with South Carolina-based Springs Industries.

===Political career===

After decades as a businessman, Alencar decided to enter politics and prepared his son to take over his leadership of Coteminas. He ran for governor of Minas Gerais in 1994. Although he was not successful, in 1998 he was elected as Senator from Minas Gerais. While in the Senate, Alencar worked on several Commissions, including the Senatorial Commission for Economic and Social Matters.

In 2002, he left the presidency of his company, by then a leading player with roughly 850 million reais in yearly net sales, to his son Josué Gomes da Silva. 
Alencar ran for Vice President of Brazil, tapped to be Lula&#x27;s running mate, to assuage worries about the candidate&#x27;s alleged anti-business bias. He became the honorary President of the center-right Liberal Party.

At the end of 2005, Alencar left his party to associate with the new Brazilian Republican Party, whose founders included Bishop Marcelo Crivella of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, a large and growing evangelical church in Brazil and other countries. Crivella is also a Senator representing Rio de Janeiro in the federal government.

====Vice Presidency (2003-2011)====
In office, Alencar aligned with another successful businessman in the cabinet, Luiz Fernando Furlan, to channel the demands of Brazilian businessmen. They voiced discontent with bureaucracy, insufficient infrastructure and cautious monetary policy. His efforts led to the strengthening of Apex-Brasil, a pro-export agency seen as instrumental in the Brazilian economy&#x27;s recent rise in exports.

Alencar was the most notable person in government to openly complain of the conservative monetary policies of the Brazilian Central Bank, under Henrique Meirelles, backed by ministers Antonio Palocci and Paulo Bernardo. He often criticized his own administration for failing to lower the Central Bank&#x27;s base interest rates and demanded a reform of the country&#x27;s tax system.

In November 2004 he was sworn in as Defense Minister, following the resignation of José Viegas Filho. Lula turned to him to occupy the position. Alencar tried to resign on several occasions, claiming that a businessman would hardly be the best choice for running a nation&#x27;s military forces. President Lula convinced him to stay until March 2006, when Alencar resigned his ministerial post, in favor of anti-graft activist Waldir Pires.

Despite his disagreements with some policies of the Lula administration, Alencar was officially invited by Lula to be his running mate in the 2006 general elections. With Lula&#x27;s re-election victory on 29 October, Alencar secured his position as vice president for another term. Alencar adopted a lower tone, while still espousing his traditional positions. He sought to run for the Senate in 2010, but was forced to give up due to the advanced stage of his cancer disease.

==Personal life==

After getting established, Alencar married Mariza Gomes in 1957. They had three children together. Their two daughters are Maria da Graça and Patrícia. Their son Josué took over the presidency of Coteminas after his father went into politics.

As a result of a case filed by Rosemary de Morais, a 55-year-old retired teacher, in July 2010 the court ruled that Alencar needed to recognize her as his daughter. (The case may be appealed.) He had refused to undergo DNA testing but, according to Brazilian law 12.004/2009, this refusal is accepted as evidence of paternity. In addition, the judge ruled that other evidence in the case led him to his decision. Rosemary de Morais said she was the child of Francisca de Morais, a nurse, and Alencar, from a relationship they had in 1954, before either was married. In 2015, the Superior Court of Justice recognized Rosemary as Alencar&#x27;s daughter.

==Disease and death==

On a routine check-up, José Alencar was diagnosed with stomach and kidney cancer in 1997. After undergoing treatment for some length of time, he had his right kidney and two-thirds of his stomach surgically removed. Five years later, a malignant tumor in his prostate was removed. As the disease had metastasized, it continued to spread, and in 2006 doctors discovered a sarcoma in his abdomen. On 26 January 2009, a surgery extirpated eight tumors, along with compromised portions of his small and large intestines and the ureters. He was treated for digestive hemorrhage in December 2010 with urgent surgery, his last as vice president. Doctors could not remove the tumors in his abdomen because of the number of operations to which he had already been subjected – eighteen in all. Alencar received chemotherapy for many years. He was mostly treated at Hospital Sírio-Libanês, in São Paulo. He also received experimental treatment at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.

Alencar died in late March 2011, in the city of São Paulo, after 13 years battling metastasized cancer. His death was met with expressions of grief and respect by members of different institutions and across the political spectrum – former President Lula said he knew &quot;few men with José Alencar&#x27;s goodness and spirit&quot; and President Rousseff said it was an &quot;honor&quot; to have served alongside him. Brazil held a state funeral for José Alencar, and Vice President Michel Temer decreed seven days of official mourning. Alencar is remembered as an honest and independent politician who favored social welfare and economic freedom.

<text>Washington Curran Whitthorne (April 19, 1825September 21, 1891) was a Tennessee attorney, Democratic politician, and an Adjutant General in the Confederate Army.

==Early life and career==
Whitthorne was born near Petersburg, Tennessee in Marshall County. One day when Whitthorne was young James K. Polk stayed at his family&#x27;s home. Polk saw how bright he was and asked, &quot;What are you going to make of this boy?&quot; His father replied &quot;I am going to make him the President of the United States.&quot; Polk then told them to send the boy to Columbia and he would make him a lawyer. He attended Campbell Academy in Lebanon, Tennessee and subsequently East Tennessee College (now the University of Tennessee) where he graduated in 1843. He subsequently studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1845, serving in various governmental positions, and working for James K. Polk until he entered private practice in 1848 in Columbia, Tennessee. He owned slaves. On July 4, 1848 Whitthorne married Matilda Jane Campbell, a cousin of Polk.

He was elected to serve in the Tennessee State Senate from 1855 to 1858. Whitthorne was then elected Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1859 to 1861.

==Civil War service==
In 1861 he became Adjutant General of Tennessee for the Confederacy, and served in that post through the end of the Civil War. He also served on the staff of generals Robert Anderson, Marcus Joseph Wright, Samuel P. Carter, and William J. Hardee.

==Postbellum career==
After Lee had surrendered at Appomattox, Whitthorne was held as prisoner of war at Columbia in order to be shielded from Federal prosecution. President Andrew Johnson interceded, gave him a Presidential pardon, and restored his civil rights. In 1870, Whitthorne began a campaign for the United States House of Representatives. He won the election and would eventually serve six consecutive terms during his initial service in the House of Representatives, chairing the House Committee on Naval Affairs from 1875 to 1881.

Upon the resignation of Senator Howell E. Jackson, Whitthorne was appointed to the U.S. Senate by governor of Tennessee William B. Bate and then subsequently elected to the balance of the term by the Tennessee General Assembly, serving in the Senate from April 16, 1886 to March 3, 1887. Following his Senate service he served two more subsequent consecutive terms in the United States House of Representatives, from 1887 to 1891. After serving in the House of Representatives Whitthorne returned to Columbia and died there later in 1891, being interred at Rose Hill Cemetery. Whitthorne Middle School in Columbia, formerly Whitthorne Junior High School, is named in his honor.

<doc id="1233173" wikidata="Q568113" url="?curid=1233173" title="Text normalization">
<text>Text normalization is the process of transforming text into a single canonical form that it might not have had before. Normalizing text before storing or processing it allows for separation of concerns, since input is guaranteed to be consistent before operations are performed on it. Text normalization requires being aware of what type of text is to be normalized and how it is to be processed afterwards; there is no all-purpose normalization procedure.

== Applications==

Text normalization is frequently used when converting text to speech. Numbers, dates, acronyms, and abbreviations are non-standard &quot;words&quot; that need to be pronounced differently depending on context. For example:

* &quot;$200&quot; would be pronounced as &quot;two hundred dollars&quot; in English, but as &quot;lua selau tālā&quot; in Samoan.
* &quot;vi&quot; could be pronounced as &quot;vie,&quot; &quot;vee,&quot; or &quot;the sixth&quot; depending on the surrounding words.

Text can also be normalized for storing and searching in a database. For instance, if a search for &quot;resume&quot; is to match the word &quot;résumé,&quot; then the text would be normalized by removing diacritical marks; and if &quot;john&quot; is to match &quot;John&quot;, the text would be converted to a single case. To prepare text for searching, it might also be stemmed (e.g. converting &quot;flew&quot; and &quot;flying&quot; both into &quot;fly&quot;), canonicalized (e.g. consistently using American or British English spelling), or have stop words removed.

== Techniques ==

For simple, context-independent normalization, such as removing non-alphanumeric characters or diacritical marks, regular expressions would suffice. For example, the sed script codice_1 would normalize runs of whitespace characters into a single space. More complex normalization requires correspondingly complicated algorithms, including domain knowledge of the language and vocabulary being normalized. Among other approaches, text normalization has been modeled as a problem of tokenizing and tagging streams of text and as a special case of machine translation.

==Textual scholarship==
In the field of textual scholarship and the editing of historic texts, the term &quot;normalization&quot; implies a degree of modernization and standardization – for example in the extension of scribal abbreviations and the transliteration of the archaic glyphs typically found in manuscript and early printed sources. A &quot;normalized edition&quot; is therefore distinguished from a &quot;diplomatic edition&quot; (or &quot;semi-diplomatic edition&quot;), in which some attempt is made to preserve these features. The aim is to strike an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, rigorous fidelity to the source text (including, for example, the preservation of enigmatic and ambiguous elements); and, on the other, producing a new text that will be comprehensible and accessible to the modern reader. The extent of normalization is therefore at the discretion of the editor, and will vary. Some editors, for example, choose to modernize archaic spellings and punctuation, but others do not.

<text>St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic Football Club, commonly known as Pat&#x27;s or The Athletic, is a professional Irish association football club based in Inchicore, Dublin, that plays in the League of Ireland Premier Division. Founded in May 1929, they played originally in Phoenix Park but they moved to their current ground of Richmond Park in 1939.

St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic have won many trophies in Irish Club Football, including eight League Titles, the fifth most in Irish Football, as well as five FAI Cups and four League Cups.

The club graduated through the ranks of the Leinster Senior League and duly took their place in the League of Ireland in 1951, and won the Championship at their first attempt. The club&#x27;s glory years came in the 1950s and 1990s when they won 6 of their 8 league titles. The club also have the record for never having been relegated from the Premier Division. The club play in red and white colours and their nicknames include the &quot;Saints&quot;, &quot;Supersaints&quot; and &quot;Pats&quot;. The Saints also have a lot of Dublin Derby games with the likes of Shelbourne, Shamrock Rovers, and Bohemians.

==History==

===Leinster Senior League years===
During the late 1940s and 1950s, St Pats played in the Leinster Senior League. During this period they won the league title on six occasions. This included four successive titles between 1947 and 1948 and 1950–51. In 1947–48 St Pats completed a treble after also winning both the FAI Intermediate Cup and Leinster Senior Cup. The 1948–49 season would see St Pats win a Leinster Senior League / FAI Intermediate Cup double. In 1950–51 a young Shay Gibbons helped St Pats win the Leinster Senior League title for the fourth time. After St Pats first team joined the League of Ireland in 1951–52, their reserve team won two further Leinster Senior League titles in 1955–56 and 1956–57.

===1950–1960===

====Entering the League of Ireland====
In 1951–52 the club was admitted, along with Cork side Evergreen United, to the League of Ireland. St Pats made an immediate impact, winning the league championship at their first attempt. Two more league championship successes followed in 1954–55 and 1955–56. The club had to wait until 1959 before their first FAI Cup success, repeating the feat in 1961. Despite several appearances in the final since 1961, it took the Saints till 2014 to win their third

Many of the Pats players of that golden era are still recalled fondly today—Ginger O&#x27;Rourke, Harry Boland (&#x27;The Legend&#x27;, 1926–2000), Jimmy &#x27;Timber&#x27; Cummins (a cousin of one of the founders—Bart Cummins) Jimmy &#x27;Growler&#x27; Cummins (a brother of Bart Cummins) Irish international Shay Gibbons, Ronnie Whelan Snr. and Willie Peyton are players who contributed greatly during this era.

===1960–1980===
St Pats struggled throughout the late 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s with only the odd cup final or young star emerging to brighten things for long-suffering Pats fans. Among those players to emerge was Noel Campbell. Campbell spent a number of years with St Pats (gaining the first of his Irish caps) before moving to SC Fortuna Köln where he would play 8 seasons. Perhaps the brightest star to play for St Pats was Paul McGrath. McGrath was signed by Saints manager Charlie Walker from junior side Dalkey United. Within a year he had won the PFAI Player of the Year award and earned himself a move to Manchester United. The World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks also played one match for St Pats, making him by far the brightest star to turn out for the club in 1977.

===1980–1990===
The appointment of Brian Kerr as manager in 1986 was a major turning point in the fortunes of the club. Kerr worked on limited resources to create a team capable of challenging the best. At the end of the 1988–89 season, St Pats left Richmond Park for what the board of directors called &quot;a short time&quot; while redevelopment work was done. 1989 saw a joint St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic &amp; Bohemians side play a friendly against the Libya national team in Tripoli, drawing 1–1 in what was a highly controversial friendly during Colonel Gaddafi&#x27;s reign as leader of Libya.
The year 1990 saw the Saints draw 0–0 with the Tunisia national team in Tunis and another 0–0 draw with the Iran national football team in Tehran, while in April of the following year they beat Finland 2–1 at Dalymount Park, leaving the club with an undefeated record against international sides and without conceding a goal.

===1990–1999===
Playing in Harold&#x27;s Cross, Kerr&#x27;s blend of young players (Paul Osam, Curtis Fleming, Pat Fenlon, John McDonnell) and experienced campaigners disregarded by other clubs (Damian Byrne, Dave Henderson) won the club&#x27;s first league championship in 34 years on Easter Monday 1990. Most Irish football commentators expected the young Saints to dominate Irish football for some time. A series of takeover attempts saw the club thrust into turmoil and Kerr was forced to break up the team. In the summer of 1992, the club were hours away from extinction before a group of local investors raised £82,000 to save the club.

Having spent four years in Harold&#x27;s Cross the club returned to a new look Richmond Park in 1993, their spiritual home in Dublin&#x27;s Inchicore. Brian Kerr began the task of creating a winning setup once again. With the aid of a newly appointed Chief executive, and former player, Pat Dolan and by the club&#x27;s new chairman, Tim O&#x27;Flaherty, the league trophy returned to Richmond Park in 1996.

A new generation of footballing heroes emerged in Pats colours with greats such as Eddie Gormley, Paul Osam and Ricky O&#x27;Flaherty together with exciting young stars such as Colin Hawkins and Trevor Molloy thousands flocked to Inchicore for Friday nights under the floodlights in Richmond Park. When Kerr resigned to take up the Director of Coaching job with the FAI, the good work was continued by Pat Dolan and then Liam Buckley installed as manager. The glory continued as further league championships were secured in 1998 and 1999 which led to European qualification and a creditable 0–0 draw with the famous Celtic at Celtic Park, the club lost the return leg in Tolka Park, Dublin but the away draw was a major boost for Irish football against such a famous club in the world game. The club, however, suffered a humiliating setback in the same competition one year later when they lost 10–0 on aggregate to Zimbru Chişinău.

===2000–2004===
Into the new century, the success continued. St Pats won the Leinster Senior Cup in 2000/01. Controversy dogged the club in the 2001/02 season due to player registration irregularities. The club had 9 points deducted due to fielding an ineligible player (Paul Marney) in their first 3 games of the season, but this decision was revoked upon arbitration, on 22 March 2002. They then had 15 points deducted for playing Charles Mbabazi Livingstone in the first 5 matches of the season in spite of not having registered him until 12 September 2001. An FAI arbitration panel rejected the Saints&#x27; appeal against the point deduction and Shelbourne finished the season as league champions. St Pats disagreed with the decision so much that they claim they won the league in 2001–02, as they would have beaten Shelbourne to the title without the points deduction. St. Patrick&#x27;s however finished third and would take their place in the following season&#x27;s Intertoto Cup.

That season also saw St Patrick&#x27;s come close to merging with fellow League of Ireland club St. Francis. This move was greeted with anger by club supporters and although St. Francis went out of business (and therefore the league) the merger never happened.

New club chairman Andrew O&#x27;Callaghan was appointed in the summer of 2002 and has worked to modernize the club and face the new challenges of UEFA licensing and ground development. St Pats made Irish footballing history in 2002 by becoming the first club to progress in the Intertoto Cup with a victory over Croatian team NK Rijeka over two legs—the club were eventually knocked out of the competition only on away goals to KAA Gent of Belgium.

===Johnny McDonnell Reign (2004–2009)===


The club marked its 75th anniversary in 2004, also in 2004, a change of management happened with former favourite Johnny McDonnell taking over the helm at the club. In 2005 the club were forced to investigate the idea of sharing a new stadium in Tallaght with Shamrock Rovers in order to comply with the FAI&#x27;s wish for Dublin clubs to ground share. The move was met with furious protests by the club&#x27;s supporters and a group of concerned fans formed a committee under the banner of &#x27;Pats 4 Richmond&#x27; . The committee was set up at a public meeting called in the Red Cow Hotel by lifelong supporters and former Director Dermot O&#x27;Hara. At this first meeting a committee was elected and a letter was draughted and delivered by hand the following day to the Clubs Board of Directors by newly elected Chairman of Pats 4 Richmond Dermot O&#x27;Hara. The letter contained demands for the Club to cease all negotiations regarding any move to Tallaght and to declare its intention to stay in Inchicore and commit itself to the development of Richmond Park as the Clubs permanent home and to cease all further negotiations regarding their planned move to Tallaght. Momentum quickly gathered for the Pats 4 Richmond campaign as the media and many other clubs in the league came in behind the fans demands to save their spiritual home in Inchicore. Subsequent public meetings were help in St Michaels Community Centre on a monthly basis and the pressure was mounting on the Club. At these highly charged meetings fans were briefed on the progress of the campaign. A petition was launched and over 5,0000 signatures were collected demanding the club cease any further plans to sell Richmond Park or to join a groundshare with Shamrock Rovers in Tallaght. Finally in July the Club relented and signalled their commitment to stay in Richmond Park. A lot of this was down to the fact that a new owner Garrett Kelliher had just bought the Club and would make a commitment to develop a proper Stadiun in Inchicore. Garrett Kelliher began this project by purchasing the Richmond House pub (also known as McDowell&#x27;s) for use as an official clubhouse. To date the club is still in negotiations with the local council to construct a new Stadium in Inchicore. The club lost yet another FAI Cup Final in December 2006 and their hunt for their third victory in the elusive competition continues. In early 2007 the club was purchased by a wealthy property magnate Garrett Kelleher. After a number of months of negotiations, Kelleher finally announced himself as Chairman of St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic on 19 July 2007. One of his first acts on taking over St Pats was to appoint ex-manager Brian Kerr as director of football. It was widely reported in Irish newspapers that Kelleher was preparing to spend €50;million on upgrading St Pats&#x27; Richmond Park home. 
During the 2007 season Pats were neck and neck with Drogheda United for the title, but Pats slipped away and Drogheda United eventually finished up as champions.
It was the same again for the 2008 season with Pats battling up the top with Bohemians for the title. Also, this year Pats were in Europe because their second-place finish in 2007 allowed them to qualify for the 2008–09 UEFA Cup. During their European run St Pats progressed through two rounds of the UEFA Cup beating JFK Olimps Riga and Elfsborg but the run came to an end when they lost to Hertha BSC in the First Round proper. Pats also lost out to Bohemians for the league title.

===Jeff Kenna season: European run and domestic struggle (2009)===
For the 2009 season Pats replaced Johnny McDonnell with Jeff Kenna in January 2009. He didn&#x27;t have the best of starts with a 3–0 home defeat to his former club Galway United. He was immediately put under pressure when a bad run of results put them into a relegation battle. Despite the poor league form, once again Pats had another European run in the Europa League again progressing through two rounds of the Europa League, thus becoming only the second League of Ireland club (after Cork City in 2004 and 2005) to achieve such progress in two consecutive European campaigns. Pats this time won games against Valletta FC and Russian Premier League side Krylia Sovetov to reach the play-off round where they were defeated by FC Steaua București.
In September 2009 with Pats struggling, Kenna resigned and was replaced for two games by Maurice O&#x27;Driscoll. Pete Mahon then took over until the end of the season and avoided relegation, winning two must-win games in the final two weeks of the season, away to Drogheda United and at home to Dublin rivals Shamrock Rovers.

===Pete Mahon years (2009–2011)===
Pete Mahon was appointed as manager for the 2010 season with John Gill as his assistant. The Super Saints reached their first Setanta Sports Cup final, where they met local rivals Bohemians after overcoming Sligo Rovers 6–2 over two legs. They lost the final at the Tallaght Stadium 1–0, however. The Saints were knocked out of the FAI Cup by archrivals Shamrock Rovers in a semi-final replay at Richmond Park, after knocking Dundalk, Belgrove and Sporting Fingal out. They were near the top of the table for the majority of the season; however, fell off somewhat near the end and finished in mid-table. The demise of Sporting Fingal saw the Saints take their European place for the 2011 season. Mahon led a successful Europa League campaign, knocking out Íþróttabandalag Vestmannaeyja from Iceland and FC Shakhter Karagandy from Kazakhstan before eventually being knocked out in the third qualifying round by Ukrainian side FC Karpaty Lviv. The Saints won the 2011 Leinster Senior Cup after beating Dublin rivals Bohemians 2–0 at Dalymount Park. The Saints&#x27; bid to end their 50-year drought of winning the FAI Cup came to an end, after knocking Crumlin United, Waterford United and Cork City out, the Saints faced old rivals Shelbourne in the semi-final. The Saints drew 1–1 at Tolka Park, failing to make use of their one-man advantage for the whole second half. The game went to a replay at Richmond Park and things were going well when David McMillan opened the scoring for the Saints, but goalkeeper Gary Rogers was extremely harshly sent off early on and Shels went on to win, 3–1. Similar to the 2010 season, the Saints were near the top of the table for the most part of the season in 2011, but their title challenge petered out towards the end of the season and the Saints finished fourth meaning they would participate in UEFA Europa League qualifiers in the 2012 season.

===Return of Liam Buckley: Return of success (2012–2018)===

The Saints decided not to renew manager Pete Mahon&#x27;s contract for the 2012 season, appointing former player and manager Liam Buckley to the job, giving him a two-year contract with former player and assistant manager at the club, Trevor Croly as his assistant. Buckley refurbished the squad by bringing in fourteen and getting rid of sixteen. Among the new signings were six Bohemian players, notably Chris Forrester, Christy Fagan, and Ger O&#x27;Brien. Meanwhile, six of those not retained by Pats went in the opposite direction, an indication of the change in circumstances at both clubs.

Buckley immediately introduced a more attractive brand of football than was witnessed under Mahon, whose sides had generally punched above their weight but ultimately lacked the quality to seriously challenge for the title. Pats started the season off well with the team playing wonderful football and being unbeaten in its first six games, which included the game against Shamrock Rovers which they demonstrated their wonderful football brilliantly in a 5–1 win over their fierce rivals. Buckley took the reins of the club knowing of the European expectations at the club and he didn&#x27;t disappoint, managing his side to a third qualifying-round place after knocking both Íþróttabandalag Vestmannaeyja and NK Široki Brijeg out after extra time, to earn a tie with German powerhouse Hannover 96, who knocked the Saints out in the third qualifying round. Buckley&#x27;s side finished 3rd in the league, 6 points off champions Sligo Rovers. He also guided his side to the 2012 FAI Cup Final, the club&#x27;s first game at the Aviva Stadium, but lost 3–2 in extra time to Derry City and extending the Saints&#x27; FAI Cup-winning drought to 52 years.

The Saints then endured a tumultuous pre-season, losing Sean O&#x27;Connor, James Chambers, and Barry Murphy, as well as Buckley&#x27;s number two, Trevor Croly, to rivals Shamrock Rovers. Crucially, though, Pats held on to a number of other players who had been strongly linked with Rovers, including Chris Forrester and Ian Bermingham, and added some quality to the first XI in the form of Killian Brennan (who would go on to win both the PFAI Players&#x27; Player of the Year and FAI National League Player of the Year awards), and Conan Byrne (who contributed an impressive 9 league goals during the season).

St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic clinched their ninth League of Ireland title on 13 October 2013 after a 2–0 win against holders Sligo Rovers with two games to spare. They lifted the league trophy a week later at home to Derry City on 18 October and two days later played the 2013 Leinster Senior Cup Final against Shamrock Rovers, losing, 1–0, at Richmond Park.

The 2014 season started off with silverware for the Saints as they beat Sligo Rovers 1–0 in the inaugural President of Ireland&#x27;s Cup, with Keith Fahey scoring a brilliant volley into the top corner from 25 yards clinching the trophy. The club crashed out of the UEFA Champions League at the first hurdle in the second round, bowing out to Legia Warsaw. In the first leg, they were denied a famous away win as Legia equalised in injury time to claim a 1–1 draw. An injury-plagued Pats side lost the second leg 5–0 at Tallaght Stadium, conceding 3 in the last 10 minutes.
On 9 September 2014, a team of second-string players and young Saints beat Longford Town 2–1 away from home to win the 2014 Leinster Senior Cup with Sam Verdon and Jack Bayly scoring.
The season ended in a perfect manner for Pats as they won the FAI Cup after a 53-year wait with a 2–0 win over Derry City at the Aviva Stadium, with Christy Fagan immortalising himself with the club&#x27;s fans by scoring a brace. Fagan also won the 2014 League of Ireland Golden Boot with 20 goals as well as being voted the PFAI Player of the Year for 2014.

On 19 September 2015, the Saints won their third League of Ireland Cup, beating Galway United on penalties at Eamonn Deacy Park following a 0–0 draw after extra time, with young goalkeeper Conor O&#x27;Malley saving Andy O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s final spot-kick to win the cup.

In 2016 the Saints knocked Jeunesse Esch of Luxembourg out of the UEFA Europa League on away goals before being narrowly beaten 2–1 on aggregate to Dinamo Minsk of Belarus in the second qualifying round. Pats finished 7th in the 2016 season, meaning they would be without European football for the first time in 7 years for 2017. They did, however, successfully retain their League of Ireland Cup crown, beating Limerick 4–1 in the final at the Markets Field with two goals from Conan Byrne and one each for Jamie McGrath and Graham Kelly.

The 2017 season was the first in a change of the League of Ireland layout, meaning the bottom three teams in the Premier Division would be relegated in order to make the league a 10-team division rather than a 12-team one. The season turned out to be a struggle for the Saints and they sat bottom of the table at the halfway point. The mid-season signings including fan favourite Killian Brennan, former Premier League midfielder Owen Garvan and particularly Dutch centre back Jordi Balk, proved to be pivotal as the club went on to win 6 of their last 11 games after picking up just 3 wins in their first 21 games of the season. They went into the last day of the season in need of a point away to Derry City, which they earned via a 1–1 draw with a goal from Killian Brennan keeping their record of never having been relegated intact.

The following season was a great improvement on the field as Pats sat in a European place at the halfway point in the league but later went on their worst losing streak in the club&#x27;s history as they lost 8 games in a row, scoring just 3 goals along the way. They then managed to pick up their form, winning 4 out of 6 games but on 22 September 2018 the Saints suffered a 3–1 loss at home to a weakened Bohemians side with several of their under-19 side playing among the 11 changes to their previous starting 11. This turned out to be Liam Buckley&#x27;s last game in charge of the club as it was announced on 25 September that Buckley had left his post by mutual consent after a 7-year spell in charge of the club.

Assistant manager to Buckley and former club captain Ger O&#x27;Brien took caretaker charge for the last 5 games of the season, the first of those being the Leinster Senior Cup Final which they lost on penalties against Shelbourne at Tolka Park. He also saw out a draw away to champions Dundalk and had an aggregate score of 9–0 against Limerick and Derry City as the club ended the season on a high note in 5th place.

===The Harry Kenny months (October 2018 – August 2019)===
On 24 October 2018 it was announced that Harry Kenny (who had been assistant manager in the 2013 league-winning campaign) would be the new manager of the club, signing a two-year contract. His new signings ahead of the 2019 season were Gary Shaw, David Webster, Ciaran Kelly, Cian Coleman, Georgie Poynton, Brandon Miele, Michael Drennan, Rhys McCabe and old fan favorite Chris Forrester, stating that his aim was to get the club back competing in European competition. Kenny&#x27;s first competitive game in charge of the Saints was on 15 February 2019, a 1–0 opening-day victory over league runners-up Cork City at Richmond Park, with the game attracting the biggest attendance at a domestic game since October 2010. This was followed by a sell-out against rivals Shamorck Rovers on 8 March. On 25 April 2019 it was announced that the club had been awarded a licence to compete in UEFA Europa League action for the 2019–20 campaign ahead of Waterford, who had finished one place ahead of Pats in fourth place the previous season, but were not awarded a licence due to their club reforming in late 2016 and thus breaking UEFA&#x27;s &#x27;three-year rule&#x27;. Pats drew IFK Norrköping of Sweden and were beaten 2–0 at home and 2–1 away, knocking them out at the first hurdle. With the team scoring just 24 goals in 29 games and attendances steadily dropping, fans became restless with Kenny and after a shock cup exit to UCD on 23 August 2019, Kenny resigned by mutual consent the following day.

===Stephen O&#x27;Donnell reign &amp; FAI Cup win (August 2019 – December 2021)===

Former Dundalk captain Stephen O&#x27;Donnell was announced as the head coach on a two-year contract on 31 August 2019, his first job in senior management, following the resignation of Harry Kenny. His brought in his former Arsenal youth and Falkirk teammate (and former Pats player) Pat Cregg as his assistant. His first game in management came on 6 September 2019 as his Pats side came from behind to win 2−1 away to Finn Harps thanks to goals from Darragh Markey and substitute Rhys McCabe. The club finished in 5th place by the end of the season, missing out on a UEFA Europa League place but they did however win the 2018–19 Leinster Senior Cup, beating Wexford 3–0 in the Fourth Round (under Harry Kenny), Cabinteely 1–0 in the Quarter Final, with Under 19&#x27;s manager Jamie Moore managing a side made up of Under 15, Under 17 and Under 19&#x27;s players in the Semi Final (beating Sheriff YC 3–1 away) and Final (beating Athlone Town 4–0), as both games were scheduled after the senior team&#x27;s season had finished.

O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s first pre-season saw him make wholesale changes to the squad, releasing 10 players including some who were still in contract and bringing in 9 new signings; Jason McClelland, Robbie Benson, Conor Kearns, Rory Feely, Shane Griffin, Billy King, Dan Ward, Martin Rennie and Ollie Younger. The season was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic after 4 games and following 4 months of postponements, a decision was made to half the season from 36 games to 18. The season finished in disappointment for Pats as they missed out on European football on the final day of the season, while they had previously been knocked out of the FAI Cup in the First Round by Finn Harps.

The 2021 season was a hugely successful one for the club, as they secured a 2nd-place finish, securing UEFA Europa Conference League football for 2022, as well as winning the 2021 FAI Cup by beating Bohemians in a penalty shootout in the Final, in front of an Aviva Stadium FAI Cup Final record crowd of 37,126.

===Tim Clancy spell (December 2021 – May 2023)===
On 2 December 2021, just 4 days after the club&#x27;s 2021 FAI Cup Final win, it was announced that Tim Clancy had joined the club on a 2-year contract to replace the outgoing Stephen O&#x27;Donnell, whose controversial departure to Dundalk had yet to be confirmed amid a legal battle between the clubs. In late December 2021 a High Court action was filed against O&#x27;Donnell by the club.

On 26 January 2022, it was announced that the club had sold academy graduate James Abankwah to Italian Serie A side Udinese for an undisclosed fee believed to a record fee paid for a League of Ireland player, in the region of €800,000 plus add ons.

On 2 May 2022, it was announced that the clubs would enter the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League at the Second Qualifying round, rather than the First, following UEFA&#x27;s decision to ban Russian clubs from competing in their competitions for the season.

Clancy&#x27;s first taste of managing in European football came with a 1–1 draw at home to Slovenian side NŠ Mura. The second leg saw his side advance 6–5 on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time. The next round saw Pat&#x27;s beat Bulgarian side CSKA Sofia 1–0 away before suffering the heartache of a 2–0 loss in the second leg at Tallaght Stadium following a controversial late penalty.
On 2 May 2023, Clancy departed the club by mutual consent with this side in 7th place, 13 games into the 2023 season. Assistant manager Jon Daly took charge of the team on an interim basis.

===Jon Daly&#x27;s men – More Cup success (May 2023 – May 2024)===

After winning 3 of his 4 games as interim manager, it was announced on 22 May 2023 that Jon Daly had received the role of manager on a permanent basis, on a contract until the end of 2025. The club&#x27;s 2023 European campaign was short as they failed at the first hurdle, losing 2–1 away and 3–2 at home to F91 Dudelange, of Luxembourg.

On 12 November 2023, Daly led the club to a fifth FAI Cup title, as his side won the 2023 FAI Cup Final, beating rivals Bohemians 3–1 in front of a record breaking FAI Cup Final crowd of 43,881 at the Aviva Stadium. On 1 December 2023, Chris Forrester was named PFAI Player of the Year and Sam Curtis was named PFAI Young Player of the Year for their stellar performances throughout 2023.

On 9 February 2024, Pat&#x27;s competed in the 2024 President of Ireland&#x27;s Cup, but were defeated 3–1 by Shamrock Rovers at Tallaght Stadium.

In March 2024, ahead of a friendly fixture away to Major League Soccer side Minnesota United, the club announced American investment group Kenosis Sports Group, including NFL and NHL athletes Joe Flacco, Chad Greenway, Matt Birk and Anders Lee, as strategic investors into St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic.

On 7 May 2024, it was announced that Daly had been relieved of his duties as manager with the club in 7th place following 7 defeats in their opening 15 games of the 2024 season.

===Stephen Kenny era (May 2024 – Present)===
On 16 May 2024, the club announced a major coup, by appointing the most recent Republic of Ireland national team manager Stephen Kenny, as their manager on a contract until the end of the 2029 season. On 25 July 2024, Kenny took charge of his first European fixture with the club, beating Vaduz of Liechtenstein 3–1 in a UEFA Conference League tie at Richmond Park, with Jake Mulraney scoring a brace and captain Joe Redmond heading home a third goal. A 2–2 draw away to Vaduz then set up a tie with Sabah of Azerbaijan, who Kenny&#x27;s side beat 1–0 at Tallaght Stadium before again winning 1–0 away at the Bank Respublika Arena. In the UEFA Conference League Play-Off Round, they faced Turkish side İstanbul Başakşehir, drawing 0–0 at Tallaght Stadium before narrowly being beaten 2–0 in the return leg at the Başakşehir Fatih Terim Stadium through 2 goals in the last 25 minutes while down to 10 men. On 8 October 2024, the club claimed its first trophy under Stephen Kenny when his second string side beat St Mochta&#x27;s 2–1 in the final of the 2023–24 Leinster Senior Cup. With the club in 8th place in the table going into their game on 1 September 2024, Kenny guided his side to a club record equalling 9 consecutive league victories to secure 3rd place at the end of his first season at the club, securing UEFA Conference League football for the following season.

On 4 February 2025, the club agreed the transfer of Mason Melia to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, commencing on 1 January 2026 for an undisclosed record transfer fee for a League of Ireland player, reported to be €2 million up front, rising to €4 million with add ons, plus a 20% sell on clause.

==Kits==

===Home kits===

The club&#x27;s first kit was a red shirt with a white collar and a white chevron, with white shorts and red socks. Since then they have changed to a kit of a red jersey with white sleeves, white shorts and red socks, rarely changing from this format.

===Away kits===


The most frequent away colours used by Pats are navy/blue but over the years they have ventured outside of the ordinary.

===Third kits===
The club have released some dedicated third kits in recent years, while in years that they haven&#x27;t, they&#x27;ve usually used the previous seasons away kit as a third kit.

===Kit manufacturers and sponsors===

==Fans==

Saints fans have widely become known as some of the most active and vocal throughout the country. Throughout the club&#x27;s history, any period of turmoil was always met with protest by the loyal saints. In 2001, an ultras group called the Shed End Invincibleswere set up, for four years they created huge tifo displays, choreographed chants and created Richmond Park into a fortress. After a period of exile, the ultras group were reignited under new leadership. Since then, their work has been applauded by other fans. Big banners, flares, and smoke screens are a common sight at St Pats matches. Overseas visitors are regularly found at Richmond Park on a match night, including a Norwegian Pats&#x27; supporters club. As well as this, the club&#x27;s supporters share friendships with supporters of clubs like such as Ravenna from Italy, Sheffield United of England, and Hannover 96 of Germany. Fans of these clubs, along with Pats fans, regularly travel to one another&#x27;s matches. Famous fans include former Irish manager Brian Kerr, American actor Wendell Pierce and ex-Ireland player Glenn Whelan.

==Community==

The club motto is &quot;Ní neart go cur le chéile&quot; (as Gaeilge). It translates to &quot;No strength without unity&quot;. St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic is strongly linked with Inchicore and the local southwest Dublin community. In 2020 the club used Richmond Park as a hub for a food bank to provide supplies to the vulnerable. Such is the club&#x27;s dedication to embedding itself in the community, they employ a full time Community Officer who runs a long list of programmes such as the educational Primary School Community Programme in local schools.

===Women&#x27;s Football===

In 1996 St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic F.C. took over the local women&#x27;s football team O&#x27;Connell Chics. The most notable former player is Emma Byrne who is the record appearance holder for the Republic of Ireland Women&#x27;s National Team, with the Saints being Byrne&#x27;s first senior club.

In 2022, club legend Ian Bermingham was appointed as Football Partnership Manager between St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic and Cherry Orchard and part of the partnership, the club will be progressing with their plans to field a team in the Women&#x27;s National U17 League from the 2023 season onwards.

==First-team squad==










===Out on loan===


==Technical staff==
==Youth structure==
The club field an Under-20, an Under-17, an Under-15 and an Under-14 team that compete in the League of Ireland U20 Division, League of Ireland U17 Division, League of Ireland U15 Division and League of Ireland U14 Division respectively.

===NUI Maynooth Scholarship Scheme===
Set up in 2010, St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic have a scholarship scheme in place with NUI Maynooth. The scheme allows Pats to offer young players the opportunity to play with the club&#x27;s Youth sides whilst undergoing their third-level studies on a sports scholarship. There is a big St Pats influence in the scheme with the Soccer Development Officer at Maynooth being former Pats defender Barry Prenderville as well as club captain Ger O&#x27;Brien managing the side to their first-ever Collingwood Cup win in 2014, with teammate Brendan Clarke as his assistant. The scholarship scheme is a big asset to St Pats, as it helps attract the top young talent in the country to the club ahead of their rivals. The scheme has also been a huge success, with the Saints Under-19s side winning the Dr. Tony O&#x27;Neill Cup in 2015 to become the best side in the country, as well as a whole host of players graduating from the Youth Setup into the First Team squad. Among the top players to have come through the Programme are Jake Carroll, Seán Hoare, Jamie McGrath, Darragh Markey, Ciaran Kelly, Paul Rooney and Fuad Sule among others.

===Youth Club Affiliations===
In 2016, the club opted to disband their own youth teams that played in the Dublin &amp; District Schoolboys Leagues, moving forward into a new model for the League of Ireland Under-19, Under-17 and up-and-coming Under-15s leagues. Pats struck up Affiliations with 4 of Ireland&#x27;s top schoolboy clubs Crumlin United, Belvedere, Cherry Orchard and Esker Celtic in the best interest of both clubs and their players/facilities. On 1 March 2016, the Saints announced an Affiliation Agreement with the local side Crumlin United, one of the country&#x27;s top schoolboy clubs, to improve Pats Youth Setup while also benefiting Crumlin and their young players. On 29 March 2017, the Saints announced an official partnership with Belvedere. On 24 May 2017 St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic announced an official partnership with local Ballyfermot side Cherry Orchard. On 13 July 2018 St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic announced an official partnership with Lucan side Esker Celtic.

====Cherry Orchard partnership====
In June 2022, it was announced that a new football partnership had been made between Pat&#x27;s and Cherry Orchard which would see the clubs work together exclusively, with the aim of the partnership to provide players from Cherry Orchard with a pathway to the academy and to senior League of Ireland football for both boys and girls, with Pat&#x27;s also creating a new full-time Football Partnership Manager role to oversee the partnership.

<text>Waterford Football Club formerly Waterford United Football Club is an Irish association football club based in Waterford who play in the League of Ireland Premier Division. The club was founded and elected to the league in 1930. Originally the club was based at the greyhound stadium known as Kilcohan Park, but moved to the Waterford Regional Sports Centre in the 1993–94 season. In 2018 the club and its players became fully professional.

== History ==

===Early years===

Waterford first participated in the league in the 1930–31 season finishing ninth and again from 1931 to 1932 before dropping out of the league for two seasons. Waterford re-entered the league in the 1935–36 season along with Sligo Rovers. Waterford won the Shield in their first season.

Waterford won the FAI cup for the first time in their history in 1937 beating St. James Gate and also won the Shield.

The club were league runners up in 1937–38 season and again in the 1940–41 season. Both Waterford and League winners Cork United finished on equal points but Cork were awarded the title as Waterford were unable to compete in the play-off due to a dispute regarding payment to players. At the end of the campaign, the original Waterford resigned from the League of Ireland, only for a new entity, with the same name, to be elected in, for 1944–45 season.
Waterford won the Shield again in the 1952–53 season and were again runners-up in the League this time to St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic in the 1954–55 season and again in the 1962–63 season.

The club eventually won the league title for the first time in the 1965–66 season, (under manager Paddy Coad) setting a then league record of 13 straight league victories. The 1965/66 title was the beginning of a hugely successful spell for the club domestically. The following season they played in the preliminary round of the Champions cup against Vorwärts Berlin, an East German and Army side, losing 6–1 at Dalymount Park and 6–0 in East Berlin.

They won the Shield once again in 1968–69 season. Waterford won the league title three times in a row, in 1968,1969 and in 1970. The title was won by Cork Hibernians in 1971 but returned to Waterford in the 1971–1972 season and again in the 1972–73 season. The following season Waterford won the League of Ireland Cup, however failed to regain the league title.

The Club won the FAI Cup for the second time under Tommy Jackson in 1980 beating St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic with the winner from Brian Gardner.

Waterford&#x27;s success in the league over the years brought European football where they played against famous clubs such as Manchester United and Celtic. Bobby Charlton had a brief spell at the club in 1976, playing three times and scoring one goal.

==Early 1980s to Mid-2010s==

In May 1982, the club changed its name to Waterford United. Alfie Hale was appointed manager. In 1985 the league&#x27;s membership rose to 22 clubs with the election of six new clubs in 1985. This resulted in the introduction of the present two-Division (Premier and First) structure in 1985/86 of which Waterford was a member of the Premier Division. Waterford were relegated to the First Division in the 1988–89 season. Their stay there was short, gaining promotion and winning the First Division title the following season 1989–90. They were unable to retain their Premier Division status the following season finishing in eleventh.

The club was promoted to the top flight in the 1991–92 season finishing as runners up to Limerick. But again the club were unable to remain in the Premier Division for more than a single season suffering relegation on goal difference to Drogheda United.

Waterford United were promoted to the Premier Division, finishing top of the First Division in the 1997–98 season and remained there until the 1999–00 season suffering relegation in the playoffs to Kilkenny City.

Jimmy McGeough was appointed manager in 2002. In his first season he led the club to promotion to the League of Ireland Premier Division in the 2002–03 season.

The League of Ireland changed from a winter league to a summer league for the 2003 season. Waterford finished 6th under Jimmy McGeough. Despite the good season he was controversially sacked, the decision was very unpopular with the club&#x27;s supporters.

In 2004, The Blues finished 5th and they reached the FAI Cup Final, their first since 1986 under Alan Reynolds as player-manager and Paul McGrath as director of football but lost 2–1 to Longford Town.

In 2006, Waterford United were relegated to the First Division. The FAI took over the running of the League of Ireland at the end of the 2006 season. Part of this takeover involved the assessment of all League of Ireland sides and the manner in which they were being run including finances, infrastructure, future plans, marketability and previous finishing positions since the 2002 season, (this was due to Kildare County only joining the Eircom League in 2002). Despite finishing in 11th and last place ( Dublin City being the 12th team in the league and subsequently folding during the season) the club were forced to play a relegation/promotion playoff against Dundalk. Despite being defeated Waterford United still stood a chance of remaining a Premier Division side due to the FAI assessment. However, on 8 December 2006 the FAI decided to relegate Waterford to the 1st Division with Shamrock Rovers and Galway United replacing them and the now defunct Dublin City. Dundalk, despite beating Waterford in a playoff, were controversially overlooked and remained in the First Division. However, on 20 February 2007 it was announced that Waterford United had been invited to participate in the Premier Division for the forthcoming season. Club secretary Larry Gough stated &quot;The club considered the proposal carefully and decided to accept the invitation in the best interests of football in Waterford and the eircom league&quot;. However, The &quot;Blues&quot; were relegated that season via the play-offs losing 6–3 on aggregate to Finn Harps.

After the club&#x27;s relegation, Waterford went into the 2008 season knowing that only one team from the First Division would be promoted as the FAI planned to revamp the league. A valiant effort from Cronin&#x27;s Blues saw them come so close yet so far as the &quot;Blues&quot; fell away towards the business end of the season leaving Dundalk and Shelbourne to compete for promotion on the final day of the season.

In 2009, former Bohemians player, Stephen Henderson took over as boss at the club and in his first season, the Blues narrowly missed out yet again for the playoffs and reached the EA Sports Cup Final where they were defeated 3–1 by Bohemians and the FAI Cup semi-finals. The club also finished in 4th in the League, missing out on the playoffs.

Henderson signed a one-year extension to his contract for the 2010 season. His side finished in 2nd place just three points off champions Derry City. His side came up against Monaghan United in the playoffs but were defeated 3–1 in the RSC.
In May 2011, Henderson was sacked after a run of poor form. Waterford native, Paul O&#x27;Brien was appointed manager for the duration of the season. Waterford United finished 5th in the 2011 League of Ireland First Division. The board in the off season then appointed Paul as full-time manager on a year contract for the 2012 season.

Paul O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s side fell narrowly short of promotion, they defeated champions Limerick four times in four games but still finished 4 points behind them. This meant the playoffs once again for Waterford. In the first section of the playoffs Waterford beat 3rd placed Longford Town 3–1 on aggregate. This set up a tie with Dundalk of the League of Ireland Premier Division. The first leg ended in a 2–2 draw in Oriel Park but Waterford were defeated 2–0 in the second leg at the RSC and would once again remain in the First Division.

The Blues were favourites to lift the Title in 2013 but during the season O&#x27;Brien resigned due to poor form. Waterford finished in 4th, missing out on the playoffs. During the 2013 season former manager Stephen Henderson was seeking compensation from his previous contract, Henderson claimed he was sacked despite the club claiming he resigned, the club&#x27;s supporters were forced to step in and raise the money Henderson was owed before the club could be wound up. Tommy Griffin was appointed manager for the 2014 season. The club encountered financial difficulties once again, this led to the club slipping down the table to a 7th-place finish.

After a disappointing start to 2015, Griffin stepped aside into a new role in the club and Roddy Collins was appointed as manager on a two-and-a-half-year deal. Collins side finished 7th in his first season. In the 2016 season, Collins signed a lot of players he worked with before such as Philip Gorman, James O&#x27;Brien and his son, Roddy Collins Jr, and many others. With two games left in the 2016 season and Waterford in 6th it was announced Roddy Collins would leave the club.

===Modern day===
After weeks of speculation on social media, the club officially announced in mid-November 2016 that Swindon Town chairman Lee Power had assumed control. Shortly after taking control, he outlined his plan to rebrand the club, removing &#x27;United&#x27; from the club&#x27;s name, going back to the original name of Waterford FC. He also wished to change the club&#x27;s crest and jersey to something more traditional. On 2 January 2017, the club announced the new managerial team for the coming season. The new head coach was former player and manager Alan Reynolds and Pat Fenlon was appointed as the club&#x27;s director of football. As the squad started to take shape, the club officially announced on 20 January 2017 that they would change back to the original Waterford FC name. They also unveiled the new crest which was a modernised version of the club&#x27;s first ever crest from 1930.
Under the new leadership, Waterford FC signed several high-profile players and ran the club in a new professional way.

After Waterford beat Wexford 3–0 and Cobh Ramblers were defeated 3–0 by Cabinteely, Waterford were officially crowned league champions and promoted back to the Premier Division for 2018.

Waterford qualified for the Europa League first qualifying round by finishing fourth in the 2018 League of Ireland Premier Division, but were ruled by UEFA to have not passed the &quot;three-year rule&quot; as the club were reformed in 2016. As a result, the berth was given to the fifth-placed team of the league, St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic.

Reynolds resigned as manager on 16 June 2020.

On 4 June 2021, with the club bottom of the table, it was announced that Lee Power had sold the club to R&amp;S Holdings Ltd, fronted by UK entrepreneur Richard Forrest who had bought the remaining stakes in the club having previously bought 33% earlier in the year.

The club finished 9th in the table in 2021, meaning they entered a relegation playoff. Then manager Marc Bircham was sacked just days before the relegation play-off with UCD AFC and the team subsequently lost the playoff 2–1, returning Waterford to the First Division.

On 14 June 2022, Waterford appointed Danny Searle as manager. Searle had previously been Aldershot Town manager. 

In August 2022, Andrew Pilley, then Fleetwood Town F.C. owner, bought out Richard Forrest to become the owner &amp; Chairman of Waterford F.C.

In March 2023, Searle was removed from his position just five games into the 2023 season. Two days later, former Bohemians manager Keith Long was appointed as Searle&#x27;s replacement.

In July 2023, the Waterford FC owner Andrew Pilley was sentenced to 13 years in prison in the UK. In November 2023, following a playoff with Cork City, Waterford FC earned promotion back to the Premier Division.

In May 2024, The Willows 96 Holdings Limited took over ownership of Waterford F.C. from Andrew Pilley. This holding company is 100% owned by Jamie Pilley, the son of the former owner.

The record attendance at the RSC was for an FAI Cup semi-final game in 1997 against Shelbourne where Waterford was defeated 2–1 in front of 8,500 people, this was when spectators were permitted to stand on the running track in the ground. The RSC also hosted the 2009 League of Ireland Cup final where Bohemians defeated Waterford 3–1. Before moving to the RSC Waterford played at Kilcohan Park.

==Supporters and rivalries==

===Supporters===

The club draws its support not only from Waterford City, but also from Waterford County and the South East region as a whole. Waterford fans have organised themselves into two groups – both official and unofficial.

===Groups===
Blues Supporter Club (B.S.C)

The Blues Supporters Club is the official Waterford FC fans group. It was formed in December 2009 after members of the IBSC (Independent Blues Supporters Club) voted to become an official fans group. From the 2010 season, the BSC organises transport for Blues fans to away games, run the club shop as well as organise numerous fund raising activities and other match day activities for Waterford FC. There is also a branch of the BSC based in Dungarvan that accommodates Blues fans living in West Waterford. Membership is now open for the 2018 season and information can be found on Waterford FC home page and on Facebook. The current chairperson of the BSC is Shane Murphy.
&quot;Ultras&quot;&quot;.

===Rivals===
Waterford contest the Munster Derby with Cork City. Waterford had big derbies with Cork City in the 2000s when Waterford were in the Premier Division and then again when Cork City Foras entered the First Division in the early 2010s. The derby with Cork always being Munsters biggest clash died off when Cork City started challenging the top of the table in the Premier Division and Waterford plummeted to the bottom end of the First Division around 2014. When Waterford drew Cork in the cups the club would usually be easily beaten. When Waterford played Cork in Turners Cross in the EA Sports Cup in 2016 they were beaten 7–0. However the rivalry was somewhat rekindled in 2017 after Waterford were taken over by Lee Power, a heavy challenge by Patrick McClean on Corks Sean Maguire caused controversy, it led to a huge dispute on social media between Waterford and Cork players with Irish internationals James McClean and Shane Duffy also getting involved defending Patrick&#x27;s tackle. And despite Waterford being in the First Division they manage to secure the signing of Waterford born Cork centre back Kenny Browne who was on the back of a great season where he starred for the rebels as they won the FAI Cup. The move caused huge controversy with Cork manager John Caulfield. As time went on Cork and Waterford played against each other a few times most recently when Waterford beat the in the Premier Division Promotion Playoff Final. 
Waterford have also had a local south east derby game against near neighbours Wexford since 2007 but there has never been any significant rivalry between the clubs.

Waterford had a big rivalry with Shamrock Rovers in the 1960s and 70s. The rivalry is referred to as the &#x27;old feud&#x27; in recent times.

<text>The Light of Things Hoped For is the second album by Christian rock band Brave Saint Saturn, released in 2003 (see 2003 in music).

The album is described as &quot;astro-rock&quot; and tells a story dealing with many personal struggles of the band members.

==Concept==

&quot;The Light of Things Hoped For&quot; chronicles the crew of the U.S.S. Gloria (Roper, Culp, Hoerig, Verdecchio) as they continue their study of the moons of Saturn. As the album begins, the crew has just received the command from Mission Control to return home. The mood quickly changes, however, as complications arise. Gases are emitted from the Gloria, sending the ship careening into the eclipse of Titan, Saturn&#x27;s largest moon. Communications cut out, and all seems to be lost. The crew reflects on what had happened and what they had lost, drawing the comparison of being away from the light of Christ. The album ends in a series of radio transmissions between the Gloria and Mission Control, and the U.S.S. Gloria emerges from the shadow of Titan and into the light, once again drawing the comparison between the Sun and Christ and the light He brings.

==Reception==

&quot;HM&quot; gave the album a positive review, saying it has a more serious focus than the band&#x27;s debut, and shows growth in vocal and musical depth as well. Allmusic called it &quot;a universe of soaring vocal harmonies and sugary pop hooks&quot;, praising the use of sound samples and the absence of preaching in the lyrics.

==Controversy==

Tooth and Nail edited two tracks on the album without the band&#x27;s permission. On the song &quot;Enamel&quot; a record scratch covers the end of the line &quot;When you hear this song, I hope it hurts like Hell.&quot; Edits on &quot;Heart Still Beats&quot; cover the word &quot;pissed&quot; and the line &quot;Go to hell.&quot;

Unedited versions of both tracks have been leaked to the internet. If the CD is ordered from Brave Saint Saturn&#x27;s online store, they will email the unedited songs to the purchaser.

The song &quot;Titan&quot; is introduced by a clip of the computer WOPR asking &quot;Shall we play a game?&quot; from the film &quot;WarGames&quot;.

The song &quot;Estrella&quot; was written by Reese Roper in his basement about his 25-year-old friend, Matt Estrella, who suffered from Neurofibromatosis 2 and died a year before the album came out.

<doc id="1233212" wikidata="Q30341" url="?curid=1233212" title="Zunyi Conference">
<text>The Zunyi Conference () was a meeting of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in January 1935 during the Long March. This meeting involved a power struggle between the leadership of Bo Gu and Otto Braun and the opposition led by Mao Zedong. The result was that Mao left the meeting in position to take over military command and become the leader of the Communist Party. The conference was completely unacknowledged until the 1950s and still no detailed descriptions were available until the fiftieth anniversary in 1985.

==Background==
In August 1934, with the Red Army depleted by the prolonged Chinese Civil War, a spy (Mo Xiong) placed by Zhou Enlai in the KMT army headquarters in Nanchang brought news that Chiang Kai-shek was preparing a major offensive against the Chinese Soviet Republic&#x27;s capital, Ruijin. The Communist leadership decided on a strategic retreat to regroup with other Communist units, and to avoid annihilation. The original plan was for the First Red Army to link up with the Second Red Army commanded by He Long, thought to be in Hubei to the west and north. Communications between divided groups of the Red Army had been disrupted by the Kuomintang campaign, and during the planning to evacuate Jiangxi, the First Red Army was unaware that these other Communist forces were also retreating westward.

Initially the First Red Army, with its baggage of top communist officials, records, currency reserves and other trapping of the exiled Chinese Soviet Republic, fought through several lightly defended Kuomintang checkpoints, crossing the Xinfeng River and through the province of Guangdong, south of Hunan and into Guangxi. At the Xiang river, Chiang Kai-shek had reinforced the KMT defenses. In two days of bloody fighting, 30 November to 1 December 1934, the Red Army lost more than 40,000 troops and all of the civilian porters, and there were strongly defended Nationalist defensive lines ahead. Personnel and material losses after the battle of the Xiang river affected the morale of the troops and desertions began. By a 12 December 1934 meeting of Party leaders in Tongdao, discontent with Bo Gu and Otto Braun appeared. Under these conditions, the Communists met in Zunyi to reshuffle the Party politburo.

==Meeting==
In January 1935, after the Red Army took over the city of Zunyi, a town of military importance in Guizhou, Southwest China, an enlarged meeting of the politburo of the CCP was held. For nearly fifty years, it was commonly thought to have been held from January 7–9, as related by a senior leader. Fei Peiru, a historian and former museum curator of Zunyi, is credited with establishing the currently accepted dates of January 15–17.

The names and numbers of participants in the conference have always been disputed. These details are of importance to the largely Soviet view that elected members of the party were outvoted by non-members. Those who are most strongly agreed to have attended by all are Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Liu Shaoqi, Zhang Wentian, Bo Gu, Liu Bocheng, Li Fuchun, Lin Biao, and Peng Dehuai. Chinese sources which show that non-members could not have outvoted members have the following participants:

* Politburo members: Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Zhang Wentian, Bo Gu.
* Alternate politburo members: Wang Jiaxiang; Liu Shaoqi; Deng Fa, the notorious boss of the secret police for the CCP; Kai Feng, aka He Kequan), leader of CY.
* Generals: Liu Bocheng, Chief of Staff of Red Army; Li Fuchun, acting director of political department of Red Army (acting General Commissar); Lin Biao, and commander of 1st Field Army; Peng Dehuai, commander of 3rd Field Army; Nie Rongzhen, Lin&#x27;s commissar; Yang Shangkun, Peng&#x27;s commissar and another member of 28 Bolsheviks; and Li Zhuoran.
* Secretariat and chief editor of the CCP newspaper, the &quot;Red Star&quot;, Deng Xiaoping.
* Otto Braun and his interpreter Wu Xiuquan.

Various scholars dispute the attendance of Chen Yun, Liu Shaoqi, Wang Jiaxiang, He Kequan, Deng Fa, Nie Rongzhen, and Deng Xiaoping. On the other hand, Liang Botai, Wu Liangping, Teng Daiyuan, Li Weihan, Wang Shoudao, and Yang Shangkun are also held to have attended by some sources.

==Conference agenda and speeches==

The main agenda of this conference was to examine the Party&#x27;s failure in the Jiangxi region and to look at the options now available to them. Bo Gu was the first to speak with a general report. He acknowledged that the strategy used in Jiangxi had failed without taking any blame. He claimed the lack of success was not due to poor planning. Next, Zhou gave a report on the military situation in an apologetic style. In contrast to Bo, he admitted mistakes had been made. Then, Zhang Wentian condemned the leaders for the debacle in Jiangxi in a long, critical oration, which was supported by Mao and Wang. Mao&#x27;s comparative distance from power over the past two years had left him blameless of the recent failures and in a strong position to attack the leadership.

Mao insisted that Bo Gu and Otto Braun had made fundamental military mistakes by using tactics of pure defense, rather than initiating a more mobile war. Mao&#x27;s supporters gained momentum during the meeting and Zhou Enlai eventually moved to back Mao. Under the principle of democracy for majority, the secretariat of the Central Committee and Central Revolution &amp; Military Committee of CCP were reelected. Bo and Braun were demoted while Zhou maintained his position now sharing military command with Zhu De. Zhang Wentian took Bo&#x27;s previous position, and Mao once again joined the Central Committee.

The Zunyi Conference confirmed that the CCP should turn away from the 28 Bolsheviks and towards Mao. The Red Army regained its military power, survived in Yan&#x27;an and ultimately defeated the KMT using a guerrilla strategy, and later through conventional warfare as it gained mass peasant support. It could be seen as a victory for those old CCP members who had their roots in China and, on the contrary, was a great loss for those CCP members such as the 28 Bolsheviks who had studied in Moscow and had been trained by the Comintern and the Soviet Union and could be regarded as protégés or agents of Comintern accordingly. After the Zunyi Conference, the influence and involvement of the Comintern in CCP affairs was greatly reduced.

<text>The Paschal [[homily]] or sermon (also known in Greek as Hieratikon or as the Catechetical Homily) of St. John Chrysostom (died 407) is read aloud at Paschal matins, the service that begins Easter, in Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches. According to the tradition of the Church, no one sits during the reading of the Paschal homily. Portions of it are often done with the interactive participation of the congregation.

== The Homily ==
Translation from the website of Cathedral of St. John the Baptist (Washington, D.C.)
If any be devout and God-loving, let him enjoy this fair and radiant triumph. If any be a good and wise servant, let him enter rejoicing into the joy of his Lord. If any be weary of fasting, let him now receive his reward. If any have labored from the first hour, let him receive today his rightful due. If any have come at the third hour, let him feast with thankfulness. If any have arrived at the sixth hour, let him in no wise be in doubt, for in no wise shall he suffer loss. If any be delayed even until the ninth hour, let him draw near, doubting nothing, fearing nothing. If any have tarried even until the eleventh hour, let him not be fearful on account of his lateness; for the Master, Who is jealous of His honor, receiveth the last even as the first. He giveth rest to him that cometh at the eleventh hour, as well as to him that hath labored from the first hour; and to the last He is merciful, and the first He pleaseth; to the one He giveth, and to the other He bestoweth; and He receiveth the works, and welcometh the intention; and the deed He honoureth, and the offering He praiseth. Wherefore, then, enter ye all into the joy of your Lord; both the first and the second, receive ye your reward. Ye rich and ye poor, with one another exult.

Ye sober and ye slothful, honor the day. Ye that have kept the fast and ye that have not, be glad today. The table is full-laden, delight ye all. The calf is fatted; let none go forth hungry. Let all enjoy the feast of faith, receive all ye the riches of goodness. Let no one bewail his poverty, for the universal kingdom hath been revealed. Let no one weep for his transgressions, for forgiveness hath dawned from the tomb. Let no one fear death, for the death of the Saviour hath set us free. He hath quench by it, He hath led hades captive, He Who descended into hades. He embittered it, when it tasted of His flesh. And foretelling this, Isaiah cried: &quot;Hades,&quot; he saith, &quot;was embittered when it encountered Thee below.&quot; It was embittered, for it was abolished. It was embittered, for it was mocked. It was embittered, for it was slain. It was embittered, for it was overthrown. It was embittered, for it was fettered. It received a body and encountered God. It received earth, and met heaven. It received that which it saw, and fell to what it did not see. O death, where is thy sting? O hades, where is thy victory?

Christ is risen, and thou art cast down.

Christ is risen, and the demons are fallen.

Christ is risen, and the angels rejoice.

Christ is risen, and life flourisheth.

Christ is risen, and there is none dead in the tombs.

For Christ, being risen from the dead, is become the first-fruits of them that have fallen asleep. To Him be glory and dominion unto the ages of ages. Amen.

<text>Heloise Ruth First OLG (4 May 1925 – 17 August 1982) was a South African anti-apartheid activist and scholar. She was assassinated in Mozambique, where she was working in exile, by a parcel bomb built by South African police.

==Family and education==
Ruth First&#x27;s Jewish parents, Julius First and Matilda Levetan, emigrated to South Africa from Latvia in 1906 and became founding members of the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA), the forerunner of the South African Communist Party (SACP). Ruth First was born in 1925 and brought up in Johannesburg. Like her parents, she joined the Communist Party, which was allied with the African National Congress in its struggle to overthrow the apartheid government of South Africa.

As a teenager, First attended Jeppe High School for Girls and then became the first person in her family to attend university. She received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of the Witwatersrand in 1946. While she was at university, she found that &quot;on a South African campus, the student issues that matter are national issues&quot;. She was involved in the founding of the Federation of Progressive Students, also known as the Progressive Students League, and got to know, among other fellow students, Nelson Mandela, future President of South Africa, and Eduardo Mondlane, the first leader of the Mozambique freedom movement FRELIMO.

After graduating, First worked as a research assistant for the Social Welfare Division of the Johannesburg City Council. In 1946, her position in the Communist Party was boosted significantly after a series of mine strikes during which leading members of the Party were arrested. First then became the editor-in-chief of the radical newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which was subsequently banned by the state. Through investigative journalism, First exposed the racial segregation policies known as apartheid, targeting black South Africans following the rise of the National Party in 1948.

In 1949, she married Joe Slovo, a South African anti-apartheid activist and Communist, with whom she had three daughters, Shawn, Gillian and Robyn. Together, Slovo and First became a leading force in the 1950s protest era in which the government outlawed any movements that opposed their policies.

In addition to her work with &quot;The Guardian&quot; and its successors, the South African Congress of Democrats (COD), a white-only wing of the Congress Alliance, was founded in 1953 with support from First. In 1955, she assumed the position of editor of a radical political journal called &quot;Fighting Talk&quot;. First and Slovo were also members of the African National Congress, in addition to the Communist Party. She also played an active role during the extensive riots of the 1950s.

==Treason trial and detention==
First was one of the defendants in the Treason Trial of 1956–1961, alongside 155 other leading anti-apartheid activists who were key figures in the Congress Alliance. First&#x27;s early work and writings were largely used as evidence to prove treason on behalf of the Congress Alliance.

Following four years of harassment by the state, First alongside the 155 other activists were all acquitted of their charges. After the state of emergency that followed the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, she was listed and banned. She could not attend meetings or publish, and she could not be quoted. In 1963, during another government crackdown, she was imprisoned and held in isolation without charge for 117 days under the Ninety-Day Detention Law. She was the first white woman to be detained under this law.

==Exile and assassination==

In March 1964, First went into exile in London, where she became active in the British Anti-Apartheid Movement. She was a Research Fellow at the University of Manchester in 1972, and between 1973 and 1978 she lectured in development studies at the University of Durham. She also spent periods on secondment at universities in Dar es Salaam and Lourenço Marques, Maputo.

In November 1978, First took up the post of director of research at the Centre of African Studies (Centro de Estudos Africanos), Universidade Eduardo Mondlane in Maputo, Mozambique. She was assassinated by the order of Craig Williamson, a major in the South African Police, on 17 August 1982, when she opened a parcel bomb that had been sent to the university. Bridget O&#x27;Laughlin, an anthropologist working with First, was in First&#x27;s office when she was murdered, and testified to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

==Memoirs==
First&#x27;s book, &quot;117 Days&quot;, is her account of her arrest, imprisonment and interrogation by the South African Police Special Branch in 1963. It was first published in 1965. The memoir provides a detailed account of how she endured &quot;isolation and sensory deprivation&quot; while withstanding &quot;pressure to provide information about her comrades to the Special Branch&quot;.
Her daughter, the writer Gillian Slovo, published her own memoir, &quot;Every Secret Thing: My Family, My Country&quot;, in 1997. It is an account of her childhood in South Africa and her relationship with her activist parents.

==Films==
The film &quot;A World Apart&quot; (1988), which has a screenplay by her daughter Shawn Slovo and was directed by Chris Menges, is a biographical story about a young white girl living in South Africa with anti-apartheid activist parents, although the family is called Roth in the film. Barbara Hershey plays the character based on Ruth First.

The 2006 film &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; about the activist Patrick Chamusso was written by Shawn Slovo, and in it First is portrayed by another daughter, Robyn Slovo, who was also one of the film&#x27;s producers.

==Patrol vessel==
In 2005, the South African Department of Environmental Affairs launched an environmental patrol vessel named Ruth First.

In March 2011, the country of The Gambia issued a postage stamp in her honour, naming her as one of the Legendary Heroes of Africa.

<doc id="1233229" wikidata="Q4656129" url="?curid=1233229" title="A Counterblaste to Tobacco">
<text>A Counterblaste to Tobacco is a treatise written by King James VI and I in 1604. In it he expresses his distaste for tobacco and tobacco-smoking. It is probably the earliest anti-smoking publication known.

==Style and content==
It is written in Early Modern English and refers to medical theories of the time (e.g. the four humours). In it James blames the Native Americans for bringing tobacco to Europe, complains about passive smoking, warns of dangers to the lungs, and decries tobacco&#x27;s odour as &quot;hatefull to the nose.&quot;

==Effects and legacy==
James&#x27;s dislike of tobacco led him in 1604 to authorise Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, to levy an excise tax and tariff of six shillings and eight pence per pound of tobacco imported, or £1 per three pounds, a large sum of money for the time. This would be £90 per pound in 2024, or £198 per kilogramme.

Because of the persistently high demand for tobacco in England and the negative effects on the economies of the American colonies, the king in 1624 instead created a royal monopoly for the crop. 150 years later the British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham would cite &quot;A Counterblaste to Tobacco&quot; as an example of antipathy run wild.

<doc id="1233247" wikidata="Q1191176" url="?curid=1233247" title="Uzumaki (film)">
<text>is a 2000 Japanese supernatural horror film based on the manga of the same name by Junji Ito. The feature film directorial debut of Higuchinsky, it stars Eriko Hatsune, Fhi Fan, Hinako Saeki and Shin Eun-kyung. The film takes place in a town plagued by a mysterious curse involving spirals. As the film was produced while the manga was still being written and released, it departs from the story of the original work and features a different ending.

The film was backed by the company Omega Micott, who released it in Japan on a double bill with &quot;&quot;, another film based on a manga by Ito. Simultaneously, &quot;Uzumaki&quot; received a limited release in the American city of San Francisco. It received mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
High school student Kirie Goshima&#x27;s first glimpse that something is awry in the small town of Kurouzu-cho comes when her boyfriend Shuichi Saito&#x27;s father begins to film the corkscrew patterns on a snail; he is also in the process of making a video scrapbook filled with the images of anything that has a spiral or vortex shape to it. His unusual obsession causes him to abandon his responsibilities at work; he proclaims that a spiral is the highest form of art, and frantically creates whirlpools in his miso soup when he runs out of spiral-patterned &quot;kamaboko&quot;. He then decides to film himself crawling into a washing machine, where he dies.

It is not long before the entire town is infected by the otherworldly spirals. Tamura, a reporter, is intrigued by Shuichi&#x27;s father&#x27;s suicide and becomes obsessed with the case. Meanwhile, Shuichi&#x27;s mother, who has been in hospital since her husband&#x27;s death, has developed a severe phobia of spirals. She cuts off her hair and fingertips due to their spiral-like shapes, and Shuichi tells the hospital staff to eliminate anything spiral-shaped so his mother may not encounter them. One night, after a millipede tries to crawl into her ear while she is asleep, the millipede claims to be her husband and turns into a spiral, driving her to commit suicide.

Meanwhile, at Kirie&#x27;s high school, a student named Katayama begins to walk at a snail&#x27;s pace, dripping in a slimy substance and only attending school on rainy days. He and other members of the student body gradually begin to sprout shells, drink water in copious amounts, and crawl on the walls of the school. Kirie&#x27;s classmate, Sekino, begins to grow her hair in exaggerated curls, taking over her mind and the minds of other female students. Whirl-like clouds appear in the sky, and during funerals, they are accompanied by smoky, ghost-like faces of victims who perished in spiral-related ways.

Eventually, the entire town succumbs to the curse of the spiral—Kirie&#x27;s father takes a drill to his eye after obsessively creating spiral-shaped ceramics; a news crew reporting on the phenomenon lose themselves in a tunnel, only to be later found as humanoid yet snail-like corpses; and Sekino&#x27;s snake-like curls grow to an abnormal height, wrapping around a telephone pole and cables electrocuting herself. A boy named Mitsuru, who is obsessed with Kirie, throws himself in front of Inspector Tamura&#x27;s car and is twisted around the axle; the car collides with a pole, causing Tamura&#x27;s head to hit the windshield, leaving a spiral-shaped crack. When Kirie and Shuichi decide to search for Kirie&#x27;s father, Shuichi&#x27;s body twists into a spiral-like contortion. He crawls towards Kirie, asking her to &quot;become a spiral too&quot;. Refusing to let Shuichi back to his side, Kirie flees, and her fate is left unknown.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Uzumaki&quot; is based on the manga &quot;Uzumaki&quot;, written and illustrated by Junji Ito. Ito had stated that for most of his stories, he starts with a visual image and builds a story around the picture. For &quot;Uzumaki&quot;, he had a different inspiration of wanting to make a manga about people who lived in a traditional Japanese row-house and seeing what happened. When drawing the row-houses, he found himself drawing a very long house that coiled into a spiral to fit on his page.

The film was the debut feature for director Akihiro Higuchi, under his alias of Higuchinsky. While filming the television series &quot;Eko Eko Azarak&quot;, director Higuchinsky met Kengo Kaji, to whom he proposed the idea of making a film. Higuchinsky stated that he originally wanted to make a film like &quot;Star Wars&quot; but realized that &quot;because I&#x27;m Japanese, I should do something different.&quot;

Higuchinsky had been reading a manga magazine compilation which contained Ito&#x27;s &quot;Uzumaki&quot;. Higuchinsky thought the manga was brilliant and asked Kengo Kaji to adapt the film, finding out that the manga was already in the process of being made into a film and that producers were looking for a director. Higuchinsky described the lure of &quot;Uzumaki&quot; using the Japanese word &quot;kikai&quot;, which translates to &quot;strange and mysterious things (or people)&quot;, and that &quot;the allure of &quot;Uzumaki&quot; is not that the uzumaki itself is scary but rather the changes in the people caught up in it. &quot; The original production of the film was going to be an independent production and would be part of an anthology film, but during production, Toei Animation decided to have it become a bigger film. The film was backed by Toyoyuki Yokohama&#x27;s Omega Project, a company that married Japanese and foreign funding to make J-horror films for an international market. The company had previously had success with the 1999 film &quot;Audition&quot;.

===Production===
Higuchinsky desired to be faithful to the manga as possible. At the time, the manga had not been completed yet. 
To help his crew express a Japanese style in the film, he had his staff watch &quot;Akuma no temari uta&quot;. The film was primarily shot in Ueda, Nagano Prefecture, with a few locations in Tokyo. Higuchinsky said the film was shot in about two weeks.

==Promotion and release==
&quot;Uzumaki&quot; was released in Japan on 11 February 2000. It was released as the first half of a double bill with &quot;&quot;, a film based on the manga &quot;Tomie&quot;, also by Ito. The film was released concurrently in the United States as it was in Japan with a limited run in San Francisco. Omega&#x27;s vice-president Akiko Funatsu stated that San Francisco was chosen due to &quot;all the internet activity there&quot;. Based on grosses from Japan&#x27;s nine key cities, the films opened in 14th place for the week.

The film was shown at the 2000 Fantasia Film Festival.

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 61% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 6.30/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Uzumaki&quot; uses its creepy, David Lynch-inspired atmospherics to effectively build a sense of dread, but ultimately fails to do anything with it.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 62 out of 100 based on nine critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In his review of the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Elvis Mitchell noted the way the film develops mood, finding it part of the cycle of Japanese films like Kiyoshi Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Cure&quot; and Hideo Nakata&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; as &quot;vivid, state-of-the-art scare films that move so swiftly that psychological underpinnings are a luxury&quot;. Mitchell concluded that in the film that &quot;things really get weird, though not particularly scary&quot;, calling the film &quot;ultimately disappointing&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Dennis Harvey described the film as &quot;intriguing, if ultimately unsatisfying&quot;, and criticized a perceived lack of atmosphere between set pieces, along with its &quot;typically bland, schoolgirlish heroine.&quot; Kim Morgan of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; described the film as &quot;beautiful, cold, oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly&quot;; she wrote that it contains &quot;many creatively terrifying and effectively gross sequences that stand on their own beautifully&quot;, but lamented that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t flow into a consistent building of terror&quot;.

Ross Williams of Film Threat praised the film&#x27;s sound design and &quot;cheesy, yet at the same time impressive and effective&quot; special effects, writing: &quot;While not as effectively creepy as &quot;The Ring&quot;, [&quot;Uzumaki&quot;] undoubtedly deserves to be watched&quot;. Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted the style of the film, opining that kinetic shooting style doesn&#x27;t pause for anything; like a lot of music-video and commercial directors, his achievement is better considered shot-by-shot than as a whole.&quot; AllMovie&#x27;s Josh Ralske gave the film a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it &quot;visually imaginative and engagingly offbeat horror film, but its willful goofiness and unresolved story line doesn&#x27;t offer much in the way of psychological resonance.&quot;

Higuchinsky stated that, since the film&#x27;s release, he has received fan mail from Europe, which made him particularly happy as it was his &quot;dream to use film as a way to overcome national borders and have my movies watched by people all over the world. I think that these fans focus not on the story but on the simple images, they sense something through the visuals.&quot;

<text>Hersham and Walton Motors (HWM) is the world&#x27;s longest established Aston Martin business, having acquired the franchise in 1951. As a racing car constructor, HWM competed in Formula One and Formula Two, and in sports car racing.

==Motor racing==
Hersham and Walton Motors was founded in 1938 by John Heath, an excellent race driver and talented engineer. Heath was joined by George Abecassis in 1946. Together, they moved the business into a building based on New Zealand Avenue in Walton on Thames which was previously used by Vickers during the war as part of their aircraft construction facility.

George Abecassis and John Heath went racing together from 1946 and in 1948 they built a streamlined sports racing car on the chassis of a Sports Alta, and thus embarked upon the construction of racing cars and racing sports cars at the Walton-on-Thames works. The 1948 car gave them encouraging results and so new car, this time called an HW-Alta, was constructed and raced in 1949; this car was sufficiently successful to convince the partners to embark upon building a full team of cars for the 1950 Formula Two season of British and continental events: these cars were known as HWMs.

They were the first British team to find international success after WW2 which is almost forgotten. The operated with a very limited budget from their little garage in Walton-on-Thames. Over HWM&#x27;s seven-year life as a racing car manufacturer less than two dozen were built, but some 70 per cent of the entire production survives today.
The HWM leadership had a skill for spotting young talent. There is a remarkable list of drivers that raced for the team including Duncan Hamilton, Peter Collins, Harry Schell, Lance Macklin and Paul Frère. This list is far from exhaustive but perhaps the most famous name was that of Stirling Moss. Before driving for HWM, Stirling was a privateer racing a Cooper. He was offered his first professional drive at HWM and went on to race for the team for nearly two years. His talent helped the team to gain results that were beyond expectation.

The HWM&#x27;s four-cylinder Alta engine lacked the power of most of its rivals, but its all-independent chassis handled well, and Stirling&#x27;s budding genius exploited it to the full. He finished third at Reims behind Ascari&#x27;s Ferrari and Simon&#x27;s Gordini, and, unbelievably, third in the F1 race at Bari behind the 159 Alfas of Farina and Fangio. He set fastest lap in the Rome Grand Prix chasing the F2 Ferraris of Ascari and Villoresi, and was leading the Naples Grand Prix when he was pushed off into a tree by a backmarker. Johnny Claes, meanwhile, scored the first post-war win by a British car in a race titled as a Grand Prix when he won the Belgian Grand Prix des Frontières at Chimay, while Lance Macklin was sixth in the German Grand Prix and Rudi Fischer was sixth at Berne.

In between, there were blown engines to rebuild and bent cars to repair, the hard-pressed transporters frequently broke down, one of the racers caught fire the night before a race, and one of the mechanics, plus car and van, got lost in the middle of Italy, without money and unable to speak a word of Italian. But the team made it to the end of the season, and with good enough results to have built a substantial reputation across Europe. Most important of all, once the three cars were sold off after the last race, there was a small profit to show for all that toil.

Of those three 1950 works cars, one has remained in its Alta-engined form. Another was given a Jaguar XK120 engine by its new owner Oscar Moore, becoming the first in a long line of Jaguar-powered specialist sports-racers. And the third ended up in Hollywood, starring in a movie with Kirk Douglas, before gaining a Chevrolet V8 engine and going on to a second racing career on the USA&#x27;s West Coast as the Stovebolt Special. All three now live with enthusiastic owners in England.
From 1950 to 1952, HWM achieved remarkable success in Formula Two for a team that was run on very little money and yet which faced the might of continental marques in every race. By 1953 they were outclassed, but when the international Formula changed in 1954, John Heath constructed a works car to compete in Formula One. Right from the first event, the non-championship Lavant Cup at Goodwood, the new car proved to be off the pace. It retired from the BRDC International Trophy and then came its World Championship debut at the French Grand Prix at Reims-Gueux. Macklin qualified a whole 23 seconds behind Juan Manuel Fangio and was running last when the engine failed. With that, HWM abandoned their Formula One programme.

Meanwhile, the first Jaguar-engined HWM sports racing car had appeared in 1953, and this had some success with Abecassis at the wheel. From then on until 1957, the team was involved in sports car racing both in Britain and on the continent, sometimes beating their Jaguar and Aston Martin Works competitors. After John Heath was killed on the 1956 Mille Miglia in Italy in an HWM Works car, Abecassis did not wish to continue and the works racing programme continued for just a year.

==Motor trade==
In 1950 George Abecassis had won his class at Le Mans in an Aston Martin DB2 with co-driver Lance Macklin. This cemented George&#x27;s relationship with Aston Martin and the following year HWM was awarded the Aston Martin franchise. It remains an Aston Martin dealership to this day. Having been extremely impressed by Lance Macklin&#x27;s driving performance at Le Mans, George also secured Lance for the HWM team. Lance went on to be one HWM&#x27;s most loyal drivers.

In 1958, Mike Harting arrived at HWM as a partner to George Abecassis. He had previously been the global sales manager for Aston Martin at their Feltham facility five miles away from the Walton dealership.

One of those contacts was George Abecassis. George had been running the business on his own since the death of John Heath but was keeping an eye out for a suitable partner. As an Aston Martin Works racing driver, George had struck up a relationship with Mike Harting. It became apparent that there was potential to work together. Mike wanted a career that required him to travel less and therefore see more of his family. The HWM business looked like an attractive option so the deal was agreed and they joined forces.

Eventually when George retired, Mike took ownership of the whole of the HWM business and continued at the helm, later joined by his son Andrew, through the rest of his life. 

HWM is today owned by Andrew Harting and the Harting family along with Guy Jenner. HWM trades as HWM Aston Martin and HWM Sports Cars and is an Aston Martin and Sports Cars dealership. It is the oldest Aston Martin dealership in the world.

<text>René Marqués (October 4, 1919 – March 22, 1979) was a Puerto Rican short story writer and playwright.

==Early years==
Marqués was born, raised and educated in the city of Arecibo. He developed an interest in writing at a young age and was politically keen to support independence for the non-sovereign nation of Puerto Rico.

In the 1940s, Marqués wrote what is considered to be his best play, &quot;La Carreta&quot; (The Oxcart). In 1953, it opened in New York City. In 1954, it opened in San Juan and helped secure his reputation as a leading literary figure. The drama traces a rural Puerto Rican family as it moved to the slums of San Juan and then to New York in search of a better life, only to be disillusioned and to long for their island.

==The Generation of the 50s==
René Marqués was a figure of what was known in Puerto Rico as &quot;La generación del 50&quot; (The Generation of the 50s). This was an artistic and literary group of Puerto Rican intellectuals which included Francisco Matos Paoli, Francisco Arriví, Abelardo Díaz Alfaro and Lorenzo Homar. In 1950, together with the other members of the group, Marqués worked for the Division of Community Education of Puerto Rico. Marqués however, did often come into conflict with Luis Muñoz Marín. He believed in complete Puerto Rican sovereignty and he often criticized Muñoz Marín, when he became governor, because of his acceptance of U.S. sovereignty over Puerto Rico.

In 1954, Puerto Rican director, Roberto Rodríguez, produced &quot;La Carreta&quot;, the play opened at the Church of San Sebastian, located in Manhattan, New York. The success of the play motivated Míriam Colón and Rodríguez to form the first Latino theater group with its own 60-seat theater, called &quot;El Círculo Dramatico&quot; (The Dramatic Circle).

In 1955, Marqués wrote one of his later works, &quot;Juan Bobo y la Señora Occidental&quot; (Juan Bobo and the Occidental Lady).

In 1958 Victoria Espinosa directed Marques&#x27; &quot;Los soles truncos (The Half-Suns)&quot; at the First Puerto Rican Theatre Festival. This collaboration was a success and Espinosa was the only person to direct that play for the following thirty years.

In 1959, Marqués published three plays together in the collection &quot;Teatro&quot; (Theater). These were &quot;La Muerte no entrará en Palacio&quot; (Death will not enter the Palace), &quot;Un Niño Azul para esa Sombra&quot; (A Blue Boy for that Shadow) and &quot;Los Soles Truncos&quot;. In an essay (1960), which the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party published as a pamphlet, Marqués addressed the problem of the language of instruction in Puerto Rico&#x27;s colonial situation. He concluded that only the enjoyment of complete national sovereignty will cleanse the pedagogical problem of all extra-pedagogical baggage.

==Later years==
In 1965, George Edgar and Stella Holt produced the English version of Marqués&#x27; &quot;The Oxcart&quot; Off-Broadway, with Míriam Colón in the lead role.

René Marqués died in San Juan, Puerto Rico on March 22, 1979, at age 59. Puerto Rico has named a school in his honor and in the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center in San Juan there is a 760-seat René Marqués Theater.

McCallum, born in Tiree, Argyllshire, Scotland, was a contractor and shipowner before entering politics as a Liberal-Conservative. He represented the riding of Monck in the House of Commons of Canada from 1867 to 1872, when he was defeated by James David Edgar. However, in 1874, McCallum defeated Edgar by a margin of just 34 votes, and was returned to Parliament.

Due to the closeness of the result, McCallum was unseated on May 12, 1875. In the subsequent byelection, McCallum again defeated Edgar, this time by a mere 4 votes.

McCallum was an unsuccessful candidate for a seat in assembly for the Province of Canada in 1863. He was also a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario having been elected in the 1871 election in the riding of Monck. He was a member of the Ontario Conservative Party.

He served as reeve for the United Townships of Sherbrooke and Moulton in Ontario.

McCallum remained in the House until 1887, when he was appointed to the Senate; he served in the Senate until his death at the age of 79.

McCallum was the founder and Naval Captain (Colonel) of the Dunnville Naval Brigade 1861–1866. During the Fenian Raid he commanded the &#x27;war tug&#x27; W.T. Robb and fought with his men against the Fenians in Fort Erie on the afternoon of June 2. Outnumbered 10 to 1, McCallum and sixteen other men fought their way out of Fort Erie before being rescued by the Robb.

McCallum lived in Stromness, Ontario. In 1854, he married Priscilla Dawson Thewliss. He died in office in Stromness in 1903.
