<text>The Ganges shark (Glyphis gangeticus) is a critically endangered species of requiem shark found in the Ganges River (Padma River) and the Brahmaputra River of India and Bangladesh. It is often confused with the more common bull shark (&quot;Carcharhinus leucas&quot;), which also inhabits the Ganges River and is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the Ganges shark. The genus is currently considered to contain three recent species; genetic evidence has shown that both the Borneo river shark (&quot;G. fowlerae&quot;) and Irrawaddy river shark (&quot;G. siamensis&quot;) should be regarded as synonyms of the Ganges shark, expanding the range of the species to Pakistan, Myanmar, Borneo, and Java. The species remains poorly known and very rare.

==Taxonomy==
Formerly the Borneo river shark (&quot;Glyphis fowlerae&quot;) and the Irrawaddy river shark (&quot;Glyphis siamensis&quot;) were considered to represent two other species in the genus &quot;Glyphis&quot;. They have recently been reclassified as &quot;G. gangeticus&quot; based on genetic studies, and their scientific names are treated as synonyms.

The Borneo river shark is known only from the Kinabatangan River in Borneo. It can reach a length of . Only 13 specimens are known to science, all collected in 1996. Expeditions in 2010 and 2011 failed to find any, and while fishermen recognised the shark, they have not been seen for many years.

The Irrawaddy river shark is known only from a single museum specimen originally caught at the mouth of the Irrawaddy River in Myanmar, a brackish-water locality in a large, heavily silt-laden river lined with mangrove forests. It was collected in the 19th century and described as &quot;Carcharias siamensis&quot; by Austrian ichthyologist Franz Steindachner, in &quot;Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien&quot; (volume 11, 1896). However, subsequent authors doubted the validity of this species, regarding it as an abnormal bull shark (&quot;Carcharhinus leucas&quot;), until in 2005 shark systematist Leonard Compagno recognized it as distinct member of the genus &quot;Glyphis&quot;. The specimen is a 60-cm-long immature male. It closely resembles the Ganges shark, but has more vertebrae (209 versus 169) and fewer teeth (29/29 versus 32–37/31–34).

A possibly undescribed species of &quot;Glyphis&quot; is known from Mukah in Borneo, as well as Bangladesh. The status of a Borneo specimen from Sampit remains unclear.

==Physical appearance==
&quot;G. gangeticus&quot; is a little-known species that is yet to be adequately described. Its size at birth is , growing to an estimated at maturity, with a maximum size of about . The size at birth or maturity is unknown for any other &quot;Glyphis&quot; species.

A typical requiem shark in its external appearance, it is stocky, with two spineless dorsal fins and an anal fin. The first dorsal fin originates over the last third of the pectoral fins, with a free rear tip that is well in front of the pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is relatively large, but much smaller than the first (about half the height). The anal fin is slightly smaller than the second dorsal fin and the pectoral fins are broad. A longitudinal upper precaudal pit is seen, but no interdorsal ridge. It is uniformly grey to brownish in color, with no discernible markings.

Its snout is broadly rounded and much shorter than the width of its mouth. The mouth is long, broad, and extends back and up towards the eyes.

Its eyes are minute, suggesting that it may be adapted to turbid water with poor visibility, such as occurs in the Ganges River and the Bay of Bengal. It has internal nictitating eyelids.

The upper teeth have high, broad, serrated, triangular cusps and the labial furrows are very short. The lower front teeth have long, hooked, protruding cusps with unserrated cutting edges along the entire cusp, but without spear-like tips and with low cusplets on feet of crowns. The tooth row counts are 32–37/31–34.

=== Diagnostic features ===
&quot;G. gangeticus&quot; can be identified by the first few lower front teeth, which have cutting edges along entire cusp, giving the cusps a claw-like shape, and low cusplets. Also, a second dorsal fin that is about half the height of first dorsal is distinct to this species.

==Distribution==
The Ganges shark, as its name suggests, is largely restricted to the rivers of eastern and northeastern India, particularly the Hooghly River of West Bengal, and the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Mahanadi in Bihar, Assam, and Odisha, respectively. It is typically found in the middle to lower reaches of a river. One found in 2018 in a Mumbai fish market may have come from somewhere along the banks of the Arabian Sea.

In theory, &quot;G. gangeticus&quot; could occur in shallow marine estuaries; however, no marine records of the species have been verified to date. Originally, the species was assigned a wide range in the Indo-West Pacific, but this was found to be mostly based on other species of requiem sharks, particularly members of the genus &quot;Carcharhinus&quot;.

Most literature records and specimens labelled as this species are in fact bull sharks (&quot;Carcharhinus leucas&quot;) or other carcharhinid species. An extensive 10-year search produced only a few specimens, caught in 1996 in the Ganges River.

==Habitat and ecology==
&quot;G. gangeticus&quot; is known to inhabit only freshwater, inshore marine, and estuarine systems in the lower reaches of the Ganges-Hooghly River system. Their feeding habits are mostly unknown. The shark&#x27;s small eyes and slender teeth suggest that it is primarily a fish-eater and is adapted to turbid water. With such limited visibility typical of many tropical rivers and estuaries, other senses − such as hearing, smell, and electroreception − are likely used for predation. Because its eyes are tilted towards its back rather than to the sides or bottom (as is the case in most carcharhinids), the shark may swim along the bottom and scan the water above it for potential prey back-lit by the sun. However, in the Bay of Bengal, &quot;G. gangeticus&quot; was found to feed heavily on dasyatid stingrays, which spend much of their time on the bottom.

=== Reproduction ===
It is probably viviparous, with a yolk-sac placenta (speculation through analogy to related species of carcharhinids). The litter size and gestation period are unknown. However, their life history cycle is probably similar to other river sharks, characterized by long gestation, slow growth, delayed maturity, and small litter size. These factors make the Ganges shark populations vulnerable to even relatively low levels of exploitation, such as sport angling or gill netting.

=== Possibility of migration ===
Some researchers consider &quot;G. gangeticus&quot; to be amphidromous, covering more than in both directions. However, this is not thought to be for breeding, as the case in anadromous and catadromous species. The presence of newborn individuals in the Hooghly River suggests that the young may be born in fresh water.

A specimen photographed in 2011 by natural history journalist Malaka Rodrigo at Negombo fish market in Sri Lanka prompted researcher Rex de Silva to speculate on whether the species could occasionally be carried south of its normal range by ocean currents. However, only the head of the shark appears in the photo. Leading shark expert Leonard Compagno emphasised the need to check the dentition and the dorsal fin proportions to confirm the specimen as &quot;G. gangeticus&quot;, stating that it could also be one of the four other named species.

=== Specimens ===
&quot;G. gangeticus&quot; was originally known only from three 19th-century museum specimens, one each in the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, Natural History Museum, Berlin in Berlin, and the Zoological Survey of India in Calcutta. No records exist between 1867 and 1996, and the 1996 records have not been confirmed as &quot;G. gangeticus&quot;. A specimen collected upstream of the mouth of the Hooghly River at Mahishadal in 2001 was identified as &quot;G. gangeticus&quot;, but on photographs of the jaw only. If &quot;Carcharias murrayi&quot; (Günter, 1887) can be considered a junior synonym of this species, one was found near Karachi, Pakistan. However, the holotype was apparently lost or misplaced in the British Museum of Natural History.

One female specimen was recorded at Sassoon Docks in Mumbai, India in February 2016, measuring total length. It was caught in the Arabian Sea.

=== Molecular biology ===
&quot;Glyphis&quot; species, like other sharks, exhibit a very slow rate of genetic change. This makes them even more vulnerable to becoming extinct, as they are unable to adapt to the rapid and extreme changes caused by humans to their environment.

As only a few specimens exist, naturally little material available is for genetic sampling. However, two websites list records for &quot;G. gangeticus&quot;:

The Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLDS) Stats website lists one record:
Public Records: 0
Specimens with Barcodes: 1
Species With Barcodes: 1

The NCBI Taxonomy database has one record of mitochondrial genetic material (1,044 base pairs of linear DNA):
&quot;Glyphis gangeticus&quot; bio-material GN2669, reported in a 2012 paper on DNA sequencing in shark and ray species.

==Conservation==
&quot;G. gangeticus&quot; is one of 20 sharks on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List of endangered shark species. The species is currently classified as critically endangered. According to the organisation, fewer than 250 Ganges sharks are believed to exist. The need is urgent for a detailed survey of the shark fisheries of the Bay of Bengal.

=== Major threats ===
River sharks are thought to be particularly vulnerable to habitat changes. The Ganges shark is restricted to a very narrow band of habitat that is heavily affected by human activity. Overfishing, habitat degradation from pollution, increasing river use, and management including the construction of dams and barrages, are the principal threats. Thought to be consumed locally for its meat, the Ganges shark is caught by gillnet, and its oil, along with that of the South Asian river dolphin, is highly sought after as a fish attractant. It is also believed to be part of the Asian shark fin trade. After a sighting in 2006, the species was not seen again for over a decade until one was found at a Mumbai fish market in 2016.

The single Irrawaddy river shark specimen stems from an area of intensive artisanal fishing, mainly gillnetting, but also line and electrofishing. Habitat degradation may pose a further threat to this shark, including water pollution and the clearing of mangrove trees for fuel, construction materials, and other products. The shark may be naturally rare in this area and highly restricted in its range. Despite fishing and scientific surveys in the area, no more Irrawaddy river sharks have been recorded in the 100-plus years since the first.

=== Conservation actions ===
In 2001, the Indian government banned the landing of all species of chondrichthyan fish in its ports. However, shortly afterwards, this ban was amended to cover only 10 species of chondrichthyans. These, including &quot;G. gangeticus&quot;, are protected under Schedule I, Part II A of the Wildlife Protection Act of India. Doubt exists about the effectiveness of this measure, however, because of difficulties in enforcement. A widespread, albeit widely dispersed, artisanal fishery exists for both local consumption and international trade. Compagno (1997) recommends an in-depth survey of fishing camps and landing sites, along with a sampling program in the Ganges system to determine the current status of this shark along with other Gangetic elasmobranchs such as stingrays and sawfish.

==Human interaction==
The Ganges shark is widely feared as a ferocious man-eater, but most of the attacks attributed to it are probably the result of confusion with the bull shark &quot;Carcharhinus leucas&quot;. This is likely because bull sharks are known to travel long distances into freshwater systems and may co-exist in the same waters as the Ganges shark. Since little is known about the behaviour of genuine freshwater river sharks, and since &quot;G. gangeticus&quot; is critically endangered, contact with humans is very rare. There has been one attack which might be attributable to the Ganges shark, this attack happened in 1868 and was attributed to the shark by Joseph Fayrer.

The biological differences between the Ganges shark and bull shark also point to a lower likelihood of attacks on humans by the Ganges shark. &quot;G. gangeticus&quot; has much narrower, higher, upper teeth and slender-cusped, less heavily built lower teeth than &quot;C. leucas&quot;. Such small sharp teeth are more suitable for fish-impaling, and less useful for dismembering tough mammalian prey than the stout teeth of the bull shark.

<doc id="1232571" wikidata="Q2488301" url="?curid=1232571" title="Taconic State Parkway">
<text>The Taconic State Parkway (often called the Taconic or the TSP) is a limited-access parkway between Kensico Dam and Chatham, the longest in the U.S. state of New York. It follows a generally north–south route midway between the Hudson River and the Connecticut and Massachusetts state lines, much of its upper section along the westernmost flank of the Taconic Mountains. It is open only to passenger vehicles, as with other parkways in New York, and maintained by the state Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), the fourth agency to have that responsibility.

Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had long envisioned a scenic road through the eastern Hudson Valley, was instrumental in making it a reality as a way to provide access to existing and planned state parks in the region. Its winding, hilly route was designed by landscape architect Gilmore Clarke to offer scenic vistas of the Hudson Highlands, Catskills and Taconic regions. The bridges and now-closed service areas were designed to be aesthetically pleasing. It has been praised for the beauty of not only the surrounding landscape and views it offers, but the way the road itself integrates with and presents them.

It was completed in its present form in the early 1960s. In 2005, the entire highway, including its supporting structures, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its historic importance in the development of parkways in the 20th century, and Roosevelt&#x27;s role in creating it. It is the second-longest continuous road listed on the Register after Virginia&#x27;s Skyline Drive, and the longest limited-access highway.

The parkway continues to provide access to several state parks, including Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park. It has also become an important regional artery, one of the primary routes to northern New England and the Capital Region of New York from the Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island. The southern sections, particularly in Westchester County, have become a commuter route into the city for residents who moved into towns that became suburbanized as a result of the parkway. The state and regional transportation planners have worked to adapt to this change since the 1940s.

==Route description==

The Taconic&#x27;s character changes with its surroundings. In the busy suburbs of its first few miles, it is a narrow at-grade roadway, paralleling a commuter rail line through a small downtown. Soon after that, it becomes a wide divided highway, with median strips and gentle turn radii similar to an Interstate Highway carrying much commuter traffic.

In the Hudson Highlands, it narrows again as it curves back and forth and climbs up and down quickly to its highest point. When the terrain levels out again, it widens and begins to assume its scenic character in a growing, exurban area with at-grade intersections. Its northernmost section, located on the ridges between the Hudson Valley and the Taconic Mountains along the state borders to the east, offers mountain and hilltop vistas as the road itself continues to curve gently through bucolic surroundings. This winding route contributes to its length, which makes the Taconic New York State&#x27;s longest parkway.

===Westchester County===
The Taconic begins at Kensico Circle, just south of Kensico Dam, in the town of North Castle, also the northern terminus of the Bronx River Parkway. The roadway here is a narrow, four-lane expressway. It curves northwest to a traffic light at Cleveland Street in the hamlet of Valhalla. The Valhalla station on Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line is on the west side, with the downtown area on the east. It is the only densely developed community the road goes through rather than near.

After crossing under the stone arch bridge carrying Legion Drive over the parkway, the first of many such rustic overpasses, the Taconic begins a long section going past Gate of Heaven Cemetery and paralleling the railroad tracks past the small Mount Pleasant Metro-North train station, built to allow access to the surrounding cemetery of that name. The road then becomes a four-lane freeway and crosses over the train line into a wooded area where the two roadways split wide apart, merging with the Sprain Brook Parkway.

At the merge, the Taconic continues north as a wider, six-lane freeway. For the remainder of Westchester County, the Taconic has been rebuilt, widened, and modernized to meet the needs of commuter growth, bearing little resemblance to its original design. A thousand feet () to the north, after a small interchange with NY 141, a three-level stack interchange allows access to the Saw Mill River Parkway northbound (and southbound from the southbound lanes). North of the interchange power lines and Saw Mill River Road (New York State Route 9A or NY 9A and NY 100) on the west parallel the parkway past undeveloped Graham Hills County Park. The next exit, at Bedford Road (NY 117), serves Pleasantville to the east. Just north of it, a short fork allows traffic to divert to NY 9A and 100, which split away toward Ossining.

The Taconic continues north through a minimally developed area of low hills, past another exit serving Pleasantville, and then across another town line into New Castle. Route 100 returns to parallel the highway on the west again, then joins NY 133 at the next exit, serving Ossining and Millwood. About a half mile () north of that exit, northbound traffic can also exit, and southbound traffic enters, at Pines Bridge Road.

The roadways grow far apart over the next mile before coming together again at the NY 134 exit, as Turkey Mountain, one of the Manhattan Hills, looms ahead. The Taconic then enters Yorktown, the last town along the Taconic in Westchester County, and split again until they are apart, with neighborhoods and houses between them, to the two bridges over New Croton Reservoir, part of the New York City water supply system. Once on the other side, in the town of Yorktown, they converge again to their previous width. The next exit, at Underhill Avenue, provides access to downtown Yorktown and the reservoir.

Past the Baldwin Road exit a half mile () north of Underhill, the Taconic curves westward along the south side of Mohansic Lake. When the road returns to a northerly course, an exit allows entrance to Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park. It is followed by the Crompond Road (U.S. Route 202 or US 202 and NY 35) exit, which serves Peekskill to the west as well as Yorktown. Just beyond it, the Bear Mountain State Parkway, a legacy of the Taconic&#x27;s original planned route and purpose, leaves to the west as the road drops into a wide valley carved by a tributary of the Hudson, the first place where the road begins to respond to the increasing relief of the landscape.

The Taconic then passes through undeveloped woods, part of another local park, and under a footbridge carrying a hiking trail. Curving northeast, the exits for NY 132 and US 6 (recently improved), with residences on either side of the parkway, herald Shrub Oak and Jefferson Valley. A short distance past that exit, the parkway crosses into Putnam County.

===Putnam County===

The road narrows shortly after the county line in the town of Putnam Valley, with the roadways reverting to two lanes and the shoulders replaced by soft curbs, in preparation for the rugged terrain of the next . From this point north, the original design of the Taconic is still intact for the most part, aside from safety improvements like the removal of all at-grade intersections. Curves become sharper, with the widest having a radius of . It remains generally level for the first , past the Bryant Pond Road exit serving Mahopac. The land around the road is heavily wooded and less developed than in Westchester.

 to the north, the road begins to descend in alongside a steep ridge, narrowing to less than , with a high stone retaining wall along the east side, to Peekskill Hollow Creek and the exit for the similarly named road, briefly entering the town of Carmel in the process. It starts to climb again just past the exit, and to the north it goes into an S-curved section with both segments having extremely narrow radii. The Taconic moves to the east in the process then resumes its roughly northward heading up the Roaring Creek valley into Clarence Fahnestock State Park. For the next it will cross this protected area of the eastern Hudson Highlands, with no development visible from the highway.

The roadways begin to separate as the parkway&#x27;s ascent continues through heavily wooded terrain past rocky cliffs and outcrops between two lakes. Next to a now-closed overlook on the eastern side, with the two roadways apart in the densely wooded country, signs on both roadways mark the Taconic&#x27;s highest elevation, almost above sea level.

A short distance beyond that, a stone bridge marks the NY 301 exit that serves as the main access to the state park and the bathing area and hiking trails at nearby Canopus Lake. The parkway begins to descend again, entering its last Putnam County town, Kent. It bends east again, and within it crosses into Dutchess County.

===Dutchess County===
Continuing its easterly slant, the Taconic starts leveling out in Dutchess County, the largest county segment of any of the four counties along the road, entering the town of East Fishkill. Just south of the Miller Hill Road exit, the first in the county, the road widens, with grassy slopes on its east side. At this point the hills farther north are visible in the distance, and the valley to the west, between Hosner and Shenandoah mountains, opens up occasional scenic vistas to the west.

A grade crossing with a flashing overhead warning beacon was replaced in 2000 by a grade-separated exit, making the Appalachian Trail&#x27;s crossing here less hazardous. The Taconic levels off into a narrow section bearing due northeast along Hosner Mountain&#x27;s steep west slope, with stone walls on either side. This ends after a mile with the Interstate 84 (I-84) interchange.

North of the Interstate Highway, the parkway bends to the northwest and starts to assume the character it retains through most of Dutchess County, with a wider, intermittently cleared median and gentler turns (their radii reaching almost , more than twice that of the widest curve in Putnam County), taking it through the now lower hills. There are still no shoulders. A closed rest area sits in the median between I-84 and the NY 52 exit farther north.

The road then bends back toward the northeast, reverting to a four-lane expressway, narrowing again through some wooded stretches over the next few miles to the Beekman Road (County Route 9 or CR 9) exit. This area, rural and agricultural when the highway was built, has become more developed in the last decades, with residential subdivisions and golf courses replacing the silos and haystacks as landmarks off the road.

A long curve back to the northwest again takes the Taconic to the first of its two interchanges with NY 82, at Arthursburg. Almost a mile to its north, the Arthursburg Road at-grade crossing was closed, and a southbound off-ramp and on-ramp were built. The road bends back north into the town of LaGrange to the next exit a half-mile () beyond, at Noxon Road (CR 21), a new exit accessible only to northbound traffic via an off-ramp.

The road widens through a wooded area and then narrows past another service area just before Todd Hill Road. The road drops to cross a creek, then rises again to the NY 55 exit, one of two roads serving the city of Poughkeepsie to the west, near Freedom Plains. Its slow undulation with the landscape continues past the now closed Skidmore Road grade crossing as it heads due north into the town of Pleasant Valley and the less developed half of Dutchess County.

The roadways separate widely () again for a mile in the woods east of James Baird State Park. An entry road forks to the left from the northbound lanes and crosses the southbound lanes via an underpass with on/off ramp. The two roadways descend and come together again by the Mountain Road grade crossing.

It climbs a hill after the McDonnell Road crossing, then descends to the Rossway Road crossing. A quarter-mile () to the north, a dead-end road leaves the northbound lanes for the nearby Taconic–Hereford Multiple Use Area. Several other local roads cross the parkway until it reaches one of its straightest stretches, which then curves to the first grade-separated exit in several miles, US 44, the other main route to Poughkeepsie, between Millbrook and Pleasant Valley.

The road passes through a much more wooded area as it makes a long curve into its next junction, the grade intersection at Hibernia Road. A bridge over Wappinger Creek to the north separates that grade crossing from the one with Hollow Road (CR 14) and takes the road into the town of Clinton. Another half-mile () north, at the next exit, NY 115 has its eastern terminus while Salt Point Turnpike continues.

A slight western slant continues as the parkway traverses a landscape now thoroughly rural, with fields and woodlots alternating. Two more grade crossings, at Willow and Pumpkin lanes, follow through a long curve to the east and back. At Nine Partners Road, the Taconic is back on a northward heading as it slips east of the Stanford town line.

It begins to climb onto the high ground between the Hudson and the Taconic Mountains to the east. To the west there are occasional glimpses across the river valley to the Catskill Escarpment to the west. From here the parkway bends eastward again, entering the town of Milan and climbs slowly through generally wooded area, passing another grade crossing at Cold Spring Road. The next exit, at NY 199, is the last in Dutchess County. After another long bend east, the Taconic goes north again and crosses into Columbia County just past Roeliff Jansen Kill Multiple Use Area and the Jackson Corners Road (CR 2) exit.

===Columbia County===

The parkway terrain in Columbia is similar to that in northern Dutchess, with more views opening up in the north as the road levels out. The surrounding farms and woods get more extensive. After entering the county, the Taconic continues due north through the town of Gallatin through unbroken woods. It bends slightly to the intersection with CR 8 to pass the beach at Lake Taghkanic State Park, with the access road for the park leaving to the east at grade from the northbound lanes where the highway enters the town of Taghkanic. Another half-mile () to the north is the second interchange with NY 82.

North of that exit, the parkway bends to the northeast again, paralleling the orientation of the county as a whole. It crosses briefly into the town of Claverack, then back into Taghkanic before reentering Claverack as it heads due east briefly, then north again into the NY 23 exit near the hamlet of Martindale. It bends from the northerly heading back to the northeast to cross into Philmont over the next , where NY 217 comes to its eastern terminus at the exit with the Taconic.

Past a rise beyond that exit, there are scenic overlook parking areas on both sides of the highway with panoramic views west to the Catskills. The road curves into the town of Ghent, with two more at-grade intersections, one of which being Rigor Hill Road, which features a gas station right on the side of the parkway.

The Taconic continues to the north from here for more, crossing into the town of Chatham, with an exit for NY 203 shortly after. The parkway continues north through Chatham, where signs warn drivers that the NY 295 exit is the last before the Thruway tolls at the end of the road. The last exit for Rock City Road is open only to southbound traffic, allowing commercial vehicles that have ventured onto the parkway to exit. A toll gantry for exit B2 on the Berkshire Section of the New York State Thruway (I-90), marks the administrative end of the Taconic State Parkway, from Kensico Circle.

==Scenery==

Landscape architects such as Gilmore Clarke worked closely with engineers and construction crews during the Taconic&#x27;s construction, often on site. Some features of the road&#x27;s design address practical considerations and increase safety. Curves that climbed or descended were banked to increase vehicle traction and permit better drainage. Likewise the curves in undulating terrain are located to reduce blind spots at crests and keep the sharpest turns out of valleys. These also make sure that views of distant landscapes open up on downgrades and on long curves, when they are less distracting.

Closer to the road, on the northern sections in Columbia and Dutchess counties, the road was routed to showcase a nearby view of wooded hillside or a farm. Since trucks were not permitted on the road—for some time, this even included privately owned pickup trucks used solely for personal use—in many sections tree branches overhang the roadways, creating a park-like canopy. The curve of the northbound AMVETS Memorial Bridge over Croton Reservoir echoes the surrounding hills. On the medians and berms, plantings were carefully planned to maintain continuity with the surrounding woods. On the descent into Peekskill Hollow in Putnam Valley, the trees and shrubs above the retaining wall on the east side were transplanted from the path of the highway, which retained the appearance of the local forest and saved money. Overpasses, both carrying roads over the parkway and carrying it over roads, were faced in native stone. Grade intersections, usually a feature engineers tried to avoid, which initially helped keep local east–west routes open and connect the parkway to the landscape it traversed, have since either been closed or replaced by overpasses.

As a result, the Taconic has been the subject of much praise over the years not only for its vistas but for the way it harmonizes with the surrounding landscape. Sociologist Lewis Mumford, who often criticized the effect of superhighway construction on contemporary cities, always advised friends traveling up from New York to visit him at his house in Amenia that they should take the Taconic. He described it as &quot;a consummate work of art, fit to stand on a par with our loftiest creations&quot;. The engineers, he said, had avoided &quot;brutal assaults against the landscape.&quot; Albany-born novelist William Kennedy, whose family frequently drove the Taconic during his childhood to visit relatives farther south, called it &quot;a postcard. It&#x27;s the most beautiful road I&#x27;ve ever known—in all seasons.&quot; &quot;You can drive it with confidence&quot;, said automotive writer David E. Davis. &quot;There are no bad surprises about the way the road is engineered.&quot; Landscape architect Garret Eckbo called the Taconic &quot;as lovely an integration of highway engineering and landscape architecture as one could hope to find&quot;. Commenting on this years later, architecture critic Matthew Gandy wrote:
In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with sections of the road modified from its original design and the rest areas mostly gone, writers for &quot;The New York Times&quot; have variously described the Taconic as &quot;a pleasure to use, evoking those bygone days when people went for a drive just for the fun of it&quot; and &quot;unquestionably among the most scenic roadways in the Northeast, winding along the Hudson Valley with a painter&#x27;s eye for landscape and a gearhead&#x27;s idea of fun.&quot; The Lonely Planet New York State guidebook calls it a &quot;highway masterpiece&quot;.

==Engineering==

The parkway&#x27;s engineering principles evolved over the four decades it took to build, with northern sections reflecting improvements in construction technology and lessons learned from the early days of construction. Some aspects of the original road remained consistent from end to end.

The Westchester County sections were laid out by the county&#x27;s parks commission based on the parkways they had already designed. Its engineers later worked on the design of the upper sections. In its early days, the Taconic State Parks Commission (TSPC) lacked the money to hire a full engineering staff, in spite of terrain that presented some major challenges. Its engineer, E.J. Howe, on loan from the state&#x27;s Department of Public Works (DPW), frequently complained about the commission&#x27;s directive that he plan a route only where it had the land or expected to buy it, instead of planning a route and then buying the land. He also began negotiations with landowners, and his position was eliminated from the commission&#x27;s budget after three years. His successor clashed with his superiors as well, and after he left in 1933 the commission relied on state DPW engineers for the rest of the construction.

Most of the original parkway was surfaced in reinforced concrete. Officials favored it despite its higher initial cost as compared to asphalt since it was less likely to need repair over its 50-year lifespan and reflected more light at night, improving safety. Asphalt was used for repaving of segments to the south; today the original concrete remains only between the US 44 and northern NY 82 exits.

The changes in the design of the northern Taconic also reflect higher speeds that mid-century automobiles were capable of, and improvements in construction technology. The track-equipped steam shovels that broke ground for the first section in Putnam County in 1931 were the most advanced excavators of the time. Over the next decade, the cost of moving a cubic yard dropped to almost half of what it had been in the early 1920s. Later in the parkway&#x27;s development, engineers began using aerial photographs to plan the route.

The road&#x27;s drainage system had some special features designed to avoid detracting from its scenic qualities. The roadway was crowned, with storm drain grates at the edge since there was no shoulder, to keep water from forming deep puddles that could cause accidents (these have been eliminated from modernized sections of the parkway in Westchester). The soft hand-fluted curbs also helped channel runoff to the basins, and in the median strips a central trench took water to underground pipes which drain into local streams.

The median strips themselves were not part of the original design on the lower sections of the Taconic, save for sections like Fahnestock State Park where designers used them to enhance the scenic capabilities of the road and create recreational opportunities. As the road was extended north during the 1930s, it became clear that the wider medians improved safety without sacrificing beauty, and starting with the NY 52 exit in East Fishkill they were made a standard element of the parkway&#x27;s design. Wider medians were also a lot easier to build in Dutchess and Columbia counties, as the land is much flatter than in Putnam County. When the parkway was modernized and widened in Westchester County, wide medians were installed for most of the length between the Sprain Brook Parkway and the Putnam County line.

==History==

The Taconic came into being as a result of the increasing presence of the automobile in American society and the demand for more public parks near crowded cities. Two separate agencies, the Taconic State Park Commission (TSPC) and Westchester County Parks Commission (WCPC), were its initial constructors, building different segments. In time a state authority would take over from them both, and then 18 years later itself yield up to its current administrator, the state Department of Transportation.

It would take nearly four decades to complete from the initial parkway proposal by TSPC chair Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1925 to the opening of the last segment in 1963, due in part to a lengthy hiatus resulting from World War II. Construction technology and highway design standards changed during the construction of the road, changes whose effect is still visible to drivers today. Since its completion it has been renovated, particularly in Dutchess and Westchester counties, reflecting the change in its role from park access route and scenic drive to important regional transportation artery.

===Background===

Immigration and industrialization caused a major increase in New York City&#x27;s population in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the summertime, many of these newer residents began looking for places to get away from the hot city and the densely populated tenements they lived in. The city&#x27;s own parks and beaches were often overcrowded. Automobiles became more affordable, and by 1917 there were more cars than horses in the city. Drivers began taking to low-quality roads in search of parks outside the city, but were often disappointed after long drives to find that most of those parks were closed to nonresidents.

In 1900, New York and New Jersey had jointly acquired the Palisades, the cliffs along the west side of the Hudson in both states, to protect them from further damage due to quarrying. Making it a park for city residents to visit on hot summer weekends had not been part of the plan, but it quickly became one. Many residents could not get to it because of insufficient ferry capacity. Its success as a park led to the establishment of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission and the construction of Palisades Interstate Parkway to allow nonstop drives through scenic and wooded areas through Palisades Park up to the Bear Mountain Bridge.

During his successful campaign for the State Senate in 1910, Roosevelt had toured the district in a car, still not common in the area, the first candidate to do so. He became more interested in the possibilities of automobile touring ten years later when, paralysis resulting from polio having cost the effective use of his legs, Roosevelt began frequently taking his friends on such trips around the region. During them, he began pondering the idea of a north–south parkway through the eastern Hudson Valley.

In 1922, as part of its political reform efforts, the New York State Association (NYSA) published &quot;A State Park Plan For New York&quot;, the first such comprehensive plan for any state&#x27;s parks. New York&#x27;s few parks at that time had been managed by a loose combination of public and private interests, and all the land had been donated to the state since the legislature would not appropriate money for any park outside a city.

The plan&#x27;s author, NYSA secretary Robert Moses, combined the ideas of association researchers into a document that transformed park planning. It was primarily a statewide plan for acquiring and protecting other large tracts of natural resources not currently in public ownership through a $15 million ($ in ) bond issue, an amount far in excess of any previously proposed. A subsequent revision proposed the coordination of state park management and development through various regional park commissions, centralized under a State Council of Parks (SCP), itself to be part of the Conservation Department. For citizens, it advocated the construction of parkways to make these areas accessible to nearby cities via automobile and that areas be developed not only for conservation but also for active outdoor recreation like golf, tennis and picnicking.

Moses proposed to Governor Al Smith, whom he served as an aide, that the bond issue be put to voters. After some reluctance, Smith agreed and sent the legislature a formal message to that effect but said he would not send the legislation itself until 1924. He feared opposition to the high cost, but was surprised when reaction was uniformly positive. The legislation creating the administrative structure of the state parks was drafted by Moses, who had been assured by Smith that he would be appointed to the position of executive director for both the SCP and the Long Island State Parks Commission. Seemingly innocuous phrases in the legislation gave the SCP director considerable power. The legislature passed the bill unanimously in 1924. The bond issue passed overwhelmingly that fall.

===Taconic Parkway plan===

Roosevelt was appointed chair of the newly created TSPC. It was expected to focus on the creation of a tri-state park along with Connecticut and Massachusetts, to protect and develop the mountainous area around the tripoint where the three states meet (today Taconic State Park). Other than that it had no obvious goals. The 1922 plan had not identified any areas in Columbia or Dutchess counties to protect as parks, and the area&#x27;s major scenic resources, the Catskills and Taconics, were largely outside its borders. At its third meeting, Roosevelt proposed the commission design and build a parkway along the following route:

Moses had already proposed an alternate route at the first meeting of the commission, which Roosevelt missed. He would have the parkway avoid the rugged terrain of central Putnam County and instead follow the Hudson from the Bear Mountain Bridge up to Cold Spring, where it would then go northeast to the Tri-State Park. That would allow it to pass through a scenic area along the river but created other issues for engineering and land acquisition. The two men lobbied their colleagues for their routes.

Roosevelt eventually won, pointing to a new state highway planned to run north from the bridge (today&#x27;s US 9W) and that a more direct route would better serve recreational traffic from the city. His was the plan initially adopted by the TSPC and approved by the SCP in July 1925, several months later. Moses relented, but reportedly said the parkway should extend only a few miles north of the city. Roosevelt is reported to have said later the parkway would extend north through the Adirondacks to the Canada–US border - a north–south freeway link of sorts that avoided the Adirondacks in starting slightly west of the TSP&#x27;s northern terminus, yet still reached the international border was achieved by the end of August 1967 with the completion of the Adirondack Northway (I-87).

===Bronx River Parkway Extension plan===
The WCPC had built of parkways on its own by the time the bond issue passed, retaining the services of landscape architect Gilmore Clarke for the latter. One of its most successful had been a joint project with New York City, the Bronx River Parkway, which followed the south Bronx River north from Soundview in the Bronx to public picnic grounds at Kensico Dam.

The road had first been proposed in 1895. In 1924 the parkway opened and was instantly popular. Its design was widely emulated on parkways in New York and elsewhere.

The WCPC had begun considering another idea of Moses&#x27;s, that the Bronx River Parkway could be extended north to the new Bear Mountain Bridge, at the time the only bridge over the Hudson River south of Poughkeepsie. Motorists could thus make a day trip from the city to the Hudson Highlands and back via the Palisades Parkway (which would soon connect directly into the city at the George Washington Bridge).

Two routes were considered for the extension. A western one took it past Briarcliff Manor; an eastern alternative was closer to Pleasantville and Chappaqua. Clarke recommended the western one for its scenery and cheaper land. He also noted that while both crossed the Croton River, the eastern one did so at the reservoir&#x27;s narrowest point, reducing the costs of a bridge.

It was universally agreed by all the agencies involved—the SCP, TSPC and WCPC—that the Taconic Parkway should extend south of Roosevelt&#x27;s route through Putnam County and connect to the Bronx River Parkway extension at the former&#x27;s southern terminus. The TSPC would build from the Putnam County line onwards.

===Construction===
====1925–28, route planning and land acquisition====
Throughout the late 1920s, both park commissions focused on land acquisition and planning. The WCPC was adequately funded with proceeds from the bond issue and other sources, and was able to accomplish both tasks with relative ease. That was not the case with the TSPC, for several reasons.
The greatest was the animosity between Moses and Roosevelt. The latter had hired his longtime associate Louis Howe as the TSPC&#x27;s secretary at a salary of $5,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Moses, as SCP head, was responsible for preparing the council&#x27;s budget and submitting it to the Conservation commissioner. He told Roosevelt that if he wanted &quot;a secretary and a valet&quot; he would have to pay for it personally.

Roosevelt never forgave him for this remark, and Moses later said that this incident was the root of the antipathy between them that lasted into Roosevelt&#x27;s later presidency. Moses, who also served as New York&#x27;s Secretary of State for two years during this period, used his influence with the legislature and control of the parks budgeting process to keep the TSPC&#x27;s finances low enough that it could barely maintain existing facilities under its jurisdiction, much less acquire right-of-way or hire staff.

Other regions and their plans, particularly Moses&#x27;s domain on Long Island, were well funded. He, and his political patron Smith, felt that the TSPC should focus not on the parkway but the Tri-State Park, which Moses and Smith believed Roosevelt&#x27;s commission had neglected, along with the donated property that has since become Fahnestock State Park. Moses also wanted to make sure that money was available for the parkways he was building on Long Island.

Roosevelt at one point wrote Smith an angry letter complaining that Moses had &quot;skinned us alive&quot; by allegedly lying to the governor and other officials about the TSPC. By early 1928 Roosevelt told the governor that he and the other TSPC commissioners had no choice but to resign if they were to continue to be so poorly served. Later that year the lack of funds, along with resistance from local property owners, led the commission to abandon Roosevelt&#x27;s original hope of routing the parkway over Stissing Mountain.

Smith dissuaded Roosevelt from doing so. The situation was resolved later that year, when Roosevelt was elected governor after Smith resigned to become the Democratic nominee for president in the 1928 election. In that capacity Roosevelt could no longer serve on the TSPC but could make sure the parkway was built due to his final authority over the proposed state budget. He also rebuffed Smith&#x27;s efforts to have him retain Moses as Secretary of State, although he could not remove him from the park posts.

====1929–31: completion of Bronx River Parkway extension====
In 1929 construction began on the WCPC section, with the connector to the Taconic getting underway the following year. In April 1931 steam shovels finally broke ground at Shrub Oak for the section built by the TSPC in Putnam County. Roosevelt and Moses both spoke at the ceremony, the former suggesting he still planned for the parkway to one day reach Canada. Eight months later the two rivals were at the north portal of the triple-hinged steel suspension bridge built over the reservoir, at the longest of that type in the world at the time, for the ribbon cutting ceremony. The next day, 20,000 cars took the new road from the city into the Manhattan Hills. Along the way were public picnic grounds in three areas, and of bridle paths in the median strip.

====1932–35: Putnam County====
They could not yet continue into Putnam County. Ernest Fahnestock had donated the first of the park named for his late brother. Further north, the TSPC had also acquired Lake Taghkanic and around it for development when the parkway eventually reached it. But land prices were rising in Putnam County as a result of the parkway, and the county&#x27;s Board of Supervisors told the state&#x27;s Department of Public Works (BPW) that it would not support the parkway since they believed the county had enough roads as it was. As a result, the engineers were told to only survey property once it had been acquired, a policy that they found difficult to follow.

The stretch of road descending into Peekskill Hollow was very problematic. Roosevelt feared that route would take the parkway too far east. It offered a view into the valley as it descended, but to preserve existing rock outcrops it was necessary to route it so that it descended at an 8.5% grade and make the roadway so narrow that there was only a foot (30.5 cm) between the curb and the wall on either side.

The engineering challenges it posed resulted in that stretch costing ten times as much to build as the to its south had. It was necessary to move of earth and replant 196 trees and 456 shrubs from the right-of-way to the edges. They were joined by 450 more shrubs on the slope above the road, primarily rhododendron and mountain laurel. Roosevelt, still taking an interest in the parkway, forced changes in the stonework of the Peekskill Hollow Road overpass to be more consistent with local architectural traditions. The bridge also had to be re-engineered due to the swampy ground.

Soil difficulties north of Mohansic Lake were making it difficult for the WSPC to complete its section as well. It was finished in late 1932, and paving began on the TSPC&#x27;s section the following year. The first had to be completely redone when the concrete slabs froze in place over the winter due to inadequately built drainage. Bridle paths along the median in this section, to Route 301 and Fahnestock State Park, were opened in 1933. After it was paved with its initial layer, it was opened to the public temporarily on Fourth of July weekend in 1935. It was opened permanently several weeks later after the fine work was done.

====1935–39: southern Dutchess County====
Some land for the Taconic State Parkway in Pleasant Valley was acquired in early 1932. The TSPC took advantage of several New Deal programs that Roosevelt had established upon being elected president in 1932. Funds provided under the National Industrial Recovery Act were used to build the road, while Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) workers based in camps at the commission&#x27;s state parks improved the parks and landscaping along the highway. Roosevelt himself was no longer involved as actively as he had been in state office, but continued to make occasional suggestions, such as the location of picnic areas in Columbia County. He also took a widely publicized drive from his home in Hyde Park to the site of the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair in 1938 that brought publicity to the new highway.

With Roosevelt preoccupied by his presidential responsibilities, his successor as TSPC chair, Francis Masters Jr., cultivated relationships with area state legislators. Assemblyman D. Mallory Stephens of Putnam County, and Senator Charles Bontecou in Dutchess, became strong supporters of the parkway. They helped secure funding when a veto by governor Herbert Lehman in 1937 threatened to postpone paving for the next segment, to NY 52 in Dutchess County.

That interchange marked a change in the parkway&#x27;s design reflecting an evolution within the engineering community. Previously the parkway had been mostly undivided, with medians only in a few places where necessary. This, a practice of the WSPC, had helped save land acquisition costs. But increasingly medians proved to be safer and more scenic. The segment between routes 52 and 82 at Arthursburg was the first designed as a fully divided parkway, with a continuous median. For the rest of the Taconic&#x27;s construction, the roadways would come together only when necessary, at bridges and grade intersections.

Land acquisition had presented some problems, with some landowners attempting to profiteer and others reneging on earlier donation agreements since the price of land in the parkway&#x27;s path had gone up. The commissioners used their power of eminent domain sparingly, despite Moses&#x27;s recommendations to the contrary, preferring to negotiate with local landowners since they, too, were longtime residents of the region. A land donation from James Baird, an engineer whose firm had built the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, led to the creation of James Baird State Park along the parkway in LaGrange.

Farmers, some of whom had received grade crossings to ensure that they could cross the parkway to their lands, nevertheless complained that they couldn&#x27;t take their own families for a ride on the road, since they often owned pickup trucks as their primary vehicles, which were not allowed on the road as commercial vehicles until decades later, as privately licensed or &quot;combination-plated&quot; vehicles. Local governments also saw the parkway as offering little benefit to their transportation needs, since it avoided the settlements in the region and could not handle commercial vehicles. The commission did not help matters by aggressively opposing paralleling road projects, on the grounds that it would spoil the views from the highway.

The next section of the Taconic, north to NY 55, east of Poughkeepsie, opened in late 1939. That year, Roosevelt wrote the commission with another suggestion, that an extension be built westward to Hyde Park. The commission also acquired Lake Taghkanic, the next park it proposed for the parkway.

====1941–49: the war years====

The Poughkeepsie connection allowed traffic to access the new Mid-Hudson Bridge, making the Taconic a more vital link in the state road network. In 1940 traffic counts increased heavily, showing that the parkway was now being used for more than the weekend pleasure trips it was originally intended for. The TSPC erected two more service areas, Shenandoah north of Hosner Mountain Road, and Todd Hill Road, to accommodate the increased traffic. The commission also closed (permanently, as it turned out) the bridle paths along the median strip in Putnam County, unsure about how it would pay for them.

In 1941, two developments occurred with a major impact on the highway. Early that year, Assemblyman Stephens introduced a bill similar to the one Lehman had vetoed four years earlier. This time it passed, giving the TSPC not only the $3.6 million (equivalent to $ in ) to extend the parkway to Columbia County but putting the Westchester sections, including the entire Bronx River Parkway extension and the planned Bear Mountain Parkway, under the commission&#x27;s jurisdiction. Later that year the U.S. entered World War II, putting a halt to actual construction for the duration.

The War Department designated the Taconic a military highway, requiring it to be open for troop movements. It also deemed the Croton Reservoir bridge strategically important and had it protected by armed guards. The commission lowered the speed limit from 40 to 30 mph (65 to 50 km/h) to conserve fuel, limited maintenance to snow removal and mowing and kept streetlights off everywhere except the bridge throughout the war. The speed limit on the section from Valhalla to Hawthorne was increased back to 40 mph until 1962.

Planning continued for the northern Dutchess stretch, to be built after the war. With the enforced break in construction, and its new authority over the entire road, the commission began to look at ways to improve what had already been built, especially in light of the road&#x27;s growing role as a regional artery. The Hawthorne Circle, where the Taconic, Saw Mill River Parkway and NY 100 intersected, was the major problem. It had become a magnet for accidents and congestion. A 1944 study recommended it be replaced with a three-level grade-separated interchange.

The study also suggested eliminating some of the more dangerous grade intersections in Westchester as well. Without the money to build new exits, the TSPC settled for larger stop signs on the intersecting roads. It would seek the money for the interchanges after the war.

The road&#x27;s northern terminus had still not been settled. In 1942 state highway commissioner H.O. Schermerhorn suggested it might be more useful if the road veered west north of Chatham towards Albany to connect to a proposed bridge over the Hudson there. The TSPC inspected the proposed route and found it would be very expensive to acquire and build, and in 1943 Schermerhorn agreed that the Taconic should continue on its planned course northwards. Three years later, in 1946, the commission also considered the Hyde Park extension proposed by the recently deceased Roosevelt, but dropped it as construction was resuming with the end of the war.

Paving had begun that year to Clinton Corners, but the commission became embroiled in controversy over Lake Taghkanic further north. In the two decades since the TSPC had bought the property, more cottages had been built along the lake. It would be necessary to condemn 110 of them to follow the proposed route west of the lake, similar to how the parkway had been built at Mohansic Lake to allow for a view from the road. The owners objected, and were able to persuade their state legislators to introduce a bill requiring a new parkway alignment at least west of the lake and prohibiting the commission from acquiring any property along it or constructing any of the road north of Route 199 until it had acquired a new route. Governor Thomas E. Dewey signed it into law in 1946 over Moses&#x27;s objections, delaying planning for two years.

Dewey also advocated the construction of a statewide &quot;thruway&quot; system of limited-access divided highways that would, unlike the parkways, be designed for buses and trucks as well as automobiles and serve commercial needs. Part of the system was a proposed &quot;Berkshire Thruway&quot; which would be the Taconic&#x27;s northern terminus, even as the commission was studying a route through Rensselaer County to the north.

State highway money was increasingly diverted to planning the thruway system. The proposed Berkshire Thruway terminus gave the TSPC renewed vigor in continuing construction, but meant that it had to abandon plans for a connection to the Tri-State Park, its original mandate. In October 1949, Dewey cut the chain on the section between Routes 55 and 199.

====1950–63: Columbia County====
As the designers and builders pushed north into Columbia County, connecting Lake Taghkanic State Park at last to the parkway, they took advantage of the more open and rolling terrain to improve the road&#x27;s scenic possibilities. Medians averaged in width, and it was easier to include views of the distant Catskills. Curves were generally wider than they had been in Dutchess County. A service station was built in the median at the park, and a scenic overlook at CR 8.

Dewey again presided at the opening of the link from Route 199 to 82 in October 1954. He expressed pride in having gotten the parkway out of Dutchess County at last under his tenure. He also called for parkway designers to straighten the roads out, and praised the Thruway, then under construction on the opposite side of the river. Moses, in his speech, recalled Roosevelt&#x27;s original hope to build the parkway all the way to Canada, the idea he had opposed three decades before. It did not appear likely that this would happen in any event, between the likely end of the Taconic at the Berkshire section of the Thruway and the recently announced plan to build the Adirondack Northway from Albany to Canada as part of the new Interstate Highway System.

Grading of the next section, to reach NY 23, had begun a month before the ceremony. When it was completed in summer 1956, paving was delayed because the money had not been released due to disagreement over whether to continue the use of concrete or asphalt. This was settled in favor of concrete and paving began in spring of 1957.

Asphalt proved less expensive, and it was used again when the next and last section of the Taconic to the Thruway was paved in the early 1960s. During this time another governor, Nelson Rockefeller, proposed that management of the road be turned over to a new entity, the East Hudson Parkway Authority (EHPA), along with all the other Westchester parkways since the debt the county had incurred building and maintaining them was becoming a financial burden. The new authority would oversee a $50 million (equivalent to $ in ) rehabilitation program.

The TSPC was opposed to the new plan. Its commissioners feared that their greatest work would pass to the control of an agency for which it would be just one of many responsibilities, and that it would be necessary to make the Taconic a toll road in order to pay for the improvements planned. When the bill passed and the EHPA was created, with most of its members from Westchester, Columbia County residents feared the road would never be completed. The TSPC was allowed to operate the Taconic through 1962, by agreement with the EHPA, since the former&#x27;s budget was already in place.

When it took over, the EHPA established the toll gate at the Thruway as the northern limit of its jurisdiction, ending any plans that some of the TSPC commissioners had had of continuing at least to US 20 a short distance to the north. An opening ceremony celebrating the completion of the road after almost four decades was planned for November 25, 1963. The parkway opened as scheduled, but the ceremony was canceled due to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy three days earlier.

===Improvements and reconstruction===
====1961–79, EHPA administration====
As early as its 1941 study the TSPC had had documentary evidence that some sections of the parkway, particularly in Westchester, were already outmoded. After the war, it had had to put most of the money it was now competing with the interstate system for into finishing the road. It was able to make one improvement, eliminating the grade intersection at Underhill Road in 1954. Clarke designed a new bridge architecturally sympathetic to those built in the early 1930s.

The TSPC had also planned to realign the road at Lake Mohansic and replace the grade intersection with an interchange. In 1962, while the commission was finishing the northern section of the Taconic, the EHPA began that project. The original parkway became the northbound roadway and a new southbound one was built. The EHPA&#x27;s improvements made the road safer and more efficient for the commuters who now used it, but changed the character of the road, widening it and replacing its concrete pavement with asphalt and its wooden guardrails with steel ones that were allowed to rust in order to approximate the color of their predecessors. In 1964, I-84 was built through Dutchess and Putnam counties, giving the middle of the Taconic a controlled-access intersecting route that made it possible to access the Danbury and Newburgh areas via the parkway.

Other EHPA improvements included the replacement of the Hawthorne Circle with an interchange and the construction of the new southbound bridge at Croton Reservoir. The steel truss bridge was named the most beautiful medium-span low-clearance bridge of 1970 by the American Institute of Steel Construction.

Moving north from Westchester, the authority sought to improve the Peekskill Hollow section, which had been so difficult to build initially. It had the highest accident rate on the Taconic, with 18 fatalities in 1965–66. The trees and cliffs kept the sun off the road, making it icy in wintertime. The EHPA planned to reconstruct a section in Yorktown in 1966, and it announced plans for a metal barrier in the middle of the road in 1967. It also planned another southbound roadway as much as to the west.

Residents of the area objected to the effect it would have on Fahnestock State Park. They also feared that the hamlet of Tompkins Corners, and other residents in the area, would become isolated in a large median strip. It would also be necessary to condemn a popular summer camp for city children that had been displaced to the area when the Thruway was routed through its original land in Orange County. Due to this opposition, the EHPA abandoned any plans for a realignment around Peekskill Hollow.

In 1979, with Westchester&#x27;s parkways adequately upgraded, the EHPA dissolved itself and turned control of all its roads, including the Taconic, over to the Department of Public Works&#x27; successor, the state Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). The new operator established the Westchester Parkways Commission for public input and planned a program to continue the rehabilitation and upkeep of the parkways.

====1979–present: DOT administration====
In 1980, the commuter-oriented Sprain Brook Parkway was completed to the Taconic, providing a higher-speed, signal-free means between it and the freeway portion of the Bronx River Parkway. DOT continued to remake the road in Westchester, where 90,000 vehicles used the parkway on an average day, reconfiguring exits, widening the roadways and putting asphalt over the original concrete, to the point that most of the parkway in the county bore little resemblance to its original appearance. The Taconic was designated a State Scenic Byway in 1992, and a multidisciplinary Corridor Management Plan was drafted and implemented seven years later to ensure that future changes to the road preserved and improved safety with minimal impact on its scenic and historic character. The next year the parkway was inventoried for the Historic American Engineering Record.
In the 21st century, DOT began addressing safety issues in Dutchess County, where traffic counts had increased by 7–11% annually since the 1970s. A 2003 task force report recommended action on many of the grade intersections, closing some completely while closing just the medians on others. Only the Salt Point Turnpike (NY 115) junction was spared.

There was some local controversy about the changes. Residents of some rural areas worried that the intersection closings would isolate them, and preservationists felt cell phone towers would detract from the scenic beauty along the parkway. Other residents welcomed the construction of noise barriers along sections that bordered near their homes.

There are no plans currently to modify any of the grade intersections north of Route 199, where use of the parkway has not significantly increased. The grade intersection at Pudding Street in Putnam County was replaced by a new diamond interchange between 2019 and 2021. The state had previously added turn lanes and widened the median so that a school bus would not block the road, but members of the county&#x27;s Traffic Safety Board, including the sheriff, said that accidents were still too frequent. Similarly, there has been talk in Dutchess County of replacing the Carpenter Road intersection with an interchange.

When the parkway was listed on the National Register in late 2005, the entire right-of-way from Kensico Circle to the Thruway merge was included, creating a linear historic district. These make the parkway the third largest Register listing in the state. The entire parkway, right-of-way and supporting buildings and structures were considered contributing except for the of rebuilt roadway between the former Hawthorne Circle and Crom Pond Road and 23 bridges in the southern three counties.

The parkway got another state park in 2006, when another wealthy individual donated land. Donald Trump had bought along the east side of the road near the Westchester–Putnam county line in 1998, intending to develop it into a hotel and golf course. Local opposition was considerable, and he decided to donate the land to the state. It is now Donald J. Trump State Park, with separate parcels called Indian Hill and French Hill.

In July 2009, Diane Schuler of West Babylon crashed her van head-on into an oncoming sport utility vehicle (SUV) while driving south in the northbound lanes approximately north of the Pleasantville Road exit. Eight people, including Schuler and several children, were killed. The accident was the deadliest ever on the parkway, and the worst motor vehicle accident in Westchester County since 1934. Schuler was determined to have been driving under the influence of both alcohol and marijuana.

The road, which has a lower accident rate than average for New York, was not considered to be at fault. Some changes were nevertheless made. Two large &quot;Wrong Way&quot; signs were installed on the ramp she drove down. Westchester County Executive Andrew Spano ordered that signage at onramps on the Taconic and other parkways in the county be checked to make sure &quot;there can be no question of whether you&#x27;re entering or exiting.&quot; The state legislature passed Leandra&#x27;s Law, making it a felony to drive while intoxicated with a passenger 16 or younger, partly as a result of the accident.

In the years 2009 and 2010, the existing &quot;rustic&quot; guide rail along the medians and edges of the parkway were systematically replaced with zinc-coated type guide rail. The existing &quot;rustic&quot; box beam, cable, and w-shape guide rail were replaced.

According to data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Taconic was the second deadliest road in Dutchess County after US 9 between 1994 and 2008. New York State Police blamed travelers exceeding speed limits, wildlife crossings and trucks being directed onto the parkway by their GPS navigation devices. The state was planning to post more explicit signage making it clear that trucks are not allowed on parkways in New York.

==Exit list ==
Intersections and interchanges were formerly numbered sequentially with a single letter prefix indicating the county, with exit numbers resetting at county lines. Intersection numbers were posted on small tabs attached to the intersection sign, as opposed to on gore signs as on other limited-access highways. Numbering was not necessarily sequential, as some exits were removed or added after the parkway opened.

From 2016 to 2018, NYSDOT added mileage-based exit numbers. At-grade intersections were not numbered, though their signage was improved. The Taconic, which is the state&#x27;s longest parkway, previously stood out for its lack of exit numbers ever since the county-based numbering system was removed in the late 1990s.

<doc id="1232575" wikidata="Q2485083" url="?curid=1232575" title="Suicide methods">
<text>A suicide method is any means by which a person may choose to end their life. Suicide attempts do not always result in death, and a non-fatal suicide attempt can leave the person with serious physical injuries, long-term health problems, or brain damage.

Worldwide, three suicide methods predominate, with the pattern varying in different countries: these are hanging, pesticides, and firearms. Some suicides may be preventable by removing the means. Making common suicide methods less accessible leads to an overall reduction in the number of suicides.

Method-specific ways to do this might include restricting access to pesticides, firearms, and commonly used drugs. Other important measures are the introduction of policies that address the misuse of alcohol and the treatment of mental disorders. Gun-control measures in a number of countries have seen a reduction in suicides and other gun-related deaths. Other preventive measures are not method-specific; these include support, access to treatment, and calling a crisis hotline. There are multiple talk therapies that reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors regardless of method, including dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). 
== Purpose of study ==
The study of suicide methods aims to identify those commonly used, and the groups at risk of suicide; making methods less accessible may be useful in suicide prevention. Limiting the availability of means such as pesticides and firearms is recommended by a World Health Report on suicide and its prevention. The early identification of mental disorders and substance abuse disorders, follow-up care for those who have attempted suicide, and responsible reporting by the media are all seen to be key in reducing the number of deaths by suicide. National suicide prevention strategies are also advocated using a comprehensive and coordinated response to suicide prevention. This needs to include the registration and monitoring of suicides and attempted suicide, breaking figures down by age, sex, and method.

Such information allows public health resources to focus on the problems that are relevant in a particular place, or for a given population or subpopulation. For instance, if firearms are used in a significant number of suicides in one place, then public health policies there could focus on gun safety, such as keeping guns locked away, and the key inaccessible to at-risk family members. If young people are found to be at increased risk of suicide by overdosing on particular medications, then an alternative class of medication may be prescribed instead, a safety plan and monitoring of medication can be put in place, and parents can be educated about how to prevent the hoarding of medication for a future suicide attempt.

== Media reporting ==

Media reporting of the methods used in suicides is &quot;strongly discouraged&quot; by the World Health Organization, government health agencies, universities, and the Associated Press among others. Detailed descriptions of suicides or the personal characteristics of the person who died contribute to copycat suicides (suicide contagion). Dramatic or inappropriate descriptions of individual suicides by mass media has been linked specifically to copycat suicides among teenagers. Writing for the &quot;New Yorker&quot; about celebrity suicides, Andrew Solomon wrote that &quot;You who are reading this are at statistically increased risk of suicide right now.&quot; In one study, changes in how news outlets reported suicide reduced suicides by a particular method.

Media reporting guidelines also apply to &quot;online content including citizen-generated media coverage&quot;. The Recommendations for Reporting on Suicide, created by journalists, suicide prevention groups, and internet safety non-profit organizations, encourage linking to resources such as a list of suicide crisis lines and information about risk factors for suicide, and reporting on suicide as a multi-faceted, treatable health issue.

== Method restriction ==

Method restriction, also called &quot;lethal means reduction&quot;, is an effective way to reduce the number of suicide deaths in the short and medium term. Method restriction is considered a best practice supported by &quot;compelling&quot; evidence. Some of these actions, such as installing barriers on bridges and reducing the toxicity in gas, require action by governments, industries, or public utilities. At the individual level, method restriction can be as simple as asking a trusted friend or family member to store firearms until the crisis has passed. According to Danuta Wasserman, professor in psychiatry and suicidology at Karolinska Institute, choosing not to restrict access to suicide methods is unethical.

Method restriction is effective and prevents suicides. It has the largest effect on overall suicide rates when the method being restricted is common and no direct substitution is available.&quot;&quot; If the method being restricted is uncommon, or if a substitute is readily available, then it may be effective in individual cases but not produce a large-scale reduction in the number of deaths in a country.

&quot;Method substitution&quot; is the process of choosing a different suicide method when the first-choice method is inaccessible. In many cases, when the first-choice method is restricted, the person does not attempt to find a substitute. Method substitution has been measured over the course of decades, so when a common method is restricted (for example, by making domestic gas less toxic), overall suicide rates may be suppressed for many years. If the first-choice suicide method is inaccessible, a method substitution may be made which may be less lethal, tending to result in fewer fatal suicide attempts.

In an example of the curb cut effect, changes unrelated to suicide have also functioned as suicide method restrictions. Examples of this include changes to align train doors with platforms, switching from coal gas to natural gas in homes, and gun control laws, all of which have reduced suicides despite being intended for a different purpose.

==List==

=== Suffocation ===
Suffocation, as a classification of suicide method, includes strangulation and hanging.

Suicide by suffocation involves restricting breathing or the amount of oxygen taken in, causing asphyxia and eventually hypoxia. It is not possible to die simply by holding the breath, since a reflex causes the respiratory muscles to contract, forcing an in-breath, and the re-establishment of a normal breathing rhythm. Therefore, inhaling an inert gas such as helium or nitrogen, or a toxic gas such as carbon monoxide, is used to bring about unconsciousness. Certain devices such as exit bags are designed to be used with this method, and provide a way for the carbon dioxide to passively escape, which prevents the panic, sense of suffocation and struggling before unconsciousness, known as the hypercapnic alarm response caused by the presence of high carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood. , organizations supporting a right to die promoted death by helium inhalation, although most cases using this method in the US were people with psychiatric conditions.

====Hanging====

Hanging is a common method of suicide. Hanging involves the use of a ligature such as a rope or cord attached to an anchor point with the other end used to form a noose placed around the neck. The cause of death will either be due to strangulation or a broken neck. About half of attempted suicides by hanging result in death. People who favor this method are usually unaware that it is often a &quot;slow, painful, and messy method that [needs] technical knowledge&quot;.

Hanging is the prevalent means of suicide in impoverished pre-industrial societies, and is more common in rural areas than in urban areas.

Hanging was the most common method in traditional Chinese culture, as it was believed that the rage involved in such a death permitted the person&#x27;s spirit to haunt and torment survivors. In the Chinese culture, suicide by hanging was used as an act of revenge by women and of defiance by powerless officials, who used it as a &quot;final, but unequivocal, way of standing still against and above oppressive authorities&quot;. Chinese people would often approach the act ceremonially, including the use of proper attire.

====Drowning====
Suicide by drowning is the act of deliberately submerging oneself in water or other liquid to prevent breathing. It accounts for less than 2% of all suicides in the United States. People with dementia and schizophrenia have a higher risk of dying by drowning. Of those who attempt suicide by drowning in the US, about half die.

About 2% to 3% of suicides by drowning involve driving a vehicle into a body of water.

=== Poisoning ===

Suicide by poisoning, also called &quot;self-poisoning&quot;, is usually classed as a drug overdose when drugs such as painkillers or recreational drugs are used. The use of pesticides to self-poison is the most common method used in some countries. Poisoning through the means of toxic plants is usually slow and painful.

==== Pesticide ====

, worldwide, around 30% of suicides were from pesticide poisonings. It was the leading suicide method in developing countries, with about half of suicide deaths in India involving poisoning, and most of those involving pesticides. The use of this method varies markedly in different areas of the world, from 0.9% in Europe to about 50% in the Pacific region. In the US, pesticide poisoning is used in about 12 suicides per year. The overall case fatality rate for suicide attempts using pesticide is about 10–20%; the risk of death increases if the person is also drunk at the time.

Method restriction is an effective way to reduce suicide by pesticide poisoning. In Finland, limiting access to parathion in the 1960s resulted in a rapid decline in both poisoning-related suicides and total suicide deaths for several years, and a slower decline in subsequent years. In Sri Lanka, both suicide by pesticide and total suicides declined after first toxicity class I and later class II endosulfan were banned. Overall suicide deaths were cut by 70%, with 93,000 lives saved over 20 years as a result of banning these pesticides. In Korea, banning a single pesticide, paraquat, halved the number of suicides by pesticide poisoning and reduced the total number of suicides in that country.

==== Drug overdose ====

A drug overdose involves taking a dose of a drug that exceeds safe levels. In the UK (England and Wales) until 2013, a drug overdose was the most common suicide method in females. In 2019 in males the percentage is 16%. Self-poisoning accounts for the highest number of non-fatal suicide attempts. In the United States about 60% of suicide attempts and 14% of suicide deaths involve drug overdoses. The risk of death in suicide attempts involving overdose is about 2%.

Overdose attempts using painkillers are among the most common, due to their easy availability over-the-counter. Paracetamol (also called acetaminophen) is the most widely used analgesic worldwide and is commonly used in overdose attempts. Paracetamol poisoning is a common cause of acute liver failure. If not treated, the overdose produces a long and painful illness, with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, sweating, and abdominal pain appearing several hours after ingestion and continuing for several days. People who take overdoses of paracetamol do not fall asleep or lose consciousness, although most people who attempt suicide with paracetamol wrongly believe that they will be rendered unconscious by the drug. Method-specific restriction through reducing package size in the UK and Ireland has reduced suicide deaths by drug overdose.

==== Carbon monoxide ====

A particular type of poisoning involves the inhalation of high levels of carbon monoxide (CO). Death usually occurs through hypoxia. A nonfatal attempt can result in memory loss and other symptoms.

Carbon monoxide is a colorless and odorless gas, so its presence cannot be detected by sight or smell. It acts by binding preferentially to the hemoglobin in the bloodstream, displacing oxygen molecules and progressively deoxygenating the blood, eventually resulting in the failure of cellular respiration and death. Carbon monoxide is extremely dangerous to bystanders and people who may discover the body; right-to-die advocate Philip Nitschke has therefore recommended against this method.

Before air quality regulations and catalytic converters, suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning was often achieved by running a car&#x27;s engine in an enclosed space such as a garage, or by redirecting a running car&#x27;s exhaust back inside the cabin with a hose. Motor car exhaust may have contained up to 25% carbon monoxide. Catalytic converters found on all modern automobiles eliminate over 99% of carbon monoxide produced. As a further complication, the amount of unburned gasoline in emissions can make exhaust unbearable to breathe well before a person loses consciousness.

Charcoal-burning suicide induces death from carbon monoxide poisoning. Originally used in Hong Kong, it spread to Japan, where small charcoal-burning heaters (&quot;hibachi&quot;) or stoves (&quot;shichirin&quot;) have been used in a sealed room. By 2001, this method accounted for 25% of deaths from suicide in Japan. Nonfatal attempts can result in severe brain damage due to cerebral anoxia.

==== Other toxins ====

Gas-oven suicide was a common method of suicide in the early to mid-20th centuries in some North American and European countries. Household gas was originally coal gas, also called illuminating gas, or town gas, which was composed of methane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Stoves of this era required one to manually ignite a pilot light with a match; without the combustion the gas cloud would spread unimpeded. Carbon monoxide poisoning was the proximate cause of death. Natural gas, introduced in the 1960s, is composed of methane, ethane and an odorant added for safety. The suicide rates by domestic gas fell from 1960 to 1980, as changes were made to the formula to make it less lethal.

=== Shooting ===


In the United States, suicide by firearm is the most lethal method of suicide, resulting in a fatality 90% of the time, and is thus the leading cause of death by suicide as of 2017. Worldwide, firearm prevalence in suicides varies widely, depending on the acceptance and availability of firearms in a culture. The use of firearms in suicides ranges from less than 10% in Australia to 50.5% in the U.S., where it is the most common method of suicide.

Generally, the bullet will be aimed at point-blank range. Surviving a self-inflicted gunshot may result in severe chronic pain as well as reduced cognitive abilities and motor function, subdural hematoma, foreign bodies in the head, pneumocephalus and cerebrospinal fluid leaks. For temporal bone directed bullets, temporal lobe abscess, meningitis, aphasia, hemianopsia, and hemiplegia are common late intracranial complications. As many as 50% of people who survive gunshot wounds directed at the temporal bone suffer facial nerve damage, usually due to a severed nerve.

==== Gun control ====

Reducing access to guns at a population level decreases the risk of suicide by firearms.

Fewer people die from suicide overall in places with stricter laws regulating the use, purchase, and trading of firearms. Suicide risk goes up when firearms are more available.

Gun control is a primary method of reducing suicide by people who live in a home with guns. Prevention measures include simple actions such as locking all firearms in a gun safe or installing gun locks. Some people self-impose a barrier to using the keys to unlock their guns, such as by asking a friend to keep the keys in a different place, or by freezing them in an ice cube. This prevents spur-of-the-moment access to their own guns. Some stores that sell guns provide temporary storage as a service; in other cases, a trusted friend or family member will offer to store the guns until the crisis has passed. When a person is going through a crisis, red flag laws in some places allow family members to petition the courts to have firearms temporarily removed and stored elsewhere.

More firearms are involved in suicide than are involved in homicides in the United States. A 1999 study of California and gun mortality found that a person is more likely to die by suicide if they have purchased a firearm, with a measurable increase of suicide by firearm beginning at most a week after the purchase and continuing for six years or more.

The United States has both the highest number of suicides and firearms in circulation in a developed country, and when gun ownership rises so too does suicide involving the use of a firearm. A 2004 report by the National Academy of Sciences found an association between estimated household firearm ownership and gun suicide rates, though a study by two Harvard researchers did not find a statistically significant association between household firearms and gun suicide rates, except in the suicides of children aged 5–14. Another study found that gun prevalence rates were positively associated with suicide rates among people aged 15 to 24, and 65 to 84, but not among those aged 25 to 64. Access to firearms is associated with a higher risk of suicide, especially for people keeping loaded guns in the home. Numerous ecological and time series studies have also shown a positive association between gun ownership rates and suicide rates. This association tends to only exist for firearm-related and overall suicides, not for non-firearm suicides. Studies consistently find a relationship between gun ownership and gun-related suicides, with few exceptions. A 2016 study found a positive association between gun ownership and both gun-related and overall suicides among men, but not among women; gun ownership was only strongly associated with gun-related suicides among women. During the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a strong upward trend in adolescent suicides with a gun, as well as a sharp overall increase in suicides among those age 75 and over.

Firearm-related suicides declined in Australia after the introduction of nationwide gun control. The same study found no evidence of substitution to other methods. In Canada, gun suicides declined after gun control, but other methods rose, leading to no change in the overall rates. Similarly, in New Zealand, gun suicides declined after more legislation, but overall suicide rates did not change; this might be due to the highly stringent firearm storage laws and very low prevalence of handgun ownership in New Zealand. A study about Canada found no significant correlations between provincial firearm ownership and overall provincial suicide rates.

=== Jumping ===
Jumping is the most common method of suicide in Hong Kong, accounting for 52.1% of all reported suicide cases in 2006 and similar rates for the years before that. The Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention of the University of Hong Kong believes that it may be due to the abundance of easily accessible high-rise buildings in Hong Kong. In the United States, jumping is among the least common methods of suicide (less than 2% of all reported suicides in 2005). Between 1937 and 2012, there were around 2,000 suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge. Jumping deaths are often impulsive, and one study of the Golden Gate Bridge demonstrated that more than 90% of people interrupted in a suicide attempt ultimately died by natural or accidental causes, with only 6% dying in a subsequent suicide attempt.

Many jumping deaths could be prevented through the construction of fencing or other safety equipment. For example, suicide by jumping into a volcanic crater is a rare method of suicide. Mount Mihara in Japan briefly became a notorious suicide site during the Great Depression following media reports of a suicide there. Copycat suicides in the ensuing years prompted the erection of a protective fence surrounding the crater. Similarly, in New Zealand, secure fencing at the Grafton Bridge substantially reduced the rate of suicides. Chest-high barriers are more effective than waist-high barriers because they require more time and effort to climb over.

Constructing barriers is not the only option, and it can be expensive. Other method-specific prevention actions include making staff members visible in high-risk areas, using closed-circuit television cameras to identify people in inappropriate places or behaving abnormally (e.g., lingering in a place that people normally spend little time in), and installing awnings and soft-looking landscaping, which deters suicide attempts by making the place look ineffective.

Another factor in reducing jumping deaths is to avoid suggesting in news articles, signs, or other communication that a high-risk place is a common, appropriate, or effective place for dying by jumping from. The efficacy of signage is uncertain, and may depend on whether the wording is simple and appropriate.

=== Cutting and stabbing ===

A fatal self-inflicted wound to the wrist is termed a &quot;deep wrist injury&quot;, and is often preceded by several tentative surface-breaking attempts known as &quot;hesitation wounds&quot;, indicating indecision or a self-harm tactic. For every suicide by wrist cutting, there are many more nonfatal attempts, so that the number of actual deaths using this method is very low.

Wounds from suicide attempts involve the non-dominant hand, with damage often done to the median nerve, ulnar nerve, radial artery, palmaris longus muscle, and flexor carpi radialis muscle. Such injuries can severely affect the function of the hand, and the inability caused to carry out work or interests increases the risk of further attempts.

Seppuku is a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment. While reserved for samurai in their code of honour, a feminine counterpart of female ritual suicide also exists (sometimes incorrectly referred to in western understanding as jigai), which involves cutting the jugular vein. While seppuku requires the assistance of another samurai, jigai can be performed on the self. Seppuku is painful and slow - neither method is common in the modern day.

=== Starvation and dehydration ===
A classification has been made of &quot;Voluntarily Stopping Eating and Drinking&quot; (VSED) which is often resorted to by those with a terminal illness. This includes fasting and dehydration, and has also been referred to as &quot;autoeuthanasia&quot;. It has been used by assisted dying activists, such as Wendy Mitchell, as an means of death in places where assisted suicide is not available.

Fasting to death has been used by Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain ascetics and householders, as a ritual method of suicide known as Prayopavesa in Hinduism; Sokushinbutsu historically in Buddhism; and as Sallekhana in Jainism. Cathars also fasted to death after receiving the consolamentum sacrament, in order to die while in a morally perfect state. The method is also used in passive senicide and associated with the political protest of the hunger strike such as the 1981 Irish hunger strike in which ten prisoners died.

Death from dehydration can take from several days to a few weeks. This means that unlike many other suicide methods, it cannot be accomplished impulsively. Those who die by terminal dehydration typically lapse into unconsciousness before death, and may also experience delirium and deranged serum sodium.

Terminal dehydration has been described as having substantial advantages over physician-assisted suicide with respect to self-determination, access, professional integrity, and social implications. Specifically, a patient has a right to refuse treatment and it would be a personal assault for someone to force water on a patient, but such is not the case if a doctor merely refuses to provide lethal medication. But it also has distinctive drawbacks as a humane means of voluntary death. One survey of hospice nurses found that nearly twice as many had cared for patients who chose voluntary refusal of food and fluids to hasten death as had cared for patients who chose physician-assisted suicide. They also rated fasting and dehydration as causing less suffering and pain and being more peaceful than physician-assisted suicide. Other sources note very painful side effects of dehydration, including seizures, skin cracking and bleeding, blindness, nausea, vomiting, cramping and severe headaches.

=== Collision with or of a vehicle ===
Another suicide method is to lie down, or throw oneself, in the path of a fast-moving vehicle, either on the road or onto railway tracks. Nonfatal attempts may result in profound injuries, such as multiple bone fractures, amputations, concussion and severe mental and physical handicapping.

==== Road ====

Some people use intentional car crashes as a suicide method. This especially applies to single-occupant, single-vehicle wrecks, although some suicidal drivers cause head-on collisions. Even single-vehicle collisions may harm other road users; for example, a driver who brakes abruptly or swerves to avoid a suicidal person may collide with something else on the road, resulting in harm to the driver or others. Both the innocent driver and bystanders may be traumatized by the experience, even if everyone survives. Being victimized by a suicidal pedestrian is recognized as an occupational hazard for professional drivers, especially if they operate heavy vehicles.

The real percentage of suicides among motor vehicle fatalities is not reliably known and likely varies by the ease of accessing a car and the ease of accessing other methods. Suicidal intent is often inferred from the circumstances, such as the driver being alone in the vehicle, driving at a high speed, without normal use of a seat belt, under circumstances that do not normally result in fatal wrecks (e.g., a straight road and good weather conditions). Somewhere between 1% and 10% of all crashes (fatal and non-fatal combined) likely result from suicidal intent. In addition a vehicle being used as a method (e.g., deliberately causing a wreck), a vehicle may be the location of a suicide attempt using another method (e.g., while the suicidal person is inside a parked car).

People who attempt vehicular suicide or murder–suicides tend to be adult men who recently experienced a stressful event. They tend to be impulsive, to have previously attempted suicide, and to have a history of reckless driving. Suicidal drivers are unlikely to be drunk at the time, though in the case of vehicle–pedestrian collisions, it may be difficult to determine whether an intoxicated pedestrian had suicidal intent or was non-suicidal but was so drunk as to be unable to recognize and respond to a dangerous situation.

==== Rail ====


==== Air ====

Toward the end of the 20th century, one or two pilots in the US died by suicide by aircraft each year. The pilot was usually flying alone at the time, and was using alcohol or drugs about half the time. In the rare case of a pilot engaging in murder–suicide, the number of innocent people is sometimes very high. On 24 March 2015, a Germanwings co-pilot deliberately crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 into the French Alps to kill himself, killing 150 people with him. Suicide by pilot has also been proposed as a potential cause for the disappearance and following destruction of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 in 2014, with supporting evidence being found in a flight simulator application used by the flight&#x27;s pilot.

=== Disease ===

There have been documented cases of gay men deliberately trying to contract a disease such as HIV/AIDS as a means of suicide.

=== Electrocution ===

Suicide by electrocution involves using a lethal electric shock, and is a rarely used method. This causes arrhythmias of the heart, meaning that the heart does not contract in synchrony between the different chambers, essentially causing elimination of blood flow. Furthermore, depending on the current, burns may also occur.

=== Fire ===

Self-immolation is suicide usually by fire. This method of suicide is rare due to it being long and painful. If the attempt is intervened, severe burns and scar tissue will prevail with subsequent emotional impact.

It has been used as a protest tactic, by Thích Quảng Đức in 1963 to protest the South Vietnam&#x27;s anti-Buddhist policies; by Malachi Ritscher in 2006 to protest the United States&#x27; involvement in the Iraq War; by Mohamed Bouazizi in 2011 in Tunisia which gave rise to the Tunisian Revolution; by Aaron Bushnell in 2024 to protest the United States&#x27; support for Israel in the Israel–Hamas war; and historically as a ritual known as sati where a Hindu widow would immolate herself in her husband&#x27;s funeral pyre.

=== Hypothermia ===
Hypothermia is a rare method of suicide. Between 1991 and 2014 in the United States, there were eight cases in the scientific literature, and they usually involved some other factor like drugs.

=== Assisted suicide ===
=== Indirect ===
Indirect suicide is the act of setting out on an obviously fatal course without directly carrying out the act upon oneself. Indirect suicide is differentiated from legally defined suicide by the fact that the person does not directly cause the action meant to kill them, but rather expects and allows the action to happen to them. Examples of indirect suicide include a soldier enlisting in the army with the intention and expectation of being killed in combat, or provoking an armed law enforcement officer into using lethal force against them. The latter is generally called &quot;suicide by cop&quot;.

Evidence exists for suicide by capital crime in colonial Australia. Convicts seeking to escape their brutal treatment would murder another individual. This was felt necessary due to a religious taboo against direct suicide. A person completing suicide was believed to be destined for hell, whereas a person committing murder could be absolved of their sins before execution. In its most extreme form, groups of prisoners on the extremely brutal penal colony of Norfolk Island would form suicide lotteries. Prisoners would draw straws with one prisoner murdering another. The remaining participants would witness the crime, and would be sent away to Sydney, as capital trials could not be held on Norfolk Island, thus earning a break from the Island. There is uncertainty as to the extent of suicide lotteries. While surviving contemporary accounts claim that the practice was common, such claims are probably exaggerated.

=== Rituals ===

Ritual suicide is performed in a specifically prescribed way, often as part of a cultural or religious practice. Suicide by hanging was traditionally practiced in China and the Sinosphere as a means of ensuring that one&#x27;s ghost would be able to haunt and torment the powerful but unjust. Self-immolation was practiced similarly in India and spread with Dharmic religions. Some forms of suicide involve or are understood as martyrdom and are undertaken ritualistically. Sallekhana is the practice of ritualized starvation following Jain practices. Romans who considered themselves dishonored would &quot;fall on their sword&quot;, ritualistically transfixing themselves on their swords; the similar medieval Japanese practice became known as seppuku or harakiri for samurai. Female ritual suicide (incorrectly referred to in some English sources as &quot;jigai&quot;) was carried out in Japan by wives of samurai who had committed seppuku or otherwise brought dishonour.

<doc id="1232584" wikidata="Q530710" url="?curid=1232584" title="Global Underground">
<text>Global Underground is a British record label and compilation series founded in 1996 by Andy Horsfield and James Todd. The label symbolised the international explosion of dance music during the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s and first manifesto for high-end DJs such as Tony De Vit, Sasha, Paul Oakenfold, John Digweed, Danny Tenaglia, Nick Warren, Dave Seaman, Darren Emerson, James Lavelle, Carl Cox, and Solomun.

The name &quot;Global Underground&quot; originally refers to a series of electronic music compilation albums which reflect the performances of various DJs in venues around the world. The &quot;Global Underground&quot; series was released by a record label formerly known as Boxed which featured several sister series such as Nubreed and Electric Calm. Boxed closed in 2001 and was superseded by Global Underground Ltd. Since its first release in 1996, the series was well received and became a hallmark in the progressive house world. The dance music style featured is mostly progressive house, but there is some house, trance house, hard house, techno and breakbeat included in the releases. The first five installments were live recorded from respective clubs, while the rest are mixed and recorded in a studio.

==Background==
Each issue in the series is based on the idea that Global Underground would take DJs to play a party in one of the most unusual, exotic clubbing locations on Earth. The set is then released in a 2CD format that is formatted to capture the night of the party and the overall feel of the DJ visit in music, contemporary photography by photographer Dean Belcher and extensive sleeve notes.

There are consistent characteristics in almost every album in the series including: 
*Each album being mixed by a globe-trotting DJ.
*The prominent influence of the location on the music and packaging.
*Extensive sleeve notes describing local clubbing scene and/or venue often written by Mixmag Editor Dom Phillips.
*Each album consisting of two discs.
*The song list is edited from the complete set based on a retrospective view of the performance.
*Photography by Dean Belcher

==International recognition==
&quot;Billboard&quot; has recognized Global Underground as the first DJ mix compilation to place high-quality photographs of DJs on the album covers. This, it further asserted, played a part in turning DJs into superstar figures within the culture of electronic dance music.

Thrive Records was the U.S. distributor for some of the early Global Underground releases. Global Underground albums had an alternate numbering sequence and had different artwork, but were otherwise the same.

==Catalogue==
This is the complete listing of available albums in the Global Underground main series which includes the sequential number of the album in the series, the performing DJ/producer, the location in which the performance took place and the official release date. The listed catalog numbers are for the British releases. The numbers on the albums distributed by Thrive in the United States are shown in parentheses - those without such labels do not have a differing release number. Global Underground also has several &quot;sub-series&quot; entitled Nubreed, Prototype, 24:7, Electric Calm, Afterhours, and most recently Global Underground DJ.

=== GU official ===


===Prototype===
Prototype was the first of a sub-series of releases separate from the mainline albums, was given to DJ Seb Fontaine to test if a spin-off series would be successful which after decent sales led to other series being produced like nubreed.

* PRO:002 Seb Fontaine, 
* PRO:003 Seb Fontaine,

===Nubreed===

GU Music allowed Global Underground to get into full length artist albums and Vinyl/CD/MP3 single releases. The GU Music team commented: &quot;Having nurtured some of the worlds finest DJs we have applied this expertise to original music, cherry picking the coolest future talent from across the globe...&quot; They have featured releases from such artists as UNKLE, Lostep, and Trafik. In 2007, it expanded with the release of the compilation GU Mixed which started a series of the same name that consisted of music sought from GU Music.

==GU002==
In Boxed&#x27;s UK releases, GU002 was the never released second installment in the Global Underground series (in Thrive&#x27;s US re-numbered releases, Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s &quot;New York&quot; mix was released as GU002). Global Underground jumped directly from GU001: Tony De Vit - Live In Tel Aviv to GU003: Nick Warren - Prague, which resulted in a lot of controversy and rumours on the nature of GU002. However, GU002 does exist in form of the tape pack of Tony De Vit&#x27;s Tel Aviv CD as the actual catalogue number of the release is GU002T. When Boxed started the GU series in 1996, they did not have a clear vision about the numbering scheme (later to become part of their image), which resulted in the &quot;missing&quot; release.

<text>Chitumbuka is a Bantu language which is spoken in Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania. It is also known as or — the &quot;chi-&quot; prefix in front of &quot;Tumbuka&quot; means &quot;in the manner of&quot; and is understood in this case to mean &quot;the language of the Tumbuka people&quot;. Chitumbuka belongs to the same language group (Guthrie Zone N) as other Bantu languages. In Northern Malawi, it is spoken in the districts of Rumphi, Mzuzu, Mzimba, Chitipa, Nkhata-Bay, Monkey Bay and Karonga as well as in Central Malawi in the districts of Kasungu and Nkhotakota. In Eastern Zambia, Chitumbuka is spoken in the districts of Lumezi, Chasefu, Lundazi and Chama (Senga dialect). In Southern Tanzania, it is spoken in Mbeya and Njombe districts that share boundary with Northern Malawi.

Senga (also called Tumbuka-Senga) is a dialect of Tumbuka spoken in Zambia&#x27;s Chama district and surrounding areas. 

&quot;The World Almanac&quot; in 1998 estimated that there were approximately two million Tumbuka speakers, though other sources estimated a much smaller number while others estimated a higher number. The majority of Tumbuka speakers live in Malawi and Zambia, with a smaller number in South Tanzania.

== Official and regional status ==
In 1947, Chitumbuka was made an official language of Malawi for 21 years along with Chewa and English. It was in 1968 when Hastings Kamuzu Banda removed the language as a result of his one-nation, one-language policy. The Chitumbuka language suffered a lot during the rule of President Banda. It was removed from the school curriculum, the national radio, and the print media. With the advent of multi-party democracy in 1994, Chitumbuka programmes were started again on the radio.

== Dialects ==
There are several dialects of Chitumbuka spoken in three countries. Malawi has Chikamanga, Chiphoka and Chihewe dialects that are spoken in Rumphi and Karonga Districts; Chiwenya spoken in Chitipa District and Chitumbuka spoken in Mzimba and NkhataBay Districts, including Mzuzu City. The Rumphi variant is often regarded as the most &quot;linguistically pure&quot; and is sometimes called &quot;real Chitumbuka&quot;. 

==Orthography==
Two systems of writing Tumbuka are in use: the traditional spelling (used for example in the Chitumbuka version of Wikipedia and in the newspaper ), in which words such as &#x27;people&#x27; and &#x27;year&#x27; are written with &#x27;b&#x27; and &#x27;ch&#x27;, and the new official spelling (used for example in the Citumbuka dictionary published online by the Centre for Language Studies and in the online Bible), in which the same words are written with &#x27;ŵ&#x27; and &#x27;c&#x27;, e.g. &quot;ŵanthu&quot; and &quot;caka&quot;. (The sound &#x27;ŵ&#x27; is a closely rounded [w] pronounced with the tongue in the close-i position.) There is some uncertainty over where to write &#x27;r&#x27; and where &#x27;l&#x27;, e.g. (Dictionary) or (Bible) &#x27;food&#x27;. (In fact [l] and [r] are allophones of the same phoneme.) There is also hesitation between the spellings &#x27;sk&#x27; and &#x27;sy&#x27; (both and (&#x27;bamboo&#x27;) are found in the Citumbuka dictionary).

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
The same vowels , , , , and syllabic are found in Tumbuka as in the neighbouring language Chewa.
===Consonants ===
Tumbuka consonants are also similar to those of the neighbouring Chewa language, but with certain differences. The continuant sounds , and , which are absent or marginal in Chewa, are common in Tumbuka. Also common are the palatalised sounds , , , , , , and . In Tumbuka there are no affricates such as Chichewa , , , . The sounds and are never nasalised in Tumbuka, so that Chewa (&#x27;fish&#x27;) = Tumbuka . The sound is found only in foreign words such as (&#x27;shirt&#x27;) and (&#x27;sugar&#x27;). Tumbuka sometimes corresponds to Chewa , for example Chewa &#x27;to be ill&#x27; = Tumbuka , Chewa &#x27;to eat&#x27; = Tumbuka . The pronunciation of &quot;sk&quot; and &quot;zg&quot; varies according to dialect.

Tumbuka consonants are frequently either palatalised (i.e. followed by /y/) or rounded (i.e. followed by /w/.) Some of them can also be preceded by a homorganic nasal (/n/, /ng&#x27;/ or /m/). The possible consonant combinations are shown in the table below:


===Tone===
One of the main differences between Chewa and Tumbuka is that Chewa is a tonal language, whereas in Tumbuka there are no distinctions of tone between one word and another.

Tumbuka has a tonal accent but in a very limited way, in that every word, spoken in isolation, has the same falling tone on the penultimate syllable (which also coincides with stress). It is therefore not possible in Tumbuka to contrast two different words or two different tenses tonally, as it is in Chichewa and other Bantu languages. However, this penultimate falling tone occurs not on every word, but only on the last word of a phonological phrase; e.g. in the following sentence, only the second word has a tone, the first being toneless:
* &#x27;we are cooking porridge&#x27;

A greater variety of tonal patterns is found in the ideophones (expressive words) of Tumbuka; for example Low ( &#x27;disintegrating into small pieces&#x27;), High ( &#x27;swooping low (of birds)&#x27;), High-Low ( &#x27;sound of thing bursting&#x27;), and Low-High ( &#x27;sudden disappearance&#x27;), etc.

Intonational tones are also used in Tumbuka; for example, in yes-no questions there is often a High-Low fall on the final syllable of the question:
* &#x27;are you also weeding the maize?&#x27;

There does not seem to be any consistent, direct correlation between tone in Tumbuka and focus.

==Nouns==
===Noun classes===
As is usual with Bantu languages, Tumbuka nouns are grouped into different noun classes according to their singular and plural prefixes. Each class of noun has its own adjective, pronoun, and verb agreements, known as &#x27;concords&#x27;. Where the agreements disagree with the prefix, the agreements take precedence in deciding the class of noun. For example, the noun &#x27;possessions&#x27;, despite having the prefix &quot;ka-&quot;, is placed in class 1, since one says &#x27;these possessions&#x27; using the class 1 demonstrative . Malawians themselves (e.g. in the University of Malawi&#x27;s Citumbuka dictionary) refer to the noun classes by traditional names such as &quot;Mu-Ŵa-&quot;; Bantu specialists, however, refer to the classes by numbers (1/2 etc.) corresponding to the noun-classes of other Bantu languages. Occasionally nouns do not correspond to the classes below, e.g. &#x27;chief&#x27; (class 9) irregularly has a plural &quot;mafumu&quot; in class 6.

Class 1/2 (Mu-Ŵa-)

Some nouns in this class lack the prefix Mu-:
* pl. = person
* pl. = foreigner, white man
* pl. = child
* pl. = donkey
* pl. = maternal uncle
* (no pl.) = goods, possessions

Class 3/4 (Mu-Mi-)
* pl. = head
* pl. = fig-tree
* pl. = life
* pl. = heart

Class 5/6 (Li-Ma-)
* pl. = breast
* pl. = government, district
* pl. = bottle
* pl. = tribe, nation
* pl. = eye
* (no singular) = water
* pl. = hill
* pl. = problem, trouble
* pl. = hand

Class 7/8 (Ci-Vi-)
* pl. = year
* pl. = country, land
* pl. = farm animal
* pl. = drunkard
* pl. = whip

Class 9/10 (Yi-Zi-)
* pl. = plate
* pl. = money
* pl. = brick
* pl. = chicken
* pl. = fish

Class 11 (Lu-)

Some speakers treat words in this class as if they were in class 5/6.
* = side
* = fame
* = tongue

Class 12/13 (Ka-Tu-)
* pl. = small thing
* pl. = baby
* pl. = bird
* (no singular) = sleep

Class 14/6 (U-Ma-)

These nouns are frequently abstract and have no plural.
* = night
* = farming
* pl. = bridge
* pl. = bow

Class 15 (Ku-) Infinitive
* = to buy, buying
* = to steal, stealing

Classes 16, 17, 18 (Pa-, Ku-, Mu-) Locative
* = underneath
* = in front, before
* = inside

===Concords===
Verbs, adjectives, numbers, possessives, and pronouns in Tumbuka have to agree with the noun referred to. This is done by means of prefixes, infixes, or suffixes called &#x27;concords&#x27; which differ according to the class of noun. Class 1 has the greatest variety of concords, differing for pronouns, subject prefix, object infix, numbers, adjectives, and possessives:
* = this child
* = one child
* = that child
* = the whole child
* = every child
* = the child saw him
* = the small child
* = Khumbo&#x27;s child
* = my child
* = the child has seen

Other noun classes have a smaller variety of concords, as can be seen from the table below:


== Sample phrases and text ==
The following is a list of phrases that can be used when one visits a region whose primary language is Tumbuka:
==Verbs==
===Subject prefix===
All verbs must have a subject prefix, which agrees with the subject noun. For example, the word &#x27;hunter&#x27; is class 7, so if it is subject, the verb has the prefix &quot;ci-&quot;:
: = &#x27;the hunter killed a lion&#x27;

It is also possible for the subject to be a locative noun (classes 16, 17, 18), in which case the verb has a locative prefix:
: = &#x27;on the mat there sat down a child&#x27;

The locative prefix &quot;ku-&quot; (class 17) is also used impersonally when discussing the weather:
: = &#x27;it&#x27;s cold these days&#x27;

When the subject is a personal pronoun, the subject prefixes are as follows (the pronoun itself may be omitted, but not the subject prefix):
: = &#x27;I bought&#x27; (&quot;nkha-&quot; stands for &quot;ni-ka-&quot;)
: = &#x27;you bought&#x27; (informal, singular)
: = &#x27;he, she bought&#x27;
: = &#x27;we bought&#x27;
: = &#x27;you bought&#x27; (plural or respectful)
: = &#x27;they bought&#x27;, &#x27;he/she bought&#x27; (plural or respectful)

In the perfect tense, these are shortened to , e.g. &#x27;we have bought&#x27;.

In Karonga dialect, in the 3rd person singular &quot;a-&quot; is found instead of &quot;wa-&quot;, and the 3rd plural is &quot;wa-&quot; instead of &quot;ŵa-&quot;, except in the perfect tense, when &quot;wa-&quot; and &quot;ŵa-&quot; are used.

===Object-marker===
To indicate the object, an infix can be added to the verb immediately before the verb root. Generally speaking, the object-marker is optional:
: = &#x27;Pokani has bought a car&#x27; (class 9)
: = &#x27;Changa carried the luggage&#x27; (class 1)

The object-marker agrees with the class of the object, as shown on the table of concords above.

The object-marker can also be a locative (classes 16, 17, or 18):
: = &#x27;Kondwani has climbed on top of the house&#x27;

The locative markers for personal pronouns are as follows:
: = &#x27;he has seen me&#x27;
: = &#x27;he has seen you&#x27;
: = &#x27;he has seen him/her&#x27;
: = &#x27;he has seen us&#x27;
: = &#x27;he has seen you&#x27; (plural or respectful)
: = &#x27;he has seen them&#x27;

===Tenses===
Tenses in Tumbuka are made partly by adding infixes, and partly by suffixes. Unlike Chichewa, tones do not form any part of the distinction between one tense and another.

In the past a distinction is made between hodiernal tenses (referring to events of today) and remote tenses (referring to events of yesterday or some time ago). However, the boundary between recent and remote is not exact.

Another distinction is made between past and perfect tenses. When a perfect tense is used it carries an implication that the resulting situation still exists at the time of speaking, for example: &#x27;the pumpkins have spread () over the garden&#x27;. The present perfect can also be used in verbs expressing a current situation such as &#x27;I am sitting&#x27; or &#x27;I am pleased&#x27;. The remote perfect is used for events which happened some time ago but of which the effects still apply today, such as &#x27;the rock has fallen&#x27; or &#x27;he (has) died&#x27;.

The future tenses similarly distinguish near from remote events. Some tenses imply that the event will take place elsewhere, for example &#x27;I will go and visit&#x27;.

Compound tenses are also found in Tumbuka, such as &#x27;he had slept&#x27;, &#x27;he had just left&#x27; and &#x27;he will have sold&#x27;.

Other future tenses are given by Vail (1972) and others.

In the 1st person singular, &quot;ni-ku-&quot; and &quot;ni-ka-&quot; are shortened to &quot;nkhu-&quot; and &quot;nkha-&quot;: &#x27;I am going&#x27;, &#x27;I go&#x27;, &#x27;I used to go&#x27;.

===Negative verbs===
To make the negative of a verb in Tumbuka, the word or is added at or near the end of the clause. It seems that is preferred by younger speakers:
:&#x27;he is not writing a letter&#x27;
:&#x27;we will not work tomorrow&#x27;

With the present perfect tense, however, a separate form exists, adding &quot;-nda-&quot; and ending in &quot;-e&quot;:
:&#x27;yes, I have met him&#x27;
:&#x27;no, I haven&#x27;t met him&#x27;

==The Ngoni influence on Tumbuka==

Words of Ngoni (Zulu/Ndwandwe) origin found in Tumbuka:

All Tumbuka dialects have to some extent been affected by the Ngoni language, most especially in Mzimba District of Malawi. Ngoni is a language that originates from the Ndwandwe people who were neighbours to the Zulu clan prior to being conquered by the Zulu and being assimilated into the Zulu identity. The language the Ndwandwe spoke was thus nearly identical Zulu. Below are some examples of words found in chitumbuka that are of Zulu/Ndwandwe origin, though most of them have original Tumbuka counterpart words that can be used interchangeably at the speakers will, (excluding &#x27;munwe/minwe&#x27; meaning &#x27;finger/fingers&#x27; for example, that seemingly did not have an original counterpart or the original word has been lost). The word njowi is used for finger/s.

==An example of Tumbuka==

Months in Tumbuka:

An example of a folktale translated into Tumbuka and other languages of Northern Malawi is given in the Language Mapping Survey for Northern Malawi carried out by the Centre for Language Studies of the University of Malawi. The Tumbuka version of the folktale goes as follows:
:


:(Translation)
:THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE
:Tortoise went to beg food from people. To carry his bag, he tied it to a long string and wore it round his neck. As he walked along, the bag was coming behind him.

:As he was on his way, Hare came up behind him and said, &quot;There it is, my bag!&quot; Tortoise said &quot;The bag is mine, see this string I&#x27;ve tied now I&#x27;m pulling it as I go.&quot; Hare refused to accept this and said &quot;Let&#x27;s go the Court, so that it can judge us.&quot; The Court examined the case and cut Tortoise&#x27;s string which he&#x27;d tied the bag with. They took that bag and gave it to Hare.

:Another day when Hare was walking along, Tortoise found him and said, &quot;There it is, my tail!&quot; Hare said, &quot;Nonsense, this is my tail, Tortoise.&quot; Tortoise refused to accept this and said, &quot;What I&#x27;ve got is mine.&quot; They went to the Court so that it could make a judgement. In that Court, the case went in Tortoise&#x27;s favour. They cut off Hare&#x27;s tail and gave it to Tortoise.

<text>The Main Directorate of State Security (, Главное управление государственной безопасности, ГУГБ, GUGB) was the name of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most important security body within the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) USSR. At the time of its existence, which was from July 10, 1934 to February 3, 1941, the GUGB reflected exactly the Secret Operational Directorate within OGPU under the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, which operated within OGPU structure from 1923 to 1931/32.
An intelligence service and secret police from July 1934 to February 1941, it was run under the auspices of the Peoples Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD). Its first head was first deputy of People&#x27;s Commissar of Internal Affairs (then Genrikh Yagoda), Commissioner 1st rank of State Security Yakov Agranov.

== History ==
The Main Directorate of State Security evolved from the Joint State Political Directorate (or OGPU). On February 3, 1941, the Special Sections (or OO) of the GUGB-NKVD (responsible for counter-intelligence in the military) became part of the Army and Navy (RKKA and RKKF, respectively). The GUGB was disbanded as an organization within NKVD USSR. The units that operated in GUGB were reorganized and made the core of the newly made People&#x27;s Commissariat of State Security or NKGB.

Following the outbreak of World War II, the NKVD and NKGB were reunited, not as GUGB but as totally separate directorates. On July 20, 1941, Army and Airforce counter-intelligence was returned to the NKVD as Directorate of Special Departments under Viktor Abakumov; in January 1942, Navy CI followed. In April 1943, it was again transferred to the Narkomat of Defence and Narkomat of the Navy, becoming SMERSH (from &quot;Smert&#x27; Shpionam&quot; or &quot;Death to Spies&quot;); at the same time, the GUGB was again separated from the NKVD as NKGB.

== GUGB heads ==
By the end of 1937, the GUGB was the most powerful and influential organ in the NKVD structure. GUGB departments (or Sections) dealt with - intelligence, internal security, counter-intelligence, protection of government and secret communications.&lt;br&gt; The first chief of the GUGB was Yakov Agranov, Commissioner 1st rank of State Security and first deputy of People&#x27;s Commissar of Internal Affairs. The next chief of the GUGB from April 15, 1937, to September 8, 1938, was komkor Mikhail Frinovsky, who was succeeded by Lavrenty Beria, then just promoted to Commissioner 1st rank of State Security. When Beria became People&#x27;s Commissar of Internal Affairs (head of NKVD), Commissioner 3rd rank of State Security Vsevolod Merkulov became his first deputy and the new and final head of GUGB.

== Organization ==
Between 1934 and 1941, the &quot;Main Directorate of State Security&quot; went through several organizational changes. In January 1935, there were nine departments in the GUGB structure:

; (head of GUGB)Commissioner 1st rank of State Security Yakov Agranov
# Operational Department (headed by)Karl Pauker 
# Special DepartmentGleb Bokii
# Department of Economics – (ЭКО/EKO)Lev Mironov
# Special Department – (&quot;OO&quot;)Mark Gai

# Department of Transport – (&quot;ТО&quot;)Vladimir Kichkin
# Department of Information and Statistic – (&quot;УСО&quot;/&quot;USO&quot;)Yakov Genkin
# Staff Department – (&quot;OK&quot;)Yakov Weynschtok

By the end of 1937 the People&#x27;s Commissar of Internal Affairs Nikolai Yezhov, in his order &quot;#00362&quot; had changed the number of departments from five to twelve.

=== GUGB Ranks ===
The GUGB had a unique system of ranks, a blend of the position-rank system used in the Red Army and personal ranks used in the Militsiya; the rank insignia was also very distinct. Even though insignia introduced in 1937 followed the Red Army collar patch patterns, it assigned them to very different ranks for GUGB and Internal Troops/political/specialist branches, with GUGB rank placed at least one grade higher than a similar army equivalent.

When GUGB and Militsiya ranks were replaced with military ranks and insignia in February 1943, Major to Sergeant ranks were aligned with Colonel to Junior Lieutenant, and Senior Major and up were replaced with various degrees of Commissioner. In 1945, General Commissioner Lavrentiy Beria received the rank of the Marshal of the Soviet Union, and other GUGB Commissioners received ranks from Generals of the Army to Major General.

<text>Dieselhed was a San Francisco–based band, originally from Arcata, California.

==Early career==
Dieselhed formed in 1989 in Arcata, California later moving to San Francisco, California, playing a blend of country, punk, and pseudo-classic rock. Drummer Heifetz spread his time between Dieselhed and the genre-bending experimentalists Mr. Bungle. Singer-songwriter Virgil Shaw previously played in Arcata outfit Brent&#x27;s T.V. Bassist Ellis had been a founding member of the local disbanded funk rock band Psychefunkapus, and Jonathan Segel was a former member of local indie-faves Camper Van Beethoven.

The band signed a recording contract with independent label Amarillo Records in the early 1990s. Dieselhed released three full-length albums for Amarillo while maintaining a national touring schedule throughout the 1990s, often accompanied by road manager John Tynan.

Dieselhed&#x27;s self-titled 1993 debut was received well, leading to a modest spurt of college radio airplay. The band wound up selling out Amarillo&#x27;s first two pressings of the album. Their second album, &quot;Tales of a Brown Dragon&quot;, came out in 1995 and helped to expand their growing fan base. Dieselhed became regulars at the SXSW music festival held each year in Austin, Texas. Their third album, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Shallow Water Blackout&quot;, was produced by Dwight Yoakam engineer Dusty Wakeman. Dieselhed followed their 1997 release with two U.S. tours opening for Link Wray. For these dates Ellis and Heifitz would return to the stage after their opening set each night to back Wray. The two would go on to become Wray&#x27;s regular backing band from 1997 to 2003.

==Later years==
In 1998 Dieselhed signed a new contract with Bong Load Records, a label still riding the success of their recording and release of Beck&#x27;s critically acclaimed gold record &quot;Mellow Gold&quot;. Dieselhed issued &quot;Elephant Rest Home&quot; in 1998 (a collection of previously unreleased songs) and their final album, the rarely seen &quot;Chico and the Flute&quot; in 2000 on Bong Load before disbanding later in 2000.

Lead songwriter Virgil Shaw went on to release two critically acclaimed solo albums, &quot;Quad Cities&quot; and &quot;Still Falling&quot;, for San Francisco&#x27;s independent label Future Farmer Records. Co-songwriter Zac Holtzman now plays in the Los Angeles–based band Dengue Fever. Danny Heifetz, now raising a family in Australia, stays busy with local studio session work and drum lessons. Atom Ellis resides between San Francisco and Los Angeles and performs as bassist with Neil Hamburger, The New Cars and The Tubes. Guitarist Shon McAllin is currently a licensed contractor residing in the deep woods of Northern California.

<text>Anne Marie DeCicco-Best (born April 1964) was the 60th and longest-serving mayor of London, Ontario, Canada.

==Early life and family==
DeCicco graduated from Fanshawe College&#x27;s broadcast journalism program in 1986 and worked for CHYR in Leamington, Ontario, before returning in 1987 to work at CJBK and CJBX, a country music station in London as a reporter covering city hall. From 1994 to 1997, while serving on city council, she was a part-time instructor in a communications course at Fanshawe College.

==Career==
DeCicco was first elected to London City Council in 1991 as a councillor in Ward Five, becoming the youngest person ever to serve there, after former Ward Five councillor Grant Hopcroft made the jump to the Board of Control.

In 1996 she was a supporter of London&#x27;s bid for the 2001 Canada Summer Games, which were subsequently awarded to London. In 1997, after two, three-year terms as a ward councillor, she topped the polls when she was elected to the London Board of Control and acted as deputy mayor and budget chief to Dianne Haskett, whom she succeeded as mayor in the 2000 election. She was re-elected to a second term in 2003.

She also serves on the board of governors of the University of Western Ontario (UWO) and the London Police Services Board.

On June 17, 2006, DeCicco married Tim Best, a 44-year-old native Londoner who&#x27;d previously lived in Texas, that she first met at the John Labatt Centre in downtown London during the 2005 Memorial Cup hockey championship.

On November 13, 2006, DeCicco-Best was re-elected for a third consecutive term as the mayor of London in the 2006 municipal election. Her main opponent was former London North Centre Liberal Member of Parliament Joe Fontana. Her victory in this election, with its four-year term mandated by the province of Ontario, made DeCicco-Best the longest-serving mayor in London&#x27;s history, in office for 10 consecutive years.

On October 25, 2010, Fontana defeated DeCicco-Best in the 2010 municipal election to become the mayor of London.

DeCicco-Best currently works for Fanshawe College assisting with public relations.

==Criticisms==

DeCicco-Best was heavily criticized for the actions of her husband, who opened up a &quot;for profit&quot; check-cashing business outside the city&#x27;s welfare office, was charged with six criminal counts, including impaired driving causing bodily harm, sentenced to six months in jail.

==Jewish National Fund==

The Jewish National Fund of London honoured Anne Marie DeCicco-Best as its 2011 London Negev Dinner Honouree. As London&#x27;s longest-serving Mayor (2000-2010) and member of London City Council for 19 years, DeCicco-Best was recognized for her dedicated contributions to the community throughout her many years of public service, and her unwavering support of the Jewish community.

<doc id="1232635" wikidata="Q1038239" url="?curid=1232635" title="Rugal Bernstein">
<text>is a video game character created by SNK. First introduced in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, he is a recurring boss in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; fighting game series, appearing in some titles as an enhanced version called . As the host of the tournaments from &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; and &quot;″95&quot;, Rugal plans to turn all the competitors from the tournament into stone statues as part of his collection. Despite his death in &quot;″95&quot;, Rugal is still featured in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; titles which do not contain a storyline (nicknamed &quot;Dream Matches&quot;). He has also been featured in the &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; series as a boss character.

His character has also appeared in other media related to &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; franchise, including comic adaptations and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; live-action film, and portrayed by British martial arts actor Ray Park. As the first boss character from &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, the SNK staff created him to be one of the most difficult characters to defeat. His Omega Rugal form from &quot;″95&quot; has been noted by the staff to be their favorite boss to the point they added him in the Dream Match titles. Publications for video games and other media have provided praise and criticism for Rugal&#x27;s character.

==Conception and design==
During development of &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, several final boss designs were considered, including a masked dominatrix with a spiked whip, a long haired gentleman in a formal suit, and an early sketch of a muscular man wearing a mask and checkerboard sash around his waist. The concept for making Rugal was to make &quot;the biggest, baddest, most evil villain imaginable,&quot; due to the planning team&#x27;s love of villains, and as his character evolved a planned in-game team consisting of series bosses Geese Howard and Wolfgang Krauser was scrapped to further highlight him. The stage you fight him in was meant to reflect his personality, and at one point they considered it to be a giant mecha modeled after his appearance, before switching to an aircraft carrier. Rugal has been described by developers as &quot;He&#x27;s the only character who truly represents the ultimate &quot;KOF&quot; boss&quot; and has become the boss character with the biggest number of appearances in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, becoming a favorite character among both the developers and series artist Falcoon. The character&#x27;s popularity has continued even to his appearance in &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;, with artist Tomohiro Nakata surprised by how acclaimed the decision to include Rugal was. Due to his multiple &quot;deaths&quot; in the series, developers jokingly added the hobby &quot;resurrection&quot; to his official profile.

Standing 1.97 m (6 ft 5 in) tall, Rugal is a tall, blonde and athletic man with a thin mustache and his right eye missing. His normal outfit consists of a red formal tailcoat suit with black accents, fingerless gloves, a black cummerbund and ribbon tie, and a white shirt underneath. This outfit has been used for most of his casual appearances, including crossover titles such as &quot;Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000&quot; and its sequel. In &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, when he is defeated the first time he will toss away most of his upper clothes, now wearing a black sleeveless undershirt with his suspenders dangling loose while, and fighting more seriously.

In &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot;, though other options were considered Rugal returned as the game&#x27;s final boss with a modified design. Many ideas were considered for this version, including having him fight shirtless with a tattoo of a leopard covering his left arm and pectoral, a design with armor embedded into his flesh, and another featuring heavy cybernetic implants, with goggles covering his eyes and wires extending from his arms into his chest. A more outlandish design, called &quot;Rugal Infinity&quot;, would have featured his body merged with Geese and Krauser, appearing as a six armed naked man with the other two men&#x27;s faces sticking out of the sides of his head, akin to depictions of the god Ashura. Dubbing him &quot;Omega Rugal&quot;, they ultimately settled on an appearance similar to his &quot;King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; counterpart, but with his upper body having burst from his clothing, wild white hair, cybernetic prosthetics replacing his right hand and eye, and the Greek letter &quot;Ω&quot; tattooed on his back. Director Masanori Kuwasashi was in charge of the making of this version of the character, aiming to give loose ends with the Orochi demon explored in the series&#x27; first story. Omega Rugal later returned in &quot;King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot;, his design changed with the developers focusing on using his secondary &#x27;serious&#x27; appearance in &quot;″94&quot; as a base, while retaining the cybernetic red eye. This served as Omega Rugal&#x27;s look from that game onwards with minimal modifications and additions, such as a costume variant adding a red longcoat and armored shoulderpads in &quot;XV&quot; as an unlockable reward for defeating him as a boss.

==Appearances==
===In video games===
Rugal was introduced in the 1994 game &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, as a megalomaniac arms dealer inviting fighters from all over the world to fight in his martial arts tournament, seeking worthy opponents and turning those he defeats into stone statues for his throne room. Protagonist Kyo Kusanagi and his teammates make it to the finals, where he finds his father Saisyu has already fought against Rugal and suffered a mortal blow. Angered, Kyo defeats him, but Rugal activates a self destruct sequence in an attempt to kill him. In &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot;, Rugal organizes a new King of Fighters tournament to take revenge on Kyo. To this end, Rugal revives and brainwashes Kyo&#x27;s father to kill him. After Saisyu is knocked unconscious, Rugal fights them in an enhanced form named Omega Rugal. Once defeated, his body is unable to handle the stress, and as his body disintegrates declares he will return. Omega Rugal later returns in &quot;dream match&quot; &quot;King of Fighters&quot; titles, non-canon entries in the series, serving as the final boss for both &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters 2002&quot;, and appearing as an optional boss in their subsequent remakes. In &quot;The King of Fighters 2000&quot;, Rugal appears as a non-playable assistant character (dubbed a &quot;striker&quot;) to Kula Diamond. After the events of &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, Rugal is revived and returns as a playable character and optional boss in downloadable content for &quot;King of Fighters XV&quot;.

In pachinslot games including The King of Fighters Pachinslot and KOF Fatal Fury pachinko games, Rugal appears.

In other fighting games, Rugal appears as the final boss of &quot;King of Fighters R-2&quot; for the NeoGeo Pocket Color, a chibi parody of &quot;King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot; in which he is creating clones of other fighters, and upon defeat self-destructs his aircraft carrier with a cartoon bomb. In crossover titles, Rugal appears in both &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; titles, and as an optional boss fight. In it, a cutscene shows Rugal and &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Akuma fighting, with the former defeating the latter and absorbing his essence before casting him aside. This version of Rugal, dubbed &quot;God Rugal&quot; (&quot;Ultimate Rugal&quot; in western releases), appears in a disheveled version of his suit with darkened skin, both his eyes and right hand glowing a bright red, and gains access to several of Akuma&#x27;s attacks. When defeated, Rugal tries to continue to fight but the stolen essence overtakes him much to his shock, transforming him into a being resembling Akuma before vanishing.

Outside of fighting games, he appears on cards for &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot; and its sequels, as well as &quot;VersusTCG&quot;, a physical trading card game based on the first game. In mobile games, he appears as a boss in a &quot;King of Fighters&quot; themed event for &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;.

===Gameplay===
When designing his gameplay, flagship director Toyohisa Tanabe stated that his fighting style was created to emphasize Rugal&#x27;s strength as the series&#x27; first boss character. He also comments &quot;going a bit overboard&quot; with his Genocide Cutter technique damage ratio in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;. His Dead-End Screamer special move was originally a technique in which Rugal breaks the neck of his opponent and crushes it. However, it was seen as lacking drama, so it evolved into a move in which he breaks his victim&#x27;s neck, crushes the victim, and then further spins the victim around to do more damage, striking a pose at the end of the move. In addition an idea was planned for him to be able to instantly learn and utilize any attack used against him. However this feature was abandoned due to memory restraints, and his use of Kaiser Wave and Reppuken, moves belonging to Krauser and Geese respectively, is a remnant of this concept. His &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot; move set was noted to be strongest of all his appearances, and was carried forward to &quot;XV&quot; with his playable version having slightly different moves to balance the character.

===In other media===
Aside from the main series, Rugal has also appeared in other media from the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series. Rugal appears in the first chapter from the spin-off manga &quot;The King of Fighters: Kyo&quot;, showing his fight against Kyo Kusanagi from &quot;King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot;. In 1995, the character was voiced by Banjō Ginga in the Dengeki Bunko-produced CD drama &quot;The King of Fighters - King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, a retelling of the story from the video games. In the manhua &quot;The King of Fighters: Zillion&quot;, one of the stories is based on &quot;King of Fighters 2002&quot;, in which Rugal confronts another lead character from the series, K&#x27;.

In the 2010 live-action film adaptation of &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, Rugal is played by veteran actor Ray Park.

==Reception and cultural impact==

Rugal&#x27;s high difficulty in &quot;King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, notably during his second phase, led to fighting game fans coining the term &quot;SNK Boss syndrome&quot;, in reference to when a computer-controlled opponent in a fighting game is extremely difficult to play against to the point of feeling &quot;outright broken&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; cited that his attacks copied from other fighters gave him a &quot;formidable foundation&quot;, and that his own suite of attacks coupled with his lore of killing defeated opponents by turning them into statues them made him &quot;the ultimate boss&quot;. Darren Bonthuys of &quot;GameSpot&quot; called him &quot;the boss of bosses&quot;, stating that he played like a culmination of every previous boss in other SNK fighting games, &quot;but better&quot;. &quot;1UP.com&quot; described his Omega Rugal design as &quot;one of the most stylish boss designs in fighting history, although more than a few gamers grew to hate the sight of him,&quot; and praised his absence in &quot;King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot;. However, the magazine &quot;RetroManiac&quot; called him &quot;one of the most charismatic bosses in the saga&quot;, and praised his inclusion in even handheld versions of &quot;King of Fighters&quot;. Eliot Lefebvre of &quot;Dualshockers&quot; in turn named him one of fighting game&#x27;s most iconic characters, stating that his high difficulty coupled with his lore made him an exception amongst fighting game villains in that he was as memorable as the player characters themselves. He further added that even in cases where Rugal was playable, &quot;Rugal is remembered as a boss.&quot;

Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; praised Rugal&#x27;s character as a villain, comparing him to Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; antagonists with &quot;He’s what M. Bison wishes he could be,&quot; and &quot;he proves that as great as Akuma is, his power is better wielded by a megalomaniac with the gift of style and swagger.&quot; Going into more detail with the latter, he added that while other crossover fighting games such as &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot; would routinely feature a &quot;merged&quot; villain from their respective franchises, Rugal&#x27;s approach of stealing Akuma&#x27;s techniques and how he utilized them with his own style set him apart. He further praised Rugal by stating despite all incarnations of the character being incredibly difficult to fight, &quot;the dude has so much swagger and radiates such coolness that I can’t hate him. He’s Rugal &quot;Goddamn&quot; Bernstein and we’re better for knowing him.&quot; Jasper noted that while Rugal returned for &quot;dream match&quot; games in the series, in his eyes solidifying himself as &quot;THE villain of &quot;King of Fighters&quot;&quot;, he felt the character didn&#x27;t wear out his welcome. Instead he stated Rugal was defined as much by his weakness as his strengths, namely in regards to his deaths in the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; and &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; titles due to absorbing too much power, describing it as &quot;classic villainy&quot;.

In Mexico where the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; franchise is extremely popular, Rugal&#x27;s presence as a playable character has led to his picture being plastered on arcade cabinets with a statement not to select him, specifically stating &quot;Prohibido jugar con Rugal&quot; (lit. &quot;Forbidden to play with Rugal&quot;). A Spanish scholarly paper discussing human nature and the social norms of sportsmanlike conduct also mentioned Rugal in this context, and political figure Jaime Rodríguez Calderón specifically asked people not to use him when suggesting they play &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; among other video games during a &quot;Game Day&quot; celebration. However Brazilian anthropology researcher Deyse Brandão in a dissertation cited Rugal as an example of a popular nickname amongst young students in her country, in the same vein as &quot;Stark&quot; or &quot;Naruto&quot;, with the students applying the character&#x27;s symbolism towards themselves as a form of identity.

<text>John Dudley Leyton (born 17 February 1936) is an English retired actor and singer. 

Leyton as a singer is best known for his hit song &quot;Johnny Remember Me&quot; (written by Geoff Goddard and produced by Joe Meek), which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in August 1961 despite being banned by the BBC for its death references. His follow-up single, &quot;Wild Wind&quot;, reached number two in the same chart.

Alongside singing, Leyton&#x27;s acting career saw him appearing in television and films throughout the 1960s. His films included &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;Guns at Batasi&quot;, &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; and &quot;Krakatoa, East of Java&quot;. In 2009, he also had a small role in the film &quot;&quot;, a biopic based on Joe Meek&#x27;s life in which Leyton himself was portrayed by Callum Dixon.

==Career==
Leyton went to Highgate School and after completing his national service with the Royal Army Service Corps, he studied drama, paying his way through drama school with bit-part roles in films and on television. His first major acting role was his portrayal of Ginger in a 1960 Granada TV adaptation of &quot;Biggles&quot;, which earned him a large following of young female fans and led to the formation of a John Leyton fan club.

===Singer-actor===
Following the success of &quot;Biggles&quot;, Leyton was persuaded by his manager, Robert Stigwood, to audition as a singer for record producer Joe Meek, and subsequently recorded a cover version of &quot;Tell Laura I Love Her&quot;, which was released on the Top Rank label. In 1961 though, the Top Rank label was taken over by EMI who then issued Leyton&#x27;s records on their His Master&#x27;s Voice label. EMI had already released Ricky Valance&#x27;s version of the same song. Leyton&#x27;s recording was withdrawn from sale, whilst Valance&#x27;s version reached number one in the UK chart.

A second single, &quot;The Girl on the Floor Above&quot;, was released on His Master&#x27;s Voice, but was not a success. His first big hit, &quot;Johnny Remember Me&quot;, coincided with his appearance as an actor in the popular ATV television series &quot;Harpers West One&quot;, in which he played a singer named Johnny Saint Cyr. Leyton performed &quot;Johnny Remember Me&quot; during the show (backed by the Outlaws), and the single subsequently charted at Number 1. His next single, &quot;Wild Wind&quot;, reached number two in the UK Singles Chart, and later singles also achieved lower chart positions.

On 15 April 1962, Leyton performed at the &quot;NME&quot; Poll-Winners Concert at London&#x27;s Wembley Pool. But in 1963, Meek and Goddard&#x27;s association with Leyton ended; that circumstance, combined with the British beat boom, cast Leyton adrift immediately, although he found a lot of acting work in television and film to keep him busy. Despite trying to give Leyton&#x27;s music more of a &#x27;group&#x27; sound by giving him a backing group, The LeRoys, his chart career faded out by the beginning of 1964. In that same year, according to the music journalist Bob Stanley, &#x27;Leyton headlined a tour with up and coming support act the Rolling Stones. Very quickly, it became apparent that the Stones were more popular than the headline act and Leyton, with great dignity, abandoned his pop career on the spot to concentrate on acting.&#x27;

===Heyday as an actor===
Leyton was a familiar face in film and television during the 1960s. He played himself in the 1962 Dick Lester film &quot;It&#x27;s Trad, Dad!&quot;, performing his latest single &quot;Lonely City&quot; in a radio studio. In &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963), he played tunnel designer Willie Dickes, one of the only three characters to reach freedom. Leyton also cut a single with lyrics to Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s theme to the film. He also appeared in &quot;Guns at Batasi&quot; in 1964, &quot;Every Day&#x27;s a Holiday&quot; (aka &quot;Seaside Swingers&quot; in the United States) and &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; starring Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard in 1965. In &quot;Krakatoa, East of Java&quot;, in 1969, he played the designer of a diving bell. From 1966 to 1967, Leyton played the lead role as Special Operations Executive (SOE) Royal Navy Lieutenant Nicholas Gage, an expert in demolitions, in &quot;Jericho&quot;, an American TV series about espionage in the Second World War.

===Later career===
Leyton returned to Britain in the early 1970s and tried to re-launch his singing career, signing to the York record label in 1973. A single, &quot;Dancing in the Graveyard&quot; c/w. &quot;Riversong&quot; (York SYK 551) and an album, &quot;John Leyton&quot; (York FYK 416) were released that year. A year later, Leyton&#x27;s cover version of the Kevin Johnson hit, &quot;Rock and Roll (I Gave You the Best Years of My Life)&quot;, (York YR 210) was issued in the UK but without success. In the mid 1970s, Leyton starred in the ITV television series, &quot;The Nearly Man&quot;. Acting roles became fewer and farther between during the 1970s, and by the early 1980s, he was no longer active in show business.

In the 1990s, Leyton began performing in the &quot;Solid Gold Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Show&quot;, appearing with artists such as Marty Wilde and Joe Brown. The 2004 tour featured Leyton, Showaddywaddy, Freddy Cannon and Craig Douglas. Leyton has also returned to acting, with a cameo appearance in the 2005 film, &quot;Colour Me Kubrick&quot; starring John Malkovich.

In May 2006, Leyton released &quot;Hi Ho, Come On England&quot;, a re-working of Jeff Beck&#x27;s &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot;, to coincide with the World Cup in Germany. During the summer of 2007, he filmed a cameo appearance for the Nick Moran film, &quot;Telstar&quot;. Leyton also topped the bill at the Theatre Royal, Windsor, along with 1960s stars Jess Conrad and Craig Douglas, at a concert named &#x27;60s Icons&#x27;.

Leyton continues to tour the UK and Scandinavia performing his hits (sometimes backed by the Rapiers) and can boast an internet following with his official website. In 2014, he continued to tour with his band, the Flames, featuring John Burleigh on guitar, Ray Royal on drums and Charlie Gardner on bass guitar and Jeff Jeffereys on rhythm guitar.

Leyton married Diana in 1967 and they had a son, Dominic and daughter, Lara.

<text>Friedrich Conrad Dietrich Wyneken (May 13, 1810 – May 4, 1876) was a missionary pastor in the United States. He also served for fourteen years as the second president of the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod, and helped found Concordia Theological Seminary.

One hundred years after fellow Hanoverian Henry Muhlenberg brought together the pastors and congregations of colonial America, Wyneken worked with C. F. W. Walther to gather scattered German Protestants into confessional Lutheran congregations and forge them into a closely knit family of churches. Wyneken&#x27;s missionary experience, method, and plan influenced American Lutheran missions for many years to come. His appeals to Wilhelm Loehe and other German friends brought many German pastors, including Wilhelm Sihler, from Germany to America. He has been called the &quot;thunder after the lightning.&quot; He is commemorated on the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod on May 4.

Considered a &quot;tireless&quot; church worker by others, Wyneken confessed, rather, that he &quot;suffered horribly from melancholy&quot;.

==Early life and family and education==

Wyneken was born to Pastor Heinrich Christoph Wyneken and Anne Catherine Louise Wyneken Meyer on May 13, 1810, in Verden an der Aller in the Kingdom of Westphalia. Some of the earlier Wynekens and their relatives were minor government officials in the Duchy of Bremen-Verden when it was under Swedish control. The Wyneken family had an established Lutheran heritage long before Friedrich arrived in America. Heinrich Wyneken&#x27;s father, grandfather, and one brother were pastors in Hanover. Two of Friedrich Wyneken&#x27;s older brothers also became pastors. Significant numbers of more distant relatives and in-laws were also Lutheran clergy members, such as Superintendent Hans Heinrich Justus Phillip Ruperti, (1833–1899), who was Friedrich&#x27;s nephew.

Other Wyneken relatives had military careers in the Electorate of Hanover and others would serve in army of the Kingdom of Hanover. Friedrich Wyneken&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a Rittmeister stationed in Verden. Wyneken&#x27;s second cousin Christian Wilhelm August Johann Ernst Wyneken (1783–1853) fought in the King&#x27;s German Legion in Spain and at the Battle of Waterloo and later became a Lieutenant General in the Hanoverian Army and led a German contingent in the First Schleswig War. Much later a third cousin, Hans Kannengiesser (1880–1970), would fight at Gallipoli and later become a generalleutnant.

Wyneken was baptized on May 22, 1810, by his father at St. Andreas Church in Verden. Heinrich Wyneken died five years later, leaving eleven children and a widow behind. Friedrich attended the gymnasium in Verden. At the age of 17 he went to the University of Göttingen but soon enrolled at the University of Halle. Neither of these institutions had a reputation for the dogmatic Lutheran orthodoxy which Wyneken was later to embrace; rather they both promoted strong rationalistic viewpoints. At Halle, Wyneken became a student of August Tholuck, a skilled linguist and a believer in the personal religious experience.

After graduation, Wyneken worked as a private instructor in Lesum (now a locality of Bremen) at the home of Consistorial Counsellor Georg von Henfstengel, himself an &quot;Awakened&quot; pastor. During this time Wyneken became more influenced by the &quot;Erweckungsbewegung&quot; (&quot;Awakening&quot; movement) led by August Tholuck. He was ordained in Stade along with his fellow theology student E. W. Wolff on May 8, 1837, and soon the pair secured free passage to America from an &quot;Awakened&quot; sea-captain, Stuerge, and the blessing of the Stade Bible and Mission Society.

==Emigration to America==
In early 1838, Wyneken sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and arrived in Baltimore, Maryland. He noted that the following year, 5000 fellow Germans arrived weekly in the relatively nearby port of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alone, most fleeing economic hardship, warfare, and political repression in the various German states—and that emigration would continue until the American Civil War. Wyneken worked in Baltimore helping the ailing Rev. Johann Heaesbaert and a mixed congregation of Lutherans and Reformed (Moravians) for about a year.

Then, as his mentor recovered, the Pennsylvania Ministerium of Lutherans sent Wyneken westward to serve the many Protestant German farmers who had moved into Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he met C. F. Schmidt, editor of &quot;Lutherische Kirchenzeitung&quot;, who would become a friend and supporter, but continued his evangelism westward. In Putnam and Allen counties in Ohio, Wyneken found Lutherans who had not heard a sermon in years, so he baptized many children, and decided to tell his fellow ministers still in Germany about the massive need for their ministry in the New World. However, first he ministered to Germans in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the nearby settlement of Friedheim, Preble Township, in northwest Adams County, whose pastor, Jesse Hoover, had died in May 1838. Then he made Fort Wayne, a portage and canal town, his base, and traveled among the isolated settlements on the Michigan Road to the north as well as in central Indiana and western Ohio.

He joined the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of the West (despite misgivings about its ecumenical stance), and also appealed to the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States of North America for more clergy, especially for the frustrating missionary survey work, when the isolated German protestants wanted to establish their own church communities. While the General Synod did not have resources, various missionary societies in Germany did. Already in 1840, the Bremen (missionary) Society for Protestant Germans had sent two missionary pastors to America, and they sent another five in 1842.

On August 31, 1841, he married Sophia Marie Wilhelmine Buuch (1824–1891), daughter of the first settler in Friedheim. That same year, the Stade missionary society sent G. Jensen to cover Wyneken&#x27;s pastoral responsibilities at St. Paul&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Fort Wayne while he and his wife returned to Germany for medical treatment of a throat ailment. There, Wyneken published (English translation: &quot;The Distress of the German Lutherans in North America&quot;). This, together with his personal contacts and correspondence with Wilhelm Loehe as well as mission societies in Hanover, Bremen, Erlangen, Breslau, Leipzig, and Berlin over the next year while he received medical treatment (and began raising his first child), inspired many German ministers and theology students (22 trained by Loehe himself) to emigrate to America.

While Wyneken returned to the United States in May 1843 with Adolf Biewend (who soon accepted a call from a congregation near Washington, D.C.), Loehe and Rev. Johann Friedrich Wucherer worked in Germany to send missionaries to North America, publishing . In 1845, Wyneken became the delegate of the Synod of the West to the General Synod. He then accepted a call of a Baltimore congregation, where he served for five years, then moved to St. Louis for four years.

Wyneken worked with C. F. W. Walther, who had founded Concordia Seminary in St. Louis and had become the first president of the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod. Wyneken succeeded Walther and served as the Missouri Synod&#x27;s second president for 14 years.

==Later life and death==
When Wyneken&#x27;s health declined, he moved to Cleveland and assisted his son, who was also a pastor, for a decade. He then traveled to California, where his daughter lived and where he hoped the climate would help his health. Friedrich Conrad Dietrich Wyneken died in San Francisco on May 4, 1876. His son-in-law, Pastor Buehler, preached at the emotional funeral.

<text>A national recreation area (NRA) is a protected area in the United States established by an Act of Congress to preserve enhanced recreational opportunities in places with significant natural and scenic resources. There are 40 NRAs, which emphasize a variety of activities for visitors, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing, swimming, biking, horseback riding, and wildlife viewing, in areas that include multiple-use management for both conservation and limited utilization of natural resources. They have diverse features and contexts, being established around reservoirs, in urban areas, and within forests. Due to their size, diversity of activities, and proximity to population centers, NRAs are among the most visited units of the National Park System, with six among the thirty most visited sites.

The first NRA was Lake Mead National Recreation Area, which was created by a 1936 agreement between the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), which had built Hoover Dam, and the National Park Service (NPS), which had experience in managing visitors in the outdoors. Because the reservoir had disturbed the natural state of the environment, a new designation was devised that allowed for more intensive land use while maintaining the NPS&#x27;s role in conservation and historic preservation. The system of NRAs grew as the USBR constructed more dams near urban areas where there was a need for outdoor recreation.

NRAs are managed by the NPS, the United States Forest Service (USFS), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Of the NPS&#x27;s 18 sites, 12 are based around large reservoirs emphasizing water recreation, 5 are near urban areas and include both historic preservation and outdoor recreation, and the last is at a river where a reservoir was planned but not built. Of the USFS&#x27;s 22 sites, 5 are at or near reservoirs, and the rest are other exemplary recreation sites within national forests.

The 40 NRAs are located in 26 states; California and Washington have the most, each with four. NRAs of the USFS have a total area of , and those of the NPS total . The BLM&#x27;s one NRA is approximately .

==History==
=== Origin ===

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation was planning the construction of Boulder Dam (now Hoover Dam) on the Colorado River in the late 1920s and saw the potential for recreation at the scenic area in Nevada and Arizona around the future Lake Mead, to then be the world&#x27;s largest reservoir. The car was expanding access to travel in the growing Southwest and the USBR wanted to bring about the outdoor activities that would be enabled by its enormous project, but it lacked the experience and desire to provide facilities and services for recreation. Following the controversy of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir that flooded a scenic valley in Yosemite National Park, the National Park Service sought to balance its conservation and recreation efforts with dams, and it could provide the expertise for such visitor infrastructure at the Boulder Canyon Project.

A proposed Virgin National Park in that region promoted by Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur was praised for its scenic and historic resources but rejected in 1930 by NPS Director Horace M. Albright due to a reservoir&#x27;s inherent lack of a natural landscape expected for a national park. The political leaders at the Department of the Interior nevertheless wanted to manage the significant lands for tourism and recreation. Farming interests in the Arizona Strip area also wanted to keep their grazing access to the public lands. A 1932 study by Yellowstone National Park superintendent Roger Toll evaluated the region and recognized some sites of interest but again dismissed it as inconsistent with national parks&#x27; and monuments&#x27; standards and purpose of preservation. Separately that year the secretary&#x27;s advisor Louis C. Cramton led further studies of the area between the dam site and Grand Canyon National Park and recommended the creation of Grand Canyon National Monument (II) for the pristine upstream eastern section; it would later be incorporated into the park. Cramton proposed that the western section, which had less spectacular scenery, the dam and reservoir, livestock grazing, and mining, but nationally important recreational importance, be designated as the &quot;Boulder Canyon National Reservation&quot;, consistent with terminology used in the National Park Service Organic Act. A bill to establish it was introduced in Congress in 1933 with mixed support and failed to advance, while Albright reluctantly agreed to support the USBR with visitor services.

As part of the New Deal, President Franklin D. Roosevelt strongly promoted tourism to a growing NPS, with increased emphasis on recreation at facilities constructed by the job-creating Civilian Conservation Corps. The Park Service, now under Director Arno B. Cammerer, took advantage of federal funds to claim the reservoir area and highlight natural features and development needs. Despite the lack of legislation establishing the reservation, the USBR&#x27;s inability to manage the influx of tourists at the newly finished Lake Mead led Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes to direct for negotiation of a memorandum of agreement that gave the NPS responsibility for the reserved lands and surface of the lake, but not Boulder Dam itself, maintaining mining and grazing so long as they did not disrupt recreation. Ickes signed it on October 13, 1936, establishing the Boulder Dam Recreation Area, and the NPS quickly built significant infrastructure for sightseeing visitors and contracted with concessionaires. This was a major compromise and precedent that expanded the Park Service&#x27;s mission beyond the strict conservation of national parks and monuments to include broader outdoor recreation that coexists with other land uses.

=== Further development ===
The Park, Parkway, and Recreation Area Study Act of 1936 had the NPS analyze the needs for outdoor recreation and collaborate with state and local governments, officially expanding its mission beyond national parks. With skepticism remaining among agency veterans, planning at the area still emphasized scenery and preservation. The Act&#x27;s mandates and provision for interagency cooperation however resulted in more versatile land acquisition as the NPS defined its mission. In the 1940s, under the leadership of associate director Conrad L. Wirth, the NPS prepared a National Recreation Plan and conducted a number of studies with the USBR and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) assessing the natural impact, recreational opportunities, and significance of proposed reservoirs.

In 1947 the Boulder Dam Recreation Area was renamed Lake Mead National Recreation Area and expanded to include Lake Mohave above the USBR&#x27;s new Davis Dam. This interagency partnership was successful in creating many recreation areas at reservoirs: nine more were created by agreement with USBR and two more with other dam agencies in the next two decades under the leadership of Wirth as director. However, it contributed to the controversial proposals of Echo Park Dam and Bridge Canyon Dam in existing NPS areas that were canceled after considerable opposition from environmentalists.

These new sites were mainly designated as just &quot;recreation areas&quot; since they did not necessarily have national significance. Several would be transferred to the United States Forest Service and other agencies, being more efficient for management. USFS took over Shasta Lake Recreation Area in Shasta National Forest in 1948 as its first. The Forest Service had traditionally focused on forestry for timber and custodial management, and the 1950s saw debate among the agencies, extraction interests, and conservationists as demand for recreation increased the need for multiple-use planning. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 for the first time established recreation as well as wildlife as an equal priority for the Forest Service with range, timber, and watershed oversight.

The Park Service took a utilitarian approach to its recreation areas, acknowledging their less-than-national significance and focused on providing useful facilities and allowing a wider range of activities. Through the 1950s, many traditionalists at the NPS saw recreation areas championed by Wirth as distractions with open questions of how to manage and square them with the broader aims of the agency. As increased visitation forced answers to these, Lake Mead served as a model for administration at other recreational units, experiencing changing demands of the public, with more day-use visitors. Wirth advocated for changing the Lake Mead&#x27;s designation to &quot;national recreation park,&quot; which would emphasize its importance with autonomy from the USBR. His Mission 66 vision provided capital investment for construction of visitor services and infrastructure across the park system.

=== Standardization and expansion ===
In 1963, the Recreation Advisory Council, created by executive order of President John F. Kennedy and composed of five major government officials, issued a policy that recognized the need for and established criteria for establishing NRAs. The council recommended that NRAs should focus on growing &quot;recreation demand&quot; more than preservation, conservation, or development; have significant natural and recreational quality greater than that of state lands, even if not as unique as other parts of the National Park System; and provide opportunity for recreation consistent with other federal public lands programs. It outlined seven mandatory criteria and six secondary criteria for establishing NRAs, including a minimum size, ability to attract a significant number of visitors from nearby and beyond its state, and filling a regional need with recreation as the dominant purpose. The policy also called for national recreation areas to be established by acts of Congress and for them to be able to be managed by multiple agencies as necessary, including as partnerships with states. The Bureau of Outdoor Recreation (rather than the NPS) was charged with studying proposals and referring them to the council for recommendation. This process gave flexibility to the NPS and USFS to develop their own guidelines for unmet future recreational needs.

In response Congress made Lake Mead National Recreation Area the first such area to be established by statute in October 1964, finally resolving the complicated co-management of USBR land as sole NPS jurisdiction. It eventually codified most of the existing recreation areas under the new national designation (Lake Roosevelt and Curecanti NRAs are the only NPS areas that have not been permanently established by Congress or the president). Lake Mead is still the largest NRA and is the most visited among those at reservoirs. The first new NRA under USFS administration was Spruce Knob–Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area, established in 1965. Congress initially authorized Delaware Water Gap NRA in 1965 with the expectation that the Tocks Island Reservoir would serve the New York and Philadelphia areas as the first NRA east of the Mississippi River, but local and environmental opposition led to the dam&#x27;s cancellation. The NRA remains as the forested area intended to be flooded by the Delaware River. Mount Rogers NRA was also delayed and downsized, losing a planned reservoir and ski area.

A 1968 NPS publication outlined policies for administration of recreational areas, which were distinct from its natural and historical areas. This included not only NRAs but also national lakeshores and seashores, national parkways, and some national scenic riverways; at that time there were 22 such areas, and recreation would be the dominant resource objective, but with multiple intensive uses allowed. But because most units contained a combination of natural, historic, and recreational lands, the General Authorities Act of 1970 made all areas equal within the National Park System; separate policy manuals for each were replaced in 1975 with one that would tailor policies in each park respective to the purpose of zones within.

In 1972 Congress established two NRAs in urban areas as the first urban national parks: Golden Gate NRA in the San Francisco area and Gateway NRA in New York City, both with beaches, historic military sites, and natural conservation areas. Spearheaded by Director George Hartzog, this controversially expanded the Park Service&#x27;s responsibilities into local urban recreation (in addition to the National Capital Parks), and after he left, the NPS opposed the creation of Cuyahoga Valley NRA south of Cleveland and Santa Monica Mountains NRA west of Los Angeles. The former was redesignated a national park in 2000. Chattahoochee River NRA north of Atlanta was created in 1978 and Boston Harbor Islands NRA in 1996. The Santa Monica Mountains and Boston Harbor Islands are partnerships with state parks and local agencies.

Mount Hood is the newest NRA, designated in 2009. The Land and Water Conservation Fund provided funding for the purchase of land at several NRAs.

==Management==
Three federal agencies manage the 40 NRAs. The National Park Service, in the Department of the Interior, manages 18, the U.S. Forest Service, in the Department of Agriculture, manages 22, and the Bureau of Land Management, in the Department of the Interior, manages one. One NRA, Whiskeytown–Shasta–Trinity, comprises three units, two of which are Forest Service and one is National Park Service. The NPS sites are stand-alone units of the National Park System, while the USFS sites are all part of national forests except Land Between the Lakes. Several of the larger USFS NRAs are managed equivalent to a ranger district, but most are designated areas within one. The Green Mountain National Forest is the only one with two NRAs. The Forest Service manages its NRAs as &quot;showcases&quot; of its management standards so that their programs, services, and facilities should be better than and models for its other recreation sites. The USBR operates dams in the West, with eleven NRAs built around them, while the USACE primarily operates dams in the East, with reservoirs or areas near four part of NRAs; three more are based around reservoirs operated by other agencies.

As the primary focus of land management is recreation (rather than conservation), limited land use such as grazing, logging, and mineral leasing is permitted only if it does not interfere with the recreational use of the land. The establishing legislation of each NRA usually specifies multiple purposes of the designation. Hunting is by default banned in areas of the National Park Service unless explicitly permitted by law; 15 of 18 NRAs of the NPS allow hunting – and it is generally permitted in National Forest lands – in accordance with local rules.

== List of national recreation areas ==
The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area and Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area share many features with the NRAs but are classified by the NPS with the national rivers and are not listed here. The USFS has four additional designated &quot;recreation areas&quot; that have similar management practices but are not listed here. The USFS and BLM do not collect visitor data for most sites, marked with an asterisk.

<doc id="1232658" wikidata="Q861258" url="?curid=1232658" title="Shechita">
<text>In Judaism, shechita (anglicized: ; ; ; also transliterated &quot;shehitah, shechitah, shehita&quot;) is ritual slaughtering of certain mammals and birds for food according to &quot;kashrut&quot;. One who practices this, a kosher butcher is called a shochet.

== Biblical sources ==
 states that sheep and cattle should be slaughtered &quot;as I have instructed you&quot;, but nowhere in the Torah are any of the practices of &quot;shechita&quot; described. Instead, they have been handed down in Rabbinic Judaism&#x27;s Oral Torah, and codified in &quot;halakha&quot;.

==Species==

The animal must be of a permitted species. For mammals, this is restricted to ruminants which have split hooves. For birds, although biblically any species of bird not specifically excluded in would be permitted, doubts as to the identity and scope of the species on the biblical list led to
rabbinical law permitting only birds with a tradition of being permissible.

Fish do not require kosher slaughter to be considered kosher, but are subject to other laws found in which determine whether or not they are kosher (having both fins and scales).

== &quot;Shochet&quot; ==

A &quot;shochet&quot; (, &quot;slaughterer&quot;, plural &quot;shochtim&quot;) is a person who performs &quot;shechita&quot;. To become a &quot;shochet&quot;, one must study which slaughtered animals are kosher, what disqualifies them from being kosher, and how to prepare animals according to the laws of &quot;shechita&quot;. Subjects of study include the preparation of slaughtering tools, ways to interpret which foods follow the laws of &quot;shechita&quot;, and types of &quot;terefot&quot; (deformities which make an animal non-kosher).

In the Talmudic era (beginning in 200 CE with the Jerusalem Talmud and 300 CE with the Babylonian Talmud and extending through the Middle Ages), rabbis started to debate and define kosher laws. As the laws increased in number and complexity, following ritual slaughter laws became difficult for Jews who were not trained in those laws. This resulted in the need for a &quot;shochet&quot; (someone who has studied &quot;shechita&quot; extensively) to perform the slaughtering in the communities. &quot;Shochtim&quot; studied under rabbis to learn the laws of &quot;shechita&quot;. Rabbis acted as the academics who, among themselves, debated how to apply laws from the Torah to the preparation of animals. Rabbis also conducted experiments to determine under which &quot;terefot&quot; animals were no longer kosher. &quot;Shochtim&quot; studied under these rabbis, as rabbis were the officials who first interpret, debate, and determine the laws of &quot;shechita&quot;.

&quot;Shochtim&quot; are essential to every Jewish community, so they earn elevated social status. In the Middle Ages, the &quot;shochtim&quot; were treated as second in social status, just underneath rabbis. &quot;Shochtim&quot; were respected for committing their time to studying and for their importance to their communities.

An inspection (Heb. &quot;bedikah&quot;) of the animal is required for it to be declared kosher, and a &quot;shochet&quot; has a double title: &quot;Shochet u&#x27;bodek&quot; (slaughterer and inspector), for which qualification considerable study as well as practical training is required.

==Procedure==

The &quot;shechita&quot; procedure, which must be performed by a &quot;shochet&quot;, is described in the Yoreh De&#x27;ah section of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; only as severing the wind pipe and food pipe (trachea and esophagus). Nothing is mentioned about veins or arteries.

However, in practice, as a very long sharp knife is used, in cattle the soft tissues in the neck are sliced through without the knife touching the spinal cord, in the course of which four major blood vessels, two of which transport oxygenated blood to the brain (the carotid arteries) the other two transporting blood back to the heart (jugular veins) are severed. The vagus nerve is also cut in this operation. With fowl, the same procedure is followed, but a smaller knife is used.

A special knife of considerable length is used; no undue pressure may be applied to the knife, which must be very sharp. The procedure may be performed with the animal either lying on its back (, &quot;shechita munachat&quot;) or standing (, &quot;shechita me&#x27;umedet&quot;).

In the case of fowl (with the exception of large fowl like turkey) the bird is held in the non-dominant hand in such a way that the head is pulled back and the neck exposed, while the cut made with the dominant hand.
The procedure is done with the intention of causing a rapid drop in blood pressure in the brain and loss of consciousness, to render the animal insensitive to pain and to exsanguinate in a prompt and precise action.

It has been suggested that eliminating blood flow through the carotid arteries does not cut blood flow to the brain of a bovine because the brain is also supplied with blood by vertebral arteries, but other authorities note the distinction between severing the carotid versus merely blocking it.

If one did not sever the entirety of both the trachea and esophagus then an animal may still be considered kosher as long as one severed the majority of the trachea and esophagus (windpipe and food pipe) of a mammal, or the majority of either one of these in the case of birds. The cut must be incised with a back-and-forth motion without employing any of the five major prohibited techniques, or various other detailed rules.

===Forbidden techniques===
# &quot;Shehiyah&quot; (; delay or pausing)Pausing during the incision and then starting to cut again makes the animal&#x27;s flesh unkosher. The knife must be moved across the neck in an uninterrupted motion until the trachea and esophagus are sufficiently severed to avoid this. There is some disagreement among legal sources as to the exact length of time needed to constitute &quot;shehiyah&quot;, but today the normative practice is to disqualify a kosher cut as a result of any length of pausing. 
# &quot;Derasah&quot; (; pressing/chopping)The knife must be drawn across the throat by a back and forth movement, not by chopping, hacking, or pressing without moving the knife back and forth. There are those who assert that it is forbidden to have the animal in an upright position during &quot;shechita&quot; due to the prohibition of &quot;derasah&quot;. They maintain that the animal must be on its back or lying on its side, and some also allow for the animal to be suspended upside down. However, the Rambam explicitly permits upright slaughter, and the Orthodox Union as well as all other major kosher certifiers in the United States accept upright slaughter. 
# &quot;Haladah&quot; (; covering, digging, or burying)The knife must be drawn over the throat so that the back of the knife is at all times visible while &quot;shechita&quot; is being performed. It must not be stabbed into the neck or buried by fur, hide, feathers, the wound itself, or a foreign object (such as a scarf) which may cover the knife. 
# &quot;Hagramah&quot; (; cutting in the wrong location)&quot;Hagramah&quot; refers to the location on the neck on which a kosher cut may be performed; cutting outside this location will in most cases disqualify a kosher cut. According to today&#x27;s normative Orthodox practice, any cutting outside this area will in all cases disqualify a kosher cut. The limits within which the knife may be applied are from the large ring in the windpipe to the top of the upper lobe of the lung when it is inflated, and corresponding to the length of the pharynx. Slaughtering above or below these limits renders the meat non-kosher.
# &quot;Iqqur&quot; (; tearing)If either the esophagus or the trachea is torn during the &quot;shechita&quot; incision, the carcass is rendered non-kosher. &quot;Iqqur&quot; can occur if one tears out the esophagus or trachea while handling an animal&#x27;s neck or if the esophagus or trachea is torn by a knife with imperfections on the blade, such as nicks or serration. In order to avoid tearing, the kosher slaughter knife is expertly maintained and regularly checked with the &quot;shochet&#x27;s&quot; fingernail to ensure that no nicks are present.

Breaching any of these five rules renders the animal &quot;nevelah&quot;; the animal is regarded in Jewish law as if it were carrion.

Temple Grandin has observed that &quot;if the rules (of the five forbidden techniques) are disobeyed, the animal will struggle. If these rules are obeyed, the animal has little reaction.&quot;
===The knife===

The knife used for &quot;shechita&quot; is called a &quot;sakin&quot; (), or alternatively a &quot;chalaf&quot; () by Ashkenazi Jews. By biblical law the knife may be made from anything not attached directly or indirectly to the ground and capable of being sharpened and polished to the necessary level of sharpness and smoothness required for &quot;shechita&quot;. The tradition nowadays is to use a very sharp metal knife.

The knife must be at least slightly longer than the neck width but preferably at least twice as long as the animal&#x27;s neck is wide, but not so long that the weight of the knife is deemed excessive. If the knife is too large, it is assumed to cause &quot;derasah&quot;, excessive pressing. Kosher knife makers sell knives of differing sizes depending on the animal. Shorter blades may technically be used depending on the number of strokes employed to slaughter the animal, but the normative practice today is that shorter blades are not used. The knife must not have a point. It is feared a point may slip into the wound during slaughter and cause &quot;haladah&quot;, covering, of the blade. The blade may also not be serrated, as serrations cause &quot;iqqur,&quot; tearing.

The blade cannot have imperfections in it. All blades are assumed by Jewish law to be imperfect, so the knife must be checked before each session. In the past the knife was checked through a variety of means. Today the common practice is for the &quot;shochet&quot; to run their fingernail up and down both sides of the blade and on the cutting edge to determine if they can feel any imperfections. They then use a number of increasingly fine abrasive stones to sharpen and polish the blade until it is perfectly sharp and smooth.

After the slaughter, the &quot;shochet&quot; must check the knife again in the same way to be certain the first inspection was properly done, and to ensure the blade was not damaged during &quot;shechita&quot;. If the blade is found to be damaged, the meat may not be eaten by Jews. If the blade falls or is lost before the second check is done, the first inspection is relied on and the meat is permitted.

In previous centuries, the &quot;chalaf &quot; was made of forged steel, which was not reflective and was difficult to make both smooth and sharp. Shneur Zalman of Liadi, fearing that Sabbateans were scratching the knives in a way not detectable by normal people, introduced the Hasidic &quot;hallaf&quot; (). It differs from the previously used knife design because it is made of molten steel and polished to a mirror gloss in which scratches could be seen as well as felt. The new knife was controversial and one of the reasons for the 1772 excommunication of the Hasidim. As of present time, the &quot;Hassidic hallef&quot; is universally accepted and is the only permitted blade allowed in religious communities.

===Other rules===
The animal may not be stunned prior to the procedure, as is common practice in non-kosher modern animal slaughter since the early 20th century.

It is forbidden to slaughter an animal and its young on the same day. An animal&#x27;s &quot;young&quot; is defined as either its own offspring, or another animal that follows it around.

The animal&#x27;s blood may not be collected in a bowl, a pit, or a body of water, as these resemble ancient forms of idol worship.

If the &quot;shochet&quot; accidentally slaughters with a knife dedicated to idol worship, he must remove an amount of meat equivalent to the value of the knife and destroy it. If he slaughtered with such a knife on purpose, the animal is forbidden as not kosher.

==Post-procedure requirements==

===&quot;Bedikah&quot;===
The carcass must be checked to see if the animal had any of a specific list of internal injuries that would have rendered the animal a &quot;treifah&quot; before the slaughter. These injuries were established by the Talmudic rabbis as being likely to cause the animal to die within 12 months time.

Today all mammals are inspected for lung adhesions ( &quot;examination of the lung&quot;) and other disqualifying signs of the lungs, and most kosher birds will have their intestines inspected for infections.

Further inspection of other parts of the body may be performed depending on the stringency applied and also depending on whether any signs of sickness were detected before slaughter or during the processing of the animal.

====&quot;Glatt&quot;====
&quot;Glatt&quot; () and &quot;halak&quot; () both mean &quot;smooth&quot;. In the context of kosher meat, they refer to the &quot;smoothness&quot; (lack of blemish) in the internal organs of the animal. In the case of an adhesion on cattle&#x27;s lungs specifically, there is debate between Ashkenazic customs and Sephardic customs. While there are certain areas of the lung where an adhesion is allowed, the debate revolves around adhesions which do not occur in these areas.

Ashkenazic Jews rule that if the adhesion can be removed (there are various methods of removing the adhesion, and not all of them are acceptable even according to the Ashkenazic custom) and the lungs are still airtight (a process that is tested by filling the lungs with air and then submerging them in water and looking for escaping air), then the animal is still kosher but not &quot;glatt&quot;.

If, in addition, there were two or fewer adhesions, and they were small and easily removable, then these adhesions are considered a lesser type of adhesion, and the animal is considered &quot;glatt&quot;. Ashkenazi custom permits eating non-&quot;glatt kosher&quot; meat, but it is often considered praiseworthy to only eat &quot;glatt kosher&quot; meat.

Sephardic Jews rule that if there is any sort of adhesion on the forbidden areas of the lungs, then the animal is not kosher. This standard is commonly known as &quot;halak Beit Yosef&quot;. It is the strictest in terms of which adhesions are allowed.

The Rema (an Ashkenazi authority) had an additional stringency, of checking adhesions on additional parts of the lung which Sephardi practice does not require. Some Ashkenazi Jews keep this stringency.

===&quot;Nikkur&quot; ===

&quot;Porging&quot; refers to the &quot;halakhic&quot; requirement to remove the carcass&#x27;s veins, &quot;chelev&quot; (caul fat and suet) and sinews. The Torah prohibits the eating of certain fats, so they must be removed from the animal. These fats are typically known as &quot;chelev&quot;. There is also a biblical prohibition against eating the sciatic nerve (&quot;gid hanasheh&quot;), so that, too, is removed.

The removal of the &quot;chelev&quot; and the &quot;gid hanasheh&quot;, called &quot;nikkur&quot;, is considered complicated and tedious, and hence labor-intensive, and even more specialized training is necessary to perform the act properly.

While the small amounts of &quot;chelev&quot; in the front half of the animal are relatively easy to remove, the back half of the animal is far more complicated, and it is where the sciatic nerve is located.

In countries such as the United States, where there exists a large non-kosher meat market, the hindquarters of the animal (where many of these forbidden meats are located) is often sold to non-Jews, rather than trouble with the process.

This tradition goes back for centuries where local Muslims accept meat slaughtered by Jews as consumable; however, the custom was not universal throughout the Muslim world, and some Muslims (particularly on the Indian subcontinent) did not accept these hindquarters as &quot;halal&quot;. In Israel, on the other hand, specially trained men are hired to prepare the hindquarters for sale as kosher.

===Kashering===
Because of the biblical prohibition of eating blood, all blood must be promptly removed from the carcass.

All large arteries and veins are removed, as well as any bruised meat or coagulated blood. Then the meat is &quot;kashered&quot;, a process of soaking and salting the meat to draw out all the blood. A special large-grained salt, called kosher salt, is used for the kashering process.

If this procedure is not performed promptly, the blood is considered to have &quot;set&quot; in the meat, and the meat is no longer considered kosher except when prepared through broiling with appropriate drainage.

===Giving of the Gifts===

The Torah requires a &quot;shochet&quot; to give the foreleg, cheeks and maw to a &quot;kohen&quot; even though he does not own the meat. Thus, it is desirable that the &quot;shochet&quot; refuse to perform the &quot;shechita&quot; unless the animal&#x27;s owner expresses their agreement to give the gifts. Rabbinical courts have the authority to excommunicate a &quot;shochet&quot; who refuses to perform this commandment.

The &quot;Rishonim&quot; pointed out that the &quot;shochet&quot; cannot claim that, since the animal does not belong to him, he cannot give the gifts without the owner&#x27;s consent. On the contrary, since the average &quot;shochet&quot; is reputed to be well versed and knowledgeable in the laws of &quot;shechitah&quot; (&quot;Dinnei Shechita&quot;), the rabbinical court relies on him to withhold his &quot;shechita&quot; so long as the owner refuses to give the gifts.

==Covering of the blood==
&quot;Full article: Covering of the blood&quot;

It is a positive commandment incumbent upon the &quot;shochet&quot; to cover the blood of &quot;chayot&quot; (non-domesticated animals) and &quot;ufot&quot; (birds) but not &quot;b&#x27;heimot&quot; (domesticated animals).

The &quot;shochet&quot; is required to place dirt on the ground before the slaughter, and then to perform the cut over that dirt, in order to drop some of the blood on to the prepared dirt. When the &quot;shechita&quot; is complete, the &quot;shochet&quot; grabs a handful of dirt, says a blessing and then covers the blood.

The meat is still kosher if the blood does not get covered; covering the blood is a separate mitzvah which does not affect the kosher status of the meat.

==Animal welfare controversies==

&quot;Opposition to the Jewish methods of slaughter has a long history, starting at least as far back as the mid-Victorian era.&quot;

===The Gutachten (expert reports)===
When &quot;shechita&quot; came under attack in the 19th century, Jewish communities resorted to expert scientific opinions which were published in pamphlets called &quot; Gutachten&quot;. Among these authorities was Joseph Lister, who introduced the concept of sterility in surgery.

===General description of controversy===
The practices of handling, restraining, and unstunned slaughter have been criticized by, among others, animal welfare organizations such as Compassion in World Farming. The UK Farm Animal Welfare Council said that the method by which kosher and &quot;halal&quot; meat is produced causes &quot;significant pain and distress&quot; to animals and should be banned.

According to FAWC it can take up to two minutes after the incision for cattle to become insensible. Compassion in World Farming also supported the recommendation saying &quot;We believe that the law must be changed to require all animals to be stunned before slaughter.&quot;

Mr Bradshaw said the Government had maintained its position in not accepting FAWC&#x27;s recommendation that slaughter without prior stunning should be banned, as they respected the rights of communities in Britain to slaughter animals in accordance with the requirements of their religion.

The Federation of Veterinarians of Europe has issued a position paper on slaughter without prior stunning, calling it &quot;unacceptable.&quot;

The American Veterinary Medical Association has no such qualms, as leading US meat scientists support &quot;shechita&quot; as a humane slaughtering method as defined by the Humane Slaughter Act.

A 1978 study at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover indicates that &quot;shechita&quot; gave results which proved &quot;pain and suffering to the extent as has since long been generally associated in public with this kind of slaughter cannot be registered&quot; and that &quot;[a complete loss of consciousness] occurred generally within considerably less time than during the slaughter method after captive bolt stunning.&quot; However, the lead of the study William Schulze warned in his report that the results may have been due to the captive bolt device they used being defective.

Nick Cohen, writing for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, discusses research papers collected by Compassion in World Farming which indicate that the animal suffers pain during the process. In 2009, Craig Johnson and colleagues showed that calves that have not been stunned feel pain from the cut in their necks, and they may take at least 10–30 seconds to lose consciousness.

Temple Grandin says that the experiment needs to be repeated using a qualified &quot;shochet&quot; and knives of the correct size sharpened in the proper way.

Jewish and Muslim commentators cite studies that show &quot;shechita&quot; is humane and that criticism is at least partially motivated by antisemitism. A Knesset committee announced (January, 2012) that it would call on European parliaments and the European Union to put a stop to attempts to outlaw kosher slaughter.
&quot;The pretext [for this legislation] is preventing cruelty to animals or animal rights—but there is sometimes an element of anti-Semitism and there is a hidden message that Jews are cruel to animals,&quot; said Committee Chair MK Danny Danon (Likud).

Studies done in 1994 by Temple Grandin, and another in 1992 by Flemming Bager, showed that when the animals were slaughtered in a comfortable position they appeared to give no resistance and none of the animals attempted to pull away their head. The studies concluded that a shechita cut &quot;probably results in minimal discomfort&quot; because the cattle stand still and do not resist a comfortable head restraint device.

Temple Grandin gives various times for loss of consciousness via kosher ritual slaughter, ranging from 15 to 90 seconds depending on measurement type and individual kosher slaughterhouse. She elaborates on what parts of the process she finds may or may not be cause for concern. In 2018, Grandin stated that kosher slaughter, no matter how well it is done, is not instantaneous, whereas stunning properly with a captive bolt is instantaneous.

===Efforts to improve conditions in &quot;shechita&quot; slaughterhouses===
Temple Grandin is opposed to shackling and hoisting as a method of handling animals and wrote, on visiting a &quot;shechita&quot; slaughterhouse,
Efforts are made to improve the techniques used in slaughterhouses. Temple Grandin has worked closely with Jewish slaughterers to design handling systems for cattle, and has said: &quot;When the cut is done correctly, the animal appears not to feel it. From an animal-welfare standpoint, the major concern during ritual slaughter are the stressful and cruel methods of restraint (holding) that are used in some plants.&quot;

When shackling and hoisting is used, it is recommended that cattle not be hoisted clear of the floor until they have had time to bleed out.

===Agriprocessors controversy===
The prohibition of stunning and the treatment of the slaughtered animal expressed in &quot;shechita&quot; law limit the extent to which Jewish slaughterhouses can industrialize their procedures.

The most industrialized attempt at a kosher slaughterhouse, Agriprocessors of Postville, Iowa, became the center of controversy in 2004, after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released a gruesome undercover video of cattle struggling to their feet with their tracheas and esophagi ripped out after &quot;shechita&quot;. Some of the cattle actually got up and stood for a minute or so after being dumped from the rotating pen.

The OU&#x27;s condonation of Agriprocessors as a possibly inhumane, yet appropriately &quot;glatt&quot; kosher company has led to discussion as to whether or not industrialized agriculture has undermined the place of &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) in &quot;shechita&quot; as well as whether or not &quot;halakha&quot; has any place at all in Jewish ritual slaughter.

Jonathan Safran Foer, a Jewish vegetarian, narrated the short documentary film &quot;If This Is Kosher...&quot;, which records what he considers abuses within the kosher meat industry.

Forums surrounding the ethical treatment of workers and animals in kosher slaughterhouses have inspired a revival of the small-scale, kosher-certified farms and slaughterhouses, which are gradually appearing throughout the United States.

<doc id="1232660" wikidata="Q4115175" url="?curid=1232660" title="Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas">
<text>Syed Muhammad al Naquib bin Ali al-Attas ( &quot;&quot;; born 5 September 1931) is a Malaysian Muslim philosopher. He is one of the few contemporary scholars who is thoroughly rooted in the traditional Islamic sciences and studied theology, philosophy, metaphysics, history, and literature. He pioneered the concept of Islamisation of knowledge. Al-Attas&#x27; philosophy and methodology of education have one goal: Islamisation of the mind, body and soul and its effects on the personal and collective life of Muslims as well as others, including the spiritual and physical non-human environment. He is the second Malaysian to be awarded the title of Royal Professor (&quot;Profesor Diraja&quot;) after the late Ungku Abdul Aziz.

He is the author of 27 works on various aspects of Islamic thought and civilisation, particularly on Sufism, cosmology, metaphysics, philosophy and Malay language and literature.

==Early life and education==
Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas was born in Bogor, Java, Dutch East Indies into a family with a history of illustrious ancestors and saints. Some sources state his genealogical tree can be traced over a thousand years through the Ba&#x27; Alawi sayyids of Hadramaut. He was the second of three sons; his older brother, Syed Hussein Alatas later became an academician and politician. He is the cousin of the academic Ungku Abdul Aziz.

After World War II, in 1946 he returned to Johor to complete his secondary education. He was exposed to Malay literature, history, religion, and Western classics in English.

After al-Attas finished secondary school in 1951, he entered the Malay Regiment as a cadet officer. There he was selected to study at Eaton Hall, Chester, England and later at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, UK (1952–1955). During this time he became interested in the metaphysics of the Sufis, especially the works of Jami. He travelled to Spain and North Africa where the Islamic heritage had a profound influence on him. Al-Attas felt the need to study and voluntarily resigned from the King&#x27;s Commission to serve in the Royal Malay Regiment, to pursue studies at the University of Malaya in Singapore (1957–1959).

While an undergraduate at the University of Malaya, he wrote &quot;Rangkaian Ruba&#x27;iyat&quot;, a literary work, and &quot;Some Aspects of Sufism as Understood and Practised among the Malays&quot;. He was awarded the Canada Council Fellowship for three years of study at the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill University in Montreal. He received the M.A. degree with distinction in Islamic philosophy in 1962, with his thesis &quot;Raniri and the Wujudiyyah of 17th Century Acheh&quot;. Al-Attas went on to the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London where he worked with Professor A.J. Arberry of Cambridge and Martin Lings. His doctoral thesis (1962) was a two-volume work on the mysticism of Hamzah Fansuri.

In 1965, al-Attas returned to Malaysia and became Head of the Division of Literature in the Department of Malay Studies at the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur. He was Dean of the Faculty of Arts from 1968 until 1970, where he instituted more consultative reforms. Thereafter he moved to the new National University of Malaysia, as Head of the Department of Malay Language and Literature and then Dean of the Faculty of Arts. He advocated the use of Malay as the language of instruction in the university. He founded and directed the Institute of Malay Language, Literature, and Culture (IBKKM) at the National University of Malaysia in 1973.

In 1987, with al-Attas as founder and director, the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilisation (ISTAC) was established in Kuala Lumpur. The institution was made to increase the consciousness of Islam to its students and faculty. Al-Attas incorporated Islamic artistic and architectural principles throughout the campus and grounds.

==Malay literature and Sufism==
He authored &quot;Rangkaian Ruba&#x27;iyyat&quot; a literary work that was among the first ever published in 1959 and the classic work, &quot;Some Aspects of Sufism as Understood and Practised Among the Malays&quot;, in 1963. His two-volume doctoral thesis on &quot;The Mysticism of Hamzah Fansuri&quot;, which is the most important and comprehensive work to date on one of the greatest and perhaps the most controversial Sufi scholars in the Malay world earned him the PhD in the UK in 1965.

Al-Attas engaged in polemics on the subjects of Islamic history, philology, Malay literary history and Sha&#x27;ir. He established that Hamzah Fansuri was the originator of the Malay Sha&#x27;ir. He has also set forth his ideas on the categorisation of Malay literature and the periodisation of its literary history. He contributed to the history and origin of the modern Malay language.

His commentaries on the ideas of Fansuri and al-Raniri are the first definitive ones on early Malay Sufis based on 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts. He discovered and published his meticulous research on the oldest extant Malay manuscript, wherein among other important matters, he also solved the issue of arrangements of the Malay-Islamic cyclical calendar. He was also responsible for the formulation and conceptualisation of the role of the Malay language in nation-building during debates with political leaders in 1968. This formulation and conceptualisation was one of the important factors that led to the consolidation of Malay as the national language of Malaysia. As the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, at the University of Malaya, he implemented a more systematic implementation of Malay as an intellectual and academic language in the university. 

==Islam and metaphysics==
Al-Attas maintains that modern science sees things as mere things and that it has reduced the study of the phenomenal world to an end in itself. Certainly, this has brought material benefits, however, it is accompanied by an uncontrollable and insatiable propensity to destroy nature itself. Al-Attas maintains a firm critique that studying and using nature without a higher spiritual end has brought mankind to the state of thinking that men are gods or co-partners. &quot;Devoid of real purpose, the pursuit of knowledge becomes a deviation from the truth, which necessarily puts into question the validity of such knowledge.&quot; [Islam and Secularism, p. 36]

Al-Attas views Western civilisation as constantly changing and &#x27;becoming&#x27; without ever achieving &#x27;being&#x27;. He analyses that many institutions and nations are influenced by this spirit of the West and they continually revise and change their basic developmental goals and educational objectives to follow the trends from the West. He points to Islamic metaphysics which shows that Reality is composed of both permanence and change; the underlying permanent aspects of the external world are perpetually changing [Islam and Secularism, p. 82]

For al-Attas, Islamic metaphysics is a unified system that discloses the ultimate nature of Reality in positive terms, integrating reason and experience with other higher orders in the suprarational and trans-empirical levels of human consciousness. He sees this from the perspective of philosophical Sufism. Al-Attas also says that the Essentialist and the Existentialist schools of the Islamic tradition address the nature of reality. The first is represented by philosophers and theologians, and the latter by Sufis. The Essentialists cling to the principle of &quot;mahiyyah&quot; (quiddity), whereas the Existentialists are rooted in &quot;wujud&quot; (the fundamental reality of existence) which is direct intuitive experience, not merely based on rational analysis or discursive reasoning. This has undoubtedly led philosophical and scientific speculations to be preoccupied with things and their essences at the expense of existence itself, thereby making the study of nature an end in itself. Al-Attas maintains that in the extra-mental reality, it is &quot;wujud&quot; (Existence) that is the real &quot;essences&quot; of things and that what is conceptually posited as mahiyyah (&quot;essences&quot; or &quot;quiddities&quot;) are in reality accidents of existence.

The process of creation or bringing into existence and annihilation or returning to non-existence, and recreation of similars is a dynamic existential movement. There is a principle of unity and a principle of diversity in creation. &quot;The multiplicity of existents that results is not in the one reality of existence, but in the manifold aspects of the recipients of existence in the various degrees, each according to its strength or weakness, perfection or imperfection, and priority or posteriority. Thus the multiplicity of existents does not impair the unity of existence, for each existent is a mode of existence and does not have a separate ontological status&quot;. He clarifies that the Essence of God is transcendent and is unknown and unknowable, except to Himself, whereas the essence or reality of a thing consists of a mode of existence providing the permanent aspect of the thing, and its quiddity, endowing it with its changing qualities.

==Awards and achievements==
Al-Attas developed a style and precise vocabulary that uniquely characterised his Malay writings and language. He has also studied Islamic and Malay civilisations. In 1975, he was conferred Fellow of the Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy for his contribution in the field of comparative philosophy. He was also a speaker and an active participant at the First World Conference on Islamic Education held at Mecca in 1977, where he chaired the Committee on Aims and Definitions of Islamic Education. From 1976 to 1977, he was a visiting professor of Islam at Temple University, Philadelphia, United States. In 1978. He chaired the UNESCO meeting of experts on Islamic history held at Aleppo, Syria.

He is the first holder of the Chair of Malay Language and Literature at the National University of Malaysia (1970–84), and the first holder of the Tun Abdul Razak Chair of Southeast Asian Studies at Ohio University (1980–82) and as the Founder-Director of the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilisation (ISTAC) at the International Islamic University Malaysia (since 1987). He has delivered more than 400 lectures throughout Europe, the United States, Japan, the Far East and the Muslim world. Anwar Ibrahim in 1993, appointed him as the first holder of the Abu Hamid al-Ghazali Chair of Islamic Thought at ISTAC. King Hussein of Jordan made him a Member of the Royal Academy of Jordan in 1994, and in June 1995 the University of Khartoum conferred upon him the Degree of Honorary Doctorate of Arts (D.Litt.).

He was also a calligrapher, his work was exhibited at the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam in 1954. He planned and designed the: ISTAC building; the unique scroll of the al-Ghazali Chair (1993); the auditorium and mosque of ISTAC (1994); as well as their landscaping and interior decor.

<text>The Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan (formerly the Saskatchewan Archives Board) is an arms-length government agency with offices in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. The archives holds public and private records which include audio tapes, video, photographs, maps, publications and other material.

==History==
A.S. Morton, a history professor at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon was a leading figure in heritage preservation in Saskatchewan. He became head of the department of history at the university as well as university librarian in 1914, just prior to the outbreak of World War I. During the war, he travelled throughout Saskatchewan, teaching university extension classes to rural communities. It was during these travels that he became aware of the urgent need to acquire and preserve Saskatchewan&#x27;s documentary heritage.

Efforts were made by a number of professors at the University of Saskatchewan to develop an archival program. Government inaction and limited support stymied most of the efforts. During World War I, a provision was made for an archives branch of the Legislative Library, but the position of archivist was allowed to lapse after the death of Assistant Librarian and archivist William Trant in 1924. Meanwhile, the Legislature was overflowing with inactive government records. The solution to the overflow was to feed the records to the fires of the powerhouse nearby. The first statute to deal with the retention or disposal of archival records, the &quot;Preservation of Public Documents Act&quot; of 1920, did little to transfer documents of historic significance to the archives.

The Historical Public Records Office (HPRO) set up at the University of Saskatchewan in 1937 was the precursor to the present day Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan. Morton modelled the HPRO on the English Public Record Office. He felt it was important to make a distinction between government archives and archives containing general historic material. He was solely concerned with the preservation of government records in the early years. He spent the next seven years pursuing inactive federal government records and records of farm organizations with the aim of developing a leading research facility for prairie history. He pushed for an archives Act to create a public records policy for the province.

In March 1945, the &quot;Archives Act&quot; was passed and the Saskatchewan Archives Board was formed. Morton was not alive to see the passing of the act – he had died in January 1945. The &quot;Archives Act&quot; formalized the relationship between the University of Saskatchewan and the provincial government. A board of five was created, two members appointed by the Lieutenant Governor, two by the Board of Governors of the university. The fifth member was to be the Legislative librarian, while the Provincial Archivist sat as Secretary of the Board.

In 2004, a revised Archives Act was passed, updating the legislative framework and ensuring Saskatchewan&#x27;s legislation is in line with that of other Canadian provinces.

On 24 August 2015, &quot;The Archives and Public Records Management Act&quot; was passed. As part of this act, the name of the institution was changed to the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan .

==About the Archives==
The Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan holds government records, private records, business records, maps, audio tapes, photographs, moving images, architectural drawings, newspapers, and microfilm. Some archival records date back to the mid 19th century. The archival holdings document the lives of all residents of Saskatchewan – from the political, social and economic elite to the ordinary citizen.

The archives offers reference services to individuals wishing to use the archives in person or from a distance. While genealogists comprise nearly half of the users of the archives, students, professors, historians, lawyers, journalists, artists and government organizations also utilize the facilities.

<doc id="1232665" wikidata="Q1396187" url="?curid=1232665" title="Farallon Islands">
<text>The Farallon Islands ( ), or Farallones (), are a group of islands and sea stacks in the Gulf of the Farallones, off the coast of San Francisco, California, United States. The islands are also sometimes referred to by mariners as the Devil&#x27;s Teeth Islands, in reference to the many treacherous underwater shoals in their vicinity. The islands lie outside the Golden Gate and south of Point Reyes, and are visible from the mainland on clear days. The islands are part of the City and County of San Francisco. The only inhabited portion of the islands is on Southeast Farallon Island (SEFI), where researchers from Point Blue Conservation Science and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stay. The islands are closed to the public.

The Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge is one of 63 national wildlife refuges that have congressionally designated wilderness status. In 1974, the Farallon Wilderness was established (Public Law 93-550) and includes all islands except the Southeast Island for a total of . Additionally, waters surrounding the islands are protected as part of the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary.

==History==

The peaks of the Farallon Islands are visible from coastal areas of San Francisco and Marin County, so the Native Americans who lived in the San Francisco area were aware of them, and believed them to be an abode of the spirits of the dead. They are not believed to have traveled to the islands.

The first Europeans to see these islands were most probably the members of the Juan Cabrillo expedition of 1542, which sailed as far north as Point Reyes, but no source record of the Cabrillo expedition&#x27;s actual sighting of these islands has survived. The first European to create a record of the islands that has survived was the English privateer and explorer Sir Francis Drake, on July 24, 1579. On that day, Drake landed on the islands to collect seal meat and bird eggs for his ship. He named them the Islands of Saint James because the day after his arrival was the feast day of St James the Great. The name of St James is now applied to only one of the rocky islets of the North Farallons.

The islands were apparently first given their names &quot;Farallones&quot; (literally, &quot;cliffs&quot;) by Friar Antonio de la Ascencion, aboard the Spanish explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno&#x27;s 1603 expedition. De la Ascension wrote in his diary, &quot;Six leagues before reaching Punta de los Reyes (Point Reyes) is a large island, two leagues from land and three leagues northwest of this are . . . seven farallones close together.&quot; It is believed that probably for the next two centuries after Drake first recorded their existence, their rather ominous appearance, lying just off the entrance to San Francisco Bay, most likely caused the earlier mariners to prefer to skirt far to the west and offshore from the entrance to the bay, thus leading to the much later discovery of the San Francisco Bay by land over two centuries after the 1542 discovery of the islands. In 1769, the bay inlet was finally discovered soon after an overland sighting of the bay was made from what is now the Pacifica area.

In the years following the discovery of the islands, during the maritime fur trade era, the islands were exploited by seal hunters, first from New England and later from Russia. The Russians maintained a sealing station in the Farallones from 1812 to 1840, taking 1,200 to 1,500 fur seals annually, though American ships had already exploited the islands. The &quot;Albatross&quot;, captained by Nathan Winship, and the &quot;O&#x27;Cain&quot;, captained by his brother Jonathan Winship, were the first American ships sent from Boston in 1809 to establish a settlement on the Columbia River. In 1810, they met with two other American ships at the Farallon Islands, the &quot;Mercury&quot; and the &quot;Isabella&quot;, and at least 30,000 seal skins were taken. By 1818, the seals diminished rapidly until only about 500 could be taken annually and within the next few years, the fur seal was extirpated from the islands. Whether the northern fur seal or the Guadalupe fur seal were the islands&#x27; native fur seal is unknown, although the northern fur seal is the species that began to recolonize the islands in 1996.

On July 17, 1827, French sea captain Auguste Duhaut-Cilly sailed by the southernmost Farallon Island and counted the &quot;crude dwellings of about a hundred Kodiaks stationed there by the Russians of Bodega...the Kodiaks, in their light boats, slip into San Francisco Bay by night, moving along the coast opposite the fort, and once inside this great basin, they station themselves temporarily on some of the inner islands, from where they catch the sea otter without hindrance.&quot;

After Alta California was ceded by Mexico to the United States in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the islands&#x27; environment became linked to the growth of the city of San Francisco. Beginning in 1853, a lighthouse was constructed on SEFI. As the city grew, the seabird colonies came under severe threat as eggs were collected in the millions for San Francisco markets. The trade, which in its heyday could yield 500,000 eggs a month, was the source of conflict between the egg-collecting companies and the lighthouse keepers. This conflict turned violent in a confrontation between rival companies in 1863. The clash between two rival companies, known as the Egg War, left two men dead and marked the end of private companies on the islands, although the lighthouse keepers continued egging.

From 1902 to 1913, the former U.S. Weather Bureau maintained a weather station on the southeast island, which was connected with the mainland by cable. The results of the meteorological study were later published in a book on California&#x27;s climate. Temperatures during those years never exceeded or dropped to . Years later, the National Weather Service provided some weather observations from the lighthouse on its local radio station.

The islands have also been mentioned in connection with the schooner &quot;Malahat&quot; as one possible site for Rum Row during Prohibition.

A high-frequency direction finding (HFDF) station was established here by the Navy during World War II. These radio intercept sites along the coast could track Japanese warships and merchant marine vessels as far away as the Western Pacific. The other stations in California were at Point Arguello, Point Saint George, and San Diego. Bainbridge Island, Washington also hosted a station. The United States Coast Guard maintained a staffed lighthouse until 1972, when it was automated.

===Nuclear waste dump===

From 1946 to 1970, the sea around the Farallones was used as a dump site for radioactive waste under the authority of the Atomic Energy Commission at a site known as the Farallon Island Nuclear Waste Dump. Most of the dumping took place before 1960, and all dumping of radioactive wastes by the United States was terminated in 1970. By then, 47,500 containers (55-gallon steel drums) had been dumped in the vicinity, with a total estimated radioactive activity of 14,500 Ci (540 TBq). The materials dumped were mostly laboratory materials containing traces of contamination. By 1980, most of the radiation had decayed.

Waste containers were shipped to Hunters Point Shipyard, then loaded onto barges for transportation to the Farallones. Containers were weighted with concrete. Those that floated were sometimes shot with rifles to sink them. Forty-four thousand containers were dumped at , and another 3,500 at .

In January 1951, the highly radioactive hull of USS &quot;Independence&quot;, which was used in Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons testing and then loaded with barrels of radioactive waste, was scuttled in the area. Its wreck was rediscovered in 2015.

The exact current location of the containers and the potential hazard the containers pose to the environment are unknown. According to the EPA, attempts to remove the barrels would likely produce greater risk than leaving them undisturbed.

===Shipwrecks===
The islands are the site of many shipwrecks. The liberty ship SS &quot;Henry Bergh&quot;, a converted troop carrier, hit West End in 1944 (all hands were saved). The USS &quot;Conestoga&quot;, a US Navy tugboat that disappeared with its 56 crew members in 1921, was found in 2009 and positively identified in 2016. (The &quot;Conestoga&quot; had sailed from nearby San Francisco, but the waters of the Farallones were never searched because the vessel was assumed to have traveled far out into the Pacific.)

On the morning of August 5, 1941, a United States Coast Guard Douglas Dolphin, V-126, likely struck a rock pinnacle on the southeast Farallon island, causing the aircraft to burst into flames. All 3 crewmen aboard were killed.

Computer scientist Jim Gray was lost at sea after setting out on a solo sailing trip from San Francisco to the Farallones on January 28, 2007. Despite an unusually thorough search, neither his body nor his boat was ever found. On April 14, 2012, the sailing yacht &quot;Low Speed Chase&quot; capsized during a race at Maintop Island, killing 5 of the 8 crew aboard.

===Swimming records===
Three people have successfully swum from the Farallones to the Golden Gate, with two more swimming to points north of the gate. The first, Ted Erikson, made the swim in September 1967, with the second, Joseph Locke, swimming to the Golden Gate on July 12, 2014, in 14 hours. The third person, and the first woman to complete the distance, Kimberley Chambers, made it in just over 17 hours on August 7, 2015.

On May 11, 2024, Amy Appelhans Gubser became the first and only person to have swum in the outbound direction, from the Golden Gate to SE Farralone, in just over 17 hours.

==Protected area==
The collecting of eggs, along with the threat of oil spills from San Francisco&#x27;s shipping lanes, prompted President Theodore Roosevelt to sign in 1909, creating the Farallon Reservation to protect the chain&#x27;s northern islands. This was expanded to the other islands in 1969 when it became a national wildlife refuge. In 1981, Congress designated the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, which spanned 1,279 square miles (3,313 square kilometers; 966 square nautical miles) of water surrounding the islands. This sanctuary protected open ocean, nearshore tidal flats, rocky intertidal areas, estuarine wetlands, subtidal reefs, and coastal beaches within its boundaries. In 2015, the sanctuary was enlarged north and west of the original boundary, partially surrounding Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, to encompass 3,295 square miles (8,534 square kilometers; 2,488 square nautical miles), and the name was changed to Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. The sanctuary is contiguous with both the Cordell Bank sanctuary and another sanctuary to the south, Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The islands are managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the Marin-based Point Blue Conservation Science (formerly Point Reyes Bird Observatory). The islands are currently the subject of long term ecological research. The Farallones are closed to the public, although birders and wildlife enthusiasts can approach them on whale watching boats, shark and marine policy education with the non profit Shark Stewards and the sail-training vessel &quot;Seaward&quot; out of Sausalito.

==Geology==
The Farallon Islands are outcroppings of the Salinian Block, a vast geologic province of granitic continental crust sharing its origins with the core of the Sierra Nevada. The block was rifted off far to the south of its present position and moved north with the Pacific Plate on which the islands rest. Other nearby examples of the Salinian Block include the Point Reyes Peninsula and Bodega Head. The San Andreas Fault, marking a boundary zone between the Pacific and North American Plates, passes a few miles east of the islands.

The ancient Farallon Plate is named after the islands.

==Geography==
===Overview===
The islands string northwestward from Southeast Farallon Island for . Their total land area is . The islands were initially exploited for bird eggs and fur seal skins, then used as a lighthouse station and a radio station. They have been protected in the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge, first established in 1909 with the Southeast Farallons added in 1969, and contain the largest seabird colony in the U.S. outside of Alaska and Hawaii. The islands are part of the City and County of San Francisco, in Supervisorial District 4, mainly covering the Sunset District. They were formerly part of District 1 (The Richmond District).


===South Farallon Islands===

* Southeast Farallon Island (SEFI) is the largest island, with an area of 95.79 acres or , and is the only inhabited one. The island is pyramidal in shape and high. The peak, Tower Hill (actually a double peak consisting of Lighthouse Hill and Little Lighthouse Hill), is the location of a lighthouse, the Farallon Island Light. The large flat area in the southeast of the island is called Marine Terrace. Immediately south of it is Mussel Flat, about by , which is cut off from the main island only during high tide.
* Seal Rock (Saddle Rock), about south of SEFI, is about by in size and high.
* Maintop Island (West End) is immediately to the west of SEFI, separated by a narrow impassable gorge, The Jordan (Jordan Channel), which connects Mirounga Bay in the south to Maintop Bay in the north. It is the second largest island, and high at Main Top hill in its eastern part. The Great West Arch, or Aulon Arch, is a rock formation in the west of the island, and Indian Head is in the south.
* The Drunk Uncle Islets are a group of small rocks just northwest of Maintop Island.
* Aulon Island and smaller Great Arch Rock (Arch Rock) are immediately north of the northern tip of SEFI, and together about by in size. They are barely separated by a narrow gorge. Great Arch Rock is not to be confused with Great West Arch, a rock formation in the west of Maintop Island.
* Sugarloaf Island (usually just referred to as Sugarloaf) is northeast of Great Arch Rock, and just slightly larger in size, with a height of . Southwest of Aulon Island, Great Arch Rock and Sugarloaf Island, and in the northeast of SEFI, is protected Fisherman Bay.
* Sea Lion Rock is just northwest of Aulon Island, diameter approximately .
* Hurst Shoal is located about 1000 yards (one kilometer) southeast of the southeastern corner of SEFI. It has a least depth of .

===Middle Farallon Island===
Middle Farallon Island, northwest of SEFI, is a high guano-covered black rock about 210&#x27; (65 meters) in diameter, with an area of ¾ acre (3,362 m2). This island is informally known as &quot;the pimple.&quot;

===North Farallon Islands===

North Farallon Islands, about 5 miles (7 km) further northwest, consist of two clusters of bare precipitous islets and rocks 100&#x27; to 280&#x27; (31 to 85 meters) high, with an aggregate area of 7 acres (28,270 m2)
* North Farallon Island, 102&#x27; (31 meters) high, about 500&#x27; (150 meters) long north–south, 2¼ acres (9,260 m2)
* Island of St. James, 150&#x27; (47 meters) high, about 410&#x27; (125 meters) in diameter, 3 acres (12,380 m2)
* unnamed rock, about 280&#x27; (85 meters) in diameter, and 1½ acres (5,640 m2) in area
* four smaller unnamed rocks, diameter 70&#x27; (20 meters) and less
Some of those unnamed rocks, however, have Spanish names, such as &quot;Piedra Guadalupe&quot;, &quot;Peñasco Quebrado&quot; and &quot;Farallón Vizcaíno&quot;.

===Fanny Shoal===
3 miles (5 km) WNW of the North Farallones is Fanny Shoal, a bank 2 miles (3 km) in extent, with depth less than 180&#x27; (55 meters), marking the northernmost and westernmost feature of the group, albeit entirely submerged.
&quot;Noonday Rock&quot;, which rises abruptly from a depth of 120&#x27; (37 meters), with a least depth of over it at low tide, is the shallowest point of Fanny Shoal. There is a lighted bell buoy about 1000 yards (1 km) west of Noonday Rock. Noonday Rock, formerly known as &quot;Fanny Rock&quot;, derives its name from that of the clipper ship that struck it on January 1, 1863, and sank within one hour.

===Banks northwest of Fanny Shoal===
The banks northwest of Fanny Shoal are not considered part of the Farallon Islands anymore, and they are outside of U.S. territorial waters. About 15 miles (25 km) northwest of Fanny Shoal is Cordell Bank, a significant marine habitat (). About halfway between Fanny Shoal and Cordell Bank is Rittenburg Bank, with depths of less than 260&#x27; (80 meters) ().

===Climate===
Although the Farallon Islands do not have an official weather station, satellite measurements indicate a very mild mediterranean climate due to its offshore position in the midst of the very cold California Current. The cold waters also make it rather chilly during most of the year for a piece of land on the 37°N latitude. During San Francisco&#x27;s and Oakland&#x27;s above record heat wave of 1 September 2017, the aggregate weather around the Farallon Islands remained below . The islands are also subject to occasional, heavy, offshore winds in winter. Due to the absence of a warming nearby landmass and the cold water, winters remain mild but often cooler than San Francisco also during that time of year. Winter lows below are very rare in the area. Summer highs seldom rise far above .

==Flora and fauna==
===Seabirds===
The Farallon Islands are an important reserve protecting a huge seabird colony. The islands&#x27; position in the highly productive California Current and eastern Pacific upwelling region, as well as the absence of other large islands that would provide suitable nesting grounds, result in a seabird population of over 250,000. Twelve species of seabird and shorebird nest on the islands; western gull, Brandt&#x27;s cormorant, pelagic cormorant, double-crested cormorant, pigeon guillemot, common murre, Cassin&#x27;s auklet, tufted puffin, black oystercatcher, rhinoceros auklet, ashy storm-petrel, and Leach&#x27;s storm-petrel. Since the islands were protected, common murres, which once numbered nearly 500,000 pairs but suffered from the egg collecting, oil spills and other disturbances that had greatly reduced their numbers, recovered and climbed from 6,000 birds to 160,000. Additionally, since protection, the locally extinct rhinoceros auklet has begun to breed on the islands again. The island has the world&#x27;s largest colonies of western gulls and ashy storm petrels, the latter species being considered endangered and a conservation priority. The island also is the wintering ground of several species of migrants, and regularly attracts vagrant birds (about 430 species of bird have been recorded on or around the island).

===Seals===
Five species of pinniped come to shore on the islands, and in some cases breed. These are the northern elephant seal, harbor seal, Steller&#x27;s sea lion, California sea lion, and the northern fur seal (the last of which, like the rhinoceros auklet, began to return to the island again after protection).

Sealers took 150,000 northern fur seals (&quot;Callorhinus ursinus&quot;) from the Farallons between 1810 and 1813, followed by Russian fur hunters who lived on the Farallons and extirpated the pinnipeds from the islands. In 1996 West End Island became the fourth American northern fur seal rookery when a pup was born. The recolonizers bore tags from San Miguel Island in the Channel Islands, which had been itself recolonized in 1968. By 2006, nearly 100 pups were born. The fur seals are aggressive and have displaced larger sea lions from their territory. The high count for 2011 was 476 individuals, a 69 percent increase from the year before. By 2016, the pup count alone was 1,126, reflecting a 21% average (but highly variable) annual increase in new pups over the 21 years since recolonization. If the South Farallon Islands population reaches its estimated historical size of 100,000 individuals, it could account for approximately one-fifth of the world&#x27;s northern fur seal population.

Northern elephant seals (&quot;Mirounga angustirostris&quot;) recolonized the refuge in 1959 with a confirmed pup in 1972. The elephant seal rookery on Southeast Farallon has probably reached carrying capacity.

===Whales===
Several species of cetaceans are found near the Farallon Islands, most frequently gray whales, blue whales, and humpback whales. Blue whales and humpback whales are most frequently found near the islands in the summer and fall, when strong upwelling may support a rich pelagic food web. Orca whales are also found around the islands. Gray whales are reliably found near the Farallones during their spring migration north and the fall and winter migration south. Some gray whales may also be found during the summer, when a few whales skip the trip north to Alaska and spend the summer months off the coast of Canada and the continental United States.

In December 2005, one humpback was rescued from netting entanglement east of the Farallones by staff of The Marine Mammal Center. The last sighting of another humpback, Humphrey, was near the Farallones in 1991. The islands are in the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, which protects the feeding grounds of the wildlife of the refuge.

===Sharks===
The elephant seal population attracts a population of great white sharks to the islands. In 1970, Farallon biologists witnessed their first shark attack, on a Steller&#x27;s sea lion. During the next fifteen years, more than one hundred attacks on seals and sea lions were observed at close range. By the year 2000, biologists were logging almost eighty attacks in a single season.

While the males return annually, the females return only every other year, often with fresh, deep bites around their heads. The seasonal shark population at the Farallones is unclear, with estimates from thirty to one hundred. The Farallones are unique in the size of the great whites that are attracted. The average length of a full-grown great white shark is , with a weight of , females generally being larger than males. Farallon great whites range between the &quot;smaller&quot; males at to the females, which generally range between . (For comparison, the largest accurately measured great white shark was a female caught in August 1988 at Prince Edward Island off the North Atlantic coast and measured .) A killer whale was recorded killing a great white near the Farallones in 1997. Over the decades of study, many of the individual white sharks visiting the Farallones have been nicknamed, often based on their scars and appearances, such as Gouge, The Hunchback, The Jester, and Stumpy. Stumpy, an 18-foot female great white, in particular was well known for her appearance in the BBC documentary &quot;Great White Shark&quot; narrated by David Attenborough and stock footage of her attacks on decoys is often utilized in more recent documentaries, and another example, Tom Johnson, a 16-foot male white shark that was featured in an episode of the 2012 season of Shark Week called &quot;Great White Highway,&quot; is believed to be the oldest living white shark so far documented returning to the Farallones, estimated at 25–30 years old.

Some individual sharks have been tagged and found to roam the Pacific as far as Hawaii and Guadalupe Island off Baja California, returning regularly to the Farallones every year in the autumn. Satellite tracking has revealed the majority of great white sharks from the Farallones (and from other parts of California, Hawaii and the west coast of Mexico) migrate to an area of ocean dubbed the White Shark Café, west of Ensenada, Baja California. The peak of activity at this location is from mid-April to Mid-July, but some sharks spend up to eight months of the year there. This island has many migratory sharks return to its waters every year.

===Rodents===
The islands have tens of thousands of invasive house mice that are wreaking havoc on the native ecosystem. An average of 500 Eurasian house mice occupy each of its , with an approximate total population of 60,000.

==In literature and the arts==
The Farallones are briefly mentioned in Chapter 2 of Jack London&#x27;s 1904 novel &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; as the location of the schooner &quot;Ghost&quot;. Mr Johnson gives this position of the ship to Humphrey Van Weyden.

Abby Geni&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;The Lightkeepers&quot; is set on the Farallon Islands.

The Farallon Islands and their role in the Egg War of the Gold Rush era are documented in the 2017 &quot;The Kitchen Sisters Present&quot; podcast episode &quot;Egg Wars&quot;, in the 2019 episode &quot;The Egg Wars&quot; on the comedy podcast &quot;The Dollop&quot; , and in the 2020 &quot;Behind the Bastards&quot; podcast episode &quot;The War of the Eggs&quot;.

<text>[[Scott Robinson (Neighbours)|Scott Robinson]] and [[Charlene Robinson|Charlene Mitchell]] are fictional characters and a supercouple from the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Scott was portrayed by Jason Donovan, and Charlene was portrayed by Kylie Minogue.

==Development==
Scott Robinson is one of &quot;Neighbours&quot;&#x27; twelve original characters conceived by Reg Watson. He was originally played by Darius Perkins, but following his dismissal from the role, it was recast to Jason Donovan, who made his debut in January 1986, as the serial moved to Network Ten. In April of that year, Kylie Minogue was introduced as Charlene Mitchell, daughter of established character Madge Ramsay (Anne Charleston). Her arrival coincided with Ten&#x27;s efforts to publicise and revamp the serial to appeal to its strong teen demographic. Scott was the first character to interact with Charlene, as he mistakes her for a burglar and confronts her. Charlene then punches Scott in the mouth. Minogue ended up punching Donovan for real during the filming of the scene. Producers soon created a relationship story arc for the characters. Andrew Mercado, author of &quot;Super Aussie Soaps&quot;, wrote that &quot;Neighbours&quot; would have been &quot;dead in the water&quot; if it had not capitalised on the popularity of Donovan and Minogue. Their characters&#x27; relationship helped boost ratings, and the show&#x27;s publicist Brian Walsh used their rumoured off-screen romance to continue the rating success.

Minogue thought the romance between Scott and Charlene also helped them become fan favourites. She explained, &quot;In the storyline, they break up and get back together. People like Scott and Charlene being a couple. It&#x27;s probably the most normal relationship in the show.&quot; &quot;TV Week&quot;&#x27;s Kelly Bourne also noted that Scott and Charlene had struck a chord with fans, who felt that they could identify with them and share their &quot;joys, the pain of their fights and their fears of breaking up.&quot; Bourne also observed that viewers were &quot;keenly&quot; following the development of how a scripted romance led to Minogue and Donovan&#x27;s real-life relationship. On-screen, as their romance progresses, Charlene&#x27;s mother tries to persuade her to date other boys, while Scott repeats his final year of school. He realises that he wants to be with Charlene and the characters were seen declaring their love for each other. Scott also declares that they will move in together and buys Charlene a gold friendship ring. Minogue said Charlene is flattered by the gesture, while Donovan thought it settled the matter that they are not going to break up. Various characters voice their shock and disapproval at how serious the couple have become in 12 months.

In May 1987, Australian television magazine &quot;TV Week&quot; ran a competition asking for reader&#x27;s opinions on the controversial issue of whether the teen couple should live together. The publication thought the plot development would provoke a heated response from fans of the show, and wanted to know if they felt strongly for or against the idea. The magazine received thousands of responses and 70 per cent were in favour of seeing the couple live together. But there was concern about Scott and Charlene&#x27;s ages, which, at the time, were seventeen and eighteen respectively. A critic suggested that their parents should give them &quot;a firm smack on the backside with orders to grow up.&quot; Minogue thought the characters were a bit young to be living together, but she did not see anything morally wrong with it. She explained, &quot;Viewers should not see the live-in relationship as sinful because we are really trying to prove how difficult life is for teenagers when they leave the security of their parents&#x27; home.&quot; Donovan had friends who were living together, and he thought it was &quot;a very true picture of today&#x27;s teenagers.&quot; After &quot;stuffier viewers&quot; expressed their outrage about the young, unwed couple moving in together, producers decided the couple would marry instead.

The wedding allowed a discussion about teenage sexuality, and Donovan pointed out that since AIDS, there had been &quot;a swing back&quot; to romance and institutionalised relationships. Minogue thought the marriage would bring controversial subjects, such as pre-marital sex and AIDS, into focus. Scott and Charlene&#x27;s wedding episode was broadcast on 1 July 1987 to two million Australian viewers. The episode aired in the UK on 8 November 1988, and was watched by 20 million viewers. Minogue said the wedding was what Scott and Charlene&#x27;s romance had been building up to. While Donovan said the producers thought a wedding would be &quot;the perfect climax&quot; to the character&#x27;s relationship, as well as an instant ratings winner. As the couple went away on honeymoon, Donovan and Minogue toured Australia to promote the wedding and &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Their appearances caused riots among fans.

In 2014, Scott and Charlene&#x27;s son, Daniel Robinson (Tim Phillipps), was introduced to &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Phillipps confirmed that Scott and Charlene are still together and living in Brisbane. He said they were &quot;really loving, supportive parents&quot; to Daniel and his sister, Madison Robinson (Sarah Ellen), who was introduced in 2016. To prepare for the role, Ellen watched footage of Scott and Charlene, and thought her character shared a number of similarities to her mother.

Following the planned cancellation of &quot;Neighbours&quot; in March 2022, both Donovan and Minogue reprised their roles as Scott and Charlene for what was then thought to be the serial&#x27;s finale. They filmed their guest appearance on Pin Oak Court, which is the outdoor location for Ramsay Street. Of their return, executive producer Jason Herbison stated: &quot;Scott and Charlene are the ultimate &quot;Neighbours&quot; couple and it would not feel right to end the show without them. We are thrilled that Jason and Kylie have come home to play a very special part in our series finale. It has been an emotional experience for them, for us and I&#x27;m sure it will be for our viewers.&quot;

==Storylines==
Scott meets Charlene when he mistakes her for an intruder at his neighbour Madge Ramsay&#x27;s house. He soon remembers that Charlene is Madge&#x27;s daughter, who has just arrived from Queensland. After an initially rocky start, the two develop a relationship despite the respective opposition of their two families, the Ramsays and the Robinsons, who have been feuding for years. The two get engaged and marry. Their marriage is tested by financial struggles and infidelity. Charlene is offered a mechanic apprenticeship in Brisbane, and her grandfather Dan Ramsay (Syd Conabere) buys the couple a house there. Charlene is forced to leave without Scott, who has to stay behind and wait for a job transfer. He joins her ten months later. They later two have children; a son, Daniel and a daughter, Madison, respectively and return to Erinsborough themselves more than thirty years later for a street party following the wedding of Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and Melanie Pearson (Lucinda Cowden). They visit their old marital home, Number 24 Ramsay street, reunite with old friends Mike Young (Guy Pearce) and Jane Harris (Annie Jones) and also reconnect with Charlene&#x27;s stepfather, Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) and Scott&#x27;s brother, Paul (Stefan Dennis).

==Reception and impact==
The couple were hugely popular with &quot;Neighbours&quot; fans in both Australian and the United Kingdom, helping the show to gain high ratings after an initial rocky start. Melissa Field of &quot;TV Week&quot; said their &quot;teenage love story captured hearts across the world&quot; and she noted that viewers in Australia and the UK &quot;couldn&#x27;t get enough of their wholesome love&quot;. Eleanor Sprawson and Robert Fidgeon of the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; included Scott and Charlene in their list of the Top 50 TV characters. They stated &quot;Acid-wash jeans and mullet cut did not stop &quot;Neighbours&quot;&#x27; feisty mechanic-next-door from winning Scott&#x27;s heart in the definitive soapie love match of the &#x27;80s.&quot;

Scott and Charlene have been named one of television&#x27;s best couples by a number of media outlets. Keith Shar of Stuff.co.nz called Scott and Charlene &quot;the show&#x27;s most famous couple&quot;. A reporter for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; branded them &quot;a supercouple and a bit of a Romeo and Juliet as their two families had an ongoing feud.&quot; Heart Radio placed them at number one on their list of Iconic TV Soap Couples, saying &quot;Everyone&#x27;s favourite teenage sweethearts had us rooting for them throughout their time together in the Australian soap. Heartthrob Scott Robinson and the gorgeous Charlene Mitchell go through their fair share of teething problems as any young couple do, but go on to get hitched and going on to having two kids together.&quot;

Writing for BBC Online, Fraser McAlpine included Scott and Charlene in his feature on 30 years of much-loved TV couples, written shortly after Minogue and Donovan sang their duet &quot;Especially for You&quot; at 2018 Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park. McAlpine called them &quot;one of television&#x27;s most iconic romantic pairings&quot;. He also wrote: &quot;They were too young to handle their feelings, the archetypal teenage couple who found it hard to control the avalanche of emotions they were exposed to. Scott had to fend off pressure from his family to put his education first, while Charlene was a trainee mechanic with a short fuse and very little patience. Their arguments were frequent, the bickering constant, but through it all they formed a lasting bond.&quot;

The couple inspired the name of Australian indie rock band Scott &amp; Charlene&#x27;s Wedding. Singer-songwriter Craig Dermody explained: &quot;I remember sitting down and watching it with my mum. I just watched it as a kid and then stopped watching it. I remember [the wedding] being massive, it was as if it was a real wedding. Like a royal wedding, but in Australia.&quot; In 2014, the couple&#x27;s wedding came first in a poll to find 50 unforgettable moments in Network Ten&#x27;s history. Siobhan Duck of the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; wrote &quot;No moment in Network Ten&#x27;s 50-year history has made more of an impact on Australia than the 1987 wedding of a pair of teenage bogans. To the strains of Angry Anderson&#x27;s Suddenly, a young Charlene (Kylie Minogue) clad in the laciest gown that the 1980s had to offer, married her golden mullet-haired groom, Scott (Jason Donovan) before a riveted nation.&quot;

In 2020, the couple&#x27;s wedding was voted 5th &quot;most unforgettable moment in Australian TV history&quot; by readers of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Writing for the same newspaper, Anna Spargo-Ryan included the couple in her list of the 10 best characters, admitting that she felt some &quot;peer pressure&quot; to have them on the list. She also stated &quot;Scott and Charlene are the beating heart of &quot;Neighbours&quot;! They are the reason Erinsborough exists! No woman had ever been a mechanic before Kylie Minogue arrived on the street. Here&#x27;s my proposition: Scott and Charlene only work as a couple. They&#x27;re your co-dependent Facebook friend with a name like &#x27;BenAnd SarahJones&#x27;. Yes, adorable teenagers in love, but we have Baz Luhrmann for that. More drama, please.&quot;

<text>The 1949 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 29th term. It saw the governing Labour Party defeated by the opposition National Party. This marked the end of the 14-year First Labour government and the beginning of the First National government.

==Background==
The Labour Party had formed its first ministry after winning the 1935 election, and had remained in power (with gradually decreasing majorities) since then. The National Party, formed by a merger of the parties which Labour had originally ousted, gradually increased its power in Parliament; the ineffectual Adam Hamilton was replaced by Sidney Holland, and internal disputes were gradually resolved. The Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, was increasingly weary. Ongoing shortages after World War II also eroded public support for the government. The National Party&#x27;s decision not to repeal Labour&#x27;s social welfare policies also increased its appeal.

===MPs retiring in 1949===
Two Labour MPs and one National MP intended to retire at the end of the Parliament.

==The election==
The date for the main elections was a Wednesday 30 November. Elections to the four Māori electorates were held the day before—the 1949 elections were the last in which Māori voted on a different day. 1,113,852 people were registered to vote, although rolls for the Māori electorates were &quot;woefully inadequate.&quot; Voter turnout for the elections is disputed, given the problems with the Māori roll—some sources place it at 93.5 percent, while others estimate 92.9 percent. Regardless, the turnout was relatively high for the time. The number of seats being contested was 80, a number which had been fixed since 1902.

==Election results==

===Party standings===
The 1949 election saw the governing Labour Party defeated by a twelve-seat margin. It has previously held a four-seat majority. Labour won a total of 34 seats, as opposed to National&#x27;s 46. The popular vote was considerably closer—Labour won 47.2 percent to National&#x27;s 51.9 percent. No seats were won by minor party candidates or by independents.

John A. Lee stood for as the sole Democratic Labour candidate and got 2,627 votes, coming third.

<doc id="1232671" wikidata="Q11901158" url="?curid=1232671" title="MuchFACT">
<text>MuchFACT was a Canadian fund that provided grants to Canadian recording artists to help them produce music videos. FACT stands for Foundation To Assist Canadian Talent. MuchFACT was funded entirely by television cable channel Much (formerly MuchMusic) who committed a percentage of their gross annual revenues to the fund. It was previously funded by M3 (formerly MuchMore) but stopped after the channel was relaunched as Gusto.

==History==
VideoFACT (as it was originally known) was created in 1984 with the launch of MuchMusic as a condition of its licence applied by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Two years later with the launch of MusiquePlus, it also became a sponsor, as did MuchMoreMusic when it launched in 1998.

Along with the launch of MuchMoreMusic in 1998, a new fund in conjunction with VideoFACT was created called PromoFACT, to help assist in the creation of Electronic Press Kits (EPK) and website productions for Canadian artists, independent record labels and artist management companies. PromoFACT is funded exclusively by MuchMoreMusic.

Many of Canada&#x27;s most influential recording artists received VideoFACT funding for their early recordings, including Sam Roberts, K-os, Céline Dion, k.d. lang, Matthew Good, The Pursuit of Happiness, Bran Van 3000, Lara Fabian, Blue Rodeo, Rascalz, Sloan, Jean Leloup, Great Big Sea, Sarah McLachlan, Death From Above 1979, Carly Rae Jepsen, Dubmatique, Aspektz and Ashley MacIsaac among others.

The approach of monetary distribution used by VideoFACT and non-associated Canadian record funding organization (FACTOR) is not without critics. In 2008, the federally commissioned Wicks Report, instigated by then Prime Minister Stephen Harper, investigated VideoFACT and its granting apparatus. Chaired by the now defunct Burlington based melodic aggressive punk band The Tirekickers, the Wicks Report identified systemic bias against several specific musical genres, including hip-hop, trip-hop, and melodic aggressive punk rock. The Wicks Report&#x27;s 28 recommendations have yet to be implemented by the federal government.

In 2009, the organizations came under public scrutiny when a letter written by Unfamiliar Records founder Greg Ipp was republished on the internet - in turn promoting the idea that bigger image-based bands shouldn’t be getting such a huge amount of those finite funds as it leaves relatively little, if any, funding for the smaller up-and-coming bands.
 MuchFACT&#x27;s executive director publicly disagreed with Ipp however, and went on record to clarify that the foundation&#x27;s mandate was to support both new and existing talent.

In 2009, MusiquePlus discontinued its funding of VideoFACT, instead to focus funding on a similar French-language fund, MaxFACT. In September 2009, VideoFACT was later renamed MuchFACT.

In May 2017, the CRTC dropped the requirement for Bell Media to continue funding the program. MuchFACT was discontinued on September 26, 2017.

<text>Johannes Widmann (c. 1460 – after 1498) was a German mathematician. The + and - symbols first appeared in print in his book &quot;Mercantile Arithmetic&quot; or &quot;Behende und hüpsche Rechenung auff allen Kauffmanschafft&quot; published in Leipzig in 1489 in reference to surpluses and deficits in business problems.

Born in Eger, Bohemia, Widmann attended the University of Leipzig in the 1480s. In 1482 he earned his &quot;Baccalaureus&quot; (Bachelor of Art degree) and in 1485 his &quot;Magister&quot; (doctorate).

Widman published &quot;Behende und hübsche Rechenung auff allen Kauffmanschafft&quot; (German; i.e. Nimble and neat calculation in all trades), his work making use of the signs, in Leipzig in 1489. Further editions were published in Pforzheim, Hagenau, and Augsburg.
Handwritten entries in a surviving collection show that after earning his &quot;Magister&quot; Widman announced holding lectures on e.g. calculating on the lines of a calculating board and on algebra. There is evidence that the lecture on algebra actually took place, making it the first known university lecture on this topic.

Around 1495 Widmann published the Latin writings &quot;Algorithmus integrorum cum probis annexis&quot;, &quot;Algorithmus linealis&quot;, &quot;Algorithmus minutiarum phisicarum&quot;, &quot;Algorithmus minutiarum vulgarium&quot;, &quot;Regula falsi apud philosophantes augmenti et decrementi appellata und Tractatus proportionum plusquam aureus&quot;.

He died in Leipzig.

When Adam Ries was in Erfurt between 1518 and 1522 he got to know Widmann&#x27;s algebra lecture script (today in the Saxon State Library) wherefrom he took examples for his own writings.

<text>Ryan Walker Longwell (born August 16, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was a placekicker in the National Football League (NFL). After playing college football for the California Golden Bears, he started his professional career with the San Francisco 49ers, but never played a game for the franchise. He then played for the Green Bay Packers from 1997 to 2005. He played for the Minnesota Vikings from 2006 to 2011. He also played briefly for the Seattle Seahawks during the 2012 playoffs.

==Early life==
Longwell attended high school in Bend, Oregon, where he played high school football for Bend High School&#x27;s Lava Bears. A three-year letter winner in football as a kicker, Longwell also was the team&#x27;s backup quarterback. He also played baseball as a third baseman, earning three letters in that sport. He earned all-conference honors in both sports.

In 1993, he started college at the University of California, Berkeley where he played football and earned four varsity letters. At California he served as both a punter and placekicker for the team, earning all-conference honors in the Pac-10 his senior year as a punter and second team honors as a kicker. Longwell graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English.

==Professional football==

===Green Bay Packers===
Longwell was acquired by the Green Bay Packers off waivers from the San Francisco 49ers in 1997. With the Packers, Longwell played in Super Bowl XXXII, where he kicked one field goal and three extra points in their 31–24 loss to the Denver Broncos. He spent his first 9 seasons playing for the Packers, and scored over 120 points during 6 of those seasons. By the end of his 7th season in Green Bay, Longwell had passed Hall of Famer Don Hutson to become the Packers all-time leading scorer. And while Mason Crosby has since passed him, Longwell remains second on Green Bay&#x27;s all-time scoring list.

===Minnesota Vikings===
Longwell signed a free agent contract with the Vikings in the 2006 offseason. In his second game with the Minnesota Vikings, Longwell had one of the best performances of his career. He was responsible for all 16 of the Vikings points in a 16–13 win over the Carolina Panthers, kicking three field goals (including the game-winning field goal in overtime) and throwing a 16-yard touchdown pass on a fake field goal play in the fourth quarter. In the 2008 season finale against the New York Giants, he kicked a 50-yard field goal as time expired to help the Vikings clinch the division in a 20–19 victory.

During the 2010 offseason, Longwell, a close friend of Brett Favre, became a sort of unofficial spokesman for Favre, as the media frequently questioned him on whether Favre would return to the Vikings or retire. When Longwell picked Favre up at the airport in Minnesota on August 17, 2010, TV station helicopters followed Longwell&#x27;s SUV all the way to Vikings headquarters. In 2018, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

===Seattle Seahawks and retirement===
On January 8, 2013, Longwell was signed by the Seattle Seahawks after Steven Hauschka suffered a calf injury. On August 12, 2013, the Green Bay Packers announced that Longwell would retire as a Packer.

===Records===
* Second leading scorer in Green Bay Packers history with 1054 points.
* Has the second-most field goals in Green Bay Packers history with 226.
* Kicked third-longest field goal in Green Bay Packers history (54 yards - tied with Chris Jacke and Dave Rayner)
* Second most points by a player who never made a Pro Bowl (1,687) (Mason Crosby - 1,806).

==Career regular season statistics==
&quot;Career high/best bolded&quot;
==Family and personal life==
Longwell is the cousin of 1992 and 1996 Olympic athlete Michael Orr. He is married to Sarah Longwell, and they have two children, Shaye and Reece. Shaye played college tennis at LSU and Reece graduated from Georgia Tech.

In 2023, Longwell joined his alma mater, California, under head coach Justin Wilcox as a senior analyst.

<text>Noshaq, also called Noshakh or Nowshakh (, &quot;Nowshākh&quot;, lit. &quot;new horn&quot;), is the second highest peak in the Hindu Kush Range after Tirich Mir at . It lies on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The north and west sides of the mountain are in Afghanistan whereas the south and eastern sides are in Pakistan. Noshaq is Afghanistan&#x27;s highest mountain and is located in the northeastern corner of the country along the border with Pakistan. It is the westernmost peak in the world. The easiest access to Noshaq is from Wakhan Afghanistan.

== Climbing history ==
Noshaq main was first climbed by a Japanese expedition in 1960 led by Prof. Yajiro Sakato. Other members of the expedition were Goro Iwatsubo and Toshiaki Sakai. The climb followed the normal Afghanistan approach, the West ridge from the Qadzi Deh Glacier. The normal Afghanistan approach route is by the west ridge.

Noshaq East, Noshaq Central and Noshaq West were first climbed in 1963 by Austrians Dr. Gerald Gruber and Rudolf Pischenger.

The Tiroler Hindukusch-Ski-Expedition of Akademischer Alpenklub Innsbruck (Austria) made the first ski descent from the summit of Noshaq in 1970. The famous meteorologist Karl Gabl was a member of the team.

The first winter ascent was 13 February 1973 by Tadeusz Piotrowski and Andrzej Zawada, members of a Polish expedition, via the north face. It was the world&#x27;s first winter climb of any 7000 m peak. Until now it is the only winter ascent of this mountain.

Between the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the fall of the Taliban in 2001, the mountain was very difficult to access because of political turmoil in the region. In 2011, National Geographic noted that the trail to the summit was again accessible to climbers, with hopes of opening the area up for tourism.

<text>Richard Chatham Atkinson (born March 19, 1929) is an American professor of cognitive science and psychology and an academic administrator. He is president emeritus of the University of California system, former chancellor of the University of California, San Diego, and former director of the National Science Foundation.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Atkinson was born on March 19, 1929, in Oak Park, Illinois, to Herbert and Margaret Atkinson. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. at Indiana University. After serving two years in the U.S. Army, Atkinson joined the faculty at Stanford University in 1956. Except for three years at UCLA, he served on the Stanford faculty from 1956 to 1980.

=== Stanford University ===
At Stanford University he held appointments in the Department of Psychology, School of Engineering, Graduate School of Education, and Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences. In the mid-1960s, he began publishing a series of papers with his graduate students and postdoctoral fellows that formed the basis for a general theory of memory. A 1968 article called “Human Memory: A Proposed System and Its Control Processes,” co-authored with his graduate student, Richard Shiffrin, is one of the most cited publications in the behavioral and cognitive sciences over the past five decades; it still receives about 700 citations a year.

The Atkinson-Shiffrin paper proposes a memory system whose structure is fixed (sensory register, short-term store, long-term store) but whose control processes (encoding, storage, retrieval, and decision rules) are variable. The two authors describe a theory from which one can derive formal models to predict an individual&#x27;s performance on a variety of memory tasks. Their approach brought together the emerging fields of mathematical psychology and computer modeling to offer a cognitive view of memory. The general theory has withstood critical challenges and been considered the standard by which others are measured. &quot;Memory and Cognition&quot; devoted a special issue in 2019 to “Five Decades of Cumulative Progress in Understanding Human Memory and Its Control Processes Sparked by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968).”  In 2023, &quot;Journal of Memory and Language&quot; republished the 1968 paper, accompanied by an article on its historical significance.

Another focus of Atkinson&#x27;s research, conducted with his Stanford colleague Patrick Suppes, concerned developing computer-assisted instruction (CAI) to teach mathematics and reading to young children. An example is a program for teaching reading in grades K-3.  A “response history” is maintained on each student and continually updated. Built into the program is a model of the learning process that analyzes each student&#x27;s response history to make moment-by-moment decisions as to what should be studied next to optimize the student&#x27;s performance. Atkinson and Suppes later founded Computer Curriculum Corporation, the first company to introduce computers into the classroom.

While at Stanford, Atkinson served as founding editor for the &quot;Journal of Mathematical Psychology&quot;. He was also chair of the Mathematical Social Science Board of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, which ran summer institutes (among other activities) for advanced doctoral students interested in learning about mathematical models in the behavioral and social sciences. In 1967, Atkinson and his wife, Rita Loyd Atkinson, joined their Stanford colleague, Ernest Hilgard, as authors of the textbook &quot;Introduction to Psychology&quot;. They ceased being authors with the publication of the 12th edition, and in later editions the title was changed to &quot;Atkinson and Hilgard&#x27;s Introduction to Psychology&quot;.  Atkinson&#x27;s scientific work has been translated into nine languages, including a Russian and a Chinese translation of his collected papers.

=== National Science Foundation ===
In 1975, Atkinson took a leave of absence from Stanford to begin a temporary appointment as deputy director of the National Science Foundation (NSF). His career took a different course when he agreed to remain at NSF, serving first as acting director (1976-77) and then as director (1977-80) appointed by President Jimmy Carter.

Atkinson&#x27;s task was to lead the Foundation through what one commentator called “a rebuilding from the ravages of the Nixon anti-science era.” Skeptics in Congress and the media often attacked basic research, most of it conducted in universities, as a drain on public money that produced few practical results. Senator William Proxmire’s Golden Fleece Awards for waste and fraud in public programs were the best-known examples; NSF received several. In Congressional testimony and in the press, Atkinson defended the integrity of NSF&#x27;s peer review process and the seminal role basic research plays in laying the groundwork for advances in science and technology.

Atkinson established the NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Program at a time when collaborative research between private companies and universities, now accepted, was rare. He initiated a special program at NSF to fund research on the relationship between investments in research and economic growth, an early contribution to the field of economics known as “new growth theory”. H elevated engineering to a full directorate at NSF to reflect its importance to science and the nation. He advocated with Congress for legislation giving companies a tax credit for investing in their own research and for supporting university research. He began a series of policy studies that led to the1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which transferred the intellectual property rights in federally sponsored research from the U.S. government to universities.

In his role as NSF director, Atkinson also negotiated the first memorandum of understanding between the People’s Republic of China and the United States, an agreement for the exchange of scientists and scholars. It became part of a more comprehensive agreement on science and technology between China and the United States signed by President Carter and Chairman Deng Xiao Ping during the Chairman&#x27;s visit to the United States in January 1979.

=== UC San Diego ===
As chancellor of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) from 1980-1995, Atkinson instituted a major administrative reorganization and launched an effort to strengthen UC San Diego&#x27;s ties with the city of San Diego. This effort yielded dividends in the form of financial and community support, with private giving rising dramatically during his chancellorship. Despite a series of tight budgets in the late 1980s, he found ways to fund the construction of new buildings and support new academic programs. UCSD&#x27;s faculty expanded by nearly 50 percent and enrollment doubled to about 18,000 students. Early in his tenure, consistent with his views about the value of engineering at NSF, he established a school of engineering.

Atkinson encouraged technology transfer and active involvement with industry, especially with the small, high-technology companies that were forming around San Diego in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1985, UC San Diego Extension began the UCSD CONNECT program, which became a model for preparing entrepreneurs in high-technology fields to launch start-up companies.

A few years after Atkinson&#x27;s arrival at UCSD, a member of the Harvard University faculty, Lee H. Perry, sued him in San Diego Superior Court. Represented by the “palimony” attorney, Marvin Mitchelson, Perry claimed she had an intimate relationship with Atkinson that resulted in a pregnancy, and that Atkinson persuaded her to have an abortion, promising that he would have a child with her at a later time. Her lawsuit alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, and deceit.  Before trial, the Superior Court granted Atkinson&#x27;s motion for summary judgment on the fraud and deceit claim as initially filed, and sustained his demurrer to the claim as amended without further leave to amend (which operated as a dismissal of that claim). In 1986, the case went to trial on Perry&#x27;s remaining claim for emotional distress. Atkinson settled that claim without admitting liability, but Perry reserved the right to appeal from the trial court&#x27;s ruling on the demurrer to her fraud and deceit claim. In 1987, the Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Court&#x27;s dismissal of that claim. In 1988, the Supreme Court of California denied her petition for review, which effectively ended the case.

In 1982, UCSD was elected to the Association of American Universities. The National Research Council&#x27;s 1995 report on the quality of graduate programs in U.S. universities ranked the scholarly and scientific caliber of UCSD faculty and its graduate offerings tenth in the nation, higher than any other public university except UC Berkeley.

=== University of California System ===
The University of California Board of Regents chose Atkinson as the seventeenth president of the UC System in August 1995. One month earlier, the Regents had approved SP-1, a ban on racial and ethnic preferences in admissions.

Atkinson&#x27;s first step was to initiate an in-depth review of UC admissions in light of the University&#x27;s changed circumstances. The goal was to ensure that its policies and practices, while meeting the requirements of SP-1, would also continue to be “demonstrably inclusive and fair.”  The result of this review, approved by the Academic Senate and the Regents, was a broader, more flexible perspective on evaluating readiness for college. Along with the usual grades and test scores, the undergraduate admission process now included consideration of students’ “opportunity to learn,” defined as the educational, economic, or social difficulties the student had faced during schooling and evidence of persistence in working toward high academic achievement. In addition to these policy changes, the Regents’ resolution called on the administration to consult with various UC constituencies on developing “proposals for new directions and increased funding” to raise the UC eligibility rate of minority and other underrepresented students. The result was the report of the Outreach Task Force, presented to the Regents in July 1997.

In his first year as president, Atkinson established the Industry-University Cooperative Research Program (IUCRP), an investment in research partnerships with industry in disciplines essential to California&#x27;s high-tech economy. The program&#x27;s emphasis on promising early-stage research ripe for practical application was directed at stimulating California&#x27;s productivity and competitiveness. In the same spirit, Atkinson committed the University to addressing a crisis in the state&#x27;s supply of highly trained engineers and computer scientists. UC enrollments in these disciplines rose by nearly 70 percent—the first real growth in the state&#x27;s programs in engineering since the 1968 Terman Report virtually ended expansion of engineering education in California.

In 2000, Governor Gray Davis asked the University to establish four new research enterprises on its campuses, the California Institutes for Science and Innovation. Their mission is to generate discoveries ripe for application in the fields of biomedicine, bioengineering, nanosystems, telecommunications, and information technology through partnerships with the state&#x27;s entrepreneurial industries.

The Board of Regents voted unanimously to rescind SP-1 at its May 2001 meeting. The 1996 passage of Proposition 209, which eliminated racial and ethnic preferences in all State entities, including the University of California, meant SP-1 had become redundant. More troubling to some Regents was the concern that the 1995 policy “may have created the perception that underrepresented students were unwelcome at the University.” The Board&#x27;s resolution reaffirmed the Academic Senate&#x27;s authority over admissions standards and UC&#x27;s responsibility for selecting a diverse and highly qualified student body. In a February 2001 speech at the American Council on Education, Atkinson announced he was recommending elimination of the SAT as a requirement for admission to the University of California.

=== Post-retirement ===
After retiring from the presidency in 2003, Atkinson became chair of the Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education and served in that position until 2011. The division, part of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, works to advance the frontiers of the behavioral and social sciences and their applications to public policy. Atkinson and his wife, Rita Loyd, met in graduate school at Indiana University and were married until her death on Christmas Day 2020.

=== Honors ===
Atkinson has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the National Academy of Education (NAEd), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He is past president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, former chair of the Association of American Universities, and the recipient of many honorary degrees.The National Science Board selected him for the Vannevar Bush Award in 2003 for his contributions to the scientific enterprise. A mountain in Antarctica is named in his honor.

<text>The Kumbaya Festival was an annual Canadian music and arts festival in the 1990s. It was organized by Molly Johnson as a benefit for Canadian charities and groups doing work around HIV and AIDS.

The festival was broadcast live on MuchMusic each year, with the broadcast including a toll-free number which home viewers could call to make additional donations. Compilation CDs of performances from the festival were also subsequently released to raise additional funds. The festival raised over $1 million during its years of activity.

Each annual festival consisted primarily of musical performers, although each also featured numerous writers reading literary pieces, as well as actors, media personalities, HIV/AIDS activists and other Canadian public figures speaking on the importance of the HIV/AIDS issue.

Although the Kumbaya Foundation, the organization which staged the festival, is still active in Canadian and international HIV/AIDS fundraising as of 2014, the festival itself has not been staged since 1996. Johnson has, however, expressed an interest in reviving the festival.

<text>Yegor Ilyich Titov (; born 29 May 1976) is a Russian football coach and former player who played as an attacking midfielder. He was known for his playmaking abilities, vision, ball control and accurate passing.

==Career==
Born in Moscow, Titov spent the majority of his club career at Spartak Moscow, starting in 1995, helping them to six consecutive league titles, and winning Russian Player of the Year in 1998 and 2000. He played for Russia at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and has amassed over 30 caps for his country. After a Euro 2004 playoff against Wales he was tested positive for the banned substance bromantan and received a 12-month suspension. Later, former Spartak players Maksim Demenko and Vladyslav Vashchuk along with physio Artyom Katulin blamed Katulin&#x27;s assistant Anatoly Schukin, who allegedly acted on behalf of manager Andrey Chernyshov. In 2008, Titov had made similar statements in his interview to Sovetsky Sport. After the ban, he has continued playing for Spartak and has been a major figure for the club when Spartak managed to finish 2nd in the 2005, 2006 and 2007 seasons, thus qualifying for the UEFA Champions League.

In 2002, Titov was reportedly close to a move to La Liga side Atlético Madrid, but eventually decided against joining the Spanish outfit.

Titov, who was just several years ago was considered one of Russia&#x27;s key players stopped playing for the team when he refused to be called up for a Euro 2008 qualifying match against Estonia, saying the reason was because his wife was pregnant and he wants to spend more time with her.

Due to several factors, including a recent severe loss of form and conflicts with Spartak Moscow&#x27;s manager, Titov became unsettled and, in August 2008, left to join Khimki.

In the beginning of 2009, Yegor signed with the newly formed club Lokomotiv Astana. He joined the Kazakh side with his former teammate Andrey Tikhonov.

He retired from professional football in early 2010. In early 2012, he played several games for Arsenal Tula which played in the fourth-tier Russian Amateur Football League at the time and was managed by his former Spartak and Russia teammate Dmitri Alenichev. Alenichev hired him as his assistant when he was hired as the manager of Spartak Moscow in the summer of 2015.

<doc id="1232743" wikidata="Q2495640" url="?curid=1232743" title="Universal science">
<text>Universal science (; ) is a branch of metaphysics, dedicated to the study of the underlying principles of all science. Instead of viewing knowledge as being separated into branches, Universalists view all knowledge as being part of a single category. Universal science is related to, but distinct from universal language.

== Precursors ==
Logic and rationalism lie at the foundation of the ideas of universal science. In a broad sense, logic is the study of reasoning. Although there were individuals that implicitly utilized logical methods prior to Aristotle, it is generally agreed he was the originator of modern systems of logic. The Organon, Aristotle&#x27;s books on logic, details this system. In Categories, Aristotle separates everything into 10 &quot;categories&quot;: substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, and passion. In De Interpretatione, Aristotle studied propositions, detailing what he determined were the most basic propositions and the relationships between them. The Organon had several other books, which further detailed the process of constructing arguments, deducing logical consequences, and even contained the foundations of the modern scientific method. 

The most immediate predecessor to universal science is the system of formal logic, which is the study of the abstract notions of propositions and arguments, usually utilizing symbols to represent these structures. Formal logic differs from previous systems of logic by looking exclusively at the structure of an argument, instead of at the specific aspects of each statement. Thus, while the statements &quot;Jeff is shorter than Jeremy and Jeremy is shorter Aidan, so Jeff is shorter than Aidan&quot; and &quot;Every triangle has less sides than every rectangle and every rectangle has less sides than every pentagon, so every triangle has less sides than every pentagon&quot; deal with different specific information, they are both are equivalent in formal logic to the expression

formula_1. 

By abstracting away from the specifics of each statement and argument, formal logic allows the overarching structure of logic to be studied. This viewpoint inspired later logicians to seek out a set of minimal size containing all of the requisite knowledge from which everything else could be derived and is the fundamental idea behind universal science. 

== Llull ==
Ramon Llull was a 13th century Catalan philosopher, mystic, and poet. He is best known for creating an &quot;art of finding truth&quot; with the intention of unifying all knowledge. Llull sought to unify philosophy, theology, and mysticism through a single universal model to understand reality. 

Llull compiled his thoughts into his work Ars Magna, which had several versions. The most thorough and complete version being the Ars Generalis Ultima, which he wrote several years before his death. The Ars Generalis Ultima consisted of several books, which explained the Ars, his universal system to understand all of reality. The books included the principles, definitions, and questions, along with ways to combine these things, which Llull thought could serve as the basis from which reality could be studied. Since he was primarily focused upon faith and Christianity, the content of these books was also mainly concerned with religious ideas and concepts. In fact, the Ars contained figures and diagrams representing ideas from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism to serve as a tool to aid philosophers from each of the three religions to discuss ideas in a logical manner. 

== Leibniz ==
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a 17th century German philosopher, mathematician, and political adviser, metaphysician, and logician, distinguished for his achievements including the independent creation of the mathematical field of Calculus. 

Leibniz entered the University of Leipzig in 1661, which is where he first studied the teachings of many famous scientists and philosophers, such as Rene Descartes, Galileo Galilei, Francis Bacon, and Thomas Hobbes. These individuals, together with Aristotle, influenced Leibniz&#x27;s future philosophical ideas, with one major idea being the reconciliation of the ideas of modern philosophers with the thoughts of Aristotle, already demonstrating Leibniz&#x27;s interest in unification. 

Unification played a major role in one of Leibniz&#x27;s early works, Dissertatio de arte Combinatoria. Written in 1666, De arte Combinatoria was a mathematical and philosophical text that served as the basis for Leibniz&#x27;s future goal for a universal science. The text starts by analysis several mathematical problems in combinatorics, the study of ways in which objects can be arranged. While the mathematics in the text was not revolutionary, the main impact came from the ideas Leibniz derived following the mathematics. Taking major influence from Ramon Llull&#x27;s ideas in his Ars Magna, Leibniz argued that the solution to these combinatorial problems served as a base for all logic and reasoning, since all of human knowledge could be viewed as different permutations of some base set. 

Leibniz&#x27;s ideas about unifying human knowledge culminated in his Characteristica universalis, which was a proposed language that would allow for logical statements and arguments to become symbolic calculations. Leibniz aimed to construct &quot;the alphabet of human thought,&quot; which was the collection of all of the &quot;primitives&quot; from which all human thought could be derived through the processes described in de arte Combinatoria. 

== Modern Influences ==
Although it has never been constructed, the ideas behind Leibniz&#x27;s universal science have permeated the thoughts of many modern mathematics and philosophers. George Boole, a 19th century English mathematician, expanded upon the ideas of Leibniz. He is responsible for the modern symbolic system logic, aptly called Boolean Algebra. Boole&#x27;s logical system, and thus also Leibniz&#x27;s logical system, served as the foundation for modern computers and electronic circuitry. 

The fundamental ideas of universal science can also be seen in the modern axiomatic system of mathematics, which constructs mathematical theories as consequences of a set of axioms. In this case, axioms are the primitive elements from which all further propositions can be derived. Hilbert&#x27;s Program was an attempt by German mathematician David Hilbert to axiomatize all of mathematics in the above manner, and additionally to prove that these axiomatic systems are consistent. Kurt Gödel was an Austrian mathematician and logician, who furthered the investigations in logic and the foundations of mathematics began by Hilbert and Russell in the early 20th century. Gödel is most famous for his incompleteness theorems, which encompass two theorems about provability and completeness of logical systems. In his first theorem, Gödel asserts that any formal system that includes arithmetic will have a statement which cannot be proven nor disproven within the system. His second theorem stated that a formal system additionally cannot prove that it is consistent, using methods only from that system. Thus, Gödel essentially refuted Hilbert&#x27;s Program, along with aspects of universal science.

<text>American Government is a 2012 textbook, now in its seventeenth edition, by the noted public administration scholar James Q. Wilson and political scientist John J. DiIulio, Jr. DiIulio is a Democrat who served as the director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives under president George W. Bush in 2001. Wilson, a Republican, chaired and participated in numerous White House task forces and commissions, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by president George W. Bush in 2003. Wilson died in March 2012.

The book examines and analyzes the government of the United States, covering every aspect of government from elections to interest groups. The current edition, &quot;American Government: Institutions and Policies&quot; also lists co-authors Meena Bose and Matthew Levendusky. It is published by Cengage Learning.

This book is currently used in both college and Advanced Placement high school courses across the United States. The book is roughly 780 pages and includes the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Bill of Rights, outcomes of various elections throughout U.S. history, and famous court cases. It is accompanied by a companion website that features practice test questions and detailed explanations on each chapter.

==Controversy==
The textbook became an item of national news coverage in April 2008. Matthew LaClair, a New Jersey high school senior, expressed concerns to the think tank Center for Inquiry regarding what he felt was conservative bias in the textbook and inaccuracies about its coverage of global warming. He wrote an opinion piece in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. The group issued a critical report on the textbook. The group&#x27;s criticism of the coverage on climate was buttressed by a few scientists and then additional criticism from legal scholars, who claimed the book presented a skewed view of separation of church and state. The publisher, Houghton Mifflin, announced that it would review the book, as did the College Board, which oversees college-level Advanced Placement courses used in high schools.

Wilson responded to the complaint in an editorial, arguing both that the text is not unduly biased and falsely claiming that dispute with regard to global warming is considerable.

<text>Manu National Park () is a national park and biosphere reserve located in the regions of Madre de Dios and Cusco in Peru. It protects a diverse number of ecosystems including lowland rainforests, cloud forests and Andean grasslands.

== History ==
Manu National Park was established by decree on 29 May 1973; during the dictatorship of General Juan Velasco. In 1977, UNESCO recognised it as a Biosphere Reserve and in 1987, as a World Heritage Site. In 2002, the Peruvian government increased the extension of the park to its current area.

==Geography==
Manu National Park covers an area of which comprises mountainous areas (traversed by creeks and valleys) with elevations close to 4000 m above sea level and a portion of the Amazon Basin plains.

The national park is divided in the following areas: the restricted use zone (with pristine forests and native communities, access is granted to researchers only); the reserved zone (for recreation and research); the recuperation zone (for the recovery of disturbed areas) and the cultural zone (for human settlement and most activities including nature tourism).

The Manu road is the only link between the highlands of the park and the lowlands where the mouth of the Manu River is located.

==Climate==

Climate in the park is highly variable, with the amount of rain depending on the elevation. The southern section (mountainous) has an annual precipitation between 1500–2000 mm; while in the middle section it is between 3000–3500 mm and in the northwestern section the annual precipitation reaches 8000 mm or more. The less rainy season is from May to September, accompanied by lower temperatures.

In the park, the mean annual temperature in the lowland rainforest is 25.6 °C, while in the Andean zone it is 8 °C.

== Ecology ==

=== Plants ===
Vegetation types inside the park include puna grassland (in areas over 4000 m), high Andean forests, cloud forests and lowland Amazon rainforest. This variety of vegetation types is represented in 162 families, 1191 genera and 4385 identified species of plants, with as much as 250 tree species in one hectare. A study found a total of 1108 species of trees inside the park, from several plots between the mountain tree line and the lowland forest.

Plant species found in the lowland rainforest zone of the park include: &quot;Bertholletia excelsa, Nectandra&quot; spp&quot;., Cedrelinga cateniformis&quot;, &quot;Socratea exorrhiza&quot;, &quot;Eugenia&quot; spp.&quot;,&quot; &quot;Cedrela odorata&quot;, &quot;Brosimum lactescens&quot;, &quot;Iriartea deltoidea&quot;, &quot;Protium&quot; spp.&quot;, Poulsenia armata, Cecropia&quot; spp., &quot;Inga&quot; spp., &quot;Margaritaria nobilis&quot;, &quot;Ceiba samauma&quot;, &quot;Solanum grandiflorum&quot;, &quot;Annona excellens&quot;, &quot;Calophyllum brasiliense&quot;, &quot;Simarouba amara&quot;, &quot;Maxillaria&quot; spp., &quot;Virola calophylla&quot;, &quot;Ficus&quot; spp., &quot;Trema micrantha&quot;, &quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;, &quot;Piper&quot; spp., &quot;Mauritia flexuosa&quot;, &quot;Clusia&quot; spp., &quot;Euterpe precatoria&quot;, &quot;Jacaranda copaia&quot;, etc. Plant species found in the mountain zones in the park include: &quot;Podocarpus oleifolius&quot;, &quot;Prunus integrifolia&quot;, &quot;Cyrtochilum aureum,&quot; &quot;Escallonia myrtilloides&quot;, &quot;Hesperomeles ferruginea&quot;, &quot;Otoglossum scansor&quot;, &quot;Baccharis salicifolia&quot;, &quot;Cinchona pubescens, Oreopanax&quot; spp., &quot;Polylepis pauta&quot;, &quot;Alnus acuminata&quot;, &quot;Retrophyllum rospigliosii, Vallea stipularis,&quot; etc.

In 2021, the so-called “Manu Mystery Plant”, a small tree, with tiny white flowers and ribbed, bright orange fruit, was determined to be a distinct genus, which was named Aenigmanu (the enigma of Manu). The plant, first collected in 1973 by Field Museum ecologist Robin Foster, had puzzled experts for decades. DNA analysis revealed it to be related to the Picramniaceae; but unlike this family, the Aenigmanu has stipules on its stems where the leaves emerge.

=== Fauna ===
About 160 species of mammals have been reported in the park. Mammals found in the lowland rainforest zone of the park include: the jaguar, the tayra, the giant armadillo, the puma (also present in mountainous areas), the ocelot, the collared peccary, the giant otter, the Peruvian spider monkey, the Mexican free-tailed bat, the jaguarundi, the capybara, the tufted capuchin, the white-lipped peccary, the greater bulldog bat, the Southern Amazon red squirrel, the marsh deer, the water opossum, the red brocket, the brown-throated sloth, the black-capped squirrel monkey, the South American tapir, the southern tamandua, the moustached tamarin, the pacarana, etc. Mammals reported from mountain zones in the park include: the white-tailed deer, the Andean fox, the mountain paca, the long-tailed weasel, the montane guinea pig, the spectacled bear, etc.

<text>This is a list of members of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] from 1990 to 1993, as elected at the 1990 federal election.

: Menzies Liberal MP Neil Brown resigned in early 1991. Liberal candidate Kevin Andrews won the resulting by-election.
: Wills Labor MP and outgoing Prime Minister Bob Hawke resigned in early 1992. Independent candidate Phil Cleary won the resulting by-election, only to have the result overturned by the Court of Disputed Returns in the landmark case &quot;Sykes v Cleary&quot; on the grounds that Cleary, a school teacher, was in the employ of the government at the time. Another by-election was not held due to the proximity of the 1993 election, where Cleary, having resigned his teaching position, again won the seat.
: Capricornia Labor MP Keith Wright was charged with sex offences in late 1992. He subsequently lost preselection to recontest his seat at the 1993 federal election, and was expelled from the party on 20 February 1993 after nominating to recontest his seat as an independent.

<doc id="1232758" wikidata="Q1071425" url="?curid=1232758" title="Turneraceae">
<text>Turneraceae Kunth ex DC. () was a family of flowering plants consisting of 120 species in 10 genera. The Cronquist system placed the Turneracids in the order Violales, but it is not currently recognized as a family by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group in the APG III system of 2009, which includes the taxa in the Turneraceae in Passifloraceae as a subfamily (Turneroideae).

==Description==
Most species in Turneraceae are tropical or sub-tropical shrubs, with a few trees. Half of the family&#x27;s species belong to the genus &quot;Turnera&quot;, including the herb damiana (&quot;T. diffusa, T. aphrodisiaca&quot;), the yellow alder (&quot;T. pumilea&quot;), which is not really an alder, and the &quot;ramgoat dashalong&quot; (&quot;T. ulmifolia&quot;). Another type of plant in Turneraceae with a vernacular name is stripeseed, which is actually three different species of the genus &quot;Piriqueta&quot; - the pitted stripeseed (&quot;P. cistoides&quot;), the rigid stripeseed (&quot;P. racemosa&quot;), and the purple stripeseed (&quot;P. viscosa&quot;).

==Genera==
The genera typically included in this family are:
*&quot;Adenoa&quot;
*&quot;Erblichia&quot;
*&quot;Hyalocalyx&quot;
*&quot;Loewia&quot;
*&quot;Mathurina&quot;
*&quot;Piriqueta&quot;
*&quot;Stapfiella&quot;
*&quot;Streptopetalum&quot;
*&quot;Tricliceras&quot; (&quot;Wormskioldia&quot;)

<text>The Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21 or Baade&#x27;s Star) is a relatively young neutron star. The star is the central star in the Crab Nebula, a remnant of the supernova SN 1054, which was widely observed on Earth in the year 1054. Discovered in 1968, the pulsar was the first to be connected with a supernova remnant.
The Crab Pulsar is one of very few pulsars to be identified optically. The optical pulsar is roughly in diameter and has a rotational period of about 33 milliseconds, that is, the pulsar &quot;beams&quot; perform about 30 revolutions per second. The outflowing relativistic wind from the neutron star generates synchrotron emission, which produces the bulk of the emission from the nebula, seen from radio waves through to gamma rays. The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar&#x27;s equatorial wind slams into the surrounding nebula, forming a termination shock. The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly, with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp-like features that steepen, brighten, then fade as they move away from the pulsar into the main body of the nebula. The period of the pulsar&#x27;s rotation is increasing by 38 nanoseconds per day due to the large amounts of energy carried away in the pulsar wind.

The Crab Nebula is often used as a calibration source in X-ray astronomy. It is very bright in X-rays, and the flux density and spectrum are known to be constant, with the exception of the pulsar itself. The pulsar provides a strong periodic signal that is used to check the timing of the X-ray detectors. In X-ray astronomy, &quot;crab&quot; and &quot;millicrab&quot; are sometimes used as units of flux density. A millicrab corresponds to a flux density of about () in the 2–10 keV X-ray band, for a &quot;crab-like&quot; X-ray spectrum, which is roughly power-law in photon energy: &quot;I&quot; ~ &quot;E&quot;−1.1.
Very few X-ray sources ever exceed one crab in brightness.

Pulsed emission up to 1.5 TeV has been detected from the Crab pulsar. The only other known pulsar with emission in this energy range is the Vela Pulsar at 20 TeV.

==History of observation==

The Crab Nebula was identified as the remnant of SN 1054 by 1939. Astronomers then searched for the nebula&#x27;s central star.
There were two candidates, referred to in the literature as the &quot;north following&quot; and &quot;south preceding&quot; stars. In September 1942, Walter Baade ruled out the &quot;north following&quot; star but found the evidence inconclusive for the &quot;south preceding&quot; star.
Rudolf Minkowski, in the same issue of &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot; as Baade, advanced spectral arguments claiming that the &quot;evidence admits, but does not prove, the conclusion that the south preceding star is the central star of the nebula&quot;.
In late 1968, David H. Staelin and Edward C. Reifenstein III reported the discovery of two rapidly varying radio sources &quot;near the crab nebula that could be coincident with it&quot; using the Green Bank radio antenna. They were given the designations NP 0527 and NP 0532. The period of 33 milliseconds and location of the Crab Nebula pulsar NP 0532 was discovered by Richard V. E. Lovelace and collaborators on 10 November 1968, at the Arecibo Radio Observatory. The discovery of the pulsar with such a short period proved that pulsars are rotating neutron stars (not pulsating white dwarfs, as many scientists suggested). Soon after the discovery of the Crab Pulsar, David Richards discovered (using the Arecibo Telescope) that it spins down and, therefore, loses its rotational energy. Thomas Gold has shown that the pulsar&#x27;s spin-down power is sufficient to power the Crab Nebula.

A subsequent study by them, including William D. Brundage, also found that the NP 0532 source is located at the Crab Nebula. A radio source was also reported coincident with the Crab Nebula in late 1968 by L. I. Matveenko in &quot;Soviet Astronomy&quot;.

Optical pulsations were first reported by Cocke, Disney and Taylor using the telescope on Kitt Peak of the Steward Observatory of the University of Arizona. This observation had an audio tape recording the pulses and this tape also recorded the voices of John Cocke, Michael Disney and Bob McCallister (the night assistant) at the time of the discovery. Their discovery was confirmed by Nather, Warner and Macfarlane.
Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who co-discovered the first pulsar PSR B1919+21 in 1967, relates that in the late 1950s a woman viewed the Crab Nebula source at the University of Chicago&#x27;s telescope, then open to the public, and noted that it appeared to be flashing. The astronomer she spoke to, Elliot Moore, disregarded the effect as scintillation, despite the woman&#x27;s protestation that as a qualified pilot she understood scintillation and this was something else. Bell Burnell notes that the 30 Hz frequency of the Crab Nebula optical pulsar is difficult for many people to see.

In 2007, it was reported that Charles Schisler detected a celestial source of radio emission in 1967 at the location of the Crab Nebula, using a United States Air Force radar system in Alaska designed as an early warning system to detect intercontinental ballistic missiles. This source was later understood by Schisler to be the Crab Pulsar, after the news of Bell Burnell&#x27;s initial pulsar discoveries was reported. However, Schisler&#x27;s detection was not reported publicly for four decades due to the classified nature of the radar observations.

The Crab Pulsar was the first pulsar for which the &quot;spin-down limit&quot; was broken using several months of data of the LIGO observatory. Most pulsars do not rotate at constant rotation frequency, but can be observed to slow down at a very slow rate (3.7 Hz/s in case of the Crab). This spin-down can be explained as a loss of rotation energy due to various mechanisms. The spin-down limit is a theoretical upper limit of the amplitude of gravitational waves that a pulsar can emit, assuming that all the losses in energy are converted to gravitational waves. No gravitational waves observed at the expected amplitude and frequency (after correcting for the expected Doppler shift) proves that other mechanisms must be responsible for the loss in energy. The non-observation so far is not totally unexpected, since physical models of the rotational symmetry of pulsars puts a more realistic upper limit on the amplitude of gravitational waves several orders of magnitude below the spin-down limit. It is hoped that with the improvement of the sensitivity of gravitational wave instruments and the use of longer stretches of data, gravitational waves emitted by pulsars will be observed in future. The only other pulsar for which the spin-down limit was broken so far is the Vela Pulsar.
In 2019 the Crab Nebula, and presumably therefore the Crab Pulsar, was observed to emit gamma rays in excess of 100 TeV, making it the first identified source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

In 2023, very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) was used to conduct precision astrometry using the radio giant-pulse emission of the Crab Pulsar, thus measuring a precise distance to the Crab Pulsar.

<text>Ram Chandra Kak (5 June 1893 – 10 February 1983) was the prime minister of Jammu and Kashmir during 1945–1947. One of the very few Kashmiri Pandits to ever hold that post, Kak had the intractable job of navigating the troubled waters of the transfer of power from British Raj to the independent dominions of India and Pakistan.

Kak was also a pioneering archaeologist who excavated the major sites of antiquities in Kashmir Valley and wrote a definitive treatise on them.

== Early life ==
Ram Chandra Kak was born to a prominent Kashmiri Pandit family in Srinagar. Ram Chandra Kak was the second among seven children (four sons and three daughters) of Keshav Lal Kak (b. 1873) —a money-lender and part time trader— and Bhageshwari Devi. He spent his early life in the Gurguri Mohalla of Srinagar. Kak graduated from Sri Pratap College in 1913 and enrolled for a M. A., before being selected for training in archaeology. From 1914 to 1919, Kak trained under John Marshall.

==Career==
After training, Kak was appointed as the superintendent of the newly established Department of Archaeology, before being promoted to the Director. He also served as the curator of SPS Museum, and Librarian of Maharaja Hari Singh&#x27;s private library.

Kak was appointed to the post of Chief Secretary in 1934, followed by Inspector General of Customs &amp; Excise in 1935. In 1938, he was inducted as the &quot;Political Advisor&quot; to the Maharaja, and then as the Minister of Military Affairs in 1941. He held the role of &quot;minister-in-waiting&quot; for the Maharaja Hari Singh during 1942–1945.

=== Prime minister of Jammu and Kashmir ===
Kak was appointed the prime minister of Jammu and Kashmir from June 1945 until 11 August 1947, during the key transitional period when the British were preparing for departure from India.

==== 1946 ====
In 1946, as the National Conference (NC) began the Quit Kashmir movement against the Maharaja, Kak declared martial law and had all leaders arrested on 20 May. Sheikh Abdullah was soon sentenced to imprisonment for three years. Jawaharlal Nehru attempted to appear as his defence counsel but his entry to Srinagar was blocked by Kak on 21 July. Kak remained defiant despite multiple Congress leaders requesting him to have Abdullah released.

Kak, in an unpublished memoir on the accession-disputes, claims to have been ill-disposed to these pleas because the Indian National Congress (INC) had lent its &quot;great weight of authority&quot; to Abdullah&#x27;s misplaced agitation; INC is castigated for publishing &quot;highly coloured, inaccurate and vituperative statements&quot; and passing resolutions against Singh&#x27;s government. These unfavorable views about INC would guide his (and Maharaja&#x27;s) decision to not accede to India —rather than any fundamental objection to the accession itself—, next month. In late July, Kak met with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel —who was to become the home minister of the Interim Government of India— but discussions did not get very far. Patel advised that Sheikh Abdullah be released from prison and steps taken to improve relations between the ruler and the people much to the displeasure of Kak, who rejected Patel&#x27;s authority and jurisdiction. Patel took offence at what he called the &quot;cold, official touch-me-not attitude&quot; and rejected supporting any plan involving complete independence for Kashmir.

Kak&#x27;s initiative having ended in failure, the British Resident in Kashmir reported in November that Kashmir was likely to stay out of the Indian Union — the cited reason was &quot;antagonism [...] displayed by a Congress Central Government&quot;.

==== 1947 ====
After the Partition of India was decided in June 1947, a decision on accession became imminent. Lord Mountbatten visited Kashmir in June (19–23 June) and coaxed Kak as well as Singh into choosing a side while guaranteeing the continuance of constitutional monarchy; on being asked by Kak about the &quot;right choice&quot;, he hinted in favor of Pakistan. However, accession to Pakistan did not appeal to Kak and he concluded that &quot;since Kashmir &quot;would&quot; not accede to Pakistan, it &quot;could&quot; not accede to India&quot;. Kak advised the Maharaja of Kashmir to remain independent for at least a year, before deciding on the issue of accession.

In July, Kak met the leaders of INC and Muslim League at New Delhi. Jinnah, coordinating the accession of princely states to Pakistan, promised lucrative terms on an immediate deal but Kak stood by his earlier position. Jinnah did not mind as long as Kashmir did not accede to India. Kak also met V. P. Menon, the secretary in charge of princely states for India, and would later claim to have had him convinced about Kashmir&#x27;s reasons for not acceding on an immediate basis; India was also apparently requested to help with the state&#x27;s &#x27;security arrangements&#x27;. In contrast, Menon would hold Kak&#x27;s replies to be evasive and note that &quot;he could neither understand the man [Kak] nor fathom his game&quot;. General Henry Scott, the Chief of Staff of State Forces, in his last report opined that Kak favored independence but closer ties with Pakistan.

On 1 August 1947, Gandhi visited Kashmir and pointed out to Kak how unpopular he was among the people. In response, Kak offered to resign. However, the Maharaja —who was increasingly against joining Pakistan due to a variety of reasons and trying to repair relationships with INC— is believed to have already decided, a few weeks earlier, to dismiss Kak for being an impediment to the process, and declare general amnesty to political prisoners.

==== Dismissal ====
Kak was dismissed as Prime Minister on 11 August 1947 and put under house arrest; he was replaced with a retired army officer Janak Singh. According to Kak, all senior officials such as the Chief Secretary, the Chief of the Army Staff, the Inspector General of Police were also replaced by less experienced people from the Maharaja&#x27;s own community, which Kak described as a &quot;decapitation&quot; of the State administration. According to Henry Lawrence Scott, the Maharaja acted under influence of the Deputy Prime Minister M L. Batra, a Hindu swami, and the Maharani&#x27;s brother Nachint Chand, all of whom wanted Kashmir to join India at the earliest. 

Kak would return to the Maharaja&#x27;s service a few weeks later, though not as the prime minister. On 14 September, the Maharaja informed Kak about forming a committee to enquire into his actions as the erstwhile Prime-Minister of the state; Kak declined to participate. On 16 September, Kak attempted to leave the state along with his family, having arranged a flight with help from Scott. But his departure was blocked by the Maharaja, and he was put under house arrest. However, with Scott&#x27;s support, his family was allowed to leave on 22 September.

==== Trial ====
After the tribal invasion in October, the Maharaja signed accession to the Dominion of India and moved to Jammu. Sheikh Adbdullah was appointed as the Head of Emergency Administration in Srinagar. Kak&#x27;s detention was continued and he was moved to the Badami Bagh. Kak&#x27;s wife, Margaret Kak, lobbied with the Mountbattens arguing for Kak&#x27;s release and even Stafford Cripps in London raised it with Jawaharlal Nehru. Sheikh Abdullah&#x27;s administration maintained that they had evidence that Kak was hobnobbing with the Pakistani raiders and agents. In his autobiography, Sheikh Abdullah held that Kak believed Kashmir, being a Muslim majority state, was bound to accede to Pakistan and prepared to be in its service; nonetheless, he praised Kak for maintaining good relations with the ruling circles in Pakistan.

Kak was tied to hay-ropes and paraded through the streets. Kashmiris aligned to the National Conference heckled him. In April 1948, he was tried for three criminal offences — he was acquitted on two counts but convicted of the third, and jailed. He was pardoned (and released), arguably under pressure from Delhi, but on the condition that he may never enter Kashmir without the permission of the state. Kak retired from public life, and migrated to Kasauli.

In 1959, the Chief Justice of Jammu and Kashmir High Court —Syed Murtaza Fazl Ali— voided the externment order upon an appeal from Kak but rejected his petition to be paid due pension. The court held that the Government had exercised reasonable discretion in withholding pensions from someone convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude. Kak returned back to Kashmir, but alternated between Srinagar and Kasauli.

== Personal life ==
Ram Chandra Kak married Janaki Devi (b. 1894) in 1901. They had five sons —Shailendra, Narendra, Brijendra, Surendra, and Khemendra— and a daughter, who died in infancy. They had also adopted Kak&#x27;s grand-niece Lila. Devi died in 1928, from tuberculosis.

In 1935, Kak married Margaret Mary. Khemendra, a pilot for the Royal Indian Air Force, died in 1945 of a air-crash near Risalpur; this affected Kak considerably.

==Academics==
Ram Chandra Kak was in possession of the two complete Sharada script copies of the Nilamata Purana, when a critical edition was being prepared by K. de Vreese.

Kak wrote a treatise on Kashmiri archaeology titled &quot;Ancient monuments of Kashmir&quot; in 1933; Francis Younghusband wrote the foreword to the book. The book focused on the destruction of temples by Muslim rulers to such an extent, that he was compelled by the publisher to expunge certain &quot;irrelevant&quot; passages lest communal harmony was affected; a chapter on political history of Kashmir portrayed the centuries of Islamic rule as &quot;one of unmitigated plunder, barbarism, and iconoclasm.&quot; Historian Mridu Rai notes his work to fit into the usual scheme of the State Archaeological Department in privileging Hindus over the Muslims by various direct and indirect means; Ananya Jahanara Kabir reiterates such observations.

<text>Cork City Football Club is an Irish association football club based in Cork. The club was founded and elected to the League of Ireland in 1984.

It was one of the first clubs in Ireland (and the first in Cork) to field a team of professional footballers. With the progression of professionalism at the club, continued development of the Turners Cross stadium and the transition to summer football, the club became one of the biggest and best supported clubs in the country. In a survey published in 2020, the club was the highest supported League of Ireland (LOI) club.

Cork City won its third LOI Premier Division title, and first FAI Cup double, during the 2017 season. As of the 2025 season, the club are playing in the League of Ireland Premier Division, having won the 2024 League of Ireland First Division title.

The club&#x27;s traditional colours are green and white with red trim, and the crest is a variant of the Cork coat of arms. City&#x27;s home games are played at Turners Cross.

==History==

===Pre-1980s===

The current club are not the first to use the name Cork City. During the 1920s, teams referred to as Cork City competed in both the Munster Senior League and the Munster Senior Cup. A team named Cork City finished as Munster Senior Cup runners up in 1924–1925. Another Cork City F.C. also played in the League of Ireland between 1938 and 1940.

===1980s===
Following the bankruptcy of Cork United in 1982, senior football returned to the city with the formation of a new Cork City FC in 1984. Founded by officials from several Cork clubs (including Cork United and Avondale United), the new club was elected to the League of Ireland. Bobby Tambling was the first manager appointed to the club, but he was replaced by Tony &#x27;Tucker&#x27; Allen after only 13 games.

In its first and second seasons, the young club barely averted relegation to the new First Division – failing to win a single game at home in Flower Lodge and avoiding relegation only on goal difference. The club reached the semi-finals of the FAI Cup, but were knocked-out by Shamrock Rovers – in the last match played at the Lodge.

In 1986, the club moved to a new home at Turners Cross, where new manager Noel O&#x27;Mahony brought Cork to a midtable finish. The following year, former Ireland striker Eamon O&#x27;Keefe arrived as manager, delivering the Munster Senior Cup, and the League of Ireland Cup (the club&#x27;s first national silverware).

By 1988, O&#x27;Mahony was re-installed as manager, and the side finished eighth in the league, and a loss to champions Derry City in the FAI Cup final earned the club its first European ticket. While Torpedo Moscow knocked the club out of the 1989–90 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, City earned a fifth-place finish in the Premier Division, and the Munster Senior Cup was reclaimed.

===1990s===
The early 1990s saw lengthy unbeaten league runs, high league positions, retention of the Munster Senior Cup through four years, and a number of games in European competition. The most notable European game was a UEFA Cup tie with Bayern Munich, which saw City hold the Germans 1:1 at Musgrave Park before falling 0:2 to late goals in Bavaria. 1993 saw Cork City land the League of Ireland Premier Division title for the first time, after a complicated three team play-off. O&#x27;Mahoney resigned and the club moved to a new stadium in Bishopstown at the end of the season.

Damien Richardson took the helm and the 1993/94 season began with City coming from three goals down to beat Welsh side Cwmbran Town in the UEFA Champions League. In the following round, they suffered odd-goal defeats both home and away to Turkish side Galatasaray. City finished in runners-up position in the league that year.

1994/95 was a varied season for Cork City. After a strong start to the season, financial pressures forced Richardson to resign and with Bishopstown not being developed to plan, games were switched to Cobh, Turners Cross, and an enforced trip to Tolka Park. Noel O&#x27;Mahony was re-appointed as manager but the title challenge collapsed. The club did have successes in the Munster Senior Cup and League of Ireland Cup that season however.
At the start of the 1995/96 season Rob Hindmarch took the reins, but the club was in trouble. With the stadium dragging it under, the receiver was called in and the club left &#x27;homeless&#x27;. Efforts to save the situation saw a new board installed and a move back to Turners Cross. With limited funds, Hindmarch had skimmed along but relegation still threatened, and an FAI Cup exit saw Dave Barry appointed. The team managed a ninth-place finish in the league, and for the first time in five years City lost the Munster Cup – to Waterford junior side Waterford Crystal.

1996/97 saw City finish in fourth place. The club also narrowly lost out in the League Cup with an unexpected loss to First Division Galway United. Crowds began to increase, and the Munster Senior Cup was recaptured. The following season, Cork performed well in the InterToto Cup and the team improved to third in the league. Dave Barry&#x27;s reign reached its high point in that year, when City won the 1998 FAI Cup. Cork began the following season with eight straight wins but in the end had to settle for second place, as three defeats to champions St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic were costly. After finishing runner-up for the second season in a row in 1999/2000, Barry resigned to be replaced by Colin Murphy.

===2000s===
Colin Murphy stayed for one FAI Super Cup game before departing to Leicester City just days before a UEFA Cup game. His replacement, Derek Mountfield, lasted less than a season and was replaced by former player Liam Murphy. Under Murphy, City embarked on a 13-game unbeaten run that brought an Intertoto ticket and a tenth Munster Cup success.

In 2001, a controversial link-up was proposed between City, English side Leicester City and local outfit Mayfield United. Fans protested however, and the link-up never materialised. Also in 2001, the board of directors stepped down and businessman Brian Lennox assumed control and lead the club to a professional era.

2002 was most notable as a time of transition, as several older players, who had been a mainstay of the team in the 1990s, left the club or joined the coach staff. They were replaced by younger signings – such as George O&#x27;Callaghan, John O&#x27;Flynn and Dan Murray.

In February 2003, ex-St. Pat&#x27;s manager Pat Dolan was unveiled as the new boss and he led City to third place in the new summer season. Dolan&#x27;s second season as manager also proved successful, as City surpassed Malmö FF and NEC Nijmegen in the Intertoto Cup and secured second place in the league.

Dolan was controversially sacked in pre-season 2005 and replaced by former manager Damien Richardson. In 2005, Richardson lead Cork City to their second league championship – winning on the final day of the season with a 2–0 victory over Derry City. In the same year, Cork City finished runners-up the FAI Cup.
2006 saw further upgrade work begin at Turners Cross and City met Apollon Limassol and Red Star Belgrade in the UEFA Champions League. The club lost to Drogheda United in the Setanta Cup Final, finished 4th in the league, and secured a place in the Intertoto and Setanta Cup.

At the start of the 2007 season, two new signings were deemed ineligible for play. This mirrored an inconsistent season start, with elimination from the Setanta Cup, a home win against St. Pat&#x27;s and a record-equaling 4–1 defeat to Sligo Rovers. In August 2007, Roy O&#x27;Donovan left for Sunderland for a record LOI fee of €500,000. 2007 also saw the club&#x27;s ownership change hands: from chairman Brian Lennox to venture capital firm &quot;Arkaga&quot;. Despite an FAI Cup win, manager Damien Richardson&#x27;s future at the club was in doubt, and – after some acrimony – he and the club parted ways.

In January 2008, former Longford Town boss Alan Mathews became manager, and the club signed several players – including taking advantage of FIFA&#x27;s changes to the &quot;3 club&quot; rule by re-signing George O&#x27;Callaghan from Ipswich Town. However O&#x27;Callaghan was later dropped and released. City were knocked out of the first qualifying round in European competition by FC Haka. While David Mooney retained the league&#x27;s top scorer spot, City failed to take points from Bohemians or St. Pats and finished fifth in the league. The club did however gain some silverware, beating Glentoran in the Setanta Sports Cup final. Off the pitch the club suffered a considerable threat when, in August 2008, after investment difficulties with venture capital firm Arkaga, the club entered into examinership. With debts of up to €800,000, cost-cutting measures were implemented. Under related rules, the club was docked 10 points in the league. In October 2008 the High Court ruled in favour of Tom Coughlan&#x27;s bid to take over the club, and ended the examinership.

Paul Doolin replaced Mathews as manager for the 2009 season, and the side gained a number of positive results early in 2009 – including defeating Roy Keane&#x27;s touring Ipswich Town 2–0. Despite these on pitch results however, the club&#x27;s future was left in considerable doubt following a High Court decision on outstanding Revenue receipts. A &quot;winding up&quot; order was issued when no agreement could be reached on tax payments. The club were given several extensions to pay or to appeal, and the club narrowly staved off closure by meeting a final deadline. Doolin left at the end of 2009, after leading the club to a third-place finish in the 2009 League of Ireland Premier Division.

===2010s===
Fallout from the financial and management difficulties in 2008 and 2009 followed the club into the new decade. Roddy Collins was appointed manager before the start of the 2010 season, despite questions over his contract status at Floriana F.C. Mounting pressure on owner Tom Coughlan (including threatened boycotts and censure by the FAI) resulted in his resignation as chairman. Club participation in the Premier Division was also left in doubt as licensing decisions were deferred pending changes in club ownership and payment of outstanding tax receipts.

Despite some temporary stays, and several months of court and legal wrangling, the club ultimately failed to gain a licence, meaning a deal on new ownership could not be secured, and the courts enforced a winding-up order on Cork City Investment FC Limited. Cork City fans entered the 2010 League of Ireland First Division with a new company under the name Cork City FORAS Co-op in the immediate aftermath of the winding up of the holding company CCIFC Ltd. The name of the club was restored on 1 June 2010 when a supporters&#x27; trust, FORAS, completed the purchase of the rights from Cork City Investments FC Ltd&#x27;s liquidator. The team continued to compete in the League of Ireland as Cork City FORAS Co-op for the remainder of the season – though the club and most Irish media returned to calling the club Cork City FC, and supporters used this name during the entire period regardless.

Tommy Dunne (formerly assistant manager to Paul Doolin) was appointed first team manager, and oversaw the 2010 season. A number of players were called-up and played for the Ireland U23s, and others to the Ireland U21s. Shane Duggan, and Graham Cummins were both named in the PFAI First Division Team of the Year, while Cummins won the PFAI First Division Player of the Year award and was joint top-scorer in the First Division with 18 league goals. Cork ultimately finished sixth in the First Division in 2010.

In 2011, the club won the First Division, on the last day of the season, securing promotion to the Premier Division. The team also reached the league cup final, which was won by Derry City. The club were knocked-out of the 2012 FAI Cup by Shamrock Rovers in the third round, and finished sixth in the 2012 Premier Division league competition.

Results at the start of the 2013 season led to the removal of Tommy Dunne as manager by August, with Stuart Ashton overseeing the remainder of the season and a sixth-place finish. Former veteran player and record scorer John Caulfield was appointed manager in 2014, and oversaw unbeaten runs at the start and end of the season – keeping pressure on league-leaders Dundalk. However, despite pushing the title to a final day decider, Caulfield&#x27;s side failed to pick up points from Dundalk and finished second in the 2014 Premier Division competition. The club were also runners-up in the 2015 season, again finishing second to Dundalk. This won them a place in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Europa League, where they made it to the third round, their best European record since 1997. For the third consecutive year, Cork City finished second to Dundalk in the 2016 Premier Division. However, in November they beat Dundalk in the 2016 FAI Cup final after Sean Maguire scored a last minute extra time goal to win Caulfield his first major trophy as manager.

The 2017 season started with a 22-game unbeaten run, however a number of less favourable results mid-season (and the departure of league top-scorer Sean Maguire to the UK and international duty) pushed City&#x27;s &quot;inevitable&quot; championship win until later in the season. Cork City were named 2017 League of Ireland Premier Division champions on 17 October 2017 - with several games in hand. The club completed its first league and cup &#x27;double&#x27;, by winning the 2017 FAI Cup Final a few weeks later on 5 November 2017.

City started 2018 with a third successive President&#x27;s Cup final win over Dundalk - in a game overshadowed by the death of former player Liam Miller, who died earlier in February 2018. As with the preceding four seasons, Dundalk were Cork&#x27;s main rivals in the 2018 League of Ireland Premier Division and 2018 FAI Cup, with Dundalk ultimately winning both.

A series of poor results at the start of the 2019 season, saw the departure of John Caulfield as manager. Neale Fenn was appointed as Caulfield&#x27;s replacement in August 2019, following a period where Frank Kelleher and John Cotter held interim management and coaching positions. Cork City finished the 2019 season in 8th position, with just 9 wins and 37 points.

===2020s===
With five games remaining in the 2020 season, and the club at the bottom of the table with just 2 wins, Neale Fenn was replaced as manager by Colin Healy. The club&#x27;s relegation to the League of Ireland First Division was sealed on 24 October 2020, as their bottom of the table 10th-place finish was confirmed following a Finn Harps win over Bohemians.

In late October 2020, the supporters&#x27; trust agreed to sell the club to Preston North End owner Trevor Hemmings through his company Grovemoor Limited. However, in mid-December 2020, it was reported that the proposed sale would not progress, as Grovemoor Limited could not agree &quot;terms on a lease agreement with the Munster Football Association&quot; for the use of Turner&#x27;s Cross. Hemmings, who had previously &quot;rescue[d] Cork City&quot; by increasing the payments offered for several player sell-on clauses, died in 2021. Relegated to the first division for the 2021 season, the club finished in sixth place, outside the premier division promotion places.

After winning the 2022 LOI First Division title in October 2022, with &quot;two games to spare&quot;, the club secured promotion back to the premier division for the subsequent season. In late 2022, FORAS voted to transfer ownership of the club to businessman Dermot Usher, via a new company (Cathair Chorcaí 2022 FC Limited), subject to the execution of &quot;deeds of surrender&quot; on the call-option agreed with Grovemoor Limited in 2020. Liam Buckley was appointed as sporting director in early May 2023, and Colin Healy resigned as first team manager shortly afterwards. In September 2023, Richie Holland was named manager. In November 2023, after finishing ninth and losing to an extra-time penalty in the 2023 playoff decider, Cork City were again relegated to the LOI First Division for the 2024 season.

Tim Clancy replaced Richie Holland as coach towards the end of 2023, and was first team manager at the start of the 2024 season. A &quot;youthful&quot; and &quot;experiment[al]&quot; Cork City side were knocked out of the 2023-2024 Munster Senior Cup by Wilton United at the last-16 stage. The club started the 2024 League of Ireland First Division season with a 17-game unbeaten run. In August 2024, with the club &quot;closing on an immediate return&quot; to the Premier Division, Cork City re-signed former players Ruairí Keating (released from St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic) and Sean Maguire (released from Carlisle United). With six games to spare and after a 12-game unbeaten run, Cork City secured the First Division title and automatic promotion after a win against UCD in early September 2024.

Cork City started the 2025 Premier Division season with a 2-2 draw against Galway United.

==Ownership==
Until 2022, Cork City FC was owned by its supporters through a supporters&#x27; trust – the Friends of the Rebel Army Society (FORAS). FORAS came into existence during 2008, when financial issues resulted in a period of examinership, and the club&#x27;s then holding company was wound up in 2010. FORAS entered a team into the 2010 League of Ireland First Division, before re-acquiring rights to the name &quot;Cork City Football Club&quot;, and being promoted back to the premier division for the 2012 season. As of February 2022, the club remained within the ownership of the trust, however in December 2022, FORAS members approved the transfer of ownership to businessman Dermot Usher, with 86% support for the proposal.

==Stadium==
Cork City play their home games at Turners Cross – a 7,365 all-seater stadium on the southside of Cork City. The stadium is rented, as part of a long-term agreement, from the Munster Football Association.

== Kit and colours ==
The club&#x27;s colours largely reflected the traditional colours of association football in Cork, with green and white featuring heavily. Since the club&#x27;s inception in 1984, the kits also featured a red trim – influenced in part by the traditional Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) colours of County Cork. Over the years, these base colours were worn in different combinations: originally green and white hoops in 1984, then white shirts with green and red trim in 1989.

In 1997, the club broke with tradition to use a red and white kit – similar to the Cork County GAA kits. Subsequently, the club reverted to the green and white theme in 2002, initially with white sidings rather than stripes, but eventually returning to green white and red stripes.

In 2004, when playing Intertoto cup opponents NEC Nijmegen, the referee deemed that both of Cork City&#x27;s kits clashed with both of NEC&#x27;s kits, and the club was forced to hurriedly source an alternative. The team ultimately wore borrowed all-white kits with a makeshift crest and sponsorship.

There was a recurring theme of black away kits – often with yellow trim – reflecting the kits of former Cork clubs. In 2004, a Cork XI selection featuring a number of City players faced Bolton Wanderers, wearing yellow and black. Black again became the colour of the team&#x27;s away jersey in 2008, with a jersey from Danish maker Hummel.

In 2010, the club kept with tradition by wearing a green home kit with red and white trim manufactured by Hummel. The away kit for 2010 and 2011 was red with white trim, similar to Cork GAA kits. City wore red at home for the first time since the 2001/02 season on 10 September 2010 against Mervue United to show support for the Cork Gaelic footballers who were due to face Down in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final the following weekend.

In November 2011, the club announced Umbro Ireland as the club&#x27;s official kit partner. For the 2015, 2016 and 2017 seasons, the club&#x27;s official kit partner was Nike, with gear provided by Teamwear Ireland. Starting from the 2018 season, the club&#x27;s kit was supplied by Adidas. As of 2024, Adidas remained the kit provider.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Cork City have one of the biggest support bases in the League of Ireland, and for example in early 2017 had average attendances of between four and five thousand per home game, compared to a league average of approximately 1,500. The club had an average attendance of 4,453 during the 2015 season, the highest in Ireland, and approximately 1,000 higher than the next highest averages. A 2020 survey indicated that Cork City had the highest number of supporters among League of Ireland clubs, and was the sixth highest supported football club in Ireland overall (between Chelsea and Barcelona).

&quot;The Shed&quot; is a section of seating in the Curragh Road stand which is home to Cork City&#x27;s more vocal supporters and ultras group &quot;Commandos 84&quot;. Before redevelopment, this was the location of the &#x27;Shed End&#x27; terrace, which was knocked in 2005. The Family Enclosure is a specified area in the &#x27;Donie Forde&#x27; stand, where families and children watch games in a less boisterous atmosphere than that of the Shed End. Commandos 84 were formed in 2004 with the aim of adding organised displays, noise and colour to the Shed with drums, flags, banners and pyrotechnics. 

While there has never been any significant rivalry between the clubs, the only other league side in the Cork area is Cobh Ramblers F.C. Cork City has had some historical rivalry with Dundalk, as the two were Ireland&#x27;s two biggest clubs between 2014 and 2017. As of 2017, games against Limerick F.C. were sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Munster Derby&#x27;. Prior to 2010, this term was also sometimes applied to games against Waterford FC. Rivalry has also existed with some Dublin clubs, such as Shamrock Rovers. Following a game in May 2023, &quot;disgusting&quot; chants (which referred to his young son with leukemia) were directed from outside Cork City&#x27;s ground at Shamrock Rovers&#x27; manager Stephen Bradley. The incident was condemned by local businesses and the club, and Bradley subsequently thanked the &quot;genuine fans of Cork City&quot; for their support. The club issued lifetime bans to those involved.

Former fanzines have included &quot;&quot;FourFiveOne&quot;, &quot;No More Plastic Pitches&quot;, and &quot;I was out there once!&quot;&quot; (IWOTO). and “Going Commando”

<text>Larry Paul Langford (March 18, 1946 – January 8, 2019) was an American politician and convicted felon who had a one-term tenure as the mayor of the city of Birmingham, Alabama. At the time of his death, Langford was hospitalized on compassionate release from serving a 15-year federal prison sentence.

==Biography==
===Education===
Langford was born in Birmingham on March 18, 1946. He graduated from A. H. Parker High School before entering the United States Air Force. He graduated from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science degree in social and behavioral sciences.

===Early career===
Langford was a reporter for WBRC-6, which at the time was the ABC affiliate in Birmingham, during the mid 1970s. He was the community&#x27;s first African-American TV news reporter. He was later a public relations director for a Birmingham Budweiser distributor. Prior to entering politics, Langford was a well known local television personality.

===Political career===
Langford, a Democrat, was elected to the county commission in 2002. His colleagues on the five-member commission elected Langford as commission president, the first African-American to hold the office.

He also served as mayor of Fairfield, Alabama, and served one term on the Birmingham City Council.

Langford raised money and generated public interest and support for Visionland Theme Park (now known as Alabama Splash Adventure), located near Bessemer. The park was built largely by bond issues backed by a consortium of municipalities in the western part of the county, as well as the city of Birmingham and the county government. The park later declared bankruptcy, and was sold to Southland Entertainment Group for just over $5 million at auction.

As Fairfield mayor, Langford spoke publicly many times about his plans to run for higher office, particularly Governor of Alabama. After the bankruptcy of Visionland, Langford&#x27;s political fortunes seemed to wane, and his talk of higher office diminished. After losing the county commission presidency, Langford announced on June 5, 2007, that he would run for mayor of Alabama&#x27;s largest city.

Langford stunned many when he emerged as a top contender in a field of 10 candidates that included incumbent mayor Bernard Kincaid. Preliminary results credited him with 26,277 of 52,111 votes cast in the election, meaning that he avoided a runoff with challenger Patrick Cooper by 170 votes. Cooper then challenged the election in court, saying that Langford was still a resident of Fairfield and did not legally reside within Birmingham&#x27;s city limits. Cooper later withdrew his case after a judge declared Langford&#x27;s downtown loft a legal residence.

While in office Langford was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an anti-gun group with a stated goal of &quot;making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets and that at the time was co-chaired by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Langford was long a proponent of a domed stadium for the city, intended to replace the aging Legion Field as a venue for football on the collegiate and professional levels. He previously promoted a tax hike to pay for the dome, which was soundly rejected by voters a decade earlier under then-Mayor Richard Arrington, although later analysis of votes showed an overwhelming support for the dome inside city limits. After taking office as Birmingham mayor, Langford vowed that a domed stadium would be built in the city no matter what.

== Controversy ==

===Church and state===

Langford, who converted to Catholicism in 1996, was both praised and criticized for the degree to which his Christian faith informed his political agenda. He held Bible studies for municipal workers at City Hall each week and was a frequent speaker at public prayer services and church events.

On April 22, 2008, Langford issued a proclamation on city letterhead proclaiming the following Friday to be &quot;It&#x27;s Time to Pray&quot; in the City of Birmingham. He called upon &quot;all Bishops, Priests, Pastors, Ministers and all of our citizens of various denominations and creeds&quot; to join him in donning burlap sacks and having their heads smeared with ashes during a prayer rally at Boutwell Auditorium. Inspired by a custom described in the Bible of putting on “sackcloth with ashes” as a sign of mourning, the display was intended to show humility and restore God&#x27;s favor to a city Langford described as wracked with violence. Anticipating complaints from defenders of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, Langford stated that &quot;the Constitution of the United States calls for a separation of church and state – it never said anything about a separation of church from state.&quot;

===Pride Week controversy===
Langford injured relations with the Birmingham LGBT community in May 2008 when he refused to sign a proclamation for the annual Central Alabama Pride Parade, an event that had been held on the city&#x27;s south side every year since 1989. He refused to allow banners on city property for the event. Langford further stated that it was inappropriate for the government to condone a lifestyle. He was quoted as saying: &quot;My policy is don&#x27;t ask because it&#x27;s not my business, and don&#x27;t put me in the position to make it my business.&quot;

&quot;I thought I had stated my position very clearly. If I were to sign the permit to put up banners on city right of ways I would be condoning that which I don&#x27;t condone,&quot; he said. &quot;To give a proclamation is totally under the purview of the mayor.&quot;

Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal advocacy group, and Birmingham civil rights attorney David Gespass filed suit on behalf of the Central Alabama Pride group against Larry Langford seeking an order from the courts to prohibit the mayor from discriminating against LGBTQ organizations in administering city services. The organization hoped to use a ruling in their favor to discourage further discriminatory practices in Birmingham and other cities where the legal precedent would apply. A settlement agreement was reached on September 1, 2009. The settlement, reached after a federal judge ruled against the city and mayor in their efforts to have the case dismissed, comes after Lambda Legal and local attorney David Gespass filed the lawsuit in August 2008 in the Northern District of Alabama on behalf of CAP based on Mayor Langford&#x27;s actions in refusing to allow city workers to attach Pride banners on city light posts. Members of CAP were allowed, however, to hang the banners on their own after paying the expense of bucket trucks. CAP members alleged that they had been allowed in previous years to hang Gay Pride banners displayed in accordance with the city&#x27;s practice of attaching banners for a variety of organizations that have held events in the city. However, in May 2008, the mayor announced that he would neither sign a proclamation nor allow city workers to hang the banners based on his religious beliefs that do not &quot;condone that lifestyle choice.&quot; This lawsuit followed initial unsuccessful efforts to negotiate the passage of an even-handed policy. Liberty Counsel represented the city and the mayor.

===Project proposals===
In addition to advocating the construction of a domed football stadium, Langford frequently proposed unique and ambitious projects for Birmingham. To overcome the city&#x27;s mass transit problems, he suggested spending millions on retro-style trolleys. Though Birmingham is more than inland from the Gulf of Mexico, Langford proposed that a canal be constructed from the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway so that cruise ships could dock in the city. He also suggested building a new structure, modeled after The Pentagon, which would house the city jail, police headquarters, fire department headquarters, a police academy, and public works offices. Langford told the Birmingham City Council that he intended to file the paperwork, along with the $500,000 fee, necessary for Birmingham to be a contender to host the 2020 Olympics.

On March 3, 2009, Mayor Langford proposed to the city council that a DVD video be distributed to inner city youth. The video decries &quot;black on black&quot; violence, calling black on black crimes a cultural genocide. The highly controversial DVD, which the local NBC news affiliate referred to as having striking images with racial overtones, depicts images of slavery and the 1960s civil rights movement.

===Unicorns===
On July 21, 2009, Langford gave the entire Birmingham City Council small ceramic unicorns as a response to Birmingham City Council President Carole Smitherman&#x27;s comment that agreeing to the finance director&#x27;s projection of available revenue in 2010 was the equivalent of saying, &quot;We believe in unicorns.&quot;

Following the gift, Langford explained his belief that the unicorn had been a unifying symbol during the reign of King James VI and I who brought together England and Scotland. According to Langford, the gift was meant as a gesture of solidarity.

=== Syphilis coverup ===
In May 2008, the Jefferson County Department of Health began posting advertisements on buses in Birmingham to promote testing and treatment for syphilis. At the time, Jefferson County faced the highest concentration of syphilis cases in the United States, prompting the public outreach campaign. Soon after, Langford controversially ordered the advertisements to be removed, arguing that public recognition of the public health crisis would discourage businesses from investing in the city.

==Public corruption charges==

===SEC investigation and lawsuit===
In 2007, Langford was investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On April 30, 2008, the SEC charged Langford in federal court with corruption. The lawsuit alleged Langford accepted more than $156,000 in cash and benefits from Montgomery investment banker William B. Blount in exchange for county bond business.

On December 1, 2008, Langford, along with Blount and former state Democratic Chairman Al LaPierre, were arrested by the FBI on a 101-count indictment alleging conspiracy, bribery, fraud, money laundering, and filing false tax returns in connection with a long-running bribery scheme. Langford was led into the courtroom in leg-irons. His public corruption trial ended on October 28, 2009, with convictions on 60 counts, and resulted in his automatic removal from office.

===Felony conviction and sentencing===
While Langford was head of the Jefferson County commission, he engaged in a variable-rate auction and bond swaps to raise money to help improve the county&#x27;s sewer system. Langford was convicted of receiving $235,000 in bribes to help influence the bond deals. According to the indictment, William Blount helped Langford receive a $50,000 loan, which was used to purchase jewelry, including a Rolex watch, and designer clothes. Blount&#x27;s firm earned $7.1 million in fees from the bond deals while LaPierre was paid $219,500 by Blount for his help the scheme. Jefferson County banks made approximately $120 million by encouraging the county to refinance nearly all of its bonds using swaps. The bonds resulted in a $3.2 billion sewer debt, contributing to the Jefferson County commissioners voting to declare bankruptcy on November 10, 2011, in what at the time was the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The U.S. government sought $7.6 million in forfeiture from the three men.

After being convicted in a trial in federal court in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Langford was serving out a 15-year federal felony sentence until he was released resentenced to time served in light of life-threatening health issues.

He was inmate #27349-001 at FMC Lexington, a Federal prison hospital near Lexington, Kentucky. He was released on December 28, 2018, after U.S. District Court Judge Scott Coogler commuted his sentence to time served due to deteriorating health conditions.

==Death==
On April 27, 2015, Langford was transported from prison to a hospital due to a case of pneumonia. Langford was first rejected for a compassionate release after describing himself as &quot;terminally ill&quot;.
On December 28, 2018, a federal judge reduced Langford&#x27;s sentence for corruption to time served. He was granted compassionate release from prison in December 2018 due to his failing health.

Langford died on January 8, 2019. He was 72. His interment was at Elmwood Cemetery.

<doc id="1232802" wikidata="Q2044233" url="?curid=1232802" title="Rageh Omaar">
<text>Rageh Omaar (; ; ; born 19 July 1967) is a Somali-born British journalist and writer. He was a BBC world affairs correspondent, where he made his name reporting from Iraq. In September 2006, he moved to a new post at Al Jazeera English, where he presented the nightly weekday documentary series &quot;Witness&quot; until January 2010. &quot;The Rageh Omaar Report&quot;, first aired in February 2010, is a one-hour, monthly investigative documentary in which he reports on international current affairs stories. From January 2013, he became a special correspondent and presenter for ITV News, reporting on a broad range of news stories, as well as producing special in-depth reports from around the UK and further afield. A year after his appointment, Omaar was promoted to international affairs editor for ITV News. Since October 2015, alongside his duties as international affairs editor, he has been a deputy newscaster of ITV News at Ten. Since September 2017, Omaar has occasionally presented the ITV Lunchtime News including the &quot;ITV News London Lunchtime Bulletin&quot; and the ITV Evening News.

==Early life==
Omaar was born in 1967 in Mogadishu, Somali Republic, to Abdullahi and Sahra Omaar. His father was an accountant who became a businessman, a representative of Massey Ferguson tractors, founder of the country&#x27;s first independent newspaper, and was responsible for introducing Coca-Cola to Somalia. A Muslim, his family is originally from Hargeisa.

Omaar moved to the United Kingdom at the age of two. He has several siblings: his elder brother, Mohamed Abdullahi Omaar, was a former Foreign Minister of Somalia.

==Education==
Omaar was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford, and Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire. He then studied Modern History at New College, Oxford.

==Journalism==
===General===
Omaar began his journalistic career as a trainee for &quot;The Voice&quot; newspaper. In 1991, he moved to Ethiopia where he freelanced as a foreign correspondent, working mainly for the BBC World Service. A year later, Omaar returned to London to work as a producer and broadcast journalist for the BBC. He moved to South Africa after having been appointed the BBC&#x27;s Africa correspondent. Omaar&#x27;s wife and children were based there through 2004, and his regular commuting made domestic life a challenge.

His career highlights include reporting live on the conflicts in Somalia and Iraq.

===BBC===
Omaar covered the Iraq invasion for the weekday BBC news bulletins and BBC News. Many of his broadcasts were syndicated across the United States, where he became known as the &quot;Scud Stud&quot;.

Omaar has written a book about his time as the BBC&#x27;s Iraq correspondent called &quot;Revolution Day&quot;. The book deals with the effects of the Saddam Hussein regime, UN sanctions, and of the war on Iraqi civilians.

Explaining why he eventually left the BBC, Omaar suggested that he wanted to operate independently and to take on assignments for people he wished to collaborate with. He also suggested that the BBC working environment was somewhat exclusivist on a class basis, and that he was guilty of this as well to some degree as a consequence of his public school upbringing.

Additionally, Omaar has expressed regret about the way in which he covered the invasion of Iraq during his time as a BBC correspondent. He suggested that he and his colleagues did pieces on Saddam Hussein, his regime and weapons inspectors, giving little coverage to the Iraqi people. Interviewed in John Pilger&#x27;s documentary &quot;The War You Don&#x27;t See&quot; (2010), Omaar also lamented that &quot;one didn&#x27;t press the most uncomfortable buttons hard enough&quot; and called the coverage &quot;a giant echo chamber&quot;.

===Al Jazeera===
In September 2006, Omaar joined Al Jazeera English. He served as a Middle Eastern correspondent for its London division.

During his time with the news organisation, Omaar presented the nightly weekday documentary series &quot;Witness&quot;. He also hosted the monthly &quot;The Rageh Omaar Report&quot;, his own investigative documentaries.

===ITV News===
In January 2013, it was announced that Omaar would be joining ITV News as a special correspondent. He was promoted the following year to ITV News&#x27; International Affairs Editor.

Since October 2015, alongside his duties as international affairs editor, Omaar has been a deputy newscaster of ITV News at Ten.

Since September 2017, Omaar has occasionally presented the ITV Lunchtime News, including the ITV News London Lunchtime Bulletin, and the ITV Evening News.

==Awards and nominations==
In 2003, Omaar was the recipient of an Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy award for the best TV journalist.

In 2008, he was also presented the Arab Media Watch Award for excellence in journalism.

In January 2014 and 2015, Omaar was nominated for the Services to Media award at the British Muslim Awards.

==Personal life==
In 2000, Omaar married Alexander technique instructor Georgiana Rose &quot;Nina&quot; Montgomery-Cuninghame, the daughter of Sir John Montgomery-Cuninghame of Corsehill. The couple live in Chiswick, West London, and have two sons and a daughter.

Omaar maintains close contact with his family in Somalia, is an activist for the Somali community, and regularly attends its lectures and events.

Omaar became noticeably unwell during a live broadcast of the &quot;ITV News at Ten&quot; on 26 April 2024. ITV subsequently confirmed that he was &#x27;receiving medical care&#x27;. Since that incident, Omaar&#x27;s public career had been paused. He returned to News at Ten on Monday 27th January 2025.

<doc id="1232805" wikidata="Q524075" url="?curid=1232805" title="Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada">
<text>The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada (PAOC) () is a Finished Work Pentecostal denomination of Christianity and the largest evangelical church in Canada. Its headquarters is located in Mississauga, Ontario. The PAOC is theologically evangelical and Pentecostal, emphasizing the baptism with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues. It historically has had strong connections with the Assemblies of God in the United States. It is affiliated with the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada and the World Assemblies of God Fellowship.

==History==

===Early history (1906-1925)===
The association has its origins in the adoption of Pentecostal beliefs by various churches in the Ottawa Valley (Ontario), notably through the preaching of Canadian Methodist pastor Robert McAllister who visited the Azusa Street Revival of 1906. A majority of Pentecostals were found in the prairie provinces due in part to the large numbers of United States immigrants who brought their faith with them. Because of these influences, Canadian Pentecostals maintained close ties to their American counterparts. A 1909 attempt to organize the Pentecostal Movement in the East failed because of opposition against institutionalization. In 1918, however, a decision was made to form the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada. The association was officially founded in 1919 by 33 churches. At the time, the PAOC adhered to the non-Trinitarian Oneness doctrine and there were plans to join the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World (PAW), another Oneness Pentecostal denomination based in the U.S. However, those plans never materialized, and the Canadian body remained an independent organization with no formal US ties. Around the same time that eastern Pentecostals were creating the PAOC, Pentecostals in Saskatchewan and Alberta were joining the US based Assemblies of God instead. In 1920, the PAOC chose to affiliate with the Assemblies of God. Pentecostals in the West were incorporated into the PAOC, which continued to function as a distinct sub-division of the Assemblies of God. As a result, the PAOC united most Canadian Pentecostals in one denomination. The Assemblies of God, however, was a Trinitarian fellowship, and the PAOC was required to repudiate the Oneness doctrine and embrace the doctrine of the Trinity. This action resulted in the first major split within Canadian Pentecostalism and the creation of the Apostolic Church of Pentecost in 1921 by former PAOC members. However, a large portion of the Apostolic Church of Pentecost in the east later joined the United Pentecostal Church International.

 For the next five years, the PAOC experienced growth. It began a national paper, &quot;The Pentecostal Testimony&quot;, in 1920 and established a centralized overseas missionary policy for improved effectiveness. In 1925, the PAOC asked to be released from the Assemblies of God over differences in missionary vision. This was granted and was an amiable parting, and the two groups have continued to maintain close ties.

===Growth (1926-1974)===
As the movement expanded, the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada began to include members from across Canadian society, and larger congregations resulted. For example, in 1928 Calvary Temple in Winnipeg, Manitoba, bought the First Baptist Church which seated 1,500 people, a very large church by Canadian standards even today. In 1925, the PAOC opened Bethel Bible Institute (Now known as Horizon College &amp; Seminary, which later moved to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan ) in Winnipeg, Manitoba, which was the first of several Pentecostal institutions dedicated to theological education. As time went on, the PAOC established a stronger financial base allowing for the construction of new buildings. Notably, Central Tabernacle in Edmonton, Alberta, (has been demolished, and moved to their new location, now North Pointe, in the north end of the city) was built in 1972 which accommodations for 1,800 and Winnipeg&#x27;s Calvary Temple completed a new 2,500 seat church building in 1974.

===Recent history (1979-present)===
Facing the same challenge of many Canadian churches in the latter years of the 20th century, the PAOC worked hard to continue its growth. Under the leadership of General Superintendent James MacKnight (1983-1996), 102 additional churches were added to the PAOC. A greater emphasis on international missions work since that time has led to growth overseas. According to Statistics Canada, Pentecostal growth has varied (statistics Canada does not collect data specific to the PAOC, but as by far the largest Pentecostal group in Canada, it is likely to reflect the statistics regarding Canadian Pentecostals). The 1991 census showed a 29% increase. Between 1991 and 2001, the census reported a 15% decline to 369,480 adherents (Extrapolating the percentage growth indicates approximately 435,000 +/-2,500 adherents in 1991). While self-reported statistics from the PAOC show plateaued growth, the 2011 census indicates 478,705 adherents - a 29% increase over 2001, and 10% increase over 1991 census data. The Evangelical Fellowship of Canada has pointed out that changes to choices available on census forms over the years brings into question the accuracy and usefulness of Statistics Canada data on evangelical denominations, so it is likely PAOC data is a more accurate measure. The PAOC had &quot;fewer than 225,000 members and adherents as of 1994&quot;. According to a census of the association of churches in 2022, it would have 1,047 churches and 271,893 members. 

==Beliefs==

The central beliefs of the Pentecostal Assemblies are summarized in its Statement of Fundamental and Essential Truths. The statement is consistent with general evangelical and Pentecostal beliefs. The Pentecostal Assemblies, as stated in the Fundamental and Essential Truths, believe the Bible is the &quot;all-sufficient source of faith and practice&quot; and the &quot;complete revelation and very Word of God inspired by the Holy Spirit&quot;. It subscribes to the doctrine of the Trinity, believing that God exists as three persons: the Father, the Son who is Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. The Pentecostal Assemblies believes that salvation has been provided for all humanity through the atonement of Christ upon the cross, and this was proven by his resurrection from the dead. Those who have faith in Christ and repent are born again of the Holy Spirit and receive eternal life. The person who repents and has faith in Christ is justified, not because of the believer&#x27;s own merit but solely because the believer has accepted Christ as savior. The Pentecostal Assemblies teach that the sanctification of a believer is both instantaneous and progressive. The believer is sanctified as the Holy Spirit teaches the believer through the Word of God and produces within the believer the character of Christ. Consistent with Pentecostal theology, the denomination teaches that Christians should seek the baptism with the Holy Spirit, which is an experience distinct from and subsequent to the new birth. With this experience comes a more intimate knowledge of Christ and an empowerment to witness and to grow spiritually. The initial evidence of receiving the baptism with the Holy Spirit is speaking in other tongues. Through spiritual gifts believers can minister effectively by both building up the church and demonstrating the presence of God within the church. The Pentecostal Assemblies believes that divine healing is provided within Christ&#x27;s atonement, and prayer for the sick and gifts of healing are encouraged. The denomination teaches that the universal church is the Body of Christ and includes as members all who have been born again. Local churches observe two ordinances: the Lord&#x27;s Supper and water baptism by immersion. The PAOC believes in a dispensationalist and premillennialist eschatology which includes the pre-Tribulation rapture of the church and the Second Coming of Christ. The Pentecostal Assemblies believe that marriage is a lifelong union between one man and one woman. The marriage vow can only be broken by &quot;marital unfaithfulness involving adultery, homosexuality, or incest&quot;. Even in those circumstances, however, the PAOC believes reconciliation is the desired option, and it discourages divorce for all other reasons. It views remarriage as acceptable in the event of a former spouse&#x27;s death, in cases where the former spouse committed marital unfaithfulness, or if the former spouse has remarried. PAOC members are encouraged to tithe.

==Structure==

===Local churches===
The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada is organized as a &quot;cooperative fellowship&quot;. At the local level, Pentecostal Assemblies adhere to congregational polity. Congregations appoint pastors, elect governing boards, and manage their own local affairs.

===Districts and branches===
Local churches are organized into geographical middle judicatories called districts. A district is governed by a biennial conference, a representative body composed of credential holders with voting privileges and local church delegates. Districts examine and recommend credentials for ministers and elect their own officers. District executives have oversight over all activities of the PAOC within district borders. A branch is a non-geographical administrative unit equivalent to a district; however, a branch&#x27;s activities are confined to certain ethnic or language groups.

== District Offices ==

* British Columbia &amp; Yukon District
* Alberta &amp; Northwest Territories District
* Saskatchewan District
* Manitoba &amp; Northwestern Ontario District
* Western Ontario District
* Eastern Ontario &amp; Nunavut District
* Quebec District
* Maritime District

===General Conference===
The governing body of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada is the General Conference which meets regularly every two years. It includes all ordained ministers, other credential holders, credentialed missionaries, and some ex officio members serving in official capacities. Each local church is entitled to appoint one lay delegate to the General Conference, and churches with more than 200 members are entitled to send one additional lay delegate per every 100 members. The General Executive consists of the Executive Officers, district superintendents, the regional directors of international missions program, five additional credential holders elected by the General Conference, and three lay persons elected by the General Conference. The executive officers include the general superintendent, the assistant general superintendent for fellowship services, and the assistant general superintendent for international missions, all of which are elected by the General Conference.

<text>The Murder Junkies are an American punk rock band, best known for having been GG Allin&#x27;s final backing band before his death. They perform songs from Allin&#x27;s back catalog as well as their own original material. They are the third GG Allin backing band to bear the name.

== Earlier bands bearing the name ==
The original Murder Junkies was a Texas band formed independently of Allin which performed as his backing band for several live dates in the late 1980s.

The second Murder Junkies was a studio band including Allin&#x27;s friend Mark Sheehan on guitar which recorded the &quot;Watch Me Kill&quot; six-track EP, released on Fuckin&#x27; A/Stomach Ache Records in 1991.

== Formation and career with Allin (1990–1993) ==
The third Murder Junkies lineup was formed in 1990 as Allin&#x27;s new backing band and rehearsed while he concluded his prison sentence. The original line-up consisted of guitarist &quot;Chicken&quot; John Rinaldi (later a 2007 San Francisco mayoral candidate), GG&#x27;s elder brother Merle Allin on bass, and drummer Donald &quot;Dino Sex&quot; Sachs.

Rinaldi left the band later in 1991, and voiced negative opinions about the experience in Todd Phillips&#x27;s documentary &quot;&quot;. He was replaced by William Weber. Dee Dee Ramone was also recruited to play guitar at the same time as Weber, but quit shortly thereafter, without playing any live dates with the band.

GG Allin and the Murder Junkies recorded their sole studio album, &quot;Brutality and Bloodshed for All&quot;, for Alive Records in April 1993. Their subsequent tour, shortly followed by Allin&#x27;s death from a drug overdose on June 28, was chronicled by roadie Evan Cohen in the book &quot;I Was A Murder Junkie: The Last Days Of GG Allin&quot;.

== Activity after Allin&#x27;s death; breakup (1993–1999) ==
Dino, Merle, and Weber decided to continue the band, and recruited new singer Mike Denied, former bassist with New York City band The Denied. They released a mini-album &quot;Feed My Sleaze&quot; in 1995. &quot;The Right To Remain Violent&quot;, a 7&quot; single, appeared the following year.

The Murder Junkies toured throughout the 1990s and went through several more vocalists, including Mike Hudson, formerly of the Pagans (he only lasted for two shows in 1994), Jeff Clayton of Antiseen, and J. B. Beverley, a musician from the Washington, D.C. area. They broke up in 1999.

== Reformation, subsequent activity (2003–present) ==
The band reformed with Clayton singing for a tour in June 2003, the 10th anniversary of GG Allin&#x27;s death. They performed alongside a version of Allin&#x27;s first band, The Jabbers, for several shows.

In 2005, the band completed a tour of continental Europe. In 2006, they appeared at two shows supporting CKY, and toured as the opening act for Hank Williams III.

The band released the album &quot;Road Killers&quot; in 2011, followed by &quot;A Killing Tradition&quot; in 2013 and &quot;Killing For Christ Sakes&quot; the following year. The lineup currently features Merle Allin, Dino Sex, guitarist Duane Rollick, and vocalist Brandon Fergus.

<doc id="1232815" wikidata="Q4969778" url="?curid=1232815" title="2005 British Columbia electoral reform referendum">
<text>A referendum was held in the Canadian province of British Columbia on May 17, 2005, to determine whether or not to adopt the recommendation of the Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform to replace the existing first-past-the-post electoral system (FPTP) with a single transferable vote system (BC-STV). It was held in conjunction with the BC Legislative Assembly election of 2005. Voters were given two ballots at that time: a ballot to vote for a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia (MLA) in their constituency and a referendum ballot. The referendum received considerable support from the electorate but failed in meeting the 60-percent threshold that had been set. A second referendum was held in 2009.

==Background==

The first half of the 2000s was marked by a growing movement in favour of electoral reform in Canada. Liberals in British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario campaigned successfully in each of these provinces with commitments to electoral reform. A reform initiative was launched as well in PEI, as well, in response to a series of lopsided elections in that province. In 2004, the Law Commission of Canada published an influential report on electoral reform, with a strong recommendation in favour of a mixed member proportional (MMP) system.

In British Columbia, impetus was created by the anomalous provincial election result in 1996, in which the NDP won reelection as a majority government with 39.5 percent of the vote and 39 seats, despite gaining 3 percent fewer votes than the Liberals at 41.8 percent of the total and 33 seats. The balance of the vote was picked up by the Reform Party, which won 9.3 percent of the vote (two seats) and the Progressive Democrats with 5.7 percent of the vote (one seat), representing a perfect example of vote-splitting by conservative and liberal parties leading the NDP to majority status. There followed another lopsided election in 2001, in which the Liberals won 77 out of 79 seats, virtually wiping out the opposition, with 57 percent of the vote.

According to Pilon, &quot;British Columbia has had a long dalliance with voting reform initiatives&quot; municipally and provincially since the 1930s, coinciding with the emergence of left-wing forces capable of splitting the vote and going &quot;up the middle&quot; to take power, such as the way that the NDP won the 1996 election. In his view, this is what led the Liberals to take up voting system reform at the provincial level in the late 1990s.

The Liberal government of Premier Gordon Campbell had campaigned in favour of electoral reform in 2001, and was under pressure to deliver. Following the Liberal victory in the 2001, the Liberals faced the political dilemma of having campaigned on an issue that no longer interested them in the same way. Meanwhile, the Green party attempted to use the provincial initiative referendum process to force the issue, and although they were unsuccessful, this kept the issue alive. In 2003, the Liberal government, with the agreement of the opposition New Democratic Party, established a Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform, mandating it to propose a new electoral system that would subsequently be put to a referendum.

==Timeline of Citizen&#x27;s Assembly process==
The following indicates some of the key events leading up to the referendum:
* September 20, 2002 — The government appoints former British Columbia Liberal Party leader Gordon Gibson to recommend the structure of the Citizens&#x27; Assembly.
* April 28, 2003 — The Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform is created by motion of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia.
* January 2004 — The Citizen&#x27;s Assembly is convened. It consists of 161 members, one woman and one man randomly selected from each of the 79 existing electoral districts, two first Nations members and a chair. 
* January to October 2004 — Assembly proceedings include a learning phase, public hearings and a deliberative phase.
* October 23 and 23. Assembly members vote on different options in three separate votes. A first vote asked members to express their preference for MMP or STV. This vote yielded a strong, but not unanimous preference for STV: 123 votes for STV vs. 31 for MMP. Members then voted between retaining FPTP or moving to STV. There was a strong preference for STV: 142 votes for STV vs. 11 for retaining FPTP. Finally, the Assembly voted in favour of submitting a recommendation in favour of STV to the public in a referendum on May 17, 2005: 146 in favour vs. 7 against. 
* December 10, 2004 — The final report of the Assembly, recommending BC-STV, is presented to the government.
* February 2005 — A separate Final Report on the work of the Assembly is submitted to the legislature by the Special Committee on the Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform in February 2005.
* May 17, 2005 — The referendum is held in conjunction with the 2005 BC election.

==Proposed changes to the electoral system==

The current electoral system in BC is first-past-the-post (FPTP). In this system, a voter gives one vote to one candidate in one electoral district. Each political party runs no more than one candidate in each electoral district. The candidate with the most votes in the electoral district wins, whether they received a majority of votes or not, and is charged with representing all voters in the electoral district.

The proposed electoral system is a customized version of single transferable vote (STV) called BC-STV. In this system, each electoral district would have between 2 and 7 seats depending on its population and geographic size, and electors would vote for district representatives. Although each elector would have only one vote, as the expression STV indicates, the ballot would allow electors to rank their preferences. The STV model proposed by the Assembly avoided the use of party lists, which they felt would be unpopular with British Columbians. Instead, voters would choose among candidates by name and when ranking candidates, could choose candidates from different parties, thus retaining the maximum amount of freedom in choosing whom to elect.

Having multiple seats in one district would allow those seats to be allocated in a way that reflects the distribution of votes among the district&#x27;s candidates in a roughly proportional way. Political parties may nominate as many candidates in an electoral district as there are available seats, or they might prefer to concentrate their efforts on a smaller number of candidates. Major parties will typically nominate more candidates than minor parties, as they will be hopeful of electing a larger number of MLAs. Candidates would be grouped by political party in separate columns on the ballot paper.

To establish the winners, a quota for the district would be determined based on the number of valid ballots cast and the number of seats available in the district. All the votes would be counted and sorted by the voters&#x27; first preferences. Those candidates with enough first-preference votes to meet or exceed the quota are elected. A multiple-step vote counting and transfer process is then used to determine the winners of the remaining seats in the district, based on voters&#x27; alternate preferences. Although the mechanics of the vote-transfer process can be complicated, the general principle is that all votes should count, so that if a voter&#x27;s first-preference candidate is not elected, or has more votes than needed to be elected, the votes in question will be transferred to another candidate based on alternate preferences.

==Question and thresholds==
The question asked was: &quot;Should British Columbia change to the BC-STV electoral system as recommended by the Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform?&quot;

Although according to Pilon, there was no compelling legal or historical precedent for doing so, the Electoral Reform Referendum Act established two super-majority thresholds for the referendum results to be binding on government: 
* at least 60 percent of the valid votes cast in support of the proposal and
* a simple majority in favour in at least 60 percent of all electoral districts (48 out of 79).

==The campaign==

Although the Citizen&#x27;s Assembly had come to a remarkable degree of consensus in favour of BC-STV after months of study and deliberation, there is an important distinction to be made between such a consultative process and a general referendum in which there is much less opportunity for learning and deliberation by ordinary voters and where political interests are more likely to come into play. As LeDuc et al. point out, &quot;Deliberative democracy and direct democracy are different processes, and the dynamic of a referendum campaign will typically be quite different than that of a deliberative body.&quot;

The referendum campaign started with the Citizen&#x27;s Assembly&#x27;s announcement of its conclusions in late October 2004. This was followed by an initial flush of media coverage, including a favorable op. ed. by the influential Gordon Gibson in the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;. However, other &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; coverage was much less favourable, and indeed dismissive. Provincial media seemed more sympathetic, drawing attention to the work of the Citizen&#x27;s Assembly. Some high-profile media and columnists eventually endorsed the STV proposal, based on the case put forward by the Citizen&#x27;s Assembly but many others remained opposed.

Public efforts to educate the public about the referendum were under the responsibility of Elections BC and the BC government. In order to protect the neutrality of its role, Elections BC did not provide information on the Citizens&#x27; Assembly proposal in comparison to the FPTP system. Its role was to ensure that voters had information on voter registration opportunities and information on the administration of the referendum. This left responsibility for promoting awareness and understanding of the two electoral systems to the government. In March 2005, the government established a Referendum Information Office with a mandate to provide voters with information to make an informed choice on the referendum question. The Referendum Information Office created a website and fact sheets, mailed a brochure to every residential household in the province, and established a toll-free information line (Elections BC Report 2005: 36).

Poll results about the extent of voter knowledge about the referendum suggest that these efforts were ineffective (see the section on Voter polls and surveys, below). An unfortunate hiccup flagged by Dennis Pilon 2010: 78) is that the brochures distributed to each household by the Referendum Information Office resembled newspaper advertising inserts and were likely discarded unopened by most voters.

However, the onus of informing the public did not rest exclusively on public organizations. As noted, the media also played a role, and aside from expressing their own views or those of their columnists, they also provided a space for advocates on both sides to express their views (Pilon 2010: 79).

Legislation regulating the referendum process did not establish a formal role for &quot;Yes/No&quot; groups but required advertising sponsors to register, include identification statements on all advertising and submit financial reports following the referendum. No spending limits were imposed on referendum advertising sponsors&quot; (Elections BC 2005: 36). Two groups did form in an attempt to fill the information gap and influence the outcome. In support of the STV proposal was a group called YES-STV led organizationally by a local advocacy group called Fair Voting BC. It included members of the former Citizen&#x27;s Assembly, activists from Fair Vote Canada and a number of academics and celebrity supporters. The No side, calling itself KNOW-STV included a few former politicians, backroom operatives from the Liberal and NDP parties, and two former members of the Citizen&#x27;s Assembly (Pilon 2010: 78).

Remarkably, as Pilon elaborates (Pilon 2010: 78-79), none of the major parties came out formally in support of the proposed reforms. Even Green Party leader Adrienne Carr expressed a preference for a different version of proportional representation than STV, although many Green candidates ignored their leader and openly supported the Citizen&#x27;s Assembly proposal. The NDP and its leader Carole James were also critical of the proposed STV model while refusing to make it a campaign issue. Even though the BC NDP had committed to adopt proportional representation in 1999, they claimed to prefer a different model and the party was deeply split on the issue in general. As for the Liberals, Premier Campbell remained neutral but as a party, the Liberals were largely opposed to electoral reform. Indeed, the government imposition of a supermajority requirement for the referendum to be binding was widely seen as a concession to members of the Liberal caucus opposed to reform. Voters seeking guidance from the parties on how to vote in the referendum were thus left without very much direction.

==Voter polls and surveys==

Voter polls and surveys conducted prior to the referendum dealt with the degree of voter awareness and knowledge about the referendum as well as voter intentions.

On the former subject, various surveys pointed to low levels of awareness that did not seem to improve significantly as the referendum approached. Pilon 2010: 77) cites the following results: 
* a February 21, 2005, poll by Ipso-Reid (conducted in early February) showing that 50 percent of respondents were aware of the referendum but two-thirds of them claimed to know &quot;very little&quot; or &quot;nothing&quot; about BC-STV;
* a Strategic Council poll in April 2005 finding that nearly half of respondents knew &quot;nothing at all&quot; about the proposal, while another 42 percent claimed to know &quot;a little.&quot; Only 10 percent felt they knew &quot;a lot&quot; about it;
* Angus Reid polling in the final weeks of the campaign (published April 30 and May 14), showing 64 percent to 66 percent of respondents still claiming they knew &quot;nothing&quot; or &quot;very little&quot; about the proposal.
As Pilon concludes, &quot;the public seemed only vaguely aware of the referendum and poorly informed of what was at stake in making their decision&quot; (ibid.).

Meanwhile, surveys on voter intentions such as the following showed rising support for the referendum over time, and some decline in the share of undecided voters. 
*Nordic Research Group April 28, 2005
**Yes: 32 percent; no: 16 percent; undecided: 52 percent
*Ipsos-Reid April 30, 2005
**Yes: 42 percent; no: 38 percent
*Ipsos-Reid May 14, 2005
**Yes 47 percent; no: 35 percent; undecided: 13 percent; will not vote: 3 percent

By the time of the above Ipso-Reid survey results announced on the eve of the referendum, the referendum seemed destined to secure majority support and might even pass the 60 percent threshold. Much would depend on how voters would swing at the last moment on an important issue about which most of them felt ill-informed.

==Results==
The final result of the referendum was favourable to the proposed reform, which was supported by 57.7 percent of the electorate, vs. 42.3 percent voting against it. A majority of pro-reform votes was obtained in 77 out of 79 districts. The following table provides the details.

Although the proposal failed to meet the thresholds established for the reform to be binding, the result was very close. The threshold requiring majority support in at least 60 percent of districts was easily met, with 97 percent of districts satisfying this criterion, and the overall popular vote was just 2.3 percent shy of the threshold.

==Analysis==
The unexpectedly high popularity of the voting reform surprised many. Although polls conducted in April and May indicated more support for the proposal than against it, the number of undecided voters remained high, and there was an expectation that &quot;a bewildered public would simply vote it down on election day&quot; as can typically happen (Pilon 2010: 80). Yet despite this, the measure gained a 57.7 percent approval in the province on voting day.

That the public was poorly informed right up to the date of the referendum is certain. Post-referendum research and analysis pointed to the ineffectiveness of public education efforts, of the YES-STV and KNOW-STV campaigns, and of the media to act as &quot;effective grassroots indicators&quot; (Pilon 2010: 81). Meanwhile, the referendum campaign received limited media attention, as both major parties were officially neutral on the proposed change. Just days before the referendum, two thirds of British Columbians admitted to knowing &quot;nothing/very little&quot; about the proposed STV system (Pilon 2010: 77 and 79).

However they were strongly inclined towards proportionality, choice among multiple parties, and even coalition governments. Post-election analysis confirmed that most people knew little about the details of STV. Better informed voters did tend to vote in support of the proposal, but other supporters of the proposal seemed to rely on a positive appreciation and respect for the work of the Citizen&#x27;s Assembly. Positive appreciation of the Citizen&#x27;s Assembly thus appears to have been an important factor in the level of approval that was achieved, and the Assembly members played a role in this, by calling attention to the role of the Assembly in drafting the referendum question.

According to a post-referendum survey conducted by Nordic Research, over half of those who voted against STV said that they did so because they did not feel knowledgeable.

A remarkable feature of the BC 2005 referendum was the extent of voter support across party lines. In particular, the research showed Liberals, Greens and undecided voters quite supporting of STV, with well over 60 percent support among these groups, but support among Liberals was fairly high as well, at about 50 percent (Carty et al., op. cit.). As Pilon points out, the aftermath of the 1996 and 2001 elections had left many partisans of both the NDP and Liberal parties unsure about their parties future and open to proposals for reform and the moment was ripe for the referendum to secure support across party lines, despite the lack of support or even opposition from party leaders (Pilon 2010: 80)

==Aftermath==
There was some ambivalence on how to proceed following the referendum, considering the strong support that it had shown, while falling short of the threshold for it to be binding. The Liberal government, which had been reelected the day of the referendum, put off any comment on how it would respond until the fall of 2005. The public itself was quite divided; and some in the electoral reform community expressed concern that the Legislature might impose a &quot;watered-down&quot; or partisan-inspired system in lieu of the STV model.

The Liberals&#x27; response came in Premier Gordon Campbell&#x27;s September 12 Speech from the Throne. The speech rejected the call for introducing STV immediately and rejected a re-opening of the process to consider other options. Instead, it announced a second referendum on the STV proposal, with some adjustments: this time, a provisional map of STV ridings would be prepared in advance, and public funds would be provided to both pro- and anti-STV groups &quot;to support active information campaigns for supporters and detractors of each model.&quot; BC-STV would remain intact as the proposed alternative to FPTP and the 60 percent threshold would also remain in place.

The original intent in the Speech from the Throne was that the referendum would be rerun in conjunction with the B.C. municipal elections in November 2008 in time to be implemented in the next provincial election should it be approved. However, the Premier later issued a statement, on April 27, 2006, indicating that the date of the referendum would be postponed until May 2009 to coincide with the next provincial election. He explained that this was being done after consulting with Elections BC to reduce the cost of running the referendum while ensuring that there would be enough time to prepare for the next election should the referendum call for an STV model to be implemented.

<doc id="1232819" wikidata="Q2748388" url="?curid=1232819" title="Province of Tierra Firme">
<text>During Spain&#x27;s New World Empire, its mainland coastal possessions surrounding the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico were referred to collectively as the Spanish Main. The southern portion of these coastal possessionsthe northern portion of South America, the Pacific Coast of Colombia and Mexico, and Central Americawere known as the Province of Tierra Firme (), or the &quot;Mainland Province&quot; (as contrasted with Spain&#x27;s nearby insular colonies). The Province of Tierra Firme, or simply Tierra Firme, was also called Costa Firme.

==History==
In 1498, Cristopher Columbus entered the Gulf of Paria in Venezuela and explored the Orinoco River. In his fourth and last voyage, he also explored the Honduras. In 1509, authority was granted to Alonso de Ojeda and Diego de Nicuesa to colonize the territories between the west side of the Gulf of Urabá and Cabo de la Vela, and Urabá westward to Cabo Gracias a Dios in present-day Honduras. The westernmost portion was given the name &quot;Tierra Firme&quot; comprising many formerly Indigenous territories, including the former Kingdom of Parita. Other provinces of this region during this era were Nueva Andalucia and Veragua or Castilla del Oro; the main city in Tierra Firme was Santa Maria La Antigua del Darién, now Darién, Panama, near the mouth of the Tarena river.
The idea was to create a unitary administrative organization similar to Nueva España (now Mexico), near the Captaincy General of Guatemala.

Tierra Firme later received control over other territories: the Isla de Santiago (now Jamaica) the Cayman Islands; Roncador, Quitasueño, and Providencia and other islands now under Colombian control; and the territories of present-day Costa Rica and Nicaragua as far as Cabo Gracias a Dios. The eastern frontier of Tierra Firme also included the east side of the Gulf of Darién or Urabá, the east side of the Atrato and Truando rivers, ending in Cabo Marzo on the Pacific side. Between these limits lie Santa Maria La Antigua Del Darien on the Gulf of Urabá and Jurado on the Pacific side.

When the Central American states gained independence, the precise frontiers were unclear. For example, some ancient maps and historical references suggest that the entire Caribbean coast as far as Cabo Gracias a Dios was part Tierra Firme or Castilla Del Oro. On the other hand, this would embrace populated regions of the Mosquito Coast that were never under the effective rule of Tierra Firme. Disputes over both of Panama&#x27;s frontiers were finally solved by agreements with Costa Rica and Colombia, respectively.

==Governorates in Hispanic America==
After the territorial division of South America between Spain and Portugal, the Peruvian Hispanic administration was divided into six entities: 

* Province of Tierra Firme, included the Caribbean Coast, Central America, the Pacific Coast of Colombia and Mexico.
* Governorate of New Castile, consisting of the territories from roughly the Ecuadorian-Colombian border in the north to Cuzco in the south.
* Governorate of New Toledo, forming the previous southern half of the Inca empire, stretching towards central Chile.
* Governorate of New Andalusia, which was not formally conquered by Spain until decades later.
* Governorate of New León, the southernmost part of the continent until the Strait of Magellan.
* Governorate of Terra Australis, territories from the south of the Strait of Magellan to the South Pole.

This territorial division set the basis for the Hispanic administration of South America for several decades. It was formally dissolved in 1544, when King Charles I sent his personal envoy, Blasco Núñez Vela, to govern the newly founded Viceroyalty of Peru that replaced the governorates.

<text>Binatone is a British-Chinese telecommunications company.

Binatone was started in the United Kingdom in 1958 by two brothers, Gulu Lalvani and Partap Lalvani, to import and distribute consumer electronics. The company was named after their sister, Bina.

== History ==

Between 1976 and 1979, Binatone produced the &quot;Binatone TV Master&quot; series of first generation video game consoles.

In 1983 Binatone was the first in Europe with fixed-line consumer products that could be bought at electronics retailers. This marked the beginning of a gradual change from Binatone&#x27;s focus on audio and vision to telecom products.

In 2008, Dino Lalvani, son of Gulu Lalvani, purchased the company from his father and took over as chairman.

Binatone was the official shirt sponsor of Queens Park Rangers Football Club from 2003 to 2006.

Binatone manufactures products under its own brand apart from utilising the AEG and Motorola brands under licence.

In 2013, Binatone released ReadMe Mobile, an Android tablet/eReader. The device specializes as an eBook with a keypad, and a non-reflective screen. 

Binatone created an N95 mask and combined it with a Bluetooth headset in January of 2021. The company unveiled &quot;MaskFone&quot; at the CES 2021.

== Consoles ==

A very early console was the &quot;TV Game unit&quot; but the first series was the &quot;TV master&quot; series which are black &amp; white pongs (first generation).

* TV Master MK IV
* TV Master 4 plus 2
* TV Master MK 6
* TV Master MK 8
* TV Master MK 10

The Colour TV series are the same games but in colour.

* Colour TV Game
* Colour TV Game 4 plus 2

* Colour TV Game MK 10

== Related brands ==

Binatone markets baby monitors, pet monitors, telephones, headphones and car accessories under the &quot;Motorola&quot; brand name under an agreement with Motorola Mobility and earlier, Motorola Inc.

Binatone also operates a subsidiary &quot;Hubble Connected&quot; that acts as a platform for connected devices. It acquired a Bengaluru, India-based startup &quot;Connovate&quot; in 2014 that merged into Hubble. In 2016, Dino Lalvani announced that Binatone intended to sell 20% of Hubble while shifting its corporate offices from the United States to Bengaluru, India.

<doc id="1232825" wikidata="Q2097334" url="?curid=1232825" title="Pittsburg State University">
<text>Pittsburg State University (Pitt State or PSU) is a public university in Pittsburg, Kansas, United States. It enrolls approximately 7,400 students (6,000 undergraduates and 1,400 graduate students) and is a member of the Kansas Board of Regents.

==History==
Pittsburg State University was founded in 1903 as the Auxiliary Manual Training Normal School, originally a branch of the State Normal School of Emporia (now Emporia State University). In 1913, it became a full-fledged four-year institution and dropped &quot;Auxiliary&quot; from the front of its name. In 1923, the institution changed its name to Kansas State Teachers College of Pittsburg, or Pittsburg State for short. Over the next four decades, its mission was broadened beyond teacher training. To reflect this, in 1959 its name was changed again to Kansas State College of Pittsburg. It became Pittsburg State University on April 21, 1977.

===Presidents===
Pittsburg State has had 11 leaders. The top leadership post was originally titled &quot;principal&quot; from 1903 to 1913. In 1913, the title was changed to president.
* Russell S. Russ (1903–1911)
* George E. Myers (1911–1913)
* William A. Brandenburg (1913–1940)
* O. P. Dellinger (1940–1941)
* Rees H. Hughes (1941–1957)
* Leonard H. Axe (1957–1965)
* George F. Budd (1965–1977)
* James Appleberry (1977–1983)
* Donald W. Wilson (1983–1995)
* John R. Darling (1995–1999)
* Tom W. Bryant (1999–2009)
* Steven A. Scott (2009–2022)
* Dan Shipp (2022–present)

==Campus==
Located in southeast Kansas, the school is on a campus.

Porter Hall (1927) is named for Ebenezer F. Porter, a state legislator who helped establish and fund the school.

The campus includes the $30 million Kansas Technology Center, a state-of-the-art technology program in the largest academic building in Kansas. In December 2014, the university opened the Bicknell Family Center for the Arts. The Bicknell Center provides Pittsburg State University with its first true performance facility since 1978, when deterioration forced the closure of Carney Hall. In addition to the Linda &amp; Lee Scott Performance Hall, the facility also houses a 250-seat theater, a 2,000-square-foot art gallery, grand lobby, reception hall, and multi-use rehearsal space for large musical groups.

PSU also operates a satellite campus in the Kansas City metro area, the Kansas City Metro Center Campus, offering a variety of bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. Two degrees are offered in Salina, Kansas on the campus of Salina Area Technical College.

==Academics==
PSU is organized into the following schools and colleges:
* College of Arts and Science
* Kelce College of Business
* College of Education
* College of Technology

The Kelce College of Business is accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). In addition, research institutes are located on campus such as the Business &amp; Technology Institute and the Kansas Polymer Research Center, housed in the newly completed Tyler Research Center.

==Athletics==


The Pittsburg State athletic teams are called the Gorillas. The university is a member of the NCAA Division II ranks, primarily competing in the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) since the 1989–90 academic year. The Gorillas previously competed in the Central States Intercollegiate Conference (CSIC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1976–77 to 1988–89; in the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC) from 1972–73 to 1975–76; in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC) from 1968–69 to 1971–72; in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (CIC) from 1923–24 to 1967–68; and in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC) from 1902–03 to 1922–23.

Pittsburg State competes in 12 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, softball, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball. Club sports include men&#x27;s baseball.

===Football===
The Pitt State football program began in 1908 under head coach Albert McLeland. Since that time, the program has produced the most wins in NCAA Division II history. It has been national champions on four occasions; 1957, 1961, 1991 and 2011. Pittsburg State defeated Wayne State University, 35–21 to claim its most recent national championship in 2011. During the 2004 season the Gorillas finished 14–1, losing 31–36 to Valdosta State University in the NCAA Division II National Football Championship. Pittsburg State has won, outright or shared, a total of 27 conference championships during the 96-year history of its intercollegiate program, including 13 conference titles in the last 19 seasons under Coach Chuck Broyles PSU reached the Division II National Championship game in 2004, 1995, and 1992. Its games with fellow MIAA Division II powerhouse Northwest Missouri State University are played at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, in the Fall Classic at Arrowhead. 26,695 attended the 2002 game—the most of any Division II game.

===The Gorillas===
PSU is the only university in the United States to feature a gorilla as a mascot. The concept of the mascot was conceived in 1920, and officially adopted on January 15, 1925. The current mascot, Gus, was designed in 1985 by L. Michael Hailey.

===Apple Day===
In 1907 a small delegation from the Pittsburg area lobbied the state legislature to give the newly established university an appropriation that would pay for the construction of the school&#x27;s first building. But one of the delegate members, Pittsburg mayor Clarence Price, apparently broke the rules by not exiting the floor before the session began (in some versions of the story, it was the namesake of Russ Hall, R. S. Russ, who performed the gaffe). The legislators good-naturedly fined the Pittsburg delegation a barrel of apples before awarding them the appropriation. And when the men returned to Pittsburg, the students were so amused by the story that they decided university administrators and faculty who had missed work and class in order to lobby in Topeka should have to pay the same fine. In those days, students were penalized for truancy. Because members of the faculty left their classrooms in order to attend the legislative session in Topeka, the students reasoned that faculty members should be penalized for their absence.

Twelve months later, on March 6, 1908, classes were dismissed for the entire day in honor of the first Apple Day (officially titled Commemoration Day). During an afternoon program in the assembly room of the Central School building, the students once again fined the faculty a barrel of apples. Thus began the unique, annual tradition at Pittsburg State of the teachers bringing apples for their students.

<text>Ariel José Graziani Lentini (born June 7, 1971) is a former football player. He is a naturalized Ecuadorian striker who represented the Ecuador national team on 34 occasions between 1997 and 2000. After retiring in Ecuador he is only able to play amateur football, he has chosen to play for Argentinian fifth-level club Atlético Empalme since May, 2007.

==Career==
Graziani has been a top goalscorer for practically every team for which he has played. He made his professional debut in 1993 with Newell&#x27;s Old Boys of Argentina, where he was a teammate with Diego Maradona until he transferred later that year to Sport Boys of the Peruvian First Division.

Graziani transferred to the Ecuadorian First Division to play for Aucas in 1995, and moved a year later to join Emelec. During his two years with the club, 1996 and 1997, he led the league in scoring (52 goals in 69 matches) while helping Emelec earn league titles. His standout play earned him a transfer to Morelia of the Mexican Primera División. Again he was one of the top goalscorers for his club and the league.

===Major League Soccer===

In 1999, Ariel was acquired by Major League Soccer for a transfer fee of slightly less than $2 million, which at the time was the highest transfer fee ever paid by the league. 

====New England Revolution====

On July 26, 1999, Graziani was allocated to New England Revolution. In New England, he would once again be playing with his former teammate Joe-Max Moore, with whom he had played at Emelec in 1997. The Revolution were able to add Graziani under their $1.7m salary budget due to the trade of midfielder Edwin Gorter to the Miami Fusion and the retirement of midfielder Richard Goulooze.

Graziani&#x27;s arrival in New England was well received by the media and Revolution front office. The Sun Chronicle referred to Grazini as the &quot;highest paid and, perhaps, most prolific player to ever perform in Major League Soccer...&quot;. The Revolution had been targeting Graziani since 1998, looking for a high-profile allocation from the league who could help with marketing as well as on the field. 

Revolution head coach Walter Zenga praised Graziani as &quot;great player&quot; stating Graziani has &quot;excelled as a goalscorer everywhere he has played. His addition gives us one of the most dangerous attacks in MLS.” Revolution General Manager Brian O&#x27;Donovan stated there was &quot;absolutely no doubt in our minds as an organization that we want Ariel Graziani on this team&quot; and added Graziani &quot;is a big-time player who will have a major impact on whatever team he goes to. We are celebrating the addition of a high-impact player in spite of our defensive weaknesses, which we can correct.&quot;

Graziani was immediately inserted into the lineup upon his arrival, making his Revolution debut (and first start) on July 31, 1999, a 4-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Mutiny. 
He made his home debut in a 2-1 loss to the San Jose Clash on August 12. 

Graziani&#x27;s home debut proved to be his final appearance in a Revolution jersey. Graziani played in only three matches for the club before he was traded to the Dallas Burn for Colombian international Leonel Álvarez on August 13. The trade was not well received, and was referred to as what may be the &quot;most shortsighted move in MLS history.&quot;

====Dallas Burn====

Graziani immediately made an impact on the Burn, scoring his first goal in the 4th minute of his first appearance on August 18, in a 3-0 victory over the 1st-place Colorado Rapids. He would make eight total appearances (all starts) for the Burn in 1999, contributing four total goals and one assist, helping Dave Dir&#x27;s side qualify for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year. 

Graziani continued his prolific play for the Burn in the following seasons, finishing as the Burn&#x27;s leading scorer in both 2000 and 2001, with 15 goals and with 11 goals respectively. He was named an All-Star in both seasons; representing the Western Conference in the 2000 MLS All-Star Game as a 46th-minute substitute, and scoring a 26th-minute goal for the West as a starter in the 2001 MLS All-Star Game.

====San Jose Earthquakes====

In the offseason, due to salary cap constraints, the Burn traded Graziani to the San Jose Earthquakes for Salvadoran international, and Quakes all-time leading goalscorer, Ronald Cerritos and a second-round pick in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft on February 8, 2002.

In the 2002 San Jose Earthquakes season, Graziani broke a record by scoring six game-winning goals on his way to leading the team with 14 goals and five assists. For the third consecutive year, Graziani received MLS All-Star honors, and represented MLS against the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. while the team&#x27;s leading goalscorer, Graziani failed to connect adequately with strike partner Landon Donovan. MLS loaned out the final year of his contract. A bidding war between Emelec and Barcelona SC ensued where, in the end, Barcelona offered MLS more money.

===Later Career===

In 2003, Graziani, was the top scorer in Ecuador with Barcelona SC. He also scored what was voted the top goal in that year&#x27;s Copa Libertadores against the eventual winners Boca Juniors. In 2004, he signed with Lanús in Argentina but only managed 4 goals in 17 games and eventually left the same year to return to Barcelona SC and scored 8 goals from 18 games. In 2005, Graziani signed for LDU Quito. He played there until December, 2006, when he officially retired. Nevertheless, in May, 2007, he signed with Atlético Empalme, where he started his career. Empalme in 2007 played for Santa Fe Province in zone 9 of the &quot;Torneo del Interior C&quot;, a complex regional fifth-level tournament.

Nowadays, Graziani holds a political position in his country of birth Argentina. He is the vice-mayor of a small town called Empalme Villa Constitución where he is trying to help the poorest people in his town.

Overcoming the 1–3 loss with a miraculous 5–0 victory, to achieve the first title, Dragan Talajić achievement was unforgettable and almost impossible, this second leg match became one of the most surprising and unforgettable comebacks in AFC Champions League history, which was called &quot;the miracle&quot;. Recalling the tournament, Talajić said, &quot;I was initially an assistant to the compatriots Tomislav Ivic, and I learned a lot from him, and I considered the opportunity to work with a great team as a wonderful thing, which is why I agreed to work with him, I was with the team eight months after we arrived at the beginning of the season, and I knew all about the players.&quot; and continued, &quot;I was young at the time, and maybe I was crazy by playing with five strikers, I told everyone before the match that we would win, I always knew we would win, but I didn&#x27;t know if the difference would be enough.&quot;

Ittihad achieved its first Arab championship, after defeating Tunisian Club Sportif Sfaxien in the final. On 5 November 2005, Ittihad won the Champions League for the second time in a row, after a 5–3 victory over Al-Ain. Mohammed Kallon, which loaned from AS Monaco, became the top scorer of the tournament with six goals; of which two were in the final—which helped to achieve the second title. Mohammed Noor, was awarded the best player in the tournament. The club remaining as the only to win back-to-back AFC Champions League titles in its current edition. The club qualified for the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, in the edition that was held in Japan, after achieving the Champions League title—as it became the second Saudi team to qualify for the tournament. On December 11, 2005, Ittihad defeated African champions Al-Ahly after Mohamed Noor&#x27;s only goal, to qualify for the semi-finals.

In total, Ittihad has won 8,649 trophies. However, football remains the primary sport.

<doc id="1232840" wikidata="Q774372" url="?curid=1232840" title="Elisha M. Pease">
<text>Elisha Marshall Pease (January 3, 1812 – August 26, 1883) was a Texas politician. He served as the fifth and 13th governor of Texas.

==Early life==
Elisha Marshall Pease was born in January 3, 1812 to Lorrain Thompson Pease and Sarah Marshall Pease. The native of Enfield, Connecticutt attended Westfield Academy in Massachusetts. 

==Career==
Among Pease&#x27;s first jobs was a position as a clerk in Hartford, Connecticut. By early 1835, he moved the Mexican Texas, settling in the local district of Mina while studying law. 
==Texas Republic==
Pease soon became active in the Texas independence movement and after the Texas Revolution began, Pease became the secretary of the provisional government. He served as the assistant secretary at the Convention of 1836 but was not an elected delegate to the Convention. After independence had been won, Pease was named the comptroller of public accounts in the government of the new but temporary Republic of Texas.

==Texas State==
Following the annexation of Texas to the United States, Pease was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1845 and reelected in 1847. In 1849, he ran for the Texas Senate from District 11 (Brazoria and Galveston counties) but lost to John B. Jones who was sworn in on November 5, 1849. Pease contested the election, was declared the winner, and was sworn in four days later on November 9, 1849.

Pease first ran for governor in 1851 but withdrew from the race two weeks before the election. He was elected in each of the next two elections, 1853 and 1855. As governor, he paid off the state debt and established the financial foundation that the state would later use to finance its schools and colleges.

==Civil War and aftermath==
After the war, he became a leader in the state Republican Party and was appointed as the civilian governor of Texas in 1867 by General Philip H. Sheridan, who was the military head of the Reconstruction government. Pease&#x27;s policies as governor alienated both ex-Unionists and ex-Confederates and he resigned in 1869.

==Personal life==
Pease married Lucadia Christiana Niles in 1850. They had two daughters who reached maturity.

Shortly after their marriage, the Peases vacationed at Niagara Falls, New York. After brief stays in Cincinnati and Louisville, they lodged for a week at the St. Charles Hotel in New Orleans.

During the American Civil War, Pease sided with the Union. He nonetheless enslaved several people; census records show ten enslaved people living and laboring at Pease&#x27;s Austin plantation in 1860.

==Death and legacy==
Pease died on August 26, 1883 of apoplexy. He was buried in Austin.

In 1856, surveyor Jacob de Córdova of the Galveston, Houston, and Henderson Railroad Company named a newly discovered river in West Texas the &quot;Pease River&quot; after the governor.

In 1875, Elisha and Lucatia Pease donated their homestead to the City of Austin that would eventually become Pease Park.

<doc id="1232841" wikidata="Q857813" url="?curid=1232841" title="SKI combinator calculus">
<text>The SKI combinator calculus is a combinatory logic system and a computational system. It can be thought of as a computer programming language, though it is not convenient for writing software. Instead, it is important in the mathematical theory of algorithms because it is an extremely simple Turing complete language. It can be likened to a reduced version of the untyped lambda calculus. It was introduced by Moses Schönfinkel and Haskell Curry.

All operations in lambda calculus can be encoded via abstraction elimination into the SKI calculus as binary trees whose leaves are one of the three symbols S, K, and I (called &quot;combinators&quot;).

== Notation ==
Although the most formal representation of the objects in this system requires binary trees, for simpler typesetting they are often represented as parenthesized expressions, as a shorthand for the tree they represent. Any subtrees may be parenthesized, but often only the right-side subtrees are parenthesized, with left associativity implied for any unparenthesized applications. For example, ISK means ((IS)K). Using this notation, a tree whose left subtree is the tree KS and whose right subtree is the tree SK can be written as KS(SK). If more explicitness is desired, the implied parentheses can be included as well: ((KS)(SK)).

==Informal description==
Informally, and using programming language jargon, a tree (&quot;xy&quot;) can be thought of as a function &quot;x&quot; applied to an argument &quot;y&quot;. When evaluated (&quot;i.e.&quot;, when the function is &quot;applied&quot; to the argument), the tree &quot;returns a value&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, transforms into another tree. The &quot;function&quot;, &quot;argument&quot; and the &quot;value&quot; are either combinators or binary trees. If they are binary trees, they may be thought of as functions too, if needed.

The evaluation operation is defined as follows:

(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; represent expressions made from the functions S, K, and I, and set values):

I returns its argument:
:I&quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;

K, when applied to any argument &quot;x&quot;, yields a one-argument constant function K&quot;x&quot;, which, when applied to any argument &quot;y&quot;, returns &quot;x&quot;:
:K&quot;xy&quot; = &quot;x&quot;

S is a substitution operator. It takes three arguments and then returns the first argument applied to the third, which is then applied to the result of the second argument applied to the third. More clearly:
:S&quot;xyz&quot; = &quot;xz&quot;(&quot;yz&quot;)

Example computation: SKSK evaluates to KK(SK) by the S-rule. Then if we evaluate KK(SK), we get K by the K-rule. As no further rule can be applied, the computation halts here.

For all trees &quot;x&quot; and all trees &quot;y&quot;, SKxy&quot; will always evaluate to &quot;y&quot; in two steps, Ky&quot;(&quot;xy&quot;) = &quot;y&quot;, so the ultimate result of evaluating SKxy&quot; will always equal the result of evaluating &quot;y&quot;. We say that SKx&quot; and I are &quot;functionally equivalent&quot; for any &quot;x&quot; because they always yield the same result when applied to any &quot;y&quot;.

From these definitions it can be shown that SKI calculus is not the minimum system that can fully perform the computations of lambda calculus, as all occurrences of I in any expression can be replaced by (SKK) or (SKS) or (SK &quot;x&quot;) for any &quot;x&quot;, and the resulting expression will yield the same result. So the &quot;I&quot; is merely syntactic sugar. Since I is optional, the system is also referred as SK calculus or SK combinator calculus.

It is possible to define a complete system using only one (improper) combinator. An example is Chris Barker&#x27;s iota combinator, which can be expressed in terms of S and K as follows:
: ι&quot;x&quot; = &quot;xSK = S(λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;xS)(λ&quot;x&quot;.K) = S(S(λx.x)(λx.S))(KK) = S(SI(KS))(KK)
It is possible to reconstruct S, K, and I from the iota combinator. Applying ι to itself gives ιι = ιSK = SSKK = SK(KK) which is functionally equivalent to I. K can be constructed by applying ι twice to I (which is equivalent to application of ι to itself): ι(ι(ιι)) = ι(ιιSK) = ι(ISK) = ι(SK) = SKSK = K. Applying ι one more time gives ι(ι(ι(ιι))) = ιK = KSK = S.

The simplest possible term forming a basis is X = λf.f λxyz.x z (y z) λxyz.x, which satisfies X X = K, and X (X X) = S.

==Formal definition==
The terms and derivations in this system can also be more formally defined:

Terms:
The set &quot;T&quot; of terms is defined recursively by the following rules.
# S, K, and I are terms.
# If τ1 and τ2 are terms, then (τ1τ2) is a term.
# Nothing is a term if not required to be so by the first two rules.

Derivations:
A derivation is a finite sequence of terms defined recursively by the following rules (where α and ι are words over the alphabet {S, K, I, (, )} while β, γ and δ are terms):
# If Δ is a derivation ending in an expression of the form α(Iβ)ι, then Δ followed by the term αβι is a derivation.
# If Δ is a derivation ending in an expression of the form α((Kβ)γ)ι, then Δ followed by the term αβι is a derivation.
# If Δ is a derivation ending in an expression of the form α(((Sβ)γ)δ)ι, then Δ followed by the term α((βδ)(γδ))ι is a derivation.
Assuming a sequence is a valid derivation to begin with, it can be extended using these rules. All derivations of length 1 are valid derivations.

==Converting lambda calculus expressions into SKI combinator calculus expressions==
An expression in the lambda calculus can be converted into an SKI combinator calculus expression in accordance with the following rules:
# λ&quot;x&quot;. &quot;x&quot; = I
# λ&quot;x&quot;. c = Kc (provided that c does not depend on &quot;x&quot;)
# λ&quot;x&quot;. &quot;f&quot; &quot;x&quot; = &quot;f&quot;
# λ&quot;x&quot;. &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; = S(λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;y&quot;)(λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;z&quot;)

==SKI expressions==

===Self-application and recursion===
SII is an expression that takes an argument and applies that argument to itself:
: SIIα = Iα(Iα) = αα

This is also known as U combinator, U&quot;x&quot; = &quot;xx&quot;. One interesting property of it is that its self-application is irreducible:
: SII(SII) = I(SII)(I(SII)) = SII(I(SII)) = SII(SII)
Or, using the equation as its definition directly, we immediately get U U = U U.

Another thing is that it allows one to write a function that applies one thing to the self application of another thing:
: (S(Kα)(SII))β = Kαβ(SIIβ) = α(Iβ(Iβ)) = α(ββ)
or it can be seen as defining yet another combinator directly, H&quot;xy&quot; = &quot;x&quot;(&quot;yy&quot;).

This function can be used to achieve recursion. If β is the function that applies α to the self application of something else, 
: β = Hα = S(Kα)(SII)
then the self-application of this β is the fixed point of that α:
: SIIβ = ββ = α(ββ) = α(α(ββ)) = formula_1
Or, directly again from the derived definition, Hα(Hα) = α(Hα(Hα)).

If α expresses a &quot;computational step&quot; computed by αρν for some ρ and ν, that assumes ρν&#x27; expresses &quot;the rest of the computation&quot; (for some ν&#x27; that α will &quot;compute&quot; from ν), then its fixed point ββ expresses the whole recursive computation, since using &quot;the same function&quot; ββ for the &quot;rest of computation&quot; call (with ββν = α(ββ)ν) is the very definition of recursion: ρν&#x27; = ββν&#x27; = α(ββ)ν&#x27; = ... . α will have to employ some kind of conditional to stop at some &quot;base case&quot; and not make the recursive call then, to avoid divergence.

This can be formalized, with
: β = Hα = S(Kα)(SII) = S(KS)Kα(SII) = S(S(KS)K)(K(SII)) α
as
: Yα = SIIβ = SII(Hα) = S(K(SII))H α = S(K(SII))(S(S(KS)K)(K(SII))) α
which gives us one possible encoding of the Y combinator. A shorter variation replaces its two leading subterms with just SSI, since Hα(Hα) = SHHα = SSIHα.

This becomes much shorter with the use of the B,C,W combinators, as the equivalent

: Yα = S(KU)(SB(KU))α = U(BαU) = BU(CBU)α = SSI(CBU)α

And with a pseudo-Haskell syntax it becomes the exceptionally short Y = U . (. U).

Following this approach, other fixpoint combinator definitions are possible. Thus,

* This Y, by Haskell Curry:
: Hgx&quot; = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;xx&quot;) ; Yg&quot; = Hg&quot;(Hg&quot;) ; Y = SSI(SB(KU)) = SSI(S(S(KS)K)(K(SII)))
* Turing&#x27;s Θ:
: Hhg&quot; = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;hhg&quot;) ; Θg&quot; = HH&quot;g&quot; ; Θ = U(B(SI)U) = SII(S(K(SI))(SII))
* Y&#x27; (with SK-encoding by John Tromp):
: Hgh&quot; = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;hgh&quot;) ; Y&#x27;g&quot; = HgH ; Y&#x27; = WC(SB(C(WC))) = SSK(S(K(SS(S(SSK))))K)
* Θ₄ by R.Statman:
: Hgyz&quot; = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;yyz&quot;) ; Θ₄g&quot; = Hg&quot;(Hg&quot;)(H&quot;g&quot;) ; Θ₄ = B(WW)(BW(BBB))
* or in general,
: H&quot;something&quot; = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;hsomething&quot;) ; YH &quot;g&quot; = H_____H__ &quot;g&quot;
: (where anything goes instead of &quot;_&quot;) or any other intermediary H combinator&#x27;s definition, with its correspondent Y definition to jump-start it correctly. In particular,
: L&quot;abcdefghijklmnopqstuvwxyzr&quot; = &quot;r&quot;(&quot;thisisafixedpointcombinator&quot;) ; Y = LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL 
In a strict programming language the Y combinator will expand until stack overflow, or never halt in case of tail call optimization. The Z combinator will work in strict languages (also called eager languages, where applicative evaluation order is applied).

: formula_2

===The reversal expression===
S(K(SI))K reverses the two terms following it:
: S(K(SI))Kαβ →
: K(SI)α(Kα)β →
: SI(Kα)β →
: Iβ(Kαβ) →
: Iβα →
: βα
It is thus equivalent to CI. And in general, S(K(Sf&quot;))K is equivalent to Cf&quot;, for any &quot;f&quot;.

===Boolean logic===
SKI combinator calculus can also implement Boolean logic in the form of an &quot;if-then-else&quot; structure. An &quot;if-then-else&quot; structure consists of a Boolean expression that is either true (T) or false (F) and two arguments, such that:
: T&quot;xy&quot; = &quot;x&quot;
and
: F&quot;xy&quot; = &quot;y&quot;

The key is in defining the two Boolean expressions. The first works just like one of our basic combinators:
: T = K
: K&quot;xy&quot; = &quot;x&quot;

The second is also fairly simple:
: F = SK
: SKxy&quot; = Ky(xy)&quot; = y

Once true and false are defined, all Boolean logic can be implemented in terms of &quot;if-then-else&quot; structures.

Boolean NOT (which returns the opposite of a given Boolean) works the same as the &quot;if-then-else&quot; structure, with F and T as the second and third values, so it can be implemented as a postfix operation:
: NOT = λb.b (F)(T) = λb.b (SK)(K)
If this is put in an &quot;if-then-else&quot; structure, it can be shown that this has the expected result
: (T)NOT = T(F)(T) = F
: (F)NOT = F(F)(T) = T

Boolean OR (which returns T if either of the two Boolean values surrounding it is T) works the same as an &quot;if-then-else&quot; structure with T as the second value, so it can be implemented as an infix operation:
: OR = T = K
If this is put in an &quot;if-then-else&quot; structure, it can be shown that this has the expected result:
: (T)OR(T) = T(T)(T) = T
: (T)OR(F) = T(T)(F) = T
: (F)OR(T) = F(T)(T) = T
: (F)OR(F) = F(T)(F) = F

Boolean AND (which returns T if both of the two Boolean values surrounding it are T) works the same as an &quot;if-then-else&quot; structure with F as the third value, so it can be implemented as a postfix operation:
: AND = F = SK
If this is put in an &quot;if-then-else&quot; structure, it can be shown that this has the expected result:
: (T)(T)AND = T(T)(F) = T
: (T)(F)AND = T(F)(F) = F
: (F)(T)AND = F(T)(F) = F
: (F)(F)AND = F(F)(F) = F

Because this defines T, F, NOT (as a postfix operator), OR (as an infix operator), and AND (as a postfix operator) in terms of SKI notation, this proves that the SKI system can fully express Boolean logic.

As the SKI calculus is complete, it is also possible to express NOT, OR and AND as prefix operators:
: NOT = S(SI(KF))(KT) (as S(SI(KF))(KT)&quot;x&quot; = SI(KF)&quot;x&quot;(KTx&quot;) = Ix&quot;(KFx&quot;)T = &quot;xFT)
: OR = SI(KT) (as SI(KT)&quot;xy&quot; = Ix&quot;(KTx&quot;)&quot;y&quot; = &quot;xTy&quot;)
: AND = SS(K(KF)) (as SS(K(KF))&quot;xy&quot; = Sx&quot;(K(KF)&quot;x&quot;)&quot;y&quot; = &quot;xy&quot;(KFy&quot;) = &quot;xy&quot;F)

==Connection to intuitionistic logic==
The combinators K and S correspond to two well-known axioms of sentential logic:
:.

Function application corresponds to the rule modus ponens:

:: from and , infer .

The axioms AK and AS, and the rule MP are complete for the implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic. In order for combinatory logic to have as a model:
*The implicational fragment of classical logic, would require the combinatory analog to the law of excluded middle, &quot;i.e.&quot;, Peirce&#x27;s law;
*Complete classical logic, would require the combinatory analog to the sentential axiom .

This connection between the types of combinators and the corresponding logical axioms is an instance of the Curry–Howard isomorphism.

<text>Place des Arts () is a major performing arts centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the largest cultural and artistic complex in Canada.

Home to the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre Métropolitain, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, and the Opéra de Montréal, the complex is situated between Saint Catherine and de Maisonneuve streets, and Saint-Urbain and Jeanne-Mance streets, in an area now known as the Quartier des spectacles in the borough of Ville-Marie.

Place des Arts was an initiative of Mayor Jean Drapeau, a noted lover of opera, as part of a project to expand the downtown core eastward from the concentration of business and financial activity in the centre-west part of downtown. The Corporation George-Étienne-Cartier, named in honour of George-Étienne Cartier, a Father of Confederation and opera lover, was set up to build it, and the first part of the complex (including the Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier) was inaugurated on September 21, 1963. The other theatres were added progressively.

==Additions==
The Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Montréal was added to the complex on May 28, 1992, and in 2009, construction began on a new concert hall for the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. The 2,100-seat facility opened in 2011 at the cost of C$105 million.

In 2015, the Quebec government announced it would spend $34.2 million to remodel the esplanade into a large outdoor stage that will host big events year round. Work is to be complete in 2018.

==Concert venues==
The Place des Arts includes six concert venues of various sizes:
*Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier (Capacity of 2,996)
*Montreal Symphony House (Capacity of 2,117)
*Théâtre Maisonneuve (Capacity of 1,453)
*Théâtre Jean-Duceppe (Capacity of 765)
*Cinquième salle (Capacity of 420)
*Salle Claude-Léveillée (Capacity of 129)

This wealth of theatres permits the staging of opera, symphony, ballet and other dance, chamber music, choral music, theatre, film presentation, and various other presentations and ceremonies. In addition to the theatres, the complex hosts the Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Montréal, a museum of contemporary art, as well as rehearsal halls, shops, services, and a large, popular esplanade decorated with original fountains and water cascades.

All the facilities are connected by an underground mall, also linked to Place-des-Arts Metro station and Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) to the north and the Complexe Desjardins to the south as part of the Underground City.

The site is decorated with several works of public art including &quot;L&#x27;artiste est celui qui fait voir l&#x27;autre côté des choses&quot; by Claude Bettinger, &quot;Comme si le temps… de la rue&quot; by Pierre Granche, and &quot;La Voie lactée&quot; by Geneviève Cadieux. A bust of conductor Wilfrid Pelletier by sculptor Arto Tchakmaktchian is on permanent display in the entrance hall.

In the summer, the esplanade and adjacent street comprise one of the important outdoor sites of the Festival International de Jazz de Montréal.

<text>The Sea Haggs were an indie rock band formed in Melbourne, Australia in 1991 by Perth expatriates Laura MacFarlane on guitar, viola, percussion and vocals with Iain McIntyre on guitar, bass and vocals, and Cameron Potts on drums. The band also featured other members, including Yvette Pusser (bass) Nicole (drums) and Ben Butler (percussion). Towards the end of its career, the band also recorded under the name Keckle.

In 1995, the band was wound up when MacFarlane moved to Seattle to join Sleater-Kinney. A compilation of Sea Haggs and Keckle recordings, along with some of MacFarlane&#x27;s solo work, appeared then under the name &quot;Jelly CD&quot;, released by McIntyre&#x27;s Woozy zine/imprint.

MacFarlane, Potts and McIntyre later went on to form ninetynine.

<text>989 Studios was a division of Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) that developed games for PlayStation consoles and Windows personal computers. Their games include &quot;EverQuest&quot;, &quot;Twisted Metal III&quot;, &quot;Twisted Metal 4&quot;, &quot;Syphon Filter&quot;, &quot;Syphon Filter 2&quot;, &quot;Jet Moto 3&quot;, &quot;Bust a Groove&quot;, and others.

==History==
The 989 Sports name developed from a long history of name changes and corporate shuffling within Sony centered around operations in Foster City, California. In August 1995, the video game business of Sony Imagesoft was merged with the product development branch of SCEA, becoming Sony Interactive Studios America (SISA) In 1998, SISA was spun off from SCEA and was renamed 989 Studios. On April 1, 2000, 989 Studios was merged back into SCEA as a first party development group, in order to prepare for the then-upcoming PlayStation 2. SCEA continued to release sports games under the 989 Sports brand until the brand was retired in 2005.

<doc id="1232869" wikidata="Q4654744" url="?curid=1232869" title="ATN">
<text>ATN is the Sydney flagship television station of the Seven Network in Australia. The licence, issued to a company named Amalgamated Television Services, a subsidiary of John Fairfax &amp; Sons, was one of the first four licences (two in Sydney, two in Melbourne) to be issued for commercial television stations in Australia. The station formed an affiliation with GTV-9 Melbourne in 1957, in order to share content. In 1963, Frank Packer ended up owning both GTV-9 and TCN-9, so as a result the stations switched their previous affiliations. ATN-7 and HSV-7 joined to create the Australian Television Network, which later became the Seven Network. ATN-7 is the home of the national level Seven News bulletins.

==History==
ATN-7 began broadcasting on 2 December 1956 and became the third television station in Sydney to begin regular transmissions.

The station opened in 1956 with principal offices and studios located at Mobbs Lane, Epping. The initial black and white cameras and other equipment was supplied by the Marconi Company of England. Conversion to PAL colour occurred on 1 March 1975. Digital DVB-T commenced on 1 January 2001.

The initial transmission tower in 1956 was located near the ABC tower at Gore Hill, Sydney. This was eventually demolished after ATN was invited to share a new site at Artarmon which was built by a new 3rd, commercial broadcaster TEN-10.

ATN-7 commenced digital television transmissions on 1 January 2001, broadcasting on VHF Channel 6 while maintaining analogue transmission on VHF Channel 7.

ATN-7&#x27;s Sydney transmissions are broadcast from masts operated by Transmitters Australia (TXA) at Artarmon and/or Willoughby. Retransmission translators to UHF channels service Sydney viewers from Kings Cross and North Head at Manly and north of Sydney at Bouddi, Gosford and Forresters Beach.

Beginning in the early 2000s, on-air programs were sent by digital link from the Seven Network&#x27;s national program play-out centre at Docklands in Melbourne where the Master Control Room was located for all metropolitan and regional feeds to be controlled. Programming line-up, advertisement output, feed switching, time zone monitoring and national transmission output was previously delivered here. All Seven Network owned and operated studios used to have their live signals relayed here: for instance, ATN&#x27;s output was fed to HSV and then transmitted via satellite or fibre optics to the towers around metropolitan Sydney. In 2019 however, this function was transferred to a new play-out centre in Sydney as part of a joint venture with the Nine Network.

The analogue signal for ATN-7 was turned off at 9:00 a.m. on 3 December 2013 by using a special five-minute retrospective clip of the local station and the song &quot;My City of Sydney&quot; by Tommy Leonetti, used for the first time in 30 years, combined with the old &quot;Mother kangaroo putting her baby joey to bed&quot; animation, which was played during the channel closedown sequence until the network began 24-hour service in 1993. The Good Night curtain at the end of the animation was tweaked to Goodbye and the TV mascot appeared for the final time to turn the analogue picture into a small white dot which slowly went away before going completely black, before the analogue signal itself was completely switched off.

In June 2023, 7NEWS moved their operations from Martin Place to their new purpose built studios in Eveleigh. In July 2023, Sunrise hosted its very first broadcast at its new studios. The first edition went to air live at 5:30am on 24 July 2023, with hosts Natalie Barr and Matt Shirvington, newsreader Edwina Bartholomew and sports presenter Mark Beretta, followed by The Morning Show’s Larry Emdur and Kylie Gillies. Joining 7NEWS, 7NEWS Spotlight, The Latest and 7NEWS.com.au, for the first time in more than 40 years, the entire Seven Sydney operation and all broadcast and operational staff (across all departments) are now under one roof. The new space cover two floors of Seven’s head office and are five times larger than the previous Martin Place location, with permanent sets for all programs. It brought to an end 19 years of Sunrise and Seven News, and 16 years of The Morning Show broadcasting at Martin Place.

==Program production==
The Epping facilities were expanded to provide five operational studios and the centre became the largest producer of Australian produced TV content, including &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;, &quot;A Country Practice&quot;, &quot;Hey Dad..!&quot;, &quot;All Saints&quot;, &quot;Terry Willesee Tonight&quot; and &quot;Home &amp; Away&quot;.

The Epping studios closed in early 2010 when new studio facilities serviced by Global Television, opened at the Australian Technology Park in Eveleigh.

News and live telecast programs are presently broadcast from the Eveleigh studios.

==RaceCam==
ATN&#x27;s engineering staff received two Emmy Awards – making ATN the first Australian company to receive such an award – for the technology, invention and further development of RaceCam, live mobile point-of-view TV cameras which were initially developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s for the station&#x27;s coverage of the Bathurst 1000. Visiting commentators from the United States organised for ATN staff to supply the camera and transmission systems for CBS&#x27; coverage of NASCAR races.

A variant of RaceCam was also developed for yachts in the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup off the coast of Fremantle. Later in the mid-1980s, the American Broadcasting Company asked ATN staff to develop aerofoil-designed cameras suitable for Formula One cars, and these were subsequently used at the Indianapolis 500.

==Seven&#x27;s Eveleigh Studios==

Prior to their Eveleigh Studios at the Australian Technology Park, the Seven Network&#x27;s Martin Place studios, once referred to on-air as &quot;News Central&quot; and based on the first five floors of The Colonial Building in Sydney were the main news presentation studios for, &quot;Seven News Sydney&quot;, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Weekend Sunrise&quot;, and &quot;The Morning Show&quot;. Comprising 3,000 square metres, viewers and tourists can see programs being broadcast from the street level studio.

In March 2021, it was announced that the Seven Network would move out of Martin Place to Eveleigh by the end of 2022 after almost two decades. The decision is understood to be a cost-saving move away from CBD property leasing. This then got delayed to mid-2023.

On 25 June 2023, &quot;Seven News Sydney&quot; signed off its final bulletin at Martin Place studios, wrapping 19 years and 6,873 days of broadcast. From 26 June 2023, its new broadcast home is at a purpose built studio at Eveleigh headquarters. The new space is five-times larger than Martin Place, allows for permanent sets for all programs, with two complete control rooms and more than 40sq m of LED screens, while all newsroom operations will now be located on a second entire floor.

==Seven News==
&quot;Seven News Sydney&quot; is directed by Sean Power and presented by Mark Ferguson and Angela Cox from Sunday to Thursday and Michael Usher and Angie Asimus on Friday and Saturday from Seven&#x27;s headquarters, located at Eveleigh. Sport is presented by Mel McLaughlin from Sunday to Thursday and Matt Carmichael on Friday and Saturday. Weather is presented by Angie Asimus from Sunday to Tuesday and Sally Bowrey on Friday and Saturday.

News updates for Sydney are presented throughout the afternoon and the early evenings, with news updates during the night being shown nationally, they can be seen on Seven, 7two and 7mate, as well as 7flix.

At the end of 2003, a year before all of the Seven Network&#x27;s News and Current Affairs moved to Martin Place, the ill-fated dual presenter format of Ross Symonds and Ann Sanders came to an end after the pair failed to make an ratings impact in the Sydney market, losing viewers to competition winner &quot;Nine News Sydney&quot; (then National Nine News), which had led in the ratings for decades. After Ian Ross took over from both Symonds and Sanders in 2003, &quot;Seven News Sydney&quot; became the 6pm ratings leader from February 2005 until 2010.

Ross presented his final bulletin for Seven News Sydney on Friday 27 November 2009 with Bath taking over as main weeknight presenter on Monday 30 November 2009. Former &quot;Nine News&quot; presenter Mark Ferguson took over from Bath as weekend news presenter from Saturday 28 November 2009. The bulletin retained its ratings lead until it was overtaken again by the rival Nine News bulletin in the ratings in 2011 – Seven&#x27;s 6pm bulletin won 14 out of 35 ratings weeks.

In January 2014, Mark Ferguson was appointed weeknight presenter, replacing Chris Bath due to poor ratings. Bath became weekend presenter and continued to host &quot;Sunday Night&quot; until her resignation in July 2015, after which Melissa Doyle took over. More changes to Sydney&#x27;s news presenting team in subsequent months saw former Melbourne weather presenter David Brown replace Sarah Cumming as Sydney&#x27;s weather presenter and Mel McLaughlin replace Jim Wilson as the sports presenter.

In August 2016, it was announced that Michael Usher would replace Melissa Doyle as Friday and Saturday presenter. Doyle will move into a new expanded role as senior correspondent and host of &quot;Sunday Night&quot;.

For its efforts in bringing news of the 2014 Sydney hostage crisis to the whole of Australia (ATN&#x27;s Martin Place news rooms and facilities were evacuated and news operations shifted to a makeshift studio miles from the site, with additional coverage from other stations nationwide), Seven News Sydney became the 2015 Logie Awards winner for Most Outstanding News Coverage.

In June 2020, Jim Wilson left Seven after 28 years with the network, to become a new host of 2GB&#x27;s Drive program. His last sports bulletin was 27 June 2020. It was later announced that Matt Shirvington would replace him.

On 5 November 2020, David Brown left the Sydney newsroom to return to Melbourne with Angie Asimus promoted to weeknights weather presenter.

In December 2020, it was announced Angela Cox would be joining Michael Usher as co-host of the weekend news bulletin from January 2021.

In June 2023, Matt Shirvington stepped down from his role of weekend sports presenter, to take up his new role as co-host of &quot;Sunrise&quot;. Matt Carmichael was announced as his replacement.

In September 2024, it was announced that Angela Cox would be joining Mark Ferguson as co-anchor of the weeknight bulletin.

In October 2024, it was announced that Angie Asimus would be joining Michael Usher as co-anchor of the weekend bulletin. Asimus would also continue her role as Sydney weather presenter alongside Mark Ferguson and Angela Cox, Sundays to Tuesdays.

Fill-in presenters include Michael Usher, Chris Reason and Angie Asimus (News), Matt Carmichael and Jelisa Apps (Sport), and Sally Bowrey, Amber Laider and Grace Fitzgibbon (Weather).

<doc id="1232881" wikidata="Q3083977" url="?curid=1232881" title="Joannes de Laet">
<text>Joannes or Johannes De Laet (Latinized as &quot;Ioannes Latius&quot;) (1581 in Antwerp – buried 15 December 1649, in Leiden) was a Dutch geographer and director of the Dutch West India Company. Philip Burden called his &quot;History of the New World&quot;, &quot;...arguably the finest description of the Americas published in the seventeenth century&quot; and &quot;...one of the foundation maps of Canada&quot;. De Laet was the first to print maps with the names &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; (now New York City) and &quot;Massachusetts&quot;.

==Life==

De Laet was born in Antwerp between September and December 1581, a son of cloth merchant Hans De Laet. In 1584, upon the fall of Antwerp to Spanish troops, the family, like tens of thousands of Protestant Flemings, fled to the Northern Netherlands and settled in Amsterdam. There Johannes attended the Latin school. He matriculated as a student of Theology and Philosophy at the University of Leiden in 1597. One of his teachers there was the great humanist scholar Joseph Justus Scaliger, with whom he maintained a correspondence until the latter&#x27;s death. After his graduation, his father sent him to London in 1603 to gain experience as a merchant. There he married Jacobmijntje van Loor, the daughter of a well-to-do Anglo-Dutch merchant, but returned to Leiden in 1607 upon her too early death. On 7 May 1608 he married Maria Boudewijns van Berlicum in Leiden. De Laet increased his fortune by investing in land reclamations and overseas trade and became one of the founding directors of the Dutch West Indies Company in 1620, an office he retained for the rest of his life. The city of Leiden sent him as an elder-delegate to the great Synod of Dort (1618–1619).

In his leisure time, De Laet spent much of his time in his study room, well-stocked with books, manuscripts, maps, globes and paintings. He published widely on topics ranging from church history to world history. He played a crucial role in the 1648 publication of &quot;Historia Naturalis Brasiliae&quot;, a compendium of research on the flora and fauna of Brazil by Georg Marcgraf and Willem Piso, whose patron was Johan Maurits, governor of Dutch Brazil. Marcgraf had written his portion of the work in a secret cipher, but died before the work was published. De Laet decoded it. A further contribution by De Laet was his preface to this important work, which emphasized the comparability of Northeast Brazil with other areas with a similar climate. The work subsequently circulated widely in northern Europe and beyond in scientific circles, and was not supplanted as an authoritative text for a hundred fifty years. He also edited Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Historia naturalis&quot; and Vitruvius&#x27; &quot;De architectura&quot;, wrote a detailed account of the New World and compiled an (unpublished) Old English-Latin dictionary – to mention just a selection of his forty publications. His correspondents include the English antiquaries William Camden, Sir Henry Spelman, Sir William Boswell, Abraham Wheelock, Sir Simonds D&#x27;Ewes, James Usher, Patrick Young, John Morris, and the Danish antiquary Ole Worm.

De Laet died in December 1649 while in The Hague. He was buried in the Pieterskerk in Leiden on the 14th, next to Maria Boudewijns who had died in 1633.

==Works==

===&quot;History of the New World&quot;===
His &quot;History of the New World&quot; was published in several editions by Bonaventure &amp; Abraham Elseviers, Leiden. The first edition was published in Dutch in 1625 as
&quot;Nieuwe Wereldt ofte Beschrijvinghe van West-Indien, uit veelerhande Schriften ende Aen-teekeningen van verscheyden Natien&quot;; a second edition also in Dutch, came out in 1630 as &quot;Beschrijvinghe van West-Indien door Joannes De Laet. Tweede druk: In ontallycke placesen verbetert, vermeerdert, met eenige nieuwe caerten, beelden van verscheijden dieren ende planten verciert&quot;.

A Latin edition from 1633, prepared by himself, was entitled &quot;Novus Orbis seu descriptionis Indiae Occidentalis Libri XVIII authore Joanne De Laet Antverp. Novis tabulis geographicis et variis animantium, Plantarum Fructuumque iconibus illustrata&quot;; in 1640 he published a French edition, in his own translation, as &quot;L&#x27;Histoire du Nouveau Monde ou description des Indes Occidentales, contenant dix-huict livres, enrichi de nouvelles tables geographiqiues &amp; figures des animaux, plantes &amp; fruicts&quot;.

Each successive edition had significantly updated maps.

===Other works===

<doc id="1232890" wikidata="Q902318" url="?curid=1232890" title="Iodised salt">
<text>Iodised salt (also spelled iodized salt) is table salt mixed with a minute amount of various iodine salts. The ingestion of iodine prevents iodine deficiency. Worldwide, iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual and developmental disabilities. Deficiency also causes thyroid gland problems, including endemic goitre. In many countries, iodine deficiency is a major public health problem that can be cheaply addressed by purposely adding small amounts of iodine to the sodium chloride salt.

Iodine is a micronutrient and dietary mineral that is naturally present in the food supply in some regions, especially near sea coasts but is generally quite rare in the Earth&#x27;s crust since iodine is a so-called heavy element, and abundance of chemical elements typically declines with greater atomic mass. Where natural levels of iodine in the soil are low and vegetables do not take up the iodine, iodine added to salt provides the small but essential amount of iodine needed by humans.

An opened package of table salt with iodide may rapidly lose its iodine content in high temperature and high relative humidity conditions through the process of oxidation and iodine sublimation. Poor manufacturing techniques and storage processes can also lead to insufficient amounts of iodine in table salt.

==Chemistry, biochemistry, and nutritional aspects==

Four inorganic compounds are used as iodide sources, depending on the producer: potassium iodate, potassium iodide, sodium iodate, and sodium iodide. Any of these compounds supplies the body with the iodine required for the biosynthesis of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) hormones by the thyroid gland. Animals also benefit from iodine supplements, and the hydrogen iodide derivative of ethylenediamine is the main supplement to livestock feed.

Salt is an effective vehicle for distributing iodine to the public because it does not spoil and is consumed in more predictable amounts than most other commodities. For example, the concentration of iodine in salt has gradually increased in Switzerland: 3.75 mg/kg in 1922, 7.5 mg/kg in 1962, 15 mg/kg in 1980, 20 mg/kg in 1998, and 25 mg/kg since 2014. These increases were found to improve iodine status in the general Swiss population.

Salt that is iodized with iodide may slowly lose its iodine content by exposure to excess air over long periods. Salts fortified with iodate are relatively stable to storage and heat; the main concern is reducing impurities in the salt itself, which can be removed relatively easily. Moisture accelerates the decomposition of iodate, but ceases to do so once reducing impurities are removed.

Contrary to popular belief, iodised salt cannot be used as a substitute for potassium iodide (KI) to protect a person&#x27;s thyroid gland in the event of a nuclear emergency. There is not enough iodine in iodised salt to block the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid.

==Production==

Edible salt can be iodised by spraying it with a potassium iodate or potassium iodide solution. 57 grams of potassium iodate, costing about US$1.15 (in 2006), is required to iodise a ton (2,000 pounds) of salt. Optional additives include:
* Stabilizers such as dextrose (typically at about 0.04%) and sodium thiosulfate, which prevent potassium iodide from oxidizing and evaporating. These ingredients are not required for potassium iodate, which is commonly used globally for its increased stability, but is not approved by the US FDA.
* Anti-caking agents such as calcium silicate and sodium ferrocyanide, which prevent clumping.

==In public health initiatives==

Worldwide, iodine deficiency affects two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual and developmental disabilities. According to public health experts, iodisation of salt may be the world&#x27;s simplest and most cost-effective measure available to improve health, only costing US$0.05 per person per year. At the World Summit for Children in
1990, a goal was set to eliminate iodine deficiency by 2000. At that time, 25% of households consumed iodised salt, a proportion that increased to 66% by 2006.

Salt producers are often, although not always, supportive of government initiatives to iodize edible salt supplies. Opposition to iodization comes from small salt producers who are concerned about the added expense, private makers of iodine pills, concerns about promoting salt intake, and unfounded rumors that iodization causes AIDS or other illnesses.

The United States Food and Drug Administration recommends 150 micrograms (0.15 mg) of iodine per day for adults.

=== Argentina ===
Since 8 May 1967 salt for human or animal use must be iodised, according to the Law 17,259.
=== Australia ===
Australian children were identified as being iodine deficient in a survey conducted between 2003 and 2004. As a result of this study the Australian Government mandated that all bread except &quot;organic&quot; bread must use iodised salt. There remains concern that this initiative is not sufficient for pregnant and lactating women.

===Brazil===
Iodine Deficiency Disorders were detected as a major public health issue by Brazilian authorities in the 1950s when about 20% of the population had a goitre. The National Agency for Sanitary Vigilance (ANVISA) is responsible for setting the mandatory iodine content of table salt. The Brazilian diet averages 12 g of table salt daily, more than twice the recommended value of 5 g daily. To avoid excess consumption of iodine, the iodizing of Brazilian table salt was reduced to 15–45  mg/kg in July 2013. Specialists criticized the move, saying that it would be better for the government to promote reduced salt intake, which would solve the iodine problem as well as reduce the incidence of high blood pressure.

===Canada===
For table and household use, salt sold to consumers in Canada must be iodized with 0.01% potassium iodide. Sea salt and salt sold for other purposes, such as pickling, may be sold uniodized.

===China===
Much of the Chinese population lives inland, far from sources of dietary iodine. In 1996, the Chinese Ministry of Public Health estimated that iodine deficiency was responsible for 10 million cases of intellectual developmental disorders in China. Chinese governments have held a legal monopoly on salt production since 119 BCE and began iodizing salt in the 1960s, but market reforms in the 1980s led to widespread smuggling of non-iodized salt from private producers. In the inland province of Ningxia, only 20% of the salt consumed was sold by the China National Salt Industry Corporation. The Chinese government responded by cracking down on smuggled salt, establishing a salt police with 25,000 officers to enforce the salt monopoly. Consumption of iodized salt reached 90% of the Chinese population by 2000.

===India===
India and all of its states ban the sale of non-iodized salt for human consumption. However, implementation and enforcement of this policy are imperfect; a 2009 survey found that 9% of households used non-iodized salt and that another 20% used insufficiently iodized salt.

Iodised salt was introduced to India in the late 1950s. Public awareness was increased by special programs and initiatives, both governmental and non-governmental. Currently, iodine deficiency is only present in a few isolated regions which are still unreachable. In India, some people use Himalayan rock salt. Rock salt however is low in iodine and should be consumed only when other iodine-rich foods are in the diet.

===Iran===
A national program with iodized salt started in 1992. A national survey of 1990 revealed the prevalence of iodine deficiency to be 20-80% in different parts of Iran indicating a major public health problem. Central provinces, far from the sea, had the highest prevalence of iodine deficiency. The national salt enrichment program was very successful. The prevalence of goiter in Iran dropped dramatically. The national survey in 1996 reported that 40% of boys and 50% of girls have goiter. The 3rd national survey in 2001 showed that the total goiter rate is 9.8%. In 2007, the 4th national survey was conducted 17 years after iodized salt consumption by Iranian households. In this study, the total goiter rate was 5.7%.

Concerns of iodine deficiency have raised over recent years due to the consumption of non-iodized salts especially sea salt which is strongly suggested by traditional medicine workers in Iran. Many of whom have not any academic studies.

===Kazakhstan===
Kazakhstan, a country in Central Eurasia in which local food supplies seldom contain sufficient iodine, has drastically reduced iodine deficiency through salt iodization programs. Campaigns by the government and non-profit organizations to educate the public about the benefits of iodized salt began in the mid-1990s, with iodization of edible salt becoming legally mandatory in 2002.

=== Malaysia ===
Salt being sold in the country must be iodized which is forced under the Food Regulation 1985 from 30 September 2020.

=== Nepal ===
The Salt Trading Corporation has been distributing Iodized Salt in Nepal since 1963. 98% of the Population uses Iodized Salt. Utilising non-Iodised salt for human consumption is prohibited. Salt costs about US$0.27 a Kilo.

===Philippines===
On December 20, 1995, Philippine President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act 8172: An Act for Salt Iodization Nationwide (ASIN). However, local production of non-iodized salt continues.

===Romania===
According to the 568/2002 law signed by the Romanian parliament and republished in 2009, since 2002 iodized salt has been distributed mandatory in the whole country. It is used mandatory on the market for household consumption, in bakeries, and for pregnant women. Iodised salt is optional though for animal consumption and the food industry, although widely used. The salt iodization process has to ensure a minimum of 30mg iodine/kg of salt.

===South Africa===
The South African government instructed that all salt for sale would be iodised after December 12, 1995.

=== Switzerland ===
Switzerland was the first country to introduce iodised salt, in the world&#x27;s first food fortification programme.

In the early 20th century, goitre was endemic in most Swiss cantons. Iodine was recognised to have an effect on goitre, but it was not until Heinrich Hunziker, a GP in Adliswil, argued that the necessary dose of iodine was minute (with larger amounts causing overdose issues), and another doctor, Otto Bayard, conducted successful experiments based on this idea, that the theory of goitre as iodine deficiency came to be accepted. Learning of Hunziker&#x27;s theory, Bayard conducted experiments with iodised salt containing only tiny amounts of iodine in villages badly affected by goitre. The success of these led, starting in 1922, to the adoption of iodised salt throughout the Swiss cantons.

Today, iodised salt continues to be used in Switzerland, where historically endemic iodine deficiency has been eradicated.

=== Syria ===
In the late 1980s, a Syrian endocrinologist named Samir Ouaess conducted research on hypothyroidism and noticed that 90 percent of Syrians suffer from hypothyroidism, 50 percent suffer from health problems as a result of Thyroid deficiency, and 10 percent of students suffer from a decline in their academic level due to that problem. Dr. Ouaess linked these results with the fact that natural drinking water sources in Syria do not contain enough minerals. He presented the result of that study to the Syrian Ministry of Health. After that, adding iodine to salt became almost mandatory till 2021, when the Syrian government cancelled the iodization of salt as a result of economic problems related to economic sanctions.

===United Kingdom===

Iodised salt is not readily available in the UK, where table salt forms a low proportion of salt consumed and there exists a conflict of interest with the salt-reduction campaign, which aims to reduce salt consumption further still.

UK milk had historically provided an alternative avenue for iodine intake, for which it is indirectly fortified through cattle feed. Iodisation of cattle feed was originally started in the 1930s to improve cow health. Iodophor disinfectants used in milking parlours also serve as a source of iodine for cows. Subsequent dairy promotion programs increased the population&#x27;s milk consumption, creating an &quot;accidental public health triumph&quot; by increasing the population&#x27;s iodine consumption and nearly eliminating goitre. However, several factors threaten this triumph: 2005 limits on iodine content of animal feed, organic milk (which contains lower amounts of iodine because of restrictions on mineral additions), and an overall reduction in milk intake. Several studies between 1995 and 2020 have found iodine deficiency in British teenagers and pregnant women.

===United States===
Iodized salt is not mandatory in the United States, but it is widely available.

In the early 20th century, goitres were especially prevalent in the region around the Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest. David Murray Cowie, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Michigan, led the United States to adopt the Swiss practice of adding sodium iodide or potassium iodide to table and cooking salt. On May 1, 1924, iodised salt was sold commercially in Michigan. By the fall of 1924, Morton Salt Company began distributing iodised salt nationally.

A 2017 study found that introducing iodized salt in 1924 raised the IQ of one-quarter of the population most deficient in iodine. These findings &quot;can explain roughly one decade&#x27;s worth of the upward trend in IQ in the United States (the Flynn effect)&quot;. The study also found &quot;a large increase in thyroid-related deaths following the countrywide adoption of iodized salt, which affected mostly older individuals in localities with a high prevalence of iodine deficiency&quot; between 1910–1960, a high short-term price for iodization&#x27;s long-running benefits. A 2013 study found a gradual increase in average intelligence of 1 standard deviation, 15 points in iodine-deficient areas and 3.5 points nationally after the introduction of iodized salt.

A 2018 paper found that the nationwide distribution of iodine-fortified salt increased incomes by 11%, labour force participation by 0.68 percentage points, and full-time work by 0.9 percentage points. According to the study, &quot;These impacts were largely driven by changes in the economic outcomes of young women. In later adulthood, both men and women had higher family incomes due to iodization.&quot;

==No-additive salts for canning and pickling==
In contrast to table salt, which often contains iodide as well as anti-caking ingredients, special canning and pickling salt is made for producing the brine to be used in pickling vegetables and other foodstuffs. Contrary to popular belief, however, iodized salt affects neither colour, taste, nor consistency of pickles.

Processed food from the US almost universally does not use iodised salt, raising concerns about possible deficiency. On the other hand, processed food from Thailand contribute sufficient iodine to most of the population.

==Fortification of salt with other elements==
===Double-fortified salt (DFS)===
Salt can also be double-fortified with iron and iodine. The iron is microencapsulated with stearin to prevent it from reacting with the iodine in the salt. Providing iron in addition to iodine in the convenient delivery vehicle of salt, it could serve as a sustainable approach to combating both iodine and iron deficiency disorders in areas where both deficiencies are prevalent.

Adding iron to iodized salt is complicated by several chemical, technical, and organoleptic issues. Since a viable DFS premix became available for scale-up in 2001, a body of scientific literature has been emerging to support the DFS initiative including studies conducted in Ghana, India, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Kenya and Morocco.

===Fluoridated salt===
In some countries, table salt is treated with potassium fluoride to enhance dental health.

===Diethylcarbamazine===
In India and China, diethylcarbamazine has been added to salt to combat lymphatic filariasis.

<text>Ratz (), officially the Movement for Civil Rights and Peace (Hebrew: , &quot;HaTnua&#x27;a LeZkhuyot HaEzrah VeLaShalom&quot;) was a left-wing political party in Israel that focused on human rights, civil rights and women&#x27;s rights. It was active from 1973 until its formal merger into Meretz in 1997. However, it remains a registered political party.

==History==
The Movement for Civil Rights and Peace was formed in 1973 by Shulamit Aloni, a former MK for the Alignment, 48 hours after she had left the party. As a member of the Israeli peace camp it opposed the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza strip and called for a peace settlement with the Palestine Liberation Organization from its birth. The party advocated secularism, the separation of religion and state, and civil rights, most notably women&#x27;s rights, a topic that was very close to Aloni. It was also a notable fighter against corruption and for a written constitution, and Aloni was the initiator of the Knesset sub-committee for basic laws (Israel&#x27;s equivalent of a constitution). For a while it also supported electoral reform.

In its first test, the 1973 elections, the party received 2% of the vote and won three seats in the Knesset, which were taken by Aloni, new American immigrant Marcia Freedman, and Boaz Moav. The party soon gained the popular name Ratz, as it used the letters Resh-Tzadik on the election ballot paper. Following Golda Meir&#x27;s resignation, the party joined Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s government and Aloni served as a minister without portfolio. This was one of the few periods in Israel&#x27;s political history when no religious parties were part of the coalition. The arrangement lasted for a few months only and when the National Religious Party joined the coalition, Ratz left it.

In 1975 the party merged with Aryeh Eliav, an independent MK who had broken away from the Alignment, to form a new party, Ya&#x27;ad – Civil Rights Movement. However, it broke up the following year, and Aloni and Moaz reformed Ratz. Freedman did not return, instead forming the Social-Democratic Faction (later renamed the Independent Socialist Faction) with Eliav, and then breaking away again to form the Women&#x27;s Party prior to the 1977 elections. Also prior to the 1977 elections, the Independent Socialist Faction merged with several other small left-wing parties (Moked, Meri and the Black Panthers) to form the Left Camp of Israel.

Ratz performed poorly in the 1977 elections, winning only one seat, which Aloni took. The 1981 elections were a repeat, with only Aloni representing the party in the Knesset. During the Knesset session she merged the party into the Alignment, but then broke away again before the term ended.

Before the 1984 elections the Left Camp of Israel merged into Ratz in a one-to-three ratio, bringing with them Ran Cohen among others. The elections were an improvement on the previous two, and saw the party win three seats. During the Knesset session, the party gained another two seats when Yossi Sarid and Mordechai Virshubski joined, defecting from the Alignment and Shinui respectively. The party retained its five-seat strength in the 1988 elections.

Prior to the 1992 elections the party formed an alliance with Mapam and Shinui named Meretz, whilst keeping their independent status within the union. The new party was a success, winning 12 seats, two more than the parties had held in the previous Knesset. Prior to the 1996 elections, Aloni finally lost the leadership of the party, defeated by Sarid in internal elections. She retired from politics immediately. In 1997 the merger was made official (though several Shinui members led by Avraham Poraz broke away to reform as an independent party, whilst David Zucker became an independent MK), and Ratz effectively ceased to exist. However, it remained a registered political party and submitted financial reports to the Party Registrar in 2010 and 2013.

<text>A combustor is a component or area of a gas turbine, ramjet, or scramjet engine where combustion takes place. It is also known as a burner, burner can, combustion chamber or flame holder. In a gas turbine engine, the &quot;combustor&quot; or combustion chamber is fed high-pressure air by the compression system. The combustor then heats this air at constant pressure as the fuel/air mix burns. As it burns the fuel/air mix heats and rapidly expands. The burned mix is exhausted from the combustor through the nozzle guide vanes to the turbine. In the case of ramjet or scramjet engines, the exhaust is directly fed out through the nozzle.

A combustor must contain and maintain stable combustion despite very high air flow rates. To do so combustors are carefully designed to first mix and ignite the air and fuel, and then mix in more air to complete the combustion process. Early gas turbine engines used a single chamber known as a can-type combustor. Today three main configurations exist: can, annular, and cannular (also referred to as can-annular tubo-annular). Afterburners are often considered another type of combustor.

Combustors play a crucial role in determining many of an engine&#x27;s operating characteristics, such as fuel efficiency, levels of emissions, and transient response (the response to changing conditions such as fuel flow and air speed).

==Fundamentals==

The objective of the combustor in a gas turbine is to add energy to the system to power the turbines, and produce a high-velocity gas to exhaust through the nozzle in aircraft applications. As with any engineering challenge, accomplishing this requires balancing many design considerations, such as the following:
*Completely combust the fuel. Otherwise, the engine wastes the unburned fuel and creates unwanted emissions of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (CO), and soot.
*Low pressure loss across the combustor. The turbine which the combustor feeds needs high-pressure flow to operate efficiently.
*The flame (combustion) must be held (contained) inside of the combustor. If combustion happens further back in the engine, the turbine stages can easily be overheated and damaged. Additionally, as turbine blades continue to grow more advanced and are able to withstand higher temperatures, the combustors are being designed to burn at higher temperatures and the parts of the combustor need to be designed to withstand those higher temperatures.
*It should be capable of relighting at high altitude in an event of engine flame-out.
*Uniform exit temperature profile. If there are hot spots in the exit flow, the turbine may be subjected to thermal stress or other types of damage. Similarly, the temperature profile within the combustor should avoid hot spots, as those can damage or destroy a combustor from the inside.
*Small physical size and weight. Space and weight are at a premium in aircraft applications, so a well designed combustor strives to be compact. Non-aircraft applications, like power-generating gas turbines, are not as constrained by this factor.
*Wide range of operation. Most combustors must be able to operate with a variety of inlet pressures, temperatures, and mass flows. These factors change with both engine settings and environmental conditions (i.e., full throttle at low altitude can be very different from idle throttle at high altitude).
*Environmental emissions. There are strict regulations on aircraft emissions of pollutants like carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, so combustors need to be designed to minimize those emissions. (See &quot;Emissions&quot; section below)

===History===
Advancements in combustor technology focused on several distinct areas; emissions, operating range, and durability. Early jet engines produced large amounts of smoke, so early combustor advances, in the 1950s, were aimed at reducing the smoke produced by the engine. Once smoke was essentially eliminated, efforts turned in the 1970s to reducing other emissions, like unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide (for more details, see the &quot;Emissions&quot; section below). The 1970s also saw improvement in combustor durability, as new manufacturing methods improved liner (see &quot;Components&quot; below) lifetime by nearly 100 times that of early liners. In the 1980s combustors began to improve their efficiency across the whole operating range; combustors tended to be highly efficient (99%+) at full power, but that efficiency dropped off at lower settings. Development over that decade improved efficiencies at lower levels. The 1990s and 2000s saw a renewed focus on reducing emissions, particularly nitrogen oxides. Combustor technology is still being actively researched and advanced, and much modern research focuses on improving the same aspects.

===Components===
The case is the outer shell of the combustor, and is a fairly simple structure. The casing generally requires little maintenance. The case is protected from thermal loads by the air flowing in it, so thermal performance is of limited concern. However, the casing serves as a pressure vessel that must withstand the difference between the high pressures inside the combustor and the lower pressure outside. That mechanical (rather than thermal) load is a driving design factor in the case.
The purpose of the diffuser is to slow the high-speed, highly compressed, air from the compressor to a velocity optimal for the combustor. Reducing the velocity results in an unavoidable loss in total pressure, so one of the design challenges is to limit the loss of pressure as much as possible. Furthermore, the diffuser must be designed to limit the flow distortion as much as possible by avoiding flow effects like boundary layer separation. Like most other gas turbine engine components, the diffuser is designed to be as short and light as possible. 
The liner contains the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see &quot;Air flow paths&quot; below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be designed and built to withstand extended high-temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high-performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, there are two main types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 Kelvin(K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high-performance, high-thrust engines.
The snout is an extension of the dome (see below) that acts as an air splitter, separating the primary air from the secondary air flows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling air; see &quot;Air flow paths&quot; section below).
The dome and swirler are the part of the combustor that the primary air (see &quot;Air flow paths&quot; below) flows through as it enters the combustion zone. Their role is to generate turbulence in the flow to rapidly mix the air with fuel. Early combustors tended to use &quot;bluff body domes&quot; (rather than swirlers), which used a simple plate to create wake turbulence to mix the fuel and air. Most modern designs, however, are &quot;swirl stabilized&quot; (use swirlers). The swirler establishes a local low pressure zone that forces some of the combustion products to recirculate, creating the high turbulence. However, the higher the turbulence, the higher the pressure loss will be for the combustor, so the dome and swirler must be carefully designed so as not to generate more turbulence than is needed to sufficiently mix the fuel and air.

The fuel injector is responsible for introducing fuel to the combustion zone and, along with the swirler (above), is responsible for mixing the fuel and air. There are four primary types of fuel injectors; pressure-atomizing, air blast, vaporizing, and premix/prevaporizing injectors. Pressure atomizing fuel injectors rely on high fuel pressures (as much as ) to atomize the fuel. This type of fuel injector has the advantage of being very simple, but it has several disadvantages. The fuel system must be robust enough to withstand such high pressures, and the fuel tends to be heterogeneously atomized, resulting in incomplete or uneven combustion which has more pollutants and smoke.

The second type of fuel injector is the air blast injector. This injector &quot;blasts&quot; a sheet of fuel with a stream of air, atomizing the fuel into homogeneous droplets. This type of fuel injector led to the first smokeless combustors. The air used is just some of the primary air (see &quot;Air flow paths&quot; below) that is diverted through the injector, rather than the swirler. This type of injector also requires lower fuel pressures than the pressure atomizing type.

The vaporizing fuel injector, the third type, is similar to the air blast injector in that primary air is mixed with the fuel as it is injected into the combustion zone. However, the fuel-air mixture travels through a tube within the combustion zone. Heat from the combustion zone is transferred to the fuel-air mixture, vaporizing some of the fuel (mixing it better) before it is combusted. This method allows the fuel to be combusted with less thermal radiation, which helps protect the liner. However, the vaporizer tube may have serious durability problems with low fuel flow within it (the fuel inside of the tube protects the tube from the combustion heat).

The premixing/prevaporizing injectors work by mixing or vaporizing the fuel before it reaches the combustion zone. This method allows the fuel to be very uniformly mixed with the air, reducing emissions from the engine. One disadvantage of this method is that fuel may auto-ignite or otherwise combust before the fuel-air mixture reaches the combustion zone. If this happens the combustor can be seriously damaged.
Most igniters in gas turbine applications are electrical spark igniters, similar to automotive spark plugs. The igniter needs to be in the combustion zone where the fuel and air are already mixed, but it needs to be far enough upstream so that it is not damaged by the combustion itself. Once the combustion is initially started by the igniter, it is self-sustaining, and the igniter is no longer used. In can-annular and annular combustors (see &quot;Types of combustors&quot; below), the flame can propagate from one combustion zone to another, so igniters are not needed at each one. In some systems ignition-assist techniques are used. One such method is oxygen injection, where oxygen is fed to the ignition area, helping the fuel easily combust. This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine may have to restart at high altitude.

===Air flow paths===

;Primary air
This is the main combustion air. It is highly compressed air from the high-pressure compressor (often decelerated via the diffuser) that is fed through the main channels in the dome of the combustor and the first set of liner holes. This air is mixed with fuel, and then combusted.
;Intermediate air
Intermediate air is the air injected into the combustion zone through the second set of liner holes (primary air goes through the first set). This air completes the reaction processes, diluting the high concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2), and also helps cooling down the gases from combustion.
;Dilution air
Dilution air is air injected through holes in the liner at the end of the combustion chamber to cool the flue gas before it reaches the turbines. The air is carefully used to produce the uniform temperature profile desired in the combustor. However, as turbine blade technology improves, allowing them to withstand higher temperatures, dilution air is used less, allowing the use of more combustion air.
;Cooling air
Cooling air is air that is injected through small holes in the liner to generate a layer (film) of cool air to protect the liner from the combustion temperatures. The implementation of cooling air has to be carefully designed so it does not directly interact with the combustion air and process. In some cases, as much as 50% of the inlet air is used as cooling air. There are several different methods of injecting this cooling air, and the method can influence the temperature profile that the liner is exposed to (see &quot;Liner&quot;, above).

==Types==
===Can===
Can combustors are self-contained cylindrical combustion chambers. Each &quot;can&quot; has its own fuel injector, igniter, liner, and casing. The primary air from the compressor is guided into each individual can, where it is decelerated, mixed with fuel, and then ignited. The secondary air also comes from the compressor, where it is fed outside of the liner (inside of which is where the combustion is taking place). The secondary air is then fed, usually through slits in the liner, into the combustion zone to cool the liner via thin film cooling.

In most applications, multiple cans are arranged around the central axis of the engine, and their shared exhaust is fed to the . Can-type combustors were most widely used in early gas turbine engines, owing to their ease of design and testing (one can test a single can, rather than have to test the whole system). Can-type combustors are easy to maintain, as only a single can needs to be removed, rather than the whole combustion section. Most modern gas turbine engines (particularly for aircraft applications) do not use can combustors, as they often weigh more than alternatives. Additionally, the pressure drop across the can is generally higher than other combustors (on the order of 7%). Most modern engines that use can combustors are turboshafts featuring centrifugal compressors.

===Can-annular===
The next type of combustor is the &quot;can-annular&quot; combustor. Like the can-type combustor, can-annular combustors have discrete combustion zones contained in separate liners with their own fuel injectors. Unlike the can combustor, all the combustion zones share a common ring (annulus) casing. Each combustion zone no longer has to serve as a pressure vessel. The combustion zones can also &quot;communicate&quot; with each other via liner holes or connecting tubes that allow some air to flow circumferentially. The exit flow from the can-annular combustor generally has a more uniform temperature profile, which is better for the turbine section. It also eliminates the need for each chamber to have its own igniter. Once the fire is lit in one or two cans, it can easily spread to and ignite the others. This type of combustor is also lighter than the can type, and has a lower pressure drop (on the order of 6%). However, a can-annular combustor can be more difficult to maintain than a can combustor. Examples of gas turbine engines utilizing a can-annular combustor include the General Electric J79 turbojet and the Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30 and Rolls-Royce Tay turbofans.

===Annular===
The final, and most-commonly used type of combustor is the fully annular combustor. Annular combustors do away with the separate combustion zones and simply have a continuous liner and casing in a ring (the annulus). There are many advantages to annular combustors, including more uniform combustion, shorter size (therefore lighter), and less surface area. Additionally, annular combustors tend to have very uniform exit temperatures. They also have the lowest pressure drop of the three designs (on the order of 5%). The annular design is also simpler, although testing generally requires a full size test rig. An engine that uses an annular combustor is the CFM International CFM56, the General Electric F110 and the Pratt &amp; Whitney F401. Almost all of the modern gas turbine engines use annular combustors; likewise, most combustor research and development focuses on improving this type.

====Double annular combustor====
One variation on the standard annular combustor is the &quot;double annular combustor&quot; (DAC). Like an annular combustor, the DAC is a continuous ring without separate combustion zones around the radius. The difference is that the combustor has two combustion zones around the ring; a pilot zone and a main zone. The pilot zone acts like that of a single annular combustor, and is the only zone operating at low power levels. At high power levels, the main zone is used as well, increasing air and mass flow through the combustor. GE&#x27;s implementation of this type of combustor focuses on reducing and emissions. A good diagram of a DAC is available from Purdue. Extending the same principles as the double annular combustor, triple annular and &quot;multiple annular&quot; combustors have been proposed and even patented.

==Emissions==
One of the driving factors in modern gas turbine design is reducing emissions, and the combustor is the primary contributor to a gas turbine&#x27;s emissions. Generally speaking, there are five major types of emissions from gas turbine engines: smoke, carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx).

Smoke is primarily mitigated by more evenly mixing the fuel with air. As discussed in the fuel injector section above, modern fuel injectors (such as airblast fuel injectors) evenly atomize the fuel and eliminate local pockets of high fuel concentration. Most modern engines use these types of fuel injectors and are essentially smokeless.

Carbon dioxide is a product of the combustion process, and it is primarily mitigated by reducing fuel usage. On average, 1 kg of jet fuel burned produces 3.2 kg of CO2. Carbon dioxide emissions will continue to drop as manufacturers improve the overall efficiency of gas turbine engines.

Unburned-hydrocarbon (UHC) and carbon-monoxide (CO) emissions are highly related. UHCs are essentially fuel that was not completely combusted. They are mostly produced at low power levels (where the engine is not burning all the fuel). Much of the UHC content reacts and forms CO within the combustor, which is why the two types of emissions are heavily related. As a result of this close relation, a combustor that is well optimized for CO emissions is inherently well optimized for UHC emissions, so most design work focuses on CO emissions.

Carbon monoxide is an intermediate product of combustion, and it is eliminated by oxidation. CO and OH react to form CO2 and H. This process, which consumes the CO, requires a relatively long time (&quot;relatively&quot; is used because the combustion process happens incredibly quickly), high temperatures, and high pressures. This fact means that a low-CO combustor has a long &quot;residence time&quot; (essentially the amount of time the gases are in the combustion chamber).

Like CO, Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are produced in the combustion zone. However, unlike CO, it is most produced during the conditions that CO is most consumed (high temperature, high pressure, long residence time). This means that, in general, reducing CO emissions results in an increase in NOx, and vice versa. This fact means that most successful emission reductions require the combination of several methods.
==Afterburners==

An afterburner (or reheat) is an additional component added to some jet engines, primarily those on military supersonic aircraft. Its purpose is to provide a temporary increase in thrust, both for supersonic flight and for takeoff (as the high wing loading typical of supersonic aircraft designs means that take-off speed is very high). On military aircraft the extra thrust is also useful for combat situations. This is achieved by injecting additional fuel into the jet pipe downstream of (i.e. &quot;after&quot;) the turbine and combusting it. The advantage of afterburning is significantly increased thrust; the disadvantage is its very high fuel consumption and inefficiency, though this is often regarded as acceptable for the short periods during which it is usually used.

Jet engines are referred to as operating &quot;wet&quot; when afterburning is being used and &quot;dry&quot; when the engine is used without afterburning. An engine producing maximum thrust wet is at &quot;maximum power&quot; or &quot;max reheat&quot; (this is the maximum power the engine can produce); an engine producing maximum thrust dry is at &quot;military power&quot; or &quot;max dry&quot;.

As with the main combustor in a gas turbine, the afterburner has both a case and a liner, serving the same purpose as their main combustor counterparts. One major difference between a main combustor and an afterburner is that the temperature rise is not constrained by a turbine section, therefore afterburners tend to have a much higher temperature rise than main combustors. Another difference is that afterburners are not designed to mix fuel as well as primary combustors, so not all the fuel is burned within the afterburner section. Afterburners also often require the use of flameholders to keep the velocity of the air in the afterburner from blowing the flame out. These are often bluff bodies or &quot;vee-gutters&quot; directly behind the fuel injectors that create localized low-speed flow in the same manner the dome does in the main combustor.

==Ramjets==

Ramjet engines differ in many ways from traditional gas turbine engines, but most of the same principles hold. One major difference is the lack of rotating machinery (a turbine) after the combustor. The combustor exhaust is directly fed to a nozzle. This allows ramjet combustors to burn at a higher temperature. Another difference is that many ramjet combustors do not use liners like gas turbine combustors do. Furthermore, some ramjet combustors are &quot;dump combustors&quot; rather than a more conventional type. Dump combustors inject fuel and rely on recirculation generated by a large change in area in the combustor (rather than swirlers in many gas turbine combustors). That said, many ramjet combustors are also similar to traditional gas turbine combustors, such as the combustor in the ramjet used by the RIM-8 Talos missile, which used a can-type combustor.

==Scramjets==

Scramjet (&quot;supersonic combustion ramjet&quot;) engines present a much different situation for the combustor than conventional gas turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, as they generally have few or no moving parts). While scramjet combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face many of the same design challenges, like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a scramjet combustor must address these challenges in a supersonic flow environment. For example, for a scramjet flying at Mach 5, the air flow entering the combustor would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a scramjet engine is preventing shock waves generated by combustor from traveling upstream into the inlet. If that were to happen, the engine may unstart, resulting in loss of thrust, among other problems. To prevent this, scramjet engines tend to have an isolator section (see image) immediately ahead of the combustion zone.

<doc id="1232911" wikidata="Q11688248" url="?curid=1232911" title="Lakeside, Ohio">
<text>Lakeside is a private community and census-designated place in Danbury Township, Ottawa County, Ohio, United States, on the shores of Lake Erie. It was formed in 1873 by members of the Methodist Church and remains a church-affiliated vacation resort and United Methodist Annual Conference site. It is one of only a few continuously operating Independent Chautauquas that persist in the 21st century. Located just west of the village of Marblehead, the community is approximately one square mile in size. The entire community is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Lakeside Historic District.

As an unincorporated community, Lakeside is governed by the Lakeside Association, a company whose CEO is the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the community. Its current CEO is Charles Allen.

==History==
Lakeside was established under the jurisdiction of the Central Ohio Conference of the UMC in August 1873. It was first founded as a tented revivalist camp, where it served as a hub for Methodist teachings. Meanwhile, the Chautauqua movement began to gain popularity. Lakeside soon thereafter became a Chautauqua, allowing its popularity to pick up over time and gain popularity with other denominations. The first permanent building was erected somewhere near the Hoover Auditorium, with the first residential cottages being built at the shores of Lake Erie. Despite this increase in popularity and permanent habitation, the bulk of services had yet to be provided until 1875, when the first part of Hotel Lakeside was built.

=== Residential land and usage ===
The first residential buildings were cottages, which were sold out on plots of land with renewable 99 year leases. Over the years, residents built cottages and houses on their plots. Most cottages are in the Victorian style, although different styles are present throughout. Restaurants and shops also opened around the downtown park of Lakeside. The Lakeside Association eventually purchased additional land on the eastern side, enabling the community to grow. Recreation facilities, meeting halls, places of worship, and parks have been added over the years. The Lakeside Association is responsible for the upkeep of all roads and public services within Lakeside. Lakeside has had its own symphony orchestra since its founding in 1963 with its current conductor, Daniel Meyer.
One of its most famous activities is shuffleboard, with its courts hosting lots of national tournaments throughout its history.

== Architecture ==

Lakeside contains many well-preserved historic buildings. Many are in their original Victorian style. The Lakeside Association owns and operates a number of large assembly buildings:

* Hoover Auditorium (Third St. between Walnut and Central)
* South Auditorium (Sixth St. between Walnut and Central)
* Orchestra Hall (corner of Second and Walnut)
* Wesley Lodge (Fifth St. between Walnut and Central)

Places of worship:
* Lakeside United Methodist Church (corner of Fifth and Central)
* Chapel in the Woods (outdoor space along Maple past Seventh)
* Hoover Auditorium (Third St between Walnut and Central) Lakeside&#x27;s main auditorium, with a seating capacity of 3,000 persons, is used for worship services on Sunday mornings and headline events during the week.
* Steele Memorial Bandstand &amp; Pavilion, are used for Sunset Worship services (and other entertainment), Pavilion for early-to-middle late summer, and Pavilion in late summer. 

==Notable visitors==
Because Lakeside has historically been a summer vacation destination with few year-round residents, the listed here made at least one stop to Lakeside during their lifetime. One person who still spends many summers here is Steve Hartman. Famous people who have been to Lakeside &amp; Hoover Auditorium are the likes of:
*Susan B. Anthony 
*William Jennings Bryan 
*Rose Woodallen Chapman (born in Lakeside)
*Amelia Earhart
*Eleanor Roosevelt
*Robert McFerrin
*Marian Anderson
*Pat Boone
*Emmylou Harris
*Ulysses S. Grant
*Rutherford B. Hayes 
*William McKinley
*Champ Clark
*Drew Pearson
*J.C. Penney
*Lowell Thomas
*Jane Addams

<text>Iterative Viterbi decoding is an algorithm that spots the subsequence &quot;S&quot; of an observation &quot;O&quot; = {&quot;o&quot;1, ..., &quot;o&quot;&quot;n&quot;} having the highest average probability (i.e., probability scaled by the length of &quot;S&quot;) of being generated by a given hidden Markov model &quot;M&quot; with &quot;m&quot; states. The algorithm uses a modified Viterbi algorithm as an internal step.

The scaled probability measure was first proposed by John S. Bridle. An early algorithm to solve this problem, sliding window, was proposed by Jay G. Wilpon et al., 1989, with constant cost &quot;T&quot; = &quot;mn&quot;2/2.

A faster algorithm consists of an iteration of calls to the Viterbi algorithm, reestimating a filler score until convergence.

== The algorithm ==

A basic (non-optimized) version, finding the sequence &quot;s&quot; with the smallest normalized distance from some subsequence of &quot;t&quot; is:

The ViterbiDistance() procedure returns the tuple (&quot;e&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;E&quot;), i.e., the Viterbi score &quot;&quot;e&quot; for the match of &quot;t&quot; and the selected entry (&quot;B&quot;) and exit (&quot;E&quot;) points from it. &quot;B&quot; and &quot;E&quot;&quot; have to be recorded using a simple modification to Viterbi.

A modification that can be applied to CYK tables, proposed by Antoine Rozenknop, consists in subtracting &quot;e&quot; from all elements of the initial matrix &quot;d&quot;.

<doc id="1232918" wikidata="Q2002026" url="?curid=1232918" title="Jazz Jackrabbit 2">
<text>Jazz Jackrabbit 2 is a 1998 platform game produced by Epic MegaGames. It was released for Windows, and later for Macintosh. Like the first game, &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot;, &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot; is a side-scrolling platform game but features additional multiplayer options, including the ability to play over a LAN or the Internet. The game was re-released on GOG.com along with the first game on November 30, 2017.

==Gameplay==
Just like its predecessor, &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot; is a 2D side-scroller that incorporates elements of shooting and platforming. The player must venture through a series of levels populated with enemies and environmental hazards that may hinder the player&#x27;s progress. The goal is to reach the level&#x27;s exit, usually indicated by an exit sign, whilst overcoming obstacles and hazards through the use of running and jumping as well as removing enemies and obstructions through the use of shooting and stomping.

The player is given a selection of characters to choose from, namely, Jazz, Spaz, and eventually (in the subsequent expansions) Lori. Each character has certain traits that are exclusive to them. For an example, Jazz can launch himself vertically higher than others, Spaz can double jump, and Lori can dash through enemies. Each Character is equipped with a gun that can fire an inexhaustible supply of projectiles in a straight manner. However, the player can encounter additional ammunition that can provide greater fire-power and range but with limiting ammo. These ammo types can result in different weapon behaviors such as a flamethrower, freeze ray, and explosives.

In addition to ammo, players will usually come across certain items and power-ups to aid the player. Some of these may include a 1-up that gives the player an extra life, a massive variety of food that when enough is collected gives the player a short period of invincibility in the form of a &quot;sugar rush&quot;, a variety of diamonds that when enough is collected gives the player an extra life, a carrot that boosts the player&#x27;s health, a bird in a cage that once is liberated will follow the player while automatically firing at any nearby enemy until the player takes damage, and rapid fire which decreases the delay between shots with every pick up without the player being required to rapidly tap the fire button, although, this power up will reset itself every time the player loses a life.

Also scattered throughout the levels are coins to collect. These are used as currency for when one encounters the merchant. If enough coins are collected, the merchant will teleport the player to a secret location in the level that is usually filled with power-ups and other goodies.

===Multiplayer===
The game&#x27;s split-screen mode supports up to four players, whereas online can support up to 32. The game also has local TCP/IPX network support. There are five multiplayer game modes: Cooperative (where players work together in the game&#x27;s single-player campaign), Battle (basically a deathmatch), Race (in which the first to complete all laps wins), Treasure Hunt (in which the first to collect 100 diamonds and find the exit wins the match), and Capture the Flag.

==Plot==
Devan Shell builds a time machine to rewrite history and eliminate hares. He steals Jazz and Eva&#x27;s wedding ring to complete the machine. Jazz chases his nemesis Devan Shell through time, in order to retrieve the ring. When his plans fail, Devan unleashes demons from Hell and also transforms into a demon. Jazz manages to defeat Devan, takes the ring and finally marries Eva.

==Development==
&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot; was produced by Epic MegaGames, now known as Epic Games, as the sequel to &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot;. It was accidentally confirmed in August 1994 by Arjan Brussee. It was released in 1998 for PCs running Windows, and later for Macintosh computers.

&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot; has a bundled level editor called Jazz Creation Station (JCS), allowing players to create their own levels. The level editor was not included in the Mac versions or shareware editions.

==Releases==
There were several variants and releases of &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot;.

; &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2: Shareware Edition&quot; 
Released on April 10, 1998, this is a promotional shareware game. It featured three single-player levels and two multiplayer levels. It was released to promote the game. The three single-player levels from the &quot;Shareware Edition&quot; were later included in the commercial release of the game.

; &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2: Holiday Hare &#x27;98&quot; 
This Christmas edition was released on November 6, 1998 for the PC in North America. Unlike the previous holiday editions, this game is commercial rather than shareware. It includes three single-player levels as well as a new boss and additional multiplayer levels.

; &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2: The Secret Files&quot; 
This Easter edition was released on March 15, 1999 for the PC in Europe (with a subsequent release in Poland by LK Avalon on June 19 which added Polish language in the options). This game introduces Jazz&#x27;s sister Lori as another playable character. When Lori dies, her face is immolated and she falls over. It also adds an extra episode to the original &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot;, called &quot;The Secret Files&quot;. This episode consists of three different zones, each one with three levels. New tiles are also added to &quot;The Secret Files&quot;, most of them from the first &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot;. The LK Avalon release can be found in the GOG.com re-release.

; &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2: The Secret Files Shareware Edition&quot; 
Released in 1999, this is a shareware game to promote &quot;The Secret Files&quot;. It is identical to the standard shareware version, but it includes the ability to play as Lori, as well as two new single-player levels in addition to the standard shareware version&#x27;s levels.

; &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2: The Christmas Chronicles&quot; 
This Christmas edition is an enhanced version of &quot;Holiday Hare &#x27;98&quot;, featuring Lori as a playable character. It was going to be released on November 25, 1999 for the PC across Europe, but the publisher, Project Two Interactive, went bankrupt before the release date. It was eventually released in Poland by LK Avalon. A limited European release followed shortly after. This version is based on the engine of &quot;The Secret Files&quot; and can be found in the GOG.com re-release.

==Reception==
&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot; received positive reviews. &quot;MacADDICT&quot;″s reviewer John Lee praised the Mac version&#x27;s fluent gameplay, but criticised it for not adding anything new to the genre, which he considered &quot;old fashioned&quot;. Trevor Covert of &quot;MacNN&quot; described the gameplay as &quot;addicting&quot; and praised the graphics, but &quot;Next Generation&quot; called the PC version &quot;unimpressive&quot;. &quot;PC Zone&quot; gave the same PC version an above-average review over a month before its European release date.

The game sold 29,000 units in the U.S. by October 2001. Despite good reviews, sales were insufficient and resulted in some financial loss for Gathering of Developers.

<text>Joydrop is a Canadian alternative rock band active in the late 1990s and early 2000s from Toronto, Ontario. The band reunited in 2017. The band consists of vocalist Tara Slone, guitarist Thomas Payne, bassist Tom McKay, and drummer Tony Rabalao.

==History==
Joydrop was formed in Toronto in 1997. Rabalao and McKay knew each other through recording sessions and tour work and McKay had seen Payne play live a number of times. Once Payne joined they found Slone by placing an ad in &quot;Now&quot; magazine.

The band&#x27;s first CD, &quot;Metasexual&quot;, was released in 1999 on the Tommy Boy label. They performed music from the album at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto in March that year. The song &quot;Beautiful&quot; from that album was on the Canadian charts and was used on the film &quot;Attraction&quot;; it played during the end credits. &quot;Beautiful&quot; was also featured on the syndicated TV show VIP and in the film &quot;Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed&quot;(it played during the end credits).

&quot;Viberate&quot;, the band&#x27;s second album, was also released on Tommy Boy. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Sometimes Wanna Die&quot;, was a hit in Canada, reaching #11 on Canada&#x27;s Airplay chart. The song&#x27;s music video, which featured Tommy Lee, was played on MTV2 in the US during the summer of 2001. &quot;Sometimes Wanna Die&quot; was one of the top 100 most played songs on Canadian radio in 2001, ranking #65.

Joydrop appeared as themselves, performing their two hit songs, on an episode of &quot;Special Unit 2&quot;.

Joydrop was nominated for a Juno Award for Best New Group in 2002.

On the 22nd anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, Slone reminisced about what caused the band to break up:

Our fans might not know that our lifespan as a band was cut short partially by circumstances beyond our control. First, our song “Sometimes Wanna Die” was removed from all radio stations in the US after 9/11. Then, as we were getting set to release our second single, our record company was absorbed by a bigger one, and we lost our record deal. We had no more budget to tour or release our new song, and we didn’t own our master recording. This stuff happens in the record business all then time… but it happened to us, and it sucked. Still does.

Following the band&#x27;s breakup, Slone released a solo album and was a contestant on &quot;Rock Star: INXS&quot;. Tony Rabalao also went solo and put out a CD under the name Lehlo but plays in Slone&#x27;s band as well. Thomas McKay is a producer with a recording studio www.exetersoundstudios.com He worked on Slone&#x27;s and Rabalao&#x27;s solo CDs as well as numerous other Canadian, American and British bands. Thomas Payne is writing and producing music for stage in Stratford Ontario. As of 2010, Slone is part of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; on CKAL-DT (Citytv Calgary).

On April 2, 2017, Joydrop reunited for a performance at Hometown Hockey&#x27;s tour stop in Guelph, Ontario. The gig led to further performances in 2017, including a show at the Bovine on August 25, 2017 in Toronto.

<text>Leroy Randle &quot;Roy&quot; Grumman (4 January 1895 – 4 October 1982) was an American aeronautical engineer, test pilot, and industrialist. In 1929, he co-founded Grumman Aircraft Engineering Co., later renamed Grumman Aerospace Corporation, and now part of Northrop Grumman.
==Early life==
Grumman was born in Huntington, New York. His forebears had Connecticut roots and owned a brewery. When he was a child, his father, George Tyson Grumman, owned and operated a carriage shop, and later worked for the post office. From an early age, &quot;Red Mike&quot; (a nickname he gained because of his red-blond hair) demonstrated an interest in aviation, and in his 20 June 1911 high school salutatory address at Huntington High School, Grumman predicted that &quot;[t]he final perfection of the aeroplane will be one of the greatest triumphs that man has ever gained over nature.&quot;

Grumman earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University in 1916. His first job was in the engineering department of the New York Telephone Company. After the United States entered World War I, he enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve in June 1917 as a machinist&#x27;s mate, 2nd class, and was sent to Columbia University for a course on &quot;subchaser&quot; engines.

==Aviation career==
Although Grumman applied for flight training, he failed a medical evaluation when the examining board incorrectly diagnosed flat feet. A clerical error, however, had him report to a course in aircraft inspection for pilot trainees at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Without revealing the error in classification, he entered primary flight training at Naval Air Station Miami and successfully completed advanced flight training in Pensacola, Florida, in September 1918. Raymond P. Applegate, his flight instructor, recalled several years later that his young charge &quot;was very, very reticent. Most of the guys, after they [learned to] fly, they became tougher than hell. Grumman didn&#x27;t.&quot; He was commissioned an ensign (as naval aviator No. 1216), eventually becoming a flight instructor, and assigned to a bombing squadron.

After one tour of duty, the U.S. Navy sent him to Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study the brand new discipline of aeronautical engineering. After the completion of the course, Grumman&#x27;s first posting, along with a promotion to lieutenant, was at the League Island Naval Yard as an acceptance test pilot for Curtiss- and Navy-built flying boats.

In 1919, the U.S. Navy stationed Grumman at Loening Aeronautical Engineering Corporation in New York City as the project engineer to supervise the firm&#x27;s construction of 52 Loening M-8 monoplane observation/fighter aircraft under contract to the Navy. His duties included test flying as well as serving as the production supervisor. Grover Loening, the company president, was so impressed with his work that he offered Grumman a position. After a reduction in rank to ensign in the peacetime U.S. Navy, Grumman resigned his Naval commission in October 1920, becoming a test pilot flying various types of Loening amphibians while doing some design and development on these aircraft. He quickly moved up in the Loening organization, becoming the factory manager and then general manager with responsibility over aircraft design, a position he held until the company was sold in 1929 on the eve of the Depression to Keystone Aircraft. Keystone closed their Manhattan factory and moved operations to Bristol, Pennsylvania.

==Company founding==
Unwilling to leave Long Island to continue working for Keystone, Grumman joined fellow Loening employees Jake Swirbul and William Schwendler in resolving that their best option was to quit and form their own company. Grumman mortgaged his house for $16,950 and Swirbul&#x27;s mother borrowed $6,000 from her employers to help set up Grumman Aeronautical Engineering Co. The co-founders were soon joined by Ed Poor, Grover Loening&#x27;s business manager, and E. Clinton Towl, who had recently come from Wall Street. These five men formed the company&#x27;s inner circle of management for the next 50 years. Loening and his brother, Albert P. Loening, also became investors. The company was named after its largest stockholder and first president.

On 2 January 1930, the company took possession of an abandoned auto showroom garage in Baldwin, New York, that had once been the Cox-Klemin Aircraft Co. factory. Initially, the new company, with only 18 people on salary, had contracts to repair damaged Loening amphibians (surplus parts had been bought from the Loening works) and traded on its expertise in working with aluminum by building aluminum floats and producing aluminum truck bodies. The first project of the new company involved Grumman and Swirbul, as president and vice-president, on hands and knees, sorting out and matching nuts and bolts, prior to assembling Loening floats.

Swirbul and Grumman oversaw the day-to-day operations of the company. While the employees in the plant felt comfortable calling the outgoing Swirbul &quot;Jake&quot;, no one ever called Grumman anything but &quot;Mr. Grumman&quot; out of deference to his reserved manner and respect for his skill as an engineer and designer. Dick Hutton, Grumman engineer and later senior vice-president of engineering described him as a &quot;great engineer, respected by many ...&quot; To family and close friends, he was invariably known as &quot;Roy&quot;.

Having been told of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s desire for retractable landing gear, Leroy Grumman was awarded , &quot;Retractable Landing Gear for Airplanes&quot; in 1932, based on an earlier design that he had developed for the Loening Air Yacht. The innovative, manually operated landing gear which progressed from a heavy and unreliable design to a more sturdy version helped his company win contracts from the U.S. Navy. When the Grumman Company received its first U.S. Navy production contract for a two-seater biplane fighter, the FF-1, it featured Grumman&#x27;s trademark &quot;splayed out&quot; landing gear. Grumman&#x27;s ability as an engineer and designer was characterized by a Grumman Company engineer as that of &quot;&#x27;a master of the educated hunch&#x27; who could foresee technical problems and their solutions.&quot; He single-handedly invented the famous &quot;Sto-Wing&quot; wing-panel folding system that revolutionized carrier aircraft storage and handling, pioneered on the F4F-4 Wildcat subtype. He worked out the solution by sticking paper clips into a soap eraser to find the pivot point that made the Sto-Wing possible.

Although Grumman realized the importance of his close relationship with the U.S. Navy, by the mid-1930s, he began to design aircraft for the commercial market with the development of the G-21 &quot;Goose&quot; amphibian and the G-22 &quot;Gulfhawk&quot;, civil version of the Grumman F3F carrier-based fighter.

===Expansion===
As the company expanded, it moved to bigger quarters – to Valley Stream in 1931, Farmingdale in 1932, and finally Bethpage in 1937. In 1934, a company legend grew up around the number &quot;250&quot; which marked the zenith for expansion in Grumman&#x27;s mind. He reasoned that if there were more than 250 employees, &quot;it&#x27;s going to be too big and we&#x27;re going to lose control of it. That&#x27;s where we ought to stop.&quot; Company accountant Towl was eventually deputized to tell Grumman that the payroll was already at 256.

Although Grumman resisted the &quot;expansionist&quot; efforts that Swirbul advocated, employment grew from 700 in 1939 to 25,500 in 1943, with the company known as the &quot;Grumman Iron Works&quot; (a name derived from their product line&#x27;s rugged structure and a design philosophy espoused by both Swirbul and Grumman) becoming the primary source for U.S. Navy aircraft.

==Management style==
Despite his innate shyness, Grumman&#x27;s management style included a &quot;hands-on&quot; approach where he could talk comfortably with both executives and factory floor workers. His relationship with Swirbul was unusual. They resolved early in their partnership to work out of one office; both men further pledged that any problems or conflicts that arose between them would not fester, and that neither man would leave the office until they came to an understanding.

During an unusually hectic period in the summer of 1944, Grumman sought a release from tension in a unique manner. Seeking out company test pilot Selden &quot;Connie&quot; Converse, he asked for a check out in a &quot;hot ship&quot;: the front line F6F Hellcat. After a 10-minute cockpit check, Grumman waved Converse away, started the engine and was soon taxiing down the runway and into the air on a half-hour joy ride. Even though he hadn&#x27;t flown for years, as he had in the past, when things built up, he would &quot;take his troubles upstairs and leave them there.&quot; The factory test pilots observed that Grumman had the flaps down as he taxied back to the flight line, and insisted that he pay the standard $1.00 fine for a flight infraction. Grumman stuffed a five-dollar bill into the party fund container, confiding that it was to make up &quot;for things he&#x27;d done in the air that they hadn&#x27;t seen.&quot;

==World War II==
By 1939, as World War II began, Grumman&#x27;s struggling company could hardly be considered an industrial giant, with all of its property relying on the services of a single security guard, yet the company was obtaining important civil and military contracts. However, the next year saw dramatic changes in the company&#x27;s fortunes as the war in Europe prompted France and Britain to order F4F Wildcats, Grumman&#x27;s first monoplane fighter design, still bearing his original signature design element, the retractable undercarriage that had been created in 1932.

Beginning with the Wildcat and then with the F6F Hellcat fighters, Grumman and Swirbul remained the key figures in the design office. As the war progressed, the pair continued to advance new projects, including the largest single-engine aircraft of World War II, the TBF Avenger torpedo bomber and F7F Tigercat and F8F Bearcat fighter aircraft.

Near the end of the war, Grumman was given a penicillin injection to combat pneumonia, resulting in a severe reaction that affected his eyesight. Although he was not entirely blind, his vision was greatly affected; Grumman began to &quot;become less visible&quot; in the company.

==Postwar==
By March 1945, Grumman oversaw a production effort where all types reached a record 664 aircraft manufactured in one month, although Swirbul had &quot;farmed out&quot; production to a vast chain of subsidiary and licensed manufacturing plants. Like its competitors, Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation experienced severe postwar downsizing, dropping from 20,500 to 5,400 employees immediately after the cessation of hostilities. It was an extremely hard decision because the company had been careful to cultivate a positive workplace culture; when a canvass was made of employees who wanted to &quot;move on&quot; at war&#x27;s end, only 126 came forward.

Swirbul realized his wartime expansion would have to be abandoned, and together with Grumman made the momentous call for a complete layoff of all staff. However, Grumman personally retained as many veteran employees as possible, calling back the most proficient and experienced &quot;hands&quot;, predominantly those who had 10 years of service. Grumman stepped down from the role of company president in 1946, but continued to play an active role in management.

Building with the core group, Swirbul and Grumman restructured the company, first solidifying its long-term contracts with the U.S. Navy, beginning a continuous line of new combat aircraft. Grumman&#x27;s first venture into jet aircraft, the F9F Panther, became operational in 1949, although the company&#x27;s most significant postwar successes came in the 1960s with the A-6 Intruder and in the 1970s with the F-14 Tomcat. Although the relationship that Grumman had established with the U.S. Navy was the hallmark of the company&#x27;s success, a set of new projects were initiated with the development of an engineering department, set up in much the same way that he had started out, with a small core of eight engineers given the mandate to explore new technology.

With Swirbul&#x27;s death on 28 June 1960, Grumman lost not only a close friend but his &quot;right hand&quot; during a time when he was faced with critical decisions as to the company&#x27;s future. He successfully guided the company into finding new markets for new products. In the move to diversification, he again entered the commercial civil aviation market, introducing landmark designs such as the Ag Cat aerial application and crop-dusting biplane and the Gulfstream I, Gulfstream II, Gulfstream III and Gulfstream IV series of executive turboprop and jet transport aircraft. Although his role as chairman became reduced, Grumman&#x27;s counsel was paramount and when the Gulfstream project was launched, two models of a high-wing and low-wing configuration were set up outside his office. Grumman personally made the decision to go with &quot;the low wing&quot;.

While continuing the company tradition of aircraft production for naval aviation, Grumman pushed for a shift in priorities resulting in the Space Steering Group, a space program that culminated in the design and production of the Apollo program&#x27;s Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) that landed astronauts on the Moon in 1969. During that same year, the company was rebranded as Grumman Aerospace Corporation. Throughout this period, Grumman&#x27;s eyesight continued to fail, and he &quot;took to wearing dark glasses&quot; which further limited his mobility.

==Later life==
On 19 May 1966, Grumman retired as chairman of Grumman, but was elected honorary chairman for his lifetime, remaining as a director until 15 June 1972. He continued to visit the company&#x27;s facilities until his health began to fail in the early 1980s, as diabetes robbed him of the last &quot;vestiges of his eyesight.&quot; Grumman and his family retained their 8,299 sq ft, 2.5 acre waterfront estate at 77 Bayview Road in Plandome Manor on Long Island where, after a long illness, he died at the North Shore University Hospital in nearby Manhasset on 4 October 1982, aged 87.

==Honors and tributes==
A number of honors have been bestowed on Grumman including the Medal for Merit from the U.S. President (1948), an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree by Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1950, the Daniel Guggenheim Medal for aeronautics pioneering, and the NAS Award in Aeronautical Engineering (1968) from the National Academy of Sciences.

In 1972, Grumman was inducted in the National Aviation Hall of Fame, the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame in 1973, and the Long Island Technology Hall of Fame in 2002.

The USNS &quot;Leroy Grumman&quot; (T-AO-195), a United States Navy fleet replenishment oiler, christened by his three daughters, was launched in 1988 and delivered to the U.S. Navy in 1989. In January 2011, a Civil Air Patrol Squadron from Northport, Long Island, New York, was renamed in his honor: the former Suffolk County Cadet Squadron VII now calls itself the Leroy R. Grumman Cadet Squadron.

In 1953, Grumman was elected to the board of trustees of his alma mater, Cornell University, and donated $110,000 for a new squash building which now bears his name, as does an office and lab space on the campus.
