<text>is a multi-disciplinary artist born in Tokyo, Japan and working in New York City. He graduated from Chiba University in 1957 with a major in Japanese Literature. An important figure in postwar Japanese art during the sixties, he was active in many facets of the Tokyo art scene. He was a central member of Group Ongaku and was associated with a number of other Japanese art groups such as Neo-Dada Organizers, Hi-Red Center, and Team Random (the first computer art group organized in Japan). 

Tone was also a member of Fluxus and one of the founding members of its Japanese branch. Many of his works were performed at Fluxus festivals or distributed by George Maciunas’s various Fluxus operations. Relocating to the United States in 1972, he has since gained a reputation as a musician, performer and writer working with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, Senda Nengudi, Florian Hecker, and many others. Tone is also known as a pioneer of “Glitch” music due to his groundbreaking modifications of compact discs and CD players.

== Early life in Tokyo ==
While in high-school Tone became interested in Japanese Avant-Garde poetry and prose of the 1920s and 30s. After entering the Literature program at Chiba National University, where he was enrolled from 1953-1957, Tone’s interest in literature expanded to a more general interest in the modernism of the interwar period. During this time, Tone was particularly influenced by Assistant Professor Tsuneyoshi Shigenobu and the instructor Isamu Kurita. Under Shigenobu’s guidance, Tone and his classmates translated Maurice Blanchot’s &quot;La Part du feu&quot; over a two-year period. Kurita, on the other hand, taught Tone about Bataille as well as introduced him to critics and poets of his own generation such as Yoshiaki Tōno, Kōichi Iijima and Makoto Ōoka. Tone, meanwhile, continued to seek out prewar Japanese avant-garde culture in journals such as “Shi to Shinron,” “Ge.Gjgjgam.Prr.Gjmgem,” “Bara●Majutsu●Gakusetsu,” and “Fukuikutaru Kafu-yo” and through the work of Tomoyoshi Murayama and his Mavo group. Tone then wrote his thesis on Dada and Surrealism, interviewing many of the prominent figures of the 20th century avant-garde in Japan in the process such as Katsue Kitazono, Shūzō Takiguchi, Kōichi Kihara and Sansei Yamanaka.

== Group Ongaku and Other Early Artistic Activity ==
In the late 1950s, Shūko Mizuno, Tone’s classmate at Chiba University enrolled at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music (Tokyo Geijutsu Daigaku, abbrev. Geidai) and began musically improvising with classmate Takehisa Kosugi. Kosugi played a tape for Tone and asked him to join their sessions. Tone was affected by Kosugi’s gesture, who seemed to show no regard for Tone’s lack of formal musical training. He joined their group, buying a saxophone from Kosugi and a Sony open reel tape recorder. Mieko Shiomi, Genichi Tsuge, Mikio Tohima and Yumiko Tanno also joined, making Tone the only member not enrolled at Geidai. Mizuno’s house became an important meeting place for the group. The group’s experimental endeavors were further informed by the young ethnomusicologist Fumio Koizumi, who became a part-time faculty member at Geidai in September 1959. As historian William Marotti describes, “The different ‘ethnic’ instruments were each bound to a complex performance tradition outside of a western orchestral frame—and thus provided a variety of rich alternatives to the latter’s conceptual dominance of music with its particular, narrow, and oppressive systematicity.” Tone recounts influence by Noh music, Indian music, Jazz musicians like Ornette Coleman and Eric Dolphy and Kabuki music, among others. According to his own account, Tone saw music as lagging behind the experimentation present in other art forms of the time and therefore providing a rich ground for the transformative capacity of art.

Tone also wrote about the group, first in August of 1960 where he emphasized the role of chance and their endeavoring in “an experiment concerning an absolutely new music.” At this time, the group also decided upon its name as “Group Ongaku,” “ongaku” meaning “music” in Japanese. As Marotti points out, this emphasis on chance was part of Tone&#x27;s and the group’s exploration of a Surrealist-inspired automatism in opposition to artistic egoism. The group’s improvisational approach to collective art making therefore had wider theoretical consequences for the social import of art. Inseparable from this work is its contextualization within the massive protests against the renewal of U.S.-Japan Security treaty (abbreviated as &quot;Anpo&quot;), as seen in their performance from the van of Tone’s family’s business during the Anpo protests.

Among his early influences, Tone has cited Concrete Music, John Cage’s experiments with sound, Jackson Pollock’s action painting, and Art autre/Art informel. A former literature major, Tone became a fixture within the Japanese contemporary art scene. Tone was involved with the Neo Dadaism Organizers group, attending and sometimes participating in their events such as those conducted at Masunobu Yoshimura’s “White House” in Shinjuku, In the early sixties he became involved with the international Fluxus movement. For example, his 1961 score &quot;Anagram for Strings&quot; was published and distributed by George Maciunas’s Fluxus Editions in 1963. This work was Tone’s first graphic score, and it was performed during the first Fluxus festival, a 1962 tour around Europe. Dasha Dekleva describes the score, writing that it “is populated with small white and black circles and dots, and with random whole numbers (positive and negative) along the top and left edges. The realization of the piece involves drawing a line across the score and using basic arithmetic calculations that determine how a series of downward glissando is to be performed.” Among other shorter scores, &quot;Anagram for Strings&quot; was translated to English by Yoko Ono. In another 1961 work, &quot;Days&quot;, Tone recorded himself counting to past one hundred at a low volume. He then played the recording back at a high volume, re-recording it. This process was repeated multiple times until the distortion has completely obscured the sound to unintelligibility. In 1961 Tone also produced &quot;Geodessy For Piano&quot; in which he “experimented with the inevitable indeterminacy of a precise execution of sounds,” according to art historian and curator Alexandra Munroe. In this work, Tone stood elevated on a ladder above an open piano. He then took various handheld objects such as a tennis ball or cork and dropped them one-by-one onto the exposed strings. Tone would also modify the method by ascending or descending the ladder to increase or decrease the distance from which the objects were dropped.

1962 saw a multitude of notable events in Tone’s oeuvre, including his first solo concert “One-man Show by Composer” in February. The concert occurred at the former Minami Gallery space with assisting performers seated on tatami mats on the floor. Compositions performed here include &quot;Anagram&quot;, &quot;Smooth Event&quot;, &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; and &quot;Drastic&quot;, in which the performer took a large amount of laxatives and performed on the drums until they had to use the bathroom. 1962 also saw the Yamanote Line Incident, by Natsuyuki Nakanishi, Jirō Takamatsu and Hiroshi Kawani. Tone and Kosugi also participated, although they performed on a different spot along the circular loop of the Yamanote train line than the other group. Tone and Kosugi were supposed to meet up with the primary group at Ikebukuro, but the primary group ended their performance prematurely when Nakanishi became too nervous to continue. Tone and Kosugi, on the other hand, completed the circuit of the Yamanote line, playing mobile tape players so that the sounds from the tapes and the sounds from around the train lines intermingled.

Tone’s first submission to the progressive Yomiuri Independent Exhibition, an annual exhibition that had become a hotbed of experimental artistic activity and discourse, also occurred in 1962. This submission was titled &quot;Tēpu Rekōdā&quot; (Tape Recorder). The work was initially a reel to reel tape recorder which, after some uncertainty, he painted in hopes of making it a more acceptable submission to the art exhibition. Unhappy with this, he placed this entire tape recorder inside of a big white cloth bag that belonged to Kosugi. The result was an amorphous cloth form that would occasionally produce strange sounds on the thirty to forty minute loop. The following year, the final year of the Yomiuri Independent, Tone produced &quot;Something Happened&quot; (1963). Acquiring the stereotype mold of the Yomiuri newspaper (the exhibition sponsor) published that day, Tone rendered the news in plaster. Other works from this period were more performative, such as &quot;Catch Water Music&quot; (1965), a collaboration with Tatsumi Hijikata, in which Tone threw water from a balcony onto the stage below. Around this time Tone also frequented the events at the Sōgetsu Art Center. It was here that Tone met Nam June Paik, who had been working in Tokyo with Shūya Abe between Summer of 1963 and Spring of 1964.

== Criticism and theory ==
Tone was also a prolific and important writer and theorist of art. In his 1961 “Toward Anti-Music,” for example, he describes a progression in Western music from “musical tone” to “abstract music.” From here is outlines its logical successor as “concrete music” in European musique concrète and American “indeterminate music,” invoking John Cage. He writes, “They focused on concrete sonority (i.e., actual sound of instruments) in a rejection of the abstract musical tone.” In conclusion he notes that while these developments have certainly inspired experimental music in Japan, Japanese artists must not assimilate concrete music as “novel techniques.” “[W]e are making a fresh start after realizing that Japanese ‘avant-garde’ music always appropriated new Western trends only to imitate their techniques,” he declares. The text gives some insight into the aims of his concurrent activities with Group Ongaku activities that Tone and how they might diverge (through an emphasis on group improvisation, for example) from the European precedents of musique concrète and “indeterminate music.” 

Tone’s influence through his writing and theory may also be detected when art historian Reiko Tomii credits him with helping to solidify the term “gendai bijutsu” (contemporary art) to indicate the new idiom of postwar art in Japan as distinct from other terms such as “kindai bijutsu” (modern art) or “zen’ei” (avant-garde). This articulation of a new idiom received textual form in “Chronology: Five Decades of Contemporary Art, 1916-1968” in 1972. For this text, Tone, along with Naoyoshi Hikosaka and Yukio Akatsuka, compiled a history of Japanese contemporary art, published in Bijutsu Techo. Tone was an important friend and influence upon Hikosaka, an important progenitor of conceptualism in Japan. Tone’s role as an influential theorist for young Japanese contemporary artists can be observed in his relationship Hikosaka more generally, to whom he introduced the works of Fluxus and John Cage as well as the philosophy of Edmund Husserl. It was Tone who also suggested that Hikosaka use latex as the material for his important 1970 &quot;Floor Event&quot; piece instead of the conventional art material of plaster, and who assisted in the work by pressing the shutter button on the 35 millimeter camera as Hikosaka brushed the latex over the floor of his home. Tone was one of the five original artists of Hikosaka’s “Bikyōtō Revolution Committee,” a continuation of “Bikyōtō,” a radical, leftist student protest group at Tama Art University.

In 1970 Tone compiled and published a book of his writing titled &quot;Gendai geijutsu no isō&quot;.

== Jury Event: Tone Prize Exhibition ==

Cocurrence [sic] event 1964 Tokyo”

The exhibition was conceived of Tone in response to the closure of the Yomiuri Independent, which was, according to Tomii, “the principle forum of anti-Art” and whose closure “prompted discussion of the dependency of vanguard artists on the corporate-sponsored ‘independent.’” One entry to the Tone Prize Exhibition was Hi-Red Center’s canonical &quot;Cleaning Event&quot; (1964), a work that Tone participated in himself.

== Activity in the United States (1972-Present) ==
In 1972, Tone went to Mills College in Oakland to perform at the event “Repetition and Structure: Works of Yasunao Tone 1961-1964.” What Tone had intended as a trip away from Tokyo, stopping in France, the Bay Area of California and New York, turned into a permanent residence when Tone decided to move to New York during that same trip. 

He was soon asked by David Behrman, director of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, to do some composing for the following year’s season. Tone created a piece for a two-day Cunningham event, &quot;Clockwork Video&quot; (1974), which used a pulley system to put in motion three turntables. The first turned at a rate of one revolution per second, the second one per minute, and the last turntable one per hour. He then placed a video camera on the turn table to capture the interior of the Cunningham Studio, which had a stage on one side and was mirrored on the other. By placing the turn tables by the mirrored side, the footage captures the real space about half of the time while capturing its reflection for the other half. The piece was accompanied by a text Tone wrote, compositing a Michel Foucault text on Gilles Deleuze and Tone’s own essay, “On Looking at Photography” (Shashin o miru koto ni tsuite). A later version of the piece captured a female nude body in three sections: head, torso, and legs. Projections of the respective sections rotated in intervals of one second, one minute and one hour, aligning at the completion of the hour. Tone titled the work &quot;Clockwork Video à la Magritte&quot;.

Another work prominently featured by Cunningham’s dance company was &quot;Geography and Music&quot;, performed from 1979 to 1987. The work was commissioned by the American Dance Festival in Durham for Cunningham’s &quot;Roadrunners&quot;. The piece comprised a text, a notation for two amplified string instruments (derived from the tablature of ninth-century Chinese pipa music, and a gated audio system. The work features the reading of passages from a late 10th century Chinese encyclopedia, describing various foreign places and people.

Around this time, Tone became influenced by the work of East Asian Studies Scholar Shizuoka Shirakawa and his 1970 book &quot;Kanji&quot; in particular. The book ethnographically traces the development of kanji characters. Inspired by Jacques Derrida’s &quot;Of Grammatology&quot;, Tone began a process of translating kanji characters into sound. This would prove to be a rich avenue for Tone’s experimentation in sound seen in works like &quot;Musica Iconologos&quot; and &quot;Musica Simulacra. Musica Iconologos&quot; (1993) converted two poems from the Shih Ching, China’s earliest poetic anthology, into sound. Tone describes the process for producing his album Musica Iconologos as such: “first, the material source of the piece was derived from the poetic text of ancient China and each character of the text was converted into photographic images according to the ancient form of the Chinese characters which are closer to images than the modern form. I scanned the images and digitized them, thus the images were transformed simply into 0’s and 1’s. Then, I obtained histograms from the binary codes and had the computer read the histograms as sound waves; thus I got sound from the images.” For example, “Solar Eclipse in October,” a poem composed of 262 early Chinese characters was turned into half an hour of experimental, chance-driven sound. A similar method was employed for &quot;Musica Simulacra&quot;, debuted in 2003, which took the Man’yoshu collection of poems of the 7th and 8th centuries as its source material. This particular project shows Tone’s multi-disciplinary concern in that it necessitated study of the obscure grammatology of the characters used (and sometimes invented) in the writing of the Man’yoshu anthology. With the original poem in mind, a relationship/pattern can be established between words and sound events. The repetition of a word is highlighted and traceable to an analogue waveform. Tone used these analog patterns, in addition to an artificial three-part structures, in &#x27;Musica Iconologs&#x27; to reduce the listeners awareness off repetition.&lt;/ref&gt; His collaboration with Florian Hecker, &quot;Palimpsest&quot;, also transliterated Japanese Man&#x27;yōshū poems to sound.
As Tone notes, &quot;Musica Iconologos&quot; was developed specifically for the medium of compact disc. He writes, “I had received an offer to publish a CD; however, none of my pieces were suitable for recording. Certain formal elements of the pieces—spatial movement of sound, contrasting acoustic sound with amplified sound, and the use of visuals—made the pieces simply unrecordable. So I had to create something totally devoid of live performance, something that only the CD as a medium could produce.” Because the musician’s hand is removed in &quot;Musica Iconologos&quot;, it can only be played and never performed. The compact disc as a means of dissemination and presentation were therefore integral to the production of the work itself.

Tone began manipulating compact discs to achieve uniquely mangled sounds in 1984. Tone&#x27;s CD-player-based works employ a process of &quot;de-controlling&quot; the device&#x27;s playback so that it randomly selects fragments from a set of sound materials. Tone has stated that the error-correction functionality of modern CD players has made it hard to continue to use this technique and, for this reason, he continues to use older equipment. Tone placed scotch-tape with small perforations on CD-roms of classical and popular music, causing the player to misread and information on the CD. The result was a unpredictable sonic distortion, uniquely generated by Tone’s intervention into the CD player’s specific technological mechanisms. Tone recounts discovering the process in an interview:

“I called my audiophile friend, who owned a Swiss-made CD player, and asked him about it. It was a simpler method than I suspected. I bought a copy of Debussy’s &quot;Preludes&quot; and brought it to my friend’s place. By his engineer friend’s suggestion, we simply made many pinholes on its of Scotch tape and stuck it on the bottom of a CD. I had many trials and errors. I was pleased [with] the result, because the CD player behaved frantically and out of control. [It] was a perfect device for performance.”

In March 1986, Tone performed &quot;Music for 2 CD Players&quot; at the Experimental Intermedia Foundation in New York using this method. According to Tone, Cage sat in the front row and “several minutes after the beginning of the performance he laughed loudly, over and over, until the end.” After finishing the piece, Cage immediately came up to Tone and shook his hand. The technique is also used in his 1997 album, &quot;Solo for Wounded CD&quot;. 

Always active in the United States with avant-garde music artists, he has been awarded a CAPS Grant in multi-media, a 2004 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award, a New York State Council on the Arts commission grant for flutist Barbara Held, a National Endowment for the Arts grant for collaborative work with Blondell Cummings and Senga Nengdi, and a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in performance/emerging forms. Tone has performed at the Kitchen, the Experimental Intermedia Foundation, P.S.1. Guggenheim Museum SOHO, and the Chicago Art Club among other notable venues. He has been included in several institutional group exhibitions at venues such as The Whitney Museum of Art in New York, The Yokohama Triennale 2001 in Yokohama, and the Moderni in the Casselo Museum in Turin. Music festivals featuring Tone include All Tomorrow’s Parties in London, Sonic Light in Amsterdam, and Spectacle Vivante at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. In 1979 he was given the CAPS grant in multi-media and the Ars Electronica Golden Nica Prize in 2002. In 2023 his work was celebrated with a mini-retrospective at Artists Space in New York City that was curated by Danielle A. Jackson.

<doc id="1259283" wikidata="Q1255957" url="?curid=1259283" title="Phelonion">
<text>The phelonion (Greek: , plural, , &quot;phailónia&quot;; Latin: &quot;paenula,&quot; Russian: Фело́нь - Felón’) is a liturgical vestment worn by a priest of the Byzantine Christian tradition. It is worn over the priest&#x27;s other vestments and is equivalent to the chasuble of Western Christianity.

== History ==

Like the chasuble, the phelonion was originally a sort of poncho, a conical round vestment with a hole in the middle for the head, which fell to the feet on all sides. It derived from the Roman civilian &quot;paenula&quot;, and it was made of wool, silk, or linen. Unlike the chasuble, it was worn at all liturgical functions, not only at the celebration of the Mass or Divine Liturgy. It was in use as early as the sixth century for priests, bishops, and also minor orders. It can be seen in the mosaics in Ravenna and the Euphrasian Basilica in Porec. The phelonion is depicted in the Menologion of Basil II, dating to 1000 AD. It shape evolved, and was folded above the elbows to free the arms and hands.

In its present form (dating from about the 15th century) the front is largely cut away (from about the waist down) to facilitate the movements of the priest&#x27;s hands. In Russia the longer front remained common until quite recent times. The use of the phelonion is not limited to the Divine Liturgy but is specified for any major liturgical function. It is also called phenolion (; plural phenolia ) in some books.

=== Polystavrion ===
Originally the bishops wore a phelonion identical to that worn by priests and it could be of any solid color. Starting before the 11th century, a special phelonion, called the &quot;polystavrion&quot; or &quot;polystaurion&quot; (&quot;many crosses&quot;) phelonion developed for certain prelates, and it was made of cloth that was either woven or embroidered with a pattern of multiple crosses. The oldest surviving sources depicting the &quot;polystavrion&quot; as used by bishops are certain manuscripts from the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries. The first author to mention it, Joannes Zonaras, declares its use was allowed not only for the four Orthodox patriarchs (Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem), but also for the exarchs of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, that is the bishops of Caesarea, Ephesus, Thessaloniki, and Corinth. On the other hand, early depictions of the &quot;polystavrion&quot; tend to suggest that it was restricted to patriarchs. The twelfth century canonist Theodore Balsamon deemed it strictly reserved for the patriarch. No polystavrion has survived from the Byzantine period, and it was gradually supplanted by the &quot;sakkos&quot;. In his writings around 1400, Symeon of Thessalonica allows it to be used by all metropolitans. Between the 12th and 15th century, the polystavrion obtained great importance, and is often seen in monumental paintings and frescos.

The polystavrion was the first case of vestement that differentiated the rank of a see. Before, the highest ranking patriarch and a rural bishop would have both worn the plain phelonion with the omophorion. Strict enforcement of who was allowed to wear the polystavrion was exemplified by a 1370 letter from Philotheus I, Patriarch of Constantinople to Aleksei bishop of Novgorod in which he prohibits Aleksei from wearing it, since the right to wear the polystavrion was given to Aleskei&#x27;s predecessor as a personal favor.

The polystavrion was initially developed as a symbol of higher rank, but gradually was extended to all bishops. This phenomenon was later repeated with the sakkos and the mitre, which also started off as worn only by the highest-ranking patriarchs and then trickled down to the rest of the hierarchy.

== Styles ==

There are two main styles of phelonion. Byzantine- or Greek-style phelonia are tailored to fit over the shoulders, while Russian-style phelonia (Фелонь, &quot;felon&quot;) have a high, stiffened collar that covers the back of the head. There is also a shortened phelonion (Фелончик, &quot;felonchik&quot;) that is worn by a reader at his tonsuring. This &quot;small phelonion&quot; is still worn by altar servers in Old Believers churches. The Greek-style phelonion is, generally speaking, worn by those with a historical and geographical closer tie with the Patriarch of Constantinople, which would include most Eastern Orthodox Christians in the Middle East, Greece, the Balkans, Romania, Bulgaria, as well as Greek-Catholics and Orthodox in western Ukraine.

The Russian-style phelonion is used by the Russian Orthodox, Ukrainian Autocephalous, Ukrainian Orthodox (Moscow Patriarchate), Polish Orthodox churches, as well as the Orthodox Church in America. There is also a version used by some Ukrainian and Bulgarian Orthodox which is half-way between the Russian and Greek styles.

A bishop who wishes to serve a Divine Liturgy as a priest (&quot;i.e.&quot;, without the special rites and prayers of the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy) will sometimes vest in a phelonion instead of his sakkos, but with the omophorion around his neck. This is also done in the Liturgy of St. James.

In Oriental Orthodoxy, the phelonion is often only clasped at the neck, and is thus more open than the Byzantine-style, resembling a Western cope. Its various names are &quot;phanolion&quot; (Coptic), &quot;paynā&quot; (Assyrian), &quot;phayno&quot; (Syriac Orthodox), &quot;šurdzar&quot; (Armenian) and &quot;kāppā&quot; (Ethiopian). These are worn by bishops as well as priests (the sakkos is not worn by priests).

<doc id="1259284" wikidata="Q5868912" url="?curid=1259284" title="History of street lighting in the United States">
<text>The history of street lighting in the United States is closely linked to the urbanization of America. Artificial illumination has stimulated commercial activity at night, and has been tied to the country&#x27;s economic development, including major innovations in transportation, particularly the growth in automobile use. In the two and a half centuries before LED lighting emerged as the new &quot;gold standard&quot;, cities and towns across America relied on oil, coal gas, carbon arc, incandescent, and high-intensity gas discharge lamps for street lighting.

== Oil lamp street lighting ==

The earliest street lights in the colonial America were oil lamps burning whale oil from the Greenland or Arctic right whales of the North Atlantic, or from sperm whales of the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and beyond. Lamplighters were responsible for igniting the lamps and maintaining them. As early as the 1750s, inventor Benjamin Franklin of Philadelphia introduced innovations in oil lamp design, such as using two woven wicks to siphon oil from a reservoir, and flat panes of glass which could be easily replaced and were cheaper than blown glass bowls.

In Boston, a citizens&#x27; committee led by John Hancock installed more than 300 oil lamps from England in 1773. The year before, a newspaper editorial had called for a system of public lamps to prevent crime and protect citizens at night. The glass globes were placed on posts ten feet high and spaced fifty feet apart along the street, following the system used in London. These early street lights were &quot;more suggestive than real&quot;; in practice, pedestrians moved from one pool of light to another, walking through shadow in between.

In New York, more than 1,600 oil lamps were in use as city street lights in 1809. The city had started using spermaceti oil, which burned more brightly than candles, in its street lamps from as early as 1792. Philadelphia was close behind during this period, with 1,100 street lamps.

== Gas street lighting ==

Gas lamps gradually started replacing oil street lamps in the United States, beginning in the first quarter of the 19th century. The first street in the world to be illuminated by gaslight was Pall Mall in London, starting in 1807. The first US city to use gas street lights was Baltimore, starting in 1817. In 1816, artist Rembrandt Peale had demonstrated the use of gas lamps to light exhibits at the Peale Museum in Baltimore, displaying what &quot;The Federal Gazette and Daily Advertiser&quot; called &quot;the beautiful and most brilliant light&quot;. The following year, a group of investors formed the Gas Light Company of Baltimore, which was authorized by the municipal government to lay pipes to use coal gas to light public streets.

Although both New York and Philadelphia experimented with gas street lighting around this time, the sophistication of their existing oil-based lighting systems meant that those cities were slower to replace the street lamps they already had with technology that was still unproven. By 1835, New York, Philadelphia, and Boston had also built the requisite infrastructure of piped networks connected to manufacturing gas plants (MGPs) to supply gas light to shopping boulevards, wealthy residential neighborhoods, and major thoroughfares. That year, only 384 of New York City&#x27;s 5,660 street lamps were gaslights. Chicago turned on its first hundred-odd gaslights on September 4, 1850.

Gas light was up to ten times brighter than light from oil lamps, but by present-day standards, the lights appeared &quot;distinctly yellow and not very bright&quot;. In 1841, British author James Silk Buckingham observed that New York City&#x27;s street lights were inadequate: “The lamps are so far apart and so scantily supplied with light that it is impossible to distinguish names or numbers on the doors from carriages or even on foot without ascending the steps.&quot; By 1893, New York City had 26,500 gas street lights and only 1,500 electrical lights.

== Electric street lighting ==
=== Arc lamps ===

The first public demonstration of outdoor electrical lighting in the US was in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 29, 1879. Inventor Charles F. Brush had been perfecting the dynamo arc light, which could produce a glow equivalent to 4,000 candles in a single lamp. For the demonstration, which drew a crowd of thousands, Brush positioned twelve 2,000-candlepower lamps on towers around Cleveland&#x27;s Public Square (then known as Monumental Park), and fully illuminated it with electric light.

The first municipal government to purchase and install the Brush arc lighting system was the city of Wabash, Indiana. On March 31, 1880, Wabash became &quot;the first town in the world generally lighted by electricity,&quot; as four 3,000-candlepower Brush lights suspended from the flagstaff on top of the Wabash County Courthouse were switched on, flooding the neighborhood with light. According to an eyewitness, &quot;The people, almost with bated breath, stood overwhelmed with awe.&quot; The journalist reported that he had been able to read a newspaper, held up to the light, from one street away; from two blocks away, he could still read the headlines; from four blocks away he could make out the advertisements.

Demand for the Brush street lighting system grew quickly, as it provided higher-quality light for one-third the cost of gas lamps. In 1880, Brush conducted a demonstration in New York City, erecting 23 arc lamps along Broadway. As a result, Brush won several city contracts including contracts for lighting Union Square and Madison Square, where towers were erected for the arc lamps. On major thoroughfares such as Broadway, arc lamps were placed on lampposts at 250-foot intervals; by 1886, approximately 30 miles of thoroughfares in New York City were lit by arc lamps. On Fifth Avenue, however, arc lamps were dismantled after residents complained that the wires connecting the fixtures were &quot;unsightly&quot;, and most of the street &quot;returned to the gloom of gas.&quot; By 1893, New York City had 1,535 electric arc street lights.

In New Orleans, arc lamps were used for street lighting starting in 1881. In 1882, the New Orleans Brush Lighting Company installed one hundred 2,000-candlepower arc lamps along five miles of wharf and riverfront; by 1885, New Orleans had 655 arc lights. In Chicago, arc lamps were used in public street lighting starting in 1887. At first, arc lamps were only used on Chicago River bridges, but by 1910, they were used more widely on major Chicago streets.

=== Incandescent lights ===

During the first two decades of the 20th century, there was intense competition among providers of various forms of street lighting, including carbon arc lamps; incandescent lamps; traditional coal gas lamps; and gasoline and naphtha street lamps. Incandescent lamps were initially developed primarily for indoor use, but major technology breakthroughs in 1907 and 1911 perfected the use of tungsten filaments. From 1911 onward, electric incandescent lamps with tungsten filaments became an increasingly popular choice among municipal utilities for public street lighting.

In 1917, Fargo, North Dakota used a floodlight to illuminate an intersection.

By 1917, the number of incandescent filament lamps used in street lighting had reached 1,389,000 across the United States, while the number of arc lamps had started to decline.

In 1919, San Francisco introduced tungsten bulbs on Van Ness Avenue, between Vallejo and Market Street, replacing gas mantles and arc lamps. The city used two 250-candlepower tungsten lamps per column, on sixteen columns for every block. According to &quot;The Electrical Review&quot;: “Under the old system of lighting it was dangerous for a pedestrian to attempt to cross the street because of the heavy automobile traffic. Now the entire street is flooded with evenly distributed light and the appearance of the street as well as the public safety has been greatly enhanced.&quot;

=== Mercury vapor lamps ===

By the mid-20th century, increasing motorization necessitated better illumination, particularly in business districts where there was more mixing of cars and pedestrians, as well as along commercial thoroughfares. Streets needed to be illuminated more evenly, and a minimum level of lighting needed to be maintained throughout the night. Street lighting became a major expense for US cities, which sought to control costs in various ways. From the point of view of a municipal lighting department, the fact that incandescent lamps &quot;radiate with very low efficiency, producing relatively little light at visible wavelengths&quot;, made them less and less attractive for public street lighting.

Mercury vapor streetlights started to be used more widely in the United States after 1950, mainly due to their cost efficiency. By then, the lifespan of mercury vapor lamps had been extended to 16,000 hours, and they could provide up to 40 lumens per watt, whereas incandescent lamps could only deliver 16 to 21 lumens. The first large street installation of mercury vapor lamps in the United States was in Denver, Colorado, on Park Avenue, where they were used together with incandescents. In 1964, nearly 39 percent of street lights in the US were mercury vapor, while incandescents accounted for 60 percent. By 1973, the use of incandescent outdoor lamps was rapidly declining, while the production of mercury vapor lamps soared.

=== Sodium vapor lamps ===

Low-pressure sodium vapor street lights produce a strong monochromatic yellow light, which also reveals more detail to the human eye, even at low levels of luminance. In the 1930s, sodium vapor lamps were not efficient enough to make them a compelling alternative to incandescents. However, because they enhanced visual acuity, they were recommended for safety lighting in tunnels, on bridges, and at &quot;cloverleaf&quot; interchanges on express highways.

In the US, street lights using sodium vapor were first installed on a rural highway near Port Jervis, New York, in 1933. In 1938, a study of sodium vapor light use at selected intersections in Chicago claimed that the new lighting had helped to reduce the number of accidents in those areas. Lamp manufacturers started to promote sodium vapor lamps for &quot;crime fighting&quot;, a marketing strategy that backfired when cities such as Newark and New Orleans rejected sodium vapor, to avoid publicly stigmatizing high-crime neighborhoods.

When the availability of high-pressure sodium vapor lamps coincided with the rise of social unrest in the mid-1960s, lamp manufacturers once again promoted the potential for sodium vapor lighting to enable better street surveillance. High-pressure sodium lamps produced a distinct &quot;yellow/orangeish light&quot;, brighter than mercury vapor light, which has been described as a &quot;harsh metallic blue&quot; in hue. During the OPEC oil embargo, Mayor Richard J. Daley announced a plan to make Chicago &quot;the first large U.S. city to have sodium vapor lamps on all residential streets&quot;, replacing 85,000 mercury vapor streetlights. Although a December 1973 article in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was optimistic about the &quot;more cheerful, brighter, gold-colored vapor lamps&quot;, the newspaper&#x27;s own architecture critic worried about the &quot;eerie, ominous quality of sodium vapor illumination&quot;. In 1976, the large-scale installation of sodium vapor lamps began on Chicago&#x27;s arterial streets.

In the end, the most critical factor in favor of sodium vapor lamps was their cost. In 1980, the annual operating cost for the average incandescent lamp was $280; for mercury vapor lamps, it was $128; and for low-pressure sodium vapor lamps, it was $60 a year. Meanwhile, high-pressure sodium vapor lamps cost only $44 a year to operate, with a standard life expectancy of 15,000 hours, which also helped to lower labor and maintenance costs. According to the Edison Tech Center, sodium vapor lamps are &quot;the most ubiquitous lamp for street lighting on the planet.&quot;

=== Light emitting diodes ===

In recent years, efforts to make street lighting more energy efficient have focused on using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to replace high-pressure mercury (HPM), metal halide (MH), and high-pressure sodium (HPS) luminaires. LEDs also produce a whiter light, and can be installed as part of a centrally managed system with further energy saving controls, such as part-night lighting and dimming. Although the up-front costs of installing LED fixtures is significant, municipalities switching to LED street lighting generally expect to recoup their investment through reductions in ongoing electricity and maintenance costs. Many of the early projects in the United States also benefitted from economic stimulus block grants.

In 2007, the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, announced plans to become &quot;the first US city to convert all of its downtown streetlights to LED technology.&quot; The city replaced 120-watt bulbs which lasted only two years with 56-watt LEDs that would last a decade, and expected to reduce its public lighting energy use by half. However, for the first two years, DTE Energy continued to bill Ann Arbor at the same rate as before, because the street lights were not metered, and electricity charges were estimated based on past use. Under the direction of the state utility regulator, DTE Energy eventually revised its rates for Ann Arbor based on the expected energy use for &quot;experimental lighting technology&quot;, and credited the city retroactive to the installation. As of January 2011, the city of Ann Arbor had switched 1,400 of its 7,000 streetlight fixtures to LEDs, and saved approximately $200,000, including reduced maintenance costs.

== Other electric light generation methods ==

=== Towers ===
Many cities across the United States experimented with tall tower structures to deliver light to entire city neighborhoods, similar to the arc lamp installation at the Wabash County Courthouse in Indiana. In 1802, Benjamin Henfry erected an oil-based &quot;thermolamp&quot; on a tall column in Richmond, Virginia, which failed to cast as much light as he had hoped for. In Washington, DC, city planners considered using the Washington Monument as a tower platform for lighting, but rejected the idea after placing test lamps on the Smithsonian Institution and United States Capitol buildings.

Municipalities that adopted tower lighting or &quot;moontowers&quot; for a period included Akron, Aurora, Austin, Buffalo, Chattanooga, Denver, Detroit, Elgin, Evansville, Fort Wayne, Hannibal, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Louisville, Minneapolis, Mobile, San Francisco, and San Jose. Most of these cities erected only one or two towers, before falling back on traditional lamppost lighting. One exception was Los Angeles, which erected 36 towers, fifteen of which were 150-feet tall and equipped with three 3,000-candlepower arc lamps each. Another exception was Detroit, which attempted to use 122 towers to illuminate 21 square miles of the city. Although the tower lighting in Detroit provided &quot;uniform carpets of light&quot;, it was ineffective in providing sufficient lighting for high-traffic areas and routes. After five years, Detroit began to dismantle its towers.

As of October 2021, the only lighting towers that remain in the United States are in Austin, Texas. The city of Austin purchased 31 of Detroit&#x27;s used moonlight towers in 1894. Seventeen of those towers, erected in Austin in 1895, continue to function as working lighting towers today.

=== Induction lighting ===
In 2009, PSE&amp;G in New Jersey became the first utility in the US to use induction fluorescent lamps to replace mercury vapor lamps, in 220 municipalities. The induction lamps were expected to last 100,000 hours before requiring maintenance and consume 30 to 40 percent less electricity, thereby saving an estimated $1 million annually. The induction lamps also provide a whiter light, and contain less mercury.

Following extensive field tests, the City of San Diego decided in 2010 to replace 10,000 of its high-pressure sodium (HPS) streetlights with cobra-head induction luminaires. Astronomers from the nearby Palomar Observatory had objected to replacing the HPS lamps with light sources with higher color temperatures, which would increase light pollution and interfere with their research. One of the key findings of the field assessment was that LED luminaires became more expensive and less efficient at lower color temperatures. The City of San Diego has standardized on induction lighting for street lights, but uses low-pressure sodium (LPS) lamps within a 30-mile radius of the observatory.

== &quot;Urban Light&quot; ==
&quot;Urban Light&quot; at the entrance to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) Center, Los Angeles, is an assemblage of historical street lights taken from actual usage in Southern California in the form of a 2008 sculpture by Chris Burden.

<doc id="1259289" wikidata="Q1361894" url="?curid=1259289" title="Scout sign and salute">
<text>The three-finger salute is used by members of Scout and guide organizations around the world when greeting other Scouts and in respect of a national flag at ceremonies. In most situations, the salute is made with the right hand, palm face out, the thumb holding down the little finger. There are some variations of the salute between national Scouting organizations and also within some programme sections.

A &quot;half-salute&quot;, known as the Scout sign, is also used in certain situations. The hand is still held palm facing out, and the thumb holding the little finger, but the hand is held at the shoulder instead. Other organizations with historical ties to Scouting such as Scouts Royale Brotherhood and Alpha Phi Omega use it as well.

== Meaning of the three fingers ==
In his book, &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, Robert Baden-Powell chose the three-finger salute for Scouts to represent the three aspects of the Scout Promise:
# Honour God and Country
# Help Others
# Obey the Scout Law

=== Cub Scouts&#x27; two-finger salute ===
Cub Scout sections can use a two-finger salute, depending on the national Scouting organization they belong to. This is done to represent the two rules of the original Cub Scout / Wolf Cub law. The salute is performed with the right hand.

In &quot;The Wolf Cub&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, Baden-Powell wrote: &quot;Why two fingers? Well, you know what a Wolf&#x27;s head looks like with two ears cocked up. It is used as the badge of the Wolf Cub. Your two fingers in the salute are the two ears of the Wolf.&quot;

== Salute or sign? ==
Originally, Baden-Powell intended for Scouts to salute each other in greeting when they first saw each other for the first time using the &quot;secret sign&quot;, or half-salute. This was regardless of whether the Scouts knew each other or not. Officers, such as Patrol Leaders, Scoutmasters, or members of the armed forces, were to be saluted with a full-salute.

Full-salutes were also required at the hoisting of the Union Flag, the playing of the national anthem, or at funerals.

== By country ==

=== Canada ===
In Scouts Canada the salute is rendered vertically, palm out similar to British Army/Commonwealth salutes, except if the member is a Sea Scout where it is palm in/angled down (traditionally, to hide your &#x27;dirty hands&#x27; from the ship&#x27;s captain). Beaver Scouts in Canada use a variant of the two-fingered sign with the fingers bent forwards forming &quot;teeth&quot;. When they move up to Cub Scouts part of the ceremony sometimes includes a Scouter straightening the fingers to change from the Beaver to Cub sign.

=== Switzerland, Belgium and Germany ===
The half-salute is used by Swiss Scouts when shaking (left) hands with other Scouts or leaders on greeting or parting.

Additional meaning of the thumb holding down the little finger as explained in Switzerland and Germany: the big and strong protects the weak and little.

To greet each other, German-speaking Scouts often say &#x27;Gut Pfad&#x27;, which can literally be translated to &#x27;Good Path&#x27;. This comes from the German term for &#x27;scout&#x27;, which is &#x27;Pfadfinder&#x27;.

=== United Kingdom ===
The Scout Association uses the three-fingered Scout sign for all sections, including Cub Scouts. The two-fingered Cub salute was abandoned by the Scout Association following a recommendation by the Advance Party Report in 1966, that &quot;there should be only one salute for the whole Movement&quot;.
The Scout sign is used while making or reaffirming the Beaver Scout, Cub Scout or Scout Promise and at no other time. The Scout salute is the same but held to the forehead rather than vertically, and is used to salute the Union Flag, section/group colours, or at funerals or the National Anthem. The Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association uses both the three and two fingered salutes. Girlguiding only uses the guide sign (half salute), though historically the full salute was used.

=== United States ===
==== Outdoor Service Guides (formerly Baden Powell Service Association) ====
As a member of WFIS and part of the international Traditional Scouting movement. the Scout sign and salute differs by section in the OSG-US. The Timberwolf (cub) section uses the two-finger (spread) salute, and the two finger Scout salute as defined in the 1938 PO&amp;R, while the Pathfinder (scout) and Rovers use the traditional three-finger sign and salute.

==== Boy Scouts of America ====
Cub Scouts use the two finger Scout sign and salute—the sign is presented with the fingers apart to represent the ears of Akela the wolf. Scouts BSA, Venturers and Sea Scouts use the three finger sign and salute. The Scout sign is performed with the upper arm parallel to the ground and the forearm vertical, forming a right angle at the elbow. The Scout sign is used when reciting any of the ideals of the BSA such as the Scout Oath and Scout Law. It is also used to gain the attention of the group.

The salute is rendered in the American style with the palm in and is only used to salute the flag of the United States. Early BSA protocol required Scouts to salute each other, but this was discontinued in 1972.

==== Girl Scouts of the USA ====
As a member of WAGGGS, the Girl Scouts of the USA use the three-fingered sign at shoulder height. The three fingers represent the person&#x27;s own spiritual beliefs, other people and the Girl Scout Law. This differs from the 1913 version where the first finger represented God and Country.

== Worldwide ==
All World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts members share the three fingered sign, with the palm facing out held at shoulder height, elbow by the side and the thumb holding the little finger. This is used in numerous situations of respect including when making or reciting the Promise, receiving awards, honouring a flag, honouring the dead and meeting other Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. In the latter case, it may be used in conjunction with the left handshake.

<text>In anatomy, Luschka&#x27;s joints (also called uncovertebral joints, neurocentral joints) are formed between uncinate process or &quot;uncus&quot; below and uncovertebral articulation above. They are located in the cervical region of the vertebral column from C3 to C7. Two lips project upward from the superior surface of the vertebral body below, and one projects downward from the inferior surface of vertebral body above. They allow for flexion and extension and limit lateral flexion in the cervical spine.

Pathological processes that can occur in these joints include degenerative changes or hypertrophic arthritis, resulting in foraminal stenosis and nerve compression. Foraminal stenosis at this joint is the most common cause of cervical nerve root pressure.

They were characterized by Hubert von Luschka in 1858.

<text>A head-mounted display (HMD) is a display device, worn on the head or as part of a helmet (see helmet-mounted display for aviation applications), that has a small display optic in front of one (monocular HMD) or each eye (binocular HMD). HMDs have many uses including gaming, aviation, engineering, and medicine.

Virtual reality headsets are a type of HMD that track 3D position and rotation to provide a virtual environment to the user. 3DOF VR headsets typically use an IMU for tracking. 6DOF VR headsets typically use sensor fusion from multiple data sources including at least one IMU.

An optical head-mounted display (OHMD) is a wearable display that can reflect projected images and allows a user to see through it.

== Overview ==
A typical HMD has one or two small displays, with lenses and semi-transparent mirrors embedded in eyeglasses (also termed data glasses), a visor, or a helmet. The display units are miniaturized and may include cathode-ray tubes (CRT), liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), liquid crystal on silicon (LCos), or organic light-emitting diodes (OLED). Some vendors employ multiple micro-displays to increase total resolution and field of view.

HMDs differ in whether they can display only computer-generated imagery (CGI), or only live imagery from the physical world, or combination. Most HMDs can display only a computer-generated image, sometimes referred to as virtual image. Some HMDs can allow a CGI to be superimposed on real-world view. This is sometimes referred to as augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (MR). Combining real-world view with CGI can be done by projecting the CGI through a partially reflective mirror and viewing the real world directly. This method is often called optical see-through. Combining real-world view with CGI can also be done electronically by accepting video from a camera and mixing it electronically with CGI.

By using AR technology, the HMDs are allowed to achieve a see-through display. By using virtual reality (VR) technology, the HMDs can realize viewing the images in 360 degrees.

== Optical HMD ==
An optical head-mounted display uses an optical mixer which is made of partly silvered mirrors. It can reflect artificial images, and let real images cross the lens, and let a user look through it. Various methods have existed for see-through HMD&#x27;s, most of which can be summarized into two main families based on curved mirrors or waveguides. Curved mirrors have been used by Laster Technologies, and by Vuzix in their Star 1200 product. Various waveguide methods have existed for years. These include diffraction optics, holographic optics, polarized optics, and reflective optics.

== Applications ==
Major HMD applications include military, government (fire, police, etc.), and civilian-commercial (medicine, video gaming, sports, etc.).

=== Aviation and tactical, ground ===

In 1962, Hughes Aircraft Company revealed the Electrocular, a compact CRT (7&quot; long), head-mounted monocular display that reflected a TV signal in to transparent eyepiece. Ruggedized HMDs are increasingly being integrated into the cockpits of modern helicopters and fighter aircraft. These are usually fully integrated with the pilot&#x27;s flying helmet and may include protective visors, night vision devices, and displays of other symbology.

Military, police, and firefighters use HMDs to display tactical information such as maps or thermal imaging data while viewing a real scene. Recent applications have included the use of HMD for paratroopers. In 2005, the Liteye HMD was introduced for ground combat troops as a rugged, waterproof lightweight display that clips into a standard U.S. PVS-14 military helmet mount. The self-contained color monocular organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display replaces the NVG tube and connects to a mobile computing device. The LE has see-through ability and can be used as a standard HMD or for augmented reality applications. The design is optimized to provide high definition data under all lighting conditions, in covered or see-through modes of operation. The LE has a low power consumption, operating on four AA batteries for 35 hours or receiving power via standard Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) continues to fund research in augmented reality HMDs as part of the Persistent Close Air Support (PCAS) Program. Vuzix is currently working on a system for PCAS that will use holographic waveguides to produce see-through augmented reality glasses that are only a few millimeters thick.

=== Engineering ===
Engineers and scientists use HMDs to provide stereoscopic views of computer-aided design (CAD) schematics. Virtual reality, when applied to engineering and design, is a key factor in integration of the human in the design. By enabling engineers to interact with their designs in full life-size scale, products can be validated for issues that may not have been visible until physical prototyping. The use of HMDs for VR is seen as supplemental to the conventional use of CAVE for VR simulation. HMDs are predominantly used for single-person interaction with the design, while CAVEs allow for more collaborative virtual reality sessions.

Head Mounted Display systems are also used in the maintenance of complex systems, as they can give a technician a simulated x-ray vision by combining computer graphics such as system diagrams and imagery with the technician&#x27;s natural vision (augmented or modified reality).

=== Medicine and research === 
There are also applications in surgery, wherein a combination of radiographic data (X-ray computed tomography (CAT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging) is combined with the surgeon&#x27;s natural view of the operation, and anesthesia, where the patient vital signs are within the anesthesiologist&#x27;s field of view at all times.

Research universities often use HMDs to conduct studies related to vision, balance, cognition and neuroscience. As of 2010, the use of predictive visual tracking measurement to identify mild traumatic brain injury was being studied. In visual tracking tests, a HMD unit with eye tracking ability shows an object moving in a regular pattern. People without brain injury are able to track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory.

=== Gaming and video ===
Low-cost HMD devices are available for use with 3D games and entertainment applications. One of the first commercially available HMDs was the Forte VFX1 which was announced at Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 1994. The VFX-1 had stereoscopic displays, 3-axis head-tracking, and stereo headphones. Another pioneer in this field was Sony, which released the Glasstron in 1997. It had as an optional accessory a positional sensor which permitted the user to view the surroundings, with the perspective moving as the head moved, providing a deep sense of immersion. One novel application of this technology was in the game &quot;MechWarrior 2&quot;, which permitted users of the Sony Glasstron or Virtual I/O&#x27;s iGlasses to adopt a new visual perspective from inside the cockpit of the craft, using their own eyes as visual and seeing the battlefield through their craft&#x27;s own cockpit.

Many brands of video glasses can be connected to modern video and DSLR cameras, making them applicable as a new age monitor. As a result of the glasses ability to block out ambient light, filmmakers and photographers are able to see clearer presentations of their live images.

The Oculus Rift is a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display created by Palmer Luckey that the company Oculus VR developed for virtual reality simulations and video games. The HTC Vive is a virtual reality head-mounted display. The headset is produced by a collaboration between Valve and HTC, with its defining feature being precision room-scale tracking, and high-precision motion controllers. The PlayStation VR is a virtual reality headset for gaming consoles, dedicated for the PlayStation 4. Windows Mixed Reality is a platform developed by Microsoft which includes a wide range of headsets produced by HP, Samsung, and others and is capable of playing most HTC Vive games. It uses only inside-out tracking for its controllers.

=== Virtual cinema ===
Some head-mounted displays are designed to present traditional video and film content in a virtual cinema. These devices typically feature a relatively narrow field of view (FOV) of 50–60°, making them less immersive than virtual-reality headsets, but they offer correspondingly higher resolution in terms of pixels per degree. Released in 2011, the Sony HMZ-T1 featured 1280x720 resolution per eye. In approximately 2015, standalone Android 5 (Lollipop) based &quot;private cinema&quot; products were released using various brands such as VRWorld, Magicsee, based on software from Nibiru.

Products released as of 2020 featuring 1920×1080 resolution per eye included the Goovis G2 and Royole Moon. Also available was the Avegant Glyph, which incorporated 720P retinal projection per eye, and the Cinera Prime, which featured 2560×1440 resolution per eye as well as a 66° FOV. The rather large Cinera Prime used either a standard support arm or an optional head mount. Expected to be available in late-2021 was the Cinera Edge, featuring the same FOV and 2560×1440 resolution per eye as the earlier Cinera Prime model, but with a much more compact form factor. Other products available in 2021 were the Cinemizer OLED, with 870×500 resolution per eye, the VISIONHMD Bigeyes H1, with 1280x720 resolution per eye, and the Dream Glass 4K, with 1920x1080 resolution per eye. All of the products mentioned here incorporated audio headphones or earphones except for the Goovis G2, the Cinera Prime, the VISIONHMD Bigeyes H1, and the Dream Glass 4K, which instead offered an audio headphones jack.

=== Remote control ===

First-person view (FPV) drone flying uses head-mounted displays which are commonly called &quot;FPV goggles&quot;. Analog FPV goggles (such as the ones produced by Fat Shark) are commonly used for drone racing as they offer the lowest video latency. But digital FPV goggles (such as produced by DJI) are becoming increasingly popular due to their higher resolution video.

Since 2010s, FPV drone flying is widely used in aerial cinematography and aerial photography.

=== Sports ===
A HMD system has been developed for Formula One drivers by Kopin Corp. and the BMW Group. The HMD displays critical race data while allowing the driver to continue focusing on the track as pit crews control the data and messages sent to their drivers through two-way radio. Recon Instruments released on 3 November 2011 two head-mounted displays for ski goggles, MOD and MOD Live, the latter based on an Android operating system.

=== Training and simulation ===
A key application for HMDs is training and simulation, allowing to virtually place a trainee in a situation that is either too expensive or too dangerous to replicate in real-life. Training with HMDs covers a wide range of applications from driving, welding and spray painting, flight and vehicle simulators, dismounted soldier training, medical procedure training, and more. However, a number of unwanted symptoms have been caused by prolonged use of certain types of head-mounted displays, and these issues must be resolved before optimal training and simulation is feasible.

== Performance parameters ==
* Ability to show stereoscopic imagery. A binocular HMD has the potential to display a different image to each eye. This can be used to show stereoscopic images. It should be borne in mind that so-called &#x27;Optical Infinity&#x27; is generally taken by flight surgeons and display experts as about 9 meters. This is the distance at which, given the average human eye rangefinder &quot;baseline&quot; (distance between the eyes or Interpupillary distance (IPD)) of between 2.5 and 3 inches (6 and 8 cm), the angle of an object at that distance becomes essentially the same from each eye. At smaller ranges the perspective from each eye is significantly different and the expense of generating two different visual channels through the computer-generated imagery (CGI) system becomes worthwhile.
* Interpupillary distance (IPD). This is the distance between the two eyes, measured at the pupils, and is important in designing head-mounted displays.
* Field of view (FOV) – Humans have an FOV of around 180°, but most HMDs offer far less than this. Typically, a greater field of view results in a greater sense of immersion and better situational awareness. Most people do not have a good feel for what a particular quoted FOV would look like (e.g., 25°) so often manufacturers will quote an apparent screen size. Most people sit about 60 cm away from their monitors and have quite a good feel about screen sizes at that distance. To convert the manufacturer&#x27;s apparent screen size to a desktop monitor position, divide the screen size by the distance in feet, then multiply by 2. Consumer-level HMDs typically offer a FOV of about 110°.
* Resolution – HMDs usually mention either the total number of pixels or the number of pixels per degree. Listing the total number of pixels (e.g., 1600×1200 pixels per eye) is borrowed from how the specifications of computer monitors are presented. However, the pixel density, usually specified in pixels per degree or in arcminutes per pixel, is also used to determine visual acuity. 60 pixels/° (1 arcmin/pixel) is usually referred to as eye limiting resolution, above which increased resolution is not noticed by people with normal vision. HMDs typically offer 10 to 20 pixels/°, though advances in micro-displays help increase this number.
* Binocular overlap – measures the area that is common to both eyes. Binocular overlap is the basis for the sense of depth and stereo, allowing humans to sense which objects are near and which objects are far. Humans have a binocular overlap of about 100° (50° to the left of the nose and 50° to the right). The larger the binocular overlap offered by an HMD, the greater the sense of stereo. Overlap is sometimes specified in degrees (e.g., 74°) or as a percentage indicating how much of the visual field of each eye is common to the other eye.
* Accommodation support – HMDs that support matching the accommodation and vergence distances of the eyes are more comfortable than those that do not.
* Distant focus (collimation). Optical methods may be used to present the images at a distant focus, which seems to improve the realism of images that in the real world would be at a distance.
* On-board processing and operating system. Some HMD vendors offer on-board operating systems such as Android, allowing applications to run locally on the HMD, and eliminating the need to be tethered to an external device to generate video. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;smart goggles&quot;. To make the HMD construction lighter producers may move the processing system to connected smart necklace form-factor that would also offer the additional benefit of larger battery pack. Such solution would allow to design lite HMD with sufficient energy supply for dual video inputs or higher frequency time-based multiplexing (see below).

== Support of 3D video formats ==

Depth perception inside an HMD requires different images for the left and right eyes. There are multiple ways to provide these separate images:
* Use dual video inputs, thereby providing a completely separate video signal to each eye
* Time-based multiplexing. Methods such as frame sequential combine two separate video signals into one signal by alternating the left and right images in successive frames.
* Side by side or top-bottom multiplexing. This method allocated half of the image to the left eye and the other half of the image to the right eye.

The advantage of dual video inputs is that it provides the maximum resolution for each image and the maximum frame rate for each eye. The disadvantage of dual video inputs is that it requires separate video outputs and cables from the device generating the content.

Time-based multiplexing preserves the full resolution per each image, but reduces the frame rate by half. For example, if the signal is presented at 60 Hz, each eye is receiving just 30 Hz updates. This may become an issue with accurately presenting fast-moving images.

Side-by-side and top-bottom multiplexing provide full-rate updates to each eye, but reduce the resolution presented to each eye. Many 3D broadcasts, such as ESPN, chose to provide side-by-side 3D which saves the need to allocate extra transmission bandwidth and is more suitable to fast-paced sports action relative to time-based multiplexing methods.

Not all HMDs provide depth perception. Some lower-end modules are essentially bi-ocular devices where both eyes are presented with the same image. 3D video players sometimes allow maximum compatibility with HMDs by providing the user with a choice of the 3D format to be used.

== Peripherals ==
* The most rudimentary HMDs simply project an image or symbology on a wearer&#x27;s visor or reticle. The image is not bound to the real world, i.e., the image does not change based on the wearer&#x27;s head position.
* More sophisticated HMDs incorporate a positioning system that tracks the wearer&#x27;s head position and angle, so that the picture or symbol displayed is congruent with the outside world using see-through imagery.
* Head tracking – Binding the imagery. Head-mounted displays may also be used with tracking sensors that detect changes of angle and orientation. When such data is available in the system computer, it can be used to generate the appropriate computer-generated imagery (CGI) for the angle-of-look at the particular time. This allows the user to &quot;look around&quot; a virtual reality environment simply by moving the head without the need for a separate controller to change the angle of the imagery. In radio-based systems (compared to wires), the wearer may move about within the tracking limits of the system.
* Eye tracking – Eye trackers measure the point of gaze, allowing a computer to sense where the user is looking. This information is useful in a variety of contexts such as user interface navigation: By sensing the user&#x27;s gaze, a computer can change the information displayed on a screen, bring added details to attention, etc.
* Hand tracking – tracking hand movement from the perspective of the HMD allows natural interaction with content and a convenient game-play mechanism

<doc id="1259297" wikidata="Q50969" url="?curid=1259297" title="Onegin (1999 film)">
<text>Onegin is a 1999 British-American romantic drama film based on Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s 1833 novel in verse &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. It was co-produced by British and American companies and shot mostly in the United Kingdom. &quot;Onegin&quot; is Martha Fiennes&#x27; directorial debut and stars her brother Ralph Fiennes in the role of Yevgeny (Eugene) Onegin, Liv Tyler as Tatiana and Toby Stephens as Lensky. Two other Fiennes siblings were involved in the project: Magnus Fiennes wrote the music and Sophie Fiennes appeared in a minor role.

==Plot==
In early 19th century Russia, a bored St. Petersburg socialite named Onegin inherits his uncle&#x27;s estate in the country. There, he meets a neighbouring landowner and aspiring poet, Lensky, and a widowed mother and her two daughters. The poet is engaged to the elder daughter Olga. Her sister, Tatiana (Tanya), writes Onegin a passionate love letter but he turns her down because of her youth and inexperience. He instead dances with her sister, which the jealous Lensky interprets as flirtation, and challenges his friend to a duel. The duel is arranged to take place in a secluded place by a local lake, and unknown to the participants, Tatiana secretly witnesses the duel from a safe distance. She observes Lensky taking the first shot and missing, followed by Onegin taking careful aim and disposing of Lensky with a shot to his opponent&#x27;s head.

Onegin departs from his country estate. Six years later, he returns to St. Petersburg, and encounters Tanya, the woman he spurned, who is now a woman of refinement and married to his cousin Prince Nikitin. Onegin immediately sees Tanya as desirable, and falls in love with her. He begs her forgiveness for his past behaviour. Tanya refuses Onegin, explaining to him that he has missed his chance with her; she will be faithful to her husband. He receives her rejection with despair.

==Cast==
==Reception==
&quot;Onegin&quot; received mixed reviews. 

It received praise for its production values and performances, but criticism was leveled at the pacing and writing. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said, &quot;There is a cool, mannered elegance to the picture that I like, but it&#x27;s dead at its center. There is no feeling that real feelings are at risk here.&quot; Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;An earnest but worthwhile attempt to render the Russian writer&#x27;s tragic and romantic verse novel of 1833 for the screen... we are estranged from the distinctively comic savour of the original. But there still remains much that is worthwhile in this high-minded adaptation.&quot; On the more positive side though, Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;&quot;Onegin&quot; may not appeal to more cynical viewers unprepared to take the emotional leap of faith the movie demands&quot;.

===Awards===
Martha Fiennes received the Best Director Award at the Tokyo Film Festival and the London Film Critics Circle&#x27;s award for Best Newcomer. &quot;Onegin&quot; was also nominated for Best British Film at the British Academy Film Awards and Liv Tyler received the Golden Aries prize for Best Foreign Actress from the Russian Guild of Film Critics.

<text>Canada Water is an area of Rotherhithe in the Docklands of south-east London. It is named after a freshwater lake and wildlife refuge. Canada Water tube, Overground and bus station is immediately north of the lake, along with Canada Water Library which overhangs the lake and Deal Porter Square. Surrey Quays Shopping Centre is also adjacent, sitting immediately to the south. The surrounding area, which forms the town centre of Rotherhithe, is now increasingly known as Canada Water, after the transport interchange as much as the lake itself.

==History and development==

The lake is named after the former Canada Dock, of which Canada Water is the surviving northern third, and which was mainly used by ships from Canada. As with much of the Docklands, the Surrey Commercial Docks closed in the 1970s. During the 1980s, the London Docklands Development Corporation took over, and invested heavily in the redevelopment of the area. About half of Canada Dock was infilled and the Surrey Quays Shopping Centre built on top of it; the remainder was converted into the present lake and wildlife refuge. An ornamental canal, Albion Channel, was created (through the site of the now filled-in Albion Dock) linking Canada Water to Surrey Water, with the spoil used to create Stave Hill in nearby Russia Dock Woodland.

Following the earlier gentrification of the parts of Rotherhithe along the river, the extension of the Jubilee line in 1999 moved the focus to the area immediately around Canada Water. The opening of the new Canada Water Underground station gave the area rapid connections to the rest of London, with Canary Wharf one stop, Westminster less than 10 minutes, and Bond Street around 15 minutes away by underground train. The station&#x27;s connection to the London Overground network in 2010 added a quick connection to the City of London, with a journey of around 10 minutes to Shoreditch High Street station, near Liverpool Street Station.

The area has since been further developed, with additional residential developments, a library which opened in November 2011, and plans to redevelop the shopping mall in a first step towards creating a more traditional town centre. In 2018, architect Allies and Morrison submitted a masterplan for area&#x27;s continued development, but some of the plans for tall buildings were revised after Historic England said the proposals would harm views of capital landmarks. Approved by Southwark Council in 2020, the masterplan was revised in 2025 to increase the height of some buildings due to fire safety requirements for second staircases. The masterplan covers a former printworks, the shopping and leisure centre, the dock offices and the former Rotherhithe police station, with tall buildings playing &quot;a significant role in transforming Canada Water into a new town centre&quot;. The whole masterplan was expected to take about 15 years to deliver.

==Freshwater lake==
Canada Water is the only body of fresh water in London Docklands. The lake is now kept topped up with fresh water using a windpump. This arrangement was put in place following research by the landscape architect Fraser Borwick, which revealed that ground water had historically been extracted to supply various industrial processes using wind power. After checking the borehole results of the Jubilee line construction team, it was established that large amounts of potable water were available, and a borehole 80 metres long was sunk into the ground. The borehole is lined for 60 metres, and the bottom 20 metres is into chalk. The investigation of how best to keep the lake topped up with fresh water was the result of some damage to the lining of the old dock during construction works in the 1980s. Another solution considered involved securing a water supply from the flooded tunnels of London Underground, but this was considered too risky.

<doc id="1259318" wikidata="Q1603273" url="?curid=1259318" title="Helmholtz coil">
<text>A Helmholtz coil is a device for producing a region of nearly uniform magnetic field, named after the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. It consists of two electromagnets on the same axis, carrying an equal electric current in the same direction. Besides creating magnetic fields, Helmholtz coils are also used in scientific apparatus to cancel external magnetic fields, such as the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

== Description ==
A Helmholtz pair consists of two identical circular magnetic coils that are placed symmetrically along a common axis, one on each side of the experimental area, and separated by a distance formula_1 equal to the radius formula_2 of the coil. Each coil carries an equal electric current in the same direction.

Setting formula_3, which is what defines a Helmholtz pair, minimizes the nonuniformity of the field at the center of the coils, in the sense of setting formula_4 (meaning that the first nonzero derivative is formula_5 as explained below), but leaves about 7% variation in field strength between the center and the planes of the coils.
A slightly larger value of formula_1 reduces the difference in field between the center and the planes of the coils, at the expense of worsening the field&#x27;s uniformity in the region near the center, as measured by formula_7.

In some applications, a Helmholtz coil is used to cancel out the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, producing a region with a magnetic field intensity much closer to zero.

== Mathematics ==

The calculation of the exact magnetic field at any point in space is mathematically complex and involves the study of Bessel functions. Things are simpler along the axis of the coil-pair, and it is convenient to think about the Taylor series expansion of the field strength as a function of formula_8, the distance from the central point of the coil-pair along the axis.
By symmetry, the odd-order terms in the expansion are zero. By arranging the coils so that the origin formula_9 is an inflection point for the field strength due to each coil separately, one can guarantee that the order formula_10 term is also zero, and hence the leading non-constant term is of order formula_11. The inflection point for a simple coil is located along the coil axis at a distance formula_12 from its centre. Thus the locations for the two coils are formula_13.

The calculation detailed below gives the exact value of the magnetic field at the center point. If the radius is &quot;R&quot;, the number of turns in each coil is &quot;n&quot; and the current through the coils is &quot;I&quot;, then the magnetic field B at the midpoint between the coils will be given by

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the permeability of free space .

=== Derivation ===

Start with the formula for the on-axis field due to a single wire loop which is itself derived from the Biot–Savart law:

:formula_16

Here

:formula_17 = the permeability constant = formula_18

:formula_19 = coil current, in amperes,
:formula_20 = coil radius, in meters,
:formula_21 = coil distance, on axis, to point, in meters,
:formula_22is the distance dependent, dimensionless coefficient.

The Helmholtz coils consists of &quot;n&quot; turns of wire, so the equivalent current in a one-turn coil is &quot;n&quot; times the current &quot;I&quot; in the &quot;n&quot;-turn coil. Substituting &quot;nI&quot; for &quot;I&quot; in the above formula gives the field for an &quot;n&quot;-turn coil:

:formula_23

For formula_24, the distance coefficient formula_25can be expanded in Taylor series as:formula_26In a Helmholtz pair, the two coils are located at formula_13, so the B-field strength at any formula_8 would be:

:formula_29
The points near the center (halfway between the two coils) have formula_24, and the Taylor series of formula_31 is:formula_32.

== Time-varying magnetic field ==
Most Helmholtz coils use DC (direct) current to produce a static magnetic field. Many applications and experiments require a time-varying magnetic field. These applications include magnetic field susceptibility tests, scientific experiments, and biomedical studies (the interaction between magnetic field and living tissue). The required magnetic fields are usually either pulse or continuous sinewave. The magnetic field frequency range can be anywhere from near DC (0 Hz) to many kilohertz or even megahertz (MHz). An AC Helmholtz coil driver is needed to generate the required time-varying magnetic field. The waveform amplifier driver must be able to output high AC current to produce the magnetic field.

=== Driver voltage and current ===
formula_33

Use the above equation in the mathematics section to calculate the coil current for a desired magnetic field, .

where formula_15 is the permeability of free space or formula_18

formula_19 = coil current, in amperes,

formula_20 = coil radius, in meters,

n = number of turns in each coil. 
Then calculate the required Helmholtz coil driver amplifier voltage:

:formula_38

where
* is the peak current, 
* is the angular frequency or , 
* and are the inductances of the two Helmholtz coils, and
* and are the resistances of the two coils.

=== High-frequency series resonant ===
Generating a static magnetic field is relatively easy; the strength of the field is proportional to the current. Generating a high-frequency magnetic field is more challenging. The coils are inductors, and their impedance increases proportionally with frequency. To provide the same field intensity at twice the frequency requires twice the voltage across the coil. Instead of directly driving the coil with a high voltage, a series resonant circuit may be used to provide the high voltage. A series capacitor is added in series with the coils. The capacitance is chosen to resonate the coil at the desired frequency. Only the coils parasitic resistance remains. This method only works at frequencies close to the resonant frequency; to generate the field at other frequencies requires different capacitors. The Helmholtz coil resonant frequency, formula_39, and capacitor value, C, are given below.

:formula_40
:formula_41

==Anti-Helmholtz coil==
When the pair of two electromagnets of a Helmholtz coil carry an equal electric current in the opposite direction, it is known as anti-Helmholtz coil, which creates a region of nearly uniform magnetic field gradient, and is used for creating magnetic traps for atomic physics experiments.

In an anti-Helmholtz pair, the B-field strength at any formula_8 would be:
:formula_43
The points near the center (halfway between the two coils) have formula_24, and the Taylor series of formula_45 is:formula_46.

==Maxwell coils==
To improve the uniformity of the field in the space inside the coils, additional coils can be added around the outside. James Clerk Maxwell showed in 1873 that a third larger-diameter coil located midway between the two Helmholtz coils with the coil distance increased from coil radius formula_2 to formula_48 can reduce the variance of the field on the axis to zero up to the sixth derivative of position. This is sometimes called a Maxwell coil.

At one time this was the 11th to the largest corporation on the Fortune 500.

He is currently the minority owner of the Iowa Wild hockey team, and is the vice chairman and minority owner of the Houston Texans, where he chaired Houston&#x27;s 2004 Super Bowl host committee.

Watson was inducted into the Texas Business Hall of Fame and was named &quot;Master Entrepreneur&quot; by Ernst &amp; Young. In 2005, Watson was named Chairman of the Sigma Chi Foundation.

Watson has served on the Boards of the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA), Natural Gas Supply Association (NGSA), Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA), Edison Electric Institute (EEI), Natural Gas Council (NGC) and is currently on the boards of Baker Hughes, Baylor College of Medicine, Mainstream Renewable Power, Shona Energy Company, Patman Drilling Inc., Central Houston Inc., and Angeleno Group. In 1996 Watson co-founded Caldwell Watson Real Estate Group and was a Principal. He is the chairman of Wincrest Ventures, a venture capital company he founded in 1994. He has been a Director of Theatre Under the Stars and Hobby Center for the Performing Arts. Watson is a Member of the Executive Committee of Edison Electric Institute as well as a founding Member of the Natural Gas Council. Partners at one point with Fritz Strayer.

Mr. Watson is also chairman and CEO of Advanced Blast Protection Systems (ABPS), a company that developed new technology to greatly increase the protection tools available to those dealing with blast, fire and ballistic assaults.

He is now chairman of the board and co-founder of Twin Eagle Resource Management (founded in September 2010), a Houston-based company that provides wholesale energy and midstream services throughout North America.

Watson is also the former owner of the Houston Aeros minor league hockey team (now the Iowa Wild).

<text>Bruce Williamson is an American energy company executive. He is best known as a former chief executive office (CEO) for global markets of North Carolina-based Duke Energy and CEO of Houston-based Dynegy.

Williamson was born in Great Falls, Montana to George and June Williamson, and graduated from Great Falls High School in 1977. He spent his freshman year of college at the University of Idaho, transferred to the University of Montana-Missoula, and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in finance in 1981. After discovering that the only employment he could get in Montana was a $10,000-a-year bank job, he took a position with Shell Oil in Houston, Texas, largely because a friend lived there. He later obtained a Master of Business Administration from the University of Houston.

Williamson left Shell to work for Pan Energy Corporation. Pan Energy merged with the Duke Power Company in 1997 to become Duke Energy. Williamson rose to the position of President and CEO of Duke Energy Global Markets. In 2002, he was named president and chief executive officer of Dynegy. As the CEO of Dynegy, Williamson received an award from the President&#x27;s White Collar Task Force. Further, the former United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, Michael Shelby, stated that Williamson becoming CEO, &quot;has changed the standard operating procedures in such a way that honesty and candor [are] part of the business plan,&quot; and Williamson &quot;helped ferret out potential wrongdoers.&quot; As the CEO of Dynegy, Williamson restructured Dynegy out of bankruptcy, and reduced Dynegy&#x27;s outstanding debt by over $10 billion. Williamson resigned as CEO of Dynegy on February 10, 2011, after two takeovers over the company (both of which he supported) failed. In 2012, Dynegy filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy to settle with creditors who held around $2.5 Billion in claims over one of its subsidiaries.

In July 2011, Williamson was named president and CEO of Cleco Corporation, a utility holding company based in Louisiana. In his first year as CEO, he finalized the largest wholesale contract ever entered into for the Cleco Corporation by securing a 10-year contract with Dixie Electric Membership Corporation. In December 2013, Cleco Corp. transitioned into the Midcontinent Independent System Operator Market, with the hope that this will provide additional growth opportunities. Operationally, Cleco has improved its employee safety since Williamson joined the company. Comparing results from 2012 to 2011, Cleco reduced personal injuries by 33 percent and its avoidable accidents by 45 percent. Comparing results from 2012 to 2013, Cleco again improved its employee safety record by 20 percent and its avoidable accidents by 40 percent. Also, since Williamson joined Cleco, the company has raised shareholder dividends five times for a total increase of sixty percent.

In 2014, Macquarie Group agreed to buy Cleco Corporation for approximately $3.4 billion in cash attracted by the steady, long-term returns of regulated power assets. 

Williamson previously served on the board of directors for Questar Corporation (gas company) and for Southcross Energy. Williamson currently serves on the board of directors for ENMAX. Williamson is also on the University of Houston Dean&#x27;s Advisory Board for the CT Bauer College of Business and the Chancellor&#x27;s National Advisory Council.

Williamson and his wife, Kim, live in the Woodlands, TX and have two daughters.

<doc id="1259351" wikidata="Q391788" url="?curid=1259351" title="Bed sheet">
<text>A bed sheet is a rectangular piece of cloth used either singly or in a pair as bedding, which is larger in length and width than a mattress, and which is placed immediately above a mattress or bed, but below blankets and other bedding (such as comforters and bedspreads). A bottom sheet is laid above the mattress, and may be either a flat sheet or a fitted sheet (a sheet which has been sewn with elastic or a drawstring along the hem of the top, sides and bottom of the sheet to prevent it from slipping off the mattress). A top sheet, in the many countries where they are used, is a flat sheet, which is placed above a bottom sheet and below other bedding.

==History==
The term &quot;bed sheet&quot; was first used in the 15th century. Bed sheets were traditionally white and made of cotton, linen or silk, however, now various colors and patterns are used.

==Styles==

Bed sheets come in two main varieties: flat and fitted. A flat sheet is simply a rectangular sheet of cloth, while a has four corners, and sometimes two or four sides, fitted with elastic, to be used only as a bottom sheet. The fitted sheet may also be secured using a drawstring instead of elastic. The purpose of a fitted bottom sheet is to keep it from slipping off the mattress while the bed is in use. A particular way of folding and tucking while making the bed, known as &quot;hospital corners,&quot; is sometimes used when the bottom sheet is flat rather than fitted.

Usually a flat bed sheet is overlocked around the edges to form four seams. One of the seams is wider than the other three and helps with orienting the sheet correctly on the mattress. The wider seam goes at the head end of the mattress. Sometimes the sides do not have seams, but are finished with the selvedge only. When one makes a bed, the patterned or monogrammed side of the top sheet may be placed facing up, or facing down, in which case the top edge may be folded towards the foot of the bed to expose the design.

In the US and Canada, sheets are often sold in a four-piece set consisting of a fitted sheet, a flat sheet and two pillowcases. In China, a four-piece set consists of a duvet cover, two pillowcases and either a fitted or flat sheet. Fitted sheets are gaining popularity due to their ease of use. Use of good quality elastic make fitted sheets durable.

==Materials==

Cotton and cotton blends dominate the market, the most common blend being cotton/polyester. Cotton provides absorbency and a soft hand, while polyester adds durability and wrinkle resistance. Other common fibers used in the manufacturing of bed sheets include linen, silk, Modal and bamboo rayon, lyocell, Microtex or Microfiber, and polypropylene. Polypropylene (olefin) is a hypoallergenic spun-bound material produced at a low cost and typically used in emergency shelters or hospitals as disposable sheeting.

Cooling sheets are made of Lyocell, bamboo (rayon), linen, hemp or silk.

==Construction==
The quality of bed sheets is often conveyed by the thread count—the number of threads per square inch of material. In general, the higher the thread count, the softer the sheet, but the weave and type of thread may affect the &quot;hand&quot; of the material so that a sheet with a lower thread count may actually be softer than one with a higher count. Yarn quality also plays a part in the look and feel of sheets, as finer yarns tend to create a finer sheet fabric. The ply also plays a role in how heavy the sheet feels. Ply represents how many fibers are twisted together as the sheet is being created. A 2 ply 300 thread count sheet will feel heavier than a single ply 600 thread count sheet. 
The most common constructions are muslin, percale, sateen, flannel, and knitted jersey. In a plain weave the warp and weft cross each other one at a time. Sateen has multiple (usually 3–4) over threads and one under.

== Cleaning ==
Bedsheets should be washed about once a week, using low-temperature water and drying settings. Warm water can be used to eliminate coffee stains, urine or allergens, such as dust mites. Using fabric softeners is not recommended, as they leave behind residue that decreases the fabric&#x27;s breathability.

<text>Don Francis Bowman &quot;Sugarcane&quot; Harris (June 18, 1938 – November 30, 1999) was an American blues and rock and roll violinist and guitarist. He is considered a pioneer in the amplification of the violin.

==Career==
Harris was born and raised in Pasadena, California, United States. His parents were carnival entertainers. As a youth, he studied classical violin, and learned additional instruments including harmonica, piano and guitar.

Harris began performing with a doo-wop group, The Squires, which included his childhood friend, the pianist Dewey Terry. The Squires recorded for Vita Records. Harris performed in Little Richard&#x27;s band in the 1960s.

===Don &amp; Dewey ===
Harris and Terry formed a duo in 1956 as Don and Dewey. They were recorded by Art Rupe on his Specialty label, mostly utilizing the services of the drummer Earl Palmer. The duo also recorded on Rupe&#x27;s other labels, Los Angeles Spot and Shade. Don &amp; Dewey had no hits as an act, but several songs they co-wrote and recorded became early rock and roll classics for other musicians. These include &quot;Farmer John&quot; (the Premiers and, later, Neil Young), &quot;Justine&quot; (the Righteous Brothers), &quot;I&#x27;m Leaving It Up to You&quot; (Dale and Grace), and &quot;Big Boy Pete&quot; (the Olympics). Harris was given the nickname &quot;Sugarcane&quot; by bandleader Johnny Otis, due to his reputation as a .

===Frank Zappa and John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers ===
After separating from Dewey Terry in the 1960s, Harris moved almost exclusively over to the electric violin. He reappeared as a sideman with John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers and Frank Zappa, most recognized for his appearances on &quot;Hot Rats&quot; and on the Mothers of Invention albums &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; and &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot;. His lead vocal and blues violin solo on a cover of Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Directly from My Heart to You&quot; on &quot;Weasels&quot;, and his extended solo on &quot;Little House I Used To Live In&quot; on &quot;Weeny&quot; are considered highlights of those albums. Zappa, who had long admired Harris&#x27; playing, reportedly bailed him out of jail, resurrecting his career and ushering in a long period of creativity for the forgotten violin virtuoso. He played a couple of live concerts with Zappa&#x27;s band in 1970, and performed on four of Zappa&#x27;s solo albums.

===Pure Food and Drug Act ===
During the early 1970s, Harris led the Pure Food and Drug Act, which included drummer Paul Lagos, guitarists Harvey Mandel and Randy Resnick, and bassist Victor Conte, who was the founder of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative. Conte replaced Larry Taylor, who was the original bass player. Conte went on to play with Tower of Power and Herbie Hancock. In their first concert, PFDA opened for Johnny Otis at El Monte Legion Hall. The audience was excited by Sugarcane&#x27;s energy, his playing, singing and stage antics. While the performance showed the promise of the group, Harris&#x27;s issues with controlled substances was a constant struggle, eventually contributing to his death.

In the 1980s, Sugarcane was a member of the Los Angeles–based experimental rock band, Tupelo Chain Sex.

==Personal life and death==
Harris&#x27; marriage ended in divorce. He had a daughter and two sons. He was addicted to drugs throughout his career. For most of his later years, he had pulmonary disease. He died on November 27, 1999, at home in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 61.

<text>John David Gibson (born July 25, 1946) is an American radio talk show host. As of September 2008, he hosts the syndicated radio program &quot;The John Gibson Show&quot;. He formerly co-hosted the weekday edition of &quot;The Big Story&quot; on Fox News.

==Career==

Gibson earned a Bacherlor of Arts degree from UCLA&#x27;s School of Theater, Film and Television. He began his reporting career with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; (1969–1972) and worked for Atlantic Records (1972–1974). Gibson worked for KFWB-AM (1974–1975) and KEYT-TV (1975–1977). At KCRA, he was a feature reporter on the &quot;Weeknight&quot; magazine show (1977–1979) and San Francisco bureau chief (1979–1989).

Beginning in 1992, Gibson worked as an NBC News correspondent in Burbank, California. In 1994, he became the first West Coast correspondent for the NBC News Channel. He covered the 1995 O. J. Simpson trial for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman for NBC News Channel and &quot;Rivera Live&quot; on CNBC. In 1996, he was named as daytime anchor on MSNBC, where he covered the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998.

Gibson joined the Fox News Channel in September 2000 as the host of the rolling news program &quot;Fox News Live with John Gibson&quot;, which, in 2001, was turned into &quot;The Big Story&quot;. In 2007, Heather Nauert joined &quot;The Big Story&quot; as his co-host. He also wrote the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling books, &quot;Hating America: The New World Sport&quot; and &quot;The War on Christmas&quot; (referencing the controversies of the same name).

On March 12, 2008, Fox News Channel announced that &quot;The Big Story&quot; was being replaced with &quot;America&#x27;s Election Headquarters&quot;, a program more directly geared toward following the 2008 U.S. presidential election. &quot;The Big Story&quot; was not renewed after the election and was replaced with &quot;The Glenn Beck Program&quot; in January 2009. Following this cancellation, Gibson was a regular guest-panelist on Fox&#x27;s late-night satire show &quot;Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld&quot;, and was often the butt of jokes on episodes in which he was absent.

As of September 2008, he began hosting the syndicated radio program &quot;The John Gibson Show&quot;. Initially the show was broadcast on Fox News Radio, but since 2017 it has been syndicated by the Genesis Communications Network.

== Gibson vs. the BBC ==
In 2004 Gibson said that the British Broadcasting Corporation was anti-American, accusing the BBC of having &quot;a frothing-at-the-mouth anti-Americanism that was obsessive, irrational and dishonest&quot;. He also claimed that reporter Andrew Gilligan, who was covering the 2003 Iraq War for BBC Radio 4 in Baghdad, had, &quot;insisted on air that the Iraqi Army was heroically repulsing an incompetent American military&quot;.

Gibson&#x27;s criticisms were rejected by UK regulator Ofcom when it investigated viewer complaints about his item. Ofcom also found that Gibson&#x27;s broadcast was in violation of several UK television regulations, concluding that Gibson&#x27;s commentary did not display a &quot;respect for truth&quot;, failed to offer the BBC a chance to respond to the allegations, and was based on &quot;false evidence.&quot;

==Public comments==
Gibson as a commentator often attracts criticism.

Following the 2007 SuccessTech Academy shooting, on his radio show, Gibson commented, &quot;I knew the shooter was white. I knew he would have shot himself. Hip-hoppers don&#x27;t do that. They shoot and move on to shoot again. And I could tell right away because he killed himself. Hip hoppers shooters don&#x27;t do that. They shoot and move on.&quot;

In a 2008 edition of his radio show, Gibson commented on actor Heath Ledger&#x27;s death the day before. He opened the segment with funeral music and played a clip of Jake Gyllenhaal&#x27;s famous line &quot;I wish I knew how to quit you&quot; from Ledger&#x27;s film &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;; and then said &quot;Well, I guess he found out how to quit &quot;you&quot;.&quot; Among other remarks, Gibson called Ledger a &quot;weirdo&quot; with &quot;a serious drug problem&quot;. The next day, he addressed outcry over his remarks by saying that they were in the context of jokes he had been making for months about &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, and that &quot;There&#x27;s no point in passing up a good joke.&quot; Gibson later apologized on his television and radio shows.

In February 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder had given a speech to Justice Department employees as a part of the observance of Black History Month during which he described the United States as being a &quot;nation of cowards&quot; in its reluctance to discuss racial relations. Gibson criticized Holder&#x27;s remarks as inappropriate. John Sanders, who at the time was technology reporter for WBAL-TV in Baltimore, then intentionally edited Gibson&#x27;s remarks which had followed news reports of a monkey who had escaped from a Seattle zoo, making it appear that Gibson had compared Holder to a monkey &quot;with a bright blue scrotum&quot; on Fox. Sanders then posted the altered video on YouTube without a disclaimer that it was a joke. Because of this, the video was widely publicized on news websites, including &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, as if it were authentic. Sanders was fired over the video, and Gibson said that the spread of the fake video has had a &quot;personal&quot; impact upon him.

<doc id="1259364" wikidata="Q617835" url="?curid=1259364" title="Malaspina Glacier">
<text>The Malaspina Glacier () in southeastern Alaska is the largest piedmont glacier in the world. Situated at the head of the Alaska Panhandle, it is about wide and long, with an area of some , approximately the same size as the state of Rhode Island.
==Name==
The Lingít name translates to Big Glacier. The colonial name for the glacier is in honor of Alessandro Malaspina, a Tuscan explorer in the service of the Spanish Navy, who visited the region in 1791. In 1874, W. H. Dall of the United States Coast Survey bestowed the name &quot;Malaspina Plateau&quot; on it, not realizing its true geological character.

==Geography==
The Malaspina Glacier actually comprises Seward Glacier, Agassiz Glacier, and Marvine/Hayden Glacier, which converge as they spill out from the Saint Elias Mountains onto the coastal plain facing the Gulf of Alaska between Icy Bay and Yakutat Bay. Officially, these three glaciers are classified independently, such that Malaspina Glacier does not technically exist. The three glaciers are almost always referred to together, though sometimes only the largest primary piedmont lobe is referred to as Malaspina Glacier. This notable feature is actually part of Seward Glacier, with Agassiz Glacier contributing the secondary piedmont lobe to the west, and Marvine/Hayden Glacier constituting the smallest and most eastern lobe. Although the glaciers fill the plain, nowhere do they actually reach the water and so do not qualify as a tidewater glaciers. Notably, both Seward Glacier and Marvine/Hayden Glaciers terminate near Malaspina Lake, formed during a previous advance. Neither glacier actually terminates in the lake, and therefore are also not classified as lacustrine glaciers.

The Malaspina is up to thick in places, with the elevation of its bottom being estimated to be as much as below sea level. There are two lakes on its margins: Oily Lake to the northwest, at the foot of the Samovar Hills between the Agassiz and Seward glaciers, and Malaspina Lake to the southeast, close to Yakutat Bay.

Nearly all of the glacier is encompassed by the southeast lobe of the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.
==History==
Radar data and aerial photographs dating back to 1972 provide evidence that the Malaspina-Seward glacier system lost about of its thickness between 1980 and 2000; because the glacier is so large, that amount of shrinkage was sufficient to contribute 0.5% of the rise in the global sea level.

In October 1969, the glacier became a National Natural Landmark.

Olaru retired after the 2000 Olympics, noting that the new Code of Points would not be suited to gymnasts of her height, and enrolled as a student at the West University of Timișoara. After graduation she continued her studies, and she became an assistant professor at the Faculty of Sports and Physical Education of the West University of Timișoara.

In 2016, Olaru published her autobiography, &quot;The Price of Gold. Uncomfortable Sincerity&quot;. In it, she recounted how she and her Romanian teammates were hit and beaten by their coaches during training.

<doc id="1259368" wikidata="Q1640570" url="?curid=1259368" title="Net asset value">
<text>Net asset value (NAV) is the value of an entity&#x27;s assets minus the value of its liabilities, often in relation to open-end, mutual funds, hedge funds, and venture capital funds. Shares of such funds registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are usually bought and redeemed at their net asset value. It is also a key figure with regard to hedge funds and venture capital funds when calculating the value of the underlying investments in these funds by investors. This may also be the same as the book value or the equity value of a business. Net asset value may represent the value of the total equity, or it may be divided by the number of shares outstanding held by investors, thereby representing the net asset value &quot;per share&quot;.

==Overview==
Net asset value and other accounting and recordkeeping activities are the result of the process of fund accounting (also known as securities accounting, investment accounting, and portfolio accounting). Fund accounting systems are sophisticated computerized systems used to account for investor capital flows in and out of a fund, purchases and sales of investments, and related investment income, gains, losses and operating expenses of the fund. The fund&#x27;s investments and other assets are valued regularly; daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the fund and associated regulatory or sponsor requirements. There is no universal method or basis of valuing assets and liabilities for the purposes of calculating the net asset value used throughout the world, and the criteria used for the valuation will depend upon the circumstances, the purposes of the valuation, and any regulatory and/or accounting principles that may apply. For example, for U.S.-registered open-ended funds, investments are commonly valued each day the New York Stock Exchange is open, using closing prices (meant to represent fair value), typically 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. For U.S.-registered money market funds, investments are often carried or valued at &quot;amortized cost&quot; as opposed to market value for expedience and other purposes, provided various requirements are continually met. The Securities and Exchange Board of India issued a notice on 17th September 2020 stating that when purchasing mutual fund units before 1:00 PM the NAV from the day of realization (day when investment money reaches the AMC) will be applicable irrespective of the size of investment.

At the completion of the valuation process and once all other appropriate accounting entries are posted, the accounting books are &quot;closed&quot;, enabling a variety of information to be calculated and produced including the net asset value per share.

==Open-ended funds==
Net asset value is commonly used in the context of open-end funds. Shares and interests in such funds are not traded between investors, but are issued by the fund to each new investor and redeemed by the fund when an investor withdraws. A fund will issue and redeem shares and interests at a price calculated by reference to the NAV of the fund, with the intention that new investors receive a fair proportion of the fund and redeeming investors receive a fair proportion of the fund&#x27;s value in cash.

For example, if a fund has a NAV of $200 million and 1 million shares in issue on a certain day, the &quot;NAV per share&quot;—the price at which shares are issued—is $200. A person investing $40 million on that day will therefore be given 200,000 shares. Immediately following their investment the total NAV of the fund will be $240 million, as the new investor&#x27;s cash becomes part of the fund and is available for investment by the fund. The investor will then be entitled to 1/6 of whatever the fund&#x27;s value is when they withdraw their investment, if in the meantime their 1/6 ownership is not altered by any further withdrawals or investments to the fund.

The valuation of the assets and liabilities of an open-ended fund is therefore very important to investors. If the NAV in the above example had, with the same assets, been calculated as $160 million (and the NAV per share as $160), the investor would have been given 250,000 shares and would become entitled to 1/5 of the fund&#x27;s value.

In contrast, closed-end funds are traded in the open market between investors, bought and sold at market prices and not based on NAV. So the price of shares or interests in a closed-end fund will be whatever the parties agree it to be, which may not correspond to the fund&#x27;s NAV. Publicly traded shares in such funds generally trade at a price below NAV.

==Mismarking==

Mismarking in securities valuation takes place when the value that is assigned to securities does not reflect what the securities are actually worth, due to intentional fraudulent mispricing. Mismarking misleads investors and fund executives about how much the securities in a securities portfolio managed by a trader are worth (the securities&#x27; net asset value) and thus misrepresents performance. When a rogue trader engages in mismarking, it allows them to obtain a higher bonus from the financial firm for which they work, where their bonus is calculated by the performance of the securities portfolio that they are managing.

==Valuation of assets in open-ended funds and hedge funds==
The NAV of a collective investment scheme (such as a U.S. mutual fund or a hedge fund) is calculated by reference to the total value of the fund&#x27;s portfolio (its assets) less its accrued liabilities (money owed to lending banks, fees owed to investment managers and service providers, and other liabilities).
Calculation of the net asset value for a hedge fund, including the calculation of the fund&#x27;s income and expense accruals and the pricing of securities at current market value, is a core fund administrator task, because it is the price at which investors buy and sell shares in the fund. The accurate and timely calculation of NAV by the administrator is vital.

In 2003, investors in Lancer Group sued hedge fund administrator Citco for allegedly knowingly disseminating &quot;misleading&quot; Net Asset Value (NAV) statements. Citco ultimately informed investors that it was resigning as administrator to Lancer&#x27;s funds, but did not provide an explanation. While Citco pointed to the fact that it had sought statements from Lancer&#x27;s board of directors as to the propriety of the valuations, Southern District of NY Judge Shira Scheindlin wrote: &quot;Although these actions demonstrate Citco Group&#x27;s questioning of the numbers, they could also be interpreted as Citco Group&#x27;s efforts to shield its own involvement in the process&quot;. Ultimately, Citco settled with investors.

The case of &quot;Anwar v. Fairfield Greenwich&quot; (SDNY) is the major case relating to fund administrator liability for failure to handle its NAV-related obligations properly. The defendants settled in 2016 by paying the &quot;Anwar&quot; plaintiffs $235 million. The court held in the case, prior to the settlement, that &quot;it is reasonable to infer from Plaintiffs&#x27; allegations that the Administrators were aware that Plaintiffs would—and did—rely on their statements of the Funds&#x27; NAVs that were sent to the investors... Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs allege a relationship between the investors and the Administrators that gives rise to a duty of care ...&quot;

==Businesses==
Turning to operating companies as opposed to investment companies (mutual funds), in determining whether shares in a public company are a cheap or expensive investment, one tool used by investors is a comparison of the company&#x27;s current market capitalization (being the price at which the market values the company) with its NAV. The NAV may be below the market price for the following reasons:

* Accounting principles and bases of presentation of amounts in financial statements differ worldwide, blurring the comparability of companies in various jurisdictions. Financial statement values are typically recorded based on their local jurisdiction&#x27;s related principles of accounting, which affect all the remaining points below.
* The current value of a company&#x27;s assets likely differ from the historical cost reflected in the financial statements used in NAV calculations.
* The NAV describes the company&#x27;s current asset and liability position. Investors might believe that the company has significant growth prospects, in which case they would be prepared to pay more for the company than its NAV.
* Certain assets, such as goodwill (which broadly represents a company&#x27;s ability to make future profits), are not necessarily included on a balance sheet and so will not appear in an NAV calculation.

A company&#x27;s market value will not always be greater than its NAV. For example, analysts and management estimated that Liberty Media Corporation was trading for 30-50% below its net asset value (or &quot;core asset value&quot;) in June 2007. Where a company&#x27;s market value is lower than its NAV, it may be considered more profitable to wind the company down and sell off its assets individually rather than continue to run it as a going concern.

In contrast to fund valuation, the assets of a company will generally be valued for the purpose of a NAV calculation using the book value, the historical cost, or the amortised cost of the company&#x27;s assets, or an appropriate combination of the three.

==Real estate investment trusts==
NAV is one of the valuation indices of real estate investment trusts (REITs, pronounced &quot;Reets&quot;). NAV is normally quoted &quot;per investment unit&quot; where the value is divided by the number of total outstanding investment units. In simple terms, NAV is an adjusted net asset value reflecting the market values of real estate properties held by an investment corporation. The degree of premium/discount on individual investment unit prices relative to the per-unit NAV serves as the yardstick for assessment. The NAV index is synonymous to the adjusted price-to-book ratio in which factors such as unrealized losses/gains of owned properties and brand values are reflected. News companies such as PropertyMall typically report on a REIT&#x27;s NAV when the company reports it.

==Variable insurance and variable annuity contracts==
Variable universal life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts often are structured somewhat similarly to mutual funds, and they may vary in value as securities and markets fluctuate. Typically, these insurance or annuity products issue &quot;units&quot; of ownership to policyholders/annuitants in exchange for their investment—similar to shares of a mutual fund. Also similar to a fund, the assets, liabilities, and net assets of these product entities are valued periodically, resulting in an asset unit value or AUV or UAV per share, which is similar to NAV for a fund.

<doc id="1259375" wikidata="Q6482294" url="?curid=1259375" title="Lamorinda">
<text>Lamorinda is an area within Contra Costa County, California in the United States. The name is a portmanteau derived from the three cities that make up the region: [[Lamorinda|La]]fayette, [[Lamorinda|Mor]]aga and Or[[Lamorinda|inda]]. 

Lamorinda is located east of the Berkeley Hills, between the Caldecott Tunnel and Walnut Creek. It is often referred to as the &quot;Highway 24&quot; corridor, referring to the state highway that is the primary thoroughfare in the region. Many residents commute west through the tunnel to San Francisco and Oakland or east to Walnut Creek and Concord.

As of 2010, the three cities had a combined population of 57,552, with Lafayette having the largest population and Moraga the smallest.

==Differences among the three cities==
Each city in Lamorinda is distinct, but they share many similarities, such as suburban bedroom communities with limited industry. The region has been described as &quot;wealthy&quot; by the San Francisco Chronicle.
The public high schools in each of the cities are part of the Acalanes Union High School District, one of the highest-ranked high school districts in California.

With a cluster of restaurants and generally high-end shops in its downtown, Lafayette is considered the retail hub of the region. Orinda is home to the historic Orinda Theatre and the California Shakespeare Theater. Moraga is home to Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California.

===Transportation===
Lafayette and Orinda are located along Highway 24, with the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) running in the highway medians and stations at both and . Line 6 of the Contra Costa County Connection runs through the three cities. Moraga, located to the south, is more isolated with only a pair of two-lane roads connecting it to Orinda and Lafayette as well as to Highway 24 to the north. Additionally, internal roads link Moraga to downtown Walnut Creek, while another set of two-lane roads connects it to Oakland hills and Castro Valley. 

==Central county==

Lamorinda is located in the western part of Contra Costa County, California. The central part of the county is a valley traversed by Interstate 680 and Highway 24. The towns to the east of the hills, situated on or near Highway 24 and their surrounding areas (Lafayette, Moraga and Orinda) are collectively known as &quot;Lamorinda&quot;. The major central county cities along Interstate 680 include Martinez, Concord, Pleasant Hill, Walnut Creek, Danville, San Ramon, and unincorporated Alamo.

<text>Robert Christopher Nankeville, known professionally as Bobby Davro (born 13 September 1958), is an English actor and comedian.

He made his television debut in 1981 followed by breakthrough in &quot;Live from Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot; (1983); this was followed by appearances on the television show &quot;Copy Cats&quot;.

Between 2007 and 2008, Davro played Vinnie Monks in the BBC One soap &quot;EastEnders&quot;. He participated in &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; in 2010, and took part in &quot;Your Face Sounds Familiar&quot; in 2013. Over the years he has appeared many times in pantomime.

==Career==
Davro appeared on a variety of television shows, mostly with ITV, throughout the 1980s and 1990s. His popularity was at its highest during the mid-1980s with his own Saturday night ITV shows, &quot;Bobby Davro on the Box&quot;, &quot;Bobby Davro&#x27;s TV Annual&quot; and &quot;Bobby Davro&#x27;s TV Weekly&quot;. He also made appearances on the popular comedy impressions sketch show &quot;Copy Cats&quot;. While he went on to make two more shows with Television South for ITV – &quot;Davro&#x27;s Sketch Pad&quot; and &quot;Davro&quot; in 1990 – by this time the comedian&#x27;s brand of humour was proving to be less popular with audiences, and ratings for his shows declined.

The 1990s saw Davro switching channels to the BBC, appearing on television shows such as &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot;. During the filming of &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot; he suffered whiplash for several weeks after being placed in a pillory which, not being secured vertically, toppled over projecting him face-first onto the studio&#x27;s concrete floor. Reflecting on the incident, Davro said, &quot;the doctors were amazed I hadn’t suffered more badly. I didn’t break my nose or any teeth, which was a minor miracle&quot;. This incident was not televised but was used in a BBC safety video, and &quot;Inside No.9&quot;″s Halloween special of 2018, &quot;Dead Line&quot;.

On the short-lived show &quot;Rock with Laughter&quot;, Davro made another attempt at the comedy sketch-show format that had proved so successful for him in the 1980s. He replaced John Eccleston as co-presenter on the game show &quot;Run the Risk&quot; with Peter Simon: this featured on the BBC&#x27;s Saturday morning children&#x27;s show &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot;. Davro returned to UK TV screens in May 1997 as host of Yorkshire Television&#x27;s &quot;Winner Takes All&quot; for 65 episodes; this was produced for Challenge TV.

In 2015 Davro appeared at the King&#x27;s Head Theatre, Islington as ping-pong-playing London cab driver Eric in a revival of Simon Block&#x27;s comedy &quot;Not a Game for Boys&quot;. The play was directed by Jason Lawson. The production was well-received, with Danny Coleman-Cooke of the British Theatre website commenting: &quot;Davro is brilliant as the sexist, bitter captain from hell Eric. Davro really captures the tragedy of the character and his quest for escapism, especially in the scene where Eric admits that his 45 minutes a week at the table is the only time in life that he feels truly happy. The funnyman has clearly not lost his comic timing but the depth and emotion of his performance here may well surprise some of his fans and critics alike.&quot;

In December 2015, Davro announced a 20-date UK tour for the following year, starting at the Epsom Playhouse on 17 May 2016. On 6 February 2015, he was a guest of Graham Norton on his weekly BBC Radio 2 show.

===Live performances===
*In 2005, Davro appeared in Birmingham as an act for &quot;Jasper Carrott&#x27;s Rock With Laughter&quot;, alongside performers such as Bill Bailey, Jasper Carrott, Lenny Henry, Bonnie Tyler, Tammy Palmer and the &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; troupe.
*In 2005 and 2006, he performed on stage in &quot;Aladdin&quot; with Melinda Messenger and John Rhys Davies in Woking, Surrey.
*Davro performed in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; at the Orchard Theatre in Dartford in 2010 and 2011.
*In 2011, he performed at the Derngate Theatre, Northampton, in &quot;Aladdin&quot;.
*In 2012, he returned to the Derngate Theatre in a production of &quot;Cinderella&quot; alongside Denise Welch.
*In 2013, he co-starred in the pantomime of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; at the Theatre Royal Plymouth alongside Lee Mead and Nigel Havers.
*In February 2016, Davro appeared in a free gig at The Railway Inn, Billingshurst, as headline on their monthly Joke Club night.
*In March and April 2016 he appeared as Scarecrow in the pantomime &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; at Dorking Halls, Dorking.
* In 2017, he appeared at the Southend Cliffs Pavilion as Silly Billy in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;
* Muddles in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; at Lyceum Theatre, Crewe .

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===
In August 2007, Davro joined the cast of the BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, playing Vinnie Monks, a love interest for Shirley Carter. The character first appeared on screen in October. He left in autumn 2008, later claiming his character &quot;wasn&#x27;t very good and they didn&#x27;t give me proper storylines&quot;.

===Guest appearances===
In 1987, Bobby Davro appeared in an episode of &quot;Rainbow&quot; titled &quot;Guess Who I Am&quot;, in which he did impressions of Bungle, Zippy, George and Geoffrey.

In 2006, Davro made a special guest appearance as a judge on Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;All Star Talent Show&quot;.

On 20 September 2009, he appeared in a new series of the Channel 4 programme &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;. This was a celebrity episode in which he appeared with &quot;EastEnders&quot; actress Laila Morse, DJ Dane Bowers and former &quot;The Word&quot; presenter Dani Behr. Davro attained second place.

===&quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;===

Davro took part in the ITV skating show &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; in January 2010, and was paired with newcomer Molly Moenkhoff. He began the show as a 66/1 outsider to be the outright winner, and made his first and only competitive appearance along with the other male celebrities in week 2. Following a poor performance he was the first male celebrity to be eliminated, after a dance-off against actor Gary Lucy.

===&quot;Your Face Sounds Familiar&quot;===
In 2013, Davro along with other celebrities took part in the ITV entertainment series &quot;Your Face Sounds Familiar&quot;. He was eliminated in the fifth week. His chosen charity for the series was Kids &#x27;n&#x27; Cancer.

===&quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;===

After dismissing reality shows including Big Brother, Britain&#x27;s Got Talent and I&#x27;m a Celebrity and saying he would never appear on such series, in 2015 Davro entered the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; house to take part in the sixteenth series. On 24 September, he reached the final and was placed 4th.

==Personal life==
Trudi Jameson, the mother of Davro&#x27;s three children, is from Sutton Coldfield. The couple parted in 2003.

Between 2007 and 2011 Davro dated Vicky Wright, daughter of Wolverhampton Wanderers and England footballer Billy Wright. They later reunited and were engaged to be married until Wright&#x27;s death in May 2023.

Davro&#x27;s father, Bill Nankeville, was a runner; a British national mile and 1500m champion, world-record holder, and represented Great Britain in two Olympic Games. In 2003 Davro was one of the contestants in the Channel 4 reality TV show &quot;The Games&quot;, in which 10 celebrities competed against each other in Olympic style events.

===Charity===
Davro has been a supporter of the UK charity Kids &#x27;n&#x27; Cancer.

<text>Drude is a lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, in the rugged Montes Cordillera range that forms the outer ring around the Mare Orientale impact basin. It is located just behind the west-southwest limb, and this area is sometimes brought into sight from Earth during favorable librations. However, even at such times, the crater is viewed from the edge and little detail can be seen.

This is a circular crater with a relatively sharp edge, sloping inner walls and a fairly level interior. It has not been significantly eroded, and is generally unremarkable. The nearest craters of note are Graff to the south-southeast and Focas to the north-northwest. The surrounding area is of note for the tumultuous terrain created by the ejecta from Mare Imbrium.

The satellite crater formerly known as Drude S was renamed Heyrovský by the IAU.

This crater lies north of the Mendel-Rydberg Basin, a 630 km wide impact basin of Nectarian age.

<text>Jujyfruits are a chewy, gumdrop-like starch-based candy, manufactured by Heide Candy Company, a subsidiary of Ferrara Candy Company. Jujyfruits began production in 1920. They were popular in movie houses along with Heide&#x27;s other gummy candy, Jujubes.

==Description==
The Jujyfruits shapes are Asparagus Bundle, Banana, Grape Bundle, Pea Pod, Pineapple, Raspberry, and Tomato. The banana shape is stamped with &quot;HEIDE&quot;. Fruity flavors correspond to the colors (not the shapes) and include raspberry (red), anise/licorice (black), lime (green), orange (orange), and lemon (yellow). The candies are firm and harden with age or when chilled. A sour variety is also available.

Until January 1999, the green sweets were mint flavored. Hershey (the parent company at the time) changed them to lime after a customer survey found that mint was not a popular flavor.

==Ingredients==
As of January 2024, the ingredients listed on Jujyfruits boxes are:
* Corn syrup
* Sugar
* Modified and unmodified cornstarch
* Natural and artificial flavors
* White mineral oil
* Carnauba wax
* Caramel color

<text>Araraquara ( or ) is a city in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 250,314 (2022 est.) in an area of . It is also known as &quot;the abode of the sun,&quot; because of its impressive sunset and because of its hot atmosphere, especially in summer. The city was founded in 1817.

==History==
===Etymology===
There are two possible origins for the name of the city, one that links it to the Tupi-Guarani language of the region&#x27;s indigenous inhabitants, and another that relates it to the Língua Geral of São Paulo. The two versions come from similar expressions, &quot;&quot;arará kûara&quot; and &quot;arara kûara&quot;,&quot; which mean &quot;lair of the macaws.&quot;

==Geography==
The city is in the Microregion of Araraquara, part of the Mesoregion of Araraquara, 270 km north of São Paulo.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

==Transport==
The city is served by Bartolomeu de Gusmão Airport.

==Sport==
Ferroviária is the local football (soccer) team of the city organized back in 1950 by the railroad workers at EFA – Araraquara Railroad Company (Estradas de Ferro de Araraquara). The team is known as &quot;Locomotives&quot; and plays home matches at Estádio Fonte Luminosa, which has a maximum seating capacity of 27,000 people.

Ferroviária also has a very competitive professional female soccer team organized in 2001 that started to collect titles almost straight away. The Ferroviária Women Soccer team got its first state title in 2002 – the São Paulo State championship. The women&#x27;s team did it again in 2004, 2005 and 2013 to rake up four state titles. The Ferroviaria women soccer team kept evolving in structure to get national projection – it won in 2014 the Copa do Brasil and two more national titles, the Brasileirão in 2014 and 2019. They also reached two most important titles for the women soccer in Americas. In March 2021, the Ferroviaria Women soccer team won its second title of Libertadores da America championship in 2020 edition (due to COVID-19 limitations). The first title at Libertadores da America came on 2015. Lindsay Camila is the Ferrroviaria Women Soccer team coach.

<text>Dollond is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the central region of the Moon, to the north of the crater Abulfeda. It was named after British optician John Dollond. Due west of Dollond is Anděl. Dollond is circular and cone shaped, with a tiny floor at the midpoint of the sloping interior walls.

About 50 kilometers to the northeast of this crater was the landing site of the Apollo 16 mission, the next-to-last of the Apollo expeditions to the Moon.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Dollond.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Dolland C — &quot;See&quot; Lindsay.

Dollond T is the closest named feature to the Apollo 16 landing site, other than the features that were named by the astronauts (such as North Ray and South Ray craters).

<doc id="1259425" wikidata="Q11813493" url="?curid=1259425" title="Patowmack Canal">
<text>The Patowmack Canal, sometimes called the Potomac Canal, is a series of five inoperative canals located in Maryland and Virginia, United States, that was designed to bypass rapids in the Potomac River upstream of the present Washington, D.C., area. The most well known of them is the Great Falls skirting canal, whose remains are managed by the National Park Service since it is within Great Falls Park, an integral part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway.

The first section of the canal opened in 1795, and the canal ended operations in 1828.

==History==

===Planning the canal===
Few ventures were dearer to George Washington than his plan to make the Potomac River navigable as far as the Ohio River Valley. In the uncertain period after the Revolutionary War, Washington believed that better transportation and trade would draw lands west of the Allegheny Mountains into the United States and &quot;bind those people to us by a chain which never can be broken.&quot;

&quot;The way,&quot; Washington wrote, &quot;is easy and dictated by our clearest interest. It is to open a wide door, and make a smooth way for the produce of that Country to pass to our Markets.&quot;

As a waterway west, the Potomac River could be that &quot;door.&quot; It was the shortest potential route between Tidewater, with access to East Coast and trans-Atlantic trade, and the headwaters of the Ohio River, with access to the western frontier. But both political and physical obstacles had to be overcome.

Opening the Potomac required cooperation of Virginia and Maryland, both of which bordered the river. In 1784, Washington convinced the states&#x27; assemblies to establish a company to improve the Potomac between its headwaters near Cumberland, Maryland, and tidewater at Georgetown. The Patowmack Company, organized May 17, 1785, drew directors and subscribers from both states. Then, Washington wrote in his diary, the office of president of the Patowmack Company &quot;fell upon me.&quot; He presided over the project until he became the nation&#x27;s chief executive (President of the United States).

Delegates from Virginia and Maryland, meeting at Washington&#x27;s home in 1785, drew up the Mount Vernon Compact, providing for free trade on the river. Virginia and Maryland legislators ratified the compact and then invited all 13 states to send delegates to a convention in Annapolis in 1786 &quot;to consider how far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be necessary to their common interest.&quot; The Annapolis Convention led to a general meeting in Philadelphia the following May. Thus, George Washington&#x27;s lobbying for interstate cooperation on the Potomac helped prepare the way for the Constitutional Convention of 1787.

===Building the canals===
Five skirting canals were made: Little Falls, Great Falls, Seneca Falls (across from Seneca Creek), Payne&#x27;s Falls of the Shenendoah, and House Falls, (near Harpers Ferry, Virginia, now West Virginia). Three of the canals did not require locks: the Seneca Falls, House Falls, and Payne&#x27;s Falls. Little Falls used wooden locks, which were not meant to be permanent.

At Great Falls, the Potomac presented physical obstacles to travel as well. Narrow and winding in places, it drops over 600 feet in 200 miles from Cumberland to sea level. Spring rains swell the river to dangerous heights; summer droughts can render it impassable. To make the river navigable by even shallow draft boats, the Patowmack Company had to dredge portions of the riverbed and skirt five areas of falls.

====Little Falls Canal====

The Little Falls canal ran 3814 yards on the Maryland side of the river. The original locks, near today&#x27;s Fletcher&#x27;s Boat House, were made of wood, and the canal was finished in 1795. These wooden locks were replaced with stone locks in 1817, and had a lift of 37 feet. The first two locks were named &quot;Martha&quot; and &quot;George&quot; (after Martha Washington and George Washington).

This canal was later repurposed for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&amp;O), partially as Feeder #1, and as the canal itself from Lock 5 to just before Fletcher&#x27;s Boat House. The remains of the stone locks were destroyed when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) built its Georgetown Branch line c. 1910. (The rail line was later abandoned and converted to the Capital Crescent Trail in the 1990s.)

====Great Falls Canal====

By far the most demanding task was building a canal with locks to bypass the Great Falls of the Potomac River. Roaring over the rocks, the river drops nearly 80 feet in less than a mile.

Swift currents, solid rock, and constant financial and labor problems hindered progress on the Patowmack Canal at Great Falls.

Construction begun in 1785 and took seventeen years to complete - six years longer than the time required to locate, build, and begin occupying a new federal city, Washington, D.C., ten miles downriver. Construction required engineering skills and a labor force not easily found in 18th century America. Crews consisted of unskilled laborers, skilled indentured servants, and slaves rented from nearby plantations. The work was difficult and dangerous. With one of the earliest uses in this country of black-powder blasting, workers forced a channel through the rock cliffs for the final three locks.

The canal is 1,820 yards long and was completed in 1801, and opened to traffic in 1802. Its five locks raised or lowered boats to skirt around Great Falls, and were constructed of red sandstone from the Seneca Quarry across the river in Maryland. Locking through the whole canal could be accomplished in about an hour.

An entire town grew up around the construction site to serve as headquarters for the Patowmack Company and home for the workers. The town was named Matildaville by its founder, the Revolutionary War hero Light Horse Harry Lee. Harry Lee, the father of Robert E. Lee, named the town for his first wife, Matilda Lee.

====Seneca Falls Canal====
This canal was 1,320 yards long and despite going down 7 feet, had no locks, and is on the Virginia side. This was worked on in 1785. This refers to the falls which start just below Seneca Creek, Maryland (this is not to be confused with Seneca Falls, New York where the Cayuga–Seneca Canal was built). It is opposite Dam No. 2 / Violettes Lock on the C&amp;O Canal.

====Shenandoah or Paynes Falls Canal====
This canal, just below Harpers Ferry, was 1,760 yards long, dropped 15 feet, and had no locks either. This was also called the Bullring Canal by some boatmen (the falls also being called &quot;Bullring Falls&quot; according to Thomas Moore&#x27;s 1820 writings), and was made up of two short skirting canals with a &quot;short sheet of water about a quarter mile&quot; between them.

Note: There is a good deal of confusion, even in the Potomac Company Records, to the canals around Harpers Ferry, more than one being called the &quot;Shenandoah Canal&quot; (sometimes inaccurately).

====House Falls Canal====

This Maryland canal, also called the Long Canal, had no locks, and overcame a drop of three feet. This canal was reused for the C&amp;O Canal, between Dam No. 3 and Lock 34 (Goodheart&#x27;s Lock), according to a 1922 survey, for a distance of almost a mile.

====Other improvements====
Some other tributaries to the Potomac had work done on them, such as Conococheague Creek, the Monocacy River, Patterson Creek, South Branch, Cacpon Creek, Opequon Creek, and the Shenandoah River.

===Operating the canal===
Matildaville, at its height, boasted the company superintendent&#x27;s house, a market, grist mill, sawmill, foundry, inn, ice house, workers&#x27; barracks, boarding houses, and a sprinkling of small homes. Boaters stopped here to wait their turn through the locks, to change cargo, or to enjoy an evening in town before continuing their journey.

Thousands of boats locked through at Great Falls, carrying flour, whiskey, tobacco, and iron downstream; carrying cloth, hardware, firearms, and other manufactured products upstream. Vessels varied from crudely constructed rafts to the long narrow &quot;sharper,&quot; a keelboat that could carry up to 20 tons of cargo. The trip took 3 to 5 days down to Georgetown and 10 to 12 days poling against the current back to Cumberland. Many boat owners simply sold their boats for scrap and walked back instead.

Here is a sample of what was carried down in 1811:

Also carried in 1811 were firearms, pig iron, timber, rye, flax seed, hemp, butter oats, cloverseed, and staves.

Gondolas were one-use log rafts, about 60 by 10 feet, and held many tons of cargo. Sharpers were flatbottomed boats 60 feet by 7 feet. These also were poled down the river, but were not used as much, since they could only get through the shallows of the Potomac 45 days per year during spring flooding. Wrecks and loss of cargo were probably frequent, since it is written that the people of Cooney (a hamlet near Little Falls) was well supplied with coal, flour, meat (etc.) from wrecks.

Although the charter required year-round operation, the canal operated seasonally, from February until May. Summer droughts shut down operation until rains in the autumn.

Built to support the canal industry, Matildaville&#x27;s fate was tied to that of the Patowmack Company. Today, only a few fragile remains of Matildaville are visible.

The greatest obstacle to the Patowmack project proved to be financial. High construction costs, particularly at the Great Falls section, and insufficient revenues bankrupted the company. Extremes of high and low water restricted use of the canal to only a month or two each year. The tolls collected could not even pay interest on the company debt.

They planned to make more improvements on other major branches of the Potomac but doing so did nothing to increase the company&#x27;s revenues. They issued more stock, borrowed from banks, and even tried a lottery all to no avail.

===End of canal operations===
The Erie Canal opened in 1825, and immediately became a rival, controlling a connection between the Great Lakes and the Eastern Seaboard. The Patowmack Company folded in 1828, turning over its assets and liabilities to the newly formed C&amp;O Canal Company. The new company abandoned the Patowmack Canal (except for the section at Little Falls) in 1830 for an even more ambitious undertaking: a man-made waterway stretching from Georgetown to Pittsburgh. Although the Patowmack Company was a financial failure, its builders pioneered lock engineering and stimulated a wave of canal construction important to the country&#x27;s development.

Groundbreaking for the C&amp;O Canal took place close to Lock 6, near the upstream side of the Little Falls Skirting Canal. In the end, the Little Falls skirting canal was modified and repurposed for the C&amp;O Canal prism as well as becoming its feeder canal (Inlet #1), after some modifications. From Lock 5 to almost Fletcher&#x27;s Boat House is the bed of the Little Falls Skirting Canal.

The Shenandoah canal (i.e. canal on the Shenandoah River) was still used occasionally, and was the reason why the C&amp;O canal had to build the Shenandoah river lock (just below Lock 33) at Harper&#x27;s Ferry, to get cooperation from the Virginia state legislature. Boats were to leave the C&amp;O Canal, with the mules crossing over the B&amp;O railroad bridge, bringing them to the Shenandoah, letting them go through the canal there.

George Washington did not live to see the completion of the navigation project that had been his obsession since youth. But he did take pride in visiting the canal during the construction to inspect its progress. He died in 1799, two years before the canal opened at Great Falls. But in the long run Washington&#x27;s vision of a strong nation linked by a direct, long-distance trade network came true. His frequent toast, &quot;Success to the navigation of the Potomac!&quot; became a footnote of American history.

==Current recreational use==
In 1930 the U.S. Congress authorized the canals as a park. The National Park Service took on responsibility for its management in 1966.

The preservation of the Patowmack Canal is part of the Park Service&#x27;s continuing efforts to protect and preserve special resources of the park. The Patowmack Canal and Matildaville ruins are protected by the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. This law prohibits excavation, removal, or displacement of archaeological resources. The significance of the Patowmack Canal in the development of the young nation is evident in its designation as a National Historic Landmark. The Patowmack Canal is a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, and a Virginia Historic Landmark.

The remains of the Seneca canal still exist on the Virginia side, opposite Violette&#x27;s lock (on the C&amp;O Canal).

===Visitor information===
Great Falls Park is open to the public daily, with an admission fee.

Safety is a primary concern in the Park. Prohibited activities include alcohol, open fires, swimming, wading or crossing of any open water. Sporting activities such as rock climbing and kayaking at Great Falls Park should be conducted only by experienced persons familiar with the dangers and safety protocols involved therein. These are dangerous grounds and accidental deaths are not uncommon. The park had 27 deaths between 2001 and 2013.

The Patowmack Canal Trail is accessible by wheelchair as far as Lock 1. The trail surface consists of compacted soil with no curbs. The National Park Service opened a wheelchair accessible overlook to the Great Falls in January 2005 and was renovating a second overlook to the Great Falls due for completion in late May 2005.

The Great Falls section of the canal, along with the archaeological remains of Matildaville and other nearby canal-related sites, were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982, as one of the nation&#x27;s earliest efforts at large-scale civil engineering, reflective of the visions of two of its Founding Fathers, George Washington and James Madison.

<doc id="1259427" wikidata="Q247836" url="?curid=1259427" title="Diplolepis (wasp)">
<text>Diplolepis is a genus of approximately fifty species of gall-inducing wasps in the family Diplolepididae. The larvae induce galls on wild roses (&quot;Rosa&quot;), and rarely on domestic roses.

== Description ==
Adults are small () with a strongly arched mesosoma giving them a hunched appearance. Coloration ranges from entirely orange to reddish-brown or black. Larvae are legless and cream-colored with a weakly defined head.

Galls formed by a given species can usually be distinguished from those of other species by the shape, size, placement, and ornamentation (smooth or spiny) of the gall, together with the identity of the host plant. However, gall morphology can be modified by the presence of inquilines and parasitoids. Some species induce galls on leaves, while others induce galls on stems or adventitious shoots. Depending on the species of wasp, galls may be single-chambered or multi-chambered, and detachable or integral.

== Range ==
&quot;Diplolepis&quot; species occur throughout the holarctic region. While most described species are in the nearctic, it is likely many species remain to be discovered and described, particularly in the eastern palearctic.

== Life cycle ==
All &quot;Diplolepis&quot; species lay eggs and induce galls only on rose (&quot;Rosa&quot;) species, and are thus dependent on roses to complete their life cycle. There is only one generation per year. Adult emergence from galls coincides with the availability of suitable host plant tissue required for oviposition and gall formation; this can be in spring or later in summer depending on the species. The adult life span is 5–12 days, during which they mate and the females lay their eggs. Eggs are attached to 1-2 plant cells and gall formation begins before the eggs hatch. Larvae are entirely surrounded by their galls shortly after they begin feeding. Larvae remain in their galls during the summer while feeding on gall tissue, and mature by late summer. They overwinter in their galls as pre-pupae; they complete pupation in spring and the adults chew their way out of the galls.
== Inquilines and parasitoids ==
The galls of nearly all &quot;Diplolepis&quot; species are known to host inquilines - species that invade and occupy a gall but do not feed on the larva of the inducing species, though the inducing larva often dies as a result of the activity of the inquiline. Species of the gall wasp genus &quot;Periclistus&quot; are the most common inquiline species found in &quot;Diplolepis&quot; galls and may occupy over half the &quot;Diplolepis&quot; galls produced in a given year.

The larvae of both the gall-inducing &quot;Diplolepis&quot; species and the inquilines (if present) are used as hosts by a number of parasitoid wasps, including wasps from the families Eulophidae, Eupelmidae, Eurytomidae, Ormyridae, Pteromalidae, Torymidae, and Ichneumonidae.

== Taxonomy ==
The name &quot;&#x27;Diplolepis&quot;&#x27; was first used for this group by Etienne-Louis Geoffroy in 1762. The genus is monophyletic and, with &quot;Liebelia&quot;, constitutes the subfamily Diplolepidinae. This subfamily was previously considered a tribe - Diplolepidini - of the gall wasp family Cynipidae. There are currently about 50 described species in the genus, including:

* &quot;Diplolepis abei&quot; 
*&quot;Diplolepis arefacta&quot;

<doc id="1259428" wikidata="Q597314" url="?curid=1259428" title="Super Bowl XLII">
<text>Super Bowl XLII was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion New York Giants and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2007 season. The game was played on February 3, 2008, at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Despite New England being heavily favored heading into the game, the Giants defeated the Patriots by the score of 17–14. The game is regarded as one of the biggest upsets in the history of professional North American sports, as well as one of the greatest Super Bowl games ever.

The Patriots entered the game as 12-point favorites after becoming the first team to complete a perfect regular season since the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the only one since the league expanded to a 16-game regular season schedule in 1978. The Giants, who finished the regular season with a 10–6 record, were seeking to become the first NFC wild card team to win a Super Bowl, and were also looking for their third Super Bowl victory and first since they won Super Bowl XXV seventeen years earlier. This Super Bowl was also a rematch of the final game of the regular season, in which New England won, 38–35.

In the fourth quarter, down 14–10, the Giants started their game-winning drive on their own 17-yard line with 2:39 left. In the drive&#x27;s most memorable play, David Tyree made the &quot;Helmet Catch&quot; on 3rd down, a leaping one-handed catch pinning the football with his right hand to the crown of his helmet for a 32-yard first down conversion. After a second first-down conversion by Steve Smith on 3rd and 11, wide receiver Plaxico Burress scored the winning touchdown on a 13-yard reception with 35 seconds remaining. The Giants&#x27; game winning-drive is often regarded as the greatest in NFL history.

The game was tight throughout, with both teams&#x27; defense dominating the competition until near the end of the game. The game featured five lead changes (New York took it three times and New England twice). Only 10 total points were scored in the first three quarters. The Giants consumed a Super Bowl-record 9 minutes and 59 seconds on their opening drive, but could only manage a field goal. The Patriots then responded with running back Laurence Maroney&#x27;s 1-yard touchdown run on the first play of the second quarter. After a scoreless third quarter, the fourth quarter saw a Super Bowl-record three lead changes. After Tyree&#x27;s 3-yard touchdown reception at the beginning of the quarter, New England wide receiver Randy Moss made a 6-yard touchdown reception with 2:42 left to play before New York&#x27;s game-winning drive. Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who completed 19 of 34 passes for 255 yards with two touchdowns and one interception, was named Super Bowl MVP. Giants defensive end Michael Strahan, who retired following the victory, had two tackles and one sack. This game was the first since Super Bowl IX in 1975 (in which the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 16–6) that neither team scored at least 20 points. This game was also the first Super Bowl game with three fourth-quarter lead changes, and the only one to date.

Super Bowl XLII was ranked fifth on NFL.com&#x27;s 100 Greatest Games, the highest ranked Super Bowl game, while Tyree&#x27;s catch was ranked third on NFL.com&#x27;s 100 Greatest Plays. Many other media outlets rank Super Bowl XLII as the greatest Super Bowl ever. Many sports websites consider it one of the most iconic sports moments of the 2000s.

The telecast of the game on Fox broke the then-record for the most watched Super Bowl in history with an average of 97.5 million viewers in the United States.
==Background==

===Host selection process===
As always, the league considered several potential host cities before choosing the Phoenix area. In this case, the process drew special interest because the league considered holding Super Bowl XLII in New York City or Washington, D.C. as a symbol of the recovery from the September 11 attacks. New York City&#x27;s bid did not go far. Aside from the obvious climatic concerns, it was also difficult to find a suitable stadium. Proposed renovations to the 1970s-vintage Giants Stadium were still being disputed amongst the various parties. Giants Stadium also lacked a roof, as did both of New York City&#x27;s baseball stadiums, and the NFL had never played an outdoor Super Bowl in a cold weather climate. The city of New York and the New York Jets failed to secure a deal to build a new West Side Stadium (which, according to the initial plans, would have been built with a roof). During the years since the Super Bowl XLII bid fell through, Giants Stadium has been demolished. Its replacement, MetLife Stadium, was awarded Super Bowl XLVIII.

Washington, D.C.&#x27;s bid proved to be more viable as the D.C. area had a relatively new (albeit roofless) stadium in FedExField. DC&#x27;s winter weather, although still potentially problematic, is milder than New York&#x27;s climate.

In the end, the process boiled down to three finalists: Washington, D.C., Phoenix and Tampa. NFL owners finally chose University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona as the site for Super Bowl XLII during their October 30, 2003, meeting in Chicago. In subsequent years, Raymond James Stadium in Tampa was chosen as the site for Super Bowl XLIII and the proposed (but never built) West Side Stadium was briefly designated as the venue for Super Bowl XLIV. However, this game was later moved to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, when it became clear that the new stadium in New York City would not be built in time for the February 2010 game.

===Venue===

The kickoff for the game took place at 4:32 p.m. MST (23:32 UTC). This was the first Super Bowl played on a retractable natural-grass field surface; the University of Phoenix Stadium&#x27;s removable surface is unique among American sports venues.

Super Bowl XLII was also the second Super Bowl played in a retractable-roof stadium (the first was played at Reliant Stadium in Houston for Super Bowl XXXVIII). During the regular season, the home team decides 90 minutes before kickoff whether the roof will be open or closed, and an open roof must remain open unless weather conditions get worse. However, as a neutral site, the NFL controls the option to open or close without any restrictions. The first time this was employed was in Super Bowl XXXVIII at Reliant Stadium; the roof was open for pregame and halftime shows and closed during the game. Because there was rain in the forecast for Super Bowl XLII, the roof was closed for the entire day&#x27;s activities.

During a February 6, 2007, ceremony with Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano, the NFL and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee unveiled the slogan &quot;Who Wants It More?&quot; along with its mascot &quot;Spike the Super Ball&quot; (an anthropomorphized football with sunglasses and sneakers) and a large &quot;Super Bowl XLII Countdown Clock&quot; at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. The Super Bowl XLII logo was also unveiled. It features the shape of the state of Arizona in red and two horizontal white stripes in the middle to represent the vertical lines on University of Phoenix Stadium. The turquoise Roman numerals represent the Native American culture of Arizona. The red star represents the AFC and the blue star represents the NFC. This was also the last Super Bowl with the league&#x27;s previous logo painted at midfield; the following season, the league redesigned its primary logo.

===Teams===

====New York Giants====
The New York Giants began the season with low expectations after star running back Tiki Barber retired. The Giants had lost in the NFC Wild Card round in each of the previous two seasons and had not won a playoff game in seven years. Quarterback Eli Manning, the younger brother of Super Bowl XLI MVP quarterback Peyton Manning, had struggled to find consistency. In his three seasons as a starter, he had completed less than 54% of his passes with a career passer rating of 73.4. While generally regarded as a solid quarterback, Manning had been unable to achieve the same level of success as fellow 2004 draftees Philip Rivers (for whom he was traded) and Ben Roethlisberger, the latter of whom had already won a Super Bowl (Super Bowl XL). By the 2007 season, many sports writers were starting to question if Eli would ever live up to the expectations that accompanied being selected with the first overall pick in a draft.

The criticism of Manning intensified as the Giants lost the first two games of the regular season. The Giants recovered, though, notching six consecutive wins and finishing the year with a 10–6 record. The Giants were able to secure a wild card bid in the playoffs, despite the loss of running back Derrick Ward, defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka, and four-time Pro Bowl tight end Jeremy Shockey to injury. In the final game of the regular season, the Giants played at home against the undefeated New England Patriots. Although the Giants had already earned a playoff spot and had nothing to gain by winning the game, coach Tom Coughlin decided to play his starters throughout the game. New York, clearly playing to win against the league&#x27;s best team, narrowly lost 38–35. But the effort seemed to rejuvenate the Giants and prepare them for a difficult playoff run. Manning led his team to three road playoff wins in Tampa, Dallas and Green Bay respectively, without throwing a single interception. The Giants&#x27; three playoff wins gave them an NFL record 10 consecutive wins on the road. They finished the season with a franchise-low 77 penalties, after setting a franchise record two years before with 146.

Manning finished the 2007 season with 3,336 yards, 23 touchdowns, and 20 interceptions. His primary target, Plaxico Burress, caught 70 passes for 1,050 yards and 12 touchdowns. Amani Toomer, the Giants all-time leading receiver and one of only two players remaining from their last Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXV, was also a reliable target with 59 receptions for 760 yards, while Shockey contributed 57 receptions for 619 yards and 3 touchdowns before suffering a season-ending injury in week 15. The Giants&#x27; ground game was led by running back Brandon Jacobs, who at 6&#x27;4&quot; (193 cm) and 264 pounds (118 kg), was one of the largest starting halfbacks in the NFL. He finished the season with 1,009 yards and an average of five yards per carry, while also catching 23 passes despite starting only nine games. Running back Reuben Droughns rushed for 276 yards and team-leading 6 touchdowns, while also catching 7 passes for 49 yards and returning 21 kickoffs for 437 yards. Rookie running back Ahmad Bradshaw added 38 kickoff returns for 921 yards, while also rushing for 190.

The Giants had a defensive line that was led by defensive ends Osi Umenyiora (the lone Pro Bowl representative on the team, the fewest a Super Bowl team has ever had), Michael Strahan, and Justin Tuck. Umenyiora led the defense with 13 sacks and five forced fumbles. Strahan, another veteran from the Giants&#x27; last Super Bowl appearance in 2000, had nine sacks, giving him a career total of 141.5 and breaking the franchise record held by Lawrence Taylor. Tuck recorded ten sacks and 48 solo tackles. In the secondary, cornerback Sam Madison and safety Gibril Wilson led the team with four interceptions each. Cornerback R. W. McQuarters had no interceptions during the season, but played effectively in the playoffs, with interceptions in each of the Giants first three postseason games. Punter Jeff Feagles played in his first Super Bowl after 20 years in the NFL. This was also the last game for Giants athletic trainer John Johnson who had been with the team for 60 years.

The Giants became only the fourth team to win the Super Bowl without playing a single home game in the preceding playoffs. They joined the 1966 Green Bay Packers (who won Super Bowl I against the Kansas City Chiefs), the 1969 Kansas City Chiefs (who won Super Bowl IV against the Minnesota Vikings) and the 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers (who won Super Bowl XL against the Seattle Seahawks) in accomplishing this feat. However, Green Bay had to win two games (including the Super Bowl), Kansas City three, and Pittsburgh and the Giants four, in order to accomplish this. Since then, two other teams also won three road playoff games to reach the Super Bowl: the 2010 Green Bay Packers, who won Super Bowl XLV over the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, winners of Super Bowl LV (played in their home stadium with limited attendance because of COVID-19) over the Kansas City Chiefs.

The Giants were the only NFC team to make multiple Super Bowl appearances in the 2000s decade, at the ends of the 2000 and 2007 seasons. Starting with the Rams&#x27; appearance in 2001, ten different NFC teams represented the conference from 2001 to 2010: Rams, Buccaneers, Panthers, Eagles, Seahawks, Bears, Giants, Cardinals, Saints, and Packers.

====New England Patriots====
When the New England Patriots arrived at Super Bowl XLII, they were already billed as the greatest team in NFL history. The Patriots were not only competing for a fourth Super Bowl title since the 2001 season; they were aiming to become the first team in NFL history to achieve a 19–0 record. Their perfect 16–0 record in the regular season was the first since the league moved to a 16-game regular season in 1978. It was also only the fourth undefeated and untied regular season in NFL history. New England set NFL records with 589 points scored (an average of 36.8 points per game) (since broken by the 2013 Broncos), 75 total touchdowns, and a net differential of +315 points (they gave up 274 points, fourth best in the league). Some experts have suggested that the Patriots&#x27; 16–0 record is the culmination of a larger trend towards better records for top NFL teams since the league realignment in 2002.

The team was led by then eighth-year quarterback Tom Brady who proceeded to have the best season of his entire career and won his first NFL MVP and NFL Offensive MVP awards, throwing for a then-career-high 4,806 yards and a then NFL record 50 touchdowns (22 more than his previous best season; since broken by Peyton Manning in 2013), and just eight interceptions. His passer rating of 117.2 was the second-highest season rating in NFL history. One often-cited reason for Brady&#x27;s improved numbers was the acquisition of receivers Randy Moss and Wes Welker. The Patriots acquired Moss, a nine-year veteran, from the Oakland Raiders for a fourth-round pick in the 2007 NFL draft after Moss had, statistically, the worst year of his career (with 42 receptions for 553 yards and three touchdowns). With the Patriots, though, Moss caught 98 receptions for 1,493 yards and an NFL record 23 touchdowns, and was selected a first-team All Pro. The Patriots also gave the Miami Dolphins second- and seventh-round picks for Welker. Welker tied for the league lead with 112 receptions for 1,175 yards and 8 touchdowns, while also returning 25 punts for 249 yards and 7 kickoffs for 176, earning himself second-team All Pro selection. Welker and Moss both earned votes for Offensive Player of the Year. Other major contributors to the Patriots&#x27; passing game included Donté Stallworth, who added 697 yards and three touchdowns, and tight end Benjamin Watson, whose 36 receptions totaled 389 yards and six touchdowns.

Running back Laurence Maroney was the Patriots&#x27; top rusher with 835 yards and six touchdowns, while Sammy Morris added 385 yards and three touchdowns (Morris ended up on injured reserve midway through the season, and thus could not play in the Super Bowl). Longtime Patriot Kevin Faulk had 265 yards and was also a reliable receiver out of the backfield, catching 47 passes for 383 yards and a touchdown. The Patriots offensive line featured three players selected to the Pro Bowl, guard Logan Mankins, tackle Matt Light, and center Dan Koppen.
The Patriots defensive line was led by nose tackle Vince Wilfork, who was selected to his first Pro Bowl; he was also fined four times during the season for unnecessary roughness. The Patriots had a set of veteran linebackers who had a combined 16 Pro Bowl selections. Outside linebacker Mike Vrabel had, statistically, the best season of his career. He led the team in sacks with a career-high 12.5, while also forcing five fumbles and earning his first Pro Bowl selection. Adalius Thomas, an off-season signing from the Ravens, recorded six sacks. Junior Seau, who had been selected to the Pro Bowl 12 times during his career but had never won a Super Bowl, returned for his 18th season and got 74 tackles with 3.5 sacks. Tedy Bruschi recorded 92 tackles and two sacks. The Patriots secondary featured another player selected to the Pro Bowl, cornerback Asante Samuel, who led the team with six interceptions. Defensive back Ellis Hobbs returned 35 kickoffs for 911 yards and a touchdown, ranking him 7th in the NFL with a 26.0 yards per return average.

===Playoffs===
The Giants became the first NFC team (third overall) to advance to the Super Bowl by winning three playoff games on the road. After beating the fourth-seeded Tampa Bay Buccaneers 24–14, the Giants upset the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys 21–17, when R. W. McQuarters intercepted a pass from Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo in the end zone as time expired. The Giants advanced to the Super Bowl with a 23–20 overtime win over the second-seeded Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game, which was the third coldest game in NFL history (−1 °F at kickoff, −24 °F wind chill) with an interception by Corey Webster that set up Lawrence Tynes&#x27;s game-winning 47-yard field goal. The field goal was the longest by a visiting kicker in Lambeau Field postseason history. This turned out to be the final game Brett Favre played for the Packers.

Meanwhile, the Patriots continued to set NFL records on their road to the Super Bowl. First, Brady set the NFL record for completion percentage in a single game (92.9%) with 26 of 28 completions for 268 yards and three touchdowns in their 31–20 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the divisional round, while safety Rodney Harrison tied an NFL record by recording an interception in his fourth consecutive postseason game. One week later, the Patriots defeated the San Diego Chargers 21–12 in the AFC Championship Game. Although Brady threw three interceptions in the game, the Patriots defense forced two turnovers and limited the Chargers to four field goals, while Maroney rushed for 122 yards and a touchdown for the second game in a row.

===Pre-game notes===
New England was heavily favored to win the game and become the first NFL team to go through a 16-game regular season and postseason undefeated. Had the Patriots won, they would also have joined the 1972 Miami Dolphins as the only teams ever to win the NFL league championship with an undefeated and untied record. However, others predicted that the Giants could accomplish a win. New York&#x27;s record of 10 consecutive road wins included five teams favored to beat them. The Giants achieved playoff victories against the Cowboys (who had defeated New York twice in the regular season) and Packers (who had beaten the Giants in week 2).

The Patriots and Giants had played against each other in the last week of the regular season. Technically, the game had little significance, since both teams had already clinched their respective spots in the playoffs. But due to the Patriots&#x27; quest for an undefeated season, this game was one of the most heavily watched games in league history. NFL Network was originally scheduled to air the game as part of their &quot;Saturday Night Football&quot; coverage, with WCVB and WWOR carrying the game locally in Boston and New York. Shortly before the game was scheduled to air, CBS and NBC bought broadcast rights to the game and NFL Network&#x27;s broadcast was carried by both networks, marking the first time in NFL history that an NFL game was carried on three broadcast networks at the same time. The game was also the first NFL game to be simulcast on a national level since Super Bowl I. As they were favored to do, the Patriots won the game to finish the regular season undefeated. Still, the game was close and competitive, with both teams playing their starters for all 60 minutes. New England won, 38–35, by overcoming a 12-point deficit in the third quarter, the largest deficit the Patriots had faced all season. &quot;There is nothing but positives&quot;, Giants coach Tom Coughlin said after the game. &quot;I told the players in playing this game everything would be positives, there would be no negatives and that is how I feel. I don&#x27;t know any better way to be prepared for the playoffs than to go against a team that was 15–0.&quot;

This would be the third time in the Giants&#x27; four Super Bowl appearances in which the team played its eventual AFC opponent during that year&#x27;s regular season. Both of the prior occasions saw the Giants beat those opponents in the Super Bowl (defeating Denver in Super Bowl XXI and Buffalo in Super Bowl XXV).

For the third consecutive year, the arrival dates for the teams were staggered, with the Patriots arriving on Sunday, January 27 (corresponding to the traditional day that teams arrive for the game with the two-week break) and the Giants waiting to arrive until Monday, January 28. A report filed by ESPN&#x27;s Rachel Nichols suggested that the Giants stayed to practice more of their game plan in their home facility before arriving at the Super Bowl. By electing to stay back at home the Giants chose to follow a tactic that the previous two Super Bowl champions, the Indianapolis Colts (before Super Bowl XLI) and the Pittsburgh Steelers (before Super Bowl XL), had employed.

The Patriots practiced at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University, while the Giants practiced at the Arizona Cardinals&#x27; practice facility, both of which are located in Tempe.

As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Patriots elected to wear their home navy uniforms with silver pants, while the Giants wore their road white uniforms with grey pants.

==Broadcasting==
===Television===
====United States====
Fox broadcast Super Bowl XLII as part of an annual cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. Joe Buck and Troy Aikman called the game, while Pam Oliver and Chris Myers were the sideline reporters. Fox aired nine hours of pre-game programming, which began with a special episode of &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;, as well as a two-hour special (&quot;Fox Super Sunday&quot;) hosted by Fox News Channel anchor Shepard Smith, which previewed the Super Tuesday primaries for the 2008 presidential election. The &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; panel hosted the main pre-game show, led by Curt Menefee, joined by Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, and Jimmy Johnson. Jillian Reynolds served as Weather and entertainment reporter, Frank Caliendo appeared in various comedic skits (including one where he portrayed John Madden and correctly predicted that the Giants would win) and &quot;American Idol&quot; host Ryan Seacrest provided coverage of celebrity arrivals to the game site. A Spanish language broadcast was aired on the second audio program with John Laguna as play-by-play announcer and Pepe Mantilla as color analyst.

=====Ratings=====
The telecast was the most watched Super Bowl in history with an average of 97.5 million viewers in the United States. These numbers were later surpassed by several subsequent games, including 2015&#x27;s Super Bowl XLIX (which was also hosted by Glendale), which now holds the record with an average of 114 million viewers. The Super Bowl XLII broadcast achieved the highest Nielsen ratings (43.3) for the game since Super Bowl XXXIV. At the time, it was also the second most watched TV program of all time in the United States.

=====Commercials=====
Fox took in at least $250 million in revenue from commercial time sold for the game.
One of 63 thirty-second spots among thirty-seven different advertisers cost an estimated $2.7 million (excluding production costs), up from $2.6 million in 2007. However, advertisers are usually offered discounted rates below the official one.

As Super Bowl XLII fell only two days before Super Tuesday, critics and politicians foresaw the possibility that presidential candidates could attempt to buy time during the Super Bowl. However, Fox stated that it would not accept such ads, citing both equal time regulations (the FCC has additionally ruled that, despite requirements for all broadcasters to provide &quot;reasonable&quot; access to commercial inventory for candidates before an election or primary, candidates cannot reasonably expect to receive ad time during high-profile programs of this nature), and the fact that all of the spots had already been sold out by January 2008. However, the campaign of Democratic candidate Barack Obama did purchase local ad time in some markets.

The rock band Eels announced an intent to broadcast a one-second spot during the game (consisting solely of lead singer Mark Oliver Everett saying the letter &quot;U&quot;) to promote its compilation album &quot;Useless Trinkets&quot;, but later announced that it had backtracked after having learned it could only purchase commercial time in 30-second blocks (and a proposal to recruit 29 other advertisers to air their own one-second ads alongside them could be harmful to viewers with photosensitive epilepsy).

====International====
Outside North America, Super Bowl XLII was distributed by the NFL and NFL International. Overall, the game was available to an estimated potential audience of one billion viewers within 223 countries and territories. However, viewing figures outside North America rose only marginally on previous years with an estimated 10 million people tuning in from outside the United States, Canada and Mexico for an overall global audience in the region of 114 million. Dick Stockton and Sterling Sharpe were the announcers for the International broadcast.

=====United Kingdom=====
The BBC acquired the rights in the United Kingdom. The game aired live on BBC Two, carrying the NFL International feed, ending ITV Sport&#x27;s coverage, which began in 2005. The game was also subsequently available on the BBC&#x27;s on demand service, iPlayer. Sky Sports broadcast the game in both standard and high definition using Fox&#x27;s feed and announcers.

===Streaming===
Independent Phoenix television station KTVK broadcast a live video stream from a Webcam located outside of the University of Phoenix Stadium. The camera provided millions of Internet users from around the world a chance to peer in on pre- and post-game activities, watching thousands of spectators file into and out of the stadium on Sunday, February 3. The Stadium Cam broadcast from Friday, February 1 to Monday, February 4, 2008, on the station&#x27;s website.

NFL.com carried its own coverage of Super Bowl events leading up to and after the game, mostly simulcasting NFL Network.

===Radio===
On radio, Westwood One had the national broadcast rights to the game in the United States and Canada; Marv Albert and Boomer Esiason served as the announcing team for that network. The game was carried on BBC Radio 5 Live in the United Kingdom with Arlo White commentating.

Sirius Satellite Radio carried twelve feeds in eight languages in the United States. The following language feeds were offered:

*Westwood One (American English)
*Univision Radio/United Stations (Mexican Spanish, U.S.)
*New England Patriots Radio Network
*New York Giants Radio Network
*BBC Radio 5 Live (British English)
*NHK Japan (Japanese)
*NTV Plus (Russian)
*SMG (Mandarin Chinese)

FieldPass, the subscription Internet radio service provided by the league at &quot;NFL.com&quot;, carried most of these feeds, with select international feeds for free.

Locally, Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti called the game for the Patriots on WBCN radio, and Bob Papa, Dick Lynch, and Carl Banks called the Giants&#x27; radio broadcast on WFAN-AM. By NFL rules, only WBCN, WFAN, Sirius and FieldPass carried the teams&#x27; local broadcasts, and affiliate stations instead carried the Westwood One feed. WBCN, WFAN, and Westwood One are all owned by CBS Radio.

===DVD===
The official DVD of the Super Bowl was released on February 26, 2008. The DVD covered the entire 2007 New York Giants season, as well as special features including the NFL Network post game commentary, the halftime show in its entirety, the Media Day highlights, the NFC Divisional Game and NFC Championship Game highlights, profiles on Mathias Kiwanuka and Tom Coughlin, and features on Eli Manning and Michael Strahan. &quot;The New York Giants: Road to Super Bowl XLII&quot; was released on June 3, 2008. It was a 5 disc set that featured the full broadcasts of the last game of the regular season and all four playoff games. On August 26, 2009 &quot;New York Giants 10 Greatest Games&quot; was released, in which Super Bowl XLII was included as well.

==Entertainment==

===Pre-game ceremonies===
Willie Nelson performed at an NFL-sponsored pre-game tailgate party, singing a duet with Sara Evans of his song &quot;Mammas Don&#x27;t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys&quot; as part of Fox&#x27;s pre-game show.

This year&#x27;s Super Bowl entertainment had many connections to Fox&#x27;s series &quot;American Idol&quot;. On August 16, both the NFL and Fox confirmed that &quot;Idol&quot; host Seacrest would serve as emcee for the pre-game show, with Alicia Keys as the primary performer; as she sang a medley of her songs, including &quot;Go Ahead&quot;, &quot;Fallin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;If I Ain&#x27;t Got You&quot;, &quot;Teenage Love Affair&quot;, and &quot;No One&quot; as the final performance. &quot;Idol&quot; Season Six winner Jordin Sparks, herself a native of Glendale and daughter of former New York Giants cornerback Phillippi Sparks, performed the National Anthem, while Phoenix College professor and theatrical interpreter A Dreamer interpreted it into American Sign Language. The anthem was followed by a flyover from the U.S. Navy precision flying team, the Blue Angels. In addition, judge Paula Abdul premiered her first music video in over a decade, &quot;Dance Like There&#x27;s No Tomorrow&quot;, which she made with fellow judge Randy Jackson as part of Fox&#x27;s pregame coverage to kick off her official comeback.

The coin toss ceremony posthumously honored Pro Football Hall of Fame head coach Bill Walsh, who died on July 30, 2007. His former players Ronnie Lott, Jerry Rice and Steve Young joined Walsh&#x27;s children, Craig and Elizabeth, at the ceremony.

===Halftime===

As is always the case, several big names were mentioned as possible performers for the halftime show before a final choice (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) was announced. The halftime entertainer selection process in late 2007 was not unusual: however, since the site selection process four years earlier was of special interest, it is necessary to also mention some of the acts who might have performed, but did not do so.

According to the entertainment publication &quot;Variety&quot;, a wish list of potential halftime performers was developed by the NFL. Among those on the wish list were Bruce Springsteen (who performed during halftime at Super Bowl XLIII the following year), Norah Jones and the Eagles. In addition, interest in the slot was expressed by Bon Jovi, who had planned to open the U.S. leg of their Lost Highway Tour with a performance during the halftime show.

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the engagement was actually offered to the Eagles by the NFL, but the offer was turned down.

Then, on December 2, 2007, it was officially announced that the halftime entertainment would be provided by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The songs &quot;American Girl&quot;, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot;, &quot;Free Fallin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Runnin&#x27; Down a Dream&quot; were performed by the band to kick off their 2008 world tour. Bridgestone served as the halftime show sponsor. The halftime show itself, produced by Don Mischer and White Cherry Entertainment in association with NFL Network, was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2009.

===Post-game ceremonies===

Former Redskins quarterback Doug Williams, MVP in Super Bowl XXII, commemorating the twentieth anniversary of becoming the first African American quarterback to lead a team to victory in the Super Bowl, took part in the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation ceremony after the game.

Eli Manning was awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy for being named MVP, and also received the keys to a 2009 Cadillac Escalade hybrid SUV. Though not the only brothers to play in a Super Bowl, Eli Manning and Peyton Manning (Super Bowl XLI) are the first brothers to be named Super Bowl MVPs (doing so in successive years).

After the game, New York City erupted in celebration, with the sounds of cheers and honking horns echoing through city streets. Crowds of elated New Yorkers, surprised by their team&#x27;s unexpected victory, packed Second Avenue in Manhattan, stalling traffic around the borough. Times Square was swarmed with celebrating Giants fans well past midnight; similar celebrations arose throughout Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, Staten Island, Long Island, Westchester County, Fairfield County, and North Jersey, where the Giants play their home games.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, witnessing the first New York sports team championship victory as mayor, praised the hometown team&#x27;s upset victory, saying; &quot;New York has come back many times in the past, and Big Blue proved tonight that you should never, ever, count us out.&quot; Many New Yorkers polled the Giants&#x27; win to be among the most satisfying championship victories in New York sports history. There were also a series of firsts with the championship, not just for the Giants, but also for the city of New York and the New York metropolitan area. Those firsts were:

*Giants:
**Super Bowl championship since Super Bowl XXV in 1991.
*City of New York:
**Super Bowl championship since the Giants won Super Bowl XXV in 1991.
**Major professional sports championship since:
***The Yankees won the 2000 World Series.
***This was also the first championship for a team other than the Yankees since the Rangers won the 1994 Stanley Cup.
*New York Metropolitan area:
**Super Bowl championship since the Giants win in 1991.

On the following Tuesday, February 5, New York City hosted for the Giants a ticker tape parade up Broadway in Lower Manhattan. It was the first along the famed &quot;Canyon of Heroes&quot; since the New York Yankees won the 2000 World Series, and the Giants&#x27; first parade in New York. (Because of acrimonious relations at that time between New York City and the state of New Jersey, the team chose not to participate in a Manhattan parade for its Super Bowl XXI championship in 1987, but instead held a &quot;Victory Rally&quot; at Giants Stadium in The Meadowlands. After their Super Bowl XXV championship in 1991, then-owner Wellington Mara chose not to hold any celebrations due to the Gulf War.) After six years in office, Bloomberg became the 14th consecutive mayor of New York City to preside over a ticker-tape parade. (In contrast, his predecessor, Rudy Giuliani presided over his first ticker-tape parade just five months after becoming mayor, after the Rangers won the Stanley Cup) Also attending were New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and Senator Chuck Schumer. Spitzer also announced the availability of a New York Giants Super Bowl XLII Champions custom license plate and issued a proclamation declaring the day &quot;New York Giants Super Bowl Champions Day&quot; throughout the state of New York.

Following the parade, the Giants held two victory rallies: one at New York&#x27;s City Hall and another one two hours later at Giants Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands.

==Game summary==

After scoring a combined 73 points in their regular season meeting, the teams scored a mere 10 points by the end of the third quarter, with the Patriots leading 7–3. The Patriots&#x27; record-setting offense gave up five sacks and one lost fumble, while the Giants&#x27; offense managed only five first downs in the second and third quarters. Yet in the fourth quarter, Eli Manning threw two touchdown passes, including the winning drive that culminated with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress with 35 seconds remaining.

===First quarter===
The Giants won the coin toss and started the game with the longest drive in Super Bowl history, a 16-play, 63-yard march that consumed 9 minutes, 59 seconds, breaking their own record of 9 minutes, 29 seconds set in Super Bowl XXV, and featured four third-down conversions, the most ever on a Super Bowl opening drive. But the Patriots halted the drive at their own 14-yard line, forcing the Giants to settle for a 32-yard field goal from kicker Lawrence Tynes that gave New York a 3–0 lead.

New England responded with their own scoring drive, as running back Laurence Maroney returned the kickoff 43 yards to his own 44-yard line, after which he rushed twice for 14 yards. Quarterback Tom Brady then completed three passes for 23 yards, but after two incomplete passes, New England was faced with 3rd-and-10 on the New York 17-yard line. However, on that play, Giants linebacker Antonio Pierce committed pass interference by striking the helmet of tight end Benjamin Watson in the end zone, setting up 1st-and-goal for the Patriots at the 1-yard line.

===Second quarter===
Two plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, Maroney scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Patriots their first lead of the game, 7–3. The two teams each only had one drive in the entire opening quarter, a Super Bowl record. It was the first Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXXIII in which both teams scored on their initial possession of the game. On the Giants&#x27; first drive of the second quarter, on 3rd-and-7, wide receiver Amani Toomer caught a deep pass from quarterback Eli Manning along the left sideline while dragging his feet in bounds for a 38-yard gain, moving the ball to the Patriots&#x27; 19-yard line. But three plays later, Manning threw a pass that bounced out of the arms of wide receiver Steve Smith and into the hands of cornerback Ellis Hobbs for an interception.

The Patriots&#x27; ensuing drive resulted in a three-and-out as on 3rd-and-1 safety James Butler and defensive end Michael Strahan (who was playing in his final game) tackled Maroney for a 2-yard loss and New England was forced to punt.

Then on the Giants&#x27; next drive, running back Ahmad Bradshaw fumbled a hand-off from Manning and linebacker Pierre Woods appeared to recover the ball at the New York 30. But after the officials picked through the pile, it was determined that Bradshaw had made the recovery. The Giants maintained possession and still had to punt. New England&#x27;s next drive ended with back-to-back 7-yard sacks, the first by linebacker Kawika Mitchell, and the second by defensive end Justin Tuck.

On New York&#x27;s next drive, they moved the ball to the New England 25, but linebacker Adalius Thomas sacked Manning and forced a fumble. Smith recovered the ball, but Bradshaw was flagged for illegally batting the ball forward before the recovery. The penalty pushed the Giants out of field goal range, and following an incompletion, they were forced to punt again.

After the punt, two 18-yard receptions by wide receivers Randy Moss and Donté Stallworth moved the ball to the New York 44-yard line. But with 22 seconds left before halftime, Tuck strip-sacked Brady and defensive end Osi Umenyiora recovered the ball. The game then went to halftime with the Patriots leading 7–3.

===Third quarter===

On the first drive of the second half, New England had a 4th-and-2 and chose to punt. However, after the kick, Patriots&#x27; head coach Bill Belichick challenged that New York&#x27;s defense had 12 players on the field and replay confirmed that was the case as Giants linebacker Chase Blackburn was unable to get to the sidelines as the ball was being snapped. Therefore, referee Mike Carey reversed the play, and the Giants were penalized for having too many players on the field, giving the Patriots a new set of downs. The Patriots then drove to the Giants&#x27; 25, but Strahan sacked Brady for a 6-yard loss on third down (which was Strahan&#x27;s final career sack), bringing up 4th-and-13 on the New York 31. Belichick decided against a 49-yard field goal attempt by kicker Stephen Gostkowski (near Gostkowski&#x27;s season long of 50 yards) and tried to pick up a first down instead. Brady&#x27;s pass to wide receiver Jabar Gaffney was incomplete as it went out of the back of the end zone and the Giants took over on downs.

===Fourth quarter===
After the teams traded punts going into the fourth quarter, Manning completed a 45-yard pass to tight end Kevin Boss. Following three runs by Bradshaw for 13 yards and a 17-yard reception by Smith on third down, Manning finished the 6-play, 80-yard drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to usually unheralded wide receiver David Tyree, giving New York a 10–7 lead with 11:05 left in the game.

After the teams exchanged punts again, New England got the ball at their own 20 with 7:54 remaining. Brady then completed a 5-yard pass to wide receiver Wes Welker and a 10-yard pass to Moss, followed by a 9-yard run by Maroney to give the Patriots a first down at their own 44. Brady followed with a 13-yard pass to Welker, a 4-yard completion to running back Kevin Faulk, and then a 10-yard pass to Welker for a first down at the Giants&#x27; 29. After that, Brady found Moss for an 11-yard completion and Faulk for a 12-yard completion and New England now had 1st-and-goal from the New York 6. Following two incomplete passes, cornerback Corey Webster slipped while backing into coverage, leaving Moss wide open in the end zone where Brady found him for a 6-yard touchdown to give New England a 14–10 lead with 2:42 left in the game.

On the ensuing kickoff, safety Raymond Ventrone leveled wide receiver Domenik Hixon after a 14-yard return, giving New York the ball on their own 17 with 2:39 left and all three timeouts remaining. Following two receptions by Toomer for 20 yards, running back Brandon Jacobs kept the drive alive with a crucial 2-yard run off guard on 4th-and-1. Manning picked up 5 yards with a scramble on the next play. Then on 2nd-and-5, Manning’s pass was high and behind Tyree, but fell harmlessly out of bounds as New England cornerback Asante Samuel could not corral the pass for the potential game-ending interception. Play-by-play announcer Joe Buck was quick to note Manning’s visible frustration at the apparent miscommunication with Tyree on the play, which stopped the clock with 1:15 remaining. On the next play, 3rd-and-5 from the New York 44-yard line, Manning found himself in trouble as the Patriots&#x27; pass rush got to him quickly after the snap. He eluded Adalius Thomas, who missed Manning despite having the clearest shot at him, and then broke free from the grasp of defensive ends Jarvis Green and Richard Seymour, both of whom had the quarterback by the jersey but failed to hold him in the grasp. In what is considered to be among the greatest Super Bowl plays of all time, Manning then re-oriented himself and launched the ball deep down the middle of the field, where both Tyree and Patriots safety and multiple-time Pro Bowler Rodney Harrison were in position to make a play on the ball. Tyree outjumped Harrison to secure the ball, and maintained possession by pinning the ball against his helmet as he fell to the ground, clearly maintaining control for a gain of 32 yards and keeping the drive alive. Three plays later, on 3rd-and-11, Manning found a wide-open Smith for a 12-yard gain to the New England 13, and Smith stepped out of bounds to stop the clock. On the next play, Hobbs was beaten badly to the outside by the 6&#x27;6&quot; wide receiver Plaxico Burress on a &quot;slant-and-go&quot; route, allowing Manning more than enough room to find his big-bodied target for the touchdown. The score capped a 12-play, 83-yard drive to give New York a 17–14 lead and prompted a roar from the fans in Glendale, then a mere 35 seconds from potentially witnessing the first 19–0 perfect season.

The Patriots attempted one last desperate drive to either tie or win the game from their own 26 with 29 seconds remaining and all three of their timeouts, but the Giants&#x27; defense did not allow a single yard. Following an errant pass attempt by Brady, defensive tackle Jay Alford sacked Brady for a 10-yard loss. The following play, a deep pass to Moss, was knocked away by cornerback Corey Webster, and Brady&#x27;s 4th-and-20 Hail Mary pass in Moss&#x27; direction was batted down by safety Gibril Wilson, sealing the upset victory for New York. After the incompletion, it appeared that the officials would run out the clock, as it briefly read zero, before one second was re-added. Coaches, players, reporters, and fans crowded the field as if the game had ended. Belichick hugged Giants&#x27; head coach Tom Coughlin at midfield, then left for the locker room. This early departure was later criticized by some sportswriters, but other reporters defended Belichick by noting that he did not snub Coughlin (which would have been surprising anyway because the two coaches were friends from their days working together for Bill Parcells in the 1980s) and that the outcome of the game had been decided. The delay lasted 2 minutes 27 seconds before Manning kneeled out the final second and the Giants were officially crowned champions.

===Box score===



===Statistical overview===
Manning completed 19 of his 34 passes for 255 yards, including a mark of 9-of-14 for 152 yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, with one interception, to be named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. Manning also became the first quarterback to throw two go-ahead touchdowns in the fourth quarter of a Super Bowl. Toomer was the Giants&#x27; leading receiver, with 6 catches for 84 yards, and Bradshaw and Jacobs rushed for 45 and 42 yards, respectively. Burress had only 2 receptions for 27 yards, but one of those was the game-winning touchdown with 35 seconds left. The Patriots&#x27; offense recorded 274 total yards to the Giants&#x27; 338. While he never scored, Welker tied a Super Bowl record with 11 receptions for 109 yards. Moss had five catches for 62 yards and a touchdown, and Maroney rushed for 36 yards and a TD. Brady completed 29 of his 48 passes for 266 yards and a touchdown. Brady&#x27;s 29 completions gave him a career total of 100 in his four Super Bowls, surpassing the previous record for Super Bowl completions that was held by Joe Montana at 83. Justin Tuck and Adalius Thomas were the top defensive performers for the Giants and Patriots, respectively, as each recorded five solo tackles, two sacks, and one forced fumble.

One key fact of the game was the number of possessions that reached the red-zone: the Giants made it four times and their defense limited the Patriots to two. New England had six consecutive possessions that came short of reaching the New York 20-yard line. The game was the first Super Bowl in which neither team rushed for as many as 100 yards, with the Patriots held to 45.

===Records===
The Giants became the first team to win a Super Bowl in 3 different decades (1986, 1990, 2007). The Giants set an NFL record with 11 consecutive road wins in a single season. The Giants&#x27; matchup in Week 8 vs. the Miami Dolphins in London was an official Giants road game because it was originally scheduled to be played at Dolphin Stadium. The Giants were also officially classified as the &quot;road&quot; team for Super Bowl XLII based on the annual Super Bowl rotation where the NFC champions serve as the away team in even-numbered years, and as such, this was the Giants first championship game won on the road. Also note that the Week 5 game vs. the New York Jets was considered a &quot;home&quot; game for the Giants.

Patriots receiver Wes Welker tied the record for most catches in a Super Bowl, with 11. Welker was the fourth player to record 11 receptions in a Super Bowl, following Dan Ross of the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XVI, Jerry Rice of the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIII, and Deion Branch of the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX. Demaryius Thomas in Super Bowl XLVIII would set a new record for catches.

With his fourth quarter touchdown pass to Moss, Brady became just the fourth quarterback with a touchdown pass in four different Super Bowls, joining Roger Staubach, Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw. He also became the sixth quarterback to start at least four Super Bowls, joining Montana, Bradshaw, Staubach, Jim Kelly and John Elway.

The Giants opening drive consumed 9 minutes and 59 seconds, making it the longest drive in Super Bowl history. The drive was 27 seconds longer than the previous record, which the Giants had set in winning Super Bowl XXV against the Buffalo Bills.

Due to the length of the Giants&#x27; opening drive (which itself contained a record 4 third-down conversions), the first quarter featured only two possessions, a record for an opening quarter.

The three lead changes in the fourth quarter were also a Super Bowl record.

Although not a record, the 17 points scored by the Giants was the fewest points for a Super Bowl victor since Super Bowl IX.

This was the seventh consecutive Super Bowl where one team made the first score and the opponent made the second; that is a record.

<text>Mrs. Claus, (also known as Mrs. Santa Claus, Mrs. Santa, Mother Christmas or Mrs. Christmas) in British English, is the legendary wife of Santa Claus, the Christmas gift-bringer in Western Christmas tradition.

==Origins==
The wife of Santa Claus is first mentioned in the short story &quot;A Christmas Legend&quot; (1849), by James Rees, a Philadelphia-based Christian missionary. In the story, an old man and woman, both carrying bundles on their backs, are given shelter in a home on Christmas Eve as weary travelers. The next morning, the children of the house find an abundance of gifts for them, and the couple is revealed to be not &quot;old Santa Claus and his wife&quot;, but the hosts&#x27; long-lost elder daughter and her husband in disguise.

Mrs. Santa Claus is mentioned by name in the pages of the &quot;Yale Literary Magazine&quot; in 1851, where the student author (whose name is given only as &quot;A. B.&quot;) writes of the appearance of Santa Claus at a Christmas party:
:[I]n bounded that jolly, fat and funny old elf, Santa Claus. His array was indescribably fantastic. He seemed to have done his best, and we should think, had Mrs. Santa Claus to help him.

An account of a Christmas musicale at the State Lunatic Asylum in Utica, New York in 1854 included an appearance by Mrs. Santa Claus, with baby in arms, who danced to a holiday song.

A passing reference to Mrs. Santa Claus was made in an essay in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1862; and in the comic novel &quot;The Metropolites&quot; (1864) by Robert St. Clar, she appears in a woman&#x27;s dream, wearing &quot;Hessian high boots, a dozen of short, red petticoats, an old, large, straw bonnet&quot; and bringing the woman a wide selection of finery to wear.
A woman who may or may not be Mrs. Santa Claus appeared in the children&#x27;s book &quot;Lill in Santa Claus Land and Other Stories&quot; by Ellis Towne, Sophie May and Ella Farman, published in Boston in 1878. In the story, little Lill describes her imaginary visit to Santa&#x27;s office (not in the Arctic, incidentally):
: &quot;There was a lady sitting by a golden desk, writing in a large book, and Santa Claus was looking through a great telescope, and every once in a while he stopped and put his ear to a large speaking-tube.

: &quot;Presently he said to the lady, &#x27;Put down a good mark for Sarah Buttermilk. I see she is trying to conquer her quick temper.&#x27;

:Two bad ones for Isaac Clappertongue; he&#x27;ll drive his mother to the insane asylum yet.

Later, Lill&#x27;s sister Effie ponders the tale:

: Effie sank back in the chair to think. She wished Lill had found out how many black marks she had, and whether that lady was Mrs. Santa Clausand had, in fact, obtained more accurate information about many things.

Much as in &quot;The Metropolites&quot;, Mrs. Santa Claus appears in a dream of the author Eugene C. Gardner in his article &quot;A Hickory Back-Log&quot; in &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine (1887), with an even more detailed description of her dress:
: She was dressed for traveling and for cold weather. Her hood was large and round and red but not smooth, – it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted of a series of rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller toward the back until they terminated in a big button that was embellished with a knot of green ribbon. Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally. The broad, white ruffle of her lace cap projected several inches beyond the front of the hood and waved back and forth like the single leaves of a great white poppy, as she nodded emphatically in her discourse.

: Her outer garment was a bright colored plaid worsted cloak reaching to within about six inches of the floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which hung a short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit at the side of the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of paper covered with figures. The left arm on which she carried a large basket or bag – I couldn&#x27;t tell which – was hidden by the ample folds of the garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant.

Mrs. Claus proceeds to instruct the architect Gardner on the ideal modern kitchen, a plan of which he includes in the article.
Santa Claus&#x27; wife made her most active appearance yet by Katharine Lee Bates in her poem &quot;Goody Santa Claus on a Sleigh Ride&quot; (1889). &quot;Goody&quot; is short for &quot;Goodwife&quot;, i.e., &quot;Mrs.&quot;

==20th century==

The character recurred throughout mass media of the time, with notable literary examples including the 1914 one-act play &quot;Mrs. Santa Claus, Militant&quot; by Bell Elliott Palmer, the 1923 story &quot;The Great Adventure of Mrs. Santa Claus&quot; by Sarah Addington illustrated by Gertrude Kay, and the 1963 children&#x27;s book &quot;How Mrs. Santa Claus Saved Christmas&quot; by Phyllis McGinley. 

In popular recordings, Nat King Cole released the 1953 song &quot;Mrs. Santa Claus&quot; with accompaniment by Nelson Riddle&#x27;s orchestra, while comedy duo Cheech and Chong had a hit with &quot;Santa Claus and His Old Lady&quot; in 1971.

On television, Mrs. Claus was voiced by Shirley Booth in the 1974 stop-action animated special &quot;The Year Without a Santa Claus&quot;, and portrayed by Angela Lansbury as the protagonist of the 1996 live-action musical &quot;Mrs. Santa Claus&quot;.

==21st century==
Boost Mobile created some controversy with a 2009 ad featuring Mrs. Claus. British company Marks &amp; Spencer received positive attention for their 2016 marketing campaign based on a modern feminist interpretation of Mrs. Claus. In 2018, there was an increasing demand for holiday appearances of Mrs. Claus as a standalone character separate from Santa Claus.

In 2023, Sheryl Lee Ralph became the first celebrity and the first black woman to play Mrs. Claus in the history of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

<text>The Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway (DM&amp;IR) , informally known as the Missabe Road, was a railroad operating in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin that used to haul iron ore and later taconite to the Great Lakes ports of Duluth and Two Harbors, Minnesota. Control of the railway was acquired on May 10, 2004, by the Canadian National Railway (CN) when it purchased the assets of Great Lakes Transportation.

== History ==

The DM&amp;IR was formed by the merger in 1937 of the Duluth, Missabe and Northern Railway (DM&amp;N) and the Spirit Lake Transfer Railway. The following year, the Duluth and Iron Range Rail Road (D&amp;IR) and Interstate Transfer Railway were added. All of these had been leased by the DM&amp;N since 1930.

The D&amp;IR was formed in 1874 by Charlemagne Tower to haul iron ore from the Minnesota Iron Co. in Tower, Minnesota, to the new Lake Superior port of Two Harbors, Minnesota. On July 31, 1884, the D&amp;IR carried its first ore shipment from the Soudan Mine. In 1887, the D&amp;IR was acquired by Illinois Steel Company, which itself became part of the new United States Steel Corporation (USS) in 1901.

After high-grade Mesabi iron ore was discovered near Mountain Iron, Minnesota by the Seven Iron Men, the D&amp;IR was asked to build a branch line to serve this area, but declined. So in 1891, the Merritts incorporated the DM&amp;N, which shipped its first load of iron ore to Superior, Wisconsin, in October 1892. The following year, the Merritts expanded the DM&amp;N by laying track to Duluth, Minnesota, where they built an ore dock. But this expansion left the Merritts on shaky financial ground, and in 1894, John D. Rockefeller gained control of the railway. In 1901, Rockefeller sold the DM&amp;N to USS.

From 1901 to 1938, the two railways were owned by USS and operated separately. Total ore hauled by the two railroads peaked in 1929 at and dropped to in 1932.

=== Merger ===
By July 1938, the two railways merged to form the DM&amp;IR. The two operating divisions, the &quot;Missabe&quot; and the &quot;Iron Range&quot;, were based upon the predecessor roads. As the United States entered the Second World War, the iron ore tonnage moving over the &quot;Missabe Road&quot; accelerated from a little over in 1938, past in 1939, then to almost in 1940 and past in 1941.

The first eight of DM&amp;IR&#x27;s class M 2-8-8-4 Yellowstone locomotives were delivered by Baldwin Locomotive Works in spring 1941. As well as the Yellowstones, the DM&amp;IR had heavy 2-8-8-2 articulated&#x27;s (also Class M), 2-8-2 Mikados, 2-10-2 Santa Fe&#x27;s and eventually 2-10-4 Texas types from B&amp;LE. Ore movement was nearly in 1942 and the War Production Board allowed the Missabe to order ten more Yellowstones, delivered in 1943. The 2-8-8-4&#x27;s were slowly retired in the latter half of the &#x27;50s and the last remaining served until around 1960.

=== Dieselization and post-war growth===
After World War II, the DM&amp;IR hauled increasing tonnage to the ore docks along Lake Superior, reaching a record of over 49 million tons in 1953. That year the first diesel locomotives, EMD SW9s, arrived on the railway. In 1954, a set of Baldwin DR-4-4-15 &quot;Sharknose&quot; diesels arrived from the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern (a fellow U.S. Steel railroad), though they were returned to Baldwin Locomotive Works when the EJ&amp;E contract expired in 1955. Dieselization continued with the purchase of several EMD SD9 road switchers the following year, while the last revenue steam run occurred in 1962.

Passenger service on the Missabe division ended in 1957 and completely ceased system-wide in 1961.

As the supply of high-quality iron ore dwindled, mines and pits were closing across Minnesota&#x27;s iron ranges. The DM&amp;IR&#x27;s ore docks in Two Harbors closed in 1963 and did not reopen until 1966. The Missabe Road was saved by the passage on November 3, 1963, of the Taconite Amendment to the Minnesota State Constitution (the amendment restricted the state&#x27;s ability to tax a taconite industry for 25 years). The passage of the amendment accelerated the creation of the taconite mining industry in Northern Minnesota. The Eveleth Taconite Company was formed in 1964 and on April 8, 1966, the took on the first load of Eveleth taconite pellets, about . The taconite era on the Missabe had begun.

===Ownership and CN merger===
In 1988, U.S. Steel, now USX, spun off the DM&amp;IR and their other ore railroads and shipping companies into the subsidiary Transtar, then sold majority control to the Blackstone Group and USX. In 2001, the DM&amp;IR and other holdings were spun off from Transtar into the company Great Lakes Transportation (GLT), which was fully owned by the Blackstone Group. For the first time in more than 100 years DM&amp;IR was no longer associated with U.S. Steel. In late 2003, the Blackstone Group agreed to sell GLT to Canadian National Railway and the purchase was completed on May 10, 2004.

==Merger with Wisconsin Central==
In December 2011, the Duluth, Missabe &amp; Iron Range Railway was merged into Wisconsin Central Ltd., which is also controlled by Canadian National Railway. This merger was intended to increase efficiency.

<text>A billiard hall, also known as a pool hall, snooker hall, pool room or pool parlour, is a place where people get together for playing cue sports such as pool, snooker or carom billiards. Such establishments commonly serve alcohol and often have arcade games, slot machines, card games, darts, foosball and other games. Some billiard halls may be combined or integrated with a bowling alley.

==History==
Pool and billiards developed as an indoor option to substitute for games such as croquet that were played on lawns. Dedicated venues began to appear in the 19th century, and by the early 20th century, billiard and pool halls were common in many countries; in 1915 there were 830 in Chicago.

In North America in the 1950s and 1960s especially, pool halls in particular were perceived as a social ill by many, and laws were passed in many jurisdictions to set age limits at pool halls and restrict gambling and the sale of alcohol. The song &quot;Trouble&quot; in the 1957 hit musical &quot;The Music Man&quot; lampooned this prejudice (even contrasting carom billiards, requiring &quot;judgement, brains, and maturity&quot;, versus pool, said to be a gateway to laziness, gambling, smoking and philandering). Public perception had become less critical by the 1990s.

By the 2010s, with competition from a growing number of competing entertainment venues, as well as the availability of online gambling, revenue from the operation of billiard halls in the United States had declined significantly. In Korea, on the other hand, the pool halls are becoming more popular after years of decline.

== In popular culture ==

Pool halls feature prominently in the novel and film &quot;The Hustler&quot;, and their sequel book and movie, &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, as well as other pool films such as &quot;Poolhall Junkies&quot; and &quot;Shooting Gallery&quot;. The historic depth of the American pool hall subculture was touched on in &quot;The Color of Money&quot; in various ways, including dialogue extolling the virtues of particular landmark venues, the disappointment at discovering one such hall&#x27;s closure, a comment that regulars at a well-known hall &quot;never leave the street&quot; it is on, and the return of a pool hall janitor in &quot;The Hustler&quot; as a hall owner decades later in the sequel.

<text>Seymour &quot;Sy&quot; Abraham Liebergot (born February 15, 1936, in Camden, New Jersey) is a retired NASA flight controller, serving during the Apollo program. Liebergot was an EECOM controller and was responsible for the electrical and environmental systems on board the Command Module. In 1970, he was part of the team that guided Apollo 13 back to Earth following the explosion that crippled the spacecraft.

He began his career in 1963 with North American Aviation after graduating from California State University, Los Angeles. In 1964, he came to NASA. Liebergot was an Assistant Flight Director on Apollo 4, then an EECOM flight controller on Apollo 8–15. On Apollo 17, he served as CSSB SPAN (SPacecraft ANalysis room) Support. He continued as a controller in the Skylab and ASTP missions.

== Early life and education ==
Seymour “Sy” Abraham Liebergot was born on February 15, 1936, in Camden, New Jersey, the second child of parents Ida née Soloff and Solomon “Sol” Liebergot. His paternal grandparents immigrated from Kyiv, Ukraine, and his maternal grandparents immigrated from Novosibkov, Russia to the U.S. Sy experienced an unstable and rough childhood. Though money was scarce, his father gambled, drank, and had many gangster friends and enemies. Ida spiraled into a nervous breakdown when Sol had an affair, attempting to kill Sy and his sister Phyllis in 1942. Ida was permanently institutionalized. Sol married the woman he had an affair with, and they later bore three more children. Sol constantly uprooted his family, moving from place to place in order to escape danger from his debts, and he neglected his family and often beat Sy.

After graduating high school in 1953, Sy worked as a copy boy at the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. In 1954, after turning 18, he decided to join the Army to take some time to receive technical training and figure out his life plans. He was stationed in Fort Huachuca and the Yuma Test Station, where he fulfilled weather activity duties. Sy was honorably discharged in 1957.

That same year, he moved to Los Angeles, CA and married his first wife, Deanna Cohen. He decided to attend college for Electrical Engineering and enrolled at the Los Angeles City Junior College (LACC) for his first two years of study. He simultaneously worked as a shoe salesman for five years to support himself and his family. Liebergot’s first daughter, Shelli Lyn was born in 1958 and his twin sons, Mark Daniel and Scot Alan, were born in 1960. He graduated from LACC after five semesters and enrolled in California State University at Los Angeles (CSLA) to finish the last two years of his degree.

Liebergot later moved to Houston to work for NASA. There, he participated in various social activities. He joined the Space City Ski Club (SCSC) in 1972, eventually becoming the President of the club and ultimately president of the statewide ski club organization, the Texas Ski Council. Liebergot also participated in chili cooking competitions with some friends, including the International Chili Championship in 1982. In 1988, Liebergot started singing lessons again (the last time was in high school), and he completed Scuba Divemaster training in 1989.

Liebergot and Cohen divorced in 1972. Six years later in 1978, he married Tania Andrasko. They divorced in 1984. Liebergot later met Elizabeth Craig Tharpe in 1988 at a monthly ski club meeting. They married in 1990.

== Engineering career ==
While still in college, Liebergot accepted a part-time evening job at North American Aviation (NAA) in the Space &amp; Information Systems Division (S&amp;ID) College Engineering Unit. He became an assistant supervisor a year later. Their division later won a contract with NASA to build a part of the Saturn V lunar launch rocket. In 1962, he began working full time as an engineer and finished his degree at night in two semesters.

In 1964, Liebergot joined the Flight Operations Support Group, which provided command and service module (CSM) information to NASA’s flight operations in Houston. He stayed in Dowey, CA as a lead engineer while most of the group transferred to Houston. After 18 months, he tired of his position and joined the Flight Control Division in Houston, where he was a CSM Sequential Systems specialist, an advisor in the back room.

A year and a half later, wanting to participate in more of the action, Liebergot switched employment to NASA in the Manned Spacecraft Center’s Operations Control Room (MOCR), starting his career in flight control as the Apollo program was beginning.

In the 1966 AS-201 (Apollo/Saturn) mission, the first CSM test flight, Liebergot was still contracted to NASA and he served in the back room as a Sequential Systems specialist.

Becoming a NASA employee later that year, Liebergot served as the Operations &amp; Procedures Officer (O&amp;P) in the MOCR on AS-202, the second unmanned test flight.

On Apollo 4, AS-501, Liebergot became the Assistant Flight Director (AFD), assisting the Flight Director (FD) in his duties and serving as a backup for him.

After that mission, Liebergot switched to the Systems Branch. In Apollo 7 in 1968, he worked in the Staff Support Room (SSR) as the flight control division representative in the Spacecraft Analysis Room (SPAN).

Liebergot started as an Electrical, Environmental and COMmunication systems (EECOM) flight controller trainee on Apollo 8. From Apollo 9 through Apollo 15, he served as the CSM EECOM. Liebergot was assigned as the Lead EECOM in Apollo 14 because of his role in the Apollo 13 mission, for which he is well known for. In Apollo 16, Liebergot worked as the CSSB SPAN Systems position, supporting the new EECOM. He continued as CSSB SPAN support in Apollo 17. The SPAN room connected the engineering and flight controlling divisions.

After the end of the Apollo program, Liebergot continued in the Skylab Earth-orbit mission as Electrical, General Instrumentation &amp; Life Support (EGIL) flight controller, which had more systems to monitor than the CSM EECOM, and with the ability to control some systems from the console. He trained as an EGIL after Apollo 15.

In the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) in concert with the Russians, Liebergot served as the Lead EECOM. He was awarded the NASA Commendation Award for his leadership role.

With the close of ASTP, Liebergot moved to work on the Shuttle spacecraft as Lead EECOM, gathering knowledge and developing new procedures and rules. He designed the Free Water Collection System.

Losing passion for the job, Liebergot retired from active flight control in 1976.

In 1979, Liebergot began to work with other engineers on the Space Station to write a program plan. Along with former LM Control flight controller Hal Loden, they wrote the Operations section of the program plan.

When the Space Station Program Office was created in 1981 at the Johnson Space Center (JSC), Liebergot joined the Customer Integration Office.

In 1988, Liebergot retired early and ended his career at NASA. He soon found a job at Rockwell International in the Shuttle Program Office at JSC working for the program director as a SPAN back room advisor.

A couple of years later, Liebergot was hired to help with the Weightless Environment Training Facility (WETF) at the JSC. As a Senior Project Engineer for the ISS, he directed the designing of element trainers for the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory for the ISS (water training pool).

In 1993, Liebergot transferred to work in the ISS Configuration Management organization of the company as a Senior Configuration Management Analyst, in which he tracked the equipment entering and leaving the ISS.

== Apollo 13 ==
The Apollo 13 mission launched on April 11, 1970. Liebergot was 34 years old and the EECOM on shift when the malfunction occurred. 55 hours into the mission, at the last hour of his shift, Liebergot requested a tank stir before the crew went to sleep because the quality sensor reading for Oxygen Tank 2 had failed earlier. There were two liquid oxygen and two liquid hydrogen tanks on the spacecraft. In space, they became more fog-like and separated into different layers. The stir involved turning on two fans in each storage tank to mix the contents.

The wiring inside Oxygen Tank 2 was bare and cracked, so as astronaut Jack Swigert flipped the four switches, Tank 2 exploded, which also caused Tank 1 to start leaking. The shock closed the valves to fuel cells 1 and 3 as well, leaving only a third of the electrical power generation system working.

When data started appearing abnormally, the responsibility fell on Liebergot. He initially thought it was an instrumentation problem, but other flight controllers also started having abnormalities, indicating a bigger problem was at hand. Liebergot worked with his back room support to figure out the issue, giving the astronaut crew instructions, and they eventually realized that they had lost two fuel cells. It was not an instrumentation error. Time was limited with the remaining oxygen tank to the CSM leaking and only one fuel cell remaining. The mission turned into one to save the crew and deliver them back to Earth safely.

If the cryo tanks were stirred later in the mission and the tanks/fuel cells lost later, the crew may not have been able to be saved. Liebergot was part of the &quot;Apollo 13&quot; Mission Operations Team awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their efforts to successfully save the astronauts.

==In popular culture==
In the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, Liebergot was played by Clint Howard, the brother of director Ron Howard.

<doc id="1259449" wikidata="Q170396" url="?curid=1259449" title="Prince George of Greece and Denmark">
<text>Prince George of Greece and Denmark (, : &quot;Geórgios&quot;; 24 June 1869 – 25 November 1957) was the second son and child of George I of Greece and Olga Konstantinovna of Russia, and is remembered chiefly for having once saved the life of his cousin the future Emperor of Russia, Nicholas II in 1891 during their visit to Japan together. He served as high commissioner of the Cretan State during its transition towards independence from Ottoman rule and union with Greece, under the title the Prince of Candia.

==Youth==
From 1883, George lived at Bernstorff Palace near Copenhagen with Prince Valdemar of Denmark, his father&#x27;s younger brother. The queen had taken the boy to Denmark to enlist him in the Danish royal navy and consigned him to the care of Valdemar, who was an admiral in the Danish fleet. Feeling abandoned by his father on this occasion, George would later describe to his fiancée the profound attachment he developed for his uncle from that day forward.

In 1891, George accompanied his cousin the Tsesarevich Nicholas on his voyage to Asia, and saved him from an assassination attempt in Japan, in what became known as the Ōtsu Incident by parrying a blow from the assasin&#x27;s sabre with his cane.

==Greek endeavours==

George, along with his brothers Constantine and Nicholas, were involved with the organization of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. George served as president of the Sub-Committee for Nautical Sports. He served as a judge for the weightlifting competition, and demonstrated his strength by clearing the weights at the end of the event.

Although much of modern Greece had been independent since the 1820s, Crete remained in Ottoman hands. For the rest of the 19th century, there had been many rebellions and protests on the island. A Greek force arrived to annex the island in 1897 and the Great Powers acted, occupying the island and dividing it into British, French, Russian and Italian areas of control.

In 1898, Turkish troops were ejected and a national government was set up, still nominally under Ottoman suzerainty. Prince George, not yet thirty, was made High Commissioner, and a joint Muslim-Christian assembly was part-elected, part-appointed. However, this was not enough to satisfy Cretan nationalists.

Eleftherios Venizelos was the leader of the movement to unite Crete with Greece. He had fought in the earlier revolts and was now a member of the Assembly, acting as minister of justice to Prince George. They soon found themselves opposed. George, a staunch royalist, had assumed absolute power. Venizelos led the opposition to this. In 1905, however, he summoned an illegal revolutionary assembly in Theriso, in the hills near Chania, the then capital of the island, the &quot;Theriso revolt&quot;.

During the revolt, the newly created Cretan Gendarmerie remained faithful to George. In this difficult period, the Cretan population were divided: in the 1906 elections the pro-Prince parties took 38,127 votes, while pro-Venizelos parties took 33,279. But the Gendarmerie managed to execute its duties without taking sides. Finally, British diplomats brokered a settlement and in September 1906 George was replaced by former Greek prime minister Alexandros Zaimis, and left the island. In 1908, the Cretan Assembly unilaterally declared &quot;enosis&quot; (union) with Greece.

In October 1912 George returned from Paris to Athens so that he could join the naval ministry as Greece prepared for war against Turkey. Later he served as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to King George who, however, was assassinated in March 1913. George went to Copenhagen to settle his father&#x27;s financial affairs there, as he had never ceased to be a Prince of Denmark.

==Marriage and family==
Following a Parisian luncheon between King George and Prince Roland Bonaparte in September 1906 during which the king agreed to the prospect of a marriage between their children, George met Roland&#x27;s daughter, Princess Marie Bonaparte (2 July 1882 – 21 September 1962) on 19 July 1907 at the Bonapartes&#x27; home in Paris. A member of one of the non-imperial branches of the Bonaparte dynasty, she was an heiress to the Blanc casino fortune through her mother.

Although a homosexual, who lived most of the year with his uncle Prince Valdemar of Denmark with whom he had a life-long relationship, he dutifully courted her for twenty-eight days. He confided to her that he had experienced major disappointments when his roles in the Otsu incident and the Cretan governorship were misconstrued and under-appreciated by both individuals and governments who he felt should have known better. He also admitted that, contrary to what he knew were her hopes, he could not commit to living in France permanently since he had to remain prepared to undertake royal duties in Greece or Crete if summoned to do so. Once his proposal of marriage was tentatively accepted, the bride&#x27;s father was astonished when George waived any contractual clause guaranteeing an allowance or inheritance from Marie; she would retain and manage her own fortune (a trust yielding 800,000 francs &quot;per annum&quot;) and only their future children would receive legacies.

George wed Marie civilly in Paris on 21 November 1907, and in a Greek Orthodox ceremony in Athens the following December, during which George&#x27;s uncle Valdemar served as the &quot;koumbaros&quot;. By March Marie was pregnant and, as agreed, the couple returned to France to take up residence. When George brought his bride to Bernstorff for the first family visit, Valdemar&#x27;s wife Marie d&#x27;Orléans was at pains to explain to Marie Bonaparte the intimacy which united uncle and nephew, so deep that at the end of each of George&#x27;s several yearly visits to Bernstorff, he would weep, Valdemar would take sick, and the women learned the patience not to intrude upon their husbands&#x27; private moments. During the first of these visits, Marie Bonaparte and Valdemar found themselves engaging in the kind of passionate intimacies she had looked forward to with her husband who, however, only seemed to enjoy them vicariously, sitting or lying beside his wife and uncle. On a later visit, Marie Bonaparte carried on a passionate flirtation with Prince Aage, Valdemar&#x27;s eldest son. In neither case does it appear that George objected, or felt obliged to give the matter any attention. However, George criticized Marie d&#x27;Orléans to his wife, alleging that she drank too much and was having an affair with his uncle&#x27;s stablemaster. But Marie Bonaparte found no fault with her husband&#x27;s aunt, rather, she admired the forbearance and independence of Valdemar&#x27;s wife under circumstances which caused her bewilderment and estrangement from her own husband.

From 1913 to early 1916, George&#x27;s wife carried on an intense flirtation, then an affair until May 1919 with French prime minister Aristide Briand. In 1915 Briand wrote to Marie that, having come to know and like Prince George, he felt guilty about their secret passion. George tried to persuade him that Greece, officially neutral during World War I but suspected of sympathy for the Central Powers, really hoped for an Allied victory: He may have influenced Briand to support the disastrous Allied expedition against the Turks at Salonika. When the prince and princess returned in July 1915 to France following a visit to the ailing King Constantine I in Greece, her affair with Briand had become notorious and George expressed a restrained jealousy. By December 1916 the French fleet was bombing Athens and in Paris Briand was suspected, alternately, of having seduced Marie in a futile attempt to bring Greece over to the Allied side, or of having been seduced by her to oust Constantine and set George upon the Greek throne.

Although he was on friendly terms with his wife&#x27;s mentor, Sigmund Freud, in 1925 George asked Marie to give up her work as a psychoanalyst to devote herself to their family life, but she declined. When he learned from the newspapers in 1938 that his only son had married a Russian commoner, George forbade him to return home and refused ever to meet his wife.

Prince George and Princess Marie had two children, &quot;Petros&quot; and &quot;Evgenia&quot;.
* Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark (1908–1980); an anthropologist, who forfeited his dynastic rights in Greece upon marriage to a twice-divorced commoner. No children.
* Princess Eugénie of Greece and Denmark (1910–1988); married, firstly, Prince Dominic Radziwill (1939), whom she divorced in 1946. Her second husband was HSH Prince Raimondo della Torre e Tasso, Duke of Castel Duino, whom she married in 1949 and divorced in 1965. She had children from both marriages.

In 1948, Prince George was named as one of the sponsors/godparents of his grandnephew Prince Charles of the United Kingdom (later King Charles III) along with King George VI, King Haakon VII of Norway, Queen Mary, Princess Margaret, the Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven, Pamela, Lady Brabourne, and David Bowes-Lyon. 

==Death==
On 21 November 1957 Princess Marie and her husband celebrated their golden wedding anniversary. Prince George died 25 November 1957, aged eighty-eight, the longest-living dynast of the House of Oldenburg of his generation. He was buried at Tatoi Royal Cemetery with Danish and Greek flags, his wedding ring, a lock of Valdemar&#x27;s hair, a photo of Valdemar, and earth from Bernstorff. Prince George was the last living child of King George and Queen Olga.

Georgioupolis, a coastal resort between Chania and Rethimno, was named after Prince George.

<doc id="1259457" wikidata="Q464511" url="?curid=1259457" title="The Gypsy Baron">
<text>The Gypsy Baron () is an operetta in three acts by Johann Strauss II which premiered at the Theater an der Wien on 24 October 1885. Its German libretto by Ignaz Schnitzer is based on the unpublished 1883 story &quot;Saffi&quot; by Mór Jókai. Jokai later published a novel &quot;A cigánybáró&quot; (&quot;&quot;) in 1885 using an expanded version of this same story.

While an operetta, &quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot; was a departure from Strauss&#x27;s earlier more comic and light hearted works; displaying more serious tones both musically and dramatically in what musicologist Andrew Lamb described as &quot;a step in Strauss’s quest for the composition of a genuine opera&quot;. During the composer&#x27;s lifetime, the operetta enjoyed great success internationally. It is considered one of Strauss&#x27;s three best stage works, along with &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (1874) and &quot;Eine Nacht in Venedig&quot; (1883).

==Composition history==
Strauss was introduced to Jókai&#x27;s story prior to its publication as a novel in Pest, Hungary in February 1883 by his third wife Adele Deutsch. He dialogued with Jókai about adapting the story into an operetta soon after. Jókai recommended the Hungarian-Austrian writer Ignaz Schnitzer to Strauss as a librettist, and the two men created the work over a two-year period from 1883 through 1885. Its genesis was rather swift and smooth, as Strauss was no stranger to the Hungarian influences apparent in the music score. Many of his earlier works also bore similar themes, such as the polka Éljen a Magyar! (&quot;Long live the Hungarians!&quot;), Op.332. Originally, Strauss and Schnitzer intended the operetta as an opera but further revisions were made and the idea of a comic opera was conceived.

Strauss&#x27; work on the operetta was interrupted in autumn 1883 due to nicotine poisoning and fainting fits and he was to recuperate in Franzensbad. Strauss&#x27; work on act 3 of the work was also interrupted when his wife Adele was taken ill and the couple left for Ostend. Not until autumn 1885 was the work finally completed, with Schnitzer making various revisions of the libretto to suit Strauss&#x27; style of composing which were not present in the latter&#x27;s previous stage works.

==Performance history==
===Austria and Hungary===
&quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot; premiered at the Theater an der Wien on 24 October 1885, and quickly became an international success; enjoying popularity during the remainder of Strauss&#x27;s life. The composer continued to alter and cut material from the original score of the operetta following its premiere. A 1990 production staged by the Zürich Opera with music director Nikolaus Harnoncourt restored music from the original score under the guidance of Strauss specialist Norbert Linke. This music had not been heard since the original 1885 performances, and Teldec released a recording of this version with Harnoncourt conducting in 1995.

The opera has been regularly performed in the opera houses of Austria and Hungary since its premiere. The Hungarian premiere took place at the in Budapest in the spring of 1886 with the composer conducting. In September 1901 the Theater an der Wien mounted a critically lauded revival of the operetta spearheaded by the theater&#x27;s then director Wilhelm Karczag at a time when Austrian operetta had been largely supplanted in Vienna by operetta works from England. The production cemented &quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot;&#x27;s place in the operatic canon and featured the popular actor Alexander Girardi in a reprisal of the role of Kálmán Zsupán from the original production. This staging of the operetta had an impact on Franz Lehár, and heavily influenced the development of his 1905 operetta &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;.

The operetta was first staged by the Vienna State Opera on December 26, 1910 with conductor Felix Weingartner leading the musical forces. That house staged an elaborate production of the work in 1976. The operetta is part of the regular repertory of the Vienna Volksoper. In 1999 the opera was staged at multiple opera houses in Vienna in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s death; including the Vienna State Opera, the Vienna Volksoper, the Wiener Kammeroper, and the Theater an der Wien.

===United States and UK===
The US premiere took place on 15 February 1886 at the Casino Theatre on Broadway with tenor William Castle in the title role and soprano Pauline Hall as Saffi. It was first staged by the Metropolitan Opera exactly 20 years later on 15 February 1906 with Andreas Dippel in the title role, Bella Alten as Saffi, Louise Homer as Czipra, Otto Goritz as Kálmán Zsupá, Marie Rappold as Arsena, and Nahan Franko conducting. Both the original Broadway and Met stagings were produced by Heinrich Conried. The Met staged the opera again in 1959 with Nicolai Gedda as Sándor Barinkay, Lisa Della Casa as Saffi, Regina Resnik as Czipra, Walter Slezak as Kálmán Zsupán, Laurel Hurley as Arsena, Paul Franke as Ottokar, Mignon Dunn as Mirabella, and Erich Leinsdorf conducting.

Other notable performances in New York City included two presentations of the opera by the New York Philharmonic; first at Lewisohn Stadium in 1942 in a production staged by Herbert Graf and starring Margit Bokor as Saffi; and second, in 1995 with tenor Stanford Olsen in the title role at Avery Fisher Hall under the baton of Kurt Masur. The New York City Opera (NYCO) mounted the work during the company&#x27;s first season in 1944 with William Wymetal staging the opera using an English language translation by conductor George Mead. The original NYCO cast included William Horne in the title role and Marguerite Piazza and Polyna Stoska alternating as Saffi under the baton of Laszlo Halasz. The company repeated the production the following year with Gordon Dilworth as Barinkay and Brenda Lewis as Saffi.

In 1939 the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera staged the work using an English language translation by composer and lyricist Ann Ronell. This translation was published by G. Schirmer, Inc. in 1940, and has been widely used in English language recordings and stagings of the work.

In the UK &quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot; was first performed on 12 February 1935 in an amateur production. The UK professional premiere took place on 10 March 1938 at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham, as part of the Carl Rosa Opera Company&#x27;s spring season there.

Strauss&#x27;s music for &quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot; is still regularly performed today. The orchestral pieces that he furnished from the work were also well-recognised, among them, the sparkling Schatz-Walzer (Treasure Waltz), Op. 418, as well as the polkas &quot;Brautschau&quot; (&quot;Looking for a Wife&quot;), Op. 417, and &quot;Kriegsabenteuer&quot; (&quot;War Adventures&quot;), Op. 419.

== Roles ==

== Synopsis ==
&quot;Overview: The story, of the marriage of a landowner (returned from exile) and a gypsy girl who is revealed as the daughter of a Turkish pasha, and the rightful owner of a hidden treasure, involves a fortune-telling Romany queen, a self-important mayor, a rascally commissioner, a military governor, a band of gypsies and a troop of hussars.&quot;

:Place: Hungary
:Time: Late 18th century

===Act 1===
&quot;A swampy riverside region near the town of Timișoara&quot;

The distant scene is dominated by a derelict castle. In the foreground is a partly deserted village with only one reasonably prosperous-looking house. In a particularly disreputable hut there lives an old gypsy woman named Czipra. The boatmen can be heard singing at their work. Ottokár, son of Mirabella who is governess to Arsena (daughter of a miserly old farmer Zsupán) is digging for treasure which he fondly believes to be buried somewhere around. This is his daily routine, and the more he looks without success, the worse his temper becomes. Czipra looks out of her window and makes fun of his efforts. She has been watching him for weeks and has a low opinion of his wasting time on this activity while the other Gypsies are out doing an &quot;honest&quot; day&#x27;s work. She tells him that if he continues with this fruitless quest, he will end up penniless and never marry, as he hopes, Arsena.

Sándor Barinkay, son of the late owner of the castle, arrives accompanied by Conte Carnero, Commissioner for Oaths, who is here to sort things out for him. The Commissioner suggests they get on with the job and call on Czipra as a witness. They send for Zsupán. In the meantime he tells Barinkay of the beautiful Arsena. To pass time Czipra tells their fortunes and reveals to Sándor Barinkay that there is happiness and fortune in store for him. He will marry a faithful wife who will, in a dream, discover where the treasure is hidden. Carnero is also told that he will recover a treasure that he has lost, which leaves him slightly puzzled as he cannot remember having had one.

Zsupán arrives and tells everyone that he is a highly successful pig-breeder adding that he lives for sausages and wine and has little time for art. He agrees to witness Barinkay&#x27;s claims but warns him that he can be a contentious neighbour. Barinkay suggests that he might marry Zsupán&#x27;s daughter and Arsena is sent for. But it is Mirabella, the governess, who first appears. It seems that she is Carnero&#x27;s long-lost wife, so part of Czipra&#x27;s prediction is immediately realised. Carnero shows little sign of delight and a rather joyless reunion takes place. Mirabella says that she had believed her husband to have been killed at the Battle of Belgrade.

Arsena arrives, heavily veiled, but though the chorus hail the bride-elect she is not so co-operative. She is in love with Ottokár. Barinkay makes a formal proposal but Arsena tells him that she is descended from the aristocracy and can only marry someone of noble birth. Zsupán and the others tell Barinkay that he must do something about this. He is left brooding but hears a gypsy girl singing a song which praises the loyalty of the Gypsies to their friends. It is Saffi, daughter of Czipra, and Barinkay is immediately attracted by her dark beauty and accepts an invitation to dine with her and Czipra. Unaware of the others watching, Ottokár meets Arsena and they vow their eternal love for each other. He gives her a locket at which point Barinkay pretends to be most indignant. The Gypsies return from their work and Czipra introduces Barinkay as their new local squire. They elect him chief of the Gypsies. Now affirmed as a gypsy baron he calls on Zsupán and asserts his noble right of the hand of Arsena. Zsupán is not all that impressed. Saffi welcomes Barinkay back to his inheritance. Ever the opportunist, Barinkay now says that he would like to marry Saffi who is as delighted as her gypsy friends. Zsupán and Arsena are now rather indignant at this turn of events and threaten reprisals.

===Act 2===
&quot;The castle at dawn the following day&quot;

Czipra reveals to Barinkay that Saffi has dreamed of the location of the treasure. They start to search and find it hidden, as she has dreamed, under a nearby rock. As they depart the Gypsies arise to start their day&#x27;s work. Zsupán appears and tells them that his cart has stuck in the mud. He orders the Gypsies to come and help him. They resent his order and steal his watch and money. His cries for help bring Carnero, Mirabella, Ottokár and Arsena on the scene, followed by Barinkay, now dressed as a gypsy baron, and Saffi. Barinkay introduces Saffi as his wife but Carnero is not satisfied that all the legal requirements have been met. They tell him the stars have guided them and the birds have witnessed their vows. This is not quite what the law demands and Mirabella and Zsupán adopt a highly moral tone about the whole affair. At this point Ottokár discovers a few of the gold coins that Barinkay has left behind and is highly excited. Barinkay soon disillusions him by telling him that the treasure has already been found. At this moment, a recruiting party arrives under the command of Barinkay&#x27;s old friend, Count Peter Homonay. He is looking for recruits to fight in the war against Spain. Zsupán and Ottokár are press-ganged into the army. Carnero calls on Homonay to give his official support to the view that Barinkay and Saffi&#x27;s marriage is illegal but Homonay supports Barinkay. Further complications, however, are revealed. Czipra tells them that Saffi is not really her daughter but the child of the last Pasha of Hungary, a real princess. Barinkay is once more deflated, realising that he cannot marry anyone of such exalted rank, though Saffi says that she will always love him. Barinkay decides that he too will join the Hussars and the men march away leaving behind three broken hearted ladies.
===Act 3===
&quot;Vienna&quot;

Everyone is celebrating after a victorious battle. Zsupán appears and tells of his own, somewhat inglorious, exploits in Spain. Homonay, Barinkay and Ottokár reveal that they are heroes of battle and have been made into genuine noblemen. There is now no objection to the marriage of Saffi and Barinkay or Ottokár and Arsena. It is a truly happy ending.

<doc id="1259523" wikidata="Q7501452" url="?curid=1259523" title="Shoreline School District">
<text>The Shoreline School District (No. 412) is a public school district in King County, Washington, United States of America, which serves the cities of Shoreline and Lake Forest Park. It currently enrolls 9,456 students, and staffs 1,019 employees as of the 2020–2021 school year. It is located right on the boundary between King County and Snohomish County.

The District currently controls 15 schools; 1 Early Learning Center, 9 elementary schools, 1 K–8 STEM school, 2 middle schools and 2 high schools, Shorecrest and Shorewood. Former school buildings have been reused for many tasks, with the original Shoreline High School being repurposed for City of Shoreline endeavors as well as District offices. North City Elementary has been reused temporarily as Parkwood Elementary was in the process of being remodeled, and North City has also been used as a testing facility.

Following Rebecca Miner&#x27;s resignation, on July 1, 2021, Dr. Susana Reyes became Superintendent of the Shoreline School District, after a five-month search.

==Budget==
The Superintendent of the Shoreline School District makes $316,504, the sixth highest salary in the state of Washington, beating out districts like Bellevue School District which enrolls double the number of students.

The 2020–2021 school year General Fund Budget was $154,952,663.

==Demographics==
The 65,000-member communities are predominantly middle-class with a high percentage of college graduates and professional people. The district&#x27;s 9,560 student population is 8.3% African American, 0.6% Native Hawaiian, 13.1% Asian, 0.3% Native American, 13.8% Hispanic, and 51.5% Caucasian.

Parental involvement is high with a Parent Teacher Association that is one of the most active in the state. The district encourages parent participation at all levels.

==Construction==
Shoreline has had strong support with bond and levy measures from the district&#x27;s voters. In February 2010, voters approved a bond issue for the modernization/replacement of both Shorecrest and Shorewood High Schools. The new Shorewood High School opened in the fall of 2013. Shorecrest opened its new gymnasium in September 2012, the Performing Arts Building in early 2013, and the main academic building in early 2014.

In February 2017, voters approved a bond issue to rebuild Parkwood Elementary, and both middle schools. The new Parkwood opened in the fall of 2019. The new middle schools opened in the fall of 2020.

==Technology==
With strong support from voters in approving the 2010 technology levy, Shoreline School District piloted an iPad program for students at Shorewood High School for the 2011–2012 school year with considerable success. For 2012–2013, the program was expanded to Shorecrest High School, and all students in grades 9 to 12 could&#x27;ve received an iPad for use both at school and at home.

As of the 2018–2019 school year, the high schools participate in a school Chromebook program, which allows students the use of a Lenovo Chromebook for the completion of schoolwork. The program is run by the school district.

==Schools==
===Early Learning===
The Edwin T. Pratt Early Learning Center opened January 7, 2019, and offers preschool, special education, and after school care.

===Elementary schools===
All Shoreline elementary schools serve grades kindergarten through 5th grade.
===Closed elementary schools===
North City Elementary School and Sunset Elementary School, each of which enrolled approximately 375 students, were closed at the end of the 2006–2007 school year. Several other elementary schools, originating from the Baby Boom era, closed during the 1970s and 1980s. Those schools include: Richmond Beach, Hillwood, Ronald, Aldercrest, Cedarbrook, Horizon View, Hamlin Park, Paramount Park, Cromwell Park, and Meridian.

===Middle schools===

<doc id="1259526" wikidata="Q2592666" url="?curid=1259526" title="Air Force Medal">
<text>The Air Force Medal (AFM) was a military decoration, awarded to personnel of the Royal Air Force and other British Armed Forces, and formerly to personnel of other Commonwealth countries, below commissioned rank, for &quot;an act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying, though not in active operations against the enemy&quot;. The award was discontinued in 1993 when all ranks became eligible for the Air Force Cross (AFC) as part of the reform of the British honours system.

==History==
The medal was established on 3 June 1918. It was the other ranks&#x27; equivalent to the Air Force Cross (AFC), which was awarded to commissioned officers and Warrant Officers, although the latter could also be awarded the AFC. It ranked below the AFC in order of precedence, between the Distinguished Flying Medal and the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal.

Although the new award was announced in the London Gazette on 3 June 1918, the actual Royal Warrants were not published in the London Gazette until 5 December 1919.

A bar, worn on the ribbon, could be awarded to recognise a second award of the Air Force Medal.

Recipients are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;AFM&quot;.

The first two awards appeared in the London Gazette on 3 June 1918, to:
* 11680 Serjeant Samuel James Mitchell (of Handsworth, Birmingham).
* 106100 Serjeant Frederick Charles Tucker (of Birtley, Durham).
Twenty-nine awards appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette of 8 February 1919.

The first awards of a bar to the Air Force Medal were announced on 26 December 1919, to two sergeants in the Australian Flying Corps, for providing support to a pioneering flight from London to Australia:
* 275 Sergeant James Mallett Bennett, A.F.M.
* 8974 Sergeant Walter Henry Shiers, A.F.M.

In 1979 eligibility for a number of British awards, including the AFM, was extended to permit posthumous awards. Until that time, only the Victoria Cross and a mention in dispatches could be awarded posthumously.

In 1993, the AFM was discontinued, as part of the review of the British honours system, which recommended removing distinctions of rank in respect of awards for bravery. Since then, the Air Force Cross, previously only open to Commissioned and Warrant Officers, has been awarded to personnel of all ranks.

The AFM had also been awarded by Commonwealth countries but by the 1990s most, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, had established their own honours systems and no longer recommended British honours.

==Numbers of awards==
Between 1918 and 1993 approximately 942 medals and ten second award bar were awarded. 

Awards include several to the Royal Navy and the Army Air Corps. Fifteen honorary awards were made to aircrew from foreign countries, one in 1919 and 14 for service during the Second World War. Civilians were eligible for the AFM from 1919 to 1932, three awards being made.

==Description==

* The AFM is an oval silver medal, wide with a height of , with the following design:
* The obverse shows the effigy and titles of the reigning sovereign:
:* King George V bare headed (1918-29)
:* King George V in crown and robes (1930–1937)
:* King George VI with &#x27;IND: IMP:&#x27; (Indian Emperor) in the inscription (1938–1949)
:* King George VI without &#x27;IND: IMP:&#x27; in the inscription (1949–1953)
:* Queen Elizabeth II (1953–1993)
:The three most common obverse designs were:

* The reverse shows Hermes (facing right), mounted on a hawk in flight and bestowing a wreath, all contained within a narrow laurel wreath band. The date &quot;1918&quot; appears behind Hermes on the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II versions of the medal.
* The suspension consists of two outstretched wings.
* Further awards are signified by a straight slip-on silver bar with an eagle in the centre.
* All awards have the name and service details of the recipient engraved or impressed on the rim.
* The ribbon is wide, and consists of alternate red and white stripes, wide, leaning 45 degrees to the left. A red stripe is to appear in the bottom left and upper right corners when viewed on the wearer&#x27;s chest. Until 1919, the stripes were horizontal.

<doc id="1259527" wikidata="Q613977" url="?curid=1259527" title="Yañalif">
<text>Jaꞑalif, Yenəlif, Yangalif or Yañalif (Tatar: jaꞑa əlifba/yaña älifba → jaꞑalif/yañalif, , Cyrillic: Яңалиф, &quot;new alphabet&quot;) is the first Latin alphabet used during the latinisation in the Soviet Union in the 1930s for the Turkic languages. It replaced the Yaña imlâ Arabic script-based alphabet in 1928, and was replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet in 1938–1940. After their respective independence in 1991, several former Soviet states in Central Asia switched back to Latin script, with slight modifications to the original Yañalif.

There are 33 letters in Yañalif, nine of which are vowels. The apostrophe (&#x27;) is used for the glottal stop (həmzə or hämzä) and is sometimes considered a letter for the purposes of alphabetic sorting. Other characters may also be used in spelling foreign names. The lowercase form of the letter B is ʙ (small caps B), to prevent confusion with Ь ь (I with bowl). Letter No. 33, similar to Zhuang Ƅ, is not currently available as a Latin character in Unicode, but it looks exactly like Cyrillic soft sign (Ь). Capital Ə (schwa) also looks like Russian/Cyrillic Э in some fonts. There is also a digraph in Yañalif (Ьj ьj).

==History==
The earliest written text in a Kipchak language, specifically the Cuman language, an ancestor of the modern Tatar language and written with Latin characters, is the Codex Cumanicus, dated 1303. Such texts were used by Catholic missionaries to the Golden Horde. Their Latin script ceased to be used after Gazaria was taken over by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century.

For centuries some Tatar languages as well as some other Turkic languages used a modified Arabic alphabet, İske imlâ. The deficiencies of this alphabet were both technical (abundance of positional letterforms complicated adoption of modern technology such as typewriters and teleprinters) and linguistic (Arabic language has only three vowel qualities, but Tatar has nine, which had to be mapped onto combinations and variations of the three existing vowel letters). Because of this some Turkic intelligentsia tended to use the Latin or Cyrillic script. The first attempts appeared in the mid-19th century among Azerbaijanis. At the same period the Russian missionary Nikolay Ilminsky, along with followers, invented a modified Russian alphabet for the Turkic peoples of Idel-Ural, for the purpose of Christianization; Muslim Tatars did not use his alphabet.

In 1908–1909 the Tatar poet Säğit Rämiyev started to use the Latin script in his works. He used several digraphs: &quot;ea&quot; for [æ], &quot;eu&quot; for [y], &quot;eo&quot; for [ɵ] and &quot;ei&quot; for [ɯ]. Arabists turned down his project, preferring to reform İske imlâ. The simplified Arabic script, known as Yaña imlâ, was used in 1920–1927.

During the Latinisation in the Soviet Union, a special &quot;Central Committee for a New Alphabet&quot; was established in Moscow. The first project for a Tatar-Bashkir Latin alphabet was published in ئشچی (&quot;Eşce&quot;, &quot;The Worker&quot;) newspaper on 18 July 1924. Sounds specific to the Bashkir language were written with digraphs. Following the publication, the &quot;Latin Dustь&quot; (&quot;friend of the Latin&quot;) society was formed in Kazan on 16 November 1924. It suggested its own version of Tatar Latin alphabet, which didn&#x27;t cover Bashkir sounds.

In 1926 the Congress of Turkologists in Baku recommended to switch all Turkic languages to the Latin script. In April 1926 the &quot;Jaꞑa Tatar Əlifвasь / Yaña tatar älifbası / Яңа Татар Әлифбасы&quot; (New Tatar Alphabet) society started its work at Kazan.

On July 3, 1927, Tatarstan officials declared Yañalif the official script of the Tatar language, replacing the Yaña imlâ script. The first variant of Yañalif did not have separate letters for K and Q (realized as K) and for G and Ğ (realized as G), V and W (realized as W). Ş (sh) looked like the Cyrillic letter Ш (she). C and Ç were realized as in Turkish and the modern Tatar Latin alphabet and later were transposed in the final version of Yañalif.

In 1928 Yañalif was reformed and remained in active use for 12 years. Some sources claim that this alphabet had 34 letters, but the last was a digraph &quot;Ьj&quot;, used for the corresponding Tatar diphthong. Another source states that the 34th letter was an apostrophe. They also give another sorting of the alphabet. (Ə after A, Ь after E)

After the introduction of Yañalif most of the books which were printed in the Arabic alphabet were withdrawn from libraries.

Using two different alphabets for Russian and Turkic languages was problematic: people had to learn two different alphabets, confusing letters of one alphabet for letters from another, and Turkic languages had to use specific typewriters instead of sharing typewriters with Russian. In order to overcome these issues, a decision was made to convert Turkic languages to Cyrillic. In 1939 the Soviet government prohibited Yañalif although it remained in use until January 1940. Yañalif was also used in Nazi gazettes for prisoners of war and propaganda during World War II. The alphabet served until the 1950s, because most of the schoolbooks were printed before World War II. Some Tatar diasporas also used Yañalif outside of the Soviet Union, for example the Tatar bureau of Radio Free Europe.

For 12 years of usage the Latin script, Arabic script (and not only Jaña imlâ, but İske imlâ too) also were used. One of the Musa Cälil&#x27;s Moabit Notebooks was written in Yañalif, and another was written in Arabic letters. Both notebooks were written in German prison, after 1939, the year when the Cyrillic script was established.

==Restoring Yañalif ==

In the 1990s some wanted to restore Yañalif, or Yañalif +W, as being appropriate for the modern Tatar phonetics. But technical problems, such as font problems and the disuse of Uniform Turkic alphabet among other peoples, forced the use of a &quot;Turkish-based alphabet&quot;. In 2000 such an alphabet was adopted by the Tatarstan government, but in 2002 it was abolished by the Russian Federation.

===Inalif===
The &quot;Internet-style&quot; alphabet named &quot;Inalif&quot; after &quot;Internet&quot; and &quot;älifba&quot; was convented in 2003 and partly it was inspired by Yañalif. The main purpose of this alphabet was standardization of texts, which are typed on a standard English keyboard, without any diacritical marks. But this is not a simple transliteration of non-English symbols of Yañalif or modern alphabet. Sounds absent from English are represented with digraphs; soft vowels are represented as a combination of the pairmate and apostrophe, apart from , corresponding to ⟨ь⟩ in Yañalif, which is represented as ⟨y⟩, probably under influence of transliteration of Russian. Like in Yañalif, ⟨j⟩ represent , and ⟨zh⟩ is used for , corresponding to ⟨ƶ⟩ in Yañalif. ⟨x⟩ isn&#x27;t used in Inalif, and ⟨kh⟩ is used instead. Other changes include: ⟨ä⟩ → ⟨a&#x27;⟩; ⟨ö⟩ → ⟨o&#x27;⟩; ⟨ü⟩ → ⟨u&#x27;⟩; ⟨ç⟩ → ⟨ch⟩; ⟨ğ⟩ → ⟨gh⟩; ⟨ñ⟩ → ⟨ng⟩; ⟨ş⟩ → ⟨sh⟩. The sorting order of Inalif isn&#x27;t specified, but in practice, the English sorting order is used. Inalif is used only on the Internet.

== Criticism ==
Tatar literary scholar Hatip Minnegulov: &quot;The replacement of the Arabic script, used by our people for more than a thousand years, with the Latin and soon the Cyrillic alphabet was a terrible blow to the continuity of the people&#x27;s memory, which can be considered as burning the bridges between the past and the present&quot;.

Jussi Ahtinen-Karsikko wrote in Finland in 1934: &quot;The change made in the footsteps of the religious indifference formed under the influence of Kemal Pasha&#x27;s French spirit&quot; felt as if &quot;a thousand-year-old precious tradition had been frivolously sacrificed in favor of a suspicious Western progressiveness&quot;.

The Head of the Middle East and Central Asia Section at the British Library, Michael Erdman, feels that the Turkic usage of Arabic script, which dates back to the 10th century when Islam was adopted by Turkic communities, is not as unsuitable as critics claim. Erdman thinks that it is entirely possible to use the script while taking into account the unique vocal features of each languages, which a vast amount of reform efforts in the Russian Empire and later Soviet Union show. He also takes aim at the claim that Arabic script is solely connected to religion and thus backwardness by showcasing modern scientific works created in this writing. Erdman reminds that millions of Turkic people, such as the Uyghurs of China and Azeris of Iran, still use the Arabic script.

It has been argued also, that the Arabic script was more unifying for Turkic peoples; &quot;The very limitations of the Arabic script might be considered as its strength. In essence, while the Arabic script was able to add letters to represent vowels, the obscuring of the same vowels allowed for easier comprehension between speakers with different pronunciations&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Flying Fish&quot; was formerly the New York City pilot boat schooner &quot;Independence.&quot; Purchased by the United States Navy at New York City on 3 August 1838 and upon joining her squadron in Hampton Roads on 12 August 1838, she was placed under command of Passed Midshipman S. R. Knox.

==Construction and service==

The &quot;Independence&quot; was built as a civilian schooner-rigged pilot boat built on 11 March 1837 by Jabex &amp; Williams shipyard. She was purchased by the United States Navy on 3 August 1838 and renamed &quot;Flying Fish&quot;.

Assigned as a tender in the U.S. Exploring Expedition of 1838–42 commanded by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; sailed with her squadron 19 August 1838 to visit Madeira and Rio de Janeiro while bound for Tierra del Fuego, where the squadron arrived early in 1839. From this point, the squadron made its first cruises toward the Antarctic Continent, which it was to discover later the same year after surveys among Pacific islands and a visit to Australia.

After the second penetration of the Antarctic, the squadron rendezvoused in New Zealand in April 1840 to survey Pacific islands northward toward the Hawaiians, where the ships were repaired late in the year. &quot;Flying Fish&quot; sailed with to resurvey some of the Samoan, Ellice, Kingsmill, and Pescadore Islands before joining the main body of the squadron on the northwest coast of America in July 1841. &quot;Flying Fish&quot; made surveys in the Columbia River and around Vancouver, then proceeded to San Francisco, from which the squadron sailed 1 November for the south Pacific. Arriving in the Philippines in mid-January 1842 &quot;Flying Fish&quot; and the other ships separated to cruise the Sulu Seas, then make a planned rendezvous at Singapore in February.

==End of service==

When the expedition stopped in Singapore on their way home, it was discovered the &quot;Flying Fish&quot; was suffering from structural problems and was unfit for further service. It was sold to an English resident for $3,700 on 24 February, 1842. The rest of the squadron sailed for home on 26 February. There are rumors that the &quot;Flying Fish&quot; was repurposed to smuggle opium, although there does not appear to be any recorded evidence of this.

<doc id="1259546" wikidata="Q29258" url="?curid=1259546" title="Burmilla">
<text>The Burmilla (a portmanteau of [[Burmese cat|Burm]]-ese and Chinch-[[Burmilla|illa]] ) is a breed of domestic cat, that originated in the United Kingdom in 1981. It is a cross between the Chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. In certain cat registries the breed falls under the Asian group, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Asian Shaded&quot;. Standards were produced in 1984, and the breed gained championship status in the United Kingdom in the 1990s.

==History==

=== Origin ===
The Burmilla was accidentally born in the cattery of Miranda von Kirchberg in the United Kingdom. Two cats, a chinchilla Persian kitten, called Jamari Sanquist, and a lilac Burmese, called Bambino Lilac Fabergé, were both awaiting a partner in different rooms. One night, the cleaner left the door open. The two cats mated, producing four kittens born in 1981; also birthing a new breed.

=== Recognition ===
In GCCF (Governing Council of the Cat Fancy), the Burmilla is considered part of the Asian group. It is accepted in FIFe as the Burmilla. Only the &quot;silver shaded&quot; and &quot;tipped&quot; varieties have been recognised in GCCF, FIFe, CCCA, ACF and CFA. As of late 2011, additionally &quot;golden shaded&quot; and &quot;tipped&quot; Burmillas are recognised within FIFe. The ACF also recognises &quot;golden shaded&quot; and &quot;tipped&quot;.

=== Australian Tiffanie ===
One governing body in Australia (Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats similar to the Burmilla, and is the semi-longhaired variety in the Asian Group. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK both are developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name&#x27;s use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

==Appearance==


===Body===
Burmillas are medium-sized with muscular, elegant bodies, tending to weigh between 3–6 kg. Their distinguishing feature is their sparkling silver coat, and distinctive &quot;make up&quot; lining the nose, lips and eyes.

===Head===
Gently rounded top of head; medium width between ears; wide at eyebrow level and jaw hinge, tapering to a short, blunt wedge. The profile shows a gentle nose break. Tip of nose and chin should be in line. Chin is firm, with good depth.

===Ears and eyes===
Medium to large, broad at base with slightly rounded tips. Ear set with slight forward tilt in profile. Eye shape is large; placed well apart at slight oblique setting; slightly curved upper; line angled toward the nose, with a fuller curved lower line. Eye colour luminous, any shade of green. Some allowance can be made for a gold or yellow tinge in kittens and young adults.

===Coat===
The Burmilla comes in two coat lengths, semi-longhair and shorthair. Semi-longhair Burmilla are known as the Tiffanie in GCCF. The most common (standard) coat is the shorthair. This is a short, close-lying coat, similar in appearance to the Burmese, but with a slightly padded feel. Due to the undercoat, it has a soft, silky feel. The recessive longhair gene inherited from the Chinchilla Persian can produce longhair Burmilla. These cats have a semi-longhair coat following the lines of the body, with a soft, silky feel and a large plumed tail. The shorthair gene is dominant and where a cat receives one of each, shorthair dominates. Two longhair Burmillas mated together produce longhair kittens, while shorthair matings depend on whether the longhair genes are carried by the shorthair parents.

===Colours===
The Burmilla sports a variety of coat colours, including black, blue, brown, chocolate and lilac. Red, cream and tortoiseshell (calico) varieties have been bred, although these colours are not recognised by CCCA in Australia. Burmilla coat colours can be expressed in either Burmese expression, or full expression. The Burmilla is now recognised in &quot;golden shaded&quot; and &quot;golden tipped&quot; in FIFe and ACF registries, but only &quot;silver shaded&quot; and &quot;silver tipped&quot; elsewhere. The Burmilla&#x27;s shading comes in two major coat patterns which relate to the depth of colour; these are &quot;tipped&quot; and &quot;shaded&quot;. Tipped Burmillas have a light dusting of colour (1/8 to 1/4) over the top of a silver or golden undercoat. In the case of &quot;silvers&quot;, these cats can appear almost white. Shaded Burmillas have 1/4 - 1/2 of their hair length pigmented, giving the appearance of a mantle of colour over the back, shoulders and outside of the legs. The smoke pattern is not a Burmilla (in GCCF these fall under the Asian Smoke-category), and in some registries is only allowed to be registered for breeding, not showing. Smokes have only a small part of the hair root in the silvery-white or golden colour, and almost all hair length is pigmented. The cats have nose leather coloured correspondingly to their coat colour and outlined in the matching coat shading colour. In addition, their paw footpads correspond to the coat colouring: black silver cats have black or dark brown paw footpads, browns (sepia blacks) have dark brown, chocolates have pinkish brown, blues have blue-grey, and lilacs have dove-grey tinged with pink.

===Colour genetics===

Since the Burmilla inherits its colour ranges from two breeds, there is also the possibility of the entire Burmese spectrum of colours; black (incl. brown or sepia black), blue, chocolate, lilac and all the O gene range, both in Burmese Expression or BCR (sepia coloured), and in Full Expression or FEx (solid/self coloured). The inheritance of the silver-gene also means that expression of colour can be variable; silver can darken and cool colour. However, since the Burmilla has a shaded coat pattern, it can be difficult to identify the various subtle shades of Burmese colouring that are recessive to the Persian colouring.

==Temperament==
The Burmilla is an irreverent and independent cat who adores its owner and displays many kitten-like characteristics, even into adulthood. In temperament they are sociable, playful and affectionate and get along well with children and other animals.

<text>Election Systems &amp; Software (ES&amp;S or ESS) is an Omaha, Nebraska-based company that manufactures and sells voting machine equipment and services. The company&#x27;s offerings include vote tabulators, DRE voting machines, voter registration and election management systems, ballot-marking devices, electronic poll books, ballot on demand printing services, and absentee voting-by-mail services.

In 2014, ES&amp;S was the largest manufacturer of voting machines in the United States, claiming customers in 4,500 localities in 42 states and two U.S. territories. As of 2014, the company had more than 450 employees, over 200 of whom are located in its Omaha headquarters. ES&amp;S is a subsidiary of the McCarthy Group. 

In 2014, ES&amp;S claimed that &quot;in the past decade alone,&quot; it had installed more than 260,000 voting systems, more than 15,000 electronic poll books, and provided services to more than 75,000 elections. The company has installed statewide voting systems in Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Virginia, and West Virginia. As of 2019 ES&amp;S claimed a U.S. market share of more than 60 percent in customer voting system installations.

The company maintains ten facilities in the United States, two field offices in Canada located in Pickering, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia, and a warehouse in Jackson, Mississippi.

==History==
=== American Information Systems ===

In October 1974, Robert J. Urosevich of Klopp Printing Company in Omaha approached Westinghouse Learning Corporation, a subsidiary of Westinghouse Corporation, asking whether the scanners Westinghouse was building for educational tests could be used to scan voting ballots. This led Westinghouse to briefly enter the ballot scanning business, and Urosevich and his brother Tod, a former IBM salesman, formed Data Mark Systems to sell and service Westinghouse voter tabulation equipment. Data Mark and Westinghouse ballot tabulation equipment had limited success through the late 1970s.
As Westinghouse withdrew from the voting business, the Urosevich brothers and several former Westinghouse employees founded a new company in August 1979, American Information Systems. AIS came out with a line of central-count ballot scanners that entered the marketplace in 1982.

=== Business Records Corporation ===
The first precinct-count ballot scanner was the Gyrex MTB-1, which came to market around 1974. The MTB-1 evolved into the MTB-2, and corporate ownership shifted from Gyrex Corporation to Valtec, in 1977, and then to Major Data Concepts, in 1979. Computer Election Systems Incorporated (CESI), the manufacturer of Votomatic punched-card voting equipment, marketed the MTB-2 as the Tally-II scanner in the early 1980s, pairing it with its own Precinct-Ballot-Conut punched-card ballot reader, the PBC.

CESI developed its own family of precinct-count and later central-count scanners, under the Optech brand name. The Optech I precinct-count scanner came to market in 1983, and saw successful use in several states. Cronus Industries, Inc., a Texas-based company, purchased CESI in 1985 and merged it with their ballot printing subsidiary, Business Records Corporation (BRC).

=== Election Products Inc. ===
Election Products Inc. was a small Virginia-based election service company. In the early 1990s, the company contracted with ILJ Corporation based in Richmond, Virginia, to develop a DRE voting machine that would be marketed as the Votronic, unrelated to an earlier ballot scanner that was marketed under the same name in 1960. This voting machine had a flat panel liquid crystal display and a touchscreen, and was no larger than a laptop computer at the time. Votronic was first used in the 1996 primary elections; one commentator said the machine resembled a large Magna Doodle.

=== Automark Technical Systems LLC ===
In 2003, Eugene Cummings filed a patent for a ballot marking device designed to provide an accessible voting interface for optical-scan voting systems.
Cummings, along with Joseph Vaneck founded Automark Technical Systems LLC to develop and manufacture the machine. Prior to this machine, the Help America Vote Act, passed in 2002, required jurisdictions in the United States that used optical scan systems install at least one DRE voting machine in each polling place.

===Mergers and antitrust actions===

American Information Systems acquired the Election Services Division of Business Records Corporation and was reincorporated as Election Systems &amp; Software, Inc. in December 1997. At the time, AIS had about 750 customers and BRC had around 1200; customers were typically county election offices. With the merger, ES&amp;S became the largest voting system vendor in the United States. The merger was delayed by the U.S. Department of Justice on antitrust grounds until ES&amp;S agreed to transfer the Optech product line to Sequoia Voting Systems, while retaining the right to sell and service Optech products to its existing customers.

Shortly after the BRC-AIS merger, ES&amp;S acquired the rights to Votronic, which they renamed iVotronic, and made major cosmetic changes to it. In their sales presentations, ES&amp;S emphasized that the iVotronic was essentially the same machine as the Votronic except for features added to bring it into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

ES&amp;S was one of the top four providers of voting equipment used in the November 2004 election. The other three were Diebold Election Systems, Sequoia Voting Systems, and Hart InterCivic.

In January 2008, ES&amp;S acquired AutoMARK Technical Systems. Under ES&amp;S&#x27;s ownership, AutoMARK&#x27;s use expanded considerably. Eight years after its acquisition by ES&amp;S, in the 2016 elections, it was used statewide in ten states, and widely used in 19 additional states.

In September 2009, ES&amp;S acquired Premier Election Solutions, formerly known as Diebold Election Systems. Following the acquisition, the Department of Justice and 14 individual states launched investigations into the transaction on antitrust grounds. 

In March 2010, the Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against ES&amp;S, seeking it to divest voting equipment systems assets it purchased in September 2009 from Premier Election Solutions in order to restore sufficient competition. The company later sold the assets to Dominion Voting Systems.

===Ownership and management===
As of June 2019, ES&amp;S was wholly owned by Government Systems, Software &amp; Services, Inc. McCarthy Group held a controlling ownership. Those with over 5% share investments in the company, as of June 2019, included Tom Burt and Tom O&#x27;Brien. Those with over 5% ownership stakes in McCarthy Group were Nancy McCarthy and Kenneth Stinson, both passive investors.

As of 2020, Burt is president and chief executive officers ES&amp;S, and O&#x27;Brien is vice president/CFO.

==Controversies==
===Voting system certifications===
In May 2013, the Election Assistance Commission certified ES&amp;S&#x27; EVS 5.0 election management system as meeting the commission&#x27;s 2005 Voluntary Voting Systems Guidelines (VVSG). Products included in EVS 5.0 are ES&amp;S&#x27; DS200 and DS850 vote tabulators.

EVS 5.0 also saw enhancements to the company&#x27;s AutoMARK software, which is designed to be compliant with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 for allowing voters with disabilities to cast ballots. In October 2012, the EAC certified ES&amp;S&#x27; Unity 3.4.0.0 election management software.

In June 2014, the Virginia Board of Elections certified EVS 5201, the first state to certify an election management system that features the ExpressVote Universal Voting System. This election system combines paper-based voting with touch screen technology that&#x27;s designed to serve every eligible voter, including those with disabilities.

The same month, following the certification of EVS 5201 was certified, Fairfax County, Virginia, purchased ExpressVote Universal Voting System. which it used for the first time in its November 2014 general election.

===Electronic poll books===
In January 2014, the City of Chicago reached an agreement with ES&amp;S to provide more than 2,100 ExpressPoll voter check-in and verification devices to support Chicago&#x27;s 1.6 million registered voters. The electronic poll books were first used in Chicago&#x27;s 2014 primary elections.

===Withdrawal and Reinstatement of InkaVote===
On August 3, 2007, California Secretary of state Debra Bowen withdrew approval of the ES&amp;S InkaVote Plus after announcing a &quot;top-to-bottom review&quot; of the voting machines certified for use in California in March 2007.
However, the InkaVote Plus was never included in the review process conducted by Bowen&#x27;s office. Bowen then approved InkaVote Plus for use by Los Angeles County and the city of Los Angeles on January 2, 2008.

===Oakland County, Michigan===
Early voters in the 2008 U.S. presidential election in Oakland County, Michigan reported instances of malfunctioning machines, complaining that they voted for one candidate and their vote was switched to another candidate. The Oakland County county clerk reported inconsistent results with some machines during testing in October.

Four years later, during the 2012 elections, ES&amp;S added wireless modem technology so officials could make secure reports via cell phones. This upgrade was designed to improve the transparency and accuracy of Oakland County&#x27;s election night reporting. The wireless technology used by Oakland County was tested by a federally accredited voting system test laboratory and subsequently tested and approved by the State of Michigan for pilot usage in the 2012 presidential election.

===2010 election problems===
On April 14, 2010, the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; reported that, &quot;about 10 percent of Cuyahoga County’s voting machines...[had] failed a pre-election test.&quot; After 20 months of investigation, the Election Assistance Commission recommended decertification of the ES&amp;S voting machines if they could not be fixed. The investigation found:
*&quot;The DS200 accepts a voted ballot but does not record the ballot on its internal counter. In addition the marks of the second ballot are not recorded.&quot;
*&quot;When a 17” ballot was inserted at an angle, the DS200 did not consistently count the mark properly. The mark registered either as a different selection than intended or did not register at all.&quot;
*The system randomly freezes and does not record the freeze in its log files. There are other events not logged, such as touch screen calibration.

In May 2013, however, the Election Assistance Commission certified the DS200 as part of ES&amp;S&#x27; EVS 5.0 election management system as meeting its 2005 Voluntary Voting Systems Guidelines (VVSG). Image of EAC certificate

===Remote access controversy===
In February 2018 article, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reported that remote-access software had been found on an election management computer system used in Pennsylvania, and quoted unnamed sources, who said &quot;ES&amp;S has in the past sometimes sold its election-management system with remote-access software preinstalled.&quot; This was used by ES&amp;S technicians to remotely access the systems via modem to troubleshoot and provide maintenance to systems they sold. The company denied this, saying &quot;none of the employees...including long-tenured employees, has any knowledge that our voting systems have ever been sold with remote-access software.&quot;

In an April 2018 letter sent to U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, Election Systems &amp; Software acknowledged that some of the election management systems the company sold for voting actually did have remote access software installed. The letter to Wyden had been in response to a question from the senator requesting clarification of the information on remote-access software in the &quot;New York Times&quot; article.

While election management systems are not the voting machines voters use to cast their ballots, they are used to program the voting machines used in a county and to count and tabulate the results from the voting machines. By installing remote access software allowing the machines to be accessed via the internet, the machines are vulnerable to being &quot;hacked&quot; remotely, allowing the counting to be altered surreptitiously, or malware to be installed to affect an election result. &quot;Motherboard&quot;, the site that originally published the story, reported that the remote access software installation was &quot;the worst decision for security short of leaving ballot boxes on a Moscow street corner.&quot;

According to its April 2018 letter, ES&amp;S claims to have stopped installing remote access software as of December 2007, which is required under the standards of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. 

=== Johnson County, Indiana ===
During the general election in November 2018, thousands of voters in Johnson County, Indiana were required to wait in line for hours as technical glitches and computer crashes caused issues throughout the county. A preliminary repor] prepared for the Indiana Secretary of State by Ball State University&#x27;s Voting System Technical Oversight Program examined the reporting errors, and a preliminary report concluded that ES&amp;S failed to report several anomalies that occurred prior to election day in violation of Indiana&#x27;s state election law.

=== Operating software vulnerabilities ===
In July 2019, the Associated Press reported that, &quot;the vast majority of 10,000 election jurisdictions nationwide use Windows 7 or an older operating system to create ballots, program voting machines, tally votes and report counts.&quot; Windows 7 reaches its &quot;end of life&quot; on January 14, 2020, meaning that Microsoft will cease providing technical support for the system, including patches to fix software vulnerabilities. For jurisdictions that already purchased systems running on Windows 7, ES&amp;S said it would work with Microsoft to provide support until jurisdictions can update them. Windows 10 was released in 2015, and it was not immediately clear how long it would take to updates and associated federal and possible state certifications and to roll out updates. The company was not at the time sure that it could be done prior to the state&#x27;s primaries, which began in February 2020. Kevin Skoglund, chief technologist at Citizens for Better Elections, said county election officials point to Election Assistance Commission and state certifications as &quot;rock-solid proof&quot; that their systems are secure, but do not realize that vendors are certifying systems under dated 2005 standards.

===Modems and certification claims===
In 2020, an independent cybersecurity investigation by the National Election Defense Coalition found voting systems still online, contrary to claims by election officials. ES&amp;S was one of three companies, including Dominion Voting Systems and Hart InterCivic, that still put modems in their machines, many of which are protected by firewalls. Security officials maintain that such firewalls can still be breached. The National Institute of Standards and Technology advises that all voting systems should be prevented from connecting to wireless networks. National Election Defense Coalition identified ES&amp;S as having sold machines with wireless modems to at least 11 states, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. In 2020, ES&amp;S informed NBC News that 14,000 DS200 tabulators with online modems were in use, a statement that contradicts their own website. NBC News also found thousands more online made by other companies. Groups like Free Speech for People and the National Election Defense Coalition maintain that ES&amp;S falsely claims their online machines are certified by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. The Commission does not certify voting machines with modems.

<doc id="1259580" wikidata="Q3503150" url="?curid=1259580" title="Distinguished Flying Medal">
<text>The Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM) was a military decoration awarded to personnel of the Royal Air Force and other British Armed Forces, and formerly to personnel of other Commonwealth countries, below commissioned rank, for &quot;exceptional valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy&quot;. The award was discontinued in 1993 when all ranks became eligible for the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) as part of the reform of the British honours system.

==History==
The medal was established on 3 June 1918. It was the other ranks&#x27; equivalent to the Distinguished Flying Cross, which was awarded to commissioned officers and Warrant Officers, although the latter could also be awarded the DFM. The decoration ranked below the DFC in order of precedence, between the Military Medal and the Air Force Medal. Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Medal are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;DFM&quot;.

Although announced in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 3 June 1918, the actual royal warrants were not published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; until 5 December 1919.

In 1979 eligibility for a number of British awards, including the DFM, was extended to permit posthumous awards. Until that time, only the Victoria Cross and a mention in dispatches could be awarded posthumously.

In 1993, the DFM was discontinued, as part of the review of the British honours system, which recommended removing distinctions of rank in respect of awards for bravery. Since then, the Distinguished Flying Cross, previously only open to Commissioned and Warrant Officers, can be awarded to personnel of all ranks.

The DFM had also been awarded by Commonwealth countries but by the 1990s most, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, had established their own honours systems and no longer recommended British honours.

==Awards==
There were two categories of award, either &quot;Immediate&quot; or &quot;Non-Immediate&quot;.

;Immediate
An &quot;Immediate&quot; award was one which was recommended by a senior officer, usually in respect of an act or acts of bravery or devotion to duty deemed to command immediate recognition. In such circumstances, the recommendation for the award was passed as quickly as possible through the laid down channels to obtain approval by the AOC-in-C of the appropriate Command to whom, from 1939, the power to grant immediate awards was designated by King George VI.

An example of an &quot;Immediate&quot; award is that to Leslie Marsh, which was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 15 February 1944.
* 1482444 Sergeant Leslie MARSH, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, No. 103 Squadron. &quot;This airman was the mid-upper gunner of an aircraft detailed to attack Mannheim one night in September, 1943. When nearing the target area the aircraft was hit by machine gun fire from a fighter. The rear gunner was killed and Sergeant Marsh was wounded in the legs. Although in great pain Sergeant Marsh remained at his post. Coolly withholding his fire until the attacker came into close range he then delivered an accurate burst which caused the enemy aircraft to break away; later it was seen to be on fire. On two occasions, more recently, his cool and determined work has played a good part in the success of the sortie. Sergeant Marsh is a model of efficiency and his example of courage and resolution has earned great praise.&quot;

;Non-immediate
&quot;Non-Immediate&quot; awards were made by the monarch on the recommendation of the Air Ministry and were to reward devotion to duty sustained over a period of time. This category of award could be made at any time during an operational tour but, in a large number of instances, the award was given to recognise the successful completion of a full tour of operational flying.

==Numbers of awards==
Between 1918 and 1993 a total of 6,967 medals, 64 second award bars and one third award bar were awarded. Over 95% of these awards were for service during the Second World War.
During the First World War, 104 Distinguished Flying Medals and two second award bars were awarded to British and Commonwealth servicemen, with a further four honorary awards to foreign combatants, three Belgians and one French airman.

The first awards of the medal appeared in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 3 June 1918, where two recipients are listed.
* F/9689 Acting Air Mechanic W./T. Albert Edward Clark (of Woodford).
* 113763 Serjeant John Charles Hagan (of Ulverston)

The first award of a bar to the Distinguished Flying Medal was announced in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 3 December 1918. It was awarded to Sergeant observer Arthur Newland, DFM who had been awarded the DFM on 21 September 1918.
In the period between the World Wars, 41 awards of the DFM were made between 1920 and 1929 and a further 39 between 1930 and 1939, along with two second award bars.

During the Second World War, a total of 6,637 DFMs were awarded, with 60 second award bars. A unique second bar, representing a third award, was awarded to Flight Sergeant Donald Ernest Kingaby on 7 November 1941.

At least 170 Honorary DFM&#x27;s and 2 Honorary bars (one of them to Josef Frantisek) were awarded to aircrew from non-Commonwealth countries. 39 were awarded to servicemen of the US, 66 Polish plus one bar, 33 French, 14 Czechoslovakian plus one bar, 7 Dutch, 6 Norwegian, 4 Russian and one Belgian.

142 DFMs were earned between 1946 and 1993 when the award was discontinued.

==Description==

The DFM is an oval silver medal, 35 mm wide and with a height of 41 mm, with the following design:
* The obverse shows the effigy and titles of the reigning sovereign. There are five distinct versions:
:* King George V bare headed (1918-29)
:* King George V in crown and robes (1930–1937)
:* King George VI with &#x27;IND: IMP:&#x27; (Indian Emperor) in the inscription (1938–1949)
:* King George VI without &#x27;IND: IMP:&#x27; in the inscription (1949–1953)
:* Queen Elizabeth II (1953–1993)
:The three most common obverse designs were:

* The reverse shows Athena Nike seated on an aeroplane, a hawk rising from her right arm above the words &#x27;FOR COURAGE&#x27;, all within a narrow laurel wreath band. From 1938, when the George VI obverse was introduced, the date &#x27;1918&#x27; was added to the reverse design.
* The suspension consists of two outstretched wings.
* The ribbon is 32 mm wide, and consists of alternate violet and white stripes (1/16-inch wide) leaning 45 degrees to the left. A violet stripe is to appear in the bottom left and upper right corners when viewed on the wearer&#x27;s chest. Until July 1919, the stripes were horizontal. 
* Further awards are signified by a straight slip-on silver bar with an eagle in the centre.
* All awards have the name and service details of the recipient engraved or impressed on the rim.

<text>&quot;Ādityahṛdayam&quot; (, ) is a Hindu devotional hymn, dedicated to Āditya or Sūrya (the Sun God), found in the Yuddha Kānda (6.105) of Vālmīki&#x27;s Rāmāyana. It was recited by the sage Agastya to Rāma in the battlefield before fighting with the Rakshasa king Rāvaṇa. In it, Agastya teaches Rāma the procedure of worshiping Āditya for strength to defeat the enemy.

==Etymology==
&quot;Āditya&quot; (, &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;son of Aditi&quot;) refers to the Sun. &quot;Hṛdayam&quot; () is the Sanskrit word for &quot;heart&quot;.

== Structure ==

The Ādityahṛdayam is made up of thirty &quot;śloka&quot;s which can be divided into six sections:

These automobile extravaganzas were designed to whet public appetite and boost automobile sales with displays of fancy concept cars and other special or halo models. Motorama grew out of Alfred P. Sloan&#x27;s yearly industrial luncheons at New York City&#x27;s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, beginning in 1931. They were almost invariably held in conjunction with the New York Auto Show, that for many years was held traditionally in the first week of January.

==History==

===1949===
After World War II, the first show, &quot;Transportation Unlimited Autorama&quot;, was staged again at the Waldorf Astoria, in January 1949. Between the New York City venue and the Boston extension, nearly 600,000 people saw the show. Seven &quot;special&quot; Cadillacs were exhibited including, inter alia, a &quot;Series 61&quot; coupe and a &quot;Series 62&quot; sedan that were standard except for a special paint finish; also shown were The Caribbean, the Embassy, and the Fleetwood Coupe de Ville, all built on the Series Sixty Special chassis.

===1950===
During the 1950 show, more than 320,000 visitors admired the Cadillac Debutante, a special convertible trimmed in leopard skins. There was no Autorama or Motorama in 1952. Cadillac celebrated its Golden Anniversary (50 years of production) in 1952, and two show cars were on display at various venues around the country: the Cadillac Townsman, a custom Series Sixty Special sedan, and the Cadillac Eldorado special convertible that went into limited production in 1953.

===1953 and 1954===

The show officially became known as Motorama when it began to travel around the country in 1953. That year more than 1.4 million visitors saw it; Motorama&#x27;s opening day in New York drew 45,000 visitors. There was a revue, with orchestra, singers, and dancers. Exhibited at this venue were the Buick Wildcat, Pontiac La Parisienne, Oldsmobile Starfire, Chevrolet Corvette, Cadillac Orleans and Le Mans.
More than 1.9 million visitors attended the show in 1954; it started on January 26 in the Waldorf Astoria, New York. On display were the experimental Oldsmobile F-88 and Cutlass, Buick Wildcat II, Chevrolet Nomad station wagon, General Motors Firebird XP-21 and Pontiac Bonneville Special, Cadillac El Camino, Cadillac La Espada and Cadillac Park Avenue, all featuring fiberglass bodies.

===1955 and 1956===

The 1955 show dates were New York (January 20–25), Miami (February 5–13), Los Angeles (March 5–13), San Francisco (March 26 to April 3), Boston (April 23 to May 1). Exhibited at these venues were the Buick Wildcat III, Chevrolet Biscayne, Pontiac Strato Star, Oldsmobile 88 Delta, LaSalle II roadster and sedan, and Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. Oldsmobile and Buick pillarless four-door hardtops were first shown at this show.

In 1956 over 2.2 million visitors attended. The dates were New York City (January 19–24), Miami (February 4–12), Los Angeles (March 3–11), San Francisco (March 24 to April 1), Boston (April 19–29). Featured cars included Buick Centurion, General Motors Firebird II, the Oldsmobile Golden Rocket, Pontiac Club de Mer, Cadillac Eldorado Brougham and Eldorado Brougham Town Car. Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will recognize the 1956 show as the Motorama featured in the short film &quot;Design for Dreaming&quot;.

No shows were held for the next two years. In 1957, however, Cadillac did display a couple of show cars at various venues. These were the Cadillac Director and the Eldorado Brougham town car of the previous year. Also, in 1958, a special Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible toured various automobile shows; it was equipped with a rain sensor designed to automatically raise the top and all window glass, in case of a rain shower.

===1959–1961===
The &quot;1959&quot; Motorama was held from October 16–22, 1958, at the Waldorf Astoria, New York City, before moving on to Boston. Shown in these two east coast cities were General Motors Firebird III and the Cadillac Cyclone.

The final Motorama show was held in 1961 in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. During November 21–23, 1961, the exhibit was brought to Basel, Switzerland. More than one million visitors attended. &quot;A Touch of Magic&quot; was the official film for the 1961 Motorama.

More than 100 trucks were needed to transport Motorama shows around the country, each arriving at a precise time and in a given order. Cars and simultaneous revues were displayed on lifting, revolving platforms known as &quot;grass-hoppers&quot;.

A total of 10.5 million visitors saw Motorama shows between 1949 and 1961.

== History ==
Aldridge-Brownhills constituency was created in 1974 from parts of the former seats of Walsall North and Walsall South. It is one of four constituencies covering the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall. It covers the north-east and east of the borough. It was initially held by the Labour Party at the two 1974 general elections, when the constituency included most of Pheasey, a ward of the same name, then a stronger area for Labour than much of the rest, which was moved into Walsall South in 1983 to account for population expansion in the seat. Pheasey was moved back into the constituency for the 2024 general election.

The constituency has had just three different MPs since its formation in February 1974. Geoff Edge of the Labour Party served the constituency from February 1974 until 1979, when it was gained by Richard Shepherd of the Conservative Party; who was to represent the constituency for thirty-six years, even withstanding the 1997 Labour landslide on a below average Conservative-to-Labour swing. In 2014 Sir Richard Shepherd announced he would not stand for re-election at the 2015 general election. Wendy Morton, was selected to replace him as the Conservative candidate, and secured the seat with a safe majority of 11,723 votes. This was increased over the next two elections and, in 2019, the majority was over 50%. Morton held onto the seat in the 2024 Labour landslide, but her majority was drastically reduced to 10.3%. 

== Boundaries ==

1974–1983: The Urban District of Aldridge-Brownhills.

1983–2010: The Metropolitan Borough of Walsall wards of Aldridge Central and South, Aldridge North and Walsall Wood, Brownhills, Hatherton Rushall, Pelsall, and Streetly.

2010–2024: The Metropolitan Borough of Walsall wards of Aldridge Central and South, Aldridge North and Walsall Wood, Brownhills, Pelsall, Rushall-Shelfield, and Streetly.

<doc id="1259629" wikidata="Q3736079" url="?curid=1259629" title="Explosions-Polka">
<text>Explosions-Polka, Op. 43, is a polka written by Johann Strauss II in 1847. The title was inspired by a discovery of guncotton or nitrocellulose by German scientist Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1840. The Viennese press eagerly reported this discovery many years later in 1846, describing many products that can then be made &#x27;explosive&#x27;.

The polka is one of Strauss&#x27;s novelty pieces, capturing a vogue. The &quot;Explosions-Polka&quot; was written for a benefit concert entitled &#x27;Lust-Explosionsfest&#x27; (Joyful Explosions Festival), held in the Sträussl-Säle of the Theater in der Josefstadt on 8 February 1847 during the Vienna season. It was then played to &#x27;explosive applause&#x27; at and other venues in Vienna.

The polka incorporates many explosion effects throughout the piece, and is one of the most popular early pieces of the composer. It was played at the 1974, 1990, and 2015 Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concerts. George Balanchine incorporated this polka into his ballet &quot;Vienna Waltzes&quot;.

<text>The New Batman/Superman Adventures is a name given to an animated package series that combined &quot;&quot; with &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; produced by Warner Bros. Animation. It aired from 1997–2000 on Kids&#x27; WB. Although it was part of the DC Animated Universe, each half-hour episode in the hour-and-one-half block featured either a single repeat from the original &quot;Superman: The Animated Series&quot; run, the original &quot;&quot; run, or a brand new story featuring Batman from &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;. These new stories focus more on Batman&#x27;s supporting cast and introduced new characters such as Tim Drake. The two animated universes were united in the &quot;Superman&quot; episode &quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot;, which tells the story of Batman and Superman&#x27;s first meeting. The new Batman episodes that began airing in the Fall 1997 season were later released as a DVD box set of &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; as Volume 4. New Superman episodes that later aired in the Fall 1998 season and onward are now considered to be the third season of &quot;Superman: The Animated Series&quot;.

In 1997, it was announced that the &quot;Batman&quot; series would have a revamp, replacing its art style with streamlined designs for more consistent animation, and to maintain similarity with the simultaneously running &quot;Superman: The Animated Series&quot; (1996–2000). The WB wanted more episodes of &quot;Batman&quot;, so 24 new episodes were produced featuring a format that focused more on Batman&#x27;s supporting cast. Also, because of the animation similarities, &quot;TNBA&quot; was aired simultaneously with the
&quot;Superman&quot; series as part of an hour-long segment called &quot;The New Batman/Superman Adventures&quot;. The shows shared a brand new opening, but &quot;TNBA&quot; was later given the same opening and closing of &quot;BTAS&quot; when aired in syndication and released on home video.

<text>Los Angeles Trade–Technical College (L.A. Trade–Tech, LATTC) is a public community college in Los Angeles, California. It is part of the Los Angeles Community College District and is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC), American Culinary Federation, and League of Nursing, among others.

== History ==
Founded as the Frank Wiggins Trade School in 1925, the college is the oldest of the nine campuses of the Los Angeles Community College District.

After World War II, the school moved to the former campus of John H. Francis Polytechnic High School, which had relocated to Sun Valley. It then expanded the campus and combined with Metropolitan College to expand its programs.

In 1954, the school was renamed Los Angeles Trade–Technical Junior College. In 1969, the college became a part of the Los Angeles Community College District.

L.A. Trade Tech&#x27;s fashion design program is the oldest in Los Angeles, having started in 1925. During World War Two, the college offered around-the-clock courses so women could train in vocational areas to help the war effort.

The college was featured on the PBS television series &quot;Downtown&quot; with Huell Howser.

== Campus ==
The 25-acre campus is located just south of the Historic Core of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Trade–Technical College (LATTC), is located at 400 West Washington Boulevard, renowned for its vocational and technical education programs. Established to serve the diverse educational needs of the community, LATTC offers a comprehensive array of courses ranging from automotive technology and culinary arts to nursing and construction trades.

The campus spans multiple city blocks and features state-of-the-art facilities including specialized laboratories, modern classrooms, a well-equipped library, and a student center. These resources support LATTC&#x27;s mission to provide hands-on training that prepares students for successful careers in their chosen fields.

Also on-campus, Bucky&#x27;s Pride Center features computer stations, printers, and a social lounge area, while also providing mental health and wellness services, sexual education, and financial assistance.

LATTC&#x27;s strategic location near major highways and accessible by public transportation enhances its appeal to a wide range of students across Los Angeles. With a strong emphasis on practical education and industry-relevant skills, LATTC continues to play a vital role in shaping the workforce of Southern California.

<text>Bobby Gurney (13 October 1907 – 14 April 1994) was an English footballer who played as a forward. He is the highest goal scorer in the history of Sunderland A.F.C.

==Early years==
Born in Stewart Street, Silksworth, Sunderland, his father Joe was a miner at Silksworth Colliery. His mother, Elizabeth, stayed at home to look after Bobby, his three brothers and one sister. Bobby took up football as a child, playing for his village team. His older brother, Ralph, also played football, as a goalkeeper. All his brothers went into pit jobs after leaving school.

==Club career==
Bobby was signed to Sunderland in May 1925, after being spotted by Charlie Buchan while playing for top non-league side Bishop Auckland. He made his debut nearly a year later against West Ham United on 3 April 1926, scoring once in a 3–2 defeat. He would play for the next three seasons alongside a striker who hit at least 35 league goals in each of his four full seasons at Roker Park, Dave Halliday, the most prolific goals to games striker in Sunderland&#x27;s history.

After Halliday&#x27;s departure Gurney was regularly the club&#x27;s top goalscorer, garnering his best tally of 33 goals in the 1930–31 season. Among his career highlights were ten hat-tricks and two four-goal hauls. He was also one of just a handful of Sunderland players to score five times in a match.

Bobby went on to make 388 league appearances for Sunderland, scoring 228 goals, which makes him the club&#x27;s all-time top scorer. He won a First Division Championship medal in 1936. He scored in a 3–1 win over Preston North End at Wembley in the 1937 FA Cup Final.

==International career==
Gurney won one international cap, representing England against Scotland at Hampden Park before 129,693 spectators.

==Managerial career==
On retiring from playing he stayed in the game and in 1950 became manager of Midland League side Peterborough United. He was subsequently manager of Darlington, and finally had a short spell as manager of Hartlepools United.

<doc id="1259659" wikidata="Q586333" url="?curid=1259659" title="Conspicuous Gallantry Medal">
<text>The Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (CGM) was, until 1993, a British military decoration for gallantry in action for petty officers and seamen of the Royal Navy, including Warrant Officers and other ranks of the Royal Marines. It was formerly awarded to personnel of other Commonwealth countries. In 1943 a Royal Air Force version was created for conspicuous gallantry in action against the enemy in the air.

==History==
The Conspicuous Gallantry Medal was the second level bravery award for ratings of the Royal Navy, ranking below the Victoria Cross and, after its institution in 1914, above the Distinguished Service Medal. It was normally awarded with an annuity or gratuity. In 1943, during the Second World War, a Royal Air Force version, the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (Flying), was added. Since 1917, recipients have been entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;CGM&quot;. 

The original Royal Navy medal was instituted in 1855 to recognise gallantry during the Crimean War, as the Naval counterpart of the Distinguished Conduct Medal. Only twelve were finally awarded, with the medals created by adapting existing examples of the Royal Marines Meritorious Service Medal, with the words &#x27;MERITORIOUS SERVICE&#x27; erased from the reverse inscription, and &#x27;CONSPICUOUS GALLANTRY&#x27; engraved in its place. 

The Conspicuous Gallantry Medal was re-instituted on 7 July 1874 as a permanent decoration, and was initially used to reward gallantry in the various colonial campaigns of the late nineteenth century in which the Royal Navy took part. 

It remained an exclusively Naval award until World War II when a number of changes were made. Eligibility was extended in April 1940 to Royal Air Force personnel serving with the Fleet; in July 1942 to Army personnel serving afloat, for example manning a merchant ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns; and in September 1942 to ratings of the Merchant Navy.

In January 1943 the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (Flying) was established for acts of conspicuous gallantry whilst flying in active operations against the enemy, of a standard below that required for the Victoria Cross, but above that for the Distinguished Flying Medal. 

In 1979 eligibility for a number of British awards, including the CGM, was extended to permit posthumous awards. Until that time, only the Victoria Cross and a mention in dispatches could be awarded posthumously.

In 1993, the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, Distinguished Service Order (when awarded specifically for gallantry) and Distinguished Conduct Medal were all replaced by the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC). The CGC is tri-service and is awarded to all ranks. It is second only to the Victoria Cross for bravery in action. 

The CGM had also been awarded by Commonwealth countries but by the 1990s most, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, had established their own honours systems and no longer recommended British honours.

==Description==
Apart from the ribbon, the medals awarded for service afloat and for flying are identical. The medal is circular, silver, in diameter with the following design:
* The obverse bears the head and titles of the reigning monarch. The 1855 version has the date &#x27;1848&#x27; below the Queen&#x27;s effigy, reflecting that the medals were adapted from specimens of the earlier Meritorious Service Medal.
* The reverse has the words &#x27;FOR CONSPICUOUS GALLANTRY&#x27; in three lines, encircled by a laurel wreath and surmounted by an Imperial Crown.
* The ribbon is suspended from a straight bar suspension, although the 1855 version and some later Victorian issues are fitted with an ornate scroll suspender.
* The name, rank, service number of the recipient are engraved or impressed on the rim of the medal. Some medals also note the ship, date and place of the action where the medal was won.
* The ribbon for the naval version was changed in 1921 from three equal stripes of dark blue white and dark blue, to white with narrow dark blue edges, the same as the Naval General Service Medal. The ribbon of the CGM (Flying) is sky blue with narrow dark blue edge stripes.
* A silver, laurelled bar could be awarded for additional acts of pre-eminent bravery. Only one was awarded, in 1918 to the Naval version of the medal.

===Design variations===
The medal was awarded with one of five obverses:

==Recipients==
===Number of awards===
Between 1855 and 1993 a total of 369 medals and one second award bar were awarded. 

The above figures for World War II include ten honorary awards to servicemen from allied countries, eight for service afloat and two for gallantry while flying.

===Notable recipients===
* George Ingouville was awarded both the Victoria Cross and the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal during the Crimean War. 
*Acting Chief Petty Officer Arthur Robert Blore, who served with the Royal Naval Division, won the CGM in 1915 and a bar in 1918.
* &quot;Bugler Ernest Sillince. Royal Marine Light Infantry behaved with distinguished gallantry on 4th May (1915) during operations South of Achi Baba, (Gallipoli Campaign) in volunteering to throw back enemy bombs into enemy lines at great personal risk, thereby saving the lives of many of his comrades.&quot;
* &quot;Sergeant Frank John Knill of the Royal Marines, R.M.A. ... was in charge of &quot;HMS Vindictive&#x27;s&quot; howitzer, which fired continuously under the most difficult conditions during the whole period that the ship was alongside the mole at Zeebrugge during the [1918] Zeebrugge raid. In spite of being semi-gassed, he did not leave his post, but remained in charge of his gun until it ceased firing.&quot;
* Jesse Elton from Poole, the ship&#x27;s cook on the Naval Yacht &quot;Bystander&quot;, who swam to rescue 25 evacuees from the bombed and sunken during the Battle of Dunkirk in May 1940. He received the CGM from the King at Buckingham Palace.
* Wireless Operator F/Sgt Geoffrey Keen DFM was the first member of the Royal Canadian Air Force to be awarded the CGM and one of only eleven airmen during the Second World War to be awarded both the CGM and the Distinguished Flying Medal. During the bomb run in a raid on Essen on the night of 12/13 March 1943 his Wellington bomber was hit by flak, killing the navigator and blowing off Keen&#x27;s right foot. For the remainder of the return flight, disregarding his wounds and whilst continually losing blood, for over two hours, Keen continued to repair his damaged radio set and on two occasions dragged himself to the navigator&#x27;s compartment to assist the pilot with essential information for navigating the aircraft safely back to base. All three remaining members of the crew were awarded the DFC while Keen was recommended for the Victoria Cross.
* Corporal John Coughlan RAAF was awarded the CGM in 1968, for actions as a helicopter crewman in Vietnam. This was the only CGM (Flying) to be awarded after World War II.
* Sergeant Ian Prescott (Royal Engineers) awarded the CGM posthumously during the Falklands War 1982. (Naval award as on a Naval task).
* CPO (Diver) Hammond was the last recipient of the CGM, for the 1991 Gulf War, before the inception of the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross in 1993.
* Acting Chief Petty Officer Max Bernays, RCN was one of only two CGMs awarded to the RCN during WWII.&quot;For valour and dauntless devotion to duty. Acting Chief Petty Officer Bernays was steering HMCS Assiniboine during an action at close range with an enemy U-boat. A fire caused by enemy shells broke out on the flag deck, compelling the telegraphmen to leave the wheelhouse leaving A/CPO Bernays alone. With complete disregard for his own safety, with flames and smoke obscuring his only exit, with enemy explosive shell fragments entering the wheelhouse, this 36comparatively young rating remained at this post for nearly forty minutes. Appreciating the crucial importance of his duties in an action, the success of which depended in a large measure on the precise steering of the ship and execution of telegraph orders, he not only carried out exactly and effectively all the helm orders but also dispatched 133 telegraph orders, necessary to accomplish the destruction of the U-Boat. The final success of the sinking of the U-Boat was largely due to the high courage and determination of A/CPO Max Leopold Bernays who, in circumstances of the gravest personal danger carried out not only his own, but two other ratings&#x27; duties in exemplary fashion. His conduct throughout the action added another incident of the utmost bravery to the annals of the Royal Canadian Navy.&quot;

<doc id="1259676" wikidata="Q457663" url="?curid=1259676" title="Felix Kersten">
<text>Eduard Alexander Felix Kersten (30 September 1898 – 16 April 1960) was the personal physical therapist of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler.

==Early life==
Kersten was born in a Baltic German family in Dorpat, Imperial Russia, now Tartu, in Estonia. During the First World War he fought in the German Army and arrived in Finland in April 1918 with the German forces that intervened in the Finnish Civil War. Kersten served for a while in the Suojeluskunta, was granted Finnish citizenship in 1920, and in September 1921 was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant (&quot;vänrikki&quot;) in the Finnish Army.

After his return to civilian life, Kersten remained in Helsinki, where he studied therapy with the specialist Dr Colander, and after two years was awarded a certificate in physical therapy. He then left for Berlin, where he continued his studies and eventually became the pupil of a notable Chinese therapeutic masseur, Dr Ko, whom he had met at a dinner party. In 1925, Ko told Kersten &quot;You have learned all I can teach you.&quot; He then turned his practice over to Kersten and retired to Tibet.

Kersten had a number of influential patients, among them Prince Hendrik of the Netherlands (after 1928) and Benito Mussolini&#x27;s son-in-law, the Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano. Kersten accepted Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s request to become his personal physical therapist, writing later that he feared for his safety if he had refused.

He was able to alleviate Himmler&#x27;s severe stomach pains with his skills and gained his trust. Kersten used this trust to obtain pardons and the release of underground prisoners, labor camp inmates, homosexuals and others.

==Second World War==
During the Second World War, Kersten was involved in organizing Himmler&#x27;s visit to Finland in August 1942. During the visit, Himmler would have demanded that all Finnish Jews be extradited to the Gestapo, according to Kersten. Risto Ryti, the President of Finland, summed up in his diary that Himmler was “an extremely steep anti-semite”. Kersten, for his part, told Ryti about the situation of Jews in Germany: “Jews are sent a lot out of Germany to Latvia and Poland, where they are massacred in cold blood,” and talked about “human slaughter”. This was possibly the first time President Ryti had heard of the massacre of Jews. Kersten also provided information to Abrams S. Hewitt of the Stockholm desk of the OSS, predecessor of the CIA.

Towards the end of the war, Kersten arranged a meeting between Himmler and Norbert Masur, a member of the Swedish branch of the World Jewish Congress, in Hartzwalde, a few miles from Ravensbrück concentration camp. As a result, Himmler agreed to spare the lives of the remaining 60,000 Jews left in Nazi concentration camps days before their liberation by the Allies.

In December 1945, the World Jewish Congress presented Kersten with a letter thanking him for helping to save Jewish concentration camp victims.

==Later life==

In his postwar memoirs, Kersten took credit for saving the entirety of the Dutch population from being forcibly deported to Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe. In January 1950, the Dutch monarchy awarded him the Order of Orange-Nassau on the basis of his account. However, a later investigation by Dutch historian Louis de Jong concluded that the mass deportation plan had not existed, as well as that many of Kersten&#x27;s documents had been fabricated.

The Swedish archives testify that Kersten was an intermediary between Himmler and Count Folke Bernadotte in the negotiations that led to the rescue operation &#x27;The White Buses&#x27;, saving hundreds of Norwegians and Danes from certain death in the last days of the Third Reich.

Kersten&#x27;s claims of being instrumental in saving Finland&#x27;s Jews from German hands may be exaggerated, but the Finnish government used his services in the hope of influencing Himmler.

In Kersten&#x27;s memoirs he discusses that Himmler confided in him that Hitler was interested in setting up a Burgundian Free State that the old Burgundian possessions, Artois, Hainault and Luxembourg; Lorraine, Franche-Comte and the old Duchy of Burgundy; Dauphine and Provence. It would have also included Picardy, including Amiens, and Champagne, including Rheims and Troyes with either Rheims and Dijon considered for the capitol. According to what Kersten said Himmler told him, &quot;The Fuhrer is sick of the idea that France...Burgundy will acquire all the territory that France has annexed unjustly...The others can have the rest of France, which will be known as Gaul.&quot;

After the war, Kersten lived in West Germany and Sweden, taking Swedish citizenship in 1953. He died in Hamm, while he was visiting Germany, aged 61.

Kersten&#x27;s war memoirs were published in English translation in 1947 and a second edition was published in 1956 (&quot;The Kersten memoirs, 1940–1945&quot;, London 1956) with an introduction by Hugh Trevor-Roper.

==In popular culture==
Writer and journalist Joseph Kessel was the first to write about the life of Felix Kersten, in his book &quot;The man with the Miraculous Hands &quot;(1960). Woody Harrelson is set to portray Felix Kersten in the Oren Moverman feature film adaptation of Joseph Kessel&#x27;s novel.

Finnish Filmmaker Arto Koskinen, when in the process of making a film about Felix Kersten, came to find archival evidence about Kersten showing his memoirs to be highly unreliable among other things, and posted a podcast series about his findings.

Felix Kersten is parodied in the Woody Allen book &quot;Getting Even&quot;, in the chapter entitled &quot;The Schmeed Memoirs&quot;, in which a fictional barber in wartime Germany describes his time as a hair stylist for Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking Nazi officers.

Kersten also appears as a character in the film , directed by Hans-Jürgen Syberberg and as the main character in the 2014 novel &quot;Gods and Devils&quot;.

Kersten is played by actor Martin Jarvis in the radio play by Neville Watchurst &quot;A Vital Flaw&quot;, about his work to help Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s health. The play was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in February 1994, then on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 5 September 2009.

<text>Kaiser-Walzer, Op. 437 (Emperor Waltz) is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II in 1889. The waltz was originally titled &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; and was intended as a toast made in August of that year by Emperor of Austria Franz Joseph I on the occasion of his visit to the German Emperor Wilhelm II where it was symbolic as a &#x27;toast of friendship&#x27; extended by Austria-Hungary to the German Empire.

Strauss&#x27; publisher, Fritz Simrock, suggested the title &quot;Kaiser-Walzer,&quot; since the title could allude to either monarch. The waltz was first performed in Berlin on 21 October 1889. The original cover of the piano edition bore the illustration of the Austrian Imperial Crown.

A quiet march starts the waltz&#x27;s introduction before a sweeping crescendo heralds the gentle principal melody of the first waltz. As more waltz sections are introduced, the mood remains constantly upbeat and triumphant. A cello solo, rather like a cadenza, near the end of the work reprises the melody of the first waltz section, before a trumpet fanfare ushers the end of the work, complete with a drumroll on the timpani and a strong brass flourish.

<text>Rogers Drums is an American multinational drum manufacturer. It was founded in 1849 and originally based in Covington, Ohio. During the twentieth century, their drums enjoyed popularity with musicians spanning from the Dixieland jazz era in the 1920s to classic rock in the 1960s and 1970s, but was particularly associated with big band and swing drummers of the 1940s and 1950s.

== History ==
The Rogers company was started in 1849 by James Rogers, an Irish immigrant from Dublin to the United States. Rogers started crafting drum heads in Brewster&#x27;s Station, New York. A second tannery was established later in Farmingdale, New Jersey, operated by his son Joseph H. Rogers Junior. James Rogers&#x27; grandson Cleveland S. Rogers began to manufacture the first &quot;Rogers&quot; drums at the Farmingdale tannery in the 1930s. The first Rogers drums were assembled from shells and hardware of other manufacturers but mounted with Rogers heads.

In 1955, Cleveland Rogers, who had no heirs, sold the Rogers drum company to Henry Grossman. Grossman moved the company to Covington, Ohio, and under his leadership, Rogers moved to the forefront of American drum making for the next decade and a half. Design engineer Joe Thompson and marketing manager Ben Strauss were instrumental in Rogers&#x27; success during its golden age from the mid-1950s to the late 1960s. The company&#x27;s drums were embraced by musicians from the Dixieland movement to the classic rockers of the 1960s and 1970s. However, the manufacturer was most closely associated with the &quot;big band&quot; and swing drummers of the 1940s and 1950s.

===The Dyna-Sonic snare drum===
Rogers&#x27; &quot;Dyna-Sonic&quot; snare drum featured a number of innovations, such as a unique cradle in which the snare wires were supported. This device provided a means by which the longitudinal tension of the snare wires could be adjusted independently of the vertical force holding the snares against the bottom head. As a result, the snares could be tensioned as tightly as the drummer wanted without having to pull the snares against the head so hard they constrained (choked) the head&#x27;s vibration. This and other innovations (for example, a remarkably shallow—4/1000&quot;—snare bed) made possible by the novel tensioning arrangement gave the drum a relatively crisp and recognizably clear sound. Dyna-Sonics were made from about 1961 until the mid-&#x27;80s. The company was bought in 1966 by CBS Musical Instruments, which had also acquired in 1965 Fender Guitars and Rhodes Pianos. The vast majority of Dyna-Sonics had COB (chrome over brass) shells. Only a small number of wood-shell Dyna-Sonics was made during the lifetime of the drum. Pristine models can fetch thousands of dollars on the vintage drum market. Other notable Rogers drums were the Powertone model of snare drums and the Holiday model of tom-toms and bass drums. Fiberglass timpani were also manufactured for a time, named &quot;Accu-Sonic&quot;.

In addition to its Dyna-Sonic snare drum, Rogers was renowned for its highly-innovative hardware. Much of it was developed by Thompson, including the Swiv-o-Matic line of bass drum pedals, hi-hats, cymbal stands, and tom-tom holders. The cymbal stands and tom-tom holders featured a ball-and-socket tilting mechanism. Even Ludwig drummers like Ringo Starr of The Beatles, Mitch Mitchell of The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and John Bonham of Led Zeppelin used some Swiv-o-Matic hardware items on their kits. Keith Moon used Swiv-o-Matic hardware on his Premier kit. 

Neil Peart of RUSH played a Rogers 5&quot;x14&quot; Rogers Dynasonic Snare on Fly by Night, Caress of Steel, 2112 and All The World&#x27;s A Stage. He also used Rogers hardware, specifically, a single Swiv-o-Matic tom holder on his large Slingerland and Tama drum kits through the mid-1980s in order to position a tom-tom directly over the center of one of his bass drums.

From 1964 until 1975, Rogers shells were 5-ply construction of alternating plies of maple and birch wood with reinforcement rings. From late 1975 until 1978 the shells were made up of 5 alternating plies of maple and birch wood with reinforcement rings. Starting in 1978, Rogers began offering drums with 8-ply shells without reinforcement rings (made by Keller Products, Inc. of Manchester, NH) for its XP-8 line. They marked the beginning of relatively heavy, thick &quot;stadium&quot; shells that favored attack and projection over midrange tonality. These drums were promoted as &quot;the best Rogers drums ever made&quot; and the XP-8 models lived up to that claim.

1976 saw the introduction of &quot;Memriloc&quot; hardware. This innovation was co-developed by Dave Donoho and Roy Burns. It was the first of the super-stable hardware systems and was subsequently copied by most major drum manufacturers in one form or another. Most modern drum hardware evolved from the Rogers Memrilock concept. 

For the growing European market, Rogers drums were made in the UK by Ajax under license from Rogers USA. The hardware was Rogers, but the drum shells were supplied by Ajax from its UK production. Dave Clark of the Dave Clark Five and Pete York of the Spencer Davis Group were prominent British drummers using Rogers equipment during that era; along with Mick Avory of the Kinks (before switching to Ludwig) and John Steel of The Animals (after switching from Premier).

Shortly after being purchased by CBS in 1966, Rogers drums moved its production in 1969 from Ohio to a Fullerton, CA factory complex, where the American Fender Guitars were also produced.

In 1983, CBS sold Rogers and Fender to a group of individuals who were running the Fender division; the new owners soon after decided to discontinue the Rogers Drums line. Between 1984 and 1998, the Rogers name was owned by Island Music, who manufactured low-cost copies of the famous Big R Rogers drums outside the US.

===1998 to present day===

In 1998, the Rogers name was acquired by the Brook Mays Music Company (BMMC) of Dallas, Texas. Jim Rosenthal, then VP Marketing for BMMC, identified the opportunity to purchase the name and revitalize the brand. BMMC began the brand as a low-cost, but high-quality import line of beginner drum sets that were sold exclusively through the company&#x27;s own chain of music stores. The first kits were manufactured by Peace Drums of Taiwan. The drums sold successfully because many drummers (especially younger ones) wanted Rogers kits and the kits were excellent value. Bill Crowden, son-in-law of Bill Ludwig, was working for BMMC at the time and was brought in to the Dallas office to run Rogers. Together with Jim Rosenthal, they developed the line, using the names of Rogers kits and drums from the &#x27;60s. A high-quality line of kits emerged that included maple and birch shells with beavertail lugs and modern double-braced hardware. Sales of Rogers kits across the board for BMMC were extremely successful.

However, in the summer of 2006, BMMC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On August 26, 2006, the Yamaha Corporation of America announced that it had acquired the intellectual property rights to the Rogers Drum Company at the BMMC bankruptcy court-ordered auction. &quot;Opportunities to acquire a well-respected brand that is so treasured by players do not come along every day,&quot; said Tom Sumner, Vice President and General Manager of Yamaha&#x27;s Pro Audio &amp; Combo Division. &quot;We will use our expertise to improve on the Rogers legacy.&quot; Yamaha displayed its new Rogers drums at winter NAMM 2007.

In 2013, the rights to Rogers drums were acquired by Joseph Chen, then the president of Dixon Drums. In 2017, Rogers was revived as a manufacturer of high-end handcrafted snare drums, utilizing many of the familiar hardware designs from the 1950s and 1960s. They have reissued a 5-ply maple version of the &quot;Dyna-Sonic&quot; snare drum featuring the &quot;Clock Face&quot; double-rail snare straining device and re-engineered &quot;Bread and Butter&quot; lugs.

<text>Camel toe, or cameltoe, is slang for the outline of the labia majora (the outer lips of the vulva) in tightly fitting clothes. Owing to a combination of anatomical factors and the fabric tension in the crotch area, the outer labia and mons pubis may, together, display a shape resembling the forefoot of a camel. Camel toe commonly occurs as a result of wearing clothing with crotch-area vertical tension, such as Spandex activewear or athleisure bottom wear, hotpants or swimwear.

In the 1930s, following the development of Lastex rubberized yarns for swimwear, the resulting exposure of the pubic-area outline resulted in manufacturers adding a &quot;modesty panel&quot; to women&#x27;s swimsuits to conceal the camel toe; this persisted through the 1950s.

In the early 21st century, the display of camel toe in public or in the media has caused controversy on a number of occasions.

<text>This is a list of engines produced by Mitsubishi Motors since 1964, and its predecessors prior to this.

==Explanation of codes==
The Mitsubishi zaibatsu had been broken up into three companies by the US occupying forces. Automobile and truck engines were mainly built by three branches of one of these companies, Central Heavy Industries (Shin-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries from 1952). These three branches (Mizushima, Nagoya, and Kyoto Engineering Works) were established as clusters of the many small aircraft factories built during the war. Thus, Mizushima developments gained the ME code, followed by a numerical, while engines developed in Nagoya became the NE-series and Kyoto-developments were named KE. The numbers do not in any way relate to each other or across letter codes and were purely issued in order of development. In 1964 the three companies were merged into Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and eventually a new naming system emerged.

Since the introduction of the 2G10 engine in October 1968, Mitsubishi engines use a four-digit naming convention:
* The first (digit) signifies the number of cylinders; &quot;2&quot; = straight-2, &quot;3&quot; = straight-3, &quot;4&quot; = straight-4, &quot;6&quot; = V6, &quot;8&quot; = V8.
* The second (letter) formerly referred to the fuel type; &quot;D&quot; = diesel, &quot;G&quot; = gasoline. However, since the 1980s, this has changed. Two engine families were introduced using the letter &quot;A&quot; to denote that all the engines in the family had an alloy cylinder head. Their latest engines, however, do not follow any previous conventions (e.g. 4M4, 3B2, etc.).
* The third (digit) previously denoted the engine family. Five of the &quot;4G&quot; straight-four engine families had distinct names; &quot;4G1&quot; = Orion, &quot;4G3&quot; = Saturn, &quot;4G4&quot; = Neptune, &quot;4G5&quot; = Astron, and &quot;4G6&quot; = Sirius.
* The fourth (digit) is the specific engine model within the family, issued in order of development. It is not a guide to its place &quot;within&quot; that family, nor is it a guide to the capacity of the engine.

There may also be supplementary letters after the initial four characters. &quot;T&quot; can indicate that the engine is turbocharged (e.g. &quot;4G63T&quot;), &quot;B&quot; that this is the second version of the engine (e.g. &quot;4G63B&quot;). Where engine codes are used which include the supplemental letters, the first digit denoting the number of cylinders may be omitted, so &quot;4G63T&quot; may be seen as &quot;G63T&quot;.

==Configurations==
===Single-cylinder===
These were used in Mitsubishi&#x27;s very first vehicles, motor scooters and three-wheelers.

* A-series — A 744 cc air-cooled OHV engine installed as the 3A in the 1947 Mitsubishi TM3A three-wheeled truck. The TM6 three-wheeler of 1955 was equipped with an improved 6A engine.
* 1952-196? — ME10/12 — A development of the A family engine (&quot;Mizushima Engine&quot;). The sidevalve ME10 displaces 886 cc (TM4 and TM5 three-wheeled trucks), while the later, OHV ME12 is of 851 cc.
:As fitted to the Mitsubishi &quot;Mizushima&quot; TM14G three-wheeled truck, the ME12 developed at 3600 rpm.
* NE/NE1 — &quot;Nagoya Engine,&quot; First introduced as the 112 cc side-valve, air-cooled 1.5 hp NE10 for the famous Silver Pigeon scooter. Later iterations included the NE7, the enlarged 192 cc NE9, and the OHV 125 cc NE8 and 175 cc NE13.
* ME20 — This 309 air-cooled OHV engine served in the three-wheeled Leo.

===Two-cylinder/inline 2===
Mitsubishi&#x27;s smallest powerplants, most commonly found in their earliest models in the 1960s:
* 1955-1962 — ME7/15/18 — This was Mitsubishi&#x27;s first air-cooled OHV engine over one liter&#x27;s displacement. In 1955, the 1276 cc ME7 was developed for the Mitsubishi TM7. The 1145 cc ME15 and the 1489 cc ME18 were premiered in 1958 for the TM15/16 and TM17/18 trucks; production of this engine series ended when Mitsubishi discontinued heavier three-wheeled trucks.
* 1960-1962 — NE19A — 0.5 L — The air-cooled 493 cc OHV twin-cylinder engine in the Mitsubishi 500, the first passenger car built by the company after the Second World War. Bore and stroke were 70.0 x 64.0 mm
* 1961-1965 — NE35A — 0.6 L — a 594 cc iteration of the NE series, 72.0 x 73.0 mm. This engine was used in the Mitsubishi 500 Super DeLuxe and Mitsubishi Colt 600.
* 1961-1976 — ME21/24 — 0.36 L — This air-cooled two-stroke first served in the Mitsubishi 360 but was used in various Minicas until 1972 and in Minicabs until 1976.
* 1968-1976 — 2G1 — 0.36 L — First introduced in late first generation Minicas in October 1968 to gradually replace the air-cooled ME24 powerplant. The water-cooled 2G10 was a two-stroke engine like its predecessor.
* 1972-1988 — 2G2 &quot;Vulcan&quot; — 0.36-0.8 L — a new four-stroke OHC design introduced in 1972 to succeed the 2G1, fitted to Minicas and Minicabs. 359 cc, 471 cc, 546 cc, 644 cc and 783 cc versions were produced. It also equipped the Mazda Porter Cab.

<doc id="1259711" wikidata="Q499009" url="?curid=1259711" title="São Domingos, Cape Verde (municipality)">
<text>São Domingos is a &quot;concelho&quot; (municipality) of Cape Verde. It is situated in the southeastern part of the island of Santiago. Its seat is the city São Domingos (&quot;Várzea da Igreja&quot;). Its population was 13,699 at the 2010 census, and its area is 147.5 km2.

The two major settlements in the concelho are São Domingos and Praia Baixo, São Domingos (population about 3,000) being the largest settlement in the area. Smaller settlements in the area include Água do Gato, Achada Banana and Rui Vaz, which is situated on the edge of a 1 km high cliff overlooking Ribeirão Galinha. While Rui Vaz and Praia Baixo are the main tourist draws in the area, tourism does not constitute a major factor in the region’s overwhelmingly agrarian economy.

Farmlands cover the eastern and the central parts, where runoff from the center of the island allows a higher water table and loamier soils than the dense clays found on most of the island. Mountains dominate the western border, where the steep relief and lack of rainwater runoff makes large-scale agriculture impractical. Several dozen subsistence farming villages dot the main road leading towards Assomada, but produce negligible agricultural products for export.

==Parishes==
The municipality consists of two parishes:
*Nossa Senhora da Luz
*São Nicolau Tolentino

==History==
The São Domingos municipality was created in 1994, when two parishes of the older Municipality of Praia were separated to become the Municipality of São Domingos.

==Demography==
==Notable people==
*Codé di Dona, singer
*Simplício Rodrigues de Sá, artist who later moved to Brazil and become painter for Pedro I

==Politics==
At the federal level, it belongs to the constituency of Santiago South. Since 2004, the Movement for Democracy (MpD) is the ruling party of the municipality. The results of the latest elections, in 2016:

==Twin towns==

* Barcelos, Portugal , since 1997
* Bembibre, Spain

<doc id="1259718" wikidata="Q3142066" url="?curid=1259718" title="ITU-T V.92">
<text>V.92 is an ITU-T recommendation, titled &quot;Enhancements to Recommendation V.90&quot;, that establishes a modem standard allowing near 56 kb/s download and 48 kb/s upload rates. With V.92 PCM is used for both the upstream and downstream connections; previously 56K modems only used PCM for downstream data. The recommendation was issued in November 2000, with amendments in July 2001 and March 2002.

==New features==
===Quick connect===

This reduces negotiation times to around 10 seconds instead of over 20 seconds. Quick connect works by training the client modem on the first call; analog and digital characteristics are stored in a local profile and then retrieved for future connections.

===Modem on hold (MOH)===

This allows the connection to be temporarily severed and then reconnected, reducing the possibility of dropped connections. This is particularly useful for lines that have call waiting.

===PCM upstream===

Pulse-code modulation (or PCM) allows higher rate digital transmissions over the analog phone lines. PCM upstream provides a digital connection for upstream data, reducing latency and allowing for a maximum upload speed of 48 kbit/s. Previously the speed was limited to a 33.6 kbit/s analog signal under the previous V.90.

===V.44 compression===

ITU-T V.44 compression replaces the existing V.42bis compression standards. It generally allows for between 10% and 120% better compression. In most situations the improvement is around 25%.

<text>Colnago Ernesto &amp; C. S.r.l. or Colnago is a manufacturer of road-racing bicycles founded by Ernesto Colnago near Milano in Cambiago, Italy. It remained a family-controlled firm until May 4, 2020, when it was announced that the UAE-based investment company, Chimera Investments LLC, had acquired a majority of the Colnago shares from Ernesto Colnago, although the headquarters will remain located in Italy after the acquisition.
Instead of following his family&#x27;s farming business, Ernesto Colnago chose to work in the cycle trade, and was apprenticed first to Gloria Bicycles at the age of 13, and subsequently taking up road racing. After a bad crash ended his racing career, he began subcontracting for Gloria, and opened his own shop in 1954, building his first frames the same year. While building frames, he remained much in demand as a racing mechanic. He was second mechanic on the Nivea team Giro d&#x27;Italia under Faliero Masi in 1955, eventually being employed as head mechanic for the Molteni team of Belgian cycling legend Eddy Merckx in 1963.

The company first became known for high quality steel framed bicycles suitable for the demanding environment of professional racing, and later as one of the more creative cycling manufacturers responsible for innovations in design and experimentation with new and diverse materials including carbon fiber, now a mainstay of modern bicycle construction. In 2020, having lost his wife and brother, Ernesto Colnago sold his majority interest in the company to a United Arab Emirates investment firm.

== History ==

One of the first big victories on a Colnago frame was in 1957, when Gastone Nencini won the 1957 edition of the Giro d’Italia bicycle race on a Colnago bicycle. In 1960, Colnago achieved more recognition as Luigi Arienti rode to a gold medal at the Rome Olympics on a Colnago bicycle. By the late 1960s, Colnago was generally regarded as one of the builders of the world&#x27;s best steel road race frames.

While Ernesto was the head mechanic of the Molteni team riders such as Gianni Motta raced on Colnago cycles. A win on a Colnago in the 1970 Milan-San Remo race by Michele Dancelli for the Molteni team inspired Colnago to change his logo to the now-famous &#x27;Asso di Fiori&#x27; or Ace of Clubs. After the demise of the Faema team, Eddy Merckx joined the Molteni team, and what ensued was mutual innovation—as Colnago describes it: &quot;Merckx was an up and coming champion, and I was an up and coming bike builder. So it was a real honour to work for a great champion like Merckx. It helped us to grow... when we made special forks, and special bikes.&quot; This included the super-light steel frame used by Merckx in 1972 to break the world one-hour record.

With a growing reputation from their racing wins, Colnago entered the market for production bikes. In the U.S., the early seventies saw another bike boom, and Colnago &quot;pumped out bikes as though the future of humankind was at stake.&quot; The mainstay of the Colnago line in the 1970s was the Super, followed by the Mexico, named in honor of the successful hour attempt. Other models were added including the Superissimo and Esa Mexico. While the finish on these early Colnagos could be variable, they were great riding bikes and developed a cult-like following.

In 1979, Ernesto Colnago presented Pope John Paul II with a custom gold-plated steel bicycle.

In response to criticism that his frames were not stiff enough, next Colnago experimented with ways to change the behavior of frame components. In 1983, he introduced the Oval CX with an oval section top tube to add stiffness. He then experimented with various crimped-tube frames which became production models as their top of the range frames, beginning with the &quot;Super Profil&quot; and &quot;Master.&quot; Later &quot;Master-Light&quot;, Master Olympic and Master Più extended the range. Colnago built a frame from Columbus tubing used by Giuseppe Saronni to win the world professional road race championship in 1982, and afterwards a short-lived collection of bikes were badged with the Saronni name. In 1983, Giuseppe Saronni would go on to win the Giro d&#x27;Italia stage race on a Colnago bicycle. Steel frames winning races made Colnago&#x27;s reputation: &quot;Between them, Eddy Merckx and Giuseppe Saronni won 719 races from 1965 to 1988, and the bulk of those victories were aboard a steel Colnago. Ernesto Colnago first designed the Master frame in 1982 as a replacement for the Mexico, which was named after Eddy Merckx’s successful Hour record in Mexico city. Over the course of 17 years in the pro peloton, the Master was ridden to hundreds of wins, and there are few bikes that have such a palmarès.&quot;:

Since the 1980s, while Colnago continued to produce high-end steel bikes, they began to produce cycle frames using material other than steel, including titanium, aluminum, carbon fiber and mixed materials. One unique frame from this period, the Bititan, has a dual titanium down tube. Crimped and oversize tubes were used on the Tecnosone of the lightest production steel bikes produced. Similarly crimped oversized aluminum tubes were used on the Dream frame. In 1981 Colnago prototyped the CX Pistaa full monocoque carbon fiber cycle with disc wheels, which was shown at the Milan bike show. Subsequently, Colnago worked with Ferrari to develop new carbon fiber technology, and Ernesto also credits their engineers for challenging him regarding fork design, which led to Colnago&#x27;s innovative Precisa straight-bladed steel fork (1987). Colnago also experimented with multi-material frames, including the CT-1 and CT-2 constructed with titanium main tubes, carbon fiber forks and rear stays, and a similarly constructed (although short-lived) Master frame constructed with steel main tubes, carbon forks and stays.

Colnago&#x27;s early attempts at carbon fiber frames were not commercially successful, but the lessons learned were embodied in their flagship frames, such as the C-40, the most sought after bicycle (1994), and its successor, the C-50 (2004)respectively named for Colnago&#x27;s 40th and 50th years in bike building. These carbon fiber frames set new standards of excellence. They were built using a modified form of traditional cycle frame construction, substituting carbon fiber lugs for microinfusion cast steel, and carbon fiber &quot;tubes&quot; for the complex steel tubes used for steel frame construction. Similar building techniques are used in the latest design, the C59, named (as before) for its year of production. While we take for granted the spread of carbon frames, their success was not a foregone conclusion:

“When we built the C40 we were the only ones to build carbon frames and all the mechanics and competitor technicians were saying that they would be too dangerous to use on cobbled roads, especially with the straight carbon forks. There was a company that wanted to fit suspension forks on the bicycle, but I wasn&#x27;t going to have suspension forks on the C40. The night before Paris- Roubaix I had Mr. Squinzi, the Mapei boss, on the phone to me raising his concerns about using such a delicate-looking thing. I told him that we&#x27;d done all of the tests that we could on the frame and the fork and we were certain there would be no problem. I had to take personal responsibility for what was going to happen and I spent all night worrying about it, barely able to sleep. But when I heard that there were 4 Mapei riders in the break, I knew I could relax.”

The C40 went on to win 5 editions of Paris-Roubaix in 6 years. Surprisingly, the victory of Tadej Pogačar in the 2020 edition of the Tour de France marked the first time a Colnago-branded bicycle was ridden by the overall classification winner, since Merckx&#x27;s victories were aboard re-branded bikes.

An interview with Ernesto Colnago in which he describes various iconic Colnagos (filmed in the factory museum) is available on YouTube.

Colnago uses a black symbol similar to the ♣ (&quot;Clubs&quot;) symbol used on playing cards. Colnago frames&#x27; graphics evolved from a font with gravitas to elaborate and/or creative paint.

==Colnago sponsored bicycle racing teams since 1968==
Colnago has sponsored at least one professional team every year since 1974, often sponsoring more than one. In addition, other teams in the peloton have competed on Colnago bikes. Probably the most famous was the Molteni team which included Eddy Merckx, but the world champion, Giuseppe Saronni also rode Colnago bikes throughout his career, from 1977 with Scic, later with Gis Gelati and with Colnago-Del Tongo. In 2021 Colnago confirmed that Saronni used Super at Goodwood 1982 and 1983 Giro D’ Italia. Colnago was well known as a sponsor of the legendary Mapei cycling team throughout the 1990s. For 2005, Colnago sponsored the professional cycling team Rabobank. Colnago has also been the bike sponsor for the American domestic team, Navigators for whom the Australian sprinter Hilton Clarke was a member 2005–2008.

For 2006, Team Milram joined their list of professionally sponsored teams featuring well-known Alessandro Petacchi and Erik Zabel. In addition, Colnago serves as a co-title sponsor of the Landbouwkrediet-Colnago professional cycling team that competes on the UCI Europe Tour and was the official frame supplier to Team Tinkoff in 2007.
Starting in the 2011 Tour de France, Team Europcar has ridden Colnago frames. For 2012, Colnago is sponsoring Colnago-CSF Bardiani.

==Current production overview==
Until early 2006, Colnago produced virtually all of their entire frameset range at their Cambiago factory, although persistent rumors of subcontracting out the more basic frames go all the way back to the 1970s. Alan produced some aluminum frames for Colnago in the 1980s, including single and dual downtube road and cyclocross models. In March, 2005, Colnago announced that they were joining the Taiwanese-based A-Team, whose members include Giant, Merida and SRAM—the first Italian manufacturer to do so, to produce mid-ranged bicycle models for the Japanese and European markets.

Beginning in 2006, Colnago sourced the Primavera and the Arte from Giant Bicycles of Taiwan. Both received favorable reviews, although some thought the shift of manufacturing out of Italy was a matter of some regret.

There was some controversy in 2006 over whether Giant would be producing additional models, including carbon frame models, for Colnago. According to statements by Ernesto Colnago this was not the case:
: &quot;&quot;For the 2006 model year, Colnago will be sourcing two entry-level aluminum road bike models from Giant, made to Colnago&#x27;s spec and frame geometry and for sales in Europe and Asia only. All other Colnago bicycles are assembled in Italy. No Colnago carbon fiber frames are made at Giant and none will be, as Mr. Colnago has a long-term sourcing agreement in place with ATR for carbon fiber bicycle frames.&quot;

Despite this denial, since 2007 Colnago&#x27;s carbon monocoque CLX frame has been manufactured in Taiwan. In 2008, a second Colnago carbon fiber model, the CX-1 was also sourced in Taiwan.

The top-of-the-line Colnago frame, the C64, as well as the Master, and the now discontinued C60, C59, C50, Extreme Power, Extreme C are (or were) manufactured and painted in Italy. In a series of public statements, Colnago has insisted that all designs originate with the Italian design team, claiming that the essence of what makes a Colnago is design. The mid-range carbon offerings are currently being sourced from Taiwan, (as are many bicycle manufacturers&#x27; offerings), and as of 2011, the M10 (which stands second in the model lineup) is made in Taiwan and assembled and painted in Italy, while the CX-1 is completely made in Taiwan.

The current top-of-the-line frame, the C64 is the only carbon frame still made fully in Italy.

===Special Purpose Frames===
====Cyclocross====
Over the years, Ernesto Colnago built steel cyclocross frames for individual professional riders and did not sell any steel frames to the public. A handful have been identified, an early one based on the Colnago Super and built for Roger de Vlaeminck. Photos are available here. This frame sold in November 2012 on eBay for approximately $1200 US. A second 1985 Colnago Super Cyclocross Team Kwantum Decosol Team ex bike Adrie Van Der Poel, not listed in catalog or generally retail distributed, can be seen here.

Another frame surfaced a couple of years ago, and appears to have been built in the mid to late 90s, loosely based on the Colnago Crystal, specifically labeled &quot;Master&quot; on the rear brake hanger. Lugs and seat stays are similar to those on the Crystal, slightly beefier tubing than other road models (32mm OD downtube, 29mm seat tube), relaxed wheelbase, top tube routing for rear brake and derailleur, traditional routing for front derailleur but no braze-on for front derailleur. Colnago bottom bracket shell. Straight mtb style threadless fork (no formal crown). No serial number stamped on dropout. Colnago factory contact unable to identify year or provide further information. Photos are available.

Colnago built a couple of bikes for the Italian cyclocross and MTB champion Luca Bramati. Bramati rode a yellow steel, lugless Colnago cyclocross bike in the &#x27;96 Worlds in Munich, considered to be one of the most exciting races ever, where he placed third. His bike had a front fork with a traditional brazed fork crown, and full front/rear gear cable brazings. The tubing looks just slightly oversized, and overall the bike looks quite similar to Bramati&#x27;s Colnago MTB that he raced in Atlanta in the &#x27;96 Olympics.

Another may have been built for Bert Hiemstra in 1998/1999, Rabobank rider. This was a lugless steel frame, badged &quot;Colnago Competition&quot; in Rabobank colors, 59 cm CtT, set up with 9 speed Dura Ace and a Unicrown fork.

* Cyclocross (c 1980s) Manufactured by Alan, stamped &quot;Colnago&quot; name on bottom of headtube. Aluminum tubing screwed and glued to lugs. Sizing stamped in bottom bracket, no serial number on rear dropouts. Top tube ovalized for shouldering bike on transitions.
* Dual Cyclocross
* Dream CX—Production aluminum like the Dream Road with Unicrown MTB style front fork and additional bracing at headtube/downtube union.
* World Cup—
* Prestige—Early Prestige frames, all monocoque construction, had an added brace between top and seat tube for carrying the bike during cyclocross races. They also have water bottle bosses. Later frames lost this brace and gained brackets for disc brakes.
* C50 CX Rabobank Team

====Mountain Bikes====
Although not very common or widely available in the American market, Colnago did produce a number of mountain bikes. Some featured the Master profile tubing found on the Colnago road bikes.
* Master—Gilco shaped tubing like the Master road bike, Unicrown fork hard tail mountain bike
* Maxim--
* CF series CF12 Ferrari collaboration

<text>A téléroman (&quot;telenovel&quot; or &quot;annual drama series&quot;) is a genre of French-language drama television series in Canada, similar to a soap opera or a Spanish language telenovela. In France, the &quot;téléroman&quot; genre is known as feuilleton télévisé (similar to a serial). &quot;Téléromans&quot; are one of the most popular television series formats in Québécois culture and are also shown on French television.

In Canada, all of the major francophone television networks air &quot;téléromans&quot;, including the public broadcaster Radio-Canada, which broadcasts them nationally, and the private networks TVA and Noovo. TFO in Ontario has also produced one téléroman.

In France, the TF1 network and the subscription channel Canal+ air &quot;feuilletons télévisés&quot;. Some famous téléromans produced in France include &quot;Riviera&quot;, &quot;Sous le soleil&quot;, &quot;Plus belle la vie&quot; and &quot;Cinq sœurs&quot;.

One of the first téléromans on Canadian television was &quot;La famille Plouffe&quot;. This &quot;téléroman&quot; proved highly successful, and has helped the genre become a staple on Canadian French television. English Canadian networks have also adapted a number of Québec téléromans for English viewers, including &quot;La famille Plouffe&quot;, &quot;Lance et Compte&quot; and &quot;Les Hauts et les bas de Sophie Paquin&quot;, with varying degrees of success.

<text>Künstlerleben (&quot;Artist&#x27;s Life&quot;), Op. 316 is a waltz written by Johann Strauss II in 1867, following closely on the success of the popular &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;. Austria was severely shaken the previous year 1866 by the crushing defeat that the Austrian army suffered in the Battle of Königgrätz and many of the year&#x27;s festivities and balls were cancelled as the prevalent depressing mood affected most of Vienna&#x27;s populace.

Strauss&#x27;s near impossible task of injecting the same joie de vivre into the Vienna Carnival of 1867 was met with great aplomb by all three Strauss brothers as their works displayed no signs of dying inspiration, and in turn introducing to the Viennese how their creative spirit defied the troubled spirit of the times.

Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss both presented sparkling new works at the &#x27;Hesperus&#x27; Ball which was held at the Dianabad-Saal on 18 February 1867, with the &quot;Artist&#x27;s Life&quot; waltz presented just three nights after the successful performance of &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; at the same venue. The &#x27;Hesperus&#x27; Association known as the Vienna Artists&#x27; Association was a well-known and influential society of which all three Strauss brothers were members.

The new waltz was quickly heralded as a new &#x27;twin&#x27; of &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; and its popularity has since been retained in the classical music repertoire. The composer&#x27;s best inspiration can be seen in the Introduction of the waltz, which begins with a plaintive horn solo and a quietly dramatic string passage in A minor. A pensive waltz melody in A major is introduced, before being cut short by two loud and fierce chords. The first waltz section is then played, with a high-spirited tune and a robust accompanying waltz passage. The second waltz section is a melancholic tune in two parts, with the same dramatic chords as heard in the Introduction before a more upbeat tune heralds the entry of the happier third section. The plaintive mood of the waltz continues in the fifth section before the minor-sounding Coda. The first waltz melody makes another quiet entrance before the waltz is brought to its triumphant close, with a strong chord and flourish, underlined by a snare-drumroll.
