<text>Grifters is an indie rock/alternative rock band based in Memphis who have released albums on Darla Records, Doink, Sonic Noise, Shangri-La Records, and Sub Pop Records. The band released five studio albums from 1992 to 1997. In the years following 1997, the band had breaks in activity with some members pursuing other musical projects and with the band sporadically touring in the years after. However, in recent years they have continued to tour on a consistent basis and have stated interest in recording new material. The band has released and reissued some of their material on Bandcamp.

==History==

===Founding, early years and Sub Pop records: 1989–1997===
The band originally formed in the late 1980s as A Band Called Bud, with vocalist/guitarist Scott Taylor, bassist Tripp Lamkins, and vocalist/drummer Dave Shouse who founded the band and became its leader. After being renamed Grifters (after the novel by Jim Thompson) by 1990, Shouse joined Taylor on guitar, with Stanley Gallimore taking over on the drums. Songwriting duties were shared between Shouse, Taylor, and Lamkins. For several years in the 1990s, they recorded primarily at Easley McCain Recording and were closely affiliated with Memphis&#x27;s Shangri-La Records label. Jeff Buckley was a vocal supporter of The Grifters and was close friends with the band.

The band released its first album on the Sonic Noise label in 1992, titled &quot;So Happy Together.&quot; The album had a very abrasive lo-fi sound with considerable noise, an approach to recording that was later avoided on subsequent releases. Following this, &quot;One Sock Missing&quot; succeeded in 1993 on Shangri-La Records. The album was similar to the first, albeit featured less lofi and noise signifying the cleaner sound that would become standard on later material. The album was much more successful than the first and garnered the band its first positive critical reception. Soon after, &quot;Crappin&#x27; You Negative&quot; was released in 1994 and garnered even greater critical acclaim, featuring an even mix of lo-fi and commercial production. The album is highlighted as the &quot;pick&quot; of the artist&#x27;s discography by Allmusic, signifying it as their favorite release of the band.

The band then released &quot;Ain&#x27;t My Lookout&quot; in 1996, the first on Sub Pop records. The band developed a clean and commercial sound on the album, with the lo-fi qualities of past material being devoid on this release. Following this, the band released its fifth and final album, titled &quot;Full Blown Possession&quot; in 1997 on sub pop records. The album largely continued the clean and commercial sound of their recent albums.

===Disbandment and side projects: 1997–2001===
Following the breakup of the band, each member pursued different projects. Dave Shouse worked on his side project &quot;Those Bastard Souls&quot; started in 1995, later to become his primary band. The project also featured vocalist and violinist Joan Wasser (Joan as police woman), drummer Kevin March (Dambuilders/later GBV member), Michael Tighe (Jeff Buckley collaborator/guitarist) and bassist/pianist Matt Fields (Red Red Meat).

Those Bastard Souls released two albums, its first in 1996 as an anonymous solo project of Shouse titled &quot;Twentieth Century Chemical.&quot; With the second titled &quot;Debt and Departure&quot; in 1999, featuring Wasser, March, Tighe and Fields first introduced on the album. The project became inactive in 2001. The Grifters would tour on a sporadic basis in the following years, but with no more new material since the late 90s.

===Recent years to present: 2001–present===
The band had a reunion tour in 2013, followed by another in 2014 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Crappin&#x27; You Negative.&quot; As of 2021, the band continues to tour and has shown interest in recording new material.

<doc id="1262999" wikidata="Q15044040" url="?curid=1262999" title="Postal voting">
<text>Postal voting is voting in an election where ballot papers are distributed to electors (and typically returned) by post, in contrast to electors voting in person at a polling station or electronically via an electronic voting system.

In an election, postal votes may be available on demand or limited to individuals meeting certain criteria, such as a proven inability to travel to a designated polling place. Most electors are required to apply for a postal vote, although some may receive one by default. In some elections postal voting is the only voting method allowed and is referred to as all-postal voting. With the exception of those elections, postal votes constitute a form of early voting and may be considered an absentee ballot.

Typically, postal votes must be mailed back before the scheduled election day. However, in some jurisdictions return methods may allow for dropping off the ballot in person via secure drop boxes or at voting centers. Postal votes may be processed by hand or scanned and counted electronically. The history of postal voting dates back to the 19th century, and modern-day procedures and availability vary by jurisdiction. Research, focused on the United States and using data from states where postal voting is widely available—California, Oregon and Washington—shows that the availability of postal voting tends to increase voter turnout.

Electoral laws typically stipulate a series of checks to protect against voter fraud and allow for the integrity and secrecy of the submitted ballot to be maintained. Known instances of fraud are very rare. Coordinated, large-scale fraud by postal voting is likely hard to pull off undetected because the large number of interested parties (such as officials, political operators, and journalists) as well as a large number of scholars and analysts who are capable of detecting statistical outliers in vote totals signifying large-scale fraud. Officials can confirm instances of fraud by checking signatures and conducting basic detective work.

==All-postal voting==
&quot;All-postal&quot; voting is a form of postal voting in which all electors receive their ballot papers through the post, not just those who requested an absentee ballot. Depending on the country, electors may have to return their ballot papers by post or they may be allowed to deliver them by hand to specified drop-off locations. All-postal voting is used in several states in the United States and in Switzerland, and was used in 2016 in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey as well as in four regions of the United Kingdom in the 2004 European Parliament election.

There is some evidence that all-postal voting leads to higher turnout than in-person voting or mail-in voting that requires voters to first request a ballot (rather than receive it automatically).

==By country==

===Australia===
At the 2016 Australian federal election, there were 1.2 million postal votes cast, amounting to 8.5 percent of total votes.

Postal voting in Australia was introduced for federal elections in 1902, and first used at the 1903 election. It was abolished by the Fisher government in 1910, following claims that it was open to abuse and biased towards rural voters. The Cook government&#x27;s bill to restore postal voting was one of the &quot;triggers&quot; for the double dissolution prior to the 1914 election. Postal voting was eventually restored by the Hughes government in 1918 and has not been challenged since, although the provisions and requirements have been amended on a number of occasions.

Prior to Federation in 1901, Western Australia introduced a form of postal voting in 1877 with strict eligibility criteria. South Australia introduced postal voting for seamen in 1890, and a further act in 1896 gave postal votes to any elector who would be more than from home on election day, as well as for any woman unable to travel &quot;by reason of her health&quot;. Victoria passed a similar law in 1899, and the first federal postal voting legislation was also modelled on the 1896 South Australian act.

====Procedure====
Postal voting at a federal level is governed by the &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918&quot; and administered by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). Postal votes are available to those who will be absent from their electoral division through travel, or who those are unable to attend a polling booth due to illness, infirmity, &quot;approaching childbirth&quot;, caring responsibilities, reasonable fears for their safety, religious beliefs, imprisonment, status as a silent elector, or employment reasons.

Eligible voters may make a postal vote application (PVA) prior to each election, or apply for status as a &quot;general postal voter&quot; and receive a postal ballot automatically. Postal voters receive their ballot(s) and a prepaid envelope containing their name and address, as well as a predetermined security question from the PVA. Voters are required to sign the envelope and provide the correct answer to the security question. They are also required to have a witness sign and date the envelope. As of 2016, postal votes were able to be received and entered into the count up to 13 days after election day. Following the 2016 election, it was observed that the strict scrutiny process afforded to postal votes was a &quot;significant contributor&quot; to delays in declaring the results of close elections.

===Austria===
Austria enabled postal voting in 2007 by amending Article 26 of the Constitution of Austria. Electors request an electoral card that can be completed in person or in private and sent via post. In the 2017 election, roughly 780,000 postal ballots were cast representing 15% of all ballots. In 2019, this number has increased to 1,070,000.

===Canada===
The ability to vote when in-person voting is not possible was first introduced with the federal &quot;Military Voters Act&quot; in 1917, giving all Canadian soldiers and their spouses the right to vote. Public servants became eligible in 1970. The right was further extended to civilian support personnel on Canadian Forces bases in the 1977. In 1993, Bill C-114 extended the special ballot vote (Special Voting Rules) by mail to all Canadian citizens.

Use of special voting rules, including mail voting, has grown with each election. In the 42nd general election (2015), the number of voters increased by 117 percent over the previous election to roughly 619,000. This number grew to roughly 660,000 in the 43rd election (2019) representing 3.6 percent of electors.

===Finland===
Finland introduced vote by post in 2019 for eligible voters living permanently abroad and eligible voters staying abroad at the time of the elections.

===France===
Postal voting existed in France until 1975, when it was banned (except in very limited circumstances) due to fears of voter fraud. The highly publicized use of widespread postal voting in the 2020 United States presidential election has reignited debate in France about the use of postal voting, but no consensus or concrete plans exist for reintroducing it.

===Germany===
Postal voting is common in Germany, with 47% of the electorate voting by post in the 2021 general election. Absentee voting has existed in Germany since 1957, originally in order to ensure that all German citizens, especially the old, sick, and disabled, and citizens living abroad, have the opportunity to participate in elections. At first, postal voters had to state why they could not cast their vote in person on Election Day; but this requirement was dropped in 2008, allowing everyone to use postal voting. Like in many other countries, in more recent years voting by mail has become increasingly popular among younger and non-disabled citizens residing within the country; as such, various tools are being developed to help citizens, both domestic and abroad, more easily apply for postal voting.

===Greece===

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced that postal voting will be used in the European Parliament Elections on June 9, 2024. He also said that the adoption of this option in European Parliament elections serves as a precursor to its implementation in national elections, which will be held in 2027

===Hungary===
Hungarian citizens living abroad who do not have an official address in Hungary are allowed to vote by mail. They are only allowed to vote for party lists, but not for local representatives. In the last parliamentary election in 2018, 267,233 votes (4.6% of all votes) were submitted via mail. 48% of all valid postal votes were submitted from Romania.

===India===
Postal voting in India is done only through the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot Papers (ETPB) system of Election Commission of India, where ballot papers are distributed to the registered eligible voters and they return the votes by post. When the counting of votes commences, these postal votes are counted first before the counting of votes from the electronic voting machines of all other voters. Only certain categories of people are eligible to register as postal voters. People working in the union armed forces and state police as well as their wives, and employees working for the Government of India who are officially posted abroad can register for the postal vote, these are also called &quot;service voters&quot;. Additionally, people in preventive detention, disabled and those above the age of 65 years old can use postal vote. Prisoners can not vote at all. Media persons too have been allowed to use the postal ballot to cast their vote. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has alleged that postal ballots &quot;will adversely effect the verifiability of a large number of voters, thus, transparency and integrity of the process&quot;, and expressed concerns with &quot;instances of manipulation and malpractice&quot; with postal ballots.

===Indonesia===

Eligible Indonesians living abroad are able to vote by mail in national elections by registering at the Indonesian overseas election commission in their country of residence. Beside presidential elections, they are also able to vote in DPR elections. All overseas Indonesian voters are included in the Jakarta 2nd constituency, which also contains Central and South Jakarta.

===Italy===

Since 2001 Italian citizens living abroad have the right to vote by mail in all referendums and national elections being held in Italy (provided they had registered their residence abroad with their relevant consulate).

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, opposition leader and former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim alleged that postal votes have been used by the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition in securing seats in certain constituencies. He also said that in one particular constituency (Setiawangsa), he claimed that his Parti Keadilan Rakyat had actually won during the 2008 elections, before 14,000 postal votes came in awarding the incumbent BN parliamentarian the seat with a majority of 8,000 votes. In Malaysia, only teachers, military personnel, and policemen based away from their constituencies are eligible to submit postal votes.

===Mexico===

In Mexico, since the 2006 federal elections, postal voting for people living abroad has been permitted. A request can be made to the National Electoral Institute which then sends the ballots outside the country.

===Norway===

Postal voting is accepted for voters who are staying abroad and are not close to a foreign station or other voting place. Voters can request ballots to be sent to them. Voters are also allowed to write their own ballots.

===Philippines===

Mail-in ballots are an option for Overseas Filipinos in select countries only. The general practise for local and overseas absentee voting in Philippine elections requires that ballots be cast in person at select polling places, such as a consulate office.

===Singapore===
Singaporean citizens living abroad may vote by post in presidential and parliamentary elections.

===Spain===
In Spain, for European, regional and municipal elections, voters who will be absent from their town on election day or are ill or disabled, may request a postal vote at a post office. The application must be submitted personally or through a representative in case of illness or disability certified by a medical certificate.

===Switzerland===

Swiss federal law allows postal voting in all federal elections and referendums, and all cantons also allow it for cantonal ballot issues. All voters receive their personal ballot by mail and may either cast it at a polling station or mail it back. As of 2019, approximately 90% of Swiss voters cast ballots using Remote Postal Voting.

===United Kingdom===

Absentee voting in the United Kingdom is allowed by proxy or post (known as &quot;postal voting on demand&quot;) for any elector. Postal voting does not require a reason, apart from in Northern Ireland, where postal voting is available only if it would be unreasonable to expect a voter to go to a polling station on polling day as a result of employment, disability or education restrictions. Postal voting is common in the United Kingdom; 8.4 million postal votes were issued, 18% of the UK electorate (18.2% England, 19.4% Scotland, 19.4% Wales and 1.9% N.Ireland) in the 2017 general election.

Proxy voting is allowed for people who will be away, working, or medically disabled, anyone eligible to vote in the election may be a proxy for close relatives and two unrelated people. The proxy voter for an elector can also be a postal voter, known as Postal Proxy voting. If a person becomes unable to vote in person within 6 days of an election, including up to 5pm on the polling day, they can apply for another person to vote on their behalf as an emergency proxy.

Postal voting in the UK has been (allegedly) subject to fraud, undue influence, theft and tampering; other forms of voting have also been subject to fraud. The number of cases reported to or by the Electoral Commission however is low. &quot;[T]hese concerns need to be balanced by the fact that it is entirely legitimate for political parties to encourage electors to vote, be it in person or by post&quot;.

===United States===

In the United States, postal voting (commonly referred to as mail-in voting, vote-by-mail or vote from home) is a process in which a ballot is mailed to the home of a registered voter, who fills it out and returns it via postal mail or by dropping it off in-person at a voting center or into a secure drop box. Deadlines are set under state law, with some states requiring ballots be received by election day and others allowing ballots to be received after election day so long as they are postmarked by election day. Vote-by-mail is available in both Republican and Democratic states, with research showing that the availability of postal voting increases voter turnout. Five states—Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington—hold elections almost entirely by mail.

It has been argued that postal voting has a greater risk of fraud than in-person voting, though there are few known instances of such fraud.
Mail-in ballots pose other challenges, including signature verification, prompt delivery of ballots, and issues that have led to evidence suggesting younger voters, as well as voters from racial and ethnic minorities, are more likely to have their vote-by-mail ballots rejected.

In the 2016 general election, approximately 33 million postal ballots were cast, about a quarter of all ballots cast. Some jurisdictions used only vote-by-mail and others used absentee voting by mail.

In April 2020, during lockdowns for the COVID-19 pandemic, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 58% of those polled would favor nationwide election reform to allow everyone to vote by mail. In the November 2020 presidential election, postal voting was an encouraged voting method in many locations due to the coronavirus pandemic. A poll by Pew Research Center found that 54% of people voted in person in the 2020 election compared to 46% who voted absentee or mail in. Despite the long history of postal voting and a large number of postal votes in the 2016 election, President Donald Trump has cast doubt on the integrity of unsolicited mail-in voting in the 2020 election. There is little evidence to support Trump&#x27;s claim that postal voting enables widespread election fraud.

Following false claim of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, Republican state lawmakers began an effort to roll back access to postal voting.

<text>Clark Kent Ervin (born April 1, 1959), currently the head of Homeland Security Program at the Aspen Institute, was the first Inspector General of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

==Political career==
He was appointed on December 26, 2003, in a recess appointment by President George W. Bush. Prior to appointment, he had served as the acting inspector general since January 10, 2003. During his tenure, Ervin issued a number of reports critical of mismanagement and security flaws at the newly formed Department. In December 2004, his recess appointment expired, and the White House declined to nominate him for confirmation by the United States Senate.

The end of his term was controversial. Critics viewed the lack of White House support as retribution for Ervin&#x27;s aggressive efforts to root out waste, fraud, and incompetence. For example, &quot;I think this was a voice that was a little too critical and made the administration a little too uncomfortable,&quot; said the executive director of the Project on Government Oversight. The White House disagreed with that perspective, saying &quot;His term expired and that&#x27;s that.&quot; In May 2006, Ervin published a book -- &quot;Open Target: Where America is Vulnerable to Attack&quot;—that gives details of his tenure at the DHS as well as his views on the current lack of preparedness for new terrorist attacks.

Prior to his service at DHS, Ervin served as the Inspector General of the United States Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Before his work for the Bush administration, Ervin served in Texas state government:
* From 1995 until 1999, he served as the Assistant Secretary of State of Texas; 
* From 1999 until April 2001, he served as Deputy Attorney General, General Counsel, and Director of Administration in the office of then Texas Attorney General John Cornyn.

Ervin served in the first Bush White House from 1989 to 1991 as the Associate Director of Policy in the Office of National Service. He returned to his native Houston in 1991 to run for the 29th Congressional district seat, winning the Republican nomination but losing the general election.

He served as the co-chairman for Barack Obama&#x27;s transition team for DHS in 2008. He also served as one of the eight members of the bi-partisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan.

==Law career==

Ervin has practiced law in the private sector in Houston twice, first with Vinson &amp; Elkins from 1985 to 1989, and later with Locke, Liddell &amp; Sapp from 1993-1995. Ervin is currently a partner in the Washington, DC law firm Squire Patton Boggs.

==Education==

Ervin graduated from The Kinkaid School in 1977, Harvard College in 1980, and Harvard Law School in 1985, all with honors. Between college and law school, Ervin studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, earning a master&#x27;s degree in 1982.

==Personal life==

Mr. Ervin is married to Carolyn A. Harris. He is Episcopalian and a parishioner at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C.

Ervin gets the name &quot;Clark Kent Ervin&quot; from his brother, Art, after the Superman alter-ego. The brother suggested the name on his day of birth after noting the fact that he was born a month premature and his desire to survive amidst all odds.

<doc id="1263005" wikidata="Q853768" url="?curid=1263005" title="Super Bowl XLIII">
<text>Super Bowl XLIII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champions Pittsburgh Steelers and the National Football Conference (NFC) champions Arizona Cardinals to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2008 season. The Steelers defeated the Cardinals by the score of 27–23. The game was played on February 1, 2009, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.

With this victory, the Steelers became the first team to win six Super Bowl championships. The win was also Pittsburgh&#x27;s second Super Bowl victory in four years, after winning Super Bowl XL at the end of the 2005 season. The Cardinals entered the game seeking their first NFL title since 1947, the longest championship drought in the league. The club became an unexpected winner during the regular season, compiling a 9–7 record, and earning a spot in the playoffs with the aid of head coach Ken Whisenhunt, who was the Steelers&#x27; offensive coordinator in Super Bowl XL, and the re-emergence of quarterback Kurt Warner, who was the Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl XXXIV with his former team, the St. Louis Rams.

Pittsburgh jumped to a 17–7 halftime lead, aided by linebacker James Harrison&#x27;s Super Bowl–record 100-yard interception return for a touchdown. Trailing 20–7 at the start of the fourth quarter, Arizona scored 16 consecutive points, including a safety that led to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald&#x27;s 64-yard touchdown reception, to take their first lead of the game with 2:37 remaining. But the Steelers marched 78 yards to score on wide receiver Santonio Holmes&#x27;s 6-yard game-winning touchdown catch with 35 seconds left. Holmes, who caught nine passes for 131 yards and a touchdown, including four receptions for 73 yards on that final game-winning drive, was named Super Bowl MVP. He became the sixth wide receiver to win the award, half of whom at the time were Steelers players (Lynn Swann and Hines Ward).

The NBC television network broadcast attracted an average U.S. audience of 98.7 million viewers, making it the most watched Super Bowl in history at that time and the most watched Super Bowl of the 2000s. Many media outlets consider this one of the best Super Bowls from the 2000s, as well as one of the greatest Super Bowls of all time, due to the performance of both teams as well as its thrilling finale. This game was ranked No. 4 on NFL Top 10 on NFL Network for &quot;Top 10 Greatest Games of All Time&quot; and ranked No. 1 for &quot;Top 10 Super Bowls.&quot; , this is the Steelers&#x27; most recent Super Bowl championship, and the last title by a Pennsylvania-based NFL team until their cross-state rival Philadelphia Eagles won Super Bowl LII in 2018. It was also the last time a Phoenix-based team reached the championship round of the four major North American sports leagues until the Phoenix Suns made the NBA Finals in 2021.

This was the last game to feature famed commentator John Madden, who retired two months after the game.

This was also the last Super Bowl to air on analog television, as the Digital television transition in the United States required all full-power stations to convert to digital beginning on June 12, 2009.

==Background==

===Host selection process===
Tampa was selected for the game site on May 25, 2005, beating out three other finalists: Atlanta, Houston, and Miami. Super Bowl XLIII was the second Super Bowl at this venue and the fourth overall in that city.

In February 2008, the Tampa Bay Super Bowl Host Committee unveiled the Super Bowl XLIII logo, featuring an abstract representation of a football stadium, with blue and green colors representing the regional waterways and landscapes of Tampa Bay. Eight yards of playing field are shown, alluding to the game&#x27;s status as the championship of the 2008 NFL season. In a tradition starting with the Super Bowl XL logo, two stars—one red, representing the AFC, and one blue, representing the NFC—are flanked on either side of the Super Bowl XLIII logo. The tagline for Super Bowl XLIII as well as the 2008 NFL season is &quot;Believe In Now&quot;.

===Teams===
The seeds of Super Bowl XLIII can be traced back to the end of the 2006 season. After winning Super Bowl XL in 2005, the Pittsburgh Steelers fell to an 8–8 record the following year. At the end of 2006, Bill Cowher ended his 15-year tenure as their head coach, leaving with a 149–90–1 regular season record and a 12–9 record in the playoffs. Offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt and assistant head coach Russ Grimm were considered most likely to succeed Cowher in Pittsburgh.

Without waiting to see if he would be hired by Pittsburgh, Whisenhunt accepted the head coaching job with the Arizona Cardinals, a team that at the time held the second-longest championship drought in U.S. sports (1947, with only the Chicago Cubs having a longer drought, winning their last championship in 1908) and had never advanced to the Super Bowl in their franchise history. In the 60 years since their last national championship, the team had won just one playoff game (20–7 over the Dallas Cowboys in the 1998 NFC Wild Card Game). The Steelers then passed over Grimm and instead hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin. Once Tomlin was hired by the Steelers, Grimm joined Whisenhunt in Arizona in the same position as assistant head coach as he had in Pittsburgh, and the two of them began to remodel the perennial losing club into a winner like the Steelers.

Of historical note the game matched up two franchises previously merged into a single team, &quot;Card-Pitt&quot;, for the 1944 season in response to the depleted rosters during World War II. Pittsburgh was going for its sixth Super Bowl win, which would place it in sole possession of the record for most Super Bowl wins, while the Cardinals were seeking their first league title since 1947 and only the second undisputed league championship in their history. (In 1925, the Pottsville Maroons (who, like Pittsburgh, were based in Pennsylvania) were fined and suspended for playing a game against the Notre Dame football team in another NFL franchise&#x27;s territory, which resulted in the NFL naming the Cardinals, then based in Chicago, NFL champions in their place, a decision Pottsville disputed). It was the third Super Bowl in history to feature two pre-expansion-era (pre-1960) teams, joining Super Bowl XIV (Steelers vs. Los Angeles Rams, the latter of which coincidentally also went 9–7 in the regular season) and Super Bowl XLI (Indianapolis Colts vs. Chicago Bears). This game also featured the oldest franchise in the NFC playing the oldest franchise in the AFC. The Cardinals were founded in 1898 as an independent amateur team in Chicago. The Steelers, founded in 1933 as the Pittsburgh Pirates, are one of only three AFC teams that pre-date the 1960 NFL season. The Cardinals and Steelers played each other twice per season from 1950 through 1969, first in the American Conference (1950–52), then in the Eastern Conference (1953–66), and finally in the Century Division of the Eastern Conference (1967–69).

It also was the first time that two quarterbacks who previously started for a Super Bowl winning team (Kurt Warner and Ben Roethlisberger) opposed one another since Jim Plunkett&#x27;s Los Angeles Raiders defeated Joe Theismann&#x27;s Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII. Warner started for the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV and Super Bowl XXXVI, winning the first (aided by a heads-up defensive play by linebacker Mike Jones on the final play of the game) and losing the second one (the first of Tom Brady&#x27;s seven in ten attempts), while Roethlisberger was the winning quarterback in Super Bowl XL.

====Pittsburgh Steelers====

Under Tomlin&#x27;s first season as head coach, the Steelers improved to a 10–6 record in 2007. Pittsburgh finished the 2008 season with the second best record in the AFC at 12–4, making the playoffs for the sixth time in the last eight seasons, and went on to earn their seventh Super Bowl trip in franchise history, breaking a three-way tie with the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos for second most Super Bowl appearances and most Super Bowl appearances by an AFC team.

The Steelers excelled on defense and led the NFL in fewest points (13.9) and yards (237.2) allowed per game, while also ranking second in sacks with 51. Up front, their line was anchored by defensive end Aaron Smith, who recorded 60 tackles and six sacks. Behind him two of the Steelers starting linebackers ranked among the top-ten sack leaders in the NFL, LaMarr Woodley (11.5 sacks) and Pro Bowler/NFL Defensive Player of the Year James Harrison (16 sacks). Pro Bowl linebacker James Farrior was also a big contributor, recording 3.5 sacks and leading the team with 133 tackles. The Steelers secondary was led by Pro Bowl safety Troy Polamalu, who ranked second in the NFL with a career-high seven interceptions.

For the fifth year in a row the Steelers offense was led by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who finished the season with 3,301 passing yards and 17 touchdowns, with 15 interceptions. His top target was the Steelers all-time receiving leader Hines Ward, who recorded his fifth 1,000-yard season with 81 receptions for 1,043 yards and seven touchdowns. Other reliable receiving options included Santonio Holmes (55 receptions for 821 yards), Nate Washington (40 receptions for 631 yards), and tight end Heath Miller (48 receptions for 514 yards). The Steelers ground game was led by two-time Pro Bowl running back Willie Parker, who had rushed for over 1,200 yards in each of his previous three seasons. Injuries in 2008 limited him to 791 yards in 11 games, but running back Mewelde Moore proved to be a solid replacement, rushing for 588 yards and catching 40 passes for 320 yards.

For their efforts, Tomlin won the 2008 Motorola Coach of the Year Award and Harrison was named the 2008 GMC Sierra Defensive Player of the Year. The Steelers rolled into the post-season as the AFC&#x27;s second seed, behind only the Tennessee Titans, who would finish 13–3 but lose in their divisional playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens.

====Arizona Cardinals====
It had been a long journey for Arizona to get to their first Super Bowl appearance. After winning the NFL championship in 1947, it would take the team half a century (and moves to two different states) before they won another postseason game in the 1998 season. And up to this point, they had not returned to the playoffs since then.

Under Whisenhunt&#x27;s first season as head coach, the Cardinals finished with an 8–8 record in 2007. Arizona then started out the 2008 season strong, winning 7 of their first 10 games. But then things fell apart as the team lost 4 of their last 6, hitting a low point with a brutal 47–7 loss to the New England Patriots in week 16. Arizona&#x27;s 34–21 win over the Seattle Seahawks in the following week was just enough for them to finish with a 9–7 record and earn the #4 seed in the playoffs, where they went on to earn their first trip to the Super Bowl in franchise history, becoming only the second NFL team to do so with nine wins up to that point (the 2011 New York Giants became the third, winning it all).

One reason for Arizona&#x27;s success was the re-emergence of 37-year-old quarterback Kurt Warner. After going undrafted and spending a few years in the Arena Football League, Warner became the St. Louis Rams starting quarterback in 1999 due to a pre-season injury of starter Trent Green. He went on to lead the Rams to two Super Bowls and one Super Bowl win (in which Warner was named MVP), while also winning two NFL MVP Awards. But in 2002, Warner&#x27;s production was drastically reduced by injuries and he soon lost his starting job to Marc Bulger. He eventually left the team to join the New York Giants, but once again he lost his starting job (replaced by Eli Manning) and signed on with the Cardinals in 2005. For the third time, Warner lost his starting job due to mediocre performances and injuries. After the season, Arizona selected Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Matt Leinart with their first round draft pick. This, combined with another mediocre performance in the 2006 season, appeared to severely limit Warner&#x27;s chances of ever being a permanent starter on the team. However, early in the 2007 season, Warner was thrust into the starting lineup to replace an injured Leinart, and by the end of the team&#x27;s season, he had re-emerged as one of the top quarterbacks in the league, throwing 27 touchdown passes with a passer rating of 89.8.

With his starting job on the team more secure, Warner posted one of his best seasons in 2008, throwing for 4,583 yards and 30 touchdowns, with only 14 interceptions, giving him an NFC-best 96.9 rating. His top targets were receivers Larry Fitzgerald (96 receptions, 1,431 yards, 12 touchdowns), Anquan Boldin (89 receptions, 1,038 yards, 11 touchdowns), and Steve Breaston (77 receptions, 1,006 yards, three touchdowns, 904 special teams return yards), who made the Cardinals the fifth team ever to feature three players with over 1,000 receiving yards. The Cardinals ground game was led by veteran running back Edgerrin James and rookie Tim Hightower. James led the team with 514 yards, while Hightower rushed for 399 and scored 10 touchdowns. He was also a reliable target out of the backfield, catching 34 passes for another 237 yards. Overall, Arizona&#x27;s offense ranked fourth in yards per game (365.8) and third in scoring (422 points) in 2008.

The Cardinals defense, however, had played inconsistently during the regular season, ranking just 28th in points allowed. Up front their line was anchored by defensive lineman Bertrand Berry, who recorded five sacks and forced two fumbles, along with tackle Darnell Dockett, known for his ability to blow up running plays. Linebacker Karlos Dansby was also a solid contributor, recording four sacks, two interceptions, and two forced fumbles, while also leading the team with 119 tackles. The Cardinals secondary was led by rookie cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (who led the team with four interceptions) and Pro Bowl safety Adrian Wilson (fourth on the team in tackles, 75).

===Playoffs===
The Steelers began their Super Bowl run with a 35–24 win over the fourth-seeded San Diego Chargers, gaining 342 yards, avoiding any turnovers, holding the ball for 36:30 (including for 14:43 in the third quarter alone, an NFL record for a single quarter), and scoring a touchdown in every quarter. Also, Parker appeared to be fully recovered from his regular season injuries, as evidenced by his career postseason high 147-yard, two-touchdown performance against the Chargers. The Steelers then went on to beat, for the third time in the season, their AFC North division archrivals, the sixth-seeded Baltimore Ravens 23–14 in the AFC Championship Game, holding them to 184 yards and forcing five turnovers.

The Cardinals advanced to the Super Bowl by beating the fifth-seeded Atlanta Falcons 30–24, the second-seeded Carolina Panthers, 33–13, and the sixth-seeded Philadelphia Eagles 32–25 in the NFC Championship Game, winning more playoff games this season than they had in their franchise history previously. Warner played exceptionally well in those games, throwing for a total of 661 yards and eight touchdowns, with only two interceptions, giving him a rating of 112.1. The Cardinals also got a big performance out of Larry Fitzgerald, who caught 23 passes for a postseason record 419 yards and five touchdowns. Meanwhile, the Cardinals&#x27; 28th-ranked defense showed major improvement in the postseason, forcing twelve turnovers in their three games. This included five interceptions and one fumble from the Panthers&#x27; Pro Bowl quarterback Jake Delhomme in the divisional round.

The Cardinals became the third NFL team to advance to the Super Bowl after winning three playoff games despite winning its division; the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII and the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLI were the other two. In addition, they would become the first team to advance to the Super Bowl as both a division winner and a No. 4 seed. The 2000 Baltimore Ravens were the last No. 4 seed to advance to a Super Bowl before this game, as they were the No. 4 seed in the AFC when they went on to win Super Bowl XXXV, but were a wild-card team before the 2002 realignment gave each conference four divisions.

===Super Bowl pre-game notes===
The AFC champion Steelers stayed at the InterContinental Tampa and held their pre-game practices at the training facility of the University of South Florida Bulls. The NFC champion Cardinals were based at the Grand Hyatt Tampa Bay and held their practices at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers&#x27; training facility. Both teams arrived in the Tampa area on Monday, January 26.

Also on January 26, the NFL announced that the Super Bowl game would be one of the safest places in the United States during game time. Personnel from over 20 different federal agencies were on site to assist in protecting players and fans.

Pittsburgh entered the game as seven-point favorites over Arizona. Major factors for this included the view that the Steelers&#x27; defense was better than that of the Cardinals and the feeling that the AFC was an overall better conference than the NFC.

The Cardinals were the designated &quot;home team,&quot; as was the case for all NFC champions in odd numbered Super Bowls. Arizona wore their red jerseys, which it has done at home since moving into University of Phoenix Stadium in 2006 after predominantly wearing their white jerseys at home for their first 18 years in Arizona to combat the intense heat of September and October. As a result, the Steelers wore white jerseys for their second consecutive Super Bowl.

Pittsburgh improved to 3–0 lifetime wearing white jerseys in the Super Bowl after the victory in Super Bowl XLIII (Pittsburgh would eventually lose to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV while wearing white jerseys). The other two times the team wore white was as the &quot;visiting team&quot; against the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IX (during a time when the designated &quot;home&quot; team was required to wear their team-colored jerseys) and against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL despite being the &quot;home team&quot; that season but having road success in the playoffs. In addition, teams wearing white jerseys in the Super Bowl extended their winning streak to five games, dating back to Super Bowl XXXIX, currently the longest such streak between white and team colored jerseys in Super Bowl history. Pittsburgh also improved to 3–0 lifetime against NFC West teams in the Super Bowl, having previously beaten the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV and the Seahawks in XL.

Another pre-game storyline involved backup Steelers tight end/fullback Sean McHugh. McHugh, who had spent the past three seasons with the Detroit Lions, made that team&#x27;s 53-man roster at the end of the preseason, only to be released 24 hours later alongside linebacker Anthony Cannon in order for the Lions to make room for linebacker Ryan Nece and running back Marcus Thomas. The Steelers promptly signed McHugh after the team traded center Sean Mahan back to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for a draft pick before the start of the season. The subsequent media attention surrounding McHugh had to do with him being deemed not good enough for the Lions (a team that would finish 0–16, the NFL&#x27;s first winless season since the expansion 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers), but good enough for a Super Bowl team such as the Steelers and being a valuable blocker for Ben Roethlisberger and Willie Parker. McHugh himself had mixed feelings about the situation, feeling bad for his former Lions teammates, but also feeling it&#x27;s a little payback for the Lions for releasing him in the first place. McHugh would play in the Super Bowl as a blocker, much like his regular season role.

The Cardinals became the second team to have their city/state location painted in their end zone for a Super Bowl, as their end zone read &quot;Arizona Cardinals.&quot; In Super Bowl XL, the Seattle Seahawks became the first team to have this, as their end zone read &quot;Seattle Seahawks.&quot; For all other Super Bowl teams, end zones have just featured the team nickname. This was also the first Super Bowl to have the updated NFL logo painted at midfield.

==Economic effects==
With all the cutbacks resulting from the severe economic downturn in the United States, the game was dubbed &quot;The Recession Bowl.&quot; Restaurants were slow in business and many parties, including parties hosted by &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; were canceled. There were also 200 fewer sports journalists covering the game than at Super Bowl XLII the previous year. According to the online broker StubHub, tickets with a face value of $500 changed hands the week of the Super Bowl for an average $2,500—a 40% drop from Super Bowl XLII in 2008 and 16% lower than Super Bowl XL in 2006. Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, the Big Three automobile makers, decided not to purchase television advertisements following the three companies&#x27; business struggles in 2008 and early 2009.

==Broadcasting==
===Television===
====United States====
The game was televised live in the United States on NBC, the network&#x27;s first Super Bowl broadcast since Super Bowl XXXII at the end of the 1997 season.

Play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color commentator John Madden were in the booth, with Andrea Kremer and Alex Flanagan serving as sideline reporters. Madden became the first person to have announced a Super Bowl for all of the four major U.S. television networks, having called five Super Bowls for CBS, three for Fox, and two for ABC prior to joining NBC in 2006. Meanwhile, Al Michaels was the third man to do play-by-play for a Super Bowl on NBC television (following in the footsteps of Curt Gowdy and Dick Enberg). Also, Michaels (who, like Madden, had moved from ABC to NBC in 2006) was the second person to serve as a Super Bowl play-by-play announcer for two major U.S. television networks (following Pat Summerall of CBS and Fox). This would prove to be the final game Madden would call, as he announced his retirement from broadcasting on April 16, 2009.

The pregame show, a record five hours long at the time, was hosted by the &quot;Football Night in America&quot; team headed by Bob Costas, and preceded by a two-hour special edition of &quot;Today&quot; hosted by the regular weekday team live from Tampa and the NFL Films—produced &quot;Road to the Super Bowl&quot;. Matt Millen was part of the coverage as a studio analyst. The&quot; Today&quot; contribution included portions of a taped interview with President Barack Obama and pictures of troops viewing the proceedings in Iraq.

The Super Bowl was one of two major professional sports championship series NBC broadcast in 2009, as they would also broadcast the Stanley Cup Finals. Both championship series involved teams from Pittsburgh winning championships. Mike Emrick, Eddie Olczyk, and Pierre McGuire mentioned this when they called the Stanley Cup Finals.

The broadcast was available in 1080i high definition. Super Bowl XLIII was also the final Super Bowl simulcast in the analog television format in the United States before the 2009 completion of nationwide digital television transition. The transition, originally scheduled for February 17 was pushed back to June 12, the same day the Penguins won the Stanley Cup.

In Tucson, Arizona and surrounding areas, the analog but not digital feed of the cable service from Comcast was interrupted by an unknown party, when 30 seconds from Playboy Enterprises-owned adult cable television channel Shorteez was broadcast to homes just after Larry Fitzgerald scored his fourth-quarter touchdown to give the Cardinals a 23–20 lead. Minutes before this occurred, 10 seconds of an end-credit segment from ClubJenna, another Playboy-owned channel, was shown. Comcast offered a $10 credit for customers who claimed to have seen the incident, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that it would investigate the cause of the incident. On February 4, 2011, Tucson Police and the FBI arrested Frank Tanori Gonzalez on suspicion of fraud and computer tampering in connection with the porn incident. Gonzalez eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years of probation.

The telecast was also carried to U.S. service personnel stationed around the globe via the American Forces Network.

=====Ratings=====
With an average U.S. audience of 98.7 million viewers (and an estimated total viewership of 151.6 million), this was the third most watched Super Bowl in history, and the fourth most watched U.S. television program of any kind, trailing only Super Bowl XLV in 2011, which drew an average audience of 111 million; Super Bowl XLIV in 2010, average audience 106.5 million; and the final episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in 1983, average audience 106 million. However, the national Nielsen ratings of 42.0 was lower than the 43.3 rating for the previous year&#x27;s game. The telecast drew a 53.6 rating in Pittsburgh and a 47.5 rating in Phoenix, first and ninth, respectively, among local markets.

=====Advertising=====
In addition to featuring the game&#x27;s first 1-second TV ad (courtesy of Miller High Life), Super Bowl XLIII marked the first time that a 30-second commercial time slot cost up to US$3 million for the airtime alone, excluding production and talent costs. Many traditional advertisers, such as Anheuser-Busch and PepsiCo, bought multiple ads at discounted rates. None of the &quot;Big Three&quot; U.S. automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) ran advertisements during the game; coupled with Cash4Gold.com&#x27;s third-quarter ad, this was seen as a sign of how deep the recession that began in fall 2008 had become. A short trailer for &quot;&quot; premiered during the Super Bowl, a debut which director Michael Bay first revealed would occur in January. A preview of the upcoming &quot;Star Trek&quot; film also premiered during the game. However, with the weak economy, NBC was thought to have turned to companies already buying ad time for an additional purchase or two as set by the Los Angeles-based Forza Migliozzi agency, which would have eight advertisers simultaneously in one 30-second ad. SoBe and DreamWorks Animation aired a 3-D trailer for the upcoming film &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;, along with a 3-D ad for Sobe Life Water that featured Ray Lewis and Matt Light dancing &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (renamed &quot;Lizard Lake&quot; for this ad), as well as the promo for the upcoming episode of &quot;Chuck&quot; in 3-D. About 150 million &quot;ColorCode 3-D&quot; glasses were given away at grocery stores across the country for the ad. Hyundai also advertised its new Genesis Coupe in two 30-second commercials. All advertising slots were sold out one day before the game, resulting in sales of $206 million.

The top five ads as chosen by the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter were:
# Doritos&#x27; fan-made ad about &quot;free Doritos&quot; being seen in a &quot;crystal ball&quot;, with different results for two co-workers. Joseph and Dave Herbert from Batesville, Indiana, creators of the ad, won US$1,000,000;
# Budweiser&#x27;s Clydesdale love affair with a dancing horse;
# Another Budweiser ad seeing another Clydesdale playing fetch showing off after the beer wagon&#x27;s Dalmatian fetches a small stick;
# A Bridgestone ad with Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head driving in a toy car on a twisty road;
# Another Doritos ad that shows the power of crunch with a woman being stripped down to her underwear, free money from an ATM and a policeman being turned into a monkey.

YouTube&#x27;s top five in &quot;Ad Blitz 2009&quot; also saw the two Doritos ads finish first and fifth. The middle three featured E-Trade&#x27;s Singing Baby ad, CareerBuilder.com&#x27;s &quot;The Official 2009 Super Bowl Commercial&quot; and Pepsi Max&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Good&quot; finish second through fourth respectively.

Adbowl results reflected the following ranking:
# Bridgestone: Taters
# Bridgestone: Hot Item
# Doritos: Crystal Ball
# Coca-Cola: Heist
# Pepsi Max: I&#x27;m Good

===Radio===
On radio, Westwood One had the national English-language broadcast rights to the game in the United States and Canada. It was only made available to local affiliates as part of a 57-game package of regular season and post-season games. Stations were not allowed to stream the broadcast on their web sites. Marv Albert and Boomer Esiason called the game for the network. The teams&#x27; flagship stations also carried the game with their respective local announcers: WDVE-FM and WBGG-AM in Pittsburgh (with Bill Hillgrove and Tunch Ilkin announcing), and KTAR-AM/FM in Phoenix (with Dave Pasch and Ron Wolfley announcing). Univision Radio/United Stations carried a Spanish-language feed for Hispanophone American listeners (with Clemson Smith-Muñiz and David Crommett announcing).

==Entertainment and other ceremonies==

===Pregame===


Journey and the Bethune-Cookman University Marching Wildcats performed during the pre-game show, while Jennifer Hudson sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; (arranged by Chris Walden) in her first public appearance since the murder of her nephew, brother and mother. Hudson became the second consecutive alumna from the &quot;American Idol&quot; television series to perform the national anthem at a Super Bowl (Jordin Sparks sang the anthem at Super Bowl XLII). The national anthem was translated into American Sign Language by Kristen Santos. Following the anthem, the United States Air Force Thunderbirds performed a fly-over. John Legend performed a short concert several hours before the game, while Faith Hill performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; prior to Hudson&#x27;s performance of the national anthem. Also, the crew of US Airways Flight 1549 were recognized on field for their actions.

The NFL saluted four decades of champions during the coin toss ceremony and the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation. The coin toss featured Roger Craig (Super Bowl XXIII, 1989), John Elway (Super Bowl XXXIII, 1999), and Lynn Swann (Super Bowl XIII, 1979). Craig followed the previous year&#x27;s participants and fellow San Francisco 49ers Craig Walsh (son of Bill Walsh), Ronnie Lott, Jerry Rice, and Steve Young. General David Petraeus performed the actual coin toss. The Steelers called tails, but it landed on heads, so the Cardinals won the toss. Arizona deferred their choice to the second half, and the Steelers chose to receive, making it the first time in Super Bowl history that the coin toss winner kicked off to start the game. (The NFL had just changed the rule before the start of the season allowing the team that wins the coin toss to defer the choice to the second half, similar to that in college football and Canadian football.) By winning the toss, the Arizona Cardinals were the twelfth consecutive coin toss winner from the NFC, dating back to Super Bowl XXXII. Joe Namath (Super Bowl III, 1969) participated in the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation and he previously participated in the coin toss in Super Bowl XXVIII. Coincidentally, Namath—a native of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh—ultimately handed the trophy to his hometown team.

===Halftime===

The Super Bowl XLIII halftime show, which was sponsored by Bridgestone for the second consecutive year, featured Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, with the Miami Horns and a gospel choir. Their halftime performance consisted of these songs in the following order:

* &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;
* &quot;Born to Run&quot;
* &quot;Working on a Dream&quot;
* &quot;Glory Days&quot;
Each of the numbers had at least one verse removed, in order to fit the overall performance in the intended 12-minute time limit. Springsteen had turned down numerous invitations to play at the Super Bowl before this one, unsure of its legitimacy, but finally accepted after realizing the prestige value.

===Home video===
The Steelers 2008 season/Super Bowl XLIII championship home video went on sale on DVD on February 24, 2009. One week later on March 3, it was released on Blu-ray, making it the first NFL Films home video release to be on Blu-ray Disc.

==Game summary==

===First quarter===
The Steelers took the opening kickoff and moved down the field on a 71-yard scoring drive, with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing a 38-yard pass to wide receiver Hines Ward and a 21-yard strike to tight end Heath Miller, putting the ball on the Arizona 1-yard line. The Cardinals&#x27; defense kept the Steelers&#x27; offense out of the end zone for the first two plays, but on third down, Roethlisberger appeared to score on a 1-yard quarterback draw. However, a replay challenge by Arizona determined that his knee hit the ground as he was being tackled by defensive lineman Darnell Dockett before he could stretch the ball over the goal line. Rather than take the risk on fourth down, Pittsburgh settled for an 18-yard field goal by kicker Jeff Reed to take a 3–0 lead. The Steelers quickly forced a Cardinals punt and then drove back down the field for what would turn into more points. On the first play of their drive, Roethlisberger completed a 25-yard pass to wide receiver Santonio Holmes and followed it up with two 11-yard completions to Miller, the second of which was a 3rd-and-10 conversion.

===Second quarter===
On the second play of the second quarter, running back Gary Russell went into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the Steelers&#x27; lead to 10–0. They became the first team to score on its first two drives since the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXII. On defense, Pittsburgh held Arizona to just one drive and one first down in the first quarter, while gaining 135 yards.

The Cardinals responded with a nine-play, 83-yard scoring drive. First, quarterback Kurt Warner completed three passes to running back Edgerrin James for 26 yards, as well as two passes to wide receiver Steve Breaston for 20. Warner then completed a 45-yard strike to wide receiver Anquan Boldin to reach the Pittsburgh 1-yard line. On the next play, Warner nearly fell over after taking the snap, but he quickly regained his balance and threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Ben Patrick, cutting Arizona&#x27;s deficit to 10–7. It was Patrick&#x27;s only touchdown reception of the season. After an exchange of punts, Roethlisberger threw a pass that was deflected by defensive tackle Bryan Robinson and intercepted by linebacker Karlos Dansby at the Steelers&#x27; 34-yard line just before the two-minute warning. Seven plays later, the Cardinals reached the Pittsburgh 1-yard line with a chance to take the lead before halftime. But with 18 seconds left, Warner&#x27;s pass intended for Boldin was intercepted at the goal line by linebacker James Harrison, who then took off down the sideline for the then-longest play in Super Bowl history (having since been passed by Jacoby Jones&#x27; 108-yard kickoff return in Super Bowl XLVII), a 100-yard pick-six, increasing the Steelers&#x27; lead to 17–7 at halftime. Harrison faked a blitz and quietly moved into coverage to pick off Warner&#x27;s pass. A booth review was called to verify that Harrison had broken the plane, as he was tackled at the goal line by Breaston and wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, and the ruling stood.

===Third quarter===
After forcing the Cardinals to punt to start the second half, the Steelers put together another long scoring drive. Aided by two 15-yard gains by Holmes and running back Willie Parker, as well as three personal foul penalties against the Arizona defense, including one during a field goal attempt, Pittsburgh moved the ball 79 yards in 15 plays and took 8:39 off the clock. However, despite picking up two first downs inside the Arizona 10, they were unable to get into the end zone, forcing them to settle for Reed&#x27;s 21-yard field goal to increase their lead to 20–7.

===Fourth quarter===
After the teams traded punts again going into the fourth quarter, Warner led the Cardinals down the field on an eight-play, 87-yard scoring drive that took 3:57 off the clock, utilizing a no huddle offense. All eight plays of the drive were consecutive short passes by Warner, half of which were caught by Fitzgerald for a total gain of 31 yards, including a 1-yard touchdown in which Warner threw a fade pass to Fitzgerald, who made a leaping catch through tight coverage by cornerback Ike Taylor. The score cut Arizona&#x27;s deficit to one possession at 20–14 with 7:33 left in the game.

On the Cardinals&#x27; next possession, they reached the Pittsburgh 26-yard line, but a holding penalty pushed them nearly out of field goal range. Warner then threw three consecutive incompletions, and Arizona elected to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field goal attempt. Ben Graham&#x27;s 34-yard punt pinned the Steelers back at their own 1-yard line. After being stopped for no gain on the first two plays, Roethlisberger threw a 19-yard pass to Holmes, but Steelers center Justin Hartwig was flagged for offensive holding in the end zone, which not only nullified the catch, but gave the Cardinals a safety, cutting the Steelers&#x27; lead to 20–16 and forcing them to punt the ball away. Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin later stated that giving up the safety didn&#x27;t faze him, as it did not change how his team called plays for the rest of the game on either defense or offense. Taking over on their own 36-yard line after the free kick, Arizona took two plays to score, as Warner threw a pass to Fitzgerald on a post route. Fitzgerald caught the ball without breaking stride and took off down the middle of the field past the Steelers&#x27; secondary for a 64-yard touchdown reception, giving Arizona their first lead of the game, 23–20.

With a chance to mount a game-tying/winning drive, Pittsburgh got the ball back on their own 22-yard line with 2:37 left in the game and two timeouts remaining. On the first play, a holding penalty pushed them back to their own 12. Roethlisberger then completed a pass to Holmes for 14 yards. After an incompletion, Roethlisberger threw it to Holmes again for 13 yards. An 11-yard reception by wide receiver Nate Washington followed, and a 4-yard run by Roethlisberger forced the Steelers to burn their second timeout of the half. On the very next play, he completed a pass to Holmes, who took it 40 yards to the Cardinals&#x27; 6-yard line after safety Aaron Francisco tripped. Two plays later, Roethlisberger found running back Mewelde Moore covered in the flat, then Ward covered. He looked and then threw to Holmes, who ran a flag route in the right corner. Holmes caught the pass in the back corner of the end zone for a 6-yard touchdown reception, managing to keep both feet in bounds while landing on his toes before falling out of bounds. &quot;My feet never left the ground,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;All I did was extend my arms and use my toes as an extension to catch up to the ball.&quot; After a booth review, the touchdown stood and put the Steelers back in front with a 27–23 lead and 35 seconds remaining. Following the ensuing kickoff, Warner completed a 20-yard pass to Fitzgerald and a 13-yard pass to running back J. J. Arrington, moving the ball to the Steelers 44. With 15 seconds left, Warner prepared to attempt a Hail Mary pass, but linebacker LaMarr Woodley strip-sacked Warner, and defensive end Brett Keisel recovered the fumble, giving the ball back to Pittsburgh with five seconds left. Many viewers assumed that the play had not been reviewed for a possible incomplete pass, but NFL Head of Officiating Mike Pereira later explained that it actually was reviewed, unnoticed by the public: &quot;We confirmed it was a fumble. The replay assistant in the replay booth saw it was clearly a fumble. The ball got knocked loose and was rolling in his hand before it started forward. He has to have total control.&quot; It was the first and only Super Bowl in which Warner was involved not to be decided on the final play of the game. Roethlisberger&#x27;s ensuing kneeldown secured the Steelers&#x27; sixth Super Bowl victory, surpassing the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers to set a new NFL record for most Super Bowl wins by a team.

===Box score===




===Statistical overview===
In Super Bowl XLIII, Arizona and Pittsburgh combined for the fewest rushing attempts (38) and the fewest rushing yards (91) in Super Bowl history. The Cardinals outgained the Steelers in both passing yards (374 to 234) and total yards (407 to 292), but were flagged for 11 penalties for 106 yards. Arizona&#x27;s safety in the fourth quarter was only the sixth one scored in Super Bowl history and the first since Super Bowl XXV.

Warner completed 31 of 43 passes for 377 yards and three touchdowns, with one interception. His 377 yards was the second-most in Super Bowl history behind his own record of 414 yards in Super Bowl XXXIV. Eight years later at Super Bowl LI, Tom Brady would break Kurt Warner&#x27;s record with 466 yards. Warner passed Joe Montana for most career yards in Super Bowl history with 1,156 (Montana threw for 1,142 yards in four games). Brady ultimately reached 2,071 yards in seven Super Bowls. Warner became the fifth quarterback in Super Bowl history to throw three touchdown passes in defeat (the others being Roger Staubach, Brett Favre, Jake Delhomme, and Donovan McNabb). He also became the first quarterback in Super Bowl history to have a pass intercepted and returned for a touchdown in two different Super Bowls and is also the second quarterback to throw a fourth-quarter touchdown in three different Super Bowls (Terry Bradshaw threw a fourth-quarter touchdown in all four of his Super Bowls).

Warner&#x27;s top target was Fitzgerald, who caught seven passes for 127 yards and two touchdowns. Fitzgerald set a single-postseason record with seven touchdown receptions, passing Jerry Rice, who had six in the 1988 postseason. Fitzgerald as well as Holmes each had 100 yards receiving, marking the fourth time in Super Bowl history, one player from each team had over 100 yards in a Super Bowl. Michael Irvin and Andre Reed were the first in Super Bowl XXVII, followed by Deion Branch and Muhsin Muhammad in Super Bowl XXXVIII and Branch again a year later along with Terrell Owens in Super Bowl XXXIX.

Roethlisberger completed 21 of 30 passes for 256 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Woodley had two sacks and a forced fumble, thus he continued setting NFL play-off records for consecutive multiple sack games by a player with 4. Arizona defensive tackle Darnell Dockett had all of Arizona&#x27;s three sacks, tying the Super Bowl record set by Reggie White in Super Bowl XXXI. Harrison&#x27;s 100-yard interception return is still the longest interception return in Super Bowl history.

With this victory, the Steelers became the first team to win three Super Bowls in the same state. Their victories in Super Bowls X and XIII were both at the Miami Orange Bowl.

==Post-game riots==
In Pittsburgh, mostly in the South Side and Oakland neighborhoods, riots broke out on the streets after the Steelers&#x27; victory. Rioters (mostly college students) caused about $150,000 in estimated damages. More than 60 people were arrested during and after the rioting, and at least two students were suspended.

==Super Bowl ring==

The ring for the Pittsburgh Steelers was designed and made by Jostens working with Dan Rooney and Art Rooney II. The designs were also shown to James Farrior, Hines Ward, Ben Roethlisberger and James Harrison before a final decision was made.

<doc id="1263009" wikidata="Q642106" url="?curid=1263009" title="Tenaris">
<text>Tenaris S.A., organized in Luxembourg, is a manufacturer and supplier of steel pipes and related services for the petroleum industry. The company produces and ships over 4 million tons of pipes annually. In 2023, 53% of the company&#x27;s sales were to North America, 22% of sales were to South America, 18% of sales were to the Asia-Pacific, and 7% of sales were to Europe.

The company owns 11.46% of Ternium, 3.96% of the share capital of Usiminas, and 22% of Techgen.

The company is 60.45% owned by Techint, which is controlled by San Faustin S.A., which is in turn controlled by Rocca &amp; Partners Stichting Administratiekantoor Aandelen San Faustin, a Stichting, while 38.41% of the company is publicly-traded.

==History==
Tenaris traces its roots to the formation of Siderca, the sole Argentine producer of seamless steel pipe products by the predecessor of San Faustin in 1948. Tenaris was organized on December 17, 2001.

In June 2006, the company acquired Maverick Tube for $3.185 billion.

In September 2006, it sold 75% of Dalmine, its Italian energy supply business, to E.ON for €39 million.

In 2007, the company acquired Hydril for $2.16 billion. The pressure control business was sold to GE Oil and Gas in April 2008.

In January 2020, the company acquired IPSCO Tubulars from OAO TMK for $1.2 billion.

==Controversies==
===Bribery settlement===
In May 2011, Tenaris agreed to pay the United States Department of Justice US$8.9 million in the first ever deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, after Tenaris voluntarily disclosed details of bribes made to officials of an Uzbek state-controlled oil firm to obtain competitor&#x27;s bid information, which it used to submit revised bids in order to secure tenders.

===Violence at TenarisTamsa facility===
On several occasions, melees broke out at the TenarisTamsa facility in Veracruz, Mexico, over a dispute for union leadership between Pascual Lagunes Ochoa and José Carlos Guevara Malpica (&quot;El Profe&quot;), a convicted felon. These melees have resulted in injuries and deaths.

<doc id="1263010" wikidata="Q4817367" url="?curid=1263010" title="Leather Charm">
<text>Leather Charm was an American heavy metal band from Downey, California, noteworthy as a forerunner to Metallica. The group rehearsed new wave of British heavy metal covers and original material for a period of months in 1981.

==History==
Leather Charm was formed in June 1981 following the demise of Phantom Lord, a garage band featuring James Hetfield and guitarist Hugh Tanner. At the time, Hetfield was living with an older brother in Brea, California and attending Brea Olinda High School after the unforeseen death of his mother. In the new band, Hetfield and Tanner were joined by Hetfield&#x27;s childhood friend and roommate Ron McGovney, and later drummer Jim Mulligan. While Hetfield had played guitar in Phantom Lord, he acted solely as lead vocalist in Leather Charm. Tanner was replaced several months later by guitarist Troy James.

The group was influenced by the new wave of British heavy metal and practiced covers of songs by such bands of the period, including Diamond Head and Sweet Savage. They were also influenced by Iron Maiden and covered their songs &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Wrathchild&quot;.

When Mulligan left the group in late 1981, Leather Charm disbanded and Hetfield began working with drummer Lars Ulrich on a new band, Metallica. Early the next year, McGovney and guitarist Dave Mustaine completed Metallica&#x27;s first gigging lineup. The Leather Charm song &quot;Hit the Lights&quot; was integrated into the band&#x27;s set among the first original compositions in the band&#x27;s repertoire, and eventually became the opening track on their debut album, &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;.

<text>Yakubu was ruler of the Hausa city-state of Gobir (in what is now northern Nigeria) from 1795 to 1801. Succeeding Bawa, Yakubu waged a number of military campaigns. His reign is also noted for a deterioration of relations between the Hausa elite of Gobir and Fulani Islamic reformer Usman dan Fodio, who would soon oppose them in the Fulani War. Yakubu was killed in 1801 in an attempt to storm the Zamfara fortress of Kiyawa.

<doc id="1263028" wikidata="Q7538022" url="?curid=1263028" title="Skyscrapers in film">
<text>[[Skyscraper]]s are frequently featured in [[film]]s for their impressive appearance and potent symbolism. They convey an impression of power – an old movie and TV cliché starts with the outside view of a skyscraper with a voice-over conversation, continuing inside the luxurious office of a tycoon or crime boss.

Skyscrapers&#x27; tight security and isolation from the rest of the city makes them ideal for dramatic crisis and trap situations including hostage-taking, heists and fire. Skyscrapers and other large landmarks also feature prominently in disaster films, where they are destroyed as a show of the power of nature or invaders.

==Fictional skyscrapers==
This is a list of named fictional skyscrapers that have a noticeable role in films (including notable science-fiction and fantasy), sorted by chronological filming order. In some cases, an actual building stands for the fictional one; in others, they are created using elaborate miniature models.

=== New Tower of Babel (Metropolis) ===

*Chief among the gothic skyscrapers of Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). The cityscape of &quot;Metropolis&quot; was inspired from Lang&#x27;s trip to Manhattan and was, in turn, an inspiration for several dystopian science-fiction films including &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Dark City&quot;.

=== Seacoast National Bank Building (New York City) ===

*This 100-story, Empire State Building-inspired tower is the center of a power struggle in &quot;Skyscraper Souls&quot; (1932), as ruthless banker David Dwight attempts to gain full control of the skyscraper.

=== Wynand Building (New York City) ===

*The creation of the uncompromising, objectivist architect Howard Roark, it features in the film adaptation of Ayn Rand&#x27;s &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1949). The world&#x27;s tallest, it is the culmination of Roark&#x27;s ambition, &quot;the will of man made visible.&quot;

=== Glass Tower (and Peerless Building) (San Francisco) ===

*This 138-story office/residential tower, the new &quot;tallest building in the world&quot;, is the setting of &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974).
*In the film, the guests in the building&#x27;s Penthouse opening ceremony are trapped by a fire that breaks out due to faulty wiring. 
*The &quot;Peerless Building&quot; is a structure depicted in the film as being the tower&#x27;s closest, tallest neighbor. 
*The idea of the &quot;world&#x27;s tallest&quot; was featured in both novels on which the film was based, and was inspired, ironically, by New York&#x27;s World Trade Center which was completed the year before the movie&#x27;s release. 
*Filmed prior to the widespread use of Digital CGI, the Glass Tower was actually a series of half inch and inch scale models.
*The miniatures cost $1,110,000 and the tallest of these was 70 feet high and was guyed off in all four directions and filmed against a blue screen on the concrete floor of Sersen Lake at the Twentieth Century Fox Ranch in Malibu, California.
*Similarly, five floors of the building were built in full scale at the same facility for close up shooting of action scenes. The building&#x27;s name was a combination of &quot;The Glass House&quot; from &quot;The Glass Inferno&quot; and &quot;The World Tower&quot; from &quot;The Tower&quot;.

=== Tyrell Corporation Headquarters (Los Angeles) ===

*The immense truncated pyramid-shaped structure, flanked by inwardly-slanted towers, dominates the cityscape of Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982). 
*The futuristic city has been described as a place where the height of the World Trade Center had become the norm, filled with buildings hundreds of stories tall, with Tyrell&#x27;s pyramid being six or seven times the height of the WTC and at least a hundred times more massive . 
*Main protagonist Deckard himself lives on the 97th floor of a generic building.

=== Nakatomi Plaza (Los Angeles) ===

*A 31-floor building taken over by terrorists in the classic action film &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988). 
*The building is actually the 34-story Fox Plaza, 20th Century Fox&#x27;s Los Angeles headquarters. 
*Most of the interior shots (excluding the lobby and roof) were shot on the Fox lot, located nearby.
*The Japanese name of this and other fictional buildings (such as Nakamoto Tower in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Rising Sun&quot;) provides an interesting window on the 1980s mindset that Japanese corporations would take over the world&#x27;s economy and real estate, especially after the real-life acquisition of Rockefeller Center by a Mitsubishi subsidiary (completed in 1989). 
*In fact, there have been relatively few such takeovers, and few if any U.S. skyscrapers were ever actually named after Japanese corporations.

=== Art Land&#x27;s Galaxy Hotel (Las Vegas) ===

*A fictional futuristic hotel/casino in Las Vegas, Nevada from the 1996 film &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; 
*The hotel was destroyed by a UFO during a martian invasion. 
*In reality the building was the Landmark Hotel and Casino which was imploded in 1995.

=== Galactic Senate Building 500 Republica (Coruscant) ===

*One of the innumerable towers covering the fictional city-planet of Coruscant from the Star Wars universe, first seen on film in the Special Edition of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1997), then in the Star Wars prequels. 
*On Coruscant, buildings are used as the foundations for new buildings that actually pierce the cloud layer. 
*The fifty lower levels form a dangerous underworld where ordinary citizens never go. 
*The city-planet was inspired by Trantor in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; saga.

=== Scolex Industries ===

*The corporate headquarters of the main villain Sanford Scolex (Doctor Claw) in the 1999 film &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;. In reality, the building is the PPG Place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

=== MNU Building (Johannesburg) ===

*A building used in the 2009 film &quot;District 9&quot;.

=== Fiddler&#x27;s Green ===

*In &quot;Land of the Dead&quot;, is by far the most notable landmark in the &quot;City of the Living&quot; and serves as a metaphor for the disconnection between wealthy and poor classes in society.

=== Clamp Centre ===

*The setting of &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot;. Exterior shots of the building are actually 101 Park Avenue in New York City.

=== The Zitex Building ===

*The titular tower of the 1996 film &quot;Skyscraper&quot;.

=== Stark Tower ===

*In &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Prior to the events of the film, Tony Stark purchased the Metlife Building and deconstructed the upper two-thirds of the skyscraper. 
*By the events of the film, construction of a new structure (built on top of the bottom third of the building) is nearly complete.
*During the Battle of New York, the building sustains minor damage. 
*The skyscraper is subsequently repurposed as Avengers Tower, and appears in &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;.

=== OCP Tower ===

*In &quot;RoboCop&quot;. The building was portrayed by the Dallas City Hall with the building&#x27;s upper floors added in via special effects as the actual city hall building is only 7 stories tall.

=== Tower Sky ===

*A fictional 448m, 108-story high twin tower complex in Seoul, South Korea, in the 2012 disaster film &quot;The Tower&quot;. 
*As stated in the film, Tower A was called &quot;Riverview&quot;, and Tower B was called &quot;Cityview&quot;. 
*With over 5700 residents, it was South Korea&#x27;s biggest residential complex. 
*In the film, the owner of the complex decided to hold a Christmas party and had 10 helicopters circling above the building, despite the warnings of the owner&#x27;s employees. 
*On Christmas Eve, one of the helicopters crashed into Tower A. The crash also damaged the structure of the bridge connecting the twin tower, making the characters unable to escape to Tower B.

=== Millennium Building ===
*A fictional 102-story building in New York City in 2001 horror film Down.
*As stated in film, the tower has 102-story and 73 elevators, so it basically a parodied version of Empire State Building.

=== The Pearl (Hong Kong) ===

*A 3,500 feet tall skyscraper from the 2018 movie &quot;Skyscraper.&quot;

=== Beika City Building ===

*From the 1997 Japanese animated movie &quot;Detective Conan: The Time Bombed Skyscraper or Case Closed: The Time Bombed Skyscraper.&quot;

<doc id="1263037" wikidata="Q515376" url="?curid=1263037" title="Renal artery stenosis">
<text>Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is the narrowing of one or both of the renal arteries, most often caused by atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. This narrowing of the renal artery can impede blood flow to the target kidney, resulting in renovascular hypertension – a secondary type of high blood pressure. Possible complications of renal artery stenosis are chronic kidney disease and coronary artery disease.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most cases of renal artery stenosis are asymptomatic, and the main problem is high blood pressure that cannot be controlled with medication. Decreased kidney function may develop if both kidneys do not receive adequate blood flow, furthermore some people with renal artery stenosis present with episodes of flash pulmonary edema.

==Cause==
Renal artery stenosis is most often caused by atherosclerosis which causes the renal arteries to harden and narrow due to the build-up of plaque. This is known as atherosclerotic renovascular disease, which accounts for about 90% of cases. This narrowing of renal arteries due to plaque build-up leads to higher blood pressure within the artery and decreased blood flow to the kidney. This decreased blood flow leads to decreased blood pressure in the kidney, which leads to the activation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone (RAA) system. Juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin, which converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II then acts on the adrenal cortex to increase secretion of the hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone causes sodium and water retention, leading to an increase in blood volume and blood pressure. Therefore, people with RAS have chronic high blood pressure because their RAA system is hyperactivated.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of renal artery stenosis leads to changes in the structure of the kidney that are most noticeable in the tubular tissue.

Changes include:
* Fibrosis
* Tubular cell size (decrease)
* Thickening of Bowman capsule
* Tubulosclerosis
* Glomerular capillary tuft (atrophy)

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of renal artery stenosis can use many techniques to determine if the condition is present, a clinical prediction rule is available to guide diagnosis.

Among the diagnostic techniques are:
* Doppler ultrasound study of the kidneys
* Refractory hypertension
* Auscultation (with stethoscope) - bruit (&quot;rushing&quot; sound)
* Captopril challenge test
* Captopril test dose effect on the differential renal function as measured by MAG3 scan.
* Renal artery arteriogram.

The specific criteria for renal artery stenosis on Doppler are an acceleration time of greater than 70 milliseconds, an acceleration index of less than 300 cm/sec² and a velocity ratio of the renal artery to aorta of greater than 3.5.

==Treatment==
===Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis===
It is initially treated with medications, including diuretics, and medications for blood pressure control. When high-grade renal artery stenosis is documented and blood pressure cannot be controlled with medication, or if renal function deteriorates, surgery may be resorted to. The most commonly used procedure is a minimally-invasive angioplasty with or without stenting. It is unclear if this approach yields better results than the use of medications alone. It is a relatively safe procedure. If all else fails and the kidney is thought to be worsening hypertension and revascularization with angioplasty or surgery does not work, then surgical removal of the affected kidney (nephrectomy) may significantly improve high blood pressure.

=== Stenting v.s. Medical Treatment ===
Historically, balloon dilation of vascular lesions was first performed in 1964. The first treatment of renovascular lesions by percutaneous catheter angioplasty (PTA) was performed in 1978 by Andreas Roland Grüntzig. Stenting became the standard of endovascular care for ostial stenoses because of the poor technical success of PTA. The use of renal artery stents, particularly for ostial lesions, has further improved long-term patency rates. Further research into the efficacy of renal artery stenting has since been conducted, including the ASTRAL and CORAL trials, and research is ongoing as to whether there is clear benefit to stenting over more conservative management such as by medications alone.

The ASTRAL trial randomized 806 patients to renal artery revascularization via stenting versus medical therapy, with the following results:
* No survival advantage in the stented group
* No benefit for renal function in the stented group
* Serious complications with stenting (2 deaths, 3 amputations, others)

The CORAL study randomized 947 patients to stenting versus medical therapy, with a primary endpoint of major cardiovascular or renal events. Similarly, this study also found there was no benefit to stenting over medical treatment alone.

Collectively, the evidence so far does not support renal artery stenting as a proper mainstay treatment for stenosis because it conveys no survival benefit, no true renoprotection, and does not decrease the need for antihypertensive medications. A debate remains about whether or not it is beneficial to stent for purely ostial lesions, and comparing the success in treating with angioplasty (such as ballon dilatation) versus stenting. Smoking cessation and thoughtful blood pressure control, via lifestyle/dietary changes and medication, are the current mainstays of managing renovascular hypertension.

===Fibromuscular dysplasia===
Angioplasty alone is preferred in fibromuscular dysplasia, with stenting reserved for unsuccessful angioplasty or complications such as dissection.

<text>José Calvo Sotelo, 1st Duke of Calvo Sotelo, GE (6 May 1893 – 13 July 1936) was a Spanish jurist and politician. He was the minister of finance during the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera and a leading figure during the Spanish Second Republic. During this period, he became an important part of Spanish Renovation, a monarchist movement. Calvo Sotelo&#x27;s assassination in July 1936 by the bodyguard of PSOE party leader Indalecio Prieto was an immediate prelude to the triggering of the Spanish military coup of July 1936 that was plotted since February 1936, the partial failure of which marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.

==Biography==
=== Early years ===

Calvo Sotelo was born on 6 May 1893 in Tui, Galicia to Pedro Calvo y Camina, a judge, and Elisa Sotelo Lafuente. He received a degree in Law and moved to the capital, Madrid. In 1913 he joined a maurist circle in the Ateneo where he socialised with other members of the Maurist Youth such as Melchor Fernández Almagro, Pío Zabala, Antonio Ballesteros Beretta, Pío Ballesteros Álava, Quintiliano Saldaña, Manuel Palacios Olmedo, Rogerio Sánchez and Fernando Suárez de Tangil. He became Secretary of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of the &quot;Ateneo Mercantil de Madrid&quot; and a professor at the Universidad Central. He was a member of Antonio Maura&#x27;s Conservative Party. In his first post he was an administrative officer in the Ministry of Grace and Justice.

In the 1919 election to the Congress of Deputies, despite Maura having in mind the plan of not putting forward a Maurista in the district of Carballino in exchange for a seat in another district, the 25 year-old Calvo Sotelo put himself forward as a candidate. Challenging mainstream conservative candidate Leopoldo García Durán, a follower of Gabino Bugallal (Count of Bugallal), Calvo Sotelo won the seat in the election. In 1922, he was made Civil Governor of Valencia.

=== Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera ===
Following the 1923 coup d&#x27;état by Miguel Primo de Rivera, Calvo Sotelo lent support to the dictatorship. Appointed Director General of Local Administration in 1923, he was the creator of the 1924 Municipal Statute that, inspired by previous projects of Antonio Maura, sought to reform the structure of the State at a local level and was cemented by the free election of mayors and the councillors. He also promulgated a Provincial Statute in 1925. Neither statute got to be enforced. Primo de Rivera then appointed Calvo Sotelo as finance minister of the Civil Directory of the dictatorship in 1925, and he served from December 1925 until January 1930. During his tenure as Minister of Finance, his programme to achieve economic growth featured protectionist, nationalist and interventionist policies.

=== Second Republic ===

After the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic on 14 April 1931, Calvo Sotelo, because of his prior collaboration with the dictatorship and his fear of being subject to trial, went into exile to Portugal and later France along with other politicians. He was welcomed the day after his arrival in Lisbon by António de Oliveira Salazar, then minister of Finance. Calvo Sotelo spent his time in Portugal studying the &quot;Ditadura Nacional&quot; regime. After being given a passport by the Portuguese authorities, he lived between February 1932 and May 1934 in Paris, where he became connected with the ideas of Charles Maurras. He also befriended Léon Daudet, Jacques Bainville and Charles Benoist in France. Despite his exile he had been elected as member of the parliament for the district of Ourense both in the 1931 and 1933 elections.

After the passing of an amnesty law on 20 April 1934, he returned to Spain with the intention of leaving an imprint on the Alfonsine right, then represented by Renovación Española and led by Antonio Goicoechea. After his return, he had also tried to join the Fascist Falange Española de las JONS, but, albeit endorsed by Ruiz de Alda and Ledesma, his application was vetoed by José Antonio Primo de Rivera, who understood his leadership was being challenged and deemed the Galician politician as &quot;reactionary&quot;. By the 9 May Calvo Sotelo was in the Cortes.

He stated that the &quot;Restoration&quot; of the prior liberal monarchy was not intended, but the &quot;instauration&quot; of an anti-liberal one. Sotelo had more personal charisma than Goicoechea and eventually eclipsed him. He became the leading figure of the Bloque Nacional (&#x27;National Block&#x27;), a newly created electoral project that sought to unite the anti-republican right. The foundational manifesto espoused a return to traditional values, through the means of an authoritarian monarchy and the role of the Armed Forces as counter-revolutionary agent. Neither the leader of the CEDA (José María Gil-Robles) nor the leader of the Falange Española de las JONS (José Antonio Primo de Rivera) endorsed the initiative, which, aside from members of Renovación Española, drew most of its support from the ranks of the traditionalist Carlists. It was also supported by the small group headed by the Doctor Albiñana, leader of the Spanish Nationalist Party.

After the victory of the leftist Popular Front in the February 1936 election, José Calvo Sotelo became the leading speaker of the anti-republican forces in the Parliament, preparing the mood of anti-republican supporters for a coup d&#x27;état. Sotelo was aware that there was a planned rebellion within the army and while he would welcome such a development, believing only an authoritarian regime would solve Spain&#x27;s problems, he was not part of the conspiracy and was not sure when the planned rebellion would happen or if it even would, thus he continued his normal political and personal life.

==Assassination==

After the Guardia de Asalto leader José Castillo was killed by falangists at 10pm on 12 July 1936, a group of Guardia de Asalto and other leftist militiamen led by Civil Guard Fernando Condés went to Calvo Sotelo&#x27;s house in a government&#x27;s car in the early hours of 13 July on a revenge mission. While they also planned to kidnap Gil-Robles as well, he was not in Madrid at the time. Sotelo was arrested and later shot dead in a police truck. His body was dumped at the entrance of one of the city&#x27;s cemeteries. According to all later investigations, the perpetrator of the murder was a socialist gunman, Luis Cuenca, who was known as the bodyguard of PSOE leader Indalecio Prieto. Both Condés and Cuenca later died in the first few days of the civil war.

=== Trial ===
Though the government denounced the murder and promised to investigate, it made no effort at conciliation. Censorship was immediately imposed to conceal the truth, nothing was done to apprehend those directly responsible and instead numerous Falangists and rightists were arrested (this was not unusual behavior when members of the political right were murdered by Popular Front members). A judge, Ursicino Gómez Carbajo, did take up the case independently within hours but the case was abruptly taken off his hands by the Guardia de Asalto , seemingly because he was an independent and honest judge. The first political response was from the Communist Party, who decided the assassination represented a time to forward one of their legislative drafts to other Popular Front groups, which essentially called for the banning of numerous right-wing parties, including CEDA, Renovación Española and Falange, the confiscation of their property and the confiscation of several newspapers. Although its presentation before parliament was impossible due parliament&#x27;s postponement, its provisions were carried out during the civil war in the Republican zone and the Popular Front government seemed to act in its spirit, announcing the decision to close down the centers of both Renovación Española and the CNT in Madrid, despite neither of these groups having anything to do with the killing.

=== Funeral ===
Sotelo was buried in a public funeral attended by thousands of rightists, many of whom gave the fascist salute, which infuriated the police. Several hundred rightists then marched to the city center in a political demonstration. They were stopped by a police barricade and had to show they were unarmed before they were allowed to pass. As the unarmed protesters approached the center, they were fired upon by the Guardia de Asalto and police units, with a few protesters being killed. Three members of Guardia de Asalto who protested this were temporarily arrested, while some police from Castillo&#x27;s barracks felt their unit&#x27;s honor had been stained by the assassination and demanded an investigation. Two Guardia de Asalto units were seemingly on the verge of mutiny. The final session of the Cortes before the war on 15 July was dominated by the assassination. Monarchists and rightists accused the government of creating the atmosphere in which Sotelo&#x27;s killing was made possible. Gil-Robles presented a list of deaths and disorders of the past month. He said that every day he read calls in leftist newspapers for the right to be subject to &quot;extermination&quot; and warned that &quot;the day will come when the violence you have unleashed will be turned against you.&quot;

=== Aftermath ===

Brian Crozier explains the significance of the killing:
It is hard perhaps to convey the enormity of this deed, for it is almost impossible to transport it to other countries and different circumstances. Sir Alec Douglas-Home kidnapped and murdered by Special Branch detectives? Senator Robert F. Kennedy kidnapped and murdered by the F.B.I.? Unthinkable, one might say. And that is the point: in Spain in the summer of 1936, the unthinkable had become normal.

Anti-republican conspirators led by General Emilio Mola seized the moment, accelerating the military coup that had been plotted since the February election. According to Antony Beevor, Sotelo&#x27;s assassination inadvertently caused many more people to support the coup than would otherwise have occurred. In 1960, Franco stated that the revolt would never have developed the strength necessary if not for the assassination. The uprising of part of the Army, starting with the Army of Africa in Melilla on 17 July 1936, under the assumed command of Generals Emilio Mola, Francisco Franco, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano and José Sanjurjo, marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.

<text>The Atlantis oil field is the third largest oil field in the Gulf of Mexico. The field was discovered in 1998 and is located at the Green Canyon blocks 699, 700, 742, 743, and 744 in United States federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico about from the coast of Louisiana. The oil field lies in water depths ranging from . The subsea structure of Atlantis has long been the target of safety critics.

==Reserves==
The Atlantis oil field has estimated ultimate reserves of about . The supermajor BP owns a 56% interest in the field in conjunction with BHP Billiton Petroleum Deepwater which owns a 44% interest.

==History==
The oil field was discovered in 1998 by the &quot;Ocean America&quot; semi-submersible, mobile drilling rig operating in a water depth of . The discovery was later confirmed by wells drilled by &quot;GSF C.R. Luigs&quot; and &quot;Glomar Explorer&quot;. Production started in October 2007.

==Production==
The field is expected to produce about of oil and of gas.

The Atlantis field has been developed with a semi-submersible production platform, &quot;Atlantis PQ&quot;, designed by GVA Consultants and built by Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering in South Korea. In addition to the semi-submersible platform, field development uses a network of wet-tree subsea wells.

The subsea elements of the Atlantis field were designed and fabricated by PS Fabricators. It is one of the largest to undergo systems integration testing (SIT) on land, also at PS Fabricators SIT site. This includes positioning the components as they would be positioned subsea, pressure testing, pig testing, etc. The system itself is rigorously tested to ensure its safety subsea.

==Safety practices==

===Food and Water Watch lawsuit===
On 17 May 2010, consumer group Food &amp; Water Watch, with former BP contractor Kenneth Abbott, filed a complaint in the United States district court, seeking to stop production on the platform &quot;Atlantis PQ&quot; until safety documents are produced. The suit was dropped by the plaintiff and re-file naming BP as a defendant, as required once BP became involved.

According to Food &amp; Water Watch, BP failed to supplement its document production with new information regarding Atlantis&#x27;s suspension the second quarter of 2012, which caused much of the company&#x27;s $3.7 billion loss in profits that quarter.

===US government scrutiny===
The &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; drilling rig explosion has given new impetus to a number of Congressional Representatives to pressure the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to investigate safety practices on BP&#x27;s &quot;Atlantis PQ&quot; offshore platform in the Atlantis Oil Field. A whistleblower report to the MMS in March 2009 stated, &quot;over 85 percent of the Atlantis Project&#x27;s Piping and Instrument drawings lacked final engineer-approval,&quot; as legally required. The report further stated, &quot;the project be immediately shut down until those documents could be accounted for and independently verified.&quot; BP and other oil industry groups wrote letters objecting to a proposed MMS rule last year that would have required stricter safety measures. The MMS changed rules in April 2008 to exempt certain projects in the central Gulf region, allowing BP to operate in the Macondo Prospect without filing a blowout plan.

<doc id="1263046" wikidata="Q5134395" url="?curid=1263046" title="Clipping path">
<text>A clipping path (or &quot;deep etch&quot;) is a closed vector path, or shape, used to cut out a 2D image in image editing software. Anything inside the path will be included after the clipping path is applied; anything outside the path will be omitted from the output. Applying the clipping path results in a hard (aliased) or soft (anti-aliased) edge, depending on the image editor&#x27;s capabilities

By convention, the inside of the path is defined by its direction. Reversing the direction of a path reverses what is considered inside or outside. An &quot;inclusive path&quot; is one where what is visually &quot;inside&quot; the path corresponds to what will be preserved; an &quot;exclusive path&quot;, of opposite direction, contains what is visually &quot;outside&quot; the path. By convention, a clockwise path that is non-self-intersecting is considered inclusive.

A compound path results from the combination of multiple paths (inclusive and exclusive) and the Boolean operations that ultimately determine what the combined path contains. For instance, an inclusive path which contains a smaller exclusive path results in a shape with a &quot;hole&quot; (defined by the exclusive path).

One common use of a clipping path is to cull objects that do not need to be rendered because they are outside the user&#x27;s viewport or obscured by display elements (such as a HUD).

==In 3D graphics==

Clipping planes are used in 3D computer graphics in order to prevent the renderer from calculating surfaces at an extreme distance from the viewer. The plane is perpendicular to the camera, a set distance away (the &quot;threshold&quot;), and occupies the entire viewport. Used in real-time rendering, clipping planes can help preserve processing for objects within clear sight.

The use of clipping planes can result in a detraction from the realism of a scene, as the viewer may notice that everything at the threshold is not rendered correctly or seems to (dis)appear spontaneously. The addition of &quot;fog&quot;—a variably transparent region of color or texture just before the clipping plane—can help soften the transition between what should be in plain sight and opaque, and what should be beyond notice and fully transparent, and therefore does not need to be rendered.

==Clipping path service==
Clipping path services are professional offerings provided by companies for extracting objects or people from still imagery, and typically includes other photo editing and manipulation services. Addressees of such services are primarily photography and graphic design studios, advertising agencies, web designers, as well as lithographers and printing companies. Clipping path service companies commonly reside in developing countries such as Bangladesh, Philippine, India, Pakistan and Nepal, which can provide their services at comparatively low cost to developed countries, fostering outsourcing of such activities.

<doc id="1263050" wikidata="Q4647287" url="?curid=1263050" title="A.R. Kane">
<text>A.R. Kane (sometimes AR Kane or A.R.Kane) is a British musical duo formed in 1986 by Alex Ayuli and Rudy Tambala. After releasing two early EPs to critical acclaim, the group topped the UK Independent Chart with their debut album &quot;69&quot; (1988). Their second album, &quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot; (1989), was also a top 10 hit. They were also part of the one-off collaboration MARRS, whose surprise dance hit &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; was released in 1987. Ayuli is believed to have coined the term &quot;dreampop&quot; in the late 1980s to describe their eclectic sound, which blended elements such as effects-laden guitars, dub production, and drum machine backing.

The group broke up in 1994. Though their work fell into relative obscurity in subsequent years, they have been characterised by critics as among the most innovative and underrated groups of their era, and recognized as an influence on styles such as shoegaze, trip hop, and post-rock. In 2012, One Little Indian released &quot;Complete Singles Collection&quot;, which compiled the group&#x27;s single and EP releases.

Tambala briefly reformed A.R. Kane from 2016 to 2018 with Maggie Tambala and guitarist Andy Taylor but without Ayuli. This reformation was later spun-off as its own band, Jübl, which has since released two singles and a studio album.

==History==
===Origins===
Ayuli and Tambala first met as school children in an East London primary school. Ayuli is of Nigerian descent, while Tambala was born to a Malawian father and English mother. Both were involved in formative and culturally diverse music communities as adolescents, with Ayuli part of a dub soundsystem and Tambala part of a jazz-funk scene. In 1983, Ayuli became an advertising copywriter, one of few black creatives working in the London ad business. The two were both inspired by a mid-1980s Channel 4 performance by Cocteau Twins; Tambala explained: &quot;They had no drummer. They used tapes and technology and Liz Fraser looked completely otherworldly with those big eyes. And the noise coming out of Robin [Guthrie]&#x27;s guitar! That was the &#x27;Fuck! We could do that! We could express ourselves like that!&#x27; moment.&quot;

Attending a party in 1986, Tambala was asked how he and Ayuli knew each other; he lied that the two played together in a band, going on to describe their sound as &quot;a bit Velvet Underground, a bit Cocteau Twins, a bit Miles Davis, a bit Joni Mitchell&quot;. A week later, the two were contacted by a label on the strength of Tambala&#x27;s fabrication. The duo recorded their demo without a drummer, using a guitar and two cassette players.

===1986–1994: Recordings===
In 1986, A.R. Kane released their debut single &quot;When You&#x27;re Sad&quot; on One Little Indian. The duo were initially grouped with other &quot;noise pop&quot; acts, and were hailed in the press as &quot;the black Jesus and Mary Chain&quot;, despite claiming to have never heard the work of that band. The next year the group signed to 4AD to release the follow-up 1987 EP &quot;Lollita&quot;, which was produced by Robin Guthrie of Cocteau Twins and saw the duo melding dub production, guitar feedback, free jazz and studio experimentation. While at 4AD, label chief Ivo Watts-Russell suggested that Ayuli and Tambala team with roster mates Colourbox, champion mixer Chris &quot;C.J.&quot; Mackintosh, and London DJ Dave Dorrell to record a one-off single. Dubbing the collaboration M/A/R/R/S, the resulting single, &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; was a breakthrough effort heralding sampling&#x27;s gradual absorption from hip-hop into dance music and ultimately the pop mainstream, reaching number 1 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1987.

A.R. Kane followed with their highly anticipated debut album, &quot;69&quot; (1988), which topped the independent charts and received rave critical reviews from the UK music press. Writing for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, critic Simon Reynolds described &quot;69&quot; as &quot;&quot;the&quot; outstanding record of &#x27;88.&quot; A.R Kane&#x27;s next release was 1989&#x27;s &quot;Love-Sick&quot; EP, followed later that year by their second studio album, &quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;, in which they engaged more overtly with pop, dance and electronic styles. The duo, dismissive of the wildly disparate attempts by journalists to categorize their unique sound, eventually began referring to their music as &quot;dreampop&quot;; the term was widely adopted by music critics thereafter. Like its predecessor, &quot;i&quot; was released to moderate sales figures and topped the independent charts. Also in 1989, Rough Trade released the &quot;Pop&quot; EP.

In the early 1990s, the band went on hiatus. During this time, Ayuli and Tambala founded the label H.ark and released EPs by acts such as Papa Sprain and Butterfly Child. Rough Trade went bankrupt in 1991. In 1992, US label Luaka Bop released a 15-song US retrospective of the band&#x27;s work, titled &quot;Americana&quot;. Greg Kot of &quot;The Chicago Times&quot; described the compilation as &quot;a chronicle of sonic innovation in which the boundary between melody and noise, pop and the avant-garde, is blurred continually.&quot; The duo ended their hiatus thereafter to record a follow-up album, &quot;New Clear Child&quot; (1994), and then dissolved following its release.

===1994–2014: Post-breakup===
Following the dissolution of A.R. Kane, Tambala made ambient- and dub-based music with his sister Maggie under the alias Sufi and released the 1995 album &quot;Life&#x27;s Rising&quot; on Caroline Records. Tambala serves as head of new media for Ministry of Sound, and previously worked for Virgin Digital in non-musical roles. He has also recorded as MusicOne.

Ayuli was known to be a museum curator in the US. He put out releases under the name Alex!. In 2006, Ayuli contributed vocals to two tracks (&quot;Soulsong&quot; and &quot;Passage&quot;) on the album &quot;Primario&quot; by the Static Discos artist Fax, and also appeared on Fax&#x27;s album &quot;Zig Zag&quot;. Ayuli appeared in &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot;, a documentary on the shoegazing music scene of the 1990s

A.R. Kane&#x27;s first two albums were reissued in the US by One Little Indian in 2004, and &quot;New Clear Child&quot; was reissued by 3rd Stone in 2000. &quot;Complete Singles Collection&quot;, a compilation of the group&#x27;s EPs and singles, was released in 2012.

===2015-present: Reformation and spinoff as Jübl===
In 2015, it was announced by Tambala that a quasi-reformation of A.R. Kane, bringing together new and old collaborators, would be taking place that year under the name #A.R.Kane and without the involvement of Ayuli.

In 2018, the revived band (featuring Rudi and Maggie Tambala plus guitarist Andy Taylor) renamed itself Jübl as part of a &quot;forward-thinking rebrand&quot;. Rudi commented &quot;I wanted to do something for the 30th anniversary (of &quot;69&quot;), to give back to people some of the feeling they have shared with us, and to mark the moment. We discussed remasters, t-shirts, box-sets, re-recording some of the tracks, concerts, re-mixing the entire LP, and so on, but there were ownership and rights issues that became impenetrable barriers, so I just kinda gave up. Then one morning in May I just thought &quot;Fuck it, it&#x27;s a month away, just get the fuck out of bed and do something.&quot; Over coffee I realised that we could only move forward and be free from the nonsense by renaming the band, hence &quot;Jübl&quot;. From that moment on everything just clicked into place. The three of us have been performing as A.R. Kane since 2016, and writing new songs too, so the material was there, we just had to make that final push.&quot;

Following the name change, Jübl issued two singles - &quot;Thinking Sweet&quot; (in June 2018) and &quot;Quiet Sun Slips Over&quot; (in June 2019), both of which would later appear on their first album under the new name, &quot;DNA Cowboys&quot;, released independently on 1 September 2019.

In 2023 A.R. Kane released a limited-edition vinyl boxset &quot;A.R. Kive&quot; containing remastered versions of the &quot;69&quot; and &quot;i&quot; LPs and the &quot;Up Home!&quot; EP (all originally released by Rough Trade from 1988–89) plus new remixes by artists including Slowdive. Coinciding with this release, Tambala played two live dates as A.R. Kane at The Social and Cafe Oto in London. The lineup for these shows included Maggie Tambala and Budgie on clarinet, credited by Tambala as the player on &#x27;The Sun Falls Into The Sea&#x27;.

==Legacy and influence==
Critic Jason Ankeny described A.R. Kane as &quot;arguably the most criminally under-recognized band of their era&quot; and an important progenitor of such musical developments as shoegazing, trip hop, ambient dub and post-rock. &quot;The Guardian&quot; has called their work &quot;some of the 80s&#x27; most extraordinary music&quot; and noted their influence on subsequent artists such as My Bloody Valentine. The group have been recognized for breaking stereotypes about the styles accessible to black musicians at a time when most popular black artists were relegated to soul, reggae and hip hop. Critic Simon Reynolds tentatively referred to A.R. Kane as &quot;the great lost group of the 80s,&quot; while pointing out that the group in fact enjoyed fervent support in certain circles of the press and surrounding music scenes during the period. Reynolds later wrote that &quot;A.R. Kane weren&#x27;t a rock band in the conventional sense [...they] were more like an experimental guitar pop unit who loved to push the recording studio to its limits.&quot; Their work was characterized by &quot;frieze&quot; as &quot;dreamy experimental pop.&quot; Pitchfork wrote that, &quot;embracing dub, soul and paisley pop, A.R. Kane pushed boundaries most of their contemporaries completely ignored.&quot;

Bands such as Seefeel, Slowdive, Long Fin Killie, Dubstar, and the Veldt/Apollo Heights have cited A.R. Kane as an influence.

<text>Just Be Free is a demo album released by Warlock Records featuring music recorded by American singer Christina Aguilera. After finishing her run on &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, a then fifteen-year-old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey–based producers Robert Allecca and Michael Brown. The pair gave Aguilera the opportunity to use a recording studio and presented her with demo music.

Musically, the album consists of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing Spanish-language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera&#x27;s vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were not very well received among critics. Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success, Brown and Allecca released the record. &quot;Just Be Free&quot; has sold over 129,000 copies in the United States.

==Background==
After news that &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; would be filming its final season, Aguilera sought out a record deal. She spent time in Philadelphia to record demo tracks with various producers, hoping to have an album released by the time she had finished high school. While taping the final season of the show, she began working with New Jersey–based producers Roberts Allecca and Michael Brown. The pair eventually built a relationship with Aguilera and her family, offering her studio time. According to biographer Pier Dominguez, they told her that the demo recordings they would produce would be their property, but also that they would never commercially release the material. She recorded eleven &quot;rough and unfinished&quot; tracks which then went on to become the &quot;Just Be Free&quot; studio sessions.

===Musical style===

The tapes were conceived as a way of introducing Aguilera to the music industry, described as a &quot;foot in the door&quot; attempt to build interest in her musical abilities. During the recording sessions, Aguilera experimented with different languages, recording songs such as the title track &quot;Just Be Free&quot; in Spanish. Musically, the album generally consists of dance tracks and ballads, the latter of which were created in an effort to showcase Aguilera&#x27;s vocal talents. Nearly all of the songs on the album were co-written by Aguilera with Bob Allecca and Michael Brown. Pier Dominguez, author of &quot;A Star Is Made&quot; said: &quot;Christina&#x27;s songwriting proved to be an early sign of the intense artistic involvement that the singer would have in every single endeavor she decided to embark on during her career. She was already showing, at fourteen, that she was first and foremost a talented musician and artist.&quot;

==Lawsuit and release==
After discovering that Allecca and Brown would be releasing the album, Aguilera began developments to sue the pair in an effort to stop the release. Aguilera filed a suit against Warlock Records and the affiliates Platinum Recordings and JFB Music for &quot;improper use of her name and license on the upcoming album Just Be Free&quot;. Carla Christofferson, her lawyer at the time, explained that &quot;We&#x27;re trying to stop them from releasing these early recordings which is not the quality she is associated with right now.&quot; However, Warlock Records president Adam Levy felt that despite Aguilera disliking the material, he found it to be a look into her life at the time of recording. He stated &quot;It&#x27;s a great look at what she was doing, We&#x27;re pleased [to be putting the record out]. I&#x27;m more pleased for the album&#x27;s producers who wanted to get it out. I hope the fans can appreciate it.&quot; Christofferson responded by alleging that Warlock Records tried to &quot;boot strap&quot; on Aguilera&#x27;s success. In response to the lawsuit, Warlock Records filed their own lawsuit in an attempt to ensure the release of the record. During the proceedings, Aguilera agreed to let Warlock Records release &quot;Just Be Free&quot; after reaching a settlement with the company and its affiliates. She allowed the release under the condition that the label would have to include a letter written by Aguilera in each album released.

Levy said of the settlement: &quot;Christina knows that these guys did work on this record and it was recorded and they do have rights to it - and we were sensitive to the fact that she should be able to control her name and likeness,&quot; while Christofferson said: They were going to put it out one way or another and this way Christina got to make a statement on the album, and she&#x27;s happy about that.&quot; Aguilera chose the photograph that was used on the album&#x27;s cover, which depicts her at the age the album was recorded. 

&quot;Just Be Free&quot; debuted and peaked at number 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has sold over 129,000 copies in the United States. The album has since been made available on streaming services.

==Critical reception==

The album received generally negative reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic understood why Aguilera was dissatisfied with the release of the material, calling the songs &quot;pre-professional&quot; and &quot;generic early-&#x27;90s dance-pop&quot;. He noted that &quot;Just Be Free&quot; did not match the quality of her self-titled debut album due to its &quot;bland&quot; production. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a D-rating, citing the album&#x27;s production and describing the content as &quot;teen-jailbait&quot; due to lyrics such as &quot;Why don&#x27;t you stay with me tonight&quot;.

Pier Dominguez, author of &quot;A Star Is Made&quot;, commented that the sessions demonstrated &quot;Christina&#x27;s raw vocal agility&quot; despite calling the content &quot;dull&quot;, adding &quot;Christina&#x27;s hunger for success actually comes through in these songs, as she sings her heart out with strained emotion, trying to sound as if she&#x27;s letting all her inhibitions run free. If she did in fact co-write the songs then they were also a demonstration of Christina&#x27;s songwriting dexterity, because the album&#x27;s lyrics could be called unoriginal and perhaps even cheesy, it could not be said that they were not catchy&quot;. Similarly, Stephanie McGrath from JAM! Music also saw why Aguilera would not want the album released. Although she recognized Aguilera&#x27;s potential as a vocalist, she wrote &quot;The songs themselves are terrible, dated club tracks, overwhelmed by poor effects and mundane beats.&quot; In a more positive review, Jane Stevenson from the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; said: &quot;The combination of dance songs – actually a lot more fun than they have any right to be – and overwrought balladry is hardly a far cry from the music she&#x27;s putting out today, albeit a lot less polished.&quot;

<doc id="1263058" wikidata="Q216843" url="?curid=1263058" title="Oggy and the Cockroaches">
<text>Oggy and the Cockroaches () is a French animated television series created by Jean-Yves Raimbaud and produced by Gaumont Multimedia for seasons 1–2 and Xilam Animation for seasons 3–7. The series chronicles the exploits and adventures of Oggy, a blue cat whose life is constantly interrupted by three cockroaches – Dee Dee, Marky, and Joey respectively – who love to cause mischief within his home. The show employs silent comedy: characters either do not speak or use unintelligible vocalizations and gestures. The show premiered in September 1998 on France 3, and later expanded internationally. The series ended in January 2019, having released seven seasons in over two decades.
The cartoon also relies on slapstick humour much like its inspiration and spiritual predecessor &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. only amplifying the level of extremities up a notch; while &quot;traditional&quot; slapstick cartoon characters prefer dropping anvils and pianos on each other, this show sometimes uses atomic bombs or submarines. 

In September 2020, a reboot series was announced, entitled &quot;Oggy and the Cockroaches: Next Generation&quot;, in which Oggy takes care of Piya, a young elephant from India. It was released worldwide on Netflix on 28 July 2022. Although it differs noticeably from the original in terms of its visuals and tone, Gulli labels it as &quot;Oggy&quot;″s eighth season.

==Synopsis==
Oggy, an anthropomorphic cat, would prefer to spend his days watching television and eating but is continually pestered by three roaches: Joey, Marky and Dee Dee. The cockroaches&#x27; slapstick mischief ranges from plundering Oggy&#x27;s refrigerator to hijacking the train he just boarded. In many situations, Oggy is also helped by Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed by the cockroaches. Bob, a short-tempered bulldog, also appears in the show and is Oggy&#x27;s neighbor.

==Episodes==

==Characters==

Some of the characters make a cameo in Xilam&#x27;s other shows, such as &quot;Zig &amp; Sharko&quot; and &quot;The Daltons&quot; and in the film, &quot;Go West! A Lucky Luke Adventure&quot;. The eponymous characters make a debut in the &quot;Space Goofs&quot; episode &quot;Venus Junior&quot;, where they are seen on the aliens&#x27; television (before the pilot episode was officially posted online, in 2016). In the second season, &quot;Space Sailors&quot; has a gag where the cockroaches greet Etno (in the aliens&#x27; now-flooded house), as they row by. Oggy, the cockroaches and Jack appear as drawings in &quot;Doodle&quot;, and Oggy and Monica make a cameo in the episode &quot;The Alien Show&quot;.

===Main===
* Oggy is a cat with a light blue body, green eyes, red nose, grey tummy and white feet. Oggy also has a black &quot;cap&quot; (shaped to include his ears) over the top of his head. Oggy usually spends his time either watching TV or doing housework, when he&#x27;s not chasing the cockroaches. Despite the constant mayhem caused by the cockroaches, Oggy has developed a sort of love–hate relationship with them, having lived with them for a long time. Whenever he finds himself alone in his house, he will eventually begin to miss the cockroaches along with their pranks (as seen in the episode &quot;Priceless Roaches&quot; and &quot;So Lonely&quot;/&quot;Alone at last&quot;) followed by nothing interesting happening in his life. According to executive producer Marc du Pontavice and France Info, Oggy was named after punk rock musician Iggy Pop and the rock album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. In the first three seasons, Oggy, like his &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; counterpart was the main punching bag in the series, though that was phased out in the fourth and fifth seasons. He also has a fear of heights, as shown in &quot;The Rise &amp; the Fall&quot;/&quot;Vertigo&quot; – however, it only applied for Jack&#x27;s construction site.
* The Cockroaches are a trio of cockroaches named Dee Dee, Marky and Joey (who are implied to be named after members of the rock band The Ramones), who love playing tricks on Oggy and the other characters, like Jack. However, if the cats left, they would miss each other, as seen in &quot;Moving Out&quot;. The cockroaches have wide heads, vibrantly-colored sclerae with long, pointy black noses and black feet. They also have black &quot;caps&quot; with their antennae, like Oggy.
** Dee Dee is the youngest cockroach with a dark blue body, orange head and green eyes. Always hungry, his appetite sometimes reaches insane proportions, often resulting in the consumption of larger animals or other things that would otherwise be inedible (such as hyenas in one case and, due to the effects of a poisonous mushroom in another case, an insect; other instances include the fish on the wallpaper in &quot;Oggy&#x27;s Clone&quot;/&quot;Oggy&#x27;s Costume&quot; and a clownfish in &quot;Scuba Diving&quot;). He is known to like opera in &quot;Night at the Opera&quot;, wanting to publicly perform on-stage. Sometimes it is shown that his feet are so foul-smelling that the juice they produce is toxic and can melt objects, as seen in &quot;Caught in a Trap&quot;/&quot;High Security Fridge&quot;. He is named after bassist Dee Dee Ramone.
** Marky is the tallest cockroach with a silver body, green head and pink eyes (originally red). Although Marky originally used to love causing mischief just like Dee Dee and Joey, he has grown to be more laid-back as the series progressed and has a generic role. In most episodes, he is shown with Dee Dee as his partner-in-crime. He sometimes is a hopeless romantic (as seen in &quot;Jealousy&quot; and &quot;Baby Doll&quot;), and his hobbies consist of dating puppets and reading books (which are never shown). He also has bad breath as revealed in &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot;/&quot;Itsy-Bitsy Oggy&quot;. While his eye color changed, they turn red again at one point in &quot;Teleportation&quot;. He is named after drummer Marky Ramone.
** Joey is the smallest cockroach with a purple-pink body, pink right eye (originally red), a yellow left eye, and a lavender head. Even though he is the shortest roach in the group, he is the most intelligent, always being the brain for their plans – but is sometimes forced to go alone, because Marky and Dee Dee often think that his ideas are stupid. He also loves money (which is shown in several episodes), but his efforts always fall short, usually ending with him getting swatted or beaten up. He is named after lead singer Joey Ramone.

===Recurring===
* Jack is a cat with an olive green body, yellow eyes, red nose, pale pink stomach, and white feet. In contrast to Oggy, he is more short-tempered, violent, and arrogant than him. He can be seen as greedy, as shown in a few episodes where he goes against Oggy or teams up with him (such as Tour De France) for money. He often finds himself building huge machinery, such as roach-catching contraptions, and is very interested in physics and chemistry (that is, the more explosive parts of it), though this has been phased out in later seasons. Jack has an excellent relationship with Oggy, as he cares about him a lot, especially in the episode &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; where he tries to stop Oggy from committing suicide. Jack mostly visits and sleeps at Oggy&#x27;s house, and owns a green jeep; in which he and Oggy go for a variety of journeys and in mundane cases, for trips to the beach or going fishing. He is sometimes seen trying to propose to Monica, but the cockroaches&#x27; pranks always stop it. In one episode (&quot;Don&#x27;t Rock the Cradle&quot;/&quot;Oggy the Babysitter&quot;), Jack and Monica seem to have a baby together and ask Oggy to babysit their child. In &quot;Just Married&quot;, Jack plans to marry a poodle, but it got cancelled at the end due to the cockroaches sneaking in and causing trouble.
* Bob is a fierce brown bulldog and Oggy&#x27;s neighbor, who has severe anger issues with him – especially when Oggy, Jack or the roaches do something that accidentally crushes Bob, shaves his fur or destroys his house, with him proceeding to pummel Oggy or Jack off-screen. Despite this, he has some sort of friendship with them, as notably seen in some episodes like &quot;Olivia&quot;, &quot;Steamed Out&quot;, &quot;Oggy Splits Hairs&quot;, &quot;Back To The Past&quot;, etc. Even though Bob is tough, he also has a comically sensitive side, as shown in &quot;Oggy&#x27;s Teddy Bear&quot;, where it&#x27;s also revealed he&#x27;s a toy collector. In addition, Bob also works as a police officer in several episodes. However, in one episode (&quot;Back To School&quot;), he was presented as a teacher to Oggy and Jack.
* Olivia is a white cat with a yellow bow on her head who debuts in the fourth season&#x27;s first episode, and becomes Oggy&#x27;s girlfriend. She is happy-go-lucky and polite, being fond of nature and finding any sort of opportunity for fun. In spite of her optimistic outlooks, though she is aware of the cockroaches&#x27; mischief; so she stops them when they are around by using some aggressive methods (however, in &quot;Oggy and the Not-So-Smart Bracelet&quot;, she outright retaliates at Marky). Olivia also cares a lot about her appearance, as seen in the episode &quot;Olivia&#x27;s Pimple&quot;, where she refuses to leave her house when she saw a pimple on her face. In &quot;Oggy Is Getting Married!&quot;, as the episode title implies, Olivia and Oggy marry after a trip to Venice, Italy and she currently is Oggy&#x27;s wife. However, their life after said marriage is not shown later in the series.

===Other===
* Oggy&#x27;s grandma is the least known member of Oggy&#x27;s family who appears in several episodes, including &quot;Granny&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;Oggy&#x27;s Grandma&quot; (where she appears to be very strict with Oggy&#x27;s mannerisms). She also makes a cameo in &quot;Deep Trouble&quot; where she supports Oggy and Jack, along with Monica. In &quot;Granny&#x27;s Day&quot;, she decides to attack the cockroaches, but eventually spared the cockroaches at the end. She is then actually attacked by them in &quot;Oggy&#x27;s Grandma&quot;, once getting her head flattened by the lid of Oggy&#x27;s toilet. She also gets frequent, short-lasting bursts of energy from coffee, which aids her in defeating the cockroaches. In &quot;Granny&#x27;s Day&quot;, she successfully captures Joey and Marky – but later feels sympathy for them when Dee Dee cries on a picture of the trio, with the other two crossed out.
* Monica is Oggy&#x27;s twin sister and Jack&#x27;s love interest, the latter of whom she has a child within &quot;Don&#x27;t Rock the Cradle&quot;/&quot;Oggy the Babysitter&quot;. A sporty tomboy compared to Oggy, she&#x27;s known for being active and taking on physical challenges such as sky diving and bungee jumping. She sometimes is seen rollerskating, and wears a pair of them casually. Out of all the characters, Monica appears the least – however, she makes a brief cameo in &quot;Oggy Is Getting Married!&quot;, where she sits next to Bob. She later plays a major role as Olivia&#x27;s rival in the episode, &quot;Sharing Oggy&quot;, although they later become friends.
* Lady K is a light yellow female cockroach who debuted in the episode of the same name (also in the fourth season), as the cockroaches&#x27; new love interest (mainly Joey&#x27;s) – to which she takes advantage of. She lives in Olivia&#x27;s house which Olivia is not aware of, and hates her for unknown reasons. She frequently attempts to use the cockroaches as her pawns to get what she wants or her job done.
* Pit is a gray dog living in the same neighborhood as Oggy, who debuted in the fourth season. Like Bob, he is also strong.
* Bobette is Bob&#x27;s daughter who debuted in the fifth season. She is Jack&#x27;s love interest, as seen in the episodes &quot;Marky&#x27;s Tournament&quot; (where Marky also had a crush on her) and &quot;Jackromeo and Bobette&quot;. She is seen in the episode &quot;Emperor for a Day&quot; as Napoleon&#x27;s love interest. 
* The Policeman is an unnamed human policeman who is normally seen in traffic, or sometimes wherever Oggy has traveled to. Sometimes Oggy or Jack accidentally annoy him, due to the cockroaches&#x27; mischief. He appears in every season, except for the fifth.
* The Doctor is an unnamed human doctor who sometimes visits Oggy&#x27;s house when Oggy gets sick, or in other cases, when another character (like Jack) assumes Oggy has gone mad. He sometimes wears a nurse&#x27;s outfit. In the episodes &quot;A Dog Day&#x27;s Afternoon&quot;/&quot;Cute Little Puppy&quot;, it is revealed that he has a pet puppy (which Oggy took care of). He is also shown in &quot;Missing In Action&quot;/&quot;Where is the Exit?&quot; as an artist (specifically, a painter). The Doctor is later absent in season 5.

==Production==
The project dates back to 1997, shortly after the success of &quot;Space Goofs&quot;, when Marc du Pontavice asked Jean-Yves Raimbaud to create an animated series in order to &quot;counter the surge of superheroes, manga and Franco-Belgian comic book heroes. After his death, Olivier Jean-Marie, director of the series, decided not to modify the design of Oggy, in particular his blue color. The first name of each of the three cockroaches, Joey, Dee-Dee and Marky, refers to three of the members of the punk rock group called the Ramones. Oggy, for his part, owes his first name to the famous singer Iggy Pop as well as the character of Ziggy Stardust created by David Bowie. Iggy Pop also sang for the theme song of &quot;Space Goofs&quot;.

After a four-year gap in production, season 5 was released in late 2017 with two more seasons coming later. Season 6 episodes began airing on K2 while Season 5 was previewed on Gulli.

In the Philippines, the series aired on TV5 in 2010. In late 2011, it was welcomed on Cartoon Network line-up and adored by the channel, and still airs due to the said show being one of the network&#x27;s top-viewed programs. It also aired on Disney Channel from 2009 to 31 December 2013. It moved on GMA Network on 3 September 2022, under the network&#x27;s &quot;Astig Authority&quot; Saturday morning block.

In 2015, Nickelodeon started rebroadcasting the show&#x27;s older episodes, from seasons 1 to 3. Later, the series was also picked up by Sonic Nickelodeon which broadcast the same seasons as Nick. Season 5 started airing on Cartoon Network from 14 August 2017. Seasons 3 and 6, 7 aired later, during 2018–19 in Cartoon Network India. In 2020, Sonic Nickelodeon started airing season 4 again. Cartoon Network aired seasons 5 to 7 until March 2022. From 2021, Sony YAY! took over the rights of all seven seasons.

In the United States, Nickelodeon began airing the series on January 31, 2015. The series&#x27; run on the network was short lived, as the series entered a brief controversy when the network aired an episode in which a framed picture of a topless woman was seen in the background of a shot. The episode was quickly removed from rotation, and both the network and Xilam declined to comment. Beginning in April, the series moved to Nicktoons and was quietly removed from the schedule by the end of that year.

<doc id="1263064" wikidata="Q1138481" url="?curid=1263064" title="Maunder (lunar crater)">
<text>Maunder is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the western limb. This region is sometimes brought into view during favorable librations, but not much detail can be seen. The crater lies at the northern end of the Mare Orientale, within the ring of mountains named Montes Rook, and it is the largest crater on this lunar mare. To the southeast is the crater Kopff, and due south is the small Hohmann.

The rim of Maunder is roughly circular, with a sharp edge that has not been significantly eroded. The inner walls are somewhat d, and slump down to a rough but level interior floor. At the midpoint of the crater is a double central peak, with the northeastern peak being the larger of the two. Surrounding the crater is a rough outer that mixes with the rugged terrain along the northern half of the rim. Secondary impacts are visible in the surface to the south.

Maunder is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Name origin==
The crater was named after Annie Maunder, a Northern Irish astronomer who worked alongside her husband, Edward Walter Maunder, at the end of the 19th century. Edward Maunder identified the period of colder climate from 1645 to 1715 that is now known as the Maunder Minimum. The name of the crater was approved by the IAU in 1970.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Maunder.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Maunder Z — &quot;See&quot; Couder (crater).

<text>Mihael Milunović (born July 2, 1967) is a Serbian and French painter. His work encompasses a wide range of artistic disciplines, from painting, drawing and photography through large-scale sculptures, installations, to sound, video and objects. His main interests focus on social and political issues. By decontextualizing everyday objects, symbols or situations, Milunović provokes unease in the observer, a blend of alienation and curiosity.

In 2018, he obtained the prestigious Award from the French Académie des Beaux-Arts for his painting work.

His works are featured in prestigious museum collections including MUMOK, Vienna; Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade; Palazzo Forti, Verona; and Musée d’Art et d’Industrie, Saint-Étienne, France.
He has participated in numerous individual and group exhibitions, among others: MUMOK Ludwig Museum Vienna; Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume, Paris; Musée d&#x27;art moderne (Saint-Étienne) ; Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade; The Stedelijk Museum, Aalst, Belgium; Esterhazy Foundation Schloss Esterházy, Eisenstaedt; Musee d&#x27;Art Modeste, Sete; PAN Naples; The Kunsthalle Fridericianum, Kassel; The Biennials in Poznań and Valencia; Wiener Secessionsgebäude, in Vienna, and others.
In June 2017, Milunović&#x27;s work &quot;Vision/Blue Mountain&quot; covered the highest building in Vienna over , the Ringturm, seat of Vienna Insurance Group, marking the ten-year jubilee of this company&#x27;s art project &quot;Wrapping of Ringturm&quot;. The ceremony was opened with a speech of Sebastian Kurz, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Austria.

==Early life and education==
Milunović was born in Belgrade, to Nikola Kolja Milunović and Ana Viđen. His father is a well known Serbian sculptor and first son of Milo Milunović (1897–1967), a Montenegrin painter that dabbled in both Impressionism and Cubism and was one of the founders of Academy of Arts, Belgrade in 1937. His mother Ana Viđen was a sculptor of Croatian origin.

Milunović studied painting at the University of Arts in Belgrade and at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. In 1996 he was awarded Laureate of the prestigious Prix de la Fondation Renoir.

==Period 1999–2009==

Soon after his return to Paris, in 2000 he exposed his works in Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume, within the exhibition &quot;L&#x27;autre moitié de l&#x27;Europe&quot;, in a part curated by dr. Lorand Hegyi. Milunović met Lorand Hegyi during the show, and the long term collaboration was born. Milunović artworks were included the next year (2001) in MUMOK Museum Ludwig in Vienna, Austria and consequently in Collection Siemens AG in Vienna. He debuted with the Galerie Ernst Hilger, and continued working with him until 2004.

Between 2001 and 2003, Milunović participated in the Biennale of Valencia in 2003, together with Roman Opalka, Dennis Oppenheim and Ilya Kabakov. During this period Milunović also collaborated on number of exhibition projects with Cité des Sciences in Paris.

Milunović moved from Paris to Saint-Étienne in France&#x27;s, central region, where he developed projects with the École supérieure d&#x27;art et design Saint-Étienne, where he held an experimental class, and also many artistic and exhibition projects; he participated in several museum shows in Musée d&#x27;art moderne (Saint-Étienne) in 2004 (Passage d’Europe together with Anri Sala, Dan Perjovschi, Simon Hantai) and 2005 (Domicile, with Jan Fabre and others). He traveled and exhibited in South Korea (2006) and Italy, notably in Palazzo d&#x27;Arte di Napoli (PAN), and started working with Gallery Changing Role in Naples, Italy and Galerie Georges Verney-Carron in Lyon, France.

In 2006 he founded NGO ProArtOrg that organised the first Belgrade show of an important American artist since the war in Yugoslavia 1991–1995. It was the show of Dennis Oppenheim followed by a series of lectures given by Thommas Messer, director emeritus of Guggenheim Foundation and dr. Lorand Hegyi, then director of Musée d&#x27;art moderne (Saint-Étienne). In 2007 he opened a show &quot;Uncomfortable Realities&quot; in Galerie Piece Unique in Paris, France, showing new sculptural works and works on paper. The show gained great attention. In 2008 he started a collaboration with Galerie Guy Baertschi from Geneva. In 2009 he moved again to Paris, only to complete a large sculptural work entitled &quot;Mothership&quot;, realised with a group of de-scolarised children in Saint-Étienne and with a help of NGO Paria and city of Saint-Étienne.

==Period 2009–2017==
At the end of 2009 Milunović moved to Brussels. He started to paint large scale paintings that were shown in Museum of Contemporary Art Belgrade in 2014, and consequently became part of important art collections (Collecion Solo, Wiener städtische, Esterhazy). In 2015 he returns to Paris, where he lives and works since.

<doc id="1263067" wikidata="Q189948" url="?curid=1263067" title="Central African Republic national football team">
<text>The Central African Republic national football team (French: &quot;Équipe de République centrafricaine de football&quot;), nicknamed &quot;Les Fauves&quot;, is the national team of the Central African Republic and is controlled by the Central African Football Federation. They are a member of CAF. Despite being traditionally one of the weakest teams in Africa and the world, they recently achieved success. They won the 2009 CEMAC Cup by beating Gabon in the semi-finals and Equatorial Guinea in the final 3–0. Their FIFA ranking rose from 202nd in August 2010 to 89th by July 2011. On 10 October 2010, they earned a shock 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier win at home against Algeria 2–0, which put them top of their qualification group. The team won its first FIFA World Cup qualifier on 2 June 2012 after beating Botswana 2–0 at home.

==History==
===Early years (1956–1989)===
The team made its debut under the name of Ubangi-Shari in 1956 against French Cameroon. The Central African Football Federation was founded in 1961 and joined FIFA in 1964 and CAF in 1965.

Their first competitive match was in the 1961 Friendship Games in Ivory Coast where Central African Republic drew twice against Upper Volta and Liberia before losing to the hosts and failing to progress to the next round.

Central African Republic entered the 1974 African Cup of Nations qualification for the first time, progressing due to Gabon&#x27;s withdrawal but were then eliminated 5–4 on aggregate by Ivory Coast, a tie which saw the second leg abandoned at half-time after arguments between players of both sides, forcing a replay in Lagos which Ivory Coast won 5–1.

They took part in 1984 UDEAC Cup where they qualified to the knock-out rounds on goal-difference over Equatorial Guinea but were then heavily beaten by Cameroon 7–1 before beating Gabon on penalties to finish third. However in the 1988 UDEAC Cup, Gabon would get their revenge, beating Central African Republic in the semi-finals. The following year Central African Republic would host the 1989 UDEAC Cup, making it to the finals, beating Gabon on the way, before losing 2–1 to Cameroon.

===Sporadic matches (1990–2008)===
During the 1990s, Central African Republic played very few international games, withdrawing from the 1996 African Cup of Nations qualification without playing a match. They returned to competition in the UNIFAC Cup in 1999, winning three times and losing twice to finish second.

Central African Republic participated in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers for the first time, losing in the first round to Zimbabwe. They reached the final of the inaugural CEMAC Cup, losing to an amateur Cameroon team that they&#x27;d drawn with a week earlier in the tournament.

===Promising victories (2009–2019)===
In 2009, Central African Republic hosted the 2009 CEMAC Cup where they defeated Equatorial Guinea 3–0 in the final, with goals from Salif Kéïta and a brace from Hilaire Momi to claim their first trophy. 

During the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Central African Republic achieved a historic 2–0 home victory over the top seeded Algeria, a team that had recently competed at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In July 2011, they climbed to 89th place in the FIFA world rankings, having occupied 202nd place as recently as August 2010. 

On 2 June 2012, they obtained their first victory in World Cup qualification, beating Botswana 2–0 at home. Despite that positive result, Central African Republic finished bottom of their group. On 15 June 2012, despite being reduced to ten men, they achieved another impressive victory, beating Egypt 3–2 in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, inflicting the first home defeat on the Egyptians in AFCON qualifiers since 1965. Thanks to a 1–1 draw at home in the second leg, Central African Republic eliminated the Egyptians, but in the second round they were defeated by Burkina Faso.

===Missed opportunities (2020–present)===

On 30 March 2021, in the last group stage match of the Africa Cup of Nations qualification, Central African Republic lost 1–0 at home against Mauritania to finish bottom of their group; hence, they missed the opportunity, had they won, to finish second which would have qualified them for the final tournament for the first time in their history.

On 17 June 2023, Central African Republic needed a win at home against Angola on matchday 5 of the qualifications to secure their first ever participation in the Africa Cup of Nations; however, the match ended in a 2–1 defeat and a drop to third place. In the final group stage match, the national team lost 2–1 to Ghana, despite a 1–0 lead, which ended their last hope of qualification.

==== FIFA Series tournament ====
In 2024, Central African Republic played their first ever tournament outside Africa where FIFA invited them to the 2024 FIFA Series matches on from 22 to 25 March 2024 held in Colombo in Sri Lanka where they would face Bhutan and Papua New Guinea.

<text>The Battle of Kojima (児島合戦), also called Battle of Fujito (藤戸の戦い), was a battle of the Genpei War of the Heian period of Japanese history, and took place in 1184.

== Battle ==
In pursuit of the fleeing Taira from Ichi-no-Tani, on their way to Yashima, Minamoto no Noriyori engaged and defeated his enemies in battle at Kojima. The attack was led by Sasaki Moritsuna, who swam his horse across a narrow strait between Kojima and the mainland of Honshū.

<text>Delta Virginis (δ Virginis, abbreviated Del Vir, δ Vir), formally named Minelauva , is a star in the zodiac constellation of Virgo. With an apparent visual magnitude of 3.4, this star is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. It is located at a distance of about from Earth.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;δ Virginis&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Delta Virginis&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

It bore the traditional, medieval names &quot;Auva&quot; and &quot;Minelauva&quot; from the Arabic من العواء &quot;min al-ʽawwāʼ&quot;, meaning &quot;in the lunar mansion of &quot;ʽawwaʼ&quot;&quot; (a name of unknown meaning). In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Minelauva&quot; for this star on 30 June 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

This star, along with Beta Virginis (Zavijava), Gamma Virginis (Porrima), Eta Virginis (Zaniah) and Epsilon Virginis (Vindemiatrix), were &quot;Al ʽAwwāʼ&quot;, &#x27;the Barker&#x27;.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Left Wall of Supreme Palace Enclosure&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Delta Virginis, Eta Virginis, Gamma Virginis, Epsilon Virginis and Alpha Comae Berenices. Consequently, the Chinese name for Delta Virginis itself is (, ), representing (), meaning &#x27;The Second Eastern Minister&#x27;. 東次相 (Dōngcìxiāng), westernized into &quot;Tsze Seang&quot; by R.H. Allen and meaning &quot;the Second Minister of State&quot;.

== Properties ==
The spectrum of Delta Virginis matches a stellar classification of M3 III, which places it among the category of evolved stars called red giants. Indeed, the outer atmosphere of this star has expanded to around 67 times the radius of the Sun. Even though it has just 1.19 times the mass of the Sun, this wide envelope gives it a luminosity of nearly 700 times the Sun&#x27;s. This energy is being radiated from a relatively cool outer atmosphere that has an effective temperature of 3,643 K. It is this cool temperature that gives it the orange-red glow of an M-type star.
The outer envelope of this star is undergoing a type of pulsation that occurs in a class of variable stars known as semiregular variables and its brightness varies from magnitude +3.32 to +3.40. Based upon frequency analysis of the observed light curve, the star&#x27;s variability exhibits multiple periods of pulsation. The detected periods are 13.0, 17.2, 25.6, 110.1 and 125.8 days. This is a high-velocity star with a peculiar velocity of more than relative to the mean motion of other stars in the vicinity.

Delta Virginis is a possible binary star, as an 11th magnitude star is located at an angular separation of 80 arcseconds. This K-type dwarf may have an orbital period of over 200,000 years, but this has not been confirmed.
==Substellar companion==
A 2023 study detected radial velocity variations in Delta Virginis (HD 112300), showing evidence of a substellar companion, likely a brown dwarf.

<doc id="1263071" wikidata="Q77491" url="?curid=1263071" title="Hans Carossa">
<text>Hans Carossa (15 December 1878 in Bad Tölz, Kingdom of Bavaria – 12 September 1956 in Rittsteig near Passau) was a German novelist and poet, known mostly for his autobiographical novels, and his inner emigration during the Nazi era.

He studied medicine, working as a field surgeon from 1916 to 1918.
He was awarded the Swiss Gottfried Keller Prize in 1931, and the Goethe Prize in 1938.

== Biography ==

===Carossa family===

The Carossas were originally of North Italian stock; however, by 1878, when Hans was born, they no longer spoke Italian and were considered simply Upper Bavarian Germans. Hans&#x27; father, Karl Carossa, was a well-known lung specialist, who had published some significant research in his field. He had a calm humanitarian outlook, which endeared him to the local Catholic population in spite of his cool relationship with the Church. Carossa explains in the first volume of his autobiography, &quot;Eine Kindheit&quot; (&quot;A Childhood&quot;):

Carossa&#x27;s mother, on the other hand, was a devoutly Catholic and quite sensitive person. The young couple had just settled in the south Bavarian resort town of Bad Tölz when Hans was born, and then lived in several Bavarian hamlets. These moves left a feeling of insecurity in the mind of their sensitive and introspective son. Although Hans had a younger sister, Stephanie, a close relationship with her is not evident. He attended the &quot;Volksschule&quot; in Pilsting and then Gymnasium in Landshut. After receiving his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1897, he studied medicine at three universities: the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, the University of Würzburg, and finally at the University of Leipzig, where he graduated in 1903.

Hans&#x27; interest in poetry began when he was quite young, but it was soon rivaled by the family tradition of medicine. The disparity between the impractical, otherworldly realm of the poet and the very down-to-earth life of a medical doctor haunted him for most of his life; practically all of his spare time during his university studies was spent in literary circles. Just after the turn of the century, the 24-year-old Carossa began medical practice in the south-east Bavarian border city of Passau. In 1907, the successful young doctor married a patient, Valerie Endlicher, and moved to the country.

===Early career===

Hans Carossa&#x27;s first published work, the poem &quot;Stella Mystica&quot;, appeared in 1907. The poem, which is faintly reminiscent of a thirteenth century &quot;Tagelied&quot;, contains a classic theme which continues throughout the rest of Carossa&#x27;s writings: unshakable faith in the ultimate victory of the powers of light over darkness. As might be expected of a first publication, however, the poem lacks the polish and maturity so typical of the poet&#x27;s later work. 

The year 1907 was a crucial one for a young Roman Catholic who longed to become a writer, especially one whose idols had been poets such as Richard Dehmel and Frank Wedekind; for it was in 1907 that Pope Pius X issued the encyclical &quot;Pascendi dominici gregis&quot;, bitterly condemning modernism in the arts. As with later more serious threats to his freedom of expression, Carossa was not deeply moved by this order from his church. Other literary and political figures fought the encyclical vigorously; Carossa neither complied nor complained.

It is evident from the correspondence between Carossa and Hugo von Hofmannsthal of the period that in the following year, 1908, Carossa all but quit medicine in favor of writing. The literary career of young doctor Carossa began three years later with a little 48-page collection of poems, simply titled &quot;Gedichte&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;). The publication of this book also marked the inauguration of Carossa&#x27;s lifelong association with the Insel publishing house. 
The problem of the relationship between the doctor and his patient, especially the moribund patient, tore at the soul of the youthful physician. It was natural that Carossa should attempt, as his literary idol Goethe had done in &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;, to write his way out of his most perplexing problems. In fact, Carossa&#x27;s &quot;Doktor Bürgers Ende&quot; of 1913 had too much in common with Werther, not only in its motivation, but also in form and plot, to be an original artistic creation. It represents, rather the culmination of the author&#x27;s period of imitation which had started with the apery of contemporary modernists, and worked backwards in time, until, in copying Goethe, Carossa discovered himself. A guiding thought or &quot;Leitwort&quot; for Carossa splendidly epitomized his patient-doctor relationship, in ideas borrowed from his father: &quot;Ja, meinem Herzen am nächsten sind jetzt die Verlorenen, die, von denen ich weiss, dass ich sie nicht retten werde.&quot;

In the years just before World War I, literary interests were the chief concern in the young doctor&#x27;s life. He took notes, planned works, and sought companionship and criticism of such literary figures as Rainer Maria Rilke and Hofmannstahl.

===World War I===

In 1914 Carossa, who was a little too old to be called up immediately, volunteered as an army physician. During the inevitable waiting so common to all military service, Carossa collected childhood memories into what was to become Eine Kindheit, kept a record of his war experiences later published as Rumänisches Tagebuch, and also made notes which served as the basis for a large section of his &quot;Lebensgedankenbuch&quot; titled Führung und Geleit. Carossa served as battalion medical officer on both fronts: first a short period in France, then an extended stay in the southeastern theater (Rumänisches Tagebuch), where his unit was involved in the Second Battle of Oituz. In 1918 Carossa&#x27;s unit was transferred back to northern France where he suffered a shoulder wound which ended his military career.

===Weimar Republic===

The gay and lively Munich which Carossa had remembered from before the war greeted the convalescent veteran with somber, black-veiled women, limping men, and empty store windows. This was no time for poets of limited ability, as Carossa considered himself. At the time he felt earnestly: &quot;In den Jahren der Prüfung und Erniedrigung, wenn das Volk trauernd zur Erde schaut, wird ihm der Dichter stets am allernächsten sein.&quot; But his own destiny was to be primarily that of a doctor.

&quot;Ich werde wieder an Krankenbetten sitzen, über fremde Leiden Buch führen, Diagnosen und Prognosen stellen, Heilmittel verordnen, Zeugnisse verfassen, öfters Nachts gerufen werden, und von Zeit zu Zeit eine Urlaubsreise antreten und hie und da einmal ein paar Verse oder eine Seite Prosa schreiben ... Dem ärztlichen Wesen wollte ich verbunden bleiben und falls ich etwas schriebe, mit der Sprache kaum anders umgehen als mit den Heilgiften, auf deren genaue Dosierung ich eingeübt war.&quot; He considered it a good omen that while purchasing new medical instruments during his convalescence in Munich, he met Rilke who then turned out to be the first patient of his renewed practice. Upon his own recovery he returned to his Passau office. With renewed dedication, he read medical journals and went to lectures at the clinic to improve his abilities. The Passau practice grew and kept him quite busy. Nevertheless, in a later addition to his autobiographies, published posthumously, he concedes that when he moved to Munich, not long after reestablishing his Passau practice he fully intended to give up medicine for the life of a &#x27;freier Schriftsteller&#x27;: a wish which could not then become reality. 
Doctor Carossa did however, find a little time for the &quot;&quot;Heilgifte&quot; of literature. In 1922, the author of Doktor Bürger, which had been so glaringly modelled on Goethe&#x27;s Werther, published the first volume of his autobiography, &quot;Eine Kindheit.&quot; The relationship between Carossa&#x27;s four part autobiography (&quot;Eine Kindheit, Verwandlung einer Jugend, Das Jahr der schönen Täuschungen,&quot; and &quot;Der Tag des jungen Arztes&quot;) and Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Dichtung und Wahrheit&quot; is much more subtle than that between &quot;Werther&quot; and &quot;Doktor Bürger&quot;. Doctor Carossa had already by this time published three other works: &quot;Stella Mystica, Gedichte,&quot; and a fifteen-page lyrical pamphlet titled &quot;Ostern&quot;. The success of &quot;Eine Kindheit&quot; rekindled Doctor Carossa&#x27;s enthusiasm. Again, as in 1908, a completely literary career hung temptingly before his eyes. His writings were as yet producing only a meager income, but each new word of praise by friends and critics made the switch in emphasis from a career as doctor-poet to one of poet-doctor a little more feasible. In 1923 he published a third edition of &quot;Gedichte,&quot; now twice as large as the original 1910 edition. Further heartened by the response to his newer poems, Carossa released later in the same year his third prose work, &quot;Rumänisches Tagebuch&quot;. This book was very well received and was remunerative enough that in the mid-twenties Carossa was relieved of financial dependence on his medical practice. 
The most obvious sign of Carossa&#x27;s financial success and definite turn toward literature was his ability to fulfill his desire for a Goethean pilgrimage to classic Italy. Such a pilgrimage had meant much to Goethe&#x27; s classical development and could have perhaps done the same for Carossa, but Carossa had had to wait too long for his &quot;Italienische Reise&quot;&quot;. The world of 1925 was being shaken by ominous political happenings which were soon to bar any possibility of Carossa&#x27;s accomplishing the degree of classic detachment that Goethe had been able to enjoy. In 1922, three years before Carossa&#x27;s Italian trip, Italy had become the second totalitarian state of Europe. It called itself Fascist, while the first had designated itself Communist; but in terms of freedom of expression for an individual citizen, Communism and Fascism were synonymous. Germany, at the time, was still a democratic republic, but already in 1924, a little-known party with 
the catch-all name of National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party had won 6.5% of the votes in the Reichstag election. 
Classically oriented Carossa did not seem to be at all impressed by these events. By leaving his Munich practice for Italy, he made a major break with the medical profession; when he returned only old friends, those he wanted to treat, would visit his office, and he could spend most of his days at literary composition. Soon after coming back from the classic land, he published the second of his autobiographical series, &quot;Verwandlung einer Jugend&quot; (1926). This same year also brought sadness into Carossa&#x27;s life when on 29 December his dear friend Rilke died. 
Autobiographical material from Carossa dealing with the period from the mid-twenties to the early thirties is scant; and, since Carossa&#x27;s own writings are to an excessive degree the only source of information about the man, very little is known about those years. Letters to his wife&#x27;s family indicate that he was very concerned with his wife&#x27;s illness, which resulted in her dependency on morphine. During the 1920s he began a relationship with his later second wife, Hedwig Kerber, with a child born in 1930. The lack of literary production may indicate that problems of the German economy, primarily the disastrous inflation, had made it necessary for Carossa to return to practice. He did rework &quot;Doktor Bürger&quot; and republished it in 1929 as &quot;Schicksal Doktor Bürgers&quot;, and one year earlier his home city of Munich had honored him with its &quot;Dichterpreis&quot;. Perhaps these years of relative silence were filled with preparation for the two fine works in the offing, the first of which was to appear in 1931.

On 25 May 1931 Thomas Mann&#x27;s son Klaus Mann first considered emigrating from his native land because of the political situation. Two years later, he, the rest of the Mann family, and many others of Germany&#x27;s finest minds did go into exile. In 1931 Carossa, outwardly at least, undisturbed by the &quot;gathering storm&quot; published &quot;Der Arzt Gion&quot;. Although still strongly autobiographical, this work was his first and only major work written in the third person. (The only other one was his short story &quot;Ein Tag im Spätsommer 1947&quot;.) Der &quot;Arzt Gion&quot; reflects a maturity and optimism which had been becoming increasingly evident in Carossa&#x27;s works, but which seems strangely out of place in the depression-scarred, dictator-threatened Europe of 1931. From now on, except for a short period toward the end of World War II, the poet-doctor Carossa gave up medical practice completely. Carossa&#x27;s last book before the Nazi Regime began was &quot;Führung und Geleit&quot; (1932), an inner survey rather than a true autobiography of his life from early youth to the 1920.

===Nazi Germany===

After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Carossa chose the Inner emigration and rejected his appointment to the German Academy of Poetry, but in 1938 he accepted the Goethe Prize of the City of Frankfurt, and in 1941 at the European Poets&#x27; Meeting he was appointed President of the &quot;European Writers&#x27; League&quot;, which was founded by Joseph Goebbels in 1941/42, vice president was Giovanni Papini. Carossa contributed a poem to an anthology that was published by August Friedrich Velmede and called &quot;Dem Führer. Worte deutscher Dichter&quot; (i.e. &quot;To the Leader. Words by German poets&quot;):
:&quot; ... Encouraged we return to our own task
: and wish to the brave one, 
: to the fighter and leader who bears all our destiny
: the best and good luck.&quot;

Next year he stayed away from the embarrassing event. Despite his distance from the Nazi regime, Carossa was one of the most promoted writers. In 1944, in the final phase of the Second World War, Carossa was included by Hitler on the Gottbegnadeten list, the list of the six most important German writers.

Success and honors in the neutral and friendly (fascist) foreign countries (Premio San Remo 1939) and the financial rise – quadrupling his income in 1941 – met an internally distanced Carossa, who also knew how to use his position. So in 1941 he stood up for the writer Alfred Mombert, who was endangered because of his Jewish heritage, so that Mombert was allowed to leave Germany for Switzerland. Shortly before the capitulation in 1945, Carossa pleaded in a letter to the Lord Mayor of Passau to hand over the city without a fight and was sentenced to death in absentia. The rapid approach of the US Army saved him.

===After 1945===

After the war, Carossa processed his role in the Nazi era. However, his book &quot;Ungleiche Welten&quot; (Unequal Worlds) of 1951 was criticized, it veiled and glossed over, presented the poet as apolitical and the National Socialists as a power of fate against which no resistance was possible.

In West Germany he again achieved his popularity of the 1920s and 1930s. Federal President of Germany Theodor Heuss visited him at his home in 1954.

Hans Carossa is the namesake of his former school Hans-Carossa-Gymnasium Landshut and the Hans-Carossa-Gymnasium in Berlin-Spandau, the elementary school in Pilsting (Lower Bavaria), the elementary school Passau-Heining – near which his last residence as well as his grave is located – , the Hans-Carossa-Hospital in Stühlingen as well as a multitude of streets all over Germany, among others in Passau, Münster, Nuremberg and Berlin.

<text>The Nilotic languages are a group of related languages spoken across a wide area between South Sudan and Tanzania by the Nilotic peoples.

== Etymology ==
The word Nilotic means of or relating to the Nile River or to the Nile region of Africa.

== Demographics ==
Nilotic peoples, who are the native speakers of the languages, originally migrated from the Gezira area in Sudan. Nilotic language speakers live in parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.

== Subdivisions ==
According to linguist Joseph Greenberg, the language family is divided up into three subgroups:

*Eastern Nilotic languages such as Turkana and Maasai
*Southern Nilotic languages such as Kalenjin and Datooga
*Western Nilotic languages such as Luo, Nuer and Dinka

Before Greenberg&#x27;s reclassification, Nilotic was used to refer to Western Nilotic alone, with the other two being grouped as related &quot;Nilo-Hamitic&quot; languages.

Blench (2012) treats the Burun languages as a fourth subgroup of Nilotic. In previous classifications, the languages were included within the Luo languages. Starostin (2015) treats the Mabaan-Burun languages as &quot;West Nilotic&quot; but outside the Luo level.

==Reconstruction==
Over 200 Proto-Nilotic lexical roots have been reconstructed by Dimmendaal (1988).
Dimmendaal reconstructs the proto Nilotic consonants as follows:

<text>The Eastern Nilotic languages are one of the three primary branches of the Nilotic languages, themselves belonging to the Eastern Sudanic subfamily of Nilo-Saharan; they are believed to have begun to diverge about 3,000 years ago, and have spread southwards from an original home in Equatoria in South Sudan. They are spoken across a large area in East Africa, ranging from Equatoria to the highlands of Tanzania. Their speakers are mostly cattle herders living in semi-arid or arid plains.

==Classification==
According to Vossen (1982), the Eastern Nilotic languages are basically classified as follows by the comparative method. Vossen (1982) also provides a reconstruction of Proto-Eastern Nilotic.
*Eastern Nilotic
**Bari languages
**Teso–Lotuko–Maa:
***Teso–Turkana (or Ateker; incl. Karimojong)
***Lotuko–Maa:
****Lotuko languages
*****Lango language
*****Lopit language
*****Lokoya language
*****Lotuko language
*****Dongotono language
****Ongamo–Maa
*****Ongamo language
*****Maa languages
******Maasai language (see also Mukogodo-Maasai)
******Camus language
******Samburu language (see also Elmolo-Samburu)
It is generally agreed upon that Bari forms a primary branch, but lower-level splits are less clear.

===Swadesh approach (Vossen 1982)===
Vossen&#x27;s classification using the Swadesh approach is as follows (Vossen 1982:114).
*Eastern Nilotic
**Bari languages
***Mondari
***Kakwa
***Nyanggwara
***Kuku
***Pöjulu
***Ngyepu
***Bari
**Lotuko–Maa languages
***Lotuko languages
****Lopit, Dongotono
****Lotuko, Lokoya
***Ongamo–Maa languages
****Ongamo
*****Maasai
******Camus, Samburu
**Teso–Turkana languages
***Teso
****Nyangatom
*****Turkana, Karimojong
===Gleason approach (Vossen 1982)===
Vossen&#x27;s classification using the Gleason approach is as follows (Vossen 1982:119).
*Eastern Nilotic
**Bari languages
***Kuku, Ngyepu
***Pöjulu
***Kakwa
***Bari
***Nyanggwara, Mondari
**Lotuko languages
***Lopit, Dongotono
***Lotuko, Lokoya
**Teso–Turkana languages
***Nyangatom
****Teso
*****Turkana, Karimojong
***Ongamo–Maa languages
****Ongamo
*****Maasai
******Camus, Samburu
==Gender Marking==
Gender marking through prefixes (or proclitics) on nouns is an innovation in the Eastern Nilotic languages that is not found in the other branches of Nilotic. However, not every Eastern Nilotic language has this feature: for example, Bari does not have it.

==Comparative vocabulary==

<text>A recreational vehicle park (RV park) or caravan park is a place where people with recreational vehicles can stay overnight, or longer, in allotted spaces known as &quot;sites&quot; or &quot;campsites&quot;. They are also referred to as campgrounds, though a true campground also provides facilities for tent camping; many facilities calling themselves &quot;RV parks&quot; also offer tent camping or cabins with limited facilities.

==Services==

Allocated space (pitch/site) facilities may include:
* AC power connection. (Usually rated by capacity such as 15, 20, 30 or 50 amperes.)
* Drinking water connection
* Sewer connection
* Television connection (relevant to local area standards)
* Telephone connection (rare outside North America)
* Hotspot (Wi-Fi)

Park facilities may include:
* Barbecue area
* Bathhouses
* Convenience store
* Dump station
* Exercise equipment
* Gift shop
* Golf Courses
* Hot tubs
* Laundry
* Picnic tables
* Restrooms
* Recreation Hall
* Showers
* Swimming pool
* Bar/restaurant
Occasionally, Electric Vehicle owners will use the electrical facilities at RV parks to charge their cars - especially in rural areas where other charging facilities are unavailable. In North America, &quot;50 amp&quot; (NEMA 14-50) connections are especially desirable for EV charging. The &quot;30 amp&quot; (TT-30), &quot;20 amp&quot; (NEMA 5-20), and &quot;15 amp&quot; (NEMA 5-15) connections may also be used, but offer progressively slower charging speeds. Outside of North America, 16 amp (caravan mains sockets) are common.

==RV parks by region==

===Australia===
In Australia there is generally no differentiation between an RV park and a trailer park. The term &quot;caravan park&quot; is used to refer to both. The term &quot;holiday park&quot; is becoming increasingly common, with many parks increasing their stock of on-site cabins, often accompanied by a reduction in the number of caravan sites, generally having higher quality facilities than the standard caravan park.

===Europe===
Caravan sites in Europe range in facilities depending on their age. Most new sites will be built to high environmentally friendly standards and have facilities compatible with the newest vehicles.

The Caravan Club has 1 million members in Europe with around 200 self-owned campsites and over 2,500 third party certificated locations, more commonly known as CL sites. The Camping and Caravanning Club is a non-profit organisation which has been running for over a century and has over 400,000 members and 100 campsites in the United Kingdom.
In France, Germany and Italy, to a lesser degree also in Norway and the Netherlands, a large network of dedicated stopover sites for motorhomes has grown since about 1980. These sites are called &quot;Reisemobil-Stellplatz&quot; in German or &quot;Aire de Camping-car&quot; in French. While these sites can usually not be compared to North American RV sites regarding size and facilities, they still fulfill the same purpose.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, motor camp, caravan park or holiday park are all terms typically used to describe overnight or long term vehicle-based camping. Along with powered sites for caravans, the parks usually offer tent sites and cabins, and a shared building with cooking facilities.

===North America===
RV parks range from rustic facilities with no or limited utility hookups, as often found in state/provincial parks and national parks, to luxury resorts with amenities that rival fine hotels. Some high-end resorts restrict the type of RV that can stay to motorhomes of a certain length or longer, and/or newer than a certain year.

Most RV parks are open to allcomers and rent spaces on a nightly or weekly basis, much like a motel or hotel. A few parks operate on a time-share basis. Membership campground networks like Thousand Trails operate like clubs, with members paying an initial membership fee and annual dues. There are over 13,000 privately owned RV parks and over 1,600 state parks that cater to RVers in the USA. Many of these RV parks offer WiFi hotspot access on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis; occasionally, WiFi is included in the campsite fee.

Most RV parks are independent or operated by a government entity. In the United States, Kampgrounds of America (KOA), is the largest and best-known chain of RV parks, with Yogi Bear&#x27;s Jellystone Park Camp Resorts a distant second. Good Sam Parks are mostly independently owned RV campgrounds endorsed by the Good Sam Club, a large association of US RVers that is operated for profit by the Affinity Group, Inc. Listings of RV parks can be found in printed directories; the best known are the annual ones by &quot;Woodall&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Trailer Life Magazine&quot;. Online and mobile app RV directories are provided by AmericaOnWheels.com, CampRate, Campendium, eCampGuide, MobileRVing.com, Reserve RV, RoverPass, RV Parks &amp; Campgrounds, RVParkReviews, RVThereYet, The Dyrt and others. Overnight rates for most USA RV parks are US$15 to US$50, although some in cities and country parks may be US$10 or less; even free.

There is a subculture of &quot;fulltiming&quot; RV owners who live in their recreational vehicles on a permanent basis. They typically move from one RV park to another. The length of time that someone is allowed to stay in an RV park varies from park to park.

<text>San Isidro, officially the Municipality of San Isidro (, Kapampangan: &quot;Balen ning San Isidro&quot;), is a municipality in the province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 54,372 people.

San Isidro became the capital of the Philippines during the First Philippine Republic while President Emilio Aguinaldo was moving north to avoid being captured by American forces.This municipality also has the first Highschool in the Philippines outside Manila

==History==
San Isidro, along with its origin Gapan, Aliaga, Cabiao, and San Antonio were parts of Pampanga until they were transferred to Nueva Ecija in 1848. It served as the capital of Nueva Ecija from 1852 to 1912. After the first cry against the Spanish colonial government was made in 1896, there were 2,000 revolutionary soldiers under General Mariano Llanera who sieged San Isidro.

On March 29, 1899, General Emilio Aguinaldo declared San Isidro as the capital of the Philippines after the revolutionary capital Malolos, Bulacan was captured by the Americans. However, this was short-lived. General Frederick Funston planned the capture of Aguinaldo to end the Philippine–American War, in San Isidro.

The Wright Institute, established in 1903 in San Isidro, was the first high school established outside Manila during the American period.

The town was occupied by Japanese troops in 1942, during World War II. The combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth ground forces liberated San Isidro and defeated the Japanese forces in 1945 during the end of the war.

===Contemporary period===
On September 11, 1989, Mayor Enrique Lorenzo was on his way back from Manila to San Isidro with his wife Aurora, their driver and one of their security personnel when they were ambushed by four gunmen along the Sta.

<text>The Project on Government Oversight (POGO) is a nonpartisan nonprofit government watchdog group based in Washington, D.C..

==History==
The Project on Military Procurement, an arm of the National Taxpayers Legal Fund, was founded by Dina Rasor in February 1981. The Project&#x27;s mission was to make the public aware of &#x27;waste, fraud, and fat&quot; in U.S. defense spending, according to Rasor. In the organization&#x27;s early days, Rasor worked with whistleblowers to expose design flaws in the M1 Abrams tank, which had undergone a &quot;shocking (cost) increase&quot; in 1980, according to Rasor. The Project first gained widespread attention in the early 1980s for publishing reports on &quot;outrageously overpriced military spending&quot;, including a $7,600 coffee maker and a $436 hammer.
These prices were actually an artifact of government accounting rules, and include not just the cost of the equipment but also a portion of the overhead cost of the entire project they were associated with.

The organization expanded its scope beyond military spending and changed its name to the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) in 1990. Danielle Brian joined POGO as its executive director in 1993.

Other watchdog organizations have folded into POGO over the years. In 2012, the Straus Military Reform Project of the Center for Defense Information joined POGO. In 2016, the Center for Effective Government (known as OMB Watch until 2013) folded and became part of POGO.

== Board of directors ==
The organization&#x27;s board of directors includes &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; editor Andrew Cockburn, law professor Lia Epperson, former judge Wallace B. Jefferson, lawyer Debra Katz, and political scientist Norman Ornstein.

==Activities==

=== Cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider ===
POGO contributed to the successful effort to cancel Department of Energy&#x27;s Superconducting Super Collider project, which had already lost a 1992 vote in the House of Representatives as its cost estimates ballooned from $4.4 billion to $12 billion. In June 1993, POGO publicized a Department of Energy Inspector General report it had received in draft form from a whistleblower. The Inspector General investigated $500,000 in questionable expenses over three years, including $12,000 for Christmas parties, $25,000 for catered lunches, and $21,000 for the purchase and maintenance of office plants. The report also concluded that there was inadequate documentation for $203 million in project spending, or 40% of the money spent up to that point.

=== Area 51 hazardous waste investigation ===
POGO reported that in 1995 it was contacted by a woman who claimed her husband had died as the result of being exposed to toxic waste while working at Area 51. At the time, the U.S. government denied the existence of the Area 51, but POGO turned to George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley to sue the government on behalf of the woman and six former Area 51 workers for illnesses and death as a result of toxic waste exposure at Area 51. POGO executive director Danielle Brian said that, during the litigation, the organization obtained an unclassified Area 51 security manual, which POGO gave to Turley and the plaintiffs so they could prove Area 51 existed. The Air Force then retroactively classified the manual, &quot;threatened to prosecute anyone who had it in their possession, and demanded access to all of POGO&#x27;s files to determine what other &#x27;classified&#x27; information POGO possessed,&quot; Brian wrote in a signed legal declaration. The court ruled that the plaintiffs&#x27; case could not be proved because it could not confirm the existence of Area 51, however Area 51 was thereafter required to comply with environmental laws. In 2013, the government confirmed that Area 51 exists.

=== Unpaid oil royalties investigation ===
POGO released a series of reports from 1995 to 1997 that said the U.S. federal government was owed billions of dollars in unpaid oil royalties from companies that drilled oil from public lands. The reports claimed that the Department of the Interior&#x27;s Mineral Management Service had a &quot;sweetheart&quot; relationship with oil companies that prevented the agency from going after the industry for moneys due.

=== Federal Contractor Misconduct Database ===
In 2002, POGO launched the Federal Contractor Misconduct Database, a website that compiles instances of &quot;misconduct and alleged misconduct&quot; by the top government contractors since 1995, according to the website. POGO&#x27;s database was the inspiration for a similar federal government database that was created by the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. When POGO updated its database in 2010, it was reported that the organization had &quot;found 642 instances since 1995 of misconduct by the top 100 firms, resulting in $18.7 billion in penalties.&quot;

=== Lawsuit against John Ashcroft ===
In 2004, POGO filed a lawsuit against then-U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft for illegally retroactively classifying documents critical of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The classification came to light after Sibel Edmonds, an FBI translator, discovered that intercepted memos relevant to the September 11 terrorist attacks had been ignored due to poor translation. POGO won the lawsuit in 2005.

=== Congressional Oversight Initiative ===
In 2006, POGO launched a series of nonpartisan trainings to teach congressional staff how to conduct oversight and investigations. Since then, POGO has hosted monthly training, as well as specialized training upon request, according to the organization&#x27;s website.

=== Ending the Royalty-In-Kind program ===
In 2008, POGO released a report that documented corruption and mismanagement in the Department of the Interior&#x27;s Minerals Management Service (MMS) royalty-in-kind program. The investigation revealed inadequate royalty accounting, as well as the provision of sex, drugs, and other favors to MMS officials by oil company representatives in exchange for favorable business deals. Following this report and others by the federal Government Accountability Office, the royalty in-kind program was terminated, and MMS was split into three different bureaus.

=== Kabul embassy investigation ===
In 2009, POGO conducted an investigation into ArmorGroup, a private security contractor in charge of protecting the U.S. embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. POGO uncovered and released documents, photos, and videos depicting drunken behavior, nudity, and hazing among the guards. POGO&#x27;s investigation led to the dismissal of several managers and eight guards, the resignation of an additional two guards, and ultimately, the cancellation of the U.S. military&#x27;s contract with ArmorGroup.

=== Nuclear facility safety investigations ===
POGO has conducted numerous investigations into the Los Alamos National Laboratory. LANL has been the subject of several controversies in the past, including employees charging personal expenses to government accounts, lost equipment or documents (including hundreds of computers containing classified information), and a memorandum to employees to &quot;be careful what they say&quot; to safety and security inspectors. In 2009, 69 computers disappeared, although plant officials insisted that the computers did not contain the most highly classified information. 2009 also saw a scare in which 2.2 pounds of missing plutonium prompted a Department of Energy investigation into the plant. The investigation found that the &quot;missing plutonium&quot; was a result of miscalculation by LANL&#x27;s statisticians and did not actually exist, but the investigation did lead to heavy criticism of the plant by the DOE for security flaws and weaknesses that the DOE claimed to have found.

=== FDA conflicts of interest investigation ===
Starting in 2011, POGO conducted an investigation into conflicts of interest of an advisory committee at the Food and Drug Administration that was reviewing the Yaz and Yasmin birth control pills. POGO found that four members of the committee had ties to either the maker of the pills or the maker of a generic version, but did not announce the conflicts before endorsing the drugs. Both Yaz and Yasmin have been linked to fatal blood clots in some users.

=== Advocacy for Camp Lejeune victims ===
In 2012, POGO working with whistleblower retired Marine Corps Master Sgt. Jerry Ensminger, advocated for openness regarding toxic water contamination at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. From 1953 until at least 1985, U.S. Marines and their families living at Camp Lejeune had used tap water that contained carcinogens and other harmful chemicals leaking from a nearby dump site for radioactive material. POGO and other organizations claimed in 2012 that the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps hid information about the nature and extent of the contamination, citing a report released by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry that was redacted by the Navy. Later that year, the U.S. Senate voted to approve healthcare for those who lived at Camp Lejeune and suffered health problems. In 2017, the Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs finalized rules to provide benefits for people who had been diagnosed with certain diseases as a result of living at Camp Lejeune.

=== Defense spending and Straus Military Reform Project ===
POGO has conducted many investigations into defense spending, particularly in cases where, &quot;national security and needs of the troops have been compromised by greed, lack of oversight, and in many cases, sheer incompetence,&quot; according to its website. Some of the weapons systems that POGO has been critical of include the littoral combat ship, the F/A-22 fighter aircraft, and the F-35 joint strike fighter aircraft. On the other hand, POGO has supported the production of the A-10 aircraft for its relative effectiveness and inexpensiveness compared to what POGO considers more wasteful weapons.

In 2012, the Straus Military Reform Project of the Center for Defense Information moved to POGO with director and military analyst Winslow Wheeler. Wheeler retired in 2015.

=== Whistleblower protection ===
POGO, along with several other public interest groups, was involved in the investigation and trial of Scott Bloch, ex-head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC). Bloch was accused by former OSC employees of ignoring and dismissing hundreds of whistleblower complaints, removing language guaranteeing protection against sexual orientation discrimination from OSC&#x27;s website and official documents, and &quot;relocating&quot; several of his own employees who came forward with these allegations. When these accusations led to a congressional investigation of Bloch, Bloch allegedly hired a technology company to wipe the memory of his computer and several other OSC laptops in order to hide key evidence from the investigators. Bloch initially claimed that he ordered this as protection against a virus that had infected his computer, but he later admitted he was trying to withhold information. Bloch ultimately resigned his position as head of the OSC and pleaded guilty to withholding information from Congress.

POGO has worked to protect the rights of several specific whistleblowers—including Franz Gayl, who criticized military leaders&#x27; decision to not deliver protective armored vehicles called MRAPs to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis, who challenged military leaders&#x27; depictions of the &quot;rosy&quot; situation on the ground in Afghanistan—by sending letters to Congress and the agencies involved.

== Whistleblower award incident ==
In 1998, POGO, the Department of Justice, and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit under the False Claims Act, suing the largest oil and gas companies operating in the United States. The lawsuit alleged that the companies had defrauded the government by underpaying royalties owed for drilling on federal lands. By 2002, 15 companies had settled, paying a total of almost $440 million. POGO was awarded about $1.2 million from the settlements in 1998. That year, POGO shared its settlement with two federal employee whistleblowers, saying the payment was a &quot;Public Service Award&quot; to the whistleblowers.

Following the news of the award in 1999, U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski asked the General Accounting Office to investigate whether the payment represented &quot;improper influence&quot; on the Department of the Interior&#x27;s new oil royalty valuation policy. The agency released a report in 2000 that said it appeared POGO paid the two employees to influence the Department of the Interior to take actions and make policies that benefited POGO. While calling the payments a &quot;mistake&quot; on POGO&#x27;s part, U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman disputed the agency&#x27;s report, saying that it did not provide any evidence that the payments were improper.

In 2000, U.S. Representative Don Young threatened bringing a Contempt of Congress charge against POGO, after the organization refused to comply with a House of Representatives subpoena for documents relating to the payments. Young later withdrew the charge, lacking the votes for passage. The report, hearings, and contempt threat were described by Martin Lobel, an attorney involved in the case, as being driven by &quot;oil company congressional lapdogs&quot; bent on hounding oil industry enemies and derailing regulatory reform.

In 2003, the Department of Justice filed a civil action against POGO and one of the federal employees, and a U.S. district judge ruled in favor of the agency. POGO appealed the case and went to trial in 2008, where a jury found POGO and the federal employee had violated the law. The judge ordered POGO to pay only $120,000 because he said the organization had acted &quot;in good faith&quot; when they made the payments. However, in 2010, the appeals court found the district judge had made a mistake in his directions to the jury. POGO and the agency went to trial again in 2012, but a mistrial was declared after jurors couldn&#x27;t come to a unanimous verdict. A month later, in 2013, the Department of Justice said it would not litigate on the matter for a third time.

==Publications==
In 2002, POGO, Government Accountability Project, and Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility co-published the book &quot;The Art of Anonymous Activism: Serving the Public while Surviving Public Service.&quot; It is described as a &quot;how-to guide&quot; for government employees who wish to expose corruption or misconduct in their organization without endangering their careers.

In 2009, POGO published &quot;The Art of Congressional Oversight: A User&#x27;s Guide to Doing It Right&quot;, which is a guide geared towards congressional staffers; an updated second edition was published in 2015.

== Awards ==
In 2009, POGO received the Society of Professional Journalists&#x27; Sunshine Award for its work uncovering wasteful spending in the Air Force, investigating the Minerals Management Service at the Department of the Interior, and compiling the Federal Contractor Misconduct Database.

In 2015, POGO received five awards from the Washington, DC, chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. POGO won the Non-breaking News Award for its coverage of issues at the Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs; two Investigative Reporting Awards for its coverage of the revolving door in government and problems at the Department of Justice; the Series award also for its coverage of the revolving door; and the Robert D.G. Lewis Watchdog Award also for its coverage of the Department of Justice.

<doc id="1263119" wikidata="Q78706" url="?curid=1263119" title="Manès Sperber">
<text>Manès Sperber (12 December 1905 – 5 February 1984) was an Austrian-French novelist, essayist and psychologist. He also wrote under the pseudonyms &quot;Jan Heger&quot; and &quot;N.A. Menlos&quot;.

==Early life==
Sperber was born on 12 December 1905 in Zabłotów near Kolomea, in the Austrian Galicia (today Zabolotiv, Ukraine). Sperber grew up in the shtetl of Zabłotów in a Hasidic family. He was the son of David Mechel Sperber and the older brother of Milo Sperber born 1911, who was to become an actor in Britain.

In the summer of 1916 the family fled from war to Vienna, where Sperber who, having lost faith, at 13 had refused to do his bar mitzvah, joined the Jewish Hashomer Hatzair youth movement. There he met Alfred Adler, the founder of individual psychology, and became a student and co-worker. Adler broke with him in 1932 because of differences in opinion about the connection of individual psychology and Marxism.

In 1927 Sperber had moved to Berlin and joined the Communist Party. He lectured at the &quot;Berliner Gesellschaft für Individualpsychologie&quot;, an institute for individual psychology in Berlin.

After Hitler had taken power Sperber was taken to jail, but was released after a few weeks on the grounds that he was an Austrian citizen. He emigrated first to Yugoslavia and then in 1934 to Paris where he worked for the Communist International with Willi Münzenberg. In 1938 he left the party because of the Stalinist purges within the party. In his writing he started to deal with totalitarianism and the role of the individual within society (&quot;Zur Analyse der Tyrannis&quot;).

In 1939 Sperber volunteered for the French Army. After the defeat, he took refuge in Cagnes, in the so-called &quot;zone libre&quot; (free zone) of France, and had to flee with his family to Switzerland in 1942, when the deportation of Jews started in that zone too.

==Career==
After the end of the war, in 1945, he returned to Paris, and worked as a writer and as a senior editor at the Calmann-Lévy publishing house.

Manès Sperber was the author of a novel trilogy: &quot;Like a Tear in the Ocean: A Trilogy&quot;, (1949–1955); of an autobiographical trilogy: &quot;All our Yesterdays&quot; (1974–1997), and numerous essays on philosophy, politics, literature, and psychology. Sperber received the Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels in 1983. In awarding the prize, the association described Sperber as a &quot;writer, who tracked the path of the ideological aberrations of the century, and freed himself from them entirely. Throughout his life he retained the independence of his own judgement, and incapable of indifference, summoned the courage, to get himself onto that non-existing bridge that only opens up in front of those who step out over the abyss.&quot; The German writer Siegfried Lenz gave the speech highlighting Sperber&#x27;s lifetime achievement.

One of his closest friends was the novelist Constantine Fitzgibbon, who translated much of his work into English.

==Personal life==
Manès Sperber is the father of Italian historian Vladimir Sperber and French anthropologist and cognitive scientist Dan Sperber. His first wife, Miriam Sperber, eventually emigrated to Champaign, Illinois, and became a counselor at the Psychological and Counseling Center there.

His younger brother Milo was an English actor. Milo spent the last years of his life travelling around Britain reading from his brother&#x27;s works.

==Death and legacy==
Manès Sperber died on 5 February 1984 in Paris. He was buried in the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris.

In 1988, the city of Vienna dedicated a park in the Leopoldstadt quarter to Sperber.

The Manès Sperber Prize for Literature (&quot;Manès-Sperber-Preis für Literatur&quot;) was established in 1985 by the Austrian Ministry of Art and Culture in honour of Sperber, with Siegfried Lenz winning the inaugural prize. it is worth 8000 euros.

<doc id="1263125" wikidata="Q982872" url="?curid=1263125" title="Femi Kuti">
<text>Olufela Olufemi Anikulapo Kuti (born 16 June 1962), popularly known as Femi Kuti, is a Nigerian musician born in London and raised in Lagos. He is the eldest son of Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti and a grandchild of political campaigner, women&#x27;s rights activist and traditional aristocrat Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti.

Femi Kuti began his musical career playing in his father&#x27;s band, Egypt 80. In 1986, Femi started his own band, Positive Force, establishing himself as an artist independent of his father&#x27;s legacy.

==Biography==
Femi Anikulapo Kuti was born in London to Fela and Remilekun (Remi) Ransome-Kuti (née Taylor; 1941-2000), and grew up in the former Nigerian capital, Lagos. His mother soon left his father, taking Femi to live with her. In 1977, however, Femi chose to move in with his father. Femi started playing the saxophone at the age of 15 and eventually became a member of his father&#x27;s band. He studied at Baptist Academy and Igbobi College.

Like his father, Femi has made commitments to social and political causes throughout his career. Femi&#x27;s grandmother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was a political campaigner and women&#x27;s rights activist. Though Femi is the son of an international icon, he considers his mother, Remilekun Taylor, to be his greatest influence.

He created his own band, Positive Force, in the late 1980s with Dele Sosimi (Gbedu Resurrection), former keyboard player of Fela Anikulapo Kuti. His international career began in 1988 when he was invited by the French Cultural Centre in Lagos and Christian Mousset to perform at the Festival d&#x27;Angoulême (France), the New Morning Club in Paris and the Moers Festival in Germany. In 2000, Kuti joined in a duet on the track &quot;Ala Jalkoum&quot; on the Rachid Taha album &quot;Made in Medina&quot;.

In 2001, Femi collaborated on his album &quot;Fight to Win&quot; with a number of US musicians, including Common, Mos Def, and Jaguar Wright.

Also in 2002, Femi contributed a remake of his father&#x27;s classic song &quot;Water No Get Enemy&quot; to &quot;Red Hot &amp; Riot&quot;, a compilation CD in tribute to Fela Kuti that was released by the Red Hot Organization and MCA. Femi&#x27;s track was created in collaboration with hip-hop and R&amp;B artists D&#x27;Angelo, Macy Gray, The Soultronics, Nile Rodgers and Roy Hargrove, and all proceeds from the CD were donated to charities dedicated to raising AIDS awareness or fighting the disease.

Femi Kuti&#x27;s voice is featured in the videogame &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, where he is the host of radio station IF 99 (International Funk 99, described as &quot;playing a great selection of classics from West Africa, the US and elsewhere&quot;).
In similar fashion as his father, there have been complaints of Kuti&#x27;s criticism of his homeland Nigeria, specifically in the song &quot;Sorry Sorry&quot;, along with &quot;What Will Tomorrow Bring&quot; and &quot;97&quot;.

Femi has been nominated for a Grammy award four times in the world music category in 2003, 2010, 2012 and 2013 but has never won.

On 19 December 2014 a management deal between Chocolate City Music Group and Femi Kuti was reached. The news was announced via the Chocolate City Music official Instagram account, as well as Audu Maikori social media accounts.

On 5 February 2021, Femi Kuti and his son, Made Kuti, released their two-album project, &quot;Legacy+&quot; under Partisan Records. The project includes Femi&#x27;s eleventh album &quot;Stop the Hate&quot; and Made&#x27;s debut album &quot;For(e)ward&quot;.

== Activism ==
Femi, the son of Afrobeat singer and political activist Fela Kuti, inherited his father&#x27;s zeal for both music and activism. He started playing the saxophone and keyboard with his father&#x27;s band when he was 16 and stepped into the spotlight, writing and singing after his father&#x27;s demise. Femi remains politically inclined grooving to high energy funk, jazz and traditional African-fueled songs about political corruption, poverty and primitive living conditions suffered by most inhabitants in Nigeria&#x27;s oil-rich nation.

Femi Kuti&#x27;s album &quot;Africa for Africa&quot; emphasized &quot;Bad Government&quot; as a problem in Africa. Before the 2011 elections in Nigeria, he reached out to the people that there was &quot;no difference between the three candidates contesting for the presidential seat in Nigeria&quot;. He added, &quot;we could say we&#x27;re moving in the democratic process. And it&#x27;s probably better than going to war, but corruption is still very rampant. The people are hungry and sick. And the government controls the media, so it can&#x27;t be critical&quot;.

Kuti also said: &quot;It&#x27;s a very hypocritical situation. People settle for putting a meal on the table, but they don&#x27;t know that the rest of the world doesn&#x27;t suffer every day from power outages and water shortage. Nigerians don&#x27;t even know about the history of African slavery, because it&#x27;s not included in the text books.&quot; He echoed the same sentiments in the 2015 elections by releasing a remix to the song &quot;Politics Na Big Business&quot; featuring Tuface Idiibia and Sound Sultan through his management company, Chocolate City.

Kuti&#x27;s song &quot;Make We Remember&quot; calls on people to remember the words of his father and &quot;great black people&quot;, who fought for the emancipation of Africa. For a very long time, Femi has been using music to inspire, change and motivate African people.

<doc id="1263142" wikidata="Q229153" url="?curid=1263142" title="Michelle Williams (singer)">
<text>Tenitra Michelle Williams (born July 23, 1979) is an American singer and actress. She rose to fame in the early 2000s as a member of R&amp;B girl group Destiny&#x27;s Child, one of the best-selling female groups of all time with over 100 million records, of which more than 60 million copies sold with the trio lineup that included Williams. During her time in the group she earned several accolades including a Grammy Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

During the group&#x27;s two-year hiatus, 2001–2003, Williams released her debut solo album &quot;Heart to Yours&quot; (2002) which topped the US gospel album chart and became the best-selling gospel release of the year. That same year, &quot;Billboard&quot; named Williams the fifth top-charting gospel artist of the year and she received a MOBO Award for &quot;Best Gospel Act&quot;. Following this, she released her second solo album &quot;Do You Know&quot; (2004). After Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s disbandment in 2006, Williams released her first pop album, &quot;Unexpected&quot; (2008), which spawned the singles &quot;We Break the Dawn&quot; and the US Dance number-one &quot;The Greatest&quot;. Her fourth studio album, &quot;Journey to Freedom&quot; (2014), received positive reviews and became her highest-charting album in the US; it includes the singles &quot;If We Had Your Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Say Yes&quot; which topped the US Hot Gospel Songs chart for seven weeks, and won the Stellar Award for Music Video of the Year.

Williams has also ventured into acting, appearing in television, Broadway, and West End theatre productions. Making her acting debut on Broadway in &quot;Aida&quot; (2003), she has since starred in the sitcom series &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot; (2006) and the musical productions &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (2007), &quot;Chicago&quot; (2009–10), &quot;What My Husband Doesn&#x27;t Know&quot; (2011) &quot;Fela!&quot; (2013) and the original Broadway production of &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (2024). In addition, she received a nomination for &quot;Best Lead Female – Equity&quot; in 2008 at the 18th Annual NAACP Theatre Awards. Williams was a featured judge on &quot;MTV&#x27;s Top Pop Group&quot;, a contestant on season 8 of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in the United Kingdom, and has also appeared on the American, British, and Australian versions of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;.

==Early life==
Tenitra Michelle Williams was born in Rockford, Illinois, on July 23, 1979, to Anita Williams (née Washington) and Dennis Williams III (1952–2020). She has three siblings: elder brother Erron, who is a musician, elder sister Cameron, and younger sister Danielle. Williams made her musical debut at the age of seven, performing a rendition of the hymn &quot;Blessed Assurance&quot; at the St. Paul Church of God in Christ. She later sang in the gospel groups United Harmony and Chosen Expression.

Williams graduated from Rockford Auburn High School in 1997. Shortly after graduating, she pursued a degree in criminal justice at Illinois State University, doubtful of her ability to make a career as a professional singer. After two years of college, she left to pursue a music career, as a backing vocalist for other artists such as Monica.

==Career==

===1999–2003: Breakthrough with Destiny&#x27;s Child, &quot;Heart to Yours&quot; and &quot;Aida&quot;===

In late 1999, 20-year-old Williams met Destiny&#x27;s Child band members Beyoncé Knowles and Kelly Rowland in the lobby of an Atlanta hotel. Several months later, a choreographer acquaintance of Williams who knew the group, connected Williams to the Knowles family and Rowland, as they were vetting potential new group members. After the much-publicized turmoil, Williams, alongside Farrah Franklin, officially joined the group in early 2000, replacing LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson without notice. Buoyed by the group&#x27;s breakout success, Luckett and Roberson had both attempted to split with the group&#x27;s manager Mathew Knowles in late 1999, claiming that he kept a disproportionate share of the band&#x27;s profits and unfairly favored Knowles and Rowland.

The issue was heightened after Williams and Franklin appeared in the video of &quot;Say My Name&quot;, implying that the original band members were already replaced. Franklin, however, faded from the group after five months, as evidenced by her absences during promotional appearances and concerts. Franklin attributed her departure to negative vibes in the group resulting from the strife. After settling on this final lineup, the trio released &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. It became their best-charting single yet, topping the official US singles chart for eleven consecutive weeks. The success cemented the new lineup and skyrocketed them to fame.

In May 2001, Destiny&#x27;s Child released the group&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Survivor&quot;. It debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of 663,000 copies. &quot;Survivor&quot; has sold over twelve million copies worldwide, 4.1 million of which were sold in the US alone. The album&#x27;s other number-one hits are &quot;Bootylicious&quot; and the title track &quot;Survivor&quot;, the latter earning the group a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. In October 2001, Destiny&#x27;s Child released their holiday album, &quot;8 Days of Christmas&quot;. Before releasing the 2002 compilation album, &quot;This Is the Remix&quot;, the group announced their temporary break-up to pursue solo projects.

While Williams was still with Destiny&#x27;s Child, she intensified work on her debut solo album &quot;Heart to Yours&quot;. The album material included collaborations with singers Carl Thomas, Shirley Caesar and the Mary Mary duo, taking the singer&#x27;s work further into urban contemporary gospel and Christian music. &quot;Some people will do gospel when their career fails, but I chose to do it at the height of the popularity of Destiny&#x27;s Child&quot;, Williams explained during the album&#x27;s release. &quot;And I didn&#x27;t want to do it because it was a fad. I wanted to do it because it&#x27;s in me. It&#x27;s in my heart.&quot; Released on April 16, 2002, in North America to much critical acclaim, Williams became the first member of Destiny&#x27;s Child to release solo material with &quot;Heart to Yours&quot;. The album sold 20,000 copies in its first week, placing it at number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Gospel Albums chart, where it later rose to number one.

It became the year&#x27;s best-selling gospel album, selling more than 220,000 units in the US, as of 2008. A music video for the album&#x27;s single, &quot;Heard a Word&quot;, was produced by film director Sylvain White. &quot;Heart to Yours&quot; won Williams a MOBO Award for &quot;Best Gospel Act&quot; along with a raft of nominations including a Stellar Award nomination for &quot;New Artist of the Year&quot;, a GMWA Excellence Award nomination for &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year Urban Contemporary&quot; and a GMA Dove Award nomination for &quot;Traditional Gospel Recorded Song of the Year&quot; for her collaboration with Shirley Caesar on &quot;Steal Away To Jesus&quot; which was first featured on Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Hymns&quot; album. &quot;Billboard&quot; listed Williams as the fifth Top Gospel Artist of 2002.

In August 2002, Williams embarked on her first tour as a solo artist in promotion of her debut album. Sponsored by Burger King, the 19-date BK Got Music Summer Soul Tour also featured Luther Vandross, Angie Stone and Gerald Levert. Following the release and promotion of &quot;Heart to Yours&quot;, Williams made her on-stage acting debut in 2003, replacing fellow singer Toni Braxton in the title role of &quot;Aida&quot;, the hit Broadway musical with music by Elton John and lyrics by Tim Rice. She was the first and remains the only Destiny&#x27;s Child member to have acted on Broadway.

===2004–2007: Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s final projects, &quot;Do You Know&quot; and acting debut===
During the release of her fellow Destiny&#x27;s Child members&#x27; debut albums, Williams spent time in the studio, recording her second album. The album saw her generally re-teaming with the majority of the producers and songwriters from her previous effort, including Solange Knowles, Dawkins &amp; Dawkins, and brother Erron Williams. Released in January 2004 in the United States, &quot;Do You Know&quot; reached number 120 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, despite a warm reception from critics who lent praise to Williams&#x27; songwriting ability. Once again, Williams scored more success on the component charts, where the album debuted at number two on the Top Gospel Albums chart and number three on the top Christian Albums tally. The album was later re-released, including previously unreleased songs and has sold 78,000 copies in the US, as of March 2008.

After a three-year hiatus, Destiny&#x27;s Child reunited for &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot;, released in November 2004. The album hit number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and spawned the singles &quot;Lose My Breath&quot;, &quot;Soldier&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot; and &quot;Cater 2 U&quot;. In support of the album, Destiny&#x27;s Child embarked on a 2005 &quot;Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin&#x27; It&quot; world tour, which started in April to September of the same year. On the Barcelona, Spain visit, the group announced their disbandment after their final North American leg would end. In October 2005, the group released a greatest hits compilation album, titled &quot;#1&#x27;s&quot;, including their most successful singles alongside three new tracks, including the band&#x27;s final single &quot;Stand Up for Love&quot;, penned by David Foster. Destiny&#x27;s Child was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in March 2006. They were recognized as the world&#x27;s best-selling female group of all time.

Following Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s disbandment in early 2006, Williams made her television debut in the UPN comedy &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot;, where she played the role of Naomi, a record company executive who is HIV positive. Later that year, she appeared as one of the celebrity singers on the FOX reality television show &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;, duetting with actors Alfonso Ribeiro and Jai Rodriguez. In April 2006, Williams performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s event WrestleMania 22, which was in her hometown of Chicago. Beginning in April 2007, Williams joined Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Chicago-based cast of the hit Broadway musical &quot;The Color Purple&quot; for its national tour, starting with an extended run at the Cadillac Palace Theatre. Williams described the opportunity as &quot;a dream come true&quot;, playing the part of blues singer Shug Avery, which earned her positive reception.

===2008–2010: &quot;Unexpected&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot; and label troubles===

In March 2008, Williams announced the release of her third studio album &quot;Unexpected&quot; in October 2008. A breakaway from the gospel music on her first two solo albums to secular pop/R&amp;B, the album, her first release since the disbanding of Destiny&#x27;s Child, involves production by Stargate, Rico Love, Wayne Wilkins, and Soulshock and Karlin, among others. In June 2008, Williams released lead single &quot;We Break the Dawn&quot; to universal acclaim from critics who hailed it as &quot;a terrific fusion of European disco and American R&amp;B&quot;. The song became her most successful single yet, peaking at number four on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart, topping the US Hot Dance Airplay chart and reaching the top 50 in the UK and top 40 in Hungary — where it also placed on the 2009 year-end chart.

In September 2008, &quot;The Greatest&quot; was issued as the second single release to mainstream radio, while &quot;Hello Heartbreak&quot; was catered to dance clubs. &quot;The Greatest&quot; became Williams&#x27; second hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance charts when it peaked at number-one the US Hot Dance Club Songs. Gaining favorable reviews from critics, in October 2008 &quot;Unexpected&quot; debuted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart at number 42 and number 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with first week sales of 14,618 units. The album charted internationally, in the UK and Japan.

In July 2009, Williams began a limited six-week engagement at the Cambridge Theatre in &quot;Chicago&quot;, making her the first African-American to be cast in the West End production of the musical. Her run was extended and Williams continued appearing for three additional weeks for an extended engagement starting August 23 through September 12. In January 2010, Michelle parted ways with her manager Mathew Knowles and Music World Entertainment. In February 2010, Williams made a return to Broadway by commencing a seven-week limited engagement in &quot;Chicago&quot; at the Ambassador Theatre, replacing Ashlee Simpson. In April, it was announced that Williams would extend her limited engagement in &quot;Chicago&quot;.

In August 2010, it was reported that Williams would be participating on season 8 of the British television dance competition show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, the originator of the global &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; franchise. On the launch show, it was revealed that Williams had been paired with Brendan Cole. They remained in the competition for seven weeks with variable results; on October 23, Ian Waite stood in as her professional partner when Brendan was unable to do so. Williams was eliminated on November 14. In December 2010, Williams joined DJ Martin Jay to become a co-host on Choice FM&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Show&quot; in London for the month, replacing Lucy Ambache who was on maternity leave. On December 15, Williams released the song &quot;Stay for a Minute&quot;, a leftover from &quot;Unexpected&quot; for free digital download via Twitter to celebrate gaining over 100,000 followers.

===2011–2014: Acting, label change and &quot;Journey to Freedom&quot;===

In January 2011, Williams appeared on BBC&#x27;s popular comedy panel game show &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. In February 2011, Williams began a 28-city tour starring in the David E. Talbert stage-play &quot;What My Husband Doesn&#x27;t Know&quot; along with Brian J. White, Ann Nesby and Clifton Davis, playing the lead role of Lena Summer. In July 2011, Williams released a buzz single titled &quot;Love Gun&quot;, to precede the release of her upcoming fourth solo album, on which she had begun work in 2010. In August, Electronic Giant Beatz released a press release, cover art and a music video teaser for a song featuring Williams titled &quot;On the Run&quot;. The song was released in the United Kingdom in November 2011.

In November 2020, Williams announced her memoir, &quot;Checking In: How Getting Real About Depression Saved My Life–and Can Save Yours&quot;, which was released in May 2021. The accompanying podcast, &quot;Checking In with Michelle Williams&quot;, premiered on streaming services in December 2020, and was nomintated at the 53rd NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Lifestyle/Self-Help Podcast.

She continued the role in the Broadway production which started on October 23.

==Artistry==
===Voice===

Williams can be identified as a soprano. William Ruhlmann of &quot;AllMusic&quot; commented that she has a &quot;warm, kittenish voice&quot; with the ability to &quot;transform&quot; from &quot;kitten to tiger&quot;, belting &quot;with absolute conviction&quot;. &quot;GospelMusicCity.com&quot; praised her &quot;delicate vocals&quot; and described her &quot;sopralto stylings&quot; as &quot;inimitable&quot;, writing that on &quot;Heard a Word&quot; she &quot;demonstrates further versatility in Ella-like fashion&quot;.

Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; compared her to other singers, writing &quot;Williams&#x27;s warm vocal recalls both the playful wisps of her R&amp;B contemporaries (Jill Scott, Erykah Badu) and the breathy timbre of Diana Ross&quot;. Emily Sogn of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote &quot;Williams singing style is pleasingly slow paced...that owes a lot to her pop contemporaries like Ashanti and Janet Jackson.&quot; Mike Rimmer of &quot;Cross Rhythms&quot; described her voice as &quot;soulful&quot;. Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;Williams&#x27;s strength is a shimmery jazz lilt&quot;.

==Honors and awards==

Williams has earned an array of awards and honors as a solo artist and a member of Destiny&#x27;s Child. These include: one Grammy Award and one MOBO Award. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Williams as the fifth Top Gospel Artist of 2002 due to the success of her debut release &quot;Heart to Yours&quot; which was one of the best-selling gospel releases of the year. In 2013, Williams was honored in her hometown of Rockford, Illinois at the 2013 &quot;I Love Gospel Music&quot; honors luncheon, which featured musical tributes, including one by &quot;Sunday Best&quot; winner Amber Bullock.

==Personal life==
Williams reportedly began dating pastor and professional sports chaplain Chad Johnson in July 2017. Williams and Johnson announced their engagement via &quot;People&quot; on April 19, 2018. In September 2018, the couple revealed plans to film a television series, showcasing their relationship as they navigate the road from engagement to marriage. On November 3, 2018, the reality show &quot;Chad Loves Michelle&quot; began airing on the Oprah Winfrey Network. In December 2018, Williams announced that she and Johnson had both called off their engagement.

===Mental health===
Williams has a history of depression, saying that she has &quot;been suffering since the ages of 13 and 15&quot;. During her time with Destiny&#x27;s Child, she says that she told their then manager Mathew Knowles about her feelings, but that he did not really understand. He replied to her concerns by trying to point out the good side of their new-found fame, &quot;You all just signed a multi-millionaire dollar deal, you&#x27;re about to go on tour, what have you got to be depressed about?&quot;

She said that she had difficulty understanding her own feelings until later in life, around her thirties, stating that &quot;I didn&#x27;t know until I was in my 30s what was going on, I just thought it was growing pains, I just thought I&#x27;m turning into a woman.&quot; She also felt that Knowles intended no malice, and only had her best interests at heart, &quot;Bless his heart... I think he wanted me to be grateful, which I was, but I was still sad.&quot;

Williams again felt helpless after she and her fiancé, Chad Johnson, split up in late 2018. She said the breakup left her &quot;shattered and ... fighting suicidal thoughts.&quot; She said that she felt &quot;so angry. The rage built up in me. I did not attempt suicide, but I was questioning [life]&quot;. Williams suffered a nervous breakdown just after opening day for a Broadway production of &quot;Once on This Island&quot; and was advised to leave the show by her doctor. By April 2020 she had returned to better health, saying that &quot;I am in a better place now. I am not perfect. I&#x27;m not preaching ... When people say it gets better, it does. It just takes time. The days do get brighter&quot;.

====Memoir====
In November 2020, Williams announced plans to release a memoir &quot;revealing her entire truth including a deeper dive into where her anxiety and depression came from.&quot; She stated, &quot;I&#x27;m ready to share, I&#x27;ve been a very transparent person and now I&#x27;m ready to share the good, bad, and ugly parts of my journey—the concerning part of my journey. ... I really go into the specifics, I really go into the first time I was diagnosed, I go into assessing the first time I had anxiety in a romantic relationship and what it did to that relationship and then subsequently what it did to the next one.&quot; Williams said she hoped to &quot;really help heal through my story&quot; and &quot;let people know what I do on a daily, what I do on a monthly–whatever it takes to get people whole and get people where they can maybe start seeing some better results in their own life.&quot;

The book titled &quot;Checking In: How Getting Real about Depression Saved My Life—and Can Save Yours&quot; was published on May 25, 2021.

==Philanthropy==
In 2001, Williams made a &quot;bountiful&quot; donation of $148,900 to her church, St. Paul Church of God in Christ in Rockford, Illinois – of which she has been a member since birth – to finish construction of the church&#x27;s school, St. Paul Academy. The church is pastored by her uncle, Bishop James E. Washington.

In 2005, music producer David Foster, his daughter Amy Foster-Gillies, and Knowles wrote &quot;Stand Up for Love&quot;, which would serve as the anthem of World Children&#x27;s Day, an event which takes place annually around the world on November 20 to raise awareness and funds for children&#x27;s causes worldwide. Destiny&#x27;s Child lent their voices and support as global ambassadors for the 2005 World Children&#x27;s Day program. In this role, Knowles, Rowland and Williams visited Ronald McDonald Houses around the world during their &quot;Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin&#x27; It&quot; World Tour and donated a portion of their North American ticket sales to Ronald McDonald House Charities.

In September 2006, Williams jump-started the Chicago PepsiCo S.M.A.R.T. – which stands for five simple steps that encourage active living and better food choices – program to promote active, healthy lifestyles by building a new &quot;Smart Spot&quot; playground in Chicago. Williams, along with friend Lance Bass, was on hand to sing to and greet kids at the opening of Camp Heartland, a camp dedicated to helping kids suffering from HIV/AIDS enjoy life and take their mind off their illness. In 2006, the Chicago Sky, a team in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association, announced that Williams, along with Mathew Knowles, is part of a group of minority shareholder owners in the team.

In 2012, she became an ambassador for the American Heart Association&#x27;s &quot;Power to End Stroke&quot; campaign. In speaking of her role she said &quot;I am honored to partner with the campaign ... my father had a stroke in 2005 due to smoking, diabetes and an unhealthy diet, and my grandmother was diagnosed with having a stroke in 2006 when she went to her doctor for a simple outpatient procedure. I am bringing awareness to people so that strokes can be prevented. Let&#x27;s take care of ourselves...the first step is knowledge about your health.&quot;

In 2014, Williams partnered with Hyundai&#x27;s non-profit organization, Hope on Wheels, &quot;committed to finding a cure for childhood cancer&quot;; which has raised over $74,000,000 for the cause since its inception in 1998.

<doc id="1263147" wikidata="Q250858" url="?curid=1263147" title="Pluricentric language">
<text>A pluricentric language or polycentric language is a language with several codified standard forms, often corresponding to different countries. Many examples of such languages can be found worldwide among the most-spoken languages, including but not limited to Chinese in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Taiwan and Singapore; English in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, India, and elsewhere; and French in France, Canada, and elsewhere. The converse case is a monocentric language, which has only one formally standardized version. Examples include Japanese and Russian.
In some cases, the different standards of a pluricentric language may be elaborated to appear as separate languages, e.g. Malaysian and Indonesian, Hindi and Urdu, while Serbo-Croatian is in an earlier stage of that process.

== Examples of varying degrees of pluricentrism ==
=== Arabic ===

Pre-Islamic Arabic can be considered a polycentric language. In Arabic-speaking countries different levels of polycentricity can be detected. Modern Arabic is a pluricentric language with varying branches correlating with different regions where Arabic is spoken and the type of communities speaking it. The vernacular varieties of Arabic include:
*Peninsular Arabic
**Hejazi Arabic (urban cities of western Saudi Arabia)

=== Armenian ===

The Armenian language is a pluricentric language with two standard varieties, Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian, which have developed as separate literary languages since the eighteenth century. Prior to this, almost all Armenian literature was written in Classical Armenian, which is now solely used as a liturgical language. Eastern and Western Armenian can also refer to the two major dialectal blocks into which the various non-standard dialects of Armenian are categorized. Eastern Armenian is the official language of the Republic of Armenia. It is also spoken, with dialectal variations, by Iranian Armenians, Armenians in Karabakh (see Karabakh dialect), and in the Armenian diaspora, especially in the former Soviet Union (Russia, Georgia, Ukraine). Western Armenian is spoken mainly in the Armenian diaspora, especially in the Middle East, France, the US, and Canada.

Additionally, Armenian is written in two standard orthographies: classical and reformed Armenian orthography. The former is used by practically all speakers of Western Armenian and by Armenians in Iran, while the latter, which was developed in Soviet Armenia in the 20th century, is used in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.

=== Catalan ===
In the modern era, Catalan is a pluricentric language with differences in pronunciation and vocabulary. This language is internationally known as Catalan, as in Ethnologue. This is also the most commonly used name in Catalonia, but also in Andorra and the Balearic Islands, probably due to the prestige of the Central Catalan dialect spoken in and around Barcelona. However, in the Valencian Community, the official name of this language is Valencian. One reason for this is political (see Serbo-Croatian for a similar situation), but this variant does have its own literary tradition that dates back to the Reconquista.

Although mutually intelligible with other varieties of Catalan, Valencian has lexical peculiarities and its own spelling rules, which are set out by the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua, created in 1998. However, this institution recognizes that Catalan and Valencian are varieties of the same language. For their part, there are specific varieties in the two major Balearic islands, Mallorcan () in Mallorca, Menorcan (&quot;menorquí&quot;) in Menorca, Ibizan (&quot;eivissenc&quot;) in Ibiza. The University of the Balearic Islands is the language regulator for these varieties.

=== Chinese ===

Until the mid-20th century, most Chinese people spoke only their local varieties of Chinese.
These varieties had diverged widely from the written form used by scholars, Literary Chinese, which was modelled on the language of the Chinese classics.
As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on northern varieties, known as &quot;Guānhuà&quot; (官話, literally &quot;speech of officials&quot;), known as &quot;Mandarin&quot; in English after the officials.
Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.

In the early years of the 20th century, Literary Chinese was replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects.
In the 1930s, a standard national language &quot;Guóyǔ&quot; (國語, literally &quot;national language&quot;) was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other northern varieties.
After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the standard was known as &quot;Pǔtōnghuà&quot; (普通话/普通話, literally &quot;common speech&quot;), but was defined in the same way as &quot;Guóyǔ&quot; in the Republic of China now governing Taiwan. It also became one of the official languages of Singapore, under the name &quot;Huáyǔ&quot; (华语/華語, literally &quot;Chinese language&quot;).

Although the three standards remain close, they have diverged to some extent. Most Mandarin speakers in Taiwan and Singapore came from the southeast coast of China, where the local dialects lack the retroflex initials /tʂ tʂʰ ʂ/ found in northern dialects, so that many speakers in those places do not distinguish them from the apical sibilants /ts tsʰ s/. Similarly, retroflex codas (&quot;erhua&quot;) are typically avoided in Taiwan and Singapore. There are also differences in vocabulary, with Taiwanese Mandarin absorbing loanwords from Min Chinese, Hakka Chinese, and Japanese, and Singaporean Mandarin borrowing words from English, Malay, and southern varieties of Chinese.

=== Eastern South Slavic (Bulgarian–Macedonian–Torlakian (Gorani)–Paulician (Banat)) ===

Some linguists and scholars, mostly from Bulgaria and Greece, but some also from other countries, consider Eastern South Slavic to be a pluricentric language with four standards: Bulgarian (based on the Rup, Balkan and Moesian (&quot;Eastern Bulgarian&quot;) dialects), Macedonian (based on the Western and Central Macedonian dialects), Gorani (based on the Torlakian dialects), and Paulician (including Banat Bulgarian). Politicians and nationalists from Bulgaria are likely to refer to this entire grouping as &#x27;Bulgarian&#x27;, and to be particularly hostile to the notion that Macedonian is an autonomous language separate from Bulgarian, which Macedonian politicians and citizens tend to claim. As of 2021, the hypothesis that Eastern South Slavic, &#x27;Greater Bulgarian&#x27;, &#x27;Bulgaro-Macedonian&#x27;, or simply &#x27;Bulgarian&#x27;, is a pluricentric language with several mutually intelligible official standards in the same way that Serbo-Croatian is, and Czechoslovak used to be, has not yet been fully developed in linguistics; it is a popular idea in Bulgarian politics, but an unpopular one in North Macedonia.

=== English ===

English is a pluricentric language, with differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, spelling, etc., between each of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom, North America, the Caribbean, Ireland, English-speaking African countries, Singapore, India, and Oceania. Educated native English speakers using their version of one of the standard forms of English are almost completely mutually intelligible, but non-standard forms present significant dialectal variations, and are marked by reduced intelligibility.

British and American English are the two most commonly taught varieties in the education systems where English is taught as a second language. British English tends to predominate in Europe and the former British colonies of the West Indies, Africa, and Asia, where English is not the first language of the majority of the population. (The Falkland Islands, a British territory off the southeast coast of South America with English as its native language, have their own dialect, while British English is the standard.) In contrast, American English tends to dominate instruction in Latin America and East Asia (In Latin America, British English is taught in schools with British curriculum in countries with descendants of British settlers.)

Due to globalization and the resulting spread of the language in recent decades, English is becoming increasingly decentralized, with daily use and statewide study of the language in schools growing in most regions of the world. However, in the global context, the number of native speakers of English is much smaller than the number of non-native speakers of English of reasonable competence. In 2018, it was estimated that for every native speaker of English, there are six non-native speakers of reasonable competence, raising the questions of English as a lingua franca as the most widely spoken form of the language.

Philippine English (which is predominantly spoken as a second language) has been primarily influenced by American English. The rise of the call center industry in the Philippines has encouraged some Filipinos to &quot;polish&quot; or neutralize their accents to make them more closely resemble the accents of their client countries.

Countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada have their own well-established varieties of English which are the standard within those countries but are far more rarely taught overseas to second language learners. (Standard English in Australia and New Zealand is related to British English in its common pronunciation and vocabulary; a similar relationship exists between Canadian English and American English.)

English was historically pluricentric when it was used across the independent kingdoms of England and Scotland prior to the Acts of Union in 1707. English English and Scottish English are now subsections of British English.

=== French ===
In the modern era, there are several major loci of the French language, including Standard French (also known as Parisian French), Canadian French (including Quebec French and Acadian French), Belgian French, American French (for instance, Louisiana French), Haitian French, and African French.

Until the early 20th century, the French language was highly variable in pronunciation and vocabulary within France, with varying dialects and degrees of intelligibility, the langues d&#x27;oïl. However, government policy made it so that the dialect of Paris would be the method of instruction in schools, and other dialects, like Norman, which has influence from Scandinavian languages, were neglected. Controversy still remains in France over the fact that the government recognizes them as languages of France, but provides no monetary support for them nor has the Constitutional Council of France ratified the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

North American French is the result of French colonization of the New World between the 17th and 18th centuries. In many cases, it contains vocabulary and dialectal quirks not found in Standard Parisian French owing to history: most of the original settlers of Quebec, Acadia, and later what would become Louisiana and northern New England came from Northern and Northwest France, and would have spoken dialects like Norman, Poitevin, and Angevin with far fewer speaking the dialect of Paris. This, plus isolation from developments in France, most notably the drive for standardization by L&#x27;Académie française, make North American dialects of the language quite distinct. Acadian French, spoken in New Brunswick, Canada, has many words no longer used in modern France, much of it having roots in the 17th century, and a distinct intonation. Québécois, the largest of the dialects, has a distinct pronunciation that is not found in Europe in any measure and a greater difference in vowel pronunciation, and syntax tends to vary greatly. Cajun French has some distinctions not found in Canada in that there is more vocabulary derived from both local Native American and African dialects and a pronunciation of the letter r that has disappeared in France entirely. It is rolled, and with heavier contact with the English language than any of the above the pronunciation has shifted to harder sounding consonants in the 20th century. Cajun French equally has been an oral language for generations and it is only recently that its syntax and features been adapted to French orthography.

Minor standards can also be found in Belgium and Switzerland, with particular influence of Germanic languages on grammar and vocabulary, sometimes through the influence of local dialects. In Belgium, for example, various Germanic influences in spoken French are evident in Wallonia (for example, to &quot;blink&quot; in English, and &quot;blinken&quot; in German and Dutch, &quot;blinquer&quot; in Walloon and local French, &quot;cligner&quot; in standard French). &quot;Ring&quot; (&quot;rocade&quot; or &quot;périphérique&quot; in standard French) is a common word in the three national languages for beltway or ring road. Also, in Belgium and Switzerland, there are noted differences in the number system when compared to standard Parisian or Canadian French, notably in the use of &quot;septante&quot;, &quot;octante/huitante&quot; and &quot;nonante&quot; for the numbers 70, 80 and 90. In other standards of French, these numbers are usually denoted &quot;soixante-dix&quot; (sixty-ten), &quot;quatre-vingts&quot; (fourscore) and &quot;quatre-vingt-dix&quot; (fourscore-and-ten).
French varieties spoken in Oceania are also influenced by local languages. New Caledonian French is influenced by Kanak languages in its vocabulary and grammatical structure.
African French is another variety.

=== German ===

Standard German is often considered an asymmetric pluricentric language; the standard used in Germany is often considered dominant, mostly because of the sheer number of its speakers, compared to the Austrian Standard German and Swiss Standard German varieties. Although there is a uniform stage pronunciation based on a manual by Theodor Siebs that is used in theatres, and, nowadays to a lesser extent, in radio and television news all across German-speaking countries, this is not true for the standards applied at public occasions in Austria, South Tyrol and Switzerland, which differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, and sometimes even grammar. (In Switzerland, the letter ß has been removed from the alphabet, with &quot;ss&quot; as its replacement.) The varieties of Standard German used in those regions are to some degree influenced by the respective dialects (but by no means identical to them), by specific cultural traditions (e.g. in culinary vocabulary, which differs markedly across the German-speaking area of Europe), and by different terminology employed in law and administration. A list of Austrian terms for certain food items has even been incorporated into EU law, even though it is clearly incomplete. Scholarly scepticism in German dialectology about the pluricentric status of German has led some linguists to detect a One Standard German Axiom (OSGA) as active in the field.

=== Hindustani ===
The Hindi languages are a large dialect continuum defined as a unit culturally. Medieval Hindustani (then known as &quot;Hindavi&quot;) was based on a register of the Delhi dialect and has two modern literary forms, Standard Hindi and Standard Urdu. Additionally, there are historical literary standards, such as the closely related Braj Bhasha and the more distant Awadhi, as well as recently established standard languages based on what were once considered Hindi dialects: Maithili and Dogri. Other varieties, such as Rajasthani, are often considered distinct languages but have no standard form. Caribbean Hindi and Fijian Hindi also differ significantly from the Sanskritized standard Hindi spoken in India.

=== Malay ===

The Malay language has many local dialects and creolized versions, but it has two main normative varieties which are Malaysian and Indonesian: Indonesian is codified by Indonesia as its own &quot;lingua franca&quot; based on the dialect spoken in Riau Islands, whereas Malaysia codifies Malaysian based on the vernacular dialect of Johor. Thus, both lects have the same dialectal basis, and linguistic sources still tend to treat the standards as different forms of a single language. In popular parlance, however, the two varieties are often thought of as distinct tongues in their own rights due to the growing divergence between them and for political reasons. Nevertheless, they retain a high degree of mutual intelligibility despite a number of differences in vocabulary (including many false friends) and grammar.

=== Malayalam ===
Malayalam is a pluricentric language with historically more than one written form. Malayalam script is officially recognized, but there are other standardized varieties such as Arabi Malayalam of Mappila Muslims, Karshoni of Saint Thomas Christians and Judeo-Malayalam of Cochin Jews.

=== Persian ===
The Persian language has three standard varieties with official status in Iran (locally known as Farsi), Afghanistan (officially known as Dari), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajik). The standard forms of the three are based on the Tehrani, Kabuli, and Dushanbe varieties, respectively.

The Persian alphabet is used for both Farsi (Iranian) and Dari (Afghan). Traditionally, Tajiki is also written with Perso-Arabic script. In order to increase literacy, a Latin alphabet (based on the Common Turkic Alphabet) was introduced in 1917. Later in the late 1930s, the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic promoted the use of Cyrillic alphabet, which remains the most widely used system today. Attempts to reintroduce the Perso-Arabic script were made.

The language spoken by Bukharan Jews is called Bukhori (or Bukharian), and is written in Hebrew alphabet.

=== Portuguese ===
Apart from the Galician question, Portuguese varies mainly between Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese (also known as &quot;Lusitanian Portuguese&quot;, &quot;Standard Portuguese&quot; or even &quot;Portuguese Portuguese&quot;). Both varieties have undergone significant and divergent developments in phonology and the grammar of their pronominal systems. The result is that communication between the two varieties of the language without previous exposure can be occasionally difficult, although speakers of European Portuguese tend to understand Brazilian Portuguese better than vice versa, due to the heavy exposure to music, soap operas etc. from Brazil. Word ordering can be dramatically different between European and Brazilian Portuguese, without significantly hampering mutual intelligibility.

A unified orthography for all the varieties (including a limited number of words with dual spelling) has been approved by the national legislatures of the Portuguese-speaking countries and is now official; see Spelling reforms of Portuguese for additional details. Formal written standards remain grammatically close to each other, despite some minor syntactic differences.

African Portuguese and Asian Portuguese are based on the standard European dialect, but have undergone their own phonetic and grammatical developments, sometimes reminiscent of the spoken Brazilian variant. A number of creoles of Portuguese have developed in African countries, for example in Guinea-Bissau and on the island of São Tomé.

=== Serbo-Croatian ===

Serbo-Croatian is a pluricentric language with four standards (Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian) promoted in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia. These standards do differ slightly, but do not hinder mutual intelligibility. Rather, as all four standardised varieties are based on the prestige Shtokavian dialect, major differences in intelligibility are identified not on the basis of standardised varieties, but rather dialects, like Kajkavian and Chakavian.&quot;Lexical differences between the ethnic variants are extremely limited, even when compared with those between closely related Slavic languages (such as standard Czech and Slovak, Bulgarian and Macedonian), and grammatical differences are even less pronounced. More importantly, complete understanding between the ethnic variants of the standard language makes translation and second language teaching impossible.&quot;

=== Spanish ===

Spanish has both national and regional linguistic norms, which vary in terms of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, but all varieties are mutually intelligible and the same orthographic rules are shared throughout.

In Spain, Standard Spanish is based upon the speech of educated speakers from Madrid. All varieties spoken in the Iberian Peninsula are grouped as Peninsular Spanish. Canarian Spanish (spoken in the Canary Islands), along with Spanish spoken in the Americas (including Spanish spoken in the United States, Central American Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Andean Spanish, and Caribbean Spanish), are particularly related to Andalusian Spanish.

The United States is now the world&#x27;s second-largest Spanish-speaking country after Mexico in total number of speakers (L1 and L2 speakers). A report said there are 41 million L1 Spanish speakers and another 11.6 million L2 speakers in the U.S. This puts the US ahead of Colombia (48 million) and Spain (46 million) and second only to Mexico (121 million).

The Spanish of Latin Americans has a growing influence on the language across the globe through music, culture and television produced using the language of the largely bilingual speech community of US Latinos.

In Argentina and Uruguay the Spanish standard is based on the local dialects of Buenos Aires and Montevideo. This is known as Rioplatense Spanish, (from Rio de la Plata (River Plate)) and is distinguishable from other standard Spanish dialects by . In Colombia, Rolo (a name for the dialect of Bogotá) is valued for its clear pronunciation. The Judeo-Spanish (also known as &quot;Ladino&quot;; not to be confused with &quot;Latino&quot;) spoken by Sephardi Jews can be found in Israel and elsewhere; it is usually considered a separate language.

=== Swedish ===
Two varieties exist, though only one written standard remains (regulated by the Swedish Academy of Sweden): &quot;Rikssvenska&quot; (literally &quot;Realm Swedish&quot;, also less commonly known as &quot;Högsvenska&quot;, &#x27;High Swedish&#x27; in Finland), the official language of Sweden, and &quot;Finlandssvenska&quot; which, alongside Finnish, is the other official language of Finland. There are differences in vocabulary and grammar, with the variety used in Finland remaining a little more conservative. The most marked differences are in pronunciation and intonation: Whereas Swedish speakers usually pronounce before front vowels as , this sound is usually pronounced by a Swedo-Finn as ; in addition, the two tones that are characteristic of Swedish (and Norwegian) are absent from most Finnish dialects of Swedish, which have an intonation reminiscent of Finnish and thus sound more monotonous when compared to &quot;Rikssvenska&quot;.

There are dialects that could be considered different languages due to long periods of isolation and geographical separation from the central dialects of Svealand and Götaland that came to constitute the base for the standard &quot;Rikssvenska&quot;. Dialects such as Elfdalian, Jamtlandic, and Gutnish all differ as much, or more, from standard Swedish than the standard varieties of Danish. Some of them have a standardized orthography, but the Swedish government has not granted any of them official recognition as regional languages and continues to look upon them as dialects of Swedish. Most of them are severely endangered and spoken by elderly people in the countryside.

=== Tamil ===
The vast majority of Tamil speakers reside in southern India, where it is the official language of Tamil Nadu and of Puducherry, and one of 22 languages listed in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.
It is also one of two official languages in Sri Lanka, one of four official languages in Singapore, and is used as the medium of instruction in government-aided Tamil primary schools in Malaysia.
Other parts of the world have Tamil-speaking populations, but are not loci of planned development.

Tamil is diglossic, with the literary variant used in books, poetry, speeches and news broadcasts while the spoken variant is used in everyday speech, online messaging and movies.
While there are significant differences in the standard spoken forms of the different countries, the literary register is mostly uniform, with some differences in semantics that are not perceived by native speakers.
There has been no attempt to compile a dictionary of Sri Lankan Tamil.

As a result of the Pure Tamil Movement, Indian Tamil tends to avoid loanwords to a greater extent than Sri Lankan Tamil.
Coinages of new technical terms also differ between the two.
Tamil policy in Singapore and Malaysia tends to follow that of Tamil Nadu regarding linguistic purism and technical coinages.

There are some spelling differences, particularly in the greater use of Grantha letters to write loanwords and foreign names in Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia.
The Tamil Nadu script reform of 1978 has been accepted in Singapore and Malaysia, but not Sri Lanka.

=== Others ===

* Standard Irish (Gaeilge), Scottish Gaelic and possibly Manx can be viewed as three standards arisen through divergence from the Classical Gaelic norm via orthographic reforms.
* Komi, a Uralic language spoken in northeastern European Russia, has official standards for its Komi-Zyrian and Komi-Permyak dialects.
* Korean: North and South (to some extent—differences are growing; see North–South differences in the Korean language and Korean dialects)
* Kurdish language has two main literary norms: Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish) and Sorani (Central Kurdish). The Zaza–Gorani languages, spoken by some Kurds, are occasionally considered to be Kurdish as well, despite not being mutually intelligible.
*For most of its history, Hebrew did not have a center. The grammar and lexicon were dominated by the canonical texts, but when the pronunciation was standardised for the first time, its users were already scattered. Therefore, three main forms of pronunciations developed, particularly for the purpose of prayer: Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Temani. When Hebrew was revived as a spoken language, there was a discussion about which pronunciation should be used. Ultimately, the Sephardi pronunciation was chosen even though most of the speakers at the time were of Ashkenazi background, because it was considered more authentic. The standard Israeli pronunciation of today is not Identical to the Sephardi, but is somewhat of a merger with Ashkenazi influences and interpretation. The Ashkenazi pronunciation is still used in Israel by Haredim in prayer and by Jewish communities outside of Israel.
* Lao and Isan, the situation in Thailand is in stark contrast to Laos where the Lao language is actively promoted as a language of national unity. Laotian Lao people are very conscious of their distinct, non-Thai language and although influenced by Thai-language media and culture, strive to maintain &#x27;good Lao&#x27;. Although spelling has changed, the Lao speakers in Laos continue to use a modified form of the &quot;Tai Noi&quot; script, the modern Lao alphabet.
* Norwegian consists of a multitude of spoken dialects displaying a great deal of variation in pronunciation and (to a somewhat lesser extent) vocabulary, with no officially recognized &quot;standard spoken Norwegian&quot; (but see Urban East Norwegian). All Norwegian dialects are mutually intelligible to a certain extent. There are two written standards: Bokmål, &quot;book language&quot;, based on Danish (Danish and Norwegian Bokmål are mutually intelligible languages with significant differences primarily in pronunciation rather than vocabulary or grammar), and Nynorsk, &quot;Modern [lit. New] Norwegian&quot;, based primarily on rural Norwegian dialects.
*Pashto has three official standard varieties: Central Pashto, which is the most prestigious standard dialect (also used in Kabul), Northern Pashto, and Southern Pashto.
* Romance languages
** Gallo-Italian languages include a great variety of dialects, some mutually unintelligible, and various written standards unrecognised both by Italy and Switzerland. Lombard, Piedmontese, Friulian and Istriot orthographies exist, with varying degrees of territorial specificity.
** Romanian in Romania and that in Moldova during the Soviet era, but nowadays, Romania and Moldova use the same standard of Romanian.
** Sardinian consists of a conglomerate of spoken dialects, displaying a significant degree of variation in phonetics and sometimes vocabulary. The Spanish subdivision of Sardinia into two administrative areas led to the emergence of two separate orthographies, Logudorese and Campidanese, as standardized varieties of the same language.
* Ukrainian and Rusyn (Priashiv (Prešov), Lemko, Pannonian) are either considered to be standardized varieties of the same language or separate languages.
* Dutch is considered pluricentric with recognised varieties in Suriname, ABC Islands, Belgium and the Netherlands.
* The Albanian language has two main varieties Gheg and Tosk. Gheg is spoken to the north and Tosk spoken to the south of the Shkumbin river. Standard Albanian is a standardised form of spoken Albanian based on Tosk.
* The Belarusian language features two orthographic standards: official Belarusian, sometimes referred to as Narkamaŭka, and Taraškievica, also known as &quot;classical orthography&quot;. The division stems from 1933 reform believed by some to be an attempt to artificially similarize Belarusian and Russian languages. Originally, these standards differed only in written form, but due to Taraškievica being widely used among Belarusian diaspora, it grew some distinct orthoepic features, as well as differences in vocabulary.
* Afrikaans varieties of South Africa and Namibia.

<text>Unwritten Law is the third album by the San Diego–based punk rock band Unwritten Law, released in 1998 by Interscope Records. It was their first album to chart, reaching No. 16 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Heatseekers chart. Music videos were filmed for the songs &quot;Teenage Suicide&quot;, &quot;California Sky&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Cailin&quot;, and &quot;Lonesome&quot;. &quot;Cailin&quot; and &quot;Lonesome&quot; were released as singles, the former being Unwritten Law&#x27;s first song to chart, reaching No. 28 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

==Production==
Pivit bassist Micah Albao performed as a session bassist on the album, as the band&#x27;s bassist John Bell had left prior to them going into the studio. Following the recording sessions, Pat &quot;PK&quot; Kim of Sprung Monkey joined Unwritten Law as their new permanent bass player. The album includes guest appearances by Brandon Boyd and Mike Einziger of Incubus on the hidden track &quot;418&quot;. An outtake from these sessions, &quot;Take Me Away&quot; later appeared as a b-side on the Seein&#x27; Red single.

While the band was in the studio, they were dropped by Epic, and were signed by Interscope Records after Tom Whalley heard the album, as the band recalled:When we were in Seattle making the record, Epic Records decided to drop us while we were in the studio. They never even heard the new record. After that, we didn&#x27;t know if we wanted to go back to an independent label or just try to find another major. Interscope Records came in right away and genuinely showed a love for the record. It made sense to go with them.

<text>Serbian art refers to the visual arts of the Serbs and their nation-state Serbia. The medieval heritage includes Byzantine art, preserved in architecture, frescos and icons of the many Serbian Orthodox monasteries. In the early modern period, Serbian visual arts began to be influenced by Western art, culminating in the Habsburg monarchy in the late 18th century. The beginning of modern Serbian art is placed in the 19th century. Many Serbian monuments and works of art have been lost forever due to various wars and peacetime marginalizations.

==Prehistory==

Currently, Europe&#x27;s oldest known civilization was discovered in Serbia, namely Lepenski Vir and Vinča culture. In Serbia, Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance (Serbia) are numerous and have the highest level of state protection under the Law on Cultural Heritage. See: Prehistoric sites in Serbia and Prehistory of Southeastern Europe for artifacts and sculpture found at the archeological sites of Lepenski Vir.

==Roman period==
Geographically Serbia was always part of the Roman Empire whether it was ruled from Rome or from Byzantium. The Roman ruins are found throughout the Balkan Peninsula.

==Medieval Serbian art==
We know little of the lives of the painters, craftsmen (engravers, goldsmiths, woodcarvers), builder/architects of medieval Serbia, of their studies, their schools, and their commissions. Slowly, however, we&#x27;re beginning to learn. But in the course of centuries experience in painting frescoes, miniatures, icons and the iconostasis, there undoubtedly arose arts and crafts workshops where a younger generation of painters and skilled craftsmen could learn the techniques of the masters.

Church architecture developed under the patronage of the medieval Serbian state. The most distinctive piece of medieval Serbian architecture was the Studenica monastery founded by Stefan Nemanja, the founder of the Nemanjić dynasty in 1166. This monastery also featured significant works of art including its Byzantine style fresco paintings. Its church also features extensive sculptures based on Psalms and the Dormition of the Theotokos. UNESCO added this monastery to its list of World Cultural Heritage sites in 1986. It was the model for other monasteries at Mileševa, Sopoćani and the Visoki Dečani. The influence of Byzantine art became more influential after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 in the Fourth Crusade when many Greek artists fled to Serbia. Their influence can be seen at the Church of the Ascension at Mileševa as well as in the wall paintings at the Church of the Holy Apostles at Peć and at the Sopoćani Monastery. Icons and frescoes also formed a significant part of church art. At that time in Raška, Stefan Vladislav who founded at Mileševa a monastery and a church where three of his court painters -- Demetrius, George and Theodore -- worked on wall painting free from the strict canon law tradition. The influence of Byzantine architecture reached its peak after 1300 including the rebuilding of the Our Lady of Ljeviš (ca. 1306–1307) and St. George at Staro Nagoričane as well as the Gračanica monastery. Church decorative paintings and religious arts and crafts also developed further in the period. The most noteworthy painters at the time were Michael Astrapas and Eutychios (fl. 1294-1317), Grigorije (1333), Jovan Teorijan (fl. 1345-1350), Monk Markarije (fl. 1366-1378) and before them, Deacon Jovan (fl. 1266-1271), Rufin (fl. 1271)
Icon of the Holy Virgin Pelagonitissa, dating from 1421, is considered one of the last outstanding achievements of icon painting, a representation of the then still-living Byzantine iconography. Its author Makarije Zograf (1380-1422) worked on the icon in the Church of Transfiguration in the monastery of the village Zrze, near Prilep, and many other Serbian monasteries during the fifteenth century. Makarije Zograf and his brother Metropolitan Jovan Zograf (1380-1422) cared for the monastery endowment until it was transferred to Constantine, the village head (&quot;kmet&quot;). Also, there was Aleksije (fl. 1350), Hieromonk Grigorije (1380-1420), Monk Joanikije (fl. 1410), but many did not sign their works, but they are not difficult to identify because of their unrivalled quality that cannot be mistaken from another school.

The Visoki Dečani monastery in Metohija was built between 1330 and 1350. Unlike other Serbian monasteries of the period, it was built with Romanesque features by master-builders under the monk Vitus of Kotor. Its frescoes feature 1000 portraits portraying all of the major themes of the New Testament. The cathedral features iconostasis, hegumen&#x27;s throne and carved royal sarcophagus. In 2004, UNESCO listed the Dečani Monastery on the World Heritage List.

There was a further spate of church building as the Serbian state contracted to the Morava basin in the late 14th century. Prince Stefan Lazarević was a poet and patron of the arts who founded the church at Resava at Morava with the wall paintings having a theme of parables of Christ with the people portrayed wearing feudal Serbian costumes.

Manuscripts were another significant feature of Serbian medieval art. &quot;Miroslav&#x27;s Gospel&quot; features lavish calligraphy and miniatures and is a significant artwork as well as a notable work of literature. The Chludov Psalter dating from the 14th century is beautifully decorated and was probably owned by a high-ranking noble. Serbian princes were well known in the 15th century for supporting manuscripts employing scribes and artists to create manuscripts besides icons and frescoes. Lovro Dobričević (1420-1478) of Kotor was a Venetian painter of Serbian origin, though Roman Catholic by confession, who first started to paint in the Serbian Orthodox Savina Monastery in Zeta and Serbian Despotate (now Montenegro) in the mid-15th century.

Later in 19th century, Serbian medieval art was used as inspiration for notable architect Andrey Damyanov who, between 1835 and 1878, along the Vardar and Morava Valleys and Bosnia, built around 40 churches and other buildings. Adapting to the social demand of its Serbian sponsors, Damyanov combined simultaneously traditional elements of the 15th century Morava school with Occidental baroque elements found North of Sava river.

Thanks are due to field scientist and academic Gabriel Millet who was the first to bring Serbian art to the attention of the West in 1919, along with Serbian-American scientist Michael Pupin, who gathered an international team of scholars and public figures to support the preservation of architectural heritage during and after the Great War. In 1918, Sir Thomas Graham Jackson, in Pupin&#x27;s &quot;Serbian Orthodox Church&quot; on the medieval Serbian churches, refuted the notion that Serbian art was nothing more than a branch of Byzantine art and showed that Serbian art had an original character of its own.

A large number of artistically worthy icons was made in this period.

===Fresco paintings===
Orthodox fresco painting represents the peak of Serbian medieval art. Its birth went in line with the creation and development of medieval Serbian state, but unlike Serbian state it didn&#x27;t cease to exist during the Ottoman occupation. While Serbian architecture has seen mixed influences of both Byzantine and medieval Italian states, fresco and icon painting remained deeply rooted in solely eastern byzantine tradition. 
Frescos were being painted under the patronage of Serbian rulers, as the highest form of religious decorative form. Following the political expansion and military growth, the 13th and 14th century are marked as the period when the biggest amount of newly built or existing sanctuaries have been decorated, mostly by unknown artists. Studenica monastery has been built in 1196 under the patronage of Stefan Nemanja, the founder of Nemanjić dynasty, and ever since it enjoyed the care of Stefan&#x27;s descendants as the &quot;archi-model&quot;. Its most representative fresco, &quot;The Crucifixion&quot;, was made twelve years later, in 1208, on the blue background brought into contrast with golden-yellow of Christ&#x27;s bare crucified body. In the second half of 14th century an unknown artist painted monumental &quot;The Dormition of the Virgin&quot; in Sopoćani monastery, which remained the supreme achievement of byzantine painting tradition. 
However, the most famous Serbian medieval fresco is the &quot;Myrrhbearers&quot; (or the &quot;White Angel&quot;) from the Mileševa monastery, painted in 1235, on the southern wall of the church. It depicts Archangel Gabriel sitting on Christ&#x27;s grave. The identity of its author is unknown. In the 16th century, the &quot;White Angel&quot; was over-painted with another fresco, and so was hidden until the 20th century when the fresco was restored. This fresco was sent as a message in the first satellite broadcast signal from Europe to America after the Cuban Missile Crisis, as a symbol of peace and civilization. Later, the same signal, containing the White Angel, was transmitted to space in an attempt to communicate with extraterrestrial life forms.
Another notable mention is the fresco of Serbian queen Simonida, in Gračanica monastery, today located on the disputed territory of Kosovo. Born as Simonis Palaiologina, she was a daughter of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) and Irene of Montferrat, and the fourth wife of Serbian king Stefan Milutin (r. 1282–1321). Two celebrated Serbian poems were inspired by the beauty of the fresco. Two dark stains on the places where the queen&#x27;s eyes were supposed to have created a common belief that her eyes were being &quot;carved out&quot; by Albanians, hence the well-known strophe by Milan Rakić:
&lt;poem&gt;
Your eyes were gouged out, oh beautiful image, 
On a pilaster at the approach of night, 
Knowing that no one would witness the pillage,
An Albanian’s knife robbed you of your sight.
&lt;/poem&gt;
However, between 1971 and 1976, during the conservation works in the monastery, it was discovered that for centuries the queen&#x27;s eyes were lying under what actually was (unsuccessfully intentionally damaged) grey layer. Once the patches were removed, &quot;Simonida&quot; was shown to media with light-blue eyes.

==16th and 17th centuries==

The Ottoman conquest of Serbia during the 15th century had a negative impact on the visual arts. The Serbs became part of the Rum Millet (Christian community), and were regarded as a lower class (rayah). The Serbian nobility was not integrated into the Ottoman state system, and the Ottoman government abolished the church. As the nobility and church were the main sources of patronage for architects and artists, the early modern period is considered an artistically less productive period in Serbian art. Despite the general trend, notable monuments were built. There was some resumption of artistic endeavor after the restoration of the Serbian Patriarchate in 1557. Zograf Longin (1530-1600) and Georgije Mitrofanović were the leading painters of the late 16th and early 17th century, along with Zograf Jovan, Andrija Raičević, Zograf Radul, Sava Krabulević, Kozma Damjanović, Tripo Kokolja, Zograf Dimitrije, Strahinja of Budimlje, Kyr Georgije and Kyr Kozma. Mitrofanović&#x27;s work on the church at the Morača Monastery is considered one of his best. Among the icon painters working in the Byzantine tradition in Slavonia were Nikola Klisur (mid-17th century) and Ostoja Mrkojević in the late 17th century.

==Baroque (18th century)==
Traditional Serbian art was beginning to show some Baroque influences at the end of the 18th century as shown in the works of Nikola Nešković, Teodor Kračun, and Jakov Orfelin. Painting of the early Baroque did not create a homogeneous group of painters. It developed under the Russian-Ukrainian and Southern Balkan basis and the influences that had slowly arrived from Western European art centers. The first generation of Baroque painters nourished on the learnings of the Russian painters Vasilije Romanovich and Jov Vasilijevich, then the trainee of the Kiev Academy of painting, Dimitrije Bačević, Vasa Ostojić, Joakim Marković, , Amvrosije Janković, Dimitrije Popović, Teodor Stefanov Gologlavac, Hadži-Ruvim Nenadović, and Stefan Tenecki. The work of Balkan icon painters in the Habsburg monarchy throughout the 18th century. Teodor Simonov (born in Moschopolis) worked for the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Karlovci during the eighth decade of the 18th century. Simonov painted the walls of the church monastery in Stolni Beograd, today&#x27;s Székesfehérvár in Hungary. The works of Jovan Četirević Grabovan who completed part of his education in Imperial Russia, and returned to the Habsburg monarchy to settle in Osijek in Slavonia where he developed a rich icon-painting activity. The works of others who also came originally from southern parts of the Balkans (once known as Old Serbia) such as Hristofor Žefarović and Janko Halkozović, created in the spirit of the Levant Baroque, relying on the transferred experience of Italian Renaissance art and the Byzantine tradition, which resulted in a distinctive model of Baroque icons. The originator of the more direct rotation on Central European models was Joakim Marković, whose work is linked to the first portraits and Still lifes, and in church painting of historical compositions and heraldic depictions.

High Baroque art was reflected in the firmer cultural orientation towards Vienna, as well as church and school reforms. The changes are visible in the works of Teodor Kračun who in his work represents a significant step towards understanding the actual Central European art. The retrospective Orthodox heritage confronted the emphasized emotionality and the movement as a fundamental element of artistic expression. Scenes are placed in the real world, Christ and Mary are depicted according to the rules of the secular ruler iconography and rely on graphic templates from popular illustrated Bibles. The group of representatives of the High Baroque include Mojsije Subotić, Grigorije Davidović-Obšić, Grigorije Jezdimirović and Lazar Serdanović.

The emergence and development of Late Baroque painting had been determined by the cultural and political changes of the time of Joseph II. Conceptual changes in the era of enlightened and learned man - the Enlightenment - marked the last decade of the 18th century. The learned artist, traveling the European capitals of Art, accepts and implements the ideas of the Enlightenment reforms. Among the artists who took Serbian painting of Central European Late Baroque formulation, Jakov Orfelin and Teodor Ilić Češljar stand out. They are joined by master woodcarvers Marko Gavrilović and his sons, Arsenije and Aksentije Marković and Marko Vujatović. Neoclassicism as the style of the new era, based on the ideas of the Enlightenment, would not jeopardize the ruling Late Baroque conception in the first decades of the next century. Such a sequence is identified in the works of painters Stefan Gavrilović, Jovan Isailović Sr., Georgije Mišković and Mihajlo Živković.

Among the important painters were Nikola Nešković, Teodor Kračun, Teodor Ilić Češljar, Pavel Đurković, Dimitrije Bačević, Georgije Bakalović, Stefan Gavrilović, Jovan Četirević Grabovan, Jovan Pačić, Jovan Stergević and others.

== 19th-century painting and drawing==

;Religious art
Printed magazines with engravings became a popular method of communicating through art, of both religious and irreligious themes. The printing of engravings of figures of prominent Serbian rulers fitted in the ideas of continuity of Serbian statehood. Monasteries on Fruška Gora and other ones in the Metropolitanate of Karlovci issued engraved magazines in which protector saints with monasteries were represented. Graphical arts of the 18th century were the first-class documents of the appearance and condition of monastery buildings before photographs. In the last decades of the 18th century, the written word suppressed visual arts as the main communication activity in religious magazines, with graphical arts becoming more and more used in illustrated books.

;Graphical arts

In the first decades of the 19th century a new graphic technique of lithography experience a real boom in the countries of Western Europe. Serbian artists gradually introduced it to the history of national arts in the 19th century. In contrast to modest attempts of scarce individuals, lithography becomes an important branch of Serbian art only with the emergence of Anastas Jovanović. Independent printed magazines on religious themes that prevailed in the 18th century became scarcer in the 19th century, only accounting for a part of the graphic production. As a medium very suitable for spreading political ideas, lithography dominates with national-historical themes. Sketch portraits and templates for lithography were dealt with by many Serbian painters: Jovan Isailović Jr., Jovan Popović, Uroš Knežević, Pavle Simić, Pavle Čortanović, Adam Stefanović, Steva Todorović, Đorđe Krstić, while being technically performed in Pest and Vienna by various lithographers. At the end of the 19th century, popular oleographs appear, as the first reproduction of popular works, most often with motifs from folklife and depictions of historical figures and events.

; Neoclassicism

Under the influence of the ides of Enlightenment and Rationalism, at the end of the 18th and beginning of 19th century, Serbian art came to leave baroque pictorial poetics and acceptance of the aesthetic ideals of the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, characterized by eclecticism of different stylistic expressions, of the late baroque to neo-classical. In addition to religious painting, which was still dominant, the portrait gains increasing importance. Portraits complete the picture of the new society created in that time and point to the idea of a permanent memory of individuals within the family or the wider community. The gallery of characters, in addition to church prelates and priests, senior officers, significant places is taken by eminent members of civil society from the first decades of the 19th century: lawyers, university professors, writers, wealthy merchants, and their wives, the status shown by marked clothing and jewelry. Stylistic features of paintings of that era: a balanced composition, precise modelling, rigorous academic drawing, colour of the reduced register, expressed in the works of Arsenije Teodorović, Pavel Đurković, Georgije Bakalović, Jeftimije Popović, Nikola Aleksić, Konstantin Danil, Jovan Isailović Jr., Katarina Ivanović, Dimitrije Avramović, and others.

;Biedermeier
In the 1830s the Serbian art scene is added by a generation of painters who transferred Biedermeier and Nazarene art programs from Central Europe. As a stylistic expression that deeply permeated the Serbian art at that time, Biedermeier was most suitable for the wide layers of citizens that concerned about themselves, their family and home. In the changed social circumstance in which the middle class had become the bearer of social changes, the family becomes the basic unit of modern society and the main scene of private life. Awareness of family is confirmed and visualized in family portraits, in groups or of some of its members. Family portraits depict the social status of the family, but at the same time, they have a private character and are part of a narrow family cult. In addition to portraits, Biedermeier painting is also focused on the Genre art and Still life. The most important representatives of the Biedermeier expression in Serbian painting are Konstantin Danil, Katarina Ivanović, Dimitrije Avramović and Nikola Aleksić.

;Romanticism
In the mid-19th century Serbian artistic creativity was marked with the reception of content and design of civil works (Biedermeier), but at the same time the development of a program of historicism. For the penetration of Romanticist conceptions, education and stays of Serbian painters in Vienna and Munich, as well as trips to Italy, were crucial. Social and political conditions contributed to the Romantic expression in Serbian art accomplishing its highest achievements in the late 1860s and beginning of 1870s. In stylistic and thematic view, Romanticism brought notable innovations: greater freedom of strokes and composition, warm colours complemented by the play of light and shadow. Most Serbian artists of that period reflected national-historical content in painting compositions, however, the client needs kept iconography and portrait painting popular. Some examples of notable Romanticist painters include Katarina Ivanović (1811–1882), Đura Jakšić (1832–1878), Pavle Simić (1818–1876), Novak Radonić (1826–1890), Aksentije Marodić, Đura Jakšić, Steva Todorović (1832–1925) and the globe-trotting son of Sava Petrović, Pavel Petrović whose famous work is found in Lima, Peru.

;Historicism
In accordance with the general ideas of Historicism, as the dominant characteristics of the culture of the 19th century in the European context, the top role in the process of constituting national identity was held by events and figures from national history. They represented a representative of the golden age of the nation, which in Serbian culture of the 19th century was equated with the period of the rule of the Nemanjić dynasty. The idealization of a glorious past, regardless of whether it was based on real facts or myth, was the main tool in the constitution and the homogenization of the nation. This idealized past was directly at the service of the glorification of the present, which emphasized the idea of rebuilding the former Serbian glory. These ideas are directly reflected in the visual art of the epoch - historical compositions, but also patriotic scenes that illustrate the events of the recent past are gaining more and more importance. They praise the nation through the idealization of events and personalities, becoming at the same time engaged means of communication with the aim to awaken national and patriotic feelings. Some examples of notable Historicist painters include Đura Jakšić (1832–1878) and Pavle Simić (1818–1876). The most productive period of visual arts made following the trends of Historicism in Serbian art was 1848—1878.

;Academicism

In the last decades of the 19th century, Serbian painters began to stay at Munich as a center of education and its Academy of Fine Arts, which compared to the Viennese, was more avant garde and progressive. However, the larger number of them remained faithful to the Vienna Academy where the education system was still based on constitutional education, traditional practices, and technical skills. The highest level of Academicism in Serbian painting of the late 19th century are portraits of Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) and Uroš Predić (1857–1953).

;Orientalism
Orientalism indicates interest in Oriental scenes in the visual arts of the 19th century. Napoleon&#x27;s campaign in Egypt, the conquest of Algeria, as well as travel books and other literary descriptions, encouraged the enthusiasm and imagination of artists. Islamic countries of the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa had become the preferred travel destination for many artists. Scenes of squares, bazaars, harem and various folklore events entered European painting. Orientalism rarely had a purely documentary character and more often depicted the enthusiasm of Europeans for beauty, vividness, and allure of the unknown and exotic world. The wild nature and unusual customs, combined with gorgeous colours and light, had become a great inspiration to European artists. During a long period of education, Paja Jovanović, along with classes at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, attended the School of historical painting of Leopold Müller, famous for its oriental motifs. There is no doubt that Miller&#x27;s crucial lessons determined his painting preference. Noting the increased interest of Europe to the events in the Balkans, he travelled during the holidays to Albania, Montenegro, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia gathering sketches and studies of the life of the Balkan peoples. Precisely these themes brought Paja Jovanović worldwide fame and popularity.

;Realism
In the last decades of the 19th century, with Serbian painters attending the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Realism entered the Serbian art scene. In stylistic view, Realists, succeeding the Romantic agitation, brought calm and order in painting. In Serbian painting Realism never took root in the true sense, in the symbiosis of thematics and techniques. Serbian painters, taught artistically to express in a new form, return to be faced with the difficult solvable problems of adapting the conditions of an economically, socially and culturally underdeveloped environment, which was unwilling to accept new social themes which European Realism advocated. Serbian painters, therefore, continue to paint portraits, religious and historical compositions.

;Symbolism

As a formulated artistic phenomenon on a European scale, Symbolism was also present at the Munich art scene, where some Serbian painters were formed. Representatives of Symbolism proclaimed turning of the indirect, associative and suggestive mode of expression. They used mythological symbols, dreams, and imagination as a visual language of the soul. Stevan Aleksić is the most notable representative of the period.

==Applied art and design==

In terms of periodization, monuments can be divided into those from the period of the Principality, period of the Kingdom of Serbia, the monuments from the period of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, as well as those built in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the present-day Republic of Serbia.

Applied art and design through the centuries have evolved in Serbia through crafts. The wealth of forms, the variety of materials with powerful color schemes and ornamentation folk art represented a strong stimulus for the affirmation of applied art, which in the second half of the 19th century, gets its first artists in Serbia. End of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century were marked by the work of individual personalities, each of them made a significant contribution to the development and the history of applied art in Serbia. These were people of different professions and some of them include: Mihailo Valtrović, Vladislav Titelbah, Dragiša Milutinović, Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak.

==Modern visual arts==
Kiril Kutlik set up the first school of art in Serbia in 1895. Many of his students went to study in Western Europe, especially France and Germany and brought back avant-garde styles. Nadežda Petrović was influenced by Fauvism while Sava Šumanović worked in Cubism. Other well-known artists of the Avant-Garde movement from 1900 to 1918 were: Anastas Bocarić, Steva Todorović, Paja Jovanović, Marko Murat, Beta Vukanović, Đorđe Krstić, Paško Vučetić, Leon Koen, Svetislav Jovanović, Živko Jugović, Vasa Pomorišac, Adam Stefanović and others.
After World War I, the &quot;Belgrade School of Painting &quot;developed in the capital with some members such as Milan Konjović working in a Fauvist manner, while others such as Marko Čelebonović working in a style called &quot;Intimisme&quot; based on the use of colours.

Some artists chose to emigrate from the Serbia and the Yugoslavia. Dragoslav Stoyanovitch (1891-1978) took part in the heyday of poster art in Paris in 1910 while Yovan Radenkovitch (1901–1979) left Belgrade for Paris in the 1930s. Radenkovitch befriended Matisse and Vlaminck and adopted a style inspired by Fauvism, before eventually leaving Europe to work in New York and settled in Waterbury, Connecticut, where several of his paintings are still kept in Mattatuck Museum.Stoyanovitch was one of the early poster designers for the Gaumont Film Company and continued with his prolific painting career long after. His war poster, created in 1916, entitled &quot;Filming with the Troops&quot; hangs at the Imperial War Museum in London,
and others are at the Gaumont Film Company archives. Despite his productive career, Stoyanovitch&#x27;s contribution to art has been much overlooked.

Socrealism was the dominant school after World War II with the rise to power of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito. However, that period did not last long – during the 1960s, Serbian artists started to break free from the constraints of the Communists led by figures such as Petar Lubarda and Milo Milunović. The Mediala group featuring Vladimir Veličković was formed in the 1970s to promote Surrealist figurative painting. Serbian art was split between those basing their works on the traditions of Serbian work such as frescoes and iconography and those exploring international styles.

Naïve art became prominent in the second half of the 20th century, with many notable artists coming from Vojvodina province. Serbian naïve art painters include Dušan Jevtović and Milosav Jovanović.

The first part of 21st century, with young artists like Jovanka Sanijenovic or Simonida Rajčević, marks a predominance of a figurative art linked to realism – a realism &quot;where everything is real and nothing is real – considering contemporary time as needing a return to what is real and concrete, and at the same time social and existential&quot;. The Human Rights Logo was created by Serbian graphic designer Predrag Stakić.

==Contemporary art==
At the beginning of the 1980s in Belgrade was established movement &quot;New Image&quot; painting with Milovan Destil Marković and Vlasta Volcano Mikić (Žestoki), later followed by (Alter imago group) Nada Alavanja, Tahir Lušić, Vladimir Nikolić and later Mileta Prodanović.

==Performance art==

Maga Magazinović, philosopher and choreographer, was one of the most important figures of contemporary physical practice in Serbia before the Second World War. The emancipation of the body in her work was realized through the application of gymnastics, dance and physical education. During the 1960s and 1970s history of the contemporary dance developed in the framework of performance art, body art and happenings. On the status of the body can meditate in the works of Marina Abramović and Katalin Ladik. The performance art of the eighties was marked by a specific attitude toward ideology. This attitude is manifested in the work within the context of using utopian socialist iconography. During the &#x27;90s performance art was focused on the fight against the regime.

Marina Abramović is the most prominent Serbian performance artist. Active for over three decades, she has been described as the &quot;grandmother of performance art.&quot; She pioneered a new notion of identity by bringing in the participation of her observers. Her art focuses on the theme of “confronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body,” while relying on the extent of these discomforts based on the actions of her audience members.

Another performance artists include Gabrijel Savić Ra, Nela Antonović, Lidija Antonović, Predrag Radovančević.

<doc id="1263166" wikidata="Q7730087" url="?curid=1263166" title="The Diamond Smugglers">
<text>The Diamond Smugglers is a non-fiction work by Ian Fleming that was first published in 1957 in the United Kingdom and in 1958 in the United States. The book is based on two weeks of interviews Fleming undertook with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation (IDSO), which was headed by Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-chief of MI5 who worked for the diamond company De Beers.

The IDSO was formed by Sillitoe to combat the smuggling of diamonds from Africa, where, it was estimated, £10 million (£ in 2025 pounds) worth of gems were being smuggled every year out of South Africa alone. The book expands upon articles Fleming wrote for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1957.

Fleming was better known as the author of a series of books about his super-spy creation, James Bond; &quot;The Diamond Smugglers&quot; is one of two non-fiction books he wrote. It was broadly well-received, although some reviewers commented on the stories not being new.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Diamond Smugglers&quot; is the account of Ian Fleming&#x27;s meeting with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation (IDSO). The book takes the form of background narrative by Fleming of where the two men met, interspersed with the interview between Fleming and Collard, who is introduced under the pseudonym of &quot;John Blaize&quot;.

Collard relates how he was recruited into the IDSO by Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, under whom Collard had worked. The book goes on to look at the activities of the IDSO from the end of 1954 until the operation was closed down in April 1957, when its job was complete. Collard explained that the IDSO was set up at the instigation of the Chairman of De Beers, Sir Philip Oppenheimer, after an Interpol report stated that £10 million of diamonds were being smuggled out of South Africa each year, as well as additional amounts from Sierra Leone, Portuguese West Africa, the Gold Coast and Tanganyika.

As well as providing a history of the IDSO&#x27;s operations, Collard relates a number of illustrative vignettes concerning the diamond smuggling cases he and the organisation dealt with.

==Background==
Fleming became interested in diamond smuggling after reading an article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1954 concerning the Sierra Leone diamond industry. Philip Brownrigg, an old friend from Eton and a senior exec of De Beers, arranged for Fleming to visit the London Diamond Club to see diamonds being sorted and polished. In 1955 Brownrigg also introduced Fleming to Sir Percy Sillitoe, former head of MI5, who was working for De Beers and investigating the illicit diamond trade through the International Diamond Security Organisation. Fleming met Sillitoe and used much of the research as background material for his fictional Bond novel, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;.

Fleming retained an interest in the subject and when Sillitoe suggested to the editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Denis Hamilton, that the paper may want to write a story on the International Diamond Security Organisation, Hamilton offered the story to Fleming. Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview. During World War II, Collard had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war&#x27;s end. Whilst in MI5 he played a major role in the capture and conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, before Sillitoe had approached him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond Security Organisation.

Fleming and Collard met in Tangiers on 13 April 1957; Fleming considered Collard to be a &quot;reluctant hero, like all Britain&#x27;s best secret agents&quot;. The pair spent two weeks discussing the issue of diamond smuggling, with Collard explaining what happened in South Africa and Sierra Leone. Fleming would then dictate an average of 5,000 words a day to a secretary.

When the drafts of the books were shown to De Beers they objected to a number of areas and threatened an injunction against Fleming and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, which resulted in much material being removed. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; serialised the book over six weeks, starting on 15 September 1957 and finishing on 20 October 1957.

==Release and reception==
&quot;The Diamond Smugglers&quot; was published in the UK in November 1957, by Jonathan Cape, was 160 pages long and cost 12 shillings 6d. The book was published in the US on 13 May 1958, by Macmillan and cost $3.50.

===Reviews===
The book received largely positive reviews. Michael Crampton, writing for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; considered it an &quot;exciting and richly fascinating account&quot; and thought Fleming authored a book that &quot;ringing true as fact, is at the same time as highly entertaining as any fiction.&quot; &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; obtained the services of the Earl of Cardigan to review the book. He noted that &quot;the book is put together with a skill one would expect from Mr. Fleming&quot;, which leads to something that is &quot;very entertaining reading&quot;.

Reviewing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, Anthony Sampson thought the book had &quot;sparkle&quot;, adding that &quot;it is often difficult to remember that we are not listening to his old hero Mr. James Bond.&quot; Sampson noted that the book included &quot;several yarns which are worthy of the best spy-stories&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;The Economist&quot; enjoyed the book, but considered that while many of the stories &quot;make good reading ... they are not new&quot;. For &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Barkham thought that Fleming&#x27;s foray into non-fiction produced &quot;mixed results&quot;. Although he found the subject interesting, the basis in interview resulted in a &quot;choppy book&quot; that was &quot;no more than an interim report&quot;.

==Attempted film adaptation==

Shortly after publication, The Rank Group offered £13,500 (£ in 2025 pounds) for the film rights to the book, which Fleming accepted, telling them he would write a full story outline for an extra £1,000. Several contemporary newspaper reports referred to the project as &quot;The Diamond Spy&quot;. British producer George Willoughby subsequently obtained the rights for the book from Rank and tried to make a film with the actor Richard Todd, eventually commissioning a screenplay from Australian writer Jon Cleary, who finished a script in October 1964 that remained faithful in spirit to Fleming&#x27;s book while also featuring elements familiar from the James Bond films. Kingsley Amis was also hired as a story consultant; in a letter to author Theo Richmond on 20 December 1965 Amis wrote he was having &#x27;a horrible time&#x27; of writing an outline for Willoughby. W.H. &quot;Bill&quot; Canaway, co-author of the screenplay for &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;, was also hired to work on the script. At one point, film director John Boorman was involved. Despite interest from Anglo-Amalgamated Film Distributors and Anglo Embassy Productions in early 1966, the project was shelved later that year.

<doc id="1263172" wikidata="Q176146" url="?curid=1263172" title="Sheppard Air Force Base">
<text>Sheppard Air Force Base is a United States Air Force (USAF) base located north of the central business district of Wichita Falls, in Wichita County, Texas, United States. It is the largest training base and most diversified in Air Education and Training Command. The base is named in honor of Texas Senator John Morris Sheppard, a supporter of military preparations before World War II.

The host unit at Sheppard is the 82d Training Wing (82 TRW), which provides specialized technical training and field training for officers, airmen and civilians of all branches of the U.S. military, other Department of Defense agencies and foreign nationals.

The 80th Flying Training Wing (80 FTW), also at Sheppard, conducts the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) program, a multi-nationally manned and managed flying training program chartered to produce combat pilots for both USAF and NATO. This internationally manned and managed flying training program is the only one in the world.

Brigadier General George T.M. Dietrich III is the commander of the 82d Training Wing and he concurrently serves as the installation commander of Sheppard AFB. Colonel Brad E. Orgeron is the commander of the 80th Flying Training Wing.

Sheppard AFB shares one runway with Wichita Falls Municipal Airport under a joint civil-military arrangement.

==History==
Sheppard Air Force Base is named in honor of Senator John Morris Sheppard of Texas (1875–1941), chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee from 1933 until his death on 9 April 1941. Senator Sheppard helped lead the fight for military preparedness before the attack on Pearl Harbor.

The base began as Sheppard Field on 300 acres (1.2 km2) just south of Kell Field. A Texas cattleman, oilman, and philanthropist, Joseph Sterling Bridwell, sold the land to the United States Army for one dollar.

It was officially opened as a United States Army Air Corps training center on 17 October 1941, following the arrival of the first military members on 14 June. As the Army Air Corps became the Army Air Forces, facilities were completed sufficiently to allow the first class of 22 aviation mechanics to enter training that October; the class graduated 23 February 1942.

During World War II, then-Sheppard Field conducted basic training, and it also trained glider mechanics, technical and flying training instructors and B-29 Superfortress flight engineers. In addition to the basic flying training, the base also provided advanced pilot training.

Sheppard Field reached its peak strength of 46,340 people while serving as a separation center for troops being discharged following World War II from September through November 1945. Sheppard Field was deactivated 31 August 1946 and declared surplus to the War Department&#x27;s needs. It was transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers 30 April 1947. Over the next two years the Texas National Guard used the base.

===USAF Training Center===

Control and accountability for Sheppard Field was transferred to the Department of the Air Force 1 August 1948 and was reactivated 15 August 1948 to supplement Lackland AFB, Texas, as a basic training center renamed as Sheppard AFB. Basic training was discontinued in June 1949, but was resumed from July 1950 to May 1952.

Over the next three decades, three training schools were stationed at the base training students in aircraft maintenance, transportation, communication, civil engineering, aircrew life support and field training.

The aircraft mechanics school was transferred to Sheppard from Keesler AFB, Mississippi in April 1949 to make room for expansion of electronic training at that base. The school was renamed the Department of Aircraft Maintenance Training within the 3750th Technical School. During the Korean War (1950–1953) several airmen from such places as Greece and Turkey were trained as mechanics.

Comptroller, transportation, and intelligence training moved to Sheppard from Lowry AFB, Colorado, in the fall of 1954. Communications, refrigeration, air conditioning, and power production operator and repairman training were transferred here from F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming in 1959. Intelligence training returned to Lowry in February 1962. Training in certain missile systems began at Sheppard in 1957 and was conducted there through September 1985 when Titan II training operations were terminated following that weapon system&#x27;s retirement.

The 3950th Technical Training Wing was designated the Sheppard Technical Training Center 1 January 1959. It has had two subsequent name changes and is now the 82d Training Wing.

Helicopter pilot training was transferred from Stead AFB, Nevada in October 1965, with H-19, H-43, Bell TH-1F, CH-3C and HH-3E helicopters used for training. Additional training in airborne firefighting was also conducted, given the role of the USAF HH-43 aircraft as a local rescue and aircraft firefighting asset at selected air force bases in the United States and at air bases overseas.

The 3630th Flying Training Wing was activated in 1965, and it assumed the helicopter training program. It began providing undergraduate pilot training in the T-37 and Northrop T-38 Talon for the then-West German Air Force in August 1966. Helicopter training was discontinued in 1971 when the U.S. Army assumed responsibility for training USAF helicopter pilots at Fort Rucker, Alabama.

The 3630th Flying Training Wing also provided undergraduate pilot training for pilots of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force from 1971 to 1975. The Wing designation was changed to the 80th Flying Training Wing on 1 January 1973.

The 80th Flying Training Wing began conducting the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training Program in 1981. This one-of-a-kind program includes 13-NATO countries. They are: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. Approval to conduct the program was recently extended through the year 2005.

The Air Force School of Health Care Sciences offered training in dentistry, medicine, nursing (to include flight nurse training), and health-services administration. The population of the base had declined to 3,825 in 1990.

In February 1992, restructuring and downsizing of the USAF caused a realignment and renumbering of units at Sheppard. Some of the training wings were redesignated as groups, and the technical training groups became squadrons.

===Strategic Air Command===
Between 1960 and 1966 the Strategic Air Command (SAC) had training units stationed at the base that conducted aerospace rescue schools and weather instruction. In addition, The 494th Bombardment Wing, a SAC operational wing of B-52D Stratofortress bombers and KC-135A Stratotanker aircraft, previously designated as the 4245th Strategic Wing, was based at Sheppard from 1963 to 1966.

In July 1969, Detachment 1, 2nd Bombardment Wing, with four B-52 aircraft, became a tenant organization at Sheppard and remained until 1975. These aircraft rotated as part of SAC&#x27;s dispersal concept and utilized the SAC Alert Facility on the northwest end of the airfield.

===BRAC 2005===
The DoD proposed a major realignment of the base, as part of the Base Realignment and Closure, 2005 program announced on 13 May 2005. DoD recommended relocating to Eglin AFB, Florida, front-line and instructor-qualified maintenance technicians and logistics support personnel to stand up the USAF&#x27;s portion of the F-35 Lightning II Initial Joint Training Site there. This recommendation would establish Eglin AFB as the Initial Joint Training Site that would teach entry-level aviators and maintenance technicians how to safely operate and maintain the new F-35. Assuming no economic recovery, this recommendation could result in a maximum potential reduction of 487 jobs (295 direct jobs and 192 indirect jobs) over 2006–2011 in the Wichita Falls, TX, Metropolitan Statistical Area (0.5 percent).

==Role and operations==
===82d Training Wing===
The host unit on Sheppard Air Force Base is the 82d Training Wing, whose mission makes it the most diversified training base within AETC. It is a non-flying wing that conducts all technical training at Sheppard. The 982d Training Group (982 TRG) provides instruction in a wide range of specialties at Sheppard and also at more than 60 USAF installations worldwide. The 82d Mission Support Group (82 MSG) and the 82 Medical Group (82 MDG) support these organizations. Together with the 80th Flying Training Wing more than 7 million U.S. and allied warriors have been trained.

===80th Flying Training Wing===
The 80th Flying Training Wing&#x27;s mission is &quot;To produce NATO pilots with the skills and attitude to succeed in fighter aviation&quot;. It is home of the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) Program. It is a uniquely manned multinational organization with a USAF wing commander and a German Air Force operations group commander in the top two leadership positions. Command and operations officers&#x27; positions in the flying training squadrons rotate among the participating nations, while the commander of the 80th Operations Support Squadron is always from the USAF.

Officers from all 13 participating nations fill subordinate leadership positions throughout the wing. Nine nations--Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, Spain and the United States—provide instructor pilots based on their number of student pilots. Canada, Greece and Spain do not have student pilots in training, but do provide one instructor pilot. The current non-active signatory nations, the United Kingdom and Portugal, do not send student pilots nor do they provide instructor pilots, but retain the right to do so at any time.

Operational training squadrons are:

* 80th OSS &quot;Wizards&quot;
*88th Fighter Training Squadron &quot;Lucky Devils&quot; (T-38C)
*89th Flying Training Squadron &quot;Banshees&quot; (T-6A)
*90th Flying Training Squadron &quot;Boxing Bears&quot; (T-38C)
*97th Flying Training Squadron &quot;Madcats&quot; (A.K.A. &quot;Devil Cats&quot;)...Air Force Reserve Command Associate Instructor Pilot program (T-6A and T-38C)
*459th Flying Training Squadron &quot;Twin Dragons&quot; (T-6A)
*469th Flying Training Squadron &quot;Fighting Bulls&quot; (T-38C)

<text>&quot;Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)&quot; is a song written and recorded by American country music duo Big &amp; Rich. It was released in April 2004 as the second single from their debut album &quot;Horse of a Different Color&quot;. It reached number 11 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; US Country chart. The song received wide exposure when ESPN featured the song in commercials for its coverage of the 2004 World Series of Poker. It was also featured in the &quot;Boston Legal&quot; episode &quot;Death Be Not Proud&quot;.

Big &amp; Rich also released a remixed dance version of the song which appeared on their compilation &quot;Big &amp; Rich&#x27;s Super Galactic Fan Pak&quot;. They performed this remixed version at the CMT Video Music Awards in 2005. The song was also featured in a Chevrolet commercial that was aired during Super Bowl XLI and the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.

The song appears on the game Karaoke Revolution Country, as well as in the 2012 film &quot;Magic Mike&quot;. The song also appears in the final episode of &quot;The Office&quot;.

==Content==
The song is a fusion of country rock and country rap. The first two verses detail &quot;Big&quot; Kenny Alphin and John Rich&#x27;s arrival into Nashville, going into a bar, &quot;passing out hundred-dollar bills&quot; and, &quot;buying the bar a double round of Crown.&quot; They vow that Nashville is &quot;never gonna be the same.&quot; They ride around Nashville on horses, while everyone else says to &quot;save a horse&quot; and &quot;ride a cowboy.&quot;

==Music video==
The music video for the song was filmed in Nashville during the summer of 2004. Big &amp; Rich, other members of the MuzikMafia, including Gretchen Wilson and Cowboy Troy, as well as dancers, marching bands, and other groups of people, parade on the Shelby Street Bridge in Nashville. It was directed by David Hogan. The video caused damage to the bridge including dents and scuff marks, which cost $23,000 in repairs.

==One World Gear==
In April 2007, the song was parodied by T-shirt manufacturer One World Gear, who began to offer a series of products on CafePress.com featuring variants of the slogan &quot;Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy&quot;, in which the word &quot;cowboy&quot; was replaced with the name of any one of 177 different nationalities, including &quot;American&quot;. The version of the T-shirt featuring the slogan &quot;Save a Horse, Ride a Taiwanese&quot; was singled out as &quot;racially discriminatory&quot; and &quot;insulting to Taiwan&quot; by Taiwanese and Hong Kong media.

==Chart performance==
&quot;Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)&quot; debuted at number 58 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks for the week of April 24, 2004. It has sold 2.087 million copies as of April 2013.

<text>James Hemphill Brown (born September 25, 1942) is an American biologist and academic.

He is an ecologist, and a Distinguished Professor of Biology at the University of New Mexico. His work has focused on 3 distinct aspects of ecology: 1) the population and community ecology of rodents and harvester ants in the Chihuahuan Desert, 2) large-scale questions relating to the distribution of body size, abundance and geographic range of animals, leading to the development of the field of macroecology, a term that was coined in a paper Brown co-authored with Brian Maurer of Michigan State University. and 3) the Metabolic Theory of Ecology. In 2005 he was awarded the Robert H. MacArthur Award by the Ecological Society of America for his work, including his work toward a metabolic theory of ecology. Between 1969 and 2011 he was awarded over $18.4 million in grants for his research.

<text>Dark fantasy, also called fantasy horror, is a subgenre of fantasy literary, artistic, and cinematic works that incorporates disturbing and frightening themes. The term is ambiguously used to describe stories that combine horror elements with one or other of the standard formulas of fantasy.

==Definition==

A strict definition for dark fantasy is difficult to pin down. Gertrude Barrows Bennett has been called &quot;the woman who invented dark fantasy&quot;. Both Charles L. Grant and Karl Edward Wagner are credited with having coined the term &quot;dark fantasy&quot;—although both authors were describing different styles of fiction. Brian Stableford argues &quot;dark fantasy&quot; can be usefully defined as subgenre of stories that attempt to &quot;incorporate elements of horror fiction&quot; into the standard formulae of fantasy stories. Stableford also suggests that supernatural horror set primarily in the real world is a form of &quot;contemporary fantasy&quot;, whereas supernatural horror set partly or wholly in &quot;secondary worlds&quot; should be described as &quot;dark fantasy&quot;.

Additionally, other authors, critics, and publishers have adopted dark fantasy to describe various other works. However, these stories rarely share universal similarities beyond supernatural occurrences and a dark, often brooding, tone. As a result, dark fantasy cannot be solidly connected to a defining set of tropes. The term itself may refer collectively to tales that are either horror-based or fantasy-based.

Some writers also use &quot;dark fantasy&quot; (or &quot;Gothic fantasy&quot;) as an alternative description to &quot;horror&quot;, because they feel the latter term is too lurid or vivid.

==Concept and history==
Charles L. Grant is often cited as having coined the term &quot;dark fantasy&quot;. Grant defined his brand of dark fantasy as &quot;a type of horror story in which humanity is threatened by forces beyond human understanding&quot;. He often used dark fantasy as an alternative to horror, as horror was increasingly associated with more visceral works.

Dark fantasy is sometimes also used to describe stories told from a monster&#x27;s point of view, or that present a more sympathetic view of supernatural beings usually associated with horror. Anne Rice&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro&#x27;s &quot;Saint-Germain&quot;, and Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; are early examples of this style of dark fantasy. This is in contrast to the traditional horror model, which focuses more on the victims and survivors.

In a more general sense, dark fantasy is occasionally used as a synonym for supernatural horror, to distinguish horror stories that contain elements of the supernatural from those that do not. For example, a story about a werewolf or vampire could be described as dark fantasy, while a story about a serial killer would simply be horror.

Stableford suggests that the type of horror conveyed by fantasy stories such as William Beckford&#x27;s &quot;Vathek&quot; and Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; &quot;is more aesthetic than visceral or existential&quot;, and that such stories should be considered &quot;dark fantasies&quot; rather than the &quot;supernaturalized thrillers&quot; of conventional horror fiction.

Karl Edward Wagner is often credited for creating the term &quot;dark fantasy&quot; when used in a more fantasy-based context. Wagner used it to describe his fiction about the Gothic warrior Kane. Since then, &quot;dark fantasy&quot; has sometimes been applied to sword and sorcery and high fantasy fiction that features anti-heroic or morally ambiguous protagonists. Another good example under this definition of dark fantasy is Michael Moorcock&#x27;s saga of the albino swordsman Elric.

The fantasy work of H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith and their emulators have been specified as &quot;dark fantasy&quot;, since the imaginary worlds they depicted contain many horror elements.

Dark fantasy is occasionally used to describe fantasy works by authors whom the public primarily associates with the horror genre. Examples of these are Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series, Peter Straub&#x27;s &quot;Shadowland&quot; and Clive Barker&#x27;s &quot;Weaveworld&quot;. Alternatively, dark fantasy is sometimes used for &quot;darker&quot; fiction written by authors best known for other styles of fantasy; Raymond Feist&#x27;s &quot;Faerie Tale&quot; and Charles de Lint&#x27;s novels written as Samuel M. Key would fit here. 

Roald Dahl&#x27;s novel &quot;The Witches&quot; (and its film adaptations) is described as dark fantasy. Dahl&#x27;s poetic reworking of &quot;Cinderella&quot; (which features in his poetry collection &quot;Revolting Rhymes&quot;) sees him upend the happy tale.

==Other media==

=== Anime and manga ===
&quot;Berserk&quot;, a manga and anime franchise by Kentaro Miura that debuted in 1989, is frequently noted as an example of the genre due to its depictions of extreme violence, moral ambiguity, apocalyptic storylines and anti-hero protagonists.

&quot;Attack on Titan&quot; is a dark fantasy for its intense violence and the dystopian world it takes place in.

=== Films ===
Ridley Scott&#x27;s film &quot;Legend&quot; (1985) has been described as a &quot;dark fairy tale&quot; fantasy film. Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; (2006) has been described as a &quot;sort of a dark spin on &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;&quot;.

=== Video games ===
The 2013 fantasy action role-playing game &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Crown&quot; contains many elements of dark fantasy, such as werewolves, vampires, zombies, homonculi, and human-monster hybrids.

Modern games from Japanese game development and publishing company FromSoftware are lauded as exceptional representations of the dark fantasy genre, notably the &quot;Dark Souls&quot; series along with &quot;Bloodborne&quot; and later &quot;Elden Ring&quot;.

<text>My Philosophical Development is a 1959 book by the philosopher Bertrand Russell, in which the author summarizes his philosophical beliefs and explains how they changed during his life.

==Summary==

Russell gives an account of his philosophical development. He describes his Hegelian period and includes hitherto unpublished notes for a Hegelian philosophy of science. He deals next with the two-fold revolution involved with his abandonment of idealism and adoption of a mathematical logic founded upon that of Giuseppe Peano. After two chapters on &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (1910-1913), he passes to the problems of perception as dealt with in &quot;Our Knowledge of the External World&quot; (1914). In a chapter on ‘The Impact of Wittgenstein’, Russell examines what he now thinks must be accepted and what rejected in that philosopher&#x27;s work. He notes the changes from earlier theories required by the adoption of William James&#x27;s view that sensation is not essentially relational and is not per se a form of knowledge. In an explanatory chapter, he endeavors to remove misconceptions of and objections to his theories as to the relation of perception to scientific knowledge. Russell concludes with a reprint of some articles on modern Oxford philosophy.

<text>The Minnesota Kicks was a professional soccer team that played at Metropolitan Stadium in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington, Minnesota, from 1976 to 1981. The team was a member of the now defunct North American Soccer League (NASL).
Initially known as the Denver Dynamos, the team relocated and became the Minnesota Kicks in 1976. The Kicks quickly became one of the league&#x27;s more popular teams, with an average attendance of 23,120 fans per game in 1976. The Kicks won their division four years in a row from 1976 to 1979. The Kicks drew over 23,000 fans in each season from 1976 to 1979, with attendance peaking at 32,775 in 1977.

==History==
The team had relocated to Minnesota after having been based in Denver, Colorado, as the Denver Dynamos. A group of ten investors from Minnesota, led by Jack Crocker, bought the Denver team on November 25, 1975, and relocated to Minnesota. The name &quot;Kicks&quot; was selected by a name-the-team contest, and announced on January 28, 1976. Freddie Goodwin, who had previously coached the New York Generals, was named the first coach on February 19, 1976. Goodwin served also as team president starting in August 1976.

The team began the 1976 season slowly, however by the end of its first season the team had won the Western Division. During the season, the Kicks boosted their roster by signing Ade Coker from Boston. The Kicks also played Glasgow Rangers to a 2–2 draw in a friendly. Minnesota was a success with fans, averaging 23,117 per game, including 42,065 for its regular season finale, But it was a game with the New York Cosmos on June 9 that convinced that The Kicks have arrived. With Pelé playing for the Cosmos, the Cosmos beat the Kicks 2–1, but the Kicks set a new NASL record of 46,164 fans. The team was led by leading scorer Alan Willey with 16 goals.
The 1976 playoffs included a 3–0 win over Seattle, followed by a 3–1 win over San Jose in front of a Kicks record of 49,576 fans, and finished with a 3–0 loss to the Toronto Metros-Croatia in the 1976 Soccer Bowl at Seattle&#x27;s Kingdome in front of 25,000, with the winning goal scored by Portuguese legend Eusébio.

In 1977, the Kicks won the Western Division again, and averaged 32,775 fans, second only to the New York Cosmos. The Kicks were again led by Alan Willey with 14 goals, while midfielder Alan West was named to the All-Star team. The Kicks lost in the playoffs to Seattle.

In 1978 the Kicks won the Central Division, averaging 30,928 fans. The team&#x27;s leading scorer was Alan Willey, with 21 goals. In the playoffs, the Kicks defeated Tulsa before losing to the New York Cosmos. After the 1978 season, Goodwin stepped down as coach.

Roy McCrohan was named coach December 1978, and he coached the team for the 1979 season. In 1979, the Kicks signed a major international star in defender Björn Nordqvist, Sweden&#x27;s all-time caps leader. The Kicks won the Central Division again in 1979, but fell to Tulsa in the playoffs. Once again, Alan Willey led the team&#x27;s scoring with 21 goals, and Ace Ntsoelengoe was named to the All-Star Team.

After nine games into 1980 season, McCrohan was removed, and Goodwin again became coach. The Kicks finished the regular season second behind the Dallas Tornado in the Central Division, and lost in the playoffs to Dallas. Ace Ntsoelengoe was the team&#x27;s leading scorer with 13 goals and 17 assists.

Stars for the Kicks included US Soccer Hall of Famers Patrick (Ace) Ntsoelengoe and Alan Willey, the league&#x27;s fifth and third league all-time leading scorers respectively. Ron Futcher, who along with Willey played all six Kicks seasons, went on to become the league&#x27;s fourth all-time leading scorer.

The Kicks were the first team in the NASL to win 4 straight division titles (1976–79). The team reached the playoffs each of its six seasons, but usually lost in the early rounds.
The Minnesota Kicks are remembered for the tailgating in the Metropolitan Stadium parking lot. It became a cultural phenomenon in the late 1970s, with thousands of fans arriving early to socialize and consume beverages.

===Demise===
The original ownership group sold the team on November 12, 1980, to a group led by Englishman Ralph Sweet, who replaced Goodwin as coach early in the 1981 season. Goodwin remained president of the team until June 1981. The Kicks finished the 1981 season second in the Central Division. Ron Futcher was the team&#x27;s leading scorer with 14 goals. The Kicks defeated Tulsa in the playoffs, but lost to Ft. Lauderdale in the quarterfinals.

The Kicks&#x27; last season was 1981. The team&#x27;s last regular-season game was August 19, 1981, a 2–1 home win at Met Stadium over the Dallas Tornado. The team&#x27;s last game at the Met was August 26, 1981, a 1–0 shootout playoff victory against the Tulsa Roughnecks. The team&#x27;s last game was played on September 6, 1981, a 3–0 home playoff loss to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers played at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Memorial Stadium due to a schedule conflict with the Minnesota Twins in front of only 10,722 fans. The team had planned to move to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome for the 1982 season.

The Kicks lost $2.5 million during the 1981 season. By the end of the 1981 season, the Kicks were up for sale, the team missed a payment for its players and office staff, NASL Commissioner Phil Woosnam was trying to find a buyer for the club, and the NASL announced it would play the 1981–82 indoor season without Minnesota. The Kicks folded in December 1981. The NASL conducted a dispersal draft on December 7, 1981, in which five Kicks players were selected: Ace Ntsoelengoe by Toronto, Ron Futcher by Portland, Tino Lettieri by Vancouver, David Stride by Fort Lauderdale, Randy Phillips by Tulsa, and Tim Twellman by Tulsa.

<text>The Guinea-Bissau national football team (Portuguese: Seleção nacional de futebol da Guiné-Bissau) represents Guinea-Bissau in men&#x27;s international association football and it is controlled by the Football Federation of Guinea-Bissau, The team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cups but qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations four times, making their debut in 2017. The team is a member of both FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF).

==History==
===World Cup qualifying===
Guinea-Bissau entered their first FIFA World Cup qualification with the aim of reaching the 1998 World Cup in France. The first round of African qualification required for them to play Guinea in a two-legged match. The first leg was held at home in the Estadio 24 de Setembro in Bissau on 1 June 1996 with an attendance of 15,000. Guinea-Bissau went 2–0 up at half-time after strikes from Pereira Tavares in 11th and 36th minutes. Guinea&#x27;s Titi Camara equalised with his own brace in the 53rd and 54th minutes. Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s Co Cipriano won the game with a 60th-minute penalty to make it 3–2. The away leg was held at the Stade du 28 Septembre in Conakry. Momo Soumah of Guinea scored to level the tie at half-time before Nando Có scored a bicycle kick for Guinea-Bissau to put his side 4–3 up on aggregate, however another goal from Momo Soumah and a winner from Tibou Bangoura won the match for Guinea, giving them a 5–4 lead on aggregate.

Guinea-Bissau had never progressed beyond the first round of qualification until the 2022 qualifiers where they defeated São Tomé and Príncipe 3–1 over two legs, thanks to three goals from Joseph Mendes.

===Africa Cup of Nations===
Guinea-Bissau first participated in AFCON qualification in 1994 where they defeated Cape Verde over three legs, but failed to register a single point in the second round as their draw against Togo was annulled after Togo withdrew from the competition. In 1996 Guinea-Bissau withdrew from qualification after a draw and two losses to begin the campaign, leading to their ban for 1998 AFCON.

Guinea-Bissau next entered qualification in 2006 where they lost 4–1 to Mali national football team and were again banned in 2008 for unpaid debts to CAF. In 2012 they secured a single win (1–0 against Kenya) and five losses to finish last in Group J. The following year they were eliminated 2–0 by Cameroon. In 2015, after beating Central African Republic 3–1, they lost to Botswana by the same scoreline.

For the 2017 qualifiers, Guinea-Bissau was drawn from Pot 4 into Group E and, despite being the lowest ranked nation in their group, achieved ten points and qualified for the 2017 tournament ahead of Congo, Zambia and Kenya. In their African Cup of Nations debut, Guinea-Bissau drew 1–1 with Gabon with a 91st-minute equaliser by Juary Soares. This was the only point they collected at the tournament and they were eliminated in the group stage.

Guinea-Bissau then also won their Group in the 2019 qualifiers to reach a second straight Finals. They again managed one draw (0–0 against Benin) and two losses and failed to progress to the knock-out stages.

On March 30, 2021, Guinea-Bissau went into their final qualifying match against Congo, needing a victory to qualify. They ended comfortable winners with goals from Piqueti, Frédéric Mendy and Jorginho to secure their third successive AFCON appearance.

<doc id="1263215" wikidata="Q4640177" url="?curid=1263215" title="Lanterman–Petris–Short Act">
<text>The Lanterman–Petris–Short (LPS) Act (Chapter 1667 of the 1967 California Statutes, codified as Cal. Welf &amp; Inst. Code, sec. 5000 et seq.) regulates involuntary civil commitment to a mental health institution in the state of California. The act set the precedent for modern mental health commitment procedures in the United States. The bipartisan bill was co-authored by California State Assemblyman Frank D. Lanterman (R) and California State Senators Nicholas C. Petris (D) and Alan Short (D), and signed into law in 1967 by Governor Ronald Reagan. The Act went into full effect on July 1, 1972. It cited seven articles of intent:
*To end the inappropriate, indefinite, and involuntary commitment of mentally disordered persons, people with developmental disabilities, and persons impaired by chronic alcoholism, and to eliminate legal disabilities;
*To provide prompt evaluation and treatment of persons with serious mental disorders or impaired by chronic alcoholism;
*To guarantee and protect public safety;
*To safeguard individual rights through judicial review;
*To provide individualized treatment, supervision, and placement services by a conservatorship program for gravely disabled persons;
*To encourage the full use of all existing agencies, professional personnel and public funds to accomplish these objectives and to prevent duplication of services and unnecessary expenditures;
*To protect mentally disordered persons and developmentally disabled persons from criminal acts.

The Act in effect ended all hospital commitments by the judiciary system, except in the case of criminal sentencing, &quot;e.g.&quot;, convicted sexual offenders, and those who were &quot;gravely disabled&quot;, defined as unable to obtain food, clothing, or housing. It did not, however, impede the right of voluntary commitments. It expanded the evaluative reach of psychiatrists and created provisions and criteria for holds.

Prior to 1987 it was assumed that the Act allowed involuntary treatment for those who were detained under an initial three-day hold (for evaluation and treatment) and a subsequent fourteen-day hospitalization (for those people declared after the three-day hold to be dangerous to themselves or others or gravely disabled). However, in the 1987 case of &quot;Riese v. St. Mary’s Hospital and Medical Center&quot;, the California Court of Appeal declared that these people had the right to exercise informed consent regarding the use of antipsychotic drugs, except in an emergency, and if they rejected medication &quot;a judicial determination of their incapacity to make treatment decisions&quot; was required before they could be involuntarily treated. This case was a class action suit brought in the name of person Eleanor Riese by the California ACLU. Eleanor Riese&#x27;s story is depicted in the movie &quot;55 Steps&quot;.

== LPS evaluation, detention, and conservatorship process ==
Under the LPS Act, individuals can be detained into a locked psychiatric facility in the following process:

=== 5150 hold ===
Under California Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) 5150, an individual can be involuntarily placed in a locked psychiatric facility for an evaluation for up to 72 hours. Any peace officer or specific individuals authorized by a county government may place the hold. Three criteria apply – the individual is assessed to be a danger to themselves, a danger to others, or &quot;gravely disabled&quot;. Per WIC 5008, grave disability is defined as an individual&#x27;s lack of ability, due to their mental illness, to provide for their food, clothing, or shelter. In the case of children, it is the inability to use food, clothing, or shelter even if it is supplied.

It is not uncommon for police to be the party who places them on the 5150 hold and then takes the individual to the hospital for further assessment. Over the next 72 hours, the hospital or psychiatrist must determine the individual&#x27;s need for further locked psychiatric detainment. If the individual&#x27;s condition clears up and they are no longer a danger to others or themselves or gravely disabled, they are released from the hospital. If, however, they remain a danger to others or themselves or continue to be gravely disabled, the hospital/psychiatrist may then request a 5250 hold to thereby keep the individual in the hospital beyond the 72-hour limit of the 5150 hold.

==== In popular culture ====
Largely because many American movies and television programs are primarily produced in California, usage of the term &quot;5150&quot; has spread beyond its original location and user population. An album of the same name by the California hard rock band Van Halen was named directly for the code section, and several derivative uses followed.

=== 5250 hold ===
If, after a 72-hour hold, an individual is deemed to still be a danger to others or themselves, or is gravely disabled, WIC 5250 permits an individual to be involuntarily held (in a locked psychiatric hospital) for an additional 14 days.

Unlike a 5150 hold, a 5250 hold requires that the individual served receive a court hearing within 4 days of being served to ascertain the validity of the hold. Court hearings are often held in the hospital. Individuals are provided an attorney and a county court officer reviews the evidence for the hold presented by the hospital, hears the argument of the client and their attorney, and decides whether or not to uphold the 5250.

Just as with the 5150 hold, during the 5250 hold, the individual is continually being assessed by psychiatric staff. Again, if the individual is (at any time) deemed to be no longer a danger or gravely disabled, they are then released from the hospital.

According to section 5257 of the act, the individual must be released after 14 days, unless: they agree to further treatment on a voluntary basis, they are certified for an additional 14 days of intensive treatment, they are certified for an additional 30 days of intensive treatment, they are the subject of a conservatorship (commonly known as a Temporary LPS Conservatorship) petition, or they are the subject of a petition for post-certification treatment of a dangerous person.

=== 5350 hold (temporary LPS conservatorship) ===
A 5350 hold, otherwise known as a temporary LPS conservatorship (under W&amp;I Code § 5352.1), is initiated at the end of a 14-day hold. Such is initiated by the individual&#x27;s treating psychiatrist and co-signed by the medical director of the psychiatric facility to the Public Guardian Office in the individual&#x27;s county of residence. The basis for the LPS temporary conservatorship is that the individual (due to their mental illness, even after ~17 days of involuntary psychiatric detention) remains &quot;gravely disabled.&quot;

There are 58 counties in California, each with its own independent Public Guardian Office. Unlike other conservatorship processes in California (probate/older adult or limited/developmentally disabled) - a LPS conservatorship cannot be initiated by the public at large. Codified in the WIC - the individual must go through the 5150 - 5250 process and from there the county Public Guardian is the only authorized party to be able to request for a LPS conservatorship. The legislative intent for such was that prior to the LPS Act, it was felt individuals were often psychiatrically committed for subjective (if not outright punitive) reasons. To combat such potential abuses, the county Public Guardian, seen as an impartial third party, was designated as sole party.

Once the individual is on a LPS temporary conservatorship, they are no longer legally on a &quot;hold,&quot; but now, legal consent to treat and continue to detain the individual (now known as the &quot;conservatee&quot;) lies with the Public Guardian office.

A temporary LPS conservatorship can last a maximum of 180 days. As the county superior court has direct oversight of LPS conservatorship matters, typically the conservatee is afforded court hearings (for status) every 30 days. Unlike other conservatorship hearing, LPS conservatorship matters/records are not open to the public.

With 58 counties, the Public Guardian Offices and Superior Courts may interpret and practice differing methods of legal administration of LPS conservatorship. In general, all conservatees are appointed legal counsel (typically from the public defender&#x27;s office), and during the course of their LPS conservatorship, they can ask for a series of writs and hearings or even a full jury trial to contest their detention and overall LPS conservatorship. It is not uncommon for a psychiatrist to conversely declare the conservatee is no longer gravely disabled. During the course of the LPS conservatorship, if the conservatee stabilizes and can thereby be discharged to the community, a psychiatrist can request that the LPS conservatorship be dismissed (for lack of legal support).

During a temporary LPS conservatorship, it is the general duty of the Public Guardian Office to ensure the conservatee is properly cared for and that the conservatee continues to require locked psychiatric care.

During the LPS temporary conservatorship, it is indeed the Public Guardian, not the conservatee, who consents to treatment and placement. A common way to understand this is to think of the relationship as that of a parent to a child - in that a minor child cannot consent to medical care. The same goes for the conservatee - in that the Public Guardian consents to his or her psychiatric treatment and placement.

If during the LPS temporary conservatorship, the Public Guardian feels the conservatee will (for the foreseeable future) need to remain in locked psychiatric care - the Public Guardian can then seek to have the LPS conservatorship changed from temporary to general (also referred to as &quot;Permanent&quot; but this can be a misnomer as it is neither permanent nor indefinite). With the appointment of a permanent LPS conservatorship (approved by the court) - the conservatee is now under the care / authority of the LPS conservator for exactly 1 year. It is with a permanent LPS conservatorship that then the public (family / friends) can now become involved. Upon request, pending court approval, family and/or friends (unlike the temporary LPS conservatorship) can be appointed general / permanent LPS conservator for the conservatee.

The 1-year duration for a general / permanent LPS conservatorship was again codified into the LPS Act to combat past abuses. This ensures that no individual is indefinitely detained in locked psychiatric care and that every year justification to continue the LPS conservatorship is brought before the court. This is another difference between LPS conservatorship and probate or limited conservatorship - both of which have no explicit expiration date. Indeed, if the LPS conservator does not submit a request to the court to renew the LPS conservatorship, by default it expires. Renewal of the LPS conservatorship requires that two mental health professionals formally declare that the LPS conservatorship still remains appropriate.

During a general / permanent LPS conservatorship, the conservatee is most likely held in long-term, locked psychiatric care. Although California state hospitals still exist and are in use, most LPS conservatees are placed at local (county level) psychiatric hospitals. Nothing in the LPS Act precludes a conservatee being under a LPS conservatorship and living in the community. No time frame is quantified in the LPS Act (as matters vary from conservatee to conservatee), but, in general, amongst the 58 county Public Guardian Offices, if a conservatee has been living in the community for an extended period of time, the legal justification to continue the LPS conservatorship diminishes and the conservatorship is likely to be dismissed. As such there is no common duration for a LPS conservatorship. It can indeed vary from a single LPS conservatorship lasting 30 years to multiple temporary LPS conservatorships being implemented over the course of a single year.

Some family of mentally ill individuals believe that the LPS act favors the individual&#x27;s civil rights too much when weighed against their self-evident need for treatment. It can be very difficult for their family member to be placed on a 5150 hold or on a LPS conservatorship. The LPS Act requires a &quot;grave disability&quot; to provide oneself with food, clothing, or shelter. Some argued that revisions should be made to make it easier for individuals to be detained, lessening the restrictions required under the LPS Act.

In 2018, SB 1045 was signed into California law, establishing a pilot program in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego counties, if the counties approve. It would allow for the creation of a conservatorship for a person who is unable to care for his or her own health and well-being due to serious mental illness and substance use disorder. SB 1045 provides the least restrictive and most clinically appropriate alternative needed for the protection of persons incapable of caring for their own health.

<text>Rotator cuff tendinopathy is a process of senescence. The pathophysiology is mucoid degeneration. Most people develop rotator cuff tendinopathy within their lifetime.

As part of rotator cuff tendinopathy, the tendon can thin and develop a defect. This defect is often referred to as a rotator cuff tear. Acute, traumatic rupture of the rotator cuff tendons can also occur, but is less common. Traumatic rupture of the rotator cuff usually involves the tendons of more than one muscle.
Rotator cuff tendinopathy is, by far, the most common reason people seek care for shoulder pain. Pain related to rotator cuff tendinopathy is typically on the front side of the shoulder, down to the elbow, and worse reaching up or back. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and examination. Medical imaging is used mostly to plan surgery and is not needed for diagnosis.
Treatment may include pain medication such as NSAIDs and specific exercises. It is recommended that people who are unable to raise their arm above 90 degrees after two weeks should be further assessed. Surgery may be offered for acute ruptures and large attritional defects with good quality muscle. The benefits of surgery for smaller defects are unclear as of 2019.

==Signs and symptoms==
Rotator cuff tendinopathy is often asymptomatic even when there is thinning or a full thickness defect. Rotator cuff defects are common on &quot;post mortem&quot; and MRI studies in those without any history of shoulder pain or symptoms. Rotator cuff tendinopathy is associated with pain over the front and side (anterolateral) of the shoulder pain that radiates towards the elbow. The pain may occur with shoulder movement above the horizontal position, shoulder flexion and abduction. Pain is often described as weakness. Actual muscle weakness does not correlate with symptoms of weakness. Symptom severity does not correlate with rotator cuff defect size and associated muscle quality.

==Risk factors==
Epidemiological studies strongly support a relationship between age and cuff tear prevalence, with the most common cause being age-related degeneration and, less frequently, sports injuries or trauma.

Those most prone to failed rotator cuff syndrome are people 65 years of age or older; and those with large, sustained tears. Smokers, people with diabetes, individuals with muscle atrophy or fatty infiltration, and those who do not follow postoperative-care recommendations also are at greater risk. In a 2008 study the frequency of such tears increased from 13% in the youngest group (aged 50–59 y) to 20% (aged 60–69 y), 31% (aged 70–79 y), and 51% in the oldest group (aged 80–89 y).

Some risk factors, such as increased age and height, cannot be changed. Increased body mass index is also associated with tearing. Recurrent lifting and overhead motions are at risk for rotator cuff injury as well. This includes jobs that involve repetitive overhead work, such as carpenters, painters, custodians, and servers. People who play sports that involve overhead motions, such as swimming, water polo, volleyball, baseball, and tennis, and American football quarterbacks are at a greater risk of experiencing a rotator cuff tear. Striking-based combat sports, such as boxing, also account for severe rotator cuff injuries in competitors, typically when their punches miss the target, or overusing the shoulder by throwing an excessively large number of punches. Certain track-and-field activities, such as shot put and javelin throw are also of considerable risk, especially when athletes perform outdoors under cold weather conditions or neglect warming-up procedures; proper warm-up of the throwing and/or swinging arm can help reduce the stress on the musculature of the shoulder girdle. Corticosteroid injections around the tendons increase the risk of tendon tear and delay tendon healing.

==Mechanisms of injury==
The shoulder is a complex mechanism involving bones, ligaments, joints, muscles, and tendons.

The two main causes are acute injury or chronic and cumulative degeneration of the shoulder joint. Mechanisms can be extrinsic, intrinsic or a combination of both.

The cuff is responsible for stabilizing the glenohumeral joint to allow abduction and rotation of the humerus. When trauma occurs, these functions can be compromised. Because individuals are dependent on the shoulder for many activities, overuse can lead to tears, with the vast majority being in the supraspinatus tendon.

The role of the supraspinatus is to resist downward motion, both while the shoulder is relaxed and carrying weight. Supraspinatus tears usually occurs at its insertion on the humeral head at the greater tubercle. Though the supraspinatus is the most commonly injured tendon in the rotator cuff, the other three can also be injured at the same time.

===Acute tears===
The amount of stress needed to acutely tear a rotator cuff tendon will depend on the underlying condition of the tendon. If healthy, the stress needed will be high, such as with a fall on the outstretched arm. This stress may occur coincidentally with other injuries such as a dislocation of the shoulder or separation of the acromioclavicular joint. In the case of a tendon with pre-existing degeneration, the force may be more modest, such as with a sudden lift, particularly with the arm above the horizontal position. The type of loading involved with injury is usually eccentric, such as when two people are carrying a load and one lets go, forcing the other to maintain force while the muscle elongates.

===Chronic tears===
Chronic tears are indicative of extended use in conjunction with other factors such as poor biomechanics or muscular imbalance. Ultimately, most are the result of wear that occurs slowly over time as a natural part of aging. They are more common in the dominant arm, but a tear in one shoulder signals an increased risk of a tear in the opposing shoulder.

Several factors contribute to degenerative, or chronic, rotator cuff tears of which repetitive stress is the most significant. This stress consists of repeating the same shoulder motions frequently, such as overhead throwing, rowing, and weightlifting. Many jobs that require frequent shoulder movement such as lifting and overhead movements also contribute. In older populations impairment of blood supply can also be an issue. With age, circulation to the rotator cuff tendons decreases, impairing natural ability to repair, increasing risk for tear. Another potential contributing cause is impingement syndrome, the most common non-sports related injury and which occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles become irritated and inflamed while passing through the subacromial space beneath the acromion. This relatively small space becomes even smaller when the arm is raised in a forward or upward position. Repetitive impingement can inflame the tendons and bursa, resulting in the syndrome.

===Extrinsic factors===

Well-documented anatomic factors include the morphologic characteristics of the acromion, a bony projection from the scapula that curves over the shoulder joint. Hooked, curved, and laterally sloping acromia are strongly associated with cuff tears and may cause damage through direct traction on the tendon. Conversely, flat acromia may have an insignificant involvement in cuff disease and consequently may be best treated conservatively. The development of these different acromial shapes is likely both genetic and acquired. In the latter case, there can be a progression from flat to curved or hooked with increasing age. Repetitive mechanical activities such as sports and exercise may contribute to flattening and hooking of the acromion. Cricket bowling, swimming, tennis, baseball, and kayaking are often implicated. Progression to a hooked acromion could be an adaptation to an already damaged, poorly balanced rotator cuff with resultant stress on the coracoacromial arch. Other anatomical factors include an os acromiale and acromial spurs. Environmental factors include age, shoulder overuse, smoking, and medical conditions that affect circulation or impair the inflammatory and healing response, such as diabetes mellitus.

===Intrinsic factors===

Intrinsic factors refer to injury mechanisms that occur within the rotator cuff itself. The principal is a degenerative-microtrauma model, which supposes that age-related tendon damage compounded by chronic microtrauma results in partial tendon tears that then develop into full rotator cuff tears. As a result of repetitive microtrauma in the setting of a degenerative rotator cuff tendon, inflammatory mediators alter the local environment and oxidative stress induces tenocyte apoptosis, causing further rotator cuff tendon degeneration. A neural theory also exists that suggests neural overstimulation leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and may also contribute to tendon degeneration.

===Surgical considerations===
Depending upon the diagnosis, several treatment alternatives are available. They include revision repair, non-anatomic repair, tendon transfer, and arthroplasty. When possible, surgeons make tension-free repairs in which they use grafted tissues rather than stitching to reconnect tendon segments. This can result in a complete repair. Other options are a partial repair, and reconstruction involving a bridge of biologic or synthetic substances. Partial repairs are typically performed on retracted cuff tears.

Tendon transfers are prescribed for young, active cuff-tear individuals who experience weakness and decreased range of motion, but little pain. The technique is not considered appropriate for older people or those with pre-operative stiffness or nerve injuries. People diagnosed with glenohumeral arthritis and rotator cuff anthropathy have the alternative of total shoulder arthroplasty, if the cuff is largely intact or repairable. If the cuff is incompetent, a reverse shoulder arthroplasty is available and, although not as robust a prosthesis, does not require an intact cuff to maintain a stable joint.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is based upon physical assessment and history, including description of previous activities and acute or chronic symptoms. A systematic physical examination of the shoulder comprises inspection, palpation, range of motion, provocative tests to reproduce the symptoms, neurological examination, and strength testing. The shoulder should also be examined for tenderness and deformity. Since pain arising from the neck is frequently &#x27;referred&#x27; to the shoulder, the examination should include an assessment of the cervical spine looking for evidence suggestive of a pinched nerve, osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis.

Neer promoted the concept of three stages of rotator cuff disease. Stage I, according to Neer, occurred in those younger than 25 years and involved edema and hemorrhage of the tendon and bursa. Stage II involved tendinitis and fibrosis of the rotator cuff in 25- to 40-year-olds. Stage III involved tearing of the rotator cuff (partial or full thickness) and occurred in those older than 40 years. For surgical purposes, tears are also described by location, size or area, and depth. Further subclasses include the acromiohumeral distance, acromial shape, fatty infiltration or degeneration of muscles, muscle atrophy, tendon retraction, vascular proliferation, chondroid metaplasia, and calcification. Again, in surgical planning, age-related degeneration of thinning and disorientation of the collagen fibers, myxoid degeneration, and hyaline degeneration are considered.

Diagnostic modalities, dependent on circumstances, include X-ray, MRI, MR arthrography, double-contrast arthrography, and ultrasound. Although MR arthrography is currently considered the gold standard, ultrasound may be most cost-effective. Usually, a tear will be undetected by X-ray, although bone spurs, which can impinge upon the rotator cuff tendons, may be visible. Such spurs suggest chronic severe rotator cuff disease. Double-contrast arthrography involves injecting contrast dye into the shoulder joint to detect leakage out of the injured rotator cuff, and its value is influenced by the experience of the operator. The most common diagnostic tool is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can sometimes indicate the size of the tear, as well as its location within the tendon. Furthermore, MRI enables the detection or exclusion of complete rotator cuff tears with reasonable accuracy and is also suitable for diagnosing other pathologies of the shoulder joint.

The logical use of diagnostic tests is an important component of effective clinical practice.

Clinical judgement, rather than over-reliance on MRI or any other modality, is strongly advised in determining the cause of shoulder pain, or planning its treatment, since rotator cuff tears are also found in some without pain or symptoms. The role of X-ray, MRI, and ultrasound is adjunctive to clinical assessment and serves to confirm a diagnosis provisionally made by a thorough history and physical examination. Over-reliance on imaging may lead to overtreatment or distract from the true dysfunction causing symptoms.

===Symptoms===
Symptoms may occur immediately after trauma (acute) or develop over time (chronic).

Acute injury is less frequent than chronic disease, but may follow bouts of forcefully raising the arm against resistance, as occurs in weightlifting, for example. In addition, falling forcefully on the shoulder can cause acute symptoms. These traumatic tears predominantly affect the supraspinatus tendon or the rotator interval and symptoms include severe pain that radiates through the arm, and limited range of motion, specifically during abduction of the shoulder.
Chronic tears occur among individuals who constantly participate in overhead activities, such as pitching or swimming, but can also develop from shoulder tendinitis or rotator cuff disease. Symptoms arising from chronic tears include sporadic worsening of pain, debilitation, and atrophy of the muscles; noticeable pain during rest; crackling sensations (crepitus) when moving the shoulder; and inability to move or lift the arm sufficiently, especially during abduction and flexion motions.

Pain in the anterolateral aspect of the shoulder is not specific to the shoulder, and may arise from, and be referred from, the neck, heart, or gut.

Symptoms will often include pain or ache over the front and outer aspect of the shoulder, pain aggravated by leaning on the elbow and pushing upward on the shoulder (such as leaning on the armrest of a reclining chair), intolerance of overhead activity, pain at night when lying directly on the affected shoulder, and pain when reaching forward (e.g., unable to lift a gallon of milk from the refrigerator). Weakness may be reported, but is often masked by pain and is usually found only through examination. With longer-standing pain, the shoulder is favored and gradually loss of motion and weakness may develop, which, due to pain and guarding, are often unrecognized and only brought to attention during the physical exam.

Primary shoulder problems may cause pain over the deltoid muscle intensified by abduction against resistance – the impingement sign. This signifies pain arising from the rotator cuff, but cannot distinguish among inflammation, strain, or tear. Individuals may report that they are unable to reach upward to brush their hair or to lift a can of food from an overhead shelf.

===Signs===
No single physical examination test distinguishes reliably between bursitis, partial-thickness, and full-thickness tears. The most useful single test for infraspinatous tendon tears is the drop sign (the examiner lifts the arm straight out from the body with the palm up, the person then needs to hold it there for 10 seconds) and the external rotation lag sign (with the arm by the side and the elbow bent to 90 degrees the person tries to rotate outwards against resistance).

A combination of tests seems to provide the most accurate diagnosis. For impingement, these tests include the Hawkins-Kennedy impingement sign, in which an examiner medially rotates the injured individual&#x27;s flexed arm, forcing the supraspinatus tendon against the coracoacromial ligament and so producing pain if the test is positive, a positive painful arc sign, and weakness in external rotation with the arm at the side. Another common impingement test is the neer test. The neer test is performed by the examiner maximally forward flexing the patient&#x27;s arm with the scapula in a depressed position. Localized pain on the anterior shoulder suggests subacromial impingement, whereas posterior shoulder pain suggests internal impingement.
For the diagnosis of full-thickness rotator cuff tear, the best combination appears to include once more the painful arc and weakness in external rotation, and in addition, the drop arm sign. This test is also known as Codman&#x27;s test. The arm is raised to the side to 90° by the examiner. The injured individual then attempts to lower the arm back to neutral with palm down. If the arm drops suddenly or pain is experienced, the test is considered positive.

===MRI===
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are comparable in efficacy and helpful in diagnosis, although both have a false positive rate of 15–20%. MRI can reliably detect most full-thickness tears, although very small pinpoint tears may be missed. In such situations, an MRI combined with an injection of contrast material, an MR-arthrogram, may help to confirm the diagnosis. It should be realized that a normal MRI cannot fully rule out a small tear (a false negative) while partial-thickness tears are not as reliably detected. While MRI is sensitive in identifying tendon degeneration (tendinopathy), it may not reliably distinguish between a degenerative tendon and a partially torn tendon. Again, magnetic resonance arthrography can improve the differentiation. An overall sensitivity of 91% (9% false negative rate) has been reported, indicating that magnetic resonance arthrography is reliable in the detection of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. However, its routine use is not advised, since it involves entering the joint with a needle, with the potential risk of infection. Consequently, the test is reserved for cases in which the diagnosis remains unclear.

===Ultrasound===
Musculoskeletal ultrasound has been advocated by experienced practitioners, avoiding the radiation of X-ray and the expense of MRI while demonstrating comparable accuracy to MRI for identifying and measuring the size of full-thickness and partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. This modality can also reveal the presence of other conditions that may mimic rotator cuff tear at clinical examination, including tendinosis, calcific tendinitis, subacromial subdeltoid bursitis, greater tuberosity fracture, and adhesive capsulitis. However, MRI provides more information about adjacent structures in the shoulder, such as the capsule, glenoid labrum muscles, and bone, and these factors should be considered in each case when selecting the appropriate study.

===Xray===
X-ray projectional radiography cannot directly reveal tears of the rotator cuff, a &#x27;soft tissue&#x27;, and consequently, normal X-rays cannot exclude a damaged cuff. However, indirect evidence of pathology may be seen in instances where one or more of the tendons has undergone degenerative calcification (calcific tendinitis). The humeral head may migrate upward (high-riding humeral head) secondary to tears of the infraspinatus, or combined tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The migration can be measured by the distance between:
* A line crossing the center of a line between the superior and inferior rims of the glenoid articular surface (blue in image).
* The center of a &quot;best-fit&quot; circle positioned over the humeral articular surface (green in image)
Normally, the former is positioned inferiorly to the latter, and a reversal therefore indicates a rotator cuff tear. Prolonged contact between a high-riding humeral head and the acromion above it may lead to X-ray findings of wear on the humeral head and acromion; secondary degenerative arthritis of the glenohumeral joint (the ball and socket joint of the shoulder), called cuff arthropathy, may follow. Incidental X-ray findings of bone spurs at the adjacent acromioclavicular joint may show a bone spur growing from the outer edge of the clavicle downward toward the rotator cuff. Spurs may also be seen on the underside of the acromion, once thought to cause direct fraying of the rotator cuff from contact friction, a concept currently regarded as controversial.

===In-office testing===
As part of clinical decision-making, a simple, minimally invasive, in-office procedure, the rotator cuff impingement test, may be performed. A small amount of a local anesthetic and an injectable corticosteroid are injected into the subacromial space to block pain and provide anti-inflammatory relief. If pain disappears and shoulder function remains good, no further testing is pursued. The test helps to confirm that the pain arises primarily from the shoulder, rather than being referred from the neck, heart, or gut.

If pain is relieved, the test is considered positive for rotator-cuff impingement, of which tendinitis and bursitis are major causes. However, partial rotator-cuff tears may also demonstrate good pain relief, so a positive response cannot rule out a partial rotator-cuff tear. However, with demonstration of good, pain-free function, the treatment will not change, so the test is useful in helping to avoid overtesting or performing unnecessary surgery.

===Classification===

Tears of the rotator cuff tendon are described as partial or full thickness, and full thickness with complete detachment of the tendons from bone.
* Partial-thickness tears often appear as fraying of an intact tendon.
* Full-thickness tears are &quot;through-and-through&quot;. These tears can be small pinpoint or larger buttonhole, or involve the majority of the tendon where it still remains substantially attached to the humeral head and thus maintains function.
* Full-thickness tears may also involve complete detachment of the tendon(s) from the humeral head and may result in significantly impaired shoulder motion and function.

Shoulder pain is variable and may not be proportional to the size of the tear.

Tears are also sometimes classified based on the trauma that caused the injury:
* Acute, as a result of a sudden, powerful movement which might include falling onto an outstretched hand at speed, making a sudden thrust with a paddle in kayaking, or following a powerful pitch/throw
* Subacute, arising in similar situations but occurring in one of the five layers of the shoulder anatomy
* Chronic, developing over time, and usually occurring at or near the tendon (as a result of the tendon rubbing against the overlying bone), and usually associated with an impingement syndrome.

==Prevention==
Long-term overuse/abuse of the shoulder joint is generally thought to limit range of motion and productivity due to daily wear and tear of the muscles, and many public web sites offer preventive advice. (See external links)
The recommendations usually include:
* regular shoulder exercises to maintain strength and flexibility
* using proper form when lifting or moving heavy weights
* resting the shoulder when experiencing pain
* application of cold packs and heat pads to a painful, inflamed shoulder
* strengthening program to include the back and shoulder girdle muscles as well as the chest, shoulder and upper arm
* adequate rest periods in occupations that require repetitive lifting and reaching

===Size===
According to a study which measured tendon length against the size of the injured rotator cuff, researchers learned that as rotator cuff tendons decrease in length, the average rotator cuff tear severity is proportionally decreased, as well. This shows that larger individuals are more likely to develop a severe rotator cuff tear if they do not &quot;tighten the shoulder muscles around the joint&quot;. 

===Position===
Another study observed 12 different positions of movements and their relative correlation with injuries occurred during those movements. The evidence shows that putting the arm in a neutral position relieves tension on all ligaments and tendons.

===Stretching===
One article observed the influence of stretching techniques on preventive methods of shoulder injuries. Increased velocity of exercise increases injury, but beginning a fast-movement exercise with a slow stretch may cause muscle/tendon attachment to become more resistant to tearing.

===Muscle groups===
When exercising, exercising the shoulder as a whole and not one or two muscle groups is also found to be imperative. When the shoulder muscle is exercised in all directions, such as external rotation, flexion, and extension, or vertical abduction, it is less likely to develop a tear of the tendon.

==Treatment==
A rotator cuff tear can be treated operatively or non-operatively. No benefit is seen from early rather than delayed surgery, and many with partial tears and some with complete tears will respond to nonoperative management. Consequently, an individual may begin with nonsurgical management. However, early surgical treatment may be considered in significant (&gt;1 cm – 1.5 cm) acute tears, in young individuals with full-thickness tears who have a significant risk for the development of irreparable rotator cuff damage, or the patient is very active and/or uses their arms for overhead work or sports.

Rotator-cuff surgery appears to result in similar benefits as nonoperative management. As a conservative approach has less complications and is less expensive it is recommended as initial treatment.

Proper treatment decisions really depend on the circumstance of the patient, considering factors such as medical condition, functional demands, extent and severity of the tear, and previous history.

===Non-operative treatment===
Those with pain but reasonably maintained function are suitable for nonoperative management. This includes medications that provide pain relief such as anti-inflammatory agents, topical pain relievers such as cold packs, and if warranted, subacromial corticosteroid or local anesthetic injection. Topical glyceryl trinitrate appears effective at relieving acute symptoms however, headaches were reported as a side effect. A sling may be offered for short-term comfort, with the understanding that undesirable shoulder stiffness can develop with prolonged immobilization. Early physical therapy may afford pain relief with modalities (e.g. iontophoresis) and help to maintain motion. Ultrasound treatment is not efficacious. As pain decreases, strength deficiencies and biomechanical errors can be corrected.

Shock wave therapy has seen widespread use since the 1990s to treat various musculoskeletal disorders including rotator cuff disease, but evidence of its efficacy remains dubious. In a review of 2020, the benefits and harms of shock wave therapy for rotator cuff disease, with or without calcificationcurrently, were investigated. They found low to moderate certainty evidence, that there were very few clinically important benefits of shock wave therapy, and uncertainty regarding its safety.

A conservative physical therapy program begins with preliminary rest and restriction from engaging in activities which gave rise to symptoms. Normally, inflammation can usually be controlled within one to two weeks, using a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and subacromial steroid injections to decrease inflammation, to the point that pain has been significantly decreased to make stretching tolerable. After this short period, rapid stiffening and an increase in pain can result if sufficient stretching has not been implemented.

A gentle, passive range-of-motion program should be started to help prevent stiffness and maintain range of motion during this resting period. Stiffness negatively affects the tendon-bone healing process, a critical part of recovery. Stiffness during rehabilitation is related to worse clinical outcomes, so it is important for the patient to understand the importance of a proactive regimen. Strain induced tendon remodeling, which is part of an accelerated rehabilitation protocol, has been shown to speed up the time to return to daily activities. Exercises, for the anterior, inferior, and posterior shoulder, should be part of this program. Codman exercises (giant, pudding-stirring), to &quot;permit the patient to abduct the arm by gravity, the supraspinatus remains relaxed, and no fulcrum is required&quot; are widely used. The use of NSAIDs, hot and cold packs, and physical therapy modalities, such as ultrasound, phonophoresis, or iontophoresis, can be instituted during this stretching period, if effective. Corticosteroid injections are recommended two to three months apart with a maximum of three injections. Multiple injections (four or more) have been shown to compromise the results of rotator cuff surgery which result in weakening of the tendon. Kinesio taping was compared to sham taping and other conservative treatment for the approach of the rotator cuff disease and has uncertain effects in terms of self‐reported pain, function, pain on motion and active range of motion.

Rockwood coined the term orthotherapy to describe the program which is aimed at creating an exercise regimen that initially gently improves motion, then gradually improves strength in the shoulder girdle. This program involves a home therapy kit which includes elastic bands of six different colors and strengths, a pulley set, and a three-piece, one-meter-long stick. The program is individually customized. Participants are asked to use their exercise program whether at home, work, or traveling.

===Surgery===

Benefits of surgery are unclear as of 2019. Several instances when surgery may be recommended include:
* 20 to 30-year-old active person with an acute tear and severe functional deficit from a specific event
* 30 to 50-year-old person with an acute rotator cuff tear secondary to a specific event
* a highly competitive athlete who is primarily involved in overhead or throwing sports

These individuals more often benefit from operative treatment because they are willing to tolerate the risks of surgery to return to their preoperative level of function, and have higher likelihood of a successful outcome. Those who do not respond to, or are unsatisfied with, conservative treatment can seek a surgical opinion.

The three general surgical approaches are arthroscopic, mini open, and open-surgical repair.
In the past, small tears were treated arthroscopically, while larger tears would usually require an open procedure. Advances in arthroscopy now allow arthroscopic repair of even the largest tears, and arthroscopic techniques are now required to mobilize many retracted tears. The results match open surgical techniques, while permitting a more thorough evaluation of the shoulder at time of surgery, increasing the diagnostic value of the procedure, as other conditions may simultaneously cause shoulder pain. Arthroscopic surgery also allows for shorter recovery time although differences in postoperative pain or pain medication use are not seen between arthroscopic- and open-surgery. A 2015 study suggests that surgery is not clearly superior to conservative treatment in terms of functional outcomes at 1 year. However, there were small but significant benefits in pain reduction and disability improvement for those who underwent surgery. A 2019 review found that the evidence does not support decompression surgery in those with more than 3 months of shoulder pain without a history of trauma. 

Even for full-thickness rotator cuff tears, conservative care (i.e., nonsurgical treatment) outcomes are usually reasonably good.

If a significant bone spur is present, any of the approaches may include an acromioplasty, a subacromial decompression, as part of the procedure. Subacromial decompression, removal of a small portion of the acromion that overlies the rotator cuff, aims to relieve pressure on the rotator cuff in certain conditions and promote healing and recovery. Although subacromial decompression may be beneficial in the management of partial and full-thickness tear repair, it does not repair the tear itself and arthroscopic decompression has more recently been combined with &quot;mini-open&quot; repair of the rotator cuff, allowing for the repair of the cuff without disruption of the deltoid origin. The results of decompression alone tend to degrade with time, but the combination of repair and decompression appears to be more enduring. Subacromial decompression may not improve pain, function, or quality of life.

Repair of a complete, full-thickness tear involves tissue suture. The method currently in favor is to place an anchor in the bone at the natural attachment site, with resuture of torn tendon to the anchor. If tissue quality is poor, mesh (collagen, Artelon, or other degradable material) may be used to reinforce the repair. Repair can be performed through an open incision, again requiring detachment of a portion of the deltoid, while a mini-open technique approaches the tear through a deltoid-splitting approach. The latter may cause less injury to muscle and produce better results. Contemporary techniques now use an all arthroscopic approach.
Recovery can take as long as three–six months, with a sling being worn for the first one–six weeks. In the case of partial thickness tears, if surgery is undertaken, tear completion (converting the partial tear to a full tear) and then repair, is associated with better early outcomes than transtendinous repairs (where the intact fibres are preserved) and no difference in failure rates.

Biceps tenotomy and tenodesis are often performed concomitantly with rotator cuff repair or as separate procedures, and can also cause shoulder pain. Tenodesis, which may be performed as an arthroscopic or open procedure, generally restores pain free motion it the biceps tendon, or attached portion of the labrum, but can cause pain. Tenotomy is a shorter surgery requiring less rehabilitation, that is more often performed in older patients, though after surgery there can be a cosmetic &#x27;popeye sign&#x27; visible in thin arms.

In a small minority of cases where extensive arthritis has developed, an option is shoulder joint replacement (arthroplasty). Specifically, this is a reverse shoulder replacement, a more constrained form of shoulder arthroplasty that allows the shoulder to function well even in the presence of large full thickness rotator cuff tears.

==== Shoulder Replacement ====
The latest systematic reviews suggests (with low quality evidence) that total shoulder arthroplasty does not provide important benefits over hemiarthroplasty for glenohumeral osteoarthritis and rotator cuff tears. It highlighted the current lack of high-quality evidence and need for randomized controlled trials. 

===Biologics===
The main goal in biological augmentation is to enhance healing. There are a number of potential options. These include injecting an individual&#x27;s own stem cells, growth factors or platelet rich plasma (PRP) into the repair site, and installing scaffolds as biological or synthetic supports to maintain tissue contour. A 2014 Cochrane review evaluated PRP and found insufficient evidence to make recommendations. Mesenchymal stem cells have no convincing evidence for their use overall, with quality human trials lacking. The greater tuberosity can also be microfractured to create a small blood clot just lateral to the repair site.

===Rehabilitation===
Rehabilitation after surgery consists of three stages. First, the arm is immobilized so that the muscle can heal. Second, when appropriate, a therapist assists with passive exercises to regain range of motion. Third, the arm is gradually exercised actively, with a goal of regaining and enhancing strength. The empty can and full can exercises are amongst the most effective at isolating and strengthening the supraspinatus.

Following arthroscopic rotator-cuff repair surgery, individuals need rehabilitation and physical therapy. Exercise decreases shoulder pain, strengthens the joint, and improves range of motion. Therapists, in conjunction with the surgeon, design exercise regimens specific to the individual and their injury.

Traditionally, after injury the shoulder is immobilized for six weeks before rehabilitation. However, the appropriate timing and intensity of therapy are subject to debate. Most surgeons advocate using the sling for at least six weeks, though others advocate early, aggressive rehabilitation. The latter group favors the use of passive motion, which allows an individual to move the shoulder without physical effort. Alternatively, some authorities argue that therapy should be started later and carried out more cautiously. Theoretically, that gives tissues time to heal; though there is conflicting data regarding the benefits of early immobilization. A study of rats suggested that it improved the strength of surgical repairs, while research on rabbits produced contrary evidence. Individuals with a history of rotator cuff injury, particularly those recovering from tears, are prone to re-injury. Rehabbing too soon or too strenuously might increase the risk of retear or failure to heal. However, no research has proven a link between early therapy and the incidence of re-tears. In some studies, those who received earlier and more aggressive therapy reported reduced shoulder pain, less stiffness and better range of motion. Other research has shown that accelerated rehab results in better shoulder function.

There is consensus amongst orthopedic surgeons and physical therapists regarding rotator cuff repair rehabilitation protocols. The timing and duration of treatments and exercises are based on biologic and biomedical factors involving the rotator cuff. For approximately two to three weeks following surgery, an individual experiences shoulder pain and swelling; no major therapeutic measures are instituted in this window other than oral pain medicine and ice. Those at risk of failure should usually be more conservative with rehabilitations.

That is followed by the &quot;proliferative&quot; and &quot;maturation and remodeling&quot; phases of healing, which ensues for the following six to ten weeks. The effect of active or passive motion during any of the phases is unclear, due to conflicting information and a shortage of clinical evidence. Gentle physical therapy guided motion is instituted at this phase, only to prevent stiffness of the shoulder; the rotator cuff remains fragile. At three months after surgery, physical therapy intervention changes substantially to focus on scapular mobilization and stretching of the glenohumeral joint. Once full passive motion is regained (at usually about four to four and a half months after surgery) strengthening exercises are the focus. The strengthening focuses on the rotator cuff and the upper back/scapular stabilizers. Typically at about six months after surgery, most have made a majority of their expected gains.

The objective in repairing a rotator cuff is to enable an individual to regain full function. Surgeons and therapists analyze outcomes in several ways. Based on examinations, they compile scores on tests; some examples are those created by the University of California at Los Angeles and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons. Other outcome measures include the Constant score; the Simple Shoulder Test; and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score. The tests assess range of motion and the degree of shoulder function.

Due to the conflicting information about the relative benefits of rehab conducted early or later, an individualized approach is necessary. The timing and nature of therapeutic activities are adjusted according to age and tissue integrity of the repair. Management is more complex in those who have had multiple tears.

For irreparable Rotator cuff tears which make up about 30% of total RCTs, conservative treatment such as anterior deltoid rehabilitation program has shown to increases range of motion and constant score.

==Prognosis==
While people with rotator cuff tears may not have any noticeable symptoms, studies have shown that, those with age related tears, over time 40% will have enlargement of the tear over a five-year period. Of those whose tears enlarge, 20% have no symptoms while 80% eventually develop symptoms.

Most usually regain function and experience less pain following surgery. For some, however, the joint continues to hurt. Weakness and a limited range of motion also may persist. Those who report such symptoms frequently are diagnosed with failed rotator cuff syndrome. There is no irrefutable evidence that rotator cuff surgery benefits more than non-surgical management and a percentage of individuals never regain full range of motion after surgery.

Arthroscopic procedures produce &quot;satisfactory results&quot; more than 90 percent of the time. However, 6-8 percent of patients have &quot;incompetent&quot; rotator cuffs because their repaired tendons either fail to heal or develop additional tears. In some cases, persistent rotator cuff type pain after surgery can be due to disease elsewhere. For example, cervical spine disease and can involve neck pain radiating into the shoulder. Suprascapular neuropathy, shoulder impingement, superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) tears and arthritis can all mimic rotator cuff disease and cause persistent pain that does not respond to rotator cuff surgery.

One possible long-term consequence result of a rotator cuff tear is called proximal humeral head migration, this is where the &quot;ball&quot; of the shoulder joint rests higher in the shoulder joint &quot;socket&quot; disrupting normal shoulder mechanics. Only tear size is an independent predictor of humeral migration. Tears extending into the infraspinatus tendon are associated with greater humeral migration than is seen with isolated supraspinatus tears.

==Epidemiology==

Rotator cuff tears are among the most common conditions affecting the shoulder.

A rotator cuff tear can be caused by the weakening of the rotator cuff tendons. This weakening can be caused by age or how often the rotator cuff is used. Adults over the age of 60 are more susceptible to a rotator cuff tear, with the overall frequency of tears increasing with age. By the age of 50 10% of people with normal shoulders have a rotator cuff tear.

In an autopsy study of rotator cuff tears, the incidence of partial tears was 28%, and of complete rupture 30%. Frequently, tears occurred on both sides and occurred more often with females and with increasing age. Other cadaver studies have noted intratendinous tears to be more frequent (7.2%) than bursal-sided (2.4%) or articular-sided tears (3.6%). However, clinically, articular-sided tears are found to be 2 to 3 times more common than bursal-sided tears and among a population of young athletes, articular-sided tears constituted 91% of all partial-thickness tears. Rotator cuff tears may be more common in men between the ages of 50–60, though between 70 and 80 there is minimal difference across genders.

In terms of the size of tears, a study compared the ages of patient to the size of tears. It was emphasized the older you are, the more massive of a tear you will have. It was found that mean age increased with larger tear sizes (small tears 59 years, medium tears 62 years, large tears 64 years, and massive tears 66 years).

 &quot;title&quot;: &quot;New Jersey State Highway Renumbering 1927.map&quot;
&lt;/mapframe&gt;
In 1927, New Jersey&#x27;s state highways were renumbered. The old system, which had been defined in sequence by the legislature since 1916, was growing badly, as several routes shared the same number, and many unnumbered state highways had been defined. A partial renumbering was proposed in 1926, but instead a total renumbering was done in 1927.

Some amendments were made in 1929, including the elimination of Route 18N (by merging it into Route 1), and the addition of more spurs, as well as Route 29A, but the system stayed mostly intact until the 1953 renumbering.

== Proposed 1926 Renumbering ==
A partial renumbering was proposed in 1926 to get rid of the duplicates and assigning numbers to many of the unnumbered routes. The proposed 1926 renumbering would have:

* extended Route 4 over Route 19
* renumbered Route 17N to Route 17
* renumbered Route 18N to Route 18
* renumbered Route 18S to Route 19
* designated Route 21 from Trenton to Buttzville
* renumbered Route 17S to Route 22
* renumbered Route 18 (unsuffixed) to Route 23
* designated Route 24 from Mount Holly to Freehold
* renumbered the Route 20 &quot;from a point on Route No. 3, extending by way of West Berlin, Gibbsboro and Haddonfield, connecting with Haddon Avenue in the Borough of Haddonfield, and continuing to approach the Delaware River Bridge&quot; to Route 25, and extended it from West Berlin to Blue Anchor 
* designated Route 26 from Five Points to Hammonton
* designated Route 27 from Camden to Atlantic City
* designated Route 28 from South Amboy to Atlantic Highlands
* designated Route 29 from Morristown to Hackettstown
* designated Route 30 from Far Hills to Tri-State

It was eventually determined that an entire overhaul of the numbering system was necessary.

== Design ==
Chapter 319 of the 1927 public laws defined the new system of routes. Major roads received numbers from 1 to 12 and 21 to 50, as follows:

*1-12: northern New Jersey
*21-28: radiating from Newark
*29-37: radiating from Trenton
*38-47: radiating from Camden
*48-50: southern New Jersey

Spurs were also defined, being assigned a prefix of S. For example, Route S26 was a short spur of Route 26 connecting to Route 25 south of New Brunswick. A second spur of Route 4 was assigned Route S4A, but two separate spurs of Route 24 both received the Route S24 designation.

While the majority of already-acquired routes were included in the new system, four sections of pre-1927 routes were not. The law authorizing the renumbering indicated that these were to remain, and so the State Highway Commission added a suffix of N to distinguish them from the new routes of the same number:

*Route 4N from pre-1927 Route 4, Eatontown to Belmar
*Route 5N from pre-1927 Route 5, Morris Plains to Denville
*Route 8N from pre-1927 Route 8, Sussex to Unionville, New York
*Route 18N from pre-1927 Route 18N, Fort Lee to Alpine

==List of new routes==
== Additions ==

=== 1929 Amendment ===
Chapter 126 of the 1929 public law amended the 1927 act, removing redundant designations and creating entirely new roads in the New York Metropolitan Area. The amendments included

* Realigning Route 1 onto Route 18N, still left over from the first 1916 system
** Establishing Route S1A, today Route 67, from the remnants of Route 18N not taken over by Route 1 (Lemoine and Palisades Avenues)
* Truncating Route 3 to the Hawthorne-Paterson Line
** Establishing Route S3 (served by modern Route 3), running from Route 3 in East Rutherford to Route 6 in Clifton
* Declaring that Route S4A would be built, &quot;provided, however, the county of Atlantic shall first agree to construct a suitable continuation of said road from Little Beach to the city of Atlantic City&quot;. Atlantic County was unable to build most of this extension, hence Route S4A was never built; the portions that were built became designated as Route 87
** Establishing Route S4B, replacing the truncated sections of Route 3 (served today by Route 208)
* Truncating Route 5 to roughly its current length, with an extension to the centre of Ridgefield
** Realigning Route S5 onto the southern portion of Grand Avenue (modern Route 93)
* Realigning Route 6 to a new alignment east of Caldwell Township, bypassing Paterson
** Creating Route S6 (including modern Route 62) along the portions of Union Boulevard formerly used by Route 6
* Truncating Route 7 to Wallington
