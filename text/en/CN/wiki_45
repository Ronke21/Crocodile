<text>The Dornier 228 is a twin-turboprop STOL utility aircraft, designed and first manufactured by Dornier GmbH (later DASA Dornier, Fairchild-Dornier) from 1981 until 1998. 245 were built in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. In 1983, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) bought a production licence and manufactured another 125 aircraft in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. In July 2017, 63 aircraft were still in airline service.

In 2009, RUAG started building a Dornier 228 New Generation in Germany. The fuselage, wings and tail unit are manufactured by HAL in Kanpur, India, and transported to Oberpfaffenhofen, where RUAG Aviation carries out aircraft final assembly. The Dornier 228NG uses the same airframe with improved technologies and performances, such as a new five-blade propeller, glass cockpit and longer range. The first delivery was made in September 2010 to a Japanese operator.
In 2020, RUAG sold the Dornier 228 program to General Atomics.

==Development==
===Origins===
In the late 1970s, Dornier GmbH developed a new kind of wing, the TNT (&quot;Tragflügel neuer Technologie&quot; – Aerofoil new technology), subsidized by the German Government. Dornier tested it on a modified Do 28D-2 &quot;Skyservant&quot; and with Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-110 turboprop engines. Finally, Dornier changed the engine and tested the new aircraft, which was named Dornier 128 with two Garrett AiResearch TPE-331-5 engines. The company developed a new fuselage for the TNT and TPE 331–5 in two variants (15- and 19-passenger) and named both project-aircraft E-1 (later Dornier 228-100) and E-2 (later Dornier 228-200). At the ILA Berlin Air Show in 1980, Dornier presented the new aircraft to the public. Both of the prototypes were flown on 28 March 1981 and 9 May 1981 for the first time.
After German certification was granted on 18 December 1981, the first Dornier 228-100 entered service in the fleet of Norving in July 1982. The first operator of the larger Dornier 228-200 entered service with Jet Charters in late 1982. Certification from both British and American aviation authorities followed on 17 April and 11 May 1984 respectively. By 1983, the production rate of the Dornier 228 had risen to three aircraft per month; at this point, Dornier had targeted that 300 Dornier 228s would be produced by the end of the 1980s. In November 1983, a major license-production and phased technology-transfer agreement between Dornier and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was signed; a separate production line was established and produced its first aircraft in 1985. Pushpindar Singh Chopra had been put in charge of the Dornier 228&#x27;s manufacture in India. By 2014, a total of 125 Dornier 228s had been produced in India.

Over the years, Dornier offered the 228 in upgraded variants and fitted with optional equipment for performing various special missions. In 1996, it was announced that all manufacturing operations would be transferred to India. In 1998, activity on the German production line was halted, in part to concentrate on the production of the larger Fairchild-Dornier 328 and in response to Dornier&#x27;s wider financial difficulties.

===Dornier 228NG===
In 2002, RUAG took over the Services and Components divisions from Fairchild Dornier, including the Dornier 228 production rights. 
RUAG acquired the Dornier 228 type certificate in 2003. In December 2007, RUAG announced their intention to launch a modernized version of the aircraft, designated as the Dornier 228 Next Generation, or Dornier 228 NG.
At the 2008 Berlin Air Show, HAL agreed on supplying the first three components sets — fuselage, wings and tail — for €5 million, as a part of an €80 million ($123 million) ten-year contract.
In June 2010, the passenger aircraft was priced at €5.2 million ($7 million), €5.8–5.9 million with JAR-Ops equipment; restarting its production cost €20 million.

On 18 August 2010, the Dornier 228NG received its airworthiness certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The final assembly for the type is located in Germany; however, most airframe subassemblies, such as the wings, tail and fuselage, are produced by HAL in India. The main changes from the previous Dornier 228-212 model were a new five-blade propeller made of composite material, more powerful engines and an advanced glass cockpit featuring electronic instrument displays and other avionics improvements.

The first delivery, to the Japanese operator New Central Aviation, took place in September 2010. RUAG decided to suspend production of the Dornier 228 NG after the completion of an initial batch of eight aircraft in 2013. In 2014, RUAG and Tata Group signed an agreement for the latter to become a key supplier of the program. Production was restarted in 2015, with deliveries of four per year planned from 2016. In February 2016, RUAG announced that they were set to begin serial production of the Dornier 228 NG at its German production line in mid-2016; the assembly line is reportedly capable of producing a maximum of 12 aircraft per year.

On 30 September 2020, US firm General Atomics bought the Dornier 228 production line in Oberpfaffenhofen, including the transfer of all 450 employees, pending regulatory approval. The sale was announced on 15 October 2020, and was completed in February 2021.

===Hindustan 228===

In late 2017, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation issued a type certificate to the Hindustan 228. The aircraft was so far being manufactured under licence from RUAG for Indian defence forces and European markets would now be allowed to operate in India for commercial purposes. The 228 made its public debut in 2020 at the Dubai Airshow. Alliance Air signed an agreement with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to lease two 17-seater Dornier 228 aircraft in September 2021. The first aircraft was delivered to Alliance Air on 7 April 2022. The HAL Dornier 228 had previously only been used by the Indian Armed Forces but was modified by HAL for commercial operations. Alliance Air deployed the aircraft on a new route connecting Dibrugarh, Assam and Pasighat, Arunachal Pradesh on 12 April 2022, becoming the first airline to use an Indian-made aircraft in civil aviation operations and the first commercial airline in the country to operate the Dornier 228 aircraft.

=== Hybrid-electric demonstrators ===

Supported by Bavarian funding, the German DLR is modifying one of its two Dornier 228 into a demonstrator hybrid electric aircraft.
The first fully electric flight is planned for 2020 and the first hybrid-electric flight for 2021, apparently from Cochstedt Airport.
Partners include MTU Aero Engines and Siemens, of which Rolls-Royce plc is acquiring the electric propulsion unit.

On 19 January 2023, ZeroAvia flew its Dornier 228 testbed for 10 minutes with one TPE331 turboprop replaced by a prototype hydrogen-electric powertrain in the cabin: two fuel cells and a lithium-ion battery for peak power, towards a certifiable configuration by 2025.

==Design==


The Dornier 228 is a twin-engine general purpose aircraft, capable of transporting up to 19 passengers or various cargoes. It is powered by a pair of Garrett TPE331 turboprop engines. The Dornier 228 is commonly classified as a Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL)-capable aircraft, being capable of operating from rough runways and in hot climates. This capability has been largely attributed to the type&#x27;s supercritical wing which generates large amounts of lift at slow speeds. The Dornier 228 is typically promoted for its versatility, low operational costs, and a high level of reliability – possessing a dispatch reliability of 99%. RUAG Aviation have claimed that no other aircraft in the same class may carry as much cargo or as many passengers over a comparable distance as fast as the Dornier 228 NG.

The rectangular shape of the Dornier 228&#x27;s fuselage section and large side-loading doors make it particularly suitable for utility operators, which is a market that Dornier had targeted with the type from the onset. According to Flight International, one of the more distinguishing features of the Dornier 228 is the supercritical wing used. The structure of the wing is atypical, consisting of a box formed from four integrally-milled alloy panels. Kevlar is used for the ribs, stringers, trailing edge and fowler flaps, and the wing&#x27;s leading edge is conventional alloy sheet metal. Benefits of this wing over conventional methodology include a 15% reduction in weight, the elimination of 12,000 rivets, and lowering the per-aircraft manufacturing workload by roughly 340 man hours. Both the fuselage and tail are of a conventional design, but make use of chemical milling in order to save weight.

The Dornier 228 has been promoted in various capacities, including as a commuter aircraft, a military transporter, cargo hauler, or as a special missions aircraft. Special missions include maritime surveillance, border patrol, medevac, search and rescue, paradrop and environmental research missions, in which capacity the type has proven useful due to a ten-hour flight endurance, a wide operating range, low operational cost, and varied equipment range. Special equipment available to be installed include a 360-degree surveillance radar, side-looking airborne radar, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor, search light, operator station, real-time datalink, enlarged fuel tanks, satellite uplink, stretches, air-openable roller door, and infrared/ultraviolet sensors. In addition to a 19-seat commuter configuration for airlines, a VIP cabin configuration is also offered; the cabin can also be customized as per each client&#x27;s specifications. The Dornier 228 is the only aircraft of its class to be fitted with air conditioning as standard.

===Dornier 228NG===

More than 350 design changes are present between the Dornier 228 and the re-launched Dornier 228 NG. Amongst the principal changes is the adoption of Universal&#x27;s UNS-1 glass cockpit, which means that standard aircraft are equipped to be flown under single-pilot instrument flight rules (IFR) in addition to visual flight rules (VFR); according to RUAG Aviation, the Dornier 228 NG is the first aircraft in its class to be certified with equivalent electronics. A total of four large displays are used in the cockpit, two primary flight displays and two multifunction displays, to present all key flight data. The navigation system includes VHF omnidirectional range (VOR), distance measuring equipment (DME), automatic direction finder (ADF), radar altimeter, Global Positioning System (GPS), air data computer, and a flight management system. A three-axis autopilot can be optionally incorporated, as can a weather radar and high frequency (HF) radio. While designed for two-pilot operation, the Dornier 228 can be flown by only one crewmember.

Additional changes include the Garrett TPE331-10 engines, which have been optimized to work with the redesigned five-bladed fibre-composite propellers now used by the type, which are more efficient, quick to start, and produces substantially less vibration and noise than the original metal four-bladed predecessor. Through its engines, the Dornier 228 NG has the longest time between overhaul (TBO) of any 19-seat aircraft, reportedly up to 7,000 hours. An engine-indicating and crew-alerting system (EICAS) is also present for safety purposes; additional optional safety equipment akin to much larger passenger aircraft, including airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS) and terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), can be incorporated as well.
At in clean config, the 228NG burns of fuel per hour at a cruise.

==Operators==
In July 2018, 57 aircraft were in airline service. Other operators include police, law enforcement, paramilitary operators and military operators.

By July 2018, the fleet accumulated over four million flight hours.

==Accidents and incidents==
The Dornier 228 has been involved in 54 aviation accidents and incidents including 41 hull losses.
Those resulted in 205 fatalities

<text>QCAD is a computer-aided design (CAD) software application for 2D design and drafting. It is available for Linux, Apple macOS, Unix and Microsoft Windows. The QCAD GUI is based on the Qt framework.

==Description==
QCAD is partly released under the GNU General Public License. Precompiled packages are available for 32-bit and 64-bit Linux platforms, Microsoft Windows OS and macOS.

QCAD is developed by RibbonSoft. Development on QCAD began in October 1999, starting with code from CAM Expert. QCAD 2, designed to &quot;make QCAD more productive, more user friendly, more flexible and increase its compatibility with other products&quot; began development in May 2002. QCAD 3 was first released in August 2011 with an ECMAScript (JavaScript) interface as major addition.

Some of the interface and concepts behind QCAD are similar to those of AutoCAD.

QCAD uses the DXF file format internally and to save and import files. Support for the popular DWG file format is available as a commercial plugin based on the Open Design Alliance DWG libraries.

Starting from version 3.7 QCAD is distributed as Professional Trial that works for a limited time, or as Community Edition as source code only, so users need to self compile or remove the QCAD Professional add-on running in trial mode.

Although much of the software source is under the GPL-3.0-or-later license there is also significant functionality not available under a free software license.

QCAD has a large library of different templates.

==Multiplatform support==
QCAD operates on Linux, macOS [10.7 (Lion) or later], UNIX (FreeBSD, NetBSD), Solaris for x86 and SPARC, and Windows [8, 7, Vista, XP, 2000]. This is of importance for collaboration across a diverse computing environment.

<text>Dromichaetes () was king of the Getae on both sides of the lower Danube (present day Romania and Bulgaria) around 300 BC.

== Background ==

The Getae had been federated in the Odrysian kingdom in the 5th century BC. It is not known how the relations between Getae and Odrysians developed. The Balkan campaigns of Philip II of Macedon between 352 and 340 BC shattered Odrysian authority and the Getae profited from the situation. By the second half of the 4th century, the Getae occupied sites on both banks of the lower Danube and this region flourished as never before. The new Macedonian conquests, secured with considerable military power, caused consternation in the adjoining territories and thus stimulated the political fusion of the Getic tribes.

== Name ==
There is no consensus on the etymology of the name Δρομιχαίτης (&quot;Dromichaites&quot;). It can be a Greek name (δρόμος &quot;run&quot; + χαιτήεις &quot;long-haired&quot;), a Thracian name, or a Thracian name formed with Greek elements (Δρομο- and Χαιτο-, -χαιτης).

Other people with this name include:

* a Thracian mercenary soldier in Attica around 300 BC;
* a Thracian chief helping Antiochus II Theos (261 – 246 BC) at the siege of Kypsela;
* a general of Mithridates VI Eupator sent with reinforcements in 87 BC to support Archelaus in Athens.

== Reign ==
Not much is known about the reign of Dromichaetes, his court and his kingdom. The most detailed account is provided by two fragments from the history of Diodorus Siculus. But this source must be treated with caution, as the interference of literary motifs lessens its value as historical evidence.

=== Helis ===
According to Diodorus, the main residence of Dromichaetes was named Helis. Traditionally, Helis and the kingdom of Dromichaetes have been placed beyond the Danube, in the Romanian Plain. Thus Helis was variously located at Piscul Crăsani on Ialomița River, at Popeşti on Argeş River, at Zimnicea on the left bank of Danube, or identified with one of the several earth-walled fortifications from the Alexandria-Roşiorii de Vede complex. It was also suggested Helis was located in the Moldavian Plateau in a cluster of fortified settlements dated to between the 6th and the 3rd century BC, where two royal treasures were also found at Cucuteni Băiceni and Stânceşti.

The Getic tomb at Sveshtari (discovered in 1982) in the western Ludogorie in Bulgaria is also supposed to have been near the location of Helis. In the vicinity of the mausoleum, the remains of a large ancient city were found along with dozens of Getic mound tombs. The settlement is situated in a natural stronghold, a plateau surrounded like a peninsula by the ravines of Krapinets River. The outer stone wall, up to 4m thick, follows the edges of the peninsula and defends a territory of about 10 hectares. The inner wall, of similar construction, encloses a roughly quadrilateral area of about 5 hectares. The fortified territory was relatively densely occupied by dwellings connected by a network of thoroughfares. Dating finds such as amphorae stamps and coins indicate that this settlement existed between 335 and 250 BC.

The settlement enjoyed economic prosperity and sustained active trade relations with the Greek colonies in the Aegean and the Black Sea region. Imported goods were found in abundance: Attic black-glazed ceramics, amphorae from Thassos, Sinope and Heraclea Pontica and pottery of probably West-Pontic colonial origin. It was also an important production centre with metalworking, bone and pottery workshops.

== The war with Lysimachus ==


In 313 BC, during the Third War of the Diadochi, the Greek colonies of the western Black Sea shores revolted against Lysimachus, a former general of Alexander the Great, and expelled the military garrisons imposed by him. Lysimachus besieged successively Odessus and Histria and forced them to capitulate. A peace treaty was drawn up in 311, but the siege of Callatis continued until 310 or 309 BC. No other action of Lysimachus is known north of Haemus until the clash with Dromichaetes in the 290s BC.

The evidence for the conflict is incomplete and contradictory, although attested by a number of ancient authors. It was probably provoked by the territorial expansion of Lysimachus and the control of the Greek colonies was perhaps the issue at stake.

The two fragments of Diodorus&#x27; history suggest two separate campaigns. During the first the Getae captured Agathocles, the son of Lysimachus, but later set him free hoping to recover the territories lost to Lysimachus. During the second Lysimachus himself was taken prisoner and then released under similar conditions. However Pausanias, mentioning the same two episodes, implies they are parallel versions of one and the same event.

The campaign in which Lysimachus fell captive to the Getae is dated by scholars variously between 294 and 291 BC. Lysimachus invaded with significant forces and his offensive enjoyed some early success before ending in disaster. According to Polyaenus, Seuthes, a general of Dromichaetes, presented himself as a deserter, deceived Lysimachus and led him into difficult terrain. Attacked by Dromichaetes, the army of Lysimachus was defeated and the king had to surrender.

Diodorus gives our only account of the captivity and subsequent release of Lysimachus. Dromichaetes succeeded in persuading the assembly of his compatriots that the release of the enemy king would bring them greater political advantage than his punishment. Dromichaetes also set out a feast to demonstrate the barbarian ways and the poverty of his people, using different furniture, tableware and food. He then asked Lysimachus:

Dromichaetes crowned Lysimachus with a wreath and then set him free, after receiving promises of loyalty and friendship and the return of the Getic territories occupied by Lysimachus. As precaution, the Getae held some high-born hostages like Clearchus, the son of the tyrant Dionysius of Heraclea. Lysimachus also had to give his daughter in marriage to Dromichaetes.

=== Death and burial ===

The great tomb in Ginina mound near Sveshtari is among the most prominent Thracian tombs with its unique architecture and luxurious decoration. It is dated approximately to the early 3rd century BC. A painted scene, interpreted as either one of heroization or investiture, points to its probable royal character. The man and the woman buried here were tentatively identified with Dromichaetes and his consort. The unfinished details of its sculptured and painted decoration indicate a hasty and premature burial. The woman was probably murdered to accompany her royal husband in the grave.

The Roman historian Justin mentions a large army of Celts defeating both Triballi and Getae before attacking Antigonus Gonatas in 279 BC. Based on this account, Peter Delev argued that Dromichaetes could have fallen in battle against these Celts.

== Legacy ==

=== Classical world ===
The captivity of Lysimachus was echoed in the Classical Greek literature as a moralizing story about the punishment of pride and the virtues of barbarians. Diodorus&#x27; story of Dromichaetes&#x27; banquet for his royal prisoner is probably a literary device, contrasting Macedonian opulence with Thracian frugality.

=== Modern world ===
Dromichaetes is the king of Dacians and the main character in &quot;Muntele&quot; (&quot;The Mountain&quot;), a play written in 1977 by Dumitru Radu Popescu and a political fable. The identity between the ruler and its people alludes to Ceauşescu&#x27;s cult of personality.

Helis Nunatak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after the Getic Helis.

<doc id="1244926" wikidata="Q1457566" url="?curid=1244926" title="Graveyard orbit">
<text>A graveyard orbit, also called a junk orbit or disposal orbit, is an orbit that lies away from common operational orbits. One significant graveyard orbit is a supersynchronous orbit well beyond geosynchronous orbit. Some satellites are moved into such orbits at the end of their operational life to reduce the probability of colliding with operational spacecraft and generating space debris.

==Overview==
A graveyard orbit is used when the change in velocity required to perform a de-orbit maneuver is too large. De-orbiting a geostationary satellite requires a delta-v of about , whereas re-orbiting it to a graveyard orbit only requires about .

For satellites in geostationary orbit and geosynchronous orbits, the graveyard orbit is a few hundred kilometers beyond the operational orbit. The transfer to a graveyard orbit beyond geostationary orbit requires the same amount of fuel as a satellite needs for about three months of stationkeeping. It also requires a reliable attitude control during the transfer maneuver. While most satellite operators plan to perform such a maneuver at the end of their satellites&#x27; operational lives, through 2005 only about one-third succeeded. Given the economic value of the positions at geosynchronous altitude, unless premature spacecraft failure precludes it, satellites are moved to a graveyard orbit prior to decommissioning.

According to the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) the minimum perigee altitude formula_1 beyond the geostationary orbit is:
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the solar radiation pressure coefficient and formula_4 is the aspect area [m2] to mass [kg] ratio of the satellite. This formula includes about 200 km for the GEO-protected zone to also permit orbit maneuvers in GEO without interference with the graveyard orbit. Another of tolerance must be allowed for the effects of gravitational perturbations (primarily solar and lunar). The remaining part of the equation considers the effects of the solar radiation pressure, which depends on the physical parameters of the satellite.

In order to obtain a license to provide telecommunications services in the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires all geostationary satellites launched after March 18, 2002, to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational lives. U.S. government regulations require a boost, formula_5, of about . In 2023 DISH received the first-ever fine by the FCC for failing to de-orbit its EchoStar VII satellite according to the terms of its license.

A spacecraft moved to a graveyard orbit will typically be passivated.

Uncontrolled objects in a near geostationary [Earth] orbit (GEO) exhibit a 53-year cycle of orbital inclination due to the interaction of the Earth&#x27;s tilt with the lunar orbit. The orbital inclination varies ± 7.4°, at up to 0.8°pa.

== Disposal orbit ==

While the standard geosynchronous satellite graveyard orbit results in an expected orbital lifetime of millions of years, the increasing number of satellites, the launch of microsatellites, and the FCC approval of large megaconstellations of thousands of satellites for launch by 2022 necessitates new approaches for deorbiting to assure earlier removal of the objects once they have reached end-of-life. Contrary to GEO graveyard orbits requiring three months&#x27; worth of fuel (delta-V of 11 m/s) to reach, large satellite networks in LEO require orbits that passively decay into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. For example, both OneWeb and SpaceX have committed to the FCC regulatory authorities that decommissioned satellites will decay to a lower orbita disposal orbitwhere the satellite orbital altitude would decay due to atmospheric drag and then naturally reenter the atmosphere and burn up within one year of end-of-life.

<text>Peter Thompson (September 1, 1853 – December 3, 1928) was a Scots-American soldier who was awarded a Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.

==Biography==
Thompson was born in Markinch in Fife, Scotland. After emigrating with his family to the United States in 1865, Thompson lived near Pittsburgh, and later in Indiana County, PA, where he worked as a miner. He enlisted in the United States Army in September 1875, serving in the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment&#x27;s C company from 1875 until 1880. His commanding officer was Capt. Thomas Custer. After an honorable discharge, he resided first in Lead, SD, where he worked at the Homestead Mine. Later he moved to Alzada, MT, where he became a rancher. He married Ruth Boicourt in 1904. They had two children, Susan and Peter Jr., born in 1906 and 1909. Thompson died on December 3, 1928, at Hot Springs, SD, of heart failure.

==Little Big Horn==
In 1876, while serving under George Armstrong Custer in the eastern Montana Territory, he took part in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Had his horse not given out on the bluffs above the river as the regiment reached the battlefield, Thompson would have died with Custer. As it was, Thompson and a companion named James Watson fell behind, but continued on toward the river. Unable to rejoin their own company, the two later climbed back up the bluffs and joined surviving elements of the regiment, under Major Marcus Reno. Thompson took part in other parts of the battle and was wounded in the hand and arm. In spite of his wounds, he made trips outside the lines to obtain water for the wounded, an act that gained him one of 24 Medals of Honor awarded for the battle.

After the fight, he was evacuated to Fort Abraham Lincoln by steamboat. When his hand had recovered sufficiently, he wrote a lengthy account of the fighting. Notably, he said he had been in a hiding place from which he had seen Custer near the river, and had also witnessed the beginning of the fight in which Custer was killed. By implication, he may have been the last white man to have seen Custer alive.

==Controversy over Thompson&#x27;s story==
Thompson was interviewed by the respected Indian Wars researcher Walter Mason Camp at the Little Bighorn Battlefield in 1909. Camp, who met with Thompson on other occasions and corresponded him for many years, was unable to reconcile Thompson&#x27;s account with what he had learned from other participants and records. Thompson published his controversial 26,000 word account in his regional newspaper, the Belle Fourche, South Dakota &quot;Bee&quot; in the spring of 1914. This was an era when a number of old men (or deceased men, through their obituaries) claimed to have been &quot;the last survivor&quot; of Custer&#x27;s Last Stand. Thompson would later have confrontations with other battle participants, and be accused of being a liar. He was so labeled by one veteran named William Slaper in a 1925 book, &quot;A Trooper with Custer,&quot; edited by Earl A. Brininstool. Thompson&#x27;s attempts to prove his claims were frustrated by the unknown whereabouts of James Watson.

Peter Thompson died in Hot Springs, South Dakota, and was interred in the West Lead Cemetery in Lead, South Dakota.

Thompson&#x27;s story has received significant attention in recent years. Daniel O. Magnussen wrote in 1974 that, while Thompson seemed to have been an honest man, his account was riddled with errors. He speculated that Thompson&#x27;s memory may have been clouded by hallucinations brought on by stress and his wound. More recently, the publication of Camp&#x27;s notes has again stimulated interest in Thompson&#x27;s story, and provided corroboration for many controversial parts of the account. Like Curley&#x27;s stories of the Little Bighorn, Thompson&#x27;s account remains a fascinating enigma.

==Medal of Honor citation==
Rank and organization: Private, Company C, 7th U.S. Cavalry. Place and date: At Little Big Horn, Mont., June 25, 1876. Entered service at: Pittsburgh, Pa. Birth: Scotland. Date of issue: October 5, 1878.

<doc id="1244933" wikidata="Q418082" url="?curid=1244933" title="Hydantoin">
<text>Hydantoin, or glycolylurea, is a heterocyclic organic compound with the formula CH2C(O)NHC(O)NH. It is a colorless solid that arises from the reaction of glycolic acid and urea. It is an oxidized derivative of imidazolidine. In a more general sense, hydantoins can refer to groups or a class of compounds with the same ring structure as the parent compound. For example, phenytoin (mentioned below) has two phenyl groups substituted onto the number 5 carbon in a hydantoin molecule.

==Synthesis==
Hydantoin was first isolated in 1861 by Adolf von Baeyer in the course of his study of uric acid. He obtained it by hydrogenation of allantoin, hence the name.


Friedrich Urech synthesized 5-methylhydantoin in 1873 from alanine sulfate and potassium cyanate in what is now known as the Urech hydantoin synthesis. The method is very similar to the modern route using alkyl and arylcyanates. The 5,5-dimethyl compound can also be obtained from acetone cyanohydrin (also discovered by Urech: see cyanohydrin reaction) and ammonium carbonate. This reaction type is called the Bucherer–Bergs reaction.

Hydantoin can also be synthesized either by heating allantoin with hydroiodic acid or by &quot;heating bromacetyl urea with alcoholic ammonia&quot;. The cyclic structure of hydantoins was confirmed by Dorothy Hahn 1913.

Of practical importance, hydantoins are obtained by condensation of a cyanohydrin with ammonium carbonate. Another useful route, which follows the work of Urech, involves the condensation of amino acids with cyanates and isocyanates:

==Uses and occurrence==
===Pharmaceuticals===
The hydantoin group can be found in several medicinally important compounds. In pharmaceuticals, hydantoin derivatives form a class of anticonvulsants; phenytoin and fosphenytoin both contain hydantoin moieties and are both used as anticonvulsants in the treatment of seizure disorders. The hydantoin derivative dantrolene is used as a muscle relaxant to treat malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, spasticity, and ecstasy intoxication. Ropitoin is an example of an antiarrhythmic hydantoin.

===Pesticides===
The hydantoin derivative Imiprothrin is a pyrethroid insecticide. Iprodione is a popular fungicide containing the hydantoin group.

===Synthesis of amino acids===
Hydrolysis of hydantoins affords amino acids:
Hydantoin itself reacts with hot, dilute hydrochloric acid to give glycine. Methionine is produced industrially via the hydantoin obtained from methional.

===Methylation===
Methylation of hydantoin yields a variety of derivatives. Dimethylhydantoin (DMH) may refer to any dimethyl derivative of hydantoin, but especially 5,5-dimethylhydantoin.

===Halogenation===
Some &quot;N&quot;-halogenated derivatives of hydantoin are used as chlorinating or brominating agents in disinfectant/sanitizer or biocide products. The three major &quot;N&quot;-halogenated derivatives are dichlorodimethylhydantoin (DCDMH), bromochlorodimethylhydantoin (BCDMH), and dibromodimethylhydantoin (DBDMH). A mixed ethyl-methyl analogue, 1,3-dichloro-5-ethyl-5-methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (bromochloroethylmethylhydantoin), is also used in mixtures with the above.

===DNA oxidation to hydantoins after cell death===
A high proportion of cytosine and thymine bases in DNA are oxidized to hydantoins over time after the death of an organism. Such modifications block DNA polymerases and thus prevents PCR from working. Such damage is a problem when dealing with ancient DNA samples.

<doc id="1244935" wikidata="Q6754148" url="?curid=1244935" title="Mapp and Lucia (novel series)">
<text>Mapp and Lucia is a series of novels by E. F. Benson.

The first novel, &quot;Queen Lucia&quot;, was published in 1920, and introduced Mrs. Emmeline &quot;Lucia&quot; Lucas, the social leader in the fictional town of Riseholme, her husband Philip &quot;Pepino&quot; Lucas, best friend Georgie Pillson, and rival Daisy Quantock. The second novel, &quot;Miss Mapp&quot;, was published in 1922, and introduced Miss Elizabeth Mapp, the ferocious queen of another fictional seaside town, Tilling. The third, &quot;Lucia in London&quot; (1927), brought Lucia and Pepino from Riseholme to London, while her Riseholme neighbours seethed.

With the fourth novel, &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot; (1931), Benson brought the characters from the previous three books together, with a freshly-widowed Lucia moving to Tilling with Georgie, and battling Mapp for control of the town&#x27;s social life. This storyline continued in &quot;Lucia&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1935) and &quot;Trouble for Lucia&quot; (1939), making six books in all. 

The 1985 television adaptation, originally broadcast on Channel 4, starred Geraldine McEwan as Lucia, Prunella Scales as Mapp and Nigel Hawthorne as Georgie, in ten episodes adapting the fourth, fifth and sixth novels.

The 2014 television series originally broadcast on BBC One, starred Anna Chancellor as Lucia, Miranda Richardson as Mapp, and Steve Pemberton as Georgie, in three episodes adapting &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot;, and incorporating a storyline from &quot;Queen Lucia&quot;.

==The novels==
The novels feature humorous incidents in the lives of (mainly) upper-middle-class British characters in the 1920s and 1930s, who vie for social prestige and one-upmanship in an atmosphere of extreme cultural snobbery. Several of them are set in the small seaside town of Tilling, closely based on Rye, East Sussex, where Benson lived for a number of years and (like Lucia) served as mayor. Lucia previously lived at Riseholme, based on Broadway, Worcestershire, whence she brought to Tilling her celebrated recipe for Lobster &quot;à la Riseholme&quot;.

&quot;Mallards&quot;, the home of Miss Mapp—and subsequently Lucia—was based on Lamb House in Rye. The house had previously been the residence of Henry James and had a garden room overlooking the street.

The novels, in chronological order, are:
*&quot;Queen Lucia&quot; (1920)
*&quot;Miss Mapp&quot; (1922) 
*&quot;Lucia in London&quot; (1927)
*&quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot; (1931)
*&quot;Lucia&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1935) (published in the U.S. as &quot;The Worshipful Lucia&quot;)
*&quot;Trouble for Lucia&quot; (1939)

The first three books concern only the protagonist named in the title; the last three feature both Mapp and Lucia.

In 1977 Thomas Y. Crowell Company reprinted all six novels in a compendium called &quot;Make Way for Lucia&quot;. The order of &quot;Miss Mapp&quot; and &quot;Lucia in London&quot; was switched in the compendium, and a Miss Mapp short story called &quot;The Male Impersonator&quot; was included between &quot;Miss Mapp&quot; and &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot;.

&quot;Desirable Residences&quot;, one further short story featuring Miss Mapp which had previously seen only one magazine printing in Benson&#x27;s own time, was discovered by Jack Adrian in the 1990s and included in his collection of Benson stories, &quot;Desirable Residences&quot;. A slight oddity about this very short piece is that the town of Tilling was called Tillingham in the original printing, according to Adrian&#x27;s introduction to his collection. The characters of Miss Mapp and Diva Plaistow are clearly recognizable, however, as are their desirable residences. Miss Mapp, for example, here lives in Mallards.

The character Susan Leg, appearing briefly in &quot;Trouble for Lucia&quot;, first appeared as a major character in Benson&#x27;s novel &quot;Secret Lives&quot; (1932), which is similar in style to the Mapp and Lucia books.

== Lobster &quot;à la Riseholme&quot; ==
Lobster &quot;à la Riseholme&quot; was a famed (ultimately infamous) gastronomic dish served by Lucia (Mrs Emmeline Lucas) in two of the &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot; novels.

The recipe was never revealed, but, in the manner of Mrs Beeton, began with the words &quot;Take two hen lobsters ...&quot; It took its name from the village of Riseholme, where Lucia lived before moving to Tilling, although the dish did not appear in either of the two novels set while Lucia was at Riseholme. Lucia first serves Lobster &quot;à la Riseholme&quot; in Tilling to her friend George (&quot;Georgie&quot;) Pillson in &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot; (1931) to cheer him up after he discovers that his housemaid Foljambe intends to marry. It then appears at a luncheon party a few weeks later. Lucia resists attempts to reveal the recipe, despite the custom in Tilling of sharing favourite recipes. Lucia&#x27;s cook refuses Elizabeth Mapp&#x27;s bribe of half a crown (two shillings and sixpence) to provide a copy. Elizabeth attempts to create the recipe—&quot;Lobster &quot;à la Riseholme à la Mapp&quot;&quot;, as Benson called it—at a party of her own, but it is not a success. In Gerald Savory&#x27;s adaptation for television (London Weekend Television 1984) Lucia&#x27;s guests vie with each other to guess the additional ingredients—shrimps, cream, tomato, cheese, and Marsala are all suggested—but this does not happen in the book. On Boxing Day 1930, Elizabeth enters Lucia&#x27;s kitchen at Grebe, on the outskirts of Tilling, and is able, in Lucia&#x27;s absence, to transcribe the recipe. Lucia discovers her in the act, but before excuses can be given, the sea wall breaks and Lucia and Elizabeth are swept away on the flood, clinging to the kitchen table. They languish for some weeks on an Italian fishing vessel on the Gallagher Bank, eventually returning to Tilling, where Elizabeth discovers that the recipe has survived the ordeal. Elizabeth subsequently serves a correct Lobster &quot;à la Riseholme&quot; at her wedding breakfast, at which point the reason for her being in Lucia&#x27;s kitchen becomes clear. The dish is served again in &quot;Lucia&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1935) at Lucia&#x27;s housewarming party following her move to Elizabeth&#x27;s former residence, Mallards.

Lobster &quot;à la Riseholme&quot; reappears in Tom Holt&#x27;s pastiche, &quot;Lucia in Wartime&quot; (1985), set early in the Second World War. Having mastered &quot;Woolton pie&quot; (an officially sanctioned vegetable dish named after the wartime Food Minister, Lord Woolton), Georgie&#x27;s triumphant preparation of Lobster &quot;à la Riseholme&quot;, using a number of substitute ingredients, leads to his expertise being commended to the Ministry of Food. As a result, he is conscripted for a BBC radio broadcast during which, among other things, he provides a recipe for corned beef &quot;à la Riseholme&quot;. This follows speculation in Tilling as to whether he would reveal the secret of the celebrated lobster dish. Later in the novel, Holt uses the term &quot;humble pie &quot;à la Riseholme&quot;&quot; with reference to a likely need for humility. Various attempts have been made to create a Lobster &quot;à la Riseholme&quot; recipe, including one by a contributor to the website of TV&#x27;s &quot;domestic goddess&quot; Nigella Lawson.

<text>Daisy Ocasio (born November 3, 1964) is a well known Puerto Rican athlete. A participant of Marathon and Track and Field races, she is also a former female boxer.

Ocasio was born Brooklyn, New York. Although she and Ossie Ocasio shared one sport, boxing, and the same last name, Ocasio, it is not known whether the two have a family connection.

Daisy Ocasio had an accomplished career in the running fields, holding various records at different international races. In 1991, she participated as a Track and Field runner at the Havana, Cuba Pan American Games. She also participated at various international championships such as the Central American and Caribbean Games, Ibero-American Championships in Athletics, and Central American and Caribbean Championships in Athletics.

Ocasio&#x27;s photos were commonly seen on Puerto Rican newspapers during the early 1990s, when she was at the top of her career as a runner. She continued on running, and winning races, until the late 1990s. Many Puerto Ricans came to identify her, just as they did with Angelita Lind during the 1980s, as one of the most important runners of Puerto Rico. That&#x27;s why, when she announced she would become a female boxer, she caused some shock among many of her fans.

On July 23, 1998, she debuted as a boxer, defeating Andrea Figueroa by a knockout in round two at Vega Baja. Only nineteen days later, she beat Lizette Pizarro by a knockout in the first round, also in her hometown.

On November 7 of that year, she beat Marischa Sjau, in Lake Worth, Florida, to mark her United States debut. By then, she had moved to Florida to train.

On March 3, 1999, she beat Pamela Clarke, by then considered a top fighter, by a knockout in three rounds at Miami. Then, on December 8 came what could be considered as her best victory: facing future world champion Patricia Demick of Chile, Ocasio won by a six-round unanimous decision.

On April 15, 2000, in what would turn out to be her last fight, she was knocked out by future world champion Britt Van Buskirk, in Temecula, California.

She retired from women&#x27;s boxing with a record of five wins and one loss, with three knockout wins.

Currently in her 50s, Ocasio now leads a relatively quiet life, and has returned to live full-time in Puerto Rico.

<doc id="1244944" wikidata="Q1011138" url="?curid=1244944" title="Yiwu">
<text>Yiwu () is a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Jinhua in Central Zhejiang Province, East China. As of the 2020 census, the city had 1,859,390 inhabitants and its built-up (or metro) area, joined with that of the neighboring Dongyang, was home to 2,947,340 inhabitants. The city is famous for its light industry commodity trade and vibrant market and as a regional tourist destination.

==History==
Yiwu was founded as Wushang City (乌商) in 222 BCE, right before the Qin dynasty. It was renamed Yiwu County in 624 CE. Trade has been historically important in Yiwu since the surrounding area has little arable soil. Even before 1600s, Yiwu men would carry sewing needles, threads, sugar chunks and other small commodities in their bamboo baskets, using a shoulder-pole and travel to surrounding rural villages in exchange for chicken feathers. Chicken feathers could be either used as a fertilizer for their own lands or made into feather dusters for exporting. This &quot;Sugar-For-Chicken Feathers&quot; tradition had become part of Yiwu culture. As the trading population grew larger, the earliest wholesale markets emerged in Yiwu around 1700s. After the founding of People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the free market was once considered capitalistic and hence officially suppressed, forcing Yiwu people to continue their trade secretly. It was only after Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s economic reform in 1978 did the Yiwu market thrive again, becoming one of the first free marketplaces in PRC&#x27;s history. The cement boards over a stinky ditch nearby Huqingmen street, set up by the local government as the first marketplace in 1982, later became the present day Yiwu International Trade Mart after 27 years of development.

In May 1988 the former Yiwu County was upgraded to a county-level city. In 1995 Yiwu ranked the 47th among China&#x27;s 100 most powerful counties/cities regarding comprehensive economic strength and in the same year listed as Zhejiang&#x27;s sole city among the nation&#x27;s experimental counties/cities of comprehensive reform. In 2001 Yiwu&#x27;s overall economy ranked 19th of all counties (cities) of China.

Yiwu&#x27;s early culture has given birth to a number of notable figures in literature, art, military, education and engineering. Among these were Chen Wangdao, China&#x27;s first translator of the Communist Manifesto; Wu Han, historian and former deputy mayor of Beijing; Zhu Zhixi, the engineer who harnessed the Yellow River; Zhu Danxi, one of the four distinguished doctors of the Jin and Yuan Dynasties; Zong Ze, a well-known general from the Song dynasty who resisted aggression by the State of Jin; and the ancestors of Wang Leehom, a famous singer.
==Geography==
Yiwu is located south of the city of Hangzhou, the provincial capital. The nearest city to Yiwu is Dongyang. The area, as in most of the province of Zhejiang, is in a mountainous region.

==Climate==

==Administration==
Yiwu is part of the greater Municipal region of Jinhua, although it has a distinct urban core. On China&#x27;s administrative strata it is a sub-prefecture level city. It has under its jurisdiction 15 towns and eight villages, which covers 1,102.8 square kilometres, 100 square kilometres of which are urban area of 700,000 people (2010 estimate). There has been talk of merging the Yiwu and Jinhua areas into a single municipal zone or economic entity, but this plan has yet to make its way into any formal discussion.

The city, in 2020 opened a database for post-2017 domestic violence incidents. According to the All-China Women&#x27;s Federation, it was the first time a Chinese municipality has enacted such a database. The system was to be launched July 1 that year. The vice president of the Yiwu chapter of the federation, Zhou Danying, stated that in many cases an abusive partner reveals this trait post-marriage. The impetus was an increase in such incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In July 2020, Yiwu became the first city in China to allow residents check their partners&#x27; domestic violence records, aimed at reducing incidents of domestic violence.

Yiwu has the world&#x27;s largest small commodities market. The Yiwu market developed and managed by Zhejiang China Commodities City Group Co., Ltd. (Public, SHA:600415). Yiwu&#x27;s China Small-Commodity Market has for six consecutive years topped China&#x27;s 100 top open markets and was for successive years listed as &quot;China&#x27;s civilized open market&quot;. It has been named as the banner of China&#x27;s market economy and with a large variety of quality but cheaper commodities. There have been a significant increase in Arab traders since the September 11 attacks, as Middle Eastern businessmen found it difficult to travel to the United States due to visa restrictions. The Arab presence has fostered the rise of many mosques and Middle Eastern restaurants.

In conjunction with Zhejiang China Commodities City Group Co Ltd., the Yiwu city government developed a successful business-to-business e-commerce platform (Yiwugo.com) to facilitate sales of local products.

The GDP reached 52 billion yuan (US$7.6 billion) in 2009, an increase of 9% from 2008, and the per capita GDP reached 71,457 yuan (US$10,461). The per capita urban disposable income reached 30,841 yuan and rural pure income 12,899 yuan, increasing 7.4% and 8.5% respectively.

Its 4C-grade airport has over a dozen air routes to cities including Beijing, Guangzhou, Shantou, Weifang and Shenzhen. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and Hangzhou-Jinhua Expressway passes through the city, making Yiwu an important local transportation hub. By train it is less than three hours from Shanghai.

&quot;Yiwu, 300 kilometres away from Shanghai, is the largest market of commodity wholesales in the world where various foreign buyers go to place orders&quot;, according to &#x27;Chinese Figures Astonishing the World&#x27;, joint report from the United Nations, the World Bank and Morgan Stanley. The city was ranked first among county-level cities in &quot;the 2004 Most Favourite Chinese Cities of Domestic and Foreign Public in 2004&quot;.

China Commodity City (CCC), the large wholesale market of Yiwu, was honored by the UN, the World Bank and Morgan Stanley amongst other world authorities in 2005 as the &quot;largest small commodity wholesale market in the world&quot;.

The counterfeiting industry has been a problem in Yiwu due to the thriving market. In 2005, author Tim Phillips wrote that Yiwu functions as a sort of &#x27;Wall Street&#x27; for the counterfeiting industry, providing a vast marketplace where 100,000 counterfeit products are openly traded and 2,000 metric tons of fakes change hands daily.&#x27;

According to Xinhua, more than 60% of Christmas trinkets worldwide in 2013 came from Yiwu.
==Culture==

Yiwu contains an Olympic quality stadium. Many events associated with trade take place in Yiwu City. Yiwu also has a sizable Chinese Muslim and Korean population, mostly working in the import and export businesses, as well as a very small Jewish population also in those businesses. It also has a large Christian church and a thousand years old Buddhist temple, Jingju Temple. Yiwu is also known as the &quot;sock town&quot; as annually it produces over three billion pairs of socks for Wal-Mart, Pringle and Disney. Yiwu is also known as China&#x27;s number one producer of fashion jewellery as firms are based in Yiwu as there are many factories making unbranded jewellery and the amount of warehouses that are available to store the goods in.

The Guyue Bridge, a stone arch bridge built in 1213, is one of the few existing bridges of that era.

This town is the ancestral home of singer Wang Leehom, current Kuomintang leader Eric Chu and the current Chief Executive of Macau Ho Iat Seng.

<text>The Asiatic glassfishes are a family, the Ambassidae, of freshwater and marine ray-finned fishes that were formerly classified in the order Perciformes, but most authorities consider this order to be paraphyletic and that the Ambassidae are of uncertain affinities, &quot;incertae sedis&quot;, but within the subseries Ovalentaria. The species in the family are native to Asia, Oceania, the Indian Ocean, and the western Pacific Ocean. The family includes eight genera and about 51 species. Some species are known as perchlets.

The largest species reaches a maximum size around 26 cm (10 in). Many of the species are noted for their transparent or semitransparent bodies.

Several species are used as aquarium fish, noted for their transparent bodies. The Indian glassy fish (&quot;Parambassis ranga&quot;) is transparent, but showier specimens that had been injected with artificial coloring were sold as novelty pets in the 1990s. Since then, these &quot;painted fish&quot; have become much less popular, with more fishkeepers seeking naturally pigmented specimens.

The earliest fossil remains of this family are from the Early Eocene, with the fossil genus &quot;Kapurdia&quot; from the early Eocene of Rajasthan, India and otoliths of &quot;Ambassis antipodus&quot; from the Early Eocene of New Zealand. One of the most notable fossil members of the family is &quot;Dapalis&quot;, which appears to be a stem group-glassfish that was dominant in freshwater and estuarine ecosystems throughout Europe from the Middle Eocene to Middle Miocene, with 21 species known from both fossil skeletons and otoliths.

==Naming history==
The family has also been called Chandidae, and some sources continue to use the name. Because Ambassidae was used first, in 1870, it has precedence over Chandidae, which was first used in 1905.

<doc id="1244950" wikidata="Q6723656" url="?curid=1244950" title="Machine Gun Corps">
<text>The Machine Gun Corps (MGC) was a corps of the British Army, formed in October 1915 in response to the need for more effective use of machine guns on the Western Front in the First World War. The Heavy Branch of the MGC was the first to use tanks in combat and was subsequently turned into the Tank Corps, later called the Royal Tank Regiment. The MGC remained in existence after the war until it was disbanded in 1922.

==Formation==
At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the tactical potential of machine guns was not appreciated by the British Armed Forces. The prevalent attitude of senior ranks at the outbreak of the Great War can be summed up by the opinion of an officer expressed a decade earlier that a single battery of machine guns per army corps was a sufficient level of issue.

Despite the evidence of fighting in Manchuria (1905 onwards) the army went to war with each infantry battalion and cavalry regiment containing a machine gun section of just two guns.

This was soon increased to four guns per section.

These organic (embedded) units were supplemented in November 1914 by the formation of the Motor Machine Gun Service (MMGS) administered by the Royal Artillery, consisting of motor-cycle mounted machine gun batteries.

A machine gun school was also opened in France.

After a year of warfare on the Western Front some commanders advocated crewing them with specially trained men who were not only thoroughly conversant with their weapons but understood how they should be best deployed for maximum effect. To achieve this, the Machine Gun Corps was formed in October 1915 – by Command of Brigadier H.B. de Lisle to Captain Ross McGillycuddy (4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards) with Infantry, Cavalry, and Motor branches, followed in 1916 by the Heavy Branch. A depot and training centre was established at Belton Park near Grantham, Lincolnshire, and a base depôt at Camiers in France. Captain, then Major, McGillycuddy attended an earlier Machine Gun School at Hythe. He formed there, as an ex-Gunner, certain theories on the use of the Machine Gun from which he was able to turn to good account in the war of 1914 to 1918.
==Branches==

*The Infantry Branch was by far the largest and was formed by the transfer of battalion machine gun sections to the MGC. These sections were grouped into Brigade Machine Gun Companies, three per division and a specialist officer was added to each brigade headquarters to coordinate their use. New companies were raised at Grantham. In 1917, a fourth company was added to each division. In February and March 1918, the four companies in each division were formed into a Machine Gun Battalion. The Infantry Branch was dependent on horse drawn transport. Each section of four guns required two wagons for the guns and a third for 32,000 rounds of ammunition.
* The Guards Division formed its own machine gun support unit, the Guards Machine Gun Regiment.
* The Cavalry Branch consisted of Machine Gun Squadrons, one per cavalry brigade.
* The Motor Branch was formed by absorbing the Motor Machine Gun Service and the armoured car squadrons of the recently disbanded Royal Naval Armoured Car Service. It formed several types of units: motor cycle batteries, light armoured motor batteries (LAMB) and light car patrols. As well as motor cycles, other vehicles used included Rolls-Royce and Ford Model T cars.
* The Heavy Section was formed on 1 May 1916, becoming the Heavy Branch in November of that year. Men of C and D Companies of this branch crewed the first tanks in action at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, during the Battle of the Somme on 15-16 September 1916 and throughout the Autumn. In July 1917, the Heavy Branch separated from the MGC to become the Tank Corps, later called the Royal Tank Regiment.

There was also a Canadian Machine Gun Corps.

==First World War==

The MGC saw action in all the main theatres of war, including the Western Front in France and Belgium, Sinai and Palestine Campaign, Mesopotamian campaign, Egypt, Salonika, East Africa campaign and Italian front. In its short history, the MGC gained an enviable record for heroism as a front line fighting force. In the latter part of the war, as tactics changed to defence in depth, it commonly served well in advance of the front line. It had a less enviable record for its casualty rate. Some 170,500 officers and men served in the MGC, with 62,049 becoming casualties, including 12,498 killed, earning it the nickname &#x27;the Suicide Club&#x27;.

While the undeniable bravery and self-sacrifice of the corps stands testament to the men and their regimental esprit de corps it is also a symptom of the fixed belief on the part of senior commanders that machine guns were confined to a marginal if useful role, that of an adjunct to massed rifle fire, ignoring the proven potential of this weapon in the indirect role (in effect rifle-calibre fire employed as ultra-short artillery.) By correctly setting up the same weapons more commonly used in the direct role (over open sights) the delivering of accurate and sustained fire at high elevation became less an art than a science that could reliably deliver plunging fire at approximately twice the maximum effective range of hand-held weapons of identical calibre, but not so convincingly a belief to hold that the machine gunners were in effect hiding behind the front lines while uselessly firing into the air, making a show instead of dying beside riflemen whose weapons used practically identical ammunition.

This conviction may explain–from both sides–the persistence with which machine gunners were placed in exposed positions where their fire was only marginally effective but enemy troops could be seen to fall victim to it, and the great personal bravery with which those same men fought when the same enemy concentrated their forces against the greater threat represented by an unsupported sandbag emplacement.

As stated by Paul Cornish in &quot;Machine Guns and the Great War:&quot;

&quot;The theory behind this technique had long been understood... as early as 1908... the mathematical work required to provide a reliable basis for the conduct of such fire was carried out by a group of British enthusiasts at the Hythe musketry school... However, it was 1915 before such fire was successfully carried out in the field...&quot;

Cornish goes on &quot;To conduct such fire the proposed target would be located... the relative position of the machine gun relative to it would be determined with ruler and protractor.. calculations would be made to determine the gun&#x27;s potential cone of fire and the trajectory of its bullets (an important consideration if firing over the head of friendly troops). A clinometer, combined with a graduated elevation dial fitted to the tripod would be employed to set the gun to the correct elevation...&quot;

The obvious complexities and the exacting preparations - in effect identical to those of artillery gunners - may have seemed arcane and pointless to those who carried - or whose men carried - rifles firing the same ammunition but could neither see (or more importantly imagine) the terminal effect of a long-range barrage.

When properly employed it was unarguably a devastating deterrent, as witnessed by those who took the trouble to seek out the areas interdicted but for those who took the trouble to do so were often regarded uncritical advocates of novel, untried tactics. 

While in the more sustained direct fire role, properly supported: The 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps at High Wood on August 24, 1916 was ordered to &quot;give sustained covering fire for 12 hours onto a selected area 2000 yards away in order to prevent German troops forming up there for a counter-attack while a British attack was in progress&quot; The ten machine guns of the company used 100 new barrels and &quot;every drop of water in the neighbourhood, including the men&#x27;s drinking water and contents of the latrine buckets, went up in steam to keep the guns cool&quot; . And in that 12-hour period the ten guns fired a million rounds...&quot;

Towards the end of the Great War some if not all deeply-entrenched attitudes were changing, and not only on the part of British and Commonwealth personnel. Following the extensive barrage fire at Vimy Ridge and Battle of Messines a demonstration was held on the dunes at Camiers by request of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, who insisted all his Corps commanders attend.

French observers were treated to a similar demonstration, after which the concept was swiftly introduced into the French Army where it was embraced as a means to economise on artillery shells with the extraordinary assertion the results were more demoralising &#x27;by means of continuity&#x27; than the result of shelling. Subsequently a machine gun school was established near the site of both demonstrations and machine gun barrages were successfully employed used by the French forces Meuse and Verdun.

==Post war==
At the end of hostilities, the MGC was re-organised in a smaller form as many of its soldiers returned to civilian life. However, the Corps continued to see active service notably in the Russian Civil War; the Third Anglo-Afghan War, and the ongoing conflict in the Northwest Frontier of India.

The MGC also served prominently in the British force that occupied parts of Germany in the period between the Armistice of 1918 and the Versailles Peace Treaty of 1919 as its equipment and training made it possible for a relatively small garrison to control a large population but by 1920 the headquarters in Belton Park was closed and the War Office began to dispose of the many buildings.

In 1922 the Machine Gun Corps was disbanded as a cost-cutting measure.

==Victoria Crosses==
The following members of the Machine Gun Corps have been awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.
* Harold Sandford Mugford, April 11th 1917 at Monchy-le-Preux, France
* John Reginald Noble Graham, April 22nd 1917 at Istabulat, Mesopotamia
* Allan Ebenezer Ker, March 21st 1918 near Saint-Quentin, France
* Herbert George Columbine, March 22nd 1918 at Hervilly Wood, France
* Arthur Henry Cross, March 25th 1918 at Ervillers, France
* William Allison White, September 18th 1918 at Gouzeaucourt, France
* David Stuart McGregor, October 22nd 1918 near Hoogemolen, Belgium

==Machine Gun Corps Memorial, London==

A memorial to the 15,552 wartime fatalities of the Machine Gun Corps was unveiled on 10 May 1925 by the Duke of Connaught, at Hyde Park Corner in London. It features a bronze statue by Francis Derwent Wood in the Renaissance style, depicting the youthful David after his defeat of the giant Goliath, an event described in the Book of Samuel; on lower plinths flanking the figure are two bronze models of Vickers machine guns, wreathed in laurels.

A short service of remembrance known as the Annual Observance is held on the second Saturday in May at the Memorial, which is organised by the Machine Gun Corps Old Comrades&#x27; Association. On Remembrance Sunday, the second Sunday in November, there is also a wreath laying ceremony held in conjunction with the ceremony at the nearby Royal Artillery Memorial.

<text>Southern Kurdish () is one of the dialects of the Kurdish language, spoken predominantly in northeastern Iraq and western Iran. The Southern Kurdish-speaking region spans from Khanaqin in Iraq to Dehloran southward and Asadabad eastward in Iran.

== Name ==
&#x27;Southern Kurdish&#x27; is a linguistic term for a group of related dialects in Western Iran. Speakers are not familiar with the term and do not refer to the language as such. They generally identify the kind of Kurdish they speak as a local dialect (the Kurdish of a given village), or as a regional variety such as &quot;Garūsi&quot;.

==Variants==
Southern Kurdish has many variants, linguist Fattah divides them into 35 varieties. These include:

* Bîcarî 
** The most septentrional variety of Southern Kurdish spoken in and around Bijar in Iran. Bîcarî is the only Southern Kurdish variety detached from the greater Southern Kurdish-speaking region.
* Qurweyî (Chahar Dawli Xarbi)
** The Quwreyî variety is spoken around Ghorveh in Iran and is related to the variety spoken in Asadabad and other Kurdish-speaking areas in Hamadan Province.
* Kulyayî
** The Kulyayî variety is spoken northeast of Kermanshah, principally in Sonqor County and surrounding counties. The variety also spans into the Kolyai Rural District in Hamadan Province.
* Bîlewerî
** The principal Southern Kurdish variety in Poshtdarband Rural District in Kermanshah.
* Dînewerî
** About 83 villages in Dinavar District speak the Dînewer variety. The differences between the Dînewerî and the Kulyayî varieties are anodine.
* Sehne / Lekî-Kirmaşanî
** The Sehne variety, or Lekî-Kirmaşanî has many similar characteristics with Lekî and is spoken in Harsin County and in Sahneh. What distinguishes it most from Lekî is the lack of the ergative case.
* Kurdelî Pahlavi is quite distant, and may be a distinct language.
Other variants include: Bîstûnî, Çihrî, Hersîn, Payrawend, Kirmaşanî, Sencabî, Xalesa, Çemçemal, Qesri Şîrînî, Serpuli Zehawî, Harasam, Kelhurrî, Îwan, Erkewazî, Şêrwanî, Îlamî, Salihabadî, Rîka, Bedreyî, Melikşahî, Mêxasî, Mihran, Xaneqînî, Mendilî, Duşêxî, Kaprat, Warmizyar, Zurbatiya and Feylî.

== Alphabet ==
The Southern Kurdish alphabet is very similar to the Central Kurdish (Sorani) alphabet, which is a derivation of the Arabic alphabet.
Southern Kurdish has one additional letter &quot;ۊ&quot;; the Arabic letter waw with two dots above.

<text>Below is the timeline of events that followed the runoff presidential election held in Ukraine on 21 November 2004 that sparked off the &quot;Orange Revolution&quot;.

==21 November==

Shortly after the polling stations closed in the evening, several exit polls were released showing a substantial lead for Viktor Yushchenko. The first poll, conducted by several Ukrainian research organisations, gave Yuchshenko 54% of the vote, against Viktor Yanukovych&#x27;s 43%. The results were based on the answers of 77% of 30,000 voters questioned at nearly 500 polling stations around the country. The second poll, conducted by Ukraine&#x27;s Social Monitoring Centre, put Yushchenko ahead by 49.5% to 45.9%. These results were disputed by the Yanukovych campaign team, who quoted their own exit polls giving their candidate a 3% to 5% lead.

Tens of thousands of opposition supporters, including members of the PORA student movement, gathered in Independence Square in Kyiv to see the results broadcast live on television.

==22 November ==

At 02:00 the Central Election Commission (CEC) of Ukraine announced that after 33% of accounted votes Viktor Yanukovich was ahead with 50% to the 46% for Viktor Yushchenko. That data sharply deviated from the results of several groups of sociologists who in the instant after the end of the voting declared Yushchenko&#x27;s victory. Yushchenko travelled to CEC to meet with Serhiy Kivalov. After a meeting behind closed doors Yushchenko announced: &quot;We do not trust the accountability of the Central Election Commission. We call on our supporters to come on to Maidan of Independence and protect their freedom.&quot;

The same night in Kyiv armoured vehicles arrived. BTRs appeared next to the building of CEC. Under the reinforced security was taken the building complex of the presidential administration. The order in the capital was carried out by several ten thousands of military personnel of the Internal Affairs and spetsnaz.

Ukraine&#x27;s CEC announced that with 99% of the vote counted, Yanukovych had 49.4% of the vote while Yushchenko had 46.7%. This was rejected by the opposition, with Yushchenko calling on supporters to protest &quot;the total falsification of the vote.&quot; The rally in Kyiv grew in size while large demonstrations were also held elsewhere in Ukraine. Some of the demonstrators set up tents in Kyiv&#x27;s Independence Square. Later that night, Yushchenko told supporters to stay in the square overnight to keep the tent encampment safe from security forces who wanted to dismantle it.

We have received information that authorities want to destroy our tent city at 3 a.m. ... At two o&#x27;clock there should be more of us than now. We must defend every chestnut tree, every tent. We must show to the authorities we are here for a long time... There must be more and more of us here every hour.

City councils of four major cities in Western Ukraine, including L&#x27;viv and Ivano-Frankivs&#x27;k, refused to recognize the official results and declared that Yushchenko had won the election. The chairman of the Russian State Duma, Boris Gryzlov, acting as the observer, estimated the declared results as final and congratulated Viktor Yanukovich on his victory, following which Vladimir Putin did the same.

Despite the cold weather and fear caused by the relocation of the military vehicles and the special operations personnel, the supporters of Yushchenko gathered around 100-150 thousands of followers. All of the leaders of the &quot;opposition&quot; came to the meeting, including Viktor Yushchenko, Yulia Timoshenko, the leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine Oleksandr Moroz, the head of the Party of industrialists and entrepreneurs Anatoliy Kinakh.

Yushchenko called the Ukrainians to the organized resistance movement. Timoshenko called for the start of mass strikes in industries and higher level educational institutions, as well as for the closure of all the roads, airports, and railways.

The Yushchenko administration requested for an extraordinary seating of the Rada, the annulation of the election in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts where no observers or journalists were allowed after the closing of the electoral districts.

Numerous tent-cities of the Pora! organization were installed on the Khreschatyk and on the streets and squares adjacent to it.

The chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Richard Lugar declared: &quot;Now it became apparent that the aggressive and powerful plan of falsification and infringement at the day of election was conducted whether under the coordination or cooperation with the government.&quot; The chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the European Parliament Elmar Brok threatens Ukraine with financial sanctions if the information about the falsification will be confirmed. The Russian ambassador in Washington, D.C., Yuri Ushakov, was invited for a discussion with the assistant of the United States Secretary of State A. Elizabeth Jones who expresses concerns of rushing when the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin congratulated Viktor Yanukovich.

==23 November==

Approximately 100,000 Yushchenko supporters gathered in Kyiv awaiting a session of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x27;s parliament, in the hope that it would discuss the accusations of fraud and come to a solution. Thousands of people travelled to the capital from across Ukraine, though their journeys were disrupted by government closures of major roads and airports. Similar gatherings of protesters took place in other major cities, especially L&#x27;viv.

In a session of parliament boycotted by supporters of Yanukovych, Yushchenko took the presidential oath although the parliament lacked the quorum to do this legally. The oath-swearing was thus of purely symbolic value.

==24 November==

Rumours circulated that Yanukovych and Yushchenko had agreed to hold talks to negotiate over the disputed election results; this was later denied, with the government opposition refusing to meet Yanukovych. Protests continued into a third day in Kyiv after an appeal by Yushchenko for their continuation. More supporters of both sides arrived at the city from outlying areas of the country. Riot police were called to protect the election commission building.

Yushchenko urged his supporters to engage in a series of nationwide general strikes – an &quot;Orange Revolution&quot;, after his campaign color – with the intent of crippling the government and forcing Yanukovych to concede defeat. Hundreds of tents were erected in Kyiv&#x27;s Independence Square and the nearby Lenin Library was taken over to serve as the protesters&#x27; headquarters. The protesters also blockaded the Council of Ministers in Kyiv, paralysing the government.

==25 November==

The Ukrainian Supreme Court ordered the Central Election Commission not to publish the election results until the opposition&#x27;s charges of electoral fraud had been addressed. This was seen as a major victory for the opposition, as it effectively suspended official recognition of the results.

==26 November==
Round table talks organized by the out-going President Leonid Kuchma began between Yanukovych and Yushchenko. At Kuchma&#x27;s request high-level foreign mediators also took part in the talks. These were: Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus, Russian Duma Speaker Boris Gryzlov, European Union&#x27;s foreign policy chief Javier Solana and OSCE Secretary General Ján Kubiš. Speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, Volodymyr Lytvyn, was also present at the round table. (ABC News)

Television coverage of the opposition rallies, which had hitherto been patchy, was now greatly increased and opposition statements were widely reported for the first time. However, local television stations in Yanukovych&#x27;s heartland of eastern Ukraine continued to toe the government line by not screening images of the demonstrations.

==27 November==

After failing to reach an agreement with Yanukovych, Yushchenko announced that he would only agree to further negotiations if they would be on the subject of holding another vote. (Irish Times)

On the same day the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, declared the poll results invalid, and also passed a vote of no confidence in Ukraine&#x27;s Central Election Commission. The declaration was, however, not binding and did not overturn the need for the Supreme Court to issue a ruling. (BBC)

==28 November==

The issue of separatism was raised when governors of eastern and southern regions met with Yanukovych and Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov in Syeverodonetsk, Luhansk region, to discuss autonomy or a separate republic for the Russian-speaking parts of Ukraine. Borys Kolesnikov, president of the Donetsk region council, suggested turning Ukraine into a federation and creating a new South-East Ukrainian Autonomous Republic with its capital in Kharkiv. Yushchenko criticized these ideas as anti-constitutional, and observers suggested that Yanukovych&#x27;s apparent support for separatism had damaged the standing of the government side.

Over 10,000 IM (Internal Ministry) troops mobilized to put down the protests in Independence Square in Kyiv according to their commander Lt. Gen. Sergei Popkov. The SBU (Ukrainian Security Service, successor to KGB) warned opposition leaders of the crackdown. Oleksandev Galaka, head of GRU (military intelligence) made calls to &quot;prevent bloodshed&quot;. Col. Gen. Ihor P. Smesko (SBU chief) and Maj. Gen. Vitaly Romanchenko (military counter-intelligence chief) both warned Popkov to pull back his troops, which he did.

==29 November and 30 November ==

Talks were held between the government and opposition but ended inconclusively, with Yushchenko reportedly refusing an offer from Yanukovych of the post of prime minister if the opposition accepted Yanukovych as president. Yanukovych&#x27;s alternative suggestion was a fresh election with neither himself nor Yushchenko as candidates; this was also rejected. The outgoing president Leonid Kuchma announced that he would support holding an entirely new presidential election, not just a re-run of the disputed second round.

On November 29, Yanukovych&#x27;s campaign manager, Serhiy Tyhypko, announced his resignation from both his position in the Yanukovych campaign and his position as the head of the National Bank of Ukraine. Asked by Channel 5 TV on whether he would possibly run for president if repeat elections went forward, Tyhypko replied positively. Yanukovych reacted angrily to Tyhypko&#x27;s move, calling him a &quot;mischievous cat&quot;.

At the same time, the opposition seemed to suffer a setback as the Ukrainian parliament initially failed to pass a motion of no confidence in the Yanukovych government.

==1 December==

The Ukrainian parliament passed a motion of no confidence in the Yanukovych government with 229 votes in favour and voted to create a &quot;government of national trust.&quot; The vote urges President Leonid Kuchma to dismiss Yanukovych and appoint a caretaker prime minister, who would probably be parliamentary speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn. Kuchma has the option of rejecting the vote but the parliament can override his veto with a new vote that would need to attract a two-thirds majority (301 of the 450 deputies). Although he has not commented publicly on the vote, his aides have reportedly rejected it.

On the same day, the round table talks were resumed. As a gesture of goodwill, Yushchenko agreed to tell his supporters to cease their blockade of official buildings in Kyiv so that government work could resume.

Yanukovych&#x27;s camp submitted a complaint to the Ukrainian Supreme Court protesting alleged irregularities in Yushchenko-supporting regions of Ukraine and Kyiv. With both camps now complaining that the election results were falsified and appealing for an annulment, the likelihood of the Supreme Court declaring the results invalid was seen to have increased significantly.

==2 December==

Presidents Kuchma and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Moscow to discuss the ongoing crisis. The two presidents issued a statement calling for an entirely new election—not just a re-run of the disputed second round. This proposal was rejected by Yushchenko&#x27;s camp, as it would allow Kuchma to stay in power for several more months and could break the momentum of the opposition. Yushchenko declared that he would hold out for an immediate re-run.

President George W. Bush also issued a statement, saying that any new poll should be open, fair and free of foreign influence, and that the will of the Ukrainian people must be known and heard.

Fears were expressed about the damage the crisis could cause to Ukraine&#x27;s economy. The national currency, the hryvnia, continued to fall against other currencies and the Ukrainian Central Bank imposed a limit on cash withdrawals on all banks to guard against a run on the currency developing.

==3 December==

After five days of deliberations, Ukraine&#x27;s Supreme Court declared the results of the run-off election to be invalid. The court&#x27;s chairman, Anatoly Yarema, ordered that a repeat vote should take place within three weeks counting from December 5 (i.e., no later than 26 December).

This would be a re-run of the run-off vote only, rather than the wholly new election in three months&#x27; time which President Kuchma and Putin had supported. The yukusuchunky camp attacked in court the validity of the second round only, and therefore the Supreme Court could only annul the results of the second round. For the first round to be also annulled and repeated (as the Kuchma/Yanukovych camp desired), further evidence would have had to be brought in that would challenge the validity of the first vote. Neither side, however, chose to do that. Both sides committed themselves to abiding by the court&#x27;s decision, which they regarded as final.

Meanwhile, the Parliament voted to ask outgoing President Leonid Kuchma to withdraw the country&#x27;s 1,600 troops from Iraq. The proposal was suggested by the Communist group, and passed by 257 out of the 450-member parliament. Both presidential candidates had previously supported a Ukrainian withdrawal.

==4 December==

As Yushchenko supporters have received what they wanted from Ukraine&#x27;s Supreme Court, protests calmed down in Kyiv although supporters of the Orange Revolution remain in Independence Square.

On this day the Ukrainian parliament failed to adopt election law changes that were requested by the Yushchenko faction. Kuchma accused him of reneging on agreements made on an earlier date. The Socialist and the Communist Parties had agreed to vote in favour of the electoral changes if the opposition in turn supported constitutional changes meant to lessen the power of the President in favour of the Prime Minister and the Parliament. However that agreement fell through when Yushchenko said that constitutional changes would be considered only after the elections.

==5 December==

In an interview on BBC television Yushchenko asked for the international community not to interfere in the new election, although he welcomed foreign observers.

Yushchenko&#x27;s most prominent ally, the politician and businesswoman Yulia Tymoshenko, stated that she would like to be appointed prime minister if Yushchenko wins.

In his first interview since the Supreme Court ruling, President Kuchma pledged to abide by its decision and ruled out any repressive measures, such as the use of force or the introduction of a state of emergency. He also said that he was prepared to reform the 15-member Central Election Commission, which had been strongly criticised for apparently colluding in the fixing of the run-off vote. However, he refused to meet demands to sack Yanukovych, potentially setting up a fresh confrontation with the Ukrainian parliament, which had earlier passed a motion of no confidence in the government.

==6 December==

Speaking in Turkey, Russia&#x27;s President Putin strongly warned against foreign interference in Ukraine&#x27;s new election, accusing Western countries of trying to impose their definition of democracy on Ukraine.

Yushchenko continued to campaign for amendments to the election laws that would ban voting by absentee ballots and voting in people&#x27;s homes, both of which were seen as being among the most abused election provisions in the first two votes. He also rejected proposals by Kuchma that the powers of the president should be diluted and partially given to the parliament, in which pro-Yanukovych forces are still powerful.

==7 December - 8 December==

After several days of heated debate, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine&#x27;s parliament) agreed reform measures to change the electoral laws and institute changes to the governance of Ukraine. Key elements of the reforms include:

* Changes to the Central Election Commission and dismissal of some of its members;
* Tighter rules on absentee ballots and home voting to reduce the possibility of ballot fraud;
* Reduced presidential powers, with the president confined to appointing only the prime minister, defence and foreign ministers, subject to the approval of parliament;
* Greater powers for the regions, to reduce tensions between the west and east of the country.

The reform package received the approval of 402 of the 450 parliamentary deputies (with 21 votes against and 19 abstentions) and was immediately signed into law by President Kuchma. In response, the opposition agreed to end the blockade of government buildings from 1900 (local time) on December 8.

The reforms shift the balance of power within Ukraine, moving from the strong presidential system to a parliamentary system. The outcome is seen as a compromise between the rival camps, as the new election rules will improve Yushchenko&#x27;s chances of victory but the constitutional changes will enable the Kuchma/Yanukovych camp to exercise influence through parliament and the regions following the election.

Kuchma granted Yanukovych leave of absence to contest the December 26 election, and appointed First Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Azarov to serve as acting prime minister.

&quot;The Times&quot; reported that Austrian doctors had confirmed that Yushchenko&#x27;s mysterious illness was due to poisoning from a biological or chemical agent. Doctor Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus clinic, stated that his illness had resulted from &quot;high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally administered&quot;.

==6 January==
Yanukovych will challenge his defeat of the runoff election at the Supreme Court on Thursday, even though he has acknowledged he has no hope of success. The appeal was later rejected.

==10 January==
At 11:30 p.m. (Kyiv time), the Central Election Commission of Ukraine, in a live TV broadcast of the Commission meeting, officially announced that Viktor Yushchenko won the presidential elections. Results of the repeated second round are as follows:
==11 January==
The Supreme Court of Ukraine temporarily suspended the publication of the official results of the election, until the appeal of Yanukovych regarding the results would be considered by the Court.

==20 January==
At 2:40 a.m. (Kyiv time), the Supreme Court of Ukraine announced its decision to decline the appeal of Yanukovych. Election results (Act No. 14 of the Central Election Commission of Ukraine dated 10 January 2005) are being published in the official newspapers of the Verkhovna Rada and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.

The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine terminated the authority of Viktor Yushchenko as the parliamentary member (on his request). The parliament also designated 23 January 2005, noon (Kyiv time), as the day and time of the ceremonial assembly to hold the inauguration.

==23 January==
At noon (local time) Viktor Yushchenko is inaugurated as president of Ukraine.

==24 January==
Ukraine&#x27;s new president, Viktor Yushchenko, appoints Yulia Tymoshenko acting prime minister.

<doc id="1244958" wikidata="Q417695" url="?curid=1244958" title="Oxazolidine">
<text>Oxazolidine is a five-membered heterocycle ringwith the formula .The O atom and NH groups are not mutually bonded, in contrast to isoxazolidine. Oxazolidines (emphasis on plural) are derivatives of the parent oxazolidine owing to the presence of substituents on carbon and/or nitrogen. Oxazolines are unsaturated analogues of oxazolidines. 

==Synthesis and reactions==
First synthesized in the 1800s, oxazolidines are traditionally prepared by condensation of 2-aminoalcohols with aldehydes and ketones. The ready availability of chiral amino alcohols by reduction of amino acids enables the synthesis of chiral oxazolidines.

Oxazolidines are prone to hydrolysis, the reverse of their syntheses. Perhaps for this reason, their basicity is rarely discussed.

==Uses and occurrence==
Several oxazolidine derivatives occur naturally, Some occur as post translational modifications of proteins. Others are components of alkaloids, a few of which are highly active against some tumors. Examples include terazomine, quinocarcin, and tetrahydroisoquinoline.

Oxazolidines are used as moisture scavengers in polyurethane and other systems.

Oxazolidines have even been researched and used as fuel additives.

==Bisoxazolidines==
Bisoxazolidines contain two oxazolidine rings. They are the saturated analogues of bisoxazolines.

They are used as performance modifiers in polyurethane coatings and paints. The rings hydrolyze in the presence of moisture to give amine and hydroxyl groups, which can then react with diisocyanates, polyisocyanates and polyurethane prepolymers to form a coating. The amine groups will form urea linkages and the hydroxyl group will form urethane links. The use of a bisoxazolidine in a polyurethane system can prevent the unwanted reaction between isocyanate and moisture resulting in coating defects, as a result of carbon dioxide release. This moisture-triggered curing route is preferential to moisture cure. As the ring opening reaction is catalyzed by acids, usually organic acids or anhydrides of carboxylic acids are added in a small amount. 

The choice of linker between the two oxazolidine rings has a large impact on the performance when used to cure isocyanates. A rigid linker group increases a polyurethanes toughness. A flexible linker group imparts flexibility and increases elongation of a coating. These differences are the reason why bisoxazolidines are used to enhance the performance of polyurethane systems. Usually the rings are linked by esters, urethanes, carbonate or have the two rings fused together. A key intermediate in manufacturing bisoxazolidines is 2-[2-(propan-2-yl)-1,3-oxazolidin-3-yl]ethanol. The hydroxy group on the molecule allows for further reaction with hexamethylene diisocyanate for example.

Depending on the linker, bisoxazolines can function as chelating ligands.

<text>Thomas Kemper was a brewer of root beer, ginger ale, and other craft sodas under the Thomas Kemper Soda Co. label. Formerly owned by Pyramid Breweries, Inc., it was sold in 2007 to Adventure Funds of Portland, Oregon, which ran the company under the Kemper Co. name.

Thomas Kemper Brewing of Poulsbo was sold to Hart Brewing (later known as Pyramid) in 1992. (Thomas Kemper had been founded in 1985 on Bainbridge Island, and began making soft drinks in 1990.)

Thomas Kemper Soda was first brewed by Andy Thomas and Will Kemper (now brewing at Bellingham&#x27;s Chuckanut) as alternative to beer at an Octoberfest celebration on Bainbridge Island, WA in 1990. The first Thomas Kemper Soda was handcrafted Root Beer. Thomas Kemper Sodas were handcrafted and made with honey (although cane sugar was the primary sweetener), Madagascar vanilla, and other flavors.

The soda came in eight flavors: Root Beer, Vanilla Cream, Orange Cream, Ginger Ale, Grape, Black Cherry, Ginger Peach and Oregon Marionberry. Previously, there were Thomas Kemper varieties of Birch Beer and Cola as well.

==History==

Thomas Kemper started as a 1980s microbrewery well ahead of its time. The people involved had developed their brewing into an art and, as is standard with brewers, wanted to share it with the world. They grew the local following until the seams burst and moved in to what they considered a large brewing facility. They converted an old dairy farm near Poulsbo, Washington. It became their new brewery. They exploded again. They made Thomas Kemper into a &quot;local&quot; brand known almost exclusively to the Pacific Northwest. (Think Elysian, Silver City, or Sound Brewery). The Kemper beers drew aficionados from afar, and the Friday night fare at the brewery drew the locals. The Thomas Kemper Soda line was an example of fruit not falling far from the tree.

The &quot;beer&quot; and &quot;soda&quot; companies were kept separate and, in the spirit of their founding fathers, provided something for all.

1990: The first batch of Thomas Kemper Soda, Thomas Kemper Root Beer, was created for the Thomas Kemper Oktoberfest. Since 1989, the Thomas Kemper Brewing Company, one of the Northwest&#x27;s first Microbreweries, held an annual Oktoberfest celebration at their brewery. Starting out as a small event, the Thomas Kemper Oktoberfest soon was adding thousands of extra people to the population of Poulsbo, WA each autumn.

1991: Having done so well at the Thomas Kemper Oktoberfest, the Thomas Kemper Soda Company was formed. With very little advertising or marketing dollars, the young company relies on a &quot;grassroots&quot; campaign to get the word on its sodas out to consumers.

1992: The Thomas Kemper Brewing Company starts to grow, but is in need of the means to do it. Washington&#x27;s Hart Brewery buys Thomas Kemper and one of the craft beer industry&#x27;s first mergers takes place. Since the Soda operation had been separated from the parent firm, as a result of a divorce action between firm owners, it was not part of this deal and the folks at Hart will have to wait a few years to re-unite the sibling breweries.

1996: Thomas Kemper Sodas made the Guinness Book of World Records for creating the world&#x27;s largest root beer float. Using a 4,000-ton carbonating tank and 900 gallons of ice cream, Thomas Kemper made a 2,166.5 gallon root beer float.

1997: Thomas Kemper Sodas are re-united with the Thomas Kemper Beer when Pyramid Breweries Inc. buys Thomas Kemper Sodas. The move provides resources to help the soda company grow.

1997: To kick-off the summer, Thomas Kemper Sodas introduces its Thomas Kemper Orange Cream Soda.

1998: Thomas Kemper introduces its next flavor, Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda.

2001: Thomas Kemper launches two new soda fountain classics, Ginger Ale and Grape.

2007: Thomas Kemper is sold by Pyramid.

2011: Thomas Kemper is sold to Big Red, Inc.

2024: Thomas Kemper is no longer in production.

<doc id="1244966" wikidata="Q204699" url="?curid=1244966" title="Socialist Party of Indonesia">
<text>The Socialist Party of Indonesia () was a political party in Indonesia from 1948 until 1960, when it was banned by President Sukarno.

==Origins==
In December 1945, Amir Sjarifoeddin&#x27;s Socialist Party of Indonesia (Parsi) and Sutan Sjahrir&#x27;s Socialist People&#x27;s Party (Parsas), both of which had only recently been established, merged to form the Socialist Party. Sjahrir became leader of the combined party. It was popular among young intellectuals and students, as well as members of the underground movements led by the two men during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. At the end of 1945, the Socialist Party gained five of the 25 seats on the working committee of the Central Indonesian National Committee, the &quot;de facto&quot; legislature. Both Sjahrir and Amir served terms as prime minister, while other Socialist Party members held senior cabinet posts.

From 1947, divisions appeared between Sjahrir and Amir, as Amir and his communist allies gained more and more influence over the party. In June 1947, Amir ousted Sjahrir. The second party called the Socialist Party of Indonesia was founded on 12 February 1948 by Sjahrir after his departure from the Socialist Party. Joining him in the new party were Lintong Mulia Sitorus and other followers who agreed with his position on nationalism and not having a strongly pro-Soviet line. The party also launched a newspaper called &quot;Sikap&quot;, which Sitorus edited.

==The PSI in the Liberal Democracy Era==

Following the dissolution of the United States of Indonesia and the reestablishment of the unitary Republic of Indonesia in 1950, the PSI was awarded 17 of the 232 seats in the new legislature, the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR), a total in proportion to the estimated strength of the party.

The PSI held its first party congress in 1952.

In the 1955 legislative election, the PSI won only 2% of the vote, resulting in five seats in the legislature. This was a far smaller share of the vote than had been expected.

The second party congress was held in June 1955.

==Decline and fall==

After the 1955 elections, a clear political division between Java and the outer islands opened up. This was followed by a military crisis brought about by army chief-of-staff General Nasution&#x27;s plan to implement widespread transfers of officers, many of whom had built up private business interests in the regions. On 20 July 1956, the most prominent non-Javanese politician, Vice-president Hatta, resigned with effect from 1 December. Tired of the political infighting, on 28 October, President Sukarno called for an end to political parties. This would lead to his 1957 conception of “guided democracy”, which the PSI opposed.

In December 1956, several army commanders in Sumatra announced they had taken over civil government. This crisis spread and in March 1957, the military commander of East Indonesia imposed martial law over his command area. In March 1957 the cabinet resigned and Sukarno proclaimed martial law nationwide. In May 1957, PSI economist Professor Sumitro Djojohadikusumo left Jakarta for Sumatra, followed by other political figures. In January 1958, the PSI demanded a new cabinet, and the following month dissidents in Padang, West Sumatra issued an ultimatum demanding the dissolution of the cabinet within five days. Despite efforts by the PSI in Jakarta to forestall a rebellion, on 15 February a rebel government was proclaimed in Bukitinggi called the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI). It was headed by Amir Sjarifoeddin as prime minister and included Burhanuddin Harahap from the Masyumi Party and Sumitro Djojohadikusumo. Hatta and PSI leaders in Jakarta called for a negotiated settlement, but the government decided on a military solution, which defeated the rebellion by mid-1958.

Sukarno implemented his plan for guided democracy by issuing a decree restoring the 1945 Constitution. The PSI was not represented in either the new cabinet, the Supreme Advisory Council nor the National Planning Council established under the new system. Finally, in August 1960, President Sukarno formally banned the PSI and the Masyumi Party for their opposition to Guided Democracy and their alleged support of the PRRI rebellion.

==Party philosophy==
The party&#x27;s philosophy was based on Fabianism with elements of Marxist social analysis. There was a distinct Indonesian character to the party&#x27;s brand of socialism. It stressed the need for modernization, economic development and rational planning and organization, while opposing extreme nationalism and anti-foreign sentiment. It accepted the need for foreign capital, but party leaders criticized what they saw as the Hatta cabinet&#x27;s overcautious foreign policy and the strong influence of the United States over it. They strongly opposed the party siding with either the United States or the Soviet Union.

Rather than building support among the masses, the party aimed to develop a well-trained core of members. It had considerable influence among high-level bureaucrats and the leadership of the army. Sultan Hamengkubuwana IX and Nasution did not belong to the PSI, but they had strong informal links with it.

<text>In anthropology, first contact is the first meeting of two communities previously without contact with one another. Notable examples of first contact are those between the Spanish Empire and the Arawak in 1492; and the Aboriginal Australians with Europeans in 1788 when the First Fleet arrived in Sydney.

Such contact is sometimes described as a &quot;discovery&quot;, such as the British and United States did by creating the legal theory of the &quot;Doctrine of Discovery&quot;. It is generally the more technologically complex society that is able to travel to new geographic regions to make contact with those more isolated, less technologically complex societies. However, some object to the application of such a word to human beings, which is why &quot;first contact&quot; is generally preferred. The use of the term &quot;discovery&quot; tends to occur more in reference to geography than cultures; for an example of a common discovery debate, see Discoverer of the Americas.

The fascination with first contact has gone through many transformations since the Age of Discovery, one of the earliest narratives being about contacting the Ten Lost Tribes and Prester John, and continues today as a trope in science fiction about extraterrestrial first contact, as well as being manifest in contemporary space exploration (for example the Pioneer plaque).

Establishing contact with uncontacted peoples is still attempted, despite the negative effects, history and opposition by indigenous peoples, advocacy groups and specialized institutions like FUNAI.

== Consequences ==
The historical record has repeatedly demonstrated that when one culture is significantly more technologically advanced than the other, this side is usually favored by the disruptive nature of conflict, often with dire consequences for the other society, though the transmission of diseases between cultures also plays a critical role in the process. More isolated peoples who lived across broader territories at lower population densities have generally succumbed to the illnesses brought from the comparatively higher densities of Eurasian peoples. Indigenous populations simply did not have time to develop immunity to the foreign diseases, all introduced at once, to which the more urbanised European populations had had many generations to develop some partial immunity. The relative sizes of the contact populations can influence the process of inter-cultural development, as seen in Viking Greenland or in the Roanoke Colony.

Possible outcomes of contact for the groups involved may include:

* social integration
* colonization
* elimination (genocide)

== History ==
Long before contemporary uncontacted peoples, there were many more cases of communities and states being isolated from each other, sometimes only having poor knowledge of each other and poor contact. One such case is the poor formal contact between Europe and China in the course of the long history of the Silk Road trade and later contact with the Mongol Empire. Frustration with the lack of contact gave rise to the characterization of China as isolationist, and after being identified with Greater India and Prester John, the European powers, such as the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator, attempted to reach the isolated Greater India by travelling westward. The European colonial powers thereby mistakenly identified the Americas as the West Indies - a part of Greater India - and named the indigenous peoples of the Americas incorrectly as &quot;Indians&quot;. This contacting has been called one-sided &quot;discovery&quot; as is the case with discovery doctrine, and has been reinvented contemporarily by narratives of first contact beyond Earth finding its way into actual space exploration (for example the Pioneer plaque). It has been argued that, for colonialism, this seeking out of first contact proved to be a crucial element to gain control over knowledge and representation of the other, fetishizing and objectifying contact and its place on the frontier drawing a long history of one-sided contact, until today with indigenous peoples and specifically uncontacted peoples.

== Notable examples ==
Numerous important instances of first contact have occurred without detailed contemporary recordings across Eurasia and Africa, including the 330 BC invasions of Alexander the Great from Persia to India and the establishment of Romano-Chinese relations in the 2nd century AD. However, well-established trade routes from prehistoric times meant that many of the cultures would have been aware of the other before they met.

<text>State Route 526 (SR 526), also known as the Boeing Freeway, is a state highway in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. The east–west highway travels and connects SR 525 in Mukilteo to Interstate 5 (I-5) in southern Everett. The highway serves the Boeing Everett Factory and Paine Field; it also serves as a main route to the city of Mukilteo and the state-run ferry to Whidbey Island.

SR 526 was established during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to Secondary State Highway 1I (SSH 1I) between Mukilteo and Everett. Its original route followed a wagon road traveling along Possession Sound that opened in 1914; it was moved onto its current route in 1967 after Boeing announced its intention to build a factory in Everett for its 747 airliner.

==Route description==
SR 526 begins as 84th Street Southwest at a signalized intersection with SR 525, named the Mukilteo Speedway, at Nelsons Corner in Mukilteo. The highway travels east through a residential neighborhood, heading towards an intersection with Paine Field Boulevard, signed as SR 525 Spur, at the Future of Flight Aviation Center and Paine Field. SR 526 turns northeast as the four-lane continuation of Paine Field Boulevard, curving north around the north–south runway of Paine Field and south of Japanese Gulch, into the city of Everett. The highway becomes the controlled-access Boeing Freeway and passes under the Boeing Access Road, a taxiway that connects the Boeing Everett Factory to Paine Field. SR 526 continues east and intersects Airport Road in a diamond interchange and Seaway Boulevard in a semi-directional T interchange, the main access roads to Paine Field and the Boeing factory, respectively, before widening to six lanes as it approaches its eastern terminus, an interchange with I-5. The freeway travels through a diamond interchange with Evergreen Way, located east of a pedestrian bridge over SR 526 and south of Cascade High School, where traffic heading towards I-5 northbound on a left directional exit and traffic heading towards I-5 southbound splits into two lanes, a normal lane and a high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV lane). SR 526 continues east, briefly paralleling the Interurban Trail, before the freeway travels towards I-5 on flyover ramps and the highway terminates at the northern terminus of SR 99 and the northern terminus of SR 527.

Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2013, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 526 was its interchange with Evergreen Way, carrying 75,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section of the highway was its western terminus at SR 525, carrying 8,500 vehicles. SR 526 is designated as part of the National Highway System for its whole length, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. WSDOT designates the entire route of SR 526 as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington.

==History==

SR 526 was established during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to SSH 1I between Mukilteo and Everett. The highways were preceded by the Mukilteo-Everett wagon road that was opened on August 14, 1914, traveling east along Possession Sound between Mukilteo and Everett, later renamed to Mukilteo Boulevard during the 1920s. The boulevard route had previously been surveyed in 1882 for a wagon road connecting Mukilteo to Lowell (now part of Everett) by the county government. SSH 1I was designated in 1937 along the route of Mukilteo Boulevard and a new highway connecting Mukilteo to U.S. Route 99 (US 99) in Lynnwood, traveling in a circular arc. SSH 1I was split into SR 525 from Lynnwood to Mukilteo and SR 526 from Mukilteo to Everett during the 1964 state highway renumbering. The eastern terminus of SR 526, an interchange with I-5 in Everett, was completed in February 1965 and later became the southern terminus of SR 529 until 1991. The interchange was later converted to a single-point urban interchange in 2007 as part of a WSDOT project to improve I-5 through Everett.

Planning for a new freeway to carry SR 526 was approved in 1967 during construction of the Boeing factory, which was expected to generate more traffic congestion. The route initially used Casino Road, which was a two-lane road between Nelsons Corner in Mukilteo and Beverly Park in Everett; the eastern terminus was located at its intersection with US 99. The road was plagued with severe congestion as it was the only major arterial serving the factory at the time; Boeing&#x27;s selection of the factory site was contingent on the road&#x27;s reconstruction into a four-lane highway. However, the federal Economic Development Administration denied Everett&#x27;s request for a funding grant towards the highway, leading the state to fund the construction despite facing a budget shortfall itself. While the state waited for sufficient funding to commence the project, Boeing constructed a temporary four-lane highway across the factory and parallel to Casino Road in June 1967 to relieve congestion on the latter road; at the same time, the section of Casino Road between Nelsons Corner and the west end of the controlled-access highway section was expanded to four lanes.

Construction of the permanent four-lane, controlled-access highway section commenced shortly after Peter Kiewit Sons won the contract in May 1968. The first part of the section, spanning between 20th Avenue West (now Seaway Boulevard) and US 99 (now Evergreen Way), opened on April 23, 1969; the whole section was opened by the end of the year. The western end of Casino Road was truncated at Airport Road, which was extended from 100th Street Southwest to the highway in connecting it with Post Road (now SR 96) at its interchange with I-5; this allowed the excluded section of Casino Road to connect with the rest of the highway. A ramp directly connecting northbound I-5 with westbound SR 526 was subsequently opened on November 13, 1970.

When Boeing expanded their factory in the early 1990s to accommodate 777 production, the state of Washington required that Boeing pay for upgrades to the connection between SR 526 and I-5. These upgrades resulted in a direct connection being built in 1995 to connect SR 526 to northbound I-5, which previously required the use of a loop ramp on SR 527. Additional upgrades included a high-occupancy vehicle lane on southbound I-5, along with a corresponding queue ramp on SR 526, and the construction of sound walls along the freeway.

Until 2000, SR 526 and 84th St. in Mukilteo was in a continuous alignment. When Paine Field Boulevard (SR 525 Spur) was completed in 2000, the alignment was changed to make the SR 526 expressway and Paine Field Boulevard continuous. The new intersection with 84th Street facilitated access to a new Boeing museum, the Future of Flight Aviation Center &amp; Boeing Tour, which opened in 2005.

There were proposals in the 1980s and 1990s to realign SR 525 such that it would intersect with SR 526 near the head of Japanese Gulch. The realignment was intended to facilitate a new ferry dock in Mukilteo and to avoid the population center of the city. While the plans for the new dock were finalized, no plans were presented for such a connection, aside from the construction of SR 525 Spur.

In response to the increased usage of SR 526, WSDOT considered a complete redesign of the route in 2017. However, after consulting with an advisory group composed of representatives from local city governments, transit agencies, and lobbying firms, WSDOT elected to make improvements to the section between Seaway Boulevard and the eastern terminus of the route. Such improvements include the construction of a new eastbound lane, the widening of the Seaway Boulevard eastbound on-ramp to the route, the addition of a ramp meter for the direct ramp to I-5 north, and the modification of the signal lights at the eastern terminus intersection with SR 99 and SR 527. The start of construction on the improvement project was slated for 2022, with work concluding in 2024. A different seismic retrofitting project involving the wrapping of steel &quot;jackets&quot; on the columns of bridges carrying SR 526 over Airport Road, Hardeson Road, and Casino Road, along with an on-ramp from Seaway Boulevard to eastbound SR 526, began in February 2023 and was completed that December; during preparations for the project, WSDOT contractor crews found excessive excrement on the girders and supports of two of the overpasses from roosting pigeons, requiring cleanup by a hazmat crew and the installation of gel discs underneath the overpasses to deter all birds from them.

<text>Geraldine McEwan (born Geraldine McKeown; 9 May 1932 – 30 January 2015) was an English actress, who had a long career in film, theatre and television. Michael Coveney described her, in a tribute article, as &quot;a great comic stylist, with a syrupy, seductive voice and a forthright, sparkling manner&quot;.

McEwan was a five-time Olivier Award nominee, and twice won the Evening Standard Award for Best Actress; for &quot;The Rivals&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Way of the World&quot; (1995). She was also nominated for the 1998 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for &quot;The Chairs&quot;. She won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for the 1990 television serial &quot;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&quot;, and from 2004 to 2009, she starred as the Agatha Christie sleuth Miss Marple, in the ITV series &quot;Marple&quot;.

==Early life==
She was born Geraldine McKeown on 9 May 1932 in Old Windsor, Berkshire, England, to Donald and Norah (née Burns) McKeown. She had Irish ancestors; her maternal grandfather came from Kilkenny while her paternal grandfather came from Belfast. Her father, a printers&#x27; compositor, ran the Labour Party branch in Old Windsor, a safe Conservative seat. She later simplified the spelling of her last name from McKeown to McEwan.

McEwan won a scholarship to attend Windsor County Girls&#x27; School, then a private school where she felt completely out of place, and took elocution lessons. However, in later life she said she had loved English and the teaching of Miss Meech in particular. In an interview with Cassandra Jardine of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2004, she said of herself around this time: &quot;I was very shy, very private&quot;, but after reading a poem (apparently Lady Macbeth&#x27;s speech &quot;Glamis thou art and Cawdor...&quot;) at a Brownie concert: &quot;I realised it was going to be a way in which I could manage the world. I could protect myself by losing myself in other people.&quot;

As a teenager, McEwan became interested in theatre and her theatrical career began at 14 as assistant stage manager at the Theatre Royal, Windsor. She made her first appearance on the Windsor stage in October 1946 as an attendant of Hippolyta in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and played many parts with the Windsor Repertory Company from March 1949 to March 1951, including a role in the Ruth Gordon biographical play &quot;Years Ago&quot; opposite guest player John Clark.

==Career==
===From 1951 to 1971===
McEwan made her first West End appearance at the Vaudeville Theatre on 4 April 1951 as Christina Deed in &quot;Who Goes There!&quot; The following year she appeared at the same theatre in &quot;Sweet Madness&quot; by Peter Jones. McEwan first appeared on television in a BBC series, &quot;Crime on Our Hands&quot; (1954), with Jack Watling, Dennis Price and Sonia Dresdel. In 1957, she took over from Joan Plowright in the Royal Court production of John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;The Entertainer&quot; during its West End run at the Palace Theatre.

McEwan appeared at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon during the late 1950s and early 1960s, during the period when it was evolving into the Stratford venue for the new Royal Shakespeare Company formed in 1960, and at The Aldwych, the RSC&#x27;s original London home.

During the 1958 season in Stratford, she played Olivia in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in a production directed by Peter Hall. After McEwan died, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Michael Billington wrote of this performance: &quot;At the time Olivia tended to be played as a figure of mature grief: McEwan was young, sparky, witty and clearly brimming with desire for Dorothy Tutin&#x27;s pageboy Viola.&quot; McEwan&#x27;s performance, according to Dominic Shellard, split contemporary critical opinion between those observers who considered it &quot;heretical&quot; and others who thought it &quot;revolutionary&quot;.

In the same season at Stratford, McEwan portrayed Marina in &quot;Pericles&quot; and Hero in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. She returned to the theatre in 1961 to portray Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, opposite Ian Bannen as the Prince, and Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; with Christopher Plummer as Benedict.

In a production of Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, directed by Sir John Gielgud in 1962, McEwan replaced Anna Massey as Mrs Teazle during the run at the Haymarket Theatre, London; her husband was played by Sir Ralph Richardson. After an American tour, this production was staged at the Majestic in New York in early 1963, and was McEwan&#x27;s debut on Broadway. Back in England, she appeared with Kenneth Williams in the original unsuccessful 1965 production of &quot;Loot&quot; by Joe Orton, which closed at the Wimbledon Theatre before reaching London.

After this debacle, she joined the National Theatre Company, then based at the Old Vic, following the suggestion of Sir Laurence Olivier, then its artistic director, and performed in 11 productions over the next 5 years. She appeared with Olivier in &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, staged by Glen Byam Shaw and first performed in February 1967.

Olivier asserted, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, that he had chosen August Strindberg&#x27;s play partly because it had a good part for McEwan: &quot;I didn&#x27;t give a damn if I made a success, I really didn&#x27;t; it was her success I was after&quot;. The notices though concentrated on his role as the Captain rather than McEwan&#x27;s as Alice, the Captain&#x27;s wife. A film version, with the same two leads, was released in 1969.

During her first period at the National, she also portrayed Angelica in William Congreve&#x27;s &quot;Love for Love&quot;, Raymonde Chandebise in Georges Feydeau&#x27;s &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot;, Millamant in &quot;The Way of the World&quot; and Vittoria Corombona in John Webster&#x27;s &quot;The White Devil&quot;. Until her roles in the plays by Strindberg and Webster, McEwan was viewed mainly as a comedian, but these parts were thought to have extended her range.

===In the 1970s and 1980s===
McEwan took the lead role in an adaptation for Scottish Television of Muriel Spark&#x27;s &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1978). She was Spark&#x27;s favourite in the role and came the closest to the character as Spark had imagined it; Brodie has also been portrayed on stage and screen by Vanessa Redgrave and Maggie Smith. Her other work for television in this period included roles in &quot;The Barchester Chronicles&quot; (1982) and &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot; (1985–86) with Prunella Scales as Mapp and McEwan as Lucia.

In 1983, McEwan played Mrs Malaprop in a production of Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot; at the National Theatre by Peter Wood which also featured Michael Hordern as Sir Anthony Absolute. Michael Billington wrote of this performance in 2015: &quot;It is easy to play the word-mangling Mrs Malaprop as a comic buffoon. But the whole point of McEwan&#x27;s performance was that she took language with fastidious seriousness, fractionally pausing before each misplaced epithet as if ransacking her private lexicography. As I said at the time, it was like watching a demolition expert trying to construct a cathedral.&quot; For this role, McEwan won the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Award for Best Actress.

She made her directorial debut, in 1988, with the Renaissance Theatre Company&#x27;s touring season, &quot;Renaissance Shakespeare on the Road&quot;, co-produced with the Birmingham Rep, and ending with a three-month repertory programme at the Phoenix Theatre in London. McEwan&#x27;s contribution was a light romantic staging of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, with Kenneth Branagh playing Touchstone as an Edwardian music hall comedian.

===Later career===
McEwan won another &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Best Actress Award in 1995 for her role as Lady Wishfort in a revival of Congreve&#x27;s &quot;The Way of the World&quot;, again at the National Theatre. Sheridan Morley, then theatre critic of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, wrote, &quot;Geraldine McEwan (in the performance of the night and her career) comes on looking like an ostrich which has mysteriously been crammed into a tambourine lined with fresh flowers.&quot;

With Richard Briers, she starred from November 1997 in a revival of Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s absurdist play &quot;The Chairs&quot; in a co-production between Simon McBurney&#x27;s Théâtre de Complicité and London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre (then temporarily based at the Duke of York&#x27;s) who had staged the British premiere 40 years earlier. This production had a brief run on Broadway between April and June 1998; McEwan was nominated for a Tony Award.

Her later television credits include &quot;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&quot; (1990), for which she won the British Academy Television Award as Best Actress in 1991, and &quot;Mulberry&quot; (1992–93). She was also in the &quot;Cassandra&quot; episode of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; (1999), playing a prescient computer. McEwan played the demented witch Mortianna in the film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (1991). In Peter Mullan&#x27;s &quot;The Magdalene Sisters&quot;, (2002), she played the role of Sister Bridget. In 2001, she voiced Margaret in the audio book &quot;Richard III&quot;.

McEwan was selected by Granada Television for &quot;Marple&quot; (2004–07), a new series featuring the Agatha Christie sleuth Miss Marple. She told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in a 2005 interview when the series was first being screened by PBS, &quot;I do enjoy playing very original and slightly eccentric characters. It is very amusing that Agatha Christie should have created this older woman who lives a very conventional life in a little country village and yet spends all her time solving violent crimes.&quot; She announced her retirement from the role early in 2008, after appearing in 12 films; she had fallen and broken a hip late the previous year. She was succeeded as Miss Marple in the series by Julia McKenzie.

In 2005, she provided the voice of Miss Thripp in the film &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; and again in &quot;A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot; in 2008.

==Personal life and death==
In 1953, McEwan married Hugh Cruttwell, whom she had first met when she was 14 years old, while working at the Theatre Royal, Windsor. Cruttwell was the Principal of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art from 1965 to 1984. They had a son Greg, who is an actor and screenwriter, and a daughter named Claudia.

McEwan was reported to have declined an OBE and later, a DBE (in 2002), but she did not respond to these claims.

McEwan died on 30 January 2015 at the Charing Cross Hospital in Hammersmith, aged 82, after suffering a stroke three months earlier.

<text>James Franklin Hyneman (; born September 25, 1956) is an American special effects expert who was co-host of the television series &quot;MythBusters&quot; alongside Adam Savage, where he became known for his distinctive beret and walrus moustache. He is also the owner of M5 Industries, the special effects workshop where &quot;MythBusters&quot; was filmed. 

He was an early competitor in &quot;Robot Wars&quot;, but his robot Blendo was deemed too dangerous for competition. He is the inventor of the Sentry, an unmanned firefighting robotic vehicle. He is also one of the designers of the aerial cable robotic camera system Wavecam used in sports and entertainment events.

==Early life==
Hyneman was born in Marshall, Michigan, and grew up on a farm in Columbus, Indiana. He said, &quot;I was a problematic kid, to be sure. I left home when I was 14 and hitchhiked all over the country.&quot; As a child, Hyneman spent time at Indiana University, where his mother was a graduate librarian. At age fifteen, he owned a pet store in a shopping mall in Columbus. Hyneman graduated from Columbus North High School in 1974.

==Academic life==
In 1981 Hyneman earned a degree in Russian linguistics from Indiana University Bloomington.

In November 2021, he was appointed professor of practice at LUT University in Lappeenranta, Finland, for a five-year term until November 2026, and gave his first lecture on prototypes on November 18, 2021.

===Honorary degrees===
He received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from Villanova University on May 16, 2010, and gave a commencement address. On November 25, 2011, Hyneman was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Twente for his role in the popularization of science and technology. In February 2017 he was named one of the fourteen new honorary doctors of technology by Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT.

==Career==
Hyneman has worked as a boat captain, certified divemaster, wilderness survival expert, linguist, pet store owner, animal wrangler, machinist, concrete inspector, and chef. He co-hosted &quot;MythBusters&quot; from 2003 to 2016.

===Special effects work===
Hyneman owns the special effects company M5 Industries in San Francisco. Some of his achievements in commercials include the can-spitting vending machine seen in 7 Up commercials, and his patented two-wheeled football shoe from Nike Lab commercials.

===Other appearances===
Hyneman and Adam Savage portray two army junk-sellers in the film &quot;The Darwin Awards&quot;. They appear during the story of the rocket-car, which they partially reproduced in the &quot;MythBusters&quot; series&#x27;s pilot episode and retested twice more.
Hyneman made a cameo appearance along with Savage on &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; on the May 1, 2008 episode &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;, where they play inspectors giving thumbs-up after seeing a shirt soaked in pepper spray catch fire when shot by a taser. They tested this myth on &quot;MythBusters&quot; and declared it confirmed with certain types of pepper spray.

He and Savage executive produced and appeared as judges on the game show &quot;Unchained Reaction&quot;, which premiered in March 2012. The two also voiced characters on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Daughter Also Rises&quot; as a parody of themselves, the &quot;MythCrackers&quot;, which prompts Bart and Milhouse to experiment in a similar fashion. Both Hyneman and Savage also voiced stormtroopers in the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; &quot;Star Wars&quot; special.

==Personal life==
In 1984, Hyneman met science teacher Eileen Walsh when he owned a sailboat diving charter business in the Virgin Islands. Hyneman and Walsh married in 1989. Hyneman is an atheist. He has stated that, while he has not been formally diagnosed, he suspects he displays characteristics of autism spectrum disorder.

<doc id="1244992" wikidata="Q3406268" url="?curid=1244992" title="Moment problem">
<text>In mathematics, a moment problem arises as the result of trying to invert the mapping that takes a measure formula_1 to the sequence of moments

:formula_2

More generally, one may consider
:formula_3
for an arbitrary sequence of functions formula_4.

== Introduction ==

In the classical setting, formula_1 is a measure on the real line, and formula_6 is the sequence formula_7. In this form the question appears in probability theory, asking whether there is a probability measure having specified mean, variance and so on, and whether it is unique.

There are three named classical moment problems: the Hamburger moment problem in which the support of formula_1 is allowed to be the whole real line; the Stieltjes moment problem, for formula_9; and the Hausdorff moment problem for a bounded interval, which without loss of generality may be taken as formula_10.

The moment problem also extends to complex analysis as the trigonometric moment problem in which the Hankel matrices are replaced by Toeplitz matrices and the support of is the complex unit circle instead of the real line.

==Existence==

A sequence of numbers formula_11 is the sequence of moments of a measure formula_1 if and only if a certain positivity condition is fulfilled; namely, the Hankel matrices formula_13,

:formula_14

should be positive semi-definite. This is because a positive-semidefinite Hankel matrix corresponds to a linear functional formula_15 such that formula_16 and formula_17 (non-negative for sum of squares of polynomials). Assume formula_15 can be extended to formula_19. In the univariate case, a non-negative polynomial can always be written as a sum of squares. So the linear functional formula_15 is positive for all the non-negative polynomials in the univariate case. By Haviland&#x27;s theorem, the linear functional has a measure form, that is formula_21. A condition of similar form is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a measure formula_1 supported on a given interval formula_23.

One way to prove these results is to consider the linear functional formula_24 that sends a polynomial

:formula_25

to

:formula_26

If formula_27 are the moments of some measure formula_1 supported on formula_23, then evidently

Vice versa, if () holds, one can apply the M. Riesz extension theorem and extend formula_24 to a functional on the space of continuous functions with compact support formula_31), so that

By the Riesz representation theorem, () holds iff there exists a measure formula_1 supported on formula_23, such that

:formula_34

for every formula_35.

Thus the existence of the measure formula_1 is equivalent to (). Using a representation theorem for positive polynomials on formula_23, one can reformulate () as a condition on Hankel matrices.

== Uniqueness (or determinacy) ==

The uniqueness of formula_1 in the Hausdorff moment problem follows from the Weierstrass approximation theorem, which states that polynomials are dense under the uniform norm in the space of continuous functions on formula_10. For the problem on an infinite interval, uniqueness is a more delicate question. There are distributions, such as log-normal distributions, which have finite moments for all the positive integers but where other distributions have the same moments.

== Formal solution ==

When the solution exists, it can be formally written using derivatives of the Dirac delta function as
:formula_40.
The expression can be derived by taking the inverse Fourier transform of its characteristic function.

== Variations ==

An important variation is the truncated moment problem, which studies the properties of measures with fixed first moments (for a finite ). Results on the truncated moment problem have numerous applications to extremal problems, optimisation and limit theorems in probability theory.

== Probability ==

The moment problem has applications to probability theory. The following is commonly used:

By checking Carleman&#x27;s condition, we know that the standard normal distribution is a determinate measure, thus we have the following form of the central limit theorem:

<doc id="1244999" wikidata="Q959780" url="?curid=1244999" title="Gerry Byrne (footballer, born 1938)">
<text>Gerald Byrne (29 August 1938 – 28 November 2015) was an English footballer who spent his entire playing career at Liverpool. He was a member of England&#x27;s 1966 World Cup winning squad though only received a winner&#x27;s medal some years later.

==Life and playing career==

Byrne was born in Liverpool, and was of Irish descent. Byrne, like Jimmy Melia, joined Liverpool straight from school as a 15-year-old in 1953. Again like Melia, Byrne impressed manager Don Welsh who offered the full-back a professional contract the day after his 17th birthday on 30 August 1955. It was just over two years later that Byrne made his debut; Charlton Athletic thrashed the Reds 5–1 in a league match at The Valley on 28 September 1957, he had to wait a further years for his first goal which came in the 52nd minute of a 3–1 2nd Division win over Brighton at Anfield on 3 February 1962.

His debut was his only appearance during season 1957–58. Bill Shankly was appointed manager in December 1959 and at the season&#x27;s end had a clear out of 24 players. Notably Byrne was retained as was Roger Hunt. It was not until the arrival of Bill Shankly that he really got his chance; he featured in 38 league and cup matches as the Reds finished third for the fifth time in a row in the second division. Considering he only played seven times in the previous three seasons this was a major improvement in Gerry&#x27;s career; in fact, he was on the transfer list when Shankly arrived, soon to be removed.

Shankly again used Byrne&#x27;s grit and determination to its fullest, he was an ever-present as Liverpool, finally, romped to the 2nd division title, beating Leyton Orient into second spot by eight points. He played in 38 of Liverpool&#x27;s 42 league games their first year back in the big time and he also played in all seven of Liverpool&#x27;s cup ties during their run to the 1965 FA Cup final, a game in which Byrne would write his name in Liverpool folklore forever more.

===The 1965 FA Cup final===
Byrne played for Liverpool in the 1965 FA Cup final, which took place on 1 May at Wembley, with a broken collarbone. He suffered the injury as early as the third minute, but played on throughout the rest of the game and the whole of extra-time as Liverpool won the Cup for the very first time. The break happened after Byrne was challenged heftily by Leeds United&#x27;s captain Bobby Collins, but, with substitutes still not permitted by the authorities in 1965, he had little choice but to carry on playing. The game went to extra-time and Byrne, despite the pain, kept making his familiar marauding runs down the left flank in joining the attack. Early on into the first period of extra time, he reached the by-line with the ball and pulled back a perfect cross for Roger Hunt to open the scoring. Leeds got back into the game and equalised through Billy Bremner but Liverpool were not to be denied as Ian St John headed home the winner late on during the second period securing Liverpool&#x27;s first ever FA Cup. Shankly spoke highly of Gerry in an interview after the final saying &quot;It was a performance of raw courage from the boy&quot;.

The aftermath of another high-profile match led to calls, again, for the Football Association to allow a substitute to be selected by each team in competitive matches. In FA Cup finals over the previous decade there had been a notable number of teams reduced to ten men or hampered considerably by hard challenges from opposition players. This included goalkeepers Bert Trautmann (in 1955) and Ray Wood (in 1957) suffering a broken neck and broken cheekbone respectively; while two wingers in successive years were stretchered off with broken legs (Roy Dwight in 1959 and Dave Whelan in 1960) and a full back left hobbling for three-quarters of the game with a damaged ankle (Len Chalmers in 1961). Byrne&#x27;s injury was the latest to try to force the FA&#x27;s hand and, eventually, two years later the first substitutes were allowed in the FA Cup final.

===After the final and beyond===
The 1965–66 campaign was another triumphant one for Byrne and the Reds as he was an ever-present in Liverpool&#x27;s second title win in three years. Byrne, along with winger Ian Callaghan and Hunt, were rewarded for their superb club form by being selected in Alf Ramsey&#x27;s England squad for the 1966 World Cup finals to be held on home soil.

In the 1966 World Cup final only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the 4–2 win over West Germany received medals. Following a Football Association led campaign to persuade FIFA to award medals to all the winners&#x27; squad members, Byrne was presented with his medal by Gordon Brown at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009.

Byrne won two international caps for England. He made his international debut on 6 April 1963, in a British Home Championship match against Scotland at Wembley. The Scots won 2–1 in a game which saw fellow Liverpool teammate Jimmy Melia make his England debut. His second (and last) cap came in a friendly match preceding the 1966 World Cup. Jimmy Greaves scored four goals as England won 6–1 against Norway. Byrne stayed on at Anfield until 1969 when injury ended his career. He was replaced by Alec Lindsay.

==Later years==
He suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in later life and died in a nursing home in Wrexham on 28 November 2015 at the age of 77.

<text>The &#x27; (The Art of Love&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is an instructional elegy series in three books by the ancient Roman poet Ovid. It was written in 2 AD.

==Content==
Book one of was written to show a man how to find a woman. In book two, Ovid shows how to keep her. These two books contain sections which cover such topics as &#x27;not forgetting her birthday&#x27;, &#x27;letting her miss you - but not for long&#x27; and &#x27;not asking about her age&#x27;. The third book, written two years after the first books were published, gives women advice on how to win and keep the love of a man (&quot;I have just armed the Greeks against the Amazons; now, Penthesilea, it remains for me to arm thee against the Greeks...&quot;). Sample themes of this book include: &#x27;making up, but in private&#x27;, &#x27;being wary of false lovers&#x27; and &#x27;trying young and older lovers&#x27;. 

The standard situations of finding love are presented in an entertaining way. Ovid includes details from Greek mythology, everyday Roman life and general human experience. The is composed in elegiac couplets, rather than the dactylic hexameters, which are more usually associated with the didactic poem.

==Reception==

The work was such a popular success that the poet wrote a sequel, (Remedies for Love). At an early &quot;recitatio&quot;, however, S. Vivianus Rhesus, Roman governor of Thracia, is noted as having walked out in disgust.

The assumption that the &#x27;licentiousness&#x27; of the was responsible in part for Ovid&#x27;s relegation (banishment) by Augustus in 8 AD is dubious, and seems rather to reflect modern sensibilities than historical fact. For one thing, the work had been in circulation for eight years by the time of the relegation, and it postdates the Julian Marriage Laws by eighteen years. Secondly, it is hardly likely that Augustus, after forty years unchallenged in the purple, felt the poetry of Ovid to be a serious threat or even embarrassment to his social policies. Thirdly, Ovid&#x27;s own statement from his Black Sea exile that his relegation was because of &#x27;carmen et error&#x27; (&#x27;a song and a mistake&#x27;) is, for many reasons, hardly admissible.

It is more probable that Ovid was somehow caught up in factional politics connected with the succession: Agrippa Postumus, Augustus&#x27; adopted son, and Augustus&#x27; granddaughter, Vipsania Julilla, were both relegated at around the same time. This would also explain why Ovid was not reprieved when Augustus was succeeded by Agrippa&#x27;s rival Tiberius. It is likely, then, that the was used as an excuse for the relegation. This would be neither the first nor the last time a &#x27;crackdown on immorality&#x27; disguised an uncomfortable political secret.

==Legacy==
The created considerable interest at the time of its publication. On a lesser scale, Martial&#x27;s epigrams take a similar context of advising readers on love. Modern literature has been continually influenced by the , which has presented additional information on the relationship between Ovid&#x27;s poem and more current writings.

Pioneering feminist historian Emily James Putnam wrote that Medieval Europe, deaf to the humor that Ovid intended, took seriously the mock-analytical framework of as a cue for further academic exegesis:The tendency of the Middle Age toward the neat, the systematic, and the encyclopaedic, which made it so easy a prey to Aristotle, had the oddest results when directed toward the passion of love. Ovid&#x27;s &quot;jeu d&#x27;esprit&quot;, the , was playfully set in a framework of Alexandrian didacticism. It was mildly amusing in his day to assume that rules could be laid down, by the use of which any one could become &#x27;a master of the art of love,&#x27; to use the phrase of Diotima in Plato&#x27;s Symposium. This work was well known to clerks in its Latin form, and when love became a matter of general theoretical interest, it was rendered into French and became the textbook of the subject. Thanks to its method, love became a department of scholasticism, a matter of definition and rule. The was included in the syllabuses of mediaeval schools from the second half of the 11th century, and its influence on 12th and 13th centuries&#x27; European literature was so great that the German mediaevalist and palaeographer Ludwig Traube dubbed the entire age &#x27;aetas Ovidiana&#x27; (&#x27;the Ovidian epoch&#x27;).

As in the years immediately following its publication, the has historically been victim of moral outcry. All of Ovid&#x27;s works were burned by Savonarola in Florence, Italy in 1497; an English translation of the was seized by U.S. Customs in 1930. Despite the actions against the work, it continues to be studied in college courses on Latin literature.

It is possible that Edmond Rostand&#x27;s fictionalized portrayal of Cyrano de Bergerac makes an allusion to the : the theme of the erotic and seductive power of poetry is highly suggestive of Ovid&#x27;s poem, and Bergerac&#x27;s nose, a distinguishing feature invented by Rostand, calls to mind Ovid&#x27;s cognomen, Naso (from &quot;nasus&quot;, &#x27;large-nosed&#x27;).

<text>Prepaid telephone calls are a popular way of making telephone calls which allow the caller to control spending without making a commitment with the telephone company.

Prepaid phone cards are provided by various telecom companies. When you purchase a prepaid phone card, you are paying for long distance connection time in advance. When you make calls using the phone card, the card&#x27;s value is deducted based on connection fee, duration of connection, surcharges and any maintenance charges associated with the phone card.

Prepaid telephone calls are usually implemented in the company&#x27;s network using the intelligent network functionality. The competitive prices these operators offer are usually made possible by least cost routing and lower overheads than the larger telephone operators.

==Types of prepaid calling==

* Telephone prepaid calling cards (commonly known as Phone Cards in the US and the UK) are available from newsstands and drugstores. They are often the cheapest means of making long-distance or even international telephone calls. Moreover, they offer complete anonymity. Phone cards sold by retailers are live (active) when purchased by consumers.
* Web sites offer prepaid Personal identification numbers (PINs) for calling; thus there is no physical phone card. Prepaid online calling cards are more convenient to use, because most of the companies provide the option of registering the phone and avoiding using PINs at all. Rates vary from provider to provider, but the customer should be aware that cards with cheaper rates usually have hidden maintenance and/or connection fees.
* Prepaid calling operators offer services to customers who hold accounts with them and have paid money in advance. The service is typically accessed by the user dialling a toll free number from any telephone (PSTN, call box, mobile phone etc.). The user then authenticates himself with the operator by entering a PIN, types in the digits of the number to connect to, and then is connected by the operator. Often these operators have toll free numbers all over the world, so a customer can access the service even when he is abroad.
* Prepaid mobile phones are offered by most mobile phone operators around the world. Typically all the usual mobile phone services are available to prepaid users, except that they have to top up their balance in advance before they can be used. This is done via a variety of mechanisms - vouchers (commonly called &quot;power cards&quot;), swipe cards, debit and credit cards. An IVR is usually provided to allow the user to find out his current balance by dialling a short code. After the balance has been topped up, a user may make calls, send text messages and listen to voicemail in the usual way. For mobile prepaid typically use INAP or CAP protocol.

<text>Sir John Rutherford Alcock, KCB (25 May 18092 November 1897) was the first British diplomatic representative to live in Japan.

==Early life==
Alcock was born in St James&#x27;s, Middlesex, the son of the physician, Dr. Thomas Alcock, who practised at Ealing, near London, and his wife, Mary. As he grew up, Alcock followed his father into the medical profession. In 1836, he became a surgeon in the marine brigade which took part in the Carlist War in Spain, gaining distinction through his services. Alcock was made deputy inspector-general of hospitals. He retired from this service in 1837.

==Service in China==
In 1844, he was appointed consul at Fuzhou in China, where, after a short official stay at Amoy, he performed the functions, as he expressed it, &quot;of everything from a lord chancellor to a sheriff&#x27;s officer.&quot; Fuchow was one of the ports opened to trade by the Treaty of Nanking, and Alcock had to perform an entirely new role with regard to the Chinese authorities. He served there for 18 months, arriving in March 1845 (his wife followed shortly after, when appropriate accommodation was found, and his sister in law Emma S. Bacon, and mother in law, Mrs. Bacon, arrived one year later). He was able to work on restoring peace and order and in doing so, he earned a promotion to the consulate at Shanghai. 

Alcock, along with his wife, Henrietta, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law, moved to Shanghai in the fall of 1846, where they were part of a burgeoning community of expats, merchants and missionaries from England, France, and North America. Alcock made it a special part of his duties to superintend the established Chinese government and lay out the British settlement, which had developed into such an important feature of British commercial life in China. This included initially hosting a small church in his home, which his sister in law described as &quot;...an immense rambling Chinese House containing fifty two Rooms / surrounded by courtyards, and divided by Galleries and Passages in all directions&quot;. In April 1847 it was, however, decided to apply to the Church Missionary Society for a Clergyman and to plan and build a church on land donated by a merchant, and it appears that Rutherford was heavily involved in this initiative.

Emma S. Bacon, Alcock&#x27;s sister-in-law, wrote in April 1847, that the consulate was about two miles from Alcock&#x27;s house and was to be built on ground &quot;...by the River Side appropriated to the English...but as it is not yet commenced, it is uncertain when we shall inhabit it + but on the site appropriated for the Building Rutherford has at present Offices and a pretty sitting Room for our use, opening into a garden very nicely arranged...&quot;.

In 1853 Alcock&#x27;s wife, Henrietta died (March), and the Taiping rebellion reached Shanghai. The city was besieged and attacked until February 1855 when the rebels were starved and burned out of the city. Alcock remained in Shanghai until April of that year to restore peace and order, and then moved on to the Consulate in Canton, the original seat of much unrest in the 1840s. He was stationed in Canton for 1 year and then took a furlough to return home to England in October 1856, just before tensions once again ignited in Canton.

==Service in Japan (1858–64)==

In 1858, he was appointed Consul-General and Minister Plenipotentiary in Japan, and remained in that position until 1865. 
Alcock played an important political role in Japan in the 1850s and 1860s, alongside fellow Western diplomats Dirk de Graeff van Polsbroek, Townsend Harris, Max von Brandt and Gustave Duchesne, Prince de Bellecourt. Although these men were bound by personal friendship, national rivalries and differences in dealing with the Japanese led to conflict and antagonism. However, the chaotic and ungovernable circumstances of the first few years forced them to cooperate.

Alcock opened the second British legation in Japan within the grounds of Tōzen-ji in Takanawa, Edo (now Tokyo), the first being at Hiogo (Kobe), under Sir Harry Parkes and the vice-consul Frank Gerard Myberg (also known as Francis Gerard Mijburg and Frans Gerard Mijberg, died 18 January 1868 buried at Kobe). He saw
In those days, foreign residents in Japan faced some danger, with noticeable Japanese hostility to foreigners (&quot;sonnō jōi&quot;). In 1860, Alcock&#x27;s native interpreter was murdered at the gate of the legation, and in the following year the legation was stormed by a group of ronin from the fiefdom of Mito-han, whose attack was repulsed by Alcock and his staff.

In September 1860 he became the first non-Japanese to climb Mount Fuji.

From March 1862 to March 1864, Alcock was on leave in England.

==Service in China (1865–69)==
Shortly after these events he returned to England on leave in March 1862, and was replaced in Japan by Colonel Neale. Alcock had already been made a Companion of the Bath (CB) (1860). In 1862 he was made a Knight Commander of the same order (KCB), and in 1863 received an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Oxford University.

In 1864, he returned to Japan, and after a year&#x27;s further residence he was transferred to Peking, where he represented the British government until 1869, when he retired.

==Later years==

Although no longer in official life, he remained active. He was for some years president of the Royal Geographical Society, and he served on many commissions. The official Japanese section at the 1862 International Exhibition in London was prepared by Sir Rutherford and included his own collection. This is considered one of the most important events in the history of Japanese art in the West and a founding date for English Japonism in the decorative arts, the Anglo-Japanese style. From 1882-93 he was chairman of the British North Borneo Chartered Company.

He was twice married, first in May 1841 to Henrietta Mary Bacon (daughter of Charles Bacon), who died in 1853, and second (on 8 July 1862) to Lucy Lowder (née Windsor) widow of the Rev. John Lowder. Lucy died on 13 March 1899.

Alcock was the author of several works, and was one of the first to awaken in England an interest in Japanese art. He tried hard to learn the language and even wrote a textbook. His best-known book is &quot;The Capital of the Tycoon&quot; [= shogun], which appeared in 1863, whilst the Mikado&#x27;s Seat was at Kyoto. He died in London on 2 November 1897, and is buried adjacent to Sir Lewis Pelly in St Katharine&#x27;s Churchyard at Merstham in Surrey.

<doc id="1245035" wikidata="Q2037933" url="?curid=1245035" title="Havock-class destroyer">
<text>The &quot;Havock&quot; class was a class of torpedo boat destroyer (TBD) of the British Royal Navy. The two ships, and , built in London in 1893 by Yarrow &amp; Company, were the first TBDs to be completed for the Royal Navy, although the equivalent pair from J.I. Thornycroft, and , were ordered five days earlier.

==Background==
The invention of the self-propelled torpedo by Robert Whitehead and Austrian Navy Captain Giovanni Luppis in 1866, combined with the introduction of small fast torpedo boats, posed a threat to battleships: large numbers of torpedo boats could overwhelm a battleship&#x27;s defences and sink it, or distract the battleship and make it vulnerable to opposing capital ships. Torpedo boats proved devastatingly effective in the 1891 Chilean Civil War.

The defence against torpedo boats was clear: small warships accompanying the fleet which could screen and protect it from attack by torpedo boats. Several European navies developed vessels variously known as torpedo boat &quot;catchers&quot;, &quot;hunters&quot;, and &quot;destroyers&quot;; while the Royal Navy itself operated torpedo gunboats. However, the early designs lacked the range and speed to keep up with the fleet they were supposed to protect. In 1892, the Third Sea Lord, Rear Admiral Jackie Fisher, ordered the development of a new type of ships equipped with the then novel water-tube boilers and quick-firing small calibre guns.

==Orders==
Six ships to the specifications circulated by the Admiralty were ordered initially, comprising three different designs each produced by a different shipbuilder:
* and from Yarrows.
* and from John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company (the &quot;Daring&quot; class).
* and from Laird, Son &amp; Company (the ).

==Design==
&quot;Havock&quot; was built with conventional locomotive boilers (giving her two closely spaced funnels) while &quot;Hornet&quot; was provided with 8 water tube boilers (giving her 4 widely spaced funnels). In other respects they were largely identical.

All the boats featured a turtleback (i.e. rounded) forecastle, characteristic of early British TBDs. All six were removed from service and disposed of by the end of 1912, and thus were not affected by the Admiralty decision in 1913 to group all the surviving 27-knot and 30-knot destroyers, which had followed the six 26-knot vessels, into four heterogeneous classes, labelled &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;.

The design of the Russian Russian &quot;Sokol&quot;-class destroyers was strongly influenced by the &quot;Havock&quot;-class.

==Construction and trials==
&quot;Havock&quot; was launched first, on 12 August 1893. Her sea trials on 28 October 1893 were successful, her top speed indicating that she was capable of keeping up with battleships. However, her bow torpedo tube proved to be useless as the ship would usually outrun her own torpedo. It also tended to cause the bows to dig into the sea, resulting in a very wet turtleback. As such it (and later, the turtleback) was absent in later destroyers.

&quot;Havock&quot; &quot;behaved well&quot; on trials. It was noted that &quot;Hornet&quot; &quot;steers readily and well&quot; but her coal consumption trial revealed that she used considerably more fuel than her sister.

==Ships==
Four other boats based on the &quot;Havock&quot; class, the &quot;Corrientes&quot; Class torpedo boat destroyers, were built for the Argentine Navy:

==Royal Naval Service==
Both ships served in home waters, although &quot;Hornet&quot; was briefly in the Mediterranean in 1909. &quot;Havock&quot; had her locomotive boilers replaced with water-tube boilers in 1899–1900, altering her appearance to a more standard 3-funnel arrangement.

==Fate==
&quot;Havock&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; did not survive to see World War I, being broken up in 1912 and 1909 respectively. With the exception of &quot;ARA Santa Fe&quot; (sunk 1897), three Argentine Corrientes Class boats served until 1930.

<doc id="1245040" wikidata="Q174063" url="?curid=1245040" title="Agatharchus">
<text>Agatharchus or Agatharch () was a self-taught painter from Samos, who lived in the 5th century BC. His father was named Eudemos (Εὔδημος).
He is said by Vitruvius to have invented scenic painting, and to have painted a scene (&quot;scenam fecit&quot;) for a tragedy which Aeschylus exhibited. Hence some writers, such as Karl Woermann, have supposed that he introduced perspective and illusionism into painting.

However, as this appears to contradict Aristotle&#x27;s assertion that scenic painting was introduced by Sophocles, some scholars understand Vitruvius to mean merely that Agatharchus constructed a stage. But the context shows clearly that perspective painting must be meant, for Vitruvius goes on to say that Democritus and Anaxagoras, carrying out the principles laid down in a treatise written by Agatharchus, wrote on the same subject, showing how, in drawing, the lines ought to be made to correspond, according to a natural proportion, to the figure which would be traced out on an imaginary intervening plane by a pencil of rays proceeding from the eye, as a fixed point of sight, to the several points of the object viewed.

It was probably not till towards the end of Aeschylus&#x27;s career that scenic painting was introduced, and not till the time of Sophocles that it was generally made use of, which may account for what Aristotle says.

Agatharchus was therefore the first painter known to have used graphical perspective on a large scale, although rare occurrences of perspective do appear in vase painting around the middle of the 6th century BC. He is also said to have led the way for later painters, such as Apollodorus.

Agatharchus was a contemporary of Alcibiades and Zeuxis, and was often singled out for the ease and rapidity with which he finished his works. Plutarch and Andocides at greater length tell an anecdote of Alcibiades having inveigled Agatharchus to his house and kept him there for more than three months in strict durance, compelling him to paint it. The speech of Andocides above referred to seems to have been delivered after the destruction of Melos (416 BC) and before the expedition to Sicily (415 BC); so that from the above data the age of Agatharchus may be accurately fixed.

<doc id="1245045" wikidata="Q444975" url="?curid=1245045" title="Stan Collymore">
<text>Stanley Victor Collymore (born 22 January 1971) is an English football pundit, sport strategist, and former player who played as a striker from 1990 to 2001, most notably for Nottingham Forest and later Liverpool, who he joined from the former for an English transfer record of £8.5 million in 1995. He is currently senior football strategist at Southend United.

After his release from Wolves&#x27; academy, Collymore signed for non-league Stafford Rangers, where he caught the eye of First Division side Crystal Palace who signed him in January 1991. He failed to break into the first team and subsequently dropped down to the Second Division (renamed as the First Division in 1992) with Southend United, for whom his goalscoring record helped save from relegation and attract attention from Nottingham Forest, who he joined in the summer of 1993 for £2.25 million. Collymore enjoyed two prolific seasons at Forest, earning promotion to the Premier League in his first season and scoring 22 goals as Forest finished in third place during the 1994–95 season. Perennial title challengers Liverpool signed him in 1995, where he initially formed a successful partnership with Robbie Fowler, but was eventually ousted in favour of younger striker Michael Owen and sold on to boyhood club Aston Villa in 1997, where his form dipped and he struggled to break into the first team. After two unsuccessful years with Villa, he joined Leicester City in 2000 where he saw a brief career resurgence under Martin O&#x27;Neill, but struggled under his successor Peter Taylor and was sold to Bradford City in October 2000, but would leave the club after just 10 weeks due to his high wage bill. He then joined Real Oviedo of the Primera Liga, where he finished his career in March 2001 after just five weeks with the club.

While a talented and prolific goalscorer, Collymore&#x27;s career was often marred by controversy, including his public struggles with mental health, outbursts on the pitch and arguments with coaches and teammates. During 2021, he became involved with the management of former club Southend United.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Collymore was born at Groundslow Hospital, Tittensor, Staffordshire to a Barbadian father and English mother. He first took an interest in football as a child, and grew up supporting Aston Villa. He started playing soon after as a centre forward for Cannock Peelers and Penkridge Juniors, before starting his professional career as an apprentice with Walsall, and later Wolverhampton Wanderers, before being released and signing for then Conference team, Stafford Rangers.

===Crystal Palace (1991–92)===

While playing for Stafford Rangers, Collymore was spotted by a scout from First Division side Crystal Palace and signed with the club on 4 January 1991, when he was 19 years old. He made his first team debut for Palace on 23 April, coming on as a 76th minute substitute in a match against Liverpool. Collymore would remain with Palace for nearly two years, but struggled to find a place in the first team ahead of the prolific goalscoring partnership of Mark Bright and Ian Wright, and left the club in November 1992.

===Southend United (1992–93)===

Collymore joined First Division strugglers Southend United for £150,000 on 20 November 1992, as the club was stuck firmly in the second tier relegation battle with the likes of Birmingham, Oxford and Peterborough. Collymore would score 15 goals in 30 league appearances that season, with his goalscoring record and form helping Southend to claw their way out of the bottom three and finish the season in 18th, after being tipped by many to be relegated at the start of the season. Collymore later said &quot;I count helping to keep Southend in the First Division in my season there as one of my finest achievements.&quot;

=== Nottingham Forest (1993–1995) ===

==== First Division (1993–94) ====
Collymore&#x27;s work at Southend attracted attention from a number of different teams, including boyhood club Aston Villa of the Premiership and newly relegated Nottingham Forest. Frank Clark eventually signed him to the latter on 5 July 1993 for an initial fee of £2.25 million. Collymore&#x27;s prolific goalscoring form continued with Forest, as he scored 19 goals in 28 games and led the attack as Forest became a fixture in the top of the table and looked to win automatic promotion back to the Premiership. This was realised on 30 April 1994, when a last minute winner from Collymore saw Forest beat Peterborough United 3–2, securing a second place finish and automatic promotion to English football&#x27;s top flight.

==== Premiership (1994–95) ====
He made his first appearance for Forest in the Premiership on 22 August 1994, scoring a 26th minute equaliser in a 1–1 draw against Manchester United at City Ground. Collymore scored 22 goals as Forest remained a consistent challenger for a top 3 finish in 1994–95, and a thirteen game unbeaten run from February–May saw them finish third and earn a place in the next season&#x27;s UEFA Cup. Despite success on the field, Collymore became an unpopular figure among his teammates, to the point that they refused to celebrate with him when he scored a goal. Midway through the season, his impressive goalscoring record had attracted attention from Manchester United, who were looking to replace ageing striker Mark Hughes with a younger talent. Collymore spent almost the entirety of late 1994 linked with a move to Old Trafford, with himself and Newcastle United&#x27;s Andy Cole named as Sir Alex Ferguson&#x27;s most wanted targets. Eventually, Cole was signed by United for an English transfer record deal worth £7 million, while Collymore stayed at Forest for the remainder of the season; by the end of the campaign, however, he had received offers from Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle, with all three battling to earn his signature in the summer of 1995.

=== Liverpool (1995–1997) ===

==== 1995–96 ====
Roy Evans would sign the deal to bring Collymore to Liverpool on 3 July 1995 for £8.5 million, shattering the English transfer record set earlier in the year by Andy Cole&#x27;s move to Manchester United. Collymore was initially placed in a forward partnership with veteran Ian Rush, though Rush was soon replaced with the younger Robbie Fowler early in the season. The up front pairing of Collymore and Fowler proved to be successful, as they scored a combined 55 goals in 1995–96 and established Evans&#x27; Liverpool side as serious contenders for that year&#x27;s Premiership trophy. On 3 April 1996, with the title still very much up for grabs, Liverpool met league leaders Newcastle in a thrilling 4–3 win at Anfield, with Collymore scoring the winner in the second minute of stoppage time to severely weaken Newcastle&#x27;s grip on first place and eventually play a part in them falling to second as Manchester United would take the trophy on the final day. This was later voted as the best match of the decade by the Premier League in 2003. Along with a strong league finish, Collymore was part of the Liverpool side that reached the 1996 FA Cup Final, played against Manchester United on 11 May 1996. Though he started the game, Collymore failed to get on the scoresheet and was subbed off in the 74th minute for Ian Rush, in what went on to be Rush&#x27;s final appearance for the club. Collymore watched from the sidelines as Eric Cantona fired home the winning goal with five minutes left on the clock, consigning Liverpool to another year with no major silverware. It would be the closest that Collymore would come to winning a major trophy in his playing career.

==== 1996–97 ====

Expectations were high for Liverpool and the Collymore/Fowler partnership the following season after the promise they had showed in the previous campaign. Roy Evans&#x27; exciting young squad led the league for much of the first half of the season, but a series of poor performances in early 1997 saw them fall behind winners Manchester United and eventually finish 4th. Collymore was again a regular fixture in the attack and was a consistent goalscorer and creator, but became the subject of increasing media scrutiny throughout the season, as tabloids accused him and most of his teammates of being unprofessional, with the squad being dubbed the &quot;Spice Boys&quot; by newspapers in 1997. He eventually fell out of favour with Evans, and was gradually replaced with the up-and-coming Michael Owen towards the end of the season. As his starts for Liverpool became more sporadic, rumours of his departure from Anfield began to circulate prior to the summer.

=== Aston Villa (1997–2000) ===

==== 1997–98 ====
Rumours of his exit from Liverpool were confirmed on 16 May 1997 when Collymore was signed by boyhood club Aston Villa, then under Brian Little, for a club record £7 million. Collymore debuted for the Villans on 9 August 1997 in a 1–0 loss to Leicester City. He scored his first club goal on 27 August, in a 3–2 loss against Tottenham. On 4 October, he was sent off after getting into a fistfight with Bolton Wanderers&#x27; Andy Todd and subsequently handed a three match ban by the F.A. His debut season for Villa coincided with a major dip in form, as well as injury and disciplinary problems, as he managed just six goals all season and struggled to break into the starting lineup ahead of longtime main striker Dwight Yorke. During a match against Liverpool on 28 February 1998, Collymore accused former teammate Steve Harkness of racist abuse, an incident that was later picked up by the Professional Footballer&#x27;s Association (PFA), but went unresolved and was closed after both players met in private and agreed to move on without charges. Off the field, Collymore was involved in an incident on 9 June 1998 where he assaulted girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson in a Paris bar, which he later apologised for.

==== 1998–99 ====

The 1998–99 season saw Collymore score just once in 19 appearances, as his issues off the field came to a head. In a match against Liverpool on 20 November 1998, Collymore was given a yellow card for a 9th minute tackle on defender Steve Harkness that caused the latter to be carried off the pitch and suffer ligament damage; Collymore was later shown a second yellow and sent off for another rash challenge on Michael Owen. Given his history with Harkness, Collymore was accused of holding a grudge and purposely trying to injure his former teammate; he denied the allegations. Shortly after this, he began to publicly struggle with his mental health, and was diagnosed with clinical depression, stress and anxiety in January 1999. Following this, he announced he would seek counselling and checked himself into the Priory Group Hospital in Roehampton, where he stayed for several weeks. He returned to the Villa side later in the season, but after a 3–0 loss to Chelsea on 21 March 1999, manager John Gregory dropped him from the first team for the rest of the season. This would go on to be his last appearance for Aston Villa.

=== Fulham (1999) ===

After a summer move to Greek side Panathinaikos failed to materialise, Collymore was sent out on a three month loan to Fulham at the start of the 1999–2000 season, with an option for the club to sign him for £1 million at the end. While he failed to make a major impact and was not signed, he did score the winner in a 2–1 League Cup win over West Bromwich Albion on 12 October 1999.

=== Leicester (2000) ===

==== 1999–2000 ====
Collymore and Aston Villa mutually agreed to separate after he returned from his loan spell at Fulham, and he spent the rest of 1999 training with the youth team and looking for a new club. Ligue 1 outfit Montpellier HSC showed interest, but rescinded their offer after Collymore refused to play in a practice match before signing. Newly promoted Bradford City also tried and failed to sign him, put off by Villa&#x27;s £3 million asking price. He eventually joined Leicester City for free on a pay-as-you-play basis on 11 February 2000. Just days after signing for the club, he made front page news during a team break in Spain, when he set off a fire extinguisher during a night of drinking inside La Manga Club, which resulted in £700 of damage to the bar and the entire team being sent home. Collymore was fined £30,000 and ordered to undertake community work by boss Martin O&#x27;Neill for the incident; O&#x27;Neill also warned Collymore that he would terminate his contract if any more incidents like this would occur. After returning to England, his second appearance and home debut for the club saw him score a hat-trick in a 5–2 drubbing of Sunderland. He would score four times in six appearances in his debut campaign for the Foxes, a season that saw them reach the League Cup Final, where they defeated Tranmere Rovers 2–1, though Collymore, having turned out for Fulham earlier in the season, was cup-tied and unable to feature. Collymore was stretchered off the pitch during a game against Derby County on 2 April after just 17 minutes, having audibly screamed and collapsed in the middle of the pitch. Scans later revealed he had suffered a broken left leg after an awkward landing, and he missed the rest of the season.

==== 2000–01 ====

Having fully recovered, Collymore remained with Leicester through the summer transfer window and was thought to be the club&#x27;s new first choice striker after Emile Heskey had left for Liverpool in the summer; however, with Martin O&#x27;Neill having departed Leicester to manage Celtic, he was dropped by replacement manager Peter Taylor in favour of new signing Ade Akinbiyi and instead often brought on as a midfield substitute. He scored once more for the Foxes, in a 2–0 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 17 September 2000. On 24 September, during a 1–1 draw against Everton, Collymore was alleged to have &quot;stamped on, and later elbowed&quot; Paul Gascoigne. While referee Alan Wiley claimed he did not see the incident and Collymore was not punished during the game, he was later ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing by the FA on 28 November. Two days after the incident with Gascoigne, Collymore submitted a transfer request to Leicester. He would later retract this request, but manager Peter Taylor still placed him on the transfer list, citing Collymore&#x27;s poor fitness, lack of commitment and attitude problems. Having fallen out of favour with another manager, and demoted to the reserve squad, where he was involved in a half time altercation with teammate Trevor Benjamin, Collymore and Leicester would eventually agree to part ways, and he was allowed to leave on a free transfer in October 2000.

=== Bradford City (2000–2001) ===

Collymore was immediately signed by longtime admirers Bradford City on 26 October 2000, a move described as &quot;desperate&quot; by BBC Sport pundit Mark Lawrenson. He made his Bradford debut in a West Yorkshire derby against Leeds United at Valley Parade on 29 October, scoring a memorable overhead kick in a 1–1 draw, however, his controversial celebration in front of the away crowd caused uproar and led to two Leeds fans being restrained by stewards. Collymore subsequently faced additional charges from the F.A. for the incident. He was substituted at half-time in his second game as Bradford lost 4–3 to Newcastle United in the League Cup, and missed the following game at Charlton Athletic because of flu and a sore wisdom tooth. In Collymore&#x27;s absence, City lost 2–0, and manager Chris Hutchings was sacked two days later. Jim Jefferies soon took over as new City manager, and Collymore once again led the front line in Jefferies&#x27; first home game in charge against Coventry City, scoring Bradford&#x27;s first goal. On 28 November, he attended a disciplinary hearing for the incident with Paul Gascoigne while he was still at Leicester, and upon video review of the incident, he was handed a three match ban, which meant he would miss key games against Liverpool, Sunderland and Chelsea. After returning from his ban, Collymore, and other highly paid players Benito Carbone and Dan Petrescu were transfer-listed in January 2001 by chairman Geoffrey Richmond in a bid to reduce the club&#x27;s high wage bill. VFB Stuttgart and Celtic both made offers for Collymore, but he would eventually choose to sign with Spanish outfit Real Oviedo after just 8 games and 10 weeks with Bradford.

=== Real Oviedo (2001) ===

Collymore signed an 18 month contract with Primera Liga side Real Oviedo on 31 January 2001. He made his debut for Oviedo as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 defeat to Las Palmas on 4 February 2001. He was again brought on during the second half of his home debut a week later in a loss against Villarreal, but was dropped by coach Radomir Antić after the game and told to improve his fitness. He played just one more game for Oviedo, another loss against Celta Vigo on 3 March, before announcing his retirement on 7 March 2001 at the age of 30, just five weeks after he had joined Oviedo; he did not tell the club of his plans beforehand and they only found out through the Spanish tabloids. A statement issued through his spokesman said, &quot;Stan Collymore has decided, after discussions with his family and close friends, to give up playing professional football. He has just turned 30 and believes that the time is right to explore other career opportunities which are available to him.&quot; He was offered a chance to return to Southend United and was also approached by Boston United and Wolverhampton Wanderers, but never made a return to football, however, he applied but was turned down for the manager&#x27;s position at Bradford City following the dismissal of Jim Jefferies in December 2001. Before the end of the year, Oviedo had begun court proceedings against Collymore for breach of his contract, unsuccessfully suing him for £7 million.

==International career==
After an impressive debut season in the Premier League, Collymore was called up to Terry Venables&#x27; England squad for the Umbro Cup in June 1995. He made his début at Wembley Stadium against Japan, partnering Alan Shearer in a 2–1 win. He won his second cap as a 90th minute substitute against Brazil.

Collymore made his third and final appearance for England as a substitute in a 4–0 win over Moldova during qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

==Post-playing career==
Collymore contributed to his biography &quot;Stan: Tackling my demons&quot; with Oliver Holt. In 2005, he played the character Kevin Franks in the film &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot; alongside Sharon Stone.

On 20 October 2008, Collymore won more than £1.5 million in damages from his financial advisers, for the poor investment advice he had been given since retiring from professional football in 2001. The judge ruled that Collymore had been given advice that was in breach of statutory obligations.

Collymore worked as a football pundit and presenter on the Talksport radio station for eight years between 2008 and 2016. He also worked as a commentator for BT Sport, he was released from his contract in 2015 for criticising their lack of action regarding sectarian chanting during a game between Rangers and Raith Rovers. He writes a column for caughtoffside.com.

==Return to football with Southend United==

In April 2021, Collymore wrote to Southend United chairman Ron Martin offering to buy the club from him, and held talks concerning the potential appointment of a Collymore associate as the club&#x27;s CEO; in May, Tom Lawrence was appointed.

In October, Collymore, Martin, Lawrence and director Gary Lockett formed a panel to appoint a new club manager following the sacking of Phil Brown. Collymore offered further free support, as the club was described as &quot;a mess&quot; by the BBC, and Lawrence started negotiations with Collymore about a formal role with the club. Collymore was announced as the club&#x27;s senior football strategist on 4 November 2021.

==Personal life==

Collymore has talked openly about his mental health issues. He began to seek counselling after he was diagnosed with clinical depression, stress and anxiety in 1999 while playing for Aston Villa. He also stated in his autobiography that he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Since retiring, he has continued to struggle with depression, and uses his Twitter account to raise awareness of the condition.

He is a supporter of Republic, a campaign group that campaigns for an elected UK head of state. He supported the Labour Party before leaving them for the Scottish National Party in December 2015 after a notable minority of Labour MPs supported airstrikes in Syria.

=== Incidents ===
In early 1998, Collymore was accused of assault by the mother of his child, Michelle Green; she alleged he had punched her in the face and caused injury after an argument regarding their son on 22 December 1997. Collymore denied the accusations, and was found not guilty and cleared of any charges at a court hearing on 28 April 1998. Around the same time, he was in a relationship with television personality Ulrika Jonsson, which ended after he assaulted her in a Paris bar on 9 June 1998. He later apologised for the incident.

Collymore made front page news in February 2000 while playing for Leicester City, when, during a team break in Spain, he set off a fire extinguisher during a night of drinking inside La Manga Club which resulted in the entire team being sent home and banned from the resort. Collymore was fined £30,000 and ordered to undertake community work by boss Martin O&#x27;Neill for the incident. Later, in December 2000, while playing for Bradford City, Collymore suffered a broken nose after he was assaulted by two men in a Birmingham nightclub. He was subsequently cautioned by manager Jim Jefferies.

In 2004, Collymore was accused of taking part in dogging at Cannock Chase by an undercover &quot;News of the World&quot; reporter. He lost his job at BBC Radio 5 Live over the incident.

<text>The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) is a second level military decoration of the British Armed Forces. Created in 1993 and first awarded in 1995, it was instituted after a review of the British honours system to remove distinctions of rank in the awarding of gallantry decorations. The Victoria Cross is the only higher combat gallantry award presented by the United Kingdom.

==History==
The CGC was instituted in the aftermath of the 1993 review of the honours system. As part of the drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, the CGC replaced both the Distinguished Conduct Medal (Army) and the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (Naval and Air) as second level awards to other ranks and ratings. The CGC also replaced the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), in its role as an award to officers for gallantry. The DSO was retained as an award for outstanding leadership. The CGC now serves as the second level award for gallantry for all ranks across the whole armed forces. It was designed and sculpted by Michael Rizzello for the Royal Mint.

==Eligibility==
The CGC, which may be awarded posthumously, is awarded &quot;in recognition of an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy&quot;. All ranks of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, British Army, and Royal Air Force may be awarded the CGC in recognition of qualifying acts of gallantry. Bars are awarded to the CGC in recognition of the performance of further acts of gallantry meriting the award. When the ribbon bar alone is worn, a silver rosette on the ribbon indicates the award of a bar. Recipients are entitled to the postnominal letters CGC.

==Appearance==

The medal is in the shape of a cross pattée in silver. Arranged behind the cross, visible between the arms is a laurel wreath. On the obverse of the medal, the circular medallion in the centre depicts St Edward&#x27;s crown. The reverse is plain which allows room for the engraving of the rank, name, and unit of its recipient. The award date is also engraved on the reverse of the medal. The medal is suspended by a white ribbon with two narrow dark blue stripes at the edge and one centre stripe in crimson.

==Recipients==
To date, there have been about 60 awards of the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, including three posthumous and one unit award. No second award bars have been awarded.&lt;br&gt;
The following is a full list of recipients who have been Gazetted to date.

<doc id="1245058" wikidata="Q3246898" url="?curid=1245058" title="Hugh Cortazzi">
<text>Sir Arthur Henry Hugh Cortazzi, (2 May 1924 – 14 August 2018) was a British diplomat. He was also a distinguished international businessman, academic, author and prominent Japanologist. He was Ambassador from the United Kingdom to Japan (1980–84), President of the Asiatic Society of Japan (1982–1983) and Chairman of the Japan Society of London (1985–95).

==Early life==
Cortazzi was educated at Sedbergh School, St Andrews University and University of London. He served in the Royal Air Force from 1943 to 1947, serving in Britain and India, and later elsewhere in Asia. He began in the RAF as an Aircraftman 2nd Class and was assigned to a six-month course learning Japanese, taught at the School of Oriental and African Studies. After completion of the course, Cortazzi was sent to the headquarters of the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre in Delhi, India, just as the war was ending. He was assigned to Number 5 Mobile Section, and was then posted to Singapore as the personal interpreter of General Miles Dempsey, the commander of the 14th Army. In 1946, he conducted many interrogations and produced translations of wartime documents in Singapore. In June 1946, he was posted to the British Commonwealth Air Contingent of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force and was based in Iwakuni. There he considered that the tasks he was given to undertake were of little value. Cortazzi was granted a wartime commission in the rank of Pilot Officer in June 1945. He was promoted to Flying Officer in December 1945, and left the service in 1947, after which he joined the Foreign Office. In 1998 Cortazzi published his autobiography, &quot;Japan and Back, and Places Elsewhere&quot;.

==Diplomatic career==
After the War, the British Foreign Office posted Cortazzi to Singapore (1950–1951) and to Tokyo (1951–1954). After returning to Whitehall (1954–1958), he was posted to Bonn (1958–1960). Another stint in Tokyo (1961–1965) preceded his return to London (1965–1966). Another posting in Tokyo (1966–1970) was followed by a different kind of opportunity at the Royal College of Defence Studies (1971–1972), after which he was posted to Washington, D.C. (1972–1975).

In 1975, Cortazzi was appointed Deputy Under-Secretary of State. The next few years in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1975–1980) preceded his appointment as Her Majesty&#x27;s Ambassador to Japan in 1980. In 1980, Sir Hugh was elevated to the rank of Knight Commander the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George. He spent the next four years in Tokyo.

==Businessman==
Sir Hugh retired from public service after his years as British ambassador to Japan, but in private life, he has continued to work promoting better Anglo-Japanese relations. In addition to the books he has since written or edited, he has regularly carved out time to write reviews and a recurring column in the &quot;Japan Times&quot;.

In 2006, Sir Hugh&#x27;s translation of the Japanese Crown Prince Naruhito&#x27;s account of his time at Oxford was published as &quot;The Thames and I&quot;.

Sir Hugh diversified his experiences with time spent as a Director of Hill Samuel and Company, later Hill Samuel Bank (1984–1991). He has been a Director of Director: Foreign and Colonial Pacific Trust since 1984; a Director of GT Japan Investment Trust since 1984; and a Director of Thornton Pacific (formerly Pacific) Investment Trust since 1986. Since 1992 he has served as Senior Adviser to a number of Japanese multi-national businesses with significant interests in the United Kingdom—such as, NEC Corporation, Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank, Bank of Kyoto.

Sir Hugh was a member of the Economic and Social Research Council (1984–1989); a member of the Council and Court, University of Sussex (1985–1992); and Honorary Fellow of Robinson College, University of Cambridge, (1988).

He died on 14 August 2018 at the age of 94.

<text>Aerarium, from &quot;aes&quot; (&quot;bronze, money&quot;) + -&quot;ārium&quot; (&quot;place for&quot;), was the name given in Ancient Rome to the public treasury, and in a secondary sense to the public finances.

== &quot;Aerarium populi Romani&quot; ==
The main &quot;aerarium&quot;, that of the Roman people, was the &quot;aerarium Saturni&quot; located below the Temple of Saturn at the foot of the Capitoline hill. The Roman state stored here financial and non-financial state documents – including Roman laws and &quot;senatus consulta&quot; – along with the public treasury. Laws did not become valid until they were deposited there. It also held the standards of the Roman legions; during the Roman Republic, the urban quaestors managed it under the supervision and control of the Senate. By the classical republican period, the Senate had exclusive authority to disburse funds from it.

Caesar replaced quaestorian administration with the administration of two aediles. In 28 BC, Augustus transferred the &quot;aerarium&quot; to two &quot;praefecti aerarii&quot;, chosen annually by the Senate from ex-praetors. In AD 23, these were replaced by two praetors (&quot;praetores aerarii&quot; or &quot;ad aerarium&quot;), selected by lot during their term of office. Claudius in 44 restored the quaestors, but had them nominated by the emperor for three years. In 56, Nero substituted two ex-praetors selected under the same conditions.

By the time of the late republic, the provincial governors had their own provincial treasuries, called a (initially referring to a &quot;money bag&quot;). Over time, the governors&#x27; exchequers merged with that of the emperor into an imperial fiscus. However, after a time, as the power of the emperors further increased, this distinction between senatorially-administered and provincial treasuries became irrelevant. Revenues from the Senatorial provinces increasingly became transferred from the to the through the early Principate. By the reign of Honorius and the Theodosian code, any vestigial distinctions had fallen away.

The extent to which records were centralised in the &quot;aerarium&quot; may be exaggerated. The various reforms done at previous times may imply negligent management, falsification, or loss of records. Even in the Republican period, Cicero lamented the extent to which the public records were managed and in later periods, the extent to which the public records were really used for reference is controversial: scholars, eg Mommsen, have argued that the sources of law in the later empire were not based on state records but rather those of private individuals, law schools, and provincial administrators.

== &quot;Aerarium sanctius&quot; ==
In addition to the common treasury, supported by the general taxes and charged with the ordinary expenditure, there was a special reserve fund, also in the Temple of Saturn, the &quot;aerarium sanctum&quot; (or &quot;sanctius&quot;). This fund probably originally consisted of the spoils of war. Afterwards it was maintained chiefly by a five per cent tax on the value of all manumitted slaves. This fund was not to be touched except in cases of extreme necessity. This continued until 49 BC when Julius Caesar, after seizing the city of Rome during the civil war looted this special fund.

== &quot;Aerarium militare&quot; ==
Besides creating the &quot;fiscus&quot;, Augustus also established in AD 6 a military treasury &quot;(aerarium militare)&quot; as a fund for veterans&#x27; retirement benefits. It was first endowed by 170 million sesterces of the emperor&#x27;s own funds, supported by new taxes, a five per cent inheritance tax and a one per cent sales tax on auctions. Its administration was in the hands of three &quot;praefecti aerarii militaris&quot;. At first these were appointed by lot, but afterwards by the emperor, from ex-praetors, for three years.

== &quot;Tribuni aerarii&quot; ==
The &quot;tribuni aerarii&quot; (&quot;tribunes of the treasury&quot;) have been the subject of much discussion. They are supposed by some to be identical with the &quot;curatores tribuum&quot;, and to have been the officials who, under the Servian organization, levied the war-tax (tributum) in the tribes and the poll-tax on the &quot;aerarii&quot;. They also acted as paymasters of the equites and of the soldiers on service in each tribe. By the lex Aurelia (70 BC) the list of judices was composed, in addition to senators and equites, of tribuni aerarii. Whether these were the successors of the above, or a new order closely connected with the equites, or even the same as the latter, is uncertain.

According to Theodor Mommsen, they were persons who possessed the equestrian census, but no public horse. They were removed from the list of judices by Julius Caesar, but replaced by Augustus. According to Madvig, the original tribuni aerarii were not officials at all, but private individuals of considerable means, quite distinct from the curatores tribuum, who undertook certain financial work connected with their own tribes. Then, as in the case of the equites, the term was subsequently extended to include all those who possessed the property qualification that would have entitled them to serve as tribuni aerarii.

==Publicum==

Prior to the decemvirate in 451 BC, there was a separate institution known as the &quot;publicum&quot;.

On a number of occasions it is recorded that various patricians incurred the anger of the plebs by paying the spoils from war into the publicum rather than the aerarium, for example Quintus Fabius Vibulanus in 485 BC following a victory over the Volsci and Aequi. From this it has been argued that the publicum was a fund administered by the patricians, but this has been disputed by others.

<text>Edwin Charles Tubb (15 October 1919 – 10 September 2010) was a British writer of science fiction, fantasy and western novels. The author of over 140 novels and 230 short stories and novellas, Tubb is best known for The Dumarest Saga (US collective title: &quot;Dumarest of Terra&quot;), an epic science-fiction saga set in the far future. Michael Moorcock wrote, &quot;His reputation for fast-moving and colourful SF writing is unmatched by anyone in Britain.&quot;

Much of Tubb&#x27;s work was written under pseudonyms including Gregory Kern, Carl Maddox, Alan Guthrie, Eric Storm and George Holt. He used 58 pen names over five decades of writing, although some of these were publishers&#x27; house names also used by other writers: Volsted Gridban (along with John Russell Fearn), Gill Hunt (with John Brunner and Dennis Hughes), King Lang (with George Hay and John W Jennison), Roy Sheldon (with H. J. Campbell) and Brian Shaw. Tubb&#x27;s Charles Grey alias was solely his own and acquired a big following in the early 1950s.

==Life==
Tubb was born in London and resided there until his death in 2010. He married Iris Kathleen Smith in 1944 and is survived by their two daughters, Jennifer and Linda, three grandsons, John Barham, Alan Barham and Steven, and two granddaughters, Lisa Elcomb and Julie Hickmott.

==Career==
An avid reader of pulp science-fiction and fantasy in his youth, in 1938 Tubb made contact with other British fans and made his first attempts at writing in the genre. &quot;My first attempts were written for my own pleasure,&quot; he later told &quot;New Worlds&quot;, &quot;and they are now perfect examples of what not to do&quot;. Tubb found that he had a particular talent as a writer of stories in that genre when his short story &quot;No Short Cuts&quot; was published in &quot;New Worlds&quot; magazine in 1951. Previously a salesman of printing machinery, he opted for a full-time career as a writer and soon became renowned for the speed and diversity of his output.

Tubb wrote for many of the science fiction magazines of the 1950s including &quot;Futuristic Science Stories&quot;, &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Nebula&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;. He contributed heavily to &quot;Authentic Science Fiction&quot;, editing the magazine for nearly two years from February 1956 until it folded in October 1957. During this time he found it so difficult to find good writers to contribute to the magazine that he often wrote most of the stories himself under a variety of pseudonyms.

His main work in the science fiction genre, the Dumarest series, appeared from 1967 to 1985, with two final volumes in 1997 and 2008. His second major series, the Cap Kennedy series, was written from 1973 to 1983.

Later in life Tubb updated many of his 1950s science fiction novels for 21st century readers.

Tubb was one of the co-founders of the British Science Fiction Association.

==Honors==
Tubb was Guest of Honour at Heicon, the 1970 World Science Fiction Convention, in Heidelberg, Germany. He was a five-time winner of the &quot;Nebula Science Fiction&quot; Magazine Literary Award (1953–1958) and the recipient of the 1955 Cytricon Literary Award for Best British SF Writer. His short story &quot;Lucifer!&quot; won the Europa Prize in 1972. In 2010, his novel &quot;The Possessed&quot; (2005, revised version of &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; [1959]) won the Premio Italia Award for Best International Novel.

==Works==

===The Dumarest saga===
Tubb&#x27;s best known series is The Dumarest Saga (US collective title: &quot;Dumarest of Terra&quot;), a far future epic science-fiction saga charting the adventures of traveler Earl Dumarest as he attempts to find his way back to his home planet, Earth, from a region of space so far distant that the existence of the planet is believed to be nothing more than a myth. Originally written in what Michael Moorcock has described as a &quot;conscious and acknowledged imitation&quot; of Leigh Brackett&#x27;s Eric John Stark stories, the series subsequently developed a style of storytelling unique to Tubb.

Published over a span of more than 40 years, the Dumarest Saga comprised 33 novels. The 33rd, which brings closure to Dumarest&#x27;s search for Earth, was published in 2008 by Homeworld Press of Chicago. A pair of Dumarest short stories, entitled &quot;Child of Earth&quot; and &quot;Figona&quot; and published in the science fiction anthologies &quot;Fantasy Adventures 1&quot; (2002) and &quot;Fantasy Adventures 2&quot; (2003), were extracts from this longer work.

===Cap Kennedy series===
Tubb&#x27;s other main novel series, &quot;Cap Kennedy&quot;, is space opera in the style of &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot;. Known as &quot;F.A.T.E.&quot; in the UK (where only the first six books have ever been published), the novels follow the adventures of Captain &#x27;Cap&#x27; Kennedy, a Free Acting Terran Envoy (F.A.T.E.) with licence to act as judge, jury, and executioner, and the power to intervene in any situation which threatens the peace of the Terran Sphere, an interplanetary federation centred on Earth.

Independently wealthy and operating from his personal spaceship, the &quot;Mordain&quot;, Kennedy is assisted on his missions by engineer Penza Saratov, veteran scientist Professor Jarl Luden, and alien navigator Veem Chemile, a humanoid chameleon who claims to be descended from the Zheltyana, an ancient race which dominated the galaxy in the distant past before vanishing without trace. The discovery of mysterious artifacts left behind by the Zheltyana on different worlds often provided the spring-board for the stories in the series.

Lester del Rey found that although the first volume managed to &quot;avoid the primitiveness and the formula&quot; that spoiled many similar series, the virtues of such series were also missing, leaving him unenthusiastic. He later noted improvement in a subsequent installment.

Tubb wrote 17 &quot;Cap Kennedy&quot; novels, all under the pseudonym Gregory Kern.

These books were the basis for the Commander Scott series from German publishers Bastei Lübbe. This series included all of the Cap Kennedy books by Tubb as well as a number of further novels, written under pseudonym by different German authors. Published in the format of &quot;romanheft&quot; (a digest-sized version of pulp magazines), the series lasted for 42 issues from 1975 to 1976. (See the entry under the German Wikipedia, Commander Scott.)

===&quot;Space: 1999&quot; series===
Tubb was the author of six novels based on Gerry Anderson&#x27;s 1975 science fiction television series &quot;&quot;. &quot;Breakaway&quot; (1975), &quot;Collision Course&quot; (1975) and &quot;Earthbound&quot; (2003) are novelizations of 11 scripts written for the series&#x27; first season format (including two that were subsequently filmed as second-season episodes), while &quot;Alien Seed&quot; (1976), &quot;Rogue Planet&quot; (1976) and &quot;Earthfall&quot; (1977, revised 2002) are original novels set within the first season continuity. The latter rejected the format changes of the TV series&#x27; second season to provide a satisfactory conclusion to the &quot;Space 1999&quot; story.

Tubb&#x27;s short story &quot;Random Sample&quot; from &quot;New Writings in SF 29&quot; (1976) was revised to become &quot;Dead End&quot;, a short story in the &quot;Space: 1999&quot; anthology &quot;Shepherd Moon&quot; (2010). The original story&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus&quot; starship crew are replaced by the Moonbase Alpha characters in the &quot;Space: 1999&quot; version. &quot;Random Sample&quot; was itself a revised version of a much earlier Tubb short, &quot;Entrance Exam&quot;, originally published in &quot;New Worlds&quot; magazine (1951).

===Other science fiction===
Tubb&#x27;s best known standalone novel is &quot;The Space-Born&quot; (1956), which started life as a serial for &quot;New Worlds Science Fiction&quot; magazine entitled &quot;Star Ship&quot;. An acknowledged masterpiece of the &quot;generational starship&quot; story, the book tells of a society who are the sixteenth generation of the original crew of a vast starship on a 300-year journey to Pollux from Earth. The plot centres on a protagonist whose job is to eliminate anyone who has become a burden to the society, through ill health, mental instability, or anyone over 40.

Other notable standalone novels include &quot;Alien Dust&quot; (1955), which charts the first 35 years of an Earth colony on Mars, and &quot;Moon Base&quot; (1964), a science fiction detective thriller set on a British Moonbase where a biochemical computer is under development. The short story collections &quot;Ten From Tomorrow&quot; (1966), &quot;A Scatter of Stardust&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Best Science Fiction of E.C. Tubb&quot; (2003) contain the best of Tubb&#x27;s short form writing, including &quot;The Last Day of Summer&quot; (1955), &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot; (1955), &quot;Vigil&quot; (1956), &quot;The Bells of Acheron&quot; (1957), &quot;Fresh Guy&quot; (1958), &quot;The Ming Vase&quot; (1963), &quot;J is for Jeanne&quot; (1965), and &quot;Evane&quot; (1973).

===Other genres===
Outside the field of science fiction, Tubb wrote 11 western novels, a detective novel and a Foreign Legion novel for Badger Books. Once again, many of these were published under a variety of pseudonyms, including the house name Chuck Adams, which were also used by other authors. In the 1970s he wrote a trilogy of historical novels set in Ancient Rome under the pseudonym Edward Thomson.

===Dramatisations===
Tubb&#x27;s 1955 novel &quot;The Space-Born&quot; was dramatised for French television in 1962 as a 90-minute play for Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française. The production was directed by Alain Boudet from a script by Michael Subrela and broadcast on 11 December 1962.

The short story &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot;, originally published in &quot;New Worlds&quot; magazine (1955), was dramatised as a segment of &quot;Night Gallery&quot; in 1972. Adapted by Stanford Whitmore and directed by Timothy Galfras, with a cast featuring William Windom and Ed Nelson, the segment originally aired on 1 March 1972, paired with &quot;The Caterpillar&quot; in the penultimate episode of the series&#x27; second season.

Tubb&#x27;s award-winning short story &quot;Lucifer!&quot; (later published in a slightly revised version under the title &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;) was adapted for the 2023 film, &quot;57 Seconds&quot; starring Morgan Freeman and Josh Hutcherson. The title &quot;57 Seconds&quot; refers to the amount of time that the ring possessed by the main character sets back time.

<text>Lionel Anthony Morgan (born 17 February 1983) is an English former footballer who played as a winger for Wimbledon before injury forced him to retire from the game at the age of just 21. He made an appearance for England under-19s in a televised game in which he received the man of the match award, and was compared by studio analysts to a young John Barnes.

==Playing career==
Morgan was born in the London Borough of Enfield and grew up in Tottenham. As a youngster he played for Broadwater United F.C., a community club on the Broadwater Farm Estate. He joined Wimbledon&#x27;s youth system at the age of 10, and went on to represent England at under-16 level. He scored a goal on his full debut for Wimbledon&#x27;s reserve team aged only 16, and impressed on his next appearance.

His first-team debut came on 26 August 2000 in a goalless draw against Watford; the 17-year-old set up a chance from which John Hartson headed against the goalkeeper. He played three more first-team games before breaking his ankle in an under-19 game. He played twice more for the first team at the end of the 2000–01 Football League season, then surgery to knee cartilage damaged in a pre-season friendly caused him to miss the first two months of the 2001–02 season. He made an impressive return to the reserves, and in November 2001 played for England under-19s in a European Championship qualifier against their Georgian counterparts. The match, a 4–1 win, was televised, and Morgan was named by Sky Sports&#x27; Nigel Spackman as man of the match.

He returned to first-team action as a substitute at the end of January 2002. In February, Tottenham Hotspur made an offer of £750,000 for Morgan&#x27;s services. Manager Terry Burton was unwilling to sell, but the club&#x27;s reported £20,000-a-day losses prompted chairman Charles Koppel to consider the offer. Koppel was later insistent that Morgan would only leave &quot;at the right price&quot; and the player confirmed he was happy at the club. Meanwhile, Morgan scored for England under-19s in a friendly against Germany, and speculation in the press was that Wimbledon would not reach the play-offs unless Morgan was part of the starting eleven. In March he scored his first senior goal, the only goal of the game against Rotherham United, from a free kick described by assistant manager Stuart Murdoch as &quot;Beckham-esque&quot;. A few days later he damaged his cruciate ligament against Crewe Alexandra, an injury which required two operations and kept him out of first-team action for seven months.

After scoring in his first league start of the season, he received a call-up to represent England under-20s, and played the whole of a 2–0 defeat to Switzerland. In his third game back in first-team action after a knee cartilage operation in January 2003, he was forced out of the game with a bruised and lacerated ankle resulting from a foul tackle by Portsmouth&#x27;s Tim Sherwood; manager Murdoch accused the player of singling Morgan out for rough treatment. In April he underwent further surgery on his knee cartilage.

In June 2003, Wimbledon F.C. went into administration; Morgan&#x27;s proposed transfer to Tottenham, for a fee of £400,000, fell through when he failed the medical, although it was reported that the deal could proceed once the player proved his fitness. His next first-team comeback, in September, lasted just three games before a training-ground knock aggravated the knee problem and two more operations ensued, though the prognosis was hopeful. However, the player&#x27;s contract was due to expire at the end of the 2003–04 season, and the club chose not to renew it. Manager Murdoch said Morgan was attempting to regain fitness in time for pre-season training so that he could find another club, but he did not play professionally again.

==After playing==
Morgan was for a time reserve team manager of Wingate &amp; Finchley, and had a brief involvement with managing the first team in the Isthmian League. In 2008, Morgan was coaching at the Broadwater United football project alongside former teammate Jude Stirling, son of the programme&#x27;s founder Clasford Stirling. Morgan and former teammate Jobi McAnuff formed a management company, Infinite Sports Management, in 2011. The company was dissolved in 2017.

<text>Sir Charles Norton Edgcumbe Eliot (8 January 1862 – 16 March 1931) was a British diplomat, colonial administrator and botanist. He served as Commissioner of British East Africa in 1900–1904. He was British Ambassador to Japan in 1919–1925.

He was also known as a malacologist and marine biologist. He described a number of sea slug species, including &quot;Chelidonura varians&quot;.

==Career==
Eliot was born in the village of Sibford Gower near Banbury, Oxfordshire, England and educated at Cheltenham College and Balliol College, Oxford, where he took a double first in classical moderations and Greats, as well as winning the Craven, Ireland and Hertford scholarships. Remarkably, he also won the Boden Sanskrit Scholarship and the Houghton Syriac prize. He was a noteworthy linguist, with a full knowledge of 16 languages and conversant in 20 more.

Eliot served in diplomatic posts in Russia (1885), Morocco (1892), Turkey (1893), and Washington, D.C. (1899). He also served as British Commissioner in Samoa. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1898 Birthday Honours and was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the New Year honours list 1 January 1900.

===British East Africa===
In 1900, he was appointed commissioner of British East Africa, and on 1 January 1902 he was appointed Commissioner, Commander-in-Chief and Consul-General for the East Africa Protectorate, including the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, and also as British Agent and Consul-General for the island dominions of the Sultan. In December 1902 he hosted the British colonial secretary (Joseph Chamberlain) during his tour of the African colonies.

In April 1902, the first application for land in British East Africa was made by the East Africa Syndicate – a company in which financiers belonging to the British South Africa Company were interested – which sought a grant of  sq. m., and this was followed by other applications for considerable areas, a scheme being also propounded for a large Jewish settlement (which was rejected by the world Jewish community). During 1903 the arrival of hundreds of prospective settlers, chiefly from South Africa, led to the decision to entertain no more applications for large areas of land, especially as questions were raised concerning the preservation for the Maasai of their rights of pasturage. In the 24 October 1903 edition of the Natal Witness, Eliot wrote: &quot;There can be no doubt that the Maasai and many other tribes must go under. It is a prospect that I view with equanimity...I have no desire to protect Maasaidom...the sooner it disappears and it is unknown, except in books of anthropology, the better...&quot; In April 1903, Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the famous American scout and then a Director of the East African Syndicate, sent an expedition consisting of John Weston Brooke, John Charles Blick, Mr. Bittlebank, and Mr. Brown, to assess the mineral wealth of the region. The party, known as the &quot;Four B.&#x27;s&quot;, travelled from Nairobi via Mount Elgon northwards to the western shores of Lake Rudolph, experiencing plenty of privations from want of water, and of the danger from encounters with the Maasai.

In the carrying out of this policy of colonisation a dispute arose between Eliot and Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary. Lansdowne, believing himself bound by pledges given to the East Africa Syndicate, decided that they should be granted the lease of the they had applied for; but after consulting officials of the protectorate then in London, he refused Eliot permission to conclude leases for each to two applicants from South Africa. Eliot thereupon resigned his post, and in a public telegram to the prime minister, dated Mombasa, 21 June 1904, gave as his reason:- &quot;Lord Lansdowne ordered me to refuse grants of land to certain private persons while giving a monopoly of land on unduly advantageous terms to the East Africa Syndicate. I have refused to execute these instructions, which I consider unjust and impolitic.&quot; On the day Sir Charles sent this telegram, Sir Donald William Stewart, the chief commissioner of Ashanti (Ghana), was appointed his successor.

===University administration===
In 1905 Eliot was the first Vice-Chancellor of the newly created University of Sheffield until 1912 when he was appointed the first Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong; he served there until 1918 when he was recalled to the diplomatic service becoming high commissioner and consul-general in Siberia.

===Japan===
He was the British Ambassador to Japan in 1920–1926: though the position was not renewed, he stayed in Japan, studying the practice of Buddhism there. He regretted the 1921 decision to end the Anglo-Japanese alliance in 1923.

Taken ill with influenza, he decided to return to England but died on the journey on 16 March 1931 and was buried at sea in the Straits of Malacca. He never married.

<doc id="1245091" wikidata="Q1340672" url="?curid=1245091" title="Hakkapeliitta">
<text>Hakkapeliitta (Finnish ) is a historiographical term used for a Finnish light cavalryman in the service of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618 to 1648). is a 19th-century Finnish modification of a contemporary name given by foreigners in the Holy Roman Empire and variously spelled as Hackapelit, Hackapelite, Hackapell, Haccapelit, or Haccapelite. These terms were based on a Finnish battle cry (; ), commonly translated as 

The -style cavalry was first used during the Polish-Swedish Wars of the late 16th century. In the early 17th century the cavalry led by the Field Marshal Jacob De la Gardie participated in campaigns against Poland and Russia. The Hakkapeliitta cavalry men led by Field Marshal Gustaf Horn were vital to the Swedish victories in Germany during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

The Finnish military march Hakkapeliittain Marssi is named after hakkapeliittas.

==Tactics==
The Hakkapeliitta were well-trained Finnish light cavalrymen who excelled in skirmishing, raiding and reconnaissance, as well as in pitched battles. The greatest advantage these lightly armored horsemen had were the speed and ferocity of their charge. They were equipped like the typical harquebusier light cavalry of their era; armed with a broadsword and two wheellock pistols and protected by a buff coat and a pot helmet. A steel breastplate was often worn as well. They would attack at a full gallop, the troopers on the front rank firing their pistols at near-contact distance and the whole formation crashing through the enemy at sword point. The horses themselves were another weapon, as they were used to trample enemy infantrymen. The horses used by the Hakkapeliitta were the ancestors of the modern Finnhorse; they were strong and durable.

== Organization ==
The Swedish army then had three cavalry regiments from Finland:
*Nyland and Tavastehus County Cavalry Regiment ()
*Åbo and Björneborg County Cavalry Regiment ()
*Viborg and Nyslott County Cavalry Regiment ()

Their most famous commander was Torsten Stålhandske (surname meaning ), who was commissioned as a lieutenant-colonel with the Nyland and Tavastehus Cavalry Regiment in 1629 and led it for the first time in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The original provincial regiments () had been raised by splitting the old Grand regiments (); also &quot;Land regiments&quot; (), organized by Gustavus Adolphus at the end of the 1610s, forming 21 infantry and eight cavalry regiments as written in the Swedish constitution of 1634.

== Notable battles ==
The main battles in which the Hakkapeliitta took part during the Thirty Years&#x27; War were:

*Breitenfeld in 1631
*Lech in 1632
*Battle of Alte Veste in 1632
*Lützen in 1632
*Nördlingen in 1634
*Leipzig in 1642 (also known as the &quot;Second Battle of Breitenfeld&quot; or the &quot;First Battle of Leipzig&quot;)
*Jankau in 1645

200 Hakkapeliitta were also part of the army which King Karl X Gustav of Sweden led across the frozen Danish straits in the winter of 1658, which enabled him to conquer Skåneland from Denmark in the Treaty of Roskilde. Many Finnish soldiers served under the Swedish Empire. During the era of the Swedish Empire of the 17th century, the Finnish cavalry was constantly used in Germany, Bohemia, Poland, and Denmark. Parts of the cavalry were stationed in Estonia and Livonia.

==In popular culture==
* The Bearkillers, a protagonist faction in S.M. Stirling&#x27;s Emberverse series, uses the Hakkapeliitta battle cry.
* The module of the Advanced Squad Leader board game system, depicting the Finnish forces in World War II, is titled &quot;Hakkaa Päälle!&quot;
* Nokian Tyres and its predecessor firms have made a snow tire called Hakkapeliitta since 1936.
* Hakkapeliitta&#x27;s feature in Eric Flint&#x27;s &quot;1632&quot; novel series as one part of Gustav II Adolf&#x27;s armies.
* The song &quot;Rex Regi Rebellis&quot; by Finnish metal band Turisas describes the adventures of the Hakkapeliitta and includes the battle cry .
* The Hakkapeliitta is included in the video game Age of Empires III as a mercenary unit, under the name hackapell. When Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition released, the Hackapell mercenary was removed and replaced with a more generic &quot;Harquebusier&quot; unit. This is due to the introduction of a full Swedes civilization, who can field non-mercenary Hakkapelit from the Stable. While historically the Hakkapeliitta are light cavalry, until Patch 13.27885 of the &quot;Knights of the Mediterranean&quot; expansion, the game classifies them as Ranged Heavy Cavalry. Thereafter, Hakkapeliitta are correctly classified as Light Cavalry, albeit still primarily a ranged unit.
* In Civilization V, the Hakkapeliitta are a unique unit of the Swedish Empire under Gustavus Adolphus.
* Hakkapeliitta is the only unique unit of the Swedish Empire&#x27;s unit roster in the strategy game .
*In the Anime Jormungand, Sophia Valmer use this war cry before engaging in hand to hand combat situation with knives, in episode 12 of the first season.

<text>The Louis Vuitton Cup is the name of the Challenger Selection Series sailing competition from 1983, named after its sponsor, Louis Vuitton. The winner of the competition became the challenger to compete with the defender of the America&#x27;s Cup. The competition for the 2017 America&#x27;s Cup changed format and name to the &quot;Louis Vuitton Challenger’s Trophy&quot;. The following series, in 2021, was named the Prada Cup after its new sponsor. In 2024 the challenger selection series will again be named after Louis Vuitton. Five out of the nine winners of the Louis Vuitton Cup competitions subsequently won the America&#x27;s Cup itself.

==History==
In 1970, for the first time in America&#x27;s Cup history, multiple &quot;international&quot; challengers competed for the right to challenge the New York Yacht Club, the defender of the America&#x27;s Cup (the key word being &quot;international&quot;: in 1964, for example, two British challengers competed for the right to challenge the NYYC.)

For the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup match, the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, the &quot;Challenger of Record&quot;, contracted with New York Yacht Club member, Paul Madden, to create &quot;The Challenger&#x27;s Cup&quot;. Paul Madden then contracted with Louis Vuitton to be the first sponsor of this Cup series that led up to the main event. Louis Vuitton offered a trophy to the winner of the challenger selection series; the idea was Paul Madden&#x27;s, but is generally credited to Bruno Trouble, a French yachtsman. The initial Louis Vuitton Cup was contested off Newport, United States, with &quot;Australia II&quot; prevailing, thereby earning the right to meet the NYYC’s defending yacht &quot;Liberty&quot; in that year’s America’s Cup.

With the exception of the America&#x27;s Cup races in 1988 and 2010, the winner of the Louis Vuitton Cup has been awarded the right to challenge the current defender for the America&#x27;s Cup. During the 1992 and 1995 regattas Citizen Watch offered a trophy to the winner of the defender selection series (the Citizen Cup) as the defense’s counterpart to the Louis Vuitton cup.

Due to the large number of challengers in recent decades the Louis Vuitton Cup has had to eliminate challengers in two phases. A round-robin points accruing phase, and then a pair of semi-finals involving the top four, followed by a final between the top two. The semi-finals and finals are a best of nine races between two boats.

Between the 2004 and 2007 Cups, Louis Vuitton sponsored thirteen &quot;acts&quot; of competition, with the first three acts not awarding points toward rankings. Some challengers do not enter the competition by the start of the acts. Rules for the current races (2005–2007) stipulate that ranking points awarded for each act of competition will increase as they get closer to the final. For acts taking place in 2005, standard points were awarded, with 11 ranking points for a first-place finish, and points awarded decreasing based on placing. Acts in 2006 double the points, with 22 ranking points for first place, and the final act 13 which takes place in 2007 will award triple points, giving 33 points to the winner.

History shows that the Louis Vuitton Cup series enhances the chances of the challenger due to the intense racing against different opponents which improves the tactics and crew co-ordination of the winner. Differences in boat speed are becoming less and less, placing an even greater premium on reliability, superior tactics, and crewing. In the weeks leading up to the America&#x27;s Cup competition, the defender has to mainly practice using in-house racing which can never be as intense as real competition.

In July 2007, Louis Vuitton announced termination of all its sponsorship activities associated with the America&#x27;s Cup after 25 years of involvement, arguing the organisation of the America&#x27;s Cup was taken over by business under the rule of Ernesto Bertarelli, leader of Alinghi, winner in 2003. Louis Vuitton instead sponsored the Louis Vuitton Pacific Series and Louis Vuitton Trophy.

After Oracle Racing won the America&#x27;s Cup for the Golden Gate Yacht Club in the 2010 Deed-of-Gift race against Alinghi, Louis Vuitton again sponsored the challenger series for the 34th America&#x27;s Cup which was held in 2013 on the San Francisco Bay.

Louis Vuitton also sponsored the heats to the 2013 and 2017 America&#x27;s Cups; These &quot;world series&quot; were sailed in smaller 45 ft wingsail catamarans, the AC45. Participation was compulsory to take part in the Louis Vuitton Cup.

<doc id="1245096" wikidata="Q138850" url="?curid=1245096" title="Gershom Scholem">
<text>Gershom Scholem (; 5 December 1897 – 21 February 1982) was a German-born Israeli philosopher and historian. Widely regarded as the founder of modern academic study of the Kabbalah, Scholem was appointed the first professor of Jewish mysticism at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Scholem is acknowledged as the single most significant figure in the recovery, collection, annotation, and registration into rigorous Jewish scholarship of the canonical bibliography of mysticism and scriptural commentary that runs through its primordial phase in the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah,&quot; its inauguration in the &quot;Bahir,&quot; its exegesis in the &quot;Pardes&quot; and the &quot;Zohar&quot; to its cosmogonic, apocalyptic climax in Isaac Luria&#x27;s &quot;Ein Sof&quot; that is known collectively as Kabbalah.

== Scholem &amp; the Kabbalah ==
After generations of demoralization and assimilation in the European enlightenment, the disappointment of messianic hopes, the famine of 1916 in Palestine, and in the midst of the catastrophe of the Final Solution in Europe Scholem gathered and reassembled these sacred texts from many of the archives that had been disarranged, orphaned, confiscated under Nazi rule or otherwise washed up in Genizah in the middle east. Scholem cataloging the flood of fragments and disordered, decontextualized manuscripts into an annotated and relatively organized sequence of texts available to scholars and seekers within the reception of this tradition in his 1930 bibliography of the Kabbalah, expanding this bibliography in his later works until the end of his life. Many other Jewish scholars assisted in this process of recovery once it was underway, but it is broadly recognized that Scholem initiated this process of textual and archival recovery and rebirth.

As Scholem points out in his memoirs, the canon of sacred Jewish writings from the diaspora and the Middle Ages (re: &quot;Kabbalah&quot;) had fallen into such a state of disrepair and oblivion—fragmented and effaced by persecutions from without as well as contortions, conversions and schisms from within Judaism—that many of the &quot;finest writings...&quot; from the major currents of Jewish mysticism could only be found in long block quotations in antisemitic texts, where some &quot;nincompoop who had quoted and translated the most wonderful, the most profound things,&quot; had assembled them &quot;in order to decry them as blasphemies.&quot; (This was a strong, somewhat exaggerated statement for expressive effect that Scholem attributes to Ernst Bloch in his memoirs—but there he co-signs the sentiment and appropriates it as his own description of the state of affairs in other places.)

Due to Scholem&#x27;s efforts, and those of his students and colleagues, the confused and inscrutable condition of Kabbalistic bibliography and provenance would be significantly remedied after the end of the World Wars and the foundation of the modern state of Israel where Scholem worked as head librarian of the National Library in Jerusalem.

==Biography==

Gerhard (Gershom) Scholem was born in Berlin to Arthur Scholem and Betty Hirsch Scholem. His father was a printer. His older brother was the German Communist leader Werner Scholem. He studied Hebrew and Talmud with an Orthodox rabbi.

Scholem met Walter Benjamin in Munich in 1915, when the former was seventeen years old and the latter was twenty-three. They began a lifelong friendship that ended when Benjamin committed suicide in 1940 in the wake of Nazi persecution. Scholem dedicated his book &quot;Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism&quot; (&quot;Die jüdische Mystik in ihren Hauptströmungen&quot;), based on lectures 1938–1940, to Benjamin. In 1915 Scholem enrolled at the Frederick William University in Berlin (today, Humboldt University), where he studied mathematics, philosophy, and Hebrew. There he met Martin Buber, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Hayim Nahman Bialik, Ahad Ha&#x27;am, and Zalman Shazar.

In Berlin, Scholem befriended Leo Strauss and corresponded with him throughout his life. He studied mathematical logic at the University of Jena under Gottlob Frege. He was in Bern in 1918 with Benjamin when he met Elsa (Escha) Burchhard, who became his first wife. Scholem returned to Germany in 1919, where he received a degree in Semitic languages at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Together with Benjamin he established a fictitious school – the University of Muri.

Scholem wrote his doctoral thesis on the oldest known kabbalistic text, &quot;Sefer ha-Bahir&quot;. The following year it appeared in book form as &quot;Das Buch Bahir&quot;, having been published by his father&#x27;s publishing house.

Drawn to Zionism and influenced by Buber, he immigrated in 1923 to the British Mandate of Palestine. It may be considered notable that though Scholem&#x27;s allegiance to the Zionist cause (or the reclamation of Palestine by the Jewish diaspora) is incontrovertible, his relationship to the manifest ethics of Zionism was more ambiguous and critical than Buber&#x27;s.

After his emigration from Berlin to Palestine, Scholem became a librarian, heading the Department of Hebrew and Judaica at the National Library. In 1927 he revamped the Dewey Decimal System, making it appropriate for large Judaica collections. During the period that he was a librarian of ancient manuscripts at the library of Hebrew University, fragments of the newly discovered Dead Sea Scrolls and inventory from the Cairo Genizah--just to name a few notable exemplars--moved through the collections he was overseeing. Though he started teaching smaller seminars at an earlier date, Scholem was not appointed as a full professor at Hebrew University until Hitler rose to power. 

Scholem&#x27;s brother Werner was a member of the ultra-left &quot;Fischer-Maslow Group&quot; and the youngest ever member of the Reichstag, or Weimar Diet, representing the Communist Party of Germany. He was expelled from the party and later murdered by the Nazis during the Third Reich. Unlike his brother, Gershom was vehemently opposed to both Communism and Marxism. In 1936, he married his second wife, Fania Freud. Fania, who had been his student and could read Polish, was helpful in his later research, particularly in regard to Jacob Frank.

In 1946 Scholem was sent by the Hebrew University to search for Jewish books that had been plundered by the Nazis and help return them to their rightful owners. He spent much of the year in Germany and Central Europe as part of this project, known as &quot;Otzrot HaGolah&quot;.

Scholem died in Jerusalem, where he is buried next to his wife in the Sanhedria Cemetery. Jürgen Habermas delivered the eulogy. 

==Academic career==
Scholem became a lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He taught the Kabbalah and mysticism from a scientific point of view and became the first professor of Jewish mysticism at the university in 1933, working in this post until his retirement in 1965, when he became an emeritus professor. 
Scholem directly contrasted his historiographical approach on the study of Jewish mysticism with the approach of the 19th-century school of the &quot;Wissenschaft des Judentums&quot; (&quot;Science of Judaism&quot;), which sought to submit the study of Judaism to the discipline of subjects such as history, philology, and philosophy. According to Jeremy Adler, Scholem&#x27;s thinking was &quot;both recognizably Jewish and deeply German,&quot; and &quot;changed the course of twentieth-century European thought.&quot;

At the time Scholem entered his field of study, Jewish mysticism was acknowledged as Judaism&#x27;s weakest scholarly link by many of the scholars, publishers and cultural leaders of the Jewish community and gentile German scholars who sponsored Scholem&#x27;s early career, including Martin Buber, Salman Schocken, Franz Rosenzweig, Robert Eisler, , Moses Marx, Clemens Baumker, Fritz Hommel and Walter Benjamin.

Scholem told the story of his early research &quot;at the start of my path&quot; in 1922 when he went to Berlin to visit &quot;the only Jewish scholar who had engaged in the study of Kabbalah in the previous generation.&quot; Gesturing at the rabbi&#x27;s library of documents, manuscripts and autographs written by the authors of the Kabbalah, some of which had been inscribed in early modern or medieval centuries, Scholem remarked, &quot;How wonderful it is, Herr Professor, that you have read and learned all this!&quot; to which &quot;...the elderly gentleman replied: &#x27;What! And I &quot;also&quot; have to &quot;read&quot; all this nonsense?!&quot; (Though he does not mention the name of the Rabbi in his canonical account of this visit, Scholem explains elsewhere that this scholar—once the Rabbi of Poznań—was Phillip Bloch.)

The analysis of Judaism carried out by the &quot;Wissenschaft&quot; school was flawed in two ways, according to Scholem: It studied Judaism as a dead object rather than as a living organism; and it did not consider the proper &quot;foundations&quot; of Judaism, the non-rational force that, in Scholem&#x27;s view, made the religion a living thing.

In Scholem&#x27;s opinion, the mythical and mystical components were at least as important as the rational ones, and he thought that they, rather than the minutiae of Halakha, were the truly living core of Judaism. In particular, he disagreed with what he considered to be Martin Buber&#x27;s personalization of Kabbalistic concepts as well as what he argued was an inadequate approach to Jewish history, Hebrew language, and the land of Israel.

In the worldview of Scholem, the research of Jewish mysticism could not be separated from its historical context. Starting from something similar to the &quot;Gegengeschichte&quot; of Friedrich Nietzsche, he ended up including less normative aspects of Judaism in the public history.

Specifically, Scholem in his scholarly writing that Jewish history could be divided into three periods:

*During the Biblical period, monotheism battles mythology without completely defeating it.
*During the Talmudic period, some of the institutions—for example, the notion of the magical power of the accomplishment of the Sacraments—are removed in favour of the purer concept of the divine transcendence.
*During the medieval period, the impossibility of reconciling the abstract concept of God of ancient Greek philosophy with the personal God of the Bible, led Jewish thinkers, such as Maimonides, to try to eliminate the remaining myths and to modify the figure of the living God. After this time, mysticism, as an effort to find again the essence of the God of their fathers, became more widespread.

Elsewhere, in oral presentation or informal reflection, Scholem inflected the three periods within a different frame of reference: there was the primordial inscription and enunciation of the Law in the Torah and the Talmud, the mystical reflections of the Kabbalah, and the post-metaphysical phase of mystical writings represented by (for example) the writings of Franz Kafka or the critical mysticism of his friend and correspondent Walter Benjamin. Scholem often told his students that the modern reader must read Franz Kafka in order to enter into the frame of mind native to the Kabbalah, and elsewhere remarked that, &quot;among the peculiarities&quot; Benjamin&#x27;s writings was its &quot;enormous suitability for canonization; I might almost say for quotation as a kind of Holy Writ.&quot;

The notion of the three periods, with its interactions between rational and irrational elements in Judaism, led Scholem to put forward some controversial arguments. He thought that the 17th century messianic movement, known as Sabbateanism, was developed from the Lurianic Kabbalah. In order to neutralize Sabbateanism, Hasidism had emerged as a Hegelian synthesis. Many of those who joined the Hasidic movement, because they had seen in it an Orthodox congregation, considered it scandalous that their community should be associated with a heretical movement.

In the same way, Scholem produced the hypothesis that the source of the 13th century Kabbalah was a Jewish gnosticism that preceded Christian gnosticism.

The historiographical approach of Scholem also involved a linguistic theory. In contrast to Buber, Scholem believed in the power of the language to invoke supernatural phenomena. In contrast to Walter Benjamin, he put the Hebrew language in a privileged position with respect to other languages, as the only language capable of revealing the divine truth. His special regard for the spiritual potency of the Hebrew language was expressed in his 1926 letter to Franz Rosenzweig regarding his concerns over the &quot;secularization&quot; of Hebrew. Scholem considered the Kabbalists as interpreters of a pre-existent linguistic revelation.

== Friends, colleagues and canonical affinities ==
Scholem&#x27;s closest peers included, most famously, Walter Benjamin and Leo Strauss.

Though his relationship with Franz Rosenzweig was of shorter duration, it was also a deeply influential one. Likewise, though Scholem was never directly introduced to Franz Kafka, he found out later in life that Kafka approved of his comments in a debate. Scholem and Benjamin&#x27;s discussions of Kafka, spanning decades, played no small role in the elevation Kafka&#x27;s literary and epistolary writings to canonical status in both secular and mystical literature as writing that was prophetic or premonitory of the Holocaust while also having qualities of a kind of post-metaphysical kabbalah.

It is a measure of the depth of Scholem&#x27;s friendship with Benjamin that he wrote two memoirs at the end of his life: his own autobiography tends to be less read or frequently cited than his &quot;Autobiography of a Friendship&quot; recounting his lifelong relationship and work in partnership with Benjamin prior to the latter&#x27;s death in flight from the Gestapo in 1940. In addition to his Kabbalah scholarship, a significant portion of Scholem&#x27;s working life postwar was spent recovering, editing and promoting the literary estate of his dead friend.

Martin Buber was a patron, publisher and sponsor of the careers of both Scholem and his best friend Benjamin (despite Benjamin&#x27;s frequent ingratitude and incorrigible blowing of deadlines and Scholem&#x27;s occasionally scathing critiques of the elder figure).

Though Scholem&#x27;s relationships with Hannah Arendt, Theodor Adorno, Hans Jonas, and Ernst Bloch were more characteristically turbulent than those relationship just mentioned, the frequent citation of these figures in Scholem&#x27;s published writings and private correspondence demonstrates that they were among his closest and most influential colleagues. Selected letters from his correspondence with thinkers, critics and philosophers have been published.

Though appearing as a friend and protegé late in his career, Cynthia Ozick merits mention among those in Scholem&#x27;s inner-circle. His late-career relationships with Allen Ginsberg, Harold Bloom, and George Steiner were also significant (though his relationship with Steiner was, characteristically, somewhat combative). Scholem was also friendly with the author Shai Agnon and the Talmudic scholar Saul Lieberman.

As a major, unofficial but widely acknowledged figurehead of mystical, historical and theological currents within both Reform and (much more controversially) Conservative Judaism after World War II and the Destruction of the European Jewry in the Holocaust, Scholem&#x27;s stature within Jewish tradition is roughly comparable to the role played before the First World War and during the interwar period by Martin Buber.

==Debate with Hannah Arendt==
In the aftermath of the Adolf Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, Scholem sharply criticised Hannah Arendt&#x27;s book, &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; and decried her lack of solidarity with the Jewish people ( &quot;love of one&#x27;s fellow Jews&quot;, &quot;ʾahəvaṯ ʾiśrāʾēl&quot;). Arendt responded that she never loved any collective group, and that she does not love the Jewish people but was only part of them. The bitter fight, which was exchanged in various articles, led to a rift between Scholem and Arendt though they remained mutually respectful thereafter and continued to work alongside one another on various projects, particularly in their work on the literary estate of Walter Benjamin. In an apparently wrathful moment, Scholem wrote to Hans Paeschke that he &quot;knew Hannah Arendt when she was a socialist or half-communist and... when she was a Zionist. I am astounded by her ability to pronounce upon movements in which she was once so deeply engaged, in terms of a distance measured in light years and from such sovereign heights.&quot; Differing perspectives on the appropriate penalty for Adolph Eichmann further illuminate differences between the two authors. Whereas Arendt felt that Eichmann should be executed, Scholem was opposed, fearing that his execution would serve to alleviate the Germans&#x27; collective sense of guilt.

==Awards and recognition==
* In 1958, Scholem was awarded the Israel Prize in Jewish studies.
* In 1968, he was elected president of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities.
* In 1969, he received the Yakir Yerushalayim (Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem) award.
* In 1977, he was awarded the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought.

==Literary influence==

Various stories and essays of the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges were inspired or influenced by Scholem&#x27;s books. He has also influenced ideas of Umberto Eco, Jacques Derrida, Harold Bloom, Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, and George Steiner. American author Michael Chabon cites Scholem&#x27;s essay, &quot;The Idea of the Golem&quot;, as having assisted him in conceiving the Pulitzer-Prize winning book &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&quot;. The same essay influenced, and is cited by, Bruce Chatwin&#x27;s &quot;Utz&quot;. Chaim Potok&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Lights&quot; features a lightly disguised Scholem as &quot;Jacob Keter.&quot;

<text>Ernest Edward Thomas, MM (16 December 1884 – February 1939) was a cavalryman in the British Army and drummer. While serving with the 4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards he fired the first British shot of the First World War in Europe, at on 22 August 1914, in an engagement against German troops outside Mons.

==Early life==
Although it has been reported that Thomas was born in Nenagh, County Tipperary, it has now been established that he was born in London of Irish ancestry. Thomas joined the British Army as a drummer in the Royal Horse Artillery, but transferred to the 4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards before the outbreak of hostilities.

==First World War==
It was while serving as a corporal in the 4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards that Thomas is reported to have fired the first British shot of the First World War in Europe. He was promoted to sergeant on 5 November 1915 and transferred to the Machine Gun Corps in 1916. Thomas was also mentioned in despatches for bravery. While positioned in a slit trench he advanced on his opposite number after British shelling of the enemy lines, to find all the German soldiers killed. Noting the quality of the German boots, he removed them from several soldiers, tied them together and crawled back to his own lines, where he distributed them amongst his friends. Thomas was awarded the Military Medal during his service.

==Later life and death==
Thomas returned to the Royal Irish Dragoons at the end of hostilities and was discharged in 1923. He then became the Commissionaire at the Duke of Yorks Cinema. While at work in February 1939, Thomas became ill and subsequently died of pneumonia. He was buried with full military honours.

<text>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) is an American philanthropic organization. It is the largest one focused solely on health. Based in Princeton, New Jersey, the foundation focuses on access to health care, public health, health equity, leadership and training, and changing systems to address barriers to health. RWJF has been credited with helping to develop the 911 emergency system, reducing tobacco use among Americans, lowering rates of unwanted teenage pregnancies, and improving perceptions of hospice care.

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation supports the development of programs that can be used in community-led initiatives or by government bodies, funds research through surveys and polls, and makes impact investments. According to &quot;Pensions &amp; Investments&quot; and Foundation Center, the foundation was the fifth-largest in the U.S. in investment assets, as of 2015. As of 2020, the value of its endowment was $13 billion.

== History ==
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation was initially established as the Johnson-New Brunswick Foundation in December 1936, and focused on charitable efforts in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The original board of trustees included Robert Wood Johnson II, John Seward Johnson II, and others. It was renamed the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in 1952. Robert Wood Johnson II left a bequest of 10,204,377 shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson stock to the foundation upon his death in 1968. The foundation became a national philanthropy in 1972. The value of the stock was more than US$1 billion, making it the second-largest private foundation at the time.

=== 1972–1985 ===
Initially, the foundation worked on improving access to health care, with a focus on impoverished and minority groups, infant and elder care, and mental health. It created a $15 million grant program to contribute to the development of emergency services systems in the United States. Then-president David E. Rogers established a partnership with the National Academy of Sciences to increase oversight of how the funds were used and assess project outcomes. Ultimately, the funds were distributed to 44 grantees in amounts ranging from $350,000 to $400,000. The program funded primary aspects of emergency medical services, including: technology access, such as equipping ambulances with radios; training for ambulance drivers and dispatchers; interagency coordination through a national centralized, regional-based system; and development of the 911 emergency system. In 1973, 11 percent of areas covered by the foundation&#x27;s program had access to a centralized emergency services system. By 1977, when the program ended, coverage had increased to 95 percent.

In 1985, the foundation partnered with The Pew Charitable Trusts to launch a new program to improve access to health care for the American homeless population. The organizations committed $25 million over five years to 19 pilot programs as part of their Health Care for the Homeless initiative. Approaches to the issue varied by city. For example, a Philadelphia program connected hospitals with homeless shelters, so individuals experiencing homelessness had access to inpatient and outpatient care. Another program in New York City focused on providing care in soup kitchens. Congress followed the foundation&#x27;s program for providing health care through shelters by passing the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act.
Other early foundation efforts included: support for the Nurse-Family Partnership, which partners at-risk pregnant women with nurses; establishing the Minority Medical Faculty Development Program (renamed the Harold Amos Medical Faculty Development Program in 2004); and supporting development of the &quot;swing bed&quot; concept in rural hospitals, which allows patients to transition from acute care to skilled-nursing without having to transfer to a nursing home.

=== 1986–2001 ===

Beginning in 1986, the foundation focused on funding programs for the treatment HIV/AIDS, despite the stigma surrounding the disease. It launched the AIDS Health Services Program in 11 communities around the U.S., which aimed to integrate a network of human services agencies for case management and favored community-care models for patients. By May 1989, the foundation had given $50 million to care services and prevention campaigns. The Ryan White CARE Act was partially modeled on RWJF&#x27;s program.

After Steven A. Schroeder became the foundation&#x27;s president in 1990, he made substance abuse a major focus of the foundation&#x27;s work. Between 1991 and 2003, the foundation spent approximately $408 million on a variety of tobacco-related programs, including awareness campaigns on smoking cessation and the negative effects of tobacco use. The foundation launched Smokeless States in 1993, a program designed to educate local groups about the effects of tobacco and options for regulating tobacco usage. By 2007, 31 states and the District of Columbia had adopted the program. The foundation&#x27;s Center for Tobacco-Free Kids was asked to participate as a &quot;disinterested and trustworthy party&quot; in state litigation leading up to the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement of 1998.

Apart from substance abuse, the foundation also funded studies on palliative care and worked with researchers to develop the chronic care model. In 1989, the organization funded a five-year, $28 million study on palliative care, publishing the results in 1995. The Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatment found that most Americans die alone in hospitals while receiving high-cost care and treatment, often against the patient&#x27;s desires. The study led to the formation of several groups by the foundation, including Last Acts, 900 entities that have drafted best practices for palliative care. Between 1989 and 2007, the foundation gave more than $148 million for research related to palliative care. By 2007, more than 500 hospitals throughout the U.S. had palliative care programs, most of which were created after the foundation and George Soros&#x27;s Open Society Institute began research and advocacy efforts.

During this period, the foundation also contributed to efforts to enroll more uninsured U.S. children in medicare. A study published in Health Affairs noted that RWJF spent $55 million on its Covering Kids campaign, which lasted from 1997 until 2002. The study found that the overall rate of uninsured children in the U.S. decreased during the campaign.

=== 2002–2017 ===

In the early 2000s, under the leadership of Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, the foundation prioritized childhood obesity, and pledged of $1 billion for research and advocacy to raise awareness on the topic. Grants from this pledge, the first $500 million of which came in 2007, have been used to fund projects in cities throughout the United States. As early as 2003, the foundation was working in Louisville, Kentucky, providing more than $740,000 in grants between 2003 and 2011 to make infrastructure updates that encourage physical activity, such as widening sidewalks and adding the city&#x27;s first bicycle lane.

The foundation also continued to work on eldercare topics and provided funding for the Green House Project, a non-profit that offers a long-term care alternative to nursing homes. While nursing homes tended to be regimented, the Green House model allows residents to set their own schedules, and houses fewer people in more units designed like a single family home. In 2011, the foundation established a $100 million impact capital fund to develop the Green House model. By 2014, 27 states had adopted versions of the Green House Project. A 2017 study on Green House nursing homes funded by the foundation found that while imperfect, the model had better outcomes for residents, including fewer hospitalizations and a lower occurrence of conditions such as pressure ulcers.

In 2003, the foundation worked with the College Board to create the Young Epidemiology Scholars (YES) program to encourage high-school students to study in the area of public health; the program ran for 8 years. 

The foundation established the commission to Build a Healthier America in 2008. The non-partisan group included individuals from business, academia, and politics and focused on studying ways to improve health in the U.S. outside of the health care system. The commission compiled five years&#x27; worth of research into a report it released in 2014. The report focused on social determinants of health and detailed three strategies to improve health in the U.S.: early-childhood education; community-based health initiatives; and preventative care.

In 2010, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation partnered with the University of Wisconsin&#x27;s Population Health Institute to launch the County Health Ranking program, which calculates and compares the health of each county, nationwide. The counties are measured and ranked on various health and social factors, which include more than 30 indicators such as obesity, tobacco use, mental health, employment and poverty rates, and access to healthy food. Over time, the foundation added coaches and competitions to the program to support communities&#x27; efforts to improve local health. This was done in response to growing evidence showing that social factors and individuals&#x27; actions could affect a population&#x27;s health more than the quality of medical treatment. The foundation also partnered with Federal Reserve Banks to engage impact investors, banks, and community developers in health and wellness-based projects through the Healthy Communities Initiative.

In 2014, the foundation announced a major shift in its approach to health issues. It had previously focused on specific health issues, and would instead focus on changes that could lead to large-scale social shifts by building what it called a &quot;culture of health.&quot; The change built on the Culture of Health Action Framework adopted by the foundation in 2013. Critics of the shift expressed concern that funding for some areas—such as leadership training for doctors, and programs for nursing and health policy—was being discontinued as part of the shift. When describing the changes at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Lavizzo-Mourey said, “We have to make a seismic shift in the way we deal with health, and it has to come from the ground up.” 

A 2017 survey conducted by RWJF, NPR, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that people in America report that their personal experience with discrimination regularly affects their lives and drives decisions that influence their health, safety, and well-being. Experiences with discrimination correlated to an increased risk for health conditions such as coronary heart disease. In 2018, the foundation co-funded a study along with the National Institutes of Health that found police killings of unarmed black Americans led to adverse mental health affects among black American respondents. Other public opinion polls RWJF worked on with NPR and Harvard University have covered issues such as the burden of stress in America (2014), education and health in schools (2013), trust in public health (2021), income inequality (2020), and experiences during the pandemic (2021).

=== 2018–present ===

Under Richard Besser&#x27;s leadership, the foundation prioritized health equity and removing barriers to health resulting from discrimination. In an address given at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, Besser pointed to where people live, recreate, and work as well as access to healthy food and livable wages, and removal of cultural barriers as important factors in individual health. The foundation funded a 2021 analysis by the Urban Institute which found that black patients experience &quot;dangerous bleeding, infections and other serious problems related to surgical procedures&quot; more frequently than white patients who receive care in the same hospital.

In 2019, the foundation worked with the Global Reporting Initiative and others to develop the Culture of Health for Business Framework. The framework provides 16 best practices for companies to measure health policies and practices against, ranging from environmental to social and governance issues.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the foundation partnered with organizations such as NPR to research financial, educational, and health impacts of the pandemic. The foundation also has ongoing surveys with the Rand Corporation, one of which found that many Americans agree that minority communities have been more affected by the pandemic, but do not believe structural racism is a barrier to health.

The foundation&#x27;s other activities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic included collaborating with Boston University to develop a database of state policies enacted in response to the pandemic, and hosting teleconferences and virtual discussions on how the pandemic unveiled the impact that systemic racism and other forms of discrimination have on health in America.

During this period, RWJF partnered with the Ford Foundation to establish the Presidents&#x27; Council on Disability Inclusion in Philanthropy. The group includes 17 grant making organizations. The council&#x27;s focus is on improving inclusion of disability issues in philanthropy. The foundation also funded the Childhood Opportunity Index, which ranks neighborhoods across the U.S. on access to childhood development resources that can affect health and life expectancy, and income later in life. The index was initially published in 2014, and an updated version was released in January 2020.

==Leadership==
The foundation&#x27;s first president, David E. Rogers, served from 1972 until 1987.
Leighton E. Cluff served as the foundation&#x27;s president from 1986 until February 1990, when he was succeeded by Steven A. Schroeder. The foundation&#x27;s board of trustees selected Schroeder to lead the foundation, knowing he wanted to take it &quot;in the direction of working on substance abuse problems&quot;.

Risa Lavizzo-Mourey was the first woman and African American to be the foundation&#x27;s chief executive officer, a role she held between 2002 and 2017. She was succeeded by Richard E. Besser, who was named president and CEO in April 2017. Besser previously worked as the medical editor for ABC News and acting director of the Centers for Disease Control.

<text>John Wootton (c.1686– 13 November 1764) was an English painter of sporting subjects, battle scenes and landscapes, and illustrator.

==Life==
Born in Snitterfield, Warwickshire (near Stratford-upon-Avon), he is best remembered as a pioneer in the painting of sporting subjects – together with Peter Tillemans and James Seymour – and was considered the finest practitioner of the genre in his day. As such, his paintings were very fashionable and were sought after by those among the highest strata of the British society. These included figures such as George II of Great Britain, Frederick, Prince of Wales, and the Duke of Marlborough.

It is likely that he received artistic training from Jan Wyck before 1700. Wootton may have begun life as a page to the family of the Dukes of Beaufort. His earliest surviving dated work is the equine portrait &quot;Bonny Black&quot; (1711). He remained active until his death in 1764, based in the capital of English horse racing at Newmarket, and producing large numbers of portraits of horses and also conversation pieces with a hunting or riding setting. He acquired a classicising landscape style based on that of Gaspard Dughet, which he used in some pure landscape paintings, as well as views of country houses and equine subjects. This introduced an alternative to the various Dutch and Flemish artists who had previously set the prevailing landscape style in Britain, and through intermediary artists such as George Lambert, the first British painter to base a career on landscape subjects, was to greatly influence other British artists such as Gainsborough.

He is now somewhat eclipsed in the field of animal paintings by the later George Stubbs (1724–1806), who is considered technically superior. John Wootton died in London on 13 November 1764. Examples of his animal painting can be found in the Tate Gallery, London, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, the Yale Center for British Art, in the Elizabethan Great Hall at Longleat and in The Portland Collection at the Harley Gallery and Foundation.

<text>Argo is an international programme for researching the ocean. It uses profiling floats to observe temperature, salinity and currents. Recently it has observed bio-optical properties in the Earth&#x27;s oceans. It has been operating since the early 2000s. The real-time data it provides support climate and oceanographic research. A special research interest is to quantify the ocean heat content (OHC). The Argo fleet consists of almost 4000 drifting &quot;Argo floats&quot; (as profiling floats used by the Argo program are often called) deployed worldwide. Each float weighs 20–30 kg. In most cases probes drift at a depth of 1000 metres. Experts call this the parking depth. Every 10 days, by changing their buoyancy, they dive to a depth of 2000 metres and then move to the sea-surface. As they move they measure conductivity and temperature profiles as well as pressure. Scientists calculate salinity and density from these measurements. Seawater density is important in determining large-scale motions in the ocean.

Average current velocities at 1000 metres are directly measured by the distance and direction a float drifts while parked at that depth, which is determined by GPS or Argos system positions at the surface. The data is transmitted to shore via satellite, and is freely available to everyone, without restrictions.

The Argo program is named after the Greek mythical ship &quot;Argo&quot; to emphasize the complementary relationship of Argo with the Jason satellite altimeters. Both the standard Argo floats and the 4 satellites launched so far to monitor changing sea-level all operate on a 10-day duty cycle.

== International collaboration ==

The Argo program is a collaborative partnership of more than 30 nations from all continents (most shown on the graphic map in this article) that maintains a global array and provides a dataset anyone can use to explore the ocean environment. Argo is a component of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), and is coordinated by the Argo Steering Team, an international body of scientists and technical experts that meets once per year. The Argo data stream is managed by the Argo Data Management Team. Argo is also supported by the Group on Earth Observations, and has been endorsed since its beginnings by the World Climate Research Programme&#x27;s CLIVAR Project (Variability and predictability of the ocean-atmosphere system), and by the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE OceanView).

== History ==

A program called Argo was first proposed at OceanObs 1999 which was a conference organised by international agencies with the aim of creating a coordinated approach to ocean observations. The original Argo prospectus was created by a small group of scientists, chaired by Dean Roemmich, who described a program that would have a global array of about 3000 floats in place by sometime in 2007. The 3000-float array was achieved in November 2007 and was global. The Argo Steering Team met for the first time in 1999 in Maryland (USA) and outlined the principles of global data sharing. 

The Argo Steering Team made a 10-year report to OceanObs-2009 and received suggestions on how the array might be improved. These suggestions included enhancing the array at high latitudes, in marginal seas (such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean) and along the equator, improved observation of strong boundary currents (such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio), extension of observations into deep water and the addition of sensors for monitoring biological and chemical changes in the oceans. In November 2012 an Indian float in the Argo array gathered the one-millionth profile (twice the number collected by research vessels during all of the 20th century) an event that was reported in several press releases. As can be seen in the plot opposite, by early 2018 the Bio-Argo program is expanding rapidly.

== Float design and operation ==
The critical capability of an Argo float is its ability to rise and descend in the ocean on a programmed schedule. The floats do this by changing their effective density. The density of any object is given by its mass divided by its volume. The Argo float keeps its mass constant, but by altering its volume, it changes its density. To do this, mineral oil is forced out of the float&#x27;s pressure case and expands a rubber bladder at the bottom end of the float. As the bladder expands, the float becomes less dense than seawater and rises to the surface. Upon finishing its tasks at the surface, the float withdraws the oil and descends again.

A handful of companies and organizations manufacture profiling floats used in the Argo program. APEX floats, made by Teledyne Webb Research, are the most common element of the current array. SOLO and SOLO-II floats (the latter use a reciprocating pump for buoyancy changes, unlike screw-driven pistons in other floats) were developed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Other types include the NINJA float, made by the Tsurumi Seiki Co. of Japan, and the ARVOR, DEEP-ARVOR &amp; PROVOR floats developed by IFREMER in France, in industrial partnership with French Company nke instrumentation. Most floats use sensors made by Sea-Bird Scientific (https://www.seabird.com/)
, which also makes a profiling float called Navis. A typical Argo float is a cylinder just over 1 metre long and 14 cm across with a hemispherical cap. Thus it has a minimum volume of about 16,600 cubic centimetres (cm3). At Ocean Station Papa in the Gulf of Alaska the temperature and salinity at the surface might be about 6°C and 32.55 parts per thousand giving a density of sea-water of 1.0256 g/cm3. At a depth of 2000 metres (pressure of 2000 decibars) the temperature might be 2°C and the salinity 34.58 parts per thousand. Thus, including the effect of pressure (water is slightly compressible) the density of sea-water is about 1.0369 g/cm3. The change in density divided by the deep density is 0.0109.

The float has to match these densities if it is to reach 2000 metres depth and then rise to the surface. Since the density of the float is its mass divided by volume, it needs to change its volume by 0.0109 × 16,600 = 181 cm3 to drive that excursion; a small amount of that volume change is provided by the compressibility of the float itself, and excess buoyancy is required at the surface in order to keep the antenna above water. All Argo floats carry sensors to measure the temperature and salinity of the ocean as they vary with depth, but an increasing number of floats also carry other sensors, such as for measuring dissolved oxygen and ultimately other variables of biological and chemical interest such as chlorophyll, nutrients and pH. An extension to the Argo project called BioArgo is being developed and, when implemented, will add a biological and chemical component to this method of sampling the oceans.

The antenna for satellite data collection is mounted at the top of the float which extends clear of the sea surface after it completes its ascent. The ocean is saline, hence an electrical conductor, so that radio communications from under the sea surface are not possible. Early in the program Argo floats exclusively used slow mono-directional satellite communications but the majority of floats being deployed in mid-2013 use rapid bi-directional communications. The result of this is that Argo floats now transmit much more data than was previously possible and they spend only about 20 minutes on the sea surface rather than 8–12 hours, greatly reducing problems such as grounding and bio-fouling.

The average life span of Argo floats has increased greatly since the program began, first exceeding 4-year mean lifetime for floats deployed in 2005. Ongoing improvements should result in further extensions to 6 years and longer.

As of June 2014, new types of floats were being tested to collect measurements much deeper than can be reached by standard Argo floats. These &quot;Deep Argo&quot; floats are designed to reach depths of 4000 or 6000 metres, versus 2000 metres for standard floats. This will allow a much greater volume of the ocean to be sampled. Such measurements are important for developing a comprehensive understanding of the ocean, such as trends in heat content.

== Array design ==

The original plan advertised in the Argo prospectus called for a nearest-neighbour distance between floats, on average, of 3° latitude by 3° longitude. This allowed for higher resolution (in kilometres) at high latitudes, both north and south, and was considered necessary because of the decrease in the Rossby radius of deformation which governs the scale of oceanographic features, such as eddies. By 2007 this was largely achieved, but the target resolution has never yet been completely achieved in the deep southern ocean.

Efforts are being made to complete the original plan in all parts of the world oceans but this is difficult in the deep Southern Ocean as deployment opportunities occur only very rarely.

As mentioned in the history section, enhancements are now planned in the equatorial regions of the oceans, in boundary currents and in marginal seas. This requires that the total number of floats be increased from the original plan of 3000 floats to a 4000-float array.

One consequence of the use of profiling floats to sample the ocean is that seasonal bias can be removed. The diagram opposite shows the count of all float profiles acquired each month by Argo south of 30°S (upper curve) from the start of the program to November 2012 compared with the same diagram for all other data available. The lower curve shows a strong annual bias with four times as many profiles being collected in austral summer than in austral winter. For the upper (Argo) plot, there is no bias apparent.

== Data access ==

One of the critical features of the Argo model is that of global and unrestricted access to data in near real-time. When a float transmits a profile it is quickly converted to a format that can be inserted on the Global Telecommunications System (GTS). The GTS is operated by the World Meteorological Organisation, or WMO, specifically for the purpose of sharing data needed for weather forecasting. Thus all nations who are members of the WMO receive all Argo profiles within a few hours of the acquisition of the profile. Data are also made available through ftp and WWW access via two Argo Global Data Centres (or GDACs), one in France and one in the US.
About 90% of all profiles acquired are made available to global access within 24 hours, with the remaining profiles becoming available soon thereafter.

For a researcher to use data acquired via the GTS or from the Argo Global Data Centres (GDACs) does require programming skills. The GDACs supply multi-profile files that are a native file format for Ocean DataView. For any day there are files with names like 20121106_prof.nc that are called multi-profile files. This example is a file specific to 6 November 2012 and contains all profiles in a single NetCDF file for one ocean basin. The GDACs identify three ocean basins, Atlantic, Indian and Pacific. Thus three multi-profile files will carry every Argo profile acquired on that specific day.

A user who wants to explore Argo data but lacks programming skills might like to download the Argo Global Marine Atlas
 which is an easy-to-use utility that allows the creation of products based on Argo data such as the salinity section shown above, but also horizontal maps of ocean properties, time series at any location etc. This Atlas also carries an &quot;update&quot; button that allows data to be updated periodically. The Argo Global Marine Atlas is maintained at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California.
Argo data can also be displayed in Google Earth with a layer developed by the Argo Technical Coordinator.

== Data results ==

Argo is now the dominant source of information about the climatic state of the oceans and is being widely used in many publications as seen in the diagram opposite. Topics addressed include air-sea interaction, ocean currents, interannual variability, El Niño, mesoscale eddies, water mass properties and transformation. Argo is also now permitting direct computations of the global ocean heat content.

They determine that areas of the world with high surface salinity are getting saltier and areas of the world with relatively low surface salinity are getting fresher. This has been described as &#x27;the rich get richer and the poor get poorer&#x27;. Scientifically speaking, the distributions of salt are governed by the difference between precipitation and evaporation. Areas, such as the northern North Pacific Ocean, where precipitation dominates evaporation are fresher than average. The implication of their result is that the Earth is seeing an intensification of the global hydrological cycle. Argo data are also being used to drive computer models of the climate system leading to improvements in the ability of nations to forecast seasonal climate variations.

Argo data were critical in the drafting of Chapter 3 (Working Group 1) of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (released September 2013) and an appendix was added to that chapter to emphasize the profound change that had taken place in the quality and volume of ocean data since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and the resulting improvement in confidence in the description of surface salinity changes and upper-ocean heat content.

Argo data were used along with sea level change data from satellite altimetry in a new approach to analyzing global warming, reported in Eos in 2017. David Morrison reports that &quot;[b]oth of these data sets show clear signatures of heat deposition in the ocean, from the temperature changes in the top 2 km of water and from the expansion of the ocean water due to heating. These two measures are less noisy than land and atmospheric temperatures.&quot;

Argo and CERES data collected between 2005 and 2019 have been compared as independent measures of the global change in Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance. Both data sets showed similar behavior at annualized resolution, as well as a doubling of the linear trend in planet&#x27;s heating rate during that 14-year span.

<text>threedegrees or 3° (frequently referred to as Three Degrees) was a communication and P2P application produced by Microsoft. It allowed the user to sign in using a .NET Passport and integrated into MSN Messenger. It sorted buddies into groups, and allowed initiating group chats in MSN Messenger, and sharing of pictures, listening to a shared playlist and sending animated winks.

threedegrees is now discontinued and certain features provided by the software have been partially integrated into MSN Messenger 7. threedegrees used to only run under Windows XP Service Packs 1 and 2, with a custom IPv6 stack installed.

threedegrees had a concept of being able to stream music between multiple users like a miniature radio station. However, despite other new features being included in MSN Messenger 7, this feature was never released due to large copyright issues that would be faced by Microsoft. MSN Messenger does, however, now enable other users to see what their buddy is listening to and is linked to a website providing this music if needed, a concept spurred by this idea.

The threedegrees product was conceived and produced by an internal startup at Microsoft called the Netgen team. The team was unique in that it was an internal startup inside of Microsoft, set away from the software giant&#x27;s Redmond campus in separate offices in downtown Seattle and staffed mostly with college graduates tasked to create a product &quot;for themselves&quot;. The team was chronicled in &quot;Newsweek&quot; on February 24, 2003 by writer Steven Levy in his article &quot;Microsoft Gets A Clue From Its Kiddie Corps&quot;. While the threedegrees product never reached mass adoption, it represented one of Microsoft&#x27;s early attempts to revitalize its MSN division through the creation of an incubator team outside of the company&#x27;s main R&amp;D structure.

<doc id="1245143" wikidata="Q1463495" url="?curid=1245143" title="Sunny Garcia">
<text>Vincent Sennen &quot;Sunny&quot; Garcia (born January 14, 1970) is an American professional surfer from Waianae, Hawaii. After leaving school he debuted on the 1986 Gotcha Pro at Sandy Beach, Oahu, beating the 1984 champ Tom Carroll.

His top surfing achievement was becoming the ASP WCT World Champion in 2000. Garcia also holds the record for most WQS event wins (22 wins) and holds six Triple Crown of Surfing titles. In addition, he was the second professional surfer to win over $1 million in prize money.

He initially retired in 2005 but returned to competition. In 2008, his hopes for ASP World Tour qualification were dashed with early elimination in the O&#x27;Neill World Cup of Surfing.

He has served prison time for tax evasion and was arrested for fighting.

==Career==
Garcia was a dominant force in the Hawaiian Surfing Association starting as a 17-year-old on the 1986 WCT, beating former champion Tom Carroll and threatening to cause an upset to the top 16. Despite this early promise he just failed to break into this elite group in his debut season. The following year he finished in 16th position.

Garcia showed great consistency throughout the 1990s, finishing in the top ten every year and coming third four times. However, in 1995 it seemed that he might have reached the climax of his career. Failing to win the Pipeline Masters to claim the title, Sunny ended up finishing third behind Kelly Slater and Rob Machado. With a host of talented young blood set to qualify for the 1996 Dream Tour and declining fitness levels, it seemed Garcia&#x27;s era was over.

Then, four years later, inspired by veteran Mark Occhilupo&#x27;s shock 1999 WCT title, Garcia shed weight and moved to Kauai. There he surfed with the progressive Irons brothers, Andy and Bruce, expanding his surfing repertoire.

In 2000, 14 years after his debut, Garcia achieved the ultimate surfing accolade, emphatically dominating the ASP WCT from the start of the campaign, winning the first two events in Australia and clinching the title in Brazil, the penultimate event. On the way he also picked up a fifth Triple Crown in his native Hawaii.

After initially retiring from the professional surfing circuit in 2005, Garcia began competing on the WQS again. In 2008, he started slowly but moved into the top ten after a fifth-place finish in Scotland. Garcia was determined to win the series, and many people tipped him to do so but in the end early elimination in the O&#x27;Neill World Cup of Surfing, in his own backyard, meant he was denied a place on the 2009 Dream Tour.

In 2009 he had surgery on his knee and finished the year strongly, following a quarter-final berth in the Hawaiian pro with a runner-up spot to Triple Crown rival Joel Parkinson in the O&#x27;Neill World Cup. However, his attempt to clinch a seventh Triple Crown was denied when he lost his Pipemasters place after arriving late for his heat. Some consolation came from his standout performance at the &#x27;Quiksilver in memory of Eddie Aikau&#x27; big wave contest (&quot;The Eddie&quot;), in which he finished third.

As of June 2010, he was placed 67th in the new ASP World Rankings, his best result being a quarter-final finish on the &#x27;Sponsor me now Sunset Open&#x27; in January.

==Non-surfing work==
In 2002, he starred in &quot;North Shore: Boarding House&quot;, a reality TV show featuring surfers living together. However, he generally chooses to steer clear of the North Shore hype, preferring to spend his time surfing alone or riding motocross. Garcia features in the &quot;Sunny Garcia Surfing&quot; video game. He also has a clothing deal with Affliction Clothing where the tattoos he has on his body have been replicated on his own custom shirt.

Garcia has volunteered for the charity Surfers Healing, a foundation for autism, which has included beach clean-up days held in Hawaii and along California&#x27;s coast. In 2011, Garcia was the host of the Surfers for Cystic Fibrosis golf tournament fundraiser that has been organized by the charitable organization The Mauli Ola Foundation. Proceeds will fund surf experience days cystic fibrosis sufferers.

== Personal life ==
Garcia was born Vincent Sennen Garcia on January 14, 1970, in Mā&#x27;ili, on the Westside of Oahu, Hawaii. Garcia is of Puerto Rican and Hawaiian heritage from his father&#x27;s side and Hawaiian, Chinese, Filipino, Irish, and Native American heritage from his mother&#x27;s side. His nickname &quot;Sunny&quot; was given to him by his mother, due to his cheerful disposition as an infant. Following his parents&#x27; divorce, Garcia lived with his mother near Mā&#x27;ili point, close to the beach.

He has been married three times, most recently to Colleen McCullough in 2008, and has three teenage children from his first marriage.

In October 2006, Garcia was sentenced to federal prison for tax fraud after failing to pay taxes on unreported contest winnings from 1996 to 2001. Garcia failed to report over $471,000 in prize money on his tax returns for those years, resulting in a three-month sentence, beginning January 12, 2007, plus a further 7 months of house arrest and 80 hours community service with Goodwill. &quot;I spent my money foolishly and didn&#x27;t handle my affairs,&quot; he said outside the San Diego federal courtroom where he was sentenced.

On 21 February 2011, the ASP Rules and Disciplinary Committee convened to assess an alleged brawl involving Garcia, Jeremy Flores, and a local surfer, who allegedly dropped in on Garcia&#x27;s teenage son while surfing on 19 February 2011 on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. In accordance with the ASP Rulebook, immediately following the incident, then-active surfer Jeremy Flores was suspended from the 4-star Breaka Burleigh Pro event at Burleigh Heads, and then-eliminated surfer Garcia was suspended from the 4-star Burton Toyota Pro in Newcastle, New South Wales. An amateur cameraman who filmed the brawl alleged he was attacked by Sunny Garcia soon after, when he approached him on land. The cameraman lodged an official assault complaint with Gold Coast Police but withdrew it on the afternoon of 21 February 2011.

Witnesses allege Garcia went after the cameraman, knocking him to the ground and inflicting deep grazes to his back and arms with one of the man&#x27;s hands receiving injuries. The cameraman told police he wanted to drop his complaint after receiving threats from locals and Garcia&#x27;s overseas supporters warning of retribution and sought to lie low in his native Brazil until the surf rage furor died down. The cameraman was quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;m too scared to press charges...Garcia could go to jail and then people would want to get me. At the moment I just don&#x27;t feel safe...I&#x27;ve had threats on the internet I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d protect myself and my family if something happened&quot;. Garcia sought legal advice from high-profile Gold Coast lawyer Chris Nyst. On 3 May 2011, Queensland Police Service confirmed an arrest warrant has been issued for a 41-year-old man on a charge of common assault, the reporting newspaper linked the warrant to Garcia. On 4 May 2011, Garcia&#x27;s lawyer, Chris Nyst, confirmed the arrest warrant for Garcia, that it involves the young surfer who was allegedly assaulted, advised continued co-operation from Garcia with police and is confident his client would be exonerated.

On April 30, 2019, the World Surf League announced that Garcia was in critical condition at a Portland hospital. Garcia had attempted suicide the previous day. On September 17, 2019, Garcia&#x27;s daughter, Kaila, reported that Sunny had previously been in a coma, but was speaking again and doing physical, speech and occupational therapy. Since December 2014, Garcia had been open about his struggles with depression and mental health, and encouraged those who deal with mental illness to talk about their feelings with others.

<text>International Speedway Corporation (ISC) was a corporation whose primary business was the ownership and management of motorsports race tracks. ISC was founded by NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. in 1953 for the construction of Daytona International Speedway and in 1999 it merged with Penske Motorsports to become one of the largest motorsports companies in North America. The company played an important, though controversial, role in the modernization of the sport. It worked with NASCAR to create new tracks and update older ones in an effort to improve the racing and the experience for spectators and has constructed popular new tracks in regions previously thought uninterested in NASCAR. Because both companies have several members of the France family in top positions, ISC&#x27;s competitors have filed multiple lawsuits on antitrust grounds

On May 20, 2019, NASCAR agreed to purchase ISC for approximately US$2 billion, with it the purchase closing October 18, 2019. It has been dissolved into NASCAR.

==History==

===Bill France Racing===
International Speedway Corporation (ISC) was founded as Bill France Racing, Inc. (later Daytona International Speedway Corporation) in 1953 and in 1957 the company signed a contract for the use of land on which to build Daytona International Speedway, one of the world&#x27;s first superspeedways. A decade later, France decided to build another superspeedway, this time on a site near Talladega, Alabama and after its completion Talladega Superspeedway became NASCAR&#x27;s fastest track. These two tracks were the fastest on the series schedule until the advent of restrictor plates in 1988. In 1968, the company assumed its current name to reflect its more ambitious scope. Two years later, ISC created the Motor Racing Network, a play-by-play radio network for NASCAR races, with MRN&#x27;s first race coverage coming at the 1970 Daytona 500.

===Transition===
The early 1980s saw NASCAR&#x27;s popularity increase, not only among fans, but also with sponsors. Companies like Ford, General Motors, Winston and Gatorade were willing to put up advertising dollars and holding auto races became a much more profitable venture. To capitalize on this, the company began pursuing expansion through the purchase of existing tracks. In 1982, the company bought one of the series&#x27; most popular and traditional ones, Darlington Raceway which has been in operation since 1950, as well as Tucson Raceway Park, a dirt oval (since paved) in Arizona. The following year they partnered with Corning Glass Works to purchase the Watkins Glen International road course in upstate New York. In 1987, Bill France Sr. stepped down as president of the company with Jim France replacing him. Two years later, ISC incorporated its food service company, Americrown.

===Penske merger===
By this time ISC was profitable, but most of their races were still in the South and in mostly rural areas, with many of the country&#x27;s major cities like Los Angeles, Detroit, Miami and Chicago lacking a nearby track. ISC began looking for ways to change this in the late 1990s. Homestead-Miami Speedway was built in 1995 by Ralph Sanchez and Wayne Huizenga and in 1997 ISC and Penske Motorsports (owned by motorsports magnate Roger Penske) partnered with the track&#x27;s owners. In 1999, the company continued its push into the country&#x27;s urban centers when it merged with Penske, who at the time owned four speedways: Nazareth Speedway, North Carolina Speedway in Rockingham, North Carolina, Michigan International Speedway and the newly constructed Auto Club Speedway (which opened as California Speedway). Chairman Bill France Jr. cited the company&#x27;s &quot;attractive markets&quot; as one of the major reasons for going ahead with the deal. The new company retained the ISC name, with Penske&#x27;s son Gregory Penske joining the board of directors. Not all of the new tracks from the Penske merger fit into the company&#x27;s plans however, as Nazareth was soon closed down and Rockingham was sold. The merger also gave ISC a 90% stake in Homestead-Miami Speedway and the company soon bought out the final 10% to acquire complete control over the track.

In the same year, ISC formed the Motorsports Alliance with the owners of the historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway; this company would go after another huge market in Chicago by building the new Chicagoland Speedway in nearby Joliet, Illinois and by buying out the smaller Route 66 Raceway dragstrip. In 2007, ISC bought out its partners in the company to take control of both tracks.

In 2001, ISC would continue its trend towards modern facilities by constructing Kansas Speedway near Kansas City. In 2003, Lesa Kennedy took over from Jim France the role of president of the company. On June 1, 2009, John R. Saunders took over as President of ISC, becoming the first ISC president without a &quot;France&quot; surname. Saunders held the position of executive vice president of operations prior to becoming president.

On January 28, 2019, it was revealed on ISC&#x27;s 2018 annual report that a total of 78,000 seats were removed from Chicagoland, Darlington, Kansas, Martinsville, Michigan, Phoenix, and Richmond.

===Final years and acquisition by NASCAR===
When it merged with NASCAR, the company owned 13 active tracks which collectively held 18 of the 36 events on the schedule of the NASCAR Cup Series. In addition to the stock car racing that NASCAR is famous for, ISC tracks also hosted IndyCar Series races, USCC, Grand-Am, IMSA GT and SCCA sports car races, WKA go-kart races and AMA motorcycle races. Besides NASCAR, other stock car series like IROC and ARCA used their tracks.

The company&#x27;s other holdings included the Motor Racing Network, a radio network that broadcasts NASCAR events, and Americrown, a food service business that operates concession stands at its tracks. In 2005, ISC partnered with Speedway Motorsports, Inc. to form Motorsports Authentics, a company that markets and distributes NASCAR-related souvenirs and collectibles.

Prior to 2019, ISC was a separate company from NASCAR, but was also controlled by the France family. About 35% of the stock in ISC was owned by the heirs of NASCAR founder Bill France and the remainder traded on the stock market. Lesa Kennedy is CEO and Jim France is Chairman. On May 20, 2019, it was announced that NASCAR would fully acquire ISC and take it private. The sale was completed on October 21, 2019.

== Former Tracks ==

*Lists the year the company gained a controlling interest (&gt;50%) in the track.
*Nazareth was sold in 2015, the sale was conditional on racing not returning. It has been partially demolished.
*ISC sold North Carolina Speedway to Speedway Motorsports as part of a settlement in the Ferko lawsuit, who subsequently auctioned the track to former racer Andy Hillenburg. Hillenburg renamed the track Rockingham Speedway and is planning to hold several stock car events there in an attempt to revive the track.
*ISC shut down Pikes Peak International Raceway shortly after purchasing it, with NASCAR moving the track&#x27;s Busch Series date to Martinsville. In 2008, the track was sold to a private company, Pikes Peak International Raceway, LLC.
*ISC sold Tucson Raceway Park to David Deery, the track&#x27;s general manager, in 2002.
==Past expansion plans==
ISC and NASCAR made public their desire to have a presence in areas it sees as having the potential for growth, most notably the Pacific Northwest and New York City.

===Pacific Northwest===

====Marysville====
In 2003, ISC began scouting sites in Washington and Oregon for a new track to attract fans from around the Pacific Northwest, eventually settling on a site near Marysville, Washington in Snohomish County, Washington north of Seattle. Although the plan was met with some resistance from residents – particularly those living near the site for the planned speedway – local business owners and other residents were in favor of the plan, believing that the track would be good for the area&#x27;s economy and would create jobs. Unlike ISC&#x27;s later proposal in New York, the Marysville proposal would be supported by public funds raised through taxes, in much the same way as other sports venues in the area (KeyArena, Safeco Field, CenturyLink Field). The track would have been publicly owned and leased to ISC. In November 2004, local officials and ISC announced that they could not go through with the deal, saying that the costs for that particular site would be too high.

====Bremerton, Washington====
After the deal in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, Washington just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville proposal the proposal in Bremerton was to be partially funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme similar to the one used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC&#x27;s current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.

In March 2007, Washington state representative Larry Seaquist caused a minor controversy when he was quoted as saying, &quot;These people are not the kind of people you would want living next door to you. They&#x27;d be the ones with the junky cars in the front yard and would try to slip around the law.&quot; The quote was assumed to be an attack on NASCAR fans but Seaquist later claimed that it was directed at ISC.

In April 2007, this plan was also abandoned by ISC after failing to get their bill out of committee in the Washington State Legislature or to gain the full support of the Kitsap County Commissioners.

===New York City===
On November 30, 2004, the company made no secret of its interest in building a superspeedway in the New York market and was in talks with Staten Island officials about the logistics of constructing a track there.
 In 2004, ISC purchased on Staten Island in New York City for the construction of a short track that would hold 80,000 fans and have the New York City skyline as its backdrop. The proposal was met with fierce resistance from many of the island&#x27;s residents. At a public meeting in April 2006, police had to end the meeting early for fears of rioting and safety concerns. One report had a local councilman being put in a headlock after one particularly provoking speech (though one ISC official called it merely a &quot;hug for the TV cameras&quot;). In December 2006, ISC dropped their pursuit of the project.

===Colorado===
On February 13, 2007, the company announced that they were looking into building a track in Colorado. The 75,000-seat track would be built on one of two locations in Adams County, just east of Denver. The company would also be looking to use the same type of combination of public and private funds for the race track as in Kansas and Washington.

==Antitrust lawsuits==

===Ferko lawsuit===

Francis Ferko, a stockholder in Speedway Motorsports, Inc., sued NASCAR and ISC in 2002 for violating federal antitrust laws and breach of contract for not awarding a second Winston Cup Series date to Texas Motor Speedway, claiming that the second race was &quot;promised&quot; to the SMI track by NASCAR. After an attempt by NASCAR to get the case dismissed, another shareholder, Rusty Vaughn, joined the case as co-plaintiff in 2003. Although NASCAR CEO Brian France initially said he was going to fight the case in the courts, in April 2004 it was announced that the case had been settled out of court with Texas getting the Cup date previously belonging to North Carolina Speedway and, as part of the deal, agreeing to purchase North Carolina—which now had no dates at all—from ISC for $100 million. Other races on the schedule were also moved around as a result (see NASCAR Realignment).

===Kentucky Speedway lawsuit===
In 2005, Kentucky Speedway filed a similar lawsuit against ISC and NASCAR, claiming that NASCAR violated antitrust laws by not awarding them a Sprint Cup Series race, noting the close relationship between NASCAR, ISC, and the France Family. NASCAR sought to have the case thrown out by arguing that the speedway wasn&#x27;t trying to end the alleged anticompetitive practices, they were merely trying to benefit from them as well. This motion was denied, however. A motion to move the case from Kentucky to Florida – home of NASCAR and ISC – was also rejected. ISC, for its part, said it shouldn&#x27;t be involved in the case at all as it conducts no business in the state. Lawyers for Kentucky Speedway contended that the company does business online and is just as responsible for the lack of competition in granting the races as NASCAR is.

Initially, Kentucky had wanted the jury to force NASCAR to grant the speedway a Sprint Cup Series event but in 2007 they changed their demand to instead force the France family to sell either NASCAR or ISC. The track is also demanding that NASCAR develop objective standards for the awarding of their race events and damages of $200 million. In January 2008, the court dismissed the lawsuit, saying that the plaintiffs had failed to make their case. Kentucky Speedway says they will appeal the court&#x27;s decision.

In 2011, Kentucky Speedway, now owned by SMI, received a date, the Quaker State 400, on the Cup Series schedule, which lasted until 2020.

<doc id="1245151" wikidata="Q2403264" url="?curid=1245151" title="June Marlowe">
<text>June Marlowe (born Gisela Valaria Goetten, November 6, 1903 – March 10, 1984) was an American film actress who began her career during the silent film era. She was best known for her role as &quot;Miss Crabtree&quot; in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts.

==Career==
Marlowe was born to German parents in St. Cloud, Minnesota. She was a prolific actress in silent films during the 1920s, appearing in films opposite John Barrymore and Rin Tin Tin. She began her acting career shortly after her 1923 graduation from Hollywood High School, and was signed to a contract by Warner Brothers in 1924.

In 1925, she became one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars. In 1928, she was an actress under contract with Universal Studios. Her career did well until the introduction of talkies. Marlowe did not make an easy transition, and by 1930 she was starting to drift away from acting.

By chance, she happened to meet director Robert F. McGowan one day in a Los Angeles department store. McGowan was searching for an actress to portray the schoolteacher in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series of children&#x27;s comedies. After producer Hal Roach suggested that brunette Marlowe don a blonde wig to match the hair of the lead kid in the series, Jackie Cooper, she was given the part of Miss Crabtree.

Marlowe and Cooper were paired together in three &quot;Our Gang&quot; films, &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;, &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; and &quot;Love Business&quot;. She also had a small role in 1931&#x27;s &quot;Little Daddy&quot;. In addition to her work in &quot;Our Gang&quot;, Marlowe appeared in fellow Roach stars Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Pardon Us&quot;.

Marlowe&#x27;s Miss Crabtree character was used in only two more shorts, 1931&#x27;s &quot;Shiver My Timbers&quot; and 1932&#x27;s &quot;Readin&#x27; and Writin&#x27;&quot;. After Cooper left &quot;Our Gang&quot; in 1931 she appeared in MGM features.

==Later years and death==
In an October 1973 notice, Washington&#x27;s &quot;Evening Star&quot; newspaper announced that the Superior Court in Los Angeles &quot;returned a verdict of $100 damages to Henry M. Oviatt against June Marlowe, film actress, and her brother, Armour Marlowe, as the outgrowth of a motor car collision,&quot; adding that their automobile had &quot;collided with one containing Oviatt and Mrs. Nellie McLaren, who sued for $5,000 each, alleging injuries&quot;, and that &quot;Mrs. McLaren was denied damages.&quot;

On July 2, 1933, Marlowe married Hollywood businessman Rodney Sprigg and retired from motion pictures to become a housewife. The couple remained married until Sprigg&#x27;s death in 1982. In her later years, she suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dying from complications on March 10, 1984.

Marlowe was originally buried at the San Fernando Mission Cemetery. She was later re-interred in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.

==In popular culture==
The name of schoolteacher Edna Krabappel, a cartoon character from the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, was chosen by early &quot;Simpsons&quot; writers Wallace Wolodarsky and Jay Kogen in 1990 as a play on the fruit &quot;crabapple&quot; and as a reference to Miss Crabtree from the &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts.

June Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Our Gang&quot; character Miss Crabtree was mentioned in &quot;Buddy&quot;, a track on De La Soul&#x27;s album &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot;.

<doc id="1245153" wikidata="Q1809305" url="?curid=1245153" title="Lymphadenectomy">
<text>Lymphadenectomy, or lymph node dissection, is the surgical removal of one or more groups of lymph nodes. It is almost always performed as part of the surgical management of cancer. In a regional lymph node dissection, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed; in a radical lymph node dissection, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed.

==Indications==

Lymphadenectomies are usually done because many types of cancer have a marked tendency to produce lymph node metastasis early in their natural histories. This is particularly true of melanoma, head and neck cancer, differentiated thyroid cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer. Famed British surgeon Berkeley Moynihan once remarked that &quot;the surgery of cancer is not the surgery of organs; it is the surgery of the lymphatic system.&quot;

The better-known examples of lymphadenectomy are &quot;axillary lymph node dissection&quot; for breast cancer; &quot;radical neck dissection&quot; for head and neck cancer and thyroid cancer; &quot;D2 lymphadenectomy&quot; for gastric cancer; and &quot;total mesorectal excision&quot; for rectal cancer.

===With sentinel node biopsy===
For clinical stages I and II breast cancer, axillary lymph node dissection should only be performed after first attempting a sentinel node biopsy. A sentinel node biopsy can establish cancer staging of the axilla if there are positive lymph nodes present. It is also less risky than performing a lymphadenectomy, having fewer side effects and a much lower chance of causing lymphedema. If cancer is not present in the sentinel lymph nodes, then the axillary lymph node dissection should not be performed.

If one or two sentinel nodes have cancer that is not extensive, then no axillary dissection should be performed, but the person with cancer should have breast-conserving surgery and chemotherapy appropriate for their stage of cancer.
==Complications==
Lymphedema may result from lymphadenectomy. Extensive resection of lymphatic tissue can lead to the formation of a lymphocele.

It is uncertain whether inserting wound drainage after groin lymph nodes dissection can reduce complications such as seroma, haematoma, wound dehiscence, and wound infection.

<doc id="1245162" wikidata="Q1356535" url="?curid=1245162" title="Hoplology">
<text>Hoplology is the study of human combative behavior and performance.

==Etymology and history of the term==
The word &quot;hoplology&quot; is derived from the Greek terms &quot;hoplos&quot; (a mythical plate-armored animal) and ὅπλον &quot;hóplon&quot;, the equipment carried by some warriors in ancient Greece. The word &quot;hoplite&quot;, derived from &quot;hoplon&quot;, is the term for the classical Greek warrior who carried such equipment. The field originates in the 19th century with Sir Richard Burton; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it. Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of Donn F. Draeger.

Hoplology was at some time defined as the science of &quot;arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial&quot; (Burton, 1884), and subsequently as &quot;the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity&quot; (Draeger, 1982).

Sid Campbell, a black belt level, tenth dan-ranked in karate, defines hoplology as &quot;the study of the evolution and development of human combative behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours.&quot;

More recently, hoplology is defined as the investigation and analysis of all forms of armed combat. It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.

==Warriors, scholars, explorers and their hoplologies ==

=== 1800s – The accidental hoplologists: Burton &amp; Pitt-Rivers ===

Several pioneering anthropologists were also contributing to the field of hoplology while Burton was active. A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L. Pitt-Rivers developed a now outdated view of human evolution. Cultures, he concluded, evolved through time from technologically simpler societies to technologically complex societies. In other words, progress is an integral aspect of human history. Primitive Warfare 2. Oxford: The Journal of the Royal United Service Institution Vol. XII 1868 NO. LI. Working in the Trobriand Islands (just off Australia) around the time of WWI, the renowned Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski also delved into the field of hoplology. &quot;War and Weapons Among the Natives of the Trobriand Islands&quot;. Man. Vol. 20 pg.10-12 (1920).

Hoplology has always had a theoretical and practical orientation. Seeking to introduce more effective forms of close quarter combat to British soldiers Burton wrote two instructional manuals “ A Complete System of Bayonet Fighting.” London: William Clowes and Sons. 1853. And “A New System of Sword exercise for Infantry.” London: William Clowes and Sons.1876. while the memoir by the ex-Hussar F.J Norman&#x27;s “The Fighting Man of Japan: the training and exercise of the samurai.” London: Archibald Constable &amp; CO.

=== 1900s – The surveyors: Malinowski, Banks, Draeger and Armstrong ===
During the post WWII era the International Hoplology Society (&quot;IHS&quot;) was established by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems. Draeger&#x27;s student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger&#x27;s project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen&#x27;s wrote &quot;Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan&quot; (1963). Here he not only described the morphology of these weapons but explored how they were used by different schools or “ryu.”. During the 1970s, The Republic of China began a number of academically based (and often government funded) investigations into several folk combat traditions. One drawback to many of these works is that they have yet to be translated in English, limiting the exposure of their findings. In other cases, they were inspired by ethno-nationalist or ideological considerations and no real effort has been made to engage with the growing international literature on Martial Arts Studies.

Major expeditions

Malinowski, Bronislaw. 1914–1918: Trobriand Islands. An alien enemy on allied land, Malinowski engaged in long-term research of Trobiand culture including warfare, raiding, inter-village conflict and war – magic.

Banks, E. 1930s (est.). Sarawak Island, Indonesia. Research on weapons of the inhabitants of Sarawak.

Draeger, Donn. 1979. Sumatra, Draeger and his team visited the island of Sumatra. While visiting the Aceh tribe there, it appears that the entire group was somehow poisoned, perhaps deliberately.

====Overview of Draeger-IHS approach to hoplology====
Hoplology (as professed by Draeger-IHS) has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.

* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.
*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.
* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human&#x27;s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man&#x27;s evolution as a group-social animal.

There are three IHS axioms in hoplological studies.

* human combative behavior is rooted in man&#x27;s evolution.
* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal.
* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.

A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.

The Draeger-IHS hoplological view on violence: The entrenched nature of violence in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side &quot;…the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.&quot; (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.

<text>Sokoband, formerly known as Soko, is a jazz fusion duo, featuring pianist Michael Sokolowski and bassist Houston Ross. The group formed as a trio in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1991, with Sokolowski, Ross, and drummer John Gilmore. The group performed live for several years, then released their first studio album, &quot;In November Sunlight&quot;, in 1996. The album received notably high record sales for an instrumental album, mainly due to its guest appearance by members of the Dave Matthews Band—Dave Matthews, LeRoi Moore, and Tim Reynolds.

In 1997, Gilmore left the group, however Sokolowski and Ross remained close and continued performing together. The duo began working on their second album, &quot;Two&quot;, in 2000, which featured writing, arranging, and singing contributions by Ross, whereas the previous album primarily contributions strictly from Sokolowski. The album took almost five years to complete, and was not released until 2005, however the album featured many more guest performers than the previous album, including former band member John Gilmore.

Due to confusion with other bands of the same name, Soko was renamed to &quot;Sokoband&quot; in 2010.

On March 9, 2010, Sokoband released a self-titled album, &quot;Sokoband,&quot; which contains all eight tracks from &quot;In November Sunlight&quot;, as well as two additional tracks, entitled &quot;And Yet Your Smile&quot; and &quot;Nightfall.&quot; The band was not happy with the musical execution or production of the 1996 release, and wanted to present more definitive realizations of the compositions. Drummer on the project is Nir Z. Dave Matthews, Tim Reynolds, and LeRoi Moore appear again, along with Steve Kimock (guitars), Mike Colley (guitars), David Cast (saxophones), John Zias (guitars), David Darling (cello), and others.

== Synopsis ==
In the series, daughter Chrissy Sanford plays a hoax on her family by convincing them she had won a $25,000,000 lottery prize through the internet, and that it had changed her from a sweet girl into a spend-a-holic.

&quot;$25 Million Dollar Hoax&quot; contained guest appearances by Ed McMahon, George Gray, and N*SYNC&#x27;s Lance Bass.

Chrissy successfully pulled off the hoax, which won her and her family over $400,000 in cash and prizes.

<doc id="1245170" wikidata="Q351134" url="?curid=1245170" title="Winklepicker">
<text>Winklepickers or winkle pickers are a style of shoe or boot worn from the 1950s onward, especially popular with British rock and roll fans such as Teddy Boys. The feature that gives both the boot and shoe their name is the very sharp and long pointed toe, reminiscent of medieval poulaines and approximately the same as the long pointed toes on some women&#x27;s high-fashion shoes and boots in the 2000s. They are still popular in the goth, raggare and rockabilly subcultures.

==Names==
The extremely pointed toe was called a &quot;winkle picker&quot; because, in England, periwinkle snails (&quot;winkles&quot;) were a popular seaside snack which is eaten using a pin or other thin pointed object to carefully extract the soft parts out of the coiled shell. The same practice led to the figurative phrase &quot;to winkle something out&quot;. Other countries used other names for the same style, usually similarly humorous. In some parts of the United States, they are called &quot;roach stompers&quot; because of their ability to kill a roach in a corner. In Norway and Sweden, they were called &quot;mosquito chasers&quot; (; ).

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Winklepickers, inspired by the &quot;Polish&quot; poulaines worn by the medieval French nobility, were a conspicuous contrast to the brothel creepers worn by Teddy Boys. The male shoes were lace-up Oxford style with a low heel and an exaggerated pointed toe. A Chelsea boot style (elastic-sided with a two-inch—later as much as two-and-one-half-inch—) was notably worn by the Beatles but although it had a pointed toe, was not considered to be a winklepicker. Winklepicker shoes were also worn by Teddy Girls as well as being a fleeting fashion for young women generally.

=== 1960s ===
In the early 1960s, the winklepicker toe was popular with modernists, teddy boys and rockers. In the early 1960s, the point was effectively chopped off (they hung on for longer than that in the UK) and gave rise to the &quot;chisel toe&quot; on the footwear of all genders. However, winklepickers with traditional sharp-point styles made a comeback of sorts in the late 1970s and early 1980s (either as previously unworn old-stock, second-hand originals, or contemporary-production attempted copies) and worn by several subculture groups including mods, rockers, teddy boys, rockabillies, punks, rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll revivalists, and in the goth scene, where they are known as &quot;pikes&quot;.

Winklepickers with stiletto heels for women swept the UK in the late 1950s, and at one stage, the High Street versions were commonly worn by a large part of the adult female populace of the UK. They were often manufactured in Italy, but the handmade versions, notably those from Stan&#x27;s Shoes of Battersea, were the most extreme, if somewhat bulky-looking at the toe compared with the Italian styles.

The original 1960s winklepicker stilettos were similar to the long, pointed toe that has been fashionable on women&#x27;s shoes and boots in Europe of late. The long, sharp toe was always teamed with a stiletto heel (or spike heel), which, as today, could be as low as one-and-a-half inches or as high as five inches, though most were in the three- to four-inch range. The stiletto heels on the original 1960s styles were, however, much more curved in at the rear (also sometimes sharply waisted and slightly flared out at the top piece) than most of the recent pointy-toed fashion shoes, which often have straighter, thicker, more set-back heels, rather at odds with the look of the pointed toe. In most cases, too, the modern shoe toes lack the length of the true 1960s winklepicker and bear more resemblance to the less pointed mass-produced versions of the era.

They attained some notoriety, when they first appeared, as a result of being worn in gang fights (sometimes by both sexes), although there is some question as to the accuracy of contemporary newspaper accounts. In fact, although the winklepicker looks lethal, it would be far more likely for damage to be caused to the delicately pointed shoe than to the opponent in any serious kicking incident.

===Modern day===
By the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, winklepickers were worn with 1960s mod blazers, Western shirts, vintage T shirts, and skinny jeans by many indie pop bands and musicians, such as of Kings of Leon, Kaiser Chiefs, the Kills, Jack White, Mod Fun, Neils Children, Blanaid Montague, Klaxons, and Daniel Johns. The shoes are closely related to British garage rock band the Horrors, who even went as far as to have a winklepicker boot with three buckles on their official merchandise t-shirt along with the words &quot;I am a horror.&quot; Faris Badwan has personally endorsed Paolo Vandini Veers. They are also worn by English comedians Russell Brand and Noel Fielding and English DJ and TV presenter Alex Zane.

Winklepicker boots are very popular in Germany among the modern Vogue goth and punk subcultures, who refer to the boots as &quot;pikes&quot; or &quot;pickers&quot;.

Although slightly pointed toes are often a feature of women&#x27;s fashion shoes, they are usually nowadays &quot;tamed down&quot; or shortened (often sacrificing comfortable toe space) for mass market appeal.

<doc id="1245185" wikidata="Q2308517" url="?curid=1245185" title="Speedway Motorsports">
<text>Speedway Motorsports, LLC is an American company that owns and manages auto racing facilities that host races sanctioned by NASCAR, NHRA, World of Outlaws and other racing series. The company was founded by Bruton Smith and has its headquarters at Charlotte Motor Speedway, in Concord, North Carolina, just north of Charlotte. Speedway Motorsports owns nine racing facilities with a combined seating capacity of approximately 885,000. In addition to operating racetracks, Speedway Motorsports owns Performance Racing Network (PRN), U.S. Legend Cars International, and co-owns Motorsports Authentics.

After trading for 25 years on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was known as Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (SMI), the company was taken private in September 2019, and today is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sonic Financial Corporation, itself owned by members of Bruton Smith&#x27;s family. The &quot;SMI&quot; initialism is still sometimes used colloquially.

==History==
Speedway Motorsports didn&#x27;t officially incorporate until 1994. Bruton Smith began building SMI in the 1950s when he worked as a race promoter and eventually built Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1959. Smith left the racing business in the early 1960s to pursue other business ventures. He became very successful and by 1975 had owned majority shares in CMS and took over as CEO. A year later he appointed H.A. &quot;Humpy&quot; Wheeler as general manager. Smith began to expand CMS, adding additional grandstands and facilities including condominiums, a first for a sports facility.

In 1990, Smith began to acquire additional speedway properties beginning with Atlanta Motor Speedway. As he did with Charlotte, Smith began expanding seating and facilities at Atlanta. In 1992, lights were added to CMS, making it one of the first speedways to offer night racing, and the company developed the Legends car racing circuit, now called U.S. Legend Cars International. Smith incorporated Speedway Motorsports in December 1994, and on February 24, 1995 took the company public by offering shares of stock, debuting at $18 per share.

In 1996, SMI began to quickly expand, acquiring two additional facilities; Bristol Motor Speedway and Sonoma Raceway. A year later, the company finished construction of the $250 million, 150,000 seat Texas Motor Speedway. Between 1993 and 1998, SMI had increased its total seating capacity from 176,000 to 551,000. In 1999 SMI outbid rival International Speedway Corporation (ISC) to purchase Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Smith had outbid ISC by $15 million to make a total $215 million purchase. That same year, SMI sold the naming rights of its flagship Charlotte Motor Speedway to Lowe&#x27;s, a $35 million deal that would last until 2009.

Until 1999, Speedway Motorsports was the top track owner in the motorsports industry. That year, International Speedway Corporation, then the second largest track owner, acquired Penske Motorsports, then the third largest track owner. The $623 million deal propelled ISC to the top track owner, and SMI fell to second. Smith then turned his attention towards securing two NASCAR dates at each of his facilities. As of 2011, only four SMI owned tracks hold two NASCAR dates.

SMI purchased North Wilkesboro Speedway and New Hampshire Motor Speedway in 2007, and in 2008 purchased Kentucky Speedway. Today SMI owns nine racing facilities, eight of which are used to host major racing series including NASCAR, IndyCar and NHRA. As of December 31, 2009, the combined total permanent seating capacity was approximately 885,000. SMI owned tracks host 13 of the 36 NASCAR Cup Series races, including four races in the NASCAR playoffs, plus the NASCAR All-Star Race.

In December 2018, Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway operator Tony Formosa Jr. reached an agreement with Speedway Motorsports and its main Tennessee track Bristol Motor Speedway to co-operate the facility and make the necessary upgrades for the track to host NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series races again and continue to host weekly racing events. Efforts were renewed in late 2020 as SMI and Bristol launched negotiations with the City of Nashville with the goal of hosting NASCAR races as early as 2022. The track ultimately did not hold races in 2022, although talks between both parties continued.

When NASCAR announced that Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, would host the national series beginning in 2021, SMI assumed management responsibilities for the NASCAR at COTA race weekend.

In addition to speedway properties, SMI also owns the Performance Racing Network, a radio network that broadcasts all NASCAR races at SMI owned tracks. SMI also equally owns Motorsports Authentics, a joint venture formed with International Speedway Corporation, to produce, market and sell licensed motorsports merchandise.

==Facilities owned==
==Notable purchases==
SMI has a history of purchasing tracks to obtain NASCAR race dates. The company&#x27;s purchases and closures of the tracks in order to obtain a second NASCAR date for Texas Motor Speedway led to the Ferko lawsuit.

===North Wilkesboro Speedway===
In 1996, the company purchased half interest in North Wilkesboro Speedway in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina along with Bob Bahre of New Hampshire International Speedway (now New Hampshire Motor Speedway). SMI moved one of North Wilkesboro Speedway&#x27;s dates to Texas Motor Speedway and Bob Bahre moved the second date to his facility. On November 2, 2007, SMI purchased NHIS and part of the purchase resulted in SMI gaining full ownership of North Wilkesboro Speedway.

===North Carolina Speedway===
In 2004, as a result of the Ferko lawsuit, SMI gained ownership of the North Carolina Speedway in Rockingham, North Carolina. SMI closed North Carolina Speedway and moved the track&#x27;s final race date to Texas Motor Speedway. On October 2, 2007, SMI sold North Carolina Speedway at auction. The track was purchased by &quot;Indiana&quot; Andy Hillenburg for $4.4 million, and renamed Rockingham Speedway.

===New Hampshire Motor Speedway===
On November 2, 2007, SMI announced the purchase of New Hampshire International Speedway from Bob Bahre, and renamed the facility New Hampshire Motor Speedway. This has led to speculation that SMI would move one of New Hampshire&#x27;s dates to Las Vegas Motor Speedway and/or swap the date with the fall race at Texas Motor Speedway (TMS has expressed an interest in moving the fall race away from the first weekend in November, which is also the opening weekend of deer hunting season in Texas). In 2018, the fall race weekend was moved to Las Vegas.

===Kentucky Speedway===
On May 22, 2008, SMI announced it had purchased Kentucky Speedway from Kentucky Speedway, LLC. The track had been trying to secure a NASCAR Sprint Cup race for several years. SMI was finally victorious in their pursuit, with Kentucky Speedway receiving its inaugural Sprint Cup race on July 9, 2011. It appears this came at the expense of SMI-owned Atlanta Motor Speedway, which dropped from two races to one on the 2011 Sprint Cup schedule. It was announced in September 2020 that Kentucky Speedway would not return for the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series schedule, and its date would be given back to Atlanta Motor Speedway.

===Dover Motorsports===
Dover Motorsports, Inc. (formerly Dover Downs Entertainment) was a company that owned several auto racing circuits in the United States. The company was based in Dover, Delaware, the home of its flagship track Dover International Speedway, a concrete oval with a seating capacity of 95,500 that opened in 1969. The company formerly owned the Dover Downs harness racing track adjacent to the Dover speedway. Dover Motorsports also operated Nashville Superspeedway, a 1.333-mile concrete oval track in Lebanon, Tennessee.

Dover Motorsports owned Memphis Motorsports Park, a 0.75-mile tri-oval asphalt short track in Millington, Tennessee, but closed the track in October 2009 to competition. It was later sold to Palm Beach International Raceway after sitting unused for over a year. Dover also owned Gateway International Raceway, a 1.25-mile egg-shaped asphalt oval track in Madison, Illinois, which was sold in 2011. After attempts to sell Nashville Superspeedway, the venue reopened in 2021 and hosted a NASCAR race weekend, replacing one of the race weekends at Dover International Speedway.

On November 8, 2021, Speedway Motorsports announced that it had agreed to purchase Dover Motorsports, owner of Dover International Speedway and Nashville Superspeedway at the time, for $3.61 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $131.5 million. The deal closed in December, with SMI gaining full control of the two tracks.

<doc id="1245190" wikidata="Q237944" url="?curid=1245190" title="Sonia Rykiel">
<text>Sonia Rykiel (; ; 25 May 1930 – 25 August 2016) was a French fashion designer and writer. She created the Poor Boy Sweater, which was featured on the cover of French &quot;Elle&quot; magazine. Her knitwear designs and new fashion techniques led her to be dubbed the &quot;Queen of Knits&quot;. The Sonia Rykiel label was founded in 1968, upon the opening of her first store, making clothing, accessories, and fragrances. Rykiel was also a writer, and her first book was published in 1979. In 2012, Rykiel revealed that she was suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. She died from complications of the disease on 25 August 2016.

==Early and personal life==
Sonia Flis was born to Jewish parents in Neuilly-sur-Seine on 25 May 1930. Her mother was from Poland, and her father was a watchmaker from Romania. She was the eldest of five sisters. In 1948, at the age of 17, she was employed to dress the window displays in a Parisian textile store, the Grande Maison de Blanc.

In 1953, Sonia married Sam Rykiel, owner of &quot;Laura&quot;, a boutique selling elegant clothing. The couple had two children, Nathalie and Jean-Philippe Rykiel. They divorced in 1968.

Rykiel often wore her clothes from her own label and stuck to wearing dark green, brown, navy, and black garments. Of her style, Rykiel said, &quot;I hate wasting time getting dressed. I like to put something on and just think: &#x27;Yes. That&#x27;s it.&#x27; When I&#x27;m tired I like to dress very simply – perhaps a black crêpe jacket and black crêpe trousers.&quot; Rykiel was also known for her distinctive hairstyle – red hair cut into a bob with a heavy fringe.

In 2009, Rykiel signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

==Fashion==

===Early beginnings===
In 1962, unable to find something to wear during her pregnancy, Rykiel used an Italian clothing supplier to design and create a dress and a sweater, which incorporated high cut arm holes and a shrunken fit to cling to the body. The practical and modern style led to orders from her friends and became known as the Poor Boy Sweater. Rykiel started selling the sweaters from her husband&#x27;s store and the Poor Boy Sweater made the cover of French &quot;Elle&quot; magazine, bringing Rykiel fame. Actress Audrey Hepburn bought 14 sweaters in every colour. 

===&quot;Sonia Rykiel&quot;===
Rykiel&#x27;s husband helped her to create the Sonia Rykiel Company in 1965. In 1968, Rykiel opened her first boutique store on the Left Bank.

Rykiel invented various fashion techniques. She was the first designer to put seams on the outside of a garment, leave hems unfinished and use slogans on her sweaters. She has also been credited with popularisation of wearing black. In 1972, Rykiel was dubbed &quot;Queen of Knits&quot; by &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;. She was also known as &quot;Coco Rykiel&quot;, a comparison to Coco Chanel. In 1977, she became the first designer to create a line of clothes for mail order firm 3 Suisses. The following year, she launched her first fragrance called Septième sens (Seventh Sense). 

By the early 1990s, the Sonia Rykiel company had grown into a $75 million business, with two women’s wear lines, men’s wear, children’s wear, accessories and perfume, and was sold by 250 retailers in 40 countries.

Nathalie Rykiel was appointed president of Sonia Rykiel in 2007. In October 2008, at a fashion show celebrating the brand&#x27;s 40th anniversary, tributes were paid to Rykiel. Thirty fashion designers, including Ralph Lauren, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Giorgio Armani, showcased their visions of the &quot;Rykiel woman&quot;. In December 2009, Rykiel and H&amp;M introduced &quot;Sonia Rykiel pour H&amp;M&quot;, two masstige operations with the Swedish retailer. An event was held at the Grand Palais in Paris to celebrate the collection.

In January 2012 the Sonia Rykiel company became majority-owned by the Hong Kong-based First Heritage Brands, part of the investment company Fung Brands. Fung Brands acquired 80 percent of Sonia Rykiel, with the Rykiel family retaining a 20 percent stake as well as the company’s real estate. 

That same year, Canadian designer Geraldo da Conceição succeeded April Crichton as the artistic director of Rykiel. Julie de Libran took over the role during the following year. 

In 2016, Nathalie Rykiel sold the family’s remaining 20 percent stake to First Heritage Brands and relinquished her board seat, though the family kept the real estate. Shortly after, the company implemented a major restructuring plan that included closing the Sonia by Sonia Rykiel diffusion line, adding lower-price items to the main Sonia Rykiel collection, and laying off workers.

For its advertising campaigns, Sonya Rykiel has been working with photographers including Dominique Issermann (1979–1993), Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott (2013), Craig McDean (2014) Juergen Teller (2015) and Glen Luchford (2016).

In mid-2019, after years of mismanagement by First Heritage Brands, the Sonia Rykiel brand liquidated its operations, after a Paris commercial court judge rejected Lévy, the only remaining bidder for the company. In late 2019, brothers Eric and Michael Dayan bought the Sonia Rykiel company for a reported sum of 10 million euros.

==Other activities==
===Writing===
Rykiel was also a writer. She wrote several books about fashion, a collection of children&#x27;s stories, magazine columns and an epistolary novel with Régine Deforges. Her first book &quot;Et Je La Voudrais Nue&quot; (&quot;I Would Like Her Naked&quot;) was published in 1979. In 2012, she co-authored &quot;N&#x27;oubliez pas que je joue&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t forget it&#x27;s a game&quot;) with journalist Judith Perrignon.

===Interior design===
Rykiel contributed to the interior decoration for the Hôtel de Crillon (1985) and the Hôtel Lutetia.

===Music and film===
Rykiel collaborated with impresario and performer Malcolm McLaren on the song &quot;Who the Hell is Sonia Rykiel?&quot; on McLaren&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Paris&quot;.

Rykiel makes a cameo appearance in Robert Altman&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot;. Altman was inspired to make the film after attending one of Rykiel&#x27;s ready-to-wear fashion shows. The lead character, played by actress Anouk Aimée, was based on the designer. Rykiel appeared as Hortense in the 1998 French comedy film &quot;Riches, belles, etc.&quot;. 

===Costume design===
Rykiel designed and created the costumes for the French musical comedy &quot;Les Dix Commandements&quot; in 2000. 

==Death==
Rykiel died at her home in Paris during the morning of 25 August 2016, aged 86. Her death was caused by complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Rykiel revealed in 2012 that she had been suffering from the disease for fifteen years. She is survived by her children Nathalie and Jean-Philippe Rykiel. President François Hollande called Rykiel &quot;a pioneer&quot;, while Jean-Marc Loubier stated &quot;It is a sad day but Sonia Rykiel leaves behind her an extraordinary legacy.&quot;

== Exhibitions ==
The Sonia Rykiel brand and its designs were the subject of an exhibition at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris from 20 November 2008 to 20 April 2009, curated by Olivier Saillard.

<doc id="1245191" wikidata="Q604347" url="?curid=1245191" title="Jackie Trent">
<text>Yvonne Ann Gregory (born Yvonne Ann Burgess; 6 September 1940 – 21 March 2015), better known by her stage name Jackie Trent, was an English singer-songwriter and actress. She was best known for co-writing (with Tony Hatch) several hits for Petula Clark in the 1960s and the theme tune to the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 1985.

==Career==
===Early years===
Trent was born in Newcastle-under-Lyme, the daughter of coal-miner Les Burgess and his wife Lily. Her first stage appearance was as an eight-year-old ingenue in the pantomime &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; and at the age of nine she won first prize in a national poetry competition. At the age of 11 she won the &quot;Carrol Levis and His Discoveries&quot; talent show and thereafter changed her stage name to &quot;Jackie Trent&quot;, having lived in Stoke-on-Trent for the few years previous. She sang at local venues and was known as &quot;the Vera Lynn of the Potteries&quot;.

Her first single, &quot;Pick Up the Pieces&quot;, was released in 1962 on the Oriole label, but it was not until Pye Records and three years later that she scored her first hit with &quot;Where Are You Now&quot;, written by Tony Hatch and Trent, who at that time were involved in a successful professional collaboration with Petula Clark. The song was featured in the popular TV series &quot;It&#x27;s Dark Outside&quot;. &quot;Where Are You Now&quot; reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in May 1965, topping the chart for one week. It reached number three in Canada. The song was written and recorded in just four days after Hatch was asked by Granada TV to produce a song for the female lead in the programme to be seen on screen playing to herself. The lyrics were written by Trent on Christmas 1964, just before she embarked on a three-month tour of South Africa. When the song first hit the TV screen, people contacted &quot;TV Times&quot; to ask where they could buy the record with sales accelerating. The song went to number one in May 1965, replacing the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;.

Petula Clark&#x27;s 1966 hit, &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Live Without Your Love&quot; was inspired by the ongoing affair between Trent and Hatch, and they subsequently went public with their relationship. In August 1967 they were married in Kensington. Their duet &quot;The Two Of Us&quot; topped the Australian charts and created a demand for concert and cabaret performances earning the duo the nickname of &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs Music&quot;.

Although she recorded several singles and albums, both as a solo artist and with her husband, Trent was more successful as a songwriter than a singer. In addition to their compositions for Clark, over the years she and Hatch wrote extensively for other artists, including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jack Jones, Nancy Wilson, Des O&#x27;Connor, Val Doonican, The Montanas, Shirley Bassey, and Vikki Carr.

In 1968 the couple also wrote the song &quot;Joanna&quot;, a hit for Scott Walker.

In the late 1960s, Trent returned to the stage with a UK tour of the musical &quot;Nell&quot;, playing Gwynne opposite Hermione Baddeley as the title character. The show opened at the Richmond Theatre for a season in 1970.

===1970s===
In 1970, Trent recorded the Les Vandyke-composed &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Near You&quot; and in March that year she appeared on the cover of the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot;. The 1970s saw Hatch and Trent diversify into the world of musical theatre. The first of their projects, &quot;The Card&quot;, based on Arnold Bennett&#x27;s novel, with book by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, ran in London&#x27;s West End with Jim Dale and Millicent Martin in the starring roles. (Coincidentally, Clark had starred in the 1952 film version with Sir Alec Guinness). An original cast album was released in 1975. A rewritten version of the show, starring Peter Duncan and Hayley Mills, played the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre in the 1990s and spawned a new cast album.

The second Hatch/Trent musical was &quot;Rock Nativity&quot;, with book and lyrics by David Wood. Initiated and produced by Cameron Mackintosh, it first played in Newcastle upon Tyne. An updated version of the show toured nationally in 1976, and was broadcast nationally by Scottish TV. A full-length concert version was also recorded at the Cork Opera House for transmission by RTÉ.

In 1972, the couple wrote the song &quot;We&#x27;ll Be With You&quot;, a celebration of Trent&#x27;s home town football club Stoke City reaching the final of the Football League Cup. Released under the name &#x27;The Potters&#x27; (the club&#x27;s nickname), the song was recorded using Pye Records&#x27; outside broadcast unit and featured the team and supporters. Some 40 years on it is still played at all Stoke City home games and reached number 34 on the UK chart. The couple wrote the theme for the game show &quot;Mr and Mrs&quot; for Border Television which was used from 1975.

===Theme to &quot;Neighbours&quot;===

After Trent and Hatch relocated to Australia in the 1980s, they were asked to write the theme song for the television soap-opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. The soap opera was going to be called &quot;Ramsay Street&quot;, before the couple penned the song. Trent told Jessie Stoelwinder from &quot;The West Australian&quot;, &quot;We wrote the song as &quot;Neighbours&quot; because we said Ramsay Street was too close to &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, which was the major soap in Britain.&quot; The theme was written and recorded in a day and Trent said &quot;We called in Barry Crocker at about 10pm to put his voice on it and it was on the producer&#x27;s desk by 10am the following morning. And they loved it, so the series was then called &quot;Neighbours&quot;.&quot;

===Recording career===
In a recording career spanning 1962–1990, Trent issued a total of twelve albums, five compilations and 51 singles.

===Later years===
After returning to the UK, Trent toured with the musical &quot;High Society&quot;, in 1995.

In 2014 Trent worked with the Porthill Players on a stage show of her life. Prior to her death, she had been scheduled to appear in &quot;Jackie&quot; in May 2015.

==Personal life==
When Trent and Hatch married in August 1967, Hatch already had two daughters from his first marriage. The couple went on to have a son and daughter together. They separated in 1995 and divorced in 2002. Hatch married Maggie Clough in May 2005, living with her in Spain.

Trent married Colin Gregory in November 2005. She died in hospital on 21 March 2015, aged 74, in Menorca, Spain, after a long illness.

<text>John Earman (born 1942) is an American philosopher of physics. He is an emeritus professor in the History and Philosophy of Science department at the University of Pittsburgh. He has also taught at the University of California, Los Angeles, Rockefeller University, and the University of Minnesota, and was president of the Philosophy of Science Association.

==Life and career==
John Earman was born in Washington, D.C. in 1942. Earman received his PhD at Princeton University in 1968 with a dissertation on temporal asymmetry (titled &quot;Some Aspects of Temporal Asymmetry&quot;) and it was directed by Carl Gustav Hempel and Paul Benacerraf. After holding professorships at UCLA, the Rockefeller University, and the University of Minnesota, he joined the faculty of the History and Philosophy of Science department of the University of Pittsburgh in 1985. He remained at Pittsburgh for the rest of his career.

Earman is a former president of the Philosophy of Science Association and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences. He is a member of the Archive Board of the Phil-Sci Archive.

==The hole argument==

Earman has notably contributed to debate about the &quot;hole argument&quot;. The hole argument was invented for different purposes by Albert Einstein late in 1913 as part of his quest for the general theory of relativity (GTR). It was revived and reformulated in the modern context by John3 (a short form for the &quot;three Johns&quot;: John Earman, John Stachel, and John Norton).

With the GTR, the traditional debate between absolutism and relationalism has been shifted to whether or not spacetime is a substance, since the GTR largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. The &quot;hole argument&quot; offered by John Earman is a powerful argument against manifold substantialism.

This is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows:

Define a function formula_1 as the identity function over all elements over the manifold formula_2, excepting a small neighbourhood (topology) formula_3 belonging to formula_2. Over formula_3, formula_1 comes to differ from identity by a smooth function.

With use of this function formula_1 we can construct two mathematical models, where the second is generated by applying formula_1 to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time formula_9, where formula_10 is a time function created by a foliation of spacetime, but differ after formula_9.

These considerations show that, since substantialism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantialism, as the case between determinism or indeterminism should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantialism.

<text>Cropredy ( ) is a village and civil parish on the River Cherwell, north of Banbury in Oxfordshire.

==History==
The village has Anglo-Saxon origins and is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. The toponym comes from the Old English words &quot;cropp&quot; (a hill) and &quot;ridig&quot; (a stream).

From 1519 onwards Brasenose College, Oxford owned extensive land in Cropredy. Manor Farm was built in 1693 and Prescote Manor was built in 1721.

Cropredy Bridge on the River Cherwell was the site of a major battle in 1644 during the English Civil War. King Charles engaged the Parliamentarian army led by Sir William Waller. The battle was a stalemate; the Parliamentarian side suffered heavy casualties but ultimately prevented the King&#x27;s forces from crossing the bridge. A plaque on the bridge bears the inscription: &quot;Site of the Battle of Cropredy Bridge 1644. From Civil War deliver us.&quot; Before the battle, some of the church valuables were hidden in the River Cherwell; these included the brass eagle lectern, which was not recovered for 50 years, during which time it was damaged.

==Church and chapels==
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin is built of the local ironstone, which is a ferrous Jurassic limestone. Parts of the south aisle date from the 13th century. However, most of the present building is Decorated Gothic and was built in the 14th century, including the chancel arch, nave arcades, east window and most of the windows in the south aisle. In the 15th century Perpendicular Gothic alterations were made including a clerestory added above the nave, the north aisle rebuilt with new windows, and both aisles extended eastwards to form side chapels.

The church had a clock by 1512, when the vicar, Roger Lupton, left £6 13s 4d in his will in trust for the churchwardens to pay someone to keep the clock running and chiming every quarter-hour and the village curfew. Lupton&#x27;s will prescribed that the wardens be fined 6s 8d per month of £10 per year if they were to fail. A new clock may have been installed around 1700, and Lupton&#x27;s clock may then have been transferred to Claydon. The later clock was itself replaced in 1831 with a new one made by John Moore and Sons of Clerkenwell, London.

The bell tower has a ring of bells. There were six, but in 2007 two new treble bells increased this to eight. One of the new bells is named &quot;St Mary&quot;; the other &quot;Fairport Convention Festival Bell&quot;.

St Mary&#x27;s parish is now part of the Benefice of Shires&#x27; Edge along with those of Claydon, Great Bourton, Mollington and Wardington.

By the 13th century Cropredy was associated with the legend of Saint Fremund, a Mercian who was said to have been martyred in the 9th century. Fremund&#x27;s relics are supposed to have been moved from Offchurch in Warwickshire to Prescote, where they were lost for a time and then rediscovered and moved to Cropredy. They were then moved to the Augustinian Priory at Dunstable, probably in 1207, but an association with Fremund remained at Cropredy. There are records of gifts to a chapel and shrine to the saint here in 1488 and 1539, and a chantry priest serving in St. Fremund&#x27;s chapel in 1489. During the English Reformation under Edward VI the Crown sold the chapel and its contents in 1549 and it was probably demolished. No trace remains, its site is unknown and it is not clear whether the shrine chapel was at St. Mary&#x27;s church or elsewhere in the parish.

A Methodist chapel had been built by 1822. The congregation outgrew it so a larger chapel was built on a new site in 1881.

==Transport==

Building of the Oxford Canal began at Hawkesbury Junction on the Coventry Canal in 1769 and reached Cropredy in October 1777. The canal passes between the River Cherwell and the village. There is a canal lock here, and at the south end of the village a wharf was built. This originally handled coal from the Coventry coalfield, and now serves the canal&#x27;s popular leisure traffic. The wharf was briefly the canal&#x27;s terminus, until the section from Cropredy to Banbury opened in March 1778. The canal finally reached Oxford and the River Thames at the end of 1789.

The Oxford and Rugby Railway had been built from northwards past Cropredy by 1852. It never reached , but at it met the Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway and thus became part of an important north–south main line. The Great Western Railway took over the O&amp;RR before it was completed, and opened Cropredy railway station to serve the village. British Railways closed the station in 1956, but the railway remains open as part of the Chiltern Main Line.

Cropredy&#x27;s public transport is bus route 503 between Banbury and Long Itchington in Warwickshire, operated by Catteralls Coaches with one bus each way a week on Thursdays only and route 502, operated by Stagecoach, between Temple Herdewyke and Banbury with one bus each way a week on Saturdays and Good Friday.

==Education==
A National School, Cropredy and Bourton School, was opened in Cropredy in 1855. In 1867 it was renamed simply Cropredy School and a second classroom was added. In 1947 it was reorganised as a junior and infant school. Today it is a Church of England primary school.

==Amenities==
Cropredy has two public houses: the 17th century Brasenose Arms and the Red Lion. The village has a GP&#x27;s practice and several shops.

==Annual music festival==
On farmland east of the village British folk rock band Fairport Convention stages an annual three-day music festival titled Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention. The festival has expanded from a one-day event first held in 1980 (although the band had played fundraisers in the village since 1976).

<doc id="1245240" wikidata="Q4633123" url="?curid=1245240" title="2HD">
<text>2HD is an Australian radio station in New South Wales. Owned and operated as part of the Super Radio Network of stations, it currently broadcasts a news talk and classic hits format to Newcastle, New South Wales and the Hunter Valley. First broadcast on 27 January 1925, it was established by founder Harry Douglas – from which the station derives its name – and is based in studios in Sandgate alongside sister station New FM.

2HD is Australia&#x27;s second-oldest existing radio station, first going to air just hours after Sydney&#x27;s 2UE.

==History==
===1925–1945===
2HD began broadcasting on 27 January 1925, a day after 2UE in Sydney began operations. The station&#x27;s call sign was the initials of the founder, Hugh Alexander McKay Douglas (known as Harry), not &quot;Hunter District&quot; as is commonly believed. Douglas was a man ahead of his time. He had been a keen amateur radio enthusiast for some years prior to 1925, and an alderman on the Newcastle City Council from 1919 to 1922. He was also the first person to own a sulky and car tyre retreading business in Newcastle, as well as having the first petrol station in Newcastle with a bowser.

The radio station was originally situated in the Newcastle suburb of Hamilton, but soon after moved to the corner of Darby and King Streets (Douglas&#x27;s tyre business address). Douglas sold the station to William Johnston in 1928, who sold the station to the &quot;Airsales Broadcasting Company&quot; in 1930. Airsales owned the company for 10 years, and was responsible for the move to its landmark studio building in Sandgate, which was the home of 2HD for nearly 50 years. Although the building is now very different, the middle section is still the 1931 building.

Under controversial circumstances during World War II, 2HD was closed in 1941, under the National Security Regulations. At the time, the station was owned by the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and around 25 staff were employed. Stories circulated that the owners were sending covert messages to enemy agents, based on the names and times of the music being played. 2HD remained silent until near the end of the war, when the Australian Labor Party and the Labor Council of New South Wales bought the station, resuming transmissions on 15 January 1945.

One of 2HD&#x27;s notable personalities in the 1930s was &quot;Uncle&quot; Rex Sinclair, who continued to perform on local radio and stage until shortly before his death in 2001.

===1945–1977===
The Labor Party and the NSW Labour Council owned 2HD from 1945 until 1999. For the first 29 years of its ownership, the station was under the management of Jim Storey, with his wife Twink acting as program director and on-air personality. Other announcers during this time included Harry Randall, Stuart Dibbley and Tom Delaney.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, 2HD was one of the founding shareholders of local television station NBN Television.

2HD broadcast in the popular &quot;The Good Guys of Life&quot; format, also used by other stations, including 2SM Sydney. Presenters during this time included Harry Randall, Tom Delaney, Art Ryan, Haff Enegg, Mal Lamonte, John Hill, Allan McGirvan, Mike Jeffries, Malcolm Elliott, Keith Haerris, Graeme Gilbert, Don Mayo, Rob Maynard and Cliff Musgrave. Towards the end of this period, announcer Geoff Gregory joined the station, but was better known as a program director, and host of the Sunday night program &quot;Country Sounds&quot;.

After the &quot;Good Guys&quot; era ended, 2HD transmitted other formats including Easy Alternative and country. In 1977, the original office building on Maitland Road Sandgate was closed. Several years prior to that, the building was gradually being demolished, starting with the destruction of the original transmitter building to make way for a dual carriageway along Maitland Road in 1964. The increased traffic and the location of the road near the old building was taking its toll. A new administration building, nicknamed &quot;the submarine&quot; was built, and Premier Neville Wran opened the building in 1977.

===1977–today===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the station was the subject of a takeover bid from NBN, which resulted in a shake-up in ownership at the television station, and the bid was eventually rejected.

For decades after the end of the &quot;Good Guys&quot; era, the station&#x27;s ratings were in the doldrums, but it accomplished its first number-one ratings success in 1987, after adopting a strong news and talk format. Factors in the success were the recruitment of 2KO&#x27;s Pat Barton to present the breakfast program, along with Warwick Teece, whose Openline program was a huge success. General Manager David Baldwin was a key part of the station&#x27;s revival, guiding the team to the top of the ratings. The coverage of the 1989 Newcastle earthquake by the news team, led by Tony Briscoe, won the station a National Radio Award. The 1990s saw 2HD confirm its place as the top-rating station in Newcastle, led by the breakfast team of David Collins and Tanya Wilks, who notched up over eight consecutive years of survey wins, supported by Geoff Jay and Richard King.

The station expanded following the purchase of local FM station New FM in 1995, which resulted in internal remodelling of the building. In 1999, the NSW Labor Party and NSW Labour Council sold the station to Bill Caralis.

In 1997, the station had added the &quot;John Laws Morning Show&quot; to its line-up, which remained until Laws&#x27; departure from 2UE in 2007. He was replaced by Steve Price and, later, Steve Liebmann, until Laws moved to network station 2SM in 2011, and was syndicated to rest of the Super Radio Network.

Until 2006, the station broadcast coverage of Newcastle Knights National Rugby League (NRL) games, then syndicated from the Macquarie Radio Network. However, a dispute between BOG, the Macquarie Radio Network and the NRL saw both the Continuous Call Team and the coverage of Knights games go to rival 102.9 KOFM.

In 2018, A-League, Super Rugby, NRL and AFL returned to 2HD, with various games called live through the network partnership with Crocmedia.

On 14 May 2021, 2HD recorded its lowest ratings result in its history, recording a percentage of 6.6.

<text>is a railway station on Kintetsu Minami Osaka Line in Abeno-ku, Osaka, Japan. The station is also called &quot;Abenobashi Station&quot; (あべの橋駅).

According to the research on November 13, 2012, 159,075 passengers got on and off trains at Ōsaka Abenobashi Station. It was the largest number of passengers getting on and off trains at stations on the Kintetsu Lines.

The west ticket gates of the station were shifted 35 m to the east on March 20, 2009, so that station facilities are entirely within the Kintetsu Abeno department store&#x27;s &quot;new&quot; (east) building. The &quot;old&quot; (western) portion was demolished to make way for a new high-rise building.

<doc id="1245250" wikidata="Q7986919" url="?curid=1245250" title="West Virginia State University">
<text>West Virginia State University (WVSU) is a public historically black, land-grant university in Institute, West Virginia, United States. Founded in 1891 as the West Virginia Colored Institute. It is one of the original 19 land-grant colleges and universities established by the second Morrill Act of 1890, which evolved as a diverse and inclusive campus. Following desegregation, WVSU&#x27;s student population slowly became more white than black. As of 2017, WVSU&#x27;s student body was 75% white and only 8% African-American.

The university&#x27;s Gus R. Douglass Land-Grant Institute is divided into three programmatic divisions: WVSU Extension Service, WVSU Agricultural and Environmental Research Station, and The Center for the Advancement of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (CASTEM). The WVSU Extension Service (1890 Extension) provides community and agricultural outreach throughout West Virginia via 4-H Youth Development, Agriculture and Natural Resources, Community and Economic Development, and Family and Consumer Sciences programs. The WVSU Agricultural and Environmental Research Station (1890 Research) focuses on Aquaculture, Environmental Microbiology &amp; Biotechnology, Horticultural Crops &amp; Production Systems, Urban Forestry &amp; Natural Resource Management, and Vegetable Genomics &amp; Plant Breeding research programs. CASTEM programs encourage the state&#x27;s youth to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network (STEM) fields to become engineers, scientists, researchers, teachers, and leaders.

==History==
WVSU is located on land once occupied by mound builder Native Americans. The British government granted the site to George Washington for his service in the British military during the French and Indian War. It was subsequently sold and operated as a plantation, using enslaved labor. Prior to 1830, [[Samuel I. Cabell], moved to the [[Kanawha River]] valley from Georgia and married [[Mary Barnes Cabell|Mary Barnes]], a former slave, who bore thirteen children. He bought the property in 1853 and much to the displeasure of their white neighbors, took elaborate precautions to ensure that Mary, his wife, and their children would inherit his wealth and not be sold into slavery, including officially emancipating Mary and their then-living children in 1858. Sam Cabell was murdered shortly after the [[American Civil War]] and the creation of the state of West Virginia. Two decades later, his daughter Maria Cabell-Hurt sold some land to the new state to permit creation of the &quot;West Virginia Colored Institute&quot;, since Sam&#x27;s descendants and neighbors had to send their children across the [[Ohio River]] to Ohio for higher education. Sam and Mary Cabell and their children are buried on the campus; some descendants continue to live nearby.

===Early history===
The school was established as the West Virginia Colored Institute in 1891 under the second [[Morrill Act]], which provided for [[land-grant university|land-grant institutions]] for [[African American|Black]] students in the 17 states that had segregated schools. The school opened its doors in May 1892 and had an enrollment of over 40 students. The faculty consisted of President [[James Edwin Campbell (poet)|James Edwin Campbell]], [[Byrd Prillerman]], and T.C. Friend. The curriculum consisted of courses in agriculture, horticulture, mechanical arts, and domestic science. Teacher education (&quot;normal&quot;) courses were added in 1893. Military education became an integral part of the school, and in 1899 West Virginia&#x27;s legislature passed a bill to admit up to 60 cadets. In 1909, African-American educator and statesman [[Booker T. Washington]] recommended his friend, [[Byrd Prillerman]], as the institution&#x27;s president. Washington had been instrumental in locating the institution in the [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha Valley]], visited the campus often, and spoke at its first commencement. During Prillerman&#x27;s 10-year administration, the school established itself as the center of black intellectual life in the state.

From 1891 through 1915, the school provided the equivalent of a high school education, with vocational training and teacher preparation for segregated public schools. In 1915, it became the West Virginia Collegiate Institute and began to offer college degrees. In 1919, [[John Warren Davis (college president)|John Warren Davis]] became president of the institute. A [[Morehouse College|Morehouse]] graduate, Davis recruited highly qualified faculty and focused on curriculum development. He persuaded noted historian [[Carter G. Woodson]] to assist him as academic dean. In 1927, the school was accredited by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]], making it the first of 17 original black land-grant schools to be certified by a regional association and one of only four black colleges to gain such status. It also became the first public college in West Virginia to be accredited by North Central. In 1929, the name was changed to West Virginia State College. With an enrollment of 1,000 students, the college contained divisions of Applied Arts and Sciences; Languages, Literature and Fine Arts; Natural Sciences and Mathematics; and Social Sciences and Philosophy.

In 1939, West Virginia State College became the first of six historically black colleges to be authorized by the [[Civil Aeronautics Authority]] to establish an aviation program. Benefiting from the presence of the Wertz Field airport adjacent to campus, the program prepared many African-American pilots for the U.S. Army Air Corps in [[World War II]]. Several college aviators joined the famed [[99th Fighter Squadron]] and [[332nd Fighter Group]] (the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]) that served with distinction in the [[European Theater]]. One of the original graduates of the aviation program, [[Rose Agnes Rolls Cousins]], was the first African-American woman to become a solo pilot in the Civilian Pilot Training Program. During World War II, West Virginia State College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a Navy commission. In 1942, a college [[ROTC]] program was established as an artillery unit. The ROTC tradition continues today, and the school has claimed 15 general officers who have graduated from West Virginia State, including Major General [[Charles C. Rogers]] and Major General [[Harvey D. Williams]]. In 1951 the Drain-Jordan Library opened, named in honor of librarian [[Leaonead Pack Drain-Bailey]] and Lawrence Victor Jordan.

===Desegregation===
West Virginia State College underwent a significant transformation under the guidance of President William J. L. Wallace. In 1954, following the &quot;[[Brown v. Board of Education]]&quot; order to desegregate public education, and the initiation of the [[G.I. Bill]], the college transformed into a predominantly [[White people|White]] institution. This garnered national attention. President Wallace hailed it as &quot;a tribute to the character and courage of the people of Kanawha Valley.&quot; As a result, West Virginia State adopted the motto &quot;A Living Laboratory of Human Relations.&quot; Enrollment substantially increased after the change in demographics.

In 1957, the school lost its land grant status because the West Virginia Board of Education voted to end the state funding needed to obtain matching federal land-grant aid. Although land-grant university funding is governed by federal laws, the federal aid is conditioned upon matching state funds. Under the leadership of President Hazo W. Carter, Jr., a 12-year quest was begun to restore the land-grant designation. The first step toward regaining the status came when Gov. [[Gaston Caperton]] signed a bill on Feb. 12, 1991, that had been passed by the Legislature to recognize the land-grant status on the state level. With the advocacy of alumni, university leadership, and assistance from West Virginia&#x27;s U.S. Senator [[Robert C. Byrd]], the U.S. Congress fully restored land-grant status in 2001. West Virginia State is again recognized as an 1890 land-grant institution with recognition at the Federal level, along with funding to carry out its mission of teaching, research, and public service. The land-grant institution of WVSU is named the Gus R. Douglass Land-Grant Institution.

===University status===
In 2003, the school&#x27;s [[community college]], established in 1953, was separately accredited as the West Virginia State Community and Technical College but remained administratively linked to West Virginia State College. In 2008, the legislature fully separated the community and technical college. However, both schools continued to share the same campus. In 2009, the Community and Technical College went through a name change and it was announced on April 20, 2009, as [[Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College]]. In the fall of 2012, KVCTC moved its campus to [[South Charleston, West Virginia]].

In 2004, under President Carter&#x27;s leadership, West Virginia State College gained University status, becoming West Virginia State University, and began to offer graduate degrees in Biotechnology and Media Studies. In the fall of 2011, WVSU began to offer a graduate degree in Law Enforcement. In the spring of 2014, WVSU began offering a graduate degree in education. Under President Brian O. Hemphill, the university set a goal to become the most student-centered research and teaching, land-grant university in West Virginia. Under President Anthony L. Jenkins, PhD, the university celebrated a historic achievement, receiving its full land-grant state match.

===Leadership===
After serving as interim president, Ericke S. Cage is the current and 13th president of the university, officially taking office in 2022. Past presidents of the university include: James Edwin Campbell (1892–94), [[John H. Hill]] (1894–98), [[James McHenry Jones]] (1898–1909), Byrd Prillerman (1909–19), John Warren Davis (1919–53), William J.L. Wallace (1953–73), Harold M. McNeill (1973–81), Thomas W. Cole, Jr. (1982–86), Hazo W. Carter, Jr. (1986–2012), Brian O&#x27;Harold Hemphill (2012–16), Anthony L. Jenkins (2016–20), and [[Nicole Pride]] (2020–21).
. Several buildings on campus are named after them: Campbell Conference Center, Hill Hall, Jones Hall, Prillerman Hall, Davis Fine Arts Building, Wallace Hall, McNeill Facilities Building, Cole Complex, and the Dr. Hazo W. Carter Jr. Integrated Research and Extension Building and the adjacent Dr. Hazo W. and Judge Phyllis H. Carter Food and Agricultural Complex.

James Edwin Campbell was a poet, free-lance writer, and mathematician from [[Pomeroy, Ohio]]. Following Campbell was John H. Hill, who was a lawyer, teacher, administrator, and soldier, who oversaw the university&#x27;s first commencement. He resigned to fight in the [[Spanish–American War]] and later returned as an instructor. James McHenry Jones was responsible for adding teacher education (a &quot;normal&quot; department), and is buried on campus. Before becoming the fourth president, Byrd Prillerman was a faculty member and one of those responsible for locating the school in the Kanawha Valley. During his tenure, academic programs were expanded and the institution was renamed the &quot;West Virginia Collegiate Institute&quot;. John Warren Davis focused on recruiting the best black faculty members he could find and developing the curriculum. He persuaded noted historian [[Carter G. Woodson]] to assist him as Academic Dean. During his tenure, the school was first accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1927, and became West Virginia State College in 1929. Davis is the longest-serving president, having served for thirty-four years.

William James Lord Wallace&#x27;s greatest challenge of his presidency came following the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 ruling, &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which declared segregated schools to be unconstitutional. Following that, the historically black West Virginia State College opened its doors to all students. Dr. Wallace not only met the challenge but set an example for the world to follow. During Harold M. McNeill&#x27;s tenure, the community college component was established; a building was erected for community college programs, and Ferrell Hall and the Drain-Jordan Library were renovated. During Thomas Winston Cole, Jr.&#x27;s administration, he made several organizational changes in the institution, creating new academic divisions and establishing a planning and advancement unit. Cole left West Virginia State in 1986 to become Chancellor of the West Virginia Board of Regents.

Shortly after he became the ninth president in September 1987, Dr. Hazo W. Carter, Jr. began a 12-year quest to regain the college&#x27;s land-grant status that had been transferred in the 1950s. Since &quot;State&quot; was the only institution to have the status removed, there was no precedent for recovering it. After this status was restored, a quest then began for West Virginia State to be designated a university, which became a reality in 2004; he became the first president to serve under the &quot;university&quot; status. These achievements, accompanied by two highly successful accreditation&#x27;s by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and the addition of graduate programs, highlight his administration. In August 2011, the faculty voted no confidence in Carter&#x27;s leadership, and Carter retired on June 30, 2012. He then became [[President Emeritus|president emeritus]] until his death in February 2014. Under the leadership of Dr. Anthony L. Jenkins, WVSU expanded its outreach and public service to all 55 counties throughout WV, increased academic program offerings to include Engineering and Nursing, increased retention and dual enrollment course offerings.

Just less than one year as president, Dr. [[Nicole Pride]], the university&#x27;s 12th president who was also the first female president of WVSU, resigned following controversy. Her cabinet called for her termination due to allegations of a hostile work environment under her leadership. A vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; was taken and the Board of Governors unanimously accepted her resignation letter.

===Other===
[[East Hall (Institute, West Virginia)|East Hall]] and the [[Canty House]], home of &quot;Colonel&quot; [[James M. Canty]], were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.

WVSU&#x27;s [[Autumn|Fall]] and [[Spring (season)|Spring]] [[Graduation|Commencement Ceremonies]] were held in December and May, respectively, at the [[Charleston Civic Center]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]]. Until 2009, WVSU and WVSCTC had joint commencement ceremonies. To cut back on spending, WVSU now holds its commencement ceremonies on campus. Until the completion of the new convocation center, the December commencement was held in the P.A. Williams Auditorium of Ferrell Hall, while the May commencement was either on the large lawn in the center of campus (also called the quad), or in the P.A. Williams Auditorium, pending weather. Commencements are now held in the D. Stephen and Diane H. Walker Convocation Center (Walker Convocation Center for short), a new addition/renovation to Fleming Hall. The Spring 2014 commencement was the first commencement held in the Walker Convocation Center.

==Student activities==
===Athletics===

The athletic teams are known as the Yellow Jackets. WVSU athletic teams include men&#x27;s football, baseball, basketball, golf, and tennis, and women&#x27;s basketball, golf, softball, tennis, volleyball and soccer. During the segregation era, the school competed in athletics as &quot;West Virginia&quot; and played other segregated schools as a member of the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association. After desegregation, the school withdrew from the CIAA (today&#x27;s [[Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]) and competed as &quot;West Virginia State&quot; to avoid confusion with [[West Virginia University]]. The school then moved to the formerly all-white [[West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (WVIAC), which competed in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]&#x27;s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]]. After the dissolution of the WVIAC, WVSU joined the new [[Mountain East Conference]] in 2013, which is also part of NCAA Division II. WVSU&#x27;s main rivals include [[University of Charleston]] (WV), [[Central State University]] (OH), and [[Kentucky State University]].

During the segregation era, black high schools were barred from competition in the [[West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission]], and State therefore sponsored an unofficial &quot;state colored championship&quot; from 1932 to 1959.

===Music===
WVSU&#x27;s Music Department is housed in the College of Arts and Humanities. Currently, WVSU offers two undergraduate degrees in music, a Bachelor of Science in Music Education and a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Music Performance, as well as a music minor.

====Instrumental ensembles====
In the mid-late 1990s, the band saw a period of resurgence under the direction of Chris Card. From 1995 until 2000, the band had an enrollment of between 35 and 50 members. Many of the members during this time period were scholarship recipients, and the band often contained 5-10 veterans or active members of Drum Corps International. The band was known for its small size and huge sound. The band marches in a &quot;corps-style&quot; fashion, the only band of its type at an HBCU, as most have a &quot;show-style&quot; band. The band tries to do a different marching show at every home football game, with the exception of homecoming.

The Yellow Jacket Marching Band, also known as the &quot;Marching Swarm&quot;, performs in one parade unless invited to others: the WVSU Homecoming Parade. In 2018, the band performed in [[Welch, West Virginia|Welch, WV]]&#x27;s 100th Veteran&#x27;s Day Parade, the longest ongoing Veteran&#x27;s Day parade in the nation. The band has also played for the president&#x27;s &quot;State of the University Address&quot;, the Founder&#x27;s Day ceremony, and annually for WVSU&#x27;s [[ROTC]] Hall of Fame Ceremony. They have served as the exhibition band at high school marching band festivals, including [[Nicholas County, West Virginia|Nicholas County&#x27;s]] Mountain Band Spectacular (2008–2010), [[Poca High School]]&#x27;s Heritage Day Festival in [[Poca, West Virginia|Poca]] (2009–2016, 2018), the 2013 WV Marching Band Invitational in Charleston, the 2015 [[Sissonville High School]] Cavalcade of Bands Band Festival in Sissonville, and the [[Boone County, West Virginia|Boone County]] Coal Classic, hosted by [[Scott High School (West Virginia)|Scott High School]] in [[Madison, West Virginia|Madison]] (2018–2019). On October 12, 2013, WVSU, in co-sponsorship with the [[St. Albans High School]] Music Department, hosted the Cavalcade of Bands Southwest Regional Band Festival, and hosted it again in 2014. In 2008, the band was invited to go to Chicago with the football team for the Chicago Football Classic to participate in the Battle of the Bands competition; the only competition the band has competed in.

The Wind Ensemble has performed at WVSU&#x27;s commencement ceremonies. Students of the Advanced Conducting studio may also conduct on a concert. The Advanced Conducting studio is a unique feature of WVSU as not many colleges offer it at the undergraduate level. In the spring of 2015, the Symphonic Wind Ensemble performed at [[Hamilton Crowne Plaza|The Hamilton]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the simultaneous events of D.C.&#x27;s 153rd [[Emancipation Day#District of Columbia – April 16|Emancipation Day]] Celebrations and the 150th Anniversary of [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Assassination]]. Established in fall 2015, WVSU offers a chamber orchestra, named the West Virginia State Philharmonic Orchestra (WVSPO, formerly Charleston Chamber Orchestra), under the baton of Dr. Scott E. Woodard. On their debut concert, the ensemble performed a world premiere of a piece by local composer Matthew Jackfert. In June 2018, the orchestra performed in [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]] as part of the Viennese Masters Orchestra Invitational, hosted by Music Celebrations International (MCI), followed by a performance at the [[Kennedy Center]] in D.C. in February 2019 for MCI&#x27;s Capital Orchestra Festival. The WVSPO were set to tour in [[Vienna]] as part of a [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] festival in the summer of 2020, also as part of MCI, but it was rescheduled to 2021 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; however, the 2021 date also fell through due to the ongoing pandemic.

The Jazz Ensemble performs for various events on and off campus. In November 2007, the Jazz Ensemble traveled to Austria to perform in [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]], [[Graz, Austria|Graz]], and [[Salzburg, Austria|Salzburg]]. On April 12 and 13, 2012, the Jazz Ensemble played two concerts for Washington, D.C.&#x27;s 150th Emancipation Day celebrations at the [[Lincoln Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Lincoln Theatre]]. The April 12 concert featured the WVSU Jazz Ensemble and saxophonist Brian Lenair, while the April 13th concert additionally featured a comedy show by famed comedian [[Dick Gregory]]. The Jazz Ensemble returned the following year to perform for the 151st Anniversary on April 16 at [[Freedom Plaza]]. The Jazz Ensemble, along with the Concert Choir, performed at [[The Greenbrier]] on November 22, 2013, as part of the West Virginia Reading Association (WVRA) conference. In March 2016, the ensemble performed for the West Virginia Music Educators Association (WVMEA) conference.

Other instrumental groups at WVSU include a Brass Ensemble, Guitar Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, and Woodwind Ensemble. In addition, WVSU is home to the Montclaire String Quartet, the Quartet in Residence at WVSU, composed of the principle string players of the [[West Virginia Symphony Orchestra]].

====Vocal ensembles====
In addition to the instrumental ensembles, WVSU features a concert choir called the State A Capella and an audition-only chamber vocal ensemble called State Singers. Depending on enrollment, vocal ensembles specifically for male and female groups may also be offered. The State Singers consists of eight to ten vocalists and also occasionally perform as the WVSU Vocal Jazz Choir. The State Singers act as ambassadors for the university and frequently perform off campus for important community and cultural events. Every spring, the State Singers go on tour. Recent tours have taken the group to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], [[Virginia Beach]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[New York City]]. On April 13 and 14, 2012, the concert choir had the unique opportunity of singing the music of &quot;[[Queen (band)|Queen]]&quot; with the [[West Virginia Symphony Orchestra]]. The concert choir again sang with the WVSO for the symphony&#x27;s 2012 holiday concerts, and have continued since. In March 2016, the concert choir again joined the symphony, along with three other West Virginia collegiate choirs, to perform the [[Brahms Requiem]]. Dr. Dirk Johnson is the Director of Choral Activities for WVSU and has been at that position since the fall of 2009. He is also the current Chair of the WVSU Department of Music.

===Student life===
Many of the students who live in dorms on campus are from large urban areas outside of West Virginia or from the rural counties in the state. Those who stay on campus generally congregate at Wilson Student Union.

===Student media===
The campus radio station at WVSU can be heard locally on 106.7 FM or over the internet. The station has hosted live music and interviews with recording artists. The campus newspaper, &quot;The Yellow Jacket,&quot; is published and edited by students and can be picked up in major buildings across the campus.

<doc id="1245251" wikidata="Q1348317" url="?curid=1245251" title="Yamantaka">
<text>Yamāntaka () or Vajrabhairava (; ; &quot;Daewideok-myeongwang&quot;; &quot;Daiitoku-myōō&quot;; &quot;Erlig-jin Jargagchi&quot;) is the &quot;destroyer of death&quot; deity of Vajrayana Buddhism. Sometimes he is conceptualized as &quot;conqueror of the lord of death&quot;. Of the several deities in the Buddhist pantheon named Yamāntaka, the most well known belongs to the Anuttarayoga class of tantra of deities popular within the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism.

==Etymology==
&quot;Yamāntaka&quot; is a Sanskrit name that can be broken down into two primary elements: &quot;Yama (यम)&quot;, –the god of death; and &quot;antaka&quot; (अन्तक) –destroyer. Thus, Yamāntaka means “Destroyer of Death” or &quot;Conqueror of Death&quot;.

While Yamāntaka is therefore Yama&#x27;s nemesis, his representation mirrors Yama in many ways: he too often rides a buffalo and is often depicted with a buffalo&#x27;s head.

Because of this mirroring of appearance and similarity in name, it is not hard to find texts and books (which would appear to be reliable sources of much material) conflate both Yamāntaka and Yama as being the same deity when they are not.

Within Buddhism, &quot;terminating death&quot; is a quality of all buddhas as they have stopped the cycle of rebirth, samsara. So Yamāntaka represents the goal of the Mahayana practitioner&#x27;s journey to enlightenment, or the journey itself: On final awakening, one manifests Yamāntaka – the ending of death.

== Origin ==
One historic source of name follows Kalantaka, an aspect of the Hindu god Shiva who saves his follower from the clutches of death Yama and is seen as the deity of adherence and origin of the Mahamrityunjaya Mantra of Buddhism and Hinduism.

In the buddhist Tantra, Siva as wrathful Bhairava, prefixing of the term “vajra” to his name—the preeminent symbol of power in the Buddhist tantra vehicle (Vajrayana)—is interpreted as a definitive sign of Bhairava’s wholesale transformation and conversion to Buddhism. The subjugation and conversion of non-Buddhist deities and the subsequent acquisition of the defeated deity’s special attributes is a common theme in Buddhist tantric literature.

Taranatha describes Yamāntaka is a wrathful expression of Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva of wisdom. However, the &quot;Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa&quot; describes Yamāntaka to be an emanation of Vajrapani. In Chinese Esoteric Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism, Yamāntaka is the wrathful emanation of Amitabha. He adopted this form in order to defeat Yama, the lord of death who was arrogantly interfering with karma by claiming victims before their time was up. Yamāntaka submitted Yama by terrorizing him with his form, one even more frightening than that of Yama himself, which at the same time also acted as mirror of Yama&#x27;s horrible appearance. Yama then repented his actions and became a guardian of dharma. Through this way, Mañjuśrī also exposed the illusory nature of the fear of death, as well as the unreality of death itself.

== Forms ==
Yamāntaka manifests in several different forms, one of which has six legs, six faces and six arms holding various weapons while sitting or standing on a water buffalo. The topmost face is the wrathful aspect of Mañjuśrī, with a red face below it. The other faces are yellow, dark blue, red, black, white, grey, and brown. Each face has three eyes.

The most common representation, Vajramahabhairava, depicts 9 heads, thirty-two hands and sixteen legs standing on Yama and all the Deva&#x27;s, and Asuras. Also, like Yama, he is represented with an erect penis, symbolizing the alchemy of bodily fluids.

In Chinese Esoteric Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism, Yamāntaka is pictured with six faces, legs and arms holding various weapons while sitting on a white ox.

<text>A mind machine (aka &quot;brain machine&quot; or &quot;light and sound machine&quot;) uses pulsing rhythmic sound, flashing light, or a combination of these. Mind machines can induce deep states of relaxation or concentration.

The process applied by some of these machines is said to induce brainwave synchronisation or entrainment.

==History==
The influence of rhythmic sounds and drums to enter altered states of consciousness is used in different indigenous tribes (see Shamanic music), as well as optical stimulation produced by the flickering light of camp fires or pressing lightly on the eyeballs. This &quot;stroboscopic photo-stimulation produces &#x27;photic driving&#x27;, the alpha type of brain electrical activity associated with an altered state in which people are susceptible to suggestion&quot;. ( p. 12).

The first scientific observations were made by William Charles Wells in the 1790s who described different effects of binocular vision. His results were later transferred to be applied in binaural beats. Visual experiments with flickering lights were conducted in the 1940s by William Grey Walter who used stroboscopic light flashes to measure their effects on brain activity, assessed with EEG. He reported effect not just on visual areas but on the whole cortex.

The development of alpha EEG feedback (see neurofeedback) is an important starting point for biofeedback and its explicit use for entering altered states of consciousness. Enterprises started to produce different types of mind machines and some scientists followed the line of research to explore if and how these devices elicit effects on brain processes.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s Farley initiated an investigation concerning medical claims made by some manufacturers and sellers. The FDA concluded that Light and Sound Machines were not medical devices and did not warrant regulation. Sellers and manufacturers were given guidelines for how they could advertise these devices, and were required to include a disclaimer and cautionary document with each machine.
Nowadays, mind machines are rediscovered by some teenage cultures as so called “digital drugs”, a legal way to enter altered states of consciousness.

== Application ==
Mind machines include flashing light devices, which are similar to the Brion Gysin dreamachine in that both produce a flickering visual field. Unlike flashing light devices, the dreamachine can be used by several people at once, but has few, if any, technical features.

=== Technical setting ===

Mind machines typically consist of a control unit, a pair of headphones and/or strobe light goggles. The unit controls the sessions and drives the LEDs in the goggles. Professionally, they are usually referred to as Auditory Visual Stimulation Devices (AVS devices). Some mind machines available today can even connect to the Internet to download additional session material.

===Regulation===

Mind machine devices are legally available throughout the United States from many sources.

With some exceptions, these devices commonly do not have FDA approval for medical applications in the US. They have been found by a U.S. district court to be Class III medical devices, and consequentially require FDA pre-market approval for all medical uses. One company making medical claims for a possibly unsafe device has been shut down and seen their devices destroyed.

<text>Parambassis is a genus of freshwater fish in the Asiatic glassfish family Ambassidae of order Perciformes. The type species is the Iridescent glassy perchlet (&quot;Ambassis apogonoides&quot;). These fishes originate mostly from Southeast Asia, but the species range across the Indomalayan and Australasian realms, from Pakistan, China and India south through Indonesia, New Guinea and Australia. Although primiarly found in fresh water, a few species can also be seen in brackish water. The &quot;Parambassis&quot; species range in maximum size from , but they are similar in appearance, with a lozenge-shaped form, typical perciform fins, and semitransparent or transparent body. Several of the species are common food fish in local markets, and some (most notably the Indian glassy perchlet) are kept as aquarium fish.

<text>Nils Waltersen Aasen (30 March 1878 – 27 December 1925) was a Norwegian arms inventor. He has been credited with having developed the modern hand grenade and land mine just prior to World War I.

==Biography==
Aasen was born at Stadsbygd in Rissa Municipality in Norway. He graduated in 1903 from the Fortress-Artillery School for Non-Commissioned Officers () at Oscarsborg Fortress. He started his experiments developing a hand grenade while serving as a sergeant at Oscarsborg. He was encouraged in his work by base commander and former defense minister Hans Georg Stang. However, the Norwegian Department of Defense showed little interest in Aasen&#x27;s prototype. He then formed Aasen&#x27;s Grenade Company (&quot;Det Aasenske Granatkompani&quot;) in Copenhagen, Denmark, which produced and exported of his grenade throughout Europe. Apart from new types of explosives, trench mortars, airplane bombs and land mines he also created several inventions for civil use. However, it was the development and production of arms that would bring him his greatest success.

Just prior to World War I, Aasen developed an anti-personnel mine which was meant as a weapon of deterrence. The invention caused enthusiasm within the French military but did not see production before the war. During World War I, Aasen was given the task of producing hand grenades for the French Army. He would have 13 factories with 13,000 employees working throughout the war. In 1917 his hand grenade was finally adopted by the Norwegian army, which later promoted him to premier-lieutenant (&quot;Løytnant&quot;).

Throughout his life he received a number of honorary degrees and awards for his inventions. Most notably, he was made an honorary colonel in the French Army, and a Knight in France&#x27;s Legion of Honour in 1915. Later, Aasen&#x27;s personal fortune was greatly reduced as a result of bad financial speculations, and because he had never patented the rights to several of his inventions. He died from tuberculosis in Stoughton, Wisconsin at the age of 47.

<text>Davis &amp; Elkins College (D&amp;E) is a private college in Elkins, West Virginia, United States. It operates as a nonprofit liberal arts college and is affiliated with the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities.

==History==
The school was founded in 1904 and is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church. It was named for Henry G. Davis and his son-in-law Stephen B. Elkins, who were both members of the United States Senate from West Virginia.

While the original campus was located in south Elkins, the current campus was established when Hallie Davis Elkins donated Halliehurst Mansion and the surrounding estate in 1924.

The &quot;Aurora&quot; literary magazine was founded at D&amp;E in 1963 (initially as the &quot;Adum&quot; magazine).

== Academics ==
D&amp;E offers 45 degree programs, including 33 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 6 associate&#x27;s degrees, and 6 pre-professional programs. Students can also choose from 36 minors and an honors program. 

The Morrison-Novakovic Center for Faith and Public Policy was founded at Davis &amp; Elkins College in 2017. The Center seeks to promote the common good by empowering students to engage, challenge, and enhance structures and conditions which lead to the flourishing of all people.

The college also has a supported learning program hosted by the Naylor Learning Center (NLC). The NLC provides academic support, courses, and workshops for all students, and it has additional services for students with learning disabilities. Other academic services are provided by the Booth Library and the Davis &amp; Elkins College Writing Center.

D&amp;E also hosts a range of regular speaker series, including the William E. Phipps Religion &amp; Philosophy Interdisciplinary Lecture and the Dr. Bill King Writer&#x27;s Week event. The Phipps lectureship brings accomplished scholars from a wide range of backgrounds to campus to discuss religion, philosophy, and related disciplines, while Writer&#x27;s Week is an endowed speaker series that hosts award-winning authors.

== Rankings and Enrollment ==
The college is number 15 among Regional Colleges South, according to US News rankings, and number 18 among Top Performers on Social Mobility.

The college enrolls 805 students, with a 12:1 student/faculty ratio.

==Athletics==
The school&#x27;s athletic teams, known as the Senators, compete in NCAA Division II, primarily in the Mountain East Conference (MEC). The Senators had been members of the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) from the league&#x27;s founding in 1924 until its demise in 2013, after which the school joined the Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC). In 2019, the Senators joined the MEC, thereby reuniting with most of their historic rivals.

Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis, indoor &amp; outdoor track, and wrestling. All of these sports compete in the MEC except for lacrosse, which remains in the G-MAC because the MEC sponsors that sport only for women. Women&#x27;s sports include triathlon, acrobatics &amp; tumbling, basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, indoor &amp; outdoor track, and volleyball. Acrobatics &amp; tumbling and triathlon, neither of which the MEC sponsors, compete as independents (without a conference affiliation).

==Campus==
D&amp;E&#x27;s main campus is located on a 180-acre area in Elkins, West Virginia. Part of the campus includes two historic mansions and accompanying buildings constructed between 1890 and 1924, as well as more modern buildings and dorms. The Davis &amp; Elkins College campus includes six national register historic landmarks, four of which also comprise a National Historic District. 

The college also owns the 300-acre George A. Myles Experimental Forest located outside of Beverly, West Virginia.

<text>Svatopluk I or Svätopluk I, also known as Svatopluk the Great, was a ruler of Great Moravia, which attained its maximum territorial expansion during his reign (870–871, 871–894).

Svatopluk&#x27;s career started in the 860s, when he governed a principality within Moravia, the location of which is still a matter of debate among historians, under the suzerainty of his uncle, Rastislav. In 870 Svatopluk dethroned Rastislav, who was a vassal of Louis the German, and betrayed him to the Franks. Within a year, however, the Franks also imprisoned Svatopluk. After the Moravians rebelled against the Franks, Svatopluk was released and led the rebels to victory over the invaders. Although he was obliged to pay tribute to East Francia under the peace treaty concluded at Forchheim (Germany) in 874, he was able to expand his territories outside the Franks&#x27; sphere of interest in the following years. His forces even invaded the March of Pannonia within East Francia in 882.

Svatopluk established a good relationship with the popes, and he and his people were formally taken under the protection of the Holy See in 880. Pope Stephen V even addressed him as &quot;King&quot; in a letter written in 885. Svatopluk seems to have wanted to appease the German clergy who opposed the conducting of the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic, and he expelled the disciples of Methodius from Moravia in 886, after their teacher&#x27;s death.

Svatopluk&#x27;s state was a loose assemblage of principalities and also included conquered territories.

Not long after his death Svatopluk&#x27;s realm of Great Moravia collapsed in the midst of a power struggle between his sons and the intensifying Hungarian raids.

Svatopluk, whose empire encompassed parts of the territory of modern Czech Republic (Moravia and Bohemia), Slovakia, Poland and Hungary, has occasionally been presented as a &quot;Slovak King&quot; in Slovak literary works since the 18th century, the period of the Slovak national awakening.

== Early years ==

The &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot; refer to Svatopluk as a nephew of Rastislav, the second known ruler of Great Moravia. Svatopluk was most probably born around 840. His father&#x27;s name was Svetimir, according to the late 12th-century &quot;Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja&quot;, a medieval historical work long dismissed as a collection of fact and fiction. According to the unproven later Moravian tradition of Tomáš Pešina z Čechorodu (17th century), who fulfilled the family tree of the House of Mojmír, Svatopluk was the son of a certain Bogislav. According to Simon of Kéza his father was Morot, a Prince of Poland who had subdued Bractari and occupied Crișana before retiring to Veszprém.

Svatopluk seems to have risen to power in Great Moravia in the early 860s. The &quot;Life of Methodius&quot; relates that Svatopluk and his uncle jointly asked the Byzantine Emperor Michael III to send missionaries who were familiar with the Slavic tongue to Moravia. Michael III chose two brothers, Cyril and Methodius, who were fluent in the dialect of Slavic spoken in the environs of Thessaloniki (Greece). They arrived in Moravia in 863, and immediately set to work teaching and preaching. Their translation of liturgical texts into Old Church Slavonic was approved by Pope Hadrian II in 867.

== Beginning of his reign ==
By the time Svatopluk first appeared in a Frankish sources (the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;) in 869, he was ruler of his own &quot;realm&quot; (&quot;regnum&quot;, implying autonomous or semi-autonomous land) within Great Moravia. This is generally accepted to be the Duchy of Nitra. His court was at &quot;Rastislav&#x27;s old city&quot; &quot;(urbs antique Rastizi)&quot;, which may have been either at Staré Město whose name literally means &quot;old city&quot; in Czech, or at Nitra (today in Slovakia), but it has also been identified with &quot;Sirmium&quot; (Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia).

Svatopluk&#x27;s &quot;realm&quot; was invaded and plundered in 869 by Bavarian troops led by Carloman, the eldest son of Louis the German, King of East Francia. At the same time Franconian and Alamannian troops attacked Rastislav&#x27;s territories under the leadership of the same King&#x27;s youngest son, Charles the Fat. Although the two armies soon returned, Svatopluk entered into clandestine negotiations with Carloman, and agreed to commend himself and his principality to Carloman.

Having learned of this agreement, Rastislav is said to have become furious and set a trap for his nephew, inviting him to a banquet where he intended to have him murdered. Svatopluk, however, was warned of his uncle&#x27;s plans, took Rastislav prisoner and handed him over to Carloman. Rastislav was sent to Bavaria under guard, while Carloman annexed his realm outright.

As a reward for capturing Rastislav, Carloman allowed Svatopluk to retain his principality, but the rest of Great Moravia was placed under the control of two Frankish lords, William and Engilschalk. Carloman&#x27;s forces also captured Methodius, whom Pope Hadrian II had earlier appointed Archbishop of &quot;Sirmium&quot; with jurisdiction over the realms ruled by Rastislav and Svatopluk. Early in 871 Carloman also imprisoned Svatopluk on unspecified charges of disloyalty, which may have been connected to the rebellion of Carloman&#x27;s younger brothers, Louis the Younger and Charles the Bald. Believing that Svatopluk was dead, the Moravians selected another member of their ruling family named Slavomír and made him their ruler.

== Towards the Peace of Forchheim ==

Carloman soon came to the conclusion that the accusations against Svatopluk were unfounded and released him from prison. In order to bind Svatopluk to his family, Carloman had Svatopluk stand as godfather to his illegitimate grandson. Thus this son of Carloman&#x27;s son Arnulf received the Moravian name Zwentibold.

Svatopluk also agreed to lead Carloman&#x27;s armies against Slavomír and the rebellious Moravians. However, on his arrival at &quot;Rastislav&#x27;s old city&quot;, Svatopluk betrayed the Bavarians and conspired secretly with the rebels. Although he captured the fortress in accordance with Carloman&#x27;s plan, once he was inside its walls he renounced his loyalty to Carloman, rallied a large Moravian force and launched a devastating surprise attack on the unsuspecting Bavarian army encamped outside. The Moravians took a great number of soldiers hostage, killed the rest and rid Moravia of the Frankish occupation. Carloman&#x27;s governors, William and Engelschalk, were also both slain, and Svatopluk became the undisputed ruler of Great Moravia.


In October 871 Louis the German sent Bavarian and Franconian troops against the Bohemians (Czechs). During the campaign the Franconians surprised a party of Moravians somewhere near the traps that guarded the narrow approaches to a Bohemian fort. The Moravians were returning to their homeland with the daughter of a Bohemian &quot;dux&quot; (&quot;duke&quot;), presumably to marry an unidentified Moravian magnate. Although the Moravians managed to reach the safety of the fort, they had to abandon 644 fully equipped horses in the narrows. The marriage of a Bohemian leader&#x27;s daughter to a Moravian magnate implies that Svatopluk was planning to form an alliance with the Bohemians.

Louis the German realized the grave threat posed by Svatopluk and assembled forces for a multipronged expedition with pincer movements advancing on Moravian territory from several directions in 872. One army was sent out &quot;against the Moravian Slavs&quot; from Regensburg (Germany) in May, but the Thuringian and Saxon soldiers fled in their first encounter with the enemy. The second army, composed of Franconians under Bishop Arn of Würzburg and Abbot Sigihard of Fulda, experienced mixed results: although their forces fought well, the majority of the men were killed, and only a handful of survivors returned to East Francia. Finally a third force, consisting of Bavarians and Carantanians under Carloman&#x27;s command, laid Moravian territories to waste, put Svatopluk&#x27;s army to flight and forced it to take refuge in an &quot;extremely well fortified stronghold&quot;. Svatopluk, however, soon assembled a large army and attacked the Bavarians who had been left behind under the command of Bishop Emriacho of Regensburg to guard ships on the bank of the river Danube.

In May 873, Pope John VIII moved energetically to discover the whereabouts of Methodius, who was still being held prisoner in Bavaria. He sent harshly worded letters to Carloman and the Bavarian bishops, and commanded Methodius&#x27;s immediate reinstatement. The Pope seems also to have brokered a lasting peace between Louis the German and Svatopluk. After his meeting with the Pope at Verona (Italy), Louis the German went to Forchheim where, according to the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, &quot;he received the legates of Svatopluk asking for a peace treaty&quot;. The exact terms of their agreement are not known, but it seems to have been a compromise: Svatopluk was forced to make an annual payment of tribute to Louis the German, who agreed to avoid any hostile acts against Great Moravia. Thus Methodius, who had in the meantime been allowed to return to Moravia, could continue his work in relatively peaceful conditions for some years.

== Years of expansion ==
Great Moravia underwent considerable expansion in the 870s. For instance, the &quot;Life of Methodius&quot; refers to the capture of &quot;a very powerful pagan prince settled on the Vistula&quot; in territory of later Poland, and a letter written around 900 by Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg states that Svatopluk conquered the region of Nitra, which had been thereto inhabited by pagans. Modern historiography, however, has tended to question the claims that huge neighboring territories were permanently annexed by Great Moravia. For instance, there is little clear archaeological or written evidence of a permanent extension of Moravian power in Lesser Poland or to the west in Silesia, or in Pannonia, as is suggested in earlier historical works.

Svatopluk&#x27;s expansionist policy was perhaps so successful because most of Western Europe was in the grip of unusually savage and large-scale Viking raids between 879 and 886. On the other hand, the &quot;Life of Methodius&quot; directly links Svatopluk&#x27;s military achievements and Methodius&#x27; work. For instance, according to his &quot;Life&quot;, Methodius promised Svatopluk that if the Prince would celebrate Saint Peter&#x27;s Day in the Archbishop&#x27;s church, &quot;God will soon deliver&quot; his enemies to him, and &quot;so it came to pass&quot;.

Nevertheless, at the court of Svatopluk, who himself professed the Latin Rite, intrigues against Methodius and the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic gathered strength. Svatopluk sent John of Venice, a known opponent of the Slavic liturgy, to Rome in 879 to achieve a settlement of ecclesiastical differences. In a letter addressed to Methodius in the same year, the Pope sharply rebuked him for using Slavonic in church services. Methodius, however, travelled to Rome in 880, together with a Moravian delegation. Under his influence Pope John VIII changed his mind and in a letter, known for its incipit, &quot;Industriae tuae&quot;, the Pope repeated that Mass was to be sung in Latin whenever requested, but he also allowed the use of Slavonic liturgy. The letter also confirmed the decision taken by the Holy See during Rastislav&#x27;s reign to create an archdiocese for Great Moravia. Upon Svatopluk&#x27;s request the Pope promoted a German priest, Wiching, to be Bishop of Nitra, but he added that the new Bishop and all the clerics in Great Moravia were expected to be obedient to Methodius, who remained the head of the church in Svatopluk&#x27;s realms.

== The &quot;Wilhelminer War&quot; ==

At the time when Charles the Fat became the sole ruler of East Francia in 881, the sons of Wilhelm and Engelschalk, the one-time commanders of the Bavarian forces occupying Moravia in 870–871, began to conspire with various Bavarian magnates in order to eject Arbo, the margrave Louis the German had appointed to command a key part of East Francia&#x27;s frontier on the Danube. Arbo, however, appealed for and received help from both Charles the Fat and Svatopluk, and even handed his son over to the latter as a hostage.

Upon Arbo&#x27;s request, Svatopluk, who remembered &quot;how much evil he along with his people had suffered&quot; at the hands of Wilhelm and Engelschalk, attacked their sons. His forces soon captured Engelschalk&#x27;s second son who was mutilated at Svatopluk&#x27;s order. Thereafter the remaining sons withdrew from the authority of Charles the Fat and become the men of Carloman&#x27;s son, Arnulf, who was ruling in Pannonia at that time. Learning of this, Svatopluk sent ambassadors to Arnulf, demanding that the sons of Wilhelm and Engelschalk be immediately sent away. Arnulf, however, refused to hand them over, to which Svatopluk responded with further invasions. In addition to the Franks and Moravians, the Bulgarians also entered the conflict by invading Svatopluk&#x27;s realm. According to a record in the &quot;Annals of Salzburg&quot;, the region of Vienna (Austria) was also invaded in 881 by Hungarians. They seem to have been hired either by Svatopluk or by Arnulf in order to intervene in their conflict.

Thus the &quot;Willhelminer War&quot;, that was to last until 884, led to the devastation of Pannonia east of the river Rába. Finally, Charles the Fat himself turned up and received Svatopluk as his man at Kaumberg (Germany), receiving promises of peace and fidelity. Svatopluk also promised never to invade Charles the Fat&#x27;s realm with a hostile force as long as he lived, while Charles the Fat recognized him as a prince of his realm. Peace between Arnulf and Svatopluk, however, was only sealed in the latter part of the following year.

== Last years ==

Methodius, who seems to have been in Svatopluk&#x27;s train at Kaumberg, died in 885. In his last days he had indicated Gorazd, one of his Moravian disciples, as most worthy to succeed him. Gorazd, however, did not or could not immediately submit his candidature for ratification of the Holy See, because Bishop Wiching of Nitra soon hurried to Rome. He persuaded Pope Stephen V that Methodius had ignored Pope John VIII&#x27;s orders in the matter of Slavonic liturgy, and thus, upon his initiative, the pope prohibited the Slavonic liturgy in Moravia. The pope also sent a letter &quot;(Quia te zelo)&quot; to Svatopluk, urging him to accept the addition of &quot;filioque&quot; to the Creed and to give up such peculiar Byzantine practices as fasting on Saturday.

Wiching having arrived back from Rome, Svatopluk summoned Gorazd, Clement and Methodius&#x27;s other disciples to submit to the papal directions. When they refused to do so, Svatopluk gave Wiching a free hand to take action against them. Some of them were first thrown into prison, and soon expelled from Moravia, while others, among them Naum, were sold as slaves. The expulsion of Methodius&#x27;s disciples from Moravia signaled the end of the Slavonic liturgy in Central Europe. The exiles, however, subsequently found refuge in the First Bulgarian Empire where they were able to carry on their work. Saint Clement of Ochrid said:

In his letter &quot;Quia te zelo&quot;, the pope addressed Svatopluk as &quot;rex Sclavorum&quot; (&quot;king of the Slavs&quot;). Although Svatopluk&#x27;s royal title was not recognized by the contemporary &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, the chronicler Regino of Prüm also referred to Svatopluk as &quot;rex Marahensium Sclavorum&quot; (&quot;king of the Moravian Slavs&quot;) in the early 10th century, which is independent evidence confirming that Svatopluk held the title of king. According to the late 12th-century &quot;Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja&quot;, Svatopluk had been crowned &quot;king in the Roman fashion on the field of Dalma&quot; in the presence of a papal legate, cardinals, and bishops.

In 887 Arnulf, Svatopluk&#x27;s opponent in the &quot;Wilhelminer War&quot;, became the king of East Francia. They met at &quot;Omuntesperch&quot;, a locality that has yet not been identified, during the winter of 890. At the meeting Svatopluk transmitted to Arnulf a message from Pope Stephen V, urging the king to invade Italy to protect the Holy See. According to Regino of Prüm, the two monarchs also concluded an agreement, in which Arnulf ceded the &quot;ducatus&quot; of the Bohemians to Svatopluk.

Sometime during 891, according to the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, Arnulf sent an embassy led by margrave Arbo to Moravia in order to renew the peace. A letter written by the margrave soon announced that the legates were returning from Svatopluk and the Moravians who had agreed &quot;to give themselves in friendship&quot;. Svatopluk, however, broke his pledges, so Arnulf decided to invade Moravia in 891. First the king met with Braslav, the Slavic &quot;dux&quot; on the river Sava, then raised an army of Franconians, Bavarians and Alamanni, and also recruited Hungarians to join his campaign. In the late 10th century, Arnulf was accused by Ottonian authors of unleashing the Hungarians on Europe because of his desire to bring down Moravia.

Arnulf&#x27;s invasion started in July 892, but he failed to defeat Svatopluk. The war against Moravia seems to have continued until 894. This was the year of Svatopluk&#x27;s &quot;most unlucky death&quot;, according to the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, which implies that he met his end in some kind of mishap, the sort that occurs in war. The exact circumstances of Svatopluk&#x27;s death, however, are unknown.

Simon of Kéza recorded that he died in battle near Környe.

== Legacy ==

Following Svatopluk&#x27;s death, Great Moravia, which had achieved its maximum territorial extension, and exercised its greatest influence in his reign, ceased to be a political factor in Central Europe. Among the conquered peoples, the Czechs were the first to withdraw in 895. Although—at least, according to the testimony of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus—Svatopluk had made a deathbed request to his sons, Mojmir II of Moravia and Svatopluk II, that they remain united, after his death internal disagreements between them were fostered by Arnulf. Finally Moravia collapsed in the first decade of the 10th century due to the invasion of the Hungarians.

 According to Hungarian legends, the Hungarians purchased the country from Svatopluk in a symbolic act of exchange: they sent a white horse with saddler to Svatopluk in return for some earth, water and grass, supposed to represent his country itself. Svatopluk allegedly disavowed this &quot;contract&quot; and then drowned in the Danube in flight from the Hungarians. The legend, in fact, seems to merely describe a common pagan rite of concluding alliances which might refer to Svatopluk&#x27;s alliance with the Hungarians in 894.

Historian Ryszard Grzesik says that the ruler Menumorut, mentioned in the 13th-century chronicle Gesta Hungarorum was the &quot;personification&quot; of Svatopluk I of Moravia.

Nevertheless, in 1722 Michael Bencsik, a professor of Hungarian law at the University of Trnava, suggested that the nobility and the whole population of Trencsén county within the Kingdom of Hungary were &quot;the remnants of Svatopluk who sold his country to the Hungarians, and thus the Slovak people, into eternal serfdom&quot;. In response, Ján Baltazár Magin, the Roman Catholic pastor of Dubnica, wrote the oldest known defense of the Slovak nation in 1728. Next another Catholic priest, Juraj Fándly, completed a history in Latin entitled &quot;Compendiata historia gentis Slavae&quot; (&quot;A Brief History of the Slovak Nation&quot;) in which he depicted Moravia as a state of Slovaks and Svatopluk as their king. In 1833 the poet Ján Hollý published a poem entitled &quot;Svätopluk&quot;, the first of a series of epic poems dealing with the past of the Slovak people.

<text>The Liberal government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland that began in 1859 and ended in 1866 consisted of two ministries: the second Palmerston ministry and the second Russell ministry.

==History==

After the fall of the second of Lord Derby&#x27;s short-lived attempts at governments in 1859, Palmerston returned to power, this time in alliance with his former rival, the Earl Russell, in what is regarded as the first Liberal government. Palmerston remained as Prime Minister until his death in 1865, when Russell succeeded him. However, disunity within the party caused the fall of the government in the following year, and Lord Derby formed another Conservative ministry.

<doc id="1245298" wikidata="Q6105880" url="?curid=1245298" title="J. H. Hexter">
<text>Jack H. Hexter (May 25, 1910 – December 8, 1996) was an American historian, a specialist in Tudor and seventeenth century British history, and well known for his comments on historiography. Hexter was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

==Early career==
Jack Hexter was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and was awarded a BA by the University of Cincinnati in 1931. He received his MA (1933) and PhD (1937) from Harvard University. His research interests encompassed both political and intellectual history, as witnessed by his first two books, one a history of the parliamentary conflict leading up to the Civil War, and the other a nuanced textual interpretation of Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot;.

==Scholarship and historiography==
Hexter coined the term tunnel history.

Hexter&#x27;s scholarly reputation probably owes as much to his historiographical critiques as to his body of research. He is noted for his distinction between &quot;splitters&quot; and &quot;lumpers&quot; of historical material, and his 1975 attack on Christopher Hill (as a &quot;lumper&quot; of selectively read sources). More to Hexter&#x27;s fancy was the &quot;splitter&quot; who saw his responsibility to the full range of particulars and the ambiguity of historical sources. &quot;Lumping&quot; was the tendency that, according to Hexter, threatened to bind historians to overreaching generalizations, of which he suggested Marxism was the most typical and intellectually pernicious. Nonetheless, his essay appeared to argue that both tendencies (analysis and synthesis) were intellectually necessary.

==Storm over the gentry==

This attack continued from a position he had earlier assumed, in his response in the late 1950s to a debate between Lawrence Stone and Hugh Trevor-Roper. Stone, along with R.H. Tawney, explained the origins of the English Civil War by positing that an increasingly well-off and ambitious gentry had, over the course of many years, destabilized the English state in which power had traditionally been divided between the aristocracy and the king. Trevor-Roper inverted this theory, arguing that in fact the Civil War was caused in part by court gentry who had fallen on bad times.

Hexter&#x27;s contribution, puckishly titled &quot;The Storm over the Gentry&quot; and originally published in a popular magazine, contends that both theses are undermined by their authors&#x27; social determinism which causes them to overlook the ordinary business of the House of Commons. Hexter maintained that the overlooked group, the rural magnates, the wealthier of the country gentry, wielded the most influence in the House of Commons and had brought no real interest in revolution. To the contrary, their experience was in practical management and governance, and for the most part they did not act out of simple self-interest. The Civil War needs, therefore, to be seen as the story of how such solid, service-minded and economically comfortable men were persuaded to resist the King, and not as any particular group&#x27;s economically motivated power grab.

His ultimate self-definition was overtly, unabashedly, and often polemically whiggish. For Hexter, the English Civil War was to be seen as the defence of traditional English liberties against an aggressive Crown. This position contrasted in the 1970s with the revisionist views of Conrad Russell and others who disputed both the uniqueness of the English Civil War and its connection with ideas of liberty. However, inasmuch as the revisionists were also explicitly anti-Marxist, their stance owed a great deal to Hexter&#x27;s critiques. Russell in particular echoed Hexter&#x27;s emphasis on continuity in English political values, Hexter&#x27;s distinction between the Civil War and the subsequent Revolution, and Hexter&#x27;s belief that contingencies better explained the coming of the War, while rejecting Hexter&#x27;s view that Parliament was acting out of a clear-cut sense of constitutional obligation and embracing instead the view that religious conflicts and practical problems in the composite monarchy were more decisive.

Hexter in 1978 wrote a bitter historiographical review in which he attacked younger scholars for reducing the analysis of the Civil War to an essentially amoral struggle for power (socio-economic for the Marxists; religious, political and fiscal for the revisionists), which he argued was too dismissive of the intrinsic moral strength of Parliament&#x27;s position. He thus declared his preference for the 19th-century narrative by Samuel Rawson Gardiner over the new interpretation, and, true to form, even adopted an exaggerated Whig-style argument: that one should recognize and accept the principles of the Parliamentary rebels because these ideas about freedom were the very foundation for our modern sense of political liberty.

==Hexter on Braudel==
Another famous Hexterian intervention in historiography is his article &quot;Fernand Braudel and the Monde Braudellien&quot;, which can be seen as a more appreciative, temperate, and intellectually sophisticated antecedent to Hexter&#x27;s attack on Hill. Here, Hexter dissected Braudel&#x27;s vast &quot;geohistory&quot;, &quot;La Mediteranée&quot;, marvelling at the organization of the Annales School but pointing out the ironic tensions between the Annales&#x27; rigorous, collaborative, scientific institutional ethos and its leader&#x27;s passionate, highly personal, often factually inaccurate or poorly sourced book (for which much of the intellectual labor was carried out from memory while Braudel was in a prisoner-of-war camp). The article also reveals Hexter&#x27;s satirical touch, as, in its first section, Hexter mimics the quantitative bent of the Annales scholars, representing their output in a series of graphs and tables.

==Academic positions==
His most prominent academic positions were at Queens College of the City University of New York from 1938 until 1957, Washington University in St. Louis from 1957 until 1964, and at Yale University from 1964 to 1978, becoming Charles Stillé Professor. The Yale Center for Parliamentary History was founded in 1966 under his directorship. He then returned to Washington University, where he founded the Center for the History of Freedom, and was named John M. Olin Professor Emeritus of the History of Freedom at Washington University, retiring in 1990. In this stead, he served as the founder and editor of the Stanford University Press &quot;Making of Modern Freedom&quot; series of books.

==Family==
Hexter married uth Mullin in 1942; they had four children. He died of congestive heart failure in St. Louis, Missouri after suffering heart ailments for much of his adult life.

<text>The Visby lenses are a collection of lens-shaped manufactured objects made of rock crystal (quartz) found in several Viking graves on the island of Gotland, Sweden, and dating from the 11th or 12th century.

Some were in silver mounts with filigree, the mounting covering the back of the lens, and were probably used as jewellery; it has been suggested that the lenses themselves are much older than their mounts.

Some of the lenses can be seen at the Fornsal historical museum in Visby, while some are in the Swedish National Museum in Stockholm, and others have been lost.

== Discovery ==
Excavations at Fröjel on Gotland in 1999 discovered evidence of local manufacture of beads and lenses from rock crystal, with unworked pieces of crystal coexisting with partially finished beads and lenses. 

== Characteristics ==
The lenses are bi-aspheric and two of them have very good imaging properties. Their surface appears to be an oblate ellipse, while the surface nearest the eye approaches a parabola.

The best example of the lenses measures in diameter and has a thickness of at its centre, with an angular resolution of 25–30 μm.

It was reported by Otto Ahlström in 1950 that most have aspheric surfaces. The best of the lenses have low spherical aberration, indicating that their surface profile was optimized to improve image quality. Most of the lenses, however, do not show any sign of optimization and produce worse images than a simple spherical lens.

Prior to the Fröjel finds it had been suggested that the lenses were not produced by the Vikings, as there are hints that they were in fact produced in Byzantium or Eastern Europe. The Vikings of Gotland were known to have participated in trade networks that reached as far as Constantinople.

== Proposed uses ==

The Visby lenses provide evidence that sophisticated lens-making techniques were being used by artisans over 1,000 years ago, at a time when researchers had only just begun to explore the laws of refraction. According to Schmidt and his co-workers, it is clear that the artisans worked by trial and error, since the mathematics to calculate the best form for a lens were not discovered until several hundred years later. It has been suggested that the knowledge required to make such lenses was restricted to only a few people, and perhaps only one.

Various uses have been proposed for the lenses. They may have been used by artisans for magnification in fine work, as reading stones, or to start fires. Olaf Schmidt has speculated that they may have been used as part of a telescope.

<doc id="1245309" wikidata="Q7889749" url="?curid=1245309" title="United States Deputy Secretary of Commerce">
<text>The deputy secretary of commerce is a high-ranking position within the U.S. Department of Commerce. It was created on December 13, 1979, when President Jimmy Carter sent a letter to the U.S. Senate and nominated Luther H. Hodges Jr., who then currently held the title of under secretary of commerce. The deputy secretary serves as the department’s chief operating officer, with responsibility for the day-to-day management of its approximately $11.4 billion budget, 13 operating units, and 46,000 employees. In that capacity, the deputy secretary is also a member of the President’s Management Council. The most recent deputy secretary was Don Graves, who was sworn in on May 14, 2021 and resigned January 20, 2025.

==History==
The deputy secretary serves as the principal deputy of the secretary of commerce in all matters affecting the department and performs continuing and special duties as the secretary may assign including, as may be specified by the secretary, the exercise of policy direction and general supervision over operating units not placed under other Secretarial Officers or other Department officials. In addition, the deputy secretary acts as secretary if the secretary has died, resigned, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office of secretary.

Rebecca M. Blank was the deputy secretary of commerce until she stepped down on May 31, 2013. She was confirmed by unanimous consent by the U.S. Senate in March 2012. She had been serving as acting deputy secretary since November 18, 2010. She replaced Dennis F. Hightower, who was deputy secretary of commerce from August 2009 to August 2010.

Patrick D. Gallagher was appointed acting deputy secretary on June 1, 2013. Bruce H. Andrews was confirmed as the next deputy secretary on July 24, 2014.

<doc id="1245311" wikidata="Q424167" url="?curid=1245311" title="Finasteride">
<text>Finasteride, sold under the brand names Proscar and Propecia among others, is a medication used to treat pattern hair loss and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. It can also be used to treat excessive hair growth in women and as gender-affirming treatment in trans women. It is usually taken orally but there are topical formulations for patients with hair loss, designed to minimize systemic exposure by acting specifically on hair follicles.

Finasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor and therefore an antiandrogen. It works by decreasing the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by about 70%.

In addition to DHT, finasteride also inhibits the production of several anticonvulsant neurosteroids including allopregnanolone, androstanediol, and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone.
Adverse effects from finasteride are rare in men with already enlarged prostates; however, some men experience sexual dysfunction, depression, and breast enlargement. In some men, sexual dysfunction may persist after stopping the medication. It may also hide the early symptoms of certain forms of prostate cancer.
Finasteride was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1992. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 73rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==
Finasteride has been used for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate and for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) in men.

===Enlarged prostate===
Physicians sometimes prescribe finasteride for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, informally known as an enlarged prostate. Finasteride may improve the symptoms associated with BPH such as difficulty urinating, getting up during the night to urinate, hesitation at the start and end of urination, and decreased urinary flow.

The use of the drug showed significant sexual adverse effects such as erectile dysfunction and less sexual desire, in particular when obstructive symptoms due to an enlarged prostate were present.

===Scalp hair loss===
Finasteride is also used to treat male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) in men, a condition that develops in up to 80% of Caucasian men aged 70 and over. In the United States, finasteride and minoxidil are the only two FDA approved drugs for the treatment of male pattern hair loss as of 2017. Treatment with finasteride slows further hair loss and provides about 30% improvement in hair loss after six months of treatment, with effectiveness persisting as long as the drug is taken. 

Taking finasteride leads to a reduction in scalp and serum DHT levels; by lowering scalp levels of DHT, finasteride can maintain or increase the amount of terminal hairs in the anagen phase by inhibiting and sometimes reversing miniaturization of the hair follicle. Finasteride is most effective on the crown but can reduce hair loss in all areas of the scalp. Finasteride has also been tested for pattern hair loss in women; however, the results were no better than placebo. Finasteride is less effective in the treatment of scalp hair loss than dutasteride.

===Prostate cancer===
In males aged 55 years old and over finasteride decreases the risk of low-grade prostate cancer but may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer and has no effect on overall survival.

A 2010 review found a 25% reduction in the risk of prostate cancer with 5α-reductase inhibitor. A follow-up study of the Medicare claims of participants in a 10-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial suggests the reduction in prostate cancer is maintained even after discontinuation of treatment. However, 5α-reductase inhibitors have been found to increase the risk of developing certain rare but aggressive forms of prostate cancer (27% risk increase), although not all studies have observed this. No impact of 5-α-reductase inhibitor on survival has been found in people with prostate cancer.

===Excessive hair growth===
Finasteride has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism (excessive facial and/or body hair growth) in women. In a study of 89 women with hyperandrogenism due to persistent adrenarche syndrome, finasteride produced a 93% reduction in facial hirsutism and a 73% reduction of bodily hirsutism after 2 years of treatment. Other studies using finasteride for hirsutism have also found it to be effective.

===Transgender hormone therapy===
Finasteride is sometimes used in hormone replacement therapy for transgender women due to its antiandrogenic effects, in combination with a form of estrogen. However, little clinical research of finasteride use for this purpose has been conducted and evidence of safety or efficacy is limited. Moreover, caution has been recommended when prescribing finasteride to transgender women, as finasteride may be associated with side effects such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, symptoms that are particularly prevalent in the transgender population and others at high risk already.

==Adverse effects==

A 2010 Cochrane review of finasteride for BPH found that, in men with a weighted mean age of 62.4, adverse effects are rare in men with already enlarged prostates; &quot;nevertheless, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder, versus placebo.&quot; , fresh evidence suggested such effects, along with disturbed neurosteroid production, may persist after finasteride use is stopped.

Finasteride is contraindicated in pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration advises that donation of blood or plasma be deferred for at least one month after taking the last dose of finasteride.

The FDA has added a warning to 5α-reductase inhibitors concerning an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer, as the treatment of BPH lowers PSA (prostate-specific antigen), which could mask the development of prostate cancer. Although overall incidence of male breast cancer in clinical trials for finasteride 5 mg was not increased, there are post-marketing reports of breast cancer in association with its use, though available evidence does not provide clarity as to whether there is a causative relationship between finasteride and these cancers. A 2018 meta-analysis found no higher risk of breast cancer with 5α-reductase inhibitors. Some men develop gynecomastia (breast development or enlargement) following finasteride usage. The risk of gynecomastia with 5α-reductase inhibitors is low at about 1.5%. Depressive symptoms and suicidality have been reported.

===Sexual adverse effects===
Use of finasteride is associated with an increased risk of sexual dysfunction including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculatory dysfunction. Sexual adverse effects of finasteride and dutasteride have been linked to lower quality of life and ability to maintain an intimate relationship, and can cause stress in relationships.

The adverse effect profiles of finasteride are somewhat different for its indications of hair loss and BPH.

====Finasteride for androgenetic alopecia (hair loss in men)====
The most common adverse effects of finasteride taken for hair loss are a decrease in sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and a decrease in the amount of semen.

In addition, finasteride has been reported in case reports to cause sexual problems that persist after stopping the medication. A 2012 update to the FDA label noted reports of decreased sex drive, problems with ejaculation and difficulty achieving an erection which continued after stopping the medication. The update also referenced reports of testicular pain and &quot;male infertility and/or poor quality of semen.&quot;

==== Finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia ====
The most common adverse sexual effects of finasteride for BPH are: trouble getting or keeping an erection, decrease in sex drive, decreased volume of ejaculate, and ejaculation disorders.

A 2010 Cochrane review found that men taking finasteride for BPH (with a mean age of 62.4) are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction (ED), decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder for the first year of treatment. The rates became indistinguishable from placebo after 2–4 years and these side effects usually got better over time.

===Long-term===
Finasteride may cause persistent adverse sexual, neurological, and physical effects in a subset of men. A 2019 metastudy surveyed the literature on the reversibility of finasteride&#x27;s side effects. It identified three studies that demonstrated full reversibility of side effects and eleven that described patients with irreversible adverse events. The findings were most convincing in a retrospective review of about 12,000 patients that 1.4% of the cohort developed persistent ED (ED lasting longer than 90 days post-withdrawal).

== Post-finasteride syndrome ==
Reports of long-term, post-discontinuation adverse effects in some fraction of former finasteride users have led to a proposed post-finasteride syndrome (PFS), although some within the medical community question whether there is enough evidence to support a causal relationship between finasteride usage and PFS.

Individuals claiming to experience PFS report sexual, neurological, hormonal, and psychological side effects that persist for an extended period after stopping the drug. Reported symptoms include penile atrophy and tissue changes, decreased ejaculate volume and quality, reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of penile sensitivity, decreased orgasm sensation, dry skin, metabolic changes, muscle and strength loss, gynecomastia, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, anhedonia, concentration problems, memory impairment and suicidal ideation. A meta-analysis found a significant association between finasteride use and post-discontinuation depression, suicidal ideation, and sexual dysfunction, but the quality of evidence was limited.

The status of PFS as a legitimate and distinct medical pathology remains a subject of debate. A 2019 editorial in &quot;The BMJ&quot; called post-finasteride syndrome &quot;ill defined and controversial&quot;. Some have argued that it has common features with other self-diagnosed &quot;mystery syndromes&quot; such as Morgellons or multiple chemical sensitivity, while others, including some in the biomedical research community, have concluded based on the available evidence, that it represents a real and serious condition. There is no known underlying biological mechanism for the proposed syndrome, and its incidence is unclear. A lack of clear diagnostic criteria and the variable reporting fraction in different healthcare settings make the problem challenging to evaluate.

As of 2016, Merck was a defendant in approximately 1,370 product liability lawsuits which had been filed by customers alleging they have experienced persistent sexual side effects following cessation of treatment with finasteride. Most cases were settled by 2018 when Merck paid a lump sum of US$4.3 million to be distributed. , 25 cases remained outstanding in the United States. In 2019, Reuters reported that faulty redactions in court documents revealed allegations from plaintiffs that Merck had known of persistent side effects in their original clinical trials but chose not to disclose them in warning labels.

==Overdose==
Finasteride has been studied in humans at single doses of up to 400 mg and at continuous dosages of up to 80 mg/day for three months, without adverse effects observed. There is no specific recommended antidote for finasteride overdose.

==Interactions==
No significant drug interactions have been observed between finasteride and a limited selection of medications.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Finasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor. It is specifically a selective inhibitor of the type II and III isoforms of the enzyme. By inhibiting these two isozymes of 5α-reductase, finasteride reduces the formation of the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from its precursor testosterone in certain tissues in the body such as the prostate gland, skin, and hair follicles. As such, finasteride is a type of antiandrogen, or more specifically, an androgen synthesis inhibitor. However, some authors do not define finasteride as an &quot;antiandrogen,&quot; a term which can refer more specifically to antagonists of the androgen receptor.

Finasteride results in a decrease of circulating DHT levels by about 65–70% with an oral dosage of 5 mg/day and of DHT levels in the prostate gland by up to 80–90% with an oral dosage of 1 or 5 mg/day. In parallel, circulating levels of testosterone increase by approximately 10%, while local concentrations of testosterone in the prostate gland increase by about 7-fold and local testosterone levels in hair follicles increase by around 27–53%. An oral dosage of finasteride of only 0.2 mg/day has been found to achieve near-maximal suppression of DHT levels (68.6% for 0.2 mg/day relative to 72.2% for 5 mg/day). Finasteride does not completely suppress DHT production because it lacks significant inhibitory effects on the 5α-reductase type I isoenzyme, with more than 100-fold less inhibitory potency for type I as compared to type II ( = 313 nM and 11 nM, respectively). This is in contrast to inhibitors of all three isoenzymes of 5α-reductase like dutasteride, which can reduce DHT levels in the entire body by more than 99%. In addition to inhibiting 5α-reductase, finasteride has also been found to competitively inhibit 5β-reductase (AKR1D1). However, its affinity for the enzyme is substantially less than for 5α-reductase (an order of magnitude less than for 5α-reductase &quot;type I&quot;) and hence is unlikely to be of clinical significance.

As of 2012, the tissues in which the different isozymes of 5α-reductase are expressed are not fully clear. This is because different investigators have obtained varying results with different reagents, methods, and tissues examined. However, the different isozymes of 5α-reductase appear to be widely expressed, with notable tissues including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, testes, epididymides, skin, hair follicles, liver, kidneys, and brain, among others.

By inhibiting 5α-reductase and thus preventing DHT production, finasteride reduces androgen signaling in tissues like the prostate gland and the scalp. In the prostate, this reduces prostate volume, which improves BPH and reduces the risk of prostate cancer. Finasteride reduces prostate volume by 20 to 30% in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Inhibition of 5α-reductase also reduces epididymal weight, and decreases motility and normal morphology of spermatozoa in the epididymis.

Neurosteroids like 3α-androstanediol (derived from DHT) and allopregnanolone (derived from progesterone) activate the GABAA receptor in the brain; because finasteride prevents the formation of neurosteroids, it functions as a neurosteroidogenesis inhibitor and may contribute to a reduction of GABAA activity. Reduction of GABAA receptor activation by these neurosteroids has been implicated in depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction.

In accordance with finasteride being a potent 5α-reductase inhibitor but a weak inhibitor of 5β-reductase, the medication decreases circulating levels of 5α-reduced steroids like allopregnanolone but does not reduce concentrations of 5β-reduced steroids like pregnanolone. Pregnanolone acts as a potent GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator similarly to allopregnanolone.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The mean oral bioavailability of finasteride is approximately 65%. The absorption of finasteride is not affected by food. At steady-state with 1 mg/day finasteride, mean peak concentrations of finasteride were 9.2 ng/mL (25 nmol/L). Conversely, following a single 5 mg dose of finasteride, mean peak levels of finasteride were 37 ng/mL (99 nmol/L), and plasma concentrations increased by 47–54% following 2.5 weeks of continued daily administration. The volume of distribution of finasteride is 76 L. Its plasma protein binding is 90%. The drug has been found to cross the blood–brain barrier, whereas levels in semen were found to be undetectable.

Finasteride is extensively metabolized in the liver, first by hydroxylation via CYP3A4 and then by aldehyde dehydrogenase. It has two major metabolites, which are the &quot;tert&quot;-butyl side chain monohydroxylated and monocarboxylic acid metabolites. These metabolites show approximately 20% of the inhibitory activity of finasteride on 5α-reductase. Hence, the metabolites of finasteride are not particularly active. The drug has a terminal half-life of 5 to 6 hours in adult men (18–60 years of age) and a terminal half-life of 8 hours or more in elderly men (more than 70 years of age). It is eliminated as its metabolites 57% in the feces and 40% in the urine.

==Chemistry==
Finasteride, also known as 17β-(&quot;N&quot;-tert-butylcarbamoyl)-4-aza-5α-androst-1-en-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and 4-azasteroid. It is an analogue of androgen steroid hormones like testosterone and DHT. As an unconjugated steroid, finasteride is a highly lipophilic compound.

==History==
In 1942, James Hamilton observed that prepubertal castration prevents the later development of male pattern baldness in mature men. In 1974, Julianne Imperato-McGinley of Cornell Medical College in New York attended a conference on birth defects. She reported on a group of intersex children in the Caribbean who appeared sexually ambiguous at birth, and were initially raised as girls, but then grew external male genitalia and other masculine characteristic after onset of puberty. These children, despite being raised as girls until puberty, were generally heterosexual and were termed &quot;Guevedoces&quot; by their local community, which means &quot;penis at twelve&quot; in Spanish. Her research group found these children shared a genetic mutation, causing deficiency of the 5α-reductase enzyme and male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which was found to have been the etiology behind abnormalities in male sexual development. Upon maturation, these individuals were observed to have smaller prostates which were underdeveloped, and were also observed to lack incidence of male pattern baldness.

In 1975, copies of Imperato-McGinley&#x27;s presentation were seen by P. Roy Vagelos, who was then serving as Merck&#x27;s basic research chief. He was intrigued by the notion that decreased levels of DHT led to the development of smaller prostates. Dr. Vagelos then sought to create a drug that could mimic the condition found in these children to treat older men who had benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Finasteride was developed by Merck under the code name MK-906. A team led by chemist Gary Rasmusson and biologist Jerry Brooks developed potential 5α-reductase inhibitors based on transition-state inhibitors, using an iterative process of molecular design, testing, and redesign. In 1992, finasteride (5 mg) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of BPH, which Merck marketed under the brand name Proscar. Rasmusson and Brooks were awarded IPO&#x27;s &quot;Inventor of the Year&quot; award in 1993 for their work on finasteride. In 1997, Merck was successful in obtaining FDA approval for a second indication of finasteride (1 mg) for treatment of male pattern hair loss, which was marketed under the brand name Propecia. It was the first 5α-reductase inhibitor to be introduced and was followed by dutasteride in 2001. The first study of finasteride in the treatment of hirsutism in women was published in 1994.

==Society and culture==

===Generic names===
&quot;Finasteride&quot; is the generic name of the drug and its , , , and , while &quot;finastéride&quot; is its . It is also known by its former developmental code names &quot;MK-906&quot;, &quot;YM-152&quot;, and &quot;L-652,931&quot;.

===Brand names===
Finasteride is marketed primarily under the brand names Propecia, for pattern hair loss, and Proscar, for BPH, both of which are products of Merck &amp; Co. There is 1 mg of finasteride in Propecia and 5 mg in Proscar. Merck&#x27;s patent on finasteride for the treatment of BPH expired in June 2006. Merck was awarded a separate patent for the use of finasteride to treat pattern hair loss and it expired in November 2013. Finasteride is also marketed under a variety of other brand names throughout the world.

===Athletics===
From 2005 to 2009, the World Anti-Doping Agency banned finasteride because it was discovered that the drug could be used to mask steroid abuse. It was removed from the list effective 1 January 2009, after improvements in testing methods made the ban unnecessary. Athletes who used finasteride and were banned from international competition include skeleton racer Zach Lund, bobsledder Sebastien Gattuso, footballer Romário, and ice hockey goaltender José Théodore.

===Miscellaneous===
The US Food and Drug Administration advises that donation of blood or plasma be deferred for at least one month after taking the last dose of finasteride. The UK also has a one-month deferral period.

==Research==
Preliminary research suggests that topical finasteride may be effective in the treatment of pattern hair loss. Topical finasteride, like the oral preparation, reduces serum DHT.

DHT may be involved in the cause of acne, and 5α-reductase inhibitors might be effective in the treatment of the condition. A small retrospective study reported that finasteride was effective in the treatment of acne in women with normal testosterone levels. A randomized controlled trial found that finasteride was less effective than flutamide or an ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate birth control pill in the treatment of acne in women with high androgen levels.

Androgens and estrogens may be involved in the cause of hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa). Two case series have reported that finasteride is effective in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa in girls and women.

Finasteride and other antiandrogens might be useful in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder, but more research is needed.

<text>Belem is a three-masted barque from France.
She made her maiden voyage as a cargo ship in 1896, transporting sugar from the West Indies, cocoa, and coffee from Brazil and French Guiana to Nantes, France.

== History ==
&quot;Belem&quot; escaped the eruption of Mount Pelée in Saint-Pierre, Martinique, on 8 May 1902. On arriving at Saint Pierre ahead of the eruption, Captain Julien Chauvelon found that roadsteads were full of vessels. With no place to anchor the ship Chauvelon angrily decided to anchor some miles further away off a beach, which provided shelter when the volcano erupted.

She was sold in 1914 to Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster, who converted her to his private luxurious pleasure yacht, complete with two auxiliary Bolinder Diesel engines of 300 HP each.

In 1922 she became the property of Sir Ernest Guinness, of the Guinness family, who renamed her the Fantôme II and revised the rig from a square rigger. Guinness was Rear Commodore of the Royal St. George Yacht Club, in Kingstown, Ireland, from 1921 to 1939. He was Vice Commodore from 1940 to 1948. He took the &quot;Fântome II&quot; on a cruise in 1923 with his daughters Aileen, Maureen, and Oonagh. They sailed around the world via the Panama and Suez Canals including a visit to Spitsbergen. During her approach to Yokohama harbour while sailing the Pacific Ocean the barque managed to escape another catastrophe - an earthquake which destroyed the harbour and parts of Yokohama city. Guinness died in 1949. The &quot;Fântome II&quot; was moored in the roads of Cowes, Isle of Wight.
In 1951 she was sold to the industrialist Vittorio Cini, who named her the Giorgio Cini after his son, who had died in a plane crash near Cannes on 31 August 1949 . She was rigged to a barkentine and used as a sail training ship until 1965, when she was considered too old for further use and was moored at the Island of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice.

In 1972 the Italian carabinieri attempted to restore her to the original barque rig. When this proved too expensive, she became the property of the shipyard. In 1976 the ship was re-rigged to a barque.

Finally, in January 1979, she came back to her home port as the &quot;Belem&quot; under tow by a French seagoing tug, flying the French flag after 65 years. Fully restored to her original condition, she began a new career as a sail training ship.

On 8 and 9 May 2024, she carried the Olympic flame for the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics torch relay by sailing from Athens, Greece to Marseille.

<doc id="1245320" wikidata="Q7146461" url="?curid=1245320" title="Patrick F. McManus">
<text>Patrick Francis McManus (August 25, 1933 – April 11, 2018) was an American educator and humor writer, who primarily wrote about the outdoors. A humor columnist and editor for &quot;Outdoor Life&quot; from 1983 to 2009, and &quot;Field &amp; Stream&quot; from 1977 to 1982, as well as other magazines, his columns and stories have been collected in several books, beginning with &quot;A Fine and Pleasant Misery&quot; (1978) up through &quot;The Good Samaritan Strikes Again&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Horse in My Garage and Other Stories&quot; (2012).

==Biography==
McManus was born and raised in Sandpoint, Idaho. His father, who served in the 42nd (&quot;Rainbow&quot;) Division under Douglas MacArthur during World War I, died when Patrick was six. Although his mother later remarried a man named Hank, for the most part he was raised by his mother, grandmother, and older sister Patricia McManus Gass (referred to in his childhood stories as &quot;the Troll&quot;). His family didn&#x27;t have much money and lived on a small farm on the banks of Sand Creek where they grew most of their own food. They had chickens, a milk cow and pigs and went hunting and fishing.

After graduating from Sandpoint High School in 1952, McManus worked construction and other such jobs until he had saved enough money to attend Washington State College, now Washington State University, where he majored in journalism. He briefly worked as a news reporter before returning to graduate school at Washington State University where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1959. From 1960 to 1983 he taught English, journalism and creative writing at Eastern Washington State College, now Eastern Washington University.

He was married to Darlene &quot;Bun&quot; McManus and had four daughters.

==Works==
McManus wrote mostly about his outdoor adventures from his childhood with semi-fictional characters such as his old woodsman mentor Rancid Crabtree, his childhood friends Crazy Eddie Muldoon and Retch Sweeney, and his dog Strange. The stories&#x27; humor is mostly based on elaborate exaggerations of his surreal adventures in the outdoors. McManus&#x27;s writing is characterized by a dry wit that has been compared to the writing styles of Mark Twain and Robert Benchley.

His last published work was &quot;Circles in the Snow&quot; (2014), the sixth in a series of mystery novels starring the character Sheriff Bo Tully. Other departures from his column-collections include &quot;Kid Camping from Aaaaiii! To Zip&quot; (1979), an alphabetized, and partially serious, listing of useful tips and concepts for beginning campers; &quot;Whatchagot Stew&quot; (1989), both a cookbook and a less-fictionalized memoir of his childhood; and &quot;The Deer on a Bicycle&quot; (2000), a discussion of the art of humor writing.

McManus also wrote five separate, distinct one-man comedies for his indentured actor, Tim Behrens. Tim has toured these shows to 21 states and two provinces in more than 1600 performances since 1992. They are: &quot;A Fine and Pleasant Misery&quot;; &quot;McManus In Love&quot;; &quot;Pot Luck&quot;; &quot;Poor Again...Dagnabbit!&quot;; and &quot;Scrambled McManus&quot;.

In October 2011, an index of his stories and novels titled &quot;Where&#x27;s the One About the Bobcat?&quot; was compiled and published by Lauren Ball, making it easy for readers to find their favorite stories.

==Recurring elements==
McManus&#x27; shorter works include a recurring cast of fictitious characters and running jokes, both from the stories set in his childhood and as an adult. The foremost among the childhood stories is his &quot;mentor&quot; Rancid Crabtree, a colorful woodsman who lives near Pat&#x27;s childhood home, who doesn&#x27;t bathe because he believes that soap and water would wash off his &#x27;crust&#x27;, which would let germs in. Other recurring characters are his childhood best friend, &#x27;Crazy Eddie&#x27; Muldoon, his rough-and-tumble mutt appropriately named Strange, and his adulthood friends, the goofy and dim-witted Retch Sweeney, his straitlaced neighbor, Alphonse &#x27;Al&#x27; Finley, and his rich friend Fenton Quagmire. Throughout the majority of the stories is a recurring theme of McManus&#x27;s lifelong love of hunting and fishing—which is mostly an excuse to just enjoy the outdoors, often in good company. Most of his friends likewise enjoy hunting and fishing, even if they aren&#x27;t particularly &quot;good&quot; at it. McManus, in his stories, has a certain amount of disgruntlement for people who take great pleasure in the minutiae of various sports (such as encyclopediac knowledge of firearms calibers and ballistics). He refers to firearms enthusiasts as &#x27;gun nuts&#x27; and treats their excited sharing of the fine points of ballistic arcs and grain sizes as something to be endured to get on a good hunting trip.

Some of the elements show up in his longer works, and are even worked into the plots. Bo Tully, the protagonist of the Bo Tully Mysteries, shares McManus&#x27; views about firearms. In the course of his job as Sheriff and his hobbies, Tully uses guns, knows about guns, but isn&#x27;t particularly excited by them or even sentimental towards them. He is, however, aware that many people are. This even serves as plot point in one of the Bo Tully mysteries.

<text>Bedstone is a small village and civil parish in south Shropshire, England, close to the border with Herefordshire.

The village is approximately from the railway stations at Hopton Heath and Bucknell and is situated just off the B4367 road.

==Bedstone College==
Bedstone College, an independent boarding and day school founded in 1948, was purchased in 2017 by London &amp; Oxford Group, an asset management and investment banking firm specialising in introduction of Chinese investment to the UK Education sector. LOG has reportedly made little or no governance changes to the school and &quot;giving its full support to the current management team at Bedstone.&quot; Famous former pupils include the present Astronomer Royal, Sir Martin Rees (whose parents founded the school), now Baron Rees of Ludlow, and explorer and TV presenter Monty Halls. The current head is Toby Mullins.

Educating around 220 day and boarding students, the College is not selective and does not require pupils to sit an entrance exam. It offers a broad curriculum from reception through to A Level. Physical education and extra-curricular activities are an integral part of the school week, which includes Saturday-morning lessons and five afternoons set aside for sports and a choice of activities.

There are four boarding houses:
* Bedstone House - for junior girls
* Wilson House - for senior girls
* Rutter House - for junior boys
* Pearson House - for senior boys
Each is run by houseparents who are typically academic staff and their families.

Its campus houses the notable country house that is Bedstone Court. Its founders include the parents of Sir Martin Rees. On GCSE results, the College is the second best non-selective school in Shropshire and the sixth overall. 

In 2025, Bedstone College announced plans to close, following changes to the VAT regime for independent schools.

==Norman Origin==
St Mary&#x27;s church dates back to Norman times and features an original Norman font, a timber framed bellcote and a shingled spire, and some of the houses, which include several thatched cottages, are more than 600 years old.

==Buildings==

Manor Farm house is an example of a timber-framed house and was partly stone-faced in 1775. Bedstone Court, now the home of Bedstone College, is a more flamboyant black-and-white mansion, built between 1882 and 1884, designed by Thomas Harris for Henry Ripley, MP and is a calendar house reputed to have 365 windows, 52 rooms (on the first two floors) twelve chimneys and seven external doors. The central hall has a magnificent 52-panelled stained-glass window depicting the months of the year, signs of the zodiac, birds associated with the month and the agricultural activity of the month.

The building was heavily damaged by a fire in 1996 but was fully restored and continues to be the centrepiece of Bedstone College: the independent co-educational boarding and day school for pupils from 4 to 18.

==Amenities==
Until the 2000s there was a post office but now there is just a Royal Mail post box in the hamlet.

==Parish==
The civil parish covers a small area, with no other settlements than Bedstone itself. With a parish population of just 85 (in 2001), the parish council has now been merged with that of neighbouring Bucknell parish. In ecclesiastical terms, the church is linked with those of Hopton Castle and Clungunford.

<text>The Mersey Tunnels Police is a small, specialised, non-Home Office police force that provides policing services for the Mersey Tunnels in Merseyside, England. The force, which comprises fifty one officers from Constable to Chief Police Officer is responsible for effective road policing of the Mersey Tunnels, Approach Roads and Exit Roads. It is privately funded by Merseytravel which in turn reports to the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

==Role and powers==
Mersey Tunnels Police officers hold the office of constable and take their powers from section 105 of the County of Merseyside Act 1980. Unlike most police services in England and Wales, the service is answerable to the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive rather than the Home Office. The executive also appoints the service&#x27;s officers who are formally sworn in as police constables by a justice of the peace.
As of 2010 the service consisted of around 55 officers across the various ranks.

===Jurisdiction===
The service&#x27;s jurisdiction consists of the tunnels themselves, marshaling areas, entrance/exit roads and all Mersey Tunnels premises. Officers execute their duties in accordance with The Mersey Tunnels Bylaws. In some cases, officers may assist with high-urgency motorway incidents in the surrounding area where other patrols are further away.

The tunnels service have primary responsibility for these areas, meaning they enforce the Mersey Tunnels bylaws and like all other police services the various and relevant UK statute law/legislation although perhaps by the nature of the role primarily the Road Traffic Act. Mersey Tunnels Police officers are the first line responders to any incidents or emergencies within the tunnels or premises although certain incidents and enquiries of a serious nature may be dealt with by Merseyside Police in accordance with local agreements between the two services.

===History and strength===
Formed in January 1936 with two inspectors, four sergeants and 14 constables they undertook motorcycle patrols of the tunnels. The force grew to a maximum strength of one chief superintendent, one chief inspector, five inspectors, 15 sergeants and 60 constables.

As of January 2015, the establishment of the service consisted of 51 officers, divided amongst the following ranks: One chief officer, five inspectors, 10 sergeants and 35 constables. All new recruits are required to be serving or former police officers in another force; the force does not recruit direct from members of the public.

==Rank structure==
The ranks of the Mersey Tunnels Police consists of:

All officers have the &quot;powers of a constable&quot;, regardless of rank (see above for details).

==Uniform, training and equipment==

Mersey Tunnel Police officers wear a uniform similar to other police forces, but wear white-topped peaked caps, as traffic officers.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) include:

*Monadnock auto-lock baton
*Rigid handcuffs
*Stab vests
*Personal radios.

All officers are trained Police Level 4 Response Driving Standards, as MTP is a specialist traffic service. Training is done by MTP instructors and the Liverpool Cathedral Constables hold kit in their facility.

==Vehicles==

The service uses a small range of vehicles. The newest models bought in 2010 being the Land Rover Discovery IV (3 litre) and Ford S-Max. Additionally, the service has some older Ford Galaxy and Land Rover Discovery II models which are also planned to be replaced in the second half of 2010 with Ford and Land Rover Freelander vehicles.

As of 2023 the force have total of 11 police vehicles, 2 × BMW X3, 4 × Volvo V60, 2 × Volvo XC70, which has four-wheel drive capability. 2 × Land Rover Discovery IV, 1 × Mercedes Vito Cell Van,

==Media coverage==
Mersey Tunnels Police was heavily criticised by the Merseyside coroner for its handling of a pursuit in which two 14-year-old boys were killed in 2003 after crashing a stolen car into a roadblock set up by Mersey Tunnels officers. The coroner went so far as to recommend that either the policing of the tunnel should be altogether transferred to Merseyside Police, or tunnel officers should be trained to national policing standards.

All officers are now trained in Police Level 4 Response Driving Standards.

==Fallen officers==
The MTP has lost one officer in the line of duty:

*PC Derek McIntyre, struck and killed by a vehicle (10 November 1967).

<text>The Mersey Tunnels connect the city of Liverpool with Wirral, under the River Mersey. There are three tunnels: the Mersey Railway Tunnel, opened 1886, and two road tunnels, the Queensway Tunnel, opened 1934 and the Kingsway Tunnel, opened 1971. The railway tunnel and Queensway road tunnel connect central Liverpool with Birkenhead, while the Kingsway road tunnel runs to Wallasey.

The road tunnels are owned and operated by Merseytravel, and have their own police force, the Mersey Tunnels Police. In 1967 it was announced that the &quot;Mersey Tunnel Scheme&quot; was now operational. The scheme comprised what was claimed to be the largest closed circuit television system for traffic control outside North America, and featured a bank of 22 CRT monitors.

The Queensway Tunnel was used to film scenes for the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; from 2010. This provided Claire House children&#x27;s hospice in Wirral with a £20,000 windfall, the money being paid to Merseytravel by Warner Brothers, the makers of the film, for use of the Tunnel as a location.

In November 2012 scenes for the 2013 film &quot;Fast &amp; Furious 6&quot; were filmed in the Queensway Tunnel.

There is an annual 10k run that passes underneath the Mersey via the Kingsway Tunnel. This is the only time during the year when one can travel through the tunnel on foot. In 2024, more than 2,000 people registered to take part in the event.

<doc id="1245348" wikidata="Q1784910" url="?curid=1245348" title="2000 Major League Soccer season">
<text>The 2000 Major League Soccer season was the fifth season of Major League Soccer. It was also the 88th season of FIFA-sanctioned soccer in the United States, and the 22nd with a national first-division league.

The 2000 season marked the first time in league history (and the first season of American first division soccer since 1974), that ties were allowed to stand. Following a ten-minute sudden death extra time, rather than going to a penalty shoot-out, a point was awarded to both teams. Additionally, the league was divided into three separate divisions, the East, Central and West divisions.

The San Jose Clash rebranded as the Earthquakes, a throwback to the NASL team of the same name.

The regular season began on March 18, and concluded on September 9. The 2000 MLS Cup Playoffs began on September 14, and concluded with MLS Cup 2000 on October 15. The Kansas City Wizards won their first MLS Cup with a victory over the Chicago Fire.

==Overview==
===Season format===
The season began on March 18 and concluded with MLS Cup on October 15. The 12 teams were split into three divisions. Each team played 32 games that were evenly divided between home and away. Each team played every other team in their division four times, for a total of 12 games. The remaining schedule consisted of three games against four select opponents in one of the other divisions, and two games against the remaining four teams.

The eight teams with the most points qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs. The quarterfinals and semifinals were played as a best-of-three series, and the winners advanced to MLS Cup. In all rounds, draws were broken by penalty shootout if necessary. The away goals rule was not used in any round.

The team with the most points in the regular season was awarded the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield. The winner of MLS Cup, and the runner-up, qualified for the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.
