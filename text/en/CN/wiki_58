== History ==
===Foundation===
In the early 1990s with the rise of IT sector Prof. Lalith Gamage, who would eventually be the first president of SLIIT recognized the necessity of generating a substantial number of IT professionals in Sri Lanka to fulfill the increasing demand for such expertise. At the time, Prof. Gamage held the position of Senior Lecturer and was also the Director of the Computing Services Centre at the University of Moratuwa. He drafted a proposal for creating an institute of information technology within UoM and forwarded it to Hon. Kingsley T. Wickramaratne, who was the Minister of Internal and International Commerce and Food at that time. In June 1998, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education and the Ministry of Internal and International Commerce and Food jointly brought a proposal to the Cabinet to have the Malabe institute funded by the Mahapola Trust Fund and provided with land. The Chairman of the MTF, who was always the Chief Justice, was consulted on this matter. Although the Cabinet agreed to the project in principle, the Ministry of Finance expressed concerns about the lack of qualified academics to teach at the new institute and the financial burden it would place on the Consolidated Fund.

In 1999, Prof. Gamage requested a meeting with Mr. Wickramarathne, the Minister of Internal and International Commerce and Food, to discuss the creation of an institute. The meeting involved Ministry officials, professionals, and academics, and it was proposed to form a company limited by guarantee as an interim measure. This would allow for the project to move forward until cabinet approval was obtained, at which point the Government could take over the Institute and attach it to the University of Moratuwa.

=== Establishment of the Institute ===
Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology was established in 1999 at BOC Merchant tower, Colombo as a nonprofit company by guarantee with the ability to award Bachelor of Science degrees following amendments to the Universities Act the same year, thus gaining recognition from the Minister of Higher Education. SLIIT was established primarily to educate and train information technology professionals. SLIIT was established as an independent institution, as the initial guarantors did not represent any organization and the government or MTF did not have any ownership in it.

In September 1999, SLIIT commenced its operations by offering a two-year Diploma Programme at a leased space situated in its Colombo campus. The institute received a staggering 3,150 applications, out of which only 400 were granted admission.

===Expansion in to the Malabe Campus===
SLIIT approached the Mahapola Trust Fund to develop the Malabe Campus due to increasing demand for their programmes. Unlike before, this time SLIIT approached MTF as an independent entity rather than a part of UoM. In September 2000, MTF agreed to provide LKR 500 million for construction work and allocated the land in Malabe. Construction started the following year in 2001.

After a change in government in 2001, promised funding from the MTF for the construction of the Malabe Campus stopped abruptly, leaving the MD/CEO to finance the completion of the first phase with his own personal resources. Negotiations with the MTF eventually led to an agreement in 2005 for SLIIT to lease the land and operate independently as a separate legal entity. In exchange, SLIIT would provide board seats for MTF nominees and pay 20% of financial surpluses generated only from the Malabe Campus to the MTF. This agreement remained in effect until another change of government in 2015.

In 2015, the Mahapola Trust Fund requested to review and amend their agreement with the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), asking for the return of all funds originally contributed, including interest. SLIIT had invested over LKR 2 billion into the Malabe Campus between 2005 and 2015. A new agreement was signed in which SLIIT paid LKR 408.5 million to the MTF, which included the initial funding plus interest. The MTF renewed the lease of the land to SLIIT for 60 years, with a lease rental of LKR 20 million per annum, and increasing every five years up to LKR 45 million. The MTF withdrew its members from the board of SLIIT after receiving full payment. The ownership of the land remained with the MTF, and they earn lease rental income from it.

=== Further Expansion of the University ===
In 2007, SLIIT started expanding into new fields of study. These include electronic engineering and business management in collaboration with Sheffield Hallam University. SLIIT also expanded its presence from Colombo and its suburbs to other parts of the country, by establishing centres in Kandy and Matara, making SLIIT accessible in six locations.

In 2011, SLIIT established its Faculty of Business after it was accredited by the UGC to award Bachelor of Business Administration degrees in Human Capital Management, Accounting and Finance, Marketing Management, Quality management and Management Information Systems.

This was followed in 2012, with the establishment of the Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM). The project is a joint venture of SLIIT, Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM), and William Angliss Institute of Australia. It has been developed in line with international standards, housing a training kitchen, banqueting facility, training restaurant, model bedrooms, an IT training centre, and team rooms for students&#x27; practical training to prepare students for the degree of Bachelor of Tourism and Hospitality Management.

The Faculty of Engineering was formed in 2013, with it awarding its own Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees and master&#x27;s degrees from partner universities such as Curtin University and Sheffield Hallam University. The SLIIT Computing was established as a privately managed subsidiary of SLIIT in Kollupitiya to further expand undergraduate studies.

In 2015, SLIIT established its School of Architecture, offering a three-year degree in architecture. In 2016, introducing 16 new research-based degrees including PhD and MPhil degrees approved by the Ministry of Higher Education, Technology and Innovation of Sri Lanka.

In 2017, the Faculty of Humanities and Sciences was established as the newest division that provides the most extensive assortment of programs offered by any faculty on the campus. This faculty offers programs in diverse areas, including Biotechnology, Education, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, and Psychology.

<text>Charles Nathaniel Haskell (March 13, 1860 – July 5, 1933) was an American lawyer, oilman, and politician who was the first governor of Oklahoma. As a delegate to Oklahoma&#x27;s constitutional convention in 1906, he played a crucial role in drafting the Oklahoma Constitution and gaining Oklahoma&#x27;s admission into the United States as the 46th state in 1907. A prominent businessman in Muskogee, he helped the city grow in importance. He represented the city as a delegate in both the 1906 Oklahoma convention and an earlier convention in 1905 that was a failed attempt to create a U.S. state of Sequoyah.

During Oklahoma&#x27;s constitutional convention, Haskell succeeded in pushing for the inclusion of prohibition and blocking the inclusion of women&#x27;s suffrage in the Oklahoma Constitution. As governor, he was responsible for moving the state capital to Oklahoma City, establishing schools and state agencies, reforming the territorial prison system, and enforcing prohibition. The constitution prohibited persons from having successive terms in the governor&#x27;s office. Lee Cruce succeeded Haskell, who returned to his law practice and related business activities. Haskell died of a stroke in 1933.

==Early life and education==
Born in West Leipsic, Ohio on March 13, 1860, Charles Haskell was the son of George R. Haskell, a cooper, who died when the boy was three years old. His widowed mother, Jane H. Haskell ( Reeves), worked for the local Methodist church as a bell ringer and custodian to support her six children.

At the age of 10, Haskell started working as a farm boy for a farmer named Miller in Putnam County, Ohio. He lived and worked there for eight years as he grew into adulthood. Miller was a school teacher, but the young Haskell did not have time to attend school because of his work. Instead, Miller&#x27;s wife taught him at home, and Haskell earned a teaching certificate at age 17.

==Private career==
Haskell became a schoolteacher at age 18 and taught for three years in Putnam County. After &quot;reading the law&quot; as an apprentice with an established firm, on December 6, 1880, he passed the bar exam. He became a practicing attorney at age 20, setting up his practice in the village of Ottawa, Ohio. In his work as an attorney in Ottawa, he became one of the most successful lawyers in the county seat. He also became prominent in the Democratic Party in northwestern Ohio. In 1888, Haskell started work as a general contractor; for the next 16 years, his business career gave him an understanding of American industrialism. During this time, he lived part of the time in New York City and in San Antonio, Texas.

==Marriage and family==
Haskell married Lucie Pomeroy, daughter of a prominent Ottawa family, on October 11, 1881. Their children were Norman, who became a lawyer in Muskogee, Oklahoma (where the family moved in 1901); Murray, who worked as a bank cashier; and daughter Lucie.

Lucie Pomeroy Haskell died in March 1888. Her widower remarried in 1889, to Lillie Elizabeth Gallup. They also had three children together: Frances, Jane and Joseph.

==Move to Muskogee==
Following the Land Run of 1889 and passage of the Organic Act in 1890, migration of European Americans to Oklahoma Territory increased dramatically, raising the territory&#x27;s status on the national scene. Haskell moved his family to Muskogee, the capital of the Creek Nation, in March 1901. When he arrived, Haskell found Muskogee a &quot;dry&quot;, sleepy village of some 4,500 people. He built the first five-story business block in the town and in Indian Territory.

Haskell organized and built most of the railroads running into Muskogee. He is said to have built and owned 14 brick buildings in the city. Through his influence, Muskogee developed as a center of business and industry, and its population grew to more than 20,000 inhabitants. He often recounted that he hoped Muskogee would become the &quot;Queen City of the Southwest&quot;.

Haskell gained increasing influence in the politics of Indian Territory and drew the attention of the leaders of the Creek Nation. During this time, the Native American nations in Indian Territory were talking of creating a state and joining the Union under the name of the State of Sequoyah. The Creek selected Haskell as their official representative to the conventions, in the position of vice-president for the Five Civilized Tribes, held in Eufaula, Oklahoma in 1902 and Muskogee in 1905.

Of the six delegates at the Muskogee convention, only Haskell and William H. Murray were not of Native American descent. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt blocked the attempt to create Sequoyah, as he opposed the potential of another Democratic-majority state.

Haskell wrote a large portion of the proposed state&#x27;s constitution. Although he had publicly worked for a separate state for Indian Territory, privately, he was thrilled to see the Sequoyah proposal defeated. Haskell believed it would force the Indian leaders to join in statehood with Oklahoma Territory.

The United States Congress and President Roosevelt agreed that the Oklahoma and Indian territories had to combine to enter the Union as one state, the State of Oklahoma. After congressional passage of the Enabling Act in 1906, Haskell was elected as a delegate by the largest margin in the new state, representing the seventy-sixth district, which included Muskogee. Traveling to Guthrie and the Oklahoma Constitutional convention on November 20, 1906, Haskell would meet William H. Murray from the Muskogee convention and Robert L. Williams. Due to their presence at both conventions, Haskell and Murray became lifelong friends.

The delegates to the Guthrie convention included many who had served in the Sequoyah convention. Numerous elements proposed for the new constitution were based upon the Sequoyah constitution. Haskell owned the &quot;New State Tribune&quot;, and through its editorial columns advocated for the elements he wanted in the new constitution. Most were incorporated, in substance if not in form. While Murray served as the convention&#x27;s president, delegates recognized Haskell&#x27;s power in the body. A local newspaper during the time, the &quot;Guthrie Report&quot;, called Haskell &quot;the power behind the throne&quot;.

Haskell had a perfect attendance and voting record during the session. He advocated for provisions that affected both territories’ labor problems, and advocated for representatives of organized labor. Haskell also drafted a report drawing up county boundaries, led the crusade for state prohibition, introduced Jim Crow laws, as were prevalent among Southern states to restrict African Americans to second-class status; and successfully kept female suffrage out of the state constitution.

==Gubernatorial campaign==
At Tulsa on March 26, 1907, during the recess before the final adoption of the constitution by the convention, Haskell held a large Democratic Party banquet at the Brady Hotel, attended by between 500 and 600 of the leading Democrats of the new state. During this banquet, the first campaigns for governor were formally inaugurated. During this evening, his friends proposed Haskell for the Democratic gubernatorial candidacy. Among the other potential candidates were Thomas Doyle of Perry and Lee Cruce of Ardmore. Haskell, like other prominent Democrats at the time, had the strong support of labor and agriculture leaders.

The party primaries for governor were set for June 8, and Doyle and Cruce had already been campaigning; Haskell had little time. During his campaign, Haskell made 88 speeches in 45 days, and reached nearly every county. The lieutenants of the respective candidates were vigorously working in the school districts and securing support in every community. Haskell&#x27;s hard-working nature led him to win the Democratic nomination. Haskell won the Democratic primary by a more than 4,000-vote majority. Frank Frantz, the Republican territorial governor, was nominated as the Republican candidate at their caucus at Tulsa.

Frantz was a former Rough Rider and a friend of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who had appointed him. He was a very strong candidate for the Republican party. Haskell challenged Frantz to joint public discussions throughout the state; they discussed every problem facing administration of the new state during the campaign.

In addition, two nationally prominent figures spoke at various locations: Republican presidential nominee William Howard Taft and Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan. Taft&#x27;s disapproval of Oklahoma&#x27;s proposed constitution and his recommendation that the people vote against it seemed to increase support for the Democrats. Haskell won the gubernatorial race by more than 30,000 votes on September 17, 1907. On the same day, the voters ratified the new Oklahoma Constitution.

==Governor of Oklahoma==

On November 16, 1907, five minutes after it was known that Oklahoma had officially become a state, &quot;Guthrie Leader&quot; editor Leslie G. Niblack administered the oath of office to Haskell. The ceremony took place privately in Haskell&#x27;s hotel apartments in the presence of his immediate family, Robert Latham Owen, United States Senator-elect, and Thomas Owen of Muskogee, Haskell&#x27;s former political manager. Haskell&#x27;s inaugural address at Guthrie, delivered on the south steps of the Carnegie Library, quickly lifted him into national prominence.

Haskell&#x27;s old friends William H. Murray and Robert L. Williams also came into power with the state&#x27;s founding; with Murray as the state&#x27;s first Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives and Williams appointed, by Haskell, as the first Oklahoma Supreme Court chief justice. Haskell set the precedents for the use of executive power.

During the 1st Oklahoma Legislature, Haskell delivered a message creating a commission charged with sending a message to the U.S. Congress: amending the United States Constitution to provide for the election of U.S. senators by a direct vote of the people. Although it did not occur until after he left office, his efforts, as well as the works of the Progressive-era leaders, provided for the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1912.

Though Guthrie was the official capital of the state, Haskell set up his administration from Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City quickly grew in industry and prominence, with a booming population of 64,000, shadowing the smaller city of Guthrie, which was located just miles from the growing city. Haskell personally led the move to change the capital from Guthrie to Oklahoma City. First, he moved the official home of the Great Seal of Oklahoma and Oklahoma Constitution. Slowly, all government functions moved to the Oklahoma City area.

In the state legislature&#x27;s first session, under Haskell&#x27;s leadership, Oklahoma carried out various reforms including laws regulating banking in the state, while the old territorial prison system was reformed and the public protected from exploitative railroads, public utilities, trusts and monopolies. Haskell also initiated a law insuring deposits in case of a bank failure, a landmark piece of legislation in the nation. Haskell also rigidly enforced prohibition through the Alcohol Control Act. Though following progressive dogma at every turn, such as the introduction of child labor laws, factory inspection codes, safety codes for mines, health and sanitary laws, and employer&#x27;s liability for workers, Haskell&#x27;s legislative schedule also included Jim Crow laws for Oklahoma. Haskell&#x27;s other significant contributions while governor included establishing the Oklahoma Geological Survey, the Oklahoma School for the Blind, the Oklahoma College for Women and the Oklahoma State Department of Health. In addition, he helped to create the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in 1908. Haskell selected the first judges of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.

Prior to statehood, Kansas officials imprisoned individuals convicted of crimes in Oklahoma Territory. Oklahoma Commissioner of Charities and Corrections Kate Barnard, Oklahoma&#x27;s first female state official, visited the Kansas prisons and reported to Governor Haskell on the horrible conditions. In response, in 1908, Haskell pushed a bill through the state legislature that transferred 50 Oklahoma prisoners detained in the Kansas penitentiary at Lansing to McAlester, Oklahoma. When the Oklahoma state militia marched the prisoners down to McAlester, they found no prison. Under military supervision, the prisoners built Oklahoma State Penitentiary, the state&#x27;s first correctional facility (still in use today). The militia housed the prisoners in a tent city and were authorized by Haskell to use lethal force against any prisoner that tried to escape.

A grandfather clause was also enacted by the 2nd Oklahoma Legislature by the state&#x27;s Democratic leaders, effectively excluding blacks from voting. Haskell would spend the remainder of his term enforcing prohibition, regulation of railroads and other trusts, and the moving of the state capital to Oklahoma City. Haskell&#x27;s dream came true on June 11, 1910, when Oklahoma City became the state&#x27;s official capital.

Throughout his term as governor, Haskell remained free from corruption. Though he was the leader in the deliberations of the committee on county lines and county seats, when hundreds of towns had committees attending the sessions with heavy purses, he left these deliberations lean and poor, and by the time he retired from the governor&#x27;s office he had become utterly impoverished. In debate he ignored the graces of oratory and instead marshaled facts, arrayed statistics and piled up figures, using his cutting wit and grim humor to carry his point.

At the end of his term as governor in 1911, Haskell stepped down from the governorship, happy to see his 1907 Democratic primary challenger Lee Cruce inaugurated as the second governor of Oklahoma. In 1912, Haskell unsuccessfully challenged incumbent U.S. Senator Robert Latham Owen in a hard-fought Democratic primary for his U.S. Senate seat.

==National politics==
Not only a powerful figure in Oklahoma politics, Haskell&#x27;s progressive roots and populist nature granted him national clout. In 1908, Haskell headed the Oklahoma delegation to the National Democratic Convention at Denver where he was appointed treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. He was the spokesman for William Jennings Bryan in writing the platform of the convention. Two months later, he was forced to resign his treasurer position after allegations were leveled against him of taking illegal contributions from the Standard Oil Company. In 1920, he again headed the Oklahoma delegation at the National Convention, which in that year met at San Francisco, and was committed to and faithfully labored for United States Senator Robert Latham Owen, of Oklahoma, for the United States presidential nomination. Haskell would serve in this post two more times: a third in 1928 to the National Democratic Convention at Houston, and a fourth time in 1932 to the National Democratic Convention at Chicago.

At each convention and in his speeches and in articles appearing in the public press he disclosed an intimate understanding of the big money masters of America and ruthlessly exposed many of their venal practices and their corrupt usage of the public funds in their own interest to the detriment of the people.

==Later life, death and legacy==
Haskell entered the oil business after finishing his term as governor, a profession he would stay in until the end of his life. In 1933, Haskell suffered a major stroke, from which he would never recover. Three months later, Haskell would die from pneumonia. Haskell lost consciousness on July 4th that same year, and died the next day, in the Skirvin Hotel in Oklahoma City at the age of 73. He is buried in Muskogee, Oklahoma.

Charles Haskell Elementary in Edmond, Oklahoma, and Charles N. Haskell Middle School in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma are named in his honor. Haskell County, Oklahoma and the city of Haskell, Oklahoma are also named after him.

<text> ( ; ) is a mud adobe-built outdoor oven used by the Native Americans and the early settlers of North America. Originally introduced to the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors, it was quickly adopted and carried to all Spanish-occupied lands. The has a beehive shape and uses wood as the heat source. The procedure, still used in parts of New Mexico and Arizona, is to build a fire inside the and, when the proper amount of time has passed, remove the embers and ashes and insert the bread to be cooked. In the case of corn, the embers are doused with water and the corn is then inserted into the to be steam-cooked. When cooking meats, the oven is fired to a &quot;white hot&quot; temperature (approximately ), the coals are moved to the back of the oven, and the meats are placed inside. The smoke hole and door are sealed with mud. A twenty-one-pound turkey takes 2 to 3 hours to be cooked.

 is the usual Spanish word for &#x27;oven&#x27; or &#x27;furnace&#x27;, and is derived from the Latin word .

&quot;Young women must master the art of using the oven to bake piki, a tasty, delicate paper-thin bread made of cornmeal, before they are considered fit for marriage.&quot;

<text>The Descartes Prize was an annual award in science given by the European Union, named in honour of the French mathematician and philosopher, René Descartes.

The prizes recognized Outstanding Scientific and Technological Achievements Resulting from European Collaborative Research. The research prize was first awarded in 2000 and was discontinued in 2007.

The research prize was awarded to teams of researchers who had &quot;achieved outstanding scientific or technological results through collaborative research in any field of science, including the economic, social science and humanities.&quot; Nominations were submitted by the research teams themselves or by suitable national bodies.

A science communication prize was also started in 2004 as part of the Descartes Prize but in 2007 was separated to the Science Communication Prize.

Proposals (also referred to as submissions) received were judged and a shortlist of nominees were announced, from which five Laureates (finalists) and five Winners were announced at a prize ceremony in December each year.

==Laureates==
Where a project coordinator was named, only that person was included here and none of the team members who are also &quot;winners&quot; or &quot;laureates&quot;.

* was a 14-gun brig-sloop listed in 1782.
* was a 16-gun privateer that captured from the French on 16 March 1794; she foundered on 26 November, although all her crew were saved.
* was a 38-gun fifth rate launched in 1799. She was placed on harbour service in 1826, renamed HMS &quot;Argo&quot; in 1833, and was broken up in 1860.
* was a 36-gun fifth rate launched in 1845, becoming a training ship and being renamed HMS &quot;Tyne&quot; in 1867 and HMS &quot;Durham&quot; in 1867. She was sold in 1908.
* was a iron screw corvette launched in 1869 and sold in 1906.
* was an scout cruiser launched in 1911 and scrapped in 1920.
* was an destroyer launched in 1928 and broken up in 1947.
* was a Type 21 frigate launched in 1972. She was sold to the Pakistan Navy in 1994 and was renamed .

<text>Cagliostro-Walzer op.370 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II composed in 1875 based on themes from his operetta, Cagliostro in Wien which premiered on 27 February 1875 at the famous Theater an der Wien.

The waltz principal melody was based on the waltz duet &quot;Könnt&#x27; ich mit Ihnen fliegen durchs Leben&quot; or &#x27;Could I but fly with you through life&#x27; sung in Act 2 of the operetta. The operetta itself was a success at its first performance and Strauss long adopted the practice of opera composers to draft melodies from their successful stage works to be arranged as a new piece to boost sales of sheet music, thus he composed this &#x27;Cagliostro-Walzer&#x27;.

The entire waltz consists of just 3 two-part waltz sections which is also a new Strauss development from the previous 5 two-part sections heard in his earlier works. The piece began with a loud march melody in the C major key before progressing into waltz time. The principal waltz theme in C major is also in the style of The Blue Danube, where three notes in rising melody starts off the waltz proper. Waltz 2A carries the principal key in C major as well but quickly interpolates with a more thoughtful passage in E-flat major. Waltz 3A starts off in F major in a hesitant mood, proceeding into a climax with cymbals. A brief coda enters and the entire Waltz 2B is repeated. After a short chorded passage, the swirling Waltz 1A recurs and Strauss signs off the waltz with a strong chord and long snare-drumroll.

<doc id="1249770" wikidata="Q454948" url="?curid=1249770" title="Free Republic of Schwarzenberg">
<text>The Free Republic of Schwarzenberg () is a term applied to portions of western Saxony that were briefly not occupied by the Allies after the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945. These districts of Saxony were thus self-governing for several weeks before occupation under the Soviet Union. 

After the surrender of Nazi Germany, the Saxony districts of Schwarzenberg, Stollberg, and Aue in the Ore Mountains were left unoccupied by Allies for unknown reasons. This led to anti-fascist groups forming local governments in those towns and villages, ending with the area&#x27;s occupation by Soviet troops on June 24, 1945.

There has been speculation as to why neither American nor Soviet troops immediately occupied the area. One explanation is that the Soviets and Americans agreed to halt on the banks of the Mulde river. Because there are several rivers with this name, and the Schwarzenberg area lies between them, there may have been some misunderstanding over the agreed boundaries. Another possible explanation is that the Allies simply overlooked the area until the lack of occupation was noticed.

==Government and organisation==
The authority of the newly generated anti-fascist councils was still subject to democratic structures, though they were never intended to build a nation-state. The councils dealt with humanitarian issues since the unoccupied county of Schwarzenberg was not supported by any military force at the time. Issues the council dealt with included the maintenance of law and order, as well as dealing with scattered German soldiers fleeing west to avoid Soviet imprisonment.

After the Soviet occupation in June 1945, the councils were dismissed. However, their work was appreciated by the Soviets, and some councilmen kept their positions in similar Soviet-initiated councils for several years even after the German Democratic Republic was founded in 1949.

==Popular culture==

The name &quot;Free Republic of Schwarzenberg&quot; is derived from the 1984 novel &quot;Schwarzenberg&quot; by Stefan Heym. As the novel is based on actual events, the name has become a convenient descriptor, although the book is primarily a work of fiction rather than a historical record.

The Haus Schwarzenberg structure in Berlin is named after the Free Republic of Schwarzenberg. The place contains street art, galleries, shops, and a center named after diarist and Holocaust victim Anne Frank.

<doc id="1249771" wikidata="Q17152696" url="?curid=1249771" title="Helios (operating system)">
<text>Helios is a discontinued Unix-like operating system for parallel computers. It was developed and published by Perihelion Software. Its primary architecture is the Inmos Transputer. Helios&#x27; microkernel implements a distributed namespace and messaging protocol, through which services are accessed. A POSIX compatibility library enables the use of Unix application software, and the system provides most of the usual Unix utilities.

Work on Helios began in the autumn of 1986. Its success was limited by the commercial failure of the Transputer, and efforts to move to other architectures met with limited success. Perihelion ceased trading in 1998.

The name of the product was Helios. In the materials they produced, Perihelion Software never referred to the operating system as HeliOS.

== Development ==
In the early 1980s, Tim King joined MetaComCo from the University of Bath, bringing with him some rights to the TRIPOS operating system.
MetaComCo secured a contract from Commodore to work on AmigaOS, with the AmigaDOS component being derived from TRIPOS. In 1986, King left MetaComCo to found Perihelion Software, and began development of a parallel operating system, initially targeted at the INMOS Transputer series of processors. Helios extended TRIPOS&#x27; use of a light-weight message passing architecture to networked parallel machines.

Helios 1.0 was the first commercial release in the summer of 1988, followed by version 1.1 in autumn 1989, 1.1a in early 1990, 1.2 in December 1990 followed by 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 updates. Version 1.3 was a significant upgrade with numerous utility, library, server and driver improvements. The last commercial release was 1.3.1. Later Tim King and Nick Garnett gave permission to release the sources under the GNU General Public License v3. Helios 1.4 Alpha was planned to include support for OpenLook, OpenMotif, KDE, Gnome, and X11R6 support for the Transputer, Linux, Solaris, and Windows. This release was not completed.

== Kernel and nucleus ==
Helios was designed for a network of multiple nodes, connected by multiple high-bandwidth communications links. Nodes can be dedicated processing nodes, or processors with attached I/O devices. Small systems might consist of a host PC or workstation connected to a set of several processing nodes, while larger systems might have hundreds of processing nodes supported by dedicated nodes for storage, graphics, or user terminals.

A Helios network requires at least one &quot;I/O Server&quot; node that is able to provide a file system server, console server and reset control for the processing nodes. At power on, the Helios &quot;nucleus&quot; is bootstrapped from the I/O server into the network. Each node is booted using a small first-stage loader that then downloads and initialises the nucleus proper. Once running, a node communicates with its neighbours, booting them in turn, if required.

The Helios nucleus is composed of the kernel, libraries, loader service and the processor manager service.

=== Kernel ===
The Helios kernel is effectively a microkernel, providing a minimal abstraction above the hardware with most services implemented as non-privileged server processes. It provides memory allocation, process management, message passing and synchronisation primitives.

=== Libraries ===
The Helios nucleus contains three libraries: the system, server and utility libraries. The utility library provides some basic library routines for C programming that are shared by the other libraries. The system library provides the basic kernel interface, converting C function calls into messages sent to and from the kernel. It implements an abstraction that allows communication between processes regardless of their location in the network. The server library provides name space support functions for writing Helios servers, as described below.

=== Loader and processor manager ===
The remaining components of the nucleus are the loader and processor manager servers. Once the kernel is loaded, these processes are bootstrapped, and they integrate the newly running node into the Helios network.

== Naming and servers ==
A key feature in Helios is its distributed name system. A Helios network implements a single unified name space, with a virtual root node, optional virtual network structuring nodes, nodes for each processor, and sub-processor name spaces provided by services. Names are similar to those in Unix, using a forward slash separating character and textual naming elements.

The name space is managed by the &quot;network server&quot;, which is started by the I/O server once the nucleus is booted on its first attached node. The network server uses a provided network map to allocate processor names and initialise drivers for hardware devices at specific nodes in the network. The kernel includes a name resolver, and manages a local cache of routes to previously resolved names.

Servers are Helios processes that implement the &quot;General Server Protocol&quot;, typically with the support of the server library. The server protocol is conceptually similar to the Unix VFS API, and more closely to Plan 9&#x27;s 9P. It requires that servers represent their resources as files, with standardised open/read/write/close-style operations. Similar to facilities such as /proc in Plan 9 and other Unix-like operating systems, resources such as files, I/O devices, users, and processes are all represented as virtual files in the namespace served by their managing process.

Key servers in Helios are the previously mentioned loader, processor manager and network server, together with the session manager, the window server and the file server. Others include the keyboard, mouse, RS-232 and Centronics servers (built into the host I/O server), the null server (like Unix&#x27;s /dev/null), and the logger server (like Unix&#x27;s syslog).

== Programming and utilities ==
From a user&#x27;s perspective, Helios is quite similar to Unix. Most of the usual utility programs are provided, some with extensions to reflect the availability of multiple machines.

What is not immediately apparent is that Helios extends the notion of Unix pipes into a language called &quot;Component Distribution Language&quot; (CDL). In CDL, a typical Unix shell pipeline such as is called a &quot;task force&quot;, and is transparently distributed by the &quot;Task Force Manager&quot; server across the available CPUs. CDL extends traditional Unix syntax with additional operators for bi-directional pipes, sequential and parallel process farm operators, load balancing and resource management.

Helios applications can be written using C, C++, FORTRAN and Modula-2. The POSIX library assists in porting existing Unix software, and provides a familiar environment for programmers.

== Hardware ==
Helios was predominantly intended to be used with Transputer systems. It is compatible with products from various manufacturers including INMOS&#x27; TRAM systems, the Meiko CS, Parsytec MultiCluster and SuperCluster, and the Telmat T.Node. The Atari Transputer Workstation was perhaps the highest profile Helios hardware, at least outside academia.

Helios can run on T4xx and T8xx, 32-bit Transputers (but not the T2xx 16-bit models) and includes device drivers for various SCSI, Ethernet and graphics hardware from Inmos, Transtech, and others.

In its later versions, Helios was ported to the TI TMS320C40 DSP and to the ARM architecture, the latter used by the Active Book tablet device.

<text>The Battle of Pell&#x27;s Point (October 18, 1776), also known as the Battle of Pelham, was a skirmish fought between British and American troops during the New York and New Jersey campaign of the American Revolutionary War. The conflict took place in what is now part of Pelham Bay Park (namely the Split Rock Golf Course and Pelham Bay Golf Course) in the Bronx, New York City and the villages of Pelham Manor and Pelham in Westchester County, New York.

On October 12, British forces landed at Throgs Neck in order to execute a flanking maneuver that would trap Gen. George Washington, commander-in-chief of the American revolutionary forces, and the main body of the Continental Army on the island of Manhattan. The Americans thwarted the landing, and Gen. Sir William Howe, commander-in-chief of British forces in North America, looked for another location along Long Island Sound to disembark his troops. On October 18, he landed 4,000 men at Pelham, north of Throgs Neck. Inland were 750 men of a brigade under the command of the American Col. John Glover. Glover positioned his troops behind a series of stone walls and attacked the British advance units. As the British overran each position, the American troops fell back and reorganized behind the next wall. After several such attacks, the British broke off, and the Americans retreated.

The battle delayed British movements long enough for Washington to move the main army to White Plains and avoid being surrounded on Manhattan. After losing to the British in a battle at White Plains, and losing Fort Washington, Washington retreated across New Jersey to Pennsylvania.

==Background==

After a victory at the Battle of Long Island in late August, the commander-in-chief of British forces in North America, Gen. Sir William Howe landed his troops at Kip&#x27;s Bay, on the eastern shore of present-day Manhattan, on September 15. George Washington and his army retreated to Harlem Heights, a plateau situated on the north end of Manhattan Island. Washington was in a good defensive position, with his rear guarded on two sides by rocky heights and the Hudson and Harlem Rivers, and with more rocky heights to the south between his forces and the British. The next day, the British attacked the Americans and were defeated at the Battle of Harlem Heights. There was very little action for the next month, while the two forces remained in their fortified positions, each unable to decide upon their next move. The Americans believed Howe would either attack Fort Washington or attempt to flank the Americans with a landing at some point on Long Island Sound. A council-of-war decided to guard against both possibilities; Washington kept 10,000 men to defend Harlem Heights and Fort Washington, while Maj. Gen. William Heath took 10,000 troops to defend Kingsbridge, and Maj. Gen. Nathanael Greene was given 5,000 troops to defend the other side of the Hudson River, near Fort Constitution.

After 26 days of contemplation, Howe decided against a frontal attack on Harlem Heights and Fort Washington, and chose instead to attempt a flanking maneuver. On October 12, leaving behind three brigades under the command of Lord Hugh Percy on Manhattan Island, Howe embarked his main army in 80 vessels and proceeded up the East River, through Hell Gate, and landed at Throgs Neck. Throgs Neck—originally known as Throckmorton&#x27;s, and also known as Throck&#x27;s, Frog&#x27;s Neck, and Frog&#x27;s Point—is a narrow spit of land that sits between the East River and Long Island Sound. Conveniently for Howe, there was a road running from Throgs Neck to Kingsbridge, directly behind the American forces. Howe hoped to use this road to flank the Americans and pin them against the Hudson River.

Under the cover of fog, an advance force of 4,000 men under the command of General Henry Clinton was landed on Throgs Neck. To their dismay, they found they were not on a peninsula, but on an island, separated from the mainland by a creek and a marsh. There were two ways to get to the mainland: a causeway and bridge at the lower end, and a ford at the other. The Americans were guarding both. Col. Edward Hand and a detachment of 25 men from the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment positioned themselves behind a length of cordwood along the causeway, after having removed the planks of wood from the bridge. They surprised the British troops, who fell back and made an attempt to cross at the ford, which was guarded by another detachment. The Americans guarding both positions were quickly reinforced, and the defenders soon numbered over 1,800 men. Howe decided it would be better to retreat and land somewhere else. He made camp on Throgs Neck and remained there for six days while supplies and reinforcements, including 7,000 Hessian soldiers under the command of Gen. Wilhelm von Knyphausen, were brought up from New York. Just after midnight on October 18, Howe embarked his army again and decided to land at Pell&#x27;s Point near the town of Pelham, a few miles to the north.

After hearing of the landing on Throgs Neck, Washington knew he risked entrapment on Manhattan. He made the decision to move his army to White Plains, where he believed they would be safe. By October 17, the Continental Army was on its way to White Plains, leaving behind 2,000 men to garrison Fort Washington.

==Battle==

At dawn, the British began to land on the shore, Clinton&#x27;s advance guard of 4,000 British light infantry and Hessian jägers landing first. Inland, opposing them, was a brigade of some 750 men under the command of John Glover. Glover was atop a hill with a telescope when he noticed the British ships. (hill on the west side of the Hutchinson River Parkway and the Hutchinson River on East Sanford Blvd. In Mount Vernon, NY on the opposite side of the Hutchinson River Parkway and Pelham Memorial High School) Glover sent an officer, Major William Lee, to report to Charles Lee, Washington&#x27;s second in command, and ask for orders. However, Lee did not give any orders, and in the absence of orders Glover chose to attack. Glover turned out his brigade, which consisted of the 14th, 13th, 3rd and the 26th Continental Regiments. Glover left the 150 men of the 14th Continentals behind in reserve. Glover had not closed half the distance when he ran into approximately 30 skirmishers. Glover ordered a Captain and his 40-man company forward as an advance guard to hold the British in check, while Glover organized the rest of the force.

Glover prepared an ambush by placing the main body in staggered positions behind the stone walls that lined either side of the laneway leading from the beachhead to the interior. Glover instructed each of the regiments to hold their position as long as they could and then to fall back to a position in the rear, while the next unit took up the fighting. Glover then rode up to take command of the advance guard. The advance guard and the British began to engage each other, both sides taking casualties. After a little while the British were reinforced, and Glover ordered a retreat, which was done without confusion. The British troops began to advance at the retreating Americans. However, the 200 troops of the 13th Continentals that Glover had stationed behind the stone wall stood up and fired at the British when there were only 30 yards away. The ambush worked, and the column of British troops took heavy losses and fell back to the main body of the invading army.

The British waited half an hour before attacking again. This time when they attacked, they attacked with all 4,000 men and seven cannon. The British bombarded the American position behind the stone wall as their infantry advanced. The cannon fire was ineffective, and when the British were 50 yards away the Americans fired a volley which stopped the British infantry. The British returned fire, and musket and rifle fire ensued for 20 minutes, the British supported by cannon, at which point the lead American regiment fell back under cover of the next reserve regiment. The 3rd Continental Regiment was stationed behind the stone wall on the opposite side of the road.

The British attacked the position of the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued. Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began to overwhelm the Americans, and Glover ordered a withdrawal to another stone wall on the crest of a hill while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.

A reconnaissance party of 30 men was sent out from behind the third stone wall to see if the British would try and flank the American position. The party ran into the British, who had continued to advance, and they fell back to the stone wall. The Americans behind the wall fired one volley before Glover gave the order to retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British. Howe camped on a hill on the opposite side of the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream.

==Aftermath==

The next day, Glover and his force retreated to the town of Yonkers. American casualties were 8 killed and 13 wounded. British and Hessian casualties are not known. Howe&#x27;s official dispatch listed British casualties as 3 killed and 20 wounded, although the report did not include Hessian casualties. As the Hessians made up the majority of the landing force, it is reasonable to expect they made up the majority of the casualties. Over the next few days, from knowledge collected from British deserters, the Americans estimated that the British lost between 800 and 1,000 killed or wounded, likely an exaggeration. Colonel Loammi Baldwin, (an officer and fruit fancier whose fame came in the Baldwin apple) who was present at the battle, estimated that the Americans had killed 200 British and Hessians, but historian David McCullough says this was &quot;undoubtedly an exaggeration.&quot; Historian George Athan Billias argues in support of Baldwin&#x27;s estimates, due in part to the corroborating admission of another British deserter. Regardless, the combined British and Hessian casualties were almost certainly larger than those of the Americans.

With the British advance delayed, the main American army under Washington was able to safely evacuate from Harlem (on the island of Manhattan) to White Plains. Howe slowly moved his army through New Rochelle and Scarsdale. On October 28, he sent 13,000 men to attack the Americans, resulting in a victory over Washington at the Battle of White Plains. Fort Washington, the last American stronghold on Manhattan, fell on November 16. With these defeats, Washington and his army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania, paving the way for the Battles of Trenton and Princeton.

<text>Steven Douglas White (born 31 May 1965) is an English drummer who has worked extensively with Paul Weller and the Style Council among others.

==Musical career==
White was given a small drum as a child by his uncle and upon joining his local Boys&#x27; Brigade he began to learn his craft. As with White&#x27;s bandmate Paul Weller, he was given full support from his parents who went out of their way to help their son develop. White spent his youth having lessons from the late George Scott of Wanstead and learning from recordings of Buddy Rich and Louis Bellson. White later took lessons with drumming teacher Bob Armstrong at Bob&#x27;s Masterclass studio, then in Hornchurch, Essex. White complemented his work gigging with local bands with part-time work, spending any spare cash on updating his collection of jazz records.

In 1983, White auditioned for an unnamed band which turned out to be Paul Weller&#x27;s new group, the Style Council. Weller was impressed with the 17-year-old drummer&#x27;s jazz background and asked White to come back the following day. White stayed with the band for some years but was never actually invited to join, even though he appeared in most of their videos and on all but a few recordings. He became the youngest drummer on stage at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium in 1985. He also performed at Live 8 with the Who at Hyde Park in 2005, when their regular drummer, Zak Starkey, had left to join Oasis on their tours and recording sessions.

White left the Style Council in 1989 to pursue other projects and went on to play with many well known acts, such as Ian Dury, the James Taylor Quartet, the Redskins and the Jazz Renegades. When the Style Council reformed for a one-off gig for Japanese TV in 1990, Paul Weller invited White to his studio to hear a few demo tracks. White was soon back full-time behind the kit for Weller&#x27;s solo projects. His brother, Alan White, is also a drummer, who played for Oasis for 9 years (1995–2004). 
White also became a member of the group named the Players with ex-Style Council keyboardist Mick Talbot and ex-Ocean Colour Scene bassist Damon Minchella.

White took a break from recording with Paul Weller. He played in Trio Valore with Damon Minchella and Seamus Beaghan. He has played with Jon Lord and also featured on the last La Roux album.

Alongside Damon Minchella and Matt Deighton, White plays in the Family Silver, which released their debut album on Privilege records in 2015.

<text>Hinton Govorn Battle Jr. (November 29, 1956 – January 30, 2024) was an American actor, singer, dancer, and choreographer. He won three Tony Awards, all in the category of Featured Actor in a Musical. He was the first to portray the Scarecrow in the stage version of &quot;The Wiz&quot; (a role then taken on by Michael Jackson in the 1978 film adaptation).

==Early life==
Hinton Govorn Battle Jr. was born in Neubrücke, Hoppstädten-Weiersbach, West Germany, part of the Baumholder Army Military Community, and raised in Washington, D.C., and New York City. His mother was a homemaker and his father a U.S. Army officer. Battle&#x27;s talent became apparent at the age of nine. After three years of studying ballet at the Jones-Haywood School of Ballet, he received a scholarship to The School of American Ballet where he studied until the age of fifteen under George Balanchine.

==Career==
On October 21, 1974, the new musical &quot;The Wiz&quot; opened at the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre in Baltimore, Maryland, and then moved to Broadway&#x27;s Majestic Theatre with a new cast on January 5, 1975. This is where Battle made his Broadway debut starring as the Scarecrow.

Battle appeared in 15 films and television programs, including &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, and &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. On &quot;Quantum Leap,&quot; he played Thames, the evil Observer from the future, in the final installment of the Evil Leaper trilogy of episodes.
Battle played the role of the Cat in the first U.S. pilot for science-fiction sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, based on the British show of the same name. Notably, he guest-starred as Sweet the jazz demon, in &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;, &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot;″s musical episode in which his spell forces the characters to sing their biggest secrets and fears.

Battle&#x27;s other Broadway starring roles included &quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, &quot;Sophisticated Ladies&quot; for which he won his first Tony Award, &quot;Chicago&quot; (Billy Flynn), and &quot;Ragtime&quot; (Coalhouse Walker Jr.), which garnered rave reviews from the Chicago press and earned him an Ira Aldridge Award. His role in &quot;The Tap Dance Kid&quot; earned Hinton a second Tony Award as well as the NAACP Award and the Fred Astaire Award. He won his third Tony Award for &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; (1991) playing the role of John Thomas. He sang the riveting &quot;Bui Doi&quot;, one of the feature songs.

Battle&#x27;s long list of television credits included &quot;Shine,&quot; his one-man show presented at the HBO Aspen Comedy Arts Festival; The Kennedy Center&#x27;s 25th Anniversary; &quot;These Old Broads&quot;, co-starring Shirley MacLaine, Joan Collins, Debbie Reynolds, and Elizabeth Taylor; and ABC/Disney&#x27;s &quot;Child Star: The Shirley Temple Story&quot; where Hinton served as a choreographer and co-star playing Bill &#x27;Bojangles&#x27; Robinson.

As a choreographer, Battle&#x27;s work has been seen on the musical episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;, &quot;These Old Broads&quot;, &quot;Foreign Student&quot; (with Charles Dutton), The Golden Globe Awards, &quot;Dance in America&quot;; the sitcoms &quot;Fired Up&quot;, &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Normal&quot;, and &quot;The Boys&quot;. Hinton has choreographed promos for Warner Brothers, commercials for Coca-Cola, Chicago the musical, and New York Top Appliances. He served as Associate Choreographer on the 65th and 66th Annual Academy Awards with Debbie Allen.

Off-Broadway, Battle served as co-director and choreographer for &quot;Evil Dead The Musical&quot;. Having finished choreographing the movie musical &quot;Idlewild&quot;, he joined with Wynton Marsalis for &quot;The Buddy Bolden Story&quot;, a feature film about one of the originators of jazz in the United States. He then directed the stage musical &quot;Respect&quot;, a musical journey of women from the 1900s to 2007. Battle&#x27;s most recent creation, a dance form called Swop that combines swing and hip-hop, was performed on the highly rated &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in 2006. In 2014, Battle starred in the off-Broadway production &quot;Cindy: The Musical&quot;.

In 2017, Battle founded the Hinton Battle Dance Academy in Japan, which closed in 2022.

===Music===
In addition to his prolific dancing career, Battle briefly drifted into singing in the mid-1980s. His song &quot;Think We&#x27;re Gonna Make It&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the 1986 movie &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;, and he released his lone solo album, &quot;Untapped&quot;, that same year.

===Writing===
Battle had written a children&#x27;s book and had been working on an autobiography at the time of his death.

==Death==
Battle died after a lengthy illness at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on January 30, 2024, at the age of 67. In honor of Battle, the Broadway League announced all 41 Broadway theaters would dim their marquee lights on March 12, 2024. Dimming the lights of Broadway theaters is a tradition reflecting the honoree&#x27;s influence and career.

<text>The Deep Fork National Wildlife Refuge (DFNWR) is part of the United States system of National Wildlife Refuges, and is a critical resource for wildfowl that migrate along the Central Flyway in Spring and Fall. It is located in Eastern Oklahoma, near the city of Okmulgee. The preserve runs along both banks of the Deep Fork River for about . According to TravelOK, DFNWR receives about 45,000 visitors every year.
==Description==
The refuge was established in June 1993 and dedicated in February 1995. The land within its legal boundaries is of which about were publicly owned in 2015. Additional land will be purchased from willing sellers as funds are available, and until the refuge reaches its legal limit in size.

The refugee is a narrow ribbon of wetlands, oxbow lakes, swamps, and upland forests along the meandering Deep Fork River. More than 80 percent of the refuge floods annually, thus providing excellent habitat for waterfowl and a wide variety of other animals, including white-tailed deer, bald eagles, and wild turkey. 254 species of birds and 51 species of mammals have been recorded in the refuge. Four wildlife species of special concern abound here (the river otter, Bell’s vireo, alligator snapping turtle, and the northern scarlet snake). Beavers are so numerous as to be considered pests, as are feral hogs.

Most of the vegetation in the refuge is bottomland forests of oak, pecan, elm, hickory, ash, sugarberry, walnut, river birch, and willow. The area has been logged in the past and most of the forest is still relatively young, although a few patches of mature forests can be found. New hardwood growth sprouts near the river, then spreads more widely in the refuge when the floods come.

==Recreation==

Most of the refuge is open to the public year-round. Several parking areas scattered around the refuge give access to visitors for bird watching, hunting, fishing, hiking, and boating. A fishing area is maintained on Montezuma Creek. Near the headquarters the Cussetah Bottoms Boardwalk leads through forests, swamps, and beaver ponds for about one-half mile. In the southernmost part of the refuge a trail through forests follows an old railroad grade, thus elevating it above the frequently-flooded land. Deer, rabbits, squirrel, turkey, and ducks can also be hunted. The Deep Fork River is noted for large Flathead catfish and also has other species. Kayaking is popular in the refuge. The refuge has 22 parking lots connected to the hunting and wildlife observation areas by of trails and unimproved roads. Off-road vehicles are prohibited.

The Deep Fork National Wildlife Refuge is bordered on the north by the Okmulgee Wildlife Management area (OWMA) of . Deep Fork River runs for through the OWMA, which is mostly upland and hilly rather than flat and swampy, as the refuge is. Adjoining the refuge on the south is the Eufaula Wildlife Management area which preserves another of the Deep Fork River to its mouth at Eufaula Lake. Land in Eufaula WMA is similar in character to the refuge. The three areas together preserve in a near natural state more than and of the Deep Fork River.

<text>Gross-Wien Op. 440 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II written in 1891 and was a choral waltz for the Wiener Männergesang-Verein (Vienna Men&#x27;s Choral Association) during the Vienna Fasching (Carnival) of the same year. The text for the choral version of the waltz was by Franz von Gernerth.

The waltz&#x27;s title was a chronicle of events in and around Vienna as the Imperial City underwent vast development through the years. Although the waltz was intended as a choral work for the association, its first performance was actually at the Vienna Prater, on 10 May 1891 for a &#x27;Monster Concert&#x27; of over 500 musicians from the combined military orchestras of Vienna under Strauss&#x27; baton. The premiere of the waltz in its orchestral version was also without chorus, as the planned performance with chorus had been delayed until 4 October of the same year, taking place at the Sängerhalle under the direction of chorus-master Eduard Kremser.

The first performance at the Prater was also attended by the Austrian ruling family, as well as the King and Queen of Denmark and the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland. Strauss&#x27; waltz brims with a confidence typical of his maturity, containing musical ideas that are never trite, although he wrote waltzes at a prodigious rate.

<text>Enrique Wilson Martes (born July 27, 1973) is a Dominican former professional baseball player. In his eight-season Major League Baseball career, Wilson played with the Cleveland Indians (1997–2000), Pittsburgh Pirates (2000–01), New York Yankees (2001–04), and the Chicago Cubs (2005) as a utility infielder. He batted switch and threw right-handed.

Wilson was a career .244 hitter with 22 home runs, with three grand slams, and 141 RBI in 555 games. Versatile around the diamond, Wilson had a rather mobile career playing (mostly as a backup) at second base, third and shortstop. Wilson was known to play hitters well and with a strong arm, had some pop in his bat, and would run occasionally, but did not to try to steal very often.

In 2001, he was scheduled to be on American Airlines Flight 587 that crashed in a New York City neighborhood. However, when the Yankees lost the 2001 World Series to the Arizona Diamondbacks, Wilson flew home a few days earlier and was not on the flight.

In 2003, Wilson was involved in an incident where Manny Ramirez missed a game claiming to have a sore throat, but was later found to actually have been partying in a hotel room with Wilson. At the time, Wilson played for the rival New York Yankees.

During Wilson&#x27;s time with the Yankees, he was often placed in the lineup over superior players when the team faced Boston Red Sox ace Pedro Martínez. This was due to his inexplicable ability to hit Martinez well over his career. In 35 at bats including the postseason, Wilson batted .364 vs Martinez.

Wilson was signed by the Baltimore Orioles to a minor-league contract before the 2005 season. He was released in May, and subsequently signed with the Cubs. After appearing in fifteen games with the Cubs, he was released a second time. In 2006, Wilson played for the Boston Red Sox&#x27;s Triple-A team, the Pawtucket Red Sox, and retired in August.

<doc id="1249802" wikidata="Q106771" url="?curid=1249802" title="Hor-Aha">
<text>Hor-Aha (or Aha or Horus Aha; ) is considered the second pharaoh of the First Dynasty of Egypt by some Egyptologists, while others consider him the first one and corresponding to Menes. He lived around the 31st century BC and is thought to have had a long reign.

== Identity ==

===Name===

The commonly used name &quot;Hor-Aha&quot; is a rendering of the pharaoh&#x27;s Horus-name, an element of the royal titulary associated with the god Horus, and is more fully given as &quot;Horus-Aha&quot; meaning &quot;Horus the Fighter&quot;.

Manetho&#x27;s record &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; (translating to History of Egypt) lists his Greek name as Athothis, or &quot;Athotís&quot;.

For the Early Dynastic Period, the archaeological record refers to the pharaohs by their Horus-names, while the historical record, as evidenced in the Turin and Abydos king lists, uses an alternative royal titulary, the &quot;nebty&quot;-name. The different titular elements of a pharaoh&#x27;s name were often used in isolation, for brevity&#x27;s sake, although the choice varied according to circumstance and period.

Mainstream Egyptological consensus follows the findings of Flinders Petrie in reconciling the two records and connects Hor-Aha (archaeological) with the &quot;nebty&quot;-name (historical).
The same process has led to the identification of the historical Menes (a &quot;nebty&quot;-name) with Narmer (a Horus-name) evidenced in the archaeological record (both figures are credited with the unification of Egypt and as the first pharaoh of Dynasty I) as the predecessor of Hor-Aha (the second pharaoh).

=== Theories ===
There has been some controversy about Hor-Aha. Some believe him to be the same individual as the legendary Menes and that he was the one to unify all of Egypt. Others claim he was the son of Narmer, the pharaoh who unified Egypt. Narmer and Menes may have been one pharaoh, referred to with more than one name. Regardless, considerable historical evidence from the period points to Narmer as the pharaoh who first unified Egypt (see Narmer Palette) and to Hor-Aha as his son and heir.

== Reign ==

===Successor to Narmer===
Seal impressions discovered by Günter Dreyer in the Umm El Qa&#x27;ab from Den and Qa&#x27;a burials identify Hor-Aha as the second pharaoh of the first dynasty. His predecessor Narmer had united Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt into a single kingdom, Upper and Lower Egypt. Hor-Aha probably ascended the throne in the mid 31st century BC.

===Interior policy===
Hor-Aha seems to have conducted many religious activities. A visit to a shrine of the goddess Neith is recorded on several tablets from his reign. The sanctuary of Neith he visited was located in the north-west of the Nile Delta at Sais. Furthermore, the first known representation of the sacred &quot;Henu&quot;-barque of the god Seker- was found engraved on a year tablet dating from his reign.

Vessel inscriptions, labels and sealings from the graves of Hor-Aha and Queen Neithhotep suggest that this queen died during the reign of Aha. He arranged for her burial in a magnificent mastaba excavated by Jacques de Morgan. Queen Neithhotep is plausibly Aha&#x27;s mother The selection of the cemetery of Naqada as the resting place of Neithhotep is a strong indication that she came from this province. This, in turn, supports the view that Narmer married a member of the ancient royal line of Naqada to strengthen the domination of the Thinite kings over the region. However, in January 2016, a rock inscription demonstrated that Neithhotep was actually a queen regent early during the reign of Djer, Hor-Aha&#x27;s successor. Therefore, the cemetery evidence only proves that Neithhotep did live during the reign of Hor-Aha but succeeded him into Djer&#x27;s reign.

Most importantly, the oldest mastaba at the North Saqqara necropolis of Memphis dates to his reign. The mastaba belongs to an elite member of the administration who may have been a relative of Hor-Aha, as was customary at the time. This is a strong indication of the growing importance of Memphis during Aha&#x27;s reign.

===Economic development===
Few artifacts remain of Hor-Aha&#x27;s reign. However, the finely executed copper-axe heads, faience vessel fragments, ivory box and inscribed white marbles all testify to the flourishing of craftsmanship during Aha&#x27;s time in power.

===Activities outside Egypt===
Inscription on an ivory tablet from Abydos suggests that Hor-Aha led an expedition against the Nubians. On a year tablet, a year is explicitly called &#x27;Year of smiting of Ta-Sety&#x27; (i.e. Nubia).

During Hor-Aha&#x27;s reign, trade with the Southern Levant seems to have been on the decline. Contrary to his predecessor Narmer, Hor-Aha is not attested outside of the Nile Valley. This may point to a gradual replacement of long-distance trade between Egypt and its eastern neighbors by a more direct exploitation of the local resources by the Egyptians. Vessel fragment analysis from an Egyptian outpost at En Besor suggests that it was active during Hor-Aha&#x27;s reign. Other Egyptian settlements are known to have been active at the time as well (Byblos and along the Lebanese coast). Finally, Hor-Aha&#x27;s tomb yielded vessel fragments from the Southern Levant.

===Manetho===
According to the Egyptian priest Manetho (who lived over 2,600 years after Hor-Aha&#x27;s reign), Aha built a palace in Memphis and was a skilled physician who wrote multiple books on anatomy.

== Family ==

Hor-Aha&#x27;s chief wife was Benerib, whose name was &quot;written alongside his on a number of [historical] pieces, in particular, from tomb B14 at Abydos, Egypt&quot;. Tomb B14 is located directly adjacent to Hor-Aha&#x27;s sepulchre. Hor-Aha also had another wife, Khenthap, with whom he became father of Djer. She is mentioned as Djer&#x27;s mother on the Cairo Annals Stone.

Hor-Aha&#x27;s mother is believed to be Neithhotep. She is also believed to be wife of the late Narmer and possibly remarried one of Hor-Aha&#x27;s top three Grand Viziers by the name of Rekhit after the death of Narmer. The massive Naqada tomb Neithhotep was believed to be buried has 10 inscriptions of her in it. The same tomb also has 15 inscriptions to Rekhit.

==Tomb==
The tomb of Hor-Aha is located in the necropolis of the kings of the 1st Dynasty at Abydos, known as the Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab. It comprises three large chambers (designated B10, B15, and B19), which are directly adjacent to Narmer&#x27;s tomb. The chambers are rectangular, directly dug in the desert floor, their walls lined with mud bricks.
The tombs of Narmer and Ka had only two adjacent chambers, while the tomb of Hor-Aha comprises three substantially larger yet separated chambers. The reason for this architecture is that it was difficult at that time to build large ceilings above the chambers, as timber for these structures often had to be imported from Canaan.

A striking innovation of Hor-Aha&#x27;s tomb is that members of the royal household were buried with the pharaoh, the earliest known retainer sacrifices in Egypt. It is unclear if they were killed or committed suicide. Among those buried were servants, dwarfs, women and even dogs. A total of 36 subsidiary burials were laid out in three parallel rows north-east of Hor-Aha&#x27;s main chambers. As a symbol of royalty Hor-Aha was even given a group of young lions.

<text>Ernest David Klein, (July 26, 1899, Szatmárnémeti – February 4, 1983, Ottawa, Canada) was a Hungarian-born Romanian-Canadian linguist, author, and rabbi.

== Early life and education ==
Klein was born to father Yitzchok (Ignac) and mother Sarah Rachel (Roza) Klein (née Friedrich) on July 26, 1899. in Szatmárnémeti (also known as Szatmar), in Partium, a region of Kingdom of Hungary (now Satu Mare, Romania. He had three sisters.

Klein&#x27;s father was a respected scholar known for his brilliance. He was rabbi of the Jewish Status Quo Community in Marosvásárhely (now Târgu Mureș, Romania) and author of over 20 books on rabbinical subjects, including the following (all were printed in Satu Mare):

* Hebrew Torah Journal &quot;Ohel Yitzchok&quot; (1903–1914)
* Hebrew Book &quot;Zichron L&#x27;Yisroel&quot; (1912)
* Hebrew Torah Journal &quot;Sefer Hamagid&quot; (1928–1934)
* Hebrew Torah Journal &quot;Magid Yeruchem&quot; (1925–1930)
* Hebrew Book &quot;Kol Ha&#x27;chatan&quot; (1937)

Klein&#x27;s mother also had rabbinical lineage. She was one of the daughters of Chaim (Jakob) Friedrich who was rabbi of the orthodox community in Turc, Ugocsa County, Kingdom of Hungary (now part of Turț, Satu Mare County, Romania).

From early on in Klein&#x27;s childhood, his greatness was already noted. At the young age of nine years, Klein was able to recite the entire Book of Psalms by heart. As a youth in Hungary, Klein spent his free time in between classes learning new languages. Remarkably, at the age of 15, Klein taught himself English using English language textbooks. Klein had a great talent in learning languages. In an interview by &quot;The Canadian Jewish News&quot; (August 1, 1975), Klein recalls traveling from his birthplace Satu Mare, Romania to Austria, a little uneasy at the prospect of studying in a foreign country where he did not know the language. Klein taught himself German during the few days journey, and by the end of the year he was the best pupil in his class. Over the years Klein acquired more than 40 languages.

Klein passed his exams to become a rabbi in 1920 when he was 21 years old.

Klein studied languages, philology and exact philosophy at the University of Budapest and the University of Vienna; he received his Doctorate of Philosophy from the latter in 1925. Fifty years later, in 1975 at a ceremony held in Canada by the Austrian Consulate, Klein was awarded the &quot;Golden Ph.D.&quot; on his promotion to Doctorate of Philosophy by the University of Vienna.

== Rabbinical career and deportation to Auschwitz ==
He was the rabbi of the Nové Zámky community, Czechoslovakia, Érsekújvár - since 1938 part of Hungary - from 1931 to 1944 (today part of Slovakia) when he was deported to Auschwitz and Dachau. His wife and young son were killed in Czechoslovakia before World War II officially commenced. His father and two of his three sisters were killed in Auschwitz. He was freed from Dachau by US troops in 1945.

After the war he served briefly as the rabbi in his hometown of Satu Mare. After emigrating to France, he was a rabbi of the synagogue on Rue de Montevideo in Paris (1950–1951) and in 1951 he emigrated to Canada, with his sister Elizabeth and her husband. There he held the post of Rabbi of Congregation Beth Yitshak in Toronto, founded by Hungarian-speaking Holocaust survivors and named for Klein&#x27;s father Yitschak. He served as the community&#x27;s rabbi until his death in 1983.

== Author ==
Klein wrote three etymological dictionaries. His most famous work is &quot;A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (1966–1967).

He is also the author of &quot;A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Language for Readers of English&quot; (1987), an English-language etymological dictionary of Hebrew to which he devoted the last ten years of his life.

He wrote an etymological dictionary of medical terms which was not published.

== Honors ==
For his scholarly work he received honorary degrees from McMaster University and the University of Guelph in 1977. In 1978, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

<text>The Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica) is a goat-antelope that lives in the Pyrenees and Cantabrian Mountains of Spain, France and Andorra, and the Apennine Mountains of central Italy. It is one of the two species of the genus &quot;Rupicapra&quot;, the other being the chamois, &quot;Rupicapra rupicapra&quot;.

==Names==
*Aragonese: &quot;sarrio&quot;, &quot;chizardo&quot;
*Asturian: &quot;robecu/robezu&quot;
*Basque: &quot;pirinioetako sarrioa&quot;
*Catalan: &quot;isard&quot;
*French: &quot;izard/isard&quot;
*Galician: &quot;rebezo&quot;
*Italian: &quot;camoscio dei Pirenei&quot;, &quot;camoscio appenninico&quot;
*Occitan: &quot;isard&quot;, &quot;sarri&quot;
*Spanish: &quot;rebeco&quot;, &quot;gamuza&quot;

== Subspecies ==

==Description==
Up to 80 cm tall, its summer coat is a ruddy brown; in winter, it is black or brown, with darker patches around the eyes. Both males and females have backward-hooked horns up to 20 cm in length. They browse on grass, lichens and buds of trees. Sure-footed and agile, they are found on any elevation up to 3000 m.

==Conservation==
Like other species of chamois, it was hunted almost to extinction, especially in the 1940s, for the production of chamois leather. The population has since recovered, and in 2022 was estimated to be about 50,000 mature individuals.

<doc id="1249823" wikidata="Q16994889" url="?curid=1249823" title="Independent Television Service for Wales and the West">
<text>Independent Television Service for Wales and the West (ITSWW) was a temporary emergency service provided by the Independent Television Authority (ITA) in light of the early termination of service of the previous franchise holder, Television Wales and the West (TWW) after their loss of ITV franchise was announced in 1967.

==Circumstances==
In June 1967 the Independent Television Authority (ITA) had announced changes to the structure and contracts of the ITV network in the United Kingdom, to take effect in July 1968. Several changes were announced that would have far-reaching effects for British television. The UK press decided that the most dramatic news was the loss of the Wales and West contract, held by TWW since 1958, to a consortium headed by and named after Lord Harlech.

TWW fought the ITA&#x27;s decision, both formally and through the press. However, the ITA remained resolute that it was legally entitled to remove any contract at any time for any reason, and the board of TWW eventually accepted this and announced it would carry on providing a programme service to the area until the end of the contract period.

==Problems with TWW==
Standard regulatory practice at the time stated that the new incumbent of a licence should take on all available staff of the outgoing company. However, the new licence holder, Harlech Television, intended to dismiss all the on-screen personnel of TWW, and launch with a fresh team.

The board of TWW were advised not to take a stake in Harlech that was offered to them by the ITA, but this had the effect of depressing the company&#x27;s share price. It eventually became clear to the board that to raise the maximum amount of money for shareholders, they should &quot;sell&quot; the last part of the broadcast contract to Harlech. The ITA accepted this and the sale went through for £500,000. However, Harlech were not yet in a position to begin production and would therefore have to launch their promised new service using &quot;in the can&quot; TWW productions.

==ITA solution==
The ITA suggested Harlech would receive all the advertising revenue from the handover date, and pay TWW a fee to continue local production, while Harlech continued to prepare its own programmes for the original 31 July launch. The interim contract would use neither company&#x27;s name, and the literal &quot;Independent Television Service for Wales and the West&quot; was chosen.

This created a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; between the end of TWW and the start of Harlech. Nevertheless, the &quot;in the can&quot; TWW productions, of which there were many, still carried &quot;TWW presents&quot; and &quot;TWW production&quot; captions. The presentation retained TWW in-vision announcers, giving the impression that little had changed. A temporary ident was designed, with four white horizontal bars shooting towards the viewer, electronic music and the name revealing itself a line at a time. The former TWW clock was retained. This was referred to in the local press as &quot;TWW&#x27;s revenge&quot; on Harlech. The situation lasted just under three months.

The &quot;ITSWW&quot; service was never referred to as such on air, but it continued both of the former TWW dual services under the names &#x27;South Wales and West&#x27; and &#x27;Teledu Cymru&#x27; – the latter having been the existing on-air name in that area. Both names were prefixed with the new phrase &quot;Independent Television Service&quot;. Extensive broadsheet press advertising was taken out to explain the arrangements to those viewers deemed to be interested. Nothing was placed in the tabloids.

<doc id="1249829" wikidata="Q537463" url="?curid=1249829" title="LaDainian Tomlinson">
<text>LaDainian Tarshane Tomlinson (born June 23, 1979), nicknamed &quot;LT&quot;, is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. After a successful college football career with the TCU Horned Frogs, the San Diego Chargers selected him as the fifth overall pick in the 2001 NFL draft. He spent nine years with the Chargers, earning five Pro Bowl appearances, three Associated Press first-team All-Pro nominations, and two NFL rushing titles. Tomlinson was also voted the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2006 after breaking the record for touchdowns in a single season. He played two further seasons with the New York Jets, before retiring. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017.

A native of Rosebud, Texas, Tomlinson showed athletic promise while attending University High School. He was recruited by Texas Christian University (TCU). As a junior, Tomlinson rushed for 406 yards in a single game, a Division I record at the time. As a senior, he earned unanimous All-American honors, and won the Doak Walker Award as the best college running back. TCU retired his 5 in 2005, and he was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2014.

The Chargers selected Tomlinson No. 5 overall after passing on the opportunity to select highly rated quarterback Michael Vick. A starter in his rookie season, Tomlinson opened his career with the first of seven consecutive seasons with over 1,200 rushing yards, a streak achieved previously only by Eric Dickerson. He became a prolific scorer under Marty Schottenheimer, who coached the Chargers from 2002 to 2006. Tomlinson&#x27;s output reached a peak in 2006, when he set numerous single-season records, including for most touchdowns scored (31). These feats won him the NFL MVP award, but San Diego suffered an upset defeat in their playoff opener, and Schottenheimer was fired shortly afterwards. Tomlinson became less central to the Charger offense in the following three seasons, and missed time through injury in key games. He was released following the 2009 season, played two seasons with the Jets, and retired.

Tomlinson was named to five Pro Bowls (2002, 2004–2007), was a first-team All-Pro three times (2004, 2006, 2007), and won consecutive rushing titles in 2006 and 2007. At the time of his retirement, he ranked fifth in career rushing yards (13,684), fifth in yards from scrimmage (18,456), second in career rushing touchdowns (145), and third in total touchdowns (162). Tomlinson also threw seven touchdown passes and ranks second behind Walter Payton (eight) for non-quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era. Tomlinson had his No. 21 retired by the Chargers in 2015 and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017, his first year of eligibility.

Tomlinson is often known by his initials, L.T.. He works as an analyst on the NFL Network, and also serves as a special assistant to the Chargers&#x27; principal owner, Dean Spanos.

==Early life==
Tomlinson was born on June 23, 1979, in Rosebud, Texas, to Loreane Chappelle and Oliver Tomlinson. His mother worked as a preacher; his father left the family when Tomlinson was seven years old. Tomlinson did not see his father very often afterward. He grew up with a brother and a sister and later, also a half-sister and three half-brothers. At age nine, Tomlinson joined the Pop Warner Little Scholars football program and scored a touchdown the first time he touched the ball.

Tomlinson attended University High School in Waco, Texas, where he ran track and played basketball, baseball, and football. Tomlinson began his football career playing as both a linebacker and a fullback, but blossomed on the offensive side of the ball; he was named to the District 10–4A second-team offense as a running back. Tomlinson amassed 2,554 yards and 39 touchdowns his senior year, earning honors as the District 25-4A Most Valuable Player and the Super Centex Offensive Player of the Year. He was named to the state all-star football team in 1997, which included future San Diego teammates Drew Brees (Austin Westlake) and Quentin Jammer (Angleton).

Tomlinson was an avid Dallas Cowboys and Miami Hurricanes fan during his youth. He idolized Walter Payton and admired Emmitt Smith, Jim Brown, and Barry Sanders. Tomlinson was able to meet Smith while attending a camp run by Dallas Cowboys tight end Jay Novacek.

==College career==
Tomlinson accepted an athletic scholarship at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas, then a member of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). He played for the TCU Horned Frogs from 1997 to 2000. Before Tomlinson&#x27;s arrival, TCU had appeared in only one bowl game in the previous 12 seasons and two in the previous 31, losing both. They had recently been downgraded to a minor conference (the WAC) after the breakup of the Southwest Conference.
During Tomlinson&#x27;s freshman and sophomore years, he split time with Basil Mitchell and other backs, while the Horned Frog posted records of 1–10 and 6–5. The latter of these seasons finished with TCU&#x27;s first bowl win in 42 years against the USC Trojans in the Sun Bowl, though Tomlinson only rushed for 34 yards in the game (Mitchell had 185 yards and two touchdowns). Tomlinson was promoted to the starting running back role during his junior season, responding with 1,850 yards and 18 touchdowns as the Horned Frogs improved to 7–4. On November 20, he set an NCAA Division I record for most rushing yards in a game with a 43-carry, 406-yard, 6-touchdown performance against UTEP. TCU ended the season with a 28–14 win against East Carolina in the 1999 Mobile Alabama Bowl. His 20 rushing touchdowns were tied for the NCAA lead with Ron Dayne. He finished second in the NCAA in rushing to Dayne with 1,974 rushing yards. He was named the WAC Offensive Player of the Year and first-team All-WAC for the 1999 season.

Tomlinson&#x27;s senior season was one of great consistency. He went over 100 rushing yards and scored at least one touchdown in every game. He started his senior campaign with 24 carries for 176 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in a 41–10 victory over Nevada. In the following game against Northwestern, he had 39 carries for 243 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 41–14 victory. In the following game, a 52–3 victory over Arkansas State, he had 23 carries for 140 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. TCU ended September with a perfect 4–0 mark with a 24–0 victory over Navy where Tomlinson had 33 carries for 121 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown. To start off October, Tomlinson had his best game of the season to that point with 49 carries for 294 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns in a 41–21 victory over Hawaii. In the next game, against Tulsa, he had 27 carries for 119 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in the 17–3 victory. In the following game against Rice, he had 41 carries for 200 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 37–0 victory. The victory over Rice marked a perfect October and a 7–0 start for TCU. The undefeated Horned Frogs reached a No. 9 ranking in the AP Poll, their highest since 1959. TCU dropped their first game of the season in the following game against San Jose State. Tomlinson had 32 carries for 155 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 27–24 loss to the Spartans. In the next game against Fresno State, he had 42 carries for 231 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in the 24–7 victory. In the following game against UTEP, Tomlinson rushed 33 times for 305 yards and three touchdowns in the 47–14 victory. TCU closed out their regular season with a 62–7 victory over SMU, where Tomlinson had 26 carries for 174 rushing yard and one rushing touchdown. In the 2000 season, TCU again improved their record, going 10–1 and qualifying for their second consecutive Mobile Alabama Bowl. He led the NCAA for the second time with 2,158 yards and 22 touchdowns, adding 28 carries for 118 yards and two touchdowns in his final game with TCU, a 28–21 defeat in the Mobile Alabama Bowl. He was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American. He won the Doak Walker Award and the Jim Brown Trophy as the nation&#x27;s best running back, and was a finalist for the 2000 Heisman Trophy, but came in fourth in the voting. Tomlinson also repeated as WAC Offensive Player of the Year and as an All-WAC first-team selection.

Tomlinson completed his career at TCU with 5,263 rushing yards, ranking sixth in NCAA Division I history at the time. He had one more game before becoming a professional, taking part in the 2001 Senior Bowl on January 21. Tomlinson rushed for 88 yards and a touchdown and caught a pass for a further 28 yards, earning the game&#x27;s MVP award and helping the South beat the North 21–16.

TCU retired his No. 5 during halftime of a November 2005 game against UNLV. He was their single-game, single-season, and career record holder in both rushing touchdowns and rushing yards, amongst other records. In December of that year, Tomlinson fulfilled a promise to his mother by earning his degree in communications from TCU. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame on December 9, 2014.

==Professional career==
===2001 NFL draft===
After a 1–15 record in 2000, the San Diego Chargers had the first pick in the 2001 NFL draft. Quarterback was a weakness, with 1998 first-round pick Ryan Leaf considered a draft bust as he was cut after three unsuccessful seasons; Charger quarterbacks had combined for a league-high 30 interceptions in 2000. However, running back was also an area of need, with their team total of 1,062 yards the fewest recorded in a 16-game season. They were expected to use the No. 1 pick on quarterback Michael Vick, but preliminary contract negotiations with the player broke down, and general manager John Butler instead accepted a trade offer from the Atlanta Falcons; the Chargers&#x27; first-round pick (No. 1 overall) was exchanged for Atlanta&#x27;s first-round pick (No. 5 overall), as well as their third-round pick in 2001, their second-round pick in 2002, and wide receiver/kick returner Tim Dwight.

San Diego had shown interest in Tomlinson even before the trade with Atlanta. They selected him fifth overall, after the Cleveland Browns (picking third, and potentially interested in a running back) chose Gerard Warren instead. Instead of Vick, San Diego selected Drew Brees in the second round as their future quarterback. Chargers head coach Mike Riley stated that Tomlinson was the player the team had wanted after they&#x27;d made the trade. Tomlinson himself expressed relief at being passed on by the Browns. Of joining a one-win team, he said, &quot;At TCU my freshman year, we were 1–10. I know what it takes to rebuild a program.&quot;

=== San Diego Chargers ===
==== 2001 season ====
Tomlinson was a holdout through much of training camp, while his agent Tom Condon negotiated with the Chargers. He eventually signed a six-year, $38 million contract on August 21. He had missed the first two preseason games, and was kept on the bench for the third, before featuring briefly in the final game, rushing five times for 14 yards in a defeat to the Arizona Cardinals.

On September 9, Tomlinson made his regular season debut in a 30–3 victory over the Washington Redskins. He was immediately given a heavy workload, carrying 36 times for 113 yards and two touchdowns in the 30–3 victory. The 36 carries were tied for the third-most in franchise history up to that point, while the 113 yards were a new record for a Charger in his first career game. Tomlinson followed this by rushing for 90, 107, and 102 yards in the following three games. He added four more touchdowns; in a week 3 win against the Cincinnati Bengals, he posted the first three-touchdown game by a Charger running back since Natrone Means in 1994. Four games into his career, Tomlinson was the league leader in both rushing yards with 412 and rushing touchdowns with six, and had already surpassed the 384 yards with which third-down back Terrell Fletcher led the team the previous season.

Tomlinson&#x27;s pace slowed during the remaining twelve weeks of the season, with only four more touchdowns and one more 100-yard rushing game, which came in week 15 against the Kansas City Chiefs. Nonetheless, his total of 1,236 was the second-most in franchise history, behind only Means in 1994; with a further 367 receiving yards, Tomlinson had 1,603 yards from scrimmage, breaking the franchise record that Lance Alworth had set in 1965. San Diego finished the season with a nine-game losing streak and a 5–11 record. Tomlinson said of breaking Alworth&#x27;s record, &quot;It means a lot to me and the people who helped me get it. But I just wish I could have gotten it in a winning season when it means more.&quot;

League-wide, Tomlinson finished ninth for rushing yards and tied-fourth for rushing touchdowns. However, his yards per carry of 3.6 was only 31st among players with at least 100 carries, and his eight fumbles, one of which was returned for a key touchdown in a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, were joint-most among non-quarterbacks. Tomlinson led the league in touches (rushing attempts and receptions combined) with 398, and ranked ninth for yards from scrimmage. He received 16 votes for the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year award, finishing second to Anthony Thomas (22 votes). Thomas and Tomlinson were the two running backs named to the Pro Football Writers Association All-Rookie team.

==== 2002 season ====

A day after their final game of 2001, the Chargers fired head coach Mike Riley, replacing him with Marty Schottenheimer, recently dismissed as Washington&#x27;s head coach. Schottenheimer brought with him a reputation for favoring the running game over the pass. Tomlinson said of his new coach, &quot;I think he knows how to win, and he&#x27;s been doing it for a number of years. ... I think that is the kind of coach that we need.&quot; At his Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement speech in 2017, Tomlinson would describe Schottenheimer as the best coach he ever had.

Tomlinson tied or broke numerous franchise records during the season. Tomlinson started the season strong with 21 carries for 114 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown to go along with three receptions for 45 receiving yards in the 34–6 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. In week 4, he had 27 carries for 217 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in a 21–14 victory over the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, tying Gary Anderson for the most yards in a single game by a Charger. For his game against the Patriots, he was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the first time in his career. In week 7, he tied Marion Butts&#x27;s record with 39 carries in a game, rushing for 153 yards and scoring the winning touchdown as San Diego beat the eventual AFC champion Oakland Raiders 27–21 in overtime. With five catches in the same game, he had 44 touches in total, breaking another Means record.
In week 13, Tomlinson had 37 carries for 220 yards and three touchdowns, as well as 11 catches for 51 yards, helping San Diego beat the Denver Broncos in overtime. He had the longest run of his career to that point one play after Denver had taken a 10–0 lead, going for 76 yards and setting up his first touchdown. Tomlinson&#x27;s rushing yardage broke the record he had tied in week 4, while his 271 yards from scrimmage broke Wes Chandler&#x27;s Charger record for a regular season game. With 48 touches, he broke the franchise record he had set in week 7 and also tied James Wilder&#x27;s NFL record. Denver had entered the game with the league&#x27;s top-ranked run defense. For his game against the Broncos, he earned his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week nomination.

San Diego was 8–4 after beating the Broncos, but lost their last four in a row to miss the playoffs. Tomlinson nonetheless passed Means&#x27; franchise record for rushing yardage in a season with three games still to play, and finished with 1,683 yards, second-most in the league. His yards per carry improved by almost a full yard, to 4.5, while his 14 rushing touchdowns were another franchise record. As well as his rushing feats, Tomlinson also tied Ronnie Harmon&#x27;s Charger record for receptions by a running back, with 79. He again led the league in touches with 451, which proved to be a career-high; it was also the third-most in NFL history at the time. Tomlinson became the first Charger to gain 2,000-plus yards from scrimmage, with his total of 2,172 ranking third in the league. He also improved his ball security, fumbling only three times.

Tomlinson was rewarded for his performances with his first Pro Bowl nomination (together with Junior Seau, he was one of only two Chargers so honored), as well as being named an Associated Press (AP) 2nd-team All-Pro.

==== 2003 season ====

During the 2003 offseason, San Diego signed Lorenzo Neal, a fullback who had blocked for 1,000-yard rushers in each of his previous six seasons, and was coming off his first Pro Bowl nomination. Tomlinson would later describe Neal as vital to the progression of his career, and chose the fullback to introduce him on the day of his induction into the Hall of Fame.

The Chargers struggled throughout the 2003 season, finishing 4–12. Nonetheless, Tomlinson continued to produce strong individual performances. In week 4, he threw the first touchdown pass of his career, a 21-yard throw to Brees, on a trick play, as well as rushing for 187 yards and a touchdown in a loss to the Oakland Raiders. In week 6 against the Cleveland Browns, he rushed 26 times for 200 yards and a touchdown while leading the Chargers to their first win of the year; in total, Tomlinson accounted for 221 of the Chargers&#x27; 289 yards in the 26–20 victory. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the week for his game against the Browns. In week 10, against the Minnesota Vikings, he had 16 carries for 162 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 42–28 victory. The top two receiving performances of his career (measured by yards) arrived back-to-back in weeks 14 and 15; he had nine catches for 148 yards and two touchdowns against the Detroit Lions, and 11 catches for 144 yards and two touchdowns against the Green Bay Packers. Tomlinson entered the regular season finale against the Raiders needing eight more catches to become the first NFL player to have 1,000 rushing yards and 100 receptions in the same season. He achieved this, getting his 100th catch on the Chargers&#x27; final offensive play of the game (excluding quarterback kneels). In the same game, he improved upon his franchise record with 243 yards from 31 carries, with two touchdowns. This would remain Tomlinson&#x27;s career high.

Tomlinson finished with 1,645 rushing yards, third-most in the league. He averaged 5.3 yards per carry, the sixth-highest among backs with 100-plus carries; this would be the best average of his career. His receiving numbers were career highs: 100 receptions, 725 receiving yards, and four receiving touchdowns. The 100 receptions placed him fourth in the league; the rest of the top ten were all wide receivers. He broke Tony Martin&#x27;s franchise record of 90 receptions in 1995. Tomlinson had 2,370 yards from scrimmage, leading the league; it was the second-highest total in NFL history up to that point. He had five games with at least 200 yards from scrimmage during the season, another league record. Tomlinson scored 17 total touchdowns, tied for third in the league and another new career high.

Tomlinson was not voted to the Pro Bowl in 2003, which was seen as a snub by multiple observers; Tomlinson himself expressed disappointment, saying, &quot;I think all those guys deserve to be there, but are they better than me? Nope.&quot; However, he was named a Second-team Associated Press All-Pro for the second season in a row, and was runner-up to Jamal Lewis for the AP Offensive Player of the Year Award with eight votes.

==== 2004 season ====
On August 14, Tomlinson signed an eight-year contract worth $60 million, with $21 million guaranteed. It was the richest contract for a running back up to that point.

Tomlinson scored consistently throughout the season, with either one or two touchdowns in fourteen games, including a twelve-game streak from weeks 4 to 16. He again had a big performance against the Oakland Raiders, rushing 37 times for 164 yards and a touchdown during a 23–17 victory in week 10. San Diego clinched the AFC West division in week 15, with a 21–0 win in the snow over the Cleveland Browns; it was their first playoff berth since 1995, ending an eight-year drought. Tomlinson, who rushed for 111 yards and two touchdowns in the game, said, &quot;I&#x27;ve only been here four years, but in some ways it feels like eight. To go from where we were to this is awesome. I&#x27;ve dreamed of the playoffs for a long time, but it&#x27;s only been a dream.&quot;

Tomlinson&#x27;s yardage numbers were down from the previous season, with 1,335 rushing (7th in the league) and 441 receiving, in part because he was rested in the regular season finale, though his yards per carry dropped significantly to 3.9, and he had barely half as many receptions with 53. However, he led the NFL in rushing touchdowns for the first time with 17. His 1,776 scrimmage yards were tied for fifth in the league, while his 18 total touchdowns ranked second. Tomlinson earned his second Pro Bowl nomination, and rewarded his offensive line with an expenses-paid trip to Hawaii, the site of the game. He was voted Associated Press First-team All-Pro for the first time in his career.

Tomlinson&#x27;s first playoff experience came in 2004. San Diego hosted the New York Jets in the first round of the playoffs, losing 20–17 in overtime. Tomlinson rushed 26 times for 80 yards, and caught nine passes for 53 yards, scoring no touchdowns. During the sudden-death overtime period, San Diego gained a first down at the New York 22; Tomlinson ran three times for no gain before rookie kicker Nate Kaeding came in for a game-winning field goal attempt. Kaeding missed wide right, and New York drove for the winning points. Schottenheimer was criticized after the game for playing too conservatively with the three Tomlinson runs.

==== 2005 season ====
Tomlinson began the 2005 season on a regular season twelve-game streak of scoring at least one rushing touchdown, one short of the NFL record held by John Riggins and George Rogers. He tied and later broke the record in the first two weeks of the season, though the Chargers lost both games. In week 3, Tomlinson rushed 21 times for 192 yards and three touchdowns and threw a 26-yard touchdown to Keenan McCardell as San Diego defeated the New York Giants 45–23. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Giants. After scoring in the next two games, Tomlinson entered week 6 looking to tie Lenny Moore&#x27;s NFL record of 18 consecutive regular season games with a touchdown of any type. In the game, a 27–14 win against the Oakland Raiders, Tomlinson tied the record and became the tenth player in NFL history to run, catch, and throw for a touchdown in the same game. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against Oakland.

Tomlinson&#x27;s touchdown streak came to an end the following week, as he was shut down in a 20–17 loss against the Philadelphia Eagles, gaining only seven yards from 17 carries. It would be the only game in his career where Tomlinson had at least ten carries and averaged below a yard per attempt. He credited the Eagles&#x27; defense after the game, saying, &quot;They brought the blitz. They got into the backfield. They really controlled the line of scrimmage.&quot; Tomlinson threw his third touchdown pass of the season the following week against the Kansas City Chiefs, and had the first four-touchdown game of his career in a 31–26 win over the New York Jets, with three rushing touchdowns and one receiving. He was the first Charger since Chuck Muncie in 1981 to score four in a game. In week 12, Tomlinson rushed 25 times for 184 yards and three touchdowns, including a 41-yard game-winner in overtime as San Diego won 23–17 against the Washington Redskins. For his game against Washington, Tomlinson earned his third AFC Offensive Player of the Week nomination of 2005. After the game, Schottenheimer declared him the finest running back he&#x27;d ever seen. However, Tomlinson had no 100-yard rushing games and only a single touchdown over the remaining five games of the season, three of which the Chargers lost as they finished 9–7 and missed the playoffs. He was carrying an injury for much of this period, after picking up a rib injury in week 13 against the Raiders. His ribs were initially described as bruised, but later revealed to have been cracked.

Tomlinson&#x27;s rushing totals were 1,462 yards and 18 touchdowns, ranking sixth and third in the league respectively. With two receiving touchdowns, he had 20 in total; this broke Chuck Muncie&#x27;s franchise record, set in 1981. He ranked third in the league, behind Seattle Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander, who set a new NFL record with 28. Tomlinson again made the Pro Bowl, and was named an Associated Press second-team All-Pro.

==== 2006 season: NFL MVP ====

San Diego changed starting quarterbacks in 2006. Brees had injured his shoulder in the 2005 finale; after negotiations for a new contract with Chargers general manager A. J. Smith broke down, Brees was allowed to leave in free agency, paving the way for 2004 No. 4 overall draft pick Philip Rivers to take over. Tomlinson spoke positively about Rivers in the leadup to the season, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s going to be a great quarterback because the intangibles he has are what the great ones have.&quot; However, Tomlinson would suggest in a 2016 interview with &quot;ESPN&quot; that the switch cost San Diego a Super Bowl win, stating that Rivers was too inexperienced at the time.

The Chargers began their regular season with a 27–0 win against the Oakland Raiders, with Tomlinson rushing 31 times for 131 yards and a touchdown. The following week, in a 40–7 victory over the Tennessee Titans, he scored twice to tie Lance Alworth&#x27;s franchise record of 83 touchdowns. Following a bye week, Tomlinson was kept out the end zone in week 4 (a 16–13 loss against the Baltimore Ravens) and week 5 (a 23–13 win over the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers, in which he gained a season-low 36 rushing yards). While he only ran for 71 yards on 21 carries the following week against the San Francisco 49ers, Tomlinson had four rushing touchdowns, tying the Charger single-game record of Clarence Williams and Chuck Muncie while moving ahead of Alworth on the career total touchdowns list. In the following game, he caught one touchdown and threw for another as San Diego erased a 14-point, 4th-quarter deficit against the Kansas City Chiefs, though they went on to lose 30–27 to a late field goal.

After the Kansas City game, Tomlinson rushed for at least two touchdowns and at least 100 yards for the next eight games in a row, all Chargers wins. He began the sequence against the St. Louis Rams, rushing for 183 yards and two touchdowns, adding a further 57 receiving yards and a third touchdown, and recovering a late onside kick attempt by the Rams in the 38–24 victory. In the following game against the Cleveland Browns, Tomlinson&#x27;s first nine carries gained a modest 47 yards, but his following nine went for 125 yards and three touchdowns, giving him 172 yards in total at a season-high 9.56 yards per carry. He again recovered a late onside kick attempt by the opposition in the 32–25 victory. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Browns. In week 10, San Diego trailed the Cincinnati Bengals 21–0 after a single quarter, but came back to win 49–41. Tomlinson rushed for four of the Chargers&#x27; seven touchdowns, including a pair 15 seconds apart that put them ahead for the first time. In week 11, they faced the Denver Broncos in a division-topping battle of 7–2 teams. Again, they overcame a large deficit, trailing 24–7 in the third quarter before winning 35–27. Tomlinson scored four touchdowns, with three on the ground and one via a 51-yard catch-and-run. Rivers described him after the game as &quot;the best in the business&quot; and &quot;the ultimate weapon&quot;. With his second score against Denver, Tomlinson became the fastest player ever to score 100 touchdowns, accomplishing the milestone in 89 games and beating the previous record of 93 games held by Jim Brown and Emmitt Smith. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Broncos. Next, he accounted for all the Chargers&#x27; points in a 21–14 defeat of the Oakland Raiders, running for two touchdowns and throwing a 19-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Gates. After running for 178 yards and two touchdowns in a 24–21 victory against the Buffalo Bills, he had 26 combined rushing and receiving touchdowns on the season, only two behind the record Alexander had established in 2005.
San Diego had a chance to clinch the AFC West by beating the Denver Broncos in week 14. Tomlinson scored once as they built an early 28–3 lead. Denver had a run of 17 unanswered points in the third quarter, but Tomlinson&#x27;s record-tying 28th touchdown made the game safe at 41–20 in the final minutes. A fumble recovery by Shawne Merriman soon afterward gave San Diego the ball on the Denver seven-yard line. The next play was designed as an inside run, but Tomlinson broke to the left after his lead blocker Neal slipped over. He scored the record-breaking touchdown in the corner of the end zone—his second in 47 seconds—before being mobbed by his teammates and lifted shoulder-high. Tomlinson was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Broncos. After his retirement, Tomlinson listed the game as his most memorable with the Chargers.

Tomlinson broke three more records the following week, while rushing 25 times for a season-high 199 yards and two touchdowns in a 20–9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. His first touchdown took him past Paul Hornung&#x27;s 46-year-old record of 176 points in a season (Tomlinson finished with 186). His second touchdown was the longest of his career at 85 yards; that was his 28th rushing touchdown of the season, passing Alexander and Priest Holmes, and also gave him multiple touchdowns in eight consecutive games, breaking a tie with Riggins. Tomlinson&#x27;s streak of rushing touchdowns came to an end the following week, as he was kept out of the end zone in a 20–17 victory against the Seattle Seahawks, though he did extend his streak of 100-yard rushing games to a franchise-record nine. In the regular season finale against the Arizona Cardinals, Tomlinson left the game with a minor injury in the third quarter after rushing for 66 yards and no touchdowns in the 27–20 victory; that was still enough to give him the NFL rushing title, the first Charger to accomplish the feat.
Tomlinson led the league with 1,815 rushing yards, averaging 5.2 yards per carry and scoring a record 28 rushing touchdowns. He added 56 catches for 508 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns, with his average of 9.1 yards per catch the highest of his career up to that point. Tomlinson ranked second in the NFL with 2,323 yards from scrimmage; he had 404 touches in total, fumbling only twice. As a team, San Diego finished with a 14–2 record, the best winning percentage in their history, while topping the league with 492 points and claiming the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs. Including his two passing touchdowns, Tomlinson was directly involved with 33 of their league-leading 59 touchdowns.

On January 5, 2007, Tomlinson was named the Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player for his record-breaking season, receiving 44 of the 50 votes from a panel of nationwide sportswriters and broadcasters who cover the NFL. Accepting the award, Tomlinson said that he&#x27;d had a great year on a great team, adding, &quot;I would feel so much better about winning if we win the Super Bowl.&quot; He was the first Chargers player to win the award. Other organizations to name Tomlinson the NFL MVP included the Pro Football Writers of America, the &quot;Sporting News&quot;, and the Maxwell Football Club via the Bert Bell Award. The Associated Press also honored him as the Offensive Player of the Year and a unanimous 1st-Team All-Pro. Tomlinson was also named co-winner of the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award alongside Brees, now quarterback of the New Orleans Saints, and was voted to his fourth Pro Bowl. On July 11, 2007, Tomlinson won four ESPY Awards including Male Athlete of the Year.

Tomlinson&#x27;s second playoff game came at home in the divisional playoffs against the New England Patriots. It was another narrow defeat, this time by a 24–21 scoreline, with Kaeding missing a potential game-tying 54-yard field goal in the final seconds. Tomlinson&#x27;s good form continued, as he carried 23 times for 123 yards and a pair of touchdowns while catching two passes for 64 yards; he accounted for over half of the Chargers&#x27; 352 yards from scrimmage. After the game, the usually mild-mannered Tomlinson shouted at New England players celebrating on the Chargers midfield logo at Qualcomm Stadium by mocking Merriman&#x27;s sack dance, and suggested Patriots head coach Bill Belichick might be to blame in a post-match interview. &quot;They showed no class at all, and maybe that comes from the head coach,&quot; said Tomlinson. Both Tomlinson and Belichick said that they&#x27;d put the incident behind them while they were together in Hawaii the following month for the Pro Bowl.

==== 2007 season ====
Tomlinson and other Chargers defended Schottenheimer after their swift exit from the 2006 playoffs,
but Schottenheimer was nonetheless fired by team president Dean Spanos on February 12, 2007. A dysfunctional relationship between Schottenheimer and general manager A. J. Smith was among the reasons given by Spanos. Norv Turner, who was the San Diego Chargers offensive coordinator in Tomlinson&#x27;s rookie season, replaced Schottenheimer as head coach a week later. &quot;Norv is the perfect fit for our team. He will know exactly what to do with our team,&quot; Tomlinson said of the hiring.

Tomlinson struggled for much of the opening game, finishing with 17 carries for only 25 yards. However, he did throw the seventh and final touchdown pass of his career (a 17-yarder to Gates), and scored once himself as San Diego beat the Chicago Bears 14–3. In week 2, they travelled to New England for a rematch of the Divisional Round with the New England Patriots. It was the first game the Patriots played after being sanctioned for the Spygate incident; Tomlinson again criticized the organization, commenting, &quot;I think the Patriots actually live by the saying, &#x27;If you&#x27;re not cheating, you&#x27;re not trying.&#x27;&quot; New England won the game 38–14, with Tomlinson rushing 18 times for 43 yards. In week 6, he again had a big game against the Oakland Raiders, rushing 24 times for 198 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. That would be one of only two 100-yard rushing performances in the first eleven games for Tomlinson, who ranked only sixth in the league for rushing yardage with five games to go.

In a week 12 win against the Kansas City Chiefs, Tomlinson gained 177 yards on 23 carries and scored twice, passing Walter Payton on the all-time career rushing touchdown list with his 111th. A day later, Tomlinson honored Payton by wearing his jersey during a press conference. The following week, San Diego trailed 17–3 against the Tennessee Titans with eight minutes to play, before Tomlinson scored on a seven-yard touchdown catch. After Gates tied the score with nine seconds to play, the game went into overtime. Tomlinson won the game with a 16-yard touchdown run. It was the third overtime touchdown of his career, a record. He rushed 26 times for 146 rushing yards in that game, and added two further 100-yard performances for a streak of four in a row. While he only gained 56 yards in the regular season finale against the Oakland Raiders, Tomlinson&#x27;s late flurry was enough to win him his second NFL rushing title in a row; the Chargers finished with six straight wins, won the AFC West, and entered the playoffs as the No. 3-seed with an 11–5 record.

Tomlinson was involved in a pair of sideline incidents with Rivers over the course of the season. In an early-season loss to the Green Bay Packers, the two appeared to argue on the sideline; Tomlinson dismissed the interaction as &quot;competitive talk&quot;. Later, during the overtime win in Tennessee, Tomlinson got up and walked away immediately after Rivers sat near to him on the bench. Both players downplayed the incident, with Tomlinson explaining that he had left because he had just finished a conversation with Neal.

While Tomlinson&#x27;s rushing statistics of 1,474 yards and 15 touchdowns were both well short of his 2006 performances, he still led the league in both areas, and became the first player since Edgerrin James in 1999 and 2000 to win back-to-back rushing titles. During that year, Tomlinson became the 23rd player to reach 10,000 rushing yards in NFL history, as well as the fourth fastest, while his career-opening streak of seven consecutive seasons with at least 1,200 rushing yards had previously been achieved only by Eric Dickerson. With 60 receptions for a further 475 yards and 3 touchdowns, Tomlinson ranked second in the NFL for both yards from scrimmage (1,949) and total touchdowns (18). He had zero fumbles for the first time in his career, despite a league-high 375 touches. Tomlinson was nominated for his fifth and final Pro Bowl and, unanimously, his third and final AP 1st-Team All-Pro squad. He was also awarded the Bart Starr Award for his work on and off the field.

Tomlinson had 21 carries for 42 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown and caught three passes for 19 receiving yards in the Chargers&#x27; 17–6 Wild Card Round victory over the Tennessee Titans. He scored his touchdown on fourth and goal with San Diego leading 10–6 in the final quarter, leaping over the pile and reaching across the goal line. It was the Chargers&#x27; first playoff win since the 1994 AFC Championship Game, and the first of Tomlinson&#x27;s career. He said of the result, &quot;It didn&#x27;t come easy, but I tell you, I&#x27;m just happy to get that first one.&quot; The following week, Tomlinson carried seven times for 28 rushing yards and caught a 20-yard pass, before injuring his knee and leaving the game in the second quarter of the Chargers 28–24 Divisional Round win against the Indianapolis Colts. The injury proved to be a medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain.

Tomlinson attempted to play through his injury in the following week&#x27;s AFC Championship, and had two carries for five rushing yards and a one-yard catch but re-injured the knee and sat out the rest of the game. The Chargers lost to the New England Patriots, 21–12. Tomlinson was criticized for sitting on the Chargers&#x27; bench with his helmet and a dark visor still over his head, as well as for failing to play through the injury, in contrast to Rivers, who played the whole game. Hall of Fame ex-NFL cornerback Deion Sanders, then working for the NFL Network, said, &quot;Now what&#x27;s the problem? You&#x27;re a big-time player, and big-time players must play big-time games.&quot; Tomlinson called the comments ridiculous, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s never been a running back and had a sprained MCL.&quot; During the game, the Chargers notified the press box that Tomlinson was set to return, adding to the perception that his injury was not serious. Turner defended Tomlinson, saying, &quot;I know some of it goes back on us in terms of how it was communicated during the game ... If that injury would have happened in week 2, he probably would have missed six weeks.&quot;

==== 2008 season ====

Neal, who had missed time in 2007 with a broken fibula, was released by the Chargers during the offseason, leaving rookies Mike Tolbert and Jacob Hester to serve as Tomlinson&#x27;s lead blockers. Tomlinson himself declared his knee to 100% recovered after offseason rehabilitation, but jammed his big toe during an opening day 26–24 loss to the Carolina Panthers. The new injury persisted throughout the season. In week 4, Tomlinson had 13 carries for 31 yards through the first three quarters, and the Chargers trailed 15–3 in Oakland. He added seven carries for 75 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the fourth quarter, helping San Diego to a 28–18 win. That was one of only two 100-rushing performances by Tomlinson all season. The Chargers also struggled as a team during a 4–8 start, but won three consecutive games to set up a winner-takes-all week 17 game against Denver for the AFC West title. Tomlinson rushed 14 times for 96 rushing yards, and had what would be the final three-touchdown game of his career as San Diego won 52–21. However, he picked up a groin injury while scoring the last touchdown and again entered the playoffs carrying an injury.

Tomlinson ended the regular season with career-lows in attempts (292) and rushing yards (1,110, ranking tenth in the league), while his 11 rushing touchdowns (seventh in the league) and 3.8 yards per carry were both the least since his rookie year. His 344 touches, 1,536 scrimmage yards, and 12 total touchdowns also represented a clear drop from the previous season. The Charger offense became more focused on Rivers, who led the league in touchdowns and passer rating while throwing for over 4,000 yards.

In the Wild Card Round against the Colts, Tomlinson rushed five times for 25 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown before his groin injury forced him out of the game. His replacement Darren Sproles ran for over 100 yards and scored the game-winning touchdown in overtime as San Diego won 23–17. Tomlinson revealed after the game that his injury, previously reported as a strain, was actually a torn tendon; he described it as the toughest injury of his career. The following week, Tomlinson was unable to play at all in the Chargers&#x27; Divisional Round game in Pittsburgh, a 35–24 defeat.

==== 2009 season ====


The offseason began with contract negotiations for Tomlinson, as Smith and Spanos hoped to restructure his existing contract and free up more salary cap space. Relations between Smith and Tomlinson were strained throughout the process. Smith was reported to have been angered when Tomlinson revealed the full extent of his injury before the Divisional Round game against Pittsburgh the prior season. When Tomlinson release a statement expressing his desire to remain in San Diego, Smith appeared to mock him when he responded to an interview question using very similar wording. Smith later apologized to Tomlinson, and the two sides came to an agreement on a restructured version of his three-year contract on March 10. Tomlinson said in another statement, &quot;My heart has always been in San Diego. I couldn&#x27;t imagine putting on another uniform.&quot;

In week 1, Tomlinson rushed 13 times for 55 yards in Oakland, with a touchdown and a lost fumble in the 24–20 victory. It would be the only time all season that he averaged over four yards per carry in a game. He suffered an ankle injury in the Oakland game and missed the next two weeks while recovering. In his first game back, he rushed seven times for 15 yards in a 38–28 loss at Pittsburgh. His most productive rushing performance came in week 10 against Philadelphia, when he ran 24 times for 96 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 31–23 victory. The touchdowns gave him a total of 146 for his career, passing Marcus Allen for third place in NFL history. In week 13, Tomlinson scored his 150th career touchdown in a 30–23 win at Cleveland; he was the quickest to reach that milestone, doing so in his 137th game. He rushed for 64 yards in the game, enough to lift him past both Marshall Faulk and former Cleveland Brown Jim Brown into eighth place on the career rushing yardage list. Brown was present in the stadium; Tomlinson pointed up to Brown after passing him and tapped his heart to show respect. Brown visited the Charger locker room to give his congratulations after the game.

At the regular season&#x27;s end, Tomlinson had new career lows in rushing attempts (223), yards (730) and yards per attempt (3.3), as well as receptions (20) and receiving yards (154). Two years after his second rushing title, he ranked only 29th in the league for rushing yards, although his 12 rushing touchdowns were joint-fifth in the league. That gave him nine consecutive 10-touchdown seasons, a record. San Diego&#x27;s offensive line was impacted by injuries during the season, and the team as a whole averaged a league-worst 3.3 yards per rushing attempt; by contrast, their 8.0 yards per pass play led the league. Despite Tomlinson&#x27;s limited contributions, San Diego finished the season with 11 straight wins, a 13–3 record, and their fifth AFC West title in six seasons. Tomlinson stated that he had accepted his reduced role in the team.

Tomlinson&#x27;s last playoff game with the Chargers was similar to his first: a three-point defeat at home against the New York Jets, this time by a 17–14 margin. Tomlinson had little impact on the game, with 12 carries for 24 yards and three receptions for no yards. He was booed by Chargers fans after what would be his final carry for the team, a 1-yard gain in the final quarter. He said of the defeat, &quot;To lose this game, I&#x27;m at a loss for words.&quot;

==== Departure from San Diego ====

On January 31, Tomlinson was named to the NFL&#x27;s 2000s All-Decade Team after leading the league with 12,490 rushing yards in the 2000s, 1,797 more than runner-up Edgerrin James. His 138 rushing touchdowns during the decade set an NFL record for any decade, and were 38 more than any other player in the 2000s. However, there was speculation as to whether Tomlinson would play for the Chargers again, with the player himself saying that he expected to be let go.

The Chargers released Tomlinson on February 22, 2010, after nine seasons with the team. Many experts attributed his decline to his age (30) and injuries. In his farewell news conference, Tomlinson said his production declined after the 2006 season when Schottenheimer departed. He felt that the team&#x27;s focus on running dropped under Turner; in a later interview, he said, &quot;In San Diego, everything was taken away from me. There wasn&#x27;t an emphasis on running the ball, my best fullback (Neal) was gone, the linemen were pass blocking, we had a passing coach.&quot; &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; wrote in response that Tomlinson enjoyed success in his rookie season with Turner as offensive coordinator, as well as in Turner&#x27;s first season as San Diego&#x27;s head coach in 2007. The article also cited Turner&#x27;s history of coaching 1,000-yard rushers, including Emmitt Smith&#x27;s three NFL rushing titles. A. J. Smith commented, “It’s the team that will win a world championship, not a bunch of individuals.” Tomlinson later clarified that he had not been questioning his offensive line&#x27;s ability to run block; he expressed a desire to eventually retire as a Charger, but acknowledged a rocky relationship with Smith and stated he felt disrespected by Smith&#x27;s past comments.

=== New York Jets ===
==== 2010 season ====

Tomlinson entered the free-agent market for the first time in his career, expressing excitement at the future and a desire to win a Super Bowl. After the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings emerged as Tomlinson&#x27;s most likely destinations, he met with both teams and signed a two-year, $5.2 million contract with the Jets on March 14, 2010. He was expected to back up second-year running back Shonn Greene; the Jets had released five-time 1,000 yard rusher Thomas Jones the previous month when he refused to take a pay cut to serve as Greene&#x27;s backup. Tomlinson chose to sign with New York because of his familiarity with the system of offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer, his enthusiasm for the defense- and run-focussed philosophy of head coach Rex Ryan, and because he felt that the team offered him the best chance to win a championship. He added that he believed he and Green would form a successful partnership.

The Jets lost 10–9 to the Baltimore Ravens on Tomlinson&#x27;s debut; he rushed 11 times for 62 yards, and was the only Jets running back to have a carry after Greene lost a fumble in the second quarter. In week 4, Tomlinson recorded his first 100-yard rushing game in nearly two years against the Buffalo Bills, running 19 times for 133 yards and two touchdowns in the 38–14 victory. He said of the performance, &quot;I never lost confidence. I always knew I could do it. It was just about having an opportunity.&quot; For his game against the Bills, Tomlinson earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week. Tomlinson&#x27;s first five games of the season were his most productive in terms of rushing yards, as he ranked fifth in the league with 435 yards at 5.7 yards per carry.

While Tomlinson&#x27;s output reduced over the remainder of the season, he nonetheless improved upon his last year with the Chargers by rushing for 914 yards at 4.2 yards per carry, while catching 52 passes for 368 yards. Tomlinson stayed injury-free, missing only the regular season finale when he was rested with the Jets assured of a wildcard appearance in the playoffs. He did score less frequently than in any of his seasons in San Diego, with only six touchdowns. Brought in to complement Greene, Tomlinson was the Jet&#x27;s leading rusher, outgaining his backfield partner by 148 yards from 34 more carries. As a team, the Jets ranked fourth in the NFL for rushing yards (though they had been first in 2009) and 11th for total yardage (up from 20th in 2009). He continued to move up the NFL&#x27;s career rushing yardage leaderboard during the season, passing Tony Dorsett and Eric Dickerson to reach sixth place. He received the Dennis Byrd Award as the Jets&#x27; most inspirational player after a vote of his teammates.

The Jets opened their postseason campaign with a 17–16 win at Indianapolis in the AFC Wild Card Round. Tomlinson rushed 16 times for 82 and both Jets touchdowns, and New York won on a 23-yard Nick Folk field goal as time expired. Tomlinson recorded his best rushing output since week 5. Next, the Jets travelled to New England for the Divisional Round. They were heavy underdogs, having lost 45–3 to the Patriots in week 13; Tomlinson spoke of the matchup as an opportunity to redeem himself after having to leave the AFC Championship Game against the same team three seasons earlier. He rushed ten times for 43 yards, and caught a seven-yard touchdown from Mark Sanchez in a 28–21 win. In the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Jets were down 24–10 in the fourth quarter when Tomlinson was unable to score a touchdown on a fourth-and-goal from the one-yard line. The Jets went on to lose 24–19; Tomlinson finished with nine carries for 16 rushing yards.

==== 2011 season ====

Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum said after the 2010 season that he expected Tomlinson back for 2011 but &quot;things could change.&quot; With Greene designated as the starting running back for 2011, Tomlinson began the season as a third-down back with more emphasis on being a receiver. In the season-opening win over the Dallas Cowboys, he rushed only five times for 16 rushing yards but caught six passes for 73 receiving yards in the 27–24 victory. Tomlinson, who was 32 years old at the start of the season, said that running routes out of the backfield was something he&#x27;d always wanted to do as he got older, and that he embraced the change. The opening game set the pattern for the season, as he went on to gain more yardage by receiving than rushing in nine of the fourteen games that he played. In week 3, Tomlinson had the third 100-yard receiving game of his career, catching five passes for 116 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown in a 34–24 loss at Oakland to continue the pattern of success against the Raiders he had established as a Charger. In the game against Oakland, Tomlinson tied his career-high for longest receiving play with a 74-yard reception. In week 7, he faced his former team for the only time in a 27–21 victory for the Jets in New York. Missing part of the game due to illness, he gained 51 yards from scrimmage; of beating the Chargers after they&#x27;d released him, he commented, &quot;I&#x27;d be lying if I said this didn&#x27;t add some extra satisfaction.&quot;

In week 10 against New England, Tomlinson passed Barry Sanders (18,190 yards) for fifth on the all time yards from scrimmage list, though he picked up a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury during that game and missed the next two contests against Denver and Buffalo. In his second game back after the injury, Tomlinson scored the 162nd and final touchdown of his career, on a 19-yard catch from Sanchez. In week 14, the Jets defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 37–10 to improve their record to 8–5, but lost their following two games to the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants, and needed to win their regular season finale at Miami to have any chance of making the playoffs. In the game, Tomlinson had his most rushing attempts (11) and yards (56) of the season, adding 4 catches for 23 yards. However, New York lost to Miami by a score of 19–17, ending their season. Tomlinson made a final move up the career rushing yards leaderboard during the game, passing Jerome Bettis (13,662) for fifth place.

Tomlinson finished his final season with 75 carries for 280 rushing yards and a single rushing touchdown, all career lows. Greene, now the main running back, had over 1,000 yards, but the Jets rushing attack was ranked only 22nd in the league, while their offense as a whole was 25th. Tomlinson&#x27;s new pass-catching role yielded 42 catches for 449 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns; he averaged 10.7 yards per reception, a career-high. His teammates again voted him the winner of the Dennis Byrd Award.

=== Retirement ===
Tomlinson&#x27;s contract with the Jets expired after the 2011 season. In the aftermath of the season-ending loss in Miami, he said that he would need three or four weeks to decide whether to retire or not. On May 11, Tomlinson returned to Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego to speak at a memorial for former Charger Junior Seau, who had been a positive influence on Tomlinson during his rookie season. On June 18, he signed a ceremonial one-day contract with the San Diego Chargers and then immediately announced his retirement. Chargers president Dean Spanos said that no other Charger would ever wear Tomlinson&#x27;s No. 21.

Former teammates including Rivers, Gates and three offensive linemen from his 2006 season were present at Tomlinson&#x27;s farewell press conference, as were his wife, mother and children. Recalling the words of Seau at his own retirement, Tomlinson described the act as graduating to the next phase of his life. Of his failure to win a Super Bowl, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m OK with never winning a Super Bowl championship. I know we&#x27;ve got many memories that we can call championship days.&quot;
=== Legacy and playing style ===

At the time of his retirement, Tomlinson ranked fifth in NFL history in career rushing attempts (3,174) and yards (13,684), and second in career rushing touchdowns (145). He had 47 100-yard rushing games, and three 100-yard receiving games. He also ranked third for receptions by a running back, catching 624 passes for 4,772 yards and a further 17 touchdowns. Overall, he ranked fourth in career touches (3,798), fifth in yards from scrimmage (18,456), and third in total touchdowns (162). He was only the second player to rush for at least 13,000 yards and catch passes for at least 4,000 yards, following Payton. Completing his reputation as a versatile back, Tomlinson completed 8 of 12 passing attempts in his career for seven touchdowns and no interceptions. Only Payton, with eight, had more touchdown passes among non-quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era. His playoff performances were less impressive, as he was injured in 2007 and 2008 and only rushed for 100 yards once in ten postseason games.
Tomlinson was noted for consistently playing well against the Oakland Raiders. In nineteen games against them, he rushed for 2,055 yards, at an average of 108.2 yards per game, well above his career average of 80.5 yards per game. He also rushed for 22 touchdowns, caught four, and threw another three, in each case more than his total against any other single team.

An elusive runner in the open field who would use stiff arms to break tackles, Tomlinson was also effective as a power back on inside runs. In goal-line situations, he would often leap directly over the line of scrimmage to score. He wore a distinctive dark visor for the majority of his career, to prevent migraines caused by stadiums lights; this benefitted him as it prevented defenders from reading his eyes. When scoring, Tomlinson would frequently perform his own &quot;teardrop&quot; celebration, placing his left hand behind his head and flipping the ball with his right. He was often known by his initials, L.T., a nickname he shared with Hall of Fame New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor.

In 2005, Schottenheimer described Tomlinson as the finest running back he&#x27;d seen, arguing that past greats such as Jim Brown and Gale Sayers hadn&#x27;t had to contend with defenders of the same size and speed. When Tomlinson&#x27;s number was retired in 2015, a trio of analysts on NFL.com placed him 3rd, 7th, and 8th respectively on their lists of top running backs in the Super Bowl era. In 2021, the statistical site Pro-Football-Reference.com ranked him as the fifth-best running back in NFL history. An NFL Network show, &quot;The Top 100: NFL&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot;, aired in 2010 and ranked Tomlinson No. 61 among all positions, while a 2019 USA Today poll placed him at No. 54. However, he was not among the ten running backs named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

The Chargers formally retired his number in 2015, while also inducting him into their Hall of Fame. Tomlinson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017, his first year of eligibility. After thanking his family, as well as former coaches and teammates, Tomlinson spoke about his ancestors who had worked as slaves in a plantation in Tomlinson Hill and issued a call for racial unity, saying, &quot;On America&#x27;s team, let&#x27;s not choose to be against one another. Let&#x27;s choose to be for one another. My great‑great‑great‑grandfather had no choice. We have one. I pray we dedicate ourselves to be the best team we can be, working and living together, representing the highest ideals of mankind, leading the way for all nations to follow.&quot;

==Personal life==
Tomlinson is a Christian. Tomlinson was introduced to his future wife, LaTorsha Oakley, while the two were students at TCU. The couple married on March 21, 2003, and have two children: a son born in 2010 and a daughter in 2011. In 2007, Tomlinson&#x27;s father Oliver Tomlinson and brother-in-law Ronald McClain died in an auto accident.

During his playing career, Tomlinson was featured in commercials for Nike, Campbell Soup, and Vizio. In April 2007, CNBC reported that Tomlinson turned down a request to become the cover athlete for EA Sports&#x27; &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot; video game, as the money offered was not enough to justify the promotional work involved.

In August 2012, Tomlinson joined the cast of NFL Network&#x27;s Sunday morning show &quot;First on the Field&quot; as an analyst. As of 2022, he is still with the network. He covers Chargers preseason games as an analyst with CBS.

Tomlinson wrote the foreword for Chris Tomlinson&#x27;s book &quot;Tomlinson Hill&quot;, which traces the story of two families—one white and one black—from a plantation in Tomlinson Hill, Texas. The plantation was owned by Chris&#x27; great-great-grandparents, while LaDainian descended from a slave owned by Chris&#x27; ancestors. In 2016, Tomlinson was cast in the feature film &quot;God Bless the Broken Road&quot;. While originally announced for a 2016 release, it was finally released in September 2018.

Tomlinson has his own charitable foundation. The foundation helps high school and college students, provides meals for people who are homeless or poor, and raises money for after-school programs and other causes. It focuses its efforts in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Texas. The charity was cited as a reason for Tomlinson receiving the Bart Starr Award in 2008.

In 2017, the Los Angeles Chargers announced that Tomlinson was joining the team as a special assistant to ownership. The role involves attempting to build a new fanbase after the Chargers&#x27; move to Los Angeles.

Tomlinson&#x27;s nephew, Tre Tomlinson, followed in his footsteps by playing at TCU, where he earned All-Big 12 honors three times playing cornerback and won the Jim Thorpe Award in 2022 as the nation&#x27;s best defensive back. Tre was drafted in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL draft by the Los Angeles Rams.

<text>The Jacksonville Port Terminal Railroad is a short line terminal railroad run by Watco. It serves the Jacksonville Port Authority and tenants with over ten miles of track. It has only one main line, running west from the &quot;Tallyrand Marine Terminal&quot; on the St Johns River to an interchange with CSX and Norfolk Southern northeast of downtown Jacksonville, Florida. Formerly known as the Talleyrand Terminal Railroad. Operations began on July 28, 1996, under that name. On March 8, 2017, Watco bought the railroad and renamed it the Jacksonville Port Terminal Railroad.

<text>Slurpee is the brand name for carbonated slushies sold by 7-Eleven and its subsidiaries A-Plus, Speedway, &amp; Stripes Convenience Stores. The brand originated in 1966 when 7-Eleven made a licensing deal with The Icee Company to sell slushies in 7-Eleven stores.

==History==
Omar Knedlik invented machines to make frozen beverages in the late 1950s. The idea for a slushed ice drink came when Knedlik&#x27;s soda fountain broke down, forcing him to put his sodas in a freezer to stay cool, which caused them to become slushy. The result was popular with customers, which gave him the idea to make a machine to help make a &quot;slushy&quot; from carbonated beverages. When it became popular, Knedlik hired an artist named Ruth E. Taylor to create a name and a logo for his invention. She created the Icee name and designed the original logo, which is still used today. Early prototypes for the machine made use of an automobile air conditioning unit.

After a successful trial of Icee machines in 100 stores, 7-Eleven made a licensing deal with The Icee Company to sell the product under certain conditions in 1965. Two of these were that 7-Eleven must use a different name for the product, and that the company was allowed to sell the product only in 7-Eleven locations in the US, a non-compete clause ensuring the two drinks never went head to head for distribution rights. 7-Eleven then sold the product that in 1966 became known as the &quot;Slurpee&quot; (for the sound made when drinking them). The term was coined by Bob Stanford, a 7-Eleven advertisement agency director.

The Slurpee machine has a separate spout, or spigot, for each flavor at the front of a tumbler or freezer. To the right of the spouts is a small table and a tray with various snacks. Above the tray with snacks are the cups, lids and straws customers can take with their Slurpees. Sizes include Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large. When Slurpees were first introduced, the dispensing machine was located behind the counter, and the clerk dispensed the product. Common Slurpee flavors are frozen Cherry, Blue Raspberry, Coca-Cola, and Mountain Dew, but new flavors are introduced regularly. In the Slurpee&#x27;s early history, flavors rotated much more frequently than today. Slurpee flavors were given novelty names such as Pink Fink, Adults Only, Moonshine, Kissin&#x27; Cousin, Gully Washer, Sticky Icky, and Redeye.

In 1990, Dallas-based Southland Corporation, 7-Eleven&#x27;s founder and US operator, went bankrupt, but 7-Eleven Japan, and its parent Ito-Yokado, bought 70% of Southland in 1991 for $430 million and quickly launched renovations of the US stores. As a result, the US chains became more efficient, although 1,218 stores are closed. Following the Japanese model, the new 7-Eleven stores set up a weekly system to monitor inventories to ensure popular items are always in stock.

Following their respective acquisitions by 7-Eleven, A-Plus and Speedway both started selling Slurpee-branded drinks prior to their conversion to 7-Eleven. Many fans of Speedway&#x27;s own frozen drink, Speedy Freeze, complained on social media about the drink being replaced by Slurpee-branded products, although other frozen drink fans have said the two drinks are identical.

==Worldwide consumption==
More than 11.6 million Slurpee drinks are consumed around the world each day. Forty percent of Slurpees are sold during June, July and August. Enough drinks are sold each year to fill 12 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Canadians purchase an average of 30 million Slurpee drinks per year. Winnipeg was crowned the Slurpee Capital of the World for the twentieth year in a row in 2019. 7-Eleven stores across Winnipeg sell an average of 188,833 Slurpee drinks per month. The rest of Canada sells an average of 179,700 per month, which makes Winnipeggers the world leader of Slurpee sales. Unlike their counterparts in America, Canadian Slurpees do not contain yucca extract which gives it the airy consistency American Slurpees are known for.
6.6 million Slurpee drinks are sold in Australia each year.

==Kosher status==
The Diet Pepsi flavor uses sodium caseinate as an anti-freezing agent (sugar is a natural antifreeze in other flavors) which gives it the status of kosher dairy. The Piña Colada, Twizzler Strawberry, Tropicana Grape Wild Strawberry, and Monster Black flavors are not kosher. The Chicago Rabbinical Council keeps an updated list of kosher flavors on its website.

==Promotions==

In 1965–66, Icee transitioned to Slurpee in 7-Eleven stores and sales. By the spring of 1967, Slurpee machines were in all 7-Eleven stores.

In 1967, Top 40 AM radio stations were losing market share to FM stations. DJs were desperate to gain audience attention. Slurpee was a kid / teen / young adult product, the main AM radio audience. The Stanford Agency created a &quot;media blitz&quot; to launch Slurpee and flew agency staff to all Top 40 markets with 7-Eleven stores to introduce Slurpee and the comedy commercials with funny voices and sound effects that told stories about the &quot;Strange Things That Happened To People Who Slurp&quot;. The agency backed the Slurpee launch with a very large media budget. DJs used &quot;drops&quot; or snippets from the &quot;crazy&quot; commercials in their programs to gain audience share. The campaign became an AM radio sensation.

The Stanford Agency followed the &quot;Strange Things&quot; launch with a campaign that threw away product names like lemon-lime, cola, grape, or other conventional descriptions, and instead created 26-weeks of :60 second commercials about Slurpees with &quot;Funny Names&quot; like Sticky Icky, Redeye, Moon Shine, Pink Fink, Adults Only, Kissin Cousin, and Gully Washer. These commercials were even more popular. Each flavor had a pin associated with it. There were pins made for the flavors. There was also a generic pin that simply stated &quot;I have Slurped&quot;.

In 1968, the Official Slurp Hat was offered.

In 1970, 7-Eleven released a 45 RPM 7&quot; single record entitled &quot;Dance the Slurp&quot; that was given away with Slurpee purchases. The dance side was written by Tom Merriman, one of the fathers of radio jingle production. The B-side was a comedy bit detailing &quot;strange things&quot; that happen to people who &quot;slurp&quot; at 7-Eleven. The record is considered highly collectible today. In 1999, &quot;Dance the Slurp&quot; was sampled by DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist for their mix album &quot;Brainfreeze&quot;.

Slurpee became the top selling 7-Eleven product and kids / teens / young adults came in regularly for the latest &quot;flavor&quot; with less and less promotional expense. After &quot;Funny Names,&quot; the next innovation was &quot;Slurpee Cups.&quot;

In 1972, &quot;Baseball Slurpee Cups,&quot; plastic cups with illustrations of favorite players including Johnny Bench, Pete Rose and others.

In 1973, Baseball Slurpee Cups, with illustrations of current stars and early players like Honus Wagner.

In 1973, the DC Comics Super Hero Cups, a 60 cup series.

&quot;1973 Endangered Species Cups&quot; – Congress passed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on December 14, 1973. This triggered 7-Eleven making an advanced of $250,000 representing 1-cent from the sale of more than 2-million &quot;Endangered Species Cups&quot; to the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) who purchased Bald Eagle habitat. The transfer of land to the U.S. Government and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service took place on December 19, 1974, and came to be known as the Carl E. Mundt National Wildlife Refuge.
In 1975, there was the Marvel Series, a 60-cup series, and in 1977, the Marvel &quot;Panoramic&quot; Super Hero series.

In 1994, 7-Eleven sought to remake Slurpee&#x27;s &quot;brain freeze&quot; campaign targeted to the adolescent MTV audience. The creative directors assigned the task of creating four new commercials to the Brothers Quay, and Boston-based Olive Jar Animation. Known for their bizarre aesthetic and influence in the stop-motion animations industry, the Quays based their &quot;brain freeze&quot; ad on a late 19th-century photograph of a female contortionist. In the commercial, a curtain reveals the contortionist balancing on two chairs, bending over backward to sip a Slurpee. She falls victim to &quot;brain freeze&quot; and turns into an ice cube.

Beginning in 1995, free Slurpee coupons have been made available through &quot;Operation Chill&quot; for US police officers to distribute to children.

In 1998, 7-Eleven launched Slurpee lip balm to the market. Other &quot;Slurpee-flavored&quot; products have included Slurpee gum, which had a liquid candy center.

In 2002, The World Wrestling Federation launched promotional cups featuring The Rock, Rob Van Dam, Lita with The Hardy Boyz, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Undertaker and Trish Stratus. The designs were on 40-ounce Slurpee cups and 34-ounce thermal mugs.

In 2004, 7-Eleven created an edible Slurpee straw.

In 2005, 7-Eleven promoted the film &quot;Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot;, by making a Mountain Dew Pitch Black &quot;Dark Side&quot; Slurpee which came in a cup shaped like Darth Vader&#x27;s helmet.

In 2007, as part of the Kwik-E-Mart promotion for the feature film &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, Slurpees at 7-Elevens were renamed &quot;Squishees&quot; (the analog in the &quot;Simpsons&quot; universe) and sold in special collector cups.

Starting on November 4, 2008, 7-Eleven worked with Nexon to promote Slurpees to gamers that play on Nexon.net. The Slurpee cups had images printed on them from certain Nexon games, and a code printed on them that could be redeemed on a website for special in-game items.

Also for professional wrestling WWE&#x27;s Summerslam 2010 7-Eleven offered collectible Slurpee cups of Rey Mysterio, John Cena, The Undertaker, Triple H, and Kelly Kelly. They also came with collectible straws with figures of each wrestler on them. The flavor used for the promotion was Barq&#x27;s Root Beer. As well as for the 2011 SummerSlam, which again featured Cena, The Miz, 2009 WWE Hall of Famer &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin, and The Rock. The flavor used for the promotion was Fanta&#x27;s Berry Citrus Slam.

Every year on July 11 (7/11, month/day), 7-Eleven offered a free 7.11 fluid ounce (210 ml) Slurpee in the US and Canada thru 2014. From 2015 to 2019 &amp; since 2021, the size increased to a 12-fluid ounce (355 ml) size. 7 Rewards members are given a free medium Slurpee loaded into their app in 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing 7-11 Day&#x27;s cancellation that year.

In Australia, free Slurpees are given on November 7 (7/11, day/month) to coincide with 7-Eleven day.

In 2010, 7-Eleven teamed up with Sony to create limited edition promotion cups for the PlayStation 3 games &quot;LittleBigPlanet 2&quot; and &quot;Killzone 3&quot;. In 2011, a Slurpee themed t-shirt was added as DLC to &quot;LittleBigPlanet 2&quot;.

Since July 7, 2011, 7-Eleven has partnered with Cinemark Theatres marking the first time Slurpees are sold outside its parent franchise. 32 theatres were chosen in Houston, Texas; Dallas, Texas; and Portland, Oregon. This marks the first reappearance of the Slurpee brand in the Houston metro area since 1990 (all 7-Elevens in the Houston area were sold to National Convenience Stores that owned Stop-n-Go; all Houston-area 7-Elevens were rebranded as Stop-n-Gos until Diamond Shamrock acquired the franchise in the late 1990s, now part of the Valero conglomerate of crude oil refineries and retail convenience stores most commonly operated under the Valero brand with generic names, though some Texas-area stores retained Corner Store branding held over from the Valero purchase of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock in 2001).

2012 had the Slurpee being sold at the Six Flags amusement parks chain in a marketing agreement to promote the product in 10 states.

In Australia on September 21, 2011, customers could bring in their own cups (or container, regardless of size) and fill it full of Slurpee for only $2.60 (a portion of the price of a Super Slurpee) as long as it would fit through a cutout hole limiting the size. This did not stop people from receiving up to and above 5 liters of Slurpee for less than the price of a Super Slurpee. This event was known as Bring Your Own Cup Day.

Since April 11, 2015, Bring Your Own Cup Day in U.S locations originally occurred once annually since 2022; semi-annually from 2016 to 2017. Slurpee fans could come in and enjoy any size cup, that fit through the cutout hole, for only $1.49 the first 2 years. This promotion occurred again on August 19–20, 2016 in honor of the Slurpee&#x27;s 50th anniversary. It returned on May 19–20, 2017, but the price was $1.50 plus tax, and returned once more on August 18–19. Late August 2022 saw its return, but is priced at $1.99 plus tax. There was no Bring Your Own Cup Day promotion in 2020-21.

On November 7, 2015, 7-Eleven stores in the USA celebrated the giving season with Name Your Own Price Day for Small Slurpee drinks. Net proceeds from all Large Slurpee purchases were donated to Feeding America to support local food banks.

Since May 2018, as a result of the 7-Eleven - Sunoco LP agreement, existing Stripes Convenience Stores (now part of the 7-Eleven business portfolio) rebranded its Slush Monkey frozen beverage to the Slurpee brand. Since the rebranding, the 40 ounce Slurpee cup usually sold at 7-Eleven locations is absent from Stripes since the cup dispensers were designed for three sizes - S, M, and L.

<text>, Op. 214, is a polka in A major by Johann Strauss II, written in 1858 after a successful tour of Russia where he performed in the summer concert season at Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg. It was first performed in a concert in Vienna on 24 November 1858.

 (chit-chat) refers to the Viennese passion for gossip. Strauss may also have been referencing the burlesque &quot; by the famous Austrian dramatist and actor Johann Nestroy, which premiered in 1833 and was still in the stage repertoire when the polka was written.

The mood of the piece is jaunty and high-spirited, as were many of Strauss&#x27; polkas.

<text>Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel (; February 1629 – February 1719) was a Scottish soldier and the 17th chief of Clan Cameron. He fought during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and was one the principal Jacobite leaders during the 1689 Rising. He is regarded as one of the most formidable Scottish clan chiefs of all time, with Lord Macaulay praising him as the &quot;Ulysses of the Highlands&quot;. An incident demonstrating his strength and ferocity in single combat, when he bit out the throat of an enemy, is used by Sir Walter Scott in &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; (canto v.).

== Early years ==

Ewen Cameron of Lochiel was born in February 1629 at Kilchurn Castle, Loch Awe, the seat of his mother&#x27;s family. He was the son of John Cameron (died 1635) and Margaret Campbell, daughter of Sir Robert Campbell, 3rd Baronet. He was the grandson of Allan Cameron of Lochiel, 16th Chief (c. 1567–1647), an elderly chief respected for many affrays.

His father having predeceased him, Ewen was initially fostered by his brethren, the MacMartins of Letterfinlay, but then spent much of his youth under the &quot;guardianship&quot; (as a hostage to keep the Camerons in check) of the Marquess of Argyll at Inveraray, by whose instruction he was tutored. He was said to have been excessively fond of hunting, duelling and fencing—less inclined towards his books—yet still bore great intelligence and cunning.

In 1647, he succeeded his grandfather as the chief of the Camerons, being one of the most important Highland clans.

== Appearance and character ==
Lord Lovat, who was at the court of Versailles, claimed that Lochiel bore a striking resemblance to Louis XIV, stating that &quot;the resemblance was nearer than commonly that between two brothers; with this difference, that Sir Ewen was of a darker complexion, more brawny, and of a larger size&quot;. Lord Macaulay, although a Whig, wrote in praise of Lochiel, stating &quot;Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel was in personal qualities unrivalled among the Celtic Princes. He was a gracious master, a trusty ally, a terrible enemy&quot;. He was described as the &quot;Ulysses of the Highlands&quot; by Macaulay in reference to enormous strength and size.

James Philip of Almerieclos, a standard-bearer in the 1689 rebellion, describes Lochiel&#x27;s intimidating appearance and &quot;Spanish countenance&quot;, with &quot;flashing eyes and a moustache curled as the moon horns&quot;.

== Wars of the Three Kingdoms ==

=== Montrose ===
The Camerons were always strong supporters of the House of Stuart. Ewen, Master of Lochiel witnessed the Battle of Inverlochy in 1645 during which his grandfather sent 300 highlanders to Montrose&#x27;s aid, while he was forced to accompany Argyll. That same year, he also witnessed Philiphaugh, the disastrous Royalist defeat. It is said that he developed Royalist sympathies after a secret meeting with Sir Robert Spottiswood on the eve of his execution by the Covenanters. Furthermore, like many others, he was greatly inspired by James Graham, Marquis of Montrose.

When Allan Cameron of Lochiel died in 1647, Lochiel finally left the clutches of Argyll and returned to his homeland of Lochaber, whence he was received joyously by his clansfolk. However Macdonald of Keppoch and Macdonald of Glengarry, thinking they could manipulate the novice Cameron chief, refused to pay their annual tribute to Lochiel who, in response, marched several hundred of his clansmen and forced the rebellious Macdonalds of Lochaber into submission.

In April, 1650, Montrose was defeated at Carbisdale, betrayed, and shortly thereafter, hanged, drawn and quartered at Argyll&#x27;s orders. Later that year, Lochiel received word from the exiled King Charles, requesting that he rally his men and join the Royalist army assembling at Stirling, whose defeat at Inverkeithing in 1651 led to Charles&#x27;s fatal march to Worcester.

== Interregnum period ==
=== Glencairn&#x27;s Rising ===
Lochiel was present at a meeting of Scottish nobles at Lochearn in August, 1653, in which they elected to rebel against the Protectorate and restore the exiled King Charles to the throne. As such, he joined the army of William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn in the Royalist rising of 1653 to 1654, bringing with him several hundred Cameron warriors.

At the Battle of Tullich on 10 February 1654, Lochiel was second-in-command to Glencairn and had the honour of commanding the outpost. He held the mountainous pass with his highlanders against the numerically superior forces of Robert Lilburne who was ultimately forced to retreat. He was personally commended by King Charles for his actions at Tullich, and hailed as the &quot;deliverer of the Highland army&quot;.

=== Further resistance ===
Lochiel continued fighting with Glencairn until 1654, when the latter was arrested for duelling and replaced in command by John Middleton. Among those involved in affrays was Lochiel&#x27;s future father-in-law David Barclay, an officer serving under Middleton. At the same time, George Monck became Governor of Scotland and kept the rebels hemmed in the Highlands. In a form of guerrilla warfare, Lochiel continued to resist for the next four years, becoming a paragon of Royalist resistance in the Highlands.

A famous fight between Lochiel and a roundhead occurred during this period. He had encountered a group of Monck&#x27;s soldiers gathering firewood by Loch Eil, deep into Cameron territory, and a skirmish ensued. Lochiel became separated from his men and grappled with an English officer who threw him onto his back. Supposedly, Lochiel lunged at his victim&#x27;s throat, biting down viciously and not letting go until he had torn out his windpipe for the &quot;&#x27;sweetest bite ever he had&quot;.&#x27; He then proceeded to massacre a number of the garrison at Fort William and have their bodies mutilated and displayed as warning.

Previously based at Tor Castle, Lochiel built a new seat at Achnacarry in 1655 in order to keep his men further away from the government troops. It was only upon the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658 that he did submit to general Monck and was received for his chivalrous conduct during the Civil War. Soon after, Lochiel accompanied Monck to London where the General called a meeting of Parliament to discuss the new status quo. After lengthy discussion and debate it was decided that the King would be invited back from exile and that the Royal House of Stuart would be restored to the throne after a Republican Interregnum period.

== Restoration period ==

=== Mackintosh feud ===

Clan Cameron and Clan Mackintosh had been involved in a bitter, 360-year feud which began over the disputed lands of Loch Arkaig in Lochaber. On 20 September 1665, Lochiel ended this infamous feud with Clan Mackintosh after the stand-off at the Fords of Arkaig near Achnacarry. After this he was responsible for keeping the peace between his clansmen and their former enemies. However in 1668, whilst he was away at court in London, a feud broke out between Clan Donald and hostile elements of Clan Mackintosh, who headed the confederation of clans known as Clan Chattan. Lochiel’s clansmen contributed to the MacDonald victory against the Mackintosh’ at the Battle of Mulroy, often considered to be the last clan battle.

=== Last Scottish wolf ===

In 1680 while hunting in Killiecrankie, Perthshire (or in Lochaber according to other accounts) Lochiel was said to have killed the last wolf in Scotland.

=== At Achnacarry and Court ===
The famous exploits of Lochiel were recited by Gaelic bards at his newly-built house of Achnacarry. One such bard described Achnacarry as &quot;the generous house of feasting, pillared hall of princes, where wine goes round freely in gleaming glasses, music resounding under its rafters.&quot;

In 1681, Lochiel was knighted by James, Duke of York (later James II and VII). According to Balhaldie, after complimenting him on the successful outcome of his feud with the Mackintosh, he asked for Lochiel&#x27;s sword and attempted to draw it unsuccessfully; the Duke, after a second attempt gave it back to Lochiel and said &quot;that his sword never used to be so uneasy to draw when the crown wanted his services&quot;. Lochiel unsheathed the sword and offered it to the Duke, who thereupon knighted him.

== Jacobite period ==
The Glorious Revolution was a disaster for Lochiel and Clan Cameron, whose support had always been for the Stuart monarchy. In 1688, the Stuart King James VII and II was overthrown by William of Orange (In 1714, the Stuarts were then replaced by the Hanoverians). Lochiel, as a fervent Stuart loyalist, became one of the principal commanders in the Jacobite rising of 1689, having managed to rally a confederation of Highland clans loyal to that cause.

Commanding his force of highlanders, Lochiel fought with John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee (better known as &quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot;) at the Battle of Killiecrankie – a stunning victory marred by Claverhouse’s death. The Jacobite rebellion collapsed soon after as a result of Claverhouse&#x27;s death, arguments among the remaining leaders and the inept military leadership of Alexander Cannon. By this time Sir Ewen, nearly sixty years old, had started to give his son John Cameron, Master of Lochiel greater responsibilities as he was unable to participate physically in military action. John Cameron led the clan for the remainder of the 1689 rebellion, and later also for the 1715 and 1719 risings.

In 1717, John Cameron was made Lord Lochiel in the Jacobite peerage by Prince James in recognition of Cameron loyalty to the Jacobite cause. 

== Death ==
Sir Ewen died of natural causes in 1719 at the age of ninety. He was buried with great ceremony at an ancient burial ground on the shores of Loch Eil. It was reported that thousands of Highlanders and thirteen pipers gathered to his funeral.

== Family ==
Sir Ewen married three times and had sixteen children.

<text>Dual piping is a system of plumbing installations used to supply both potable and reclaimed water to a home or business. Under this system, two completely separate water piping systems are used to deliver water to the user. This system prevents mixing of the two water supplies, which is undesirable, since reclaimed water is usually not intended for human consumption.

In the United States, reclaimed water is distributed in lavender (light purple) pipes, to alert users that the pipes contain non-potable water. Hong Kong has used a dual piping system for toilet flushing with sea water since the 1950s.

According to the El Dorado Irrigation District in California, the average dual-piped home used approximately of potable water in 2006. The average single family residence with traditional piping using potable water for irrigation as well as for domestic uses used between , higher elevation, and , lower elevation.

<doc id="1249859" wikidata="Q1535338" url="?curid=1249859" title="Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide">
<text>Ned&#x27;s Declassified School Survival Guide (sometimes shortened to Ned&#x27;s Declassified) is an American live action sitcom on Nickelodeon that debuted on the Nickelodeon Sunday night TEENick scheduling block on September 12, 2004. The series&#x27; original pilot episode aired on September 7, 2003, and it was ordered to series by Nickelodeon in early 2004. The one-hour special movie series finale aired on June 8, 2007.

The show was produced by Apollo ProScreen GmbH &amp; Co. Filmproduktion KG in association with Jack Mackie Pictures. Its main executive producer and creator is Scott Fellows, the head writer for &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; and creator of &quot;Johnny Test&quot;.

==Premise==
&quot;Ned&#x27;s Declassified School Survival Guide&quot; follows the lives of the titular character Ned Bigby, and his two best friends Jennifer &quot;Moze&quot; Mosely, and Simon &quot;Cookie&quot; Nelson-Cook, as they navigate their middle school years. The first season takes place during the first semester of seventh grade, the second season covers the second semester of seventh grade, and the third season takes place during eighth grade. Throughout the series, Ned builds up a number of &#x27;tips&#x27; for his &quot;survival guide&quot;, and uses the tips to help himself and his classmates cope with the standard struggles of middle school. Each individual episode relates to a topic in the guide, such as popularity, grades, or sports, as well as developing other plots (such as Ned&#x27;s love life) throughout.

==Episodes==

==Cast==
* Devon Werkheiser as Ned Bigby
* Lindsey Shaw as Jennifer &quot;Moze&quot; Mosely
* Daniel Curtis Lee as Simon &quot;Cookie&quot; Nelson-Cook
* Jim J. Bullock as Mr. Monroe (main role, season 1; recurring role, seasons 2–3)

==Locations==
The show takes place at the fictional James K. Polk Middle School, named after the 11th President of the United States, James K. Polk. The school&#x27;s colors are gold and green and its mascot is the Wolves, which is a common theme throughout the school&#x27;s interior.

During the first season, all of the show&#x27;s action took place within the school or its grounds, and with the exception of one or two notable occasions, everything happened indoors. However, during season 2, more outdoor shots were used, and on certain occasions, the show took place off school property. The show&#x27;s finale, for example, took place almost entirely off the school grounds.

==Reception==

===Ratings===
The debut of &quot;Ned&#x27;s Declassified School Survival Guide&quot; on September 12, 2004, received a 4.5 rating, with 914,000 tween viewers, which was described as &quot;healthy, but not as stellar&quot; ratings by &quot;Variety&quot;″s Denise Martin.

===Critical===
Robert Lloyd of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; upon reviewing the series finale of &quot;Ned&#x27;s Declassified School Survival Guide&quot; remarked that it was &quot;one of the best series on television — a show that took genre conventions and ran them through unpredictable changes&quot;.

==Proposed spin-off==
In June 2008, Werkheiser signed a development contract with Nickelodeon for a spin-off that would deal with his character&#x27;s adventures in high school. The show was never greenlit to production, due to the other major actors from the original series being busy with their own projects – creator and executive producer Scott Fellows was working on another Nickelodeon show, &quot;Big Time Rush&quot;; Daniel Curtis Lee was committed to Disney XD&#x27;s &quot;Zeke and Luther&quot;; and Lindsey Shaw was working as the lead on ABC Family&#x27;s &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;.

==Podcast==
In February 2023, Devon Werkheiser started a podcast called &quot;Ned&#x27;s Declassified Podcast Survival Guide&quot; with Lindsey Shaw and Daniel Curtis Lee under the network PodCo.

<text>&quot;Rosen aus dem Süden&quot; (&quot;Roses from the South&quot;), Op. 388, is a waltz medley composed by Johann Strauss II in 1880 with its themes drawn from the operetta &quot;Das Spitzentuch der Königin&quot; (&quot;The Queen&#x27;s Lace Handkerchief&quot;). Strauss dedicated the waltz to King Umberto I of Italy.

==First performance==
The waltz was first performed at the regular Sunday concerts of the Strauss Orchestra conducted by Eduard Strauss on 7 November 1880 at the Musikverein in Vienna. Its themes drawn from the operetta are the act 1 &quot;Trüffel-Couplet&quot; and the act 2 romance &quot;Wo die wilde Rose erblüht&quot; (&quot;Where the Wild Rose Blossoms&quot;). The act 2 romance inspired the title of the waltz.

== Instrumentation ==
The waltz is scored for an orchestra of 2 flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in C, 2 bassoons, 4 French horns in F, 2 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, timpani, snare drum, triangle, bass drum, cymbals, harp, and strings.

==Description==
The waltz ranks among the &quot;Waltz King&quot; &#x27;s most notable works and is still regularly performed today at the Vienna Philharmonic&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Concert. The general mood of the piece is rather pensive but the final moments of the piece are utter joy and sparkling with Strauss happier tunes. Waltz section 1 is in F major and is graceful but pensive in mood. Waltz 2A is also in a more reflective mood but waltz 2B is more uplifting. The entire waltz 3 section is in G major while waltz section 4 is in E-flat major and has the climax with cymbals. A restless-sounding coda in E-flat is soon replaced with a reprise of the waltz 3A. Waltz 1A has a brief show at the end before the waltz 4B is introduced, this time in the home key of F major. A series of descending chords marks the end of the waltz, underlined with a drum roll and final flourish.

==Schoenberg arrangement==
Arnold Schoenberg arranged this waltz as part of a special concert for his Society for Private Musical Performances in 1921.

==In popular culture==
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Squire of Gothos&quot;, Trelane has Nyota Uhura play this waltz. The piece is also used in the &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; video game for the PlayStation 2 and the 1927 film &quot;&quot; during the carnival sequence.

The waltz appears uncredited in the dance scene in the 2012 film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; starring Christian Bale and Michael Caine.

The waltz appears briefly during Lisle Von Rhuman&#x27;s party scene in the 1992 film &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;.

A few bars of the waltz are played by Adam Stanton on a piano in the 1949 film &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;.

<text>The Florida Northern Railroad Company, Inc. is one of several short line railroads run by Regional Rail, LLC. It has connections to CSX at Ocala, Florida, running north to Lowell, Florida, and south to Candler, Florida. It was formerly run by CSX as their Ocala Subdivision.

The railroad also operates lines connecting to CSX in Newberry, Florida, running south to the Crystal River Energy Complex in Red Level, Florida, just north of Crystal River. This line was formerly CSX&#x27;s West Coast Subdivision and Red Level Subdivision. Long coal trains are still pulled by CSX locomotives on this branch while local traffic still uses the Pinsly Red with Yellow locomotives.
==History==

===Lowell to Candler Line===
The main track of the line from Lowell to Candler via Ocala was originally built by the Florida Southern Railway, which was part of the Plant System of railroads. It was built from Rochelle (south of Gainesville) to Ocala in 1881. In 1883, it was extended south to Leesburg. The track connecting the Florida Northern main track with the CSX track and the industrial spur from Ocala west was originally part of the Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad, which was built in 1887 and historically extended west to Dunnellon and Homosassa. The Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad also became part of the Plant System.

The Plant System became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. The Atlantic Coast line used this line for passenger service and in 1917, they jointly built Ocala Union Station with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad where the two railroads crossed. Ocala Union Station no longer serves passenger trains but continues to stand where the Florida Northern crosses the CSX S Line (the former Seaboard Air Line).

The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line merged in 1967 with the merged company becoming the CSX Transportation in 1986. The former Atlantic Coast Line route was abandoned north of Lowell and south of Candler around 1982, creating the line that exists today. CSX leased the line to the Pinsly Railroad Company in 1988 who established the Florida Northern Railroad. In November 2019, Pinsly Railroad Company sold the Florida Northern, along with the Florida Central Railroad and Florida Midland Railroad, to 3i RR Holdings GP, LLC and subsidiaries (d.b.a. &quot;Regional Rail, LLC&quot;).

As of 2016, the northernmost 5 miles from Zuber to Lowell are out of service.

===Newberry to Red Level Line===
The line from Newberry to Red Level was built incrementally by Henry Plant&#x27;s system of railroads. Track from High Springs to Archer was built in 1893 by the Plant System as a branch of the Live Oak, Tampa and Charlotte Harbor Railroad.

At the other end, the Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad (which originated in Ocala), built the track from a point historically known as Juliette (near Rainbow Springs) south to Dunnellon, Crystal River, and Homosassa in 1887 (though track to Homosassa only lasted until 1941). In 1893, track was built from Juliette (near Rainbow Springs) north to Morriston and from just south of Dunnellon south to Inverness. The split in the line to Inverness would become known as Gulf Junction.

One of the early organizers of the Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad was John F. Dunn, for whom Dunnellon is named for. The Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad would become part of the Plant System of railroads in 1901. 
The Plant System was acquired by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. 

The Atlantic Coast Line then extended the line from Morriston north to Archer in 1913 to connect with the line from High Springs. The completion of this line created a through route from High Springs to Dunnellon, which combined with track to Inverness south created a west coast main line for the Atlantic Coast Line. 

In the 1960s, a spur was built to the Crystal River Energy Complex in Red Level.

The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad eventually evolved into CSX in 1986, with this line being known as the West Coast Subdivision. 
The track from Red Level Junction to Crystal River was removed by 1982 and track from Dunnellon south to Inverness and Owensboro was removed in 1987, which became the Withlacoochee State Trail. 

The Florida Northern took over the remaining track of the West Coast Subdivision in 2005. The spur from Newberry to High Springs was removed in 2014.

<text>Debonair was a British airline headquartered at London Luton Airport offering flights to and from Spain, France, Germany and Italy. It ceased operations in October 1999 due to financial difficulties.

==History==
Debonair was founded in 1996 by Franco Mancassola who had previously worked for Continental Airlines, and founded Discovery Airways in Hawaii. Debonair&#x27;s first flights took off on June 19, with weekday daily flights to Munich, Mönchengladbach and Barcelona from London Luton Airport. From July, Debonair also added a Madrid route alongside Newcastle and Copenhagen, and later in November a direct London Luton to Rome flight.

It floated shares on the Easdaq in September 1997 and raised $41.9m. By mid-1998, the airline was on a heavy cost-cutting strategy which was beginning to slow the losses compared with the year prior. Although at the same time, Debonair sought to introduce special services for its frequent flyer programme including fast track boarding and inclusive meals onboard and on some routes its &#x27;ABC - Affordable Business Class&#x27; product. Debonair appealed to business travellers, who made up 58 perecent of its passengers by 1998. In late 1998, Debonair entered a working relationship with Lufthansa, leasing five aircraft for their CityLine operations from Munich. Whilst the aircraft were in Lufthansa colours, the flights were operated by Debonair staff. Debonair also entered a similar agreement with Swissair who were launching their Express brand to operate a BAE 146 on their behalf from Zurich to Venice and Bologna. Debonair also maintained a codeshare agreement with AB Airlines, which resulted in the lease of a Boeing 737-300 from January 1999 remaining in service until Debonair&#x27;s operations ended.

On 1 October 1999 the airline&#x27;s shares were suspended, and the following day the operations of Debonair were grounded following a court ruling to appoint Deloitte as administrators. At the time of closure, the airline had just embarked on a new national advertising campaign, which was pulled from the media at the last minute. However, some advertising made it onto London Underground trains. Following the closure of Debonair, founder Mancassola was critical of British Airways subsidiary Go as a cause for the airlines demise.

<text>Jean Frances Tatlock (February 21, 1914 – January 4, 1944) was an American psychiatrist. She was a member of the Communist Party USA and was a reporter and writer for the party&#x27;s publication &quot;Western Worker&quot;. She is also known for her romantic relationship with J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II.

The daughter of John Strong Perry Tatlock, a prominent Old English philologist and an expert on Geoffrey Chaucer, Tatlock was a graduate of Vassar College and the Stanford Medical School, where she studied to become a psychiatrist. Tatlock began seeing Oppenheimer in 1936, when she was a graduate student at Stanford and Oppenheimer was a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. As a result of their relationship and her membership of the Communist Party, she was placed under surveillance by the FBI and her phone was tapped. Tatlock experienced clinical depression, and died by suicide on January 4, 1944.

==Early life==
Jean Frances Tatlock was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on February 21, 1914, the second child of John Strong Perry Tatlock and Marjorie Fenton. She had an older brother named Hugh, who became a physician. Her father, who had a PhD from Harvard University, was a noted and acclaimed professor of English at the University of Michigan; an Old English philologist; an expert on Geoffrey Chaucer and English plays, poems, and Elizabethan literature; and author of approximately 60 books on those subjects, including &quot;The Complete Poetical Works of Geoffrey Chaucer&quot; (1912) and &quot;The Mind and Art of Chaucer&quot; (1950). 

John Tatlock was a professor of English at Stanford from 1915 to 1925, and Harvard from 1925 to 1929, before returning to the Bay Area as a professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley. Jean Tatlock attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Williams College in Berkeley. In 1930, she entered Vassar College. After graduating in 1935, Tatlock returned to Berkeley and took courses to complete the prerequisites for Stanford Medical School, and was a reporter and writer for the &quot;Western Worker&quot;, the Communist Party of America&#x27;s organ on the West Coast of the United States. 

She was accepted into Stanford Medical School, then located in San Francisco, where she studied to become a psychiatrist. Tatlock graduated from Stanford with the class of 1941. She completed her internship at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., and residency at the Department of Psychiatry at Mount Zion Hospital, now a campus of the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, in San Francisco.

==Romance with Oppenheimer==
Tatlock struggled with her sexuality, at one point writing to a friend that &quot;there was a period when I thought I was homosexual. I still am, in a way, forced to believe it, but really, logically, I am sure that I can&#x27;t be because of my un-masculinity.&quot; She began seeing Robert Oppenheimer in 1936, when she was a graduate student and Oppenheimer was a professor of physics at Berkeley. They met through his landlady, Mary Ellen Washburn, who was a member of the Communist Party, when Washburn held a fundraiser for communist-backed Spanish Republicans. 

The couple started dating and reportedly had a passionate relationship. He proposed to her twice, but she refused. Tatlock is credited with introducing Oppenheimer to radical politics during the late 1930s, and to people involved with, or sympathetic to, the Communist Party or related groups, such as Rudy Lambert and Thomas Addis. The couple continued seeing each other after Oppenheimer became involved with Kitty Harrison, whom he married on November 1, 1940. Oppenheimer and Tatlock spent the New Year together in 1941, and once met at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco.

Oppenheimer&#x27;s association with Tatlock&#x27;s friends was used as evidence against him during his 1954 security hearing. In a letter to Major General Kenneth D. Nichols, General Manager, United States Atomic Energy Commission, dated March 4, 1954, Oppenheimer described their association as follows:

While some historians believe that Oppenheimer had an extramarital affair with Tatlock while he was working on the Manhattan Project, others assert that after he was picked to head the Los Alamos Laboratory, he met with Tatlock only once, in mid-June 1943. On June 14, 1943, Oppenheimer was in Berkeley to recruit David Hawkins as an administrative assistant. Oppenheimer and Tatlock went to a Mexican restaurant and spent the night together at her San Francisco apartment. All the while, U.S. Army agents, waiting in the street outside, had them under surveillance. At that meeting she told him that she still loved him and wanted to be with him. He never saw her again.

Edith Arnstein Jenkins recalled a conversation with Mason Robertson, a good friend of Tatlock&#x27;s, in which he claimed Tatlock had told him she was a lesbian. It is plausible that Tatlock had a relationship with Mary Ellen Washburn. As a psychiatrist in training, she was required to undergo psychoanalysis, and therefore consulted Siegfried Bernfeld as part of her training. In the 1940s, homosexuality was seen as a pathological condition to be overcome, which may have led to her eventual suicide.

==Death==
===Events prior===
Tatlock experienced clinical depression, and was being treated at Mount Zion. At around 1 pm on January 5, 1944, her father arrived at her apartment at 1405 Montgomery Street. When there was no response to his ringing the doorbell, he climbed in through a window. He found her dead, lying on a pile of cushions in the bathroom, with her head submerged in the partly-filled bathtub. There was an unsigned suicide note, which read:

Her father found her correspondence and sifted through it, burning letters and photographs in the fireplace. At 5:10 pm he called the Halstead Funeral Home, who contacted the police. The police arrived at 5:30 pm, accompanied by the deputy coroner. At the time of her death she was under surveillance by the FBI, and her phone had been tapped, so one of the first people informed about it was FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, via a teletype link. The news of her death was reported in Bay Area newspapers.

Washburn cabled Charlotte Serber at Los Alamos. As the librarian, Serber had access to the Technical Area and informed her husband, physicist Robert Serber, who then went to inform Oppenheimer. When he reached Oppenheimer&#x27;s office, he found that Oppenheimer already knew. The security chief at Los Alamos, Captain Peer de Silva, had received the news through the wiretap and Army Intelligence and had broken it to Oppenheimer. Tatlock had introduced Oppenheimer to the poetry of John Donne, and it is widely believed he named the first test of a nuclear weapon &quot;Trinity&quot; in reference to one of Donne&#x27;s poems, as a tribute to her. In 1962, Leslie Groves wrote to Oppenheimer about the origin of the name, and elicited this reply:

===Inquest===
A formal inquest in February 1944 returned a verdict of &quot;suicide, motive unknown&quot;. In his report, the coroner found that Tatlock had eaten a full meal shortly before her death. She had taken some barbiturates, but not a fatal dose. Traces of chloral hydrate were found, a drug normally associated with a &quot;Mickey Finn&quot; when combined with alcohol, but there was no alcohol in her blood, despite damage to her pancreas that indicated she was a heavy drinker. As a psychiatrist working in a hospital, she had access to sedatives such as chloral hydrate. The coroner found that she had died at around 4:30 pm on January 4. The cause of death was recorded as &quot;acute edema of the lungs with pulmonary congestion&quot; — drowning in the bathtub. It seems likely that she knelt over the bathtub, took chloral hydrate, and plunged her head into the water.

===Assassination theory===
There has been speculation by journalists and historians, as well as Tatlock&#x27;s brother Hugh, that her death was not a suicide, and the &quot;curious circumstances&quot; surrounding it have subsequently aroused suspicion. The conspiracy theory that she was murdered by intelligence agents working for the Manhattan Project was bolstered by the 1975 Church Committee, which revealed details of assassinations carried out by American intelligence agencies. One doctor quoted in Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin&#x27;s biography of Oppenheimer, &quot;American Prometheus&quot;, observed that if one &quot;were clever and wanted to kill someone&quot;, chloral hydrate would be &quot;the way to do it.&quot; However, according to Bird and Sherwin, Tatlock&#x27;s &quot;unsigned suicide note suggests that she died by her own hand—a &#x27;paralyzed soul&#x27;—and this is certainly what Oppenheimer always believed.&quot;

The assassination theory has been presented in the drama miniseries &quot;Manhattan&quot;, and also the 2023 film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;. In the latter, Oppenheimer imagines Tatlock&#x27;s death in multiple ways: she lowers her head gradually into the bathtub, and in another scene a gloved hand can be seen shoving her head beneath the water.

===Cremation===
Tatlock&#x27;s father had her remains cremated.

== Portrayals ==
She was portrayed by Kate Harper in the 1980 TV miniseries &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;. Natasha Richardson played Tatlock in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot;, while Florence Pugh took on the role for Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2023 epic biographical thriller &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;.

<text>A bread pan, also called a loaf pan, is a kitchen utensil in the form of a container in which bread is baked. Its function is to shape bread while it is rising during baking. The most common shape of the bread pan is the loaf, or narrow rectangle, a convenient form that enables uniform slicing. The bread pan is made from a conductive material such as metal which might be treated with a non-stick coating. It can also be made of heat-resistant glass, ceramic, or a special type of paper that sticks to the dough but is easily removed, once cooked. Bread pans are found in a variety of designs and sizes providing the baker with different possibilities not only for baking bread, but also cakes and puddings. 

Types of bread typically baked in bread pans include sandwich breads, brioche, challah, and raisin bread.

<text>Sir Max Hugh Macdonald Hastings (; born 28 December 1945) is a British journalist and military historian, who has worked as a foreign correspondent for the BBC, editor-in-chief of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. He is also the author of thirty books, most significantly histories, which have won several major awards. Hastings currently writes a bimonthly column for &quot;Bloomberg Opinion&quot; and contributes to &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

==Early life==
Hastings&#x27; parents were Macdonald Hastings, a journalist and correspondent, and Anne Scott-James, sometime editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. He was educated at Charterhouse and University College, Oxford, which he left after a year.

== Career ==
Hastings moved to the United States, spending a year (1967–68) as a Fellow of the World Press Institute, following which he published his first book, &quot;America, 1968: The Fire This Time&quot;, an account of the US in its tumultuous election year. He became a foreign correspondent and reported from more than sixty countries and eleven wars for BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Twenty-Four Hours&quot; current affairs programme and for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in London.

Hastings was the first person accompanying the British Task Force to enter Port Stanley on the last day of the 1982 Falklands War. After ten years as editor and then editor-in-chief of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, he returned to the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; as editor in 1996 and remained there until his retirement in 2002. Hastings was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2002 Birthday Honours for services to journalism. He was elected a member of the political dining society known as The Other Club in 1993.

He has presented historical documentaries for the BBC and is the author of many books, including &quot;Bomber Command&quot;, which earned the Somerset Maugham Award for non-fiction in 1980. Both &quot;Overlord&quot; and &quot;The Battle for the Falklands&quot; won the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; &quot;Book of the Year&quot; prize. He was named &quot;Journalist of the Year&quot; and &quot;Reporter of the Year&quot; at the 1982 British Press Awards, and &quot;Editor of the Year&quot; in 1988. In 2010 he received the Royal United Services Institute&#x27;s &quot;Westminster Medal&quot; for his &quot;lifelong contribution to military literature&quot;, and the same year the Edgar Wallace Award from the London Press Club.

In 2012, he was awarded the US$100,000 Pritzker Military Library Literature Award, a lifetime achievement award for military writing, which includes an honorarium, citation and medallion, sponsored by the Chicago-based Tawani Foundation. Hastings is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and the Royal Historical Society. He was President of the Campaign to Protect Rural England from 2002 to 2007.

In his 2007 book &quot;Nemesis: The Battle for Japan, 1944–45&quot; (known as &quot;Retribution&quot; in the United States), the chapter on Australia&#x27;s role in the last year of the Pacific War was criticised by the chief of the Returned and Services League of Australia and one of the historians at the Australian War Memorial, for allegedly exaggerating discontent in the Australian Army. Dan van der Vat in &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;even-handed&quot;, &quot;refreshing&quot; and &quot;sensitive&quot; and praised the language used. &quot;The Spectator&quot; called it &quot;brilliant&quot; and praised his telling of the human side of the story.

Hastings wrote a column for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; between 2002 and 2008 and often contributes articles to other publications such as &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. He also currently writes a bimonthly column for Bloomberg Opinion.

== Personal life ==
Hastings lives near Hungerford, Berkshire, with his second wife, Penelope (), whom he married in 1999. Hastings has a surviving son and daughter by his first wife, Patricia Edmondson, to whom he was married from 1972 until 1994. In 2000, his 27-year-old first son, Charles, died by suicide in Ningbo, China. He dedicated his book &quot;Nemesis: The Battle for Japan 1944–45&quot;, which was published in 2007, to Charles&#x27;s memory.

==Political views==
Hastings has at different times voted for all three major British political parties. He announced his support for the Conservative Party at the 2010 general election, having previously voted for the Labour Party at the 1997 and 2001 general elections. He said that &quot;four terms are too many for any government&quot; and described Gordon Brown as &quot;wholly psychologically unfit to be Prime Minister&quot;. 

In August 2014, Hastings was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In June 2019, Hastings described Boris Johnson, the Conservative Party leadership candidate, as &quot;unfit for national office, because it seems he cares for no interest save his own fame and gratification ... [his] premiership will almost certainly reveal a contempt for rules, precedent, order and stability ... If the price of Johnson proves to be Corbyn, blame will rest with the Conservative party, which is about to foist a tasteless joke upon the British people – who will not find it funny for long.&quot; He continued along this line of argument throughout the Johnson premiership and he said that &quot;the experiment in celebrity government to which the Conservative Party committed us has failed, and is seen by the world to have failed. The foremost task for a successor is to restore Britain&#x27;s reputation as a serious country.&quot;

In his Bloomberg column on 14 February 2021, Hastings wrote that the United Kingdom&#x27;s future was unlikely to be long-term. He advocated a United Ireland but said he was against Scottish and Welsh independence. Hastings was widely criticised for stating in the article that the Welsh language was of &quot;marginal value&quot; and that Wales could not succeed as an independent country because it was &quot;dependent on English largesse&quot;. Huw Edwards said there were several factual errors in Hastings&#x27; points, while Fergus Llewelyn Turtle responded: &quot;For the non-English part of the UK that is ... the most integrated with England, it&#x27;s pretty astonishing how many English commentators have exactly zero political clue about Wales.&quot;

In March 2021, Hastings wrote that the prospect of a showdown between the United States and China over Taiwan was becoming increasingly likely.

<doc id="1249901" wikidata="Q5517446" url="?curid=1249901" title="Gaius Julius Marcus">
<text>Gaius Iulius Marcus is the name of one of the early governors of Britannia Inferior, c. 213 -214.

His name is recorded on a milestone on the Military Way at Hadrian&#x27;s Wall although it has been partially erased, suggesting that he had brought disfavour on himself sometime later. He also undertook building work at the forts of Old Carlisle and Netherby.

Iulius Marcus&#x27; troops sided with Caracalla in the dispute over the throne that followed the death of Septimius Severus and erected their own dedications to their chosen candidate. The damnatio memoriae that their governor suffered may have been connected with this.

<doc id="1249903" wikidata="Q1382720" url="?curid=1249903" title="Osbert Sitwell">
<text>Sir Francis Osbert Sacheverell Sitwell, 5th Baronet CH CBE (6 December 1892 – 4 May 1969) was an English writer. His elder sister was Edith Sitwell and his younger brother was Sacheverell Sitwell. Like them, he devoted his life to art and literature.

==Early life==
Sitwell was born on 6 December 1892 at 3 Arlington Street, St James&#x27;s, London. His parents were Sir George Reresby Sitwell, fourth baronet, genealogist and antiquarian, and Lady Ida Emily Augusta (&quot;née&quot; Denison). He grew up in the family seat at Renishaw Hall, Derbyshire, and at family mansions in the region of Scarborough, and went to Ludgrove School, then Eton College from 1906 to 1909. For many years his entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; contained the phrase &quot;Educ[ated]: during the holidays from Eton.&quot;

In 1911 he joined the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry but, not cut out to be a cavalry officer, transferred to the Grenadier Guards at the Tower of London from where, in his off-duty time, he could frequent theatres and art galleries.

===Army===
Late in 1914 Sitwell&#x27;s civilised life was exchanged for the trenches of France near Ypres in Belgium. It was here that he wrote his first poetry, describing it as &quot;Some instinct, and a combination of feelings not hitherto experienced united to drive me to paper&quot;. &quot;Babel&quot; was published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 11 May 1916. In the same year, he began literary collaborations and anthologies with his brother and sister, the trio being usually referred to simply as the Sitwells.

==Political and other activity==
He acted as best man at the wedding of Alexander, 1st Marquess of Carisbrooke, son of Prince Henry of Battenberg and Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom, on 19 July 1917 at the Chapel Royal, St. James&#x27;s Palace, London.

In 1918 Sitwell left the Army with the rank of Captain, and contested the 1918 general election as the Liberal Party candidate for Scarborough and Whitby, finishing second.




Sitwell was opposed to British intervention in the Russian Civil War. Sitwell wrote a 1919 poem (&quot;A Certain Statesman&quot;), satirizing Winston Churchill for his advocacy of British involvement in the conflict. Sitwell also wrote the poem &quot;Shaking Hands With Murder&quot; which was published in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; newspaper in 1920; this poem derided Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer for ordering the Amritsar massacre.

Later he moved towards the political right, though politics were very seldom explicit in his writings. In &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; he ultimately declared of his political views: &quot;Advocates compulsory Freedom everywhere, the suppression of Public Opinion in the interest of Free Speech, and the rationing of brains without which innovation there can be no true democracy.&quot;

Sitwell campaigned for the preservation of Georgian buildings and was responsible for saving Sutton Scarsdale Hall, now owned by English Heritage. He was an early and active member of the Georgian Group.

He also had an interest in the paranormal and joined the Ghost Club, which at the time was being relaunched as a dinner society dedicated to discussing paranormal occurrences and topics.

==Writing career==
Sitwell devoted himself to poetry, art criticism and controversial journalism. Together with his brother, he sponsored a controversial exhibition of works by Matisse, Utrillo, Picasso and Modigliani. The composer William Walton also greatly benefited from his largesse (though the two men afterwards fell out) and Walton&#x27;s cantata &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; was written to Sitwell&#x27;s libretto. He published three books of poems: &quot;Argonaut and Juggernaut&quot; (1919); &quot;At the House of Mrs Kinfoot&quot; (1921); and &quot;Out Of The Flame&quot; (1923).

===Works===
Sitwell&#x27;s first work of fiction, &quot;Triple Fugue&quot;, was published in 1924, and visits to Italy and Germany produced &quot;Discursions on Travel, Art and Life&quot; (1925). His first novel, &quot;Before the Bombardment&quot; (1926), set in an out-of-season hotel, was well reviewed – Ralph Straus writing for &quot;Bystander&quot; magazine called it &#x27;a nearly flawless piece of satirical writing&#x27;, and Beverley Nichols praised &#x27;the richness of its beauty and wit&#x27;. His subsequent novel &quot;The Man Who Lost Himself&quot; (1929) did not receive the same critical acclaim. However, for Osbert Sitwell it was an attempt to take further the techniques that he had experimented with in his début, and he ventured to explain this in one challenging sentence in his Preface when he said: &quot;Convinced that movement is not in itself enough, that no particular action or sequence of actions is in itself of sufficient concern to dare lay claim to the intelligent attention of the reader, that adventures of the mind and soul are more interesting, because more mysterious, than those of the body, and yet that, on the other hand, the essence does not reside to any much greater degree in the tangle of reason, unreason, and previous history, in which each action, event and thought is founded, but is to be discovered, rather, in that balance, so difficult to achieve, which lies between them, he has attempted to write a book which might best be described as a Novel of Reasoned Action&quot;. Re-edited over three quarters of a century after its initial publication, &quot;The Man Who Lost Himself&quot; has found new popularity as an idiosyncratic mystery novel.

Sitwell went on to write several further novels, including &quot;Miracle on Sinai&quot; (1934) and &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; (1937) neither of which received the same glowing reviews as his first. A collection of short stories &quot;Open the Door&quot; (1940), his fifth novel &quot;A Place of One&#x27;s Own&quot; (1940), his &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1943) and a book of essays &quot;Sing High, Sing Low&quot; (1944) were reasonably well received. His &quot;The Four Continents&quot; (1951) is a book of travel, reminiscence and observation.

===&quot;Rat Week&quot;===
Sitwell was a close friend of the Duke and Duchess of York, future King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. In December 1936, when the abdication of King Edward VIII was announced, he wrote a poem, &quot;Rat Week&quot;, attacking principally the former king and Wallis Simpson but also those friends of Edward who deserted him when his alliance with Simpson became common knowledge in England. Because of its libellous content it was not published but Sitwell ensured that it was circulated privately. In February 1937, a version appeared in &quot;Cavalcade&quot;, which Sitwell described as a &quot;paper, which confounded liveliness with mischief&quot;. The &quot;Cavalcade&quot; version omitted the &quot;offensive&quot; references to Edward and Wallis. This resulted in the poem&#x27;s gaining an unwarranted reputation as being sympathetic to the Windsors over the way some of their friends had treated them. &quot;Cavalcade&quot; also missed out a verse in which a number of the &quot;rats&quot; were named explicitly, as to publish this would have been libellous.

Sitwell sued &quot;Cavalcade&quot; for breach of copyright. He obtained an interim injunction preventing further publication in &quot;Cavalcade&quot;, which ensured further surreptitious circulation of the poem. When the full case came to court, &quot;Cavalcade&quot; tried to get Sitwell to produce the missing verse. Sitwell resisted on the grounds that he could not be forced to make a criminally libellous statement. The case ended up in the Appeal Court, where Sitwell won and obtained damages and costs.

Sitwell knew that, because of the libel issue, the poem could not be published in his lifetime; he decided that publication should wait even longer than that to avoid &quot;pain to those still living&quot;. The poem was first published posthumously in 1986, the year the Duchess of Windsor (as Wallis had become) died, in a book entitled &quot;Rat Week: An Essay on the Abdication&quot;. Sitwell then explained the background to the poem in some detail because he recognised that the long delay in publication would result in many readers being unfamiliar with the characters. The book also contains a foreword by John Pearson, explaining some of the background to the publication of the book.

===Autobiography===
In 1943 he started an autobiography that ran to four volumes: &quot;Left Hand, Right Hand!&quot; (1943), &quot;The Scarlet Tree&quot; (1946), &quot;Great Morning&quot; (1947) and &quot;Laughter in the Next Room&quot; (1949). The first volume includes a chapter on &quot;The Sargent Group&quot; a humorous account of John Singer Sargent&#x27;s group portrait of the Sitwells (Sitwell family), and the adjustments that Sargent made to Edith&#x27;s and her father&#x27;s noses.

Writing in &quot;The Adelphi&quot;, George Orwell declared that, &quot;although the range they cover is narrow, [they] must be among the best autobiographies of our time.&quot; Sitwell&#x27;s autobiography was followed by a collection of essays about various people he had known, &quot;Noble Essences: A Book of Characters&quot; (1950), and a postscript, &quot;Tales my Father Taught Me&quot; (1962).

The sometimes acidic diarist James Agate commented on Sitwell after a drinking session on 3 June 1932, in &quot;Ego&quot;, volume 1, &quot;There is something self-satisfied and having-to-do-with-the-Bourbons about him which is annoying, though there is also something of the crowned-head consciousness which is disarming.&quot;

In &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, he summed up his career: &quot;For the past 30 years has conducted, in conjunction with his brother and sister, a series of skirmishes and hand-to-hand battles against the Philistine. Though outnumbered, has occasionally succeeded in denting the line, though not without damage to himself.&quot;

==Baronetcy and honours==
After Sitwell&#x27;s father died, in 1943, Osbert succeeded to the baronetcy.

Sitwell was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1956 and a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 1958.

==Personal life==
In 1923, Sitwell met David Stuart Horner (1900 – 1983) who was his lover and companion for most of his life.

==Death==
Sitwell suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease from the 1950s; by the mid-1960s his condition had become so severe that he had to abandon writing. He spent his last years in Italy, at the , in Montespertoli near Florence, which his father had bought derelict and restored as his personal residence; he died there on 4 May 1969.

The castle was left to his nephew, Reresby; his money was left to his brother Sacheverell. Sitwell was cremated and his ashes buried in the Cimitero Evangelico degli Allori in Florence, together with a copy of his first novel, &quot;Before the Bombardment&quot;.

<text>Type 12 frigate refers to several ship classes, most commonly the three ship classes of the Royal Navy designed during the 1950s and constructed during the 1960s.
* The first Type 12 frigates, designed as convoy escorts, were later named the . Six operated in the Royal Navy, with one loaned to the Royal New Zealand Navy, and two built for the Indian Navy.
* The design of the Type 12 Modified (Type 12M) or was optimised towards anti-submarine warfare and fleet escort duties, and fitted with the Sea Cat missile system. Nine were built for the Royal Navy, two for the Royal New Zealand Navy, and three (as the &#x27;President class&#x27;) for the South African Navy.
* The third class, designed as an all-purpose warship, was known as the Type 12 Improved (Type 12I) or the . The class was made up of three &#x27;batches&#x27;; the main differences between each batch being variations in propulsion machinery and weapons outfit. 26 were built for the Royal Navy, some of which later saw service in the navies of Chile, Ecuador, New Zealand, and Pakistan.

The Type 12 designation is sometimes used to refer to warship classes based on the Type 12 design, but constructed or operated by other naval forces. Some of these are still in service as of 2009:
* The s of the Chilean Navy. Based on the &quot;Leander&quot; class, this class consisted of four ships, two purpose-built, and two former Royal Navy &quot;Leander&quot;s.
* The s of the Royal Australian Navy. Six were constructed: two to the &quot;Rothesay&quot; design, two to the same design but modified to carry a variable-depth sonar and an Ikara missile system (which was retrofitted to the first two), and two to an Australian-designed &quot;Leander&quot; variant.
* The s of the Indian Navy. Six were constructed to an updated design based on the &quot;Leander&quot;s.
* The and s of the Indian Navy. An enlarged &quot;Nilgiri&quot; design was used as the basis for six ships (three of each class), with the weapons outfit the main difference between them.
* The s of the Royal Netherlands Navy. Based on the &quot;Leander&quot; design but with Dutch radars, six ships were built. All six were later transferred to the Indonesian Navy and become &quot;Ahmad Yani&quot;-class frigate. All of them are renamed with Indonesian National Heroes.

<text>Mahasweta Devi (14 January 1926 – 28 July 2016) was an Indian writer in Bengali and an activist. Her notable literary works include &quot;Hajar Churashir Maa&quot;, &quot;Rudali&quot;, and &quot;Aranyer Adhikar&quot;. She was a leftist who worked for the rights and empowerment of the tribal people (&quot;Lodha&quot; and &quot;Shabar&quot;) of West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh states of India. She was honoured with various literary awards such as the Sahitya Akademi Award (in Bengali), Jnanpith Award and Ramon Magsaysay Award along with India&#x27;s civilian awards Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan.

== Early life and education ==
Mahasweta Devi was born in a Brahmin family on 14 January 1926 in Dacca, British India (now Dhaka, Bangladesh). Her father, Manish Ghatak, was a poet and novelist of the Kallol movement, who used the pseudonym Jubanashwa (). Ghatak&#x27;s brother was filmmaker Ritwik Ghatak. Devi&#x27;s mother, Dharitri Devi, was also a writer and a social worker whose brothers include sculptor Sankha Chaudhury and the founder-editor of &quot;Economic and Political Weekly&quot; of India, Sachin Chaudhury.

Devi&#x27;s first schooling was in Dhaka, Eden Montessori School (1930). After that, she moved to West Bengal (now in India). Then she studied in Mission Girls&#x27; High School, Midnapore (1935). After that she was admitted to Santiniketan (1936 to 1938). After that, she studied at Beltala Girls&#x27; School (1939-1941) where she finished her matriculation. Then in 1944 she got I.A. from Asutosh College. She attended Rabindranath Tagore-founded Visva-Bharati University and completed a B.A. (Hons) in English, and then finished an M.A. in English at Calcutta University.

== Career ==

=== Literary works ===
Devi wrote over 100 novels and over 20 collections of short stories primarily written in Bengali but often translated to other languages. Her first novel, titled &quot;Jhansir Rani&quot;, based on a biography of the Rani of Jhansi was published in 1956. She had toured the Jhansi region to record information and folk songs from the local people for the novel.

Mahasweta Devi&#x27;s specialisation lay in the studies of Adivasi, Dalit and Marginalized citizens with a focus on their women. They were associated as protestor in the face of British colonialism, the Mahajanas and upper class corruption and injustice. She lived in the Adivasi villages in West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh years after years, befriending them and learning from them. She has embodied their struggles and sacrifices in her words and characters. She had claimed that her stories aren&#x27;t her creation, they are the stories of the people of her country. Such an example is her work &quot;Chotti Mundi Ebong Tar Tir&quot;.

In 1964, she began teaching at Vijaygarh Jyotish Ray College (an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta system). In those days Vijaygarh Jyotish Ray College was an institution for working-class women students. During that period she also worked—as a journalist and as a creative writer. She studied the &quot;Lodhas&quot; and &quot;Shabars&quot;, the tribal communities of West Bengal, women and dalits. In her elaborate Bengali fiction, she often depicted the brutal oppression on the tribal people and untouchables by the powerful authoritarian upper-caste landlords, money-lenders, and venal government officials. She wrote of the source of her inspiration:

Postcolonial scholar Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has translated Devi&#x27;s short stories into English and published three books &quot;Imaginary Maps&quot; (1995, Routledge), &quot;Old Woman&quot; (1997, Seagull), &quot;The Breast Stories&quot; (1997, Seagull).

=== Social activity ===
Mahasweta Devi raised her voice several times against the discrimination suffered by tribal people in India. Devi&#x27;s 1977 novel &quot;Aranyer Adhikar&quot; (Right to the Forest) was about the life of Birsa Munda. And in June 2016, consequent to Devi&#x27;s activism, the Jharkhand State Government finally saw to the removal of the manacles from the figure of Munda, which had been part of the commemorative sculpture of the notable young tribal leader due to its having been based on a photograph dating from the era of British rule.

Devi spearheaded the movement against the industrial policy of the earlier Communist Party of India (Marxist) government of West Bengal. Specifically, she stridently criticized confiscation from farmers of large tracts of fertile agricultural land by the government which then ceded it to industrial houses at throwaway prices. She supported the candidature of Mamata Banarjee in the 2011 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election which resulted in the end of the 34-year long rule of CPI(M). She had connected the policy to the commercialization of Santiniketan of Rabindranath Tagore, where she spent her formative years. Her lead in the Nandigram agitation resulted in a number of intellectuals, artists, writers and theatre workers joining in protest of the controversial policy and particularly its implementation in Singur and Nandigram.

She is known to have helped the noted writer Manoranjan Bypari to come into prominence as his initial writings were published in her journal and as prompted by her.

At the Frankfurt Book Fair 2006, when India was the first country to be the Fair&#x27;s second time guest nation, she made an impassioned inaugural speech wherein she moved the audience to tears with her lines taken from the famous film song &quot;Mera Joota Hai Japani&quot; by Raj Kapoor.
In 1997, president Shankar Dayal Sharma commuted two death sentences after Devi led a petition campaign. In 2012, she was one of more than 215 signatories, along with Nandita Das, Aamir Bashir, and Anusha Rizvi, to a petition delivered to president Pranab Mukherjee that opposed the death penalty after the conviction of Ajmal Kasab following the 2008 Mumbai attacks and instead favored life imprisonment. The letter stated, &quot;In the land of Buddha, Mahavira and Gandhiji, let it not be said there is no place in our hearts for mercy.&quot;

== Personal life ==
On 27 February 1947, she married renowned playwright Bijon Bhattacharya, who was one of the founding fathers of the Indian People&#x27;s Theatre Association movement. In 1948, she gave birth to Nabarun Bhattacharya, who became a novelist and political critic. She worked in a post office but was fired for her communist leaning. She went on to do various jobs, such as selling soaps and writing letters in English for illiterate people. In 1962, she married author Asit Gupta after divorcing Bhattacharya. In 1976, the relationship with Gupta ended.

== Death ==

On 23 July 2016, Devi suffered a major heart attack and was admitted to Belle Vue Clinic, Kolkata. Devi died of multiple organ failure on 28 July 2016, aged 90. She had suffered from diabetes, sepsis and urinary infection.

On her death, Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal tweeted &quot;India has lost a great writer. Bengal has lost a glorious mother. I have lost a personal guide. Mahasweta Di rest in peace.&quot; Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted &quot;Mahashweta Devi wonderfully illustrated the might of the pen. A voice of compassion, equality &amp; justice, she leaves us deeply saddened. RIP.&quot;

<doc id="1249909" wikidata="Q7405913" url="?curid=1249909" title="Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge">
<text>The Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge is part of the United States system of national wildlife refuges. It is located in Alfalfa County in northern Oklahoma, north of Jet (pop. 230), along Great Salt Plains Lake, which is formed by a dam on the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River.

The refuge was established March 26, 1930, by executive order of President Herbert Hoover, and contains of protected land as habitat to about 312 species of birds and 30 species of mammals. It was designated a national natural landmark in June 1983.

==Refuge description==
The Salt Plains were a favorite hunting ground for American Indians. Bison and other game came to the area to eat the salt and the heavily wooded and well-watered area along the Salt Fork River was like an oasis in the surrounding grassland of the Great Plains. Salt Plains refuge is divided into almost equal areas of nonvegetated salt flat, open water, and vegetated land. Marshes, woods, grasslands, and croplands dot the refuge. Management tools used to enhance the habitat for wildlife include farming, grazing, prescribed burns, construction of ponds, and wetland draining and flooding.

The refuge was created to be a resting and breeding ground for migratory waterfowl especially during fall and spring. The entire refuge is designated as critical habitat for the endangered whooping crane, which is mostly seen during fall migration. In addition, the refuge is home to endangered least terns, threatened snowy plovers, threatened bald eagles, and peregrine falcons. Large populations of American white pelicans migrate through between August and September, staying on the Great Salt Plains Reservoir. Great Salt Plains is one of the most important habitats for shorebirds in the Western Hemisphere.

===Ralstin Island===
Ralstin Island (closed to the public) is an important rookery in the Great Salt Plains Lake. The island was originally , but has eroded to about . It hosts more than 30,000 birds during breeding season. Over 30 species nest in the colony, including the white-faced ibis, great blue herons, and most notably, the tricolored heron.

==History of the Great Salt Plains==
===Osage control of Great Salt Plains===
According to Historian Louis F. Burns, the Osage Indians used the salt found in the Great Salt Plains to bleach deer-skins and the Great Salt Plains gave the Osages a surplus of salt to trade with other tribes. According to Burns, the Osage were firmly in control of the Great Salt Plains by 1760 and because of a favorable combination of geographical factors, the Osages became the dominant force in mid—America. &quot;In a one hundred twenty-five year period, 1678-1803, the Osages performed a feat no other American Indians duplicated,&quot; writes Burns. &quot;They stopped the west-ward expansion of the Euro-American peoples and simultaneously tripled the size of their own domain.&quot;

===Sibley Expedition===
George Champlin Sibley was appointed head trader at the Indian Factory at Fort Osage, Missouri, when it opened in 1808. While at Fort Osage, Sibley quickly engaged in creating relationships with the neighboring Osage tribes. In May 1811 Sibley&#x27;s expedition left Fort Osage to examine the hunting grounds of the Osage. In 1811 his expedition was said to be the first white men to visit the plains. Sibley&#x27;s expedition, leaving from Fort Osage, Missouri was guided by an Osage Indian named Sans Orielle. Sibley named the area the Grand Saline. Sibley cut short his expedition when informed by reports that bands of Comanche were nearby. Sibley returned to Fort Osage on July 11, 1811 and reported that the salt deposits would eventually prove commercially profitable.

===Native American usage===
The Great Salt Plains have been the scene of many Indian Councils, both of war and peace. Because animals flocked to the area for the salt, the Great Salt Plains made for excellent hunting and it became obvious that any tribe that controlled the Salt Plains would have to contend with intrusions by other tribes. Therefore the Treaty of New Echota signed in 1835, provided the Cherokee Nation with ownership of the Cherokee Outlet but declared that the saline areas were to be accessible to use by other tribes. In drafting the treaty the United States Government withheld the Salt Plains area with the provision that, &quot;The right is reserved to the United States to allow other tribes of red men to get salt on the Great Salt Plains in common with the Cherokee Tribe.&quot;

===Chemical weapons discovery===
In 2007, a Boy Scout digging for crystals uncovered a collection of 7.5-inch vials containing chemical agents such as mustard gas, lewisite, chloropicrin, and phosgene. The vials were part of World War II-era military chemical agent identification sets. The burial of vials was standard procedure for removing them from service at that time. No record of a disposal site was reported at the salt plains. Crystal digging was suspended from April 2007 until April 2009, while the risk of allowing digging again was evaluated; 171 vials and at least a dozen incendiary devices were removed from the location.
The salt plains were also used as a bombing and strafing range during World War II. Remnants of this use are still left on the plains.

==Recreation==

Driving tour: The Harold F. Miller Auto Tour begins near the nature center. It is long and ends at Highway 11. The dirt road passes by ponds and fields where crops for wildlife are cultivated. White-tailed deer and other wildlife are common. A trail of leads to Casey Marsh Tower, where waterfowl are abundant and bald eagles can be seen in fall and winter.

Hiking: The Sandpiper Trail begins near the nature center and refuge office and leads to the edge of the salt flats and a birding observation platform. The Eagle Roost Nature Trail is a loop also beginning near the nature center. The trail goes through wooded and open areas, beneath towering cottonwood trees, past marshes and ponds, and to a shore and waterfowl watching area on Sand Creek Bay.

Selenite crystals: A designated area of the of salt flats at the refuge has gypsum concentrations high enough to grow selenite, a crystalline form of gypsum. The selenite crystals found there have an hourglass-shaped sand inclusion that is not known to occur in selenite crystals found elsewhere in the world. Digging for crystals is allowed, but only from April 1 through October 15 to protect this vital Whooping Crane habitat.
Hunting: About of the refuge north of Highway 11 are open for hunting. State laws apply, except deer may be hunted by permit only. Hunting is permitted for pheasant, northern bobwhite quail, mourning dove, ducks, geese, and sandhill cranes.

Fishing: According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the extreme drought of 2011 and 2012 has almost ended fishing as a recreational activity at the refuge. These conditions caused very large fish kills in the reservoir and restocking has been suspended. Fishing downstream of the dam is still permitted, but is greatly affected by local precipitation and the flow of the Great Salt River.

Information that follows indicate the practices in force prior to the 2011 drought, and may no longer apply:
Fishing is permitted from April 1 to October 15 on most of the refuge. Closed areas are marked by buoys or signs. Fishing in Bonham Pond is permitted only for children under 14 and mobility-handicapped persons and is catch-and-release. Salt Plains Lake is noted for large channel and other catfish. Other game fish include striped bass, largemouth bass, crappie, white bass, panfish, and walleye. State laws apply for bag limits and seasons, and the use of boats in the river and creeks is prohibited.

<text>Surfer is a 2001 EP by NOFX.

The record was released on Fat Mike&#x27;s record label, Fat Wreck Chords. The methodology for writing and recording the songs was much the same as the band&#x27;s &quot;Fuck the Kids&quot; EP. Fat Mike wrote all of the songs in a limited amount of time, claiming to have only given himself ten minutes to finish each one, and did not teach the songs to the rest of the band until the day of recording. The EP was recorded in two full-day sessions, making it one of the band&#x27;s fastest-completed EP or album recording, second to &quot;Fuck the Kids&quot; which was recorded and mixed in a day and a half.

The EP was later included on the second disc of &quot;45 or 46 Songs That Weren&#x27;t Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records&quot;, but with one track omitted (&quot;Three Shits to the Wind&quot;) in order to preserve something unique about the original 7&quot; release.

The album cover, painted by Mark deSalvo, and lyric sheet were inspired by Bad Religion&#x27;s 1988 record &quot;Suffer&quot;. Another reference to &quot;Suffer&quot; is etched into the vinyl: &quot;THE MASSES OF HUMANITY HAVE ALWAYS HAD TO SURF,&quot; as opposed to &quot;THE MASSES OF HUMANITY HAVE ALWAYS HAD TO SUFFER&quot; which is etched on the Bad Religion album. The artwork of the lyrics being written on a wall was also replicated for Surfer.

The record is 13 minutes in length. The first 500 copies were pressed on blue vinyl, while subsequent pressings were released on black vinyl.

<doc id="1249918" wikidata="Q4751621" url="?curid=1249918" title="Anarchism and capitalism">
<text>The nature of capitalism is criticized by left-wing anarchists, who reject hierarchy and advocate stateless societies based on non-hierarchical voluntary associations. Anarchism is generally defined as the libertarian philosophy which holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful as well as opposing authoritarianism, illegitimate authority and hierarchical organization in the conduct of human relations. Capitalism is generally considered by scholars to be an economic system that includes private ownership of the means of production, creation of goods or services for profit or income, the accumulation of capital, competitive markets, voluntary exchange and wage labor, which have generally been opposed by most anarchists historically. Since capitalism is variously defined by sources and there is no general consensus among scholars on the definition nor on how the term should be used as a historical category, the designation is applied to a variety of historical cases, varying in time, geography, politics and culture.

Anarcho-capitalists believe that capitalism is the absence of coercion and therefore fully compatible with the philosophy of anarchism; they claim that an effort to put a stop to what they consider &quot;voluntary hierarchy&quot; is inconsistent with the philosophical tradition of &quot;freedom&quot; present in anarchist thought. Some argue that anarcho-capitalism is a form of individualist anarchism, although this has been contested or rejected, including an individualist–socialist divide. Many others deny that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism at all, or that capitalism is compatible with anarchism, seeing it as a form of New Right libertarianism.

Anarcho-capitalist author and theorist Murray Rothbard, who coined the term itself and developed such philosophy from the 1950s through the 1970s, stated that individualist anarchism is different from capitalism because the individualist anarchists retain the labor theory of value and socialist doctrines. Left-wing anarchist commentators do not consider anarcho-capitalism as a legitimate form of anarchism due to perceived coercive characteristics of capitalism. In particular, they argue that certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion in violation of anarchist principles.

== Anarchist criticism of capitalism and economic issues ==

It has been pointed out that historically the anarcho-communist economic theories published by Peter Kropotkin and others have been ignored or intentionally sidelined by historians. Anarchists such as Kropotkin object to the portrayal of economics as a value-free science, arguing in &quot;Revolutionary Pamphlets&quot;:
Within the realm of anarchist labor issues is the issue of the monetary system. While all anarchists are against the current monetary system, there is disagreement as to whether or not there should be a monetary system. Alexander Berkman was an anarchist against the monetary system. In his book &quot;What Is Anarchism?&quot;, Berkman argues that in an anarchist society money would become unnecessary. Within anarchy, all occupations are viewed as equally beneficial to society. Since the concept of value is different for everyone and cannot be determined, it is argued that it should not be set and one&#x27;s contribution to society through their occupation entitled them to be a part of it. Within this system, there is a free distribution of goods without the need for money. Money in its current form is a hierarchical system, the exception being when all people are paid equal salaries. The argument goes further to question the purpose of money if people are paid equally. Those who agree with this would also note that a monetary system would open a vulnerability for some to acquire more of it and create a class system. Some individualist anarchists and mutualists do not oppose the idea of money and see currency as a tangible form of workers receiving the full product of their labor. They support mutual banking (some individualists support no banking at all to keep exchange rates constant) and local currency as opposed to national currency. Others see money as simply an index for exchanging goods and that its existence would not necessarily create a class system.

Some market abolitionist anarchists argue that while supporters of capitalism and the Austrian School in particular recognize equilibrium prices do not exist, they nonetheless claim that these prices can be used as a rational basis whilst this is not the case, hence markets are not efficient. Anarchists such as Rudolf Rocker argued that a state is required to maintain private property and for capitalism to function. Similarly, Albert Meltzer argued that anarcho-capitalism simply cannot be anarchism because capitalism and the state are inextricably interlinked and because capitalism exhibits domineering hierarchical structures such as that between an employer and an employee.

The anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within post-classical and contemporary currents. Anarchists are committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely &quot;all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism&quot;. Anarchist schools of thought disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.

=== Equality ===
Anarcho-capitalists believe that inequality is not a major concern so long as everyone has equality of opportunity. Anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard argued that &quot;the &#x27;rightist&#x27; libertarian is not opposed to inequality&quot;. Mises Institute author W. Duncan Reekie argue that because of a person&#x27;s self-ownership, any freedom given up in a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; marketplace would be a voluntary contract and that there is nothing authoritarian about capitalist employer–employee relationships in such a condition, writing: &quot;There is nothing authoritarian, dictatorial or exploitative in the relationship. Employees order employers to pay them amounts specified in the hiring contract just as much as employers order employees to abide by the terms of the contract&quot;. According to anarchist Peter Sabatini, anarcho-capitalists see &quot;nothing at all wrong with the amassing of wealth, therefore those with more capital will inevitably have greater coercive force at their disposal, just as they do now&quot;.

Rothbard defined equality as &quot;A and B are &#x27;equal&#x27; if they are identical to each other with respect to a given attribute. [...] There is one and only one way, then, in which any two people can really be &#x27;equal&#x27; in the fullest sense: they must be identical in all their attributes&quot;. Rothbard argued that &quot;men are not uniform, that the species, mankind, is uniquely characterized by a high degree of variety, diversity, differentiation; in short, inequality&quot;. This runs counter the concept of equality amongst anarchists as they argue that freedom without equality simply gives more freedom to those who are supposedly superior and that equality without freedom is a form of oppression.

Collectivist anarchist Mikhail Bakunin famously proclaimed: &quot;We are convinced that freedom without Socialism is privilege and injustice, and that Socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality&quot;. With equality meaning equal liberty, Bakunin also argued that &quot;I am truly free only when all human beings, men and women, are equally free. The freedom of other men, far from negating or limiting my freedom, is, on the contrary, its necessary premise and confirmation&quot;.

As further confirmation of equality&#x27;s misunderstanding, anarcho-communist Alexander Berkman similarly argued in &quot;The ABC of Anarchism&quot;:
While anarcho-capitalists such as Murray Rothbard consider themselves part of the individualist anarchist tradition, drawing upon the writings of early American individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner while rejecting their normative claims and other socialist doctrines, Tucker, Spooner and others argued that unequal wealth would not equal an unequal society. Those anarchists believed that equality of condition, equality of access to the means of production and equal opportunity would counteract any potential tyranny in a market society. In following William Godwin, anarchists insist that &quot;inequality corrupts freedom. Their anarchism is directed as much against inequality as against tyranny&quot;. It has been argued that while anarcho-capitalists such Rothbard and David D. Friedman have been &quot;sympathetic to Spooner&#x27;s individualist anarchism&quot;, they &quot;fail to notice or conveniently overlook its egalitarian implications&quot;. Tucker argued for a society with &quot;the greatest amount of liberty compatible with equality of liberty&quot;.

=== Private property ===
There is some debate about the question of private property and economic organization which is mainly caused by the meaning of private property. Social anarchists claim that the existence of private property (productive property) results in wage slavery while certain anti-capitalist individualist anarchists and mutualists argue for private property (personal property and possessions) and wages owned and controlled directly by workers themselves in the form of worker cooperatives such as labor-owned cooperative firms and associations. For the anarchist and socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, &quot;strong workers&#x27; associations would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis&quot;.

One major point of contention between anarchism and anarcho-capitalism, causing the latter as not being recognized as part of anarchism, remains that of &quot;private property&quot; and its meaning. By &quot;property&quot;, or &quot;private property&quot;, ever since Proudhon&#x27;s book &quot;What is Property?&quot;, published in 1840, anarchists meant possession (what other socialists, including Marxists and communists, distingue as personal property) which he considered as liberty (&quot;Property is liberty&quot;) versus productive property (such as land and infrastructure, or what Marxists terms the &quot;means of production&quot; and the &quot;means of labor&quot;) which he considered as theft (&quot;Property is theft&quot;), causing him to also say &quot;Property is impossible&quot;. However, some individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker started calling possession as &quot;property&quot; or &quot;private property&quot;.

While anarcho-capitalists make no distinction between &quot;private property&quot; and &quot;personal property&quot;, this is extremely important to anarchists and other socialists because in the capitalist mode of production private and personal property are considered to be exactly equivalent. They make the following distinctions:
* Personal property, or possession, includes items intended for personal use (e.g. one&#x27;s toothbrush, clothes, homes, vehicles and sometimes money). It must be gained in a socially fair manner and the owner has a distributive right to exclude others.
* Anarchists generally agree that private property is a social relationship between the owner and persons deprived (not a relationship between person and thing), e.g. artifacts, factories, mines, dams, infrastructure, natural vegetation, mountains, deserts and seas. In this context, private property and ownership means ownership of the means of production, not personal possessions.
* To anarchists and other socialists alike, &quot;private property&quot; is capital or the means of production while &quot;personal property&quot; is consumer and non-capital goods and services.

=== Wage labor ===
Anarcho-capitalists support wage labor and do not explicitly support workplace democracy and workers&#x27; self-management as anarchists do, claiming that wage labor is always voluntary. However, anarchists argue that certain capitalist transactions, including wage labor, are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion which violates both anarchist principles and anarcho-capitalism&#x27;s non-aggression principle.

Individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker, who identified his individualist anarchism as &quot;anarchistic socialism&quot;, are opposed to both capitalism and compulsory communism. Those anarchists support wage labor as long as the employers and employees are paid equally for equal hours worked and neither party has authority over the other. This approach was put into practice in American individualist anarchist colonies such as Utopia, organized by Josiah Warren. By following this principle, no individual profits from the labor of another. Tucker described the wages received in such an employer-employee relationship as the individual laborer&#x27;s full product. He envisioned that in such a society every worker would be self-employed and own their own private means of production, free to walk away from employment contracts. Tucker called communism &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot; because it opposes wages and property, fearing that collectivization would subdue individuals to group mentality and rob workers of the full product of their labor.

The Preamble to the Constitution of the anarcho-syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World labor union states unequivocally: Instead of the conservative motto, &quot;A fair day&#x27;s wage for a fair day&#x27;s work,&quot; we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, &quot;Abolition of the wage system.&quot;

== Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism ==
=== Anarcho-capitalism ===
Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy that espouses anything voluntary is moral, including a voluntary employee/employer hierarchy which anarchists reject. Anarcho-capitalists advocate the elimination of centralised state in favour of self-ownership and individual sovereignty, private property and free markets. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical American anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from Austrian School economics and public choice theory. Anarcho-capitalists are distinguished from minarchists, who advocate a small Jeffersonian night-watchman state limited to protecting individuals and their properties from foreign and domestic aggression; and from anarchists, who support personal property and oppose private ownership of the means of production, interest, profit, rent and wage slavery which they view as inherent to capitalism. Anarcho-capitalists hold that in the absence of statute, society tends to contractually self-regulate and civilize through the spontaneous and organic discipline of the free market in what its proponents describe as a voluntary society.

In an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors selected by consumers rather than centrally through confiscatory taxation. Along with all other goods and services, money would be privately and competitively provided in an open market and personal and economic activities would be regulated by victim-based dispute resolution organizations under tort and contract law, rather than by statute through centrally determined punishment under political monopolies which tend to become corrupt in proportion to their monopolization. Business regulations such as corporate standards, public relations, product labels, rules for consumer protection, ethics and labor relations would be regulated voluntarily via the use of competitive trade associations, professional societies and standards bodies. In theory, this would establish market-recourse for businesses&#x27; decisions and allow the market to communicate effectively with businesses by the use of consumer unions instead of centralized regulatory mandates for companies imposed by the state which anarcho-capitalists argue is inefficient due to regulatory capture.

Anarcho-capitalists such as Hans-Hermann Hoppe claim that their philosophy predates the socialist forms of anarchism as according to them various liberal theorists have espoused legal and political philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism. However, the first person to use the term &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; was Murray Rothbard, who synthesized in the mid-20th century elements from the Austrian School, classical liberalism and 19th-century American individualist anarchists Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner while rejecting their labor theory of value and the norms they derived from it. A Rothbardian anarcho-capitalist society would operate under a mutually agreed-upon libertarian &quot;legal code which would be generally accepted, and which the courts would pledge themselves to follow&quot;. This pact would recognize self-ownership, property, contracts and tort law in keeping with the universal non-aggression principle, with anarcho-capitalists arguing that it represents the only pure form of anarchism.

Rothbard argued that the capitalist system is not properly anarcho-capitalist because it so often colludes with the state, writing: &quot;The difference between free-market capitalism and state capitalism is precisely the difference between, on the one hand, peaceful, voluntary exchange, and on the other, violent expropriation. State capitalism inevitably creates all sorts of problems which become insoluble&quot;. According to Rothbard, &quot;what Marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term. These two contradictory concepts are what I would call &#x27;free-market capitalism&#x27; on the one hand, and &#x27;state capitalism&#x27; on the other&quot;. However, despite Rothbard&#x27;s claims, Marxists do make a distinction between free-market capitalism and state capitalism. The term &quot;state capitalism&quot; was first used by Marxist politician Wilhelm Liebknecht in 1896 and Friedrich Engels, who developed Marxist theory, talked about capitalism with state ownership as a different form of capitalism.

Rothbard maintained that anarcho-capitalism is the only true form of anarchism—the only form of anarchism that could possibly exist in reality as he argues that any other form presupposes an authoritarian enforcement of political ideology such as &quot;redistribution of private property&quot;. According to this argument, the free market is simply the natural situation that would result from people being free from authority and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society such as cooperatives, non-profit organizations, businesses and so on. Moreover, anarcho-capitalists as well as classical liberal minarchists argue that the application of anarchist ideals as advocated by what they term &quot;left-wing anarchists&quot; would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it. Based on their understanding of anarchism, in order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating capital, which they believe is a goal of those anarchists, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to in essence exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people. They conclude that this body would inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state. The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is what anarcho-capitalists see as the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which they believe would be necessary under a &quot;coercively&quot; egalitarian-anarchist system. On the other hand, anarchists argue that a state is required to maintain private property and for capitalism to function.

Rothbard also wrote a piece published posthumously entitled &quot;Are Libertarians &#x27;Anarchists&#x27;?&quot; in which he traced the etymological roots of anarchist philosophy, ultimately coming to the conclusion that &quot;we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists, and therefore at opposite poles from our position. That none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position, that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines&quot;. Furthermore, he wrote: &quot;We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical. On the other hand, it is clear that we are not archists either: we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive. Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist&quot;.

==== Anarchist view ====
Conversely, many anarchists do not believe that anarcho-capitalism can be considered to be a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and see anarchism as fundamentally incompatible with capitalism because capitalism produces an economic hierarchy. Throughout its history, anarchism has been defined by its proponents in opposition to capitalism which they believe can be maintained only by state violence. Anarchists follow Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in opposing ownership of workplaces by capitalists and aim to replace wage labor with workers&#x27; associations. Anarchists also agree with Peter Kropotkin&#x27;s comment that &quot;the origin of the anarchist inception of society [lies in] the criticism [...] of the hierarchical organisations and the authoritarian conceptions of society&quot; rather than in simple opposition to the state or government. They argue that the wage system is hierarchical and authoritarian in nature and consequently capitalism cannot be anarchist.

Individualist anarchists, including Tucker and Spooner who Rothbard claimed as anarcho-capitalist influences, considered themselves &quot;fervent anti-capitalists [who see] no contradiction between their individualist stance and their rejection of capitalism&quot;. Many defined themselves as socialists. Those early individualist anarchists defined capitalism in various ways, but it was often discussed in terms of usury: &quot;There are three forms of usury, interest on money, rent on land and houses, and profit in exchange. Whoever is in receipt of any of these is a usurer&quot;. Excluding these, they tended to support free trade, free competition and varying levels of private property such as mutualism based on occupation and use property norms. It is this distinction which has led to the rift between anarchism and anarcho-capitalism, with the latter supporting the homestead principle. As anarchists consider themselves to be socialists and opposed to capitalism, anarcho-capitalism is seen as not being a form of anarchism.

Anarchist organisations such as the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (Spain) and the Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland) generally take an explicitly anti-capitalist stance. When in the 20th century several economists began to formulate a form of radical American libertarianism known as anarcho-capitalism, this has met resistance from those who hold that capitalism is inherently oppressive or statist and many anarchists and scholars do not consider anarcho-capitalism to properly cohere with the spirit, principles, or history of anarchism. While other anarchists and scholars regard anarchism as referring only to opposition to the non-privatisation of all aspects of the state and do consider anarcho-capitalism to be a form of anarchism,Kevin Carson, Roderick T. Long, Charles W. Johnson, Brad Spangler, Sheldon Richman and Chris Matthew Sciabarra maintain that—because of its heritage, emancipatory goals and potential—radical market anarchism should be seen by its proponents and by others as part of the socialist tradition and that market anarchists can and should call themselves socialists, echoing the language of American individualist anarchists like Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner and British Thomas Hodgskin.

William Gillis has argued that proponents of a genuinely free market, termed &quot;freed market&quot; to distinguish it from the common conception which those left-libertarians believe markets to be riddled with capitalist and statist privileges, should explicitly reject capitalism and identify with the global anti-capitalist movement while emphasizing that the abuses the anti-capitalist movement highlights result from state-tolerated violence and state-secured privilege rather than from voluntary cooperation and exchange. Those left-libertarians, also referred to as left-wing market anarchists and market-oriented left-libertarians, distingue themselves from anarcho-capitalists. Like anarcho-capitalists, proponents of this approach strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, but they maintain that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support anti-capitalist, anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical and pro-labor positions in economics; anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and thoroughly radical views regarding socio-cultural issues.

Anarcho-capitalists who argue for private property which supports absentee and landlordism ownership rather than occupation and use property norms as well as the principle of homesteading are considered right-libertarians rather than anarchists. This is due to anarchism, including the individualists, viewing any absentee ownership and ownership claims on land and natural resources as immoral and illegitimate, seeing the idea of perpetually binding original appropriation as advocated by some anarcho-capitalists as anathema to schools of anarchism as well as to any moral or economic philosophy that takes equal natural rights to land and the Earth&#x27;s resources as a premise.

Left-wing market anarchists are closer to mutualism and part of the market anarchist tradition in arguing that a true free-market or &quot;laissez-faire&quot; system would be best served under socialism rather than capitalism. Chartier has argued that anarcho-capitalists should reject capitalism and call themselves &quot;freed-market advocates&quot;, writing:
[I]t makes sense for [freed-market advocates] to name what they oppose &quot;capitalism.&quot; Doing so calls attention to the freedom movement&#x27;s radical roots, emphasizes the value of understanding society as an alternative to the state, underscores the fact that proponents of freedom object to non-aggressive as well as aggressive restraints on liberty, ensures that advocates of freedom aren&#x27;t confused with people who use market rhetoric to prop up an unjust status quo, and expresses solidarity between defenders of freed markets and workers — as well as ordinary people around the world who use &quot;capitalism&quot; as a short-hand label for the world-system that constrains their freedom and stunts their lives.

==== Criticism of anarcho-capitalism ====

Anarchists argue that anarcho-capitalism does not in fact get rid of the state and that it simply privatises it. According to Brian Morris, anarcho-capitalists &quot;simply replaced the state with private security firms, and can hardly be described as anarchists as the term is normally understood&quot;. According to anarchist Peter Sabatini, anarcho-capitalism &quot;represents a minority perspective that actually argues for the total elimination of the state&quot;, but that anarcho-capitalists&#x27; claim as anarchists is &quot;quickly voided&quot; because they &quot;only wants an end to the public state&quot; and allow &quot;countless private states&quot;, or that it dissolves into city states as argued by Paul Birch.

Another criticism is that anarcho-capitalism turns justice into a commodity as private defense and court firms would favour those who pay more for their services. Anarchists such as Albert Meltzer argue that since anarcho-capitalism promotes the idea of private armies such as private defense agencies, it actually supports a &quot;limited State&quot;. Meltzer contends that it &quot;is only possible to conceive of Anarchism which is free, communistic and offering no economic necessity for repression of countering it&quot;. Anarcho-capitalists believe that negative rights should be recognized as legitimate, but positive rights should be rejected. Some critics reject the distinction between positive and negative rights, including Peter Marshall and Noam Chomsky. Marshall argues that the anarcho-capitalist definition of freedom is entirely negative and that it cannot guarantee the positive freedom of individual autonomy and independence. About anarcho-capitalism, Chomsky has written:
Anarchists argue that certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion which violates both anarchist principles and anarcho-capitalism&#x27;s non-aggression principle.

Anarchists view any ownership claims on land and natural resources as immoral and illegitimate. While anarchists, including individualist anarchists, market anarchists and mutualists, adamantly oppose absentee ownership, anarcho-capitalists have strong abandonment criteria in which one maintains ownership until one agrees to trade or gift it. Anarchists critics of this view tend to have comparatively weak abandonment criteria as one loses ownership when one stops personally occupying and using it. Furthermore, the idea of perpetually binding original appropriation is considered to be anathema to anarchist schools of thought as well as to any moral or economic philosophy that takes equal natural rights to land and the Earth&#x27;s resources as a premise.

==== Definitional issues ====
Anarchist schools of thought encompass not only a range of individual schools, but also a considerable divergence in the use of some key terms. Some terms such as &quot;socialism&quot; have been subject to multiple definitions and ideological struggle throughout the period of the development of anarchism. Others such as &quot;capitalism&quot; are used in divergent and often contradictory ways by different schools within the tradition. In addition, the meanings of terms such as &quot;mutualism&quot; have changed over time, sometimes without spawning new schools. All of these terminological difficulties contribute to misunderstandings within and about anarchism. A central concern is whether &quot;anarchism&quot; is defined in opposition to hierarchy, authority and the state, or simply capitalism and the state. Debates over the meaning of &quot;anarchism&quot; emerge from the fact that it refers to both an abstract philosophical position and to intellectual, political and institutional traditions, all of which have been fraught with conflict. Some minimal, abstract definitions encourage the inclusion of figures, movements and philosophical positions which have historically positioned themselves outside, or even in opposition to, individuals and traditions that have identified themselves as anarchist. While anti-statism is central, there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.

While it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organization (including the state, capitalism, nationalism and all associated institutions) in the conduct of all human relations in favour of a society based on voluntary association, freedom and decentralisation, this definition has its own shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an &quot;a posteriori&quot; concussion). Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of &quot;anarchism&quot; include the following:
# The will for a non-coercive society.
# The rejection of the state apparatus.
# The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society.
# A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.

Usages in political circles have varied considerably. In 1888, the individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker included the full text of a &quot;Socialistic Letter&quot; by Ernest Lesigne in his essay on &quot;State Socialism and Anarchism&quot;. According to Lesigne, there are two socialisms: &quot;One is dictatorial, the other libertarian&quot;. In 1894, Richard T. Ely noted that &quot;anarchism&quot; had &quot;already acquired a variety of meanings&quot;. In its most general sense, these included the view that society is &quot;a living, growing organism, the laws of which are something different from the laws of individual action&quot;. Anti-capitalism is considered a necessary element of anarchism by anarchists. The usage of &quot;libertarian&quot; is also in dispute. While both anarchists and anarcho-capitalist have used it, &quot;libertarian&quot; was synonymous with &quot;anarchism&quot; until the mid-20th century, when anarcho-capitalist theory developed.

Anarcho-capitalists are distinguished from the dominant anarchist tradition by their relation to property and capital. While both anarchism and anarcho-capitalism share general antipathy towards power by government authority, the latter exempts power wielded through free-market capitalism. Anarchists, including egoists such as Max Stirner, have supported the protection of an individual&#x27;s freedom from powers of both government and private property owners. In contrast, while condemning governmental encroachment on personal liberties, anarcho-capitalists support freedoms based on private property rights. Anarcho-capitalist theorist Murray Rothbard argued that protesters should rent a street for protest from its owners. The abolition of public amenities is a common theme in some anarcho-capitalist writings.

As anarcho-capitalism puts &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics before economic equality, it is commonly viewed as incompatible with the anti-capitalist and egalitarian tradition of anarchism. Although anarcho-capitalist theory implies the abolition of the state in favour of a fully &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economy, it lies outside the tradition of anarchism. While using the language of anarchism, anarcho-capitalism only shares anarchism&#x27;s antipathy towards the state and not anarchism&#x27;s antipathy towards hierarchy as theorists expect from anarcho-capitalist economic power relations. It follows a different paradigm from anarchism and has a fundamentally different approach and goals. In spite of the &quot;anarcho-&quot; in its title, anarcho-capitalism is more closely affiliated with capitalism and right-libertarianism than with anarchism. Some within this &quot;laissez-faire&quot; tradition reject the designation of &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot;, believing that &quot;capitalism&quot; may either refer to the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; market they support or the government-regulated system that they oppose.

===== Categorizations =====
Owing to the many anarchist schools of thought, anarchism can be divided into two or more categories, the most used being that of individualist anarchism and social anarchism. Other categorizations may include green anarchism and/or left anarchism and right anarchism. Terms such as &quot;anarcho-socialism&quot; or &quot;socialist anarchism&quot; are rejected by most anarchists since they generally consider themselves socialists of the libertarian tradition and are seen as unnecessary and confusing when not used as synonymous with &quot;libertarian&quot; or &quot;stateless socialism&quot; and contrasted with &quot;authoritarian&quot; or &quot;state socialism&quot;, but they are nevertheless used by anarcho-capitalist theorists and scholars who recognize anarcho-capitalism to differentiate between the two, or what is otherwise referred to as &quot;social anarchism&quot;.

Anarchist schools of thought such as anarcha-feminism, anarcho-pacifism, anarcho-primitivism, anarcho-transhumanism and green anarchism may have different views of anarchist economics and be part of either individualist anarchism or social anarchism. Since anarchism has been historically identified with the socialist and anti-capitalist movement as well as with socialist economics, the main divide within anarchism is between anti-market anarchists and pro-market anarchists. Anarchists reject both anarcho-capitalism as a form of individualist anarchism and categorizations such as left anarchism and right anarchism (anarcho-capitalism and national-anarchism). Anarchism is usually seen by anarchists and scholars alike as a libertarian socialist and radical left-wing or far-left ideology. According to Peter Marshall, in general &quot;anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism. [...] Anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp, but it also has outriders in liberalism. It cannot be reduced to socialism, and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine&quot;. Contra the collectivist or communist wing of social anarchism, seen as representing the more class-struggle oriented and revolutionary socialist-aligned forms of anarchism, individualist anarchism has been described as the anarchist school most influenced by and tied to liberalism (especially classical liberalism) as well as the liberal-socialist or socialist-liberal wing of anarchism and libertarian socialism.

To differentiate it from individualist anarchism, anarchists prefer using &quot;social anarchism&quot; to characterize certain strides of anarchism from individualist anarchism. The former focuses on the social aspect and is more working class and mass organisational-oriented, supporting decentralised economic planning. The latter focuses on the individual, is more anti-organisational and supports either free-market forms of socialism or other anarchist economics. Nonetheless, anarchists do not seeing the two categories as mutually exclusive or as representing socialist and capitalist views within anarchism. This led to anarchism without adjectives. Mutualism is seen as the middle or third category between social anarchism and individualist anarchism, although it is often considered part of social anarchism and sometimes part of individualist anarchism. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon spoke of social individualism and described the mutualism and the freedom it pursued as the synthesis between communism and property.

While some anarcho-capitalists theorists and scholars divide anarchism into individualist anarchism and social anarchism as representing capitalist and socialist viewpoints, anarchist theorists and scholars reject this. Anarchists do not see this as a struggle between socialism and capitalism, or as social anarchism and individualist anarchism as being mutually exclusive, but rather as complementary. Their differences comes from the means to attain anarchy rather than on their ends. Against some anarcho-capitalist theorists and scholars who see individualist anarchism as pro-capitalist, anarchists reiterate that anarchism is socialist, meaning anti-statist and libertarian socialism. Anarchists such as Luigi Galleani and Errico Malatesta have seen no contradiction between individualist anarchism and social anarchism, with the latter especially seeing the issues not between the two forms of anarchism, but between anarchists and non-anarchists. Anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker argued that it was &quot;not Socialist Anarchism against Individualist Anarchism, but of Communist Socialism against Individualist Socialism&quot;. The view of an individualist–socialist divide is contested as individualist anarchism is socialistic.

Several anarcho-communists regard themselves as radical individualists, seeing anarcho-communism as the best social system for the realization of individual freedom. Notwithstanding the name, collectivist anarchism is seen as a blend of individualism and collectivism. Anarchism is considered an anti-authoritarian philosophy that see the individual and the community as complementary rather than mutually exclusive, with anarcho-communism and social anarchism in particular most rejecting the individualist–collectivist dichotomy. In the United States, &quot;social anarchism&quot; may refer to Murray Bookchin&#x27;s circle and its omonymous journal.

Despite their differences, anarchist schools of thought are forms of libertarian socialism. Anarchists may see those categorisation in materialist terms. From a materialist perspective, individualist anarchism represents the anarchist form in the pre-capitalist and largely agrarian merchantilist capitalism before the Industrial Revolution, during which individualist anarchism became a form of artisanal and self-employed socialism, especially in the United States. Social anarchism represents the anarchism in an industrial society, being the form of industrial or proletarian socialism, with post-left anarchy and its criticism of industrial technology and anti-workerism arising in a post-industrial society.

Before &quot;socialism&quot; became associated in the 20th century with Marxist–Leninist states and similar forms of authoritarian and statist socialism, considered by some as state capitalism and administrative command economies rather than planned economies, socialism was a broad concept which was aimed at solving the labor problem through radical changes in the capitalist economy. This caused issues between anarchists and anarcho-capitalists, whose understanding of &quot;socialism&quot; is that of the 20th century Marxist–Leninist states, with &quot;capitalism&quot; meaning the free market rather than actually existing capitalism.

===== Left and right anarchism =====
&quot;Left anarchism&quot; and &quot;left-wing anarchism&quot; distinguish social anarchism from anarcho-capitalism and anti-state right-libertarian philosophies. &quot;Left anarchism&quot; represents political philosophies which posit a future society in which private property is replaced by reciprocity and non-hierarchical society.

&quot;Left anarchism&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;libertarian socialism&quot;, &quot;left-libertarianism&quot;, or &quot;social anarchism&quot;. Anarchists typically discourage the concept of &quot;left anarchism&quot; on grounds of redundancy and that it lends legitimacy to the notion that anarchism is compatible with capitalism or nationalism.

German author Ulrike Heider categorizes anarchism into left anarchism (anarcho-syndicalism), right anarchism (anarcho-capitalism) and green anarchism.

=== Free-market anarchism ===

Although &quot;laissez-faire&quot; has been commonly associated with capitalism and anarcho-capitalists advocate such a system, there is a similar left-wing or socialist &quot;laissez-faire&quot; system called free-market anarchism, also referred to as free-market anti-capitalism and free-market socialism to distinguish it from &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism. One first example of this is mutualism as developed by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in the 18th century, from which emerged individualist anarchism. Benjamin Tucker is one eminent American individualist anarchist who adopted a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; system he termed &quot;anarchistic socialism&quot; in contraposition to &quot;state socialism&quot;. This tradition has been recently associated with contemporary scholars such as Kevin Carson, Roderick T. Long, Charles W. Johnson, Brad Spangler, Sheldon Richman, Chris Matthew Sciabarra and Gary Chartier, who are critics of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; as commonly understood and instead argue that a truly &quot;laissez-faire&quot; system would be anti-capitalist and socialist.

Murray Rothbard, who coined the term &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; and advocated such philosophy, argued that the robber baron period, hailed by the right and despised by the left as a heyday of &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, was not characterized by &quot;laissez-faire&quot; at all, but it was in fact a time of massive state privilege accorded to capital. The doyen of modern American market-oriented libertarianism and an Austrian School economist, Rothbard was initially an enthusiastic partisan of the Old Right, particularly because of its general opposition to war and imperialism. However, Rothbard had long embraced a reading of American history that emphasized the role of elite privilege in shaping legal and political institutions—one that was naturally agreeable to many on the left—and came increasingly in the 1960s to seek alliances on the left and especially with members of the New Left in light of the Vietnam War, the military draft and the emergence of the Black Power movement. Working with other radicals like Ronald Radosh and Karl Hess, Rothbard argued that the consensus view of American economic history, according to which a beneficent government has used its power to counter corporate predation, is fundamentally flawed. Rather, he argued that government intervention in the economy has largely benefited established players at the expense of marginalized groups, to the detriment of both liberty and equality. In tandem with his emphasis on the intimate connection between state and corporate power, he defended the seizure of corporations dependent on state largesse by workers and others. Rothbard ultimately broke with the left, allying himself instead with the burgeoning paleoconservative movement.

This caused a divide between left-Rothbardians and right-Rothbardians, with most right-Rothbardians identifying as anarcho-capitalists, conservatives, paleoconservatives, paleolibertarians, propertarians or right-libertarians whereas left-Rothbardians and some thinkers associated with market-oriented libertarianism, drawing on the work of Rothbard during his alliance with the left and on the thought of Karl Hess, came increasingly to identify with the left on a range of issues, including opposition to war, corporate oligopolies and state-corporate partnerships as well as an affinity for cultural liberalism against Rothbard&#x27;s later cultural conservatism and right-wing populism. One variety of this kind of libertarianism has been a resurgent mutualism, incorporating modern economic ideas such as marginal utility theory into mutualist theory. Carson&#x27;s &quot;Studies in Mutualist Political Economy&quot; helped to stimulate the growth of new-style mutualism, articulating a version of the labor theory of value incorporating ideas drawn from Austrian economics.

Some left-Rothbardians are mutualists whereas other left-Rothbardians and market-oriented left-libertarians have declined to embrace mutualist views of real property while sharing the mutualist opposition to corporate hierarchies and wealth concentration. Those left-libertarians have placed particular emphasis on the articulation and defense of a libertarian theory of class and class conflict, although considerable work in this area has been performed by libertarians of other persuasions. Those left-Rothbardians and libertarians maintain that because of its heritage and its emancipatory goals and potential radical market anarchism should be seen by its proponents and by others as part of the socialist tradition and that market anarchists like anarcho-capitalists can and should call themselves socialists, echoing the language of libertarian socialists like American individualist anarchists Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner and British Thomas Hodgskin. Some of those left-Rothbardians have used Rothbardian arguments such as the homestead principle and a labor theory of property to support anarchist concepts such as workers&#x27; self-management.

In response to claims from anarcho-capitalists that he uses the term &quot;capitalism&quot; incorrectly, Kevin Carson says he is deliberately choosing to resurrect what he claims to be an old definition of the term in order to &quot;make a point&quot;. He claims that &quot;the term &#x27;capitalism,&#x27; as it was originally used, did not refer to a free market, but to a type of statist class system in which capitalists controlled the state and the state intervened in the market on their behalf&quot;. Carson holds that &quot;capitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the Middle Ages, was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier feudal conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable&quot;. In addition to individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker&#x27;s big four monopolies (land, money, tariffs and patents), Carson argues that the state has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization in the form of transportation and communication subsidies, arguing that in a truly &quot;laissez-faire&quot; system the ability to extract a profit from labor and capital would be negligible. In response to criticism from anarcho-capitalists who reject the labor theory of value in favor of the subjective theory of value and support marginalism, the theoretical sections of Carson&#x27;s &quot;Studies in Mutualist Political Economy&quot; are presented as an attempt to integrate marginalist critiques into the labor theory of value.

Gary Chartier offers an understanding of property rights as contingent yet tightly constrained social strategies, reflective of the importance of multiple, overlapping rationales for separate ownership and of natural law principles of practical reasonableness, defending robust yet non-absolute protections for these rights in a manner similar to that employed by David Hume. This account is distinguished from anarcho-capitalists who are propertarian and hold Lockean and neo-Lockean views which deduce property rights from the idea of self-ownership and from consequentialist accounts that might license widespread ad hoc interference with the possessions of groups and individuals. Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the natural law basis for the view that solidaristic wealth redistribution by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response by individuals and grass-roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to achieve a particular distributive pattern. Chartier advances detailed arguments for workplace democracy rooted in such natural law principles as subsidiarity which anarcho-capitalists reject, defending it instead as morally desirable and as a likely outcome of the elimination of injustice rather than as something to be mandated by the state. He also discusses natural law approaches to land reform and to the occupation of factories by workers which anarcho-capitalists may see as infringing on property owners&#x27; rights. Against anarcho-capitalists who support intellectual property, Chartier objects on natural law grounds to intellectual property protections, drawing on his theory of property rights more generally and developing a general natural law account of boycotts.

==== Left-wing market anarchism ====

Left-wing market anarchism is a form of individualist anarchism, libertarian socialism and free-market anarchism as distinct from anarcho-capitalism, whose genealogy overlaps to a significant degree with that of Steiner–Vallentyne left-libertarianism as the roots of that tradition are sketched in the book &quot;The Origins of Left-Libertarianism&quot;. Carson–Long-style left-libertarianism is rooted in 19th-century mutualism and in the work of figures such as American individualist anarchists Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner and Thomas Hodgskin, a British critic of capitalism and defender of free trade and early trade unions. Relationships between such market anarchists and the New Left thrived in the 1960s, laying the groundwork for modern left-wing market anarchism.

Left-wing market anarchism identifies with left-libertarianism whereas anarcho-capitalism is considered a form of right-libertarianism. Unlike anarcho-capitalists, they believe that neither claiming nor mixing one&#x27;s labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights and those who support private property do so under occupation and use property norms as in mutualism or under the condition that recompense is offered to the local or even global community as advocated by geoists and geolibertarians. Arguing that vast disparities in wealth and social influence result from the use of force and especially state power to steal and engross land and acquire and maintain special privileges, members of this thought typically urge the abolition of the state. They judge that in a stateless society, the kinds of privileges secured by the state will be absent and injustices perpetrated or tolerated by the state can be rectified. According to libertarian scholar Sheldon Richman:
Unlike anarcho-captalists, left-wing market anarchism explicitly supports the labor movement and their struggles. Left-wing market anarchist Kevin Carson has praised individualist anarchist Dyer Lum&#x27;s fusion of individualist economics with radical labor activism as &quot;creative&quot; and described him as &quot;more significant than any in the Boston group&quot;. Left-libertarian philosopher Roderick T. Long is an advocate of &quot;build[ing] worker solidarity. On the one hand, this means formal organisation, including unionization – but I&#x27;m not talking about the prevailing model of &quot;business unions,&quot; [...] but real unions, the old-fashioned kind, committed to the working class and not just union members, and interested in worker autonomy, not government patronage&quot;. In particular, Long has described the situation as follows:
Contemporary left-wing market anarchists show markedly more sympathy than anarcho-capitalists towards various cultural movements which challenge non-governmental relations of power. Left-wing market anarchists such as Roderick T. Long and Charles W. Johnson have called for a recovery of the 19th-century alliance with radical liberalism and feminism. While adopting similar views, including opposition to drug prohibition, gun control, civil liberties violations and war, left-wing market anarchists are more likely than most self-identified anarcho-capitalists to take more distinctively leftist stances on issues as diverse as feminism, gender and sexuality, class, immigration and environmentalism. Especially influential regarding these topics have been scholars including Long, Johnson, Chris Matthew Sciabarra and Arthur Silber. Unlike anarcho-capitalism, left-wing market anarchism also does not have any strict agreement what constitutes legitimate property titles. Arguments have been made for Rothbardian, Georgist, mutualist and utilitarian approaches to determining legitimate property claims. Those discrepancies are resolved through deliberation mechanisms like the polycentric law. Unlike anarcho-capitalists, left-wing market anarchists recognize the importance of property held and managed in common as a way of maintaining common goods.

Market anarchists recognize that anarchism has been historically identified with the socialist and anti-capitalist movement, arguing that anarcho-capitalists should explicitly reject capitalism and identify with the global anti-capitalist movement since by &quot;capitalism&quot; they mean the free market rather than actually existing capitalism, of which they are critics rather than capitalism itself, arguing that the problem rests on cronyism and state capitalism. The latter is used by anarchists to criticize state socialism as nothing more than state capitalism. Much like &quot;socialism&quot; has been conflated with state socialism in the 20th century due to Marxist–Leninist states, &quot;capitalism&quot; has been similarly conflated with the free market when &quot;capitalism&quot; was coined in the 18th century to mean a construed political system built on privileges for the owners of capital.

Left-wing market anarchists argue that capitalism necessarily rest on the state to survive and that it was always seen as what would be later termed &quot;state capitalism&quot;. Those anarchists make the point that &quot;free market&quot; for classical economists such as Adam Smith did not mean a market free from government or social interference as it is now commonly assumed or as anarcho-capitalists argue, but rather free from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies and artificial scarcities, implying that economic rents, i.e. profits generated from a lack of perfect competition, must be reduced or eliminated as much as possible through free competition. Those anarchists argue that a true free-market or &quot;laissez-faire&quot; system would be better served under socialism rather than capitalism. &quot;Anarcho-socialism&quot; or &quot;socialist anarchism&quot; are rejected by anarchists since they consider themselves socialists of the libertarian tradition and are used by anarcho-capitalist theorists and scholars who recognize anarcho-capitalism to differentiate between the two.

=== Globalization ===

Anarchists are actively involved in the anti-globalization movement, seeing corporate globalization as a neocolonialist attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the Group of Eight, the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and the World Trade Organization. &quot;Globalization&quot; is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Many anarchists use the term to mean cultural imperialism and neocolonialism which they see as related. Anarcho-capitalists use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene. Anarcho-capitalists see the worldwide expansion of the division of labor through trade as a boon, but they oppose the regulation and cartelization imposed by global institutions and managed-trade agreements such as the Central America Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Anarcho-capitalists also object to fiat money issued by central banks and resulting debasement of money and confiscation of wealth. Groups such as Reclaim the Streets were among the instigators of the so-called anti-globalization movement.

The Carnival Against Capitalism on 18 June 1999 is generally regarded as the first of the major anti-globalization protests. Anarchists such as the WOMBLES have on occasion played a significant role in planning, organising and participating in subsequent protests. The protests tended to be organised on anarchist direct action principles with a general tolerance for a range of different activities ranging from those who engage in tactical frivolity to the black blocs.

<text>The Fer language, also &quot;Dam Fer&quot; or &quot;Fertit,&quot; one of several languages called Kara (&quot;Kara of Birao&quot;), is a Central Sudanic language spoken by some five thousand people in the northern Central African Republic near the Sudanese and Chadian borders, in the region known as Dar Runga.

While the Ethnologue leaves it unclassified, it appears to be a Bongo–Bagirmi language within the Central Sudanic family (Lionel Bender, Pascal Boyeldieu); Roger Blench classifies &quot;Fer&quot; as Bagirmi, but &quot;Kara of Birao&quot; as one of the related Kara languages.

<text>Arjen Anthony Lucassen (born 3 April 1960) is a Dutch singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist musician and record producer, best known for his long-running progressive metal/rock opera project Ayreon. Lucassen started his career in 1980 as the guitarist and backing vocalist of Dutch heavy metal band Bodine as Iron Anthony, before joining Vengeance in 1984. After eight years he left the band, wanting to go into a more progressive direction, and released two years later an unsuccessful solo album entitled &quot;Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy&quot; under the nickname Anthony.

In 1995, Lucassen released an album uncredited to any artist called &quot;Ayreon: The Final Experiment&quot;, in which he sang, wrote every song and played most of the instruments. The album led to the creation of Ayreon; despite being relatively unknown at first, the project gained notable attention and praise with the release of its third album, &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot;, establishing Lucassen as a notable composer of rock operas. Following Ayreon&#x27;s success, Lucassen has been involved in many other projects: he is the creator, composer and current guitarist/keyboardist of Star One, Guilt Machine, and The Gentle Storm, and the creator and former guitarist of Ambeon and Stream of Passion. He composes and writes most of his songs, but leaves the lyrics to his musical partners in some of his projects.

Lucassen plays a wide variety of instruments: his main instruments are guitar and keyboards, but he also plays bass, banjo and many others. Overall, in his career and including all his bands and projects (as principal instrumentalist/creative force or as a member), Lucassen has released twenty-six studio albums, four live albums, two EPs and seventeen singles. He has also made many minor participations alongside various artists including Shadow Gallery, After Forever, Within Temptation and Avantasia, and appears in over 50 albums.

Since the creation of Ayreon, Lucassen progressively made a name for himself under rock and metal reviewers, with many critics calling him a &quot;genius&quot;, and praising his composition abilities and originality. In his review of &quot;01011001&quot;, AllMusic reviewer Cosmo Lee stated &quot;Music this over the top almost defies criticism. Reviewing it is like reviewing the world&#x27;s tallest building. It doesn&#x27;t care; it just goes on and on.&quot;

== Career ==

Lucassen&#x27;s love of music was sparked in the &#x27;60s, when he became a big fan of The Beatles. He decided to learn guitar when he heard Ritchie Blackmore playing in &quot;Made in Japan&quot;. One of his first bands was called Mover, which he joined around the age of 18.

=== Bodine (1980–1984) ===

In 1980, Lucassen joined Bodine via their drummer Gerrard Haitsma, who was also the drum teacher of Mover&#x27;s drummer. Under the nickname Iron Anthony, he was featured on their second album, &quot;Bold as Brass&quot; (1982), and their third and final album, &quot;Three Times Running&quot; (1983).

Lucassen later recalled about his years with Bodine: &quot;on one side they were good musicians, extremely good musicians, the best drummer in Holland (Gerard Haitsma), an incredible guitar player and a very steddy [&quot;sic&quot;] bass player (Armand van der Hoff). And I actually learned how to play there, how to play very tight, how to play in tune, you know, to play solo not just fast but to play one note and do it good. But on the other hand, they were kind of boring guys, they were all 10 years older than me, they didn&#x27;t like partying and stuff. And in those days I was young, I was 20, after the girls and after the party, you know. So it was a bit boring. And another problem in that band was that they didn&#x27;t like melody, they were in love with AC/DC and stuff like that. And I always liked melodic music, already in those days I was into prog music. So I didn&#x27;t like to be there, I wrote songs but they were just a little part of me.&quot;

In 1984, Lucassen left Bodine to join Vengeance; they disbanded shortly after.

=== Vengeance (1984–1992) ===

In 1984, the newly created band Vengeance played as supporting act for Bodine. When Lucassen, who had been impressed by their performance, was later contacted by the band to ask if he knew any potential replacement for their guitarist who had just left, he proposed himself and joined the band, leaving Bodine.

Regarding their original self-titled album released in 1984, Lucassen stated in a 2002 interview that the album was &quot;horrible&quot;, adding &quot;The songs were mostly finished when I joined the band. I think I wrote just two songs for that album and it was recorded very cheap, the sound is bad and the songs are not that good. So it&#x27;s not a very strong album although you can already hear the potential&quot;. The band later established themselves as one of the most successful bands of the Netherlands at the time. He also recalled a concert in Germany cancelled at the last moment because &quot;after the first night Vengeance wrecked the hotel, it was like $10,000 damage. We were not allowed to leave Germany, they took our equipment... so that was really sex, drugs and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll!&quot;

In 1989, the band was forced to fire their lead vocalist Leon Goewie, who was, according to Lucassen, &quot;really crazy on stage. The only problem was that he was also crazy offstage. But he also liked to have a stiff drink now and then, if you know what I mean&quot;. Vengeance found little success with their new vocalist Ian Parry, and disbanded in 1992 after a surprisingly successful farewell tour.

While Lucassen pursued his solo career, Vengeance&#x27;s label released &quot;The Last of the Fallen Heroes&quot;, promoted as a new studio album but actually a compilation of unfinished demos, in 1994. Goewie, who was heavily struggling as a musician after being fired from the band, later contacted Lucassen, asking him to write him songs. Lucassen wrote two songs, which were later featured on a new Vengeance album, &quot;Back from Flight 19&quot;, in 1997; despite participating to this new album, Lucassen did not re-join Vengeance. He later stated about &quot;Back from Flight 19&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m not so proud of that album. There&#x27;s a couple of good songs but it&#x27;s definitely not Vengeance.&quot;

=== Solo debuts (1992–1995) ===
After his departure, Lucassen first tried to create a new band, Planet Nine. However, according to his words in &quot;The Final Experiment&quot; book, &quot;nobody even wanted to touch it&quot;. He released his first solo album, &quot;Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy&quot;, under the name &quot;Anthony&quot; in 1994. It was a commercial flop; according to Lucassen, &quot;people didn&#x27;t understand it. It wasn&#x27;t hard rock, it wasn&#x27;t prog or something. People thought, &#x27;What&#x27;s that he is doing now? He must be crazy!

Remembering this period, Lucassen stated &quot;it was the period in my life when my girlfriend broke up with me, Vengeance broke up and I had no more record deal. So it was a horrible time&quot;.

=== Ayreon&#x27;s debut and fame (1995–2000) ===

After his first unsuccessful solo album, Lucassen began recording &quot;The Final Experiment&quot;, which was released in 1995 as &quot;Ayreon: The Final Experiment&quot; on a small Dutch label, Transmission Records, with no artist noted. The album featured a wide array of musical styles, ranging from folk to progressive metal. It was soon followed by Ayreon&#x27;s first single, &quot;Sail Away to Avalon&quot;.

One year later, Lucassen decided to continue the project started with &quot;The Final Experiment&quot;, using Ayreon as the project&#x27;s official name, and released a second album titled &quot;Actual Fantasy&quot;. The album later became the exception in Ayreon&#x27;s discography, as the only Ayreon release that does not feature a single overarching story concept. The single &quot;The Stranger from Within&quot; from this album was also released. It was a relative commercial failure. Lucassen decided to make one more album, and to stop Ayreon if this one did not become a commercial success.

The same year, Lucassen, tired after the complexity of Ayreon, decided to do &quot;something really simple, like punky or heavy versions of 1960s songs&quot; and released &quot;Strange Hobby&quot;, a cover album without artist name or any personnel credited at the idea of the record company to make people curious about the record. According to Lucassen, &quot;it didn&#x27;t work because people knew how it was and they weren&#x27;t so interested, so it was another flop. But I think it&#x27;s good. Maybe the songs are too much alike, too short and after 10 songs you think, &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s it?!&#x27; But I do like that album and I&#x27;m not ashamed that I did it.&quot;

In 1998 the commercially successful and critically acclaimed Ayreon album &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; was released. It is still currently considered one of the best albums in Lucassen&#x27;s career. The good reception to the album made Lucassen decide to continue the project Ayreon.

The next two Ayreon albums, &quot;Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer&quot; and &quot;Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator&quot;, considered as two parts of the same story, were released simultaneously on 20 June 2000. The two sold well and were received positively, despite &quot;Part 1&quot; being considered superior to &quot;Part 2&quot; by most critics. &quot;Temple of the Cat&quot; from &quot;Part 1&quot; was released as a single the same year, and again the following year in an acoustic version.

=== First side projects; Ambeon and Star One (2000–2003) ===

In 2000 Lucassen created Ambeon, his first side project since the creation of Ayreon, to explore a softer style of his music. The band consisted of him as composer and principal instrumentalist and then 14-year-old Astrid van der Veen as singer and lyricist. They released their only album &quot;Fate of a Dreamer&quot; in 2001, along with the single &quot;Cold Metal&quot;. The album had a limited success. Ambeon&#x27;s atmospheric sound draws from a wide variety of influences, including celtic, gothic, progressive music, and dark ambient. The songs on &quot;Fate of a Dreamer&quot; were mostly composed of different remixed pieces of songs from Ayreon albums. The name of the band was a play on the words ambient and Ayreon. The album went out of print shortly after its release and was considered rare, until Lucassen re-released it in December 2011, with the addition of a bonus CD containing previously unreleased tracks. Lucassen was not satisfied with the final result, stating &quot;it&#x27;s a bit cold for me. It&#x27;s too electronic, a bit too much computers... And I didn&#x27;t know how well Astrid could sing for I didn&#x27;t know her and she didn&#x27;t know me&quot;.

Van der Veen retired from music after the release of &quot;Fate of a Dreamer&quot;, leading to Lucassen stating that there&#x27;d most likely be no future Ambeon albums, despite the fact he would have liked it. Van der Veen eventually released a new record for herself in 2012 after a long battle with depression and addiction, but does not seem to intend on performing actively anymore.

In 2002, Lucassen created another side project, named Star One; it is the only side project to date he made more than one studio album with. Star One focused on four singers: Dan Swanö, Russell Allen, Floor Jansen and Damian Wilson; Lucassen played guitar, keyboards and Hammond organ. Their first album, &quot;Space Metal&quot;, was released in 2002. The album also had limited success, although it was more successful than Ambeon. &quot;Live on Earth&quot;, the first live album in Lucassen&#x27;s career which also included Ayreon songs, was released one year later.

=== &quot;The Human Equation&quot; and &quot;01011001&quot;, Stream of Passion (2003–2008) ===

Four years after &quot;Universal Migrator&quot;, Lucassen released Ayreon&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;The Human Equation&quot;. It was a commercial success, going No. 7 in the Dutch album charts, and some critics considered the album as Lucassen&#x27;s best since &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot;.)

Special editions of all Ayreon albums were released in 2004 when Lucassen switched label from Transmission to InsideOut Records; The new edition of &quot;The Final Experiment&quot; featured a bonus disc of newly recorded, semi-acoustic versions of songs from the album, while &quot;Actual Fantasy&quot; was entirely remixed and partially re-recorded, with the new version being titled &quot;Actual Fantasy: Revisited&quot;.

In 2005, Lucassen created Stream of Passion to make a more conventional progressive metal band with symphonic and gothic inspirations. He also wanted to showcase the talents of his friend and Mexican female vocalist Marcela Bovio, who also sang on &quot;The Human Equation&quot; and who had won a contest on Lucassen&#x27;s website.

He recruited second guitarist Lori Linstruth (his future girlfriend), keyboardist Alejandro Millán (Bovio&#x27;s then-boyfriend), bassist Johan van Stratum (Bovio&#x27;s future husband), and drummer Davy Mickers, and started the band. As with Astrid van der Veen for Ambeon, Lucassen was in charge of composing the music, while letting Bovio write the lyrics. They released the album &quot;Embrace the Storm&quot; in 2005. Like Lucassen had done with Star One, Stream of Passion toured and released a live album, &quot;Live in the Real World&quot;, in 2006. Also like Star One, the tour featured many Ayreon songs, as well as songs from the album. He finally left the band in 2007, as he had planned. The band continued successfully without him: They subsequently released three studio albums, &quot;The Flame Within&quot;, &quot;Darker Days&quot; and &quot;A War of Our Own&quot;, before amicably disbanding in 2016.

In 2008, Lucassen released a new Ayreon album, &quot;01011001&quot;, which achieved commercial success, reaching No. 2 in the Dutch album chart.

The album was meant to be the conclusion of the Ayreon storyline, and after its release Lucassen decided to temporarily stop Ayreon, because he was not inspired to continue and also because many critics (despite the album being well reviewed) noted that there was nothing new being offered on &quot;01011001&quot;; he believed that he might make more Ayreon albums in the future, but that they would not follow the same storyline.

=== Ayreon hiatus, focus on other projects (2008–2012) ===

In February 2009 Lucassen announced on his website his new side project: Guilt Machine. The project features a very limited line-up compared to other Lucassen side projects: himself on many instruments and backing vocals, Jasper Steverlinck (Arid) on lead vocals, Chris Maitland (ex-Porcupine Tree) on drums and Lori Linstruth (ex-Stream of Passion) on lead guitar. Their first album &quot;On This Perfect Day&quot;, released the same year, received a very good critical reception but was Lucassen&#x27;s least commercially successful album in many years.

In 2010, Lucassen reunited the six other members of Star One, inactive since 2003, and released the band&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Victims of the Modern Age&quot;. The album received critical acclaim and was a big commercial success. In December 2011 the Ambeon album &quot;Fate of a Dreamer&quot;, like the older Ayreon albums, was re-released with bonus tracks.

At the same time as that the Ambeon album was re-released, Lucassen was already busy composing and recording his next project. On 23 April 2012, Lucassen released &quot;Lost in the New Real&quot;, his first solo album since &quot;Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy&quot; 18 years before. On this album Lucassen sang all lead vocals, wrote all lyrics and played almost all instruments. Also, he asked the Dutch actor Rutger Hauer to provide narration between the tracks. Artwork for this album was done by Claudio Bergamin.

=== Ayreon revival and The Gentle Storm (2012–2017) ===

On 23 August 2012, Lucassen published on his YouTube channel that he started composing &quot;a new project&quot;. On 9 October 2012, he revealed it via YouTube again to be a new Ayreon album, planned for 2013.

Responding to fan comments on his website, Lucassen stated on 12 October that it would probably take a year before the album was completed. He also stated that the album would be the start of a new story apart from the previous Ayreon albums, and confirmed the presence of Ed Warby as usual.

In late 2012, Tobias Sammet announced that Arjen would make some guest lead guitar works in his new Avantasia album, &quot;The Mystery of Time&quot;. This marked the second time both musicians have worked together, the first having been the Ayreon EP &quot;Elected&quot;, on the title song, in which Tobias sang guest vocals.

On 26 March 2013, Lucassen revealed the name of the next Ayreon&#x27;s album, &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;. This album was released on 25 October and received positive reviews.

On 22 April 2014, Lucassen revealed that his new project would be a collaboration with Dutch singer Anneke van Giersbergen, who previously collaborated with him in Ayreon albums &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; and &quot;01011001&quot;. He described it as &quot;an epic double concept album, a combination of &#x27;classical meets metal&#x27; and &#x27;acoustic folk&#x27;.&quot; Lucassen&#x27;s most recurrent collaborator Ed Warby was featured once again on drums, and it was his very first album featuring double bass among the instruments. He confirmed that Johan van Stratum from his former band Stream of Passion would play bass on the album. Also, due to &quot;unforeseen problems&quot;, Warby had to re-record all his drums part in one day, doing that &quot;with time to spare&quot;.

On 2 September 2014, Lucassen revealed that his collaboration with van Giersbergen was actually a new band, called The Gentle Storm. A cover EP entitled &quot;The Gentle Storm Exclusive Tour CD&quot;, and their first album, &quot;The Diary&quot;, were both released in 2015, with van Giersbergen writing all the lyrics and him composing the music. The band toured in 2015, without him; however, he was featured on a few acoustic shows by the band in the Netherlands.

Between 18 and 20 September 2015, a live version of &quot;The Human Equation&quot;, directed by Lucassen&#x27;s former manager Yvette Boertje and featuring most of the original album&#x27;s singers and musicians, took place for four shows. Although he was not involved in the creative process, Lucassen appeared at the end of each show, and acted as producer and mixer for the DVD/live album, entitled &quot;The Theater Equation&quot; and released on 17 June 2016.

On 6 October 2016, Lucassen&#x27;s next project was announced to be a new Ayreon studio album. After revealing the cast one by one during the following months, he revealed its cover art and title, &quot;The Source&quot;, on 19 January 2017. The album was released on 28 April 2017 and was a commercial success, topping the albums charts in the Netherlands at its release.

=== Focus on Ayreon live performances (2017–present) ===

In November 2016, Lucassen announced the first ever official Ayreon concerts for September 2017, entitled &quot;Ayreon Universe&quot;. The show featured 16 singers and 11 instrumentalists, all of which had previously worked together with Lucassen on his studio albums. Unlike &quot;The Theater Equation&quot;, it consisted of unrelated songs from Ayreon performed after each other as in a traditional concert, with a few songs from Star One featured as well. One of the performances was released as a live album/DVD on 30 March 2018, titled &quot;Ayreon Universe – The Best of Ayreon Live&quot;.

On 7 December 2017, Lucassen stated that a new Ayreon concert would take place on 22 June 2018 at Graspop Metal Meeting, where they would headline the Marquee stage. It featured the same instrumentalists as the Ayreon Universe shows and most of its vocalists, along with Simone Simons, Barry Hay and Tom S. Englund, who had never performed live with Ayreon before, and Mark Jansen, who had never collaborated with Lucassen before; Lucassen himself also performed a few songs.

Between 13 and 15 September 2019, the album &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; was performed in Tilburg in its entirety similarly to &quot;The Theater Equation&quot; in 2015, this time as official Ayreon performances. Fish, Anneke van Giersbergen, Damian Wilson, Edward Reekers, Edwin Balogh, and George Oosthoek returned from the original cast, alongside Ed Warby and flutist Thijs van Leer, who also performed on the original album. Simone Simons and Mark Jansen of Epica, Praying Mantis singer John Jaycee Cuijpers, Marcela Bovio, Bovio&#x27;s husband and VUUR bassist Johan van Stratum, and Ex Libris members Dianne van Giersbergen and Bob Wijtsma were also featured, with actor John de Lancie acting as narrator. It was released as the live album &quot;Electric Castle Live and Other Tales&quot; on 27 March 2020.

Ayreon was supposed to headline the Night of the Prog Festival in Germany on 18 July 2020 to perform &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; once again; however, the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 8 May 2020, Lucassen revealed on his YouTube channel that his next album would be an Ayreon album, titled &quot;Transitus&quot; and to be released the same year; the album has been released alongside a tie-in comic book on 25 September 2020.

Beginning 9 February 2021 on his Facebook page, Lucassen began teasing a new Star One album. On 6 October 2021 he revealed that it would be titled &quot;Revel in Time&quot;. The album was released on 18 February 2022 on different formats, followed by re-releases of &quot;Star One&quot; (11 March 2022) and &quot;Victims of the Modern Age&quot; (1 April 2022).

On 19 January 2023, it was announced that Lucassen had formed a new band called Arjen Lucassen&#x27;s Supersonic Revolution. On 19 May 2023, they released the 1970s-influenced album &quot;Golden Age of Music&quot;. Lucassen later collaborated with Simone Simons on her debut solo album, &quot;Vermillion&quot;, which was released on 23 August 2024.

== Personal life ==
Lucassen stated that to him, &quot;Music is everything. Both listening and creating. Even if I wouldn&#x27;t be successful I would be creating music. Music chose me, I didn&#x27;t choose music. I have no choice in the matter whatsoever!&quot;

According to Lucassen, his self-made motto is &quot;the meaning of life is to give life meaning&quot;, a sentence which he included in the Ayreon song &quot;The Sixth Extinction&quot; from &quot;01011001&quot;, and considers himself &quot;a very rational man. I believe in science&quot;.

=== Family and relationships ===

Lucassen has an older brother, Gjalt, who speaks through a megaphone on the song &quot;I&#x27;m The Slime&quot; from his solo album &quot;Lost in the New Real&quot;. Every Lucassen album contains a &quot;Gjalt joke&quot; in its booklet, in which he refers to his brother. This is, at times, done in both a joking and/or mocking fashion, as for years he and Gjalt have had a rocky relationship and haven&#x27;t always gotten along. He was married to Jolanda Verduijn, who appeared as bassist on &quot;The Final Experiment&quot;, until they divorced in 2006/2007.

Lucassen is currently in a relationship with American guitarist and lyricist Lori Linstruth, who left Sweden to move in with him. She is his former bandmate from both Stream of Passion and Guilt Machine, and was featured in several Ayreon albums. Despite retiring as an active performer in 2010, she still acts as his manager, a role she has held since 2007, and is responsible for various other tasks on his albums; she notably co-wrote the story and lyrics of the Ayreon album &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;. According to Lucassen, Linstruth supervises the making of all his works, notably his lyrics as English is her native language, and she is also an English teacher.

=== Health issues ===
During the recordings of &quot;The Human Equation&quot; from 2003 to 2004, Lucassen suffered from &quot;increasing lower back problems&quot;. Doctors gave him an MRI examination, revealing he was suffering from a hernia; he had his examination filmed to use it for a video shoot, &quot;as the &#x27;Me&#x27; character [from &quot;The Human Equation&quot;] would also have needed a scan after his car accident&quot;.

Lucassen has suffered from permanent anosmia since 2007. The same year, he sank into a depression which required medical help, due to the disease, his constant work over the last years, and his recent divorce with Verduijn resulting in him living on his own.

On 3 September 2012, he revealed on his Facebook page that he had been suffering from an incurable tinnitus for the past two months.

<text>Pyramiden (; ; literally &#x27;The Pyramid&#x27;) is an abandoned Soviet coal mining settlement on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard which has become a tourist destination. Founded by Sweden in 1910 and sold to the Soviet Union in 1927, Pyramiden was closed in 1998 and has since remained largely abandoned with most of its infrastructure and buildings still in place, the cold climate preserving much of the infrastructure left behind.

Since 2007, there have been efforts to make it a tourist attraction; the town&#x27;s hotel was renovated and reopened in 2013. In the summer, there is a population of six caretakers.

== History ==
Pyramiden was founded by Sweden in 1910 and sold to the Soviet Union in 1927. It lies at the foot of the Billefjorden on the island of Spitsbergen and is named after the pyramid-shaped mountain with the same name adjacent to the town. The nearest settlements are Svalbard&#x27;s capital, Longyearbyen, some to the south, Barentsburg approximately southwest and the small research community of Ny-Ålesund, to the west. In Soviet times, the population was mostly Ukrainian, consisting of miners from the Donbas and staff from Volyn.

Owned by the state-owned Russian mining company Arktikugol, which also owns the settlement of Barentsburg, Pyramiden once had over 1,000 inhabitants. Among its amenities were a cultural centre with a theater, a library, art and music studios; a sports complex; and a cantina open 24 hours a day. It also had a primary school. The northernmost monument to Vladimir Lenin and the northernmost swimming pool were also found here.

In 1996, a charter flight for Arktikugol crashed on the approach to Svalbard Airport with the loss of 141 lives.

Between 1955 and 1998, as much as nine million tonnes of coal were extracted from the mine. Mining ceased on 31 March 1998 and the settlement closed that same year. The last permanent resident departed on 10 October, leaving Pyramiden as a ghost town.

Until 2007, the former settlement remained uninhabited and largely untouched. The buildings&#x27; interiors remained largely as they were when the settlement was abandoned. In 2012, Aleksandr Romanovsky became the first person to return to live in Pyramiden. He has since been joined by five others. Romanovsky, a musician and tour guide in the settlement, has called himself the &quot;world&#x27;s most northern head-banger&quot;. Romanovsky has lived for years on his own in this abandoned town.

On 27 August 2019, the world&#x27;s northernmost film festival was held in Pyramiden, dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Soviet cinema.

== Preservation ==
Pyramiden is accessible by boat or snowmobile from Longyearbyen, either as part of a guided tour or independently. There is also the Pyramiden Heliport. There are no restrictions on visiting Pyramiden, but visitors are not allowed to enter any buildings without permission even if they are open. While most buildings are now locked, breaking into the buildings, vandalism and theft of artefacts have become a serious threat to Pyramiden as it contributes to the accelerating deterioration of the buildings.

Pyramiden is maintained as a tourist destination by Arctic Travel Company Grumant, a division of Arktikugol. Tours through many buildings are available upon request at the Pyramiden Hotel. The movie theatre has been restored to fully functioning, and movies may now be booked on request. An archive of over 1000 Soviet films is preserved in the storerooms on the site.

Since 2007, Arktikugol has been renovating the hotel and upgrading the infrastructure, including building a new power station with diesel generators, in order to accommodate tourists in the old settlement. Up to 30 workers have been living in the settlement year round to maintain the facilities and guide tourists visiting from Longyearbyen.

, the Pyramiden hotel has been reopened and it is possible to stay overnight in Pyramiden. The hotel also houses the Pyramiden Museum as well as a post office and a souvenir shop. There was a small hotel built of old shipping containers near the harbour, but this has closed since the hotel is now renovated and open for guests. There are no plans to renovate and reopen the whole settlement.

<text>Elwy McMurran Yost, (July 10, 1925 – July 21, 2011) was a Canadian television host, best known for hosting CBC Television&#x27;s weekday &quot;Passport to Adventure&quot; series from 1965 to 1967, TVOntario&#x27;s weekday &quot;Magic Shadows&quot;, from 1974 until the mid-1980s, and &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; from 1974 to 1999.

==Early life==
Born in Weston, Ontario, he was the son of pickle manufacturer Elwy Honderich Yost and Annie Josephine McMurran. In his youth, the senior Yost would give his son a dime a week to go see a movie on condition that he&#x27;d then recount the plot. Yost graduated from the Weston Collegiate and Vocational School in 1943.

He began studies at the University of Toronto in 1943, and studied engineering but left in 1944, after failing his exams, and joined the Canadian Infantry in 1944. He was honorably discharged in September 1945. After graduating from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology in 1948, he worked variously in construction, at the Canadian National Exhibition, made an independent film with a classmate and acted in summerstock theatre. In 1951, he was working in the circulation department of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; where he met his future wife, Lila Melby. In 1952 he acted in a small part in the movie &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. He also worked in the Avro Canada personnel department from 1953 until 1959 when he and most of the staff were laid off due to the cancellation of the Avro Arrow project. He then worked as an English and History teacher at Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute in Etobicoke, Ontario.

==Career in television==
Through his acting connections, Yost learned that CBC was looking for quiz show panelists. Yost auditioned and, through the 1960s, appeared intermittently on the CBC as a panelist on shows such as &quot;Live a Borrowed Life&quot;, &quot;The Superior Sex&quot; and &quot;Flashback&quot;. In the mid-1960s, he created and hosted CBC&#x27;s &quot;Passport to Adventure&quot;, featuring classic movie serials, and also assisted in the founding of the Metropolitan Educational Television Authority (META).

In the late 1960s, he hosted CBC Radio show &quot;It&#x27;s Debatable&quot;.

He joined the Ontario Educational Communications Authority (later &quot;TVOntario&quot;) in the early 1970s as a manager and, in 1974, was assisting with the establishment of its regional councils, when he was told OECA had acquired the broadcast rights to three Ingmar Bergman films and was asked if he had any ideas on how the station could air them in an educational context. Yost packaged the shows as &quot;Three Films in Search of God&quot; adding educational content in the form of interviews, introductions, and discussions, thus creating the model for what became &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;, which became the channel&#x27;s longest-running, and one of its most popular, shows. Yost also developed &quot;Magic Shadows&quot;, which showed classic films in a serial format in half-hour early evening installments with introductions providing background and interesting details by Yost; the movie review show &quot;Rough Cuts&quot;; &quot;Talking Film&quot; and &quot;The Moviemakers.&quot; In 1979 he appeared in &quot;Ida Makes a Movie&quot;, the first of four television shorts that spawned &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street&quot; in 1982 and by extension, the &quot;Degrassi&quot; media franchise.

The format of &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; was that of two movies, separated by in-depth interviews conducted by Yost. In the early years the interviews were with local film experts, but the show&#x27;s producers took the opportunity to interview visiting actors when they had engagements in Toronto. As the show grew in popularity, funds were found to send Yost and a crew to Hollywood to arrange interviews with film personalities. The library includes interviews with the stars of classic films, character actors, directors, screenwriters, composers, film-editors, special-effects people, and sometimes even their children. 

Some regular viewers started to plan their Saturday nights so that they could catch just the interview section if they had already seen that night&#x27;s films. When Yost retired from TVOntario in 1999, a copy of the library of interviews was donated to the Motion Picture Academy. 

His son, Graham Yost, is a screenwriter whose most famous credit was the hit 1994 film &quot;Speed&quot;. &quot;Speed&quot; was the final movie Yost hosted before retiring from &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; in 1999.

Yost wrote four books: &quot;Magic Moments from the Movies&quot;, &quot;Secret of the Lost Empire&quot;, &quot;Billy and the Bubbleship&quot; (also known as &quot;Mad Queen of Mordra&quot;) and &quot;White Shadows&quot; the latter being a mystery novel, published in 2003. 

==Death==
Yost recovered from &quot;a serious operation&quot; he had in 2005, according to his wife, Lila. He died in West Vancouver, British Columbia on July 21, 2011, aged 86.

==Honours==
In 1999, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. In the same year, he was awarded the Clyde Gilmour Award by the Toronto Film Critics Association.

In 2021, TVOntario aired &quot;Magic Shadows, Elwy Yost: A Life in Movies&quot;, a documentary by Karen Shopsowitz about Yost&#x27;s life and influence.

<doc id="1249974" wikidata="Q3637169" url="?curid=1249974" title="Beans (Looney Tunes)">
<text>Beans the Cat is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Cartoons series of cartoons from 1935–1936. Beans was the third &quot;Warner Bros&quot; cartoon character star after Bosko and Buddy. He was voiced by Billy Bletcher (and occasionally by Tommy Bond). He was created by director Friz Freleng. The character was featured in nine cartoons made in 1935 and 1936.

==History==
When the cartoon animators/directors Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising left producer Leon Schlesinger in 1933, they took their main creation, Bosko, with them to Metro-Goldwyn Mayer. Desperate to maintain his contract with Warner Bros., Schlesinger founded an animation studio of his own, Leon Schlesinger Productions, to produce new &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons in-house and collected employees from Disney, Ub Iwerks, and other animation studios. Schlesinger set up his new studio on the Warner Bros. lot, on Sunset Boulevard. Among the staff Schlesinger had accrued was Tom Palmer, a former Disney animator who was appointed director of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;. Schlesinger intended to effectively compete with Disney and Fleischer Studios, and he needed a continuing, star character to compete with Mickey Mouse and Betty Boop. Palmer introduced Buddy to be that character. Like Bosko and Mickey, Buddy had a girlfriend and a pet dog as supporting characters. The Buddy character, however, was not a success and Palmer was fired after completing two short films for Schlesinger. Following the departure of Palmer&#x27;s replacement, Earl Duvall, Schlesinger ran short of directors (composer Bernard B. Brown even receiving credits for directing two &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts) and began to search for new directors to effectively keep the Schlesinger studio afloat. According to animation historian Michael Barrier, all the animated short films produced by the Schlesinger studio under its early directors lacked in cuteness and charm of any kind and were frequently incoherent. The shorts of this period had much smaller production budgets than their main competitor, Disney.

By 1934, Schlesinger had assigned directorial duties on the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series to former Harman-Ising animator Friz Freleng, and the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series to Jack King. Schlesinger tasked the two with creating new characters to replace the sterile Buddy, and the two created a group of anthropomorphic animals to show to Schlesinger, which included Beans, a mischievous cat, Little Kitty, a female cat and Beans&#x27; love interest, twin puppies named Ham and Ex, Oliver Owl, a stubborn, spectacled owl, and Porky, a stuttering pig. Beans and his friends made their first appearances on &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot;, a &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; animated short directed by Freleng. The &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series lacked continuing characters by this point. But the film served as a showcase for the new characters, that were being groomed to replace Buddy as the stars of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series. Schlesinger hoped that some of them would catch on with audiences and become bankable stars, and when the characters became popular with audiences, Buddy was discontinued and Beans became the star of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;.

Beans&#x27; first &quot;crack at stardom&quot; was his first solo &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; film, &quot;A Cartoonist&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;. The film was directed by Jack King, who would go on to direct a total of eight animated shorts featuring Beans before returning to Disney in 1936. Michael Barrier describes Beans under King&#x27;s direction as resembling the Mickey Mouse version of the early 1930s. Their designs were certainly similar, with both characters having a white face and black body. But in characterization Beans was a pint-sized hero, resembling the plucky, boyish, and heroic Mickey featured in &quot;The Klondike Kid&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Mail Pilot&quot; (1933). Beans was voiced by Billy Bletcher and Tommy Bond.

Also in 1935, the studio gained a third full-time director, working in addition to Freleng and King. He was Tex Avery, a former inker for the short-lived Winkler Studio and the Universal Studio Cartoons. Avery had started working as an inker in 1928 and was promoted to an animator by 1930. While at Universal, he used to work under director Bill Nolan. Nolan used to delegate work to Avery, and Avery reportedly was the uncredited de facto director for a couple of films credited to Nolan. Avery had lost his job in Universal in April 1935, and was hired by Schlesinger a few months later. According to a later interview with Avery, Avery had falsely claimed that he was an experienced director when applying for the job: &quot;&#x27;Hey, I&#x27;m a director.&#x27; Hell! I was no more a director than nothing, but with my loud mouth, I talked him [Schlesinger] into it.&quot; Avery&#x27;s production unit received its own building within the studio lot. Avery got exclusive use of four animators for his unit: Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones, Sid Sutherland, and Virgil Ross. The first animated short film produced by this unit was &quot;Gold Diggers of &#x27;49&quot; (1935), the third &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; film starring Beans. Beans was also featured in the film&#x27;s title card, signifying that he was the intended protagonist. The film had a Western setting and cast Beans as a gold miner. Also featured in the film was a redesigned Porky Pig, making his second appearance.

Beans began appearing with characters from the cast of &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot;, most frequently Porky Pig. However, after a number of Porky and Beans outings, it became clear that the character audiences were talking about was Beans&#x27; stuttering sidekick, Porky Pig, and after &quot;Westward Whoa&quot;, Beans was phased out and Porky replaced him as the star of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;.

According to Barrier, Beans made one last appearance in &quot;Shanghaied Shipmates&quot; (1936), a short film directed by Jack King. It was to be the last animated short featuring either Beans or the rest of the cast of &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot;, with the exception of Porky Pig. Barrier suggests that Leon Schlesinger may have been giving Avery a vote of confidence, when deciding to keep only Porky as a continuing character and to drop Beans. Porky had already been the main star in Avery&#x27;s films, while Beans had continued to serve as the main star of King&#x27;s films. After losing use of Beans, Jack King directed only three films starring Porky Pig. By April 1936, King was hired again by the Disney studio. He would go on to serve as a director in films starring Donald Duck.

In 1937 and 1938, Schlesinger&#x27;s studio began creating various potential replacements for Beans, producing characters such as Gabby Goat, Petunia Pig, Daffy Duck and a little white hare. Daffy would become Porky&#x27;s most enduring comic partner, while Gabby and Petunia both disappeared after a few shorts; the white hare would rarely ever appear with Porky again but would, over the course of a few years, evolve into Warner Bros.&#x27;s biggest star, Bugs Bunny.

<doc id="1249978" wikidata="Q378083" url="?curid=1249978" title="Neal Purvis and Robert Wade">
<text>Neal Purvis (born 9 September 1961) and Robert Wade (born 1962) are British screenwriters who co-wrote seven James Bond films, from 1999&#x27;s &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; to 2021&#x27;s &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, as well as other works.

==Early lives==
Purvis&#x27;s father was a photographer, and as a teenager, Purvis was in a film club that focused on 1940s cinema.

Wade was born in Penarth and lived there until he was 11. His mother was an artist, and from an early age he wanted to be a writer and began making home-made films as a teenager.

They met each other while attending the University of Kent, when they were assigned as roommates. They began playing in a band together, which they continued to do for at least 20 years. Purvis left Kent and completed a BA in Film and Photo Arts. Wade graduated from Kent and moved to London where he was later joined by Purvis. They spent six years writing scripts together as well as ghost writing for music videos.

==Films==
Wade and Purvis&#x27; screenplay for &quot;Let Him Have It&quot; (1991) (based on the true story of Derek Bentley, a young man who gets caught up in street gangs in post war London and is later controversially hanged), displayed the writers&#x27; &quot;outrage toward a system hell-bent on vengeance&quot; and was called &quot;first rate, no non-sense&quot;.

Barbara Broccoli, producer of the James Bond films, hired Wade and Purvis to write their first Bond script because she had seen their film &quot;Plunkett &amp; Macleane&quot; (1999) and liked that it was &quot;dark, witty, sexy and inventive&quot;. Purvis described their approach when they joined the Bond franchise as to &quot;come in with ideas, things we&#x27;ve found in science magazines, on the internet, interesting weapons and what&#x27;s happening in technology. Then we find a journey for Bond to go through.&quot; In their Bond collaborations, Wade generally does &quot;all the verbiage at the beginning of the script.&quot; They created a novelisation of their Bond script for &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; in collaboration with Raymond Benson. Wade and Purvis also wrote a script for a Bond spin-off featuring the &quot;Die Another Day&quot; character Jinx (Halle Berry), which was attached to director Stephen Frears, but cancelled by MGM because of budget concerns and &quot;creative differences&quot;.

Their 2003 Bond parody, &quot;Johnny English&quot;, received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, receiving a 33% &quot;rotten&quot; rating at the review site Rotten Tomatoes. However, the film earned $160.5 million in its global box office receipts. A sequel, &quot;Johnny English Reborn&quot;, based upon their characters but written by Hamish McColl, was released in 2011.

Purvis and Wade wrote and produced &quot;Return to Sender&quot; (also known as &quot;Convicted&quot;), which was described as a &quot;gripping tale&quot; of a man &quot;fighting to prevent a miscarriage of justice&quot;. They had originally written the script while doing research for their first film 14 years earlier.

In 2005, they co-authored the bio-pic &quot;Stoned&quot; (also known as &quot;The Wild and Wycked World of Brian Jones&quot;) about the last days of the life of The Rolling Stones co-founder, Brian Jones, which they based on an account from a builder on the farm where Jones died, claiming that Jones&#x27;s death was not accidental as recorded by the coroner. The film was criticised for &quot;fail[ing] to convey what mattered about Jones artistically, what he contributed to music, why we should feel more than pity.&quot;

When Daniel Craig was signed on as the new Bond, Wade described their approach to screenwriting thus: &quot;When you have an actor you play to his strengths ... He&#x27;s got this great toughness to him but not an unthinking toughness. I think that&#x27;s where the films will need to go.&quot; Their first work for Craig as Bond, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and received a 4/4 review from Roger Ebert, who stated that the film &quot;has the answers to all my complaints about the forty-five-year-old James Bond series, and some I hadn&#x27;t even thought of.&quot; However, their followup &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, which was not based on any Ian Fleming work, was criticized because while having &quot;the right ingredients: plenty of car, plane or boat chases ... spooks, vendettas, and turncoats&quot;, it lacked the &quot;magic, and a decent plot.&quot;

Their screenplay for &quot;Skyfall&quot;, which they co-wrote with John Logan, was described by Frank DiGiacomo of &quot;Movieline&quot; as being &quot;very wily&quot; for having Bond experience a mid-life crisis. In 2012, it was announced that &quot;after a tremendous run&quot; with the Bond franchise, Wade and Purvis would not be involved in the 24th Bond film, which would be solo written by Logan. However, on 27 June 2014, it was announced that they were being brought on to polish the screenplay for the next film. In November 2014, it was announced that the BBC has commissioned Wade and Purvis to adapt Len Deighton&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;SS-GB.&quot; It was broadcast on BBC One in five one-hour episodes from 19 February 2017 and 19 March 2017.

On 10 March 2017 it was reported that they were approached to write the script for &quot;No Time to Die&quot;. In July 2017, it was initially reported they would write the script, but in May 2018, EON announced that director Danny Boyle was instead working with his regular collaborator John Hodge on a new script. In September 2018, following Boyle&#x27;s departure from the project, Purvis and Wade were re-hired to write a new script.

==Family life==
Wade and his wife live in West Sussex and have four children.

<doc id="1249988" wikidata="Q1548891" url="?curid=1249988" title="Sheffield Arena">
<text>Sheffield Arena, known for sponsorship purposes as Utilita Arena Sheffield, is a multi-purpose arena located in Sheffield, England. It is situated near Meadowhall and lies between Sheffield city centre and Rotherham town centre.

Opened in 1991, it is used for concerts and sporting events, and is also home to the Sheffield Steelers ice hockey club. Attendance for all events at the venue has totalled around 14 million since its opening. It has a maximum capacity of 13,600.

==History==

Constructed at a cost of £34 million, it was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 30 May 1991 as Sheffield Arena. The first concert took place that evening, Paul Simon playing as part of his &quot;Born at the Right Time&quot; tour. The arena then took on the role of Gymnastics Hall for the 1991 World Student Games which were held in the city and which prompted the investment in, and development of, both the arena and nearby Don Valley Stadium.

Since the venue opened in 1991 the arena has averaged 122 shows a year with over 650,000 customers passing through the doors each year.

The Arena was the location of the infamous Labour Party Sheffield Rally during the 1992 United Kingdom general election which was widely criticised for being prematurely triumphalist.

The arena was renamed Hallam FM Arena in 2002, but returned to its original name from 1 November 2007. On 9 August 2010, Sheffield Arena was officially renamed Motorpoint Arena Sheffield, after the Derby based car sales company invested £1 million to rename the venue. In August 2015 the arena was once again rebranded as Sheffield Arena, however in September 2017 nearby Doncaster Sheffield Airport began sponsoring the arena giving it a rebrand, FlyDSA Arena. In 2021, Utilita Energy took over sponsorship of the arena.

The arena underwent a major renovation installing a new roof, doors, seats, lighting, catering and toilet facilities in July 2013.

In 2013 the arena was ranked as the 18th most popular arena in the world and this was in the year that the building was closed for over 2 months to enable the multi-million pound refurbishment of the venue. More recently, in 2019, Pollstar ranked the arena at 65th worldwide and 7th in the UK as part of their &#x27;Top 200 Arena Venues&#x27;
with 311,125 tickets sold, up 5 places from 70th in 2018.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the car park of the arena was used as a drive-through phlebotomy service operated by Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, the first of its kind in the country. This allowed patients to attend for routine blood tests from within the isolation of their cars, reducing the requirement for patients to attend GPs or hospital clinics. The drive-through phlebotomy service opened on 8 April 2020 for patients with underlying health conditions, and was expanded to become available to all patients in the Sheffield area on 27 April. The drive-through was deemed such a success that it was turned into a permanent service, relocating first to a warehouse next to the Sheffield Parkway before settling into a permanent site next to the Northern General Hospital after the end of the pandemic.

To support the rollout of the local COVID-19 vaccination campaign, the Sheffield NHS Vaccination Centre opened at the arena on 25 January 2021, taking up the space previously occupied by the drive-through phlebotomy clinic before its relocation. The vaccination centre remained open until 26 July, when it was relocated to the former NHS Blood and Transplant building next to the Northern General Hospital to allow the arena to reopen for its usual events.

In April 2020, the interior space of the arena was used as a storage location for 1,800 additional hospital beds which were being delivered to hospitals in Sheffield to support pandemic operations. Photographs of the hospital beds inside the arena later leaked onto social media, and the local NHS trust issued a statement denying rumours that the arena was going to be repurposed as a Nightingale temporary hospital. In August 2020, an ophthalmology clinic was opened inside the arena featuring eye imaging suites, remaining in operation until the arena reopened for normal usage after the pandemic.

Sheffield&#x27;s own Arctic Monkey&#x27;s broke the Arena ticket sales records when they instantly sold out over 13,600 tickets for their date are the arena in November 2013. The previous record of 13,300 was held by fellow Sheffield band Pulp in December 2012.

British-Irish boy-band, One Direction played their last concert, before going on an indefinite hiatus, on 31 October 2015 at the Arena. The arena held from somewhere between 35,000-37,000 people raising over 3 million dollars.

===Comedy===
The arena is a regular venue for some of the world&#x27;s best known Comedians such as Russell Brand, Lee Evans, Jack Whitehall, Eddie Izzard and Peter Kay who in 2011 played the arena for 5 nights running with all shows selling out within hours of going on sale. In June 2018 Michael McInytyre broke the venue&#x27;s record attendance for a seated comedy show when his Big World Tour played the FlyDSA Arena on Saturday 23 June 2018 in front of 12,347 fans

===Sheffield Steelers===

The arena is the home to the city&#x27;s Elite Ice Hockey League team, the Sheffield Steelers, who began to play at the arena in 1991. Whilst the standard capacity for ice hockey at the arena is around 9,300, the Steelers have recorded crowds of over 10,000 in the building with extra seating being installed at the venue. In 2019 the Steelers were the highest ranked team in the UK in terms of attendance and 35th in Europe drawing an average crowd of 6,045 to the arena.

The first ever competitive Sheffield Steelers game at Sheffield Arena took place on Sunday 6 October 1991, when the Steelers were held to a 3–3 draw against Chelmsford Chieftains in front of 300 spectators. However, the first Ice Hockey game played at the Sheffield Arena took place on Thursday 26 September 1991 when Durham Wasps beat a Sheffield Steelers select 7–1 to win the World Leisure Cup. Durham&#x27;s Rick Brebant scored the first goal at 2:18 in front of an estimated crowd of 2,000.

In February 2020 it was announced that the arena had secured planning permission to install a new 22-ton machine to make production of the ice surface more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

===Disney On Ice===
Disney On Ice holds the record for the most performances &amp; customers of any touring show to perform at the Arena. Feld Entertainment has promoted the show every year since the building opened over November/December, as of 2013 there has been 260 performances seen by 1.3 million customers.

===Other events===

The arena was the location for the Labour Party&#x27;s 1992 Sheffield Rally. Attended by over 10,000 party members and the entire shadow cabinet. Held just before that year&#x27;s general election, which Labour was widely expected to win, the event is often seen as a factor in the party&#x27;s defeat. While the event was seen as a success to those within the hall, many commentators, and Labour politicians, viewed it as triumphalist in nature. However, it has also been asserted that the event had negligible impact on the outcome, with a fall in the party&#x27;s support having already occurred.

TV shows such as &quot;The X Factor&quot;, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; visit the arena every year as part of their tours. It hosted the BBC revival of &quot;Gladiators&quot; in 2023 and will host it again on select dates during August 2024; the arena previously hosted the live show during Easter 1995.

The arena has hosted major special high-profile events, including The International Indian Film Academy Awards, which took place on Saturday, 9 June 2007 and was broadcast live around the world. This included a season hosted by the city of Sheffield and nearby Leeds. Also, in 2009, the arena hosted the annual BBC Radio 1Xtra concert and the 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

The arena has hosted major boxing events such as when Joe Calzaghe first won his WBO world title here on 11 October 1997 against former world champion Chris Eubank. On the same bill Sheffield born Naseem Hamed defended his WBO title against Jose Badillo. On 26 November 2005 Ricky Hatton extended his unbeaten record to 40–0, defending his IBF and Ring Magazine Junior Welterweight world titles and winning the WBA belt by 9th-round knockout against Carlos Maussa. Sheffield fighter Clinton Woods also defended his IBF light-heavyweight title against Mexican Julio César González on two occasions, winning on points both times. Kell Brook has had many fights here, his most notable being a fourth-round knockout victory of Vyacheslav Senchenko.

The Great Britain men&#x27;s national basketball team played a test match against Portugal in that arena in preparation for the 2012 Olympics.

As well as being home to the Sheffield Steelers the venue has also hosted other ice hockey events such as the 2019 Super Series between USA and Canada featuring many ex-NHL stars and has acted as a neutral site for the EIHL Challenge Cup final

The arena has hosted many professional wrestling events held by companies including WWE, NXT and 5 Star Wrestling over the years dating as far back as the WWE UK Rampage events in 1992 and 1993

<text>Vom Donaustrande (By the Shores of the Danube, op. 356) is a polka by Johann Strauss II written in 1873. Its themes are drawn from his successful operetta, Der Karneval in Rom which premiered in Vienna&#x27;s Theater an der Wien on 1 March 1873.

The themes from the operetta where the polka presents itself is under Acts 2 and 3. The quick tempo of the polka is the marking of the popular &quot;schnell-polka&quot;, which was another form of polka in quick steps as different from the polka-mazurka and the French polka.

<text>The following is a list of lakes in Oklahoma located entirely (or partially, as in the case of Lake Texoma) in the state. Swimming, fishing, and/or boating are permitted in some of these lakes, but not all.

Oklahoma has more than 200 lakes created by dams. All lakes listed are man-made. Oklahoma&#x27;s only natural lakes are oxbow and playa lakes. Oklahoma has sixty-two oxbow lakes at least 10 acres in size. The largest, near the Red River in McCurtain County, is 272 acres.

Playa lakes are found in saucer-shaped depressions in the high plains region. They are usually intermittent, holding water only after rains. Oklahoma has about 600 playa lakes.

==Lakes and reservoirs by size==


Ranked by surface acres, Lake Eufaula is the 34th largest lake in the United States and Lake Texoma is the 38th largest.

<text>The Lake of the Arbuckles is a reservoir located in southern Oklahoma, southwest of Sulphur in Murray County. The lake covers and is a principal water supply reservoir for the city of Ardmore, some to the southwest. It also supplies water to the cities of Sulphur, Davis, Wynnewood and a large oil refinery near Wynnewood. The lake also provides flood control, fish and wildlife habitat and recreation opportunities.

==Project timeline==
During the early 1950s, a drought seriously depleted then-existing water supplies for the cities and towns in the Arbuckle area. Bureau of Reclamation representatives began meeting in 1956 with local officials about the feasibility of an Arbuckle water project. The proposed project was supported by the Oklahoma Congressional delegation. The Bureau prepared a preliminary development plan in 1961. Public Law 87-594, approved August 24, 1962 (76 Stat. 395) authorized the Arbuckle Project. The final development plan was completed in 1964. A contract to construct Arbuckle Dam was awarded June 9, 1964, and completed June 30, 1966. The project also incorporated certain other infrastructure. These included an aqueduct and pumping system to supply water to area customers, The contract for this construction was awarded August 27, 1965, and the work was completed in 1968. The Bureau turned over the operation and maintenance responsibilities to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District on January 1, 1968.

==Description of dam and lake==
Arbuckle Dam, creating Lake of the Arbuckles, was built by the United States Bureau of Reclamation on Rock Creek. at the confluence of Buckhorn, Guy Sandy, and Rock Creeks. The lake is very scenic, nestled within the Chickasaw National Recreation Area. The dam is constructed of earth fill, with a volume of .Its height is and crest length is .

The total capacity of the lake at elevation is .The conservation capacity is at elevation . The surface area at the maximum elevation is .

==Water delivery systems==
The Arbuckle project included a pumping station downstream from the dam and a pipeline to deliver water to Davis and Wynnewood. The pipeline diameter ranges from to .

==Recreation==
The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation has rated the lake as the best for bass fishing in the state. The lake features 36 miles of shoreline. Fishing is permitted year-round for crappie, catfish, largemouth bass, white bass and bluegill. Facilities include three campgrounds for tents and RVs, picnic areas, public restrooms and boat docks and ramps.

There are of land available for recreational use adjacent to the reservoir. Included within the Chickasaw National Recreation Area managed by the National Park Service, the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation provides wildlife management.

<doc id="1250001" wikidata="Q1272812" url="?curid=1250001" title="Geostationary ring">
<text>In orbital mechanics, the geostationary ring is the region of space around the Earth that includes geostationary orbits and the volume of space which can be reached by uncontrolled objects which begin in geostationary orbits and are subsequently perturbed. Objects in geostationary orbit can be perturbed by anomalies in the gravitational field of the Earth, by the gravitational effects of Sun and Moon, and by solar radiation pressure. 

A precessional motion of the orbital plane is caused by the oblatedness of the Earth (formula_1), and the gravitational effects of Sun and Moon. This motion has a period of about 53 years. The two parameters describing the direction of the orbit plane in space, the right ascension of the ascending node, and the inclination are affected by this precession. The maximum inclination reached during the 53-year cycle is about 15 degrees. Therefore, the definition of the geostationary ring foresees a declination range from -15 degrees to +15 degrees. In addition, solar radiation pressure induces an eccentricity that leads to a variation of the orbit radius by ± 75 kilometers in some cases. This leads to the definition of the geostationary ring as being a segment of space around the geostationary orbit that ranges from 75 km below GEO to 75 km above GEO and from -15 degrees to 15 degrees declination.

The number of objects in the ring is increasing, and is a source of concern that the risk of collision with space debris in this region is particularly high.

<doc id="1250025" wikidata="Q6948660" url="?curid=1250025" title="Mys-Tech">
<text>Mys-Tech is a fictional organisation appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They were depicted as a shadowy Faustian organisation who acted as the main villains in a range of initially successful but short-lived comics launched in the US by Marvel UK in the 1990s. Some of these stories also were published in anthology form in the UK in the Marvel UK comic &quot;Overkill&quot;.

They first appeared in &quot;Warheads&quot; #1 (June 1992) and were created by John Freeman, Nick Vince, Gary Erskine, and John Beeston.

==Fictional origins==
The board of Mys-Tech, a multinational corporation, were originally seven mages who in 987 sold their souls to the demon Mephisto in exchange for immortality. The Mys-Tech board members must provide a steady stream of souls to the demon otherwise they will breach their contract and their own souls will be forfeit. Over the years the board accumulated power and wealth and in the modern age this power and wealth became a business empire.

==Board members==
The seven mages who became the board of Mys-Tech were:
*Algernon Crowe
*Bronwen Gryffn
*Ranulph Haldane
*Eadmund Porlock
*Brendan Rathcoole
*Gudrun Tyburn
*Ormond Wychwood

==Headquarters==
Mys-Tech operated as a respectable business but hidden beneath one of their front organisations, The Museum of Pagan Antiquities at Canary Wharf in London they had constructed a fantastic underground headquarters. These headquarters were used to house the arcane magical technologies the board used to increase their power and keep the supply of souls flowing to Mephisto. Chief amongst these was the Un-Earth, a macabre microcosm of the planet used in a similar fashion to a voodoo doll. The headquarters also housed extensive biotech labs. It was in one of these labs that the genetically engineered assassin named Julius Mullarkey, also known as Killpower, was created by Mys-Tech scientist Dr. Oonagh Mullarkey. The headquarters were also the base for the Warheads, Mys-Tech&#x27;s mercenaries who travel through wormholes collecting sophisticated technology for their masters.

==Enemies==
Mys-Tech featured as villains in many of the titles launched by Marvel UK in their 1990s US expansion. The characters featured in these titles included Dark Angel (previously known as Hell&#x27;s Angel), Death&#x27;s Head, the partners Motormouth and Killpower, and the Knights of Pendragon. The Warheads Kether Troop also later went on to rebel against their masters.

The scarred cyborg Badhand has confronted Mys-Tech forces multiple times. Notably, he has spied on the Warheads, allied himself with Nick Fury and assisted Cable with a theft from Mys-Tech&#x27;s vaults.

Mys-Tech also came up against other Marvel Universe characters such as the X-Men, although they never appeared outside of the Marvel UK imprint.

==Mys-Tech Wars==
In the mini-series &quot;Mys-Tech Wars&quot; (1993), by Dan Abnett and Bryan Hitch, their forces fought most of the Marvel Universe&#x27;s assembled heroes. In the resulting demonic invasion, many of Earth&#x27;s heroes (including a majority of the Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man, Ghost Rider, and Nick Fury) were slaughtered. However, due to the surviving heroes&#x27; efforts, the entire event was erased from history. As such, only a few, such as Doctor Strange, Professor X, and Motormouth, actually remember what had happened.

In a later attempt to destroy all superheroes, the board transform themselves into younger versions. In the same issue, they cause the formation of a psychic being that is the result of their centuries of malice. It is called the &#x27;Anti-Being&#x27;. They try to team up in a bid to dominate all reality but lose the being to the cyborg Death&#x27;s Head.

Finally, they attempted to get out of their contract with Mephisto by sending all of Britain to Hell. The country&#x27;s heroes fought them back at the Battle of London Bridge (later covered up) and took the Museum of Pagan Antiquities, sending the board to Hell instead and leaving the group seemingly gone for good. S.H.I.E.L.D. stepped in to handle the clean-up, keeping MI:13 out of the loop so they could hoard the technology for themselves. 

Years later, various Mys-Tech bases became active again and it was believed the group was returning; it turned out instead to be a hell-warped Killpower leading a second demonic invasion, all an elaborate move by Mephisto to end all his Mys-Tech contracts and return all the energies he had tied up in abandoned bases and weaponry.

<doc id="1250028" wikidata="Q4781650" url="?curid=1250028" title="Appolo Ohanga">
<text>Appolo Ohanga was the first black Kenyan cabinet minister in the Colonial Period.

Born in 1913 at Got Regea in Siaya, Nyanza Province, the late Benaiah Appolo Ohanga was the son of the late Ongewe Okelo
and Alicia Obura.

==Education==
After passing his Common Entrance Examination in 1927 he joined Maseno School in 1928. At Maseno, the late Carey Francis recognized his unique ability and within two years, Mr Ohanga had taken his final exams for Secondary and teacher training education.

He then proceeded to Alliance High School in 1931 for Senior Secondary education and qualified for entrance to University in 1933.

However, he was prevailed upon by Carey Francis to join him in training teachers at Maseno Central School. He, therefore, returned to Maseno as a tutor and consequently taught some of his classmates.

He was a keen musician and an accomplished organist. In 1943, he was elevated to the same rank as graduate teachers in recognition of his outstanding ability. Whilst at Maseno, he got married in 1943 to Truphosa Margaret Okinyo, a school teacher, and they had ten children, Veronica, Victor, Jerusha, Hudson, Mildred, Catherine, Patricia, Christopher, David and Eric.

==Political life==
From 1946 to 1947, he was Secretary to the Language Committee of all Nilotic languages.

In 1947 he was nominated to the Kenya Legislative Council. He became the first African in Kenya to hold
a Cabinet post when he rose to the position of Minister for Community Development and Rehabilitation
in 1954, a post he held until 1957.

He then joined the Civil Service as an Education Officer in the Ministry of Education, and later moved to
the Ministry of Home Affairs where he was in charge of approved schools. During his tenure in the Civil
Service, he was very active in the Trade Union Movement and served as President of the Civil Servants
Union and first President of Central Organization of Trade Unions(COTU).

Upon his retirement from the Civil Service in 1972, he became the Chief Executive of the Kenya Senior Civil Servants Association.

In the course of his career he visited many foreign countries including India, Germany, United States of America and, severally, Great Britain. In his various capacities he traveled extensively all over Kenya and East Africa, and, until his death, he could still recall vividly by name the various personalities he met
in those areas.

He retired from the Senior Civil Servants Association in 1975 and dedicated his time to his family, farming, church and community matters.

In 1986, he was awarded the Order of the Grand Warrior of Kenya by President Daniel Arap Moi.

Ohanga died on January 23, 1992, at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi.

<text>&quot;Let America Be America Again&quot; is a poem written in 1935 by American poet Langston Hughes. It was originally published in the July 1936 issue of &quot;Esquire Magazine&quot;. The poem was republished in the 1937 issue of &quot;Kansas Magazine&quot; and was revised and included in a small collection of Langston Hughes poems entitled &quot;A New Song&quot;, published by the International Workers Order in 1938.

The poem speaks of the American dream that never existed for the lower-class American and the freedom and equality that every immigrant hoped for but never received. In his poem, Hughes represents not only African Americans, but other economically disadvantaged and minority groups as well.

The title of this poem was used by Democratic United States senator John Kerry as a campaign slogan in his 2004 presidential campaign.

&quot;Let America Be America Again: Conversations with Langston Hughes&quot;, edited by Christopher C. De Santis and published by Oxford University Press in 2022, is a collection of speeches and conversational essays by, and interviews with, Langston Hughes.

<text>Tenkiller Ferry Lake, or more simply, Lake Tenkiller, is a reservoir in eastern Oklahoma formed by the damming of the Illinois River. The earth-fill dam was constructed between 1947 and 1952 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers for purposes of flood control, hydroelectric power generation, water supply and recreation. It went into full operation in 1953. The lake and dam were named for the Tenkiller family, prominent Cherokees who owned the land and ferry that were bought for the project. This is the 6th largest lake in Oklahoma, based on water capacity.

==Geography==

The lake covers and has a shoreline of over in the Cookson Hills of the Ozark Mountains of Cherokee and Sequoyah counties, about northeast of the town of Gore and from the intersection of I-40 and the Muskogee Turnpike.

The distance from major cities include: east of Oklahoma City, west of Fort Smith, Arkansas, southeast of Tulsa and from Muskogee.

One of the townships bordering this lake is Paradise Hill, at the far southwestern edge of the lake. It is known for its violent drop-offs, some going from a grown man&#x27;s waist level to over his head. This is the cause of many deaths in the lake.

===Electric power generation===
The hydroelectric power station is remotely controlled from the control center at Fort Gibson Lake. Two generators, each rated for 17 megawatts, provide a total capacity of 34 megawatts (MWe). The facility can handle 40 MWe for a short period of time. However, the amount of power that can actually be generated depends heavily on the lake elevation at any given time.

===Water supply===
Originally, the amount of water delivered by the project was considered incidental, although the quality of water was much higher than that of the Arkansas River (the closest alternative source). Much of this water was expected to be used by the Kerr-McGee Nuclear Fuel Plant. That plant closed in 1975. The cities of Muskogee and Sallisaw are now major consumers.

==Recreation==
Attractions near the lake include scuba diving, camping, hiking, fishing, golfing, water sports, scenic nature, fishing, and hunting. In addition there are of trout fishing along the Illinois River. There are also ten marinas, fourteen parks, 24 boat launching ramps, five floating restaurants, and many islands including Goat Island which is famous for the goats that inhabit it. Scuba divers can even see the ruins of old communities that were flooded by the lake, such as the original town of Cookson. This lake is the venue of several fishing tournaments including the popular Bassmaster series championship.

Other than the goats, many other animals inhabit the area including Canada geese, white tail deer, ducks, monarch butterflies, warblers, otters, mink, beaver, bear, mountain lion, wild hogs, wild turkey and bald eagles.

Tenkiller State Park, Cherokee Landing State Park, and several Corps parks are among the parks bordering the lake.

==Wildlife Management Area==
The Tenkiller Wildlife Management Area consists of on the southwest shoreline of the lake, a mixture of upland and riparian habitat. The upland portion is covered with oak and hickory. The riparian portion contains mostly willow, sycamore, hackberry, elm, ash and birch.

<text>John Darnielle (; born March 16, 1967) is an American musician and novelist best known as the primary, and originally sole, member of the American band The Mountain Goats, for which he is the writer, composer, guitarist, pianist, and vocalist. He has written three novels: &quot;Wolf in White Van&quot; (2014), &quot;Universal Harvester&quot; (2017), and &quot;Devil House&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Born in Bloomington, Indiana, Darnielle grew up in San Luis Obispo and then Claremont, California with an abusive stepfather. The Mountain Goats&#x27; 2005 album &quot;The Sunset Tree&quot; is dedicated to his stepfather and frequently references the dysfunction of his upbringing.

Darnielle often attended professional wrestling matches with his stepfather at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. There, he developed a passion for the sport and local wrestlers like Chavo Guerrero Sr. His childhood love of wrestling would go on to inspire The Mountain Goats&#x27; album &quot;Beat the Champ&quot;.

Darnielle attended Claremont High School, located in the Pomona Valley region of Southern California. For a short time after high school, he lived in Portland, Oregon, where he developed an addiction to intravenous methamphetamine and other hard drugs (as referenced in &quot;We Shall All Be Healed&quot;). Darnielle worked in the psychiatric ward at the Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, California. Darnielle attended Pitzer College from 1991 to 1995, graduating as a double major in Classics and English.

Throughout his college education, he continued to record music. In 1992, Dennis Callaci, a friend of Darnielle&#x27;s and owner of Shrimper Records, released a tape of Darnielle&#x27;s songs called &quot;Taboo VI: The Homecoming&quot;. Around that time, the Mountain Goats were born and began touring with just Darnielle on guitar and a bassist, first Rachel Ware and then Peter Hughes.

==Musical career==

Darnielle is best known for his role in the band The Mountain Goats. Since starting the band in 1991, he has gained a cult following. Despite being dubbed a low fidelity artist, Darnielle has always dubbed his work &quot;bi-fi&quot;, pointing out that recordings such as his couldn&#x27;t be made without modern technology. He is known for his prolific output and literary lyrics. Sasha Frere-Jones, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, referred to him as &quot;America&#x27;s best non-hip-hop lyricist&quot;. In its June 2006 issue, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine named Darnielle one of the &quot;100 Best Living Songwriters&quot;.

Darnielle has several series of songs with similar titles or storylines. A series entitled &quot;Going To...&quot; features small stories about various places and includes songs such as &quot;Going to Cleveland&quot;, &quot;Going to Maryland&quot;, &quot;Going to Georgia&quot;, and &quot;Going to Queens&quot;. This series explores the futility of running away from one&#x27;s problems in stark and cryptic detail. There is no reoccurring main character or strong thematic subject linking these similarly titled tracks, and in a 1997 interview with KJHK-Lawrence, Darnielle has described the series as &quot;real loose, though. it&#x27;s real loose&quot;. His &quot;Alpha&quot; series predates his musical career and began as a collection of poems called &#x27;Songs from Point Alpha Privative&#x27;. It is about a distressed couple&#x27;s marriage and history, with such song titles as &quot;Alpha Incipiens&quot;, &quot;Alphabetizing&quot;, and &quot;Alpha Rats Nest&quot;. The band&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Tallahassee&quot; was exclusively about the couple. &quot;Their broader story&quot;, Darnielle writes, &quot;involved an alcohol-soaked trek from California through Nevada and then bottom-crawling across the country until they wound up in northern Florida&quot;. Unless otherwise specified in the lyrics, the songs are intended to be sung by either member of the couple. There are a number of songs, not all containing the word &#x27;alpha&#x27;, that are generally considered to be part of the series, and are explored in more detail on Kyle Barbour&#x27;s site &#x27;The Annotated Mountain Goats.

Darnielle has stated that all songs written up to and including those on &quot;Tallahassee&quot; are fictional, but that &quot;We Shall All Be Healed&quot;, &quot;The Sunset Tree&quot;, and other more recent works are partially autobiographical.

===Collaborations===
Darnielle is featured on Aesop Rock&#x27;s song &quot;Coffee&quot; (from the hip-hop artist&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;None Shall Pass&quot;) and appears in the corresponding music video. Additionally, Aesop Rock remixed The Mountain Goats&#x27; &quot;Lovecraft in Brooklyn&quot;.

He collaborated with John Vanderslice on lyrics for the 2005 album &quot;Pixel Revolt&quot;, and in 2009, Darnielle released a collaborative recording titled &quot;Moon Colony Bloodbath&quot;, after a shared tour with Vanderslice. They toured under the collective name The Comedians, though their recording is attributed to &quot;The Mountain Goats and John Vanderslice&quot;.

With Franklin Bruno, Darnielle formed The Extra Lens, originally named The Extra Glenns. They have released two albums: 2002&#x27;s &quot;Martial Arts Weekend&quot; and 2010&#x27;s &quot;Undercard.&quot;

In 2008, Darnielle collaborated with Kaki King on a six-track EP entitled &quot;Black Pear Tree&quot;. The project was jointly released under King&#x27;s name, and the Mountain Goats moniker. The Mountain Goats and Kaki King subsequently embarked on a co-headlining tour, billed as the &quot;Last Happy Night of Your Life Tour&quot;, with the EP being sold as a tour-exclusive release throughout.
On September 20, 2010, Darnielle appeared on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; as a guest vocalist in a performance of the song &quot;Digging for Something&quot; with the band Superchunk (whose drummer, Jon Wurster, is also in The Mountain Goats).

Darnielle appeared on Kimya Dawson&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Thunder Thighs&quot;, featured on the song &quot;Walk Like Thunder.&quot;

==Writing==
Darnielle&#x27;s first book, &quot;Black Sabbath: Master of Reality&quot;, was published in April 2008 as part of the 33⅓ series. Unlike other entries in the series, which are non-fiction books that focus on an album&#x27;s production or legacy, Darnielle&#x27;s book on &quot;Master of Reality&quot; was instead a fictional narrative in the form of a novella, centering around a young man held in a psychiatric facility in the mid-1980s who is attempting to retrieve his confiscated Walkman and tape of the album.

Darnielle&#x27;s first novel, titled &quot;Wolf in White Van&quot;, was published on September 16, 2014, and was nominated for the National Book Award for Fiction two days later. His second novel, &quot;Universal Harvester&quot;, was published on February 7, 2017. Darnielle&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Devil House&quot;, was published on January 25, 2022. One year later, it was nominated for an Edgar Award for Best Novel.

From 2004 to 2011 Darnielle created and wrote the webzine &quot;Last Plane To Jakarta&quot;, citing other projects as the reason for its abandonment. He writes the &quot;South Pole Dispatch&quot; feature in &quot;Decibel Magazine&quot; every month. Darnielle also guest edited the poetry section of The Mays, an anthology of the best creative work coming out of Oxford and Cambridge.

Darnielle wrote the introduction to the June 2016 book &quot;The Empty Bottle Chicago: 21+ Years of Music / Friendly / Dancing&quot;, about the eponymous nightclub.

==Podcasting==

In 2012, Darnielle guest starred in John Hodgman&#x27;s podcast &quot;Judge John Hodgman&quot; serving as an expert witness and musical guest.

Since 2017 he has co-hosted the podcast &quot;I Only Listen to The Mountain Goats&quot; with Joseph Fink. Each episode of the podcast explores one Mountain Goats song in great detail.

In August 2022 Darnielle appeared as a guest on Margaret Killjoy&#x27;s podcast &quot;Cool People Who Did Cool Stuff&quot;. Darnielle appeared on the episodes &quot;The Diggers, the Levelers, the Ranters and John Darnielle&quot; part one and two.

In March 2023 John appeared on Conan Neutron&#x27;s Protonic Reversal for a career-spanning interview.

==Acting==
In January 2023, Darnielle made his acting debut in &quot;Rest in Metal&quot;, the fourth episode of Rian Johnson&#x27;s television series &quot;Poker Face&quot;. He portrayed Al, a member of a one-hit-wonder metal band called Doxxxology.

==Personal life==
Darnielle has lived in Grinnell, Iowa; Colo, Iowa; Ames, Iowa; Chicago, Illinois; Portland, Oregon; and Milpitas, California. He currently resides in Durham, North Carolina with his wife Lalitree Darnielle, a botanist and photographer (who was featured playing the banjo in the band&#x27;s 1998 EP &quot;New Asian Cinema&quot;), and sons Roman and Moses.

Darnielle prays regularly and identifies as a Christian. His music often includes religious themes, including &quot;The Life of the World to Come&quot;, on which each song is named after a Bible verse; additionally, his work consistently analyzes meanings and interpretations of the text, often through the characters in his songs. He is a fan of Christian singers Amy Grant and Rich Mullins.

Darnielle is a frequent player of the card game . In August 2023, game publisher Wizards of the Coast announced an upcoming collaborative release in which all the cards were designed by Darnielle.

===Activism===
Darnielle became a vegetarian in 1996 and by 2007 identified as a vegan. In the same year, he performed at a benefit for the animal welfare organization Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen, New York. He performed again at Farm Sanctuary in 2009.

In 2011, Darnielle performed solo in support of Planned Parenthood, at the Stand Up for Women&#x27;s Health Rally in New York City. In an interview with BuzzFeed, Darnielle identified himself as a feminist, and was described as a &quot;frequent Twitter commentator on women&#x27;s issues, social justice, and heavy metal.&quot;

<text>Lee Felsenstein (born April 27, 1945) is an American computer engineer who played a central role in the development of personal computers. He was one of the original members of the Homebrew Computer Club and the designer of the Osborne 1, the first mass-produced portable computer.

Before the Osborne, Felsenstein designed the Intel 8080 based Sol-20 computer from Processor Technology, the PennyWhistle modem, and other early &quot;S-100 bus&quot; era designs. His shared-memory alphanumeric video display design, the Processor Technology VDM-1 video display module board, was widely copied and became the basis for the standard display architecture of personal computers.

Many of his designs were leaders in reducing costs of computer technologies for the purpose of making them available to large markets. His work featured a concern for the social impact of technology and was influenced by the philosophy of Ivan Illich. Felsenstein was the engineer for the Community Memory project, one of the earliest attempts to place networked computer terminals in public places to facilitate social interactions among individuals, in the era before the commercial Internet.

==Life==

Felsenstein graduated from Central High School in Philadelphia as a member of class 219. As a young man, Felsenstein was a New Left radical. From October through December 1964, he was a participant in the Free Speech Movement and was one of 768 arrested in the climactic &quot;Sproul Hall Sit-In&quot; of December 2–3, 1964. He also wrote for the &quot;Berkeley Barb&quot;, one of the leading underground newspapers.

He had entered University of California, Berkeley first in 1963, joined the Co-operative Work-Study Program in Engineering in 1964 and dropped out at the end of 1967, working as a Junior Engineer at the Ampex Corporation from 1968 through 1971, when he re-enrolled at Berkeley. He received a B.S. in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1972.

From 1981–1983, Felsenstein was employed at the Osborne Computer Corporation. At Osborne, he was the designer of the Osborne 1, the first mass-produced portable computer. He then returned to freelance consulting. In 1992, he joined Interval Research Corporation, where he worked until 2000. From then until 2005, he worked for Pemstar Pacific Consultants, an electronics design and contract manufacturing firm, which was subsequently acquired by Benchmark Electronics. Throughout, he acted as an occasional free-lance consulting designer or worked at his own design firm.

Many of his designs were leaders in reducing the costs of computer technologies for the purpose of making them available to large markets. His work featured a concern for the social impact of technology. The Community Memory project, begun as a project of Resource One, Inc. in 1972 and later incorporated in 1977 by Felsenstein with Efrem Lipkin, Ken Colstad, Jude Milhon, and Mark Szpakowski, was one of the earliest attempts to place networked computer terminals in such places as Berkeley supermarkets to attract casual use by persons from all walks of life passing through and facilitate social interactions among non-technical individuals, in the era before the Internet.

Felsenstein was influenced in his philosophy by the works of Ivan Illich, particularly &quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; (Harper and Row, 1973). This book advocated a &quot;convivial&quot; approach to design which allowed users of technologies to learn about the technology by encouraging exploration, tinkering, and modification. Felsenstein had learned about electronics in much the same fashion, and summarized his conclusions in several aphorisms, to wit – &quot;In order to survive in a public-access environment, a computer must grow a computer club around itself.&quot; Others were – &quot;To change the rules, change the tools,&quot; and &quot;If work is to become play, then tools must become toys.&quot;

Felsenstein was one of the original members of the Homebrew Computer Club, which formed in 1975 in response to the appearance of the Altair 8800 computer kit. With a handy yardstick, Felsenstein &quot;moderated&quot; meetings at the SLAC Auditorium. He was less a chair than a keeper of chaos. In this heyday of the development of the first personal computers, Felsenstein designed the Intel 8080 based Sol-20 computer from Processor Technology, the Micro Expander computer, the Pennywhistle modem, and other early &quot;S-100 bus&quot; era designs. These existed in a market space with early generation hobbyist microcomputers from Altair, IMSAI, Morrow Designs, Cromemco, and other vendors. Felsenstein&#x27;s shared-memory alphanumeric video display design, the Processor Technology VDM-1 video display module board, was widely copied and became the basis for the standard display architecture of personal computers.

Felsenstein was named a &quot;Pioneer of the Electronic Frontier&quot; in 1994 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and in 2007, he was given the Editor&#x27;s Choice Award for Creative Excellence by EE Times magazine. In 1998, Felsenstein founded the Free Speech Movement Archives as an online repository of historical information relating to that event, its antecedents and successors.

In 2003, while working with the Jhai Foundation of San Francisco, he designed an open-source telecommunications and computer system for installation in remote villages in the developing world. This system was dubbed &quot;the Pedal-Powered Internet&quot; by &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; due to its reliance on pedal power generation. Installation of the first system in Laos was unsuccessful, but the design has been tested on an Indian reservation in the US and continues in development in India. In 2003, Felsenstein was named a Laureate of The Tech Museum of Innovation (San Jose, California) for this work.

Felsenstein is the Founding Sensei of the Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, California, and was featured on a Fox News segment in late 2009 covering the non-profit facility.

Felsenstein&#x27;s older brother is the evolutionary biologist Joseph Felsenstein, a National Academy of Sciences member whose PHYLIP system was one of the earliest examples of bioinformatics. Early versions of PHYLIP were developed on the Sol-20 and Osborne 1, computers designed by Felsenstein.

On April 16, 2016, Felsenstein was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum, &quot;for his influence on the technical and social environment of the early personal computing era.&quot;

<text>The Bell X-16 was a high altitude aerial reconnaissance jet aircraft designed in the United States in the 1950s. The designation of X-16 was a cover to try to hide the true nature of the aircraft mission from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

==Development==
During the second half of 1953, Fairchild, Bell, and Martin Aircraft conducted high altitude reconnaissance aircraft design studies for the United States Air Force under project MX-2147. All three designs used Pratt &amp; Whitney J57-19 turbojets. The Bell and Martin (B-57D) designs were chosen for further development. The Bell Model 67 design was designated the X-16. A full-scale mock-up was completed and one aircraft was partially completed. It was designed as a high altitude long-range reconnaissance aircraft.

The X-16 design was breaking new ground with its design. Its wing was long with a high (11.9) aspect ratio. The structure was significantly lighter and more flexible than usual for jet aircraft wings. The entire aircraft was made as light as possible to achieve its intended 3,000-mile unrefueled range at .

A total of 28 aircraft were ordered, but none were completed. The first X-16 was about 80 percent complete when the program was cancelled by the Air Force in favor of the Martin RB-57 in 1956. Although no X-16 was ever completed, it made contributions to aircraft design with its lightweight design. It was also a driving force behind the development of the high-altitude versions of the J57 that would later power the Lockheed U-2 and other aircraft.

<doc id="1250055" wikidata="Q1585234" url="?curid=1250055" title="Non-maskable interrupt">
<text>In computing, a non-maskable interrupt (NMI) is a hardware interrupt that standard interrupt-masking techniques in the system cannot ignore. It typically occurs to signal attention for non-recoverable hardware errors. Some NMIs may be masked, but only by using proprietary methods specific to the particular NMI. With regard to SPARC, the non-maskable interrupt (NMI), despite having the highest priority among interrupts, can be prevented from occurring through the use of an interrupt mask.

An NMI is often used when response time is critical or when an interrupt should never be disabled during normal system operation. Such uses include reporting non-recoverable hardware errors, system debugging and profiling, and handling of special cases like system resets.

Modern computer architectures typically use NMIs to handle non-recoverable errors which need immediate attention. Therefore, such interrupts should not be masked in the normal operation of the system. These errors include non-recoverable internal system chipset errors, corruption in system memory such as parity and ECC errors, and data corruption detected on system and peripheral buses.

On some systems, a computer user can trigger an NMI through hardware and software debugging interfaces and system reset buttons.

Programmers typically use debugging NMIs to diagnose and fix faulty code. In such cases, an NMI can execute an interrupt handler that transfers control to a special monitor program. From this program, a developer can inspect the machine&#x27;s memory and examine the internal state of the program at the instant of its interruption. This also allows the debugging or diagnosing of computers which appear hung.

== History ==
In older architectures, NMIs were used for interrupts which were typically never disabled because of the required response time. They were hidden signals. Examples include the floppy disk controller on the Amstrad PCW, the 8087 coprocessor on the x86 when used in the IBM PC or its compatibles (even though Intel recommended connecting it to a normal interrupt), and the Low Battery signal on the HP 95LX.

In the original IBM PC, an NMI was triggered if a parity error was detected in system memory, or reported by an external device. In either case, the PC would display an error message and halt. Some later IBM-compatibles used an NMI to conceal the hardware differences from that of the original IBM PC. On such computers, an NMI would be generated when a program attempted to access incompatible hardware. A BIOS interrupt handler would then translate the program&#x27;s request to match the hardware that was actually present. The SMM in the 386SL is a better way to do this.

Some 8-bit home computers used the NMI line to permit a &quot;warm start&quot; if the system had locked up. Typically, this would restore the control registers to known good values stored in ROM, without destroying whatever data that the user might currently have loaded. On the Commodore 8-bit machines, the key was hooked up directly or indirectly to the NMI line on the 6502-series CPU, but the reset would take place only if the NMI handler routine in ROM detected that was also being held down when was struck (this combination being the Commodore version of a three finger salute). Commodore also connected the MOS Technology 6526 CIA #2 in the C64 and C128 to the processor&#x27;s NMI line, which was part of the means by which software emulation of the 6551 ACIA was accomplished. Atari&#x27;s 8-bit line used a button for this same purpose.

Debugging NMIs have appeared in a number of forms, including the Apple Macintosh&#x27;s &quot;programmers&#x27; button&quot;, and certain key combinations on Sun workstations. With the introduction of Windows 2000, Microsoft allowed the use of an NMI to cause a system to either break into a debugger, or dump the contents of memory to disk and reboot.

Debugging NMIs have also been used by devices that allow leisure users and gamers to manipulate running programs. Devices which added a button to generate an NMI, such as Romantic Robot&#x27;s Multiface, were a popular accessory for 1980s 8-bit and 16-bit home computers. These peripherals had a small amount of ROM and an NMI button. Pressing the button transferred control to the software in the peripheral&#x27;s ROM, allowing the suspended program to be saved to disk (very useful for tape-based games with no disk support, but also for saving games in progress), screenshots to be saved or printed, or values in memory to be manipulated—a cheating technique to acquire extra lives, for example.

Not all computers provide a mechanism for triggering NMIs; however, many machines (typically rackmount servers) provide a physical button specifically for this purpose. Other machines may expose this functionality via an expansion card.

Miles Gordon Technology&#x27;s DISCiPLE and +D products for the ZX Spectrum featured an NMI-producing &quot;magic button&quot;.

On the Nintendo Entertainment System, an NMI is generated during each vertical blanking interval. Because these NMIs (often referred to as &quot;vblank interrupts&quot;) occur at frequent, regular intervals, code that manipulates game graphics and audio is often executed inside of the NMI handler routine. Clearing the 7th bit of the PPU&#x27;s register disables vblank interrupts, and setting it enables them.

<doc id="1250057" wikidata="Q3611847" url="?curid=1250057" title="Alistair Taylor">
<text>James Alistair Taylor (21 June 1935 – 9 June 2004) was an English personal assistant of Brian Epstein, the manager of the Beatles. As an employee at Epstein&#x27;s company NEMS, Taylor accompanied him when he first saw the Beatles perform, at the Cavern Club in Liverpool on 9 November 1961. Taylor subsequently worked as the group&#x27;s so-called &quot;Mr. Fixit&quot;, devising escape routes from crazed fans and assisting the band members in purchasing property. He later became general manager of Apple Corps but was fired soon after Allen Klein arrived to address the company&#x27;s financial problems. Taylor published various memoirs of his years in the Beatles&#x27; employ, including &quot;Yesterday: The Beatles Remembered&quot; and &quot;With the Beatles&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born on Curzon Street, Runcorn, Cheshire, Taylor served his time in the Royal Air Force before working in a series of jobs as a mover, timber importer, and docker in the Liverpool Docks. He was then successfully interviewed by Brian Epstein for a job as a salesman at North End Music Stores (NEMS) in 1960. Epstein liked Taylor so much that he decided to offer him a job as his personal assistant in the shop.

===Alleged role in Epstein&#x27;s discovery of the Beatles===
Epstein stated in his 1964 autobiography, &quot;A Cellarful of Noise&quot;, that he first heard about the Beatles through a customer named Raymond Jones enquiring about &quot;My Bonnie&quot;, a single by Tony Sheridan with backing by the group. Taylor later claimed to have invented the name of Raymond Jones and placed an order for &quot;My Bonnie&quot; at the main NEMS shop. As he wrote in &quot;The Beatles Book&quot; (1997), Taylor thought NEMS was losing sales by not stocking the disc:

The truth is that we were being asked for &quot;My Bonnie&quot; but no one actually ordered it. Brian would order any record once we had a firm order for it. I thought that we were losing sales and I wrote an order in the book under the name &quot;Raymond Jones&quot; and, from that moment the legend grew.

Taylor&#x27;s claim that Jones was his pseudonym has since been undermined by author Spencer Leigh, who located an actual person named Raymond Jones when writing an article for &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine. In his book &quot;The Best of Fellas&quot;, Leigh expanded on the story, writing that NEMS and Epstein had communicated with Jones to acknowledge their debt once the Beatles became famous. Beatles biographer Mark Lewisohn has since offered his opinion that the information given by Jones to Leigh is &quot;verifiably correct&quot;.

===The Cavern===
Taylor accompanied Epstein to the Cavern Club when the latter first saw the Beatles play, at a Thursday lunchtime performance on 9 November 1961. Recalling the moment in a later interview, Taylor described them as &quot;these four horrible young men on stage, dressed in black leather trousers, black jackets, smoking, drinking and making noise …&quot;; he also found them &quot;charismatic and exciting&quot; and &quot;sensational&quot;.

As Epstein&#x27;s personal assistant, Taylor witnessed crucial moments in the Beatles&#x27; career and was present at the signing of the first contract with Epstein (which Taylor signed as &quot;In the presence of:&quot;). In 1962, Taylor worked for Pye Records for 15 months, and moved to London (before the Beatles) due to his wife&#x27;s asthma.

===&quot;Mr. Fixit&quot;===
In 1963 Taylor returned to NEMS to work as general manager, receiving a salary of £1,550 per annum. He later said that as the Beatles began to achieve widespread popularity that year, the consensus among the group and their management was: &quot;If we can last three years, it would be marvellous.&quot;

The Beatles named him &quot;Mr. Fixit&quot; for his ability to find solutions to their needs. His duties varied from simple tasks – such as buying the band members their cigarettes and hiring limousines – to devising their methods of escape from fans after live performances and organising their holiday trips. He was responsible for resolving the copyright issues surrounding the group&#x27;s use of celebrity photographs on Peter Blake&#x27;s cover for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

Taylor also assisted the Beatles with property matters. He acted as consultant to John Lennon on the purchase of Dorinish Island (Ireland) for £1,550, and served as the middle-man when Paul McCartney bought High Park, his Scottish farm, in 1966. In July the following year, Taylor arranged the money exchange for the band&#x27;s attempted purchase of the Greek island of Leslo, where, despite Greece&#x27;s recent military coup, they planned to live communally with their families, close friends and assistants. In author Peter Doggett&#x27;s description: &quot;Alistair Taylor was sent to the Mediterranean like a colonial governor seeking a winter retreat for a monarch.&quot;

When George Harrison and Pattie Boyd were house-hunting in 1969, the couple sought anonymity by having Taylor act as Boyd&#x27;s respectable husband while Harrison adopted the role of chauffeur. On one inspection, author Alan Clayson writes, their unconvincing role play led to the owner &quot;turn[ing] to Pattie to ask whether Mr Harrison wanted to see the house as well&quot;.

===Inside Apple===

According to Taylor, following Epstein&#x27;s death from a drug overdose in August 1967, NEMS was plagued by &quot;dreadful in-fighting&quot;, as &quot;everybody – Vic Lewis, Robert Stigwood – struggled to take control of The Beatles&quot;. In December 1967, Taylor and his fellow NEMS employees Peter Brown and Terry Doran left the company to work directly for the Beatles. At Lennon&#x27;s invitation, he became general manager of the band&#x27;s business empire, Apple Corps. An early success for Apple Records was the Welsh folk singer Mary Hopkin, whom Taylor tracked down (at McCartney&#x27;s suggestion) after she had appeared on the amateur talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;.

In April 1968, Taylor appeared in a print advertisement to promote Apple and attract new artists to its nascent record label and publishing company. Designed by McCartney, the picture showed Taylor disguised as a one-man band. The heading read, &quot;This man has talent …&quot;; text below it claimed: &quot;This man now owns a Bentley!&quot; The disguise was rented in Soho, and Taylor was singing &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling&quot; when the shot was taken. The ad resulted in an avalanche of tapes and other submissions after its publication in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In her 2009 autobiography, Apple employee Chris O&#x27;Dell writes of Taylor&#x27;s role in the company: &quot;Alistair was here, there and everywhere at Apple, arranging this and that and always involved, it seemed, in fixing one problem or another.&quot;

That November, with the release of the band&#x27;s double album &quot;The Beatles&quot;, his spoken voice appeared on Lennon&#x27;s experimental track &quot;Revolution 9&quot;. In what author Ian MacDonald describes as &quot;a whimsical control-room exchange&quot;, Taylor can be heard apologising to George Martin, the Beatles&#x27; producer, asking forgiveness for not bringing him a bottle of claret. The previous year, Taylor and McCartney&#x27;s random experimentation with musical notes and word association had led to McCartney writing the song &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;. According to Taylor, however, his friendship with McCartney suffered when the latter began a relationship with Linda Eastman. Taylor considered Eastman a &quot;hard-faced star-chaser from the United States&quot;, eager to separate McCartney from any friends who had been close to his former fiancée, Jane Asher.

 In Taylor&#x27;s recollection, he called the four Beatles together in August 1968 and &quot;told them to bring in a really good businessman&quot; to address Apple&#x27;s problems. Taylor later said of the excesses that brought about Apple&#x27;s immediate financial difficulties: &quot;[The Beatles] were handing money out to people like it was going out of fashion. People were being given cars and houses … it just got out of control.&quot;
The businessman hired to resolve the issues at Apple was New York accountant Allen Klein. Soon after Klein officially became manager of Apple Corps, in May 1969, Taylor was sacked from the company. O&#x27;Dell writes that although the &quot;warning signs&quot; were there, suggesting an unwelcome change at Apple, she was &quot;shocked&quot; at Klein&#x27;s firing of Taylor, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;beloved employee and friend&quot;. In his memoir &quot;With the Beatles&quot;, Taylor says of Klein: &quot;He had all the charm of a broken lavatory seat.&quot;

More troubling to Taylor than his dismissal, the Beatles refused to accept his phone calls. Taylor said: &quot;The next time I spoke to Paul was 20 years later.&quot;

===After the Beatles===
Taylor was recruited by Dick James after leaving Apple to work with Elton John, then an emerging artist. Taylor promoted the singer&#x27;s first two albums. He moved into record producing for a short time but, along with his wife, Lesley, whom he had married in 1959, he felt it was time for a change. In 1973 the couple moved to Darley Dale in Derbyshire and bought a 200-year-old cottage. It was their home for the next 30-plus years.

The couple ran a tea-room in nearby Lea, and Taylor later worked in a factory and in a hotel before his retirement. He enjoyed participating in Beatles fan conventions around the world and he regularly appeared on radio both in the UK and the US.

In the mid-1990s, Taylor created Mellor Beach Leisure Ltd. Taylor served as the &quot;business development director&quot;, promoting a new musical act called Smoke. The company folded after the band broke up. In 1998, he appeared in a documentary that was part of the British TV series &quot;Arena&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Brian Epstein Story: The Sun Will Shine Tomorrow: Part 1&quot;. Also appeared in the 2003 documentary &quot;Inside John Lennon&quot;. Tapes from a 1996 interview were used in a BBC documentary &quot;I Was There When the Beatles Played the Cavern&quot; in 2011.

Taylor died in his sleep on 9 June 2004 in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, after a short bronchial illness. His wife, Lesley, died of cancer in October 2004.

<text>The Worst Week of My Life is a British television sitcom, first broadcast on BBC One between March and April 2004. A second series was aired between November and December 2005 and a three-part Christmas special, &quot;The Worst Christmas of My Life&quot; was shown during December 2006. It was written by Mark Bussell and Justin Sbresni.

==Plotline==

===Series one===
Essentially a comedy of errors, &quot;The Worst Week of My Life&quot; follows the premise that &quot;anything that can go wrong, will go wrong&quot;. The story covers the week preceding the marriage of publishing executive Howard Steel and his fiancée Mel, the daughter of a high-court judge, Dick Cook. Humiliating situations ensue: Cassie, a colleague with whom Howard had a drunken one-night stand two years earlier, sets out to snare him and becomes obsessive; Howard accidentally kills his in-laws&#x27; dog, puts Mel&#x27;s granny in hospital and loses the wedding ring (a family heirloom). At the end of the first series, Howard and Mel were wed, despite the many mishaps that had befallen the well-meaning but accident-prone groom.

===Series two===
The second series takes place in the week leading up to the birth of Howard and Mel&#x27;s first baby, with Howard still a walking accident zone. With his father blowing up granny&#x27;s cottage, into which the married couple were preparing to move, they stay with his wife&#x27;s parents once again. During the course of the week, he is accused of sexual harassment at work, and mistakenly arrested for &#x27;dogging&#x27;. He also manages to toast his father-in-law&#x27;s CBE on a barbecue. Despite Howard knocking out the midwife, the series ends with the birth of a baby girl, Emily.

===&quot;The Worst Christmas of My Life&quot;===
A three-part Christmas special entitled &quot;The Worst Christmas of My Life&quot; was shown on BBC One in December 2006.

====Episode One====
: &quot;Set: 23 December: (aired 19 December 2006)&quot;
After his office Christmas party, Howard takes his intoxicated boss Nicola in a cab to her home, after realising she&#x27;s not fit to drive. During the cab ride, she vomits on him and, after taking a shower at her place, he is forced outside naked by Nicola, after she mistakes his nakedness for preparation to rape her. Howard turns up naked on his in-laws&#x27; doorstep, and proceeds to urinate on the Christmas goose after the power goes out, leading to a series of events which culminate in his falsely claiming to his wife and mother-in-law that his father-in-law is dead. Later, he crashes into his father-in-law, drags his unconscious body inside, causes his mother-in-law to faint, makes his wife suspicious about his naked escapade the previous night when Nicola apologises and returns his clothes, and finally destroys his wife&#x27;s childhood dollhouse, which was to be a gift to their newborn daughter, while attempting to fix the damaged fuse that led to him urinating on the goose initially.

====Episode Two====
: &quot;Set: 24 December: (aired 21 December 2006)&quot;
With Dick continuing to receive wreaths and read obituaries following his &quot;death&quot;, his contempt for Howard deepens further when he discovers Howard bought a new car with the money he was expecting to receive from the will. A freak accident involving a strimmer leads to family friend Felicity&#x27;s pedigree dog, who is regularly put out to stud, losing a testicle, with Howard once more taking the blame. He then takes baby Emily Christmas shopping in the local shopping centre, where he gets in a fight with a drunken Father Christmas and accidentally ends up pushing around the wrong pushchair. He eventually manages to swap the prams back and return the baby to its black parents and reclaim Emily, but Howard&#x27;s despair is not over yet as he spills mulled wine over the local Vicar when he visits the house. Howard&#x27;s visit to church on Christmas Eve sees him get in argument with Fraser over his refusal to publish his memoirs and another fight – this time with Eve&#x27;s new love, Mitch, who Howard saw kissing another woman at the office Christmas party.

====Episode Three====
: &quot;Set: 25 December: (aired 22 December 2006)&quot;

Howard receives a visit from police on Christmas morning following his fight with Mitch, while Eve is attempting suicide in the house and Fraser is accusing him of stealing his bagpipes. Meanwhile, Howard offers to help Dick repair the dollhouse but quickly the pair are glued together as their visitors, the Bledlow family (including Mel&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, Ed), call in for Christmas lunch. With Howard fretting about a missing condom of his that the family dog took from his room earlier, he spots it and leaves the meal to try and reclaim it. But he ends up setting fire to the front room, damaging the presents that were to be opened after lunch.

==Main characters==

*Ben Miller as Howard Steel, the hapless male lead. A book publisher by trade, Howard continually puts himself in dreadful situations and makes things worse by trying to either put things right or explain what had happened.
*Sarah Alexander as Mel Cook, Howard&#x27;s fiancée and then wife, who remains in love with him despite his mishaps. However, Mel (who works as a vet) gradually loses patience with him as the story arc in each series progresses.
*Alison Steadman as Angela Cook, Mel&#x27;s mother. Her main role in life appears to be to entertain guests at her country home, regularly worrying about the impression that will be set following Howard-led problems. Regardless of Howards&#x27;s faults, Angela often tries to see the good in him and is friendlier to Howard than Dick. Whereas Dick doesn&#x27;t understand why Mel loves Howard, Angela can see that the pair love each other and in the series one finale, Angela defends Howard after Dick refuses to give him the car keys to rescue Mel.
*Geoffrey Whitehead as Dick Cook, a High Court judge and Mel&#x27;s father. He has little time for Howard and struggles to understand why Mel wanted to marry him.
*Janine Duvitski as Eve, Howard&#x27;s assistant. She devotes much of her life to her work and has little social life outside helping Howard.
*Ronald Pickup as Fraser Cook, Dick&#x27;s brother. Obsessed by his days in the army, Fraser will regularly offer rather pointless advice about life. He is initially a closet homosexual but finally comes out in Series 2 while in a relationship with his &quot;travelling companion&quot; Gerard (Terrence Hardiman).

===Minor characters===
*Raquel Cassidy as Cassie Turner, Howard&#x27;s stalking co-worker who he had a one-night stand with (series 1). She is unable to accept he wants to marry Mel and goes to any length possible to try and marry him instead.
*Emma Pierson as Sophie Cook, Mel&#x27;s troublesome younger sister (series 1). She asks Howard for relationship advice and then strongly criticises him when things do not work out. She is not in series 2 with no explanation as to her absence, however in The Worst Christmas of My Life (third series) it is revealed that she has moved to New Zealand when Howard talks to her over the phone.
*Dean Lennox Kelly as Dom, Howard and Eve&#x27;s misogynistic co-worker and Howard&#x27;s eventual best man. He develops a relationship with Mel&#x27;s younger sister, Sophie in series one. At the end of series one Sophie announces to her parents that she and Dom are going to marry, to her parents&#x27; dismay. He does not appear in series two and similarly to Sophie, there is no explanation to his absence, but he is mentioned when Eve gives Howard his office desk items that he left.
*John Benfield as Ron Steel, Howard&#x27;s laddish father. He has a lap dancer girlfriend, Trish, played by Lizzie Roper (series 1).
*Kim Wall as Mitch, Eve&#x27;s new boyfriend (series 3). Eve quickly announces her plans to marry him but Howard feels compelled to tell her he saw him kissing another woman at the office Christmas party. Howard and Mitch end up fighting with nativity figures at Midnight Mass.
*Paul Brooke as the Vicar, who finds Howard hard work when preparing to carry out his wedding (series 1). After Emily is born, Angela and Dick are keen for her christening to be held at Winchester Cathedral and believe setting a good impression to the Vicar (a personal friend to the Bishop) when he calls on Christmas Eve (series 3) will seal their wishes. But Howard spills mulled wine over the Vicar, who has to be undressed to receive treatment.
*Terrence Hardiman as Gerard, Fraser&#x27;s lover (series 2). Howard first meets him in the bath with Fraser. He leaves mid-way through the week in an effort to make Frazer tell the family about his homosexuality. He later returns for the last episode.
*Lizzie Roper as Trish, Ron Steel&#x27;s lap dancer girlfriend (series 1). In series 2 it is revealed that she left Ron for his carpet fitter.

<doc id="1250078" wikidata="Q1048501" url="?curid=1250078" title="Cf.">
<text>The abbreviation cf. (short for either Latin or , both meaning &#x27;compare&#x27;) is used in writing to refer the reader to other material to make a comparison with the topic being discussed. Style guides recommend that &quot;cf.&quot; be used only to suggest a comparison, and the words &quot;see&quot; or &quot;&quot; be used generally to point to a source of information. In Italian, the abbreviation &quot;cfr.&quot; (&quot;confronta&quot;, &#x27;confront&#x27;) is more common than &quot;cf.&quot;.

==Biological use==

In biological naming conventions, cf. is commonly placed between the genus name and the species name to describe a specimen that is hard to identify because of practical difficulties, such as poor preservation. For example, &quot; cf. &quot; indicates that the specimen is in the genus &quot;Barbus&quot; and believed to be , but the actual species-level identification cannot be certain.

Cf. can also be used to express a possible identity, or at least a significant resemblance, such as between a newly observed specimen and a known species or taxon. Such a usage might suggest a specimen&#x27;s membership of the same genus or possibly of a shared higher taxon. For example, in the note &quot;, cf. &quot;, the author is confident of the order and family (Diptera: Tabanidae) but can only suggest the genus (&quot;Tabanus&quot;) and has no information favouring a particular species.

==Numismatic use==
Among numismatists (coin collector-research specialists), cf. may be used in references on the paper and/or online coin identification information meaning &quot;compare to&quot;. It is common for abbreviations of listings in trusted coin catalogues or sales from certain online auctions to be cited when identifying a particular coin. If the specimen in question is not an exact match but comes close to a known source, cf. may be used.

<text>The Langenberg transmission tower (also translated as &quot;Sender Langenberg&quot; or &quot;Transmission Facility Langenberg&quot;) is a broadcasting station for analog FM Radio and Digital-TV (DVB-T2 HD) signals. It is located in Langenberg, Velbert, Germany and owned and operated by Westdeutscher Rundfunk, WDR.

The history of the transmitting site is very changing. The transmitter first went into service in 1927 with 60 kilowatts (kW) of power and a T-aerial hanging on two 100-metre freestanding steel-frame towers insulated against ground.

==History ==
In 1926 the „Westdeutschen Funkstunde“ and an association of locals agreed to build the transmitter tower in Langenberg. On Januar 15. 1927 the transmitter was inaugurated.

In the early 1930s, communist underground groups tried to manipulate the line from the studio to the transmitter in order to broadcast their own propaganda. Their attempts failed, but they did manage to attach a red star to the top of one of the towers, which was removed on the same day.

In 1934 the T-aerial was replaced by an aerial hanging from a 160-metre wood framework tower and the transmission power was increased to 100 kW. However, this tower was destroyed on October 10, 1935 by a tornado. After this a triangular aerial hung on three 45-metre freestanding towers was built; this went into service in December 1935. In 1940/41 a second aerial was installed on a 240-metre insulated guyed steel tube mast. The entire aerial system was destroyed by SS-Postschutz troops on April 12, 1945.

===Post-1945===
After World War II, British forces built two triangular aerials mounted on 6 masts, each 50 metres high. One of these aerials was removed in 1948 and a insulated radio mast built on its site. The other aerial was destroyed in a storm in 1949 which broke two of the three masts. The third mast was transformed into an AM transmitter and was in service until 1957. In 1949 a second radio mast with a height of 120 metres was built, and in 1952 a third guyed mast followed with a height of 210 metres for FM and TV. The 120-metre mast was used as an AM transmitter and was insulated against ground, while the 210-metre mast, used eventually for TV and FM broadcasts, was grounded.

===The 1960s===
In the middle of the 1960s the transmission power of the AM transmitter was enormously increased and its frequency was changed to the almost clear frequency of 1586 kHz which allowed night-time reception, even in the USA. This 120-metre radio mast was reduced to 95 metres and it was equipped with two separation insulators.

===The 1970s===
In course of the workout of the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975, the facility lost the exclusive frequency of 1586 kHz and the transmitter was retuned to 1593 kHz. Because this frequency is used by other broadcasters, interference problems occurred at night-time in spite of the 800 kW transmitting power. As compensation, station owner WDR was allotted a second medium wave frequency of 720 kHz for daytime transmission only.

===The 1980s===
Between 1988 and 1990, the 95-metre mediumwave mast and the 210-metre TV- and FM-mast were replaced by a guyed steel-framework grounded radio mast with a cage aerial for mediumwave in its lower sections.

===The 1990s===
In 1993, the 1593 kHz mediumwave transmitter was shut down because some components had been manufactured with PCBs. 720 kHz remained in service, but it was not allowed to use this frequency for night transmission until new regulations were enacted in 1995.

At these point there were two radio masts in Langenberg: the 160-metre radio mast for medium wave and the 301-metre radio mast for MW, FM and TV. The shorter mast had to be renovated in 1996; unfortunately, one auxiliary rope tore during this work and the mast collapsed on September 2, 1996.

In 1995 the transmission power had to be reduced for ecological reasons. Until the early 1990s the whole radiated power in the AM range was 1000 kW (800 kW on 1593 kHz and 200 kW on 720 kHz), but after 1995 the transmitter was restricted to 85 kW. After the collapse of the 160 metre mast, radiation power of the AM transmitter was reduced to 20 kW.

Soon after the collapse of the 160 metre mast, WDR planned a new mast in the form of a guyed grounded steel framework with a height of 170 metres and a cage aerial. The medium wave frequency of 1593 kHz was given to Radio Free Europe. The 720 kHz transmitter was fitted with a directional antenna that minimized propagation of signals westward. Construction of the new mast started in the middle of 1999, but problems delayed its inauguration until July 2000. After the inauguration of the new 170-metre radio mast, transmitter power on medium wave could be once again increased to 85 kW.

<text>A blood culture is a medical laboratory test used to detect bacteria or fungi in a person&#x27;s blood. Under normal conditions, the blood does not contain microorganisms: their presence can indicate a bloodstream infection such as bacteremia or fungemia, which in severe cases may result in sepsis. By culturing the blood, microbes can be identified and tested for resistance to antimicrobial drugs, which allows clinicians to provide an effective treatment.

To perform the test, blood is drawn into bottles containing a liquid formula that enhances microbial growth, called a culture medium. Usually, two containers are collected during one draw, one of which is designed for aerobic organisms that require oxygen, and one of which is for anaerobic organisms, that do not. These two containers are referred to as a &quot;set&quot; of blood cultures. Two sets of blood cultures are sometimes collected from two different blood draw sites. If an organism only appears in one of the two sets, it is more likely to represent contamination with skin flora than a true bloodstream infection. False negative results can occur if the sample is collected after the person has received antimicrobial drugs or if the bottles are not filled with the recommended amount of blood. Some organisms do not grow well in blood cultures and require special techniques for detection.

The containers are placed in an incubator for several days to allow the organisms to multiply. If microbial growth is detected, a Gram stain is conducted from the culture bottle to confirm that organisms are present and provide preliminary information about their identity. The blood is then subcultured, meaning it is streaked onto an agar plate to isolate microbial colonies for full identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Because it is essential that bloodstream infections are diagnosed and treated quickly, rapid testing methods have been developed using technologies like polymerase chain reaction and MALDI-TOF MS.

Procedures for culturing the blood were published as early as the mid-19th century, but these techniques were labour-intensive and bore little resemblance to contemporary methods. Detection of microbial growth involved visual examination of the culture bottles until automated blood culture systems, which monitor gases produced by microbial metabolism, were introduced in the 1970s. In developed countries, manual blood culture methods have largely been made obsolete by automated systems.

==Medical uses==
Blood is normally . The presence of bacteria in the blood is termed bacteremia, and the presence of fungi is called fungemia. Minor damage to the skin or mucous membranes, which can occur in situations like toothbrushing or defecation, can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream, but this bacteremia is normally transient and is rarely detected in cultures because the immune system and reticuloendothelial system quickly sequester and destroy the organisms. Bacteria can enter the blood from infections such as cellulitis, UTIs and pneumonia; and infections within the vascular system, such as bacterial endocarditis or infections associated with intravenous lines, may result in a constant bacteremia. Fungemia occurs most commonly in people with poorly functioning immune systems. If bacteria or fungi are not cleared from the bloodstream, they can spread to other organs and tissues, or evoke an immune response that leads to a systemic inflammatory condition called sepsis, which can be life-threatening.

When sepsis is suspected, it is necessary to draw blood cultures to identify the causative agent and provide targeted antimicrobial therapy. People who are hospitalized and have a fever, a low body temperature, a high white blood cell count or a low count of granulocytes (a category of white blood cells) commonly have cultures drawn to detect a possible bloodstream infection. Blood cultures are used to detect bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenia, a common complication of chemotherapy in which fever occurs alongside a severely low count of neutrophils (white blood cells that defend against bacterial and fungal pathogens). Bacteremia is common in some types of infections, such as meningitis, septic arthritis and epidural abscesses, so blood cultures are indicated in these conditions. In infections less strongly associated with bacteremia, blood culture may still be indicated if the individual is at high risk of acquiring an intravascular infection or if cultures cannot be promptly obtained from the main site of infection (for example, a urine culture in pyelonephritis or a sputum culture in severe community-acquired pneumonia). Blood culture can identify an underlying microbial cause in cases of endocarditis and fever of unknown origin.

The pathogens most frequently identified in blood cultures include &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and other members of the family &quot;Enterobacteriaceae&quot;, &quot;Enterococcus&quot; species, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Candida albicans&quot;. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are also commonly encountered, although it is often unclear whether these organisms, which constitute part of the normal skin flora, are true pathogens or merely contaminants. In blood cultures taken from newborn babies and children, CNS can indicate significant infections. The epidemiology of bloodstream infections varies with time and place; for instance, Gram-positive organisms overtook Gram-negative organisms as the predominant cause of bacteremia in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s, and rates of fungemia have greatly increased in association with a growing population of people receiving immunosuppressive treatments such as chemotherapy. Gram-negative sepsis is more common in Central and South America, Eastern Europe, and Asia than in North America and Western Europe; and in Africa, &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; is a leading cause of bacteremia.

==Procedure==
===Collection===
Blood cultures are typically drawn through venipuncture. Collecting the sample from an intravenous line is not recommended, as this is associated with higher contamination rates, although cultures may be collected from both venipuncture and an intravenous line to diagnose catheter-associated infections. Prior to the blood draw, the top of each collection bottle is disinfected using an alcohol swab to prevent contamination. The skin around the puncture site is then cleaned and left to dry; some protocols recommend disinfection with an alcohol-based antiseptic followed by either chlorhexidine or an iodine-based preparation, while others consider using only an alcohol-containing antiseptic to be sufficient. If blood must be drawn for other tests at the same time as a blood culture, the culture bottles are drawn first to minimize the risk of contamination. Because antimicrobial therapy can cause false negative results by inhibiting the growth of microbes, it is recommended that blood cultures are drawn before antimicrobial drugs are given, although this may be impractical in people who are critically ill.

A typical blood culture collection involves drawing blood into two bottles, which together form one &quot;culture&quot; or &quot;set&quot;. One bottle is designed to enhance the growth of aerobic organisms, and the other is designed to grow anaerobic organisms. In children, infection with anaerobic bacteria is uncommon, so a single aerobic bottle may be collected to minimize the amount of blood required. It is recommended that at least two sets are collected from two separate venipuncture locations. This helps to distinguish infection from contamination, as contaminants are less likely to appear in more than one set than true pathogens. Additionally, the collection of larger volumes of blood increases the likelihood that microorganisms will be detected if present.

Blood culture bottles contain a growth medium, which encourages microorganisms to multiply, and an anticoagulant that prevents blood from clotting. Sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS) is the most commonly used anticoagulant because it does not interfere with the growth of most organisms. The exact composition of the growth medium varies, but aerobic bottles use a broth that is enriched with nutrients, such as brain-heart infusion or trypticase soy broth, and anaerobic bottles typically contain a reducing agent such as thioglycollate. The empty space in an anaerobic bottle is filled with a gas mixture that does not contain oxygen.

Many commercially manufactured bottles contain a resin that absorbs antibiotics to reduce their action on the microorganisms in the sample. Bottles intended for paediatric use are designed to accommodate lower blood volumes and have additives that enhance the growth of pathogens more commonly found in children. Other specialized bottles may be used to detect fungi and mycobacteria. In low and middle income countries, pre-formulated culture bottles can be prohibitively expensive, and it may be necessary to prepare the bottles manually. It can be difficult to access the proper supplies and facilities, and in some regions, it may not be possible to perform blood cultures at all.

It is important that the bottles are neither underfilled nor overfilled: underfilling can lead to false negative results as fewer organisms are present in the sample, while overfilling can inhibit microbial growth because the ratio of growth medium to blood is comparatively lower. A 1:10 to 1:5 ratio of blood to culture medium is suggested to optimize microbial growth. For routine blood cultures in adults, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommends the collection of two sets of bottles from two different draws, with 20–30 mL of blood drawn in each set. In children, the amount of blood to be drawn is often based on the child&#x27;s age or weight. If endocarditis is suspected, a total of six bottles may be collected.

===Culturing===

After the blood is collected, the bottles are incubated at body temperature to encourage the growth of microorganisms. Bottles are usually incubated for up to five days in automated systems, although most common bloodstream pathogens are detected within 48 hours. The incubation time may be extended further if manual blood culture methods are used or if slower-growing organisms, such as certain bacteria that cause endocarditis, are suspected. In manual systems, the bottles are visually examined for indicators of microbial growth, which might include cloudiness, the production of gas, the presence of visible microbial colonies, or a change in colour from the digestion of blood, which is called hemolysis. Some manual blood culture systems indicate growth using a compartment that fills with fluid when gases are produced, or a miniature agar plate which is periodically inoculated by tipping the bottle. To ensure that positive blood cultures are not missed, a sample from the bottle is often inoculated onto an agar plate (subcultured) at the end of the incubation period regardless of whether or not indicators of growth are observed.

In developed countries, manual culture methods have largely been replaced by automated systems that provide continuous computerized monitoring of the culture bottles. These systems, such as the BACTEC, BacT/ALERT and VersaTrek, consist of an incubator in which the culture bottles are continuously mixed. Growth is detected by sensors that measure the levels of gases inside the bottle—most commonly carbon dioxide—which serve as an indicator of microbial metabolism. An alarm or a visual indicator alerts the microbiologist to the presence of a positive blood culture bottle. If the bottle remains negative at the end of the incubation period, it is generally discarded without being subcultured.

A technique called the lysis-centrifugation method can be used for improved isolation of slow-growing or fastidious organisms, such as fungi, mycobacteria, and &quot;Legionella&quot;. Rather than incubating the blood in a bottle filled with growth medium, this method involves collecting blood into a tube containing an agent that destroys (lyses) red and white blood cells, then spinning the sample in a centrifuge. This process concentrates the solid contents of the sample, including microorganisms if present, into a pellet, which is used to inoculate the subculture media. While lysis-centrifugation offers greater sensitivity than conventional blood culture methods, it is prone to contamination because it requires extensive manipulation of the sample.

===Identification===

If growth is detected, a microbiologist will perform a Gram stain on a sample of blood from the bottle for a rapid preliminary identification of the organism. The Gram stain classifies bacteria as Gram-positive or Gram-negative and provides information about their shape—whether they are rod-shaped (referred to as bacilli), spherical (referred to as cocci), or spiral-shaped (spirochetes)—as well as their arrangement. Gram-positive cocci in clusters, for example, are typical of &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species. Yeast and other fungi may also be identified from the Gram stain. A Gram stain identifying microbial growth from a blood culture is considered a critical result and must immediately be reported to the clinician. The Gram stain provides information about the possible identity of the organism, which assists the clinician in the selection of a more appropriate antimicrobial treatment before the full culture and sensitivity results are complete.

In traditional methods, the blood is then subcultured onto agar plates to isolate the organism for further testing. The Gram stain results inform microbiologists about what types of agar plates should be used and what tests might be appropriate to identify the organism. In some cases, no organisms are seen on the Gram stain despite the culture bottle showing indicators of growth or being reported as positive by automated instruments. This may represent a false positive result, but it is possible that organisms are present but cannot easily be visualized microscopically. Positive bottles with negative Gram stains are subcultured before being returned to the incubator, often using special culture media that promotes the growth of slow-growing organisms.

It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for sufficient growth to occur on the subculture plates for definitive identification to be possible. At this point, the microbiologist will assess the appearance of the bacterial or fungal colonies and carry out tests that provide information about the metabolic and biochemical features of the organism, which permit identification to the genus or species level. For example, the catalase test can distinguish streptococci and staphylococci (two genera of Gram-positive cocci) from each other, and the coagulase test can differentiate &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, a common culprit of bloodstream infections, from the less pathogenic coagulase-negative staphylococci.

Microorganisms may also be identified using automated systems, such as instruments that perform panels of biochemical tests, or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), in which microbial proteins are ionized and characterized on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratios; each microbial species exhibits a characteristic pattern of proteins when analyzed through mass spectrometry.

Because bloodstream infections can be life-threatening, timely diagnosis and treatment is critical, and to this end several rapid identification methods have been developed. MALDI-TOF can be used to identify organisms directly from positive blood culture bottles after separation and concentration procedures, or from preliminary growth on the agar plate within a few hours of subculturing. Genetic methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarrays can identify microorganisms by detection of DNA sequences specific to certain species in blood culture samples. Several systems designed for the identification of common blood culture pathogens are commercially available. Some biochemical and immunologic tests can be performed directly on positive blood cultures, such as the tube coagulase test for identification of &quot;S. aureus&quot; or latex agglutination tests for &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, and unlike PCR and MALDI-TOF, these methods may be practical for laboratories in low and middle income countries. It is also possible to directly inoculate microbial identification panels with blood from a positive culture bottle, although this is not as reliable as testing subcultured bacteria because additives from the growth media can interfere with the results.

Even faster diagnosis could be achieved through bypassing culture entirely and detecting pathogens directly from blood samples. A few direct testing systems are commercially available as of 2018, but the technology is still in its infancy. Most panels detect only a limited number of pathogens, and the sensitivity can be poor compared to conventional blood culture methods. Culturing remains necessary in order to carry out full antimicrobial sensitivity testing.

===Antibiotic susceptibility testing===

Antimicrobial treatment of bloodstream infections is initially empiric, meaning it is based on the clinician&#x27;s suspicion about the causative agent of the disease and local patterns of antimicrobial resistance. Carrying out antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) on pathogens isolated from a blood culture allows clinicians to provide a more targeted treatment and to discontinue broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can have undesirable side effects. In traditional AST methods, such as the disk diffusion test, pure colonies of the organism are selected from the subculture plate and used to inoculate a secondary medium. These methods require overnight incubation before results can be obtained. There are automated systems which use pre-formulated antibiotic panels, measure microbial growth automatically, and determine the sensitivity results using algorithms; some of these can provide results in as little as five hours, but others require overnight incubation as well.

Rapid administration of effective antimicrobial drugs is crucial in the treatment of sepsis, so several methods have been developed to provide faster antibiotic sensitivity results. Conventional AST methods can be carried out on young growth from the subculture plate, pellets of microorganisms obtained from concentration and purification of the positive blood culture, or directly from the culture bottle. Because direct testing methods do not isolate the organisms, they do not provide accurate results if more than one microorganism is present, although this is an infrequent occurrence in blood cultures. Another source of error is the difficulty in standardizing the amount of bacteria in the sample (the ), which has a profound effect on the test results.

Genetic testing can be used for rapid detection of certain antimicrobial resistance markers. Methods such as PCR and microarrays, which can be performed directly on positive blood culture samples, detect DNA sequences associated with genes that confer resistance, such as the &quot;mecA&quot; gene found in methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; or the &quot;vanA&quot; and &quot;vanB&quot; genes of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. MALDI-TOF has been explored as a rapid antimicrobial sensitivity testing method; principles involve measuring microbial growth in the presence of antibiotics, identifying the breakdown of antibiotics by microbial enzymes, and detecting protein spectra associated with bacterial strains that exhibit antibiotic resistance. Some of these methods can be performed on pellets from positive blood culture bottles. However, the lack of established methodologies for AST by MALDI-TOF limits its use in clinical practice, and direct AST by MALDI-TOF, unlike genetic testing methods, had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as of 2018.

==Limitations== 
Blood cultures are subject to both false positive and false negative errors. In automated culture systems, identification of positive bottles is based on the detection of gases produced by cellular metabolism, so samples with high numbers of white blood cells may be reported as positive when no bacteria are present. Inspection of the growth curve produced by the instrument can help to distinguish between true and false positive cultures, but Gram staining and subculturing are still necessary for any sample that is flagged as positive.

Blood cultures can become contaminated with microorganisms from the skin or the environment, which multiply inside the culture bottle, giving the false impression that those organisms are present in the blood. Contamination of blood cultures can lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment and longer hospital stays. The frequency of contamination can be reduced by following established protocols for blood culture collection, but it cannot be eliminated; for instance, bacteria can survive in deeper layers of the skin even after meticulous disinfection of the blood draw site. The CLSI defines an acceptable contamination rate as no greater than 3% of all blood cultures. The frequency of contamination varies widely between institutions and between different departments in the same hospital; studies have found rates ranging from 0.8 to 12.5 percent.

When faced with a positive blood culture result, clinicians must decide whether the finding represents contamination or genuine infection. Some organisms, such as &quot;S. aureus&quot; or &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, are usually considered to be pathogenic when detected in a blood culture, while others are more likely to represent contamination with skin flora; but even common skin organisms such as coagulase-negative staphylococci can cause bloodstream infections under certain conditions. When such organisms are present, interpretation of the culture result involves taking into account the person&#x27;s clinical condition and whether or not multiple cultures are positive for the same organism.

False negatives may be caused by drawing blood cultures after the person has received antibiotics or collecting an insufficient amount of blood. The volume of blood drawn is considered the most important variable in ensuring that pathogens are detected: the more blood that is collected, the more pathogens are recovered. However, if the amount of blood collected far exceeds the recommended volume, bacterial growth may be inhibited by natural inhibitors present in the blood and an inadequate amount of growth medium in the bottle. Over-filling of blood culture bottles may also contribute to iatrogenic anemia.

Not all pathogens are easily detected by conventional blood culture methods. Particularly fastidious organisms, such as &quot;Brucella&quot; and &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; species, may require prolonged incubation times or special culture media. Some organisms are exceedingly difficult to culture or do not grow in culture at all, so serology testing or molecular methods such as PCR are preferred if infection with these organisms is suspected.

==History==

Early blood culture methods were labour-intensive. One of the first known procedures, published in 1869, recommended that leeches be used to collect blood from the patient. A microbiology textbook from 1911 noted that decontamination of the draw site and equipment could take over an hour, and that due to a lack of effective methods for preserving blood, the cultures would sometimes have to be prepared at the patient&#x27;s bedside. In addition to subculturing the broth, some protocols specified that the blood be mixed with melted agar and the mixture poured into a petri dish. In 1915, a blood culture collection system consisting of glass vacuum tubes containing glucose broth and an anticoagulant was described. Robert James Valentine Pulvertaft published a seminal work on blood cultures in 1930, specifying—among other insights—an optimal blood-to-broth ratio of 1:5, which is still accepted today. The use of SPS as an anticoagulant and preservative was introduced in the 1930s and 40s and resolved some of the logistical issues with earlier methods. From the 1940s through the 1980s, a great deal of research was carried out on broth formulations and additives, with the goal of creating a growth medium that could accommodate all common bloodstream pathogens.

In 1947, M.R. Castañeda invented a &quot;biphasic&quot; culture bottle for the identification of &quot;Brucella&quot; species, which contained both broth and an agar slant, allowing the agar to be easily subcultured from the broth; this was a precursor of some contemporary systems for manual blood cultures. E.G. Scott in 1951 published a protocol described as &quot;the advent of the modern blood culture set&quot;. Scott&#x27;s method involved inoculating blood into two rubber-sealed glass bottles; one for aerobes and one for anaerobes. The aerobic bottle contained trypticase soy broth and an agar slant, and the anaerobic bottle contained thioglycollate broth. The lysis-centrifugation method was introduced in 1917 by Mildred Clough, but it was rarely used in clinical practice until commercial systems were developed in the mid-1970s.

Automated blood culture systems first became available in the 1970s. The earliest of these—the BACTEC systems, produced by Johnston Laboratories (now Becton Dickinson)—used culture broths containing nutrients labelled with radioactive isotopes. Microbes that fed on these substrates would produce radioactive carbon dioxide, and growth could be detected by monitoring its concentration. Before this technique was applied to blood cultures, it had been proposed by NASA as a method for detecting life on Mars. Throughout the 1970s and 80s several manufacturers attempted to detect microbial growth by measuring changes in the electrical conductivity of the culture medium, but none of these methods were commercially successful.

A major issue with the early BACTEC systems was that they produced radioactive waste, which required special disposal procedures, so in 1984 a new generation of BACTEC instruments was released that used spectrophotometry to detect CO2. The BacT/ALERT system, which indirectly detects production of CO2 by measuring the decrease in the medium&#x27;s pH, was approved for use in the US in 1991. Unlike the BACTEC systems available at the time, the BacT/ALERT did not require a needle to be introduced into the bottle for sampling; this reduced the frequency of contamination and made it the first system to provide truly continuous monitoring of blood cultures. This non-invasive measurement method was adopted in 1992 by the BACTEC 9000 series, which used fluorescent indicators to detect pH changes. The Difco ESP, a direct predecessor of the contemporary VersaTREK system which detects gas production by measuring pressure changes, was also first approved in 1992. By 1996, an international study found that 55% of 466 laboratories surveyed were using the BACTEC or BacT/ALERT systems, with other automated systems accounting for 10% of the total.

<text>Almeirim () is a city and a municipality in Santarém District, Portugal. The population in 2011 was 23,376, in an area of 222.12 km2. The city proper had a population of 10,520 in 2001.

==History==
There are vestiges of mid-Paleolithic to Mesolithic period along the territory, including traces from Neolithic, Calcolithic and Bronze Age remnants. The Iron Age also marked this region, with archaeological excavations unearthing settlements and artefacts.

Roman legions of Décimo Junius Brutus occupied the territory, following the Tagus upstream and disembarking in Santarém, where they left their marks. These, along with other groups, occupied arable lands, beginning in the first century A.D. This included the development of agriculture (particularly wheat and olive orchards) and raising of cattle, supporting the establishment of Almeirim along the margins of the Tagus.

References to this municipality, began appearing in the 14th century. With rich lands, the territory supported hunting, extending to Santarém, and proximities of the Tagus and Lisbon. This easy access, made Almeirim a preferred place for the Kings of the second Dynasty, and a winter place frequented by members of Corte, becoming known as the &quot;Sintra of Winter&quot;. Almeirim, therefore, became an ideal place for relaxation, palace intrigue and romantic encounters in the royal gardens, mixed with resolutions of important negotiations.

King John I, between 1411 and 1423, ordered the construction of a (castellated) royal palace and first residences that contributed to the establishment of the town, with the work to the &quot;Al-meirim&quot;, that included landscaping, drainage and earthen-works.

In 1483, Almeirim was elevated to the status of municipality, wherein he bestowed a concession on its residents. As a consequence, in 1490, its first &quot;almoxarife&quot; (&quot;sheriff&quot;) Álvaro Pires Borges was assigned by King D. John II from the royal guard.

In 1500, the Church of São João Baptista was constructed.

The palace was expanded and improved by Manuel I of Portugal who was in Almeirim several times: in 1510, part of 1513, Christmas of 1514 and all the period between October 1515 and May 1516. John III of Portugal followed his example, and spent similar time in Almeirim. He ordered the construction of a royal palace near the &quot;Ribeira de Muge&quot; (&quot;Muja&quot; or &quot;Mugem&quot;), that became known as &quot;Paço da Ribeira de Muge&quot; and later, the &quot;Paço dos Negros&#x27;, then later the Convent of Nossa Senhora da Serra.

King Sebastian, who frequently visited Almeirim, created a dynastic succession crisis with his disappearance at the Battle of Alcácer-Quibir. Without a successor, the Cortes of Almeirim was opened by Cardinal Henry on 11 January 1580, to decide on the problem of succession. During the Cortes, Febo Moniz, as magistrate of Lisbon, directed his response to the Cardinal, stating &quot;Give this your Highness to a Portuguese prince and all will kiss his hand&quot;. But, little was resolved, and the Kingdom eventually began to be governed by Philip II of Spain, beginning the reign of Phillipian Dynastic Union, until 1 December 1640.

At the time Almeirim was visited as a winter resort, where many passed through the roads of the burgh and stayed at the Royal Palace. Gil Vicente, the father of Portuguese theatre, presented many of his farses, comedies and plays, for example &quot;Auto da Fé&quot; in 1510; &quot;Barca da Glória&quot; in 1519; tragic-comedy &quot;Dom Dardos&quot; at the marriage of Infanta D. Isabel with Charles V, in 1525; and in 1526 he presented the farse &quot;O Juiz da Beira&quot;, the tragic-comedy &quot;Templo de Apolo&quot;, &quot;Breve Sumário da História de Deus&quot; and &quot;Diálogo sobre a Ressurreição&quot;. It was also in the palace the Garcia de Resende began printing his &quot;Cancioneiro Geral.&quot;

In the &quot;Memórias Paroquiais&quot; (1758) the resident population was just over 302 neighbours.

With the inauguration of the D. Luís bridge in 1881, the connection between Almeirim and Santarém, allowed a significant change in the economy.

In 1935, the &quot;Casa do Povo&quot;, health centre and dispensary were inaugurated. By the middle of the century (1953), the bullring, a social centre of annual activities was also open to the public.

On 20 June 1991, the settlement was elevated to the status of city.

The municipal assembly approved ARU02, designating the &quot;Área de Reabilitação Urbana&quot; (&quot;Urban Rehabilitation Area&quot;) for Almeirim (8902/2014, Diário da República, 147, Série 1) in order to modernize and recuperate many of the historic buildings in the town.

==Geography==

Almeirim is situated from Lisbon, and in Santarém; its neighbours include Alpiarça (to the north), Chamusca (in the east and northeast), Salvaterra da Magos, Coruche (both in the south), Santarém (in the northwest) and Cartaxo (in the south). The municipality is situated on a plain along the Tagus Valley and Lezíria, approximately along the left bank of the Tagus River. The morphology of the terrain is marked by a planar relief with little forests, with cultivation interspersed between pastures and vineyards.

The municipality of Almeirim is subdivided into the following 4 parishes:
* Almeirim
* Benfica do Ribatejo
* Fazendas de Almeirim
* Raposa
Two main roadways support the population of Almeirim: the EN114 and EN118, in addition to the inter-community IC10. The construction of the Salgueiro Maia bridge and A13 bridge serves and reinforces the privileged location of Almeirim, in addition to constant traffic from Santarém and the rest of the country.

==Economy==
The mainstay of the economy is agriculture, including wine making and modern industry of alimentary products such as fruit juices, processed tomato and canned vegetables (Compal).

==Culture==
The city is also known for its gastronomy, to which Stone Soup is just one great example. According to the people of Almeirim, a poor friar who was on a pilgrimage stopped in the village of Almeirim and knocked on the door of a house. He was too proud to beg for a bite to eat, so instead, he requested a large pot in which he could make “a delicious and filling...stone soup”. With arched eyebrows and curious glances, the family invited him into their home and set up a large pot over flickering flames and filled with water. Slowly walking up to the iron clad cauldron, the friar reached into his deep pocket to produce a smooth and well-cleaned stone that he promptly dropped into the boiling water. A little while later he tasted the soup and said that it needed a touch of seasoning. 

So, the wife brought him some salt to add, to which he suggested that maybe a little bit of chouriço (sausage), or pork belly, would be better. Graciously, she obliged and dropped several thick slices into the pot. Then, the friar asked if she might not have a little something to enrich the soup, such as potatoes or beans from a previous meal. With a broad smile, she agreed, and added a healthy portion into the bubbling water. This banter continued back and forth between the family and the friar before he finally announced that he had indeed made a very delicious and filling soup. When the soup was done, the friar fished the stone out of the pot, washed and dried it off, and plopped it back in his pocket for the next time.

Nowadays Almeirim is a gastronomical destiny for Portuguese people, as well as for foreign people, willing to taste this soup.

<text>Tinago Falls is a waterfall on the Agus River, located in between the town of Linamon and Iligan City, Lanao del Norte in the northern part of the Philippine island of Mindanao. It is one of the main tourist attractions of Iligan, a city known as the &quot;City of Majestic Waterfalls&quot;.

&quot;Tinago&quot; is a Filipino term meaning &quot;hidden&quot;, the falls being hidden in a deep ravine. Trekking to the falls requires approximately 500 descending steps called the winding staircase.

The falls is high, its very cold waters cascading beautifully into a deep and calm basin-like pool which appears like a blue-colored lagoon. Under the falls is a small cave where people can enter and listen to the rumbling waters.

==Legend==
Folklore has it that there once lived an influential and powerful Sultan Agok and his wife. They were appointed by their people as their king and queen. But they became too proud of themselves and became selfish rulers of their kingdom. When the sultan&#x27;s wife was pregnant, an enchantress, disguised as a beggar, begged for their help but instead they rejected her. Because of this, the enchantress cursed the couple&#x27;s future child&#x27;s appearance. She will be born ugly. 

The child was indeed born ugly. The couple was sad and disappointed, expecting the baby to be as lovely as her mother. They hid the child in a cave to avoid embarrassment and named the baby Tin-ag, which means &quot;hidden face&quot;. They visited and took care of the baby in the cave.

When the child grew up, she went out of the cave and was amazed by the outside world. However, people were not kind to her and she suffered from their taunts and jeers. The enchantress, saw her suffering and wanted to help. Tin-ag wanted to be transformed into a thing of beauty and splendor. The enchantress acquiesced. But unbeknownst to Tin-ag, she was to be transformed into a waterfall. She indeed became so beautiful and lovely. This is now known as Tinago Falls in Iligan City. 



==Geography==
Tinago Falls is located in a deep ravine in Barangay Ditucalan, Iligan City. The falls plunges high from a cliff.

<doc id="1250098" wikidata="Q1041398" url="?curid=1250098" title="Sthiramati">
<text>Sthiramati (Sanskrit; Chinese: Anhui 安慧, and Jianhui 堅慧; Tibetan: &quot;Blo gros brtan pa&quot;) was a 6th-century Indian Buddhist scholar-monk. Sthiramati was a student of a Yogācāra scholar named Gunamati, and he was also a contemporary of another 6th century Yogācāra scholar, Dharmapala of Nālandā. Sthiramati is connected with Valābhi university (present-day Gujarat), and also with Nālandā. Evidence from two inscriptions indicate that a figure named Sthiramati founded a monastery at Valābhi. 

Sthiramati is mainly known for his numerous commentaries to Yogācāra and Abhidharma works which synthesized a varied tradition into a more coherent system. 

== Philosophy ==
While Sthiramati closely follows the classic philosophy of Yogācāra Buddhism found in the works of Vasubandhu and Asanga, his work also contains several innovative interpretations of Yogācāra philosophy. 

One of Sthiramati&#x27;s innovative contributions is his theory of meaning found in his &quot;Triṃśikā-bhāṣya&quot;. According to Sthiramati, all language use is figurative or metaphorical (Sanskrit: upacāra). Drawing on a passage in Vasubandhu, Sthiramati argues that all phenomena (dharmas) are mere mental appearances (nirbhāsa), i.e. mental representations (vijñapti). As such, no word can relate to an objectively existent phenomena (since no such thing exists). Words are only related to constructed mental appearances which come from the dependently arisen transformation of consciousness (vijñāna-pariṇāma). These phenomena deceptively appear as objectively existent things, but are ultimately unreal, like optical illusions. Thus, no words have an objective referent, and thus all language is necessarily figurative, a theory that has been termed pan-figurative or pan-metaphorical. 

Sthiramati&#x27;s philosophy is one of various attempts to systematize and develop Yogācāra Buddhism. His system differed from that of other Yogācāra thinkers of his time, like Dharmapala of Nalanda, in various ways. Their varying interpretations are also discussed in Xuanzang’s (7th century) &quot;Chéng Wéishì Lùn&quot;. One point of contention was the status of the dependent nature. Sthiramati thought that the dependent nature was characterized by duality (of subject-object), which is the result of false imagination. So for Sthiramati, the dependent nature is empty and not ultimately real. In Sthiramati&#x27;s system, the only thing that has real existence (dravyasat) is &quot;the bare reality, free from the differentiation into subject and object&quot;. This is the true essence of the dependent nature (i.e. the perfected nature). Because of this, Sthiramati&#x27;s view has also been compared to the Nirākāravāda (&quot;false aspectarian&quot;) view of Yogācāra by modern scholars, since he holds that all mental images are unreal and false. 

Meanwhile, in Dharmapala&#x27;s system, the dependent nature is the basis or pivot for both the imagined nature (if the dependent nature is discriminated dualistically) and the perfected nature (if duality is removed). For him, the dependent nature is both empty in one sense (when it is falsely discriminated) but also not-empty is another sense (in its true non-dual structure). Thus, for Dharmapala, the dependent nature and the perfected nature are both real, and they are also understood as being neither the same nor different. Because of this, Dharmapala&#x27;s view has been seen as prefiguring the Sākāravāda view. 

Another disagreement between these two leading Yogācāra interpretations was their understandings of the doctrine of the transformation of consciousness (vijñāna-pariṇāma). According to some Yogācāra thinkers, consciousness transforms into various aspects: the seeing aspect (darśana-bhāga, i.e. subjectivity), the objective aspect (nimitta-bhāga, i.e. all objects of experience), the self-reflexive or self-knowing aspect (saṃvitti-bhāga, a division introduced by Dignaga), and (in Dharmapala&#x27;s system), awareness of self-awareness (svasaṃvitti-saṃvitti). For Dharmapala, these four divisions were seen as working simultaneously to give rise to experience. However, Sthiramati&#x27;s system only accepts the first three divisions. Furthermore, for Sthiramati, the first two divisions are imagined and ultimately unreal, while only the self-reflexive aspect is ultimately real. Thus, in Sthiramati&#x27;s system, there is truly only one aspect (bhāga), one single dynamic self-aware consciousness in which causes and effects arise moment by moment.

The view outlined above is the traditional understanding of Sthiramati&#x27;s philosophy in Chinese Yogācāra scholasticism. Some modern scholars like Hidenori Sakuma have questioned theis tradition understanding of Sthiramati&#x27;s Yogācāra views due to a lack of primary source evidence. Sakuma argues that this view derives from the work of Kuiji, and that this is unreliable.

Furthermore, Sakuma also argues that it is likely there were different Indian commentators whose work later became conflated into one figure named &quot;Sthiramati&quot;.

== Works ==
Sthiramati wrote ten surviving commentaries on various Buddhist treatises: 

# &quot;The Explication of the Compendium of the Abhidharma&quot; (&quot;Abhidharmasamuccayavyākhyā&quot;; currently in Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese). The Tibetan tradition attribute this text to an author named Jinaputra. 
# &quot;The Commentary on the Treasury of Abhidharma [Called] True Reality&quot; (&quot;Tattvārthā Abhidharmakośaṭīkā&quot;, survives in full Tibetan translation and some parts in Sanskrit)
# &quot;The Commentary on the Treatise on the Five Constituents&quot; (&quot;Pañcaskandhakavibhāṣā&quot;; survives in Sanskrit and Tibetan)
# &quot;The Commentary on the Treatise on Mental Presentation in Thirty Verses&quot; (&quot;Triṃśikāvijñaptibhāṣya&quot;; survives in Sanskrit and Tibetan)
# &quot;The Commentary on the Distinguishing of the Middle from the Extremes&quot; (&quot;Madhyāntavibhāgaṭīkā&quot;; survives in Sanskrit and Tibetan)
# &quot;The Commentary on the Comments to the Ornament of [Mahāyāna] Sūtras&quot; (&quot;*Sūtrālaṃkāravṛttibhāṣya&quot;; survives in Tibetan)
# &quot;The Commentary on the Kāśyapa Chapter&quot; (&quot;*Kāśyapaparivartaṭīkā&quot;; survives in Tibetan and Chinese)
# &quot;The Commentary on the Mahāyāna Madhyamaka&quot; (&quot;Dasheng zhongguan shilun&quot; 大乘中觀釋論; survives in Chinese)
# &quot;The Commentary on the Exposition of Akṣayamati&quot; (&quot;*Akṣayamatinirdeśaṭīkā&quot;; survives in Tibetan)
# &quot;A commentary on the Collection of Means of Knowledge&quot; (&quot;Pramanasamuccaya&quot;; currently lost).
Furthermore, &quot;Sāramati&quot; (Chinese: Suoluomodi 娑囉末底) is the author of the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; according to the Chinese translator and scholar Fazang (643–712). However, this is likely to be a different figure than the commentator Sthiramati according to Sakuma. Takasaki Jikido is certain that the author of the embedded commentary (verse and prose) to the core text (verse) of the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; is &quot;Sāramati&quot;.

<text>Lake Overholser is a reservoir within the city limits of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Lake Overholser is formed by Overholser Dam on the North Canadian River in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. The lake is west of Bethany and from Yukon. Lake Overholser is named after Ed Overholser who was the 16th Mayor of the City of Oklahoma City.

The lake was originally intended to assure an adequate supply of municipal water, since the city depended primarily on the North Canadian River as a source, supplemented by private wells. The need for flood control capability became obvious when the river flooded in 1923. It breached the Lake Overholser Dam and inundated much of the city.

==Description==

===Lake===
The lake covers approximately 1,500 acres (6 km2) and was constructed in 1919 to provide water to a treatment plant. According to USGS, its capacity is The average depth is and the maximum depth is only .

===U.S. Route 66===
&quot;The Mother Road&quot; was situated along the North shore of Lake Overholser from 1926 to 1958. A 1958 Route 66 improvement project created a new alignment for the highway that relocated the roadbed about 1/4 mile North of the lake. The original 1926 section of Route 66 still exists and was renamed North Overholser Drive. This includes the picturesque Lake Overholser Bridge. The alignment runs south of the Stonebridge Lake Estates and Ramsey Lake and is considered one of the most scenic sections of the original Route 66.

===Dam===
The Lake Overholser Dam, designed by Niels Ambursen and built by the Ambursen Construction Company of New York, is high and long. Oklahoma City residents voted a $1.5 million bond issue in 1916 to pay for the project. The dam is built of reinforced poured concrete.

The dam has four distinct sections of buttressed spillways and a solid spillway. A concrete walkway extends across the dam over the buttresses until it comes to the larger spillway, where it is carried by a Pratt through truss.

A concrete wing wall anchors the dam into the eastern riverbank. The first span of the dam, between the eastern wing wall and the pump house, is wide. The brick-walled pump house has a gabled tile roof, a small chimney, and two round ventilators. It sits above four arched sluiceway openings.

==1923 flood==
On October 16, 1923, operators at the central telephone exchange of Oklahoma City began calling to notify subscribers living south of Grand Avenue (now Sheridan Avenue) of an impending flood caused by levee breakage at the recently built City Reservoir (now known as Lake Overholser). The daily newspaper, The Oklahoman, reported that 300 national guardsmen and American Legion volunteers had been sent to organize evacuation of a 117-block area of the city that was expected to be severely impacted by the 25-foot wall of water already heading in that direction.

Later, the paper reported that it was not the dam that had failed, but the embankment (levee) at the west end of the dam that had given way after being battered by flood waters that had built up behind the dam. Within thirty minutes, the initial rush of water had raised the downstream river level by . The river held at that level for two hours, but by then the level at the east end of the dam failed, sending the downstream river level higher in a matter of minutes.

By the time the crisis had passed, Jones, Oklahoma and Spencer, Oklahoma, two towns downstream of Oklahoma City, had been surrounded by water. The official damage estimate was five people confirmed dead and property loss was $3,500,000.

==Recreational facilities==
Lake Overholser is a popular fishing area for local residents. A covered fishing pier is on the southwest side of the lake. Species of fish include white bass, bream, bluegill, striped bass, flathead catfish, crappie, carp, catfish and largemouth bass.

Boating is allowed on the lake, but swimming is prohibited. Young students have nicknamed the lake &quot;Lake Holdhercloser&quot; due to the lake being a popular make out spot among teens.

<text>Keystone Lake is a reservoir in northeastern Oklahoma on the Arkansas and Cimarron rivers. It is located upstream about from Tulsa. It was created in 1968 when the Keystone Dam was completed. The primary purposes are: flood control, hydroelectric power generation, wildlife management and recreation.

==General description==
Keystone Lake is about in area, and was designed to contain of water. It was named for the community of Keystone, which existed on the site from 1900 until 1962, when it was inundated by the waters of the lake. Construction of the lake forced the relocation of three other towns: Mannford, Oklahoma (also known as New Mannford by locals), Prue (also known as New Prue), and Appalachia Bay, Oklahoma. The town of Osage was partially abandoned to the lake, while the rest clings to the south shore. Engineers built a levee around low-lying areas of the south and east sides of Cleveland, Oklahoma to prevent flooding of that city. The shoreline extends for .

Two Oklahoma state parks, Keystone State Park and Walnut Creek State Park, are located along the shores of the lake offering camping, hiking and biking trails, fishing, swimming and boating opportunities. The area also features a Yogi Bear&#x27;s Jellystone Park Camp-Resort as you cross the Keystone Dam near Sand Springs.

The Keystone Lake project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1950. It was designed and built by the Tulsa District, Army Corps of Engineers. Construction began in January 1957 and was complete for flood control purposes in September 1964. Commercial operation of the power generating facility began in May 1968.

A reregulating dam, located downstream of the main dam, was also completed in 1968. Cost of the total project was approximately $123 million. In 1986, the reregulating dam was removed due to public safety issues, as 16 people had drowned at the dam.

==Dam construction details==
The dam was actually constructed across the Arkansas River, downstream of the confluence with the Cimarron River. It is built of rolled earthfill material. Maximum height of the dam is above the stream bed. The total length of the dam is , including a -long concrete section. The spillway in the concrete section is wide. The non-overflow part of the concrete section includes a power intake structure. State Highway 151 crosses the dam, connecting State Highway 51 on the south with U.S. Highway 64 on the north.

The spillway is a gated ogee weir, wide with eighteen tainter gates, each . Spillway capacity at the maximum pool level (elevation ) is . Capacity at the top of the flood control pool level (elevation ) is . The spillway also has nine sluices, each .

The power intake structure is between the spillway and the left non-overflow section of the dam. It includes two penstocks, each diameter and controlled by two gates. The power generation facility includes two hydroelectric generators, each rated at .

==Largest release in service==
In September and October 1986, Keystone Lake was filled to capacity when the remnants of Hurricane Paine entered Oklahoma and dropped nearly of water into the Cimarron and Arkansas rivers northwest of the lake, requiring the Corps of Engineers to release water downstream at a rate of , which made downstream flooding inevitable. As a result, a private levee in West Tulsa failed, causing more than $1.3 million in damages.

==Recreation==
According to the Corps of Engineers website, Keystone Lake has 16 recreational areas (including 3 alcohol-free beaches), 11 boat ramps, 4 marinas and 2 off-road vehicle areas. There are also campgrounds, a waterfowl refuge and a public hunting area. Keystone State Park nearby offers cabins. Fishing is popular, with the most plentiful species being striped bass, white bass, black bass, small mouth bass, crappie, and catfish. Fauna around the lake include: white-tailed deer, raccoon, bobcat, coyote, beaver, squirrel, cottontail rabbit, quail, dove, ducks and geese. Hunting and fishing licenses are regulated by Oklahoma and Federal laws.

Windycrest Sailing Club offers sailboat racing and cruising.

<doc id="1250110" wikidata="Q81295" url="?curid=1250110" title="Lake Hefner">
<text>Lake Hefner is a reservoir in northwestern Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was built in the 1940s to expand the water supply for the city of Oklahoma City,

It is named after Robert A. Hefner, who served as mayor of Oklahoma City from April 11, 1939, to April 8, 1947, but was originally named the &quot;Bluff Creek Reservoir.&quot; It also serves as a major recreational destination, as it is surrounded by of multi-use (bicycle, skating and pedestrian) trails. Stanley Draper was influential in securing the funding to develop the lake.

==Description==

The capacity of the lake is 75,000 acre-feet. Lake Hefner covers and averages deep. The lake&#x27;s outflow goes into Bluff Creek which travels north to meet up with Deer Creek, which then flows into the Cimarron River near Guthrie.

The lake is situated within the Oklahoma City urban area and is subsequently closely bordered by residential areas to the north, west, and east. The Lake Hefner Dam is located along the entire northern side of the lake (with Bluff Creek Park being located below the dam, on the other side of Hefner boulevard). Lake Hefner Parkway borders the east side of the lake, with some commercial development (including restaurants, bars and office buildings) located alongside the lake, as well as a 36-foot tall working replica of the second oldest lighthouse in the United States, the Brant Point Light near Nantucket, Massachusetts. The south side of the lake is the least developed, retaining the original forest along much of the shore. Lake Hefner Golf Course is located on the southwest corner of the lake. Immediately south of this are the Oklahoma City docks, commonly known as the city-side docks, the largest marina on the lake. The other marina on Lake Hefner is the Oklahoma City Boat Club (OCBC), a private organization that holds weekly sailboat races during the summer and is located on the east side. Just north of the OCBC is the East Wharf area, which contains several fairly upscale restaurants. On the south side of the lake is the Hobie Point, a YMCA sailing school, and Stars and Stripes Park. Stars and Stripes Park also has new additions of a Fitness court and a Skatepark. The Oklahoma Radio Kontrol Society (TORKS) has maintained a Radio Control air field since the early 1970s.

==Recreation==

Hefner is also a popular recreational fishing spot for Oklahoma City residents, and is populated with a variety of gamefish species including largemouth &amp; smallmouth bass, channel catfish, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, as well as white bass and hybrid striped bass.

Additionally, Hefner is a popular site for recreational boating, both with sailboats and motorized pleasure craft. Kiteboarding is also very popular on Hefner due to the excellent wind they receive all summer.
