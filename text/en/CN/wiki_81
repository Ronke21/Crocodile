<text>&quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; is a song by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan and the opening track of his 15th studio album &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; (1975). It was released as the album’s sole single, reaching No. 31 on the &quot;Billboard Hot&quot; 100. Written by Dylan and produced by David Zimmerman, Dylan&#x27;s brother, the song concerns relationships from different narrative perspectives. Dylan has altered the lyrics in subsequent performances, changing the point of view and details in the song.

The track initially was recorded in September 1974, but later re-recorded on 30 December that year at Sound 80 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The latter version was released on &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; on 20 January 1975. The song received widespread acclaim from music critics, with particular praise for the lyrics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 68 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. A number of alternate versions have been released, including multiple studio out-takes on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks&quot; (2014). Dylan has performed the song live over 1,600 times.

== Background and recording ==
The song was written in the summer of 1974, after Dylan&#x27;s comeback tour with The Band that year and his separation from Sara Dylan, whom he had married in 1965. Dylan had moved to a farm in Minnesota with his brother, David Zimmerman, and there started to write the songs that were recorded for his album &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;. In the spring of 1974, Dylan had taken art classes at Carnegie Hall and was influenced by his tutor Norman Raeben, and in particular Raeben&#x27;s view of time, when writing the lyrics. In a 1978 interview Dylan explained this style of songwriting: &quot;What&#x27;s different about it is that there&#x27;s a code in the lyrics, and there&#x27;s also no sense of time. There&#x27;s no respect for it. You&#x27;ve got yesterday, today, and tomorrow all in the same room, and there&#x27;s very little you can&#x27;t imagine not happening&quot;. Richard F. Thomas, Professor of the Classics at Harvard University, has written that Dylan has been &quot;characteristically vague&quot; on the use of any specific painting techniques emulated while he was writing the words for the songs on &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot;. According to novelist Ron Rosenbaum, Dylan told him that he&#x27;d written &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; after spending a weekend listening to Joni Mitchell&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Blue&quot;.

Dylan first recorded &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; in New York City on 16 September 1974 during the initial &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; sessions at A&amp;R Studios. Eight takes were recorded in New York from 16 to 19 September, mostly featuring Tony Brown on bass alongside Dylan on guitar and harmonica, and containing some minor variations in lyrics, as well as differences in vocal delivery, and tempo. Two of the versions later released on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks (Deluxe edition)&quot; also include Paul Griffin on organ. That December, working from a suggestion from his brother that the album should have a more commercial sound, Dylan re-recorded half the songs on &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, including &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; on 30 December at Sound 80 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

David Zimmerman was the producer for the Minneapolis &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; recordings, but was not credited on the album. The re-recorded versions were radical departures from the original recordings, and each new recording included changes to the lyrics from the earlier versions. This recording featured a full band: Kevin Odegard (guitar), Chris Weber (guitar) Gregg Inhofer (keyboards), Billy Peterson (bass), and Bill Berg (drums), with Dylan singing, and on guitar and harmonica. These musicians were based locally and had arrived at Zimmerman&#x27;s invitation, and Dylan had not met them before they started working together on 27 December.

The Minneapolis version was included as the opening track on &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, released on 20 January 1975, and in February as a single backed with &quot;If You See Her, Say Hello&quot;. The single reached number 31 on the Hot 100 chart. Outtakes of &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; from the New York sessions were released in 1991 on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot; and in 2018 on the single-CD and 2-LP versions of &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks&quot;, while the complete New York sessions were released on the deluxe edition of the latter album. The deluxe version of &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 14&quot; also included a remix of the December 1974 master issued on &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;.

== Composition and lyrical interpretation ==

With &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot;, Dylan used shifting perspectives of time, influenced by his recent studies under Raeben. Michael Gray describes the structure of &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&#x27;s&quot; lyrics as the story of a love affair and career and how the &quot;past upon present, public upon privacy, distance upon friendship, [and] disintegration upon love&quot; transform and are complicated over time. Timothy Hampton, Professor of Comparative Literature and French at the University of California, Berkeley, has described the structure of the lyrics as a set of sonnets, with seven stanzas each of 14 lines, each with a volta after line eight.

Dylan continually re-worked the lyrics and arrangement even after the album was released. During his 1978 World Tour, the line starting &quot;She opened up a book of poems&quot; became &quot;She opened up the Bible and started quotin&#x27; it to me&quot;, becoming one of the first public indicators of Dylan&#x27;s conversion to Christianity. The version released on &quot;Real Live&quot;, as performed throughout his 1984 Europe tour, differs radically in structure and lyrics from earlier versions, with a more cynical view of romance. Dylan said in 1985 that he was more satisfied with the implementation of multiple viewpoints in the song than he had been with the original. Dylan has often stated that the song took &quot;ten years to live and two years to write&quot;.

In a 1985 interview with Bill Flanagan, Dylan said that although many people thought that the album &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; was autobiographical, &quot;It didn&#x27;t pertain to me. It was just a concept of putting in images that defy time – yesterday, today and tomorrow. I wanted to make them all connect in some kind of a strange way.&quot; In his 2004 memoir &quot;&quot;, Dylan claimed that &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; was &quot;an entire album based on Chekhov short stories. Critics thought it was autobiographical – that was fine.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; regarded &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; as Dylan&#x27;s most powerful and most commercial single in a long time, saying that Dylan&#x27;s voice and the &quot;strong acoustic background&quot; instrumentals were reminiscent of Dylan&#x27;s early songs. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it is a &quot;great tune...with lyrics pouring forth in profusion and with Bob&#x27;s voice in excellent shape.&quot; Jon Landau in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised Dylan&#x27;s lyrics and delivery of the song, but was unimpressed by the accompanying musicians and the production of the album, while Jonathan Cott, in the same issue of the magazine, called the track &quot;brilliant and haunted.&quot; Cott likened the effect of the album&#x27;s lyrics to those of the Italian 13th century poem referred to in the song, quoting from the song:

Some commentators have taken the reference in &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; to the &quot;Italian poet/From the thirteenth century&quot; as a reference to Dante. Matthew Collins of Harvard, noting that Dylan may not have been precise with dates, argues that there are similarities between elements of the lyrics of &quot;Tangled up in Blue&quot; and the fifth canto of Dante&#x27;s 14th Century&quot; Inferno&quot;, but finds it unlikely that Dylan will ever confirm who the reference in the song is to. Hampton, however, believes that the reference is more likely to Petrarch. Both Collins and Hampton note that in a 1978 interview, in reference to &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot;, Dylan was asked who the poet was and replied &quot;Plutarch. Is that his name?&quot;

Don Stanley in &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; said that the song &quot;succeeds on the strength of its metaphors.&quot; An opposing view was expressed by Al Rudis, in &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot;, who was unimpressed by the song&#x27;s lyrics, calling the track &quot;a long lurching song [but with] no build-up of cumulative power&quot; and stating that it contains &quot;seemingly meaningless images.&quot; Neil McCormick remarked in 2003 that the song is &quot;A truly extraordinary epic of the personal, an unreliable narrative carved out of shifting memories like a five-and-a-half-minute musical Proust.&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; has described the song as &quot;The most dazzling lyric ever written, an abstract narrative of relationships told in an amorphous blend of first and third person, rolling past, present and future together, spilling out in tripping cadences and audacious internal rhymes, ripe with sharply turned images and observations and filled with a painfully desperate longing.&quot;

Jim Beviglia ranks &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; 14th in his 2013 assessment of the 100 best Dylan songs, saying that &quot;this masterful song doesn&#x27;t skimp on the pain.&quot; In a 2020 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis ranked it the twelfth-greatest of Dylan&#x27;s songs. The track was ranked 3rd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 2016 ranking of the 100 greatest Dylan songs, with the staff describing it as &quot;where emotional truths meet the everlasting comfort of the American folk song.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 68 on their 2011 list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and re-ranked it at No. 67 in 2021. A 2021 &quot;Guardian&quot; article included it on a list of &quot;80 Bob Dylan songs everyone should know&quot;.

==Live performances==
Dylan has performed the song live 1,685 times up to August 2018. The first was on 13 November 1975 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum, New Haven.
 The most recent live performance as of October 2020 was on 28 August 2018 at Horncastle Arena, Christchurch, New Zealand.

Dylan played the song solo on acoustic guitar during the first leg of the Rolling Thunder Revue tour in 1975, a performance of which is featured in Dylan&#x27;s 1978 film &quot;Renaldo and Clara&quot; and which later became the song&#x27;s official music video. On the second leg of the Rolling Thunder Revue, in 1976, the song was performed with a full band in what Clinton Heylin has called a &quot;gear-crunching heavy-metal&quot; arrangement. The 1978 World Tour performances were slower, with a big band. After 1978, the next live performances were in 1984, again solo on acoustic guitar but this time with radically reworked lyrics. Versions performed after 1984 have been closer to the original.

Mary Lee&#x27;s Corvette covered the entire &quot;Blood on The Tracks&quot; album in 2002, including &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot;. According to Hootie &amp; the Blowfish vocalist Darius Rucker, their song &quot;Only Wanna Be with You&quot; was written as a tribute to Dylan; it includes the lines &quot;Put on a little Dylan sitting on a fence,&quot; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Bobby so cool?&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m tangled up in blue.&quot;

The song is a playable track on &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;, as the most difficult song in the vocal section, and the final song for the player to complete in the &quot;Impossible Vocal Challenge&quot;. &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; is also published as one of two poems by Dylan in &quot;The Seagull Book of Poems.&quot; Dylan reworked the lyrics again for an artwork, consisting of handwritten lyrics and a sketch of an abandoned car, displayed at the Halcyon Gallery&#x27;s &quot;Mondo Scripto&quot; exhibition in 2018.

<text>Melanesian Meriam people are an Indigenous Australian group of Torres Strait Islander people who are united by a common language, strong ties of kinship and live as skilled hunter–fisher–gatherers in family groups or clans on a number of inner eastern Torres Strait Islands including &quot;Mer&quot; or Murray Island, &quot;Ugar&quot; or Stephen Island and &quot;Erub&quot; or Darnley Island. The Meriam people are perhaps best known for their involvement in the High Court of Australia&#x27;s Mabo decision which fundamentally changed land law in Australia - recognising native title.

Although gardening takes priority, each Meriam family has sea rights, and on the reefs in front of their houses, which are mainly built above the beach, they maintain stone fish-weirs and crayfish holes.

Melanesian Meriam people primarily reside in a small island of volcanic origin situated at the eastern end of the Torres Strait, known as Mer (Murray) Island. The Murray group also comprises two other islands, Erub (Darnely) and Ugar (Stephens) Islands in which traditional laws of boundary and ownership organise them. The three islands are considered as the Meriam cluster. While these Islands predominantly contain Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who associate as Meriam people, each Island differs in their population and demographics. Mer homes eight tribes of the Meriam people, which have been around for thousands of years. These include:

* Komet
* Zagareb
* Meauram
* Magaram
* Geuram
* Peibre
* Meriam-samsep
* Piadram
* Dauer Meriam
Table 1. Data collected from ABS (2016)

Mer and Erub Island both have a large population hence ABS data regarding demographics is available on the two islands, Ugar Island only comprises a small population of 85 people. Hence not much ABS data is available. All that is known as of the 2016 ABS census is that there are 60.7% males and 39.3% females with the median age of 19 comprising the Ugar Island.

== Culture ==
Meriam people have a distinct culture from other Torres Strait Islander groups. Indigenous cultural groups rituals and practices are characterised by their beliefs in the Dreamtime and mythologies. Meriam people differ from other Indigenous groups as many of their rituals are surrounded by their engagement in agriculture and farming. Hence Meriam people place great focus on enhancing individual garden productivity. Therefore, common with all Indigenous groups, the younger generation learn from their elders, hence Meriam fathers pass down their techniques of gardening cultivation to their sons which would be carried on throughout future generations. During certain ceremonies such as deaths, marriages and adoption ceremonies excess produce would be made available for exchange to sustain those engaged in the cultural rituals.

=== Totems ===
Totems are important in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture, as they are commonly adopted as a family or clan emblem used to maintain and continue connections with Indigenous land, the Dreamtime and their ancestors. These totems play great significance from the moment an Indigenous child is born, as at the time of birth a child is given a totem in order to connect them to their physical and kin relatedness. Each Indigenous clan has different totems which are unique to them in their own ways.

A shared totem among all eight Meriam tribes is a shark. This totem arises from a story in which a father and son got lost while hunting and waited for sharks to rescue them. Therefore, sharks are seen as a totem animal who would protect the Meriam people and not attack them. It is forbidden for men (who usually would hunt prior to European colonisation) to hunt sharks as they are seen as animals who would not harm the Meriam people.

While individual clan&#x27;s totems arise from stories, over time these stories have been lost as elders have been unable to communicate them to younger generations due to past policies that separated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However, the following totems are known for the following tribes of the Mer people:

* Komet, totems include sardine and mangrove
* Zagareb, totems include seagull and Torres Strait pigeon
* Meauram, totems include turtle
* Magaram, totems include whale and snake
* Geuram, totems include whale, snake and dove
* Peibrem totems include mantaray  
* Meriam-samsep, totems include tiger shark, Torres Strait pigeon and driftwood totems
* Piadram, totems include tiger shark, Torres Strait pigeon, driftwood and whale
* Dauer Meriam totem includes Tagai constellation

=== Mythology/ Cosmogony ===
The stories told by elders to the younger generations allow for the transgenerational learning of the Meriam culture. Some of the stories explain why certain rituals or practices are important in Indigenous clans.

Torres Strait Islanders in particular the Mer people are seafarers, sea country was used as a place for gardening, hunting, fishing, ceremonies, art, music, dance and storytelling. The story of Nageg (pronounced Nar-gegg) and Geigi (pronounced Gay-gee) explains the importance of sea country. It explains how Nageg and Geigi, a mother and son became known as triggerfish and trevally, through a creation story of the Tig Dowareb Clan of Murray Island. The story begins with Geigi, the son disguising himself as a kingfish among many sardines to fool an old man who would hunt for sardines. When the old man notices he is being fooled he takes Geigi disguised as the kingfish home one night for dinner and eats him, falling asleep soon after under a tree. Nageg, the mother cuts open the old man and takes Geigi out demanding him to live in the ocean to break the spears of those who try to spear him eventually becoming trevally. Whereas Geigi demands Nageg to live on the rock cave on the reef piercing anyone with her fin if they try to catch her, becoming triggerfish.

The Gelam story explains the creations of the three islands – Mer, Waier and Dauar of the Murray group, which resulted due to Gelam&#x27;s mother&#x27;s trickery and Gelam&#x27;s lies. Gelam was a boy who lived in Moa Island in the Torres Strait, he was known for his skilful hunting. The story begins by Gelam purposely keeping the fat birds he would hunt for himself and giving his mother the lean birds. After his mother noticed this, she decided to scare him one day while he was hunting by dressing up as a dogai by covering herself in mud, this worked and successfully scared Gelam as he ran home frightened. However, Gelam realised his mother played a trick on him as he noticed the residue of mud under her eyes when he reached home, this caused Gelam to leave his home, he gathered fruits, seeds and soils and set off in the canoe he carved himself. Gelam reached the Great Barrier Reef, where it is said today if you fly to the Torres Strait over Central Islands some of the reefs look like Gelam&#x27;s tears from when he was leaving his home crying. This journey eventually led to the creation of three islands – Mer, Waier and Dauar.

=== Religion ===
Christianity is the most common religion preached on the Murray, Ugar and Erub Islands, with Anglicanism and Pentecostalism being the most populated sectors. Christianity has influenced Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander spirituality, as a result of past policies such as segregation and assimilation policies which separated Indigenous people from their families restricting them from practicing their spiritual beliefs, and instead raising them with Christian values. As a result, many Indigenous Australians are Christian today. However Indigenous spirituality and Christian spirituality can peacefully coexist in Indigenous people&#x27;s lives, particularly for the Meriam people.

As quoted by an elder of Murray Island, &quot;culture is very important…culture is identity&quot; and &quot;religion is very important…God taught spirit and wisdom&quot;. Meriam people both express their cultural identity through their dreamtime stories and rituals, while still valuing their religion. Christianity was also easily accepted by the Meriam people because before religion the Mer people would follow the rule of Malo, which has principles and structure similar to Christianity.

=== Traditions ===
A significant tradition of the Meriam people that still remains significant today despite the influence of European colonisation is Meriam people&#x27;s death rites. In the death rituals and customs of Meriam people of the Murray Island, bright meteors play an important role which relate to spiritual elements of death rites.

Maier, the name given to bright meteors is symbolic as it not only informs observers about the passing of a person in their community it also enables spirits of the dead to communicate with those alive. Maier therefore informs people about their life, social status and follows as a warning to follow traditional customs, while representing the dead or dying person&#x27;s spirit. The brightness, colour and trajectory of the Maier further informs the observer about characteristics of the person and their life. The knowledge and meaning behind Maier&#x27;s are passed down through oral tradition, such as storytelling and material culture as it is significant in serving as a means of culture

== Mabo case ==
The Meriam people are most commonly known for their contribution to Native Title, which recognised their rights to their land and overturned the expanded doctrine of &quot;terra nullius&quot; as applicable to domestic law. The five Meriam people who contributed to this were Eddie Koiki Mabo, Reverend David Passi, Sam Passi, James Rice and Celuia Mapo Sale.

The Mabo case began on 20 May 1982 primarily led by Eddie Mabo and the four other mentioned Meriam people. On 3 June 1992 &quot;terra nullius&quot; was overturned and native title was recognised by the High Court, recognising the Meriam people were entitled to all rights and use of the Murray Islands.

The Murray Island returning to the traditional owners (Meriam people) is significant for Meriam people, as prior to European contact they had a strong sense of connection to their islands, seas and reefs surrounding them. Hence being stripped of this not only resulted in loss of traditions but also a loss of kinship ties.

Mabo and the four other Meriam people&#x27;s contribution were significant to rekindling their connection to the land, and as a result Meriam people celebrate the High Court&#x27;s ruling of the Native Title every June third, paying tribute to Mabo. The Mer people gather together performing dances, prayers and feast to acknowledge the achievements of the applicants.

<text>Don Richard Perata (born April 30, 1945) is a California lobbyist and former Democratic politician, who was President pro tempore of the California State Senate from 2004 to 2008. He came in second place in the November 2010 election for Mayor of Oakland.

Perata worked with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to gain passage of five infrastructure related bond measures in 2006. Prior to serving in the State Senate, Perata served in the California State Assembly, as a member of the Board of Supervisors of Alameda County, and as a high school teacher.

==Background==
Born in Alameda, California, Perata is the son of Italian immigrants. During his childhood, he helped his father, Dick, to deliver milk door-to-door for the Lakehurst Creamery in Alameda. Perata graduated from Saint Joseph High School and earned his degree from Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California. He taught English, History, and Civics from 1966 to 1981 in Alameda County schools. Perata has a daughter and a son.

==Alameda County politics==
Perata began his political career when he ran for Mayor of Alameda in 1975 but was narrowly defeated. In 1986 he was elected to the Alameda County Board of Supervisors and was re-elected to a second term. As Supervisor, Perata worked to shut down problematic liquor stores, ban cigarette advertising, and lobbied the state legislature for an assault weapons ban and funding for the mentally ill.

==Rise to the California State Senate==
Having served eight years representing Oakland as an Alameda County Supervisor, Perata&#x27;s first attempt at state politics came in the 1994 democratic primary for controller, aged 49. He was unsuccessful, capturing 27.27% of the vote. Afterwards, Perata served as a staff assistant for then Senate Pro Tem Bill Lockyer. In 1996, Perata was elected as a California State Assemblyman for the Oakland, Alameda, and Piedmont district.

In 1998, Perata ran for the State Senate for the 9th District which currently includes Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Castro Valley, Dublin, El Sobrante, Emeryville, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, Richmond, and San Pablo.

Perata&#x27;s run (and election) to the State Senate in 1998 was part of a series of five special elections that were held in the East Bay within less than 12 months, as Perata and other East Bay politicians vied for different political offices. For a detailed account of events, see Special election musical chairs.

Don Perata was selected by his peers in the California Democratic Party to lead the party in the California State Senate in 2004, becoming the California State Senate President Pro Tempore and leader of Senate. The position is the highest-ranking leader and most powerful member of the Senate.
The state Democratic Party re-elected Perata as President pro Tem until his retirement from the State Senate in 2008.

==California State Senate==
Perata is a staunch advocate of gun control. In 1999, Perata successfully drove legislation that updated the California &quot;assault weapons&quot; ban by adding a ban of generically described semi-automatic firearms. He obtained a concealed weapons permit to legally carry a loaded handgun in public. He claimed this was necessary for self-defense due to threats on his life and the well-being of his family from some individual opponents of his pro-gun control legislative activity.

Perata has been an advocate for the rights of the elderly, the mentally ill, and the disabled. He supported legislation to create a discount drug program and legislation to require HMOs to pay for mental health treatment. He supported legislation that secured $27 million annually for ovarian and prostate cancer and legislation that increase access to breast cancer screening for low-income women. He has authored legislation requiring California utilities companies to contract for cleaner energy sources and supported tougher penalties on oil refinery emissions.

In early 2005, Perata introduced a bill to repair California&#x27;s flagging infrastructure including highway improvements, housing reform and levee repairs. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger began to speak out in favor of improving state infrastructure after Schawarzenegger&#x27;s November 2005 special election ballot initiatives were defeated. While Schwarzenegger&#x27;s plan included fixing transportation problems, his infrastructure plan was drastically more costly and advocated more prisons and did not address the housing problem.

In a rare occurrence for Sacramento politicians, in early 2006 Perata and Schwarzenegger began to work together to piece together a bipartisan infrastructure plan that both sides of the legislature could embrace. They were successful and five bond measures were approved by California voters on the November 2006 ballot. These measures are aimed at improving roads, mass transit, affordable housing, levee repair, and upgrading educational facilities.

In July 2007, during state budget negotiations, Perata ordered the Senate to remain in session for 19 hours in an attempt to reach an agreement on the budget. California requires two-thirds of both legislative houses and the governor&#x27;s signature to pass a budget. Perata needed two Republican votes in the State Senate to pass the budget and the lock down aimed to get those two Republican votes. The California State Senate Republicans presented a revised budget that aimed to reduce state spending and included tax credits to some Fortune 500 corporations, cuts to transportation and welfare, and eliminating cost-of-living pay raises to the blind, elderly, and disabled.

The state budget had already gained the required two-thirds majority in the California Assembly and the support of Governor Schwarzenegger. Perata and the Senate Democrats rejected the Senate Republican budget proposal and the Republicans held out for weeks into August, preventing many state legislators from returning home for their summer recess, before the budget was passed. Perata retaliated against Republican Jeff Denham for voting against the budget by stripping Denham of committee assignments and contributing to a recall effort against Denham.

Perata&#x27;s concluded about the Capitol: &quot;There is no center. I&#x27;m not talking about political center. There is no action center, or moral center, or anything else left in Sacramento.&quot;

In an April interview, Perata reflected on the value of the legislation passed by the State Legislature under his leadership as President pro tempore of the California State Senate: &quot;Almost everything I wanted to do in Sacramento that was beneficial to the state—whether it was on gun control or infant mortality—was twice as beneficial to my district. In many instances, my role was to get it done; I didn&#x27;t have the need to take or get the credit, just results.&quot;

==Post-Senate==
Proposition 93, a term limit alteration ballot measure sponsored by Perata and Assembly Speaker Fabian Núñez, did not pass in February 2008. Perata termed out of the State Senate (and Núñez termed out of the State Assembly) in 2008. The proposition would have allowed Perata to serve one more term in the State Senate (and Núñez three more terms in the State Assembly). Perata was a target for criticism by the opposition to Proposition 93. One television ad included the following line: &quot;Don Perata, whose home was raided by the FBI in the ongoing corruption probe.&quot;

Perata filed a &quot;statement of intention&quot; to run for the California Board of Equalization in 2010, but instead decided to run for Mayor of Oakland after incumbent Ron Dellums declined to run for re-election.

In the November 2010 election, Perata ran for Mayor in a field of nine candidates. The two other major contenders were City Council members Jean Quan and Rebecca Kaplan. He led in first-place balloting, but came in second place following winner Quan after taking into account ranked choice balloting (instant runoff).

Perata was also the co-chair of a California campaign committee to pass the California Cancer Research Act, 2012&#x27;s Proposition 29 a ballot measure that was defeated by California voters on June 5, 2012. If it would have passed, the measure was projected to generate over $500 million annually for cancer research by levying a new $1-per-pack tax on tobacco products in California. Revenues would have also been spent on smoking-cessation programs, and tobacco law-enforcement.

==Political controversy==
In early 2004, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that Perata&#x27;s friend and associate, Timothy G. Staples, had received $313,000 in business from political campaigns initiated or supported by Perata. At the same time, Staples had paid Perata $100,000 per year in consulting fees that supplement Perata&#x27;s Senate salary, according to financial records and interviews with the senator. After this disclosure The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights sent a letter to the Senate stating that Perata&#x27;s payments for consulting work looked &quot;like a complex and illegal money-laundering mechanism.&quot;

That same week the Senate Ethics Committee began an investigation into the matter, but dropped it the following month concluding that the dealings did not violate the Senate&#x27;s standards of conduct or conflict-of-interest rules. Later that same month the &quot;Chronicle&quot; reported on another dealing by the Senator. Since 1999, Perata&#x27;s campaign fund and various other political committees had paid Exit Strategies more than $743,000, according to campaign finance documents. Exit Strategies, a political direct mail firm, was launched in 1999 by Perata&#x27;s son, Nick, and based at his father&#x27;s Alameda County home. By their own accounting, Exit Strategies paid the senator nearly $138,000 during the same period for rent and consulting fees. The Senate Ethics Committee again ruled that this was not an actionable violation, but it raised questions into the propriety of the relationship.

Additional stories by &quot;The Chronicle&quot; during this time insinuated that Perata had carried a bill on behalf of Mercury Insurance, which may have allowed the company to circumvent Prop. 103. Mercury, in turn, donated $50,000 to a political committee run by Oakland developer Phil Tagami, who later hired Staples, who had previously paid Perata as a consultant.

In early November 2004, Perata became the official target of a probe by the Justice Department under Republican President, George W. Bush. The FBI, the US Attorney&#x27;s Office, and a federal grand jury investigated whether Perata took bribes or kickbacks from friends and campaign donors in exchange for his help.

That same year, Perata was also criticized when he described as &quot;crackers&quot; - a disparaging slang term for poor Southern whites - some San Diego-area residents who stridently opposed a bill to give illegal immigrants the ability to obtain driver&#x27;s licenses.

In May 2007, the East Bay Express, an alternative weekly in the Bay Area, published a two-part investigation of Perata. The articles suggested that between 1998 and 2007, Perata spent more than $1 million of campaign cash on parties and high-end lifestyle expenditures, amounting to more than one-quarter of the total he raised for his reelection campaigns in that time. The same free publication also alleged that Perata had manipulated liberal causes, such as antiwar sentiment, for his own political ends. and had used campaign donations to support his lavish lifestyle.

The FBI investigation lasted five years. No arrests or indictments occurred, and in early 2009, Justice Department officials closed the case and announced they would not be filing any charges.

<text>Haim &quot;Kidoni&quot; Bar-Lev (; 16 November 1924 – 7 May 1994) was a military officer during Israel&#x27;s pre-state and early statehood eras and later a government minister.

==Biography==
Born Haim Brotzlewsky in Vienna and raised in Zagreb, Bar-Lev made aliyah to Mandate Palestine in 1939. From 1942 through 1948, Bar-Lev served in various Jewish military units, such as the Palmach. He became both a pilot and a parachutist, which would later serve him in developing both of these military branches in the young Israel Defense Forces.

In 1946, Bar-Lev blew up the Allenby Bridge near Jericho to prevent Arab militiamen in Trans-Jordan from entering Jewish towns west of the Jordan River. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Bar-Lev was the commander of the Eighth Battalion (Mechanized) in the Negev Brigade, which fought in the southern part of the country and the Sinai.

During the 1956 Suez Crisis he commanded the 27th Armored Brigade, which captured the Gaza Strip before turning southwest and reaching the Suez Canal. By 1964 he became of Director of Operations within the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

During the June 1967 Six-Day War he served as the Deputy Chief of Staff in the IDF. Israeli Chief of Staff General Chaim Bar-Lev initiated the construction of defensive structures along the Canal, despite advice from several seasoned commanders. However, Israeli commanders did not prioritize determining whether the &#x27;Bar-Lev Line&#x27; served as merely a &#x27;trip-wire&#x27;, as later asserted, or constituted a comprehensive defensive barrier. 

Between 1968 and 1971, Bar-Lev served as IDF&#x27;s Chief of General Staff, which made him the highest-ranking military officer.

During the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, although retired from the IDF and serving as the Minister of Trade and Industry, he was recalled by Prime Minister Golda Meir back into military service to replace Shmuel &quot;Gorodish&quot; Gonen as chief of the Southern Command, which defended the Sinai Peninsula. Bar-Lev played a pivotal role in the war. Before his appointment the Southern front was in disarray to the point of near total collapse and Gonen was proving unable to effectively control the situation. Bar-Lev immediately took charge and worked towards stabilizing the front. His political and negotiating skills also proved instrumental in controlling his field generals who were feuding amongst themselves since each had their own notions, sometimes competing ones, regarding how the war in the South should be carried out. The effect that Bar-Lev&#x27;s arrival had on the chaotic Southern command headquarters was described by Gonen&#x27;s deputy, Uri Ben-Ari, in testimony to the Israeli military&#x27;s historical department:

Bar-Lev brought calmness on all of us. Finally there was a feeling that we had a real commander in charge. This feeling spread between us and later also in the battlefield radios like fire. Bar-Lev also managed to calm Gorodish down. Prior to his arrival, general staff meetings were one loud shout out of Gorodish&#x27;s mouth. Bar Lev instituted orderly working routines. No one challenged his authority. The country owes much to him. &quot;Dvelah&quot; went back to being a real war-room, a compartmentalized one. No one [who did not belong there] was allowed entry. Serenity descended on the war room. The general staff officers switched to carrying out their tasks in well organized shifts. Even Arik [Ariel Sharon]&#x27;s tone of voice changed when Bar Lev arrived.

===Political career===
Bar-Lev remained Minister of Trade and Industry until the Alignment government was defeated and replaced by the Likud under the leadership of Menachem Begin following the 1977 elections, in which Bar-Lev was elected to the Knesset for the first time. Between 1977 and 1984 he served as General Secretary of the Labor Party, the largest faction in the Alignment. When the Alignment joined the national unity governments that held office between 1984 and 1990, Bar-Lev served as Minister of Police and as a member of the &quot;inner cabinet&quot;. He retired from the Knesset at the time of the 1992 elections, and was appointed ambassador to Russia, serving until 1994.

He died in Tel Aviv on 7 May 1994.

His son Omer Bar-Lev is an Israeli politician member of the Labor Party.

<doc id="1258156" wikidata="Q6759687" url="?curid=1258156" title="Margaret Marland">
<text>Margaret Marland (born February 15, 1934) is a former Canadian politician in Ontario. She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 2003, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris.

==Background==
Marland worked as a bank accountant and dental assistant in private life. She began her political career as a school trustee, serving on the Peel Board of Education from 1974 to 1978. From 1978 to 1985, she served as Mississauga City Councillor for Ward 2. She was also a member of the board of governors for the Oakville-Trafalgar Hospital, and served as governor of Sheridan College.

==Politics==
Marland was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1985 provincial election, defeating her Liberal opponent by about 1,500 votes in the traditionally Conservative riding of Mississauga South. The Tories won a minority government in this election, but were defeated in the house shortly thereafter; Marland held a number of critic&#x27;s positions in opposition. Marland supported Larry Grossman for the party leadership in late 1985 (&quot;Toronto Star&quot;, 6 November 1985).

In the provincial election of 1987, she defeated Liberal candidate Claudette MacKay-Lassonde by only 599 votes to retain her seat. The Tories were reduced to only 17 seats out of 130 in this election. In early 1990, Marland was named deputy house leader of her party.

Marland was re-elected by a significant majority in the election of 1990, in which the Tories increased their standing to 20 seats. She again held a number of critic&#x27;s roles in opposition.

The Tories won a majority government in the provincial election of 1995, and Marland was re-elected by a landslide in Mississauga South. She was not immediately appointed to cabinet by Mike Harris, and was defeated by Al McLean in her bid to become Speaker of the legislature. She was subsequently named chair of the Progressive Conservative caucus in recognition of her parliamentary experience.

When McLean was forced to resign in disgrace in 1996, Marland was Harris&#x27;s choice to be his replacement; the legislature, however, elected Chris Stockwell to the position. On October 10, 1997, Marland was named a Minister without Portfolio in Harris&#x27;s government with responsibility for Children. She was easily re-elected in the 1999 provincial election, and was dropped from cabinet on February 7, 2001.

Although known as a strong regional representative, Marland was not a major player in the Harris government, and was not brought back into cabinet by Ernie Eves when he replaced Harris as leader in 2002.

Marland was favoured to be re-elected in the provincial election of 2003, but lost to Liberal Tim Peterson by only 234 votes in a Liberal sweep of the Mississauga area.

==After politics==
Since her defeat, she has kept largely a low profile, but made a statement critical of Tim Peterson&#x27;s automatic installation as PC candidate after he crossed the floor, saying that it was &quot;despicable the way this has been dealt with.&quot;

<text>Triple M Newcastle (call sign: 2KKO) is an Australian radio station, licensed to, and serving Newcastle and surrounds. It broadcasts at 102.9 megahertz on the FM band from its studios in Newcastle. It is owned by Southern Cross Austereo.

==History==
The station commenced operations on 1 August 1931 as 2KO, based in the Newcastle suburb of KOtara, hence the call-sign. Founded by Allen Fairhall, 2KO was licensed to The Newcastle Broadcasting Company. The station broadcast on 1415 kHz with a transmission strength of 25 watts. The station launched from the backyard of a resident&#x27;s home, with the licensee&#x27;s dining room being the only studio the station had at the time. Programs ran from 7 to 10 p.m., later moving into daytime programming.

Two years later in 1933, the station moved its AM transmitter to Sandgate, and was operated from several locations including 72 Hunter Street, Newcastle until January 1937, when new studios and offices in the heart of Newcastle in the CML Building at 110 Hunter Street. In its time on the AM band, the station had its power increased twice, first to 2,000 watts, and then to 5,000 watts, using a directional aerial system.

In the days before television, peak listening time was around 8pm, but with television arriving in the country in the late 1950s, the station had to change formats to survive the new medium. This was even more the case when 2KO&#x27;s owners at the time, United Broadcasting Company (who also owned Sydney&#x27;s 2UE), itself owned by the local Lamb family, was part of the consortium that brought television to Newcastle, launching NBN Television on channel 3 in 1962.

These changes led to 2KO becoming a Top 40 music radio station. This took the audience by storm, and helped re-established radio as the personal medium.

Until 1978 there was a 10 kHz gap between radio stations. However, the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 changed this to a 9 kHz gap, thus allowing more stations on the AM band. Therefore, on 23 November 1978, most Australian stations changed their frequencies and 2K0 went from 1410 kHz to 1413 kHz.

In May 1988, 2KO moved to facilities at 252 Pacific Highway, Charlestown.
KOFM / NXFM use MAESTRO for music play out &amp; Automation after network programs until live assist. By 1989 it was owned by Wesgo.

On 12 October 1992, 2KO converted to the FM band, changing its callsign to 2KKO, and branding itself as &quot;KOFM 102.9&quot;. Four years later, on 22 January 1996, the parent company of KOFM was purchased by Austereo. A few more years later, Austereo sold 50% to RG Capital, whose stake in the station then transferred in 2004 to Macquarie Regional RadioWorks, upon the purchase of RG Capital&#x27;s stations. In April 2011 Southern Cross Media bought out Austereo giving Southern Cross Media full ownership of KOFM.

In late June 2017, the station again moved but this time to state of the art facilities in 18 Honeysuckle Drive.

On 9 November 2018, KOFM was renamed to Triple M Newcastle.

===Rugby League coverage===
Following Broadcast Operations Group&#x27;s decision not to carry the &quot;Continuous Call Team&quot; from 2GB in Sydney, and therefore, ruling that rival 2HD could not carry Newcastle Knights games, KOFM picked up the program (and rights to Knights games), beginning 2006. KOFM also poached long time 2HD commentator Gary Harley continued his role as commentator on Knights games until dismissal early 2014. Triple M no longer carries 2GB&#x27;s coverage anymore due to Triple M Sydney&#x27;s successful bid for NRL broadcast rights (but broadcast Knights games with local content).

<text>María Julia &quot;Maju&quot; Mantilla García (born 10 July 1984) is a Peruvian actress, dancer, model, teacher and beauty queen who won Miss World 2004 in China.

==Early life==
Born in Trujillo, Mantilla is the youngest of the seven sons of Olmedo Lucio Mantilla Mayer and the youngest of Elvia Elizabeth García Linares two daughters. She was studying to become a high school teacher and planned to start a second degree in Tourism. One of her dreams was to own an online tourism company to promote her native town and country all over the world. Her city, Trujillo, is a mixture of colonial and pre-Columbian architecture.

In 2001, Mantilla became the Peruvian national champion of Triathlon and Pentathlon, and was elected national athlete of the year. She is a professional dancer in &quot;The Marinera&quot;, a typical local dance. With a group of ladies, she developed a program in Trujillo to give breakfast to hundreds of children in poor areas. She is a professional dancer.

==Miss Peru==
In 2004, she was Miss La Libertad and won the right to represent Peru in the Miss World contest and was one of the major favorites in the run-up to the pageant, which was decided by a global television/telephone/online vote. Popularly known in her country as &quot;Maju&quot; Mantilla, her aunt María Julia Mantilla Mayer was Miss Peru 1969.

==Miss World 2004==
On 4 December 2004, in the Beauty Crown Theatre located in the Chinese beach city of Sanya, she was crowned Miss World 2004 by the winner from the year before, Rosanna Davison of Ireland, becoming the second winner from Peru since Madeline Hartog-Bel in 1967. 

Mantilla was a record breaker for Peru during the competition, and was among the semifinalists in three fast track events. In Miss World Sports, she tied for third place with Kenisha Thom of Trinidad and Tobago. In Miss World Talent, she was among the Top 25 semifinalists with a traditional Peruvian dance, &quot;The Marinera Norteña&quot;. And finally, in Contestants&#x27; Choice, she placed second runner-up.

Claudia Cruz of Dominican Republic and Nancy Randall of the United States were the first and second runners-up, respectively. Other contestants who made it into the final five were 20-year-old Karla Bautista of the Philippines, and 19-year-old Katarzyna Borowicz of Poland.

During her reign, Mantilla performed a variety of duties focused on fundraising for charitable organizations. She traveled to Indonesia, Russia, Peru, United States, Czech Republic, China, Tibet, Ireland, United Kingdom and many other countries during her reign.

On 10 December 2005, she crowned her successor, Unnur Vilhjálmsdóttir of Iceland.

<text>Hit106.9 (call sign: 2XXX) is a commercial FM radio station broadcasting in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, on a frequency of 106.9 MHz, and is part of Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s Hit Network. 

==History==

Hit106.9&#x27;s history can be traced back to Singleton radio station 2SI, owned by Alex Mather (VK2JZ) and the Singleton Argus newspaper which never went to air. The licence was obtained by Hunter River Broadcasters Pty Ltd and changed to 2HR. The station launched on 30 August 1937. Shareholders included the &quot;Singleton Argus&quot; and the Robinson Family. Three years later, the station was moved to Maitland, with transmitter at Lochinvar.

In those days, 2HR operated on 680 kHz with 300 watts of power, and was affiliated with the Macquarie Broadcasting Network. Programs were originated locally between 6:30 am and 6:30 pm, before taking the Macquarie feed at 6:30 pm.

In the 1950s, 2HR was relocated to Newcastle, with its transmitter located in Bolwarra. Station manager Ken Robinson was a former Australian Army officer, and his identification number had the letters NX. Therefore, the station was given the callsign 2NX, and a new frequency at 1360 kHz .

In 1971, 2NX&#x27;s owners Hunter Broadcasters were purchased by the Catholic Broadcasting Company, owned by the Catholic Church. 2NX programming still was relayed to 2NM overnight during this time, and was identified as &quot;2NXNM&quot;.

In the early 1990s, the Catholic Church sold 2NX to Radio Newcastle, which was later taken over by Austereo, and then sold a 50% stake to RG Capital (which was taken over by Macquarie Bank). 2NX was granted a license to convert to FM in the 1990s and moved to 106.9 MHz, branding itself originally as X107, before changing to NXFM. In April 2011 Southern Cross Media bought out Austereo giving Southern Cross Media full ownership of NXFM.

On 15 December 2016, NXFM became known as hit106.9 in Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s mass re-branding of its regional radio network.

Hit 106.9 are a sponsor of local A-League team the Newcastle Jets.

<doc id="1258170" wikidata="Q126579" url="?curid=1258170" title="Stansted Mountfitchet">
<text>Stansted Mountfitchet is an English village and civil parish in Uttlesford district, Essex, near the Hertfordshire border, north of London. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 5,533, increasing to 6,011 at the 2011 census. By the 2021 census it had increased to 8,621. The village is served by Stansted Mountfitchet railway station.

Stansted Mountfitchet is situated in north-west Essex near the Hertfordshire border and 3 miles (5 km) north of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. Stansted Airport is from the village. The village has three primary schools (Bentfield Primary School, St Mary&#x27;s (C of E) Primary School and Magna Carta Primary Academy) and one high school which was renamed the Forest Hall School in September, 2013.

==History==
Stansted was a Saxon settlement (the name means &#x27;stony place&#x27; in Anglo-Saxon) that predates the Norman conquest. In the 1086 Domesday Book, Stansted was in the ancient hundred of Uttlesford. It was one of many villages and manors controlled by the powerful Robert Gernon de Montfichet (from Montfiquet in Calvados, Normandy). His elder son was William de Montfichet. By 1290, Stansted began to be referred to as Stansted Mountfitchet to differentiate it from Stansted, Kent. A small remnant of his castle remains, around which a reconstruction of an early Norman castle has been built. Believed to have been fortified originally in the Iron Age, and subsequently by the Romans and Vikings, construction of the Norman castle began in 1066. Lord Mountfitchet is also considered the 11th century builder of Montfichet&#x27;s Tower in London.

St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, built in the 1120s, is a redundant church under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The brick west tower was added in 1692. A chapel of ease dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist was built in 1889 nearer the centre of the village and is now the village church. Stansted Hall was built in 1871 by William Fuller Maitland (d. 1876).

==Landmarks==

Other village attractions include the House on the Hill Toy Museum, which its owners claim &quot;is the largest toy museum in the World&quot;. Located next to Mountfitchet Castle and Norman Village of 1066, both attractions are owned by Alan Goldsmith. The museum opened in 1991 and holds over 80,000 toys, mostly from the 1950s to the 1990s. A working windmill built in 1787 is in the village, and is open to the public once a month.

During the Second World War, the US Air Force constructed an airfield near the village. After the war ended, it was subsequently taken over by the government and developed as a commercial airport. Today, London Stansted Airport is accessible by road from Junction 8 of the M11 motorway, near Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and direct by train from London Liverpool Street.

==Economy==
In March 2013, Stansted Mountfitchet was named as the UK&#x27;s fourth most internet-friendly town. The Google eTown Awards recognise the top places where businesses are most actively embracing the web and Stansted&#x27;s high ranking reflects the increased use of the internet to spur economic growth. The results put Stansted in fourth place behind Richmond, in third, Edinburgh, in second, and Stratford upon Avon, which took the top spot.

Titan Airways has its head office in Enterprise House on the property of Stansted Airport. Several defunct airlines had their head offices on the Stansted property. AirUK (later KLM uk) had its head office in Stansted House. Buzz had its head office in Endeavour House. AB Airlines had its head office in Enterprise House. Lloyd International Airways had its head office at Lloyd House. Go Fly had its head office at Enterprise House.

Until it merged with Lastminute.com in 2006, Travelocity.co.uk had its headquarters in Stansted Mountfitchet and employed around 60 Essex and Hertfordshire locals. The office closed in the early part of 2006 and Travelocity.co.uk formally came under the umbrella of Lastminute.com, which has offices in London and Woking, Surrey.

==Sport and leisure==
Non-League football club Stansted F.C. (winners of the FA Vase in 1983-84) play at the Hargrave Park sports ground in the village and there is also a cricket club based at the ground.

<text>Astrogliosis (also known as astrocytosis or referred to as reactive astrogliosis) is an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons from central nervous system (CNS) trauma, infection, ischemia, stroke, autoimmune responses or neurodegenerative disease. In healthy neural tissue, astrocytes play critical roles in energy provision, regulation of blood flow, homeostasis of extracellular fluid, homeostasis of ions and transmitters, regulation of synapse function and synaptic remodeling. Astrogliosis changes the molecular expression and morphology of astrocytes, in response to infection for example, in severe cases causing glial scar formation that may inhibit axon regeneration.

== Causes ==
Reactive astrogliosis is a spectrum of changes in astrocytes that occur in response to all forms of CNS injury and disease. Changes due to reactive astrogliosis vary with the severity of the CNS insult along a graduated continuum of progressive alterations in molecular expression, progressive cellular hypertrophy, proliferation and scar formation.

Insults to neurons in the central nervous system caused by infection, trauma, ischemia, stroke, recurring seizures, autoimmune responses, or other neurodegenerative diseases may cause reactive astrocytes.

When the astrogliosis is pathological itself, instead of a normal response to a pathological problem, it is referred to as astrocytopathy.

== Functions and effects ==
Reactive astrocytes may benefit or harm surrounding neural and non-neural cells. They undergo a series of changes that may alter astrocyte activities through gain or loss of functions lending to neural protection and repair, glial scarring, and regulation of CNS inflammation.

=== Neural protection and repair ===
Proliferating reactive astrocytes are critical to scar formation and function to reduce the spread and persistence of inflammatory cells, to maintain the repair of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), to decrease tissue damage and lesion size, and to decrease neuronal loss and demyelination.

Reactive astrocytes defend against oxidative stress through glutathione production and have the responsibility of protecting CNS cells from NH4+ toxicity.
They protect CNS cells and tissue through various methods, such as uptake of potentially excitotoxic glutamate, adenosine release, and degradation of amyloid β peptides. The repair of a disruption in the blood brain barrier is also facilitated by reactive astrocytes by their direct endfeet processes interacting with blood vessel walls that induce blood brain barrier properties.

They have also been shown to reduce vasogenic edema after trauma, stroke, or obstructive hydrocephalus.

=== Scar formation ===

Proliferating reactive scar-forming astrocytes are consistently found along borders between healthy tissues and pockets of damaged tissue and inflammatory cells. This is usually found after a rapid, locally triggered inflammatory response to acute traumatic injury in the spinal cord and brain. In its extreme form, reactive astrogliosis can lead to the appearance of newly proliferated astrocytes and scar formation in response to severe tissue damage or inflammation.

Molecular triggers that lead to this scar formation include epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), endothelin 1 and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mature astrocytes can re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate during scar formation. Some proliferating reactive astrocytes can derive from NG2 progenitor cells in the local parenchyma from ependymal cell progenitors after injury or stroke. There are also multipotent progenitors in subependymal tissue that express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and generate progeny cells that migrate towards sites of injury after trauma or stroke.

=== Regulation of inflammation ===
Reactive astrocytes are related to the normal function of astrocytes. Astrocytes are involved in the complex regulation of CNS inflammation that is likely to be context-dependent and regulated by multimodal extra- and intracellular signaling events. They have the capacity to make different types of molecules with either pro- or anti-inflammatory potential in response to different types of stimulation. Astrocytes interact extensively with microglia and play a key role in CNS inflammation. Reactive astrocytes can then lead to abnormal function of astrocytes and affect their regulation and response to inflammation.

Pertaining to anti-inflammatory effects, reactive scar-forming astrocytes help reduce the spread of inflammatory cells during locally initiated inflammatory responses to traumatic injury or during peripherally-initiated adaptive immune responses. In regard to pro-inflammatory potential, certain molecules in astrocytes are associated with an increase in inflammation after traumatic injury.

At early stages after insults, astrocytes not only activate inflammation, but also form potent cell migration barriers over time. These barriers mark areas where intense inflammation is needed and restrict the spread of inflammatory cells and infectious agents to nearby healthy tissue. CNS injury responses have favored mechanisms that keep small injuries uninfected. Inhibition of the migration of inflammatory cells and infectious agents have led to the accidental byproduct of axon regeneration inhibition, owing to the redundancy between migration cues across cell types.

== Biological mechanisms ==

Changes resulting from astrogliosis are regulated in a context-specific manner by specific signaling events that have the potential to modify both the nature and degree of these changes. Under different conditions of stimulation, astrocytes can produce intercellular effector molecules that alter the expression of molecules in cellular activities of cell structure, energy metabolism, intracellular signaling, and membrane transporters and pumps. Reactive astrocytes respond according to different signals and impact neuronal function. Molecular mediators are released by neurons, microglia, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, endothelia, leukocytes, and other astrocytes in the CNS tissue in response to insults ranging from subtle cellular perturbations to intense tissue injury. The resulting effects can range from blood flow regulation to provision of energy to synaptic function and neural plasticity.

===Signaling molecules===

Few of the known signaling molecules and their effects are understood in the context of reactive astrocytes responding to different degrees of insult.

Upregulation of GFAP, which is induced by FGF, TGFB, and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), is a classic marker for reactive gliosis. Axon regeneration does not occur in areas with an increase in GFAP and vimentin. Paradoxically, an increase in GFAP production is also specific to the minimization of the lesion size and reduction in the risk for autoimmune encephalomyelitis and stroke.

===Transporters and channels===
The presence of astrocyte glutamate transporters is associated with a reduced number of seizures and diminished neurodegeneration whereas the astrocyte gap junction protein Cx43 contributes to the neuroprotective effect of preconditioning to hypoxia. In addition, AQP4, an astrocyte water channel, plays a crucial role in cytotoxic edema and aggravate outcome after stroke.

== Neurological pathologies ==

Loss or disturbance of functions normally performed by astrocytes or reactive astrocytes during the process of reactive astrogliosis has the potential to underlie neural dysfunction and pathology in various conditions including trauma, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and others. Some of the examples are as follows:

* Autoimmune destruction of astrocyte endfeet that contact and envelop blood vessels is associated with CNS inflammation and a form of multiple sclerosis
* Rasmussen&#x27;s syndrome autoantibody destruction of astrocytes causes seizures
* In Alexander&#x27;s disease, a dominant, gain-of-function mutation of the gene encoding GFAP is associated with macro-encephalopathy, seizures, psychomotor disturbances, and premature death.
* In a familial form of amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a dominant gain-of-function mutation of the gene encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD) leads to production of reactive astrocytes of molecules that are toxic to motor neurons.

Reactive astrocytes may also be stimulated by specific signaling cascades to gain detrimental effects such as the following:
* Exacerbation of inflammation via cytokine production
* Production and release of neurotoxic levels of reactive oxygen species
* Release of potentially excitotoxic glutamate
* The potential contribution to seizure genesis
* Compromise of blood–brain barrier function as a result of vascular endothelial growth factor production
* Cytotoxic edema during trauma and stroke through AQP4 overactivity
* Potential for chronic cytokine activation of astrocytes to contribute to chronic pain

Reactive astrocytes have the potential to promote neural toxicity via the generation cytotoxic molecules such as nitric oxide radicals and other reactive oxygen species, which may damage nearby neurons. Reactive astrocytes may also promote secondary degeneration after CNS injury.

== Novel therapeutic techniques ==
Due to the destructive effects of astrogliosis, which include altered molecular expression, release of inflammatory factors, astrocyte proliferation and neuronal dysfunction, researchers are currently searching for new ways to treat astrogliosis and neurodegenerative diseases. Various studies have shown the role of astrocytes in diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson&#x27;s, and Huntington&#x27;s. The inflammation caused by reactive astrogliosis augments many of these neurological diseases. Current studies are researching the possible benefits of inhibiting the inflammation caused by reactive gliosis in order to reduce its neurotoxic effects.

Neurotrophins are currently being researched as possible drugs for neuronal protection, as they have been shown to restore neuronal function. For example, a few studies have used nerve growth factors to regain some cholinergic function in patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s.

===Anti-gliosis function of BB14===
One specific drug candidate is BB14, which is a nerve growth factor-like peptide that acts as a TrkA agonist. BB14 was shown to reduce reactive astrogliosis following peripheral nerve injuries in rats by acting on DRG and PC12 cell differentiation. Although further research is needed, BB14 has the potential to treat a variety neurological diseases. Further research of neurotrophins could potentially lead to the development of a highly selective, potent, and small neurotrophin that targets reactive gliosis to alleviate some neurodegenerative diseases.

===Regulatory function of TGFB===
TGFB is a regulatory molecule involved in proteoglycan production. This production is increased in the presence of bFGF or Interleukin 1. An anti-TGFβ antibody may potentially reduce GFAP upregulation after CNS injuries, promoting axonal regeneration.

===Ethidium bromide treatment===
Injection of ethidium bromide kills all CNS glia (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes), but leaves axons, blood vessels, and macrophages unaffected. This provides an environment conducive to axonal regeneration for about four days. After four days, CNS glia reinvade the area of injection and axonal regeneration is consequently inhibited. This method has been shown to reduce glial scarring following CNS trauma.

===Metalloprotinease activity===
Oligodendrocyte precursor cells and C6 glioma cells produce metalloproteinase, which is shown to inactivate a type of inhibitory proteoglycan secreted by Schwann cells. Consequently, increased metalloproteinase in the environment around axons may facilitate axonal regeneration via degradation of inhibitory molecules due to increased proteolytic activity.

<text>The Wanganui River is in the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It flows northwest for from its headwaters in the Southern Alps, entering the Tasman Sea near Lake Ianthe, southwest of Hokitika.

After heavy rain in January 2013 the flooded river partially washed away the single-lane road bridge that carries , closing the only through road on the West Coast.

Gravel buildup has gradually raised the riverbed, and in 2021 the West Coast Regional Council planned to elevate stopbanks by 1 m at a cost of $5.7 million to protect neighbouring farmland from flooding. Farmers protested the rates rise that would be needed to pay back this 30-year loan, and suggested the Department of Conservation should contribute.

In March 2023, the river broke through a hole in the stopbank on the north side, and caused significant flooding damage to several farms.

In April 2023, a river engineer briefed local farmers, and outlined the history of development of stop banks on the river. In 1948, the river had a wide and natural braided river course. However, over a period of 60 years, stop banks were constructed along the original river bed to create pasture land. The result was that the river became increasing constrained, taking up only half of the area it previously occupied. The consequence is that the rate of aggradation has doubled. In the area downstream of the State Highway 6 bridge, the river now sits above the flood plain. The location where the river broke through the stop banks earlier in 2023 was the normal river bed in the 1960s. Construction of stop banks to narrow the river channel has also increased the gradient of the river bed, and increased the velocity of water flowing against the stop banks. Climate variability is producing more intense storms, and combined with the other factors, is increasing the threat of future breaches.

<text>The 43rd New Zealand Parliament was a term of the Parliament of New Zealand. Its composition was determined by the 1990 elections, and it sat until the 1993 elections.

The 43rd Parliament saw the beginning of the fourth National Party government, with the Labour Party failing to win a third term in office. The 43rd Parliament was heavily dominated by National, which controlled nearly seventy percent of the seats. Only one minor party, Jim Anderton&#x27;s NewLabour, was present at the beginning of the 43rd Parliament. Later, NewLabour would join with several unrepresented parties to form the Alliance, which would gain two additional seats when two National MPs defected. Another National MP, Winston Peters, would also break away from his party, becoming an independent.

The 43rd Parliament consisted of ninety-seven representatives, the same as the previous Parliament. All of these representatives were chosen by single-member geographical electorates, including four Māori electorates.

==Electoral boundaries for the 43rd Parliament==
==Overview of seats==
The table below shows the number of MPs in each party following the 1990 election and at dissolution:

Notes
* Jim Anderton, Leader of the NewLabour Party merged the party into the newly founded Alliance party.
*The Working Government majority is calculated as all Government MPs less all other parties.

==Initial composition of the 43rd Parliament==
==By-elections during 43rd Parliament==
There were a number of changes during the term of the 43rd Parliament.

===Summary of changes during term===
*Jim Anderton, the sole MP for the NewLabour Party, merged his party with several others to form the Alliance in 1991. Anderton was thereafter recorded as an Alliance MP rather than a NewLabour MP.
*Robert Muldoon, the National Party MP for Tamaki and a former Prime Minister of New Zealand, quit Parliament on 17 December 1991. His departure prompted a by-election in Tamaki early the following year — it was won by Clem Simich, also of the National Party.
*Gilbert Myles and Hamish MacIntyre, the National Party MPs for Roskill and Manawatu, respectively, quit their party in 1992. They established a small group Liberal Party, which they eventually merged into the Alliance.
*Fran Wilde, the Labour Party MP for Wellington Central, quit Parliament in 1992 to become Mayor of Wellington. Her departure prompted a by-election in Wellington Central in December — it was won by Chris Laidlaw, also of the Labour Party.
*Cam Campion, the National Party MP for Wanganui, announced his resignation from the party on 3 March 1993. He accused the party of attempting to rig the reselection process against him. Campion remained an independent for the remainder of the term.
*Winston Peters, the National Party MP for Tauranga, resigned from both his party and his seat on 18 March 1993. His departure prompted a by-election in Tauranga in April — Peters contested and won it as an independent candidate. Later, he would found the New Zealand First party.
*Myles left the Alliance to join Peters in New Zealand First.

<text>The Mitsubishi Sirius or 4G6/4D6 engine is the name of one of Mitsubishi Motors&#x27; four series of inline-four automobile engines, along with Astron, Orion, and Saturn.

The 4G6 gasoline engines were the favoured performance variant for Mitsubishi. The &quot;4G61T&quot; powered their Colt Turbo, while the &quot;4G63T&quot;, first introduced in the 1980 Lancer EX 2000 Turbo, went on to see service in the Sapporo and Starion coupés during the so-called &quot;turbo era&quot; of the 1980s, before creating for itself an illustrious motorsport heritage as the powerplant under the hood of the World Rally Championship-winning Lancer Evolution. A UK-market Evo known as the FQ400 had a version of the &quot;Sirius&quot;, making it the most powerful car ever sold by Mitsubishi.

The 4D6 diesel engines supplemented the larger [[Mitsubishi Astron engine|4D5]]. Bore pitch is 93 mm.

==4G61 (1.6 liters)==
The 4G61 displaces with bore/ full length stroke of . This engine was always DOHC 16-valve and used either Multi-point (MPFI) or Electronic Control (ECFI) fuel injection. A turbocharged version was also produced for the Mirage and Lancer. Unlike the other Sirius motors, the 4G61 does not have balance shafts.

===Performance===
* 4G61 at 6100 rpm.
* 4G61T (USA/Canada only) at 6000 rpm and of torque at 3000 rpm.
* 4G61T (Japan, early) at 6000 rpm and of torque at 2500 rpm.
 (late) at 6000 rpm and of torque at 2500 rpm.

===Applications===
* 1988–1992 Mitsubishi Mirage / Mitsubishi Colt (MPFI)
* 1988–1992 Dodge Colt / Plymouth Colt
* 1988–1992 Eagle Summit
* 1992–1995 Hyundai Elantra
==4G62 (1.8 liters)==
The larger 1.8 L 4G62 was an SOHC 8-valve unit for longitudinal rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive use. With a bore and stroke of , it displaces . It was available either in carburetor form, multi-point fuel injection, or ECI Turbo as found in the Lancer EX 1800GSR or 1800GT, and Cordia GSR.

===Applications===
* 1980–1987 Mitsubishi Lancer EX 1800GSR or 1800GT (A175A)
* 1981–1986 Mitsubishi Delica/L300/Express
* 1983–1987 Mitsubishi Chariot HR
* 1983–1989 Mitsubishi Cordia
* 1983–1989 Mitsubishi Tredia
* 1984–1988 Mitsubishi Galant/Eterna

===4G62T===
Turbocharged version of the 4G62

== 4G63/G63B (2.0 liters) ==

The 4G63 was a version.

Bore x stroke is SOHC and DOHC were produced. Both versions were available in either naturally aspirated and turbocharged form. For front-wheel drive applications, the turbocharged Sirius&#x27; name was changed to &quot;Cyclone Dash&quot;. As fitted to the fifth generation Galant JIS gross were claimed — the output claims later shrank to — for the turbocharged and intercooled &quot;Sirius Dash 3x2 valve&quot; engine. This version could switch between breathing through two or three valves per cylinder, to combine high top-end power with low-end drivability as well as allowing for economical operation. It was a modification of Mitsubishi MCA-Jet technology which used a secondary intake valve to inject air into the engine for more efficient emissions control. The DOHC version was introduced in 1987 in the Japanese market Galant, and came in turbocharged or naturally aspirated form. It is found in various models including the 1988-92 Mitsubishi Galant VR-4, the U.S. market 1990-1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse, and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution I-IX. Later versions also received Mitsubishi&#x27;s variable valve timing system, MIVEC.

A SOHC carbureted eight-valve version (engine code G63B) was also available in Mitsubishi&#x27;s pickup trucks (L200, Strada, Mighty Max, Dodge Ram 50) from the eighties until the mid-nineties. It produces at 5500 rpm in European trim (1989). The SOHC version was also used in Mitsubishi Galant models until 1993. It has of output and of torque at 4,750 rpm.
Also, a SOHC version was produced until the late 90s and early 2000s and was used in Mitsubishi cars like the Montero and the 2.0 L 2-door Pajero with an output of at 4700 rpm. Also the N33 and N83 Space Wagons and Galant (UK market) received the 4G63, in single-cam sixteen-valve format. A similar version, with , was also used in some light duty Mitsubishi Canters from 1997 on.

The Mitsubishi Eclipse, Eagle Talon and Plymouth Laser introduced the DOHC turbocharged intercooled version to the U.S. in 1989 through Diamond Star Motors, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Motors and the Chrysler Corporation. From 1990 to late April 1992 came thicker connecting rods and the use of six bolts to secure the flywheel to the crankshaft; May 1992 to 2006 Evolution versions have lighter rods and use seven bolts to secure the flywheel to the crankshaft. They are referred to as the &quot;six bolt&quot; and &quot;seven bolt&quot; engines, respectively.

Output for the 2003 US Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is at 6500 rpm with of torque at 3500 rpm. It has a cast iron engine block and aluminium DOHC cylinder head. It uses multi-point fuel injection, has four valves per cylinder, is turbocharged and intercooled and features forged steel connecting rods. 
The final version of the engine was found in Lancer Evolution IX. It was equipped with Mitsubishi&#x27;s variable valve timing system, MIVEC. This version also had a revised turbocharger, extended reach spark plugs, two-piece rings.

A SOHC 16 valve turbocharged version called 4G63S4T is produced by Shenyang Aerospace Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing (SAME) in Shenyang, China, producing a peak power of and a peak torque of for most applications, and rated in some applications. This version is equipped with a TD04 turbocharger.

===Racing===
Its turbocharged variant, 4G63T (also sometimes referred to simply as the 4G63), has powered Mitsubishi vehicles in World Rally Championships (WRC) for years in the Lancer EX 2000 Turbo, Galant VR-4, Lancer Evolution, Carisma GT, and Lancer WRC04. It was the powerplant of the Lancer Evolution when Tommi Mäkinen won his four consecutive WRC championships in his Lancer. MHI and T-4 turbos were both used as power for these engines. A 1.7L variant of the 4G63 was also used in a custom made hill-climb a DDR Motorsport DDR Grullón GT4 made by Komvet Racing.

Known as the &quot;Sirius Diesel&quot;, the 4D65 has the same dimensions as the 4G62 . It was available either naturally aspirated or turbocharged (with an air-to-air intercooler), and was used in most Mitsubishi diesel passenger cars in the eighties and beginning of the nineties. It was developed specifically to be transversally installed in front-wheel-drive cars, unlike the preceding 4D5-series which remained in production for commercial vehicles. The 1.8 TD power figures are comparable to those of the 22 percent larger, 2.3 liter 4D55, with more low-down torque and while being much smoother. The cast-iron block was typical for Mitsubishi, but unusual for diesel engines, in being equipped with balance shafts. A number of installations combined this engine with four-wheel-drive.

<text>&quot;Lamkin&quot;, &quot;Lambkin&quot;, &quot;Long Lankin&quot;, or &quot;Bolakins&quot; () is an English-language ballad. It gives an account of the murder of a woman and her infant son by a man, in some versions, a disgruntled mason, in others, a devil, bogeyman or a motiveless villain. Versions of the ballad are found in Scotland, England and the US.

According to Roud and Bishop (2012): 
&quot;Lambkin&quot; is not one of the major league Child ballads in terms of popularity, but it was widely known in England and Scotland, and even more so in North America. ... The central character&#x27;s name varies considerably, including, in just the English versions &#x27;Lambkin&#x27;, &#x27;Lamkin&#x27;, &#x27;Lincoln&#x27;, and &#x27;Limkin&#x27;, and he is various referred to as &#x27;Long&#x27;, &#x27;Bold&#x27;, &#x27;Cruel&#x27; and &#x27;False&#x27;.
They cite the analysis of Anne Gilchrist, who identified two threads: one Scottish, which retained the mason narrative; one Northumbrian, which lost the mason in early versions, thus encouraging singers to supply a different back-story. Versions collected in England stem from the Northumbrian thread.

==A bogeyman==
Other versions follow the same basic story, but the antagonist has many different names, among them &quot;Long Lonkin&quot;, &quot;Balankin&quot;, &quot;Lambert Linkin&quot;, &quot;Rankin&quot;, &quot;Long Lankyn&quot;, and &quot;Lammikin&quot;. Later versions lose the opening of the story, which explains that Lamkin is a mason who has not been paid; in these, Lamkin becomes a sort of a bogeyman who dwells in the wild places; the lord, before leaving, warns against him:

:Says milord to milady as he mounted his horse,
:&quot;Beware of Long Lankin that lives in the moss.&quot;
:Says milord to milady as he went on his way,
:&quot;Beware of Long Lankin that lives in the hay.&quot;

These versions add peculiar incidents that add to the grisliness of the crime. Lamkin and the nursemaid collect the baby&#x27;s blood in a basin which, along with the idea that the name Lamkin or Lammikin indicates the murderer was pale skinned and, therefore, perhaps a leper who sought to cure himself by bathing in the blood of an innocent collected in a silver bowl, a medieval cure.

==In literature==
The ballad, as &quot;Long Lonkin&quot;, was taken from a friend by Letitia Elizabeth Landon and published in her &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1835.&quot;

The song was referenced in the title of the short story collection, &quot;Long Lankin&quot;, by John Banville. The American poet Robert Lowell also referenced the song in the title of his Pulitzer Prize-winning collection of poetry &quot;Lord Weary&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1946). The song inspired the young-adult novel &quot;Long Lankin&quot; (2011) by Lindsey Barraclough.

A sadistic character named Lankin appears as a member of the Fairy Queen&#x27;s court in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;.

Long Lankin appears in Jane Yolen and Midori Snyder&#x27;s book &quot;Except The Queen&quot;.

<text>The Christmas shearwater or aoū (Puffinus nativitatis) is a medium-sized shearwater of the tropical Central Pacific. It is a poorly known species due to its remote nesting habits, and it has not been extensively studied at sea either.

It is one member of a very ancient lineage of the small &quot;Puffinus&quot; species. Its only close living relative is the Galápagos shearwater (&quot;P. subalaris&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The species was described and given its current binomial name by the American naturalist Thomas Hale Streets in 1877. A genetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA has shown that the closest living relative is the Galápagos shearwater (&quot;Puffinus subalaris&quot;).

==Description==
The Christmas shearwater is a slender-bodied shearwater, about 36 cm long, with a wingspan of around 75 cm, and weighs around 350 g. It has dark plumage all over, generally blackish-grey with a rusty-brown tinge, slightly paler on the underside of the bird, and with some small edging of white under the chin and pale fringes to the upperwing coverts. It has brown-grey feet and a dark bill and eyes. Both sexes are alike, as are the young after fledging. Nestlings are covered in dark grey down feathers.

The species closely resembles the sooty (&quot;Puffinus griseus&quot;) and short-tailed shearwaters (&quot;P. tenuirostris&quot;), but has dark brown underwings and is smaller. The short tail of the Christmas shearwater does not appear blunt except when spread, but in flight usually tapers to a point, enhanced by the feet which protrude beyond the tail-tip. It often flies in a leisurely way like the related Procellariidae, and thus can be mistaken for a petrel. In particular, it can appear similar to the extremely rare Fiji petrel (&quot;Pseudobulweria macgillivrayi&quot;), a gadfly petrel-like relative of the shearwaters. The two species share a similar morphology and colouration, but the bulbous head and rather thin long bill – typical for shearwaters – distinguish &quot;P. nativitatis&quot; from the slim-headed thick-billed Fiji petrel.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Christmas shearwater nests on remote islands of the Central Pacific: the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Tuamotu, the Marshall Islands, Kiritimati (for which the species is named) and Sala-y-Gómez. It has become locally extinct on a number of islands, including Wake Island. Outside of the breeding season it ranges across the Pacific, having been recorded off the coast of Mexico and Guatemala in the east, and Bonin Islands in the west. Further south it is rare, having been recorded off Fiji only twice (one time in early to mid-May).

==Behaviour==
===Diet and feeding===

Like its relatives it feeds at sea, predominantly on squid, and fish, mostly flying fish (Exocoetidae) and goatfish (Mullidae). It is highly pelagic and is dependent on predatory fish such as tuna driving prey to the surface. As mentioned above, it does not only have the dramatic stiff-winged &quot;shearing&quot; (dynamic soaring) flight technique which gave the shearwaters their common name. In addition to it, it may use the plesiomorphic flight technique of petrels and similar Procellariidae, moving about with slow, leisurely wingbeats.

===Breeding===
The Christmas shearwater nests on sandy islands with good cover. It nests on the surface, underneath dense cover (such as naupakas, &quot;Scaevola&quot;), or under rock outcroppings. It lays one white egg, the timing of laying varying from island to island, on some islands breeding throughout the year. The egg is incubated for around 50 days. The time taken to fledge varies depending on the season, ranging from 60 to 100 days.

===Status and conservation===
Although few specific studies have been conducted on the Christmas shearwaters, petrels and shearwaters are threatened worldwide by fishing, ingestion of plastic waste, and habitat degradation. For example, on Laysan Island the introduced rabbits degraded the scrub cover, leaving adults, chicks and eggs vulnerable to overheating, and introduced black rats took eggs and chicks. In 1985, the population on Sala-y-Gómez, a nature sanctuary, was estimated at 5,000. With its wide range and considerable numbers, the Christmas shearwater is considered a species of least concern by the IUCN.

<text>Ashhurst () is a town and outlying suburb of Palmerston North, in the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island.

==Location==
Ashhurst is sited 14 kilometres northeast of the Palmerston North city centre. The town stands under the Ruahine Ranges, beneath Wharite Peak, which is the most notable peak on the south end of the Ruahine Range, upon which is the television and radio transmitter.

==Demographics==
Ashhurst covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Ashhurst had a population of 2,934 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 285 people (10.8%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 501 people (20.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,074 households, comprising 1,428 males and 1,506 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.95 males per female. The median age was 35.9 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 726 people (24.7%) aged under 15 years, 492 (16.8%) aged 15 to 29, 1,320 (45.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 396 (13.5%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 89.0% European/Pākehā, 18.6% Māori, 3.1% Pacific peoples, 2.8% Asian, and 1.4% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 12.9, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 56.3% had no religion, 32.8% were Christian, 0.6% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.6% were Hindu, 0.1% were Buddhist and 1.4% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 384 (17.4%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 438 (19.8%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $34,300, compared with $31,800 nationally. 297 people (13.5%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,179 (53.4%) people were employed full-time, 294 (13.3%) were part-time, and 66 (3.0%) were unemployed.

==Transport==

Ashhurst&#x27;s importance stems from its location at the western end of the Manawatū Gorge. As such, it was close to the easiest road and rail link between the east and west coasts of the southern North Island. However, the Gorge has been closed since April 2017 and the road link to the east coast from Ashhurst is now via Saddle Road.

There are four buses on weekdays and one on Saturdays linking Palmerston North with Ashhurst.

<text>The Minorities Research Group (MRG) (est. 1963) was the first organisation to openly advocate the interests of lesbians in the United Kingdom. It was founded by four women who got together in response to an article that was published in the magazine &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;. The group published the &quot;Minorities Research Group Newsletter&quot;, and went on to publish its own lesbian magazine called &quot;Arena Three&quot; that provided a lifeline to remote lesbians around the country.

The aims of the MRG were quoted as to &quot;collaborate in research into the homosexual condition, especially as it concerns women; and to disseminate information to those genuinely in the quest of enlightenment&quot;. Esme Langley, one of the group&#x27;s key founders, was insistent that it should focus on research and be inclusive of heterosexuals and supportive of lesbian individuals. As well as lesbians, its members included social workers, psychiatrists and writers such as Iris Murdoch.

==The beginning==
MRG was founded by Esme Langley. She was the editor, and working with her on the magazine were Diana Chapman, Cynthia Reid, Julie Switsur and Patricia Dunkley.
The group was prompted by the article &quot;A quick look at lesbians&quot; by the journalist Dilys Rowe in late 1962. Although it would appear condemning in the present day, it discussed serious issues with interviews and quotations, and it prompted an interest in research into lesbian (and bisexual) lives. This research concept continued throughout the existence of the Minorities Research Group, which also provided a central point for formerly disparate individuals and information. Ultimately, the MRG provided education, support and opportunities to socialise for lesbians nationwide.

==In the media==
Many MRG members were also members of the Gateways club in Chelsea, London, which featured in the film &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot;. The &quot;Arena Three&quot; publication and the benefits of MRG membership were regularly promoted inside amongst its clientele and group meetings were sometimes held there.

Other group members were located through small classified advertisements placed in British newspapers such as &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. At first, many newspapers thought that their content was too offensive and refused to publish their adverts. The first to accept their adverts was &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in May 1964 after it ran an article on the MRG.

A further two articles were published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;News of the World&quot; later that year. This prompted a rush of enquiries and boosted membership from all over the country. Many of the members were married and had to get their husbands&#x27; written consent before they could join.

In 1964, Esme Langley was interviewed by a psychiatrist for a late night Welsh television program. Shortly afterwards a documentary was made for &quot;This Week&quot;, the first national British television program on lesbians. This was broadcast on 7 January 1965, which featured several MRG members.

Initially, the group had quite an impact on the press and on television which elevated the status of lesbians into something that could be discussed in ordinary society. Many women, including Esme Langley, volunteered to be interviewed and photographed for this purpose, risking loss of employment, abuse and loss of family connections.

In 1971 a third television program about lesbians was made by Brigid Segrave called &quot;The important thing is love&quot;. This program also featured eight women from the MRG and was considered important as it was the first time that the women faced the camera without their identities being hidden.

==Group politics==
At one of the group debates in August 1964, a record 70 women turned up to discuss &#x27;the freedom of dress&#x27;. This took place in a room above the Shakespeare&#x27;s Head in Carnaby Street. Many of the women had been objecting to some women wearing the &#x27;butch&#x27; attire of a suit and tie to meetings. This eventually led to long-term social divisions within the group where butch women became excluded.

The Shakespeare&#x27;s Head also had another function as the home of the MRG lending library and reading group. Much of the lesbian literature of the time was not available through book stores and public libraries, so the MRG library was an invaluable resource of largely donated books and publications. This library was eventually passed to lesbian social network Kenric in 1966.

The Minorities Research group had an active relationship with the American equivalent of the time period, Daughters of Bilitis.

Some of the MRG members wanted to steer away from research to improve the social aspects of the group. They went on to found the still running Kenric in 1965.

==&quot;Arena Three&quot;==
The Minorities Research Group was responsible for producing the monthly journal &quot;Arena Three&quot;, which was Britain&#x27;s first lesbian and bisexual women&#x27;s publication. This publication was produced from 1963 to 1972 and at its peak, it was distributed by mail order to approximately 500-600 subscribers. &quot;Arena Three&quot; was not available in the shops and was entirely funded by Esme Langley, some advertising and its subscribers.

&quot;Arena Three&quot; was largely written by the same group of women and was often accused of being too middle class. It graduated from a type-written newsletter to a full glossy magazine by 1971. Maureen Duffy and Jackie Forster became regular contributors. A recent review of the magazine by Brighton Ourstory describes its contents as including letters from women around the country discussing local dances, events and the gay and lesbian politics of the day.

==Esme Langley==
Esme Langley (1919–1992) was the founder, secretary and driving force of the Minorities Research Group. She was responsible for editing and producing the &quot;Mainland&quot; and &quot;Arena Three&quot; magazines. She also appeared in several early documentaries about lesbians, including &quot;The important thing is love&quot;, released in 1971.

Esme worked as a secretary and was working in the field of magazine publishing at the time when she started MRG. She raised her eldest son on her own without ever being married, which was an unusual thing to do at the time. In 1958 she wrote a semi-autobiographical book called &quot;Why Should I be Dismayed&quot; under the pseudonym of Ann Bruce, which describes her life from being in the A.T.S in occupied Germany to being a single parent and living in the conservative post Second World War era.

==The end==
After the legalisation of male homosexuality in the UK with the implementation of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 other more political organisations had appeared, such as the Campaign for Homosexual Equality which focuses on equal rights for all homosexuals. These superseded the objectives of Minorities Research Group and helped bring about its demise and evolution.

The MRG ended with the final issue of Arena Three, which was published in March 1972. Former group member Jackie Forster went on to start &quot;Sappho&quot; magazine and organisation in the same year. Jackie also went on to become an Executive member of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality and the Gay Liberation Front along with other former MRG members such as Maureen Duffy.

==Notable members==
* Jackie Forster was a broadcaster, an active member and wrote for &quot;Arena Three&quot;.
* Maureen Duffy wrote for &quot;Arena Three&quot; and wrote &quot;The Microcosm&quot;.
* Barbara Bell was the South Coast representative for MRG, as described in her biography &quot;Just Take Your Frock Off&quot;.

==Reference articles==
In summary, the article &quot;A Quick Look at Lesbians by Dilys Rowe&quot; (Winter 1962–1963) was based on an interview with three self-confessed &quot;homosexual women&quot; and a female doctor who specialised in marriage guidance. The article focused on the largely invisible lives of lesbians in society at the time and their relationships with their mother and father. It proposed that lesbians reported growing up in families where they had a weak father and a dominant mother and that they had failed to emotionally bond with their fathers during their formative years.

Following on from this, a research article that was compiled with the help of the Minorities Research Group was &quot;On the Genesis of Female Homosexuality by E. Bene&quot; for the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot;, September 1965, pp. 815–21. This included further research into the parental relationship by sampling 37 lesbians from the group and 80 married women. The results also pointed towards lesbians having a poor relationship with their fathers.

<text>A transposase is any of a class of enzymes capable of binding to the end of a transposon and catalysing its movement to another part of a genome, typically by a cut-and-paste mechanism or a replicative mechanism, in a process known as transposition. The word &quot;transposase&quot; was first coined by the individuals who cloned the enzyme required for transposition of the Tn3 transposon. The existence of transposons was postulated in the late 1940s by Barbara McClintock, who was studying the inheritance of maize, but the actual molecular basis for transposition was described by later groups. McClintock discovered that some segments of chromosomes changed their position, jumping between different loci or from one chromosome to another. The repositioning of these transposons (which coded for color) allowed other genes for pigment to be expressed. Transposition in maize causes changes in color; however, in other organisms, such as bacteria, it can cause antibiotic resistance. Transposition is also important in creating genetic diversity within species and generating adaptability to changing living conditions.

Transposases are classified under EC number EC 2.7.7. Genes encoding transposases are widespread in the genomes of most organisms and are the most abundant genes known. During the course of human evolution, as much as 40% of the human genome has moved around via methods such as transposition of transposons.

==Transposase Tn5==

Transposase (Tnp) Tn5 is a member of the RNase superfamily of proteins which includes retroviral integrases. Tn5 can be found in &quot;Shewanella&quot; and &quot;Escherichia&quot; bacteria. The transposon codes for antibiotic resistance to kanamycin and other aminoglycoside antibiotics.

Tn5 and other transposases are notably inactive. Because DNA transposition events are inherently mutagenic, the low activity of transposases is necessary to reduce the risk of causing a fatal mutation in the host, and thus eliminating the transposable element. One of the reasons Tn5 is so unreactive is because the N- and C-termini are located in relatively close proximity to one another and tend to inhibit each other. This was elucidated by the characterization of several mutations which resulted in hyperactive forms of transposases. One such mutation, L372P, is a mutation of amino acid 372 in the Tn5 transposase. This amino acid is generally a leucine residue in the middle of an alpha helix. When this leucine is replaced with a proline residue the alpha helix is broken, introducing a conformational change to the C-terminal domain, separating it from the N-terminal domain enough to promote higher activity of the protein. The transposition of a transposon often needs only three pieces: the transposon, the transposase enzyme, and the target DNA for the insertion of the transposon. This is the case with Tn5, which uses a cut-and-paste mechanism for moving around transposons.

Tn5 and most other transposases contain a DDE motif, which is the active site that catalyzes the movement of the transposon. Aspartate-97, aspartate-188, and glutamate-326 make up the active site, which is a triad of acidic residues. The DDE motif is said to coordinate divalent metal ions, most often magnesium and manganese, which are important in the catalytic reaction. Because transposase is incredibly inactive, the DDE region is mutated so that the transposase becomes hyperactive and catalyzes the movement of the transposon. The glutamate is transformed into an aspartate and the two aspartates into glutamates. Through this mutation, the study of Tn5 becomes possible, but some steps in the catalytic process are lost as a result.
There are several steps which catalyze the movement of the transposon, including Tnp binding, synapsis (the creation of a synaptic complex), cleavage, target capture, and strand transfer. Transposase then binds to the DNA strand and creates a clamp over the transposon end of the DNA and inserts into the active site. Once the transposase binds to the transposon, it produces a synaptic complex in which two transposases are bound in a cis/trans relationship with the transposon.

In cleavage, the magnesium ions activate oxygen from water molecules and expose them to nucleophilic attack. This allows the water molecules to nick the 3&#x27; strands on both ends and create a hairpin formation, which separates the transposon from the donor DNA. Next, the transposase moves the transposon to a suitable location. Not much is known about the target capture, although there is a sequence bias which has not yet been determined. After target capture, the transposase attacks the target DNA nine base pairs apart, resulting in the integration of the transposon into the target DNA.

As mentioned before, due to the mutations of the DDE, some steps of the process are lost—for example, when this experiment is performed &quot;in vitro&quot;, and SDS heat treatment denatures the transposase. However, it is still uncertain what happens to the transposase &quot;in vivo&quot;.

The study of transposase Tn5 is of general importance because of its similarities to HIV-1 and other retroviral diseases. By studying Tn5, much can also be discovered about other transposases and their activities.

Tn5 is utilized in genome sequencing by using the Tn5 to append sequencing adaptors and fragment the DNA in a single enzymatic reaction in 2010, reducing the time and input requirements over traditional next-generation sequencing library preparation. The Tn5-based strategy can simplify the library preparation protocol significantly and can even can be incorporated into the direct colony-PCR for large numbers of bacterial isolates with no obvious coverage bias. The main disadvantages are less control of fragmented size compared to enzymatic fragmentation and mechanical fragmentation, and a bias toward high G-C content. This means of library preparation is also used in the ATAC-seq technique.

==Sleeping Beauty transposase==
The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase is the recombinase that drives the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. SB transposase belongs to the DD[E/D] family of transposases, which in turn belong to a large superfamily of polynucleotidyl transferases that includes RNase H, RuvC Holliday resolvase, RAG proteins, and retroviral integrases. The SB system is used primarily in vertebrate animals for gene transfer, including gene therapy, and gene discovery. The engineered SB100X is an enzyme that directs the high levels of transposon integration.

==Tn7 transposon==

The Tn7 transposon is a mobile genetic element found in many prokaryotes such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (&quot;E. coli&quot;), and was first discovered as a DNA sequence in bacterial chromosomes and naturally occurring plasmids that encoded resistance to the antibiotics trimethoprim and streptomycin. Specifically classified as a transposable element (transposon), the sequence can duplicate and move itself within a genome by utilizing a self-encoded recombinase enzyme called a transposase, resulting in effects such as creating or reversing mutations and changing genome size. The Tn7 transposon has developed two mechanisms to promote its propagation among prokaryotes. Like many other bacterial transposons, Tn7 transposes at low-frequency and inserts into many different sites with little to no site-selectivity. Through this first pathway, Tn7 is preferentially directed into conjugable plasmids, which can be replicated and distributed between bacteria. However, Tn7 is unique in that it also transposes at high-frequency into a single specific site in bacterial chromosomes called attTn7. This specific sequence is an essential and highly conserved gene found in many strains of bacteria. However, the recombination is not deleterious to the host bacterium as Tn7 actually transposes downstream of the gene after recognizing it, resulting in a safe way to propagate the transposon without killing the host. This highly evolved and sophisticated target-site selection pathway suggests this pathway evolved to promote coexistence between the transposon and it host, as well as Tn7&#x27;s successful transmission into future generations of bacterium.

The Tn7 transposon is 14 kb long and codes for five enzymes. The ends of the DNA sequence consists of two segments that the Tn7 transposase interacts with during recombination. The left segment (Tn7-L) is 150 bp long and the right sequence (Tn7-R) is 90 bp long. Both ends of the transposon contain a series of 22 bp binding sites that the Tn7 transposase recognizes and binds to. Within the transposon are five discrete genes encoding for proteins that make up the transposition machinery. In addition, the transposon contains an integron, a DNA segment containing several cassettes of genes encoding for antibiotic-resistance.

The Tn7 transposon codes for five proteins: TnsA, TnsB, TnsC, TnsD, and TnsE. TnsA and TnsB interact together to form the Tn7 transposase enzyme TnsAB. The enzyme specifically recognizes and binds to the ends of the DNA sequence of the transposon, and excises it by introducing double-stranded DNA breaks to each end. The excised sequence is then inserted to another target DNA site. Much like other characterized transposons, the mechanism for Tn7 transposition involves cleavage of the 3&#x27; ends from the donating DNA by the TnsA protein of the TnsAB transposase. However, Tn7 is also uniquely cleaved near the 5&#x27; ends, about 5 bp from the 5&#x27; end towards the Tn7 transposon, by the TnsB protein of TnsAB. After the insertion of the transposon into the target DNA site, the 3&#x27; ends are covalently linked to the target DNA, but the 5 bp gaps are still present at the 5&#x27; ends. As a result, repair of these gaps leads to a further 5 bp duplication at the target site. The TnsC protein interacts with the transposase enzyme and the target DNA to promote the excision and insertion processes. The ability of TnsC to activate the transposase depends on its interaction with a target DNA along with its appropriate targeting protein, TnsD or TnsE. The TnsD and TnsE proteins are alternative target selectors that are also DNA binding activators that promote excision and insertion of Tn7. Their ability to interact with a particular target DNA is key to the target-site selection of Tn7. The proteins TnsA, TnsB, and TnsC thus form the core machinery of Tn7: TnsA and TnsB interact together to form the transposase, while TnsC functions as a regulator of the transposase&#x27;s activity, communicating between the transposase and TnsD and TnsE. When the TnsE protein interacts with the TnsABC core machinery, Tn7 preferentially directs insertions into conjugable plasmids. When the TnsD protein interacts with TnsABC, Tn7 preferentially directs insertions downstream into a single essential and highly conserved site in the bacterial chromosome. This site, attTn7, is specifically recognized by TnsD.

<text>Helmut Griem (6 April 1932 – 19 November 2004) was a German film, television and stage actor, and director.

==Biography==
Born in Hamburg, Griem was primarily a stage actor, appearing at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg, the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, the Burgtheater in Vienna, the Munich Kammerspiele, and finally in the Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz, also in Munich. 

Griem became well known to international audiences as the diabolic SS-officer Aschenbach in &quot;The Damned&quot;. His role in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972) as the wealthy bisexual Baron Maximilian von Heune is probably his best-known international performance.

Other performances include his work in &quot;The McKenzie Break&quot;, and &quot;Ludwig&quot; and &quot;Breakthrough&quot;. Among his many film and TV appearances was one in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Peter the Great&quot; as the Tsar&#x27;s lifelong friend and &quot;right hand&quot; &quot;Alexander Menshikov&quot;, alongside Maximilian Schell. He starred in the television mini-series &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Lieutenant&quot; directed by John Goldschmidt, adapted by Jack Rosenthal and based on the novel by the Hungarian-American playwright and author Maria Fagyas (1905–1985), for Channel 4 and ZDF.

Griem performed in many classic roles from both the German and English-language repertoire. Later in his career Griem turned to theatre direction, including &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot; by Eugene O&#x27;Neill. Before his death, he had planned to direct the Botho Strauss play, &quot;Die eine und die andere&quot; (&quot;This One and The Other&quot;). Griem twice won the Bambi Award: in 1961 and in 1976. 

He died in Munich in 2004, aged 72.

<doc id="1258226" wikidata="Q16014058" url="?curid=1258226" title="Jackie Forster">
<text>Jackie Forster (née Jacqueline Moir Mackenzie; 6 November 1926 – 10 October 1998) was an English news reporter, actress and lesbian rights activist.

== Early history ==
Forster&#x27;s father was a colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps and she spent her early years in British India. When she was six, she was sent to boarding school in Britain at Wycombe Abbey and then to St Leonards School in Fife. During the Second World War, she played lacrosse and field hockey for Scotland.

Forster became an actress and joined the Wilson Barrett repertory company in Edinburgh before moving to London in 1950. She attended the Arts Theatre Club was in various West End productions and films before developing a successful career as a TV presenter and news reporter under the name of Jacqueline MacKenzie.

In 1957 she was on a lecture tour in North America for part of the year and was in Savannah, Georgia, when she had her first lesbian affair. Despite this she married author Peter Forster in 1958, but the marriage was over within two years as she accepted her true sexual orientation. They divorced in 1962 and she went to live in Canada.

Of her early lesbian experiences, she said &quot;I didn&#x27;t see myself as being a lesbian, or her, because I didn&#x27;t look as I imagined they did, and nor did she. We weren&#x27;t short back and sides and natty gent&#x27;s suiting. I got the image from &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, like we all did. There were drug stores around the States, with these pulp books, lurid stories about lesbians who smoked cigars and had orgies with young girls. I thought, where are these women? We never met anyone we knew were lesbians. There were no other books that I found about lesbians, no films that we ever saw: nothing at all.&quot;

In 1964, Forster returned to Britain to work for Border Television; and then eventually moved in with a girlfriend and her children in London.

== Activism and legacy ==
In the 1960s Forster joined the Minorities Research Group and wrote for its journal &quot;Arena Three&quot;. She would also regularly promote the magazine in the Gateways club.

Later on, she came out publicly in 1969 when she joined the Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE) and went to serve on its executive committee. She was in the first Gay Pride march in the UK in August 1971.

In 1972 Forster was one of the founders of Sappho, which was a social group and one of the UK&#x27;s longest-running lesbian publications (&quot;Sappho&quot; magazine was published from 1972 to 1981, although the group continued to meet regularly for many more years). The Sappho group members used to meet in the Chepstow pub in Notting Hill and had speakers such as Maureen Duffy and Anna Raeburn.

After Sappho, Forster became a member of Greater London Council&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Committee.

From 1992 until her death in 1998 Forster was an active member of the Lesbian Archive and Information Centre management Committee (now part of the Glasgow Women&#x27;s Library). In 1997 a BBC film crew came to the archive to film her for a programme about her life which was to be part of &quot;The Day That Changed My Life&quot; series. Her work has made a huge impact on shaping the archive.

On 6 November 2017, Google Doodle commemorated her 91st birthday. On 26 February 2025, a rainbow plaque was unveiled at her former London home in Warwick Avenue.

<doc id="1258230" wikidata="Q4600993" url="?curid=1258230" title="2002–03 United States network television schedule">
<text>The following is the 2002–03 network television schedule for the six major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 2002 through June 2003. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 2001–02 season. All times are Eastern and Pacific, with certain exceptions, such as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

New series are highlighted in bold.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.
Other Legend
* Light blue indicates local programming.
* Gray indicates encore programming.
* Blue-gray indicates news programming.
* Light green indicates sporting events.
* Light Purple indicates movies. 
* Red indicates series being burned off and other scheduled programs, including specials.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. Also not included are stations affiliated with Pax TV, as its schedule is composed mainly of syndicated reruns although it also carried a limited schedule of first-run programs.

==Sunday==

NOTE: Fox was to have aired &quot;Oliver Beene&quot; and &quot;The Grubbs&quot; on Sundays at 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., respectively, but instead made last-minute changes by postponing &quot;Oliver Beene&quot; to the following spring and canceling &quot;The Grubbs&quot;. In their places, &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and reruns of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; were slotted.

==Monday==

==Tuesday==
NOTE: Grounded for Life was also originally scheduled to run on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. on Fox, but it was pulled after two new episodes in September, and one in early December. The show moved to The WB in the spring in 2003.

==Wednesday==
==Thursday==


NOTE: Movies, baseball games, reruns, and specials comprised most of the programming Thursday nights on Fox. &quot;Septuplets&quot; was supposed to air at 9-10, but it was cancelled at the last minute.

<text>Crédit Agricole () was a French professional cycling team managed by Roger Legeay. From 1998 to 2008, the team was sponsored by the French bank Crédit Agricole. Prior to 1997, the team was known as Vêtements Z–Peugeot (1987), Z–Peugeot (1988–89), Z (1990–92) and GAN (1993–98). In 1990, the team&#x27;s leading cyclist, the American Greg LeMond, won the Tour de France. The team also won the team title at the Tour de France that year. Crédit Agricole announced that they would cease to sponsor the team after 2008, and the team was subsequently disbanded.

== History ==
The team was born out of the Peugeot cycling team, which existed from the early 1900s to 1986. Roger Legeay was the Peugeot team&#x27;s last manager, and he created Vêtements Z–Peugeot in 1987 (taking its name from the children&#x27;s clothing brand Z and the car manufacturer Peugeot). That year, the team made its appearance at the Tour de France, with Frenchman Pascal Simon as its leading cyclist.

In 1988, under the name of Z–Peugeot, the team achieved its first stage win at the Tour de France when Jérôme Simon (Pascal Simon&#x27;s brother) won stage 9 of the tour. The team&#x27;s second stage win came in 1989, when the Scottish rider Robert Millar took a mountain stage.

In 1990, the Tour&#x27;s defending champion, Greg LeMond, moved to the team, which had been renamed Z. Riding for the team, LeMond won his third Tour title that year, coming in 2 minutes and 16 seconds ahead of the second-placed rider, the Italian Claudio Chiappucci. LeMond credited strong team support and tactics for his third Tour victory. And the team also won the team title at the year&#x27;s Tour, coming in just 16 seconds ahead of the ONCE cycling team (the closest margin for the team classification in the Tour&#x27;s history).
In 1991, with the team renamed simply Z, LeMond wore the yellow jersey for five stages in the earlier part of the Tour, but faded as the event progressed and eventually finished in seventh place, 13 minutes behind the new champion, the Spanish rider Miguel Induráin.

In 1992, LeMond struggled and eventually abandoned the Tour on the 14th stage. However the team picked up one stage win that year, with Jean-Claude Colotti winning stage 17.

In 1993, the team was renamed GAN. LeMond did not ride in the 1993 Tour. He returned in 1994, but withdrew after six stages.

Just prior to LeMond&#x27;s departure the team acquired the British track cyclist Chris Boardman, a time trial specialist. Riding for the team, Boardman won the Prologue of the Tour de France in 1994, 1997 and 1998.

The team also acquired a young Australian track rider, Stuart O&#x27;Grady, in the mid-1990s. He won several Tour stages and nearly won the points classification in the 2000 Tour de France. O&#x27;Grady held on to the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification for many days during that same tour.

The team was renamed Crédit Agricole in 1998.

German rider Jens Voigt joined the team until the 2003 season, winning a Tour stage and spending a day in the yellow jersey in 2001.
The 2000 and 2001 seasons saw Americans Bobby Julich and Jonathan Vaughters in the team, making it the team with the most English speakers. The team also won the 2001 Tour de France team time trial in front of the ONCE and U.S. Postal teams. Julich and Vaughters left after one and two seasons respectively.

The 2003 season saw the emergence of Thor Hushovd of Norway as the main sprinter of the team. At the end of 2003 O&#x27;Grady and Voigt left for Cofidis and Team CSC respectively.

2005 was successful for the team. Pietro Caucchioli finished in the top ten of the Giro d&#x27;Italia and Christophe Le Mével took a breakaway stage win. In the 2005 Tour de France Christophe Moreau was the highest-placed French rider (11th) and Thor Hushovd secured the green jersey points classification.

In 2006, Crédit Agricole captured the team classification at the Tour de Pologne. Hushovd took stage wins and two days in the yellow jersey at the Tour de France, won the Gent–Wevelgem classic, and a stage win and the points classification at the Vuelta a España.

From 2005 to 2008, the team was one of the 20 which competed in the UCI ProTour.

The team disbanded at the end of the 2008 season when Crédit Agricole ended their sponsorship.

<doc id="1258240" wikidata="Q1133743" url="?curid=1258240" title="Allied Democratic Forces">
<text>The Allied Democratic Forces (; abbreviated ADF) is a Ugandan Islamist rebel group based in western Uganda and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is considered a terrorist organisation by the Ugandan government and the United States. Originally based in western Uganda, it has expanded into the neighbouring Congo. Most ADF fighters are Ugandan Muslims from the Baganda and Basoga ethnic groups.

Since the late 1990s, the ADF has operated in the Congo&#x27;s North Kivu province near the border with Uganda. While repeated military offensives against the ADF have severely affected it, the ADF has been able to regenerate because its recruitment and financial networks have remained intact. Some of the attacks it has been blamed for also appear to have been committed by other rebel groups as well as the Congolese Armed Forces.

From 2015, the ADF experienced a radicalisation after the imprisonment of its leader Jamil Mukulu and the rise of Musa Baluku in his place. From 2019, the ADF had split, with one part remaining loyal to Mukulu, while the other had merged into the Islamic State&#x27;s Central Africa Province under Baluku.

==History==
===Establishment===

The ADF was formed as merger of several rebel factions, including the Allied Democratic Movement, the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU), and militant members of the Tablighi Jamaat movement. The main figure of the group was Jamil Mukulu, a former Catholic who converted to Islam. The members were largely from central Uganda, in particular Iganga, Masaka, and Kampala, and portray themselves as religious crusaders.

Beyond this vaguely stated religious ideology and statements that the government discriminates against Tablighis, the ADF has given few coherent rationales for their insurgency. The ADF chose western Uganda apparently for three reasons: terrain that is ideal for a rural insurgency, proximity to the DRC where the rebels could set up bases and recruit fighters, and the presence of some Ugandan ethnic groups unfriendly to the government that could offer assistance. It received support from the government of Sudan, which was engaged in disputes with the government of Uganda.

=== Low-level operations in the early 2000s ===
Since the 2000s, the ADF has shown no commitment to its original goal of creating an Islamic state except to use it as a narrative to unite its members. By the late 2000s, its leaders had ceased making public proclamations, avoided media and harshly punished runaways. With their methods, the leadership managed to minimize any interactions that might reveal its objectives and activities. This worked to their advantage, allowing them to survive despite repeated military attacks.

While in-depth research explores the group&#x27;s early years in Uganda, there has been hardly any in-depth academic analysis on its activities since it resurfaced in the Congo in 2010. Per Kristof Titeca, the lack of knowledge has also been exploited by some political players to craft the narratives for their own objectives. In general, the group increasingly intermingled with the local population during this time, with many fighters marrying locals.

During March 2007, the Uganda People&#x27;s Defence Force (UPDF) engaged incursive ADF groups in multiple firefights, killing at least 46 in Bundibugyo and Mubende districts. The biggest battle occurred on 27 March, when the UPDF faced an estimated 60 ADF troops, killing 34, including three senior commanders. The UPDF claimed to have retrieved numerous weapons as well as documents that tied the ADF to the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army (LRA).

On 13 April 2007, the UPDF and ADF engaged in an intense battle inside the Semuliki National Park, near the upscale Semliki Lodge tourist destination.

Ceasefire and amnesty talks between the government of Uganda and the ADF were held in Nairobi starting in May 2008. Negotiations were complicated by the fragmentation of the ADF&#x27;s leadership. Non-combatant dependents of the ADF were repatriated to Uganda by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). At least 48 ADF fighters surrendered and were given amnesty. As the threat from the LRA in the DRC waned, the UPDF put increasing focus on the ADF as a reason for UPDF personnel to remain in the DRC.

===2013 resurgence and radicalisation ===
From 2011 to 2013, several hundreds of people were kidnapped in Beni, some by ADF and some by other armed groups. In April 2013, it was reported that ADF started a recruitment campaign in Kampala and other parts of the country. Citing a defector from ADF, AllAfrica.com reported that approximately ten new recruits joined ADF forces every day. In July 2013, the ADF renewed its fighting in the Congolese district of Beni. According to the UN Radio Okapi, the ADF together with the NALU fought a pitched battle with the Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), briefly taking the towns of Mamundioma and Totolito. On 11 July, the ADF attacked the town of Kamango, triggering the flight of over 60,000 refugees across the border into the Ugandan district of Bundibugyo.

Early in September 2013, regional leaders under the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) asked the recently formed combative United Nations Force Intervention Brigade under the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to attack positions of foreign negative forces operating in the DRC, including the ADF. In late September 2013, 3 people were killed and 30 abducted during an ADF attack in the Watalinga Sector, North Kivu, DRC. Omar Kavota, the vice president and spokesman of the local civil society in North Kivu, condemned the abductions. According to the civil society, the abductees included eight minors.

In January 2014, the FARDC launched a major offensive against ADF forces in Beni. By April, Mukulu and other senior leaders of the group fled their headquarters camp from approaching FARDC forces. The remaining ADF fighters– alongside women and children – retreated into the forest, where their numbers were significantly reduced in the following months as a result of starvation, desertion, and continued FARDC attacks. Mukulu and others moved into exile. From this point onwards, the ADF fell under the control of the old second-in-command Musa Baluku. Under his leadership, the ADF became increasingly radical and brutal in its operations, launching more attacks on civilians.

From October to December 2014, 250 people were killed for which ADF was solely blamed by the DRC government and MONUSCO. The Congo Research Group however stated that FARDC soldiers, former members of RCD–K/ML as well as members of communal militias were also involved. From December 2014 to January 2015, three Muslim clerics were killed by unknown assailants. Six alleged ADF members were arrested. However, the government did not show any evidence for ADF links. On 30 March 2015, an Ugandan government spokesman had initially blamed ADF and then al-Shabaab for assassination of government prosecutor Joan Kagezi, without offering evidence in either case. In late April 2015, the ADF&#x27;s leader, Jamil Mukulu, was arrested in Tanzania. In July 2015, he was extradited to Uganda. Despite Mukulu&#x27;s attempts to keep influencing the ADF from prison, Musa Baluku consequently cemented his power and moved the ADF closer to international jihadism.

As of November 2015, the number of attacks on Congolese forces continued, with weekly attacks of varying size taking place and killing more than 400 people in 2015, especially in the territories of Beni (North Kivu) and Irumu (Ituri). The ADF have been blamed for the 2016 Beni massacre and also for an attack in North Kivu on 7 December 2017, which killed 15 UN peacekeepers, all Tanzanians, as well as 5 Congolese soldiers.

=== Split and Baluku&#x27;s allegiance to ISIL ===
From 2017, ADF elements began to forge connections to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In June 2019, an ISIL propaganda video showed Musa Baluku pledging allegiance to ISIL. A &quot;major faction&quot; of the ADF joined Baluku, but a group of Mukulu loyalists opposed to this course consequently split off. The splinter faction was believed to be small, counting 10 to 30 fighters as well as their followers, and to be led by a man known as &quot;Muzaaya&quot;. Muzaaya had previously served as a commander for ADF&#x27;s southern division, the &quot;Mwalika camp&quot;; his splinter was believed to be based along the Semliki River in the Virunga National Park. Muzaaya&#x27;s group included at least one senior commander, Benjamin Kisokeranio, and was rumoured to enjoy support from Mukulu&#x27;s son Hassan Nyanzi who is based in South Africa. The ADF&#x27;s international support network was also affected by the split; several supporters attempted to stay neutral and declare no allegiance to either the Mukulu loyalists or Baluku&#x27;s followers.

The Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) conducted large-scale operations from late 2019 to late 2020 that greatly weakened the ADF, killing hundreds of its fighters. According to the International Crisis Group, the ADF completely splintered during these operations, and the rival factions also distanced themselves from each other geographically. Some ADF elements moved to the Rwenzori Mountains, while others had relocated into Ituri Province where they attacked civilians. Despite these setbacks, ADF forces have been associated with 800 deaths and a prison escape in 2020 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2020, Baluku claimed that the ADF had ceased to exist and was succeeded by the Islamic State&#x27;s Central Africa Province. In April 2024, a joint operation between the armies of the DRC and Uganda enabled the neutralization of two ADF leaders, nicknamed Doctor “Musa”, and the other Commander “Baghdad”.

==Foreign involvement==
The DRC government, citing civil society groups in North Kivu, says that Al-Shabaab fighters from Somalia are collaborating with the ADF. Uganda has claimed that there is a link between them with al-Shabaab and al-Qaeda. In-depth reports have denied this link, stating that there is contact but not real integration. MONUSCO has accused it of having extensive links to international Islamist terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda, al-Shabaab, al-Qaeda (in the Maghreb) and Boko Haram.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; and World Policy Institute however have considered MONUSCO&#x27;s single source as dubious. In 2021, the group claimed at least one attack near Kampala that killed one and injured 7. The deadliest terror incident in Ugandan history was a 2010 attack in the capital Kampala, claimed by Al-Shabab. 74 people who had assembled in public places in Kampala to watch a World Cup soccer game were killed in those FIFA World Cup bombings.

An Islamic State financier (Waleed Ahmed Zein) is said to have paid the group at least once according to a report of the New York University&#x27;s Congo Research Group.

<doc id="1258244" wikidata="Q16186495" url="?curid=1258244" title="John Snobelen">
<text>John Snobelen (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris.

==Background==
Snobelen was raised in Meadowlark, Ontario, and dropped out of high school in Grade 11. He eventually became a successful businessman, making a fortune in the waste-haulage business. He served as President of Jarsno Environmental Inc., Mid-Ontario Equipment Limited and the Cameron Group.

Snobelen was also president of the Hunger Project in Canada, and an associate of the Carter Center, a human-rights organization started by former United States President Jimmy Carter.

==Politics==
Snobelen ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1990, placing third behind incumbent Liberal Steve Offer and a New Democrat in Mississauga North. In the provincial election of 1995, he ran in the same riding and defeated Offer by about 4,500 votes.

The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in the 1995 election, and Snobelen was appointed as Minister of Education and Training in Mike Harris&#x27;s government on June 26, 1995. Shortly after his appointment, Snobelen was filmed arguing that the PC government needs to &quot;bankrupt&quot; and to create a &quot;useful crisis&quot; in the education system so as to initiate significant reforms. This controversy provoked several calls for his resignation, and further unsettled the relationship between the government and the teaching community, which were already tense after the previous NDP administration unilaterally imposed a Social Contract.

In 1997, Snobelen introduced Bill 160, which gave the province control of municipal education taxes, introduced standardized testing, cut teaching preparation time, allowed the government to determine class sizes and granted early retirement initiatives to older, more experienced teachers. Critics argue that the purpose of this bill was to cut education spending, and reduce the power of the teachers&#x27; unions in order to privatize Ontario&#x27;s public education system (Klein, N., &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot;). The education restructuring, along with other cuts to government spending, was expected to significantly reduce the province&#x27;s deficit. Community organizations, teachers and leaders of the provincial unions criticized the bill not only as an attack on local control of public schools and on union bargaining influence, but also as unnecessarily confrontational and as threatening the quality of Ontario&#x27;s education system.

Snobelen was moved to the Ministry of Natural Resources on October 10, 1997. Arguments with the teacher&#x27;s unions and accusations that a high school dropout who didn&#x27;t understand the education portfolio led to his transfer. Snobelen&#x27;s increasingly hostile fight with the unions was the main reason that prompted Harris to shuffle his cabinet at this time.

Shortly after his transfer, Ontario&#x27;s public school teachers entered a two-week strike against the Harris government, with much of their anger directed against the reforms proposed by Snobelen. The Harris government argued that two million students were being held &quot;hostage&quot; by the strike and denounced the teachers for striking in violation of provincial labour laws. Some also criticized the teachers for using their work hours to participate in union activities. Teachers&#x27; representatives argued that they had no other viable options to oppose the proposed legislation. A provincial judge later determined that the provincial government did not meet its obligations in seeking to resolve the strike.

Snobelen&#x27;s successor as Minister of Education, David Johnson, implemented many aspects of Bill 160 after the strike.

As Natural Resources Minister, Snobelen helped push through the Harris government&#x27;s &quot;Lands For Life&quot; program, which protected 24,000 km² of public land in parks and conservation reserves, making them off-limit to industrial activity. He also cancelled the Spring Bear Hunt, a decision which was opposed by many Ontario hunters but supported by animal rights groups.

He was re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Bob Delaney in the redistributed riding of Mississauga West. He retained the Natural Resources portfolio after the election.

Snobelen was dropped from cabinet when Ernie Eves succeeded Harris as Premier in 2002.

In late 2002, it was reported that Snobelen was spending most of his time at a private cattle ranch in Oklahoma while still drawing a Member of Provincial Parliament&#x27;s (MPP) salary. Faced with criticism, he returned to the legislature for most of the 2003 session and resigned his seat on March 17.
===Cabinet positions===

==After politics==
On January 13, 2007, he was arrested in Milton, Ontario for the possession of an unregistered handgun. He was granted an absolute discharge in April 2008, though the judge noted that he had made a serious error in judgement.

In 2012, Snobelen ran for the Presidency of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, finishing second to Richard Ciano.

<doc id="1258248" wikidata="Q6942321" url="?curid=1258248" title="Music of Vermont">
<text>Vermont is a state in the United States. Some of the state&#x27;s bands include RAQ, Phish, Twiddle, Drowningman, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Noah Kahan, Mellow Yellow, Rough Francis, and The Cancer Conspiracy. Burlington also has a thriving local music scene with artists like Eric George, Cricket Blue, the DuPont Brothers, and Addie Herbert.

The state is also home to many iconoclastic composers, from Revolutionary-era Justin Morgan through electronic/avant-gardist Otto Luening. Vermont&#x27;s contemporary composers includes Jon Appleton, Dennis Bathory-Kitsz, David Gunn, Ernie Stires, Su Lian Tan, Dennis Murphy, and Gwyneth Walker.

Vermont is also a source of folk and traditional music, with such musicians as Celia Woodsmith (and her band Avi &amp; Celia,) Pete Sutherland, Anaïs Mitchell, Woods Tea Company and many others.

== Music education and institutions ==
The Vermont Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1934, was the first state-funded orchestra in the nation. The orchestra&#x27;s first artistic director was Alan Carter, followed by Efrain Guigui, Peter Brown, and Kate Tamarkin. The Artistic Director and conductor today is Jaime Laredo. Laredo performs worldwide as a soloist and frequently in duo concerts with Sharon Robinson, cellist. The VSO&#x27;s &quot;Made in Vermont&quot; series annually commissions a Vermont composer to create a large-scale work that tours the State. Previous recipients have included G. Walker, L. Koplewitz, et al. Current composer-in-residence with the VSO is David Ludwig. The Vermont Youth Orchestra has come to prominence since the mid-1990s under the direction of composer/conductor Troy Peters. The Consortium of Vermont Composers was formed in 1988 to promote composers of classical music from the state; the Consortium calls Vermont the &quot;most composer-friendly state&quot; in the country.

== Music festivals ==
The Vermont Mozart Festival, founded in 1974, is the state&#x27;s largest classical music festival. As of 2006, the Mozart Festival has performed well over 2,000 works in over 30 locations, including 278 of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s 626 compositions—possibly more than any other festival or concert series in the country.

The Marlboro Music Festival has been held since 1950. There is also a Champlain Valley Folk Festival, the New World Festival held in Randolph and the One World, One Heart Festival, sponsored by local ice cream manufacturer Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s. The One World, One Heart Festival is held in Warren, Vermont and features concerts by folk and country performers.

The North Branch Bluegrass Festival, held annually since 2008 in Bridgewater, Vermont is an old-fashioned family music festival. It features a weekend show of regional bluegrass musicians, music workshops, and weekend field camping.

<doc id="1258250" wikidata="Q5276220" url="?curid=1258250" title="Digitality">
<text>Digitality (also known as digitalism) is used to mean the condition of living in a digital culture, derived from Nicholas Negroponte&#x27;s book &quot;Being Digital&quot; in analogy with modernity and post-modernity.

==Overview==
Aspects of digitality include nearly continuous contact with other people through cell phones, near instantaneous access to information through the World Wide Web, third wave information storage (where any fragment in a text can be searched and used for categorization, such as through search engine Google), and communicating through weblogs and email.

Some of the negative aspects of digitality include computer viruses and spam.

With the rapidly growing technology, children at increasingly younger ages are learning to speak through the cyber world rather than in face-to-face conversation. They are becoming more digitally literate and creating a new culture in which they communicate more efficiently online than they do in person.

==Development==
In the 1990s, literature on the effects of interactivity with information began to be written and published, particularly focused on the immediacy and ubiquity of digital communications, and the interactivity and participatory nature of digital media. While traditionally in Postmodernism a decisive role for media in the formation of personality, culture and social order is presumed, so that this emerged literature differed fundamentally from the analog critical theory, in that the audience now has the ability to do more than create a personal text through their idiolect, as they are able to create newly informed texts which reinforce the behavior of other participants. Simply put, digital media made way for individuals to express themselves through online interaction and refine their skills in a communal effort.

Many works have been written outlining the fear of digitality. In the 1990s, the realization of digitality caused many artists to visualize and fear a future where analog would become completely extinct. They viewed digitalization as a deletion of the past.

Although the computer was originally created to complete large scale computations, it ultimately progressed into a processing machine that could retrieve and interpret information very quickly. The first personal computer was first introduced by Ed Roberts in 1975 and this sparked the introduction of other &quot;personal computers&quot;. As technology continued to advance, more and more intelligent computers were coming to light with stronger processing power and wider range of utilities. This new age of technology lead to the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 which revolutionized the modern world. With the introduction of this World Wide Web people were able to more commonly access a data pool online with a trove of information. This information is now easily accessible from a Smartphone which can connect people from anywhere at any time. 

==In the 21st century==
Digital technology plays an important role in 21st century life. In the United States, nearly two-thirds of people own smartphones. Using social networking services and online forums, people are able to communicate with other users, regardless of geographic region or time constraints. The rise of this type of interaction partly explains the significant increase in phone use in younger people, and mobile technology is mainly used for the purposes of communication. Digitalism is also slowly replacing many forms of physical aids, such as print encyclopedias and dictionaries, with people turning to newer technology for various needs. In his book, Nicholas Negroponte explains how necessities in the future will be digitized. For example, a large proportion of mass media (including newspapers and magazines) are becoming digitized, and a large percentage of financial transactions made in the United States are being made without the physical exchange of money (e.g. online).

Computation is frequently discussed in debates on digitally. Modern theorists are now choosing to focus more on our relation to computers rather than the computers themselves as an important element of digitality.

==Social media==
Social media are computer-generated tools that allow for people to convey their thoughts, ideas, or interests through digital communities or networks. Social media are online platforms for human interactions with local and global reach, designed to circulate information. These platforms support social interactions and give rise to a complex interplay between communication, social practices, and technological infrastructure. This gives way to connection of all these components in real-time, so that through these connections people, information, data and events are instantly and globally spread. This allows for platforms like Twitter to be a media medium where there is an intersection of media and social interaction.

Social media is different from social networks, but is commonly looked at as the same, which makes public differentiation harder.

Just like television and advertisements, social media has great potential for business and marketing opportunities where companies can formulate custom promotions geared for specific audiences.

==Education==
Digitality in the 2000s has had a great impact on the world of education. The internet creates an abundance of easily accessible and globally diverse resources. The digitization of textbooks and other written texts reduces the demand for the print versions. A vast majority of books now come with a digital version of the text that allows for easier access from anywhere. This applies to scholarly textbooks, religious texts, books, and other texts that would normally have to be found in physical form. Digitalism has also made it so that children are now presented with electronic knowledge at a very early age, resulting in the increased implementation of electronics in school systems (for example in electronic learning, mobile learning, and blended learning). Students and academics alike have adopted social media such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and blogging platforms to expand the horizons for learning.

==Intercultural communication==
Intercultural communication is an important part of globalization. In the past, intercultural communication was made difficult because of the distance separating different cultures. However, with modern-day technology and digitality, it is becoming increasingly possible to interact and learn about other cultures in an environment where people can openly speak. This interaction allows for people to compare and reflect upon both their own and different cultures. The internet creates platforms and forums where people from different backgrounds can develop intercultural communication skills and gain a cross-cultural abundance of knowledge. With the digitality of religious texts and cultural meetings, it is increasingly feasible to be submerged in a culture or religion without the need to travel to the source.

<doc id="1258253" wikidata="Q5625326" url="?curid=1258253" title="Norm Duke">
<text>Norm Duke (born March 25, 1964) is an American professional bowler who previously competed on the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour and now competes on the PBA50 Tour. He has won 40 titles on the PBA Tour, including seven major championships, and another six titles (two of them majors) on the PBA50 Tour. A member of both the PBA and USBC Halls of Fame, Duke is one of only three players in history to reach 40 career PBA Tour titles. He has bowled 73 perfect 300 games in PBA competition, including the 16th televised 300 game in PBA Tour history on January 5, 2003. Duke is a member of the Storm pro staff.

A native of Mount Pleasant, Texas, Duke resides in Clermont, Florida, with his wife Karen. The two have a son named Branden.

==PBA Tour==

In 1983, not even one year after becoming a professional, Duke won the Cleveland Open in North Olmsted, Ohio, and became the youngest player ever to win a PBA Tour title, at 18 years and 345 days. On that day, Duke started from the No. 5 seed and worked his way up the stepladder, defeating the other four bowlers to take the championship, including a victory over the legendary Earl Anthony in Duke&#x27;s first-ever televised match. Duke would not win his second title until 1991, but his career took off from there. He won two titles in the 1993 season, including his first major at the ABC Masters (now known as the USBC Masters).

Norm completed perhaps his best season in 1994, winning five titles including his second career major, at the Tournament of Champions, and also winning PBA Player of the Year honors. He was also the winner of the PBA Player of the Year award in 2000, capturing three titles that year, including his third career major by winning the PBA World Championship. Duke became a member of the USBC Hall of Fame in 2002, and was inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame in January 2009.

Duke currently owns 40 PBA Tour titles, including seven majors: one ABC Masters, one PBA Tournament of Champions, two United States Opens, and three PBA World Championships. By virtue of having won each of these four majors, Duke is one of only three bowlers in Tour history to complete the career Grand Slam, along with fellow Hall-of-Famer Mike Aulby and all-time major titles record holder Jason Belmonte. His 38th title on February 15, 2015 put him in sole possession of third-place on the PBA&#x27;s all-time titles list. Duke&#x27;s career PBA Tour earnings eclipsed $3 million in the 2011-12 season, making him just the third PBA bowler at the time (along with Walter Ray Williams Jr. and Pete Weber) to surpass the $3 million mark in career prize money. Parker Bohn III has since also joined the $3 million club. Duke&#x27;s career earnings have now topped $3.8 million (as of 2022). Duke made multiple TV Finals appearances every season from 1990 through 2015. (He made only one TV finals appearance in 2016.) He has won at least two titles in a season nine times, including a career-best five titles in 1994.

The diminutive Duke (he stands 1.65 meters, or 5-foot-5) is known for his exceptional versatility. He is generally thought of as a stroker, either throwing the ball relatively straight or playing a hook shot from the extreme outside of the lane. But he has also shown the ability (especially earlier in his career) to swing the ball out toward the gutter and bring it back like a cranker when necessary. This gives him the advantage of being able to score well on most of the PBA&#x27;s multiple oil patterns.

===2007–08 season===
The 2007-08 season started slowly for Duke, as he battled illness on top of a series of injuries through the first half. Standing 51st in points and with his Tour exemption in jeopardy, he put together a furious finish by winning two majors in the final five weeks of the season. On February 24, 2008, he won his second career PBA World Championship to lock up a 2008-09 exemption. Then on March 30, he won the U.S. Open and joined Mike Aulby and Billy Hardwick as the only bowlers to ever complete the coveted PBA &quot;Grand Slam,&quot; in which a PBA bowler wins the U.S. Open, World Championship, Tournament of Champions, and USBC Masters at least once in a career. He is also one of only nine bowlers in history to complete the PBA career Triple Crown, in which a player wins the PBA&#x27;s &quot;original&quot; three majors (U.S. Open, Tournament of Champions, and World Championship).

===2008–09 season===
Duke began the 2008-09 season by, again, winning the PBA World Championship. Continuing on his success from the previous season&#x27;s sweep of the final two majors, he accomplished something never before done by any professional bowler: win three consecutive major tournaments. The streak ended when he failed to make the TV finals for the 2009 Tournament of Champions. On April 5, 2009, Duke narrowly missed an opportunity to become just the fifth bowler to repeat as champion at the U.S. Open. He qualified as the #1 seed, but was upset in the final by Mike Scroggins, 191–173. Duke eventually did win a second U.S. Open on February 27, 2011.

===Later career===
Duke&#x27;s 37th title on the PBA Tour came in 2012 at the Dick Weber PBA Playoffs. He joined the PBA50 Tour (formerly PBA Senior Tour) in 2014, while continuing to compete in selected events on the standard PBA Tour. His 38th title on the standard PBA Tour came in the 2015 Mark Roth-Marshall Holman PBA Doubles Championship, where he partnered with Wes Malott for the win.

He captured his 39th PBA title on February 24, 2019 at the PBA Indianapolis Open, defeating Jason Belmonte in the title match. A month shy of his 55th birthday, Duke became the third oldest player to win a standard PBA Tour event, behind John Handegard (57) and Buzz Fazio (winner of two titles at age 56). One week later, he won his 40th PBA Tour title at the PBA Jonesboro Open, becoming the third player in history to win 40 PBA Tour titles (after Walter Ray Williams Jr. and Earl Anthony). It was also the first time in Duke&#x27;s career that he had ever won PBA titles in back-to-back weeks. A testament to Duke&#x27;s versatility, both victories were on mixed lane conditions, with the left lane and right lane featuring different lengths and layouts of oil. In 2019, Duke posted the most cashes (20) and match-play appearances (17) on the PBA Tour since his 2005 season, and his highest earnings since 2008.

On his longevity, Duke stated in 2020:
:&quot;Bowling for a living is so different than most people think. It requires a tremendous commitment to excellence as well as a willingness to expose yourself to failure on a constant basis. Add in a myriad of travel delays and time away from the family; just being happy becomes a chore. The players that mentally manage the grind of the Tour and are able to stay in love with the sport are the ones that have the best chance of sustaining a good career. I have been on the PBA Tour for 38 years and I am as committed now as when I started out in 1982.&quot;

On April 2, 2022, the 58-year old Duke claimed the top seed (out of 420 competitors) at the USBC Masters. Seeking to become the oldest player to win a PBA Tour title and oldest to win a major, he was defeated in the April 3 final by Anthony Simonsen, 219–216. Prior to the finals, Duke announced that unless he qualified for the upcoming PBA Tour Playoffs (he needed a win to qualify), he would be retiring from full-time competition on the PBA Tour. He will still bowl in PBA Regional Tour and PBA50 Tour events.

Duke made his final televised PBA Tour appearance at the 2022 PBA League Elias Cup Finals in Portland, Maine on July 10. He reprised his role as the player/manager for the Dallas Strikers, bowling lead-off for the team. The Strikers made it to the final match against the Portland Lumberjacks. After Duke&#x27;s doubles partner Wes Malott clinched the tournament for Portland with a spare in the 10th frame of the final game, he yielded his fill shot to Duke. Poetically, Duke closed out his full-time PBA Tour career with a strike. Duke&#x27;s departure from the PBA Tour was met with much emotion from bowlers and fans alike, so much so that the hashtag &quot;#ThankYouNorm&quot; began trending throughout the community shortly before he made his final TV appearance.

==PBA50 Tour==
In 2014, Norm won two PBA50 titles, including the Senior U.S. Open, in his first season on the PBA50 Tour. For his efforts, he won both PBA50 Rookie of the Year and PBA50 Player of the Year honors. He is one of only three PBA50 players (with Tom Baker and Tom Hess) to win both awards in the same season. In 2016, he won his third PBA50 title and second PBA50 major at the PBA50 World Championship. He has since won three more standard titles on the PBA50 Tour, in 2017, 2018 and 2021. The latest victory made Duke one of eight players in history to win a PBA Tour or PBA50 Tour title in five different decades, joining Dick Weber, Dave Soutar, Johnny Petraglia, Walter Ray Williams Jr., Pete Weber, Parker Bohn III and Amleto Monacelli.

<doc id="1258255" wikidata="Q5008821" url="?curid=1258255" title="CARINE">
<text>CARINE (Computer Aided Reasoning Engine) is a first-order classical logic automated theorem prover. It was initially built for the study of the enhancement effects of the strategies delayed clause-construction (DCC) and attribute sequences (ATS) in a depth-first search based algorithm. CARINE&#x27;s main search algorithm is semi-linear resolution (SLR) which is based on an iteratively-deepening depth-first search (also known as depth-first iterative-deepening (DFID)) and used in theorem provers like THEO. SLR employs DCC to achieve a high inference rate, and ATS to reduce the search space.

==Delayed Clause Construction (DCC)==
Delayed Clause Construction is a stalling strategy that enhances a theorem prover&#x27;s performance by reducing the work to construct clauses to a minimum. Instead of constructing every conclusion (clause) of an applied inference rule, the information to construct such clause is temporarily stored until the theorem prover decides to either discard the clause or construct it. If the theorem prover decides to keep the clause, it will be constructed and stored in memory, otherwise the information to construct the clause is erased. Storing the information from which an inferred clause can be constructed require almost no additional CPU operations. However, constructing a clause &quot;may&quot; consume a lot of time. Some theorem provers spend 30%–40% of their total execution time constructing and deleting clauses. With DCC this wasted time can be salvaged.

DCC is useful when too many intermediate clauses (especially first-order clauses) are being constructed and discarded in a short period of time because the operations performed to construct such short lived clauses are avoided. DCC may not be very effective on theorems with only propositional clauses.

=== How does DCC work? ===
After every application of an inference rule, certain variables may have to be substituted by terms (e.g. ) and thus a substitution set is formed. Instead of constructing the resulting clause and discarding the substitution set, the theorem prover simply maintains the substitution set along with some other information, like what clauses where involved in the inference rule and what inference rule was applied, and continues the derivation without constructing the resulting clause of the inference rule. This procedure keeps going along a derivation until the theorem provers reaches a point where it decides, based on certain criteria and heuristics, whether to construct the final clause in the derivation (and probably some other clause(s) along the path) or discard the whole derivation i.e., deletes from memory the maintained substitution sets and whatever information stored with them.

==Attribute sequences (ATS)==
(An informal definition of) a clause in theorem proving is a statement that can result in a true or false answer depending on the evaluation of its literals. A clause is represented as a disjunction (i.e., OR), conjunction (i.e., AND), set, or multi-set (similar to a set but can contain identical elements) of literals.

An example of a clause as a disjunction of literals is:
formula_1
where the symbols formula_2 and formula_3 are, respectively, logical or and logical not.

The above example states that if &quot;Y&quot; is wealthy AND smart AND beautiful then &quot;X&quot; loves &quot;Y&quot;. It does not say who &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are though. Note that the above representation comes from the logical statement:

For all &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;X&quot; belonging to the domain of human beings:
formula_4

By using some transformation rules of formal logic we produce the disjunction of literals of the example given above.

&quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are variables. formula_3&quot;wealthy&quot;, formula_3&quot;smart&quot;, formula_3&quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;loves&quot; are literals. Suppose we substitute the variable &quot;X&quot; for the constant John and the variable &quot;Y&quot; for the constant Jane then the above clause will become:

formula_8

A clause attribute is a characteristic of a clause. Some examples of clause attributes are:
* the number of literals in a clause (i.e., clause length)
* the number of term symbols in a clause
* the number of constants in a clause
* the number of variables in a clause
* the number of functions in a clause
* the number of negative literals in a clause
* the number of positive literals in a clause
* the number of distinct variables in a clause
* the maximum depth of any term in all the literals in a clause

;Example

the clause formula_9 has:
* a length of 2 because it contains two literals
** one negative literal which is formula_10
** one positive literal which is &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;))
* two constants which are &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;
* two variables (&quot;x&quot; occurs twice)
* one distinct variable which is &quot;x&quot;
* one function which is &quot;f&quot;
* maximum term depth of 2
* five term symbols which are &quot;x&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;x&quot;

An attribute sequence is a sequence of k &quot;n&quot;-tuples of clause attributes that represent a projection of a set of derivations of length k. k and n are strictly positive integers. The set of derivations form the domain and the attribute sequences form the codomain of the mapping between derivations and attribute sequences.

;Example:

&lt;(2,2),(2,1),(1,1)&gt; is an attribute sequence where &quot;k&quot; = 3 and &quot;n&quot; = 2.

It corresponds to some derivation, say, &lt;(B1,B2),(R1,B3),(R2,B4)&gt; where B1, B2, R1, B3, R2, and B4 are clauses. The attribute here is assumed to be the length of a clause.

The first pair (2,2) corresponds to the pair (B1,B2) from the derivation. It indicates that the length of B1 is 2 and the length of B2 is also 2.

The second pair (2,1) corresponds to the pair (R1,B3) and it indicates that the length of R1 is 2 and the length of B3 is 1.

The last pair (1,1) corresponds to the pair (R2,B4) and it indicates that the length of R2 is 1 and the length of B4 is 1.

Note: An &quot;n&quot;-tuple of clause attributes is similar (but not the same) to the &quot;feature vector&quot; named by Stephan Schulz, PhD (see E equational theorem prover).

<text>The Mitsubishi 4G9 engine is a series of straight-4 automobile engines produced by Mitsubishi Motors. All are 16-valve, and use both single- and double- overhead camshaft heads. Some feature &quot;MIVEC&quot; variable valve timing, and it was the first modern gasoline direct injection engine upon its introduction in August 1996.

==4G91==
The &quot;4G91&quot; uses a bore and stroke of for a total displacement of . With a 9.5:1 compression ratio and DOHC, four-valve-per-cylinder head and multi-point EFI, this engine produces at 6,000 rpm and at 5,000 rpm. The 4G91 was a short-lived model, mainly built between 1991 and 1995 and rarely seen in export markets. There was also a carbureted model, with at 6,000 rpm and at 3,500 rpm.

Applications
* Mitsubishi Lancer
* Mitsubishi Mirage
* Proton Wira

==4G92==
The &quot;4G92&quot; displaces . It first appeared in the late-1991 Japanese-spec Mirage RS and Super R in DOHC form. The 4G92 is basically a version of the &quot;4G91&quot; with the bore increased to . In the original DOHC 16V form it produces . Later, a fuel-efficient SOHC version was added, but the 4G92 is best known in its high-performance &quot;MIVEC&quot; equipped DOHC version, which fully replaced &quot;ordinary&quot; DOHC in 1993. Power output was raised as high as , as found in the JDM Mirage Cyborg-ZR and 1992 Lancer MR, making it one of the most powerful 1.6-litre naturally aspirated engines. A modular displacement (MD) version of the 4G92 MIVEC was also produced – MD is Mitsubishi&#x27;s cylinder deactivation system which helps improve fuel consumption.

==4G93==

The 4G93 is a engine available in both SOHC and DOHC versions. Turbocharged variants are also produced. In mid 1996 Mitsubishi released a gasoline direct injection (GDI) version of the 4G93. This GDI model saw a production of over a million units though it was a heavy polluter therefore only sold in the Japanese market. A partially cleaned up version (with less power) was later sold in Europe, and was among the first of the modern GDI engines. It brought good fuel economy and, if well serviced, long engine life.

<text>WTOH (98.9 FM, &quot;The Answer&quot;) is a conservative talk radio station serving the Greater Columbus area, currently owned by the Salem Media Group and licensed to Upper Arlington, Ohio. The station&#x27;s studios are shared with sister station WRFD (880 AM) and are located in North Columbus; WTOH&#x27;s transmitter is northwest of downtown.

==History==
=== Adult contemporary (1989–1991) ===
The station began in 1989 as adult contemporary WXMX &quot;The Mix&quot; by Twin Rivers Communications owned by Michael and Mary Mahaffey.

=== Country (1991–1996) ===
In 1991, the station was purchased by Alan Gray&#x27;s Tri-City Radio and changed to modern country music as WRVF &quot;98.9 The River.&quot; In 1994 the station was sold to Carl Hirsch who re-imaged it as &quot;Wild Country, The New 98.9&quot; (under the WLLD calls) and again later as the decidedly less aggressive &quot;Country 98-9&quot;. The station briefly stunted in late 1996 by simulcasting audio from 98.9 MHz on both 105.7 MHz and 107.1 MHz in a short-lived attempt to &quot;surround&quot; country competitor WCOL-FM.

=== Alternative (1996–1998) ===
Then-owner Jacor Communications programmed the station as the alternative rock &quot;Channel Z&quot; (under the WZAZ-FM calls) prior to an acquisition by Blue Chip Broadcasting (and subsequently Radio One).

=== Urban (1998–2011) ===
After &quot;Channel Z&quot; was relocated to 105.7 FM and Blue Chip&#x27;s acquisition, the station flipped to urban oldies as &quot;Magic 98.9&quot;, WXMG, in 1998, which later evolved to Urban AC in 2001, retaining the &quot;Magic&quot; moniker.

=== Adult hits ===
At 12:00pm on September 16, 2011, &quot;Magic 98.9&quot; moved to sister station WJYD, displacing the urban gospel format (&quot;Joy 106.3&quot;). The 98.9 frequency then flipped to adult hits, branded as &quot;98-9 Jack FM.&quot; The first song on &quot;Jack FM&quot; was &quot;Cum on Feel the Noize&quot; by Quiet Riot. On September 23, 2011, WXMG changed their call letters to WJKR (at the same time, the WXMG calls moved to WJYD). The station was one of three non-urban radio stations owned by Radio One (the others being all-news KROI—Houston and Top 40 WNOU—Indianapolis), until the company sold it on October 23, 2012, to Salem Communications.

=== Talk (2012–present) ===
On November 1, 2012, at approximately 12:01 a.m., &quot;Jack FM&quot; signed off after playing &quot;It&#x27;s The End Of The World As We Know It&quot; by R.E.M. Salem Communications took over after a few seconds of dead air with a speech from Ronald Reagan, with the official launch of &quot;98.9 The Answer&quot; at 6 that morning.

On February 15, 2013, the WJKR callsign changed to WTOH.

The &quot;Jack FM&quot; format and WJKR callsign returned to Columbus on July 24, 2013 when WMNI-FM flipped from a simulcast of then sister station News/Talk WMNI (who flipped to adult standards 6 days earlier) back to Adult Hits as &quot;103.9 Jack FM&quot;. The station had originally carried the format as WTDA &quot;103.9 Ted FM&quot; from 2005-2007.

==HD Radio==
WTOH also broadcasts in HD Radio. Its HD2 subchannel airs a Christian contemporary format and is branded &quot;Today&#x27;s Christian Music 95.9&quot;. Its HD2 subchannel is simulcast on 95.9 MHz, through translator W240CX.

<doc id="1258261" wikidata="Q7374878" url="?curid=1258261" title="Royal Stewart tartan">
<text>The Royal Stewart or Royal Stuart tartan is the best-known tartan retrospectively associated with the royal House of Stewart, and is also the personal tartan of the British monarch, presently King Charles III. The sett was first published in 1831 in the book &quot;The Scottish Gaël&quot; by James Logan. Officially, the tartan is worn by the pipers of the Black Watch, Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, and the Scots Guards, as well as a select few civilian groups like the Glasgow Police Pipe Band and the Winnipeg Police Pipe Band. The 5th Bolton Scout Group and the 5th Potters Bar Scout Group wear the scarf (neckerchief) officially, with permission from the Queen, and the Queen&#x27;s Bands (of Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada) wear the tartan as part of their official uniforms. The tartan may also be worn by members who took part in a patrol leaders training course. In 1968, the pipes and drums of the 3rd battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, were also given permission to wear the Royal Stewart tartan.

==Background==
Theoretically, this tartan should not be worn without the express permission of the British monarch. However, the Scottish Register of Tartans observes that in practice, due to its popularity, it has become a universal tartan, which can be worn by anyone who doesn&#x27;t have their own clan tartan. &quot;In the same way that clansmen wear the tartan of their chief, it is appropriate for all subjects of the [monarch] to wear the Royal Stewart tartan.&quot; Colin W. Hutcheson attributes this universalisation to &quot;commercialisation in recent times&quot;; traditionally, the Black Watch (darkened Old Campbell) and Hunting Stewart tartans were used as universal tartans requiring no permission.

In addition to its use in clothing, such as skirts and scarves, Royal Stewart tartan has also appeared on biscuit tins for Scottish shortbread such as Walker&#x27;s. In the 1960s, the tartan became well known in motor racing circles, as three-time Formula One world champion Jackie Stewart from Scotland used a distinctive band of Royal Stewart tartan around his crash helmet. In the mid 1970s, Eric Faulkner of the Bay City Rollers began using the tartan for the many embellishments on his stage clothing. In the late 1970s, the Royal Stewart tartan became popular in punk fashion.

<text>Earl Roderick Anthony (April 27, 1938 – August 14, 2001) was an American professional bowler who amassed records of 43 titles and six Player of the Year awards on the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour. For over two decades, his career title count was listed as 41. The count was amended to 43 in 2008, when the PBA chose to retroactively award PBA titles for ABC Masters championships if won by a PBA member at the time. He is widely credited (along with Dick Weber) for having increased bowling&#x27;s popularity in the United States. He was the first bowler to earn over $100,000 in a season (1975), and the first to reach $1,000,000 in lifetime PBA earnings (1982). His ten professional major titles—six PBA National Championships, two Firestone Tournament of Champions titles, and two ABC Masters (now USBC Masters) titles—are the second most all time, tied with Pete Weber and five behind Jason Belmonte.

Anthony is one of only three bowlers in history (with Walter Ray Williams Jr. and Norm Duke) to have reached the 40-title plateau on the PBA Tour. He is also one of three bowlers (with Williams Jr. and Pete Weber) to earn at least 50 combined titles between the PBA Tour and PBA Senior Tour (now PBA50 Tour).

Never brash or flashy in a crew-cut and plastic-frame &quot;marshwood&quot; style eyewear (which he abandoned for more modern frames later in his career), Anthony was dubbed &quot;Square Earl&quot; by fellow pro bowlers.

A new biography of Earl (focusing more on his bowling career but with a few personal insights) was published in October 2019 by Luby Publishing. Compiled by sportswriter Barry Sparks, it is titled &quot;Earl: The Greatest Bowler of All Time.&quot;

==PBA career==
Anthony&#x27;s bowling career began when he hesitantly joined his company&#x27;s bowling league, West Coast Grocery, after serving in the United States Air Force. In his first season bowling, Earl achieved an official league average of 165. By his third season, his average had surged to 217. In 1963, he bowled three PBA summer tournaments in the Pacific Northwest to get a feel for what it would take to successfully compete on the tour. Though he did not cash in any of the three events, he had succeeded in learning how much he would need to improve before he could entertain any idea of going out on the PBA Tour full-time. In order to prepare himself for the tour Anthony practiced between 300 and 350 games a week, up to eight hours a day, and often without any pins (in order to save money). After six years of diligent practice, Anthony began his professional bowling career in January 1970 as a 31-year old rookie. He led that season&#x27;s first tournament going into the televised finals at Crestview Bowl in Wichita, Kansas, but lost the championship match to Skee Foremsky, finishing in second place.

Anthony won the first of his 43 PBA titles on June 7, 1970, when he defeated Allie Clarke at the Heidelberg Open in Seattle, Washington. His final PBA title was a major — the 1983 Toledo Trust PBA National Championship (until his 1984 ABC Masters title was added retroactively in 2008). Six of his titles were achieved by a pair of improbable &quot;three-peats&quot; in the PBA National Championship, the first three from 1973 to 1975 and the other three from 1981 to 1983. Earl also finished runner-up to fellow lefty Mike Aulby in the 1979 PBA National Championship.

After a nine-month layoff, Anthony won his second ABC Masters tournament in 1984, which at the time was not part of the PBA Tour. Anthony had also won the Masters in 1977. The PBA later added ABC Masters titles as PBA titles, giving Anthony at least one PBA title in 15 consecutive seasons (1970–84). That stood as a PBA record until Walter Ray Williams Jr. won at least one PBA Tour title in 17 consecutive seasons (1993 through 2009–10).

Anthony joined the PBA Senior Tour in 1988 and accumulated another seven titles there, giving him 50 total PBA titles.

By 1988 Anthony had 25 career 300 games. Sadly, not one was on television in the United States; he did, however, bowl two televised 299 games, leaving a solid 9-pin on the last shot in one and a 6-pin on the other. Although he didn&#x27;t drop to the floor like Don Johnson, Anthony would remark about the 9-pin on a PBA telecast years later, saying, &quot;to this day, I can&#x27;t believe that pin stood.&quot; Earl Anthony did shoot a televised 300 game on national TV in a PBA Tournament in Japan in front of over 50 million viewers.

After retiring, Anthony moved to the broadcast booth as a color commentator and operated a bowling center in Dublin, California.

==Personal life and death==
Anthony was born in Tacoma, Washington to Earl Anthony and Laura Davis. He was a minor league baseball pitcher with the Baltimore Orioles organization before his days as a professional bowler. He was also an excellent golfer, achieving a near-scratch handicap at the age of 60. He once set the course record at Crow Canyon Country Club in Danville, California with a scratch score of 64.

He was married to Susie Anthony; and had a son, Mike, and two daughters, Tracy and Jeri.

Anthony missed some time on the PBA Tour during the 1978 season after suffering a heart attack in June of that year. Less than three months later he was back on Tour, finishing third in the Waukegan (IL) Open.

Earl Anthony died in 2001 due to head injuries sustained from falling down a flight of stairs at his friend Ed Baur&#x27;s home in New Berlin, Wisconsin. He was 63 years old.

The &quot;Earl Anthony Memorial Scholarship Fund&quot; was established through funding by the ABC Championship Tournament, in order to provide scholarships to young bowlers. It is now administrated by the Bowling Foundation.

In January 2002, the PBA began the year with a tournament named after Anthony, &quot;The Earl Anthony Memorial Classic.&quot; It was first held at TechCity Bowl in Kirkland, Washington. It was won by left-handed pro bowler Parker Bohn III, who beat Patrick Healey, Jr. in the final match 235 to 215. It later moved to Medford, Oregon and re-titled as &quot;The Earl Anthony Medford Classic.&quot; In 2010 and 2011, the event took place in Dublin, California and was titled the Earl Anthony Memorial.

==Legacy==
Anthony was voted into the PBA Hall of Fame in 1981 and the ABC Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2000 he was voted &quot;Master of the Millennium&quot; by a wide margin in a nationwide vote conducted by &quot;Bowling Magazine&quot;. In a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Magazine national vote he was named the 2nd Greatest Athlete in the history of the State of Washington (behind only former Gonzaga and NBA star John Stockton).

The late bowling legend Dick Weber dubbed Anthony &quot;the greatest speed-control bowler ever.&quot; When Anthony won the 1978 Tournament of Champions to become the first bowler to ever reach 30 titles, Weber was in the broadcast booth and proclaimed Anthony to be &quot;the undisputed King of Bowling.&quot; Earl&#x27;s record of 41 titles stood for 23 years before it was broken by Walter Ray Williams Jr. in 2006, though it increased to 43 in 2008 when the PBA started including ABC Masters titles if they were won by a PBA member. In 14 seasons, Anthony made the top five for the televised final round a record 144 times. Said &quot;Bowlers Journal&quot; editor Jim Dressel, &quot;When Earl was in the house, everybody else knew there were only four other spots for TV.&quot;

In 2008, the PBA celebrated fifty years in existence by commissioning a panel of experts to rank the &quot;50 Greatest Bowlers of the Last 50 Years.&quot; Anthony was ranked #1 on the list over Walter Ray Williams Jr., despite the fact that Williams had broken many of Anthony&#x27;s records. However, Williams himself said, &quot;I feel Earl&#x27;s record is better than mine because it was more condensed. Earl bowled 14 years and 400 or so events. I’ve bowled well over 600 by now, maybe 700.&quot; Williams also added, &quot;When Earl Anthony retired, he didn&#x27;t have anyone to push him. He probably would have kept going to 50 if that were the case. It&#x27;s hard to say what would&#x27;ve happened then.&quot;

The United States Bowling Congress testing robot for bowling, similar to golf&#x27;s &quot;Iron Byron,&quot; is named &quot;E.A.R.L.&quot; (Enhanced Automated Robotic Launcher). The name was given by USBC Junior Gold youth bowler Melissa Stewart of Roswell, Georgia, who said the name was based on Anthony and his &quot;machine-like characteristics.&quot; The PBA World Championship now uses the 43-foot Earl Anthony oil pattern, in honor of the man who won the event a record six times.

<text>Farm Fresh was a Canadian hip hop group from Brandon, Manitoba made up of Mcenroe, Pip Skid and DJ Hunnicutt.

==History==
Farm Fresh first came together in 1991. They later moved to Winnipeg, and in 1994 released their first recording &quot;The Space EP&quot;. This was followed by a full-length album named &quot;Crazy Friction&quot; in 1995. 

Soon after, the group stopped developing new material. They released a compact disc called &quot;Played Out&quot;, containing previous recordings and a few unreleased songs, in 1996. The band also appeared on Rheostatics&#x27; album &quot;The Nightlines Sessions&quot;, collaborating with that band on an improvised live track called &quot;Trans Jam&quot;.

Farm Fresh reunited for an anniversary album named &quot;Time Is Running Out&quot;, which was released in March 2005. The album was recorded in a basement studio in Brandon.

All of their albums have been released on Peanuts &amp; Corn Records, a label founded and operated by Mcenroe.

<doc id="1258274" wikidata="Q2545177" url="?curid=1258274" title="Lake Horowhenua">
<text>Lake Horowhenua is in the Horowhenua District, an area of the southern Manawatū-Whanganui region in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It covers an area of .

The lake, also known as &quot;Punahau&quot;, is an aeolian lake that lies on a sandy plain west of Levin and from the coast of the Tasman Sea. It is a shallow lake, only some deep, fed by various small streams, and is drained by the Hokio Stream.

==History==
The lake was once surrounded by podocarp forest as the centre of a rich wetland ecosystem. Today the trees are gone and the wetland has been substantially drained. The lake is owned by the Māori Muaūpoko iwi, who, with the help of the Horowhenua Lake Trust, are actively attempting to restore the wetland system (which also contains the smaller Lake Papaitonga) to its former state, as a conservation area.

In the 1820s the Muaūpoko were attacked by Te Rauparaha and the Ngāti Toa. Two island pā on the lake were destroyed.

==Water quality==
Between 1952 and 1987 treated sewage from Levin was dumped into the lake. This has contributed significantly to the current eutrophic state of the lake.
Between 2020 and 2030, the water of Lake Horowhenua is allowed to be maintained below some national bottom lines for water quality.

<text>Rick Aviles (October 14, 1952 – March 17, 1995) was an American stand-up comedian and actor of Puerto Rican descent, best remembered for his role as Willie Lopez in the film &quot;Ghost&quot;.

==Career==
Born in Manhattan, Aviles worked as a street performer and stand-up comedian on the Greenwich Village night-club circuit in New York in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1978, a &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer called him &quot;a comic with a future&quot;. He was frequently seen in the NYC subways, doing his act for the riders. He made his film debut as Mad Dog in 1981&#x27;s &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;. He went on to work in several other films, including minor parts in &quot;Street Smart&quot; and &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot;, both released in 1987. That same year he became the host of &quot;It&#x27;s Showtime at the Apollo&quot;, which he continued as host until 1991.

A &quot;Variety&quot; review of his stand-up act in 1990 noted, &quot;Utilizing masterful ethnic impersonations and a remarkably rubbery face, Puerto Rican comic Rick Aviles comes off as one of the brightest and most consistently clever stand-ups working the circuit today&quot;.

In 1990, Aviles landed his most memorable role: the hired killer Willie Lopez in &quot;Ghost&quot;, a smash hit at the box office that received multiple Oscar nominations. He also appeared in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Train&quot; (1989) as Will Robinson; Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990) as Mask #1; Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; (1993) as Quisqueya; in &quot;Waterworld&quot; (1995) as the Gatesman, and in &quot;Joe&#x27;s Apartment&quot; (1996) as the voice of a cockroach.

Among the television series in which he appeared are &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Dracula&quot; (1980), &quot;The Day Women Got Even&quot; (1980), &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (1991) and Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Stand&quot; (1994).

==Death==
On April 17, 1995, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Aviles had died of heart failure on March 17. Eleven years later, a 2006 article in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed him as among the celebrities who had contracted HIV and died from complications of AIDS.

<doc id="1258293" wikidata="Q405284" url="?curid=1258293" title="Mitsubishi 6G7 engine">
<text>The 6G7 series or Cyclone V6 engine is a series of V6 piston engines from Mitsubishi Motors. Five displacement variants were produced from 1986 to 2021, with both SOHC and DOHC, naturally aspirated and turbo charged layouts. While &quot;MIVEC&quot; variable valve timing has also been implemented in some versions the 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 L versions were also available with gasoline direct injection. This engine has been the flagship powerplant of the company except when they briefly built a V8 in 1999–2001. The staple of their high-end sedans, it was given twin-turbos for the Mitsubishi GTO, and became the most powerful car ever built by the company at the time.

This engine was also manufactured by Hyundai Motor Company in South Korea as the Hyundai Sigma engine.

== Bore and Stroke ==
==6G71==
The 2.0-litre 6G71 model featured SOHC and produced at 5,500 rpm and at 4,500 rpm. It was installed with two valves per cylinder, and used Mitsubishi&#x27;s ECI-Multi multiple port fuel injection fuel delivery system. The compression ratio was 8.9:1. An earlier version, with single-point fuel injection, only had at 5,000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm.

A supercharger was installed and exclusive to the Debonair. It produces at 5,000 rpm and at 3,000 rpm. The compression ratio for the supercharged model is 8.0:1. The 6G71 engine was also converted to run on LPG, a version which was only available to the Debonair and mainly intended for commercial (taxi) use.

===Applications===
* 1986–1990 Mitsubishi Galant
* 1986–1992 Mitsubishi Debonair
* 1990–1992 Mitsubishi Diamante/Mitsubishi Sigma

==6G72==
The 3.0-litre 6G72 was manufactured in three different models which featured SOHC with 12 valves, SOHC with 24 valves, and DOHC with 24 valves.

The latest version was used in the Mitsubishi Eclipse GT and Galant. Output in 2004 was at 5500 rpm with of torque at 4000 rpm. In the older version, used in many Chrysler models since 1987, this V6 was an SOHC 12-valve developing at 5000 rpm and of torque at 3600 rpm. The Mitsubishi models were with a 3.0L 6G72 engine SOHC 24-valve developing at 5000 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm. For the MIVEC engine, output was at 6000 rpm and at 4500 rpm.

The SOHC 12-valve for the second generation of Pajero could produce up to and , whereas the SOHC 24-valve could produce up to and .

The DOHC 24-valve was used in the Mitsubishi Debonair, 3000GT, and Dodge Stealth producing and of torque with a 10.0:1 compression ratio in naturally aspirated form, and as much as and of torque in turbocharged form. The turbocharged variant had the lowest compression ratio at 8.0:1, with each bank of the V6 having its own independent turbocharger and intercooler. Turbochargers were built by Mitsubishi.

==6G73==
The 2.5-litre 6G73 is a 24-valve SOHC design with two valves running off a single cam lobe on the exhaust valves using a forked rocker arm and each intake valve actuated with two cam lobes, with a smaller bore than the 3.0L version of the same block. Bore and stroke are ; it is a 60-degree V6 and weighs around . The engine has low-profile cast aluminum heads which help it to fit into compact engine bays, while pent-roof combustion chambers increase efficiency and make room for four valves per cylinder, arranged in a cross-flow pattern with a &quot;tumble&quot; intake port for both strong breathing and low emissions. Spark plugs are centered in the combustion chambers. The intake valves are in diameter while exhaust valves are . The SOHC 24 valve version of the 6G72 uses these same cylinder heads. A toothed timing belt is used. The output of 6G73 is at 5,900 rpm with of torque at 4,350 rpm.

===Applications===

* 1990–2002 Mitsubishi Diamante
* 1993–1996 Mitsubishi Galant
* 1995–2000 Chrysler Cirrus
* 1995–2000 Chrysler Sebring
* 1995–2000 Dodge Stratus
* 1995–2000 Dodge Avenger

==6G74==
The 3.5-litre 6G74 is a 24-valve unit available with either SOHC, DOHC, or MIVEC DOHC. Output for the SOHC version varies from at 4,750 rpm with of torque at 3,750 rpm in the Pajero to the highest output of at 5,250 rpm with of torque at 4,500 rpm in the Australian-made Magna Sports, VR-X and Verada GTV/GTVi and at 5,500 rpm with of torque at 4,000 rpm in the Magna Ralliart. For the MIVEC, only available in the Mitsubishi Pajero Evolution, the output is at 6,000 and at 4,500 rpm. It uses Multi-port fuel injection and uses forged steel connecting rods.

The gasoline direct injection version of the 6G74 was launched in April 1997 as the first GDI V6 engine ever produced. It differed from the basic 6G74 in many ways apart from its unique fuel injection system—it had a crown-curved rather than flat piston head, upright intake ports rather than angled, and a 10.4:1 rather than a 10.0:1 compression ratio. Mitsubishi claimed 30 percent better fuel economy, a 30 percent reduction in emissions, and higher power outputs than diesels.

<text>Bart Maves (born October 30, 1964) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003. In 2010, he was elected as a Regional Councillor representing Niagara Falls for the Niagara Regional Council.

==Background==
Maves worked as a legislative assistant to federal MP Ken Atkinson, who represented St. Catharines from 1988 to 1993. He also worked as a planning secretariat for Alberta&#x27;s Education ministry. Maves is a nephew of W. Bart Maves who was elected to as a Niagara Falls City Councillor in 2006 and re-elected in 2010.

==Politics==

===Provincial===
Maves was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Marg Germano and incumbent New Democrat Margaret Harrington in the riding of Niagara Falls. In 1997, he was appointed as the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Labour.

In the provincial election of 1999, Maves was re-elected by about 1,500 votes over Liberal candidate Selina Volpatti. He held other parliamentary assistant positions in the parliament which followed, but was not appointed to cabinet. In 2002, he supported Jim Flaherty&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to replace Mike Harris as party leader.

In the 2003 provincial election, Maves lost to Liberal Kim Craitor by over 3,000 votes. He was the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario&#x27;s candidate for the Niagara Falls riding again in the 2007 provincial election but lost again to Craitor.

He tried to regain the seat in a February 2014 by-election after Craitor retired but lost to NDP candidate Wayne Gates by 1,025 votes. He was defeated once again by Gates in the 2014 provincial election, this time by 7,429 votes.

===Regional===
In the 2010 municipal election, Maves ran for and was elected as one of the three regional councillors representing Niagara Falls on the Niagara Regional Council. Maves topped the polls, winning 13,695 votes, more than any other candidate for any municipal office in Niagara Falls. Elected alongside Maves as a regional councillor was Selina Volpatti, who had been his Liberal opponent during the 1999 provincial general election. Maves attempted to become the chair of the Regional Council. The position is not directly elected but is selected by a runoff ballot process amongst the members of the council. Maves lost to Gary Burroughs by a vote of 19 to 11 on the 4th ballot.

<doc id="1258319" wikidata="Q681605" url="?curid=1258319" title="Clock King">
<text>The Clock King is the name of three supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first Clock King debuted in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #111 (August 1960), and was created by France Herron and Lee Elias.

The Clock King, primarily William Tockman, have appeared in several media adaptations, such as &quot;Batman&quot; (1966), portrayed by Walter Slezak; and Arrowverse TV series, portrayed by Robert Knepper. Additionally, an original incarnation, Temple Fugate, appears in shows set in the DC Animated Universe, voiced by Alan Rachins.

==Publication history==
The first Clock King was originally an enemy of Green Arrow. He has no superpowers or abilities. He wears a clock mask, a cape, and a blue suit with clock drawings on it.

Clock King is a master planner and sometimes uses clock-themed gadgetry. The Clock King became better known more recently by his appearances in &quot;Justice League International&quot; and &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===William Tockman===
Born William Tockman, the Clock King spends his early years taking care of his invalid sister. During one day, he finds out from a doctor&#x27;s visit that he himself only has six months to live. Despairing for his sister&#x27;s future, he watches the timing of a local bank&#x27;s vault to rob it, hoping the money would provide for his sister after he was gone. His caper would have gone successfully, had he not tripped a silent alarm and been caught by Green Arrow.

While he is incarcerated, his sister dies alone. In further and hideous irony, Tockman discovers that he really is not terminally ill; his doctor had accidentally switched his papers with those of another patient. Infuriated, he escapes, later futilely attempting revenge on both Green Arrow and the incompetent doctor.

With several other villains, the Clock King becomes a member of the Injustice League, a team of out-of-luck supervillains who, when banding together, become even less successful than they have been in their individual careers. The Injustice League is defeated time and again by the Justice League International, at least when they are not making laughingstocks of themselves. Trying to reform, the members later become the core of the equally laughable hero team Justice League Antarctica. This JLA includes G&#x27;Nort, who ends up saving the lives of the entire team. Like his compatriots, Clock King becomes an ardent supporter of Maxwell Lord, partly due to the fact he is the only one willing to hire them. His group even guards Lord when he is incapacitated by a bullet wound. The villains again later reunite as the Injustice League as henchmen of Sonar.

Later, the Clock King leads his own separate team of villains in a mission. They consist of Radiant, Sharpe, Acidia, and Crackle. They are not as well-organized as even the Injustice League. For example, Crackle still lives with his mother and they have to take the bus to their fight. It takes place at a Metropolis toy store. They end up fighting one of the many incarnations of the Teen Titans, the heroes Booster Gold and Firehawk and DEO agent Cameron Chase. An unclear super-effect from Chase ultimately neutralizes Clock King&#x27;s team and they are all imprisoned. Clock King himself escapes on another bus.

Still later, Clock King and his Injustice League friends are transformed into the new Suicide Squad. They are sent to a remote research facility where a genetic monstrosity is holding its creator hostage. Its main defenses are spawned &quot;children&quot; that could explode. During the mission, most of the team are seemingly killed, including Clock King, who is shot repeatedly in a retreat attempt. He is seen still alive after his brutal wounds but, in the end, Major Disaster believes he is the only one who survives. It turns out Cluemaster, shot in a similar manner as Clock King, survives, albeit with drastic scarring. Multi-Man also survives due to his ability to be reborn with new powers after dying.

Clock King is not seen for a period of time after &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. In an issue of &quot;52&quot;, one character decides to kill all the time-travelers, and mentions someone &quot;ending up like Time Commander and Clock Queen&quot;.

===Tem===
A new Clock King appears in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #56 as the head of a team of villains named the Terror Titans. In an interview with &quot;Teen Titans&quot; writer Sean McKeever, he described this Clock King as &quot;... Very smart. He sees things differently than others&quot;. His costume is similar to the suit worn by the Clock King seen in &quot;&quot;, although lacking a hat and having clock faces on his tie. Also evocative of &quot;the Animated Series&quot;, Disruptor refers to him as &quot;Tem&quot; before being killed; After his group defeats and captures Kid Devil, Clock King conditions the hero to be sold as a fighter to a group called &quot;The Dark Side Club&quot;. Clock King then brings the Titans to his base of operations, a dimension outside of time. After besting Robin, Clock King is stymied by Ravager, who possesses similar precognitive abilities. He offers Ravager a chance to join him, but she refuses. Clock King then removes the Titans from his base and decides to move on to new plans. Ravager ultimately reconsiders his earlier offer. In the &quot;Terror Titans&quot; miniseries, Clock King takes over the Dark Side Club, and uses it to brainwash young metahumans, turning them into his very own &quot;Martyr Militia&quot;. He sends the Militia to attack Los Angeles, for no reason other than to amuse him. Clock King&#x27;s plans are eventually undone by Miss Martian, who was posing as one of the captured Metahumans, and Ravager, who attacks and defeats him, forcing him to flee his base of operations.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot;, three iterations of the Clock King appeared:
* Billy Tockman is an African-American crime boss based in Seattle. Tockman owns a nightclub called the Midnight Lounge, and vintage clock repair shop called the Clock King, which he uses as a front for his operations. While Green Arrow is off dealing with the Outsiders, Diggle, along with Naomi Singh and Henry Fyff, talk Tockman into taking down Richard Dragon, to which he agrees. When they meet to take down Dragon, Tockman betrays them, claiming Dragon made a better offer. When Green Arrow returns and faces Dragon, he holds Naomi and Fyff at gunpoint on Dragon&#x27;s orders and ends up shooting Fyff, then promptly getting beat up and knocked out by Emiko Queen.
* Another Clock King, wearing the original Clock King costume, battles the newest incarnation of the Birds of Prey amped up on Venom.
* Another, bearing an appearance similar to his Animated Series look (but with a black and blue suit and black and yellow glasses), tries to rob a store alongside his roommate Sportsmaster, who calls him Bill. He is stopped by Harley Quinn and Power Girl, but not before teleporting them into another dimension. He is shown to have the ability to rewind time.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch, two Clock Kings are active:
* A man who wears the classic Clock King costume, but with his face showing, this new version claims to be a temporal anomaly and feeds on the life force of others to maintain his youth, which led to him preying on African citizens. He is sheltered within the African nation of Buredunia under dictator Matthew Bland. His actions drew the attention of Deathstroke, who was assigned by Bland to kill Clock King as revenge for his murders. However, Clock King managed to save his life by revealing that the warlord would kill Deathstroke after he had finished the job. He later kidnaps Bland. During the fight, Slade shoots him, revealing his powers to be special effects. Furthermore, Clock King revealed that as a time anomaly, he saw that as a result of Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s manipulation of the timestream led to the rebirth of Deathstroke&#x27;s ally Wintergreen. With that information, Deathstroke spared Clock King&#x27;s life.
* Billy Tockman, here now a former engineer and drug dealer in a suit, sporting glasses inherited from his grandfather and having a tattoo of a clock and arrow on the side of his head, he wired targets to clocks that can kill the wearer. This version would later face Batman. He bragged that he would be able to predict every one of Batman&#x27;s movements, but was defeated by a hiding Catwoman. He was invited to a weapons deal by Tiger Shark and Blockbuster on board a ship, which was stopped by Nightwing. He is seen tinkering with his clocks as the ship sinks.

==Powers and abilities==
* The original Clock King has no metahuman powers or abilities, although he is athletic and extraordinarily smart. He extensively uses clock and time -related gimmicks to devastating effect.
* The second Clock King is able to see several seconds into the future, allowing him to anticipate an opponent&#x27;s every move. He is also a technological genius, creating devices such as teleporters, communications jamming equipment, and even an anti-gravity platform, all modelled after timepieces.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Flashpoint&quot;===
In an alternate timeline depicted in &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, the Clock King is imprisoned in military Doom prison before breaking out alongside Heat Wave and Plastic Man.

* An original incarnation of the Clock King named Temple Fugate (a play on the Latin phrase &quot;tempus fugit&quot;) appears in series set in the DC Animated Universe (DCAU), voiced by Alan Rachins. This version is obsessed with time and punctuality, even going so far as to pre-plan his every waking moment on a to-do list and break them down into precise blocks.
** Introduced in a self-titled episode of &quot;&quot;, Fugate served as the head of a time and motion study consulting company that was fined $20 million in court and was in the midst of his last appeal against the verdict. Future Gotham mayor Hamilton Hill convinced Fugate to break his schedule and take his coffee break at a slightly later time, warning Fugate that the judge may consider his stress a sign of suspicious behavior. However, due to a string of bad luck, Fugate arrived late for his court appointment, lost his appeal, and went bankrupt as a result. He later learned that Hill&#x27;s firm represented the plaintiff for the case and subsequently swore revenge on Hill for making him late. Seven years later, Fugate becomes the Clock King and dedicates his life to destroying Hill. After publicly shaming him, Fugate confronts Batman and falls to his apparent death before resurfacing in the episode &quot;Time Out of Joint&quot; to continue seeking revenge against Hill using a stolen device that allows him to manipulate time. Nevertheless, Batman and Robin foil his plans and Fugate is sent to Arkham Asylum.
** Fugate returns in the &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; episode &quot;Task Force X&quot;. Project Cadmus recruits him into the eponymous group to assist in a mission to steal the Annihilator automaton from the Justice League by acting as radio support and coordinating the mission&#x27;s timing.

<doc id="1258322" wikidata="Q477201" url="?curid=1258322" title="Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue">
<text>Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue (born 25 June 1968, nicknamed Teodorín and Teddy) is an Equatoguinean politician who has served as the first vice president of Equatorial Guinea since 22 June 2016. He is a son of Teodoro Obiang, president of Equatorial Guinea, by his wife, Constancia Mangue.

He has been appointed to numerous government positions by his father&#x27;s regime, including Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and Second Vice-President, in charge of defense and security, in May 2012. He was promoted to the position of First Vice-President in June 2016 and Ministry of National Defense and Security in 2018, and leads the country&#x27;s anti-corruption commission set up in May 2022, known as the CNPCC (Comisión Nacional de Prevención y Lucha Contra la Corrupción). Known for his lavish lifestyle, he has been the subject of a number of international criminal charges and sanctions for alleged embezzlement and corruption. His net worth is $600 million including his yacht, private jets, and luxury cars.

==Education==
Nguema studied at the École des Roches in Normandy, a French private school. He registered to attend Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, United States, for a four-term non-degree program in English as a second language. He lived lavishly at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and rarely attended class; he dropped out after only five months, reportedly at the behest of university administrators.

==Political career and international corruption cases ==
Nguema served as Adviser to the Presidency in the 1990s and subsequently as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, a post he held for about fifteen years.

It was reported in 2005 that Nguema was to be made vice president of Equatorial Guinea, which, according to the constitution, would allow him to accede to the presidency upon his father&#x27;s retirement. He was eventually elevated to the post of Second Vice-President, in charge of defense and security, on 21 May 2012, alongside former Prime Minister Ignacio Milam Tang, who was designated as First Vice-President. After four years as Second Vice-President, he was promoted to the post of First Vice-President, while remaining in charge of defense and security, on 22 June 2016; this move, which followed his father&#x27;s re-election in the April 2016 presidential election, placed him clearly in line to succeed his father.

==Spending and controversies==

As Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Nguema was paid €3,200 a month.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2004 that Nguema was &quot;a rap music entrepreneur and bon vivant, fond of Lamborghinis and long trips to Hollywood and Rio de Janeiro&quot;. Superyacht &quot;Tatoosh&quot; was hired for £400,000 by him for a Christmas cruise on which he entertained rap singer Eve.

Nguema drew criticism from the international media for spending close to R10,000,000 over a weekend in South Africa on champagne, property renovations, a black 2004 Bentley Arnage, a cream 2003 Bentley Continental R from MG Rover Cape Town and a 2005 Lamborghini Murcielago, although some assets may soon be forcibly auctioned due to his failure to pay a South African businessman. American law enforcement officials believe that most or perhaps all of his wealth comes from corruption connected to oil and gas reserves in Equatorial Guinea.

Nguema&#x27;s foreign interests include two houses in South Africa, worth a combined R50,000,000, a $31,000,000 compound in Malibu, California, US, a home on Avenue Foch in the affluent 16th arrondissement of Paris, and the hip hop music record label TNO Entertainment. In 2008 he owned one of the 30 models of the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 sports car (estimated at €1,100,000) and a Maserati MC 12 at €700,000. He went on to purchase another Bugatti Veyron, and tried to purchase a third. In late 2011, both Veyrons, as well as nine other cars he owned, were seized by French police investigating corruption. In July 2013, the confiscated goods were sold at auction.

On 19 January 2013, Nguema&#x27;s father, Teodoro Obiang, arrested Roberto Berardi, an Italian building contractor, active for 20 years in Africa. After working in Cameroon, Berardi had formed a construction company with him, but discovered some strange operations on the current account and asked for an explanation. A few hours later, the Italian contractor was arrested on charges of fraud and embezzlement. Berardi was fined 1.2 million euros and jailed. No charges were brought from Italy against Obiang. Berardi was released on 9 July 2015 after more than two years of detention.

On 18 October 2016, Swiss prosecutors opened an investigation on Nguema after he landed eight times in Geneva. French authorities had asked them for judicial assistance. He eventually reached an accommodation with the Swiss, letting them sell his seized luxury cars, valued at 18.5 million Swiss francs, and the payment of 1.3 million Swiss francs. On 27 September 2019, in an auction organised by British auctioneers Bonhams, 25 luxury cars were sold for 23.4m Swiss francs.

On 14 September 2018, Nguema flew on an official plane to Brazil with other 9 passengers and had some of their 19 bags searched by the Brazilian border police in Viracopos-Campinas International Airport. They found approximately US$1.4 million in cash and 20 watches with estimated value of US$15 million.

===Embezzlement charges===
In October 2011, seven years after the United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations exposed the Nguema&#x27;s family secret accounts at Riggs Bank in Washington and five years after non-profit Global Witness discovered his mansion purchase in Malibu; the US Justice Department went to court to seize $70 million (£44m) of his US assets, which include a Gulfstream jet, yachts, cars and Michael Jackson memorabilia.

On 11 June 2012, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) filed an amended complaint against Nguema, after a judge requested more evidence of the alleged corruption. The revised complaint states that he spent $315 million on properties and luxury goods between 2004 and 2011. According to the foreign complaint, he, while Minister of Forestry, levied personal &quot;taxes&quot; against local and foreign timber companies for licenses to operate and export timber, such as a $28.80 tax for every log exported, to fund his lavish lifestyle. The foreign prosecutors state that his expenditures &quot;were inconsistent with both his known salary of less than $100,000 per year, and the income he purportedly generated from his companies.&quot; In October 2014, he reached a settlement with the United States Department of Justice to pay the U.S. DoJ some of the funds held at accounts on his behalf, as well as his Malibu home, a Ferrari, and portions of his Michael Jackson collection, for a total estimated value of US$34 million. Upon the resolution of the settlement, he was able to keep his Gulfstream Jet, as well as some of the Michael Jackson memorabilia, including the $275,000 crystal Michael Jackson glove which he wore during his 1987–89 &quot;Bad&quot; tour, and other assets. $20 million of the proceeds was pledged, on DOJ&#x27;s website, to go to a charitable institution for the benefit of the people of Equatorial Guinea. Another $10.3 million was pledged to be used for the benefit of the people of Equatorial Guinea &quot;to the extent permitted by law.&quot; Since both of these pledges, there have been no records of the funds sent to any of the citizens, nor any of the infrastructure of Equatorial Guinea.

In February 2012, a Parisian mansion belonging to Nguema, worth around €100 million, was raided by French police and they discovered luxury goods inside worth millions of euros. In July 2012, an arrest warrant was issued for him. The mansion was seized by French authorities in August 2012. He was indicted by the French justice on several counts of corruption and money-laundering with an &#x27;in absentia&#x27; trial beginning in 2017. In response, Equatorial Guinea filed a case against France in the International Court of Justice accusing France of breaching the diplomatic immunity of its representatives and premises. In the preliminary phase the court found that France must guarantee the protection of the premises presented as housing the diplomatic mission of Equatorial Guinea in France. In December 2020 it ruled that the mansion was never a diplomatic premises.

In September 2016, the District Attorneys Roger Le Loire and Charlotte Bilger referred Nguema to the Criminal Court of Paris, and issued an arrest warrant through Interpol. This procedure was validated by the International Court of Justice in December 2016.

The French trial concluded in October 2017 with Nguema receiving a suspended sentence of three years plus a suspended fine of €30 million. His properties in France, as well as 17 luxury cars, were also seized, including the Parisian mansion.

===UK sanctions===
On 22 July 2021, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on Nguema over &quot;lavish lifestyle&quot; spending, which he spent on mansions, private jets, among other things. In retaliation, the Foreign Minister of Equatorial Guinea, Simeón Oyono Esono Angue, announced the closure of the country&#x27;s embassy in London, as the British government sanctioned Nguema. The Minister said that it was the first measure and that Equatorial Guinea &quot;will not allow interference in internal affairs&quot;.

===Brazil sanctions===
In January 2025, Brazilian authorities have charged Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, Vice President of Equatorial Guinea and son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, with money laundering. The charges stem from allegations that Obiang used embezzled public funds to purchase a $2.5 million apartment in Brazil and attempted to enter the country in 2018 with $16 million in cash and luxury items.

<doc id="1258349" wikidata="Q3113687" url="?curid=1258349" title="Hut Records">
<text>VC Recordings trading as Hut Records was a British record label brand which was started in 1990 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Virgin Records. Despite being wholly owned by a major label, it was classed as an independent label for the purposes of the UK Indie Chart due to the independent distribution, which was used by Virgin as a means of gaining exposure for new acts.

The label was managed by former Virgin retail assistant and Rough Trade label manager Dave Boyd, and it was originally set up as means of obtaining independent distribution for Moose and Revolver. Boyd persuaded the Virgin management to give the label complete creative control. Hut expanded by licensing The Smashing Pumpkins from Caroline Records, with Boyd convincing Caroline that Hut could do a better job of promoting their &quot;Gish&quot; album than Caroline&#x27;s UK arm. The next band to be signed were Verve, whose &quot;She&#x27;s a Superstar&quot; reached number one on the indie chart. Boyd&#x27;s approach was to sign &quot;quality bands and artists with attitude&quot; like These Animal Men, Smash and The Auteurs.

Hut Records was discontinued by Virgin Records in mid-2004 due to an overhaul of the group, 20% of the artists on Hut were dropped whilst the rest were moved to other labels within the EMI Group.

<doc id="1258351" wikidata="Q8009431" url="?curid=1258351" title="William Fremd High School">
<text>William Fremd High School, or Fremd (initially Palatine High School South), is a public four-year high school located in Palatine, Illinois, a northwest suburb of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. It is part of Township High School District 211, which also includes James B. Conant High School, Hoffman Estates High School, Palatine High School, and Schaumburg High School. Academically, Fremd High School has also been recognized by Newsweek as one of &quot;America&#x27;s Best High Schools&quot; and by U.S. News &amp; World Report as one of 99 outstanding high schools in the United States with the average AP test taker in the class of 2018 taking 5.4 exams. Fremd serves the portion of Palatine that is southwest of the UP NW Line railroad tracks as well as north Hoffman Estates, west Rolling Meadows, north Schaumburg, east South Barrington and southeast Inverness. Feeder schools include Plum Grove Middle School, Carl Sandburg Middle School, Walter Sundling Middle School, and Thomas Jefferson Middle School. Feeder elementary schools are Pleasant Hill, Paddock, Hunting Ridge, Central Road, Willow Bend, Thomas Jefferson, Marion Jordan, Fairview, and Frank C. Whiteley.

==History==
Fremd opened in 1961 as &quot;Palatine High School South&quot;. The school was later named after William Fremd who had been a member of the high school board of education for over 30 years and had served on school boards in the area for a consecutive period of more than 45 years. Fremd donated the land for the school. In the first yearbook the school was said to &#x27;blend and stretch into the cornfields&#x27;. The school was the second high school to be built in Palatine, Illinois after Palatine High School. Palatine South and then Fremd originally served as the school for all Palatine freshman and sophomores while Palatine High School was the school for juniors and seniors. This plan was only in effect for three years before Fremd was expanded to serve as a 4 year high school. In the fall of 1966 the first junior class entered, and they became the first Fremd graduating class in 1968. Then Junior Cathy Klep designed the Viking logo, based on the Minnesota Vikings logo. Junior, Colleen McGrath designed the school crest, incorporating the Viking logo and modeled after her family crest. A school motto was adopted in 1995 after a contest for students. Sophomore Jessica Frank won the contest. In 2001, construction began to create a new science wing. The courtyard which stood in the center of the school was demolished. After two years of year-round construction, the new science wing was built along with a heating and ventilation facility on the roof of the building.

In the early 2000s, Fremd underwent several construction projects, including the replacement of bleachers in the main gymnasium, renovated tiling, and additional classrooms. The music department added a rehearsal room, larger practice rooms with more advanced sound-proof walls, and increased storage space. In the newest addition to the school, a synthetic turf football field was added. In 2016, a new pool facility was added to Fremd.

On November 2, 2015, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the federal government determined that Fremd&#x27;s administration violated anti-discrimination laws because &quot;it did not allow a transgender student who identifies as a girl and participates on a girls’ sports team to change and shower in the girls’ locker room without restrictions.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; added that the student in question &quot;identifies as female but was born male.&quot;

<doc id="1258352" wikidata="Q8022656" url="?curid=1258352" title="Wilma Deering">
<text>Wilma Deering is a fictional character featured in the various iterations of Buck Rogers which have spanned many media over the years.

Through all the versions of Buck Rogers, Wilma Deering has maintained some clear characteristics. She is a sometimes-romantic interest for Buck, always a loyal defender of Earth, and an attractive and smart woman. She is generally depicted as brave with a penchant for getting herself into trouble. As with other science fiction heroines from the pulp science fiction genre and others, she has sometimes been depicted as a damsel in distress but more often as an assertive adventurer. In this way, her character resembles that of Dale Arden of the Flash Gordon comic books and movie serials, and also the character Lois Lane from Superman.

==Pulp origins==
Wilma Deering appears in the very first Buck Rogers story, the novella &quot;Armageddon 2419 A.D.&quot; (1928), and the basic elements are present. She is depicted as adventurous, heroic and beautiful, and a romantic interest for the hero.

==Comic strip==
Wilma features in the Buck Rogers comic strip from its inception, as she is the first person of Earth to meet Buck when he awakens in the 25th century. Depicted from the start as a love interest, Wilma is initially almost a stock character heroine just as Dr. Elias Huer is a stock &quot;brainy scientist&quot;. However, her character does develop over time into the more familiar spunky adventurer.

==1939 serial==
The character Wilma Deering was featured in the 1939 Buck Rogers movie serial which starred Buster Crabbe. The role of Wilma was portrayed by Constance Moore, in what would come to be her first highly recognized film role. In the serial, Buck Rogers and Buddy Wade awaken in the 25th century to find out that the world has been taken over by the outlaw army of Killer Kane. Along with Wilma Deering, who is a lieutenant in this incarnation, Buck and Buddy join in the fight to overthrow Kane with the help of Prince Tallen of Saturn and his forces. In this serial, Wilma is essentially the faithful sidekick, and her relationship with Dr. Huer is akin to that of a daughter.

==1950 series==
Lou Prentis played Wilma Deering in the 1950 ABC series.

==1979 movie and series==
Colonel Wilma Deering was portrayed by actress/model Erin Gray in the 1979 movie and subsequent NBC television series &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;. Initially, Wilma was depicted as a cold, aloof military officer and starfighter pilot, with little interest in Captain Rogers. However, she quickly warmed to him and, throughout the weekly series, Wilma Deering&#x27;s character became warmer, sexier and more humorous. Often, it was Wilma who came to the rescue of Buck, as opposed to the other way round. Erin Gray has commented that her role as Colonel Deering was an inspiration for many women who watched the program, particularly with regard to careers in the military. She also commented that she was aware of the highly sexualised one-piece uniform she wore and its effect on the show&#x27;s male audience. She was once described by Clive James as Wonder Woman with brains.

Revisions to the program in its second season changed Wilma from the central role of a colonel directing Earth&#x27;s space defense, to more of a co-pilot role on the spaceship &quot;Searcher&quot;. This change was never entirely explained, but along with Buck and Twiki, hers was the only character viewed central enough to migrate to the revamped series.

After the release of the film in 1979, Erin Gray initially opted not to reprise the role for the weekly television series and actress Juanin Clay was cast in the role. However, Gray then decided she would continue with the role. Clay appeared in an episode of the series as Major Marla Landers, a Wilma Deering-type character, in the episode &quot;Vegas in Space&quot; (1979).

==Buck Rogers XXV roleplaying game==
The character Wilma Deering in the Buck Rogers roleplaying game is a more dystopic figure, in keeping with the themes of the game.

In the role playing game, Wilma is a native of the Chicagorg Arcology on Earth, and is described as an 8th level Terran warrior and a freedom fighter. Both her parents were killed by RAM, the evil organization that runs the corrupt Earth government in the game. Her biography indicates she was imprisoned for attacking RAM installations, and escaped later becoming a privateer. After several months, Wilma returned to Earth to officially join NEO, the rebel organization, and resumed her effort to free her home world from RAM.

This version of Wilma is a tall woman with strawberry blonde hair and an explosive temper, and once again is both a foil and love interest for Buck Rogers.

==&quot;Buck Rogers: A Life in the Future&quot;==
Another incarnation of Wilma Deering appears in the novel &quot;Buck Rogers: A Life in the Future&quot; (1995) by Martin Caidin. This version of Deering is said to be a top pilot in the Space Corps, and continues the tradition of falling in love with the time-displaced test pilot, Buck Rogers.

<doc id="1258354" wikidata="Q16203290" url="?curid=1258354" title="Grace Marks">
<text>Grace Marks (c. 1828 – after c. 1873) was an Irish-Canadian maid who was involved in the 1843 murder of her employer Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery, in Richmond Hill, Ontario. Her conviction for the murder of Kinnear was controversial and sparked much debate about whether Marks was actually instrumental in the murder or merely an unwitting accessory. Marks was the subject of Margaret Atwood&#x27;s historical fiction novel &quot;Alias Grace&quot; and its adaptations in other media.

==Early life==
Marks was born and raised in Ulster, Ireland. Her father, John Marks, was a stonemason and an abusive alcoholic. She, along with her parents and eight siblings, immigrated to Upper Canada in 1840, when Grace was twelve. Her mother died on the ship en route to Canada and was buried at sea.

==Murders==
Marks was employed as a maid in the house of Yonge Street farmer Thomas Kinnear, who was in a sexual relationship with his housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery. In July 1843, Kinnear and Montgomery were murdered by James McDermott, a servant. Kinnear was shot and Montgomery, who was pregnant at the time of her death, was hit on the head with an axe and subsequently strangled before being dismembered and hidden under a large tub. Under the alias &quot;Mary Whitney&quot;, Marks fled with McDermott to the U.S., but they were apprehended in Lewiston, New York, and deported to Toronto. It remains unclear whether Marks took part in the double murder.

Marks was tried with McDermott for the murder of Kinnear. A trial for Montgomery&#x27;s murder was to follow, but was deemed unnecessary as both defendants were convicted of Kinnear&#x27;s murder and sentenced to death. Before McDermott was hanged, he insisted that Marks was, &quot;an evil genius who masterminded the double murder, then feigned mental illness in order to avoid the gallows&quot;. Marks&#x27;s sentence, however, was commuted to life in prison which she served in Kingston Penitentiary. At one period (May 4, 1852 – August 18, 1853) she was committed to an asylum but was later returned to Kingston Penitentiary. In 1872, after almost thirty years of incarceration, Marks was pardoned and moved to upstate New York. After that she disappeared from the historical record.

==Popular portrayal==
What is known of Marks on the historical record comes primarily from Susanna Moodie&#x27;s book &quot;Life in the Clearings Versus the Bush&quot;. She is the subject of Margaret Atwood&#x27;s historical fiction novel &quot;Alias Grace&quot; and played by Sarah Gadon in the 2017 television adaptation directed by Mary Harron. &quot;Alias Grace&quot; was adapted for the stage by Jennifer Blackmer and premiered at the Rivendell Theater in Chicago on September 1, 2017.

<doc id="1258356" wikidata="Q493675" url="?curid=1258356" title="Gunship (video game)">
<text>Gunship is a combat flight simulation video game developed and published by MicroProse in 1986. In the game, controlling a simulated AH-64 Apache helicopter, players navigate through missions to attack enemy targets and protect friendly forces. Commercially and critically successful, &quot;Gunship&quot; was followed by &quot;Gunship 2000&quot; and &quot;Gunship!&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The game features missions in five regions, including the U.S. (training), Southeast Asia (1st Air Cavalry Division), Central America (82nd Airborne Division), Middle East (101st Airborne Division) and Western Europe (3rd Armored Division). After selection of region, style, and enemies, the pilot is assigned a primary mission and a secondary mission. These could include such objectives as &quot;Destroy enemy headquarters&quot; or &quot;Support friendly troops&quot; (i.e. destroy targets near friendly forces). The latter would be an easier mission, because the battle would be fought closer to friendly lines.

The pilot then arms the Apache helicopter gunship, usually selecting AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles (guided missiles that destroy &quot;hard&quot; targets such as bunkers and tanks), FFARs (Folding Fin Aerial Rockets; unguided rockets that destroy &quot;soft&quot; targets such as infantry and installations), and HEDP (High-Explosive, Dual-Purpose) rounds for the 30 mm cannon (an all-purpose weapon with a maximum range of 1.5 km); in Central America, the Middle East, and Western Europe, AIM-9 Sidewinders would also be standard equipment, usually as a backup air-to-air weapon in case of cannon failure.

Patient players might move in short jumps, crouching behind hills to block the enemy&#x27;s line of sight and suddenly popping up to attack. More aggressive players generally fly fast and erratically to evade enemy fire, flying in low to deliver devastating cannon attacks at close range. Since flight time is a component of the mission evaluation, either method has its advantages. The latter, however, can be rather dangerous against 1st Line enemies whose fast reaction times can cause the chopper to be pummelled with relentless fire.

Most enemy fire, especially small caliber, is deflected by armor, but some will cause systems damage. After enough damaging hits, the structural integrity will fail, causing a general power failure that requires the pilot to use autorotation to land safely. An emergency landing by a seriously injured pilot in enemy territory causes him to become Missing in Action. If the pilot lands without serious injury, he can escape back to base and live to fight another day.

There is no defined time limit in the game. A player can return to any number of Forward Area Resupply Points to be rearmed, refueled and damage repaired. Returning to the Home Base will end the mission. Ideally, the pilot completes both missions, knocks out other targets, and makes it back to base within 20 minutes.

There is no ending to &quot;Gunship&quot;. Promotions stop once a pilot makes Colonel, although he can continue amassing medals, such as the Purple Heart, Air Medal, Bronze Star, Silver Star, Distinguished Service Cross, and the Medal of Honor and retire with a final promotion to Brig. General. No medals in this game are prerequisites for earning others (the requirement of shooting down two Hinds in one mission for the Medal of Honor led some to believe that it was not possible to earn it before earning lower medals). Repeated medals are harder to earn than the first one. The criteria for winning medals is based on types of targets destroyed, number of targets destroyed, objectives met, time elapsed, and sometimes whether or not the pilot is wounded. As in real life, medals in this game can be awarded posthumously.

==Development and release==
MicroProse intended &quot;Gunship&quot; to simulate an urban helicopter akin to &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;, but found that city graphics were too difficult. It instead used tools developed for &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle&quot; to create another military simulation. The game was released in 1986 for the PC DOS, Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, FM Towns, MSX, PC-98, Sharp X68000, and ZX Spectrum.

&quot;Gunship&quot; was also ported to the Sega Genesis by U.S. Gold only in Europe in 1993. However, this version of the game differed from the others by featuring more arcade-style gameplay and horizontal shoot &#x27;em up stages.

==Reception==

&quot;Gunship&quot; was MicroProse&#x27;s third best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987. By 1989, &quot;Gunship&quot;″s sales had surpassed 500,000 units.

&quot;Info&quot; magazine gave &quot;Gunship&quot; for the Commodore 64 five stars out of five, describing it as &quot;without qualification, the best combat flight simulator ever released for an 8-bit computer!&quot; Praising its graphics, weapons, sound, controls, physics, and documentation, the magazine concluded that it was &quot;PRIME!&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated &quot;this reviewer heartily recommends &quot;Gunship&quot; ... A five-star rating (my highest) is well-deserved.&quot; In a 1994 survey of wargames the magazine gave the title three stars out of five, stating that &quot;When initially released, this was THE helicopter simulation&quot;.

&quot;Gunship&quot; received the Origins Award for &quot;Best Screen Graphics in a Home Computer Game of 1986&quot;. It won the award for best simulation game of the year according to the readers of &quot;Crash&quot;. In 1987, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; named &quot;Gunship&quot; as its action game of the year, in 1988 the game joined the magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame for games highly rated over time by readers, and in 1996, the magazine ranked it as the 102nd best game of all time.

==Legacy==
A follow-up game, &quot;Gunship 2000&quot;, was released by MicroProse for several platforms between 1991 and 1996. Its successor, &quot;Gunship!&quot;, followed in 2000 for Microsoft Windows only.

<doc id="1258358" wikidata="Q531408" url="?curid=1258358" title="Koçi Xoxe">
<text>Koçi Xoxe (pronounced ; 1 May 1911 – 11 June 1949) was an Albanian politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior of the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania. He was supported by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito during efforts to bring Albania into the Yugoslav federation. After Albania&#x27;s leader, Enver Hoxha, established the country&#x27;s independence with the support of the Soviet Union, Xoxe was arrested, tortured and executed.

==Life==
Xoxe was born in 1911 in Negovan, near Florina in Greece, back then part of the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. Negovan (today &quot;Flampouro&quot;/) had a majority of Orthodox Albanians, many of whom sided with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and a minority of Aromanians (Vlachs). His descent is disputed, however, it is believed that Xoxe was of Tosk Albanian descent. According to other sources, Xoxe was purportedly of Bulgarian or Macedonian origin, as suggested by some Slavic authors. However, there is limited evidence to support these claims.

Around 1937 he emerged among others, such as Enver Hoxha and Koço Tashko, as prominent communists of Albania.

In the post-World War II era, Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito sought to exert his country’s influence over Albania through military support to Hoxha in an attempt to absorb Albania. Xoxe, who headed the Ministry of the Interior and the secret police, the Sigurimi, was supported by Tito. Joseph Stalin reportedly told Milovan Djilas, a leading figure in Yugoslavia, that Yugoslavia should “swallow up” Albania.

Hoxha began to fear Xoxe as a rival to his own power. After Xoxe ordered the arrest of moderates with anti-Yugoslav sentiments, including Sejfulla Malëshova, Tito attacked Hoxha in a letter to the Albanian Politburo. Hoxha responded by traveling to Moscow with Nako Spiru and returned with a formal trade agreement with the Soviet Union without consulting Tito.

Tito began to develop a more assertive policy towards the Soviets, which angered Stalin. Over time, Stalin began to side with Albania as a supportive bulwark against Tito. The Soviet Union began to increase Moscow’s presence in the country, spending specialists in mining and oil refining. Xoxe accused Spiru of subversion and, eventually, Spiru was found dead of a gunshot wound in his apartment under suspicious circumstances.

Tito planned to send two army divisions into Albania under the pretense of protecting it from a Greek invasion, a move that angered Moscow. He then pushed Xoxe to convene a meeting of the Central Committee where he expelled Hoxha’s supporters and pushed a motion to combine Albania’s economy and military with Yugoslavia’s. Hoxha fought back with Soviet support and cancelled his agreements with Yugoslavia and expelled the country’s advisors. Xoxe attempted to save himself by declaring his support for the Soviet Union and arresting supporters of Tito in the government. The Central Committee, however, flipped on Xoxe, stripping him of his posts and expelling him from the party. In November 1948, he and many others were arrested.

The Soviets wanted to paint Tito as the mastermind of anti-Marxist and anti-Albanian activities with the trials of Xoxe and the others. Xoxe was tortured in prison repeatedly until he confessed to conspiring with Tito against the Albanian government. In May 1949, he was placed on trial where he confessed to having been recruited by Zog I of Albania, as well as British intelligence and that Tito was an agent of the west. Xoxe was sentenced to death and was hanged on June 11, 1949.

<text>Morningside University is a private university affiliated with the United Methodist Church and located in Sioux City, Iowa, United States. Founded in 1894 by the Methodist Episcopal Church, Morningside University has 21 buildings on a campus in Sioux City (area population 143,157 in 2008). The Morningside College Historic District, which includes most of the campus, is on the National Register of Historic Places. Morningside College officially became Morningside University on June 1, 2021.

==History==
A group of Sioux City business leaders and Methodist ministers established the University of the Northwest in 1889 to provide educational, cultural and economic growth in the community. The location of the campus was the northern section of the farm of Edwin C. Peters, the founder of the suburb of Morningside. The university was plagued with financial problems, and it became a victim of the financial Panic of 1893. It closed in 1894, the same year that the Methodist Episcopal Church incorporated Morningside College and took over the campus. Charles City College in Charles City, Iowa, was a German Methodist college that was absorbed into Morningside College in 1914.

===Historic district===
Part of the campus has been set aside in 1997 as a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At the time of its nomination it contained 26 resources, which included nine contributing buildings, one contributing site, five contributing objects, nine non-contributing buildings, and one non-contributing object. The focus of the district is a broad hilltop that overlooks the Missouri River valley. Charles City College Hall (1890), Lewis Hall (1900), the Vice President&#x27;s House (pre-1914), Hickman-Johnson-Furrow Library (1914), Lillian Dimmitt House (1921), Dimmitt Residence Hall (1926), Jones Hall of Science (1948), Alice Gymnasium (1949), Roadman Hall (1953), and O&#x27;Donoghue Observatory (1953) are the contributing buildings. The contributing objects are The Spoonholder (1908), a curved cement bench with footpad and backrest; Class of 1922 Sundial; and the three Harmony Lane Lampposts.

This is the largest concentration of educational buildings in Sioux City, and it also contains some of the best examples of Richardsonian Romanesque, Italianate, and Moderne architecture in the city. The district is also linked to the Morningside neighborhood, which was developed as a streetcar suburb. When the University of the Northwest was being developed, there was a conscious effort to pattern it and the neighborhood after Northwestern University and Evanston, Illinois.

==Athletics==
The Morningside athletic teams are called the Mustangs (formerly known as the &quot;Maroon Chiefs&quot;). The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC) since the 2003–04 academic year. The Mustangs previously competed as an NAIA Independent during the 2002–03 school year; and in the defunct North Central Conference (NCC) from 1922–23 to 2001–02, which was affiliated in the NCAA Division II ranks.

Morningside competes in 27 intercollegiate varsity sports: men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball and wrestling; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading, dance and eSports.

===Accomplishments===
The Mustangs women&#x27;s basketball team won back-to-back NAIA Division II National Championships in 2004 and 2005. They also won the National Championship in 2009 with an undefeated 38–0 record. Most recently, the Mustangs won the NAIA Division II Women&#x27;s Basketball National Championship in 2015 with a 37–1 record. Morningside&#x27;s Jake Stevenson won the NAIA Wrestling Championship in 2007, and John Sievert won the Championship in 2013. The football team was coached from 1948–1950 by Pro Football Hall of Fame coach George Allen.

The 2018, 2019, and 2021 Morningside Mustangs football teams had undefeated seasons and won NAIA national championships. The Morningside Mustangs dance team won their first national title in 2022. The dance team also set a national record for highest score at a dance nationals with a 92.31.

==Student life==
Morningside University is on a campus in the residential neighborhood of Morningside in Sioux City, Iowa. Student organizations include: student government, honor societies, service groups, religious organizations, musical ensembles, student publications, and three national fraternities ( Alpha Omicron Pi women&#x27;s sorority, Delta Sigma Phi fraternity, and Acacia). The campus is also home to two nationally renowned music fraternities, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia (men&#x27;s) and Mu Phi Epsilon (co-ed nationally, but strictly women for this campus). Morningside&#x27;s Department of Mass Communications has a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Collegian Reporter&quot;, it shares a public-access television cable TV as MCTV, and operates a radio station 24 hours a day at 92.9 on the FM dial, KMSC, Fusion 93.

===Residence halls===

Dimmitt Hall is the third oldest building on campus. It was named for Lillian Dimmitt, the 26-year Dean of Women. Roadman Hall was built in the mid twentieth century. It houses about 150 students. The dormitory is named after Earl Roadman, president of the college from 1936 to 1956. In 2005, two apartment-style dormitories opened for upperclassmen, the Waitt and Poppen Halls. Lags Hall, a third apartment-style facility, was added in 2007.

===Additions since 2005===

In 2005, the Hickman Johnson Furrow Library was renovated and a central campus green space and new maintenance facilities were built for $26 million.

The first addition came in the form of the central campus Hilker Green Space, which opened in 2007. The space is designed as a split-level area featuring the grand two-level Lieder Family Fountain. Walkways and a access path cut through the upper-lawn making their way by Lewis Hall connecting the Hickman Johnson Furrow Learning and Olsen Student Centers. Near Eppley Auditorium, the Buhler Outdoor Performance Center was built.

A softball complex was added in Fall 2005.

<text>A cervical fracture, commonly called a broken neck, is a fracture of any of the seven cervical vertebrae in the neck. Examples of common causes in humans are traffic collisions and diving into shallow water. Abnormal movement of neck bones or pieces of bone can cause a spinal cord injury, resulting in loss of sensation, paralysis, or usually death soon thereafter (~1 min.), primarily via compromising neurological supply to the respiratory muscles and innervation to the heart.

==Causes==

Considerable force is needed to cause a cervical fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common causes. A severe, sudden twist to the neck or a severe blow to the head or neck area can cause a cervical fracture.

Although high energy trauma is often associated with cervical fractures in the younger population, low energy trauma is more common in the geriatric population. In a study from Norway the most common cause was falls and the relative incidence of cervical spine fracture increased significantly with age.

Sports that involve violent physical contact carry a risk of cervical fracture, including American football, association football (especially the goalkeeper), ice hockey, rugby, and wrestling. Spearing an opponent in football or rugby, for instance, can cause a broken neck. Cervical fractures may also be seen in some non-contact sports, such as gymnastics, skiing, diving, surfing, powerlifting, equestrianism, mountain biking, and motor racing.

Certain penetrating neck injuries can also cause cervical fracture which can also cause internal bleeding among other complications.

Execution by hanging is intended to cause a fatal cervical fracture. The knot in the noose is placed to the left of the condemned, so that at the end of the drop, the head is jolted sharply upwards and to the right. The force breaks the neck, causing an immediate loss of consciousness and death within a few minutes.

==Diagnosis==


===Physical examination===

A medical history and physical examination can be sufficient in clearing the cervical spine. Notable clinical prediction rules to determine which patients need medical imaging are Canadian C-spine rule and the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS).

===Choice of medical imaging===
* In &quot;children&quot;, a CT scan of the neck is indicated in more severe cases such as neurologic deficits, whereas X-ray is preferable in milder cases, by both US and UK guidelines. Swedish guidelines recommend CT rather than X-ray in all children over the age of 5.
* In &quot;adults&quot;, UK guidelines are largely similar as in children. US guidelines, on the other hand, recommend CT in all cases where medical imaging is indicated, and that X-ray is only acceptable where CT is not readily available.

===Radiographic detection===
On CT scan or X-ray, a cervical fracture may be directly visualized. In addition, indirect signs of injury by the vertebral column are incongruities of the vertebral lines, and/or increased thickness of the prevertebral space:

===Classification===

There are proper names for several types of cervical fractures, including:
* Fracture of &quot;C1&quot;, including Jefferson fracture
* Fracture of &quot;C2&quot;, including Hangman&#x27;s fracture
* Flexion teardrop fracture – a fracture of the anteroinferior aspect of a cervical vertebra

The AO Foundation has developed a descriptive system for cervical fractures, the &quot;AOSpine subaxial cervical spine fracture classification system&quot;.

===Surgery indication===
The indication to surgically stabilize a cervical fracture can be estimated from the &quot;Subaxial Injury Classification&quot; (SLIC). In this system, a score of 3 or less indicates that conservative management is appropriate, a score of 5 or more indicates that surgery is needed, and a score of 4 is equivocal. The score is the sum from 3 different categories: morphology, discs and ligaments, and neurology:

==Treatment==
Complete immobilization of the head and neck should be done as early as possible and before moving the patient. Immobilization should remain in place until movement of the head and neck is proven safe. &quot;In the presence of severe head trauma, cervical fracture must be presumed until ruled out.&quot; Immobilization is imperative to minimize or prevent further spinal cord injury. The only exceptions are when there is imminent danger from an external cause, such as becoming trapped in a burning building.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Aspirin or Ibuprofen, are contraindicated because they interfere with bone healing. Paracetamol is a better option. Patients with cervical fractures will likely be prescribed medication for pain control.

In the long term, physical therapy will be given to build strength in the muscles of the neck to increase stability and better protect the cervical spine.

Collars, traction and surgery can be used to immobilize and stabilize the neck after a cervical fracture.

===Cervical collar===
Minor fractures can be immobilized with a cervical collar without need for traction or surgery. A soft collar is fairly flexible and is the least limiting but can carry a high risk of further neck damage in patients with osteoporosis. It can be used for minor injuries or after healing has allowed the neck to become more stable.

A range of manufactured rigid collars are also used, usually comprising a firm plastic bi-valved shell secured with Velcro straps and removable padded liners. The most frequently prescribed are the Aspen, Malibu, Miami J, and Philadelphia collars. All these can be used with additional chest and head extension pieces to increase stability.

===Rigid braces===
Rigid braces that support the head and chest are also prescribed. Examples include the Sterno-Occipital Mandibular Immobilization Device (SOMI), Lerman Minerva and Yale types. Special patients, such as very young children or non-cooperative adults, are sometimes still immobilized in medical plaster of paris casts, such as the Minerva cast.

===Traction===
Traction can be applied by free weights on a pulley or a halo type brace. The halo brace is the most rigid cervical brace, used when limiting motion to the minimum that is essential, especially with unstable cervical fractures. It can provide stability and support during the time (typically 8–12 weeks) needed for the cervical bones to heal.

===Surgery===
Surgery may be needed to stabilize the neck and relieve pressure on the spinal cord. A variety of surgeries are available depending on the injury. Surgery to remove a damaged intervertebral disc may be done to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. The discs are cushions between the vertebrae. After the disc is removed, the vertebrae may be fused together to provide stability. Metal plates, screws, or wires may be needed to hold vertebrae or pieces in place.

==History==
Arab physician and surgeon Ibn al-Quff (d. 1286 CE) described a treatment of cervical fractures through the oral route in his book &quot;Kitab al-ʿUmda fı Ṣinaʿa al-Jiraḥa&quot; (Book of Basics in the Art of Surgery).

<text>The Mouse That Roared is a 1955 satirical novel by Irish writer Leonard Wibberley, which launched a series of satirical books about an imaginary country in Europe called the Duchy of Grand Fenwick. Wibberley used the premise to make commentaries about modern politics and world situations, including the nuclear arms race, nuclear weapons in general, and the politics of the United States.

The novel originally appeared as a six-part serial in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; from 25 December 1954 through 29 January 1955, under the title &quot;The Day New York Was Invaded&quot;. It was published as a book in February 1955 by Little, Brown. The British edition used the author&#x27;s original intended title, The Wrath of Grapes, a play on John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.

Wibberley wrote one prequel (1958&#x27;s &quot;Beware of the Mouse&quot;) and three sequels: &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot; (1962), &quot;The Mouse on Wall Street&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Mouse That Saved the West&quot; (1981). Each placed the tiny Duchy of Grand Fenwick in a series of absurd situations in which it faced superpowers and won.

==Plot==
The tiny (three miles by five miles) European Duchy of Grand Fenwick, located in the Alps between Switzerland and France, proudly retains a pre-industrial economy, dependent almost entirely on making Pinot Grand Fenwick wine. However, a California winery makes a knockoff version, &quot;Pinot Grand Enwick&quot;, putting the country on the verge of bankruptcy.

The prime minister decides that their only course of action is to declare war on the United States. Expecting a quick and total defeat (since their standing army is tiny and equipped with bows and arrows), the country confidently expects to rebuild itself through the largesse that the United States bestows on all its vanquished enemies (as it did for Germany through the Marshall Plan at the end of World War II).

With the counterfeit wine as a &quot;casus belli&quot;, they send a formal written declaration of war, but this is misplaced by the United States Department of State. Receiving no response, the Duchy is forced to muster some troops and hire a ship to stage an actual invasion.

Landing in New York City, almost completely deserted above ground because of a citywide disaster drill, the Duchy&#x27;s invading &quot;army&quot; (composed of the Field Marshal Tully Bascomb, three men-at-arms, and 20 longbowmen) wanders to a top secret government lab and unintentionally captures the &quot;Quadium Bomb&quot; (a prototype doomsday device that could destroy the world if triggered) and its maker, Dr. Kokintz, an absent-minded professor who is working through the drill. This &quot;Q-Bomb&quot; has a theoretical explosive potential greater than all the nuclear weapons of the United States and the Soviet Union combined.

The invaders from Fenwick are sighted by a civil defence squad and are immediately taken to be &quot;men from Mars&quot; when their chain mail is mistaken for reptilian skin. The United States Secretary of Defense pieces together what has happened (with help from the five lines in his encyclopedia on The Duchy of Grand Fenwick and the Fenwickian flag left behind on a flagpole) and is both ashamed and astonished that the United States was unaware that it had been at war for two months.

With the most powerful bomb in the world now in the smallest country in the world, other countries are quick to react, with the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom offering their support. With the world at the tiny country&#x27;s mercy, Duchess Gloriana, the leader of Grand Fenwick, lists her terms: all the nuclear weapons of the powerful nations must go through an inspection by impartial scientists. Continued inspection of the continuing nuclear programs of the world powers will be supervised by Dr. Kokintz, who recalls his identity as a Fenwick-American and accepts repatriation to his ancestral home. Kokintz takes on his new role as scientific director of the &quot;Tiny Twenty&quot;, a new superpower of 20 of the world&#x27;s smallest nations headed by Grand Fenwick. The United States and the other world powers accept these humiliating terms, leading to hope for world peace.

As a celebration of the triumphant outcome of the war, Duchess Gloriana and Tully Bascomb are united in marriage. As a sequel to the marriage, Dr. Kokintz accidentally drops the Q-Bomb onto the stone floor of the Grand Fenwick castle dungeon. As a result of this mishap, the scientific director inadvertently discovers that the Q-bomb is, and always has been, a powerless dud. The book concludes with Kokintz deciding to keep this key fact to himself.

==Background==
Wibberley got the idea from the US peace treaty negotiated with Japan by John Foster Dulles, which included generous amounts of aid to Japan. He wrote an article for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; which suggested that his native Ireland make a token invasion of the US to get aid. He then developed this into a novel changing Ireland to the Duchy of Grand Fenwick.

==Reception==

Anthony Boucher praised the novel as &quot;utterly delightful...a very nearly perfect book, on no account to be missed.&quot;

== Adaptations ==

=== Film adaptation ===

&quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot; was made into a 1959 film starring Peter Sellers in three roles: Duchess Gloriana XII; Count Rupert Mountjoy, the Prime Minister; and Tully Bascomb, the military leader – and Jean Seberg, as Helen Kokintz, as an added love interest. Other cast members included: William Hartnell as Sergeant-at-Arms Will Buckley; David Kossoff as Professor Alfred Kokintz; Leo McKern as Benter the opposition leader; MacDonald Parke as General Snippet; and Austin Willis as the United States Secretary of Defense. In 1963, a sequel, based on &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot;, was released.

=== Stage adaptation ===
&quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot; was adapted for the stage by Christopher Sergel in 1963. The play portrays Duchess Gloriana XII as twenty-two years old, as in Wibberley&#x27;s novel. In this version, Dr. Kokintz is a physics professor at Columbia University and the arrival of Tully Bascomb&#x27;s invasion force coincides with a campus student protest. Thus, the Fenwick soldiers are mistaken for being eccentric protesters rather than as foreign invaders.

=== Television pilot ===

In 1964, Jack Arnold produced a television pilot based on the film, with Sid Caesar playing the three roles that Sellers had played, but it was not picked up for production.

=== Radio adaptation===
BBC Radio 4 broadcast a one-hour adaptation on 15 February 2003 and 22 May 2010 as part of its &quot;Saturday Play&quot; series. The production was directed by Patrick Rayner and starred Julie Austin as Gloriana, Mark McDonnell (who co-adapted the book for radio) as Tully, Crawford Logan as Count Montjoy, Simon Tait as Dr. Kokintz and Steven McNicoll (who also co-adapted the book) as Mr. Benter.

<text>In mathematics, the Scott core theorem is a theorem about the finite presentability of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds due to G. Peter Scott, . The precise statement is as follows:

Given a 3-manifold (not necessarily compact) with finitely generated fundamental group, there is a compact three-dimensional submanifold, called the compact core or Scott core, such that its inclusion map induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. In particular, this means a finitely generated 3-manifold group is finitely presentable.

A simplified proof is given in , and a stronger uniqueness statement is proven in .

<text>Donald Edward Machholz (October 7, 1952 – August 9, 2022) was an American amateur astronomer who was credited with the discovery of 12 comets that bear his name. 

== Personal life and death ==
In 2014, he married photojournalist Michele Machholz. They resided at the Stargazer Ranch in Wikieup, Arizona. 

Machholz died in the early morning of August 9, 2022, at his home in Wikieup, Arizona, from complications of COVID-19. His obituary at &quot;Astronomy&quot; stated, &quot;In the years leading up to his death, Machholz was considered the most prolific visual comet discoverer alive.&quot;
==Career==
He spent more than 9,000 hours comet hunting in a career spanning over 50 years. These comets include the periodic comets 96P/Machholz, 141P/Machholz, the non-periodic C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) that were visible with binoculars in the northern sky in 2004 and 2005, C/2010 F4 (Machholz), and C/2018 V1 (Machholz-Fujikawa-Iwamoto) In 1985, comet Machholz 1985-e, was discovered using a homemade cardboard telescope with a wide aperture, 10 inches across, that gave it a broader field of view than most commercial telescopes. Machholz utilized a variety of methods in his comet discoveries, in 1986 using 29×130 binoculars he discovered 96P/Machholz.

Machholz was one of the inventors of the Messier Marathon, which is a race to observe all the Messier objects in a single night.

Asteroid 245983 Machholz, discovered by Kazimieras Černis, was named in honor of Machholz in November 2017.

<doc id="1258387" wikidata="Q1201909" url="?curid=1258387" title="Metal Hero Series">
<text>The is a metaseries of tokusatsu superhero TV series produced by Toei for Japanese television.

The protagonists of the &quot;Metal Hero Series&quot; are mainly space, military and police-based characters who are typically either androids, cyborgs, or humans wearing metallic armored suits. Henceforth, most of the Metal Heroes are also referenced as another example of the &quot;Henshin (transforming) Heroes&quot; genre. Usually, the genre revolves around a technological theme where technology, in the right hands, can be used for the greater good.

The shows were produced by Toei from 1982 through 1999 in conjunction with their other Tokusatsu superhero shows, &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; and &quot;Super Sentai&quot;. Initially only 1991 &quot;Janperson&quot; and the series released between 1985 and 1989 (&quot;Juspion&quot;, &quot;Spielban&quot;, &quot;Metalder&quot;, &quot;Jiraiya&quot; and &quot;Jiban&quot;) were considered part of the &quot;Metal Hero&quot; franchise while &quot;Gavan&quot;, &quot;Sharivan&quot; and &quot;Shaider&quot; were part of the &quot;Space Sheriff&quot; franchise and &quot;Winspector&quot;, &quot;Solbrain&quot; and &quot;Exceedraft&quot; were part of the &quot;Rescue Police&quot; franchise. It was only in late-1990s that Toei Company incorporated the &quot;Space Sheriff&quot; and &quot;Rescue Police&quot; trilogies as subseries of the &quot;Metal Hero&quot;. &quot;Blue SWAT&quot;, &quot;B-Fighter&quot;, &quot;B-Fighter Kabuto&quot;, &quot;Kabutack&quot; and &quot;Robotack&quot; were also incorporated into the franchise afterwards.

In addition to Japan, they are also popular in France, Brazil, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. During the 1990s, Saban Entertainment used some of the shows to produce programs similar to their &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series. Some of the &quot;Metal Hero Series&quot; even spawned such sequels which followed the continuity of the previous shows, resulting in the genre developing sub-categories based mainly on space, military and police-related characters.

During the 1990s, Saban adapted &quot;Metal Hero Series&quot; shows for American audiences; stock footage from &quot;Metalder&quot;, &quot;Spielvan&quot; and &quot;Shaider&quot; was used in &quot;VR Troopers&quot; (1994–1996), and footage from both &quot;B-Fighter&quot; series was later used in &quot;Big Bad Beetleborgs&quot;. Both shows ran for two seasons. As of 2018, Discotek Media has licensed Juspion for release marking the first release of the Metal Heroes in the US. Both &quot;Jiraiya&quot; and &quot;Gavan&quot; were used for the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise with Jiraiya as Sheriff Skyfire in &quot;Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel&quot; and Gavan as Captain Chaku in &quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot;.

=== Philippines ===
&quot;&quot; was greenlighted by Toei as a sequel to &quot;Shaider&quot;, with characters who are descendants of those in the original series. Toei later halted production, instead authorizing a spin-off series set 20 years after the end of &quot;Shaider&quot;.

==Current status==
Other similar heroes, such as &quot;Nebula Mask Machine Man&quot;, &quot;Kyodai Ken Byclosser&quot;, &quot;Lady Battle Cop&quot;, and &quot;Choukou Senshi Changéríon&quot;, were also produced during the time that the &quot;Metal Hero Series&quot; were on the air, but are not included as part of the &quot;Metal Hero Series&quot; for various reasons. &quot;Machine Man&quot; and &quot;Bicrosser&quot; were created by Shotaro Ishinomori, while Changéríon&#x27;s armor is not metallic and aired on TV Tokyo. It is unknown if Lady Battle Cop is part of Toei&#x27;s shared universe.

Currently, the &quot;Metal Hero Series&quot; is one of Toei&#x27;s defunct properties, as the company rather favors the Super Sentai and Kamen Rider Series of shows, allegedly due to the passing of Shotaro Ishinomori. However, many of the traits of the series have been adopted into the newer installations of the Super Sentai and Kamen Rider shows. Today, the present versions of this type of heroes are also merged in with the Henshin Heroes description.

Some Metal Heroes have also made cameo appearances. In 2004, a special &quot;Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger&quot; stage show had a special appearance by Gavan, who assisted Hurricane Red from &quot;Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger&quot; and Aba Red from &quot;Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger&quot; in battling various Alienizer monsters from &quot;Deka Ranger&quot;.

In 2005, Toei released some &quot;Uchuu Keiji&quot; trilogy merchandise. Later that year, Bandai released a &quot;Souchaku Henshin&quot; figure of Gavan, followed by &quot;Souchaku Henshin&quot; figures of Sharivan and Shaider in early 2006. In May 2006, a PlayStation 2 video game titled &quot;The Space Sheriff Spirits&quot; was released. The game featured Gavan, Sharivan and Shaider all teaming up to battle past enemies from their series. In early 2008, the trading card company Cardass announced a new, Metal Heroes based expansion to their &quot;Rangers Strike&quot; card game, entitled &quot;Special Metal Edition&quot;, featuring characters and vehicles from the various &quot;Metal Hero Series&quot; for use within the game.

Despite no more television series having been made, the Space Sheriff Series re-emerged in the 2010s with feature films, including new actors portraying successors to Gavan, Sharivan, and Shaider. Some of them are stand alone entries, while others feature crossovers with other Super Sentai and Kamen Rider characters.

<doc id="1258398" wikidata="Q269464" url="?curid=1258398" title="Rosenstrasse protest">
<text>The Rosenstrasse protest is considered to be a significant event in German history as it is the only mass public demonstration by Germans in the Third Reich against the deportation of Jews. The protest on &quot;Rosenstraße&quot; (&quot;Roses street&quot;) took place in Berlin during February and March 1943. This demonstration was initiated and sustained by the non-Jewish wives and relatives of Jewish men and Mischlinge, (those of mixed Jewish and Aryan heritage). Their husbands had been targeted for deportation, based on the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and detained in the Jewish community house on Rosenstrasse. The protests, which occurred over the course of seven days, continued until the men being held were released by the Gestapo. The protest by the women of the Rosenstrasse led to the release of approximately 1,800 Berlin Jews.

== Context ==
From the onset of his power, Hitler dedicated himself fully to accomplishing his idea of the ideal government. In his eyes, a model government drew &quot;conscious consent&quot; from its strength in three pillars of authority. In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, he asserts that a government who has mastered popularity, force, and social tradition &quot;may be regarded as unshakeable&quot;. Social acceptance was integral to the Nazi party&#x27;s continued power. Before beginning to deport Jews as a part of the Final Solution, the regime &quot;made a trial deportation of German Jews&quot; and &quot;had their German neighbors studied attentively&quot; who, in a win for the regime &quot;had hardly noticed&quot; their missing neighbors.

Many Germans also willingly condemned Jews to the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police, often for very little personal gain. It was partially an &quot;environment of terror&quot; pushing Germans to self-police, however, a large number of Germans &quot;went well beyond what... survival demanded to assist the regime.&quot; Laws against German-Jewish relations implemented by the regime were precedented by reports made by citizens of what they considered to be antisocial or deviant behavior. In 1935, following a slew of reports to the Gestapo in July, the Nuremberg Race Laws &quot;exclude[d] German Jews from Reich citizenship and prohibit[ed] them from marrying or having sexual relations with persons of “German or German-related blood” at any point in the future. The Nuremberg Laws, aimed at preventing further racial mixing, did not dissolve existing marriages &quot;in deference to the social and religious sanctity and privacy of marriage.&quot;

By December 1942, 27,744 intermarried Jews were registered in Germany. Initially, German women married more Jewish men than their male counterparts. After the consolidation of power under Hitler, more German men had divorced their partners than women, so the majority of intermarried relationships were between a German wife and her Jewish husband. These women had long faced social and societal pressure from their communities to divorce their husbands long before the Holocaust. Therefore, when the campaign against their husbands began, German women married to Jewish men were already resistant to the outward pressure. As they encountered many Jews in their day-to-day lives, German women were not susceptible to &quot;propaganda&#x27;s abstract evil depictions&quot;, causing the regime to turn to force. 

In Berlin, the majority of Jews spared from deportation were those in intermarried relationships or those working in armaments factories. Since 1933, these intermarriages were seen by the Nazis as their &quot;certain victims&quot;, and the regime tried with all its might to get rid of them. However, these intermarried Jews were woven tightly into their communities, and the regime, cautious of &quot;antagonizing non-Jewish Germans and injuring public morale&quot; had delayed.

== Chronology ==
On January 22, 1943, Goebbels and Hitler agreed that it was time for the final push to expel the last Jews in Germany. At this meeting, Hitler and Goebbels agreed that there &quot;could be no internal security&quot; until the last Jews living in Vienna and Berlin could be deported &quot;as quickly as possible&quot;. On February 18, 1943, Goebbels proclaimed a policy of &quot;Total War&quot; in a speech in Berlin - he argued that the threat of a second &quot;stab-in-the-back&quot; required the &quot;internal security&quot; situation of the &quot;Reich&quot; be improved.

Just after the German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, the Gestapo had arrested the last of the Jews in Berlin during the &quot;Fabrikaktion&quot;. Around 1,800 Jewish men, almost all of them married to non-Jewish women (others classified as the so-called Geltungsjuden), were separated from the other 10,000 arrested, and housed temporarily at Rosenstraße 2–4, a welfare office for the Jewish community located in central Berlin.

The arrests of Berlin Jews, beginning on February 27, 1943, marked an escalation in the efforts made to remove these Jewish family members from their spouses and families. The 1,800 men were so-called &quot;privileged Jews&quot;, a category exempt from deportation and other anti-Jewish measures by reason of being married to German spouses, or employment as officials of the &quot;Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland&quot;, the Jewish organization officially recognized by the German government for the purpose of controlling the Jewish population. According to Mordecai Paldiel, Holocaust survivor and former Director of the Department of the Righteous among the Nations program at Yad Vashem, Israel&#x27;s Holocaust authority, &quot;The Rosenstrasse protest embraced hundreds of women at the site where most of the Jewish men were interned (in a building which previously served the Jewish community in Berlin), before being processed to the camps... who gathered every day, and facing armed &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) soldiers, shouted: &quot;Give us our husbands back!&quot;&quot;

Despite the media blackout ordered by Goebbels, it was impossible for the state to arrest such a large number of people in Berlin over the course of one day without people noticing. Hundreds of women gathered outside of Rosenstrasse 2-4 and announced that they would not leave until their husbands had been released. Despite periodic threats of being shot on site if the women did not disperse their protest, the women would scatter briefly, and then return to Rosenstrasse 2–4 to continue protesting. Elsa Holzer, a protesting wife, later stated in an interview: &quot;We expected that our husbands would return home and that they wouldn&#x27;t be sent to the camps. We acted from the heart, and look what happened. If you had to calculate whether you would do any good by protesting, you wouldn&#x27;t have gone. But we acted from the heart. We wanted to show that we weren&#x27;t willing to let them go. What one is capable of doing when there is danger can never be repeated. I&#x27;m not a fighter by nature. Only when I have to be. I did what was given me to do. When my husband need my protection, I protected him ... And there was always a flood of people there. It wasn&#x27;t organized or instigated. Everyone was simply there. Exactly like me. That&#x27;s what is so wonderful about it.&quot;

The protests were briefly stopped on the night of March 1, 1943, when the British Royal Air Force (RAF) bombed Berlin. It was a public holiday in honor of the Luftwaffe, which the RAF decided to mark with an especially large air raid on Berlin. Ursula Braun, a fiancée of one of the interred Jewish men, recalled mixed feelings about the bombing of Berlin: &quot;On the one hand were fury and hate against the Nazis, who deserved the attack, and on the other side there was terrible misery all around each of us-the screaming people, the hellish fires&quot;. One Jewish woman, Charlotte Israel, stated: &quot;I always had such fear about the air raids. But on that night I thought, that serves them right! I was so enraged. I was together with a few other, who got down on their knees and prayed. I could have laughed in scorn! But then I thought of my husband, who as locked up at Rosenstrasse. I knew they would not be able to leave the building.&quot; On occasion, people passing by would join the protests in favor of the SS releasing the arrested men.

The RSHA favored shooting all of the women protesting on Rosenstrasse, but this plan was vetoed by Goebbels, who argued that the protests were apolitical, an attempt by women to keep their families together rather an attempt to bring down the Nazi regime - that there was no way the regime could massacre thousands of unarmed women in the middle of Berlin and keep the massacre secret, and the news of the massacre would further undermine German morale by showing that the German people were not all united in the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; for Total War. American historian and professor Dr. Nathan Stoltzfus argued that the need to keep the appearance of the German people all united in the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; might explain why force was not used, but:

Nevertheless, had there been no protest on Rosenstrasse, the Gestapo would have kept on arresting and deporting Jews until perhaps even Eichmann&#x27;s most radical plans had been fulfilled. Differences existed between Eichmann&#x27;s office and the leadership on the importance of maintaining social quiescence during deportations, but this would not have mattered if the protests during the Final Roundup had not arisen. Power plays surrounding decision-making on intermarried Jews and &quot;mischlinge&quot; do not so much explain the survival of these Jews as point to the regime&#x27;s fear of unrest. There would have been no hesitation and no conflict among officials had intermarried Germans cooperated fully with Nazi racial aims ... It was the recalcitrance of intermarried Germans that had made a real issue out of the different positions of the top leadership and the RSHA on the importance of social quiescence in the first place and it was their protest in 1943 that soon caused Goebbels to revert to the position of temporarily deferring these problem cases. 

On March 6, 1943, Goebbels in his capacity as the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Berlin ordered all of the people imprisoned at Rosenstrasse 2-4 to be released, writing &quot;I will commission the security police not to continue the Jewish evacuations in a systematic manner during such a critical time [a reference to the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad]. We want to rather spare that for ourselves until after a few weeks; then we can carry it out that much more thoroughly.&quot; In reference to the protests, Goebbels attacked the RSHA, stating &quot;One has to intervene all over the place, to ward off damages. The efforts of certain officers are so lacking in political savvy that one cannot let them operate on their own for ten minutes!&quot;. On April 1, 1943, the American Legation in Bern reported to Washington: &quot;Action against Jewish wives and husbands on the part of the Gestapo ... had to be discontinued some time ago because of the protest which such action aroused.&quot;

Leopold Gutterer, who was Goebbels&#x27;s deputy at the Propaganda Ministry, remembered that Goebbels stated if force was used to crush the demonstrations, it would prompt wider protests all over Berlin, which might soon become political, and could possibly even lead to the overthrow of the Nazi regime. Gutterer later stated in an interview: &quot;Goebbels released the Jews in order to eliminate that protest from the world. That was the simplest solution: to eradicate completely the reason for the protest. Then it wouldn&#x27;t make any sense to protest anymore. So that others didn&#x27;t take a lesson [from the protest], so others didn&#x27;t begin to do the same, the reason [for the protest] had to be eliminated. There was unrest, and it could have spread from neighborhood to neighborhood ... Why should Goebbels have had them [the protestors] all arrested? Then he would have only had even more unrest, from the relatives of these newly arrested persons.&quot; Gutterer also stated: &quot;That [protest] was only possible in a large city, where people lived together, whether Jewish or not. In Berlin were also representatives of the international press, who immediately grabbed hold of something like this, to loudly proclaim it. Thus news of the protest would travel from one person to the next.&quot; Goebbels swiftly realized that to use force against the women protesting on the Rosenstrasse would undermine the claim that all Germans were united in the &quot;volksgemeinschaft.&quot; Using force against the protestors would not only damage the &quot;volksgemeinschaft&quot;, which provided the domestic unity to support the war, but would also draw unwanted attention to the &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;. Stoltzfus wrote: &quot;A public discussion about the fate of deported Jews threatened to disclose the Final Solution and thus endanger the entire war effort.&quot;

Despite the news blackout imposed by Goebbels, the news of the protests on the Rosenstrasse had traveled swiftly by word of mouth all throughout Germany and beyond; in Switzerland, British and American diplomats heard rumors of the Rosenstrasse protests, and in the first week of March 1943, British and American newspapers reported on the protests in Berlin. Goebbels hit back by having the German newspapers claim that the women were actually protesting against the British bombing of Berlin, and far from cracking, the &quot;volksgemeinschaft&quot; was stronger than ever, stating that charity donations in Germany had gone up 70% in the last year [i.e. a sign that the &quot;volksgenossen&quot; or &quot;National Comrades&quot; all cared for each other].

Despite his promise to Hitler, Goebbels did not try to deport the men of the Rosenstrasse to Auschwitz again, saying the risk of protest was too great, and instead ordered the men of the Rosenstrasse to stop wearing their yellow stars of David on 18 April 1943. Without knowing it, the women who protested on the Rosenstrasse had also saved the lives of other Jews. On May 21, 1943, in response to a question from the chief of the Security Police in Paris, Rolf Günther, who was Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s deputy at the Jewish Desk of the RSHA, stated that French Jews married to Gentiles could not be deported until the question of German Jews in mixed marriages was &quot;clarified&quot;. As half of the Jews living in mixed marriages in the &quot;Reich&quot; were living in Berlin, the question could not be &quot;clarified&quot; until Jews living in mixed marriages in Berlin were deported, which thus led Günther to rule no deportations of French Jews in mixed marriages at present. On May 21, 1943, Ernst Kaltenbrunner of the RSHA issued a memo ordering the release of all German Jews in mixed marriages from concentration camps except those convicted of criminal offenses. The same memo listed four categories of Jews who, up until this point, had been spared deportation, including those considered &quot;irreplaceable&quot; by the arms industry; the memo ordered the first three categories deported, but spared the fourth, namely those in mixed marriages as it stated a repeat of the Rosenstrasse protests was not desirable. The men imprisoned in the Rosenstrasse survived the Holocaust. The protests on Rosenstrasse were the only time in which a protest against the &quot;Final Solution&quot; in Nazi Germany had occurred against the regime.

=== Historians&#x27; perspectives ===

There are varying perspectives taken by historians around the globe regarding the Rosenstrasse Protest. In 2003 German historian Kurt Pätzold explained part of what is at issue: arguing that a protest rescued Jewish lives &quot;strikes at the center of the historical perception of the character of the Nazi regime and the way it functioned, and weighs on judgments about the possibilities for resistance.&quot; Another German historian, Konrad Kwiet, added that &quot;the successful outcome of this late protest suggests that if similar actions at an earlier stage had been carried out throughout Germany, they might have halted the increasingly destructive course of the German anti-Jewish policy.&quot; There are a lot of controversial questions surrounding these perspectives, such as: did the regime set its course, issue orders, and carry them out in every detail, using brute force to have its way if necessary? Or was it tactically opportunistic, improvising its decisions within changing circumstances to maximize its impact? Ultimately, the question is whether the Jews released following the Rosenstrasse demonstration owe their lives to the protest, or whether as another German historian wrote, they have the will of the Gestapo to &quot;thank&quot; for their survival.

Recently, some German historians have set the protest within the contexts of left-wing resistance, Jewish underground survival, and Nazi policies of forced labour and deportation. Some argue that while the non-Jewish partners were targeted, harassed and intended for internment, actual deportation was not the aim in early 1943. Wolf Gruner has argued that at this time the Gestapo excluded Jews with Aryan partners from expulsion, and corrected Berlin officials who tried to remove them. German historian Diane Schulle summarizes this perspective in her essay &quot;Forced Labour&quot;: &quot;Gruner…suggests that regardless of the protests, the deportation of mixed-marriage partners had never been part of the plan. The arrests of Mischlinge [&quot;half-Jews&quot;] and Jews living in mixed marriages had been undertaken for a purpose other than deportation: registration.&quot; Gruner insists that Nazi directives at that time prohibited the Gestapo from deporting German Jews married to non-Jews. In Gruner&#x27;s view, therefore, the protest had no impact on the Gestapo, since deportation was not their aim. As evidence, Gruner says that on February 20, 1943, Himmler&#x27;s Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) ordered that intermarried Jews were to be exempted from the deportations &quot;temporarily&quot;. Four days later, a Gestapo order from the city of Frankfurt an der Oder directed Gestapo agents to avoid drawing attention to intermarried Jews. They were instead encouraged to arrest these Jews on other charges including &quot;impudence&quot;, prior to sending them to a concentration camp. According to this order, Gruner wrote that &quot;much would depend on the arbitrary behavior of the officers at each location.&quot;

As Gauleiter Joseph Goebbels resolved to make Berlin Judenfrei by March 1943, pushing out all persons wearing the star, there was a simultaneous pull from the Auschwitz-Buna camp for slave laborers, as Joachim Neander has shown. In February, fearing that the 6,000 Polish workers at I. G. Farben’s Buna would revolt, plans were laid to disperse them throughout other camps by mid-March, 1943. In addition to the workers needed to replace the Poles, 3,000 additional workers were needed to bring the labor force up to the number promised by SS-Obersturmbannführer Gerhard Maurer, head of Office D II, “Prisoner Employment,” at the SS Economic Administration Main Office. .

Arthur Liebehenschel, also of the Economic SS, made it clear these forced laborers would come from the deportations of Berlin Jews, and that he expected Auschwitz to receive not 9,000 but 15,000 workers.

Providing slave laborers—who would have to be kept healthy—was a high priority for the Economic SS.

By late February, deportations had reduced the number of Jews employed in the Berlin armaments industry to about 11,000. In order to send to Auschwitz even just 9,000 Berlin Jews ‘fit for work’, never mind the promised 15,000, a significant number would have to come from intermarried Jews. the majority of the 11,000 Jewish armaments workers living in Berlin by late February 1943 were living in “mixed marriages.” .

Neander has calculated that supplying Auschwitz-Buna with 11,000 Jewish slave laborers by mid-March 1943 would have required the inclusion of seven thousand intermarried Jews from Berlin. For these 7,000 the Gestapo’s “temporary” exemption of intermarried Jews from the deportations would have ended. Already the “temporary” exemption had come to an end for hundreds of Germany’s intermarried Jews who had been murdered in the Holocaust. A report by the intermarried and reliably-sourced Gerhard Lehfeldt from March 1943 suggests that 9.000 Berlin Jews were to be sent into forced labor. .

However, factors in Berlin, most importantly street protests against the deportations of Jews imprisoned at Rosenstrasse, altered the alignment of interests in deporting intermarried Jews. Berlin&#x27;s Gauleiter Goebbels had both the power and motivation to influence his approach to intermarried Jews in Berlin. Goebbels was engaged in an effort to restructure the German home front for total war under his leadership. He saw that his position and plans to mobilize the German people for total war anticipated more sacrifices, and that these were jeopardized by the Rosenstrasse protest. He intervened to release Berlin’s intermarried Jews arrested in the massive arrests beginning on February 27, 1943 that Himmler identified as an Action to Eliminate Jews from Reich Territory. But only temporarily—he thought of it as another “temporary” stay of execution:
-Goebbels Diary, March 6, 1943.

=== Terminology ===
Although the massive arrests of Berlin Jews beginning on February 27, 1943 are commonly known as the &quot;Fabrikaktion&quot;, or &quot;Factory Action&quot;, this term was never used by the Gestapo, but was instead invented following the war. The Gestapo&#x27;s code names for this action were &quot;Elimination of Jews from the German Reich&quot; and &quot;Final roundup of Jews in Berlin&quot;. Using the Gestapo&#x27;s terms is important because Jews were arrested at their factory workplaces, at home, and persons seen on the streets wearing the Jewish star were chased down and carted off to be dispatched from Berlin. Goebbels resolved in February ,1943, to refrain from deporting Jews working in factories, but to instead make Berlin Judenrein, &quot;free of Jews&quot;, demonstrating his intent towards dispatching anyone wearing the Jewish Star.

=== Germany&#x27;s relationship to the past ===

Two articles in early 2018 in the German press presented contrasting interpretations of the Rosenstrasse Protest on the occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary. While the Berliner Tagesspiegel on February 27 credited that protest with rescuing two thousand Jews, Der Spiegel on March 2 represented institutions and persons who sharply disagree. In this position, &quot;Aryan&quot; (non-Jewish) partners who demonstrated for the release of their husbands are to be commended, although their protest made no difference whatsoever since their protest coincided perfectly with Gestapo plans: &quot;A decree of the Reich Security Main Office, however, did not provide for the deportation of any Jews living in a so-called mixed marriage, but only the removal from the factories, in order to ‘capture’ [erfassen] them, after which they were to be released back to their homes ... &quot;

The standard evidence for this position referred to by Der Spiegel’s editors is the decree of the Frankfurt/Oder Gestapo circulated by the Administrator for the District of Calau dated February 25th, 1943, as interpreted by Gruner. In 1995, Gruner wrote that &quot;views that such demonstrations could have hampered the RSHA&#x27;s deportation plans are unlikely to hold up in the historic context.&quot; For Gruner, &quot;interpreting the Rosenstrasse protest as rescuing intermarried Jews carries &quot;the danger of dramatically underestimating the regime’s power to dominate (Herrschaft).&quot;

Dr. Nathan Stoltzfus responded to Gruner&#x27;s comment that &quot;a dictatorship that would lash out in every direction at any sign of opposition would be dramatically less dangerous than one that knew how to use force and terror more instrumentally. A flexible villain capable of strategizing is capable of more villainy than one that must always act according to ideology and plans made in advance.&quot;

The Frankfurt/Oder Erlass does not suggest that the Gestapo did not plan to deport any of the intermarried Jews it arrested during the course of its Reich-wide &quot;Removal of Jews from Reich Territory Actions&quot;, which began on February 27, 1943. It says in part: &quot;All Jews still employed are to be removed from businesses for the purpose of the collection [Erfassung]. Uppity behavior of Jews in a still-existing mixed marriage, is to be punished by placing them in protective custody with a request for their placement in a concentration camp. This [punishment] can be carried out very unsparingly, but the impression must be avoided that this action is fundamentally resolving the mixed marriage problem at this same time. Unless there are reasons to justify the imprisonment of the Jews who live in mixed marriages, these Jews are to be sent to their homes&quot;.

This local order could have had no bearing on the fate of Jews imprisoned on Berlin&#x27;s Rosenstrasse; certainly it did not stand between Joseph Goebbels, the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Berlin, and his resolve to declare his city free of Jews by March. (Diary, February 2, 1943). Its &quot;local&quot; character is clear, for example in its references to specific work-camps in the region. It does invoke the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) to lay out the purpose of the action as detaining all Jews &quot;for the purpose of collection&quot;. Erfassung might mean either &quot;collection&quot; or &quot;registration&quot;, but critically for its interpretation here, in the Erlass it applies to all Jews arrested—including those sent to Auschwitz—and not just to Jews in intermarriage.

== Commemoration==

The building on Rosenstraße, near Alexanderplatz, in which the men were held, was destroyed during an Allied bombing of Berlin at the end of the war. The original Rosenstraße location is now marked by a rose-colored Litfaß column that is 2–3 meters high, dedicated to the demonstration. Information about this event is posted on the Litfaß column.

In the mid-1980s, Ingeborg Hunzinger, an East German sculptor, created a memorial to those women who took part in the Rosenstraße Protest. The memorial, named &quot;Block der Frauen&quot; (Block of Women), was erected in 1995 in a park not far from the site of the protest. The sculpture shows protesting and mourning women, and an inscription on the back reads: &quot;The strength of civil disobedience, the vigour of love overcomes the violence of dictatorship; Give us our men back; Women were standing here, defeating death; Jewish men were free&quot;. The Israeli historian Omer Bartov observed that the memorial does not actually explain what the Rosenstrasse protests were or achieved, as if many Germans would prefer to forget about the protests, presumably because the protesters achieved their demands.

The events of the Rosenstraße protests were made into a film in 2003 by Margarethe von Trotta under the title &quot;Rosenstraße&quot;.

The 75th anniversary of the protest occurred in 2018. The German consulate in New York, United States commemorated the anniversary on February 24, 2018. German politician Petra Pau, vice president of parliament and member of Germany&#x27;s socialist party Die Linke, gave a speech in the Bundestag marking the anniversary. An opinion piece in the Jerusalem Post on the 75th anniversary of the Rosenstraße protests compared those events to the grievances expressed during the 2017–2018 Iranian protests.
On 29 August 2024, the memorial was defaced with graffiti &quot;Jews are committing genocide&quot;.

==Club career==

===Early years===
Cabañas started his career at Club 12 de Octubre, where he was promoted to the first division, by then-coach Alicio Solalinde, scoring 17 goals in his first season. He then moved to a different team, Guaraní, where he had a brief stint before moving to Audax Italiano of Chile. In the 2003 Apertura tournament of the Chilean Primera División, Cabañas was the top scorer with 18 goals.

===Years in Mexico===
Afterwards, he joined Chiapas of Mexico from Audax Italiano before the Mexican 2003 Apertura tournament. That season, Cabañas went on to play in 18 games for the team, scoring five goals. He came into his own in the 2004 Clausura however, as he scored 15 goals in 20 games for the club. He would lead the club in goals again in the 2004 Apertura, with eight in 16 matches.

Following the Clausura 2006 season in which Cabañas won his first goal-scoring crown in the Mexican League, he attracted the attention of Club América, one of the most important clubs in the country, and was signed by the Mexico City squad prior to the Apertura 2006 season.

Cabañas became Club América&#x27;s most prolific goal scorer for 2007, finishing up the first half of the year with an impressive 19 goals between 2007 Copa Libertadores (in which he became the top-scorer with 10 goals) and the Mexican Primera División. He started the second half of the year with a single goal in the North American SuperLiga, then scored 4 more goals in the 2007 Copa Sudamericana, and has scored 9 more in the Mexican Primera División, bringing his year&#x27;s total with the club to 33 goals. His top form in 2007 earned him the Paraguayan Footballer of the Year and South American Footballer of the Year awards.

For 2008, Cabañas has started where he left off in 2007. He scored 3 goals in the 2008 InterLiga, scored 8 in the 2008 Copa Libertadores (in which, for a consecutive second time, he became the top-scorer), and scored 6 more goals in the Mexican Primera División. He started the second half of the year with 6 goals in the Mexican Primera División, bringing his year&#x27;s total to 23 goals with the club.

Cabañas started 2009 by scoring his first goal in the 2009 InterLiga and scoring 13 more goals in the Mexican Primera División. He then finished the second half of the year with 12 goals in the Mexican Primera División. Taking his tally to 26 goals for the year. On 18 January, against Santos Laguna, he scored two goals, taking his personal tally to 100 goals in the Mexican Primera División.

In 2010, Cabañas again started the year scoring goals in the 2010 InterLiga, scoring four. In the two games he played in the 2010 Bicentenario, he scored two goals. His last game before being shot was on 24 January 2010 in a 2–0 loss against Morelia.

===Murder attempt===
Cabañas was shot in the head inside the &quot;Bar Bar&quot; nightclub, in Mexico City, on 25 January 2010 at 5:00 a.m. According to the official police reports, the assault was the result of a taunting incident in the bar&#x27;s bathroom between Cabañas and a mobster of the Beltrán-Leyva Drug-Cartel called José Balderas Garza, alias &quot;JJ&quot;, who shot him.

According to Cabañas ex-wife, the altercation was a result of Cabañas reacting against a robbery.

Cabañas received medical attention during the early hours of 25 January 2010. Later on the day he was submitted to a craniotomy but doctors decided that it was too risky to proceed and the bullet was not extracted. Cabañas left intensive care in late February and was hoping to fully recover in time for the 2010 FIFA World Cup but was not selected for the final Paraguay squad. Doctors dealing with Cabañas have described his recovery so far as &quot;tremendous&quot;. However, it is announced he does have short-term memory loss and may not recover for another one to three years. He gave his first interview on 12 March 2010 in appreciation to all the people who prayed for him. In 2013, Cabañas gave his version of the incident which stated that in his opinion the attack occurred so that he would not play at the 2010 FIFA World Cup and that Paraguay would not be crowned champions of the competition.

At that moment, Cabañas challenged the man, asking him &#x27;What are you waiting for&#x27;, noting to him that he had held the gun towards Cabañas for almost 10 minutes, and after a little bit, the man pulled the trigger on Cabañas shot his forehead. He also stated that right after being shot, he had a near-death experience, where he felt that he went directly to heaven and spoke with God, who touched him on his forehead where Cabañas had been shot, and told him that a long time remained until he was due to come to heaven and that he should enjoy life and help those in need.

===Return to football===
Cabañas signed a contract with Paraguayan third-division club 12 de Octubre, on 20 January 2012, two years after the assault. He then made his competitive return to football on 14 April, starting and playing forty minutes, in the club&#x27;s 2–0 win over Martín Ledesma in the opening round of the Primera B.

<doc id="1258402" wikidata="Q7400916" url="?curid=1258402" title="Saint Andrew's School, Singapore">
<text>St. Andrew&#x27;s School (abbreviation: SAS) is a family of schools in Singapore, affiliated to each other as well as to the Anglican Diocese of Singapore. It comprises St. Andrew&#x27;s Junior School (SAJS), St. Andrew&#x27;s Secondary School (SASS) and St. Andrew&#x27;s Junior College (SAJC). The schools are often referred to as The Saints&#x27; Family.

Together, the three schools offer primary, secondary and pre-university education (otherwise known as Grades 1 to 12), having an enrolment of 4000 to 5000 students.

SAJS and SASS are located in the Woodsville Campus, while SAJC is located across the Kallang River in the Potong Pasir Campus. Both campuses are linked to each other by the Jacob Ballas Bridge, forming St Andrew&#x27;s Village (SAV).

The junior and secondary schools have always only admitted male pupils, but female pupils were admitted to the pre-university or &#x27;A&#x27; level classes when they were run from the senior school previously. St Andrew&#x27;s Junior College has always been co-educational since being separated from the secondary school.

The school is also affiliated with other Anglican and Presbyterian schools in Singapore, including St Margaret&#x27;s Primary School (St. Andrew&#x27;s Sister School), St Margaret&#x27;s Secondary School, St Hilda&#x27;s Primary School, St Hilda&#x27;s Secondary School, the Anglican High School, Presbyterian High School and Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School.

The name of the school is usually abbreviated as SAJS, or sometimes as SA. Its pupils and alumni (&#x27;Old Boys&#x27; and &#x27;Old Girls&#x27;) are referred to as Saints. The alumni for all former students of St. Andrew&#x27;s School is St. Andrew&#x27;s Alumni, and was formed in 1921.

== History ==

=== Chin Chew Street (1862–1863) ===

SAS was founded on 8 September 1862 by Edward Sherman Venn through adopting a private institution owned by Sim Quee and Tye Kim in Chin Chew Street, in Singapore. The Anglican missionary led by Venn funded the school. Sim Quee and Tye Kim remained as headmasters of their school. This was unusual for the day as most missionary schools were not usually headed by Asians. The school was then known as the St Andrew&#x27;s Church of England Mission School.

=== Upper Hokkien Street (1863–1872) ===

On 10 September 1863, the school moved to Upper Hokkien Street because of the need for a better building and more space for the growing school. Soon after, Cheok Loy Fatt was appointed the headmaster.

After a couple of years, the school suffered from financial difficulties, and financial support was withdrawn in 1866. Venn died in 1866, which might explain why financial support was withdrawn at this time. In 1872, the colonial chaplain J.A. Beccles successfully applied to the government for financial aid. Thus, on 22 May 1872, St Andrew&#x27;s School became a grant-in-aid institution.

=== Victoria Street (1872–1875) ===

In 1872, Beccles was succeeded by George Frederick Hose as colonial chaplain. Meanwhile, the growing school moved to Victoria Street. Hose invited William Henry Gomes to act as school superintendent, in which the school prospered and grew.

During the early days at the Victoria Street site, both Hose and Gomes knew that the growth of the school would be hampered by poor accommodation. The government gave the school a piece of land on the then Government Hill with a frontage on Stamford Road.

=== Stamford Road (1875–1940) ===

The first building to go up was the chapel in 1875 and in that same year, the school vacated its cramped premises in Victoria Street and moved into the Stamford Road site. Classes were held in the chapel, which also became an important centre of public worship.

J. Romanis Lee, who became headmaster from 1912, was a benefactor of the school as it acquired many of its modern characteristics during his period as headmaster. He set about expanding the premises of the school and raised the status of the school from a second grade school to top grade in 1914, in which the school started to offer the Senior Cambridge Examination. He also established a tradition of sports in the school; the school excelled in boxing and rugby union.

Joseph Lee became headmaster in 1924 and the enrolment increased to 800. Lee established John Oxenham&#x27;s poem &quot;Up and On&quot; as the school song. The first issue of the school magazine, &quot;Up and On&quot;, made its appearance in 1928.

Reginald Keith Sorby Adams succeeded Lee as the next headmaster on 1 October 1934. By that time, St Andrew&#x27;s had become well known for its boxing and rugby. The need for a bigger area than the cramped site at Stamford Road had become a problem by the early 1930s. There were scarcely enough classrooms and there was no playing field for a school which showed so much enthusiasm and aptitude for outdoor games.

This site ultimately became the site of the National Library of Singapore from 1960, before it moved to Victoria Street.

=== Pre-war Woodsville (1940–1942) ===

In 1938, Woodsville Estate comprising of land, was purchased for $60,000. Adams, assisted by archdeacon Graham White, played a major role in the moving of the school to the Woodsville site, after previously rejecting two sites in Tanjong Katong and on Serangoon Road. The two-storey school buildings were completed and officially opened by S. W. Jones, the officer administering the government, on 29 July 1940. The start of World War II in Singapore had the school closed.

=== Post-war Woodsville (1945–1990) ===

Immediately after the war, the school was the first to re-open. The school was then divided into lower school and upper school. Until the arrival of Adams, who had just been released from internment, D.D. Chelliah acted as headmaster. As the school population grew, the school grew as well with the addition of another floor in 1952. The Lim Teck Kin Tower was also added in that year.

In 1955, the lower school was renamed the &quot;Junior School&quot;, and the upper school was renamed &quot;Secondary School&quot;. In 1956, due to the rapid growth of the junior school, it was further separated into two schools: &quot;Junior I&quot; and &quot;Junior II&quot;. Each junior school was run by its own headmaster, but this changed from 1960 onwards when both schools shared the same head.

In 1969, pre-university classes started and in 1978, &quot;St Andrew&#x27;s Junior College&quot; was established and moved to Malan Road. By the 1980s, the Woodsville site was unable to handle the growth of both junior schools and the secondary school. Meanwhile, with nearby Potong Pasir developed, the school requested that a 4.18-hectare site allocated for education would be used for the &quot;St Andrew&#x27;s Secondary School&quot;. Construction of the secondary school started on 3 November 1984 and the buildings were opened in July 1986.

=== 1990-present ===


In 1990, the two junior schools were combined into one school: &quot;St Andrew&#x27;s Junior School&quot;. In 1996, the school had to relocate due to noise pollution from the recently upgraded Pan-Island Expressway. The school was relocated in January 1996 and the new school building was declared open by the then Minister for Education, Teo Chee Hean, in 1997.

As part of the St Andrew&#x27;s Village project, all three schools were planned to return to Woodsville and Potong Pasir. Renovation and expansion of the junior school started in 2003, and the new buildings opened in December 2004. Construction of a new secondary school started in 2003, opposite the junior school along Francis Thomas Drive, and opened in December 2004. Construction of the junior college started in June 2003 after the secondary school vacated the site and shifted to its holding location. The junior college opened in December 2005 and a ceremony was held to mark its return to Woodsville/Potong Pasir. The village was officially opened on 26 August 2006, with the ceremony being held at the 1000-seater Cultural Centre in the junior college.

In addition to these three schools, the village also houses the diocesan office, the Ascension Kindergarten and three church buildings: the Chapel of the Resurrection, Chapel of the Holy Spirit and Church of Ascension. Some of the new facilities at the village include an Olympic size swimming pool, a 1,000-seat performing arts centre (Cultural Centre), air-conditioned school halls, gymnasiums, indoor basketball court, roof-top basketball court, tennis courts, cafe, rockwall, astro-turf artificial field and a sheltered bridge across the Kallang River to connect the junior and secondary schools to the junior college across the river. In 2010, piling work began for the construction of St Andrew&#x27;s Hall, a 12-storey hostel with sufficient rooms to accommodate up to 600 students with facilities including a dining room for 600 people, an adjoining multipurpose hall as well as a clinic to serve the residents of the hall and St Andrew&#x27;s Village. St Andrew&#x27;s Hall was officially opened on 25 August 2012.

Construction for a new combined indoor sports hall at the existing site of the secondary school canteen block commenced in November 2016 with target for completion by end 2018. The new double size indoor sports hall block includes a new canteen for the secondary school. The junior school also commenced the PERI upgrading in the same period which will see construction above the current library as well as a new block at the end of the quadrangle facing the junior college.

There are also currently plans to redevelop the old science block which used to house the pre-university classes and currently houses Ascension Kindergarten. The redevelopment plans will include a new student leadership centre. The redevelopment plan is expected to be executed upon the completion of the indoor sports hall and PERI upgrading.

== Culture ==

=== Saints&#x27; spirit ===
The students of the school are encouraged to support the school sports teams. Particularly during semifinals and finals matches, the entire school is usually in full force at the venue to support the school team, wearing their widely recognised blue and white hoops. Cheering is led by the prefectorial board and the student government.

The school&#x27;s rugby team also has its own battle cry, which is called the Saints&#x27; battle cry. It is normally mistaken by people as the &quot;haka&quot;. It is usually performed before the start of the match at a final or at special events.

The Saints&#x27; spirit also permeated into music producing members of such recording artists as The Sundowners, Tornados, Wes Cossacks, Straydogs, and Electrons with Rex Goh Tee Huat. The latter went on to join Australia&#x27;s Air Supply.

=== Sports ===
The school has been famous since the 1930s, and in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1966 concurrently, under the dedicated tutelage of Mr Keong Snr, it rose to a new high with its boxing and rugby dominance over Singapore Boy&#x27;s Town, Anglo-Chinese School, and Raffles Institution. Since the 1970s, the school has won the national championships consistently. The 1990s saw competition from Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and Raffles Institution, but St Andrew&#x27;s has had a major revival in the sport in recent years.

The school also excels in cricket and hockey. Under the guidance of the cricket master Philip Ng, the school&#x27;s cricket team saw success from 1998 onwards, with eight of its eleven players being called up for national under-15 representations in their first year of the game. The rivalry between Raffles Institution and St. Andrew&#x27;s continued in the ovals as the teams battled for the championship titles over the next few years.

=== Houses ===
The school has a house system aimed at intra-school sporting competitions. The school originally had eleven houses. Today, there are five houses throughout the school, from the junior school to the junior college. The five houses are named after important people in the school&#x27;s history:
* Venn (black), after Edward Sherman Venn, who was founder of the school in 1862,
* Hose (blue), after George Frederick Hose, who was colonial chaplain in the 1860s,
* Loy Fatt (yellow), after Cheok Loy Fatt, who was headmaster in the 1870s,
* Gomes (red), after William Henry Gomes, who was school superintendent during the 1870s, and
* Romanis (green), after J. Romanis Lee, who was headmaster in the 1910s.

=== School song, hymn and crest ===
The school song was introduced by Joseph Lee. The words of the song are from John Oxenham&#x27;s poem &quot;Up and On&quot;. All three schools share the same school song, school hymn and school crest.

School crestThe official heraldic description of the crest is: &quot;Azure, a saltire argent, in chief keys, in base a tiger&#x27;s face.&quot; Simply, the crest is a blue shield, with a silver diagonal cross. In the top quarter are two keys, and in the lower quarter is a tiger&#x27;s face.

The blue shield and silver diagonal cross is the St Andrew&#x27;s Cross. The keys represent the &quot;Keys to Knowledge and Heaven&quot;, and the tiger&#x27;s face is a local symbol of strength.

== Schools ==

=== St Andrew&#x27;s Junior School ===
St Andrew&#x27;s Junior School (SAJS) started off as the lower school of St Andrew&#x27;s School after World War 2. After being renamed in 1956, the school was split into two schools, but were combined in 1990. The school later moved to a site in Potong Pasir because of noise pollution caused by the recently upgraded Pan-Island Expressway in 1996.

Following plans for the St Andrew&#x27;s Village, the school moved into new buildings at the same Potong Pasir site in December 2004 at 2 Francis Thomas Drive, Singapore 359337.

=== St Andrew&#x27;s Secondary School ===

St Andrew&#x27;s Secondary School (SASS) started as the upper school of St Andrew&#x27;s School after World War 2. The school moved from the Woodsville site in July 1986 to its site in Potong Pasir across the Kallang River after the Woodsville buildings were deemed inadequate for the running of both the junior and senior classes. In mid-2003, the school shifted to the old Victoria School building at Kallang Bahru as a temporary holding site. As part of the St Andrew&#x27;s Village project, the school has moved into new buildings beside SAJS since 2005 at 15 Francis Thomas Drive, Singapore 359342. The premises incorporates Woodsville House which was earmarked as a heritage building. Woodsville House used to be the residences of the principals of St Andrew&#x27;s School and is now used as the offices for the head of Departments on the second floor and has a small heritage gallery on the ground floor.

=== St Andrew&#x27;s Junior College ===

St Andrew&#x27;s Junior College (SAJC) started as pre-university classes in 1969 and in 1978, moved to its site at 2 Malan Road. The college started the new year in 1978 with a brand new image, including a College Anthem of its own. However, in 1993, the college adopted back the original St Andrew&#x27;s School crest, motto, song and hymn. The college has since returned to Potong Pasir as of 2006 as part of the St Andrew&#x27;s Village project. It is situated on the former SASS site at 55 Potong Pasir Avenue 1, Singapore 358389. A sheltered pedestrian bridge, named Jacob Ballas Bridge, connects the junior college to the junior school and secondary school across the Kallang River.

<text>Melvin Brown Casados (born 28 January 1979) is a Mexican former professional footballer who played as a centre-back.

Brown made his debut in the Primera División with Cruz Azul in the 2001 Apertura, and quickly became a mainstay at defense for the club. In his three and a half years with the club, he played in 109 games, scoring five goals. Following the 2004 Clausura, Brown was transferred to the Jaguares at the request of his coach at Cruz Azul, José Luis Trejo.

==International career==
Born in Mexico, Brown is of Jamaican descent through his paternal grandfather. Despite an approach by the Jamaica Football Federation inviting him to join the country national team, he opted to play for his country of birth at under-23 level. He ended up making his international debut with the Mexico senior side, on 1 July 2001, in a 1–0 home win over the United States. He was later named to the roster for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but he was not used during the tournament.

<text>Vincent Paul Abbott (March 11, 1964 – June 22, 2018) was an American musician best known for being the drummer and co-founder of the heavy metal band Pantera. He also co-founded Damageplan in 2003 with his younger brother, &quot;Dimebag&quot; Darrell Abbott, and was a member of Hellyeah for 12 years from 2006 until his death in 2018.

Several rock media outlets have ranked Abbott as among the greatest metal drummers of all time.

==Early years==
Vincent Paul Abbott was born in Abilene, Texas, on March 11, 1964. His parents were Jerry, a country music songwriter and producer, and Carolyn Abbott. Abbott originally played the tuba after being assigned to it in school band class, but he was directed towards the drums by his father, who said there were no career prospects for a tuba player. His father bought him his first drum kit.

Abbott cited Peter Criss, Alex Van Halen and Tommy Aldridge as his biggest influences as a drummer.

==Career==
===Pantera===

Abbott formed the heavy metal band Pantera in 1981 with his brother Darrell Abbott and Terry Glaze on guitars, bassist Tommy D. Bradford, and vocalist Donnie Hart. Upon Hart&#x27;s departure, Terry Glaze assumed vocal duties. In the summer of 1982, Bradford left the band and was succeeded by Rex Brown. The band released three albums with that lineup.

Pantera recruited vocalist Phil Anselmo in 1987 and released &quot;Power Metal&quot; (album) in 1988. By 1990, the band had been signed to Atco Records and released &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, which proved to be the band&#x27;s turning point. Over the course of four more studio records, a live album and a greatest hits compilation, Anselmo and Pantera were nominated for four best metal performance Grammys for the songs &quot;I&#x27;m Broken&quot;, &quot;Suicide Note Pt. I&quot;, &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot;, and &quot;Revolution Is My Name&quot;.

In 2001, Anselmo decided to put Pantera on hold because of back pain while he toured and recorded with his side projects. Pantera&#x27;s official disbandment took place in 2003 for several reasons, but mainly because of the ongoing dispute between Anselmo and the Abbott brothers, although Rex Brown remained neutral. In the years to follow, animosity would stir up between Abbott and Anselmo although Anselmo had publicly announced that he wished for Abbott to forgive him and reform a friendship. However, Abbott stated that he was not interested in speaking to Anselmo.

===Damageplan===

After the breakup of Pantera, the Abbott brothers formed the heavy metal band Damageplan with former tattoo artist Bob Zilla on bass and former Halford guitarist Pat Lachman on lead vocals. Damageplan recorded one album, &quot;New Found Power&quot;, which was released on February 10, 2004. The song &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, a collaboration with Alice in Chains guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell, was not completed in time to be featured on the album, but it was featured on the soundtrack to the 2004 film &quot;The Punisher&quot;, and was a bonus track on the Japanese version of &quot;New Found Power&quot;.

On December 8, 2004, while on tour to support Damageplan&#x27;s album, Darrell was shot and killed along with three others by Nathan Gale at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio. Damageplan disbanded shortly thereafter. In a 2016 interview with Loudwire, Abbott revealed that there are five unreleased Damageplan tracks that were meant for the band&#x27;s second album that was set to be released in 2005, but that those tracks have no vocals, only him and Darrell playing on them. Abbott said that he didn&#x27;t know what to do with those tracks, but he often thought about having some of Darrell&#x27;s favorite singers like Rob Halford of Judas Priest and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden to record vocals for the songs, but he didn&#x27;t have time to do it because he was focused on his band Hellyeah.

===Hellyeah===


After the death of Darrell, Abbott formed Big Vin Records in February 2006 and released &quot;Rebel Meets Rebel&quot; and a DVD, &quot;Dimevision, Volume 1&quot;. Abbott, along with Cristina Scabbia (co-lead vocalist of Lacuna Coil), wrote a monthly question-and-answer column in &quot;Revolver&quot;. Abbott maintained endorsement deals with ddrum, Sabian cymbals, and Vic Firth drumsticks. He previously endorsed Tama, Pearl drums, and Remo drumheads and hardware.

In June 2006, after an 18-month hiatus, Abbott was not sure if he would return to music, but eventually joined the heavy metal supergroup Hellyeah, which featured vocalist Chad Gray and guitarist Greg Tribbett from Mudvayne, guitarist Tom Maxwell from Nothingface, and bassist Bob Zilla from Damageplan, who was a replacement for original bassist Jerry Montano. Abbott recorded six studio albums with the band. In May 2019, it was announced that Hellyeah would tour for the first time since Abbott&#x27;s death to support the final album he recorded with the band, &quot;Welcome Home&quot;. Stone Sour drummer Roy Mayorga was chosen as Abbott&#x27;s replacement.

===Collaborations===
In 1995, he mixed the songs &quot;Narcissiques anonymes&quot; and &quot;Nits&quot; on Ego, the first album of a Quebec metal band called TSPC.

In November 2008, he handpicked several of his most memorable drum parts to demonstrate in a promotional video for the drum company ddrum: &quot;Use My Third Arm&quot;, &quot;Primal Concrete Sledge&quot;, &quot;13 Steps to Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Domination&quot;, and &quot;Becoming&quot;.
In 2009, he started American Drummer Champions with the aide of friend and influence M. Ludowise, former Downset drummer.

In August 2013, Abbott was featured in a music video for Black Label Society&#x27;s cover of &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot;, appearing alongside a horse-masked Zakk Wylde. Wylde and Abbott were well known to be close friends, with Wylde also having been particularly close with Abbott&#x27;s brother Darrell before his death in 2004.

For several years, Abbott had been trying to publish a cookbook called &quot;Drumming up an Appetite with Vinnie Paul&quot;; his girlfriend, Chelsey Yeager, mentioned potential for a posthumous release in 2020.

==Death==
On June 22, 2018, Abbott died at his Las Vegas home at the age of 54. It was later revealed that Abbott had died from &quot;dilated cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease.&quot; News of his death was initially released on the official Pantera Facebook page, stating his association with the bands Pantera, Damageplan, and Hellyeah, along with a statement requesting that the privacy of his family be respected. Five days before his death, Abbott&#x27;s final performance took place at The Vinyl at the Hard Rock Hotel and Resort in Las Vegas. 

Following his death, tributes from all over the metal community began pouring in, including members of Black Sabbath, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Metallica, Megadeth, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Periphery, Slipknot, Avenged Sevenfold, the Acacia Strain, In Flames, and many others. He is buried beside his mother, Carolyn, and brother, Darrell, at Moore Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Arlington, Texas. In late 2020, a protective fence was installed around the Abbott burial ground in an effort to stop vandalism; years earlier, following the defacing of his brother&#x27;s grave, Abbott had remarked that the vandalism was &quot;a real disrespectful thing&quot;.

==Equipment==

Abbott used Tama drums during the &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; album and tour from 1990 until 1992. On the &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; and &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; albums and tours respectively, he used Remo drums. Abbott endorsed Remo until &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot;, when he changed his endorsement to Pearl drums. He endorsed Pearl from 1996 until 2008, when he made his latest change to ddrum. Abbott used Sabian cymbals and Vic Firth drumsticks throughout his career. He played the drumsticks backwards, holding the tapered end of the sticks. The tapered ends were carved to give extra grip. Abbott was also known for using triggered samples mixed with live-miced drums during live shows. Starting in 2010, he used a ddrum Vinnie Paul signature series drum kit, with Evans drum heads, drum hardware, ddrum and Roland electronics, and Danmar red wood beaters and kick pads.

<text>The Malayali people (; also spelt Malayalee and sometimes known by the demonym Keralite) are a Dravidian ethnolinguistic group originating from the present-day state of Kerala and Union Territory of Lakshadweep in India, occupying its southwestern Malabar coast. They form the majority of the population in Kerala and Lakshadweep. They are predominantly native speakers of the Malayalam language, one of the eleven classical languages of India. The state of Kerala was created in 1956 through the States Reorganisation Act. Prior to that, since the 1800s existed the Kingdom of Travancore, the Kingdom of Cochin, Malabar District, and South Canara of the British India. The Malabar District was annexed by the British through the Third Mysore War (1790–92) from Tipu Sultan. Before that, the Malabar District was under various kingdoms including the Zamorins of Calicut, Kingdom of Tanur, Arakkal kingdom, Kolathunadu, Valluvanad, and Palakkad Rajas.

According to the Indian census of 2011, there are approximately 33 million Malayalis in Kerala, making up 97% of the total population of the state. Malayali minorities are also found in the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu, mainly in Kanyakumari district and Nilgiri district and Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu districts of Karnataka and also in other metropolitan areas of India. Over the course of the later half of the 20th century, significant Malayali communities have emerged in Persian Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait and to a lesser extent, other developed nations with a primarily immigrant background such as Malaysia, Singapore, the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, New Zealand and Canada. As of 2013, there were an estimated 1.6 million ethnic Malayali expatriates worldwide. The estimated population of Malayalees in Malaysia in year 2020 is approximately 348,000, which makes up 12.5% of the total number of Indian population in Malaysia that makes them the second biggest Indian ethnic group in Malaysia, after the Tamils. Most of the Malayalee population in Malaysia aged 18 to 30 are known to be either the third, fourth, or fifth generation living as a Malaysian citizen. According to A. R. Raja Raja Varma, Malayalam was the name of the place, before it became the name of the language spoken by the people.

==Etymology==
Malayalam, the native language of Malayalis, has its origin from the words &quot;mala&quot; meaning &quot;mountain&quot; and &quot;alam&quot; meaning &quot;land&quot; or &quot;locality&quot;. Kerala was usually known as &quot;Malabar&quot; in the foreign trade circles in the medieval era. Earlier, the term &quot;Malabar&quot; had also been used to denote Tulu Nadu and Kanyakumari which lie contiguous to Kerala in the southwestern coast of India, in addition to the modern state of Kerala. The people of Malabar were known as &quot;Malabars&quot;. Until the arrival of the East India Company, the term &quot;Malabar&quot; was used as a general name for Kerala, along with the term &quot;Kerala&quot;. From the time of Cosmas Indicopleustes (6th century CE) itself, the Arab sailors used to call Kerala as &quot;Male&quot;. The first element of the name, however, is attested already in the &quot;Topography&quot; written by Cosmas Indicopleustes. This mentions a pepper emporium called &quot;Male&quot;, which clearly gave its name to Malabar (&#x27;the country of Male&#x27;). The name &quot;Male&quot; is thought to come from the Dravidian word &quot;Mala&quot; (&#x27;hill&#x27;). Al-Biruni () is the first known writer to call this country &quot;Malabar&quot;. Authors such as Ibn Khordadbeh and Al-Baladhuri mention Malabar ports in their works. The Arab writers had called this place &quot;Malibar&quot;, &quot;Manibar&quot;, &quot;Mulibar&quot;, and &quot;Munibar&quot;. &quot;Malabar&quot; is reminiscent of the word &quot;Malanad&quot; which means &quot;the land of hills&quot;. According to William Logan, the word &quot;Malabar&quot; comes from a combination of the Dravidian word &quot;Mala&quot; (hill) and the Persian/Arabic word &quot;Barr&quot; (country/continent). Hence the natives of Malabar Coast were known as &quot;Malabarese&quot; or &quot;Malabari&quot; in the foreign trade circles. The words &quot;Malayali&quot; and &quot;Malabari&quot; are synonymous to each other. 
The &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; mentions the ecclesiastical office of the Thachudaya Kaimal who is referred to as &quot;Manikkam Keralar&quot; (The Ruby King of Kerala), synonymous with the deity of the Koodalmanikyam temple.

==Geographic distribution and population==

Malayalam is a language spoken by the native people of southwestern India (from Mangalore to Kanyakumari) and the islands of Lakshadweep in Arabian Sea. According to the Indian census of 2001, there were 30,803,747 speakers of Malayalam in Kerala, making up 93.2% of the total number of Malayalam speakers in India, and 96.7% of the total population of the state. There were a further 701,673 (2.1% of the total number) in Tamil Nadu, 557,705 (1.7%) in Karnataka and 406,358 (1.2%) in Maharashtra. The number of Malayalam speakers in Lakshadweep is 51,100, which is only 0.15% of the total number, but is as much as about 84% of the population of Lakshadweep. In all, Malayalis made up 3.22% of the total Indian population in 2001. Of the total 33,066,392 Malayalam speakers in India in 2001, 33,015,420 spoke the standard dialects, 19,643 spoke the &quot;Yerava&quot; dialect and 31,329 spoke non-standard regional variations like &quot;Eranadan&quot;. As per the 1991 census data, 28.85% of all Malayalam speakers in India spoke a second language and 19.64% of the total knew three or more languages. Malayalam was the most spoken language in erstwhile Gudalur taluk (now Gudalur and Panthalur taluks) of Nilgiris district in Tamil Nadu which accounts for 48.8% population and it was the second most spoken language in Mangalore and Puttur taluks of South Canara accounting for 21.2% and 15.4% respectively according to 1951 census report. 25.57% of the total population in the Kodagu district of Karnataka are Malayalis, in which Malayalis form the largest linguistic group in Virajpet Taluk. Around one-third of the Malayalis in Kodagu district speak the Yerava dialect according to the 2011 census, which is native to Kodagu and Wayanad. Around one-third of population in Kanyakumari district are also Malayalis. As of 2011 India census, Mahé district of Union Territory of Puducherry had a population of 41,816, predominantly Malayalis.

Just before independence, Malaya attracted many Malayalis. Large numbers of Malayalis have settled in Chennai (Madras), Delhi, Bangalore, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Mumbai (Bombay), Ahmedabad and Chandigarh. Many Malayalis have also emigrated to the Middle East, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe. As of 2009–2013, there were approximately 146,000 people with Malayali heritage in the United States, with an estimated 40,000 living in the New York tri-state area. There were 7,093 Malayalam speakers in Australia in 2006. The 2001 Canadian census reported 7,070 people who listed Malayalam as their mother tongue, mostly in the Greater Toronto Area and Southern Ontario. In 2010, the Census of Population of Singapore reported that there were 26,348 Malayalees in Singapore. The 2006 New Zealand census reported 2,139 speakers. 134 Malayalam speaking households were reported in 1956 in Fiji. There is also a considerable Malayali population in the Persian Gulf regions, especially in Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, UAE, Kuwait and European region mainly in London. The city of Chennai has the highest population of Malayalis in a metropolitan area outside Kerala, followed by Bangalore.

Besides, the Malayalee citizens in Malaysia are estimated to be 229,800 in the year 2020 whereas the population of the Malayalee expatriates is approximately 2,000. They make up around 10 percent of the total number of Indians in Malaysia.

==History and culture==

During the ancient period, the people of present-day Kerala were ruled by the Chera dynasty of Tamilakam, with their capital at Vanchi. 

The Malayalis live in a historic area known as the Malabar coast, which for thousands of years has been a major center of the international spice trade, operating at least from the Roman era with Ptolemy documenting it on his map of the world in 150 AD. For that reason, a highly distinct culture was created among the Malayali due to centuries of contact with foreign cultures through the spice trade. The arrival of the Cochin Jews, the rise of Saint Thomas Christians, and the growth of Mappila Muslim community, in particular, were very significant in shaping modern-day Malayali culture. Later, Portuguese Latin Christians, Dutch Malabar, French Mahe, and British English, which arrived after 1498 left their mark through colonialism and pillaging their resources.

In 2017, a detailed study of the evolution of the Singapore Malayalee community over a period of more than 100 years was published as a book: From Kerala to Singapore: Voices of the Singapore Malayalee Community. It is believed to be the first in-depth study of the presence of a NRI Malayalee community outside of Kerala.

===Language and literature===

Although disputed, the widely held view consider the Malayalam language to be descended from a dialect of early middle Tamil Language spoken on the Malabar coast, and largely arose because of its geographical isolation from the rest of the Tamil speaking areas. The Sangam literature can be considered as the ancient predecessor of Malayalam. Malayalam literature is ancient in origin, and includes such figures as the 14th century Niranam poets (Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar), whose works mark the dawn of both modern Malayalam language and indigenous Keralite poetry. Some linguists claim that an inscription found from Edakkal Caves, Wayanad, which belongs to 3rd century CE (approximately 1,800 years old), is the oldest available inscription in Malayalam, as they contain two modern Malayalam words, &quot;Ee&quot; (This) and &quot;Pazhama&quot; (Old), those are not found in literary Tamil. Although this has been disputed by scholars who regard it as a regional dialect of Old Tamil. The use of the pronoun and the lack of the literary Tamil ending are archaisms from Proto-Dravidian rather than unique innovations of Malayalam. The origin of Malayalam calendar dates back to year 825 CE. It is generally agreed that the Quilon Syrian copper plates of 849/850 CE is the available oldest inscription written in Old Malayalam. For the first 600 years of Malayalam calendar, the literature mainly consisted of the oral Ballads such as &quot;Vadakkan Pattukal&quot; (Northern Songs) in North Malabar and &quot;Thekkan Pattukal&quot; (Southern songs) in Southern Travancore. The earliest known literary works in Malayalam are &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; and &quot;Thirunizhalmala&quot;, two epic poems written in Old Malayalam. Malayalam literature has been presented with 6 Jnanapith awards, the second-most for any Dravidian language and the third-highest for any Indian language.

Designated a &quot;Classical Language in India&quot; in 2013, it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poets Cherusseri Namboothiri (Born near Kannur), Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan (Born near Tirur), and Poonthanam Nambudiri (Born near Perinthalmanna), in the 15th and the 16th centuries of Common Era. Kunchan Nambiar, a Palakkad-based poet also influenced a lot in the growth of modern Malayalam literature in its pre-mature form, through a new literary branch called &quot;Thullal&quot;. The prose literature, criticism, and Malayalam journalism, began following the latter half of 18th century CE. The first travelogue in any Indian language is the Malayalam &quot;Varthamanappusthakam&quot;, written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar in 1785.

The Triumvirate of poets (&quot;Kavithrayam&quot;: Kumaran Asan, Vallathol Narayana Menon and Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer) are recognized for moving Keralite poetry away from archaic sophistry and metaphysics and towards a more lyrical mode. In 19th century Chavara Kuriakose Elias, the founder of Carmelites of Mary Immaculate and Congregation of Mother of Carmel congregations, contribute different streams in the Malayalam Literature. All his works are written between 1829 and 1870. Chavara&#x27;s contribution to Malayalam literature includes, Chronicles, Poems – athmanuthapam (compunction of the soul), Maranaveettil Paduvanulla Pana (Poem to sing in the bereaved house) and Anasthasiayude Rakthasakshyam – and other Literary works . Contemporary Malayalam literature deals with social, political, and economic life context. The tendency of the modern poetry is often towards political radicalism. The writers like Kavalam Narayana Panicker have contributed much to Malayalam drama. In the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith winning poets and writers like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, O. N. V. Kurup, and Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri, had made valuable contributions to the modern Malayalam literature. Later, writers like O. V. Vijayan, Kamaladas, M. Mukundan, Arundhati Roy, and Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, have gained international recognition.

Arabi Malayalam (also called Mappila Malayalam and Moplah Malayalam) was the traditional Dravidian language of the Mappila Muslim community in Malabar Coast. The poets like Moyinkutty Vaidyar and Pulikkottil Hyder have made notable contributions to the Mappila songs, which is a genre of the Arabi Malayalam literature. The Arabi Malayalam script, otherwise known as the Ponnani script, is a writing system - a variant form of the Arabic script with special orthographic features - which was developed during the early medieval period and used to write Arabi Malayalam until the early 20th century CE. Though the script originated and developed in Kerala, today it is predominantly used in Malaysia and Singapore by the migrant Muslim community.

The modern Malayalam grammar is based on the book &quot;Kerala Panineeyam&quot; written by A. R. Raja Raja Varma in late 19th century CE. World Malayali Council with its sister organisation, International Institute for Scientific and Academic Collaboration (IISAC) has come out with a comprehensive book on Kerala titled &#x27;Introduction to Kerala Studies,’ specially intended for the Malayali diaspora across the globe. J.V. Vilanilam, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Kerala; Sunny Luke, medical scientist and former professor of Medical Biotechnology at Adelphi University, New York; and Antony Palackal, professor of sociology at the Loyola College of Social Sciences in Thiruvananthapuram, have edited the book, besides making other contributions to it.

===Tharavadu===
Tharavad, also spelled as Tharavadu is the ancestral home of aristocratic families in Kerala, which usually served as the common house for the matrilineal joint family system practiced in the state. Each Tharavadu has a unique name. The Tharavadu was administered by the &quot;Karanavar&quot;, the oldest male member of the family. He would be the eldest maternal uncle of the family as well. The members of the Tharavadu consisted of mother, daughters, sons, sisters and brothers. The fathers and husbands had a very minimal role to play in the affairs of the Tharavadu. It was a true matrilineal affair. The Karanavar took all major decisions. He was usually autocratic. However, the consent of the eldest female member of the family was taken before implementing the decisions. This eldest female member would be his maternal grandmother, own mother, mother&#x27;s sister, his own sister or a sister through his maternal lineage. Since the lineage was through the female members, the birth of a daughter was always welcomed. Each Tharavadu also has a &quot;Para Devatha&quot; (clan deity) revered by those in the particular Tharavadu. Temples were built to honour these deities.

Kerala&#x27;s society is less patriarchal than the rest of India. Certain Hindu communities such as the Nairs, Muslims around Kannur, Some parts of Kozhikode district and Ponnani in Malappuram, and Varkala and Edava in Thiruvananthapuram used to follow a traditional matrilineal system known as &quot;marumakkathayam&quot; which has in the recent years (post-Indian independence) ceased to exist. Christians, majority of the Muslims, Kerala&#x27;s gender relations are among the most equitable in India and the Majority World.

===Architecture===
Kerala, the ancestral land of the Malayali people, has a tropical climate with excessive rains and intensive solar radiation. The architecture of this region has evolved to meet these climatic conditions by having the form of buildings with low walls, sloping roof and projecting caves. The setting of the building in the open garden plot was again necessitated by the requirement of wind for giving comfort in the humid climate.

Timber is the prime structural material abundantly available in many varieties in Kerala. Perhaps the skillful choice of timber, accurate joinery, artful assembly, and delicate carving of the woodwork for columns, walls and roofs frames are the unique characteristics of Malayali architecture. From the limitations of the materials, a mixed-mode of construction was evolved in Malayali architecture. The stonework was restricted to the plinth even in important buildings such as temples. Laterite was used for walls. The roof structure in timber was covered with palm leaf thatching for most buildings and rarely with tiles for palaces or temples. The &quot;Kerala murals&#x27; are paintings with vegetable dyes on wet walls in subdued shades of brown. The indigenous adoption of the available raw materials and their transformation as enduring media for architectural expression thus became the dominant feature of the Malayali style of architecture.

====Nalukettu====
Nalukettu was a housing style in Kerala. Nalukettu is a quadrangular building constructed after following the &quot;Tachu Sastra&quot; (Science of Carpentry). It was a typical house that was flanked by out-houses and utility structures. The large house-Nalukettu is constructed within a large compound. It was called Nalukettu because it consisted of four wings around a central courtyard called &quot;Nadumuttom&quot;. The house has a quadrangle in the center. The quadrangle is in every way the center of life in the house and very useful for the performance of rituals. The layout of these homes was simple, and catered to the dwelling of numerous people, usually part of a tharavadu. &quot;Ettukettu&quot; (eight halls with two central courtyards) or &quot;Pathinarukettu&quot; (sixteen halls with four central courtyards) are the more elaborate forms of the same architecture.

An example of a Nalukettu structure is &quot;Mattancherry Palace&quot;.

===Performing arts and music===


Malayalis use two words to denote dance, which is &quot;attom&quot; and &quot;thullal&quot;. The art forms of Malayalis are classified into three types: &quot;religious&quot;, such as Theyyam and Bhagavatipattu; &quot;semi religious&quot;, like Sanghakali and Krishnanattom; and &quot;secular&quot;, such as Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, and Thullal. &quot;Kathakali&quot; and &quot;Mohiniyattam&quot; are the two classical dance forms from Kerala. Kathakali is actually a &quot;dance-drama&quot;. Mohiniyattam is a very sensual and graceful dance form that is performed both solo and in a group by women. Kutiyattam is a traditional performing art form from Kerala, which is recognised by UNESCO and given the status &quot;Masterpieces of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&quot;. Ottamthullal is another performing art, which is also known as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s Kathakali&quot;, which was created by the poet Kunchan Nambiar as an alternative to &quot;Chakiarkooth&quot; (another performing art), which was open only for higher castes to see. Theyyam is a ritualistic art form of Malayalis, which is thought to predate hinduism and to have developed from folk dances performed in conjunction with harvest celebrations. Theyyam is performed as an offering to gods so as to get rid of poverty and illness. Velakali is another ritualistic art form, mainly performed at temples in the festival time. Kolkali is a folk art in which dance performers move in a circle, striking small sticks and keeping rhythm with special steps.

Many ancient Malayali family houses in Kerala have special snake shrines called &quot;Kavu&quot;. Sarpam Thullal is usually performed in the courtyard of houses having snake shrines. This is a votive offering for family wealth and happiness. Kerala Natanam (കേരള നടനം) (Kerala Dance) is a new style of dance that is now recognized as a distinct classical art form evolved from Kathakali. The Indian dancer Guru Gopinath (ഗുരു ഗോപിനാഥ്‌) a well-trained Kathakali artist and his wife Thankamani Gopinath developed this unique form of dance.

Performing arts in Kerala is not limited to a single religion of the Malayali society. Muslim Mappilas, Nasranis Mappilas and Latin Christians have their own unique performing art forms. Duff Muttu, also known as &quot;Dubh Muttu/Aravanamuttu&quot; is a performing art form prevalent among the Muslim community. It is a group performance, staged as a social event during festivals and nuptial ceremonies.

Oppana is a popular form of social entertainment among the Muslim community. It is a form accompanied by clapping of hands, in which both men and women participate.

Margamkali is a performing art which is popular among the Nasrani Mappilas. It combines both devotion and entertainment, and was performed by men in groups. Since 1980&#x27;s women also have found groups. The dancers themselves sing the &quot;margamkali songs&quot; in unison call and response form. &quot;Parichamuttukali&quot; is another performing art which is popular among Nasranis. This is an artistic adaptation of the martial art of Kerala, Kalaripayattu. &quot;Chavittu nadakom&quot; is a theatrical art form observed mainly by Kerala Latin Christians, dating back to the second half of the 16th century.

However, many of these native art forms largely play to tourists or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among ordinary Keralites. Thus, more contemporary forms – including those heavily based on the use of often risqué and politically incorrect mimicry and parody – have gained considerable mass appeal in recent years. Indeed, contemporary artists often use such modes to mock socioeconomic elites. Since 1930 when the first Malayalam film Vigathakumaran was released and over the following decade or two, Malayalam Cinema had grown to become one of the popular means of expression for both works of fiction and social issues, and it remains so.

Music formed a major part of early Malayalam literature, which is believed to have started developing by 9th century CE. The significance of music in the culture of Kerala can be established just by the fact that in Malayalam language, musical poetry was developed long before prose. Kerala is musically known for Sopanam. Sopanam is religious in nature, and developed through singing invocatory songs at the Kalam of Kali, and later inside temples. Sopanam came to prominence in the wake of the increasing popularity of Jayadeva&#x27;s Gita Govinda or Ashtapadis. Sopana &quot;sangeetham&quot; (music), as the very name suggests, is sung by the side of the &quot;holy steps&quot; (sopanam) leading to the sanctum sanctorum of a shrine. It is sung, typically employing plain notes, to the accompaniment of the small, hourglass-shaped ethnic drum called &quot;idakka&quot;, besides the chengila or the handy metallic gong to sound the beats.

Sopanam is traditionally sung by men of the Maarar and Pothuval community, who are Ambalavasi (semi-Brahmin) castes engaged to do it as their hereditary profession. Kerala is also home of Carnatic music. Legends like Swati Tirunal, Shadkala Govinda Maarar, Sangitha Vidwan Gopala Pillai Bhagavathar, Chertala Gopalan Nair, M. D. Ramanathan, T.V.Gopalakrishnan, M.S. Gopalakrishnan, L. Subramaniam T.N. Krishnan &amp; K. J. Yesudas are Malayali musicians. Also among the younger generations with wide acclaim and promise is Child Prodigy Violinist L. Athira Krishna etc., who are looked upon as maestros of tomorrow.

Kerala also has a significant presence of Hindustani music as well. The king of Travancore, Swathi Thirunal patronaged and contributed much to the Hindustani Music. The pulluvar of Kerala are closely connected to the serpent worship. One group among these people consider the snake gods as their presiding deity and performs certain sacrifices and sing songs. This is called &quot;Pulluvan Pattu&quot;. The song conducted by the pulluvar in serpent temples and snake groves is called Sarppapaattu, Naagam Paattu, Sarpam Thullal, Sarppolsavam, Paambum Thullal or Paambum Kalam. Mappila Paattukal or &quot;Mappila Songs&quot; are folklore Muslim devotional songs in the Malayalam language. Mappila songs are composed in colloquial Malayalam and are sung in a distinctive tune. They are composed in a mixture of Malayalam and Arabic.

Film music, which refers to playback singing in the context of Indian music, forms the most important canon of popular music in India. Film music of Kerala in particular is the most popular form of music in the state.

===Vallam Kali===

Vallam Kali is the race of country-made boats. It is mainly conducted during the season of the harvest festival Onam in Autumn. Vallam Kali include races of many kinds of traditional boats of Kerala. The race of Chundan Vallam (snake boat) is the major item. Hence Vallam Kali is also known in English as Snake Boat Race and a major tourist attraction. Other types of boats which do participate in various events in the race are &quot;Churulan Vallam&quot;, &quot;Iruttukuthy Vallam&quot;, &quot;Odi Vallam&quot;, &quot;Veppu Vallam (Vaipu Vallam)&quot;, &quot;Vadakkanody Vallam&quot;, and &quot;Kochu Vallam&quot;. Nehru Trophy Boat Race is one of the famous Vallam Kali held in Punnamada Lake in Alappuzha district of Kerala. Champakulam Moolam Boat Race is the oldest and most popular Vallam Kali in Kerala. The race is held on river Pamba on the moolam day (according to the Malayalam Era) of the Malayalam month Midhunam, the day of the installation of the deity at the Ambalappuzha Sree Krishna Temple. The Aranmula Boat Race takes place at Aranmula, near a temple dedicated to Lord Krishna and Arjuna. The President&#x27;s Trophy Boat Race is a popular event conducted in Ashtamudi Lake in Kollam.

Thousands of people gather on the banks of the river Pamba to watch the snake boat races. Nearly 50 snake boats or chundan vallams participate in the festival. Payippad Jalotsavam is a three-day water festival. It is conducted in Payippad Lake which is 35 km from Alappuzha district of Kerala state. There is a close relation between this Payippad boat race and Subramanya Swamy Temple in Haripad. Indira Gandhi Boat Race is a boat race festival celebrated in the last week of December in the backwaters of Kochi, a city in Kerala. This boat race is one of the most popular Vallam Kali in Kerala. This festival is conducted to promote Kerala tourism.

===Festivals===
Malayalis celebrate a variety of festivals, namely Onam, Vishu, Deepavali, and Christmas.

===Cuisine===
Malayali cuisine is not homogeneous and regional variations are visible throughout. Spices form an important ingredient in almost all curries. Kerala is known for its traditional , a vegetarian meal served with boiled rice and a host of side-dishes. The is complemented by , a sweet milk dessert native to Kerala. The is, as per custom, served on a banana leaf. Traditional dishes include , , , , , , , , (tapioca), (steamed rice powder), and . Coconut is an essential ingredient in most of the food items and is liberally used.

 is a culinary specialty in Kerala. It is a steamed rice cake which is a favorite breakfast of most Malayalis. It is served with either brown chickpeas cooked in a spicy gravy, and boiled small green lentils, or tiny ripe yellow Kerala plantains. In the highlands there is also a variety of served with (the boiled-down syrup from sweet palm toddy) and sweet boiled bananas. to steam the , there is a special utensil called a . It consists of two sections. The lower bulkier portion is where the water for steaming is stored. The upper detachable leaner portion is separated from the lower portion by perforated lids so as to allow the steam to pass through and bake the rice powder.

 is a pancake made of fermented batter. The batter is made of rice flour and fermented using either yeast or toddy, the local spirit. It is fried using a special frying pan called and is served with egg curry, chicken curry, mutton stew, vegetable curry and chickpea curry.

Muslim cuisine or Mappila cuisine is a blend of traditional Kerala, Persian, Yemenese and Arab food culture. This confluence of culinary cultures is best seen in the preparation of most dishes. &quot;Kallummakkaya&quot; (mussels) curry, &quot;Irachi Puttu&quot; (&quot;Irachi&quot; means meat), parottas (soft flatbread), &quot;Pathiri&quot; (a type of rice pancake) and ghee rice are some of the other specialties. The characteristic use of spices is the hallmark of Mappila cuisine. spices like black pepper, cardamom and clove are used profusely. The Kerala Biryani, is also prepared by the community.
The snacks include &quot;Unnakkaya&quot; (deep-fried, boiled ripe banana paste covering a mixture of cashew, raisins and sugar), pazham nirachathu (ripe banana filled with coconut grating, molasses or sugar), &quot;Muttamala&quot; made of eggs, &quot;Chattipathiri&quot;, a dessert made of flour, like baked, layered &quot;Chapati&quot;s with rich filling, &quot;Arikkadukka&quot; and so on.

===Martial arts===
Malayalis have their own form of martial arts called Kalaripayattu. This type of martial arts was used as a defensive mechanism against intruders. In ancient times, disputes between nobles (&quot;naaduvazhis&quot; or &quot;Vazhunors&quot;) were also settled by the outcome of a Kalaripayattu tournament. This ancient martial art is claimed as &quot;the mother of all martial arts&quot;. The word &quot;kalari&quot; can be traced to ancient Sangam literature.

Anthropologists estimate that Kalarippayattu dates back to at least the 12th century CE. The historian Elamkulam Kunjan Pillai attributes the birth of Kalaripayattu to an extended period of warfare between the Cheras and the Cholas in the 11th century CE. What eventually crystallized into this style is thought to have been a product of existing South Indian styles of combat, combined with techniques brought by other cultures. Kalaripayattu may be one of the oldest martial arts in existence. The oldest western reference to Kalaripayattu is a 16th-century travelogue of Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese explorer. The southern style, which stresses the importance of hand-to-hand combat, is slightly different than Kalari in the north.

<text>In temporal databases, valid-time is the time period when an event happened or something was true in the real world, or more formally when a fact was valid in the modeled reality.

The valid-time period is an interval based on event times, which are referred to as event [[Timestamp|datetime]] in data vault. Other names are application-time period or real-world timeline. supports valid time through so-called application time-period tables. In a database table, valid-time is often represented by two extra table-columns, such as codice_1 and codice_2. The time interval is closed at its lower bound (denoted by codice_3) and open at its upper bound (denoted by codice_4).

In integration layers (for example a data warehouse), the valid time is controlled by the source system which delivers data to the data warehouse. For many reasons, the valid timeline is different from the transaction timeline (which is when data arrives in the warehouse), and it is important that the data warehouse is capable of unambiguously reporting what actually happened in the past by combining these two timelines. In bitemporal data models, valid time and transaction time can be represented two-dimensionally in a Cartesian coordinate system. When data are delivered from the integration layer and is to be represented in a presentation layer (often in a dimensional model or wide table) it is often desirable to have the data on only one timeline.

== History ==
The term &quot;valid time&quot; was coined by Richard T. Snodgrass and his doctoral student (1986).

As of December 2011, ISO/IEC 9075, Database Language Part 2: SQL/Foundation included clauses in table definitions to define &quot;application-time period tables&quot; (that is, valid-time tables).

== Example ==

Valid time is the time for which a fact is true in the real world. In the example above, the Person table gets two extra fields, codice_5 and codice_6, specifying when a person&#x27;s address was valid in the real world. On 1975-04-04, John&#x27;s father proudly registered his son&#x27;s birth. An official will then insert a new entry to the database stating that John lives in Smallville from April, 3rd. Notice that although the data was inserted on the 4th, the database states that the information is valid since the 3rd. The official does not yet know if or when John will ever move to another place so in the database the codice_6 is filled with infinity (∞) or a very late date (like for example 2300-01-01). Resulting in this entry in the database:
On 1994-12-27 John reports his new address in Bigtown where he has been living since 1994-08-26. The Bigtown official does not change the address of the current entry of John Doe in the database. He adds a new one:
The original entry Person (John Doe, Smallville, 1975-04-03, ∞) is then updated (not removed!). Since it is now known that John stopped living in Smallville on 1994-08-26, the codice_6 entry can be filled in. The database now contains two entries for John Doe

When John dies the database is once more updated. The current entry will be updated stating the date of death as the last codice_6 for Bigtown, as John does not live in Bigtown any longer. No new entry is being added. The database now looks like this:

<doc id="1258447" wikidata="Q442075" url="?curid=1258447" title="Marton, New Zealand">
<text>Marton () is a town in the Rangitikei district of the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is situated 35 kilometres southeast of Whanganui and 40 kilometres northwest of Palmerston North.

Ngāti Apa are tangata whenua for the Marton area.

The town of Marton is the largest in the Rangitikei district, and began life as a private township in 1866, when shop and housing sections were sold at auction by local landowners.

The town had residents as of 

Marton has always been a service town for the fertile farming lands of the lower Rangitikei Rivers flood plains. Butter, wool, and flour have been among its agricultural products. The arrival of the railway in 1878 led to rapid growth in the area, which soon added industries such as engineering, sawmilling, and textile production to its economy.

==History==

For three years the small village was known as Tutaenui, named after the stream running through its centre. In 1869 local citizens changed the name to Marton to honour the birthplace of Captain James Cook in Middlesbrough, marking his landing in New Zealand exactly 100 years earlier. It is not known if this change of name was influenced by the mistranslation of &#x27;tutae&#x27; (meaning &#x27;dung&#x27;) and &#x27;nui&#x27; (meaning &#x27;large&#x27;). (Actual translation: &#x27;tu&#x27; -stand, &#x27;tae&#x27; -arrive, &#x27;nui&#x27; big; i.e., a &#x27;big gathering&#x27;).

From the start Marton was an ideal supply centre for district farmers, who first began arriving in the early 1850s. From butter and wool they moved on to growing wheat in 1863, and big crops led to three flourmills being launched in the area in 1864.

After the town itself opened up in 1866, general stores, two hotels and several blacksmiths soon started. Marton became a home base for the horse industry, with saddlers, wheelwrights, livery stables and coachbuilders competing for business, while Clydesdale and Suffolk Punch sires toured the district to build up the population of plough horses needed as new farms sprang into being.

The opening of the railway line joining Wanganui to Palmerston North in 1878, now part of the North Island Main Trunk railway (towards Palmerston North and Auckland) and the Marton - New Plymouth Line (towards Wanganui), turned Marton Railway Station into a thriving railway junction, and it held that position for the next 100 years. The move of the railway station in 1898 was followed by a large development of &#x27;Marton Extension&#x27;, to the south east, from 1907.

Timber from Rangitikei forests served the town&#x27;s two timbermills, the first from 1889 onwards.
Industry developed quietly at first in Marton, starting with flourmilling, brickmaking and wool presses. By the late 1950s there was an incredible array of industries and factories in action. They turned out products as diverse as men&#x27;s shirts, tractor safety cabs, soft drinks, vegetable salads, readymix concrete, field tiles, dog biscuits, knitwear, dried peas, electronic petrol pumps, vegetable digging machinery.

9 km from Marton was the large Lake Alice Hospital for psychiatric patients, which opened in 1950 and closed in 1999. It included a maximum security unit, and housed hundreds of patients during its 49 years of operation.

=== Newspapers ===
Marton’s first newspaper, the Rangitikei Advocate and Manawatu Argus, was started in 1875, with Alexander McMinn as editor. From 1891 to 1896 there was also the Mercury, published by Francis Arkwright. From 1903 to 1905 the Rangitikei Advocate was associated with the Farmers’ Advocate, a weekly published in Marton that was the official voice of the newly formed New Zealand Farmers’ Union. The Rangitikei Advocate closed on 1 February 1941. The weekly Rangitikei News ran from 1948 to 1955. It was replaced by the Rangitikei Mail. Feilding-Rangitīkei Herald now serves the area.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Marton&#x27;s climate is temperate and has few extremes compared to many parts of New Zealand. Summers are warm with average temperatures in the low 20s. The most settled weather occurs in summer and early autumn. Winters are mild and annual rainfall is moderate. Annual hours of bright sunshine can average over 2,000.
==Demographics==
Marton covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

<text>In temporal databases, transaction time is the time when some data has been loaded into a database. The time when a transaction is valid can be called the transaction time-period. It is a technical timeline controlled by a integration layer (for example a data warehouse). More formally, it is the point-in-time during which a fact stored in the database is considered to be true.

The period is an interval based on load times (called load datetime in data vault), also called inscription timestamp. Other names of the interval is assertion timeline), [[State (computer science)|state timeline]]) or technical timeline. has support for transaction time through so-called system-versioned tables. 

For many reasons, transaction time (when data arrives from a source system) is almost always different from valid time (when the event happened in the real world). For a data warehouse to unambiguously report what actually happened in the past it must be able to combine these two timelines. In bitemporal data models, valid-time and transaction time can be represented two-dimensionally in a Cartesian coordinate system. When data is delivered from the integration layer and is to be presented in a presentation layer (often in a dimensional model or wide table) it is often desirable to have the data on only one timeline.

In a database table, the transaction time is often represented as an interval allowing the system to &quot;remove&quot; entries by using two table-columns codice_1 and codice_2. The time interval is closed codice_3 at its lower bound and open codice_4 at its upper bound. When the ending transaction time is unknown, it may be considered as codice_5. Academic researchers and some relational database management systems (RDBMS) have represented codice_5 with the largest timestamp supported or the keyword codice_7. This convention is a technical workaround, and not technically precise.

== History ==
The term transaction time was coined by Richard T. Snodgrass and his doctoral student Ilsoo Ahn (1986).

As of December 2011, ISO/IEC 9075, Database Language Part 2: SQL/Foundation included clauses in table definitions to define &quot;system-versioned tables&quot; (that is, transaction-time tables).

<doc id="1258453" wikidata="Q959830" url="?curid=1258453" title="Terry Cooper (footballer, born 1944)">
<text>Terence Cooper (12 July 1944 – 31 July 2021) was an English football player and manager. He was a left back in the Leeds United team of the 1960s and 1970s, and featured for England at the 1970 Mexico World Cup. He later went on to manage both of Bristol&#x27;s football teams, Birmingham City and was twice manager of Exeter City.

==Early career==
Cooper was born in Brotherton, West Riding of Yorkshire. He was not discovered as a young player in the conventional manner – he simply turned up at Leeds United one day with his football boots in a paper bag, asking for a trial. He was granted his wish and impressed enough to be offered an apprentice contract.

Initially a left winger, Cooper was converted to a defensive role by Leeds boss Don Revie on signing at the age of 17. He made gradual progress in the first team over the next six years until Revie decided to make him the permanent No. 3 in 1966.

Cooper settled in thereafter earning a reputation as a full back of innovation, showing that the right levels of fitness, skill and an ability to cross the ball meant he could perform a devastating overlap down the left flank to support much-feared winger Eddie Gray. This was so successful it became a trademark of Leeds&#x27;s play. He could also &#x27;go inside&#x27;, joining attacks centrally and scoring some important goals.

==1960s==
In 1968, Leeds won the League Cup against Arsenal at Wembley. A poor and occasionally high-tempered match was settled by Cooper&#x27;s volley after a corner had been half-cleared, although Arsenal claimed their goalkeeper had been fouled by central defender Jack Charlton. Cooper subsequently featured in the team which won the Fairs Cup in the same season.

In 1969, Leeds won the League championship with Cooper making his contribution. Revie did not buy a reserve left back but instead used the utility player Paul Madeley to replace Cooper in the event of injury or suspension. He was given his debut for England by Alf Ramsey against France the same year, and England won 5–0 with Cooper putting on a classy individual showing.

==1970s==
In the summer of 1970, Cooper gave an excellent series of performances as England&#x27;s first choice left back at the World Cup in Mexico, which ended with defeat in the quarter-finals to West Germany. Leeds won the Fairs Cup again in 1971 but missed out on the League on the last day.

He seemed set to follow suit the next season as Leeds again chased League and FA Cup honours, but then suffered a broken leg in April 1972 during a League game at Stoke City. Aside from missing that season&#x27;s FA Cup final victory over Arsenal, Cooper missed a whole 20 months of football due to the complications of the injury. When he did come back, it was with just two appearances in the 1974 season, thereby missing out on a League championship medal – Leeds won it with a 29-match unbeaten start – due to a lack of games.

Cooper&#x27;s Leeds career was effectively over by the time he regained his fitness. The departure of Revie for the England job in 1974 and the emergence over the next season of Frank Gray, younger brother of Eddie, as well as the continued presence of Trevor Cherry (who Revie had bought as a central defender in 1972 but had ended up filling in at left back), rendered Cooper surplus to requirements. He left the club in 1975 to join Middlesbrough who were managed by former Leeds teammate Charlton.

==Later career==
After three years with Middlesbrough, playing more than 100 games, he moved on to Bristol City for two years, before being appointed as player-manager of rivals Bristol Rovers. After an unsuccessful period there, he subsequently assisted and played for his former Leeds skipper Billy Bremner at Doncaster Rovers. He was then approached to become player-manager at Bristol City following their consecutive relegations from the 1st to 4th divisions. Within two seasons, promotion to the Third Division was achieved with a fourth-place finish in 1983–84. Two years later he led the club to their first Wembley visit, winning the Associate Members&#x27; Cup Final against Bolton Wanderers in 1986. His management career also took in a period at the helm of Birmingham City sandwiched between two spells at Exeter City.

==Personal life==
Cooper and his wife Rosemary had three children. His son, Mark, and grandson, Charlie, also became footballers.

Cooper died on 31 July 2021, aged 77.

<doc id="1258455" wikidata="Q693162" url="?curid=1258455" title="Opus clavicembalisticum">
<text>Opus clavicembalisticum is a work for solo piano, notable for its length and difficulty, composed by Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji and completed on 25 June 1930.

At the time of its completion, it was the longest piano piece in existence, taking around 4–4½ hours to play, depending on tempo. Several of Sorabji&#x27;s later works, such as the &quot;Symphonic Variations for Piano&quot; (which probably last about nine hours) are even longer.

At the time of its completion, it was possibly the most technically demanding solo piano work in existence, mainly due to its extreme length and rhythmic complexity. However, some works conceived by New Complexity, modernist and avant-garde composers, along with Sorabji himself, were even more demanding; it is in this particular area that &quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot; is highly regarded and primarily receives its notoriety.

Sorabji may have partly been inspired to compose the work after hearing a performance of Busoni&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia contrappuntistica&quot; by Egon Petri; &quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot; is a homage to Busoni&#x27;s work to some degree. Sorabji&#x27;s earlier Toccata No. 1 (1928) (also for piano solo and a multi-movement work) shows similar Busonian influence and is in some ways a precursor of &quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot;.

== Structure ==
&quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot; has twelve movements of hugely varying dimensions: from a three-minute-long cadenza to an hour-long , containing a toccata, adagio, and passacaglia (with 81 variations). The work&#x27;s movements are set in three parts, each larger than the last:
The manuscript and publication both erroneously say that the sixth movement (Interludium primum) has forty-four variations instead of forty-nine.

== Composition and dedication ==
In a letter upon completion of the massive work on 25 June 1930, Sorabji wrote to a friend of his:

With a wracking head and literally my whole body shaking as with ague I write this and tell you I have just this afternoon early finished &quot;Clavicembalisticum&quot;... The closing 4 pages are so cataclysmic and catastrophic as anything I&#x27;ve ever done—the harmony bites like nitric acid—the counterpoint grinds like the mills of God... (underneath he quotes the last chord of the work, with &quot;I am the Spirit that denies!&quot;)
The dedication on the title page reads:
&quot;TO MY TWO FRIENDS (E DUOBUS UNUM) HUGH M&#x27;DIARMID and C.M. GRIEVE&quot;

and proceeds

&quot;LIKEWISE TO THE EVERLASTING GLORY OF THOSE FEW MEN BLESSED AND SANCTIFIED IN THE CURSES AND EXECRATIONS OF THOSE MANY WHOSE PRAISE IS ETERNAL DAMNATION.&quot;
J. Curwen &amp; Sons of London published the score in 1931.

== Performances ==
There have to date been over 20 performances of the complete &quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot;.

The first was by Sorabji himself on 1 December 1930, in Glasgow, under the auspices of &quot;The Active Society for the Propagation of Contemporary Music&quot;.

&quot;Pars prima&quot; was performed by John Tobin on 10 March 1936; this performance is noted to have taken approximately twice as long as the score dictates. This performance, and its reception, may have led to Sorabji&#x27;s &quot;ban&quot; on public performances of his works; he asserted that &quot;no performance at all is vastly preferable to an obscene travesty&quot;. Sorabji maintained this veto until 1976.

&quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot; was unperformed for the following 46 years until it was played by Geoffrey Douglas Madge in 1982. A recording of the performance was released on a set of four LPs, which are now out of print. Madge performed it in public in its entirety on six occasions from 1982 to 2002, including once in 1983, at Mandel Hall in Chicago, a recording of which was released by BIS Records in 1999.

John Ogdon publicly performed the work in London twice, towards the end of his life, and produced a studio recording of the work. Jonathan Powell gave his first performance of the work in London in 2003; he has since played it in New York (2004), Helsinki and St. Petersburg (2005) and, in 2017, he embarked on a tour with it to include performances in Brighton, London, Oxford, Karlsruhe, Glasgow, Brno and elsewhere.

The only other verifiable and complete public performances of this work have been given by Daan Vandewalle in Brugge, Madrid and Berlin, although some pianists have performed excerpts, which are usually the first two movements. For example, Jean-Jaques Schmid performed part of the work at the Biennale Bern 03 and Alexander Amatosi performed the first movement at the University of Durham School of Music in 2001.
