<text>Dame Alicia Markova DBE (1 December 1910 – 2 December 2004) was a British ballerina and a choreographer, director and teacher of classical ballet. Most noted for her career with Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes and touring internationally, she was widely considered to be one of the greatest classical ballet dancers of the twentieth century. She was the first British dancer to become the principal dancer of a ballet company and, with Dame Margot Fonteyn, is one of only two English dancers to be recognised as a prima ballerina assoluta. Markova was a founder dancer of the Rambert Dance Company, The Royal Ballet and American Ballet Theatre, and was co-founder and director of the English National Ballet.

==Early years==
Markova was born as Lilian Alicia Marks on 1 December 1910. Her father, Arthur, was Jewish by birth; her mother, Eileen (nee Barry), converted to Judaism.

The family lived in a two bedroom flat in Finsbury Park.

==Career==
Markova began to dance on medical advice to strengthen her weak limbs. She made her stage debut at age ten, performing the role of Salome in the pantomime &quot;Dick Whittington and His Cat&quot;, for which she was billed as Little Alicia, the child Pavlova. She began studying ballet with Princess Serafina Astafieva, a Russian ballerina living in London. Astafieva was a retired dancer of the Ballets Russes, a renowned ballet company founded by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev. Astafieva established the &quot;Russian Dancing Academy&quot; at The Pheasantry, King&#x27;s Road, Chelsea, and was responsible for teaching a number of notable British dancers including Margot Fonteyn and Anton Dolin. A blue plaque now marks the site of her former studio.

===Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes===
At the age of 13, Markova was observed in class by Diaghilev, who was visiting London in search of new talent for his ballet company. He invited her to join the Ballets Russes in Monte Carlo, which she did in 1925, one month after her 14th birthday. Due to her age, she performed a number of roles which were specially choreographed for her, also performing in a varied repertoire of new and established ballets. Alongside the many notable dancers, during this period she encountered a number of leading 20th century figures who created work for the company including Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Léonide Massine, George Balanchine, and Bronislava Nijinska.

===After Diaghilev===
Following the death of Diaghilev in 1929, Markova returned to England, where she became the founder Principal Ballerina of &quot;The Ballet Club&quot;, a company founded by Dame Marie Rambert. During this period, she was particularly noted for performing works by Frederick Ashton, who was unknown at the time, but would go on to become one of Britain&#x27;s most celebrated choreographers. The Ballet Club was to be the first professional ballet company in the United Kingdom, later becoming known as the &quot;Ballet Rambert&quot;. Now known as the Rambert Dance Company, it remains the oldest established dance company in the UK.

In 1931, Ninette de Valois founded the &quot;Vic-Wells Ballet&quot; in premises at Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre in London. A former colleague from Diaghilev&#x27;s company, she invited Markova to join the company as one of its founder dancers, which she did, forming a famous partnership with Anton Dolin. De Valois hired Frederick Ashton, who became the resident choreographer and later Artistic Director of the company. In 1933, de Valois appointed Markova as the first Prima Ballerina of the company, which is now the internationally renowned Royal Ballet.

It was after seeing the Camargo Society performance of &quot;Giselle&quot; with Olga Spessivtseva and Dolin in 1932 that Markova first realized the possibilities of the then-neglected ballet. In time it became her most treasured role and the one whose expressive possibilities she continued to develop throughout her career. Her premiere in the role was on New Year&#x27;s Day 1934 at the Vic.

In 1935, Markova and Dolin left the Vic-Wells ballet to form their own touring company known as the &quot;Markova-Dolin Company&quot;. The company toured extensively for two seasons and in 1936 Prince Wolkonsky joined the company as ballet master. Later in 1938 Markova joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, touring the world as the company&#x27;s star ballerina. The company was the first to tour ballet throughout the United States, taking the art form to audiences who had never seen ballet before. During this time, she was a key figure in the formation of the American Ballet Theatre, dancing with the company during its early years.

Markova appeared in ballets around the world, but is remembered mostly for her &quot;Giselle&quot;, as well as for &quot;The Dying Swan&quot; and &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;. During the Second World War she re-formed &quot;Les Ballets Russes&quot; in the United States and appeared as a dancer with Dolin in the Hollywood film, &quot;A Song for Miss Julie&quot;.

===English National Ballet===
In 1950, Markova and Dolin became the co-founders of the &quot;Festival Ballet&quot;, a company formed to celebrate the imminent Festival of Britain and backed by the Polish businessman Julian Brunsweg. Dolin was to be the company&#x27;s first Artistic Director, with Markova as Prima Ballerina. The company was formed to tour ballets to audiences that would otherwise be unable to experience ballet, and went on to tour extensively to less conventional venues both in the United Kingdom and internationally. It also established a number of educational programmes designed to make ballet accessible to new audiences. She remained the Prima ballerina until 1952, after which she continued to appear regularly as a guest dancer until her retirement from professional dancing.

In 1960, she collaborated with Indian classical dancer Ram Gopal to create a duet &quot;Radha-Krishna&quot; based on Hindu mythology, in which she danced as Radha, while he danced as Krishna. Today their collaboration is commemorated at the National Portrait Gallery, London where her bronze bust stands next to his portrait. In 1989, the Festival Ballet was renamed &quot;English National Ballet&quot; to reflect the company&#x27;s role as Britain&#x27;s only classical ballet company dedicated to touring ballets nationwide at an affordable price for audiences.
===Retirement===
Markova retired from professional dancing in January 1963 at the age of 52. Following her retirement, she continued to play an active role in the ballet and theatre industry as a teacher, director and choreographer. She was responsible for staging a number of ballets that she had performed with the Ballets Russes, also coaching dancers for roles she had created for choreographers such as Sir Frederick Ashton.

As a teacher she presented televised master classes and was also appointed Professor of Ballet and Performing Arts at the University of Cincinnati. In her later years, she continued to be a regular member of the teaching faculty for residential ballet courses such as the Yorkshire Ballet Seminars and the Abingdon Ballet Seminars, and was also President and a regular guest teacher at the Arts Educational Schools in London and Tring. She was also a governor and regular guest teacher at the Royal Ballet School.

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions, in January 1960 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Royal Festival Hall, and in October 1995, when Michael Aspel surprised her at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House. Markova was Patron/President of numerous dance organisations, including serving as President of English National Ballet, a Governor of The Royal Ballet and vice President of the Royal Academy of Dance.

===Death===
Some time after suffering a stroke, Markova died on 2 December 2004 in a hospital in Bath, one day after her 94th birthday. She never married. A funeral service was held at Bath&#x27;s Haycombe Crematorium. A memorial service of thanksgiving for her life and work was held at Westminster Abbey on 8 March 2005.

As part of the service, dancers of the English National Ballet company performed extracts from the ballet &quot;Giselle&quot; (Daria Klimentová, Dmitri Gruzdyev, Erina Takahashi, Arionel Vargas) and &quot;Les Sylphides&quot; (Agnes Oakes and Simone Clarke).

<doc id="1238368" wikidata="Q186215" url="?curid=1238368" title="Jim Jordan">
<text>James Daniel Jordan (born February 17, 1964) is an American politician currently serving in his ninth term in the U.S. House of Representatives as the representative for since 2007. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Jordan is a two-time NCAA national champion wrestler and a former college wrestling coach. In Congress, Jordan helped start the right-wing populist House Freedom Caucus, serving as its first chair from 2015 to 2017, and as its vice chair since 2017. Jordan was a prominent critic of Speaker of the House John Boehner, who resigned under Freedom Caucus pressure in 2015. He was the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee from 2019 to 2020, when he left to become the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, of which he became chair in 2023.

Jordan is a close ally of President Donald Trump. During Trump&#x27;s first presidency, Jordan sought to discredit investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election and staged a sit-in to prevent a Trump impeachment inquiry hearing over the Trump–Zelenskyy telephone controversy. After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Trump tried to overturn the election, Jordan supported lawsuits to challenge the election results and voted not to certify the Electoral College results. He refused to cooperate with the U.S. House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, which subpoenaed him on May 12, 2022.

Jordan, who opposed Kevin McCarthy during his failed bid to succeed Boehner as speaker in 2015, later became one of McCarthy&#x27;s closest allies; Jordan supported McCarthy during the January 2023 Speaker of the House election. After McCarthy was removed as speaker, Jordan stood in the October 2023 election to replace him. He became the second nominee of the House Republican Conference after Steve Scalise withdrew, but failed to win the speakership in three rounds of voting and had his nomination revoked.

==Early life and education==
Jordan was born in Troy, Ohio, the son of Shirley and John Jordan, and raised in Champaign County, Ohio. He attended and wrestled for Graham High School, graduating in 1982. He won state championships all four years he was in high school and compiled a 156–1 win–loss record.

After high school, Jordan went to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he became a two-time NCAA Division I wrestling champion. Jordan won the 1985 and 1986 NCAA championship matches in the weight class, defeating future multi time World and Olympic champion John Smith in the former. He lost the featherweight semifinal match at the 1988 US Olympic wrestling trials against Smith, failing to qualify for the Olympic team in freestyle wrestling. Jordan graduated from Wisconsin in 1986 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics. 

Jordan later earned a master&#x27;s degree in education from Ohio State University and received a Juris Doctor degree from the Capital University Law School in 2001. In a 2018 interview, Jordan said he never took the bar examination.

== Early career ==

===Ohio State wrestling assistant coach during team&#x27;s abuse scandal===

Jordan was an assistant coach with Ohio State University&#x27;s wrestling program from 1987 to 1995.

Richard Strauss was the wrestling team physician during Jordan&#x27;s tenure. Strauss died by suicide in 2005. In April 2018, Ohio State University began an independent investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by Strauss. The report concluded that Strauss had committed sexual abuse against 177 student-patients. The majority of abuse (143 victims) was categorized as genital fondling associated with medically unnecessary genital or rectal examinations. Of the 177, 153 were student-athletes, of which a plurality (48) were members of the men&#x27;s wrestling team.

Several involved persons have stated that Jordan surely knew of Strauss&#x27;s criminal misconduct but did not report it. Other wrestlers and Head Coach Russ Hellickson said he may not have known about the abuse. A spokesperson for Jordan denied the allegation, saying that &quot;chairman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it&quot;. No wrestlers have accused Jordan himself of sexual misconduct, but four former wrestlers named him as a defendant in a lawsuit against the university. Jordan has denied any wrongdoing and has described his accusers as &quot;pawns in a political plot&quot;.

=== Ohio General Assembly ===

Jordan was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in November 1994 and represented the 85th Ohio House district for three terms.

In 2000, Jordan was elected to the Ohio Senate over independent candidate Jack Kaffenberger with 88% of the vote. In 2004, Jordan defeated Kaffenberger again, with 79% of the vote.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

=== Elections ===
Jordan represents Ohio&#x27;s 4th congressional district, a primarily urban district, which includes Lima, Mansfield, Marysville, and Marion, and parts of Columbus.

Jordan first ran for Congress in 2006, where he won the Republican primary for the 4th district after 26-year incumbent Mike Oxley announced his retirement. Jordan defeated Democratic nominee Rick Siferd in the general election with 60% of the vote.

Jordan was reelected in 2008, defeating Democratic nominee Mike Carroll with 65% of the vote. In 2010, he was again reelected, defeating Democrat Doug Litt and Libertarian Donald Kissick with 71% of the vote. Jordan was reelected in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024.

=== Tenure ===
Jordan chaired the Republican Study Committee during the 112th Congress, while turning down a position on the Appropriations Committee. During the 2013 US government shutdown, he was described by Rolling Stone as the committee&#x27;s most powerful member. That group was the primary proponent and executor of the Republican congressional strategy to bring about a government shutdown in order to force changes in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

Jordan received a vote for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in the 113th Congress from a fellow right-wing conservative, Tea Party Caucus chairman Tim Huelskamp. Jordan received two votes for Speaker during the 114th Congress. On July 26, 2018, he announced his bid for Speaker after Paul Ryan retired; his campaign ended when Democrats took the majority in the House. Subsequently, Jordan campaigned for House minority leader. Former Ohio state representative Capri Cafaro said that Jordan &quot;is someone who has built a reputation as an attack dog, someone who is media savvy, someone who is a stalwart supporter of the president and who has the skill necessary to take the lead for the GOP&quot;. He lost his bid to Kevin McCarthy in a 159–43 vote. In 2023, Jordan returned to consideration for the speakership after McCarthy failed to win it after three rounds of voting.

Jordan was the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee from January 2019 to June 2020, with a brief interlude in March 2020. He was replaced by James Comer.

Jordan&#x27;s district has been redrawn over time to minimize urban area (such as Toledo, Columbus or Cleveland) and increase rural area; it now stretches from Lake Erie nearly to Dayton. In May 2019, a three-judge federal panel ruled Ohio&#x27;s congressional district map unconstitutional due to partisan gerrymandering and ordered Ohio to create a new map in time for the 2020 election. But after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Rucho v. Common Cause&quot; that courts could not review allegations of gerrymandering, the district boundaries were not to change until maps were redrawn in 2022.

In December 2021, the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack released the partial contents of a text message an unnamed lawmaker sent to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows before the scheduled final certification of presidential electors on January 6, 2021. The excerpt read: &quot;On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.&quot; The day after the release, Jordan acknowledged sending the message, but said he had merely forwarded it after receiving it from attorney Joseph Schmitz. Both Jordan and Meadows asserted that the committee had altered the context of the excerpt by misplacing a period.
As chair of the Judicial committee, Jordan received on 26 August 2024 a letter from Mark Zuckerberg in which the Facebook founder and Instagram magnate expressed regret about some of his firm&#x27;s actions in the period leading up to the 2020 US Presidential election. In the same letter he expressed regret over his &quot;covid misinformation&quot; actions. Zuckerberg wrote that the Biden White House &quot;pressured&quot; Meta to &quot;censor&quot; such content. Jordan&#x27;s fellow Republicans said the letter was a &quot;big win for free speech&quot;.

====Freedom Caucus====
During the 114th Congress, Jordan and eight other members of Congress founded the House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of conservatives working &quot;to advance an agenda of limited constitutional government&quot; in Congress. He served as the group&#x27;s first chair. The caucus was ultimately credited with pushing Speaker John Boehner into retirement.

====Legislation====

As of 2023, Jordan, who has served in the House of Representatives for over 16 years, has never sponsored a bill that later became law.

On May 2, 2014, Jordan introduced House Resolution 565, &quot;Calling on Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr., to appoint a special counsel to investigate the targeting of conservative nonprofit groups by the Internal Revenue Service&quot;. It passed on May 7, 2014. Holder, who had previously been found to be in contempt of Congress, failed to appoint a special counsel to investigate the alleged procedural abuses of IRS employees, including Lois Lerner.

In March 2017, Jordan criticized the newly introduced American Health Care Act, the Republican replacement bill for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, calling it an unacceptable form of &quot;Obamacare Lite&quot;. On May 4, 2017, he voted to pass a revised version of the legislation.

On June 13, 2018, Jordan and Representative Mark Meadows filed a resolution to compel the Department of Justice to provide certain documents to Congress relating to the ongoing congressional investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The resolution asserted that the DOJ was stonewalling congressional oversight and sought to give the DOJ seven days from its enactment to turn over documents related to both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein&#x27;s appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller as well as various decisions made by the FBI during the 2016 presidential election. Jordan issued a press release that stated: This resolution gives the DOJ seven days to turn over the documents that they owe Congress. Rod Rosenstein threatened congressional staff. When the bully picks on your little brother, you have to respond. It&#x27;s time for House Leadership to stand up and pass this resolution.

On July 25, 2018, Jordan and Meadows introduced articles of impeachment against Rosenstein, whom they accused of &quot;intentionally withholding embarrassing documents and information, knowingly hiding material investigative information from Congress, various abuses of the FISA process, and failure to comply with congressional subpoenas&quot;. Jordan stated that impeachment was necessary because: The DOJ is keeping information from Congress. Enough is enough. It&#x27;s time to hold Mr. Rosenstein accountable for blocking Congress&#x27;s constitutional oversight role.

Jordan and Representative Warren Davidson were the only members of Ohio&#x27;s congressional delegation and two of 60 members of Congress to vote in October 2019 against a bipartisan resolution that passed the House 354–60 condemning Trump&#x27;s unilateral withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Syria.

====Speaker elections====
Despite his support for Kevin McCarthy in the 2023 Speaker of the House of Representatives election, including nominating McCarthy on the second ballot, Jordan was nominated on the second ballot by Representative Matt Gaetz. He received 19 votes, enough to deny McCarthy the speakership in the second round. Jordan was nominated again on the third ballot by Chip Roy. He won 20 votes in the third ballot, with Byron Donalds switching from McCarthy to Jordan. This was enough to necessitate a fourth ballot, but Jordan got no votes on ballots 4 through 11, as all his supporters switched to Donalds. On the 12th ballot, Gaetz nominated Jordan again. He received four votes, enough to necessitate a 13th ballot when combined with the three for Kevin Hern. He was not nominated on the 13th or 14th ballot, but received six and two votes on each, respectively.

After the House removed McCarthy from the speakership on October 3, 2023, Jordan launched a bid for the speakership. His speakership bid was endorsed by Donald Trump. On October 11, Jordan was defeated by Steve Scalise for the Republican nomination for the speakership. However, after Scalise withdrew a day later after failing to consolidate the necessary votes, Jordan launched a second bid for the speakership and defeated Austin Scott for the Republican nomination. Jordan subsequently failed to win the speakership in the first two rounds of the House vote, garnering only 200 of the 217 votes needed to win in the first vote and only 199 votes in the second. A third round of voting occurred on October 20, 2023, where he garnered only 194 votes of the 217 votes needed to win in the third round. Following his third defeat, Jordan intended to continue his bid for the speakership, but instead was subsequently removed from his position as Speaker-designate by his Republican colleagues in a secret ballot.

==Political positions==
According to &quot;The Dayton Daily News&quot;, Jordan &quot;is known for being one of Congress&#x27; most conservative members&quot;.

Jordan has earned a perfect score from the American Conservative Union. He has voted consistently for anti-abortion legislation and was endorsed by Ohio Right to Life in 2012. During the 112th Congress, he was one of 40 &quot;staunch&quot; members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills.

Jordan was a leading critic of President Barack Obama&#x27;s Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) program, advocating for its shutdown.

Jordan has supported the continued production and upgrades of M1 Abrams tanks in his district.

Jordan, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

===Donald Trump===
Jordan has been a stalwart supporter and close ally of Trump. Asked by Anderson Cooper in April 2018 whether he had ever heard Trump tell a lie, Jordan said &quot;I have not&quot; and &quot;nothing comes to mind&quot;. He also said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know that [Trump has ever] said something wrong that he needs to apologize for.&quot;

In December 2017, Jordan sought to discredit the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller&#x27;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He questioned Mueller&#x27;s impartiality, and called on Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to use his authority to disband Mueller&#x27;s investigation or create a second special counsel to simultaneously investigate Mueller himself. Rosenstein rejected the request, saying that he could not appoint another special counsel as there was no credible allegation of a potential crime. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Republicans were increasingly criticizing Mueller&#x27;s investigation after it &quot;delivered a series of indictments to high-profile associates of the president and evidence that at least two of them are cooperating with the inquiry&quot;.

In July 2018, Jordan led efforts to impeach Rosenstein as a way to shut down Mueller&#x27;s investigation. During a hearing on July 12, 2018, Jordan repeatedly interrupted FBI agent Peter Strzok while Strzok tried to explain that he couldn&#x27;t answer specific questions to preserve the confidentiality of an ongoing investigation. Democrats protested Jordan&#x27;s behavior and urged their fellow representatives to allow Strzok to respond. They also objected to Jordan&#x27;s exceeding his allowed time for questioning. House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte admonished Jordan for his repeated interruptions of the witness.

In July 2018, Jordan and Mark Meadows called on the Department of Justice to &quot;review allegations that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein threatened to subpoena phone records and documents from a House Intelligence Committee staffer&quot;. In their written request, the two wrote that in his use of investigative powers, Rosenstein had retaliated &quot;against rank-and-file (congressional) staff members&quot;, thereby abusing his authority. To John Catsimatidis on WNYM, Jordan said he would force a vote on Rosenstein&#x27;s impeachment if the DOJ did not deliver documents Congress requested.

In March 2019, House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler criticized Jordan for allegedly using anti-Semitic messaging by spelling the name of the 2020 presidential candidate Tom Steyer, whose father is Jewish, with a &quot;$&quot; in place of an &quot;S&quot; on Twitter, while urging Nadler to resist calls for Trump&#x27;s impeachment.

During Mueller&#x27;s testimony to two congressional committees on July 24, 2019, Jordan asked Mueller why he never charged Joseph Mifsud with lying to the FBI while George Papadopoulos was charged for lying about Mifsud. Jordan said: &quot;Mifsud is the guy who told Papadopoulos [about Russian dirt]. He was the guy who started it all. Yet when the FBI interviews him, he lies three times; you don&#x27;t charge him.&quot; Mueller responded, &quot;Well, I can&#x27;t get into it and it&#x27;s obvious, I think, that we can&#x27;t get into charging decisions.&quot;

On October 23, 2019, Jordan and two dozen other Republicans staged a protest that delayed a Trump impeachment inquiry hearing. The coordinated action disrupted the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence where Republican and Democratic congressional members planned to take testimony from Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper. The group staged a sit-in outside the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) hearing room. Some of the Republicans who participated already had access to the hearings since the members of the House Oversight, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees were welcome to attend and ask questions.
Describing the sit-in, Jordan said, &quot;The members have just had it, and they want to be able to see and represent their constituents and find out what&#x27;s going on.&quot; The next day, he said on Fox News, &quot;Adam Schiff is doing this unfair, partisan process in secret and our members finally said, &#x27;Enough&#x27;... We&#x27;re so frustrated. They reached a boiling point and these guys marched in and said &#x27;we want to know what&#x27;s going on.&#x27;&quot;

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson wrote to the House sergeant-at-arms about Jordan, Representative Bradley Byrne, and others, requesting that he take action regarding their &quot;unprecedented breach of security&quot;. Senator Lindsey Graham admonished his House colleagues for their tactic, calling them &quot;nuts&quot; for having made a &quot;run on the SCIF&quot;.

As the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, during a July 2020 hearing with Attorney General Bill Barr, Jordan presented a video montage showing CNN reporters describing violent protests as &quot;mostly peaceful&quot;. CNN host Jake Tapper claimed that the statements by the CNN reporters in the video shown by Jordan had been taken out of context.

In December 2020, Jordan was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of &quot;election subversion&quot; and an attempt to &quot;subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions.&quot; New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, citing section three of the 14th Amendment, called for Pelosi to not seat Jordan and other amicus brief signers, arguing that they had tried to &quot;overturn a democratic election and install a dictator&quot;, while &quot;the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States&quot;.

When the Supreme Court in October 2020 permitted counting Pennsylvania mail-in ballots collected three days after the 2020 election, Jordan declared: &quot;Democrats are trying to steal the election, after the election.&quot; In December 2020, Jordan said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how you can ever convince me that President Trump didn&#x27;t actually win this&quot; 2020 election. On January 5, 2021, Jordan alleged: &quot;There was fraud on top of the unconstitutional way they ran the election [with pandemic voting laws] … they added fraud on top of it … And that&#x27;s why President Trump wasn&#x27;t elected president&quot;. On January 12, 2021, Jordan claimed: &quot;I&#x27;ve never said that this election was stolen&quot;.

On January 6–7, 2021, Jordan cast a vote to prevent the certification of the Electoral College in at least one state. He was one of the 139 representatives who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Congress on January 7, 2021, the day after the storming of the Capitol. At a later virtual committee meeting, Jordan said the storming of the Capitol &quot;was as wrong as wrong can be&quot;.

On January 11, 2021, Trump awarded Jordan the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a closed-door ceremony.

Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, testified before the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack that Jordan had talked to the White House about presidential pardons for Republican members of Congress who participated in attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election.

=== Antitrust and tech policy ===
Jordan has critiqued &quot;Big Tech&quot; companies, though he opposes proposals to break up these companies through antitrust enforcement.

Google has contributed money to his political campaign since 2012, including $10,000 in 2020. Tucker Carlson criticized Jordan for accepting donations from Google.

In 2023, Jordan refused to make Ken Buck the chairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, despite Buck being the most senior Republican on the committee and a proponent of antitrust enforcement. Conservatives criticized Jordan for this decision.

===Disinformation research===
As chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jordan is heading a legal campaign against researchers at universities, think tanks and private companies that study disinformation. Those affected include the Stanford Internet Observatory at Stanford University, the University of Washington, the Atlantic Council&#x27;s &quot;Digital Forensic Research Lab&quot; and the social media analytics firm &quot;Graphika&quot;.
Since January 2023, when Republicans gained a majority in the House, the House Judiciary Committee has sent letters, subpoenas, and threats of legal action to researchers, demanding notes, emails and other records from researchers and even student interns, dating back to 2015.

Projects affected include the &quot;Election Integrity Partnership&quot;, formed to identify attempts &quot;to suppress voting, reduce participation, confuse voters or delegitimize election results without evidence&quot; and the &quot;Virality Project&quot;, which has examined the spread of false claims about vaccines. Jordan claims that such organizations worked with the government to censor conservative speech online. Although research groups may have reported problematic content, &quot;no evidence has emerged that government officials coerced the companies to take action against accounts&quot;. Researchers argue that they have academic freedom to study social media and disinformation as well as freedom of speech to report their results.

Previous research has indicated that sharing of disinformation and propaganda within the United States has been associated with the development of increasingly &quot;partisan&quot; media, appearing most strongly in right-wing sources such as &quot;Breitbart&quot;, &quot;The Daily Caller&quot;, and Fox News.
The actions of Jordan and the House Judiciary Committee have been described by their opponents as an &quot;attempt to chill research&quot;, creating a &quot;chilling effect&quot; through increased time demands, legal costs and online harassment of researchers.

=== Health care and drug policy ===
Jordan opposes the Affordable Care Act, calling for it to be repealed. He opposes vaccine requirements, describing them as &quot;un-American&quot;.

Since coming into office, Jordan has voted in opposition to efforts to liberalize federal marijuana policy. Jordan supports the permanent classification of &quot;fentanyl-related substances&quot; as Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. In 2017, Jordan argued that &quot;the most beneficial things can be done at a local level&quot; in responding to the opioid epidemic.

===Environment===
In July 2008, Jordan was the first member of Congress to sign the &quot;No Climate Tax&quot; pledge drafted by the conservative political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.

In Congress, Jordan voted to open the Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling, prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, and bar greenhouse gases from Clean Air Act rules. He voted against enforcing limits on carbon dioxide global warming pollution, tax credits for renewable electricity, tax incentives for renewable energy and energy conservation, and curtailing subsidies for oil and gas company exploration.

===Abortion===
Jordan opposes abortion, and supports banning federal funding to Planned Parenthood.

On July 12, 2022, Jordan tweeted to &quot;The Washington Examiner&quot; that a report of a 10-year-old Ohio girl traveling to Indiana to obtain a legal abortion after being raped was a lie. He deleted the tweet on July 13 after the rapist was arrested by police and confessed to raping the girl twice, and police confirmed that the report of her abortion in Indiana was accurate.

===Taxes===
While serving in the Ohio Senate, Jordan supported the Tax and Expenditure Limitation Amendment, a state constitutional amendment that would require a vote of the people to raise taxes or increase spending over certain limits.

===Foreign policy===
Jordan was among 60 Republicans to oppose condemning Trump&#x27;s action of withdrawing forces from Syria. According to &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, along with Matt Gaetz and a handful of Republicans, he broke with the party and voted to end Saudi assistance to the war in Yemen.

In June 2021, Jordan was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq. In 2023, Jordan was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

Since the onset of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Jordan has reportedly voted in opposition to almost all bills to provide military assistance to Ukraine.

Jordan endorsed providing aid to Israel in the wake of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

=== LGBT rights ===
In 2015, Jordan cosponsored a resolution to amend the US constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Jordan condemned the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the Constitution.

=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a &quot;nay&quot; from Jordan. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV, Jordan also voted against the 2016 Veterans Equal Access Amendment.

=== COVID-19 ===
Jordan supported protests in April 2020 that opposed government lockdowns intended to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Jordan opposes vaccine mandates, calling them &quot;un-American&quot;. Jordan criticized Anthony Fauci during congressional hearings over his pandemic policy recommendations, and in 2021 called on Fauci to resign. In December 2021, when the mortality toll from COVID-19 in the United States averaged 1,659 deaths per day, Jordan declared that &quot;Real America is done with COVID-19. The only people who don&#x27;t understand that are Fauci and Biden.&quot; In 2023, Jordan invited activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who opposed Covid vaccine mandates, to testify before Congress about alleged censorship of his opinions on social media. Jordan defended a tweet by Kennedy which implied that Hank Aaron, who died in 2021 of natural causes, had passed away due to Aaron being administered the COVID-19 vaccine. Jordan said Kennedy&#x27;s tweet was not &quot;factually inaccurate. Hank Aaron, real person, great American, passed away after he got the vaccine. Pointing out, just pointing out facts.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Jordan and his wife, Polly, live near Urbana, Ohio, in central Champaign County. They were introduced by her brothers, with whom Jordan competed in wrestling.

<text>Benigembla () is a town and municipality in the Pop Valley within the district of Marina Alta in eastern Spain. The town is 314 m above sea level. It is only 50 km away from Benidorm, 88 km from Alicante, 105 km from Valencia, and 23 km from Dénia. Just 7.5 km (about 5 miles) from the town, in the direction of La Vall d&#x27;Ebo in an ancient Morisco site, &quot;Pla de Petracos&quot;, there are paintings over 8000 years old and UNESCO has designated it a protected world site of cultural interest. The town of Benigembla is also of Moorish origin, like most towns in the Pop Valley. In 1609 more than 14,000 Moors of the Pop Valley that resisted the decree of expulsion, and they gathered in the mountain of &quot;El Cavall Verd&quot; or &quot;el Pop&quot;. At the end, the Moors gave up because they were running out of food, water, and basic supplies. After giving up, most of the Moors were expelled after suffering high casualties.

After the decree of expulsion of the Moors from the year 1609, the village was repopulated mostly by Majorcan and western Catalan people. The village still retains many traditions and customs of these settlers, and also the language spoken by the villagers. At the summit of &quot;El Cavall Verd&quot; also known as &quot;La Muntanya del Pop&quot;, there are still some remains of an ancient castle called ´´El Castell de Pop´´. ´´El Castell de Pop´´ was owned by Al-Azraq, then by Pere d&#x27;Altafulla. Since 1329 was owned by Vidal de Vilanova and his successors. During the final period it was handed to ´´Jaume I el conqueridor´´ by the Jovada pact by Al-Azraq. Later, Peter the Great ordered its destruction, and today there are very few traces left. ´´El Castell de Pop´´gives its name to this enchanted valley in the Marina Alta.

==Demography==
In 1615 the town had a population of only 99 inhabitants, and it reached its peak in 1860 with almost 900 inhabitants. From the 1900s to 1960 the town lost 34% of its population, since most of the locals migrated to the U.S., France, Germany, and Algeria
Today the village has approximately 606 inhabitants, according to the latest municipal census of the year 2011. About 45% percent of the population is foreign, mostly British, these newcomers which started to settle in the 1980s and in the year 2009 they already represented 36% of the population. But there are also Germans and North Americans in town. The district of Vernissa Park is largely English speaking, since most of the people that settled in the urbanisation are British.

In 1998 there were 382 inhabitants in Benigembla, and in the census of the year 2006 the population reached 563 inhabitants, and in 2022 there are 512 inhabitants. Today there is 52% of the population according to the 2022 census that is foreign, of which about 67.5% are from the United Kingdom of Great Britain, while the rest come from North America, France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and Eastern Europe.

It is a very flat town surrounded by mountains, which one can find very enjoyable and relaxing. The main language spoken by its local inhabitants is the Catalan language, also known locally as Valencian, which the majority of the population speak and use as their main language. After the decree of the expelling of the Moors in 1609, the town was populated mostly by inhabitants from Catalonia, and the Balearic Islands. Most of the traditions of these settlers are still carried out today, together with the Catalan language that they brought with them.
In the table below we can see the different changes in Benigembla&#x27;s population from the year 1857 to 2007, according to the National Institute of Statistics(1). The population has been increasing since 1998, since more of the newcomers started to register in the municipal town&#x27;s census. Today the population of Benigembla is the most diverse population that has been since the existence of the town.


==Major festivities and traditions==
There are two major festivities during the year. In the 3rd week of January, the town celebrates its winter festivities in honour of &quot;Sant Honorat&quot; and &quot;Sant Antoni&quot; with its fayre, and the blessing of house pets and other animals, and other activities. During the summer in August, the town celebrates its major festivity from 12 to 17 August. During the summer festivity there are concerts, theatre, fireruns (&quot;correfoc&quot;), dancing, Valencian handball, running with the bulls, and religious celebrations. In autumn, there is usually a craft fair on the last weekend of October (darrer diumenge d&#x27;octubre).
==Environment==

Nestled in the Valley of Pop, on the River Gorgos at the foot of the mountains of &quot;El Cavall Verd&quot;, its relief is very wary and holds places worth visiting force throughout the municipal area of 18.4 km2, as the climb of &quot;&quot;El Cocoll&quot; or to &quot;El Cavall Verd&quot;, a mountain that looks like the face of a woman, the recreational area of the &quot;Safareig&quot;, and the camping area of &quot;la Vall de Pop&quot;&quot; just 750 m from the town.

The town is known from around the area for its many trails, and spectacular mountain views.
The highest mountain peak of Benigembla is represented by &quot;El Morro d&#x27;en Serra&quot; with 1,001 m. One of the walking trails of interest in town is The Route of &quot;&quot;El Mirabó&quot;.&quot; Other known mountains of Benigembla are: &quot;&quot;El Cavall Verd&quot; or &quot;el Pop&quot;(793 m), &quot;La Penya de l&#x27;Altar&quot; (949 m), &quot;La Solana&quot; (793 m), and also &quot;El Mirabó&quot; (691 m).

An interesting hiking trail is the climb to the top of &quot;Cocoll&quot;(1045 m), and it is a marked trail that starts in the Camí del Corral Nou, which is about 350 m from the town of Benigembla towards the road to Castell de Castells. We pass by over the well of el &quot;l&#x27; Aljub del Frare&quot; and by the cliff &quot;Barrancs dels Bous&quot;&quot;. A zigzag draw us closer to &quot;El Corral de Malea&quot;, and then to a more open space called la &quot;Corona&quot;. Then we arrived at the &quot;Pla d&#x27;en Moragues&quot;&quot; where there are planes and helicopters of the forest services. we followed then a forest track that leads to the top of Cocoll, which is very close. The views when the weather permits it, are magnificent and we can see clearly: &quot;El Cavall Verd&quot;, &quot;Carrascal d&#x27;Ebo&quot;, &quot;Alfaro&quot;, the &quot;Pla de Petracos&quot;, &quot;Serrella&quot;, &quot;Xortà&quot;, &quot;Aitana&quot;, &quot;Carrascal de Parcent&quot;.

There is a rare colony of the plant Caralluma mumbyana in the mountain of the Cavall Verd, a type of cactus with bright pink flowers that is indigenous to south-eastern Spain, that is at risk of extinction. There are only three other known colonies of the plant in the Valencian Country, and it is currently under the protection of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The river &quot;Xaló-Gorgos&quot; passes next to Benigembla, which borders the town from its west side to its east side, and it was designated, as a site of special community interest by the European Commission in 2005. The river &quot;Xaló-Gorgos&quot; is 55 km long, and it ends finally in the sea in Xàbia.

==Economy and tourism==
Farming and livestock were the pillars of the economy until the 1970s, but today most of the people work in the services sector, and farming is considered a complementary activity that is done basically on weekends and holidays. Still the farmers of Benigembla make wine, olive oil, and they produce almonds, figs, olives, and grapes among others.

The town also has two restaurants, two rural houses, a recreational area in The Safareig, and a camping area. The camping area is located just 1 km from Benigembla, on the road that leads to Castell de Castells. There is a swimming pool, a tennis court, and other facilities. Another site of interest of Benigembla is The Ribàs Botanical Garden next to the main square, with trees that are more than 100 years old, and other species of special botanical interest. The Ribàs Botanical Park went through a major renovation project, and 408 new vegetal species were planted 

In the Living Museum of Benigembla, art comes to life in its streets. Benigembla is also known for its graffiti, or Street Art. Every year in the late spring, or at the beginning of summer, a festival is organized in which graffiti artists from all over the world participate. Among the participants is Tardor Graffiti of the Xara, the Mexican Juan Andrés Vera, or Xolaka among many other renowned international street artists. 

This festival has been celebrated since 2018, filling the facades of the streets of Benigembla with art and color. One more opportunity to visit this charming town to soak up art. Many visitors come from all over to visit us because of the high quality of artwork.

Some of the exteriors of the film &quot;Her Majesty the Minor&quot; were filmed in the fields of Benigembla, in October 2006, a super European production of the French director Jean-Jacques Annaud, who also directed The films &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; and &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;.
==Architectural heritage==
* &#x27;The Parish Church of &quot;Saint Josep&quot;, of neoclassical style. Eighteenth century building with a baroque bell tower.
* &quot;El Safareig&quot;&quot;, and its recreational area with a barbecue site. It used to be the public town laundromat.

* The building &quot;El Sindicat&quot;, with neoclassic elements of the French baroque and rococo style.
* The Bridges on the road to Parcent and Murla, built by stonemasons.
* &quot;El Ribàs&quot;, the walls bordering part of the western part of the town and protecting it from flood waters of the river &quot;Xaló-Gorgos&quot; were also built by stonemasons.
*The Parish Church of &quot;Sant Josep&quot; was restored and decorated in 1994, and the great bell named &quot;Maria la Gran&quot; was repaired in the same year (Hermanos Portilla 1994). Another bell is the bell known as the bell from Vernissa, which is the small one named Santa Barbera (Domingo Tormo 1808), and finally the middle one which is named Maria Bàrbara (Dominic Tormo 1868).
*&quot;Els Riuraus&quot; A Riurau, typical construction of Benigembla where the grapes where preserved to dry when raining.
*&quot;&quot;El Sindicat&quot;, located at the corner of &quot;El Carrer Llarg&quot; and &quot;El Carrer Sant Francesc Xavier&quot;&quot;, which was always the social club of the town, and it is a building from the early twentieth century, specifically it was built in 1925 by the local architect Adelí Moll. The club belonged to members of the Cooperative Saint Francis Xavier, but the Town Council purchased the site in 2005 with the objective of rehabilitating its interior and restoring its facade. This building is of neoclassical style with elements of the rococo, and French baroque, which it may be due to the influence of returning benigemblers from the emigration from Algeria. In February 2010, the Town Council started the rehabilitation of the building with a budget of around 500,000 euros. The new &quot;Sindicat&quot; now has three floors, so this new building has more capacity and can better address the social and cultural needs of the whole town. The building is suitable for carrying on the one hand, exhibitions, conferences, seminars or classes for seniors, among other activities, and moreover, within the premises also can be conducted recreational dancing or physical fitness, etc.
*Also noteworthy are &quot;the walls of the &quot;Ribàs&quot;&quot;, which protects the w0estern side of town from the flood waters built by stonemasons at least more than 115 years ago.Following the flood of 1890, which was one of the most severe, these walls, made by stonemasons, were completed at the beginning of the 20th century. The town owes Mr. Baldomero Vega de Seoane, the deputy that was able to come up with the money and project for the construction of these retaining walls. Mr. Baldomero Vega de Seoane was a deputy in the Provincial Council of Alicante/Alacant of the liberal party of Canalejas. Currently the main square of the town bears his name in this place you will also find he Ribàs Botanical Park, a park that was recently renovated in 2022. There are trees over 100 years old, and other species of special botanical interest. It is a Botanical Park that is a reference park of Mediterranean biodiversity for the entire interior of the Marina Alta region. It is located in a place of great ecological and environmental interest next to the Gorgos river. It should also be mentioned that this area is an LIC.
==Politics==

In the municipal elections of May 2011 the nationalist valencian party Bloc Nacionalista Valencià-Compromís won three seats in the town council with 36 percent of the votes, the socialist valencian party PSPV-PSOE won two seats with 33 percent of the votes, and the conservative party PPCV two seats with 29 percent of the votes. The candidate for the BLOC party Joan Caselles i Mengual is elected mayot with the support of the other 2 councilmen of his own party. 
In the municipal elections of 2007 the People&#x27;s Party PPCV won three seats in the town council with 38% of the votes, the Valencian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSPV-PSOE) two seats with 27% of the votes, and the nationalist Valencian party denominated Bloc Nacionalista Valencià-Compromís one seat with 20% of the votes, and another local party also obtained one seat with 14% of the votes. In 2007. Fernando Mengual i Taverner of the PPCV was elected mayor with three votes out of the seven councilmen, however his inability to work with other councilmen, the lack of democratic transparency in the decision making process, together with the lack of support of his own party, and after three major defeats to his controversial plans to build three more urbanisations, which started to provoke distrust and discontent. As a result, on 23 August 2008, a vote of no confidence was presented by the three opposition parties, which resulted in voting and proclaiming the councilman of the Bloc party, Joan Caselles i Mengual as mayor of Benigembla, with the support of the two socialist seats and the other seat from the other local party. 

In the municipal elections of 2003 the PP obtained four seats, and the PSPV-PSOE three seats, but they were all pressured to resign from their seats, except one councillor, after the town council has signed in November 2004 a secret controversial plan with a known major developer, to build a massive urbanisation with 1500 new houses, and a golf course. The contract that was signed secretly would have been unsustainable for the municipal services of this town, and would have given the developer all the decision making regarding the future urban development of the town. In 2005, the major Aurelio Llinares i Mas of the PP party resigned, and Felipe Perez i Mengual took over as mayor until 2007. The plan to build 1500 houses and a golf course finally was revoked on a town council meeting on 21 May 2010 by the nationalist mayor of the Bloc party Joan Caselles, and the developer &quot;El Grup Ballester&quot;.

The first mayor that was elected after the Franco&#x27;s regime was the socialist Antoni Caselles i Pérez, then the independent Francesc Mas i Sendra for two terms, the socialist Francesc Taverner i Taverner for two terms, and the socialist Rogelio Sendra i Taverner for one term, the conservative Aurelio Llinares i Mas for 1 term, Fernando Mengual i Taverner for 1 term however a vote of no confidence in the beginning of his second year gave the mayoralty to the Bloc Party represented by Joan Caselles i Mengual, in that order. En the elections of 2011 the Bloc party&#x27;s candidate Joan Caselles i Mengual took over the mayoralty for the next four years.

<doc id="1238377" wikidata="Q5301003" url="?curid=1238377" title="Doug White (politician)">
<text>Doug White of Manchester, Ohio, is an American politician of the Republican Party who was president of the Ohio Senate for two years, from 2003 to 2005.

An Adams County Commissioner from 1985-1990, White opted to run against the Democrat Harry Mallott in 1990 for a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives. He was successful in his run, and was seated in 1991. He won re-election in 1992 and 1994.

By 1996, Senator Cooper Snyder announced his retirement from the Ohio Senate after 17 years. Subsequently, White announced his candidacy for the seat. Ultimately Snyder resigned early, allowing the Senate Republicans to appoint White to the seat early, which they did.

After the 2002 elections, the Republicans of the Ohio Senate selected White to succeed Richard Finan as leader of the party. By 2004, however, White had already served two terms in the Senate and Ohio&#x27;s term limits law prevented him from running again. Thus, in the 2004 election, Tom Niehaus took White&#x27;s seat and Bill Harris was chosen to be the next Senate president.

After his service in the Senate, White was director of the Ohio Department of Commerce in the cabinet of Republican Bob Taft.

<text>Tom Niehaus is an American former politician who served as President of the Ohio Senate from 2011 to 2012. He also was the state senator for the 14th District from 2005 to 2012. He served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 2001 to 2004. He currently works as a principal with Vorys Advisors LLC, a wholly owned affiliate of the law firm, Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease. In this role, Niehaus provides business and strategic counsel to the law firm’s clients and other businesses and organizations. Niehaus works in the firm’s Cincinnati office and also maintains an office in Columbus.

==Career==
A graduate of Xavier University and Ohio State University, Niehaus spent ten years with Harte Hanks Communications, and 15 years (ten as an editor/publisher) with Community Press, a network of 27 community newspapers serving the Greater Cincinnati area.

With incumbent Representative Rose Vesper term limited and unable to run for another term, Niehaus sought to replace her. In the 2000 election, Niehaus defeated Melvin Dean and Scott Boone to win the Republican nomination with 46% of the vote. He won the general election against Democrat Ken Zuk by 10,000 votes. Niehaus was unopposed for reelection in 2002.

==Ohio Senate==
Midway through 2003, Niehaus and Jean Schmidt stated their intentions to run to succeed Senate President Doug White in 2004. Niehaus was supported by Senator White and former Representative Rose Vesper, while Schmidt received support from Speaker of the House Larry Householder. The primary proved to be one of the closest watched of the cycle. The campaign prompted complaints over fund-raising tactics and featured testy television spots centered on disputes over tax votes. The Ohio Taxpayers Association launched a $100,000 TV &quot;issue ad&quot; campaign that labeled Mr. Niehaus a tax-hiker.

Schmidt initially beat Niehaus by 62 votes. However, with a mandatory recount enacted and the counting of provisional ballots beginning, Niehaus began to close the gap, and by late March, Niehaus had taken the lead. Niehaus was certified the winner by 22 votes. Niehaus went on to defeat Democrat Paul Schwietering by 53,000 votes.

In his first term in the Senate, Niehaus served as Chairman of the Senate Environment &amp; Natural Resources Committee. In 2008, when Randy Gardner resigned from the Senate, Niehaus was chosen by Senate colleagues to take his place as Senate majority floor leader, and after Jeff Jacobson&#x27;s resignation, Niehaus again was elevated to Senate President pro tempore.

Niehaus won reelection in 2008 against Democrat Gregory Napolitano by 50,000 votes. He again was selected to serve as President pro tempore for the 128th General Assembly.

Niehaus served again as President of the Senate for the 129th General Assembly. On opening day of that assembly, Niehaus set a tone for bipartisanship, stating &quot;I want to assure the Senate that this will be a deliberative body where all voices will be heard.&quot; As President of the Senate, Niehaus also served as chairman of the Rules and Reference Committee.

<text>T. Mayer, or Tobias Mayer, is a lunar impact crater that is located at the western end of the Montes Carpatus mountain range along the southern edge of Mare Imbrium. It was named after German astronomer Tobias Mayer. Located to the west is the Oceanus Procellarum, and to the south is Mare Insularum. The crater is located a couple of hundred kilometers to the northwest of the prominent crater Copernicus.

The name T. Mayer was first given to this crater by Johann Hieronymus Schröter in 1802.

==Description==
This crater is embedded within a region of rugged ridges and these are attached to the exterior of the rim, most notably along the east and northeast. The rim is generally circular with the bowl-shaped T. Mayer A attached to the exterior along the east-southeast. Within the interior is a level floor marked only by a few craterlets. 

Due south of T. Mayer is a cluster of lunar domes, some of which have tiny craterlets at the summits. These domes are the result of volcanic activity.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to T. Mayer.

<doc id="1238391" wikidata="Q318258" url="?curid=1238391" title="Sancho VI of Navarre">
<text>Sancho Garcés VI (; 21 April 1132 – 27 June 1194), called the Wise (, ) was King of Navarre from 1150 until his death in 1194. He was the first monarch to officially drop the title of &quot;King of Pamplona&quot; in favour of King of Navarre, thus changing the designation of his kingdom. Sancho Garcés was responsible for bringing his kingdom into the political orbit of Europe. He was the eldest son of García Ramírez, &quot;the Restorer&quot; and Margaret of L&#x27;Aigle.

== Biography ==

Sancho VI inherited a debilitated kingdom, subject of frequent raids by the Kingdom of Castile of Alfonso VII and by the County of Barcelona of Ramon Berenguer IV, also king of Aragon, who in 1140 had agreed the partition of the kingdom in the Treaty of Carrión. 

He tried to repair the borders of his kingdom, which had been reduced by the Treaties of Tudején and Carrión, which he had been forced to sign with Castile and Aragón in his early reign. By the Accord of Soria, Castile was eventually confirmed in its possession of conquered territories. In the face of a possible Castilian military takeover of further western Navarrese territories, Sancho VI re-asserted royal authority by founding several towns in 1181, including San Sebastián, Vitoria and Treviño, among others.

He was hostile to Count Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona, but Raymond&#x27;s son King Alfonso II of Aragon divided the lands taken from Murcia with him by treaty of Sangüesa in 1168. In 1190, the two neighbours again signed a pact in Borja of mutual protection against Castilian expansion.

The was returned from Sancho III of Castile to Sancho the Wise in 1157.

He died on 27 June 1194, in Pamplona, where he is buried.

== Marriage and family ==

On 20 July 1153, Sancho Garcés married Sancha of Castile, daughter of Alfonso VII, King of León and Castile and his wife Berengaria of Barcelona. They had six children:

* Berengaria Sánchez, who became Queen consort of England after her marriage in 1191 to Richard I. She died childless.
* Sancho Sánchez, nicknamed &quot;the Strong&quot;, who succeeded his father and ruled as King of Navarre from 1194 to 1234, married first to Constance of Toulouse and then a second time to a woman believed to have been daughter of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor or, according to other sources, of Yusuf II, caliph of Morocco. 
* Blanche Sánchez, who became Countess of Champagne after her marriage to Theobald III and Count regent after his death. Her son Theobald would become King of Navarre after the death of his uncle.
* Fernando Sánchez, buried at the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas. 
* Teresa Sánchez
* Constanza Sánchez, buried in Marcilla.

<doc id="1238392" wikidata="Q270766" url="?curid=1238392" title="Teresa Stratas">
<text>Teresa Stratas (born May 26, 1938) is a Canadian operatic soprano and actress of Greek descent. She is especially well known for her award-winning recording of Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot;. She is formally retired.

==Early life and career==
Stratas was born Anastasia Stratakis to a struggling immigrant Cretan family in Oshawa, near Toronto, Ontario. At age 13, she performed Greek pop songs on the radio. She graduated from The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto where she studied singing with Irene Jessner. At age 20, Stratas made her professional opera debut as Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Toronto Opera Festival. One year later in 1959, she co-won the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, appearing later that year with the Metropolitan Opera as Poussette in &quot;Manon&quot;. She created the title role in Peggy Glanville-Hicks&#x27; &quot;Nausicaa&quot; at the Herod Atticus Theatre in Athens in 1961, made her Covent Garden debut as Mimì that same year and in 1962, she made her La Scala debut as Isabella in Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Atlántida&quot;. She continued her career with the Metropolitan Opera, moved into leading roles and performed with leading opera houses around the world, including the Bolshoi, Vienna State, Berlin, Bavarian State (Munich), Paris, San Francisco and at the Salzburg Festival.

Her repertoire also included Zerlina in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, Despina in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, Cherubino and Susanna in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, Liù in &quot;Turandot&quot;, Cio-Cio-San in &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, Micaëla in &quot;Carmen&quot;, Marguerite in &quot;Faust&quot;, the title role in &quot;La Périchole&quot;, Gretel in &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, Lisa in &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;, The Composer in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, Antonia in &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot;, Mélisande in &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, Marenka in &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;, Desdemona in &quot;Otello&quot;, Mme Lidoine in &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot;, the title roles of &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;Lulu&quot;, Jenny Smith in &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot; (directed by John Dexter) and Marie Antoinette in John Corigliano&#x27;s &quot;The Ghosts of Versailles&quot;. She is regarded as one of the foremost singing actresses of the twentieth century.

In March 1962, she appeared as a contestant on the CBS Game Show &quot;To Tell The Truth.&quot; Stratas and two other contestants had to convince the panelists that each of them was the real Teresa Stratas. Dorothy Kilgallen and Johnny Carson appeared on the episode as panelists along with Tom Poston and Dina Merrill. None of the panelists believed Stratas was really herself; giving all three contestants the top $1,000 prize to split among themselves and each received a carton of Salem cigarettes, the brand sponsoring the program.

==Career highlights==
Among her career highlights was the creation of the role of Sardulla in the US premiere of Menotti&#x27;s &quot;The Last Savage&quot; (Met, 1964). In 1974, she made a film (directed by Götz Friedrich) of Strauss&#x27; &quot;Salome&quot; with the Vienna Philharmonic under Karl Böhm. Pierre Boulez chose her to sing the title role in the first performance of Friedrich Cerha&#x27;s completed version of Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot; (Paris, 1979). In 1981 she performed the role of Mimi in &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. On 26 September 1989, she sang all three soprano roles in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Trittico&quot;, Giorgetta in &quot;Il tabarro&quot;, Angelica in &quot;Suor Angelica&quot; and Lauretta in &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot; (Met). She created the role of Marie Antoinette in the premiere of John Corigliano&#x27;s &quot;The Ghosts of Versailles&quot; (Met, 1991). At the opening night of the Met&#x27;s 1994 season, she sang Nedda in &quot;Pagliacci&quot; opposite Luciano Pavarotti and Giorgetta in &quot;Il tabarro&quot; opposite Plácido Domingo.

Over the course of her thirty-six year career at the Metropolitan Opera, she appeared in 385 performances of 41 different roles. Her most frequently performed roles at the house include Liu in &quot;Turandot&quot; (27 performances between 1961 and 1995), Nedda in &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (27 performances between 1963 and 1994) and Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot; (26 performances between 1962 and 1982). Her final performance with the company was on December 9, 1995, as Jenny in &quot;The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot;. She was engaged to sing Marenka in a revival of &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; during the 1996–97 season, but withdrew from the production prior to opening night, and subsequently never appeared at the Metropolitan again.

While rehearsing for &quot;Mahagonny&quot; in 1979, Stratas met the originator of her role, Lotte Lenya, who was also Kurt Weill&#x27;s widow. Lenya gave her the scores of previously unpublished Weill songs which she had hoarded until that time, some of which Stratas later recorded on two albums, &quot;The Unknown Kurt Weill&quot; and &quot;Stratas Sings Weill&quot;.

She also starred in several film adaptations of operas, including &quot;Salome&quot; (1974), &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot; (1978), &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; (1975), &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (1982) and &quot;La traviata&quot; (1983).

In 1988, she recorded the role of Julie La Verne in EMI&#x27;s 3-CD set of the complete score of Kern and Hammerstein&#x27;s classic musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;, conducted by John McGlinn. Also starring with her were Frederica Von Stade as Magnolia, Jerry Hadley as Gaylord Ravenal, and Bruce Hubbard as Joe. This was the first-ever complete recording of the score, using Robert Russell Bennett&#x27;s original 1927 orchestrations, Will Vodery&#x27;s vocal arrangements, and all of Oscar Hammerstein II&#x27;s uncensored lyrics. Critics acclaimed it as the finest recording of &quot;Show Boat&quot; ever made.

In the 1980s Stratas travelled to Calcutta and worked with Mother Teresa in an orphanage and at the Kalighat Home for the Dying. In the 1990s she again took time from her career to move into a Romanian hospital to clean cots and wash and care for the sick and dying orphans.

On September 25, 2008, Teresa Stratas returned to New York for an interview with the Metropolitan Opera Guild, her first public appearance in over a decade. She lives in Florida.

<text>Joy Padgett (born Joy Ann Conrad, February 4, 1947 in Coshocton, Ohio) is a former Republican member of the Ohio Senate, representing the 20th district until the end of 2008. In 2006, dogged by personal scandals, she ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of Ohio and for Congress in . Her run for Congress was the result of the decision of Bob Ney to bow out of the race and plead guilty to corruption charges.

==Political career==
Padgett was first appointed to the Ohio Senate in January 2004 and elected that following November. Prior to her election, she was the director of the Office of Appalachia in Governor Bob Taft&#x27;s administration. Before that, she served from 1993 to 1999 in the Ohio House of Representatives and, prior to that, had been a school teacher.

In her 2004 bid for her first full term in the Ohio Senate, Padgett was challenged by Democrat Terry Anderson of Athens, Ohio, who in the 1980s had been held hostage by Islamic radicals in Lebanon when working on a story for the Associated Press. Much of her campaign centered on social issues, namely that of same sex marriage. They stated that if Anderson were elected he would allow gays to get married. These ads were typically played with the theme song from &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; saying &quot;...men marrying men, women marrying women... What kind of world does Terry Anderson want?&quot; Many of these commercials were considered homophobic, and drew attention and condemnation. Other ads attempted to smear Terry Anderson as a terrorist sympathizer, often ignoring the truth about his imprisonment.

The match-up was the only seriously contested Ohio Senate race in 2004. Padgett won re-election with 54 percent of the vote.

==Loans, bankruptcies, and transfers==
Padgett and her then-husband Donald were owners of the Main Office Supply Co. Her husband ran the business for three decades; she was the company&#x27;s treasurer. The Coshocton business began experiencing financial troubles in 1999; it went from 40 employees to about eight when it closed in 2006.

In August 2004, the Small Business Administration gave the business a $737,000 loan guarantee on a loan from the JP Morgan Chase Bank. On the same day, the Padgetts renegotiated a three-year-old loan for $100,000 from the Home Loan Savings Bank in Coshocton. In October 2005, the Padgetts filed for bankruptcy for their business and defaulted on the two loans. The bankruptcy filing was subsequently tossed out by a federal judge when the Padgetts violated a court order.

On June 15, 2006, the Padgetts filed for personal bankruptcy, listing $1.16 million in debts against $202,143 in assets. Joy Padgett said most of the debt came from Main Office Supply Co. As of September 8, the Padgetts owed at least $20,000 on the local loan, and more than $720,000 on the federally guaranteed loan.

==2006 campaign==

=== Candidate for lieutenant governor ===
Early in 2005, Padgett joined Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro&#x27;s campaign for governor as a regional chair and worked on his behalf while he and lieutenant governor candidate Phil Heimlich campaigned. In January 2006, following Heimlich&#x27;s decision to leave the ticket in order to run for re-election as a Hamilton County Commissioner, Petro named Padgett his running mate as candidate for Lt. Governor.

The primary election was held on May 2, 2006. Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell and State Representative Tom Raga were victorious over the Petro/Padgett team.

===Republican candidate for Congress===
On August 7, 2006, Bob Ney announced he was withdrawing his candidacy in the 2006 election. Padgett announced that Ney and House Majority Leader John Boehner, who represents another district in Ohio, had asked her to run in his place.

On August 14, 2006, Ney officially withdrew from the race for Congress. Because that occurred before August 19 (80 or more days before the election), Ohio Revised Code 3513.312 applied, thus requiring &quot;the vacancy in the party nomination so created shall be filled by a special election.&quot; If Ney had waited until August 20, section 3513.31 of the Ohio Revised Code would have pertained and Ney&#x27;s replacement in the November general election could have been named by a district committee of the Ohio Republican party.

On August 10, Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro ruled that the &quot;sore loser&quot; provision in Ohio law (ORC 3513.04, which says that &quot;No person who seeks party nomination for an office or position at a primary election by declaration of candidacy or by declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate ... shall be permitted to become a candidate by nominating petition or by declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate at the following general election&quot;) did not apply to Padgett running for Ney&#x27;s seat because it was for a different office. Padgett was a losing candidate for lieutenant governor in the May 2006 primary (she was paired with Petro, who was running for governor.)

Some argued that Padgett was subject to another law—a provision put into the state&#x27;s budget bill in 2005 by Republicans. That provision (ORC section 3513.052(B)) prevents someone from running for office &quot;if that person, for the same election, has already filed a declaration of candidacy, a declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate, or a nominating petition, or has become a candidate through party nomination at a primary election or by the filling of a vacancy.&quot; Petro&#x27;s office was not asked for an opinion on that matter.

The Ohio Democratic Party initially indicated that it would contest Padgett&#x27;s eligibility by filing a lawsuit when she became a candidate. However, on August 18, the party said that it would not, because Padgett faced six opponents in the special primary and avoiding a lawsuit would save money for their fall campaign. But a brother to one of those six candidates filed a protest before the August 19 deadline.

The Tuscarawas County elections board heard the complaint on August 20 and voted 2–1 along party lines to reject it. One Democrat, Socrates Space, abstained from voting because of a conflict of interest; his son was the Democratic nominee in the same race.

Padgett originally faced seven Republican opponents in the special primary on September 14. But on August 22, Dover mayor Rick Homrighausen announced he would withdraw and endorsed Padgett. Ney aide John Bennett also withdrew, and candidate Gregory Zelenitz was rejected by the Tuscarawas County Board of Elections. Padgett overwhelmingly won the primary election with over 9,523 of the 14,065 votes cast.

She faced Zack Space, a Dover, Ohio lawyer and hotel developer, in the November general election. Space had won the Democratic primary with 39 percent of the vote. Space easily defeated Padgett on November 6, 2006, 129,687 to 79,286.

==Retirement from Ohio Senate==
In September 2007, Padgett announced that she would not run for another term in 2008. Soon after, State Rep. Jimmy Stewart, R-Albany, announced he would run for the 20th District Senate seat in 2008. Stewart won the seat, and Padgett retired from Ohio politics when her term expired in December 2008. United Conservatives of Ohio gave her a 77% evaluation.

<doc id="1238401" wikidata="Q842337" url="?curid=1238401" title="Parallel Lives">
<text>The Parallel Lives (, &quot;Bíoi Parállēloi&quot;; ) is a series of 48 biographies of famous men written in Greek by the Greco-Roman philosopher, historian, and Apollonian priest Plutarch, probably at the beginning of the second century. The lives are arranged in pairs to illuminate their common moral virtues or failings. The surviving &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; comprises 23 pairs of biographies, each pair consisting of one Greek and one Roman of similar destiny, such as Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, or Demosthenes and Cicero. It is a work of considerable importance, not only as a source of information about the individuals described, but also about the times in which they lived.

== Motivation ==
&quot;Parallel Lives&quot; was Plutarch&#x27;s second set of biographical works, following the Lives of the Roman Emperors from Augustus to Vitellius. Of these, only the Lives of Galba and Otho survive.

As he explains in the first paragraph of his &quot;Life of Alexander&quot;, Plutarch was not concerned with writing histories, but with exploring the influence of character, good or bad, on the lives and destinies of famous men. He wished to prove that the more distant past of Greece could show its men of action and achievement as well as the more recent past of Rome. Plutarch&#x27;s interest was primarily ethical (&quot;For it is not Histories that I am writing, but Lives.&quot;), although the work has significant historical value as well. The &quot;Lives&quot; was published by Plutarch late in his life after his return to Chaeronea and, if one may judge from the long lists of authorities given, it must have taken many years to compile.

== Contents ==

The chief manuscripts of the &quot;Lives&quot; date from the 10th and 11th centuries, and the first printed edition appeared in Rome in 1470. Thomas North&#x27;s 1579 English translation was an important source-material for Shakespeare. Jacob Tonson printed several editions of the &quot;Lives&quot; in English in the late 17th century, beginning with a five-volume set printed in 1688, with subsequent editions printed in 1693, 1702, 1716, and 1727. The most generally accepted text is that of the minor edition of Carl Sintenis in the &quot;Bibliotheca Teubneriana&quot; (five volumes, Leipzig 1852–1855; reissued without much change in 1873–1875). There are annotated editions by I. C. Held, E. H. G. Leopold, Otto Siefert and Friedrich Blass and Carl Sintenis, all in German; and by Holden, in English.

Two of the lives, those of Epaminondas and Scipio Africanus or Scipio Aemilianus, are lost, and many of the remaining lives are truncated, contain obvious lacunae and/or have been tampered with by later writers.

Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Alexander&quot; is one of the few surviving secondary or tertiary sources about Alexander the Great, and it includes anecdotes and descriptions of incidents that appear in no other source. Likewise, his portrait of Numa Pompilius, an early Roman king, contains unique information about the early Roman calendar. Plutarch has been praised for the liveliness and warmth of his portrayals, and his moral earnestness and enthusiasm, and the &quot;Lives&quot; have attracted a large circle of readers throughout the ages.

Together with Suetonius&#x27;s &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;, and Caesar&#x27;s own works &quot;de Bello Gallico&quot; and &quot;de Bello Civili&quot;, the &quot;Life of Caesar&quot; is the main account of Julius Caesar&#x27;s feats by ancient historians. Plutarch starts by telling of the audacity of Caesar and his refusal to dismiss Cinna&#x27;s daughter, Cornelia. Other important parts are those containing his military deeds, accounts of battles and Caesar&#x27;s capacity of inspiring the soldiers.

== Biographies ==
Plutarch structured his &quot;Lives&quot; by pairing lives of famous Greeks with those of famous Romans. After each pair of lives he generally writes out a comparison of the preceding biographies. The table below gives the list of the biographies. Its order follows the one found in the &quot;Lamprias Catalogue&quot;, the list of Plutarch&#x27;s works made by his hypothetical son Lamprias. The table also features links to several English translations of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; available online. In addition to these 48 &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, Plutarch wrote four unpaired biographies that are not considered to be parts of the &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, but can be included in the term &quot;Plutarch&#x27;s Lives&quot;. The subjects of these four biographies are Artaxerxes, Aratus, Galba, and Otho.

All dates are BC.
;Notes
The two-volume edition of Dryden&#x27;s translation contains the following biographies:
Volume 1.
Theseus, Romulus, Lycurgus, Numa,
Solon, Publicola, Themistocles, Camillus, Pericles, Fabius, Alcibiades, Coriolanus, Timoleon, Aemilius Paulus, Pelopidas, Marcellus, Aristides, Cato the Elder, Philopoemen, Flamininus, Pyrrhus, Marius, Lysander, Sulla, Cimon, Lucullus, Nicias, Crassus.
Volume 2.
Sertorius, Eumenes, Agesilaus, Pompey, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Phocion, Cato the Younger, Agis, Cleomenes, Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus, Demosthenes, Cicero, Demetrius, Mark Antony, Dion, Marcus Brutus, Aratus, Artaxerxes II, Galba, Otho.

# The Perseus project also contains a biography of Caesar Augustus, in North&#x27;s translation, but not from Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;: P
# Though the majority of the Parallel Lives were written with the Greek hero (or heroes) placed in the first position followed by the Roman hero, there are three sets of Lives where this order is reversed: &quot;Aemilius Paulus/Timoleon&quot;, &quot;Coriolanus/Alcibiades&quot; and &quot;Sertorius/Eumenes&quot;.
# At the time of composing this table there appears some confusion in the internal linking of the Perseus project webpages, responsible for this split in two references.

== Reception ==
Of the biographies in &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, that of Antonius has been cited by multiple scholars as one of the masterpieces of the series. In 1895, George Wyndham wrote that the first rank consists of the biographies of Themistocles, Alcibiades, Marius, Cato the Elder, Alexander, Demetrius, Antonius, and Pompey. Peter D&#x27;Epiro praised Plutarch&#x27;s depiction of Alcibiades as &quot;a masterpiece of characterization.&quot; Academic Philip A. Stadter singled out Pompey and Caesar as the greatest figures in the Roman biographies. In a review of the 1859 A. H. Clough translation, Plutarch&#x27;s depictions of Antony, Coriolanus, Alcibiades, and the Cato the Elder were praised as deeply drawn. The reviewer found the sayings of Themistocles to be &quot;snowy and splendid&quot;, those of Phocion to be &quot;curt and sharp&quot;, and those of Cato &quot;grave and shrewdly humorous&quot;. Carl Rollyson lauded the biography of Caesar as proof Plutarch is &quot;loaded with perception&quot; and stated that no biographer &quot;has surpassed him in summing up the essence of a life – perhaps because no modern biographer has believed so intensely as Plutarch did in &#x27;the soul of men&#x27;.

The English translation (1770) of John Langhorne and William Langhorne noted that Amiot, Abbe of Bellozane, published a French translation of the work during the reign of Henry II in the year 1558; and from that work it was translated into English, in the time of Elizabeth I. No other translation appeared until that of John Dryden.

<text>Lieutenant General Arundell David Leakey, (born 18 May 1952) is a former British Army officer. He was Director General of the European Union Military Staff in the Council of the European Union, Brussels. In 2010 he was appointed Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, a role he held until February 2018.

==Early life and family==

Leakey is the son of Major General Rea Leakey and nephew of Victoria Cross recipient Nigel Leakey. Leakey was educated at Sherborne School. He is also related to the Victoria Cross recipient Joshua Leakey.

==Military career==
After attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Leakey was commissioned into the Royal Tank Regiment as a second lieutenant (on probation) on 27 February 1971. His service number was 491002. From 4 September 1971 to 1 July 1974 he was a university cadet while he read law at Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge. His commission was confirmed on 1 July 1974 with seniority from 1 February 1971. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1974 with seniority from 1 February 1973, and to captain on 1 August 1977. He served in the UK, Northern Ireland, Germany, Bosnia and in Canada in armoured vehicles and in tanks (Chieftain and Challenger).

Having attended the Staff College, Camberley, Leakey was promoted to major on 30 September 1984. He was appointed Chief of Staff at 7th Armoured Brigade (Germany), Military Assistant to the Chief of the Defence Staff and then Commanding Officer of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment.

Leakey was promoted to colonel on 31 December 1993 with seniority from 30 June 1993. He was then posted to the Ministry of Defence as a Colonel Military Operations. In that role, he was responsible for Operational planning and policy affecting Eastern and Western Europe. In early 1995, he attended the Higher Command and Staff Course. In late 1995, he was the UK&#x27;s Military Representative at the peace negotiations to end the Bosnian War held in the United States. The successful negotiations resulted in the signing of the Dayton Agreement and an end to the three-and-a-half-year-long war.

Leakey was promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1995 with seniority from 30 June 1995. He was appointed Commander of 20th Armoured Brigade in Germany in 1996. With his brigade, he was posted to the former Yugoslavia from 21 December 1996 to 20 June 1997. He returned to the Ministry of Defence as Director of Military Operations from July 1997 to December 1999.

In 2000, Leakey attended the Royal College of Defence Studies. He was Chief of Staff at Headquarters Northern Ireland from February to December 2001. He was promoted to major general on 15 December 2001. From December 2001 to October 2004, he was Director General of Army Training and Recruiting. On 6 October 2004, he was appointed Commander of European Union Force Althea, the European Union peacekeeping force, which replaced the NATO-led SFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 28 February 2007. From 1 March 2007 until 2010, he was Director General of the European Union Military Staff in Brussels.

Leakey retired from the military on 22 September 2010.

==Later life==
Leakey was appointed as Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod in the House of Lords from February 2011 to December 2017. In early 2020 Leakey argued strongly against former Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow being appointed to the House of Lords, accusing him of bullying and explosive behaviour. Shadow Home Secretary and Member of Parliament Diane Abbott has defended Bercow, stating that as a military man, Leakey was &quot;unlikely to have been bullied by Bercow&quot;.

Since retiring as Black Rod, Leakey has undertaken public speaking engagements including media appearances on radio and TV. He mentors senior executives and holds appointments in a number of business enterprises: Chief Strategy Officer of Scopeworker (a business management software service), Advisory Member of 2M Holdings Board (Chemicals and Gas Industry), a number of consultancy roles, and ambassador for the Hollie Gazzard Trust.

==Personal life==
Leakey was chairman of the National Children&#x27;s Orchestra, but he resigned in June 2014. He has also been a member of the Parliament Choir.

He was appointed a Governor of Sherborne School and Sherborne School Group in 2018 and chairman in July 2020. He is also a trustee of numerous other Charitable and not for profit organisations.

He is an amateur piano player and singer. He is married with two sons. He enjoys classical music, playing squash, tennis, golf, most field sports, and chain sawing.

==Honours and awards==
Leakey was Colonel Commandant of the Royal Tank Regiment from 21 August 2006 to 30 July 2010 and previously Deputy Colonel Commandant since 16 July 1999. He was Honorary Colonel of the Dorset Yeomanry Squadron of the Royal Wessex Yeomanry until September 2024, and Dorset Army Cadet Force as well as Colonel of Cadet Force Music.

<text>The Z22 was the seventh computer model Konrad Zuse developed (the first six being the Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5 and Z11, respectively). One of the early commercial computers, the Z22&#x27;s design was finished about 1955. The major version jump from Z11 to Z22 was due to the use of vacuum tubes, as opposed to the electromechanical systems used in earlier models. The first machines built were shipped to Berlin and Aachen.

By the end of 1958 the ZMMD-group had built a working ALGOL 58 compiler for the Z22 computer. ZMMD was an abbreviation for Zürich (where Rutishauser worked), München (workplace of Bauer and Samelson), Mainz (location of the Z22 computer), Darmstadt (workplace of Bottenbruch).

In 1961, the Z22 was followed by a logically very similar transistorized version, the Z23. Already in 1954, Zuse had come to an agreement with Heinz Zemanek that his Zuse KG would finance the work of Rudolf Bodo, who helped Zemanek build the early European transistorized computer Mailüfterl, and that after that project Bodo should work for the Zuse KG—there he helped build the transistorized Z23. Furthermore, all circuit diagrams of the Z22 were supplied to Bodo and Zemanek.

The University of Applied Sciences, Karlsruhe still has an operational Z22 which is on permanent loan at the ZKM in Karlsruhe.

Altogether 55 Z22 computers were produced.

In the 1970s, clones of the Z22 using TTL were built by the company &quot;Thiemicke Computer&quot;.

== Technical data ==

The typical setup of a Z22 was:

* 14 words of 38-bit as fast access RAM implemented as core memory
* 8192 word (38-bit each) magnetic drum memory as RAM
* One teletype as console and main input/output device
* Additional punch tape devices as fast input/output devices
* 600 tubes working as flip-flops
* electrical cooling unit, needing a water tap connection (water cooling)
* 380 V 16 A three-phase power supply

The Z22 operated at 3 kHz operating frequency, which was synchronous with the speed of the drum storage. The input of data and programs was possible via punch-tape reader and console commands. The Z22 also had glow-lamps which showed the memory state and machine state as output.

== Programming ==

The Z22 was designed to be easier to program than previous first generation computers. It was programmed in machine code with 38-bit instruction words, consisting of five fields:

* 2 bits `10` to mark an instruction
* 18-bit instruction field, thereof:
** 5 bits condition symbols
** 13 bits operation symbols
* 5-bit fast storage (core) address
* 13-bit (drum) memory address

The 18-bit instruction field did not contain a single opcode, but each bit controlled one functional unit of the CPU. Instructions were constructed from these. For example, the bit &#x27;A&#x27; meaning to add the content of a memory location to the accumulator could be combined with `N` Nullstellen (zeroing) to turn the Add instruction into a Load. Many combinations are quite unusual by modern standards, like &#x27;LLRA 4&#x27; means &quot;multiply the accumulator by three&quot;.

There also was an assembly-like programming language called &quot;Freiburger Code&quot;. It was designed to make writing programs for solving mathematical problems easier than writing machine code, and reportedly did so.

<text>Jan Walter Susskind (1 May 1913 – 25 March 1980) was a Czech-born British conductor, teacher and pianist. He began his career in his native Prague and travelled to London in March 1939 when Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. He worked for substantial periods in Australia, Canada and the United States, as a conductor and teacher.

==Biography==
Süsskind was born in Prague. His father was a Viennese music critic and his Czech mother was a piano teacher. At the State Conservatorium he studied under the composer Josef Suk, the son-in-law of Dvořák. He later studied conducting under George Szell, and became Szell&#x27;s assistant at the German Opera, Prague, making his conducting debut there with &quot;La traviata&quot;; early in his career, he was often known as H. W. Süsskind (H for Hans or Hanuš).

Susskind was giving a piano recital in Amsterdam in March 1939 when Germany occupied Czechoslovakia, and his mother advised him not to return home. (She was later interned in Theresienstadt but survived the war). With the help of a British journalist and consular officials, he arrived in Britain as a refugee. He formed the Czech Trio, a chamber ensemble in which he was the pianist. Encouraged by Jan Masaryk, the Czech ambassador in London, the trio obtained many engagements.

In 1942 Susskind joined the Carl Rosa Opera Company as a conductor, working with singers such as Heddle Nash and Joan Hammond, and married (1943-1953) the British cellist Eleanor Catherine Warren. In 1944 he made his first recording for Walter Legge of EMI, conducting Liu&#x27;s arias from &quot;Turandot&quot; with Hammond.

After the war, Susskind became a naturalised British citizen, and though he spent much of his subsequent career outside Britain, he said he would never dream of giving up his British citizenship.

Susskind&#x27;s first appointment as musical director was to the Scottish Orchestra, where he served from 1946 to 1952. He and his wife divorced in 1953. From 1953 to 1955 he was the conductor of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (then known as the Victorian Symphony Orchestra). After free-lancing in Israel and South America he was appointed to head the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (TSO) from 1956 to 1965.

In 1960 he founded the National Youth Orchestra of Canada. In 1962 he gave the World premiere of the Four Epigrams for Symphony Orchestra by Rudi Martinus van Dijk with the CBC Symphony as part of the CBC&#x27;s National School Broadcast series Finding Out about Music. While with the TSO he taught conducting at The Royal Conservatory of Music where among his pupils were Milton Barnes and Rudy Toth. As he was leaving his post at the TSO, he was featured in a CFTO television special, &quot;Inside the Toronto Symphony&quot;, produced and directed by Peter Macfarlane. 

From 1968 to 1975 he was conductor of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra with which he made more than 200 recordings. During his seven-year tenure with St. Louis, he taught across the Mississippi River at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. He was also closely involved with the Mississippi River Festival, an annually recurring outdoors crossover concert series organised by the local university.

Susskind served as artistic advisor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra from 1978 until his death in 1980.

On May 3, 1971, Susskind returned to the New York City Opera to conduct Leoš Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Makropulos Case&quot;.

Susskind died in Berkeley, California, at the age of 66. His personal archives document his career as a conductor, piano accompanist and avant-garde composer. The BBC Radio 3 program &quot;Music Matters&quot; broadcast 29 Jan. 2022 an interview with Susskind&#x27;s widow Janis, in the process of transferring these materials to the Exilarte Centre, University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna.

<text>Lord Palmerston, of the Whigs, first formed a government by popular demand in 1855, after the resignation of the Aberdeen Coalition. Initially, the government was a continuation of the previous coalition administration but lost three Peelites (William Ewart Gladstone, Sir James Graham and Sidney Herbert) within a few weeks. However, other Peelites like The Duke of Argyll and The Viscount Canning remained in office. Palmerston was heavily criticised by Parliament in 1857 over the conduct of the Second Opium War and called a dissolution, but the nation voiced its support in the resulting general election and he returned with a Whig majority.

In 1858, the Government resigned when defeated (on a measure for removing conspiracies to murder abroad from the class of misdemeanour to that of felony, which was introduced in consequence of Felice Orsini&#x27;s attempt on the life of Napoleon III the emperor of the French) and was succeeded by another short-lived Conservative government under Disraeli and Lord Derby.

<doc id="1238433" wikidata="Q1132612" url="?curid=1238433" title="Anita Dobson">
<text>Anita, Lady May (born 29 April 1949), known as Anita Dobson, is an English actress and singer. She is best known for her role of Angie Watts in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; (1985–1988, 2025). In 1986, she reached number four in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Anyone Can Fall in Love&quot;, a song based on the theme music of &quot;EastEnders&quot;. She is married to Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Sir Brian May.

Dobson&#x27;s other television roles include the 1989 ITV sitcom &quot;Split Ends&quot;. In 2003, she was nominated for the Olivier Award for Best Actress for the National Theatre production of &quot;Frozen&quot;. She has also starred in the West End as Mama Morton in the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; (2003) and Gertrude in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (2005), making her RSC debut in the 2012 revival of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor.&quot; Dobson also appeared in the 2023 Christmas special of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, as well as playing a major role in the following 14th series of the show. Her film appearances include &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; (1999) and &quot;London Road&quot; (2015).

==Early life==
Dobson was born in Stepney, London. She trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London.

==Career==
Dobson appeared in several series in the early 1980s including the Jim Davidson sitcom &quot;Up the Elephant and Round the Castle&quot; (1983). She is best known for playing the emotionally battered and alcoholic landlady Angie Watts in BBC1 soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, a role she played from the show&#x27;s inception in 1985 until 1988.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===
Dobson was not the first person to be cast as Angie – another actress, Jean Fennell, had already begun recording when it was decided that her performance did not &quot;gel&quot; with the original idea of the character, and Dobson was substituted in the role. Whilst playing Angie Watts, alcoholic landlady of the Queen Vic, Dobson worked closely with actor Leslie Grantham, landlord of the Queen Victoria who played her adulterous husband &#x27;Dirty Den Watts&#x27;. On Boxing Day in 1986, 30.15 million viewers tuned in to witness Den handing Angie her divorce papers, giving the soap its highest ever episode rating, which has yet to be surpassed by any other soap in the UK.

After Dobson left &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1988, BBC executives made numerous offers for her to return, but she did not accept any of the offers; she later commented: &quot;Why tarnish the gorgeous creation that was Angie Watts?&quot; Executives finally decided she could not be persuaded to return, and in 2002 the character of Angie Watts died off-screen of alcohol poisoning and was brought home to be buried by her on-screen daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), who had returned to the show the previous year. Dobson eventually agreed to reprise her role for &quot;EastEnders&quot; 40th anniversary, making a surprise one-off appearance as Sharon&#x27;s hallucination in an episode broadcast on 19 February 2025.

===Other roles===
Since leaving &quot;EastEnders&quot; Dobson has appeared in many television, film and theatre roles, including the BBC sitcoms &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot; and her own sitcom series &quot;Split Ends&quot; (1989), which lasted for only one series. She has also made guest appearances in the BBC dramas &quot;Dangerfield&quot; (1995), &quot;Ghosts&quot; (1995), &quot;Sunburn&quot; (1999) and &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot; (2007), and the ITV detective series &quot;The Last Detective&quot; (2004) among others, along with the films &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot; (1998) and &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; (1999). She has also been reunited with fellow EastEnder Leslie Grantham in the Sky production called &quot;The Stretch&quot; and Five&#x27;s Horror series &quot;Urban Gothic&quot; (2000).

Dobson worked on the ITV1 police drama &quot;The Bill&quot; in 2005 and appeared in the radio &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Blood of the Daleks&quot;. Dobson has also played five different guest characters in the BBC1 medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot;, appearing in episodes in October 2000, July 2009, July 2011, March 2013 and October 2017; she also had two guest roles in &quot;Casualty&quot;″s sister series, &quot;Holby City&quot;, in September 2003 and December 2014 respectively. Dobson featured in the film &quot;London Road&quot; in 2015 and appeared alongside Simon Callow in the Gold comedy series &quot;The Rebel&quot; in 2016.

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2002 when she was surprised by Michael Aspel.

On 20 January 2023, it was announced that Dobson would be guest starring in the fourteenth series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as the mysterious Mrs Flood. Her casting was announced alongside that of Michelle Greenidge. The episode was broadcast on Christmas Day, 25 December 2023. On 27 April 2023, Dobson appeared in the series 8 episode of &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Ruin&quot;, as Frances.

===Musical and stage career===
Dobson has also performed as a singer, with varying degrees of chart success. In August 1986 she reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Anyone Can Fall in Love&quot;, a song based on the theme music of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, which was written by Simon May. The song was produced by Queen guitarist Brian May, who later became her husband. She has also released several other singles and albums with minor chart success.

On stage, Dobson has starred in repertory at Salisbury Playhouse in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; in 1980; the 1981 Ray Davies/Barrie Keeffe musical &quot;Chorus Girls&quot; and as Hazel Fletcher in the short-lived musical &quot;Budgie&quot; with Adam Faith. She also appeared in the revived Tom Stoppard musical &quot;Rough Crossing&quot; and played a holocaust survivor in &quot;My Lovely Shayna Maidel&quot;. She also appeared as Mama Morton in the West End musical &quot;Chicago&quot;.

Dobson played the role of Gertrude in the English Touring Theatre production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London&#x27;s West End, following a UK tour in the autumn of 2005.

In 2012, Dobson played the role of Mistress Quickly in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;.

From September 2016 to January 2017, Dobson appeared as Madame Morrible in the musical &quot;Wicked&quot; at the Apollo Victoria Theatre in London.

In May-June 2018, Dobson starred in Katy Brand&#x27;s new comedy-drama 3 Women at the Trafalgar Theatre, playing the role of Eleanor alongside Debbie Chazen and Maisie Richardson-Sellers. 

In June 2019, Dobson joined Trevor Nunn&#x27;s West End revival of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; at the Playhouse Theatre, playing the role of Yente, alongside Maria Friedman taking on the role of Golde, until the production&#x27;s closure on 2 November 2019.

===&quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;===
On 6 September 2011, it was announced that Dobson would take part in the 2011 series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. In the launch show of the ninth series on 10 September 2011, it was revealed that she would be partnered by Latin specialist Robin Windsor. She was eliminated on 27 November 2011 after Robin Windsor had been unable to dance for a week due to an injury. Anita Dobson therefore rehearsed and danced the Cha Cha Cha and the Swingathon with Brendan Cole.

*In Week 6 Jennifer Grey guest judged for Goodman.

===Awards===
For her time on &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Angie Watts, Dobson received the Pye Award for Outstanding Female Personality.

Dobson was nominated for a 2003 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;Frozen&quot; at the Royal National Theatre: Cottesloe.

In 2007, Dobson was made a Companion of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts.

==Personal life==
Dobson married Brian May on 18 November 2000. They had first met in 1986. She is a patron of The Match Girls&#x27; Memorial and of the theatre charity the Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America.

<text>The Fort Worth Classic was a postseason college football bowl game played only once, on January 1, 1921, at Panther Park in Fort Worth, Texas, between Centre Praying Colonels of Centre College and the TCU Horned Frogs of Texas Christian University.

Centre entered the game with a record of 7–2 with wins against Kentucky and VPI. Centre&#x27;s losses came against Harvard (8–0–1 on the year) and Georgia Tech (8–1 on the year). Centre had outscored its opponents 469–55 and won its first three games of the year by a combined score of 241–0.

TCU entered the game with a record of 9–0, including wins at Arkansas (19–2) and at Baylor (21–9). TCU had attained its perfect record while outscoring its opponents 163–46.

Centre won the game handily by a score of 63 to 7.

This game should not be confused with the modern Fort Worth Bowl, now called the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl.

<text>In solar physics and observation, granules are convection cells in the Sun&#x27;s photosphere. They are caused by currents of plasma in the Sun&#x27;s convective zone, directly below the photosphere. The grainy appearance of the photosphere is produced by the tops of these convective cells; this pattern is referred to as granulation.

The rising part of each granule is located in the center, where the plasma is hotter. The outer edges of the granules are darker due to cooler descending plasma. (The terms &quot;darker&quot; and &quot;cooler&quot; are strictly by comparison to the brighter, hotter plasma. According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, luminosity increases with the fourth power of temperature, causing even a small loss of heat to produce a large luminosity contrast.) In addition to the visible appearance, which can be explained by convective motion, Doppler shift measurements of the light from individual granules provides evidence for the convective nature of the granules.

A typical granule has a diameter on the order of and lasts 8 to 20 minutes before dissipating. At any one time, the Sun&#x27;s surface is covered by about 4 million granules. Below the photosphere is a layer of &quot;supergranules&quot; up to in diameter with lifespans of up to 24 hours.

<text>Joseph Szigeti (, ; 5 September 189219 February 1973) was a Hungarian violinist.

Born into a musical family, he spent his early childhood in a small town in Transylvania. He quickly proved himself to be a child prodigy on the violin, and moved to Budapest with his father to study with the renowned pedagogue Jenő Hubay. After completing his studies with Hubay in his early teens, Szigeti began his international concert career. His performances at that time were primarily limited to salon-style recitals and the more overtly virtuosic repertoire; however, after making the acquaintance of pianist Ferruccio Busoni, he began to develop a much more thoughtful and intellectual approach to music that eventually earned him the nickname &quot;The Scholarly Virtuoso&quot;.

Following a bout of tuberculosis that required a stay in a sanatorium in Switzerland, Szigeti settled in Geneva, where he became Professor of Violin at the local conservatory in 1917. It was in Geneva that he met his future wife, Wanda Ostrowska, and at roughly the same time he became friends with the composer Béla Bartók. Both relationships were to be lifelong.

From the 1920s until 1960, Szigeti performed regularly around the world and recorded extensively. He also distinguished himself as a strong advocate of new music, and was the dedicatee of many new works by contemporary composers. Among the more notable pieces written for him are Ernest Bloch&#x27;s Violin Concerto, Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody No. 1&quot;, and Eugène Ysaÿe&#x27;s Solo Sonata No. 1. After retiring from the concert stage in 1960, he worked at teaching and writing until his death in 1973, at the age of 80.

==Early life and education==

Szigeti was born Joseph &quot;Jóska&quot; Singer to a Jewish family in Budapest, Austria-Hungary. His mother died when he was three years old, and soon thereafter the boy was sent to live with his grandparents in the little Carpathian town of Máramaros-Sziget (hence the name &quot;Szigeti&quot;). He grew up surrounded by music, as the town band was composed almost entirely of his uncles. After a few informal lessons on the &quot;cimbalom&quot; from his aunt, he received his first lessons on the violin from his Uncle Bernat at the age of six.

Szigeti quickly showed a talent for the violin. Several years later, his father took him to Budapest to receive proper training at the conservatory. After a brief stint with an inadequate teacher, Szigeti auditioned at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music and was admitted directly into the class of Jenő Hubay, without the usual delays and formalities.

Hubay, who had been a student of Joseph Joachim in Berlin, had by that time established himself as one of the preeminent teachers in Europe and a fountainhead of the Hungarian violin tradition. Szigeti joined such violinists as Franz von Vecsey, Emil Telmányi, Jelly d&#x27;Arányi and Stefi Geyer in Hubay&#x27;s studio.
== Career ==

=== Child prodigy ===
In those days, Europe produced a great many child prodigies, inspired by the phenomenal success of the young Czech virtuoso Jan Kubelík and formed by rigorous teaching and enthusiastic parents. The Hubay studio was no exception; Szigeti and his fellow &quot;wunderkinder&quot; performed extensively in special recitals and salon concerts during their study at the Liszt Academy.

He went to study at the Conservatory in Budapest for 2 years before his debut.

In 1905, at the age of thirteen, Szigeti made his Berlin debut playing Bach&#x27;s &quot;Chaconne in D minor&quot;, Ernst&#x27;s Concerto in F-sharp minor, and Paganini&#x27;s &quot;Witches Dance&quot;. Despite the formidable program, the event received mention only by a photograph in the Sunday supplement of the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot; captioned: &quot;A Musical Prodigy: Josef Szigeti&quot;.

Szigeti spent the next few months with a summer theater company in a small Hungarian resort town, playing mini-recitals in between acts of folk operetta. In that same vein, the next year he played at a circus in Frankfurt, where he appeared under the pseudonym &quot;Jóska Szulagi&quot;. Also in 1906, Hubay took Szigeti to play for Joseph Joachim in Berlin. Joachim was impressed, and suggested that Szigeti should finish his studies with him. Szigeti declined the offer, both out of loyalty to Hubay and a perceived aloofness and lack of rapport between Joachim and his students.

===Broadening horizons===
Soon after the meeting with Joachim, Szigeti embarked on a major concert tour of England. Midway through the tour, in Surrey, he met a music-loving couple who effectively adopted him, extending an invitation to stay with them for an indefinite length of time.

Throughout England, he gave many successful concerts, including the premiere of the first work dedicated to him: Hamilton Harty&#x27;s Violin Concerto. Also during this time, Szigeti toured with an all-star ensemble including legendary singer Dame Nellie Melba and pianists Ferruccio Busoni and Wilhelm Backhaus. Philippe Gaubert, a famous French flutist of the day, as well as the young singer John McCormack, were also part of these tours.

The most significant of the new contacts was Busoni. The great pianist and composer became Szigeti&#x27;s mentor during these formative years, and the two would remain close friends until Busoni&#x27;s death in 1924. By Szigeti&#x27;s own admission, before meeting Busoni his life was characterized by a certain laziness and indifference brought on by the then-typical life of a young prodigy violinist. He had grown accustomed to playing crowd-pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much thought. He knew little of the works of the great masters; he could play them, but not fully understand them. As Szigeti put it, Busoni—particularly through their careful study of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Chaconne&quot;—&quot;shook me once and for all out of my adolescent complacency&quot;.

===Illness and new beginnings===
In 1913, Szigeti was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was sent to a sanatorium in Davos, Switzerland to recover, interrupting his concert career. During his stay at the sanatorium, he became re-acquainted with the composer Béla Bartók, who was recovering from pneumonia. His doctor recommended to practice the violin 25 to 30 minutes a day. The two had known each other only in passing during their conservatory days, but now they began a friendship that would last until Bartók&#x27;s death in 1945. Szigeti was allowed to visit Bartok for the last time in 1943 at Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan), New York with his illness worsening, reading Turkish poems while they spread out on his hospital bed.

In 1917, having by then made a full recovery, at age 25 Szigeti was appointed Professor of Violin at the Geneva Conservatory of Music. Szigeti said that this job, although generally satisfying, was often frustrating due to the mediocre quality of many of his students. The years teaching in Geneva provided an opportunity for Szigeti to deepen his understanding of music as an art, along with other aspects such as chamber music, orchestral performance, music theory and composition. Also during that time, Szigeti met and fell in love with Wanda Ostrowska, a young woman of Russian parentage who had been stranded in Geneva by the Russian Revolution of 1917. They married in 1919.

===American debut===
In 1925, Szigeti met Leopold Stokowski and played the Bach &quot;Chaconne in D minor&quot; for him. Less than two weeks later, Szigeti received a telegram from Stokowski&#x27;s manager in Philadelphia inviting him to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra later that year: it was his American debut. Szigeti had never played with an American orchestra before, nor heard one, and later he wrote of suffering stage fright. He was taken aback by the American concert scene, and the way that its publicity and popularity driven agents and managers determined much of what was heard in American concert halls. He believed they were not interested in works by the great masters, but preferred the popular light salon pieces he had left behind in his prodigy days. (To the end of his life, Szigeti loved to quote one memorable, cigar-chewing impresario who told him, with regard to Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Kreutzer Sonata&quot;, &quot;Well, let me tell you, Mister Dzigedy—and I know what &quot;I’m&quot; talking about—your Krewtzer Sonata bores the pants off my audiences!&quot;)

===International repute===
By 1930, Szigeti was established as a major international concert violinist. He performed extensively in Europe, the United States and Asia, and made the acquaintance of many of the era&#x27;s leading instrumentalists, conductors and composers.
In 1939, to escape the war and Nazi persecution of the Jews, Szigeti emigrated with his wife to the United States, where they settled in California. (A year later, Bartók also fled to America, and just two days after his arrival, he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.)

During the 1930s, 1940s and into the 1950s, Szigeti recorded extensively, leaving a significant legacy. Notable recordings include the above-mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital; the studio recording of Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Contrasts&quot; with Benny Goodman on clarinet and the composer at the piano; the violin concertos of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev (No. 1) and Bloch under the batons of such conductors as Bruno Walter, Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham; and various works by J.S. Bach, Busoni, Corelli, Handel and Mozart. One of his last recordings was of the &quot;Six Sonatas and Partitas&quot; for solo violin by Bach; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time, the recording is prized for Szigeti&#x27;s insight and depth of interpretation.

In 1944, Szigeti joinedJack Benny in a comic performance of Frantisek Drdla&#x27;s &quot;Souvenir&quot; in the film &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot;.

===Later years===

During the 1950s, Szigeti began to develop arthritis in his hands and his playing deteriorated. Despite his weakened technical mastery, his intellect and musical expression were still strong, and he continued to draw large audiences to his concerts. In Naples, Italy, in November 1956, just after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising, as soon as he walked onto the stage the audience burst into wild applause and shouts of &quot;Viva l’Ungheria!&quot; (Italian for &quot;Long live Hungary!&quot;), delaying the concert for nearly fifteen minutes.

In 1960 Szigeti officially retired from performing, and returned to Switzerland with his wife. There he devoted himself primarily to teaching, although he still traveled regularly to judge international violin competitions. Top-class students from all over Europe and the United States came to study under him. One of these students was Arnold Steinhardt, who spent the summer of 1962 with Szigeti. He came to the conclusion that &quot;Joseph Szigeti was a template for the musician I would like to become: inquisitive, innovative, sensitive, feeling, informed&quot;.

Toward the end of his life, Szigeti suffered from frail health. He was put on strict diets and had several stays in hospital, but his friends asserted that this did nothing to dampen his characteristic cheerfulness. He died in Lucerne, Switzerland on February 19, 1973, at the age of 80. &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a front-page obituary that ended with this 1966 quote from violinist Yehudi Menuhin:
We must be humbly grateful that the breed of cultured and chivalrous violin virtuosos, aristocrats as human beings and as musicians, has survived into our hostile age in the person of Joseph Szigeti.

==Personal life==
In 1918, while teaching in Geneva, Szigeti met and fell in love with Wanda Ostrowska. She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska&#x27;s family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska&#x27;s sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple&#x27;s hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if we can avoid it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don&#x27;t want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions. For once let&#x27;s twist and turn one for a good cause, yes?

Just before the birth of their only child, daughter Irene (1920-2005), Szigeti found himself stuck in Berlin during the Kapp Putsch of 1920, unable to return to Geneva. The entire city had been paralyzed by a general strike, and the trains were not running. His scheduled concert could not go on as planned, but he was forced to stay in Berlin for &quot;interminable days&quot; while the Putsch ran its course. Szigeti writes: &quot;... the impossibility of communicating by phone or wire with my wife--whose condition I pictured with the somewhat lurid pessimism usual to young prospective fathers--was certainly a greater torment to me than all the other discomforts put together&quot;.

By 1940, the outbreak of World War II forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States, while Irene remained in Switzerland, having married pianist Nikita Magaloff (1912-1992) earlier that year. They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted to be able to raise her own garden. In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn&#x27;t budge from our place, doesn&#x27;t want to come back to New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! Two dogs, an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right in our own little world.

Szigeti narrowly escaped being killed in the plane crash that claimed the life of movie star Carole Lombard in January 1942. Szigeti, who was on his way to Los Angeles for a concert, was forced to give up his seat on TWA Flight 3 at a refueling stop in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to allow the plane to take on 15 soldiers who, it being wartime, had priority. The plane, off course at night and with wartime blackout conditions in effect, crashed into a mountain cliff after takeoff from an intermediate stop in Las Vegas, killing everyone on board.

In 1950, Szigeti was detained at Ellis Island upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for five days under the Internal Security Act. He was released after an Immigration and Naturalization Service inquiry cleared him of unrevealed charges. At the time of his release from Ellis Island, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Szigeti had been a &quot;sponsor or patron&quot; of committees or organizations viewed as &quot;subversive&quot; by the U.S. government. Szigeti said after his release that he had never belonged to any political organization in his life, but that gave money or loaned his name to &quot;this cause or that&quot; during the war. The following year, he became a naturalized American citizen.In 1960, the couple returned to Europe and settled near Lake Geneva in Switzerland, close to the home of their daughter and son-in-law. They remained there for the rest of their lives. Wanda died in 1971, predeceasing her husband by two years.

Szigeti found his final resting place at the cemetery of Clarens next to his wife. Their daughter Irene and son-in-law Nikita Magaloff are buried just a few meters from their grave.

==Reception==

===Critics===

Writing in the &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Boris Schwarz commented:
Szigeti&#x27;s performing technique was not always flawless and his tone lacked sensuous beauty, although it acquired a spiritual quality in moments of inspiration ... Szigeti held the bow in an old-fashioned way, with the elbow close to the body, and produced much emphatic power, but not without extraneous sounds. Minor reservations, however, were swept aside by the force of his musical personality.
This comment illustrates well the general nature of Szigeti&#x27;s reception by both critics and fellow musicians: while his musical insights, intellect, and depth of interpretation were almost universally lauded, the purely technical aspect of his playing was awarded a more mixed reaction. His tone in particular seems to have been occasionally uneven from performance to performance. A 1926 recital review in &quot;The New York Times,&quot; for example, laments that ... his performance was stiff and dry in its observance of letter and its absence of spirit ... Mr. Szigeti was not only inclined to dryness of tone and angularity of phrase, but there were also passages of poor intonation. In contrast, a review from the previous year in the same journal remarked after a performance of the Beethoven concerto that Mr. Szigeti has a rather small but beautiful tone, elegance, finish. He played with a quiet sincerity which grew upon the audience, though not with the virility and sweep that other violinists find ... it is clear that Mr. Szigeti is a player to command esteem and respect for his musicianship, for the genuineness of his interpretations, and his artistic style.

===Musicians===
Among his fellow musicians, Szigeti was widely admired and respected. Violinist Nathan Milstein wrote that Szigeti... was an incredibly cultured musician. Actually his talent grew out of his culture ... I always admired him, and he was respected by musicians ... in his late years, he finally got the appreciation he deserved from the general public as well.
In his memoirs, published in 2004, cellist János Starker asserts that Szigeti was one of the giants among the violinists I had heard from childhood on, and my admiration for him is undiminished up to this day.

Starker then describes a recital he attended late in Szigeti&#x27;s career, illustrating both the extent to which Szigeti was suffering from arthritis and his ability to still communicate his musical ideas effectively: 
&quot;He invited me to his recital in Town Hall ... the first few minutes were excruciating: as I saw later, his fingers had deteriorated to the point that he had almost no flesh on them. But once he loosened up a bit he produced heart-rending beauty.

Violinist Yehudi Menuhin comments at length about Szigeti in his own memoirs, remarking as many others did on Szigeti&#x27;s intellectual approach to music, but in a somewhat more critical fashion:
Apart from Enesco, he was the most cultivated violinist I have ever known but while Enesco was a force of nature, Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was a beautifully fashioned piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn&#x27;t get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar persnicketiness marked his adjudication. Shortly before he died in 1973, he was a member of our jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... I was struck not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions. Some particular aspect of a competitor&#x27;s playing would hold his attention, and he would take violent issue with it, to the exclusion of everything else. For him a violinist was made or broken, a prize awarded or withheld, on details that to me scarcely mattered.

Nevertheless, Menuhin too referred to Szigeti as &quot;a violinist whom I much admired and a man of whom I was very fond&quot;.

==Legacy==

===The writer===
During his time in America, Szigeti took to writing; his memoirs, &quot;With Strings Attached: Reminiscences and Reflections&quot; were published in 1947. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed it favorably: although in their description the book was &quot;constructed along utterly anarchistic lines, with each episode and anecdote left pretty much on its own&quot;, they asserted that &quot;It also has the flavor of life in it, and it is marked by an exhilarating revolt against the custom of arranging catastrophes and triumphs under neat chapter headings&quot;.

In 1969, he published his treatise on violin playing, &quot;Szigeti on the Violin&quot;. In it Szigeti presents his opinions about the then-current state of violin playing and the various challenges and issues facing musicians in the modern world, as well as a detailed examination of violin technique as he understood it.

A recurring theme in the first part is the changing nature of violinist&#x27;s lives during Szigeti&#x27;s later years. In his youth, concert artists relied primarily on recitals to establish themselves and attract critical attention and acclaim; by the time of Szigeti&#x27;s writings, the recital had been eclipsed in importance by the competition. Szigeti was dismayed by this trend, especially since he considered the fast-paced and intense preparation necessary for high-level competitions to be &quot;…incompatible with the slow maturing either of the performing artist or of the repertoire.&quot;
Szigeti believed that such accelerated development of a musician led to performances that &quot;lack(ed) the stamp of authenticity, the mark of a personal view evolved through trial and error.&quot; In a similar vein, he was skeptical of the effects produced by the recording industry on the culture of music-making. In Szigeti&#x27;s opinion, the allure of the recording contract and the instant &quot;success&quot; that it implied led many young artists to record works before they were musically ready, and thus contributed to the problem of artificially fast development and resulting musical immaturity.

Szigeti also offers a lengthy and detailed explanation of his approach to violin technique. He believed that a violinist should be concerned primarily with musical goals, rather than simply choosing either the easiest or most impressively virtuosic way to play a certain passage. He was particularly concerned with tone color: he advised that &quot;The player should cultivate a seismograph-like sensitivity to brusque changes of tone colour caused by fingerings based on expediency and comfort rather than the composer’s manifest or probable intentions.&quot; Other topics prominently discussed include the most effective position of a violinist&#x27;s left hand, the violin works of Béla Bartók, a cautionary list of widely accepted misprints and editorial inaccuracies in the standard repertoire, and most notably, the vital importance of J.S. Bach&#x27;s Six Sonatas and Partitas for any violinist&#x27;s technical and artistic development.

===New music===
Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty.

The reason for Szigeti&#x27;s appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto&#x27;s premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music.

Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe&#x27;s Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe&#x27;s inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti&#x27;s performances of J.S. Bach&#x27;s Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.

Perhaps Szigeti&#x27;s most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement &quot;Contrasts&quot; for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók&#x27;s health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience. Szigeti came to his friend&#x27;s aid by securing donations from the American Society of Composers and Publishers to pay for Bartók&#x27;s medical treatment, and then, together with conductor and compatriot Fritz Reiner, persuaded Serge Koussevitzky to commission from Bartók what eventually became his much-beloved Concerto for Orchestra. The work&#x27;s success brought Bartók some measure of financial security and provided him with a much-needed emotional boost.

As well as performing new works dedicated to him, Szigeti also championed the music of other contemporary composers, notably Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky. He was among the first violinists to make Prokofiev&#x27;s First Violin Concerto a standard part of his repertoire, and frequently performed and recorded works of Stravinsky (including the Duo Concertante, recorded with the composer at the piano in 1945.) The Berg Violin Concerto he even recorded twice, under the baton of Dimitri Mitropoulos. Most famously, Szigeti recorded the Bloch concerto, a premier recording made in 1939 with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire conducted by Charles Munch (originally released on Columbia LP and reissued on Membran CD).

<text>Joachim Mrugowsky (15 August 1905 – 2 June 1948) was a Nazi bacteriologist who committed medical atrocities at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. He was Associate Professor, Medical Doctorate, Chief of Hygiene Institute of the Waffen-SS, Senior Hygienist at the Reich, SS-Physician, SS and Waffen-SS Colonel. He was found guilty of war crimes following the war in the Doctors&#x27; Trial and executed in 1948.

==Early life and education==
Mrugowsky was born to a family of Polish origin; his father was a medical doctor. In 1925, Mrugowsky began his studies of natural sciences and medicine at the University of Halle. He completed the studies in 1930–1931 with a medical doctorate and a doctorate of natural sciences. 1930–1931 he was the &quot;Hochschulgruppenführer&quot; (University group leader) of the National Socialist German Students&#x27; League branch at the University of Halle. After a two-year internship, he became an assistant at the Hygiene Institute of the University of Halle. Mrugowsky was made an associate professor in the area of hygiene at the University of Berlin in September 1944.

==Nazi activities and war crimes==
Since 1930, Mrugowsky had been involved in the Nazi ideology, first being the group leader of a local National Socialist German Students&#x27; Association then the NSDAP party member (No. 210,049). In 1931, he joined the SS, where he achieved the rank of &quot;Oberführer&quot; in both the General SS and the Waffen-SS. 

Mrugowsky coordinated human experimentation at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin. This included testing of typhus vaccines, and biological warfare agents including poisoned bullets and lethal injections.

==Trial and conviction==
He was implicated in the Nazi human experimentation program, with the exception of the aviation experiments, which were conducted on concentration camp prisoners. Mrugowsky was convicted of various charges in the Doctors&#x27; Trial and sentenced to death in August 1947. He was executed on 2 June 1948. Unrepentant to the end, Mrugowsky&#x27;s last words were, &quot;I die as a German officer sentenced by a brutal enemy and conscious I never committed the crimes charged against me.&quot;

<doc id="1238458" wikidata="Q203900" url="?curid=1238458" title="How to Irritate People">
<text>How to Irritate People is a 1968 British mockumentary sketch comedy television special recorded in the UK at LWT on 14 November 1968 and written by John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Marty Feldman and Tim Brooke-Taylor. Cleese, Chapman, and Brooke-Taylor also feature in it, along with future Monty Python collaborators Michael Palin and Connie Booth.

In various sketches, Cleese demonstrates exactly what the title suggests—how to irritate people, although this is done in a much more conventional way than the absurdity and surrealism of similar Monty Python sketches.

== Notable sketches ==

=== Pepperpots ===
The recurring characters of the &quot;Pepperpots,&quot; old British housewives who annoy theatre-goers and quiz show hosts in these sketches, would go on to be a major part of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, appearing in the majority of the show&#x27;s episodes.

=== Job Interview ===
The &quot;Job Interview&quot; sketch, featuring Cleese as an interviewer who asks several unusual questions of Brooke-Taylor, the interviewee, was later performed, almost unchanged, in the fifth episode of &quot;Flying Circus&quot;, with Chapman instead playing the interviewee.

===Freedom of Speech===
The &quot;Freedom of speech&quot; sketch, starring Cleese as the host/interviewer and Chapman as interviewee Dr.Rhomboid Goatcabin, features a discussion about freedom of speech in Great Britain, in which Cleese&#x27;s character repeatedly reformulates the subject&#x27;s main question (&quot;Do you believe there is freedom of speech in this country?&quot;) in so many ways as to start a monologue and not let Chapman&#x27;s character speak. This increasingly annoys the interviewee to the point where he is forced to murder the host to express his opinion on the matter, only to be interrupted again by his spirit. This sketch bears some resemblance to Anne Elk&#x27;s Theory on Brontosauruses and was originally performed on &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;, with Marty Feldman having played the interviewee.

===Indian Restaurant===
This sketch, featuring Palin as a waiter in an Indian restaurant who is excessively – and somewhat violently – apologetic to his customers whenever anything goes wrong, may very well have laid the groundwork for the &quot;Dirty Fork&quot; sketch from the third &quot;Flying Circus&quot; episode. In 1980, the Python team recorded an audio version for their &quot;Contractual Obligation Album&quot;. Although cut from the final album, it featured among the outtakes on their widely bootlegged &quot;Hastily Cobbled Together for a Fast Buck&quot; album.

=== Car Salesman ===
The &quot;Car Salesman&quot; sketch, in which Palin refuses to accept customer Chapman&#x27;s claim that a car he sold is faulty, later inspired Python&#x27;s &quot;Dead Parrot&quot; sketch, in which the malfunctioning car is replaced by an expired parrot.

=== Quiz Show ===
The &quot;Quiz Show&quot; sketch, where Brooke-Taylor, as a Pepperpot, annoys Cleese, a quiz show host, while appearing as a contestant on a show, was later adapted into another Monty Python sketch, &quot;Take Your Pick&quot; (or &quot;Spot the Brain Cell,&quot; as it would be later called) in the second &quot;Flying Circus&quot; series, where Terry Jones plays the contestant attempting to win the prize of a &quot;blow on the head.&quot;

=== Airline Pilots ===
The &quot;Airline Pilots&quot; sketch is set in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, with Cleese (as captain) and Chapman (as copilot). The airliner is on autopilot. Bored, they start making reassuring intercom messages to the passengers telling them there is nothing to worry about – at which point, of course, the passengers get worried – aided by the flight attendant (Palin). These messages get continually more incomprehensible or mutually contradictory until eventually, all the passengers bale out. The Monty Python sketch &quot;Bomb on Plane&quot; in episode 35 alluded briefly to this sketch when pilot Michael Palin told passengers, &quot;Our destination is Glasgow; there is no need to panic.&quot;

== Release ==
The television special was directed by Ian Fordyce who also directed &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;, and was made in the UK for the American market in an attempt to introduce them to the new style of British humor. For this reason, the recording is made to the NTSC color standard. The idea for the show came from David Frost.

The television special never aired in the UK but was broadcast in the United States on 21 January 1969 as part of &quot;David Frost Presents&quot; on KYW-TV. Contemporary reviews suggest a broadcast slot of 60 minutes, including commercials, which would make the version broadcast between 50 and 55 minutes, at least 10 minutes shorter than the current video release. In addition, reviews refer to David Frost as appearing in the show, whereas he is absent from the video version. An audio track confirms that he originally introduced the show. The 1990 UK video release was overseen by Michael Palin, who explained: &quot;I thought it had a few strengths and weaknesses, so we made a few cuts here and there and we put it out&quot;.

The show has since appeared on DVD.

<text>The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) is the combined military of Jamaica, consisting of an infantry Regiment and Reserve Corps, an Air Wing, a Coast Guard fleet and a supporting Engineering Unit. The JDF is based upon the British military model, with similar organisation, training, weapons and traditions. Once chosen, officer candidates are sent to one of several British or Canadian basic officer courses depending upon the arm of service. Enlisted soldiers are given basic training at JDF Training Depot Newcastle. As in the British model, NCOs are given several levels of professional training as they rise up the ranks. Additional military schools are available for speciality training in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

==History==
The JDF is directly descended from the West India Regiments formed during the period of British rule. The regiments were used extensively by the British to garrison the Colony of Jamaica and possessions in the West Indies. Other units in the JDF heritage tree include the early colonial Jamaica Militia, the Kingston Infantry Volunteers of WWI and reorganised into the Jamaican Infantry Volunteers in WWII. The West India Regiments were reformed in 1958 as part of the West Indies Federation. The dissolution of the Federation resulted in the establishment of the JDF.

The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) comprises an infantry Regiment and Reserve Corps, an Air Wing, a Coast Guard fleet and a supporting Engineering Unit. The infantry regiment contains the 1st, 2nd and 3rd (National Reserve) battalions. The JDF Air Wing is divided into three flight units, a training unit, a support unit and the JDF Air Wing (National Reserve). The Coast Guard element is divided between seagoing crews and support crews. It conducts maritime safety and maritime law enforcement as well as defence-related operations. The support battalion contains a Military Police platoon as well as vehicle, armourers and supply units. The 1st Engineer Regiment provides military engineering support to the JDF. The Headquarters JDF contains the JDF commander, command staff as well as intelligence, judge advocate office, administrative and procurement sections.

On 5 January 1978, the JDF carried out a covert operation that came to be known as the Green Bay Massacre, in which five Jamaica Labour Party (JLF) supporters were shot dead after being lured to a military shooting range. A specially selected team of snipers led by Major Ian Robinson laid an ambush outside the range while members of the JDF&#x27;s Military Intelligence Unit (MIU) drove a group of JLF supporters towards them in an army ambulance. After the supporters exited the ambulance, an MIU soldier killed one member while the sniper team opened fire on the rest. Four supporters were killed and the remainder fled into nearby bushes.

In recent years the JDF has been called upon to assist the nation&#x27;s police, the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF), in fighting drug smuggling and a rising crime rate which includes one of the highest murder rates in the world. JDF units actively conduct armed patrols with the JCF in high-crime areas and known gang neighbourhoods. There has been vocal controversy as well as support of this JDF role. In early 2005, an opposition leader, Edward Seaga, called for the merger of the JDF and JCF. This move did not garner support in either organisation nor among the majority of citizens.

==Major units of the Jamaica Defence Force==

*Headquarters, Jamaica Defence Force (HQ JDF) - divided into the Operations Branch and Adjutant Quartermaster&#x27;s Branch, this is the main command of the entire JDF.
*The Jamaica Regiment - The Jamaica Regiment is the operationalization of a terrestrial and combat focused Regular Force formation with an overarching operational headquarters in command of five battalions; the First, Second, Fourth and Fifth Battalions the Jamaica Regiment (1, 2, 4, 5 JR) and the Combat Support Battalion (Cbt Sp Bn).
*The Support Brigade (Sp Bde) - Regular Force formation that provides both combat support and service support functions with an overarching operational headquarters for five units:
**Support and Services Battalion
**1 Engineer Regiment (JDF) 
**Health Services Corps
**Corps of Military Police
*The Maritime, Air and Cyber Command (MACC) - The Maritime, Air and Cyber Command (MACC) is a multi-domain focused Regular Force formation with an operational headquarters in command of six units; the First and Second Districts Jamaica Defence Force Coast Guard (1st and 2nd Dist JDF CG), the Jamaica Defence Force Air Wing (JDF AW), the Military Intelligence Unit (MIU), the Special Activities Regiment (SPEAR), Counter Terrorism Operations Group (CTOG) and the Military Cyber Corps (MCC). 
*Caribbean Military Academy (CMA) - The Caribbean Military Academy (CMA) was established on 1 May 2019 to function as a Military University, becoming the first of its kind in the Caribbean.
*The Jamaica National Reserve (JNR) - The Jamaica National Reserve (JNR) is a multi-domain focused Reserve Force formation that has been expanded to include a headquarters element in command of four units; the Third, Sixth and Ninth Battalions the Jamaica Regiment (3, 6 and 9 JR (NR)) in addition to the Support Battalion (National Reserve) (Sp Bn (NR).

===Bands===
The JDF also supports two military bands:

*Jamaica Military Band - this is the band that is descended from the band of the West India Regiment, and was formed in February 1927. It is one of only two units in the world (the other being the Band of the Barbados Regiment) that wears the uniform of the zouaves.
*Jamaica Regiment Band - this band was originally formed as the Band of the West India Regiment formed in 1959 as the military force of the West Indies Federation. With the Federation&#x27;s break up and the independence of Jamaica, it became the Band of the 1st Battalion, Jamaica Regiment. It gained its current name with the formation of the 2nd Battalion in 1979.

Previous aircraft operated by the JDF Air Wing consisted of the Aero Commander 500 family, BN-2 Islander, Beechcraft Duke, Beechcraft King Air, Cessna Skymaster, Cessna 185 Skywagon, Cessna 210, DHC-6 Twin Otter, Eurocopter AS355 Écureuil 2, Bell UH-1 Iroquois, Bell 47G, Bell 212, Bell 204/205, and the Bell 222UT helicopter.

===Incidents===
On July 1, 2009, a Jamaica Defence Force Air Wing Bell 412EP helicopter was on its way back to Up Park Camp from a training mission when it began experiencing mechanical issues. The helicopter crashed into the ground at Up Park Camp, injuring the captain, his co-pilot and a crew member.

==JDF Coast Guard==
A year after the JDF was formed in 1962, a naval arm, the Jamaica Sea Squadron was added. The squadron&#x27;s initial vessels were three 63 ft wooden World War II torpedo recovery boats provided by the United States. They were commissioned “Her Majesty&#x27;s Jamaican Ship” HMJS &quot;Yoruba&quot; (P1), HMJS &quot;Coromante&quot; (P2) and HMJS &quot;Mandingo&quot; (P3). A training team from the Royal Navy assisted with the unit&#x27;s early development. In 1966 they changed names from the Jamaica Sea Squadron to the Jamaica Defence Force Coast Guard. JDF Coast Guard Headquarters &quot;HMJS Cagway&quot; located at Port Royal, Kingston. The coast Gurad had 4 additional stations: Discovery Bay, Black River, Pedro Cays, and Port Antonio. 

As of 2016, the Jamaica Defence Force Coast Guard was staffed by 241 individuals.

<doc id="1238465" wikidata="Q353623" url="?curid=1238465" title="Thomas Myhre">
<text>Thomas Harald Myhre (born 16 October 1973) is a Norwegian football manager and former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He is the manager of Moss. The last club he played for before his retirement was Kongsvinger, having returned to Norwegian football in July 2007. Myhre earned 56 caps for the Norwegian national team, and was a part of the Norwegian squad at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2000 European Championship tournaments.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Myhre was born in Sarpsborg, Østfold. He started his career with Moss F.K. in the Norwegian First Division, but arrived at Viking in the Premier League in 1993. The 19-year-old replaced Lars Gaute Bø, who retired at the end of the 1992 season, and immediately established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper, playing in every match that season. Myhre was also the number one goalkeeper for the Norway national under-21 team, for whom he reached 27 caps. After missing the entire 1996 season through injury, Myhre returned to form in 1997. He was noticed by English club Everton, who bought him for £800,000 in November 1997.

===Move abroad===
Myhre instantly established himself as Everton&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper at the expense of an aging Neville Southall. On 22 April 1998, he made his debut for the Norway national team, keeping a clean sheet in the 2–0 victory over Denmark in Copenhagen. Myhre was subsequently selected to represent Norway at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where he was an unused substitute for Frode Grodås.

Following an ankle injury, he was replaced by Paul Gerrard as Everton&#x27;s starting goalkeeper in the summer of 1999 and failed to reclaim his place. Acting as stand-in for Paul Gerrard in the FA-Cup tie against Aston Villa on 20 February 2000, Myhre was at fault for Villa&#x27;s opening goal. Everton were knocked out of the FA-Cup and Myhre&#x27;s days at the club were practically numbered.

===1997–2001: loans===
In the next two years he played for four different teams. He was first loaned out on an emergency basis to Rangers in Scotland in November 1999. In 2000, he was loaned from Everton to Birmingham City to ensure an additional fee would not be incurred for reaching a set number of appearances for Everton. He started well for Birmingham, saving a penalty kick from Keith Curle against Wolverhampton Wanderers on his debut. He played well for Birmingham, and returned to the national team in the spring of 2000, to play at the Euro 2000.

After Euro 2000, Everton loaned him out to Tranmere Rovers, as well as Danish club FC Copenhagen with whom he won the Danish superliga. In November 2001, Myhre permanently left Everton, as he was sold to Turkish club Beşiktaş for £375,000. After one season at Beşiktaş, he moved back to England to play for Sunderland in July 2002. At Sunderland, Myhre was second choice goalkeeper behind Thomas Sørensen, and was loaned out to Crystal Palace in October 2003. His stay at Sunderland was plagued by injuries, and he played only one of the Euro 2004 qualifiers for Norway. However, he returned as first-choice goalkeeper in Sunderland after the departure of Sørensen, playing 31 league games in the 2004–05 season, as the club won promotion to the Premier League. He also returned to the national team, playing 11 of the 12 qualifiers for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

However, Myhre&#x27;s contract with Sunderland ran out in June 2005, and he chose not to prolong it. On 21 July 2005, he moved back to Norway and joined Fredrikstad F.K. on a free transfer, where he played on a match-by-match basis. He played three matches for Fredrikstad, including an emotional encounter with his former club Viking, before English club Charlton Athletic signed him on a two-year deal on 8 August 2005 following an injury to their goalkeeper Dean Kiely. Initially second choice goalkeeper behind Stephan Andersen, Myhre established himself as Charlton&#x27;s starting goalkeeper in December 2005. Through the rest of the season, Myhre kept 10 clean sheets, and he played more than ten hours without conceding a home goal at The Valley. However, following the departure of manager Alan Curbishley, he once again found himself second choice goalkeeper at the start of the 2006–07 season, this time in favour of the loaned-in Scott Carson.

===Return to Viking===
In 2007, he moved back to former club Viking. He did not play as much as he would have wanted with a back injury keeping him out most of 2008. He started the 2009 pre-season well, and played most of the season for the Stavanger-team. His contract with Viking allegedly ended after a late night out in February 2010. Myhre later claimed that Viking was only looking to get rid of him, using it as an excuse. Later revelations are that he was drugged in Marbella.

===Kongsvinger===
On 5 March 2010, Myhre signed for Kongsvinger. On 11 March 2011, Myhre announced that he would retire from the game.

==International career==
Myhre was selected to represent Norway at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where he was an unused substitute for Frode Grodås.

At the 2000 European Championship (Euro 2000) in June, he played all three games for Norway. Myhre kept clean sheets against Spain and Slovenia, and conceded only one goal in the tournament – Savo Milošević&#x27;s winner in the match against Yugoslavia.

In a Euro 2008 qualifier against Turkey on 28 March 2007, Norway were leading 2–0 at half time. In the second half, Myhre could not hold a free kick from Hamit Altıntop, and fumbled the ball into his own net. Minutes before full-time, another Altıntop shot went straight through Myhre&#x27;s legs, and the game ended 2–2. Although his Norwegian teammates were consoling him, Myhre proclaimed the match his &quot;worst day on the field&quot;. The game against Turkey was Myhre&#x27;s last game for Norway.

==Managerial career==

In December 2020, he was appointed as sports director for his boyhood club, Moss. In September 2021, Myhre was appointed manager of Moss. In the 2022 season, Myhre led Moss to promotion and was awarded Manager of the Year.

<text>Kelly Carl Petillo (born Cavino Michelle Petillo, December 5, 1903 or December 16, 1903 – June 30, 1970) was an American racing driver.

== Early life ==

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1903, Petillo moved with his family to Huntington Park, California in 1921. He began racing at Los Angeles&#x27; Legion Ascot Speedway in 1929.

== Driving career ==

Petillo competed in the Indianapolis 500 on ten occasions, winning the race in 1935 in a year that marked the first win by a car powered by an Offenhauser engine. He went on to win the 1935 AAA-sanctioned National Driving Championship. In 1937, he participated in the Vanderbilt Cup but engine problems forced him out of the race.

In 1942, Petillo sustained a concussion and lacerations after a road accident when his car collided with a freight train. He was denied entry to the 1946 Indianapolis 500, and sued the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for $50,000.

== Legal issues and enforced retirement ==

Off the track, Petillo had numerous run-ins with the law, including charges of attempted rape and attempted murder. In 1948, police arrested him in victory lane after winning a race at Owosso Speedway, on charges of assault to commit murder seven days earlier. This was assault and battery. He was sentenced to ten years in the Indiana State Prison. He was released on parole in 1955, but went missing. He was re-captured in 1957, incidentally, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He was returned to prison until 1959, after which he was denied entry to the Indianapolis 500 in 1959 and 1960, officially due to age. After his exclusion in 1959, he again filed a lawsuit for $50,000 against the speedway and the United States Auto Club.

Petillo had a small role in the 1939 motion picture &quot;Burn &#x27;Em Up O&#x27;Connor&quot;.

== Death ==

<text>Julio Andrés Arca (born 31 January 1981) is an Argentine former professional footballer, who played as a left-back or central midfielder. He was most recently manager of South Shields.

Arca spent the majority of his career in the North East of England, firstly for Sunderland from 2000 to 2006, and then for Middlesbrough from 2006 to 2013. He retired from professional football following his release from Middlesbrough, and subsequently played Sunday League football for Willow Pond for the 2014–15 season. He later signed for South Shields, in addition to his return to Sunderland as part of the club&#x27;s youth coaching staff.

During his professional career, he was seen as an attack-minded player, with his key attributes including good long and short passing, as well as being a hard worker. Throughout his career at Sunderland and Middlesbrough, Arca has gained a cult following among supporters at Sunderland, Middlesbrough and South Shields.

==Club career==
===Argentinos Juniors===
Born in Quilmes, Argentina, Arca began playing football when he was eleven and joined Argentinos Juniors when he was fourteen. He went on to progress at the Argentinos Juniors’ academy and made his debut three years later at age seventeen; which saw his side lose 7–1 loss against Independiente. Arca made thirty–six appearances during his time there, having broken into the first team at age eighteen. He said playing in Argentina was tough, but acknowledged that it gave him a “great education”.

===Sunderland===
Sunderland&#x27;s manager Peter Reid signed Arca in 2000 from Argentinos Juniors with a £3.5 million five-year deal, while holding off competition from Newcastle United and Leeds United. It came after Peter Reid spotted him in a U21 match playing against England at Craven Cottage and tracked him until completing the signing in July 2000. Upon joining the club, Arca was Reid&#x27;s most expensive signing of that summer and was then second only behind Stefan Schwarz as the club&#x27;s record buy. The youngster was tipped for the brightest of futures and full international honours.

Having missed the first three league matches, due to receiving his Italian passport, he was an immediate success, scoring on his debut at the Stadium of Light against West Ham United. Arca then helped the side keep four consecutive clean sheets throughout October. The following month, he only played three matches, including scoring against Manchester United, due to his international commitment with Argentina U20. Arca&#x27;s third goal of the season came on 1 January 2001, in a 4–1 win over Ipswich Town. However, he missed five matches throughout January because of his continuous international commitment with Argentina U20. It wasn&#x27;t until on 10 February 2001 when Arca made his return to the first team, in a 1–1 draw against Liverpool. Arca played for his previous club and national team at left-back but was successfully converted to left midfield by Reid. Arca scored three times in thirty appearances for the Black Cats in his first season in the Premiership. For his performance, he won the club&#x27;s Young Player of the Year award. Arca also became a fan favourite among Sunderland supporters.

At the start of the 2001–02 season, Arca suffered a setback when he suffered a knee injury that saw him miss two matches. He made his return from injury, starting the whole game, in a 1–0 win over Blackburn Rovers on 8 September 2001. Following this, he regained his first-team place, playing in the midfield position. In a 1–1 draw against Arsenal, Arca scored a header from two minutes into injury time but was denied by referee Mike Riley after the assistant referee flagged for offside. Riley&#x27;s decision to disallow Arca&#x27;s goal was criticised by then-club captain Michael Gray and Manager Peter Reid. Despite that setback, Arca managed to score his first goal of the season in a 2–1 win over Leeds United on 18 November 2001. He did not manage to rediscover his form of the previous season and was out of action from February. Because of his trouble with a series of niggling injuries, Arca&#x27;s 2001–02 campaign was disappointing like so many other of Sunderland&#x27;s players.

At the start of the 2002–03 campaign, Arca continued to recover from the injuries he sustained from the previous season. His first appearance of the season came on 28 August 2002, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1–0 win over Leeds United. Arca, who had then played 54 games for the club, stated his determination to get back to his best – both in fitness and form, especially playing under the management of Reid&#x27;s successor, Howard Wilkinson. Due to being a fan favourite among Sunderland supporters, they chanted &quot;Julio, Julio when he was not in the squad&quot;. Despite this, Arca scored his first goal of the season, in the second round of the League Cup, in a 2–0 win over Cambridge United on 1 October 2002. He was sidelined for two months, due to an injury he sustained during the club&#x27;s reserve match against Manchester United Reserve. After returning from injury in December, Arca didn&#x27;t make his return to the first team until 11 January 2003, coming on as a second–half substitute, in a 0–0 draw against Blackburn Rovers. Three days later on 14 January 2003, he scored his second goal of the season, in a 2–0 win over Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup replay. Since returning to the first team, Arca had a run in of first team for the rest of the season despite being on the sidelines on three occasions. At the end of the 2002–03 season, the club was relegated to the Championship, finishing at the bottom of the Premier League, and he went on to make eighteen appearances and scoring twice in all competitions.

At the start of the 2003–04 season, Arca missed the first three matches, due to being linked to a move away and leaving Sunderland. His first appearance of the season came on 23 August 2003 against Preston North End, starting the whole game in the left–back position, in a 2–0 win. Having regained his first team place, playing in the left–back position, he kept two clean sheets in the next two matches, including scoring his first goal of the season, in a 4–0 win over Bradford City. Since returning to the first team, Arca regained his first-team place, playing in the left–back position. Manager Mick McCarthy and Gary Breen praised his recent performances for making a significant impact. His second goal of the season came on 27 September 2003, in a 2–0 win over Reading. A week later on 4 October 2003, however, he was sent–off for the second bookable offence, in a 1–0 win over Sheffield United. Arca was sent–off for a second bookable offence once again two months later on 2 December 2003, in a 1–1 draw against Wigan Athletic, resulting in a two-match ban. After returning to the first team, he scored three goals throughout January. In the January transfer window Arca was linked a move away from Sunderland, prompting Manager McCarthy to rule out the sale. Arca himself showed his loyalty to the club, electing to stay Following this, he then scored his fourth goal of the season, in a 3–1 win over Walsall on 3 March 2004. However, Arca missed five matches, due to a knee injury he sustained in a 1–0 win over Sheffield United in a FA Cup match. It wasn&#x27;t until 27 March 2004 that he made his return to the starting line-up, in a 2–1 win over Derby County. Having regained his first team place for the next five matches, he suffered a knee injury that saw him sidelined for the rest of the 2003–04 season. At the end of the 2003–04 season, Arca went on to make thirty–seven appearances and scored six times in all competitions. For his performance, he was named PFA Team of the Year for the First Division for the 2003–04 season.

Ahead of the 2004–05 season, Arca was linked a move away from Sunderland, as Manager McCarthy predicted that he would leave the club should they failed to achieve promotion back to the Premier League. Despite this, Arca declared that he was happy to stay at Sunderland, and opened talks with the club over a new contract. At the start of the 2004–05 season, he continued as a first team regular, still playing in midfield. It wasn&#x27;t until on 14 September 2004 when Arca scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest. However, he missed two matches, due to a sustained leg injury. After returning to the first team from injury, Arca then scored his second goal of the season, in a 3–1 win over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 30 October 2004; followed–up by providing a hat–trick assists, in a 3–1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. During a 2–0 defeat against Millwall on 5 November 2004, Arca made V-signs to Millwall supporters on three occasions after being involved in a tussle with Kevin Muscat; leading the Football Association reported the allegations to the police. It was announced on 12 November 2004 that he signed a three–year contract, keeping him until 2007. By the end of 2004, he added two more goals, which were against Burnley and Leeds United. After being sidelined with another injury at the beginning of January, Arca didn&#x27;t score again until on 19 February 2005, in a 2–1 loss against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. In a follow–up match against Rotherham United, he suffered an injury and was substituted in the 33rd minute, resulting in him missing two matches. It wasn&#x27;t until on 12 March 2005 when he made his return as a substitute against Crewe Alexandra and set up the only goal in the game, in a 1–0 win. In a follow–up match, Arca scored his sixth goal of the season, in a 5–1 win over Plymouth Argyle. He later scored three more goals, including two victories over Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United. Throughout the season, Arca was arguably their best player as they returned to the Premiership under manager Mick McCarthy, winning the Football League Championship in 2004–05. At the end of the 2004–05 season, he went on to make forty–two appearances and scoring nine times in all competitions. For his performance, Arca, once again, was named in the PFA Team of the Year for the Championship team in the 2004–05 season.

At the start of the 2005–06 season, with Sunderland back in the Premier League, Arca continued to remain as first team regular, playing in the left–back position. However, the club made a poor start to the season, losing the first five league matches. He then scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–0 win over Middlesbrough, giving Sunderland their first Premier League since 2002. However, Arca suffered a toe injury during training and missed two matches. It wasn&#x27;t until on 23 October 2005 when he returned to the first team, coming on as a second–half substitute, in a 3–2 loss against rivals, Newcastle United. His return was short–lived when he once again injured his toe after the match and was sidelined for a month. It wasn&#x27;t until on 10 December 2005 when Arca returned to the starting line-up, playing the whole game, in a 2–0 loss against Charlton Athletic. Since returning to the first team, he quickly regained his place in the starting eleven, playing either the left–back position or midfield position over the season. In the January transfer window, Arca was linked a move away from the club, which he responded by stating that he has no intention of leaving Sunderland. Amid to the transfer move, Arca then scored his second goal of the season, in a 2–1 loss against Brentford in the fourth round of the FA Cup. During a 4–1 loss against rivals Newcastle United on 17 April 2006, he collided with Alan Shearer, resulting in him tearing his knee injury. However, he suffered injuries on three occasions later in the 2005–06 season. Sunderland were relegated again in the 2005–06 season. At the end of the season, Arca went on to make twenty–six appearances and scoring two times in all competitions.

Arca&#x27;s departure from Sunderland was announced in April 2006. He stated that he would not play in the Championship again should the club be relegated. By the time he departed Sunderland, he made 177 appearances and scored 23 times for the side in all competitions. Five years later, Arca was named Solid Gold XI on the club&#x27;s website.

===Middlesbrough===
On 26 July 2006, following Sunderland&#x27;s relegation from Premier League, it was announced that Arca had signed a five-year contract with Premier League side Middlesbrough, for a reported transfer fee of £1.75 million, becoming new manager Gareth Southgate&#x27;s first ever senior signing; they beat Spanish club Espanyol to signing the player. He was a replacement for Franck Queudrue, who moved to Fulham.

Arca made his Premier League debut for Middlesbrough against Reading on the opening day of the 2006–07 season; he broke his foot and was substituted at half-time for Andrew Davies. After regaining fitness, Arca made his return to the first team, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1–0 win over Everton on 14 October 2006. With the progress of Andrew Taylor at left-back, Arca had been utilised as central midfielder. He scored his first goal for the club against Charlton Athletic on 23 December 2006. Arca then scored against Charlton Athletic for the second time this season, in a 3–1 win. His third goal of the season came on 17 February 2007, in a 2–2 draw against West Bromwich Albion in the fifth round of the FA Cup; leading to a FA Cup, which they won on penalties and Arca was one of the players successfully convert. He set up an equaliser goal for Lee Cattermole, in a 2–2 draw against Manchester United in the sixth round of the FA Cup; leading to a FA Cup replay once again, which Middlesbrough lost 1–0. However, Arca suffered a groin injury that saw him sidelined for a month. It wasn&#x27;t until on 28 April 2007 when he returned from injury, coming on as a substitute during the second half, in a 3–2 loss against Tottenham Hotspur. Arca later featured the remaining two matches of the season. At the end of the 2006–07 season, he went on to make twenty–eight appearances and scoring three times in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Arca was subjected of a transfer bid from his former club, Sunderland when they made a £2 million bid but Middlesbrough turned down the offer. Amid the transfer speculation, Arca continued to remain his first team place, playing in the midfield position at the start of the season. He then set up the opening goal for Mido, in a 2–1 win over Fulham on 18 August 2007. Arca scored his first goal for the club in a follow–up match against Tyne–Tees rivals, Newcastle United. A month later on 22 September 2007, he scored his second goal of the season, in a 2–2 draw against Sunderland. During the match, he is still liked strongly by most Sunderland fans despite moving to their local rivals and in the 2007 Tees–Wear derby at the Riverside, when he went off injured after scoring against them, he was cheered by the visiting Sunderland supporters. Unfortunately, following this injury that saw him out for two months, Arca struggled to regain his excellent form in the months prior to it. It wasn&#x27;t until on 9 December 2007 when he made his return from injury, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2–1 win over Arsenal. Arca continued to regain his first team place since returning from injury. In January 2008, Arca was named club captain, replacing George Boateng. His first game as captain was against Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League in a 1–1 draw. After only a few games leading the team, he was replaced by Emanuel Pogatetz. By March, Arca was dropped from the first team by Manager Gareth Southgate, which he said: &quot;I felt with Julio he just needs that break from the team. He&#x27;s a fantastic player, he&#x27;s very much with us and he understands why I left him out&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t until on 6 April 2008 when he returned to the first team, starting the whole game, in a 2–2 draw against Manchester United. Since returning from injury, Arca continued to regained his first team for remaining matches of the 2007–08 season. He also assisted two matches in the last three remaining matches of the season, against Sunderland and Manchester City. At the end of the 2007–08 season, Arca went on to make twenty–nine appearances and scoring two times in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2008–09 season, Arca switched number shirt from thirty–three to three. However, he suffered ankle injury during a 3–2 win over Hibernian in a friendly match and was sidelined for two months as a result. It wasn&#x27;t until on 29 October 2008 when he made his return to the first team from injury, coming on as a substitute in the 75th minute, in a 2–0 win over Manchester City. Since returning to the first team, Arca regained back his first team place, playing in the midfield position over the months. But in mid–January, Arca lost his first team place when suffered an illness that saw him miss one match, followed up by being placed on the substitute bench, as he continued to regain his fitness. Arca made his return to the starting line-up, playing the whole game, in a 1–1 draw against West Ham United in the fifth round of the FA Cup; which Middlesbrough went through in the FA Cup replay by beating them 2–0. Towards the end of the 2008–09 season, he suffered a hamstring injury that saw him out for a month. It wasn&#x27;t until on 16 May 2009 when Arca made his return to the starting line-up, in a 1–1 draw against Aston Villa. The last game of the season against West Ham United, however, saw them lose 2–1, resulting in their relegation to the Championship in eleven years. At the end of the 2008–09 season, he went on to make twenty–one appearances in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Arca said that he would leave Middlesbrough if he wasn&#x27;t getting first team football at the club. But Arca suffered an injury at the start of the season that saw his playing time restricted. He soon regained his first team place, playing in the midfield position since regaining fitness. Arca then set up the opening goal in the game for Leroy Lita, in a 1–1 draw against Nottingham Forest on 21 November 2009; which was followed up by setting a goal for Dave Kitson, who scored twice in the game, in a 2–2 draw against Peterborough United. He found himself in a competition with Adam Johnson, which saw Arca placed on the substitute bench and this lasted until Johnson&#x27;s departure to Manchester City in January. However, Arca, himself, was plagued with injuries that saw him miss four matches at the beginning of 2010. It wasn&#x27;t until on 16 February 2010 when he made his return to the first team from injury, coming on as a second–half substitute, in a 2–0 loss against Blackpool. After missing one match, Arca made a return to the first team against Watford, where he set up an equalising goal for Lita, in a 1–1 draw. At the end of the 2009–10 season, which saw Arca make thirty–six appearances in all competitions, the club failed to gain promotion from the Championship.

Ahead of the 2010–11 season, it was announced that Arca would stay at the club, having joined the club&#x27;s pre–season tour. Arca started the season well when he set up the opening goal for Scott McDonald, in a 3–1 loss against Ipswich Town in the opening game of the season. Arca then scored in Middlesbrough&#x27;s 2–1 win over Chesterfield in the League Cup and scoring his first league goal for over three years from a penalty kick, to give Middlesbrough a 1–0 victory over Cardiff City. This proved to be a turning point for him, as he regained fine form towards the end of 2010. Arca suffered two injuries throughout October. Over time through the season, Arca played in both the left–back position and midfield position. Arca then assisted three goals in three matches between 28 December 2010 and 3 January 2011 against Preston North End, Leeds United and Norwich City. It wasn&#x27;t until on 23 April 2011 when he scored his second of the season against Hull City and later that week, he scored his third of the campaign on a 2–1 win over Coventry City. Despite being absent on three occasions later in the season, Arca made thirty–five appearances and scoring four times in all competitions. At the end of the 2010–11 season, he was voted the club&#x27;s supporters&#x27; and players&#x27; Player of the Year. Arca was also named Middlesbrough&#x27;s player of the year and Team of the Season by the local newspaper, The Northern Echo.

His contract ended at the end of the 2010–11 season, having announced in February that he would leave. Arca previously stated that he would take a pay cut to stay at Middlesbrough. But mid–June, he was offered a new contract on reduced terms. On 1 July 2011, Arca was officially a free agent, though Manager Tony Mowbray did not ruled out a return to sign him. After turning down a chance to return to Boca Juniors, Arca re-signed with a two-year contract on 12 August 2011, having previously been released at the beginning of that same transfer window

Two days after signing the contract, Arca came on as a substitute in an away league match at Leeds United and passed to Marvin Emnes to score the only goal of the game. He continued to remain involved in the first team in a number of matches since returning to the club, mostly coming on from the substitute bench. But at times, Arca was given starts in the first team in a number of matches. In a match against Cardiff City on 17 December 2011, he set up a goal for Faris Haroun (who scored earlier in the game) to score the winning goal, in a 3–2 win. In a 3–1 loss against Coventry City on 21 January 2012, Arca was sent–off at the last minute of the game for a foul on Sammy Clingan. After serving three matches, he returned to the first team in the starting line-up, in a 2–1 win over Nottingham Forest on 14 February 2012. In a follow–up against Millwall, Arca set up a goal for Curtis Main to score the third goal of the game, in a 3–1 win. Despite being sidelined during the 2011–12 season, Arca finished the season, making thirty–three appearances in all competitions.

At the start of the 2012–13 season, Arca appeared three times in the first team throughout August. However, his first team opportunities at Middlesbrough was limited and placed on the substitute bench. Arca was then sidelined with a toe injury that saw him out for months. He was never featured in the first team for the rest of the 2012–13 season. At the end of the 2012–13 season, making three appearances, Arca was released by the club.

Arca later retired from professional football after his Middlesbrough contract expired in 2013.

===South Shields===
Arca played for Willow Pond, a second-division pub side in the Sunderland Sunday League. In July 2015, he returned to Sunderland to join the club&#x27;s youth coaching staff.

On 4 September 2015, Arca joined Northern League Division Two club South Shields. He scored on his debut for the club, in a 1–1 draw with Stokesley Sports Club at Mariners Park. He later scored a goal against Ryton &amp; Crawcrook Albion as the Mariners won 4–0 in front of a crowd of 1,045, while his third goal for South Shields came when he scored a free-kick in a 4–0 victory at Esh Winning. Arca went on to score 12 times in his first season with the Mariners as they were promoted to Division One of the Northern League as champions.

The following season, Arca captained the side and played at the Wembley Stadium in the FA Vase Final, as they beat Cleethorpes Town 4–0. Following this, it was announced that he would signed a two–year contract with South Shields. At the end of the 2017–18 season, Arca announced his retirement from football for the second time in his career; where by the time he retired, Arca helped South Shields to three promotions and three cup wins.

==International career==
Arca was the captain of the Argentina Youth Team which featured players like Javier Saviola, Nicolás Burdisso and Maxi Rodríguez in the same squad. He won his only U21 cap in a 1–0 friendly defeat to England on 22 February 2000. During his playing time at Argentina Youth Team, Arca said he learned under José Pékerman, who at the time was in charge of Argentina&#x27;s youth sides.

After his successful first season in the Premier League with Sunderland, Arca captained the Argentina Under-20 team which won the FIFA U-20 World Cup tournament in Buenos Aires, Argentina. They beat the Ghana U-20 team 3–0 in the final to win their fourth title. Earlier in the season he had been a part of the U20 team which had finished as runners-up in the 2001 South American U20 Championship. During which, Arca scored twice for the international side.

Three years later in 2004, Arca was expected to be called up for the Summer Olympic qualification. But Sunderland refused to allow him to play in the qualification, citing his commitment to the club. He was expected to be included in the Argentina U23 squad at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Despite hopes of getting called, it was later announced that he was not included in the Argentina&#x27;s squad for the Olympic Games. Although Arca expressed his disappointment of not being included, he accepted the decision being made and would focus on his commitment at Sunderland. Three years later, Arca said that he hope he would receive a call-up from the senior team; using then Premier League players Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano as example.

==Coaching career==
On 27 April 2023, Arca was appointed manager of his former club South Shields following the club&#x27;s promotion to the National League North. On 27 December 2023, Arca was sacked by the club after a poor run of form. A 3–1 home defeat to local rivals Blyth Spartans proved the final straw for Arca as his side slipped to 8th in the table, marking their sixth game without a win.

==Personal life==
His father is Raúl Arca, who was also a footballer at Racing Club&#x27;s Reserve Team but did not make an appearance and retired soon after, and has a younger brother. Growing up, he supported River Plate but only did so because his family were supporters of the club. However, he rarely saw the team play, as he preferred to kick a ball himself. He has Italian origins through his grandfather, which allowed him to have an Italian passport in August 2000. However, it was under scrutiny when Arca used a fake passport; which Italian Embassy in Buenos Aires responded with: &quot;Finally, at the request of the club Julio Arca&#x27;s passport was presented to immigration authorities at Heathrow Airport, who assessed and verified this in advance of his arrival.&quot;

When Arca started out at Sunderland, he struggled to speak English and had to rely on Emerson Thome to act as an interpreter. Since settling in England, he quickly to learn and speak English. Because he was a fan favourite at Sunderland, the supporters recorded a musical tribute to Arca, calling the song: Hooolio. In August 2004, Arca suffered a severe allergic reaction after being stung by a jellyfish when he was swimming in the North Sea. Having spent five years in England so far, he revealed that he has now settled in the country.

Arca is married to his native wife, Valeria, and together, they have two children. Since moving to England, he resided in Wearside, along with his family. Following his retirement from professional football, Arca earned his UEFA B Licence, having announced his intention to become a manager in 2015. He then became a Manager of the Sunderland Under 14 side. In 2019, Arca and his family moved back to Argentina, where he started a new business, Premier Sport Division, which helps sportspeople to relocate, transporting their lives across the world when they join new clubs.

<doc id="1238479" wikidata="Q1429256" url="?curid=1238479" title="War of the League of Cognac">
<text>The War of the League of Cognac (1526–30) was fought between the Habsburg dominions of Charles V—primarily the Holy Roman Empire and Spain—and the League of Cognac, an alliance including the Kingdom of France, Pope Clement VII, the Republic of Venice, the Kingdom of England, the Duchy of Milan, and the Republic of Florence.

== Prelude ==

Shocked by the defeat of the Kingdom of France in the Italian War of 1521, Pope Clement VII, together with the Republic of Venice, began to organize an alliance to drive Charles V from the Italian Peninsula. Francis I, having signed the Treaty of Madrid, was released from his captivity in Madrid and returned to France, where he quickly announced his intention to assist Clement. Thus, on 22 May 1526, the League of Cognac was signed by Francis, Clement, Venice, Florence, and the Sforza of Milan, who desired to throw off the Imperial hegemony over them. Henry VIII of England, thwarted in his requests to have the treaty signed in England, refused to join.

== Initial moves ==

The League quickly seized the town of Lodi, but Imperial troops marched into Lombardy and soon forced Sforza to abandon Milan. Meanwhile, the powerful Colonna family organized an attack on Rome to exploit the Papacy&#x27;s moment of weakness, defeating the Papal forces and briefly seizing control of the city in September 1526. They were soon paid off and left the city

== Sack of Rome ==
Charles V now gathered a force of 14,000 German landsknecht mercenaries and 6,000 Spanish tercio soldiers led by Georg Frundsberg and Charles of Bourbon; the forces combined at Piacenza and advanced on Rome. Francesco Guicciardini, now in command of the Papal armies, proved unable to resist them; and when the Duke of Bourbon was killed, the underpaid armies sacked the city, forcing the Pope to take refuge at Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. His escape was made possible by the Swiss Guards&#x27; last stand.

== Siege of Naples ==
The looting of Rome, and the consequent removal of Clement from any real role in the war, prompted frantic action on the part of the French. On 30 April 1527, Henry VIII and Francis signed the Treaty of Westminster, pledging to combine their forces against Charles. Francis, having finally drawn Henry VIII into the League, sent an army under Odet de Foix and Pedro Navarro, Count of Oliveto through Genoa—where Andrea Doria had quickly joined the French and seized much of the Genoese fleet—to Naples, where it proceeded to dig itself in for an extended siege.

== Siege of Genoa ==

Doria, however, soon deserted the French for Charles. The siege collapsed as plague broke out in the French camp, killing most of the army along with Foix and Navarro. Andrea Doria&#x27;s offensive in Genoa (where he soon broke the blockade of the city and forced the surrender of the French at Savona), together with the decisive defeat of a French relief force under François de Bourbon, Comte de Saint-Pol at the Battle of Landriano, ended Francis&#x27;s hopes of regaining his hold on Italy.

== Barcelona, Cambrai, and Bologna ==

Following the defeat of his armies, Francis sought peace with Charles. The negotiations began in July 1529 in the border city of Cambrai; they were conducted primarily between Francis&#x27;s mother Louise of Savoy for the French and her sister-in-law Margaret of Austria for her nephew the Emperor (leading to its being known as the &quot;Paix des Dames&quot;, Peace of the Ladies), Charles himself having sailed from Barcelona to Italy shortly before. The final terms largely mirrored those of the Treaty of Madrid three years earlier; Francis surrendered his rights to Artois, Flanders, and Tournai, and was obliged to pay a ransom of two million golden écus before his sons were to be released. Removed, however, were both the humiliating surrender of Burgundy itself and the various points dealing with Charles de Bourbon, who, having been killed two years prior, was no longer a candidate for leading an independent Kingdom of Provence. The final Treaty of Cambrai, signed on 3 August, removed France from the war, leaving Venice, Florence, and the Pope alone against Charles.

Charles, having arrived in Genoa, proceeded to Bologna to meet with the Pope. Clement absolved the participants of the sack of Rome and promised to crown Charles. In return, he received Ravenna and Cervia; cities which the Republic of Venice was forced to surrender—along with her remaining possessions in Apulia—to Charles in exchange for being permitted to retain the holdings she had won at Marignano. Finally, Francesco was permitted to return to Milan—Charles having abandoned his earlier plan to place Alessandro de&#x27; Medici on the throne, in part due to Venetian objections—for the sum of 900,000 scudi.

== Fall of the Florentine Republic ==

The Republic of Florence alone continued to resist the Imperial forces, which were led by the Prince of Orange. A Florentine army under Francesco Ferruccio engaged the armies of the Emperor at the Battle of Gavinana in 1530, and, although the Prince of Orange himself was killed, the Imperial army won a decisive victory and the Republic of Florence surrendered ten days later. Alessandro de&#x27; Medici was then installed as Duke of Florence by Pope Clement VII, and from then on Florence became a hereditary realm of the powerful Medici dynasty, ending centuries of republican rule.

<doc id="1238491" wikidata="Q1125100" url="?curid=1238491" title="Stephen Elliott (footballer)">
<text>Stephen William Elliott (born 6 January 1984) is a professional football manager. He is currently the manager of League of Ireland First Division club Wexford. During his playing career he played for Manchester City, Sunderland, Wolves, Preston North End, Heart of Midlothian, Coventry City, Carlisle United, Shelbourne, Drogheda United and Morpeth Town, and also had a loan spell at Norwich City.

He played in nine international matches for the Republic of Ireland between 2004 and 2006, scoring once.

==Club career==
Elliott began his career as a youth player with Belvedere. and Stella Maris.

===Manchester City===
Elliott began his professional career as a youth player at Manchester City after impressing in a trial match with Stella Maris in which he scored five goals in the space of half an hour. His league debut came on 21 February 2004 when Kevin Keegan used him as a late substitute in a 3–1 win at Bolton Wanderers. He failed to establish himself in the first team, making only one further appearances as a substitute, with his development at City hampered by a serious back injury that ruled him out for a season.

===Sunderland===
Sunderland manager Mick McCarthy signed him from Manchester City on 1 June 2004 for an initial fee of £125,000, set by a tribunal, with well over £250,000 of additional payments linked to his subsequent performance at the Black Cats of around £100,000 if Sunderland were promoted to the Premier League; £50,000 if he played in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland; five instalments of £20,000 for each set of ten appearances he made for Sunderland up to a maximum of 50 games; and 25% of any sell-on transfer fees. McCarthy later admitted that he had bought him outrageously cheaply, although that was before all of the above add-ons were ultimately realised.
He made his debut on 7 August against Coventry in their 2–0 defeat, with his first goal for the club coming on 10 August against Crewe Alexandra, scoring the winner in their 3–1 win.
He quickly established himself as first-team regular, making 47 appearances scoring 16 goals in his debut season as the team finished as champions in 2005, helping him win the clubs young player of the season award. And in July 2005 he signed a contract extension extending his stay until 2008.

However, his first Premiership season was largely disrupted by injury, only managing 15 appearances although prior to his injuries he scored two long-range goals against Manchester United and Newcastle United.

On Sunderland&#x27;s return to the Championship the following season, he showed good form when fit, but again was disrupted by an ankle injury which kept him out for two months. In all he made 88 appearances for Sunderland scoring 23 goals.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Elliott moved to Wolves in July 2007 for an undisclosed fee signing a three-year contract, linking up with Mick McCarthy, his former manager at Sunderland. He made his debut on 11 August 2007 in their 2–1 defeat to Watford, going on to score his first goal for the club on 15 September scoring the opening goal against Sheffield United. However, he failed to make a strong impact at Molineux, and was transfer-listed at the season&#x27;s end after the club missed out on the play-offs on goal difference.

He made one more appearance for Wolves the following season in the League Cup against Rotherham. In all he made 32 appearances for Wolves scoring six times.

===Preston North End===
On 1 September 2008, Elliot signed for Championship side Preston North End on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut as a substitute on 16 September against Nottingham Forest, and scored his first goal for the club on 18 October 2008 against Reading, with the winning goal in their 2–1 win. He scored a brace against his former team Wolves at Molineux in their 3–1 win in January. He was to form a partnership with Jon Parkin in Preston&#x27;s attack. In his debut season he made 39 appearances scoring six times.

The following season he made 13 appearances scoring twice before falling out of favour and in March 2010 he joined Norwich on loan. On his return on 7 August he negotiated an early release from his Preston contract.

====Norwich City====
On 6 March 2010, Elliot signed on an emergency loan deal with Norwich City until the end of the season and was given the number 11 shirt. He made his debut on 6 March 2010 against Yeovil in League One, scoring his first goals for the club the following week, scoring a brace against Huddersfield in their 3–1 win. In all he made ten appearances scoring twice.

===Heart of Midlothian===
On 9 August 2010 Elliott joined Scottish Premier League side Heart of Midlothian on a two-year deal, reuniting him with former strike partner at Sunderland Kevin Kyle. He made his debut as a 66th-minute substitute on 14 August against St Johnstone at Tynecastle, going on to make his first start on 7 November against rivals Hibernian in the first Edinburgh Derby of the season scoring the second goal in a 2–0 victory for Hearts. He scored his first home goal for the club on 10 December to make the score 3–0 in a 5–0 victory against Aberdeen. Despite a hamstring injury that put him out for a month, he made 31 appearances scoring eight goals in his debut season.

Elliott become renowned for his crucial goals away from home. Of his eight goals for Hearts in his debut season, seven came away from home including doubles at Hamilton in a 2–0 win, and at Kilmarnock in a 2–1 victory, the latter coming after Elliott had come off the substitutes bench for the second half to reverse a 1–0 deficit. Elliott scored an equalising goal in the 83rd minute of the third Edinburgh derby of the season, earning Hearts a 2–2 draw despite having played for over an hour with ten men.

He made his European debut on 28 July 2011 in a Europa League qualifier against Paksi. Elliott helped Hearts win the 2011–12 Scottish Cup; he started in the 2012 Scottish Cup Final, which Hearts won 5–1 against Hibernian. Days later, Hearts announced that Elliott&#x27;s contract would not be renewed due to financial problems within the club.

===Coventry City===
On 2 July 2012, Elliott joined Football League One side Coventry City on a one-year deal after his Heart of Midlothian contract had expired. He scored three goals up to the new year, against Sheffield United and scored two against MK Dons at Stadium MK which Coventry won 3–2 after going behind. Coventry manager Steven Pressley announced on 30 April 2013 that Elliott&#x27;s contract would not be renewed having picked up a serious knee injury.

===Carlisle United===
On 7 August 2014, Elliott signed a one-year deal with recently relegated Football League Two side Carlisle United.

===Return to Ireland===
In April 2016, Elliott trained with League of Ireland Premier Division club Shamrock Rovers before signing for Dublin First Division side Shelbourne.
On 11 August 2016, Shelbourne announced Stephen had left by mutual consent. Elliott signed for newly promoted Premier Division side Drogheda United for the 2017 season but he really struggled to find any long term fitness due to injuries and he could not help them from finishing bottom of the league and being relegated.

=== Morpeth Town ===
Elliott signed for Northern League Division One outfit Morpeth Town in November 2017. He retired at the end of the season.

==International career==
Elliott has represented Ireland at U-17 level, U-19, the U-20 team at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship, where he was their top goalscorer, and the U-21 team where he made 10 appearances scoring six times.

Elliott&#x27;s good start for Sunderland in 2004 led to a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad, and he made his international debut against Croatia at Lansdowne Road on 16 November 2004. He scored his first senior International goal to beat Cyprus 1–0 in a World Cup qualifier on 8 October 2005. In all he made nine appearances for Ireland at full international level.

==Post Playing Career==
After retiring as a player, Elliott spent time working in the media as a football analyst for various outlets. He spent time as Head of Academy at Darlington, before he moved on to become Lead Coach of the Under-15 and Under-16 sides at Fleetwood Town. On 31 January 2024, Elliott was announced as Head of Academy Football at St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic and also head coach of the club&#x27;s Under-20 side.

On 26 November 2024, Elliott was named as manager of League of Ireland First Division club Wexford.

==Personal life==
Elliott was born in the North Inner City Dublin area in the Republic of Ireland. He is often known by the nickname of Sleeves, which he picked up whilst playing for Sunderland from a phrase he said &quot;Sleeves Up&quot;.

<doc id="1238496" wikidata="Q3636591" url="?curid=1238496" title="Battle of Puná">
<text>The Battle of Puná, a peripheral engagement of Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s conquest of Peru, was fought in April 1531 on the island of Puná (in the Gulf of Guayaquil) in Ecuador. Pizarro&#x27;s conquistadors, boasting superior weaponry and tactical skill, decisively defeated the island&#x27;s indigenous inhabitants. The battle marked the beginning of Pizarro&#x27;s third and final expedition before the fall of the Inca Empire.

==Background==
The Spanish army, following a long and difficult journey from Panama throughout which many had fallen to virulence, predation, and other hazards, had docked at the Inca city of Tumbes in April. Received with quiet hostility by Incas who had perhaps been alerted to the acts of pillage and plunder committed on the fringes of the Empire by the invaders, the Spaniards, deeming it unsafe to remain in Tumbes, relocated their camp to the nearby island of Puna in preparation for an assault on the Inca city.

Initially, the Spanish occupation of the island proceeded without bloodshed. The natives of Puna were a warrior people who, reluctantly bowing before the might of the Inca Empire, had intermittently accepted the status of tributary state, though periods of friction and even open warfare had frequently erupted with the Incas out on the mainland.

The path to war was first triggered by Pizarro&#x27;s native interpreters, who warned him, perhaps falsely, that several Punian chiefs had gathered to plan an insurrection. Pizarro had the chiefs captured, interrogated, and, apparently satisfied with their guilt, delivered to their traditional enemies at Tumbes where they were duly massacred by the Incas.

==Battle==
According to Spanish sources, the warrior class of Puná, maddened with rage, immediately rushed to arms and stormed the Spanish camp, charging in the thousands. It seemed that the diminutive Spanish force would surely be overwhelmed and scattered. But what the Spaniards lacked in numbers they eclipsed in armaments and discipline. As the natives approached, many were met head on with deadly rows of lowered pikes, the use of which the Spanish had long mastered in the great wars of Italy and Flanders. Other Punians, charging in confused masses, were cut down and slaughtered in vast numbers by the concerted volleys of orderly musketeers. At length, Hernando Pizarro, sensing the enemy falter, mustered his cavaliers to his standard and spurred his horse into a charge. The Spanish cavalry sliced through native ranks with devastating effect. Within minutes, the Punians were in full rout.

The natives regrouped in the island&#x27;s forests and thenceforth waged a guerrilla war to some success, destroying Spanish provisions and waylaying several scouts. Two Spanish ships with reinforcements, however, under Hernando de Soto, soon arrived by sea (with at least a hundred volunteers), and on these ships the Spaniards, bound for more fruitful conquests on the Peruvian mainland, embarked without incident and sailed back towards Tumbez, arriving there on May 16, 1532.

<doc id="1238499" wikidata="Q569225" url="?curid=1238499" title="Hershey Bears">
<text>The Hershey Bears are a professional ice hockey team based in Hershey, Pennsylvania, a town located 14 miles east of the state capital of Harrisburg. The current Bears club has played in the American Hockey League since the 1938–39 season, making it the longest continuously operating member club of the league still playing in its original city.

The Bears organization has served as the primary development club for the NHL&#x27;s Washington Capitals since 2005–06. Since 2002–03, the hockey club&#x27;s home games have been played at Giant Center, located less than half a mile west of Hersheypark Arena, the AHL club&#x27;s previous home from 1938 to 2002. (The arena was also the home to the EAHL Hershey Bears from 1936 to 1938.) The Bears have won 13 Calder Cups, more than any other AHL team. They won their most recent title in 2024.

Chocolate manufacturer Milton S. Hershey first established the &quot;Hershey Hockey Club&quot; in 1932 to manage professional hockey teams based in Hershey. Now in its ninth decade, it has operated four teams in three pro leagues, including the AHL Bears. Now called the Hershey Bears Hockey Club, it is a subsidiary of the Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company (originally called &quot;Hershey Estates&quot; and later &quot;HERCO&quot;), the entertainment and hospitality division of the Hershey Trust Company.

Gordie Howe, who was selected into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972 and was known as &quot;Mr. Hockey&quot;, once remarked, &quot;Everybody who is anybody in hockey has played in Hershey,&quot; although he himself did not play there.

==Team history==

===The origins of &quot;Hershey Hockey&quot;===

The history of Hershey hockey goes back to a series of amateur hockey matches played in Hershey between college teams beginning in early 1931. The first such formal hockey game ever played in Hershey took place on February 18, 1931, when Penn A.C. and Villanova University faced off in the 1,900-seat Hershey Ice Palace. Nine months after that successful inaugural contest, Swarthmore Athletic Club moved into the Ice Palace, where they played their first game on November 19, 1931, against Crescent A.C. of New York City. In the lineup that night for Crescent was a 23-year-old center named Lloyd S. Blinco, a native of Grand Mere, Quebec, who came to Hershey the next season and would remain continuously associated with Hershey hockey for a half century as a player, coach, and manager.

The popularity of these amateur hockey matches prompted chocolate-maker and amusement park operator Milton Hershey and his long-time entertainment and amusements chief, John B. Sollenberger, to bring pro hockey to Hershey by sponsoring a permanent team. To that end, Mr. Hershey established the Hershey Hockey Club (now called the Hershey Bears Hockey Club) in 1932, which is now the oldest such continuously operating professional ice hockey management organization (the players themselves were ostensibly amateurs during the first few years) in North America outside of those operating the &quot;Original Six&quot; clubs of the National Hockey League in Montreal, Toronto, Boston, New York, Chicago, and Detroit, which were all established in or before 1926. The first hockey team the organization iced was the amateur Hershey B&#x27;ars in the newly formed Tri-State Hockey League which included three other teams from Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Atlantic City. After a single season in 1932–33, that circuit reformed itself into a larger, seven-club Eastern Amateur Hockey League in which Hershey played first as the &quot;Chocolate B&#x27;ars&quot; (1933–1934), then again as the &quot;B&#x27;ars&quot; (1934–1936), and finally from 1936 to 1938 as the &quot;Hershey Bears&quot;, a name adopted in response to criticism levied by New York sportswriters and the league that the &quot;B&#x27;ars&quot; moniker was too commercial. (These writers had already informally dubbed the club as the &quot;Bears from Penn&#x27;s Woods&quot; when they visited Madison Square Garden to play the New York Rovers.)

On December 19, 1936, the newly renamed EAHL Bears also moved from the confines of the Ice Palace (where they had to play on a small, 60x170-foot rink) into the newly constructed 7,286-seat Hersheypark Arena (then known as the &quot;Hershey Sports Arena&quot;) built immediately adjacent to the older venue. Over the next 66 seasons, Bears&#x27; teams played a total of 2,280 EAHL and AHL regular season and playoff games at the Hersheypark Arena, which served as the home to hockey in Hershey from 1936 to 2002. Since 2002, the Bears have used Hersheypark Arena as their practice arena only.

The Bears won the 1937 EAHL championship, then played in an international tournament arranged by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) to determine a world&#x27;s amateur champion, in direct conflict with the actual 1937 Ice Hockey World Championships. The CAHA tournament was hosted at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, and invited the champions of the 1937 Allan Cup (Sudbury Tigers), the 1937 Memorial Cup (Winnipeg Monarchs), the EAHL (Hershey Bears) and the English National League (Wembley Lions). The schedule for the competition was a six-game double round-robin tournament from April 17 to 24, followed by a best-of-three game final series between the top two teams. CAHA representative W. A. Hewitt announced the shortening of the series due to poor attendance. The game between Hershey and Winnipeg was cancelled as both teams went home early, with the tournament being completed by a best-of-three series between Sudbury and Wembley, which Sudbury won on a sudden death overtime goal by George Hastie in the third game.
===The Bears join the IAHL===

Since 1936, the Canadian–American Hockey League and International Hockey League had formed an eight-team &quot;circuit of mutual convenience&quot; playing an interlocking schedule as the International-American Hockey League.

On June 28, 1938, the Can-Am and IHL formally merged into a single league under the IAHL name. One of the first acts of the newly merged league, which became the American Hockey League in 1940, was to grant an expansion franchise to the Hershey Bears Hockey Club, which at the time still owned and operated the EAHL Hershey Bears, the then three-time regular-season champions of that league. The new Bears took the Bisons&#x27; place in the IAHL&#x27;s West Division, allowing the IAHL to play a balanced schedule for the first time in over two years. While the new Bears began play in the IAHL in 1938, the hockey club also continued to operate an EAHL team, the Hershey Cubs, for one more season before leaving that league altogether. In 1977 Hershey became the only original AHL hockey club to have continuously iced a team in the same city since the league&#x27;s inaugural season as a fully merged league when the Rhode Island Reds franchise was sold and moved to New York state as the Binghamton Dusters after the 1976–77 campaign.
Defenseman Henry J. &quot;Hank&quot; Lauzon, an original EAHL B&#x27;ar, became the first player to sign with the new Bears. The former EAHL club&#x27;s coach, Herb Mitchell, guided the IAHL Bears for their first three seasons. The Bears made a very good account of themselves in their first IAHL campaign, winning the West Division with a 31–18–5 record—the first of 16 regular-season division titles. However, they were defeated in the first round of the Calder Cup playoffs by the New York Rangers&#x27; top farm team, the Philadelphia Ramblers, three-games-to-two. Defenseman Herb Kalbfleisch became the first Hershey player to be named a First Team All Star that year while goalie Alfie Moore took Second Team honors behind the Ramblers&#x27; Bert Gardiner.

Former Boston Bruins&#x27; coach and Hockey Hall of Fame member (elected 1971) Ralph &quot;Cooney&quot; Weiland guided Hershey throughout the war years winning regular-season titles in 1942–43 and 1943–44. The Bears&#x27; 13 losses in 1942–43 are still the fewest by the club in a single season while Wally Kilrea&#x27;s 99 points (31–68) that season gave Hershey its first of ten AHL scoring champions. Hershey won their first of 13 Calder Cup titles in 1947 under second year coach Don Penniston while also winning their fourth Division title in just nine seasons that year dominating the AHL&#x27;s East with 84 points (25 more than second-place Springfield) on a record of 36–16–12 behind All Star goalie Harvey Bennett, Sr. In the playoffs, Hershey defeated the Western Division champion Cleveland Barons in a four-game first-round sweep outscoring them 24–3 before winning the Calder Cup finals in seven games over the Pittsburgh Hornets.

In 1948, 21-year-old Winnipeg-born center Arnie Kullman joined the Bears, and except for 13 games with the Boston Bruins in 1949–50, he played his entire twelve-year career in Hershey. When Kullman retired in 1960 he had amassed 629 points on 253 goals and 376 assists in a Hershey uniform, a total which would only be eclipsed by Tim Tookey (with whom he shared number nine that was eventually retired in honor of both players) and Mike Nykoluk. Kullman&#x27;s 753 games as a Bear is also second only to Nykoluk&#x27;s 972.

===1950s–1960s===
From 1950 to 1956 the Bears were coached by a pair of former Boston Bruin defensemen: Johnny Crawford (1950–52), who guided Hershey to another division title in 1951–52, followed by player-coach Murray Henderson (1952–56). In 1953–54, center George &quot;Red&quot; Sullivan became the second Bear to win a scoring title and the first to be named the league&#x27;s MVP, collecting 119 points (30–89) in 69 games to set an AHL regular-season scoring record which stood for almost thirty years, while his 89 assists that season is still an AHL record six decades later.

Although never an All Star, another player to briefly skate in Hershey during this era was Don &quot;Grapes&quot; Cherry who as a coach (Rochester, Boston, Colorado) and later a broadcaster became and still remains one of the game&#x27;s most visible and controversial figures. As a 20-year-old defenseman Cherry made his professional debut with the Bears during the 1954–55 season and also played for the club in 1956–57. As a TV personality and longtime commentator on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, this former Bear is one of the best-known figures in Canada in any field.

With the demise of the AHL Pittsburgh Hornets in 1956, Bears managers John Sollenberger and Lloyd Blinco were able to acquire the services of seven of the recent Calder Cup champion Hornets&#x27; best players including four-time All Star goalie Gil Mayer and the AHL&#x27;s eventual all-time scoring leader Willie Marshall (523–852—1,205). The most important from Pittsburgh, however, was the AHL&#x27;s only five-time First-Team All-Star defenseman, Frank S. Mathers, who remained active with the Bears for an unprecedented thirty-five seasons as an All Star defenseman, player-coach, general manager, and club president. Under Mathers&#x27; leadership, Hershey won over 1,500 games and six Calder Cup titles while Mathers himself was honored with the Lester Patrick Award in 1987 for his &quot;contributions to hockey in the United States&quot;, and in 1992 he became the second individual to be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame based on a career in the AHL.

While the Mathers era in Hershey started slowly with a fourth-place finish in 1956–57, he led the Bears back-to-back Calder Cup titles in his second and third seasons as a player-coach. With Bobby Perreault and Mayer in goal, the league&#x27;s top two scorers in linemates Marshall and Dunc Fisher, and Mathers himself earning All Star honors on defense for the sixth time in seven years, the Bears won both the regular season and playoff championships in 1957–58. Although Hershey finished the 1958–59 season with just a .500 record (32–32–6), they defeated the Cleveland Barons in the first round before upsetting the regular-season champion Buffalo Bisons in the finals, four games to two, to win their third Calder Cup title.
In 1958 the Bears also acquired the services of 23-year-old center Mike Nykoluk who had split the previous two seasons between the Toronto Maple Leafs and their AHL club in Rochester. When Nykoluk retired fourteen years later in 1972, he was the AHL&#x27;s then fourth (now sixth) all-time leader in points with 881 on 195 goals and 686 assists and his 972 games as a Bear are 219 more than Kullman&#x27;s second overall 753 in a Hershey uniform. In 1972 his jersey number eight also became the first to ever be retired by the Bears.

Although it was more than a decade before the Calder Cup returned to Hershey, during the first half of the 1960s five key players joined the club who would each stay from anywhere from seven to nine seasons: defensemen Barry Ashbee (1962–70) and Ralph Keller (1963–72), and forwards Roger DeJordy (1962–70), Michel Harvey (1963–71) and Gil Gilbert (1965–72). Together they would eventually account for 2,654 games played, 710 goals, 1,251 assists, and 1,961 points as Bears. While these five and league MVP Mike Nykoluk all helped the Bears win their division&#x27;s regular-season title in 1966–67, for the first time since 1957–58, on a 38–24–10 record behind the goaltending of First Team All Star Andre Gill and a league-leading 52 goals by DeJordy, it would be another two years before the Calder Cup returned to Hershey in 1968–69 defeating the Quebec Aces in five games. Gilbert led the league in scoring with 100 points (35–65) with teammate Michel Harvey close behind at 93 as the Bears also won their third consecutive Eastern Divisional title. That season also saw Mathers add the duties of GM to his portfolio with the retirement of Lloyd Blinco from that post.

===1970s–1980s===

With the close the 1972–73 season Frank Mathers ended his unbroken 17-year run as coach to devote his efforts full-time to his duties as GM. Including a brief return to the bench in 1984–85, Mathers compiled a personal coaching record of 610-513-134 for a career-winning percentage of .539. His successor was former Bears&#x27; winger Chuck Hamilton (1973–79) who had spent seven seasons playing for Hershey from 1963 to 1970. In his first season as the Bears&#x27; coach Hamilton led a relatively inexperienced squad including nine rookies to a fifth Calder Cup title losing only two games in the playoffs&#x27; three rounds in which they were victorious against the Cincinnati Swords (4–1), Baltimore Clippers (4–0), and Providence Reds (4–1) with the championship game played at the Arena before a then record crowd of 8,703.

Hershey won a sixth Calder Cup in 1979–80 under player/coach Doug Gibson who replaced first year coach Gary Green when he was unexpectedly promoted to the Bears&#x27; then NHL affiliate, the Washington Capitals, early in the season. Gibson also led the Bears in playoff scoring with a dozen goals and seven assists for 19 points in sixteen Calder Cup games while goaltending was shared by Gary Inness (6–1) who himself would later coach the team and Dave Parro (6–3). Although Hershey had finished four games below .500 during the regular season (35–39–9), the Bears defeated the Syracuse Firebirds (4–0) in the opening round before upsetting both the Southern Division champion New Haven Nighthawks (4–2) in the semifinals and the Northern Division winning New Brunswick Hawks (4–2) in the finals with two of their four wins in the championship series in double overtime.

Although the Bears did not repeat as Calder Cup champions in 1980–81, under new coach Bryan Murray the club had its best regular season to that point with 103 points on a record of 47–24–9 and established a still-standing record for goals with 357. Right wing Mark Lofthouse became the fifth Bear to win the AHL&#x27;s scoring title (48-55–103), and on the night of February 7, 1981, he also set a team single-game record eight points (4–4) as the Bears defeated the Rochester Americans at Hersheypark Arena, 11–2, while the team also tied the AHL&#x27;s then record for goals in a period with nine. Among the Bears&#x27; rookies that year was a 20-year-old center Tim Tookey, who over three separate stints with the Bears (1980–82, 1985–87, 1989–94) over the next fourteen years collected 693 points (251–442) in 529 regular-season games, second only to Mike Nykoluk&#x27;s 808 on the Bears&#x27; all-time list.

As had Gary Green in 1979, Murray left the Bears early in the 1981–82 season to become coach of the Washington Capitals (replacing Green) and was replaced by former Hershey goalie Gary Inness under most unusual circumstances. Inness had retired as a player a year earlier but wanted to remain in Hershey and keep involved with the Bears. With no coaching position available to offer him, but in need of a new trainer, Bears&#x27; GM Frank Mathers offered him that job. With Murray&#x27;s promotion to Washington a month later elevated Inness the eleventh coach in the Bears&#x27; history. Inness would remain behind the Hershey bench until December, 1984, when Frank Mathers returned to that post on an interim basis for the first time since 1973 and coached the club until then recently retired Hall of Fame Flyer winger Bill Barber took over for the final sixteen games of the season.

The 1984–85 season was also the first of a dozen year affiliation with the Philadelphia Flyers who shared the club with the Boston Bruins that year before taking over as the sole parent club the next season and remained so through 1995–96. Former Flyer right wing and AHL Hall of Fame coach John Paddock (1985–89) took over for the next four seasons and under his guidance the Bears averaged 45 wins a year, won two overall regular-season titles, reached the play-off finals twice, and brought Hershey a seventh Calder Cup championship in 1987–88.

In his first year as the Bears&#x27; coach, Paddock led the club to first place overall in the regular season with a 48–29–3 record and either four goals in the final game of that 1985–86 season, left wing Ross Fitzpatrick became the third Bear to score 50 goals in a season while rookie goalie Ron Hextall set a team record with three consecutive shutouts at home. Both Hextall and defenseman Kevin McCarthy were First Team All Stars while linemates Fitzpatrick and Tim Tookey were both named to the second All Star Team. With five shutouts and a 30–19–2 record, Hextall became the first (and so far only) Bear to be named AHL Rookie of the Year as well as winning the Baz Bastien Memorial Trophy as the AHL&#x27;s top goalie. (As an NHL rookie the following season with the Flyers Hextall won both the Vezina Trophy and Conn Smythe Trophy.) Although the Bears lost to the Adirondack Red Wings in the Calder Cup finals, Tookey also won the Jack Butterfield Trophy as MVP of the play-offs.)

Although the Bears finished fourth in the Southern Division in 1986–87 with 87 points (43–36–1), their top line of Tookey, Fitzpatrick and Ray Allison finished first, fifth and seventh in overall league scoring with 124, 85 and 84 points respectively and accounted for a total of 125 of the Bears&#x27; 329 goals while center Mitch Lamoureux also finished in the top ten with 43 goals and 46 assists for 89 points good for fourth overall in the league. Tookey&#x27;s 124 points (51 goals, 73 assists) also established a still-standing single-season record for a Hershey player, made him the seventh Bear to win the AHL&#x27;s scoring title, and just the third to win the Les Cunningham Plaque as the league&#x27;s MVP. Tookey&#x27;s 124 points that year is still the sixth-best single-season total for an individual player in AHL history, just fourteen points less than the current league record of 138 set by former Bear Don Biggs with the Binghamton Rangers in 1992–93.

With the start of the 1987–88 season, Hershey became the first professional hockey club outside of the NHL to reach the half century mark and that year also both won a then league record 50 regular-season games and swept all three of its playoff series for an unblemished postseason record of 12–0 and a seventh Calder Cup title. After an unexpectedly slow 3–7–0 start, goalie Wendell Young was returned to Hershey from the Flyers and went 33–15–3 with a 2.77 GAA while rookie Darryl Gilmour appeared in 25 games compiling a 14–7–0 record and 3.68 average. Along with veterans such as Bears&#x27; leading scorer center Mitch Lamoureux, wingers Al Hill, Don Nachbaur, Kevin Maxwell, and defensemen Steve Smith and Dave Fenvyes, the team also had nine first- and second-year players including second-year winger Brian Dobbin who finished third in team scoring behind Lamoureux and Maxwell with 83 points (36–47) even though he had been recalled to Philadelphia seven times during the campaign and only played in 54 games for Hershey, and rookie center Glen Seabrooke also broke the 30-goal mark (32) and was fifth overall in Bears scoring with 78 points. On defense the Bears had second-year blueliner John Stevens, now associate coach of the two-time Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings, rookie Gordie Murphy who is now an assistant coach with the Flyers, and Jeff Chychrun, another sophomore. On May 12, 1988, Hershey completed its unprecedented 12–0 sweep to the Cup by defeating the Fredericton Express, 4–2.

===Modern era===
The Washington Capitals returned as the Bears NHL parent club in 2005 after a 21-year span with the Boston Bruins, the Philadelphia Flyers, and the Colorado Avalanche. (The club has also had earlier NHL affiliations with the Bruins, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Buffalo Sabres.) As of the 2009–2010 Calder Cup Finals, the Bears have played in 22 Finals series, a league record. The Bears went back-to-back in 2008–2010 to win their 10th and 11th Calder Cups, winning their most recent cup versus the Texas Stars. The Bears became the first team in AHL history to win a Calder Cup series after trailing the series 0–2, going on to win 4 straight to take the series 4–2.

On December 20, 2006, the Bears played their 5,000th regular-season game at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York. The Bears scored seven times en route to a 7–4 win versus the Albany River Rats. On May 2, 2007, the Bears played their 500th Calder Cup playoff game in franchise history at the GIANT Center. The Bears played the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins and won 4–3.

In 2010, the Bears set a new club record with 12 straight wins, topping their previous record of 11 which was set the season earlier in 2008. Over the stretch from December into January, the Bears outscored their opponents by a 52–22 margin. The Bears also set a new AHL record for consecutive home victories at 24. Hershey went without a loss at GIANT Center from November 29, 2009, to March 19, 2010. Hershey has set an AHL mark for consecutive playoff series victories, with eight wins in a row. Besting the record shared with the 2005–2007 Bears and the 1990–1992 Springfield Indians.

===2006 Calder Cup championship===
In 2006 the Hershey Bears, with new head coach Bruce Boudreau, returned to the playoffs after a two-year absence. The team came off with a strong start by winning their first two series, against the Norfolk Admirals and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, in four games each. In the Eastern Conference finals, the Bears played the Portland Pirates. The Bears quickly took a 2–0 series lead, but then lost the third game. The Bears then rebounded and won Game 4 to take a 3–1 series lead. However, the Bears were unable to finish the job and were forced back to the Giant Center for Game 7. The Bears trailed throughout the game, but managed to tie it with a goal from Graham Mink just over two minutes remaining. In overtime, the Bears finished with a goal by Eric Fehr, to win the series 4–3. On June 15, 2006, The Bears won the Calder Cup by a series mark of 4–2, defeating the Milwaukee Admirals. This marked the ninth time the franchise had won the Calder Cup, which tied Hershey with the original Cleveland Barons for the highest number of AHL playoff titles.

===Tenth championship===
The following season, Boudreau&#x27;s Bears finished with a 51–17–6 record and appeared to be on the verge of repeating as champions. They rolled through the playoffs defeating Albany in five games, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton in five, and won the Eastern Conference in a sweep of Manchester. The Bears appeared to have a tenth title wrapped up against Hamilton, who had finished the regular season with 95 points compared to Hershey&#x27;s 114. The Bulldogs, however, upset the Bears 4–1. The next season was disappointing to the Bears – Boudreau was promoted to head coach of the Capitals, and the Bears would finish the season 42–30–2–6, losing to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton 4–1 in the first round.

The next season, the Bears bounced back. Finishing with a 49–23–2 record, they went on to sweep the Philadelphia Phantoms in the first round, overcome a 3–2 deficit to beat Wilkes-Barre/Scranton in the second, and then defeated Providence, 4–1, in the conference finals. They opened their 21st Calder Cup appearance with a 5–4 overtime win over the Manitoba Moose in Winnipeg, but lost Game 2, 3–1. Back home in Hershey, the Bears scored a pair of wins (3–0 and 2–1) before falling in Game 5, 3–2. In Game 6, the Bears scored three goals before Manitoba even got on the board, and then an empty-net goal sealed it. With the 4–1 victory, the Bears defeated Manitoba and finally recorded their league-record tenth Calder Cup.

===2009–10 season===

Following the Calder Cup win, head coach Bob Woods was promoted to Washington as an assistant coach. He was replaced by Mark French, a former coach in the ECHL. The 2009–10, Bears won a franchise-record 12 consecutive games and notched a 24-game win streak at the Giant Center. They went on to win 60 games, breaking the old AHL record of 57 and finishing a point shy of tying the single-season points record. The Bears rallied from a 2–0 deficit against the Texas Stars to win their 11th Calder Cup, their second consecutive championship and third in the last five seasons.

===Seasons following 11th championship===
The Bears each made the 2011, 2012, and 2013 playoffs, however they were all eliminated in the first round, and failed to make the 2014 playoffs. The Bears advanced to the second round of the 2015 Calder Cup playoffs, but were eliminated by the Hartford Wolf Pack. In the 2015–16 season, the Bears qualified for the 2016 Calder Cup playoffs where they defeated the Portland Pirates three games to two in the first round. Hershey then faced the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins in the division finals and won four games to three and won the Emile Francis Trophy. In the conference finals, the Bears defeated the regular-season champion Toronto Marlies four games to one, winning the Richard F. Canning Trophy as conference champions. In the Calder Cup finals, the Bears were swept by the Lake Erie Monsters in four games. Chris Bourque was awarded the AHL regular-season MVP Les Cunningham Award, earned the John B. Sollenberger Trophy as the league&#x27;s top scorer, and was named to the First All-Star Team. In the 2016–17 season, the Bears finished in third place in the Atlantic Division. The Bears defeated the Lehigh Valley Phantoms in the division semifinals in five games before losing to the Providence Bruins in the division finals in seven games Travis Boyd was chosen for the Second All-Star Team.

The Bears failed to qualify for the 2017–18 playoffs. The Bears made the 2019 playoffs, but were quickly eliminated by the Charlotte Checkers in the second round.

===AHL Outdoor Classic===
Hersheypark Stadium hosted the fourth annual AHL Outdoor Classic in 2013, with the Bears facing their intrastate rival Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. The &quot;Baby Pens&quot; defeated the Bears in front of a capacity crowd of 17,311 fans by a score of 2–1.

5 years later, Hershey once again held the AHL Outdoor Classic on January 20, 2018, the AHL&#x27;s 10th outdoor game, with the Bears facing their intrastate rival Lehigh Valley Phantoms. The Flyers affiliate from Allentown defeated the Bears in front of a crowd of 13,091 fans by a score of 5–2.

=== 2020&#x27;s and back-to-back Championships ===
After the 2020–21 season, the Bears won the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy for the best record in the AHL, but no playoffs were held. The Bears qualified for the 2022 Calder Cup playoffs, but fell short to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, 2 games to 1. In the 2023 Calder Cup playoffs, the Bears overcame a 2–0 series deficit in the finals to beat the Coachella Valley Firebirds in 7 games. Following the 2023–24 season, the Bears set a league record for most wins under a 72-game season (53), a franchise record in point percentage (.771), a franchise record (53–14–0–5), and total points (111) They later went on to eliminate the Cleveland Monsters in 7 games, setting up a rematch from the previous season&#x27;s finals, winning in six games to win their 13th Calder Cup.

==Team information==

===Logos and uniforms===
The colors of the Hershey Bears are dark brown, medium brown, tan, and white (though the team&#x27;s primary colors are often referred to as &quot;chocolate and white&quot;), a reference to The Hershey Company and its products. The primary logo is a medium brown bear, outlined in dark brown, roaring while standing on a hockey stick centered above the Hershey Bears wordmark. The wordmark has &quot;Hershey&quot; in tan above &quot;Bears&quot; in white (both outlined in dark brown). All these parts are contained by a circle filled in tan and outlined in dark brown on the primary logo.

Before their move to the Giant Center in 2002, the Hershey Bears wore simpler uniforms with the colors of chocolate brown and white. The previous logo used a silhouette of a skating bear with a hockey stick in brown centered in a white, ovular shield outlined in brown. For their move to the Giant Center, the Bears unveiled a new identity-its team colors being burgundy, black, gold, and silver. The primary logo was a maroon bear, outlined in black, swatting a hockey puck centered below the Hershey Bears wordmark. The wordmark was a horizontal gradient using gold and burgundy outlined in black, with the Hershey part centered on a rectangular outline designed to resemble a Hershey&#x27;s candy bar. The alternate logo consisted of a bear&#x27;s head in burgundy and black with the initials &quot;HB&quot;.

In the advent of the 2007–08 season, all of the teams of the American Hockey League unveiled newly designed Reebok Edge uniforms, including the Bears. At this time they unveiled an updated version of the &quot;old school&quot; jerseys with the word &quot;Bears&quot; written diagonally in black on a white home jersey and the word &quot;Hershey&quot; written in white on a maroon away jersey. Both jerseys featured black on both sides, the Washington Capitals logo on one shoulder and the classic &quot;skating bear&#x27; oval logo on the other shoulder.

Hershey overhauled their uniforms before the 2012–13 season. The home uniform includes a white jersey with chocolate brown and tan striping. The Bears&#x27; primary logo is centered on the front. The shoulder logos feature a stylized bear-foot print. The away jersey is chocolate brown with white shoulders and tan stripes near the bottom of the sweater. The current third jersey features a cursive style Hershey wording, above the number on the front, in a dark tan color.

The Bears current uniforms are similar to those of the 2012–13 jerseys, the uniforms consist of the Capitals eagle logo instead of both bear paws on the jersey, making the stripes larger, and making the shoulders a tan color instead of one color going around the entire jersey.

===Mascot===
The official mascot of the Bears is a brown bear called &quot;Coco&quot;. Coco wears a Bears home jersey, white helmet, brown hockey gloves, and ice skates while skating and black track pants with black shoes. He debuted on October 14, 1978, at the Hersheypark Arena.

==Teddy Bear toss==

Since 2001, The Hershey Bears annually host a charity event called the Teddy bear toss that usually is held around Christmas time. Since 2018, the Hershey Bears had consecutively broken the World Record for the Teddy Bear toss, with the most recent counting of 102,343.

<text>The Hartford Wolf Pack are a professional ice hockey team based in Hartford, Connecticut. A member of the American Hockey League (AHL), they play their home games at the XL Center. The team was established in 1926 as the Providence Reds. After a series of relocations, the team moved to Hartford in 1997 as the Hartford Wolf Pack. It is one of the oldest professional hockey franchises in existence, and the oldest continuously operating minor league hockey franchise in North America.

The franchise was renamed the Connecticut Whale in October 2010, in honor of the former Hartford Whalers of the National Hockey League (NHL), but reverted to their current name after the 2012–13 AHL season. The Wolf Pack is the top affiliate of the NHL&#x27;s New York Rangers and is one of the three professional hockey teams in Connecticut.

==History==
The franchise that became the Wolf Pack was founded in 1926 in Providence, Rhode Island as the Providence Reds, one of the five charter members of the Canadian-American Hockey League. In 1936, the Northeast-based CAHL merged with the Midwest-based International Hockey League to form the International-American Hockey League, which dropped the &quot;International&quot; from its name in 1940.

The Reds — known as the Rhode Island Reds for their final season— folded after the 1976–77 season. Shortly afterward, the owners of the Broome Dusters of the North American Hockey League bought the Reds franchise and moved it to Binghamton, New York as the Binghamton Dusters. After securing an affiliation with the Hartford Whalers in 1980, the team changed its name to the Binghamton Whalers. An affiliation change to the Rangers in 1990 — one that continues to this day — brought another new name, the Binghamton Rangers.

After the 1996–97 NHL season, the Whalers moved to Raleigh, North Carolina as the Carolina Hurricanes. Soon after the Whalers&#x27; departure, the Binghamton Rangers relocated to Hartford and began to play at the vacated Hartford Civic Center (today known as the XL Center).

Following a &quot;name-the-team&quot; contest, the franchise became the Hartford Wolf Pack, a reference to a submarine class as well as the tactic known as &quot;wolfpacking&quot;. With Connecticut being home to both the main builder of submarines (General Dynamics Electric Boat) and the US Navy&#x27;s primary submarine base, honoring the state&#x27;s naval tradition was the paramount goal. The name &quot;Seawolf&quot;, a reference to the s was considered to have been the ideal name for the team. However, it had already been taken by the Mississippi Sea Wolves of the East Coast Hockey League. Following the submarine theme, the mascot was named &quot;Sonar&quot;.

The Wolf Pack&#x27;s first coach was E.J. McGuire, and their first home game was played in front of a crowd of 12,934 fans on October 4, 1997. P.J. Stock scored the first home goal in Wolf Pack history. The first franchise goal was scored the night prior in Providence, R.I., by Pierre Sevigny. The team reached the playoffs during the first 12 years of their existence and won the Calder Cup in 2000, defeating the Rochester Americans in the Cup finals. Derek Armstrong won the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as AHL playoff MVP.

In mid-2010, the Rangers entered into a business relationship which gave former Whalers owner Howard Baldwin and his company, Hartford Hockey LLC (doing business as Whalers Sports &amp; Entertainment), control of the team&#x27;s business operations. On September 20, 2010, Baldwin announced the Wolf Pack would change their name to the Connecticut Whale in honor of the Whalers. The name change took place on November 27, 2010; the final game with the &quot;Wolf Pack&quot; name came on November 26, 2010. The opponent was Connecticut&#x27;s other AHL team, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. The Sound Tigers won 4–3, in a shootout. On November 27, 2010, the team played their first game under the new &quot;Whale&quot; name. The opponent was, again, the Sound Tigers. The Whale won 3–2, in a shootout. The attendance for the debut game was 13,089, which is the third-largest crowd in franchise history. On January 1, 2011, the Whale debuted new home jerseys featuring light blue instead of green, however, the color was shelved for the 2011–12 season.

The Whale were hosts and participants in the 2011 AHL Outdoor Classic, the Whale Bowl, held at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Connecticut. Connecticut fell to the Providence Bruins, 5–4, in a shootout.

In June 2012, after just 21 months, the New York Rangers terminated their business relationship with Baldwin after he and his company ran up a debt of almost $3 million and had about 15 court cases against him.

In April 2013, just two and a half seasons after rebranding as the Whale, the team decided it would revert to the nickname &quot;Wolf Pack&quot; for the following season. Global Spectrum, the group now marketing the team and managers of the XL Center arena, announced in May 2013 that the franchise had officially returned to the Hartford Wolf Pack identity.

Although the Wolf Pack does not officially acknowledge its past in Providence and Binghamton (or claim the Reds&#x27; four Calder Cups), it is the only AHL franchise to have never missed a season since the league&#x27;s founding in 1936. In one form or another, the franchise has iced a team every year since 1926. The Wolf Pack and Abbotsford Canucks — the descendants of another charter AHL member, the Springfield Indians — are the oldest minor-league hockey franchises in North America. However, the Indians were inactive for three seasons in the 1930s, making the Wolf Pack the oldest continuously operating minor-league hockey franchise in North America. The only professional hockey franchises older than the Wolf Pack and the Canucks are the NHL&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins.

==Team information==

===Mascots===
The Wolf Pack started in 1997 with one mascot, a wolf named Sonar. The name was chosen to keep with the submarine theme that the team had used in their naming and logo. Following the folding of their sister team, the Arena Football League&#x27;s New England Sea Wolves, the Wolf Pack added the Sea Wolves&#x27; mascot, named Torpedo; this mascot has since been retired. In 2010, with the renaming of the team to the Connecticut Whale, Sonar was joined as a mascot by former Whalers mascot Pucky the Whale. Sonar took the 2012–13 season off while Pucky was the sole mascot. When the naming arrangement ended, Sonar came back while Pucky was retired. Dan Unger is the mascot of the fans.

<text>The Providence Bruins are a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League (AHL), and are the primary development team for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). They play at the Amica Mutual Pavilion in Providence, Rhode Island.

==History==
The Providence Bruins began operation for the start of the 1992–93 AHL season after Providence mayor Buddy Cianci negotiated a deal with the owners of the Maine Mariners franchise, Frank DuRoss and Ed Anderson, to relocate their club. The move saw AHL hockey return to Providence for the first time since the Providence Reds, a founding member of the AHL, left town in 1977.

The Bruins captured their first AHL Calder Cup in the 1999 playoffs, after a regular season in which they dominated the league with 56 regular season wins. Led by rookie head coach Peter Laviolette and paced by Les Cunningham Award winner Randy Robitaille, the Bruins went from only 19 victories the previous season, to dropping the Rochester Americans four games to one to skate away with the league championship.

In the 2001–02 season, the Providence Bruins contracted with then-13-year-old musician Ben Schwartz to work as the official organist at all home games. As a result, Schwartz, who provided music for seven years until the conclusion of the 2007–08 season, is the youngest organist to ever work for a professional North American sports franchise.

In August 2006, DuRoss sold his majority interest in the club to Massachusetts businessman H. Larue Renfroe.

After the 2019–20 season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bruins moved to a temporary home in the New England Sports Center in Marlborough, Massachusetts, as the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Center was being used by the state of Rhode Island for pandemic-related operations. The New England Sport Center is also owned by team owner H. Larue Renfroe. The Bruins returned to the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Center for the 2021–22 AHL season.

In September 2022, the home arena was renamed to Amica Mutual Pavilion. 

;This market was previously served by:

==Team mascot==
&quot;Samboni&quot; the anthropomorphic bear serves as the Bruins&#x27; team mascot similar to the Boston Bruins&#x27; &quot;Blades the Bruin&quot;.

<text>The Lowell Devils were a minor league ice hockey team in the American Hockey League playing in Lowell, Massachusetts, at the Tsongas Center. As their name implied, they were the top minor league affiliate of the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League. The team was founded in 1998 as the Lowell Lock Monsters and was purchased by the Devils in 2006.

After the 2009–10 season, the Devils agreed to move the Lowell franchise to Albany, New York, where their previous AHL affiliate, the Albany River Rats, had played. The new team then became the Albany Devils.

==History==
Founded as the Lowell Lock Monsters in 1998, the team served as the top AHL affiliate of the New York Islanders for three seasons, the last of which was shared with the Los Angeles Kings. In 2001, the team became the AHL affiliate of the Carolina Hurricanes, serving in that capacity for five seasons, portions of which the affiliation was shared with the Calgary Flames and Colorado Avalanche.

The team was purchased by the New Jersey Devils in 2006 and took the Devils&#x27; name for the start of the 2006–07 season. In effect, the Devils&#x27; move was an affiliate swap as the Hurricanes contracted with the Devils&#x27; former affiliate in Albany. In Lowell, the Devils averaged 2,293 fans per game during the 2008–09 season while receiving the AHL Excellence Award for the Eastern Conference for group sales.

In February 2010, the University of Massachusetts Lowell took ownership of the Tsongas Center from the City of Lowell. Negotiations began between the University and the Devils for a lease extension, with the current lease set to expire at the end of the 2009–10 season. They could not come to an agreement and the Devils explored other options. They eventually struck an agreement with Albany, who was to lose the River Rats after the Hurricanes elected to move their top minor league affiliate to Charlotte, North Carolina, as the Charlotte Checkers. Following the season, the Lowell Devils ceased to exist.

<text>The Springfield Falcons were a former ice hockey team in the American Hockey League (AHL) and played in Springfield, Massachusetts, at the MassMutual Center.

In 2016, the Falcons&#x27; franchise was purchased by the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s Arizona Coyotes and relocated to Tucson, Arizona, before the start of the 2016–17 AHL season.

==History==

===Beginning===

In 1994, the longtime AHL Springfield Indians team was sold to interests that moved the franchise to Worcester, Massachusetts, to become the Worcester IceCats (now the Abbotsford Canucks). Ex-Indian players Bruce Landon, then the general manager of the Indians, and Wayne LaChance, a local rink owner and former member of the Springfield Kings, secured an expansion franchise for Springfield for the 1994–95 season. The Indians name was still under trademark, so the new owners named the team after Andy and Amelia, a pair of nesting peregrine falcons that was a popular local civic symbol. The AHL, which was headquartered in nearby West Springfield, was keen to maintain a presence in a city that had hosted a team in the AHL or its predecessors for all but nine years since 1926, and readily granted an expansion franchise to Landon and LaChance.

The Falcons secured affiliation with both the Hartford Whalers and the Winnipeg Jets of the NHL. Since the Indians had been the Whalers&#x27; top affiliate in their last few years, this allowed the Falcons to secure most of the players who had played for the Indians the previous season. Veteran defenseman John Stevens (the last captain of the Indians, who shared the co-captaincy that first year with Rob Murray) scored the franchise&#x27;s first goal.
Among the Falcons&#x27; early notable players were Jean-Guy Trudel, the franchise&#x27;s leading career goal and point scorer; Daniel Briere of the Colorado Avalanche; Manny Legace, the franchise&#x27;s all-time leading goaltender and former St. Louis Blues starter; Nikolai Khabibulin, former Stanley Cup winning goalie; and Rob Murray, the franchise&#x27;s long-time captain and inspirational leader. During the 2004 season, Springfield fans voted on the Web for the club&#x27;s 10th Anniversary Team, and selected Briere at center, Trudel at left wing, Tavis Hansen at right wing, Brad Tiley and Dan Focht on defense and Legace in goal.

Individual honors won by Falcons players during their first thirteen seasons included the Baz Bastien Award given to the league&#x27;s best goaltender (to Legace in 1996 and Scott Langkow in 1998), Briere winning the Red Garrett Award emblematic of rookie of the year and a nod as First Team All-Star center in 1998, Tiley winning the Eddie Shore Award for the league&#x27;s outstanding defenseman in 2000 and Trudel winning a Second Team All-Star award in 1999–00.

After the Whalers relocated to become the Carolina Hurricanes, the Falcons were subsequently affiliated exclusively with the Jets, an affiliation that continued when that team became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996. The team was then affiliated with the Tampa Bay Lightning between 2004 and 2007.

The team had finished in first place in its division twice and made the playoffs six times in its first nine seasons. However, after three seasons affiliated with Tampa Bay and nine straight losing seasons, the team announced that it was exercising its option to sever relations with the Lightning. On March 19, 2007, they announced an affiliation with the Edmonton Oilers beginning in the 2007–08 season until the conclusion of the 2009–10 season.

===Edmonton Oilers affiliation===
On August 3, 2007, the team hired former Edmonton Oilers player Kelly Buchberger to be the head coach. After posting a .500 record, the Oilers promoted Buchberger to be an assistant coach on the Oilers staff. On June 17, 2008, assistant coach Jeff Truitt was named the team&#x27;s tenth head coach. He was fired in February 2009, after 50 games, and replaced by former Houston Aeros coach Rob Daum. The Falcons finished the 2008–09 season with the worst record in the AHL.

On June 23, 2009, Oilers general manager Steve Tambellini announced that Daum would remain the head coach of the Springfield Falcons through the 2009–10 season. From November 25 to January 1, the Falcons went on a franchise record 17-game losing streak, recording only five points in that span. The Falcons finished the 2009–10 season as the worst team in the AHL once again, and was the only team that did not win at least 30 games. The lone bright spot from the season was Charles Linglet being named a Second Team All-Star.

On February 9, 2010, the Edmonton Oilers announced that they were severing ties with the Springfield Falcons to move their affiliation to Oklahoma City, a decision that had been expected for months.

===Columbus Blue Jackets affiliation===
On March 25, 2010, the Columbus Blue Jackets announced a one-year affiliation agreement with a one-year option. Also introduced was a and logo. The new logo still had a falcon holding a hockey stick, but the background was changed to grey, the word Falcons to red, and the word Springfield to navy blue. The new ECHL affiliation was with the Evansville IceMen.

Rob Riley, the former head coach at the United States Military Academy, was named the new head coach of the Falcons on August 3, 2010, replacing Daum. The Falcons opened the 2010–11 AHL season with a home-and-home matchup against the Providence Bruins. To honor the 75th anniversary of the AHL, each team wore throwback jerseys from 1936. The Bruins wore the jerseys of the Providence Reds while the Falcons wore the jerseys of the Springfield Indians. The Falcons won the first game in Providence 5–1, while the Bruins took the following game in Springfield 6–5.

On December 21, 2010, it was announced that the Falcons had been sold to Charlie Pompea, while Bruce Landon remained the minority owner, and continued to be the president/general manager.

During the 2011–12 season, the Falcons honored the Springfield hockey teams that had won the Calder Cup, wearing commemorative jerseys for those games, and honoring former coaches and players in pre-game festivities. Following the season, Rob Riley was fired as head coach after two seasons of missing the playoffs. Assistant coach Brad Larsen was named head coach for the 2012–13 season.

The 2012–13 season, beginning with the 2012–13 NHL lockout, saw the Falcons make the playoffs for the first time since 2003. With help of NHL players Matt Calvert, Cam Atkinson, Ryan Johansen, John Moore and Tim Erixon, the Falcons were able to take an early lead in both the Northeast Division and the Eastern Conference. When the NHL lockout ended and these players were called up to Columbus, the Falcons continued to stay at the top of the standings. All-Star play from goaltender Curtis McElhinney and forward Jonathan Marchessault, as well as veteran leadership from team captain Ryan Craig, helped guide the team to a first-place finish in the Northeast Division. On April 6, 2013, the Falcons qualified for the 2013 Calder Cup playoffs, ending a nine-year playoff drought, the longest in AHL history. The Falcons defeated the Manchester Monarchs in the first round three games to one, with all of their wins coming in overtime. The Falcons playoff run came to an end at the hands of the Syracuse Crunch, as the Crunch swept the Falcons out of the playoffs in their second round matchup. Winger Jonathan Marchessault was named to the First All-Star team, while goaltender Curtis McElhinney was named a Second Team All-Star.

The 2013–14 Falcons set a team record for wins (47) and points (100). They suffered a first round defeat in the playoffs at the hands of the Providence Bruins in five games.

On February 4, 2014, the Springfield Falcons announced that Bruce Landon would be retiring. Landon had served as president, general manager and co-owner since 1994. He remained with the team as director of hockey operations. Sarah Pompea, the daughter of owner Charlie Pompea, was named the new team president.

While it was initially announced that the entire coaching staff would return to Springfield for the 2014–15 season, head coach Brad Larsen was promoted to an assistant coach in Columbus. On June 16, 2014, Columbus announced that Jared Bednar would become head coach and he continued to be joined by assistant coach Nolan Pratt, in addition to first year assistant Toby Petersen. In the 2014–15 season, the team set a franchise record with 11 consecutive wins. The streak lasted from November 14 through December 6, and propelled the Falcons back into first place in the Northeast Division. However, a poor March cost the team as they missed the playoffs, finishing in ninth place in the Eastern Conference.

===Arizona Coyotes affiliation===
On April 17, 2015, the Springfield Falcons and Arizona Coyotes announced that they had reached a three-year affiliation agreement. This was part of change of affiliations for the 2015–16 season where Columbus would have their AHL team in Cleveland, the Colorado Avalanche in San Antonio and the Florida Panthers would be tied to the Portland Pirates.

The Coyotes hired Ron Rolston as the team&#x27;s head coach, with Doug Janik and Mike Bavis as his assistants for the 2015–16 season. Dustin Jeffrey was named a Second Team All-Star, although he finished the season with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins after being traded at the trade deadline. The season was one of the worst in franchise history and marked the 11th time in 13 seasons that the club missed the playoffs, finishing with the second lowest points percentage in the AHL and the most regulation losses.

On April 19, 2016, the Arizona Coyotes signed an agreement to purchase the team. The Coyotes had been in negotiations to relocate the franchise to Tucson, Arizona, for the 2016–17 season and join the other AHL Pacific Division teams created in the previous season.

On May 4, 2016, the Portland Pirates announced that it had signed a letter of intent with an outside buyer to sell and relocate the franchise for the 2016–17 season. It was reported that the team would be relocated to Springfield following the pending sale and relocation of the Falcons franchise.

The AHL Board of Governors conditionally approved of the sale and relocation of the Falcons on May 10, pending approval of a deal through Tucson&#x27;s city council. On May 17, the Coyotes and the Tucson city council came to terms on a lease agreement for the 2016–17 season to meet the conditions of the AHL approval. The team became the Tucson Roadrunners. The Pirates&#x27; sale and relocation to Springfield was approved on May 23, to subsequently become the Springfield Thunderbirds.

<text>The Manchester Monarchs were a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League (AHL). They played in Manchester, New Hampshire, at the SNHU Arena. They were the AHL affiliate of the National Hockey League (NHL) Los Angeles Kings during the team&#x27;s entire existence. The Monarchs won their only Calder Cup in their final AHL season.

For the 2015–16 season, the Monarchs traded places with the Kings&#x27; affiliate in the ECHL, the Ontario Reign. The AHL franchise moved to Ontario, California, and play at Citizens Business Bank Arena where they became the new Ontario Reign; the ECHL team moved to New Hampshire retaining the Manchester Monarchs name.

==History==
In 1999, Howard Baldwin founded Manchester Hockey Group LLC, while in the process of moving a dormant AHL franchise to New Hampshire to start play in 2001. On June 14, 2000, the Los Angeles Kings bought the team from Baldwin&#x27;s group. Three months later, the Kings hired Jeff Eisenberg as team president. The team, to play in the still under construction Verizon Wireless Arena, was baptized Manchester Monarchs on November 13.

Prior to the first game, two members of the Kings organization, Garnet Bailey and Mark Bavis, were killed in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as they were going home back to Los Angeles after a scouting trip. The Monarchs played their first game on October 6, 2001, against the Lowell Lock Monsters, losing 6–3. Their first win was a week later, on October 13, against the Norfolk Admirals. The team has been competitive within the division every year of its existence. They won their first Atlantic Division title in 2004–05, but lost in the first round to the Providence Bruins. This continued the streak of first round playoff exits, which the team had experienced in every year of existence, and would come to include the 2005–06 season.

The 2006–07 campaign was the team&#x27;s best season prior to 2014–15, the season in which the team won its only Calder Cup championship. With rookie head coach Mark Morris, leading scorers Matt Moulson and Noah Clarke, and former League MVP Jason LaBarbera in goal, the team had their best-ever finish, winning the Atlantic Division title with the second-best points total in the League.

Heading into the playoffs, there were doubts within the team, as goaltender LaBarbera had ended the season injured. The team faced the Worcester Sharks in the first round. With LaBarbera coming back by Game 2, the Monarchs defeated the Sharks in six games, including double-overtime thrillers in Games 2 and 6. The second round brought the Providence Bruins, who put up as much, if not more, of a fight. The Monarchs found a way, however, and defeated the Bruins in six games. This brought the Monarchs to their first ever Eastern Conference Finals, but they were swept by the defending champions, the Hershey Bears, in four games.

Following their run in 2007, the Monarchs looked to have holes to fill, as Jason LaBarbera was called up to the Kings, along with several other players. The 2007–08 season was an up-and-down one, which ended following a sweep by the Providence Bruins in the first round of the playoffs. The 2008–09 season was a landmark year for the franchise, but not in the way they would hope. Despite a late surge, the team finished fifth, five points out of the playoffs, for the first time in franchise history.

The first half of the 2009–10 season proved to be successful for the Monarchs squad. Several players were promoted to Los Angeles, including Richard Clune and Alec Martinez. The Monarchs won their home opener of the 2010–11 season, as David Meckler scored the game-winning goal in front of 9,035 fans at the Verizon Wireless Arena on October 16, 2010. The game was also noteworthy as left wing Brandon Kozun and center Justin Azevedo were awarded penalty shots, the first time in franchise history that two players were awarded penalty shots in the same game.

The Manchester Monarchs have made it to the playoffs all but one season since coming into existence, winning their first Calder Cup following the 2014–15 season.

For the 2014–15 season, the Monarchs ditched their purple and gold (the former Los Angeles Kings&#x27; colors) that had been with the team since its inception, and adopted the same black and silver color scheme that the Kings have used since 2011.

On January 29, 2015, it was confirmed by the AHL via press conference that the Monarchs would relocate from Manchester, New Hampshire, to Ontario, California. In return, the Ontario Reign of the ECHL would move to Manchester to become the new ECHL Manchester Monarchs, the first ECHL team to play in New England. The Monarchs finished the regular season winning the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy with the best regular season record of the AHL and Brian O&#x27;Neill receiving the Les Cunningham Award as Most Valuable Player. The playoffs saw the Monarchs losing only three games among the Eastern teams, leading to the team&#x27;s first Richard F. Canning Trophy as conference champions to qualify for the Calder Cup Final. The Monarchs beat the Utica Comets 4–1 to win the Calder Cup in their final season in New Hampshire. They became the first team since the New Brunswick Hawks in 1982 to win the Calder Cup in their last game of existence, and fourth overall (along with the Pittsburgh Hornets in 1967 and the Buffalo Bisons in 1970).

<text>Plesiosaurus (Greek: &#x27; (&#x27;), near to + &#x27; (&#x27;), lizard) is a genus of extinct, large marine sauropterygian reptile that lived during the Early Jurassic. It is known by nearly complete skeletons from the Lias of England. It is distinguishable by its small head, long and slender neck, broad turtle-like body, a short tail, and two pairs of large, elongated paddles. It lends its name to the order Plesiosauria, of which it is an early, but fairly typical member. It contains only one species, the type, Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus. Other species once assigned to this genus, including &quot;P. brachypterygius&quot;, &quot;P. guilielmiimperatoris&quot;, and &quot;P. tournemirensis&quot; have been reassigned to new genera, such as &quot;Hydrorion&quot;, &quot;Seeleyosaurus&quot; and &quot;Microcleidus&quot;.

==Discovery==


The first complete skeleton of &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; was discovered by early paleontologist and fossil hunter Mary Anning in Sinemurian (Early Jurassic)-age rocks of the lower Lias Group in December 1823. Additional fossils of &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; were found in rocks of the Lias Group of Dorset for many years, &quot;until the cessation of quarrying activities in the Lias Group, early in this [20th] century.&quot; although less complete remains were used by Henry De la Beche and William Conybeare to name the species two years earlier in 1821, and despite being discovered first, Conybeare&#x27;s remains were not the holotype; Anning&#x27;s were.

&quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; was one of the first of the &quot;antediluvian reptiles&quot; to be discovered and excited great interest in 19th-century England. It was so-named (&quot;near lizard&quot;) by William Conybeare and Henry De la Beche, to indicate that it was more like a normal reptile than &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot;, which had been found in the same rock strata just a few years earlier. &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; is the archetypical genus of Plesiosauria and the first to be described, hence lending its name to the order. Conybeare and De la Beche coined the name for scattered finds from the Bristol region, Dorset, and Lyme Regis in 1821. The type species of &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot;, &quot;P. dolichodeirus&quot;, was named and described by Conybeare in 1824 on the basis of Anning&#x27;s original finds.

==Description==
===Skull and dentition===
Compared to other plesiosaur genera, &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; has a small head. The skull is much narrower than long, reaching its greatest width just behind the eyes (the postorbital bar). The anterior portion is &quot;bluntly triangular&quot;. In lateral view, the skull reaches its highest point at the rear of the skull table. &quot;The external nostrils overlie the internal nares&quot;. They are not positioned at the tip of the snout, but farther back, nearer the eyes than the tip of the skull. Unlike the nostrils of &quot;Rhomaleosaurus&quot;, they do not appear to be adapted for underwater olfaction. The orbits (eye sockets) are roughly circular and are positioned about halfway along the length of the skull. They face up and to the sides. Just posterior to the orbits are the supratemporal fenestrae, which are about the same size as the orbits and also roughly circular. Between the four openings is the pineal foramen, and between the temporal fenestrae is a narrow sagittal ridge. As in other plesiosaurs, the pterygoids of the palate are fused to the basioccipital of the braincase, although the union is not as robust as in the pliosaurs &quot;Rhomaleosaurus&quot; and &quot;Pliosaurus&quot;. &quot;The palatal bones are thin, but there is no suborbital fenestra.&quot;

The two rami of the lower jaw make a &quot;V&quot; shape with an angle of about 45°. The specialized region where they meet, the symphysis, is robust. The two rami are fused at the symphysis, making a pointed, shallow scoop-like shape.

The teeth of &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; are &quot;simple, needle-like cones&quot; that are &quot;slightly curved and circular in transverse section&quot;. They are sharply pointed with fine striations running from tip to base, and point forward (procumbent). This procumbency becomes more pronounced near the leading end of the skull, where they may be only 10–15° above horizontal. There are 20 to 25 teeth per upper jaw tooth row, and 24 per low jaw tooth row. Up to four teeth of a lower jaw&#x27;s tooth row are found in the symphyseal region.

===Vertebral column===

&quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; was a moderately sized plesiosaur that grew to in length. There are approximately 40 cervical vertebrae (neck vertebrae), with different specimens preserving 38 to 42 cervical vertebrae. Of the rest of the vertebral column, there are a handful (four or five in the holotype specimen) of &quot;pectoral&quot; vertebrae from the neck-torso transition, approximately 21 dorsal or back vertebrae, three or more sacral vertebrae, and at least 28 caudal vertebrae. Generally, the centra of the cervical vertebrae are relatively elongated, being slightly longer than tall. The width, however, is usually greater than or equal to the length. The articular surfaces of the cervical centra are &quot;slightly concave and kidney-shaped, with rounded, slightly rugose edges.&quot; Small holes called foramina subcentralia are found on the ventral surface of the centra. Some of the dorsals have rugose articular edges, like the cervicals; this feature is typically absent from the caudals.

Ribs are found from the neck to the tail. Cervical ribs are hatchet-shaped and have two articular heads. Dorsal ribs are thick and have only one head. Sacral ribs are &quot;short, robust, and blunt or knob-like on both ends.&quot; Caudal ribs have different morphologies depending on their location along the tail, with anterior examples being pointed and more distal examples being &quot;broad and blunt.&quot; &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; also has gastralia, also known as &quot;belly ribs.&quot; Nine or more sets of gastralia are present between the shoulder and pelvis. Each set is composed of seven elements: a bone on the midline flanked by three lateral elements.

===Limbs===
The shoulder girdle is only partly known but appears to be typical for plesiosaurs. It includes fused clavicles at the anterior end, scapulae (shoulder blades), and large coracoids. The scapulae and coracoids both contribute to the glenoids (arm sockets). A pair of oval holes called pectoral fenestrae are found midway along the scapular/coracoid contacts. The forelimbs are elongate and relatively narrow compared to those of most plesiosaurs. The humerus (upper arm bone) has distinctive curvature, which appears to be a retained primitive feature among sauropterygians. Mature &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; also have a distinctive groove along the ventral surface of the humerus. The forearm includes a flat, broad, crescent-shaped ulna and a &quot;robust and pillar-like&quot; radius. The wrist includes six bones. The hand paddle has five digits; the phalangeal formula is uncertain, but the count for one large individual, from &quot;thumb&quot; to fifth &quot;finger&quot;, is 4-8-9-8-6.

The pelvis includes equant pubic bones, ischia, and blade-shaped ilia connecting the pelvis to the vertebral column. The acetabulum is formed by surfaces on the pubic bones and ischia. Similar to the pectoral girdle, there is a pair of holes between the ischia and pubic bones. The hindlimbs are long and narrow, and in adults, they are much smaller than the forelimbs. The thigh bones are straight. The lower hindlimb includes two roughly equal-sized bones, the robust tibia and the semilunate-shaped fibula. There are six bones in the ankle. The foot paddle includes five digits. Like the hand, the phalangeal formula is uncertain, but is at least 3-7-9-8-7 from innermost to outer &quot;toe&quot;.

==Classifications==
 
&quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; has historically been a wastebasket taxon. This is due in part to few anatomical or taxonomic studies of the relevant fossils. Uncritical taxonomic work resulted in hundreds of species representing most of the world and most of the Mesozoic being assigned to &quot;Plesiosaurus.&quot; None of the younger Jurassic or Cretaceous species belong to &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot;. Review of the Early Jurassic species indicates that the only English species properly assigned to &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; is &quot;P. dolichodeirus&quot;. Several other European Early Jurassic species have been assigned to new genera. &quot;P. brachypterygius&quot;, &quot;P. guilielmiimperatoris&quot; and &quot;P. tournemirensis&quot;, for example, were assigned to the new genera &quot;Hydrorion&quot;, &quot;Seeleyosaurus&quot; and &quot;Occitanosaurus&quot;.

The following cladogram follows an analysis by Benson &quot;et al.&quot;, 2012, and shows the placement of &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; within Plesiosauria.

==Palaeobiology==

&quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; fed mainly on clams and snails, and is thought to have eaten belemnites, fish and other prey as well. Its U-shaped jaw and sharp teeth would have been like a fish trap. It propelled itself by the paddles, the tail being too short to be of much use. Its neck could have been used as a rudder when navigating during a chase. &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; gave live birth to live young in the water like most sea snakes. The young might have lived in estuaries before moving out into the open ocean.
It has been postulated that the long neck of &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; would have been a hindrance when trying to speed up, any bend in the neck creating turbulences. If that is the case then &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; would have had to keep its neck straight to achieve good acceleration, something that would make hunting difficult. For this reason it may be possible that these animals would actually lie in wait for prey to come close instead of trying to pursue them.

==Palaeoenvironment==
Unequivocal specimens of &quot;Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus&quot; are limited to the Lyme Regis area of Dorset. It appears to be the most common species of plesiosaur in the Lias Group of England. &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; is best represented from the &quot;upper part of the Blue Lias, the &#x27;Shales with Beef,&#x27; and the lower Black Ven Marls&quot; the latter of which form part of the Charmouth Mudstone; using the Lias Group ammonite fossil zones, these rocks date to the early Sinemurian stage. Some other &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; fossils are from later Sinemurian rocks. The oldest specimen may be a skull thought to come from late Rhaetian or early Hettangian rocks.

<text>Christmas with the Kranks is a 2004 American Christmas comedy film directed by Joe Roth from a screenplay by Chris Columbus, and starring Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dan Aykroyd, Erik Per Sullivan, Cheech Marin, Jake Busey, and M. Emmet Walsh. Based on the 2001 novel &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; by John Grisham, it follows a middle-aged couple who, much to the chagrin of their neighbors, decide to forgo their Christmas celebrations after their daughter leaves for the Peace Corps until she unexpectedly decides to return home for the holidays.

&quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; was released in the United States on November 24, 2004 by Columbia Pictures. The film was a moderate box-office success, grossing over $96 million internationally, though it received largely unfavorable reviews from critics. Retrospectively, it has received positive reviews from some of Tim Allen&#x27;s fans.

==Plot==
After Riverside, Illinois couple Luther and Nora Krank see their daughter Blair depart for a Peace Corps assignment in Peru on the Sunday following Thanksgiving, empty nest syndrome sets in. Luther calculates that they spent $6,132 during the previous year&#x27;s holiday season, and, not looking forward to celebrating Christmas without their daughter, he suggests they invest the money usually spent on decorations, gifts, and entertainment and treat themselves to a ten-day Caribbean cruise instead. Luther insists that they completely boycott the holidays but Nora initially objects. She eventually agrees after convincing Luther to at least donate to local charities as they do every year.

The Kranks discover they are considered pariahs due to their decision to skip the holidays. Most vocal in their objections are neighbors Vic Frohmeyer and Walt Scheel. Vic, the self-proclaimed leader of the street, organizes a campaign to force the Kranks to decorate their home. Walt does not seem to like Luther, so his efforts are primarily personal. However, it is revealed that Walt&#x27;s wife Bev is suffering from cancer, perhaps dampening his holiday spirits.

Children, led by Vic&#x27;s son Spike, constantly push them to put up a Frosty the Snowman decoration, and Christmas carolers try to revive the Kranks&#x27; holiday spirit by singing on their lawn, which Luther stops by icing it. The newspaper prints a front-page story complete with a photograph of the unlit Krank house, and Luther&#x27;s office colleagues, scout tree salesmen, and police fund collectors are also annoyed. However, Luther and Nora continue to stand their ground.

The couple are packing for the cruise on Christmas Eve morning when they receive a call from Blair, who announces that she is at Miami International Airport, en route home with her Peruvian fiancé Enrique as a surprise for her parents. When Blair asks if they are having their usual party that night, a panicked Nora says yes. Luther and Nora try to decorate the house and coordinate a party with only twelve hours before their daughter and future son-in-law arrive.

While Nora scrambles to find food, Luther goes to buy a tree but is unable to get anything but a small, dried-up tree. Luther attempts to borrow the indoor tree of neighbor Wes Trogdon, who is going away for a week, with the warning that he is not to damage it. Luther enlists Spike&#x27;s help to transport the tree across the street, but the neighbors spot him and, assuming he is stealing it, call the police. Spike shows that Luther has Trogdon&#x27;s keys, and thus was given permission to borrow the tree. Nora comes home, having only been able to obtain smoked trout, and tells Luther to put up Frosty on their roof, which fails when he and Frosty fall off, drawing the neighborhood&#x27;s attention. Once it is established why Luther is trying frantically to decorate his home, the neighbors, led by Vic, come out in full force to help them ready it for Blair.

The party starts off strong, with Blair having no idea of the earlier drama. Enrique thanks everyone for the warm welcome, and Nora thanks her neighbors for being a strong community. Luther, to everyone&#x27;s disappointment, offers only a half-hearted toast. When Nora confronts Luther, he tries to convince her to still go on the cruise, but Nora refuses, disgusted that he is not happy that Blair is home.

Having a change of heart, Luther slips out of the house, going across the street to the Scheel&#x27;s. Bev&#x27;s cancer, once in remission, has returned. Knowing this may be their last holiday together, Luther insists they take the cruise instead, even offering to look after their cat, to allow them to go. At first, Walt and Bev decline, but ultimately decide to accept his generosity. With his holiday spirit renewed, Luther finally admits to Nora that skipping Christmas was not a good idea until she suggests they should do it next year.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Joe Roth knew about John Grisham&#x27;s &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; before it was published in 2001. He was asked by Grisham to read the book in galley form, assuming he could direct a movie based on it. Roth recalls: &quot;It turns out he was right. Even while I was reading it, all I could think was that this would make a great Christmas movie. It had humor, it had wonderful characters and it had heart.&quot; With the rights of the book received and the May 2000 founding of Revolution Studios, he stated that &quot;as a start-up company, there was a great deal of work to do in order to get up and running.&quot;

Later, filmmaker Chris Columbus, who also bought the rights to &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; and had written a screenplay, called Roth about directing the adaptation. As Roth explains: &quot;Naturally, I thought he was going to direct it. But he said, &#x27;No, you should direct it.&#x27; It turns out I was getting ready to direct another project. But when I read Chris&#x27;s script, I knew I had to at least try to direct it. I promised myself that if I could get the right cast in place, I would do it.&quot; Producer Michael Barnathan said, &quot;Joe read the script on a Sunday, bought it on Monday, decided he wanted to direct it on Tuesday and by Friday had cast Tim [Allen] and Jamie Lee [Curtis]. The following Monday morning we started pre-production.&quot;

===Setting===
&quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; takes place mostly in the Kranks&#x27; neighborhood of Hemlock Street in Riverside, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, over the course of four weeks from Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve. Production designer Garreth Stover originally looked for locations with the right weather conditions and suburban ambiance for Hemlock Street, as described specifically in Columbus&#x27;s script of the film. He was scouting from the metropolitan area of Chicago to Minnesota, but due to the extreme conditions of this part of the United States at the time, the filmmakers felt it was better to set up the neighborhood in an empty location instead of finding one.

When looking for a place to build the set 15 weeks before filming began, Stover chose a parking lot of a former Boeing aircraft factory in Downey, California, approximately away from downtown Los Angeles and in the midst of Downey Studios. The rest of the first three weeks were spent on designing the houses with assistance from construction coordinator David Elliott. In the next 12 weeks, hundreds of carpenters, plasterers, and painters had built what would become the largest exterior set ever for a movie, being more than long and including 16 houses. What Stover called &quot;the core five&quot; were the houses of the Kranks, the Frohmeyers, the Scheels, the Beckers, and the Trogdons, which he claimed had &quot;full ground floors that are dressed and you can see into.&quot; He also said that the second floor of the Kranks&#x27; was built on a soundstage. Producer Michael Barnathan claimed that the set would later be available for other movies, TV series and commercials to use. However, due to both health complaints from the locals over toxic residues and a lack of profit, the studio closed in 2012 and was razed to build a mall.

The scenes involving Nora Krank&#x27;s excursion to the supermarket to procure a &quot;Mel&#x27;s Hickory Honey Ham&quot; were filmed at Cordons Ranch Market, located at 2931 Honolulu Ave, Glendale, California.

===Costumes===
Susie DeSanto handled the costume design of &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot;. According to DeSanto, &quot;I was looking for a project that was really textural, and maybe a bit nostalgic. I saw &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; like a Christmas card, a beautiful Christmas memory of how we wish the holiday to be. So a lot of the fabrics I chose were not so much high-tech bright colors, but wools, plaids and mixing patterns. Joe [Roth] was specific about what he wanted, but within that, he allowed me a great deal of freedom to express myself. However, he did not have any impute on the tan segment of the movie where Luthor and Nora Krank were wearing colourful underwear to look their best for the cruise&quot;

DeSanto viewed that all the characters in &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; would wear costumes that are supposed to serve as their &quot;accents&quot; rather than overtly defining them. Luther Krank is seen wearing the same-colored shirt and suit at work all the time, and according to DeSanto, this &quot;tells that Luther&#x27;s a punch-the-clock kind of guy, so the whole idea of skipping Christmas and going off on a tropical vacation is completely averse to anything he&#x27;s ever done.&quot; She described Nora as &quot;tasteful and kind of folksy, a middle-American woman approaching middle age. In our first meeting, Jamie Lee Curtis was totally prepared. She wanted to look like a real Midwestern woman who lives in the suburbs of Chicago and is as obsessed with Christmas as everyone around her. Nora dresses for the seasons and I found out by speaking to people at Marshall Field&#x27;s in Chicago that the Christmas sweater is a big deal. And Jamie wears it so well.&quot; As for Vic Frohmeyer, she saw him as &quot;a sort of commander-in-chief of the neighborhood, so I wanted something with a bit of a military flair. Since he&#x27;s also a college professor, we cut the pattern from a general&#x27;s jacket and made it professorial by using a vintage tweed mixed with corduroy.&quot;

===Music===
The soundtrack was produced and supervised by American musician Steven Van Zandt, who arranged and produced 6 of the tracks. It features many holiday standards, including &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; by Brenda Lee; &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; by Billy May &amp; His Orchestra with vocal by Alvin Stoller; &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; by Eddie Dunstedter; &quot;White Christmas&quot; by Dean Martin; &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; by Steve Van Zandt; &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; by Elvis Presley; and &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; by Ella Fitzgerald.

It received generally favorable reviews, with many critics appreciating the use of garage rock as a &quot;fresh take&quot; on Christmas music. &quot;Houston Press&quot; featured it on their list of top 10 Christmas movie soundtracks.

==Release==
The film premiered theatrically in the United States on November 24, 2004, the day before Thanksgiving.

===Home media===
&quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on March 8, 2005, and on UMD Video for PSP on November 8, 2005. It was released on November 14, 2005, in the UK. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment later released the film on Blu-ray on November 16, 2021.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; was a moderate box-office success. On its opening weekend, it earned $21.6 million on 3,393 screens, ranking number three behind &quot;National Treasure&quot; and &quot;The Incredibles&quot;. It eventually grossed $96.6 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
 It is the second-worst reviewed Christmas movie on the site, behind &quot;The Nutcracker in 3D&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 22 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film one out of four stars, calling it &quot;a holiday movie of stunning awfulness that gets even worse when it turns gooey at the end.&quot; Nell Minow of Common Sense Media gave the film 1/5 stars, writing: &quot;The characters are unpleasant, the jokes are unfunny, and the sentiment is hypocritical -- so this movie is about as unappetizing as last year&#x27;s figgy pudding.&quot; Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Christmas With the Kranks&quot; is a leaden whimsy so heavy it threatens to crash through the multiplex floor.&quot; Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote: &quot;You will not want to spend Christmas, or any other day of the year, with the Kranks. Or, for that matter, in the company of their uncommonly nosy, self-righteous and meddling friends and neighbors.&quot;

Scott Foundas of &quot;Variety&quot; was more positive, calling it &quot;an agreeable, if snowflake-thin stocking stuffer faithfully adapted from John Grisham&#x27;s 2001 bestseller &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;.&quot;

===Retrospective assessment===
In a retrospective review, Kayla Turner of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; heralded the film as an &quot;underappreciated modern Christmas classic&quot; and a &quot;hilarious satire on the madness of societal Christmas expectations and a relatable look at exhaustion from those stressful obligations. Though on the surface it may seem familiar, underneath is an artful blend of timely humor and a heartwarming messaging about the importance of connection over commercialism.&quot;

Alex Maidy, writing for &quot;JoBlo.com&quot; in 2018, conceded that the film has a &quot;thin&quot; plot, but praised it for its strong elements of slapstick humor and performances, summarizing it as &quot;over-the-top, silly, bizarre, cheesy, goofy, and sentimental. It is also a movie that you cannot help but laugh at. Not because it is bad but because it is trying to mock the overly-commercialized Christmas season while simultaneously begging you to partake in the silliness.&quot;

<text>The publishing house Passagen Verlag was founded in 1985 in Vienna by Peter Engelmann. The primary intention of the publisher was the translation of Jacques Derrida&#x27;s work into German. Around the author Derrida, Peter Engelmann developed a program, which gathers relevant authors of all disciplines, who identified themselves with the program deconstruction (&quot;Dekonstruktivismus&quot;) and &quot;postmodernism&quot; (Postmoderne). Peter Engelmann was honoured by the French State in February 2004 with the title &quot;Commandeur dans l´ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; for his work as a publisher.

The Passagen Verlag, the name &quot;Passagen&quot; being an allusion to Walter Benjamin&#x27;s most important text Passagenwerk, publishes besides Derrida authors such as Jean-François Lyotard, Gianni Vattimo, Jean Baudrillard, Paul Feyerabend, Peter Eisenman, Jacques Lacan, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, Sarah Kofman, Gerhard Anna Concic-Kaucic, Slavoj Žižek, Emmanuel Levinas, Clifford Geertz, Ginka Steinwachs, Dennis Cooper, Wolfgang Schirmacher, etc.

<text>Michael Bridges (born 5 August 1978) is an English professional football manager and retired former footballer.

As a player, he was a striker who notably played in the Premier League for Sunderland, Leeds United and Newcastle United, as well as a brief spell in the top flight for Bolton Wanderers that yielded no appearances. He also played in the Football League for Bristol City, Carlisle United, Hull City and Milton Keynes Dons as well as playing in Australia with Sydney FC, Newcastle Jets and Lambton Jaffas. He was capped 11 times by England U21, scoring three goals. He also represented England U21s at international level.

==Club career==

===Sunderland===
Bridges emerged as one of the Premier League&#x27;s most promising young strikers during the 1996–97 season at Sunderland, but was unable to save them from relegation. Two years later he helped them return to the Premiership and joined Leeds United for £5 million soon afterwards. He made a total of 79 Appearances at Sunderland, and scored 16 Goals.

In the summer of 1999, Sunderland agreed a fee to sell him to Tottenham Hotspur. Bridges who travelled down to sign a contract with manager George Graham and many years later in a 2021 podcast he recalled the reason he didn&#x27;t make the move was the treatment he got from owner Alan Sugar as he was about to sign his contract. Bridges mentioned on the podcast: &quot;Then all of a sudden this blue Rolls-Royce pulled up outside and he said, &#x27;Oh, here&#x27;s Lord Sugar, he&#x27;s come to say hi and welcome to the club&#x27;, and I kid you not, I&#x27;ll give you the thirty seconds I got off Alan Sugar while I was sat there with my agent, in London, scared stiff by the way. He said: &#x27;Young man, nice to meet you I&#x27;ve never heard of you before, I&#x27;ve heard you&#x27;re a Sunderland reserve player, I&#x27;m putting all my faith in these two lads [Graham and Pleat] here who say I&#x27;ve got to pay this kind of money for you. I think it&#x27;s ridiculous because you don&#x27;t get much for your money, because you don&#x27;t look like you could lift a paperweight. And by the way, you&#x27;re not getting the money your agent thinks he&#x27;s getting, you&#x27;ve got to earn that - take care, good luck. I looked at my agent as [if] to say: &#x27;Get me the hell out of here, that&#x27;s it done&#x27;. As Sugar left, George Graham apologised.

===Leeds United===
Bridges was signed for Leeds United by David O&#x27;Leary for £5 million from Sunderland as a replacement for Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink who weeks later left to join Atlético Madrid. In his first season at Elland Road, Bridges scored 19 Premiership goals including a hat-trick in his second game against Southampton – the first Leeds player to score a hat-trick in a competitive game since Gary McAllister in October 1995.

Bridges also helped his side finish third in the Premiership, qualify for the Champions League and reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. Bridges was seriously injured in the 0–0 draw in a Champions League match with Beşiktaş and was plagued with injuries over the next four seasons of his Leeds United career, only making a further ten appearances due to his injuries and not scoring any goals. He was released by Leeds in May 2004.

===Newcastle United===
As a result of his injuries he was loaned out to Newcastle United in a loan swap with Steven Caldwell in January 2004 to help alleviate their striker crisis. After only making a single start for Newcastle, on the right wing as opposed to in his favoured striking role, Bridges was out of contract in the summer of 2004 with his contract not being renewed due to his injury problems. He made only six appearances for Newcastle, and failed to score in any of those matches.

===Unsettled===
He was quickly snapped up by Bolton Wanderers but made no first team appearances. Released by Bolton he spent the rest of the season back at the Stadium of Light with Sunderland, scoring once against Stoke, before joining Bristol City, where he scored once in the League Cup against Barnet.

===Carlisle United===
In November 2005 Bridges joined Carlisle United, becoming perhaps their most influential player in their successful promotion charge into League One. Bridges&#x27; 15 goals made him very popular in Carlisle and thanks to them he reestablished his football career, but the fans were sad when he decided to leave Brunton Park on transfer deadline day, 31 August 2006. It was reported that Hull City had a £250,000 bid for Bridges turned down, and that because of this, Bridges handed in a transfer request. Hull returned with an improved bid of £350,000, and this was accepted.

===Hull City===
His first season at Hull was largely disappointing. However, he did earn the Tigers their first league win of the season with a spectacular goal against Leicester City, but through a combination of injuries (back and ankle), suspension (following a sending off in a reserve game) and simply not being selected, he made only eight starts and seven substitute appearances for the Tigers, scoring further goals against Cardiff in the league and Crewe Alexandra in the League Cup.

Due to lack of first team opportunity at Hull, Bridges was allowed to leave on loan for a short term deal at Australian side Sydney FC on 15 October 2007.

In the same season he rejected a loan move to League One side Crewe Alexandra. On 2 June 2009, he was released from his contract along with seven other players.

===Sydney FC===
He scored his first league goal for the club on 3 November in the 1–0 win over Newcastle Jets. A viral infection forced him to miss two matches away at Adelaide United and Wellington Phoenix and following this found it hard to regain favour of coach John Kosmina. He returned to the Sydney first team in January as a substitute against Queensland Roar.

After just nine games and two goals Bridges returned to Hull after the expiration of his six-month loan deal.

===Return to Carlisle United===
On 24 July 2008, Bridges returned to Carlisle, on a season-long loan deal. The club had first option on signing him permanently, at the end of the loan, as his Hull City contract where to expire. After the now departed manager John Ward had left him out of every starting line-up since the start of the season, Bridges finally got a starting place in the League One fixture against top of the table Leicester City at Brunton Park. Although Carlisle lost the game 2–1, Bridges and his strike partner Danny Graham looked to be forming an impressive partnership and this was later proved so in a 3–0 boxing day victory over Huddersfield Town with Michael Bridges on the scoresheet. He then started the following game, a 0–0 draw away at promotion chasing Oldham Athletic.

In July 2009, Bridges was taken on pre-season tour by Norwich City, as a trialist.

===Milton Keynes Dons===
On 8 August 2009, Bridges was signed by Milton Keynes Dons on a non-contract basis. He came on as a substitute towards the end of the match on the opening day of the season against Hartlepool United and started in a League Cup defeat against Swindon Town, being replaced in the second half. He left the club after three weeks and making two appearances, and decided to return to Australia to continue his career.

===Newcastle Jets===
On 25 September 2009, it was confirmed that Bridges was trialling with the Newcastle Jets with a view to earn a six-month contract at the club. He announced on Fox Sports&#x27; Matchday Saturday program that, if all went well, he and Jets coach, Branko Čulina would sit down and discuss a contract. Bridges signed a contract to play for the Jets for the remainder of the 2009–10 season on 30 September.

In his first game for the Jets, a 1–1 draw with Adelaide United at Hindmarsh Stadium on 5 October, Bridges set up Korean midfielder Song Jin-Hyung for the opening goal of the match in the sixth minute. He managed to last for around 80 minutes before being replaced by Sasho Petrovski. Branko Čulina expressed his surprise that Bridges had lasted so long and suggested that he would only improve as he continued to increase his match-fitness. On 23 October, Bridges scored his first goal for the Jets, netting the opener in the team&#x27;s 2–1 home win over their derby rivals, the Central Coast Mariners. It was the Jets&#x27; first victory after a six-game winless streak.

He scored again in the 50th minute after finishing a precise through-ball from Matt Thompson, and in turn set up Thompson for the decisive goal of the match in the 58th minute before being substituted a minute later in light of a recent hamstring injury. Following the Sydney match, which saw the Jets notch up their first ever win against their big-city rivals at the Sydney Football Stadium, Bridges pledged his commitment to the club by signing a two-year extension to his contract on 2 December which would see him play with the Jets until the end of the 2011–12 A-League season.

On 22 July 2010, Bridges was named captain of the Newcastle Jets alongside defender Ljubo Miličević who was named the vice-captain thereby becoming the first international captain in the club&#x27;s history. On 29 April 2011, Bridges announced his retirement from his playing career following a knee injury, taking on a new role with owners of the Newcastle Jets, Tinkler Sports Group.

===Return from retirement===
On 7 November 2011, Bridges returned from retirement, signing a contract with the Jets until the end of the 2011–12 season. Bridges then played his first game back against Melbourne Victory which the Jets won 3–0. Bridges scored his first goal after his return to football in a 3–0 win over Melbourne Heart. Since then he has been a starter in the attacking midfield role. On 14 March 2013, Bridges extended his contract with the Jets for another season. Bridges&#x27; agreement included involvement with the Emerging Jets program in the off-season. Bridges followed up this extension by scoring a goal in 1–1 draw with Adelaide United the following day.

===Lambton Jaffas FC===
In February 2015, Bridges signed a one-year contract with the Lambton Jaffas FC in the National Premier Leagues Northern NSW.

==Post-playing career==
After retiring from playing in 2015, Bridges took his coaches badges and, in April 2018, lodged an interest in managing Football League 2 side Carlisle United. As of 2021, he is a pundit for Optus Sport in Australia. He was the manager of National Premier Leagues Northern NSW team Edgeworth FC from 2020 to 2021.

<doc id="1238518" wikidata="Q1438735" url="?curid=1238518" title="Norfolk Admirals (AHL)">
<text>The Norfolk Admirals were a professional ice hockey team based in Norfolk, Virginia, that competed in the American Hockey League (AHL). The team played its home games at Norfolk Scope. The Admirals were the AHL affiliate of the Tampa Bay Lightning and Anaheim Ducks. 

For the 2015–16 season, the Admirals moved to San Diego, California, to become the newest version of the San Diego Gulls as part of the AHL&#x27;s efforts to create a Pacific Division. The Bakersfield Condors from the ECHL moved to Norfolk for the 2015–16 season and also use the name Norfolk Admirals.

==History==
The market was previously home to: 
* Tidewater Wings (1971–1972 AHL)
* Virginia Wings (1972–1975 AHL)
* Hampton Gulls (1974–1977 SHL, 1977–1978 AHL)
* Hampton Aces (1978–1981 NEHL)
* Hampton Roads Gulls (1982–1983 ACHL)
* Hampton Roads Admirals (1989–2000 ECHL)

The original team ownership, Mark Garcea and Page Johnson (owners of the Hampton Roads Admirals franchise in the East Coast Hockey League), sought and gained admission to the American Hockey League as an expansion franchise for the 2000–01 season with an affiliation agreement with the Chicago Blackhawks. On May 26, 2004, the franchise was purchased by Ken Young after the original owners had put it up for sale. The team name pays homage to the area&#x27;s long naval history.

Norfolk was one of two franchises in the AHL named the Admirals, sharing the nickname with the Milwaukee Admirals. The Milwaukee franchise transferred from the defunct International Hockey League, and were allowed to keep their previous moniker.

Norfolk&#x27;s geographically closest rivals were the Hershey Bears, Charlotte Checkers, and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. The Admirals had two mascots, a dog named Salty and a rabbit named Hat Trick.

On March 19, 2007, the Blackhawks announced that their affiliation with the Admirals would end after the 2006–07 season. On March 29, 2007, the Tampa Bay Lightning officially announced the Admirals as their new affiliate. On June 14, 2012 Tampa Bay announced their separation from the 2012 Calder Cup champions in favor of the Syracuse Crunch. Later in that month owner Ken Young announced he had closed a five-year agreement with the Anaheim Ducks.

===2011–12 season===
During the 2011–12 season, the Norfolk Admirals, coached by Jon Cooper, set a professional hockey record for the longest winning streak, winning their 28th consecutive game on April 15 against the Adirondack Phantoms. The streak far surpassed the previous AHL record of 17 straight wins set by the Philadelphia Phantoms in 2004–05, as well as the pro hockey record of 18 games set by the Peoria Rivermen of the original International Hockey League in 1991.

The streak garnered international media attention for the Admirals and the American Hockey League, including highlights on NHL Network and ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

The 28-game streak included 15 home games and 13 road games. The win streak started on February 10 against Adirondack. Before their 3-2 OT win against Binghamton on April 14, the previous 20 games were all won in regulation. As of October 20, 2012, the Admirals had won 32 regular season games in a row dating back to the 2011–12 season.

The winning streak translated into a deep playoff run for the Admirals, where they would win 15 of 18 playoff games, including back to back four game sweeps in the Eastern Conference and Calder Cup Finals. On June 9, 2012, the Admirals captured their first ever Calder Cup with a 6–1 win over the Toronto Marlies.

Prior to the 2012–13 season, the Admirals and the Syracuse Crunch parent NHL organizations swapped teams. As a result, the Admirals failed to qualify for the Calder Cup playoffs while the Crunch made it to the Calder Cup Finals.

===Relocation===
On January 6, 2015, it was announced that the Admirals would move to an unknown location on the west coast, likely close to their NHL affiliate, after the franchise was purchased by the Anaheim Ducks. On January 29, 2015, the Ducks confirmed the Admirals&#x27; relocation to San Diego to become the newest incarnation of the San Diego Gulls. The Admirals were replaced in Norfolk with the relocated Bakersfield Condors franchise of the ECHL. The new team retained the Admirals name and logo but were affiliated with the Edmonton Oilers.

<doc id="1238520" wikidata="Q6545325" url="?curid=1238520" title="Life with the Lyons">
<text>Life with the Lyons was a British radio and television sitcom franchise that ran between 1950 and 1961.

==Background==
Following a highly publicized trial against their stalker, American actors Ben Lyon and Bebe Daniels moved to London in 1935. For several years, the couple commuted between London and Los Angeles, where their children resided with Daniels&#x27; mother and Lyon was under contract to 20th Century Fox.

At the advent of World War II, Lyon and Daniels were touring England in vaudeville when Lyon developed the idea for a radio series in an effort to boost morale. In 1940, the couple debuted &quot;Hi, Gang!&quot;, in which they starred with Vic Oliver with scripts written by Daniels. During the war, Lyon joined the newly formed Special Services unit of the United States military while Daniels served as a war correspondent. Following the war, the Lyons moved to London permanently with their children. Deciding to expand their show into a family effort, &quot;Hi, Gang!&quot; ended in 1949.

&quot;Life With the Lyons&quot; was created by Daniels, which she developed with Bob Block and Bill Harding. The trio would often work on scripts late at night in the family&#x27;s basement. The show featured a fictionalized version of the family, with Barbara Lyon and Richard Lyon starring as their children. Molly Weir was also cast as the family&#x27;s Scottish maid, Aggie MacDonald. For the fifth to seventh series of the radio show – and the first two series of the television adaption – Richard Bellaers starred as Robin Lyon, the couple&#x27;s youngest child. Also cast were Horace Percival as their henpecked neighbour, Mr Wimple, and Doris Rogers as Florrie Wainwright, Bebe&#x27;s nosy friend who frequently spars with Ben.

==Radio==
&quot;Life With the Lyons&quot; debuted on BBC Radio on 5 November 1950. It was the first scripted situation comedy show in the United Kingdom. The series ran for 252 episodes over eleven seasons, ending on 19 May 1961.

Daniels and Block served as writers for all eleven seasons. Harding departed the series after seasons three, and was replaced by Ronnie Hanbury. Other writers for the series used on occasion included Jill Allgood, Brad Ashton, Robert Hounsome, and Ray Sonin.

Many radio episodes were not kept by the BBC and only three episodes are in the archives; these were on BBC Radio 7 in early 2011. Following this broadcast, the BBC were alerted to a private collection of around 200 episodes owned by Graeme Stevenson in Scotland, and a selection of 14 episodes were rebroadcast on Radio 7&#x27;s successor BBC Radio 4 Extra between July and December 2011 and rebroadcast at later dates.

===Cast===
*Bebe Daniels Lyon as Bebe Lyon
*Ben Lyon as Ben Lyon
*Barbara Lyon as Barbara Lyon
*Richard Lyon as Richard Lyon
*Molly Weir as Aggie MacDonald
*Richard Bellaers as Robin Lyon (series 5–7, radio; series 1–2, television)
*Horace Percival as Mr Wimple
*Doris Rogers as Florrie Wainwright

Following Barbara&#x27;s marriage to Russell Turner, he began a recurring role as her husband Russell. Hugh Morton recurred throughout the series as Ben&#x27;s boss.

==Films==
Two feature films both directed by Val Guest were made with the cast of the series between the radio and television versions. The Lyons&#x27; contract called for them to receive a percentage of the film&#x27;s profits.

* &quot;Life with the Lyons&quot; (1954)
* &quot;The Lyons in Paris&quot; (1955)

==Television==
In 1954, the family appeared in a special on BBC Television. Following its success and that of the first feature film, the network approved a television adaption of &quot;Life With the Lyons&quot;. BBC aired the first two series, consisting of four episodes each, in the summers of 1955 and 1956 respectively. In 1957, ITV picked up the series for a full fall series of 10 episodes. The show remained on ITV for another three seasons until it ended in 1960.

Only six episodes survive in television archives. One from the first series, two each from the third and fourth, and one from the final series. The surviving first-season episode was shown on BBC Four on 27 March 2005 as part of the &quot;TV on Trial&quot; season. The episode was not shown &quot;in the clear&quot;viewers had the choice of a version without commentary but with on-screen logos, or with commentary by Roy Hattersley and Kathryn Flett.

==In popular culture==
* John Lennon was a fan of the radio show, and paid tribute to the show in his second album with Yoko Ono, &quot;Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions&quot;.
* In his song &quot;Post World War Two Blues&quot;, on the album &quot;Past, Present &amp; Future&quot; (1973), Al Stewart sings, &quot;We were locked up safe and warm from the snow / With &#x27;Life with the Lyons&#x27; on the radio...&quot;.

<text>The Syracuse Crunch are a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League (AHL). They play in Syracuse, New York, at the Upstate Medical University Arena. They are the primary development affiliate of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Tampa Bay Lightning.

==History==
===Vancouver and Pittsburgh affiliations (1994–2000)===
The franchise originated in 1992 as the Hamilton Canucks, which was an affiliate of the NHL&#x27;s Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks played in Hamilton, Ontario, for two seasons, before relocating to upstate New York in 1994. They were then renamed the &quot;Crunch&quot; from a public vote that included five names. The Crunch played their first game in Syracuse on September 30, 1994, against the Albany River Rats to a 7–7 tie with Lonny Bohonos scoring the first Crunch goal. The Crunch recorded their first win in Syracuse on October 2, 1994, as they defeated the Hershey Bears 4–1. The Crunch finished their first season 29–42–9–0, fifth place in the division, and outside the playoffs. The Crunch made the playoffs in the following season after finishing 31–37–5–7 and made it to the 1996 conference finals before losing to the eventual Calder Cup champion Rochester Americans. The team led the league in sellouts in 1996–97 and 1997–98 seasons. In 1997, the Crunch added a second NHL affiliate with the Pittsburgh Penguins.

The 1998–99 season was the Crunch&#x27;s worst season in franchise history. The Crunch would finish the season with a league-worst record of 18–50–9–3. On November 25, 1998, the Crunch suffered their worst loss in team history to the Providence Bruins, with a 14–2 final score. They allowed an AHL record of 10 goals in the first period. Goalie Craig Hillier allowed seven goals before being pulled for Mike Valley, who also allowed seven. The Penguins&#x27; affiliation ended after this season when they launched the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.

On October 30, 1999, while playing against Rochester, goaltender Christian Bronsard scored the first and only Crunch goalie goal. Bronsard became the fourth goaltender in AHL history to score a goal.

The Crunch qualified for the playoffs following the 1999–2000 season, their last season as Vancouver&#x27;s AHL affiliate, but lost in the first round to the Hamilton Bulldogs.

===Columbus affiliation (2000–2010)===
The Crunch became the affiliate of the newly formed Columbus Blue Jackets following the 1999–2000 season. They made the playoffs in their first season under the Jackets, but lost in five games to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins in the first round. In the following 2001–02 season, the Crunch won their first division title in franchise history behind goaltender Jean-Francois Labbe. In addition to the division title, they also were regular season Western Conference champions, with a conference-leading 96 points. However, they were two points shy of tying the Bridgeport Sound Tigers for the AHL lead, and three points shy of winning the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy for top team in the regular season. After receiving a bye in the Conference Qualifiers round, the Crunch swept the Philadelphia Phantoms in three games, but lost to the eventual Calder Cup champion Chicago Wolves in the next round in seven games.

On March 17, 2002, the Crunch played against the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. This game was infamously named the &quot;St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot;. The Crunch accumulated 124 penalty minutes, 80 of which were fighting-related, while the Penguins had 162 penalty minutes with 102 for fighting. The Crunch won the game 4–0. The Crunch would miss the playoffs the following season, their second-worst season in franchise history, finishing 27–41–8–4.

In the 2004 Calder Cup playoffs, the Crunch became the twelfth team to blow a 3–1 series lead when they lost to the Rochester Americans in the first round. The Crunch were on home ice for game seven and forward Kent McDonnell missed an empty net when the Americans&#x27; goalie Ryan Miller was caught out of position. Rochester then recovered with an odd-man rush and Norm Milley beat Crunch goalie Karl Goehring to win the game in overtime.

The 2005–06 season was the best season the Crunch had during the 80-game schedule format. They scored a team record of 272 goals, but they also allowed 251 goals, and ended the regular season second in their division, 13 points behind Grand Rapids. They also had 47 wins, which is tied with their 2018–19 season record, albeit in four fewer games with the 76-game schedule. Andy Delmore won the Eddie Shore Award, scoring 72 points in 66 games, while also making the AHL First All-Star team at the end of the season. Mark Hartigan also scored 75 points in 49 games, averaging over a point and a half per game. They then lost in the first round of the 2006 Calder Cup playoffs to the Manitoba Moose in six games.

During the 2007–08 season, the Crunch went on a 15-game winning streak at the end of the season from March 8 to April 13, 2008, to make the playoffs. The Crunch also went without losing a game in regulation for the final 23 games of the season, spanning from February 22 to April 13, 2008. They defeated the Manitoba Moose in six games, where five of them went to overtime. They advanced to the second round to face the Toronto Marlies, but blew another 3–1 series lead.

The Crunch played the first outdoor game in AHL history on February 20, 2010, against the Binghamton Senators. The Mirabito Outdoor Classic took place at the Grandstand at the New York State Fairgrounds in Syracuse. The game set a then AHL attendance record of 21,508. Syracuse won the game 2–1, with goals scored by Alexandre Picard and David Liffiton. Goaltender Kevin Lalande made 36 saves en route to the Syracuse victory.

The Crunch missed the playoffs in their final two seasons as the affiliate of the Blue Jackets, as they switched their affiliation to the Springfield Falcons in 2010.

===Anaheim affiliation (2010–2012)===
The Anaheim affiliation lasted two seasons, resulting in one playoff appearance in the 2011–12 season. They lost in the first round to the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps in four games. The affiliation produced future NHL players such as Kyle Palmieri, Nick Bonino and Patrick Maroon.

===Tampa Bay affiliation (2012–present)===
===Early affiliation success and first finals appearance (2012–2015)===
The Crunch signed a multi-year affiliation deal with the Tampa Bay Lightning beginning with the 2012–13 season. Due to the 2012–13 NHL lockout, the Crunch were able to initially roster many future NHLers before the start of the NHL season, such as Tyler Johnson, Alex Killorn, Radko Gudas, and Ondrej Palat. Head coach Jon Cooper was the first head coach during the Tampa Bay affiliation, but was promoted mid-season following the firing of Lightning head coach Guy Boucher. Rob Zettler was named as head coach, a role he would hold until the end of the 2015–16 season. This helped the affiliation to bring in immediate success, resulting in the team&#x27;s first division championship in 11 years. The offense surged, scoring a league-leading 247 goals. At the end of the season, Tyler Johnson won the Les Cunningham Award, Willie Marshall Award, and the President&#x27;s Award. He was the first MVP in Crunch history. He totaled 65 points, scoring 37 goals and assisted on 28 goals. 

The team won seven consecutive games to open the playoffs, including two consecutive round sweeps of the Portland Pirates in the conference quarterfinals, and another sweep of the Springfield Falcons in the conference semifinals, before losing the opening game of the eastern conference finals to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. The Crunch were able to win the following four games, advancing to the 2013 Calder Cup finals, their first ever Calder Cup appearance. The Crunch faced off against the Grand Rapids Griffins, but lost to the Griffins in six games.

The Crunch could not replicate the success of the previous season, finishing last place in the division, while missing the 2014 Calder Cup playoffs entirely. The Crunch were able to initially roster future NHLers, such as Nikita Kucherov, Brett Connolly, and Vladislav Namestnikov. The team also added Yanni Gourde and Jonathan Marchessault as late season additions. 

On November 22, 2014, the Syracuse Crunch set a new United States indoor professional hockey attendance record with 30,715 fans at the Carrier Dome for the &quot;Toyota Frozen Dome Classic&quot;. Syracuse defeated the Utica Comets 2–1.
===Ben Groulx era and second finals appearance (2016–2023)===
The Crunch won their second division title under the Tampa affiliation in the 2016–17 season. They advanced to their second Calder Cup appearance, again against the Grand Rapids Griffins. The Griffins took the series in six games and won the series 4–2. They also lost an AHL record eight road games during the playoffs.

On May 5, 2018, the Syracuse Crunch played their longest game in team history, which the Crunch lost 2–1 in double overtime to the Toronto Marlies. The game lasted 95 minutes and 10 seconds. The Crunch previously played two double-overtime games, both in the 2017 Calder Cup playoffs. They played a double-overtime game in the first round against the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps, resulting in a 4–3 double-overtime win. That game lasted 90 minutes and 37 seconds, their previous record. They also played another double-overtime game in the 2017 Calder Cup Finals, a 6–5 loss in double overtime to the Grand Rapids Griffins, lasting 87 minutes and 2 seconds.

The 2018–19 season was the best season the Crunch has had during the 76-game schedule format. The Crunch tied a team record in points with 102, and tied a franchise record in wins with 47. Edward Pasquale won the Harry &quot;Hap&quot; Holmes Memorial Award, Carter Verhaeghe won the John B. Sollenberger Trophy and Verhaeghe and Alex Barre-Boulet both won the Willie Marshall Award, as they both tied for the league lead in goals scored. The Crunch also achieved 900 franchise victories with a 6–2 win over the Utica Comets on March 30, 2019. The Crunch won their third division title in the Tampa affiliation, but were upset in four games by the Cleveland Monsters.

The Crunch played their first 62 games of the 2019–20 season, but the season was suspended on March 12, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The season was ultimately cancelled on May 11, 2020. The start of the following season was also pushed back to February 5, 2021. The Crunch also gained a temporary second NHL affiliation in the Florida Panthers as their AHL affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers, opted out of participating in the abbreviated season. 

Prior to the pandemic-related schedule changes, the Crunch were to face the Utica Comets in an outdoor game hosted by Utica at the Griffiss Business and Technology Park in Rome, New York, on February 13, 2021, however, the game did not take place as scheduled.

===Syracuse Hockey Hall of Fame===
On November 5, 2024, the Crunch announced the creation of the Syracuse Hockey Hall of Fame. The inaugural class included Crunch owner Howard Dolgon, longtime Onondaga County Deputy County Executive Ed Kochian, Crunch general partner Alan Taylor, Syracuse Blazers forward Brian Elwell, and former Crunch forward Scott Walker. The inaugural class was inducted on November 23, 2024.

==Logos==
Owner Howard Dolgon came up with the superhero mascot Crunchman for the team&#x27;s debut in 1994. In 2000, as the Crunch became an affiliate of the Columbus Blue Jackets, Crunchman was replaced with Al the Ice Gorilla. Al remained until 2012, when Dolgon found the new affiliation with Tampa Bay a good reason to return with Crunchman.

===Honored numbers===
The Crunch raised a banner following a fan vote during the team&#x27;s fifth season in honor of fan favorite #14 &quot;Big Bad&quot; John Badduke. It is not retired, as it would later be worn by former United States Olympian Darby Hendrickson, Serge Aubin, Richard Panik, Justin Courtnall, Brandon Alderson, Mike McNamee, Kevin Lynch, Devante Stephens and most recently, Brandon Crawley.

During the 2008–09 season, the team temporarily reserved, but not retired, #7 as a tribute to Paul Newman after his death. This honors Reg Dunlop, the player-coach for the fictional Charlestown Chiefs, which Newman played in the movie &quot;Slap Shot&quot;. The movie was filmed partially at Onondaga County War Memorial. Coincidentally, other scenes were filmed at Cambria County War Memorial Arena in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the home ice of the Crunch&#x27;s former ECHL affiliate, the Johnstown Chiefs. The banner was raised October 14 and was up for the entire season, but the number was not retired, as it was most recently worn by Crunch player Mathieu Joseph in the 2019–20 season.

On March 26, 2016, the Syracuse Crunch retired Dolph Schayes&#x27; number #4. Schayes played for the Syracuse Nationals and their successor, the Philadelphia 76ers. He was the first player in the National Basketball Association to score 15,000 points in his career. This number is not officially retired, as the number was most recently worn by Trevor Carrick during the 2022–23 season.

<text>The Utah Grizzlies are a professional ice hockey team in the ECHL. They play their home games at Maverik Center in West Valley City, Utah.

== Franchise history ==
The current Utah Grizzlies franchise started in 1981 as the Nashville South Stars in Nashville, Tennessee, in the Central Hockey League. Henry Brabham then took over the team in 1983 and relocated them to Vinton, Virginia mid-season, to become the Virginia Lancers. Brabham and the Lancers were then one of the founding members of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) in 1988. The franchise was sold and relocated several times until it went dormant after the 2002–03 season. After the American Hockey League (AHL) incarnation of the Grizzlies suspended operations, David Elmore and Donna Tuttle bought the rights to the dormant ECHL franchise and moved the team to the E Center to replace the previous Grizzlies franchise.

Prior to the 2013–14 season, their NHL affiliate Calgary Flames changed their affiliation to the Alaska Aces. Incoming head coach and general manager Tim Branham announced a three-year agreement with the Anaheim Ducks on August 7, 2013. 
After the Grizzlies made the post-season in every season within the Ducks organization, the Grizzlies and Ducks agreed to a multi-year extension during the 2015–16 season.

Following the 2017–18 season, the Grizzlies missed the post-season for the first time in 11 years. At that time, their ECHL rival, the Colorado Eagles, joined the American Hockey League as an affiliate of the Colorado Avalanche after previously serving as the Avalanche affiliate in the ECHL. The Grizzlies ended their agreement with the Ducks and affiliated with the Avalanche, their then-closest geographical NHL club.

The market was previously served by:
* Utah Grizzlies of the IHL and AHL (1995–2005)

<doc id="1238539" wikidata="Q1503186" url="?curid=1238539" title="St. John's Maple Leafs">
<text>The St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs were a minor ice hockey team in the American Hockey League. They played in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, at Memorial Stadium from 1991 to 2001, and at Mile One Stadium from 2001 to 2005. The team was also colloquially known as the &quot;Baby Leafs&quot; after their parent NHL team, the Toronto Maple Leafs.

While the AHL had a strong presence in Atlantic Canada in the 1980s and 1990s, largely due to the desire of several National Hockey League Canadian franchises to continue to pay players sent down to the minors in Canadian dollars, by 2004, St. John&#x27;s was the last remaining team in the region prior to its relocation to Ontario.

==History==
The Leafs&#x27; AHL franchise was established in Moncton, New Brunswick, in 1978 as the New Brunswick Hawks, where they played until 1982. The franchise had stops in St. Catharines, Ontario, as the St. Catharines Saints (1982–1986) and Newmarket, Ontario, as the Newmarket Saints (1986–1991). The St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs were established in 1991 when the Toronto Maple Leafs moved its AHL farm team to St. John&#x27;s, becoming the first professional ice hockey team in Newfoundland and Labrador.

The team initially played their home games at Memorial Stadium. The St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs played their inaugural game on May 8, 1991, in front of a sold-out crowd, where they defeated the Fredericton Canadiens 5–3. The team made it to the Calder Cup finals in their inaugural season, losing a seven game series to the Adirondack Red Wings four-games-to-three. The Leafs were crowned division champions for the 1992–93 and 1996–97 seasons, and won the regular season title during the 1993–94 AHL season.

In 1993, municipal workers for the City of St. John&#x27;s voted to strike including the city staff operating the St. John&#x27;s Memorial Stadium. Prior a game in February, the Maple Leafs team arrived at the stadium on a bus, where they were met by a picket line of strikers who then surrounded the bus and began rocking it with the team and personnel on board. Local police were able to intervene, allowing the bus and Maple Leafs to escape unharmed. Following the incident, the Leafs took an extended road trip and the Toronto Maple Leafs threatened to pull the team out of the province. They remained at Memorial Stadium for ten seasons until moving to the newly built Mile One Centre in downtown St. John&#x27;s in 2001.

The Maple Leafs were a successful team throughout their time in St. John&#x27;s and made multiple appearances in the AHL Calder Cup playoffs (missing the playoffs in 2000, 2003, and 2004). On April 29, 2005, the Maple Leafs played their final game, losing 4–0 to the Manitoba Moose in game five of the division semifinal round of the playoffs at the MTS Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Leafs&#x27; final home game was a 6–1 victory in game two of the semifinals.

Their 2005 playoff loss marked the end of 34 consecutive seasons of AHL presence in Atlantic Canada, which began in 1971 with the Nova Scotia Voyageurs in Halifax, Nova Scotia. By 2005, the AHL&#x27;s gradual withdrawal from the Atlantic left the Maple Leafs&#x27; nearest opponent as the Portland Pirates, away. In an effort to reduce travel costs, the parent club ultimately decided to relocate the team to Toronto for the 2005–06 season, where it became known as the Toronto Marlies.

===Equipment manager===
Shannon (Shaq) Coady was the original stick boy for the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs, after winning a local contest at the age of 14. Coady became the team&#x27;s equipment manager, and he remained in that role until the team&#x27;s relocation to Toronto. Coady went on to work for the St. John&#x27;s Fog Devils of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, and the American Hockey League&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s IceCaps. Coady was a well-known figure in NL, due to his work with the province&#x27;s professional sports teams. Coady died on March 24, 2021, prompting tributes from NHL players and personnel, who had worked with Coady.

=== Mascot ===

The St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs&#x27; team mascot was a puffin named &quot;Buddy.&quot; Buddy wore a Maple Leafs home jersey with the number 92 to commemorate the year he was introduced. The puffin design was selected from a fan contest to create a mascot for the Leafs&#x27; second season. Buddy remained the mascot until the team&#x27;s departure in 2005. Buddy was reintroduced as the mascot for the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps wearing an IceCaps home jersey with his familiar number of 92. Buddy also served as the mascot for the Newfoundland Growlers of the ECHL. Chris Abbott, the man in the costume, died in St. John&#x27;s on February 1, 2022.

===Media===
St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs games were broadcast by VOCM news radio, (and by CJYQ in later seasons) and on local television by Cable Atlantic, which was acquired by Rogers Communications in 2001. Brian Rogers was the long-time voice of the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs, after taking over the role from George MacClaren in 1994.

<doc id="1238544" wikidata="Q5447495" url="?curid=1238544" title="Fifth Column (band)">
<text>Fifth Column was a Canadian all-female post-punk band from Toronto, formed in 1980 and breaking up in 1995.

==History==
The band began as a trio named Second Unit, with GB Jones on drums, Kathleen Pirrie Adams on bass, and Janet Martin on guitar. Caroline Azar saw this group play in the fall of 1980, and shortly after successfully auditioned as singer, and this lineup played their first gig as Fifth Column in late 1980.

The band took the name &quot;Fifth Column&quot; from their interpretation of an alleged military manoeuvre by fascist Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War, in which Nazi-aligned nationalist insurrectionists within besieged Republican Madrid, called the Fifth column, aided the four columns (north, south, east and west) outside the city&#x27;s perimeters.

Soon after forming, the group became involved in the Cassette culture of the 1980s. Their first release was a selection of songs on the cassette compilation &quot;Urban Scorch&quot; released by Some Product in 1981. GB Jones, Caroline Azar and Candy Parker released an underground xerox art/social commentary zine named &quot;Hide&quot;, of which they published five issues. After its first issue, they came out with audio cassettes that were compilations of music by their punk, post-punk and experimental contemporaries, like Anti-Scrunti Faction, The Dave Howard Singers, Mydolls, The Party&#x27;s Over, Really Red, Rongwrong, and Michael Phillip Wojewoda, as well as Fifth Column. It is important to note that mainstream local media/middle-of-the-road maligners of the group, were a mix of music reporters/columnists who were both female and male, uncomfortable with the sound and performance, not considered palatable at the time. The trend behind the attacks were based on the band&#x27;s approach to their genderific sketch of themselves as Second Wave feminists, disrupting populist ideas of being, songwriting, language and image. The commercial and careerist alternative scenes made of hetero-normative and gay assimilationists were also most threatened. The few Canadians in the media championing were: Radio Hosts/Journalists; CKLN&#x27;s Denise Benson, The Eye&#x27;s Chris O&#x27;Connor, The Sun&#x27;s John Sakamoto, The Globe and Mail&#x27;s Liam Lacey, CBC Brave New Wave&#x27;s hosts Brent Banbury and Kevin Komoda. The Fifth Column sound forged on Vinyl, would not be, without the deftness of Producers/Engineers: Peter D. Hudson (Dundrells), Walter Sobczak (Sturm Group), MP Wojewoda and the elusive Jack Freimanis. The aforementioned actualized the sound that Jones and Azar were aiming for. There were no female producers available or interested at that innate time in Toronto history and culture. There were many girls close to the group who were inspiring friends/muses, and many of them appeared in the music video &quot;Donna&quot;, like Jena Von Brucker, Mic Hell, Norma Jean LeFebvre and Ottilie Mason. 

Their first vinyl release was the 7&quot; &quot;Boy-Girl&quot; EP produced in 1983 by Voicepondence Records.

The name of their first full-length recording &quot;To Sir With Hate&quot; was a play on the theme song from the British school film, &quot;To Sir With Love&quot;, performed by Lulu. Produced by Michael Phillip Wojewoda, it is now considered a classic of Canadian music; at the 2016 Polaris Music Prize it was named a shortlisted nominee in the 1976-1985 category for the 2016 Polaris Music Prize, the 2017 Polaris Music Prize, and the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.

A song from this LP, &quot;The Fairview Mall Story&quot; was based on true events concerning media publication of the names of men arrested after being entrapped by police and was instrumental in paving the way for the emergence of the queercore scene. Their video for the song, directed by indie feature film director Steven Rumbelow, involved 50&#x27;s images of men cruising in their new cars, shopping malls, and car crashes, was intercut with the band and go-go dancer Bruce La Bruce. A video for the song &quot;Where Are they Now?&quot; was also made, directed by Marc de Guerre.

Their live shows often included films played overtop of the band and a &#x27;go-go&#x27; boy dancing. They were frequently accompanied by guest musicians who played instruments as varied as saxophone, trumpet, flute, or violin.

Independent-minded, they released their recordings, including their second full-length recording &quot;All-Time Queen Of The World&quot;, themselves. A video for the song &quot;Like This&quot; from the album was directed by Bruce LaBruce with the band. The band also appeared on a number of compilations.

In 1992 they released a single, &quot;All Women Are Bitches&quot;, on the independent record label K Records. &quot;All Women Are Bitches&quot; was produced by Walter Sobczak and Fifth Column. Despite being controversial and receiving little airplay, the recording was reviewed by Everett True and voted &quot;Single Of The Week&quot; in the UK music publication Melody Maker. This song was included as well on their last full-length recording, &quot;36C&quot;, released in 1994. That same year a video for the song &quot;Donna&quot; was also released. It was the flipside of the 1992 single and was also on the album.

The band broke up in early 1995, playing their final show in Ottawa. Jones has said the band were frustrated that she was too busy with a gallery in New York and many other projects. This led to Azar quitting after a missed an opportunity to tour the UK.

The band&#x27;s last recording was released in 2002, on the Kill Rock Stars compilation, &quot;Fields And Streams&quot;.

Caroline Azar again teamed up with G.B. Jones to create the installation/performance &quot;The Bruised Garden&quot; in 2013 at The Theatre Centre in Toronto, Ontario, which included music composed by the pair and credited to Fifth Column, making this their last song written together.

Band members have performed with other groups as well. Caroline Azar has recorded with Kickstand from New York, and Jolly Tambourine Man, Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet, Greek Buck and Hidden Cameras from Toronto. Since the breakup of the band: Azar produces her librettos/compositions for her dramatic musicals MAN-O-REXIC and D.I.N.K and other musical commissions. In 2015, Azar combined Wilfred Owen&#x27;s anti-war poem &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot; with original music she composed for Peter Hinton&#x27;s play &quot;The End&quot; at Theatre 20. Azar surprised audiences with her (2018 and 2019) two-part one-woman comedy stand up walking tour/lecture on the absurdity of civics, expressly written for actress-comedienne Jamillah Ross as PEO Rita Mae Nelson entitled &quot;St. Peon Of The People and St. Peon of Parkdale. The third installment was entitled St. Peon Of The Planet and was slated to go to The Edinburgh Festival, also starring GB Jones and Joel Gibb. 

Beverly Breckenridge toured with The Spinnanes and was also a member of Phono-Comb.

Prior to her involvement with Fifth Column, Jones was part of the electropunk band Bunny and the Lakers. She has collaborated with the Italian dark ambient group Mariae Nascenti and appeared on the single &quot;Party With The Devil&quot; by Agnoema. Jones now performs with Opera Arcana. In 2015, Caroline Azar teamed up with Opera Arcana to create a theatrical performance called &quot;The Bruised Spirits of Southern Ontario&quot;, an adult gothic folk musical experience based on the music of Opera Arcana, featuring Jones and Minus Smile (formerly of Kids On TV). Azar wrote the story (inspired by Jones&#x27; and Kerr&#x27;s trance-based meditations) and directed and produced the experimental multi media event for Opera Arcana at Videofag (run by Jordan Tannahill and William Ellis). Opera Arcana appeared as guest musicians on UK artist Nick Hudson&#x27;s 2016 release &quot;Ganymede In A State of War&quot;. In 2017, Opera Arcana recorded an original soundtrack for the film &quot;Downroad&quot; by Kelly Wydryk, released on CD in 2019.

Fifth Column have been nominated for a Polaris Music Prize in the Heritage section for the 2016 Polaris Music Prize, 2017 Polaris Music Prize, and 2018 Polaris Music Prize.

==In popular culture==
In 2004 the song &quot;All Women Are Bitches&quot; was covered and re-imagined by the band Lesbians On Ecstasy on their self-titled debut album, &quot;Lesbians On Ecstasy&quot;, as &quot;Bitchsy&quot;. in 2005, it was remixed and sampled along with &quot;Bitchsy&quot; by Kids on TV for the compilation album &quot;Giggles In The Dark&quot;.

In 2012, a documentary film by Kevin Hegge, called &quot;She Said Boom: The Story of Fifth Column&quot; was released featuring interviews with band members Caroline Azar, G.B. Jones, and Beverly Breckenridge, with commentary on the influence of Fifth Column by Toronto artist John Brown, Vaginal Davis, Kathleen Hanna and Bruce LaBruce.

<doc id="1238546" wikidata="Q133130" url="?curid=1238546" title="Unaysaurus">
<text>Unaysaurus is a genus of unaysaurid sauropodomorph herbivore dinosaur. Discovered in southern Brazil, in the geopark of Paleorrota, in 1998, and announced in a press conference on Thursday, December 3, 2004, it is one of the oldest dinosaurs known. It is closely related to plateosaurid dinosaurs found in Germany, which indicates that it was relatively easy for species to spread across the giant landmass of the time, the supercontinent of Pangaea.

The fossils of &quot;Unaysaurus&quot; are well preserved. They consist of an almost complete skull, complete with a lower jaw, and partial skeleton with many of the bones still connected to each other in their natural positions. It is one of the most complete dinosaur skeletons (including complete skull) ever recovered in Brazil.

== Discovery and naming ==

&quot;Unaysaurus&quot; was found in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, near the city of Santa Maria. It was recovered from the red beds of the Caturrita Formation, which is the geologic formation where similarly old dinosaurs like &quot;Saturnalia&quot; have been found. The oldest dinosaurs in the world are from here and nearby in Argentina (like the &quot;Eoraptor&quot;), which suggests that the first dinosaurs may have originated in the area.

In 2004, Luciano A. Leal, Sergio A. K. Azevodo, Alexander W. A. Kellner, and Átila A. S. da Rosa described &quot;Unaysaurus tolentinoi&quot; as a new genus and species on the basis of the holotype specimen UFSM 11069. The generic name, &quot;Unaysaurus&quot;, comes from the word &quot;&quot; (u-na-hee), meaning &quot;black water&quot; in the local Tupi language, which in turn refers to &quot;Agua Negra&quot; (also &quot;black water&quot;), the Portuguese name for the region where the fossils were found. The specific name, &quot;tolentinoi&quot; honors Tolentino Marafiga, who discovered the fossils by the side of a road in 1998.

==Description==

Like most early dinosaurs, &quot;Unaysaurus&quot; was relatively small, and walked on two legs. It was only long, tall, and weighed about ).

In 2023, Müller and colleagues described the remains of a juvenile specimen of &quot;Unaysaurus&quot; that was found associated with the holotype. The bones, including partial vertebrae and various foot material, are similarly proportioned to the bones of the holotype.

== Classification ==
Upon its description, &quot;Unaysaurus&quot; was assigned to the Plateosauridae. Under this assignment, the closest relative of &quot;Unaysaurus&quot; was, counter intuitively, not from South America, but rather &quot;Plateosaurus&quot;, which lived about 210 million years ago in Germany. However, in 2018, &quot;Unaysaurus&quot; was found to belong to the newly erected clade Unaysauridae, alongside &quot;Macrocollum&quot; and &quot;Jaklapallisaurus&quot;, the former of which was from Brazil.

== Paleoecology ==

&quot;Unaysaurus&quot; lived between about 225 to 200 million years ago, in the Carnian or Norian age of the late Triassic period. It was found in the south of Brazil, which at the time was connected to northwest Africa. The whole world was united into the great supercontinent of Pangaea, which was just starting to divide into Laurasia in the north, and Gondwana in the south. A U-Pb (Uranium decay) dating found that the Caturrita Formation dated around 225.42 million years ago, putting it less than 10 million years younger than the Santa Maria and Ischigualasto Formations, from where the earliest dinosaurs are known.

The Caturrita Formation has uncovered a wide variety of fauna, although the formation is also referred to as the upper portion of the Santa Maria 2 Sequence. Multiple dinosauriforms are represented in the rock of the formation, including the silesaur &quot;Sacisaurus agudoensis&quot;, and the coeval sauropodomorph &quot;Guaibasaurus candelariensis&quot;, all of which are not found anywhere else. The 
dicynodont &quot;Jachaleria candelariensis&quot;, an unclassified phytosaur, and isolated teeth of archosaur origin can also be unearthed in the formation. A single stereospondyl amphibian is known from the formation, but has not yet been identified specifically.

An extremely rich amount of small tetrapods have been recovered from the Caturrita Formation, which is quite surprising. They measure less than long. Species preserved are the procolophonid &quot;Soturnia caliodon&quot;, the lepidosaur &quot;Cargninia enigmatica&quot;, the sphenodontid &quot;Clevosaurus brasiliensis&quot;, and some small therapsids coexisting with &quot;Faxinalipterus minima&quot;, a putative pterosaur. The therapsids include &quot;Riograndia guaibensis&quot;, &quot;Brasilodon quadrangularis&quot;, and &quot;Irajatherium hernandezi&quot; .

<doc id="1238548" wikidata="Q3132641" url="?curid=1238548" title="Henry Blodget">
<text>Henry McKelvey Blodget (born 1966) is an American businessman, investor and journalist. He is notable for his former career as an equity research analyst who was senior Internet analyst for CIBC Oppenheimer and the head of the global Internet research team at Merrill Lynch during the dot-com era. Blodget was charged with civil securities fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and settled the charges. Blodget is the co-founder and former CEO of &quot;Business Insider&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Blodget was born and raised on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, the son of a commercial banker. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Yale University, where he was a member of The Society of Orpheus and Bacchus.

After college, he taught English in Japan, then moved to San Francisco to be a writer while supporting himself by giving tennis lessons. He was also a freelance journalist and a proofreader for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

==Investment career==
In 1994, Blodget joined the corporate finance training program at Prudential Securities, and, two years later, moved to Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in equity research. In October 1998, he predicted that the common stock of Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) then trading at $240, would be priced at $400 within a year. This was thought highly unlikely at the time; however, just three weeks later Amazon&#x27;s stock price passed that mark, a gain of 67%. This call received significant media attention. Two months later, Blodget accepted a position at Merrill Lynch, and frequently appeared on CNBC and similar shows.

In early 2000, days before the dot-com bubble burst, Blodget personally invested $700,000 in tech stocks, only to lose most of it in the years that followed. He accepted a buyout offer from Merrill Lynch and left the firm in 2001. Subsequently, he was charged with civil securities fraud regarding actions taken while at 
Merrill Lynch.

==Fraud allegation and settlement==
In 2003, Blodget was charged with civil securities fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. and settled the charges with a payment of $4 million without admitting or denying the allegations and their underlying facts and findings. He was permanently barred from the securities industry and by the SEC, NASD, and NYSE.

The charges arose from actions Blodget took from 1999-2001 while at Merrill Lynch, which included issuing materially misleading research reports on internet companies, and making exaggerated or unwarranted claims about them to customers.

==Writing==
Following his departure from the financial markets, Blodget resumed his career as a financial and economics writer. He was appointed CEO of Cherry Hill Research, a research and consulting firm, and contributed to &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;Newsweek International&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, Forbes Online, &quot;Business 2.0&quot;, &quot;Euromoney&quot;, &quot;New York&quot; magazine, and &quot;The Financial Times&quot;.

Blodget rose to prominence again as co-founder, CEO, and editor-in-chief of &quot;Business Insider&quot; (initially known as &quot;Silicon Alley Insider&quot;) in 2007. He was also a frequent contributor to the Seeking Alpha website at the same time. While CEO and owner of &quot;Business Insider&quot;, he offered free reproduction of all content to readers under Creative Commons licensing. In 2014, Jeffrey Bezos purchased a stake in &quot;Business Insider&quot;.
In November 2023, it was reported that Blodget would no longer be the CEO of &quot;Business Insider&quot;. He no longer contributes articles to &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and &quot;New York&quot; magazine. Blodget&#x27;s articles focus on the return-limiting actions of individual investors, including listening to analysts and the financial media, and relying on active management such as mutual and hedge funds. His &quot;Slate&quot; articles about investing carry a seven-paragraph disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

In January 2007, Blodget published &quot;The Wall Street Self-Defense Manual: A Consumer&#x27;s Guide to Intelligent Investing&quot;.

==Internet broadcaster==
Blodget used to co-host the &quot;Daily-Ticker&quot; broadcast with Aaron Task weekdays at Yahoo! Finance.

<doc id="1238550" wikidata="Q6018862" url="?curid=1238550" title="Index of dissimilarity">
<text>The index of dissimilarity is a demographic measure of the evenness with which two groups are distributed across component geographic areas that make up a larger area. A group is evenly distributed when each geographic unit has the same percentage of group members as the total population. The index score can also be interpreted as the percentage of one of the two groups included in the calculation that would have to move to different geographic areas in order to produce a distribution that matches that of the larger area. The index of dissimilarity can be used as a measure of segregation. A score of zero (0%) reflects a fully integrated environment; a score of 1 (100%) reflects full segregation. In terms of black–white segregation, a score of .60 means that 60 percent of blacks would have to exchange places with whites in other units to achieve an even geographic distribution. Index of dissimilarity is invariant to relative size of group.

==Basic formula==
The basic formula for the index of dissimilarity is:
:formula_1

where (comparing a black and white population, for example):
:&quot;ai&quot; = the population of group A in the &quot;i&quot;th area, e.g. census tract
:&quot;A&quot; = the total population in group A in the large geographic entity for which the index of dissimilarity is being calculated.
:&quot;bi&quot; = the population of group B in the &quot;i&quot;th area
:&quot;B&quot; = the total population in group B in the large geographic entity for which the index of dissimilarity is being calculated.

The index of dissimilarity is applicable to any categorical variable (whether demographic or not) and because of its simple properties is useful for input into multidimensional scaling and clustering programs. It has been used extensively in the study of social mobility to compare distributions of origin (or destination) occupational categories.

== Numerical Example ==
Consider the following distribution of white and black population across neighborhoods. 
==Linear algebra perspective==
The formula for the Index of Dissimilarity can be made much more compact and meaningful by considering it from the perspective of Linear algebra. Suppose we are studying the distribution of rich and poor people in a city (e.g. London). Suppose our city contains formula_2 blocks:

formula_3

Let&#x27;s create a vector formula_4 which shows the number of rich people in each block of our city:

formula_5

Similarly, let&#x27;s create a vector formula_6 which shows the number of poor people in each block of our city:

formula_7

Now, the formula_8-norm of a vector is simply the sum of (the magnitude of) each entry in that vector. That is, for a vector formula_9, we have the formula_8-norm:

formula_11

If we denote formula_12 as the total number of rich people in our city, than a compact way to calculate formula_12 would be to use the formula_8-norm:

formula_15

Similarly, if we denote formula_16 as the total number of poor people in our city, then:

formula_17

When we divide a vector formula_18 by its norm, we get what is called the normalized vector or Unit vector formula_19:

formula_20

Let us normalize the rich vector formula_4 and the poor vector formula_6:

formula_23

formula_24

We finally return to the formula for the Index of Dissimilarity (formula_25); it is simply equal to one-half the formula_8-norm of the difference between the vectors formula_27 and formula_28:

 - \hat{\mathbf{p}}|_1&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = rgb(0,115,207)
|background colour = rgb(0,115,207,10%)}}

=== Numerical example ===
Consider a city consisting of four blocks of 2 people each. One block consists of 2 rich people. One block consists of 2 poor people. Two blocks consist of 1 rich and 1 poor person. What is the index of dissimilarity for this city?

Firstly, let&#x27;s find the rich vector formula_4 and poor vector formula_6:

formula_31

formula_32

Next, let&#x27;s calculate the total number of rich people and poor people in our city:

formula_33

formula_34

Next, let&#x27;s normalize the rich and poor vectors:

formula_35

formula_36

We can now calculate the difference formula_37:

formula_38

Finally, let&#x27;s find the index of dissimilarity (formula_25):

formula_40

===Equivalence between formulae===
We can prove that the Linear Algebraic formula for formula_25 is identical to the basic formula for formula_25. Let&#x27;s start with the Linear Algebraic formula:

formula_43

Let&#x27;s replace the normalized vectors formula_4 and formula_6 with:

formula_46

Finally, from the definition of the formula_8-norm, we know that we can replace it with the summation:

formula_48

Thus we prove that the linear algebra formula for the index of dissimilarity is equivalent to the basic formula for it:

formula_49

=== Zero segregation ===
When the Index of Dissimilarity is zero, this means that the community we are studying has zero segregation. For example, if we are studying the segregation of rich and poor people in a city, then if formula_50, it means that:
*There are no blocks in the city which are &quot;rich blocks&quot;, and there are no blocks in the city which are &quot;poor blocks&quot;
*There is a homogeneous distribution of rich and poor people throughout the city

If we set formula_50 in the linear algebraic formula, we get the necessary condition for having zero segregation:

formula_52

For example, suppose you have a city with 2 blocks. Each block has 4 rich people and 100 poor people:

formula_53

formula_54

Then, the total number of rich people is formula_55, and the total number of poor people is formula_56. Thus:

formula_57

formula_58

Because formula_52, thus this city has zero segregation.

As another example, suppose you have a city with 3 blocks:

formula_60

formula_61

Then, we have formula_62 rich people in our city, and formula_63 poor people. Thus:

formula_64

formula_65

Again, because formula_52, thus this city also has zero segregation.

<doc id="1238552" wikidata="Q487894" url="?curid=1238552" title="Anatoliy Golitsyn">
<text>Anatoliy Mikhaylovich Golitsyn CBE (Russian: Анатолий Михайлович Голицын; 25 August 1926 – 29 December 2008) was a Soviet KGB defector and author of two books about the long-term deception strategy of the KGB leadership. He was born in Pyriatyn, USSR. He provided &quot;a wide range of intelligence to the CIA on the operations of most of the &#x27;Lines&#x27; (departments) at the Helsinki and other residencies, as well as KGB methods of recruiting and running agents.&quot; He became an American citizen by 1984.

==Defection==
Golitsyn worked in the strategic planning department of the KGB in the rank of Major. In 1961 under the name &quot;Ivan Klimov&quot; he was assigned to the Soviet embassy in Helsinki, Finland, as vice counsel and attaché. He defected with his wife and daughter to the Central Intelligence Agency via Helsinki on 15 December 1961. They flew &quot;with a CIA escort from Finland to Sweden and thence to the United States via Frankfurt am Main, Germany, arriving on 18 December 1961&quot;. He was interviewed by James Jesus Angleton, CIA counter-intelligence director. In January 1962, the KGB sent instructions to Rezidentura throughout the world on the actions required to minimize the damage. All meetings with important agents were to be suspended.

In November 1962, KGB head Vladimir Semichastny approved a plan for the assassination of Golitsyn and other &quot;particularly dangerous traitors&quot; including Igor Gouzenko, Nikolay Khokhlov, and Bogdan Stashinsky. The KGB made significant efforts to discredit Golitsyn by promoting disinformation that he was involved in illegal smuggling operations.

Golitsyn provided information about many famous Soviet agents including Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess, John Vassall, double agent Aleksander Kopatzky who worked in Germany, and others. While unable to identify some agents like Philby specifically by name, Golitsyn provided sufficient information that SIS was able to determine the culprits. Thus, Golitsyn&#x27;s defection in 1961 set in motion the process that definitively confirmed Philby as a Soviet mole.

==Controversies==
Golitsyn was a figure of significant controversy in the Western intelligence community. The military writer General Sir John Hackett and former CIA counter-intelligence director James Angleton identified Golitsyn as &quot;the most valuable defector ever to reach the West&quot;. However, the official historian for MI5, Christopher Andrew, described him as an &quot;unreliable conspiracy theorist&quot;. Andrew believes that although intelligence data provided by Golitsyn were reliable, some of his global political assessments of the Soviet and KGB strategy are questionable. In particular, he disputed the Golitsyn claim that the &quot;Sino-Soviet split was a charade to deceive the West&quot;.

===Accusing Harold Wilson===

Golitsyn said that Harold Wilson (then prime minister of the United Kingdom) was a KGB informer and an agent of influence. This encouraged pre-existing conspiracy theories within the British security services concerning Wilson. During his time as president of the Board of Trade in the late 1940s, Wilson had been on trade missions to Russia and cultivated a friendship with Anastas Mikoyan and Vyacheslav Molotov. He continued these relationships when Labour went into Opposition, and according to material from the Mitrokhin Archive, his insights into British politics were passed to and highly rated by the KGB. An &quot;agent development file&quot; was opened in the hope of recruiting Wilson, and the codename &quot;OLDING&quot; was given to him. However &quot;the development did not come to fruition,&quot; according to the KGB file records.

Golitsyn also accused the KGB of poisoning Hugh Gaitskell, Wilson&#x27;s predecessor as leader of the Labour Party, in order for Wilson to take over the party. Gaitskell died after a sudden attack of lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disorder, in 1963. Golitsyn&#x27;s claims about Wilson were believed in particular by the senior MI5 counterintelligence officer Peter Wright. Although Wilson was repeatedly investigated by MI5 and cleared of this accusation, individuals within the service continued to believe that he was an agent of the KGB, and this belief played a part in coup plots against him.

===Accusing Urho Kekkonen===
Golitsyn said after his defection that the Note Crisis of 1961 was an operation masterminded by Finnish president Urho Kekkonen together with the Soviets to ensure Kekkonen&#x27;s re-election. Golitsyn further said that Kekkonen had been a KGB agent codenamed &quot;Timo&quot; since 1947. Most Finnish historians believe that Kekkonen was closely connected with the KGB, but the matter remains controversial.

===Golitsyn and Nosenko===
Golitsyn had said from the very beginning that the KGB would send a false defector to the US to try to discredit him. In January of 1964, Yuri Nosenko, a Golitsyn-discrediting putative KGB officer who had defected &quot;in place&quot; to the CIA in 1962 in Geneva, returned there, once again as the ostensible security officer of a Soviet arms control delegation, and, as promised, recontacted his CIA case officers, Tennent H. Bagley and Russian-born George Kisevalter. Nosenko proceeded to tell them that he now wanted to physically defect to the US (and leave his previously beloved wife and two daughters behind in Moscow) because he allegedly feared that the KGB was aware of his treason. Bagley, having read Golitsyn&#x27;s CIA file shortly after his and Kisevalter&#x27;s June 1962 meetings with him, knew that what Nosenko had told them about KGB penetrations of Western intelligence services overlapped (and contradicted) what Golitsyn had told the CIA. Bagley had thought this strange, because Nosenko and Golitsyn had worked in different parts of the highly compartmentalized KGB and therefore would not have been privy to the same information. Bagley also did not believe that the KGB would have allowed Nosenko to travel to Geneva in 1964 if it suspected him of spying for the CIA. For these and other reasons Bagley came to believe that Nosenko was a false defector, originally sent to the CIA in Geneva to discredit and deflect what Golitsyn had told it. 

When Nosenko told Kisevalter and Bagley that he wanted to physically defect to the US, Bagley, who was Nosenko&#x27;s primary case officer from the beginning, stalled and suggested to him that he wait a few days while headquarters prepared for him, and Nosenko agreed. Two developments, however, hastened the process: Nosenko told Bagley and Kisevalter during that same meeting that he had been Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s case officer in the USSR, and a few days later he excitedly told them that he had just received a telegram from Moscow ordering him to return immediately (NSA later said that no such telegram had been sent). After being flown to Frankfurt and interviewed there by Soviet Russia Division chief David Murphy, Nosenko was allowed to physically defect to the US, but only because he claimed to have been privy to Oswald&#x27;s KGB file both before and after the assassination.

Judging it improbable that the KGB had not, as Nosenko claimed, interviewed former Marine radar operator Oswald, and faced with further challenges to Nosenko&#x27;s credibility (e.g., his originally telling Bagley that he was a major, then in January 1964 boasting -- with a KGB travel document that stated as much -- that he had recently been promoted to lieutenant-colonel, and eventually confessing to having been only a captain), Angleton did not object when Murphy and Bagley detained Nosenko in April of 1964. This confinement lasted sixteen months and involved austere living conditions, a minimal diet, and interrogations that were frequent and intensive. Nosenko spent an additional four months in a ten-foot by ten-foot concrete bunker in Camp Peary, and was allegedly told that this arrangement would continue for 25 years unless he confessed to being a Soviet spy.

During the three years Nosenko was detained and interrogated by the CIA, he was given three polygraph tests. According to Gerald Posner (who befriended Nosenko in 1993), he failed the first two (1964 and 1966) while under great duress, but passed the third one in 1968, which was &quot;monitored by several Agency departments.&quot; However, Nosenko&#x27;s long-term CIA case officer, Tennent H. Bagley, says in his 2007 book &quot;Spy Wars&quot; that Bruce Solie of the Office of Security (whom Professor John M. Newman believes was a KGB mole) &quot;coached&quot; Nosenko through the easy third test, and polygraph expert Richard D. Arthur said that of the three tests, the second one (which Nosenko had failed) was by far the most reliable one.

In October of 1968, Nosenko was virtually cleared by Bruce Solie via the aforementioned polygraph test and a report he had written, and a few years later the CIA declared Nosenko to be a true defector and hired him to teach counterintelligence to its new recruits.

==Golitsyn&#x27;s books==
===&quot;New Lies for Old&quot;===
In 1984, Golitsyn published the book &quot;New Lies For Old&quot;, wherein he warned about a long-term deception strategy of seeming retreat from hard-line Communism designed to lull the West into a false sense of security, and finally economically cripple and diplomatically isolate the United States. Among other things, Golitsyn stated:
The &quot;liberalization&quot; would be spectacular and impressive. Formal pronouncements might be made about a reduction in the communist party&#x27;s role: its monopoly would be apparently curtailed. An ostensible separation of powers between the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary might be introduced. The Supreme Soviet would be given greater apparent power, and the president of the Soviet Union and the first secretary of the party might well be separated. The KGB would be &quot;reformed.&quot; Dissidents at home would be amnestied; those in exile abroad would be allowed to return, and some would take up positions of leadership in government.

Sakharov might be included in some capacity in the government or allowed to teach abroad. The creative arts and cultural and scientific organizations, such as the writers&#x27; unions and Academy of Sciences, would become apparently more independent, as would the trade unions. Political clubs would be opened to nonmembers of the communist party. Leading dissidents might form one or more alternative political parties.

There would be greater freedom for Soviet citizens to travel. Western and United Nations observers would be invited to the Soviet Union to witness the reforms in action.

Angleton and Golitsyn reportedly sought the assistance of William F. Buckley, Jr. (who once worked for the CIA) in writing &quot;New Lies for Old&quot;. Buckley refused but later went on to write a novel about Angleton, &quot;Spytime: The Undoing of James Jesus Angleton&quot;.

&quot;New Lies for Old&quot; received a first edition in Portuguese in 2018.

===&quot;The Perestroika Deception&quot;===
In 1995, Anatoliy Golitsyn and Christopher Story published a book entitled &quot;The Perestroika Deception&quot; containing purported memoranda attributed to Golitsyn claiming:
*&quot;The [Soviet] strategists are concealing the secret coordination that exists and will continue between Moscow and the &#x27;nationalist&#x27; leaders of [the] &#x27;independent&#x27; republics.&quot;
*&quot;The power of the KGB remains as great as ever… Talk of cosmetic changes in the KGB and its supervision is deliberately publicized to support the myth of &#x27;democratization&#x27; of the Soviet political system.&quot;
*&quot;Scratch these new, instant Soviet &#x27;democrats,&#x27; &#x27;anti-Communists,&#x27; and &#x27;nationalists&#x27; who have sprouted out of nowhere, and underneath will be found secret Party members or KGB agents.&quot;

==Reactions==
In his book &quot;&quot; (Knopf, 1994), Mark Riebling stated that of 194 predictions made in &quot;New Lies For Old&quot;, 139 had been fulfilled by 1993, 9 seemed &#x27;clearly wrong&#x27;, and the other 46 were &#x27;not soon falsifiable&#x27;.

According to Russian political scientist Yevgenia Albats, Golitsyn&#x27;s book &quot;New Lies for Old&quot; claimed that &quot;as early as 1959, the KGB was working up a perestroika-type plot to manipulate foreign public opinion on a global scale. The plan was in a way inspired by the teachings of the 6th-century BC. Chinese theoretician and military commander Sun Tsu, who said, &quot;I will force the enemy to take our strength for weakness, and our weakness for strength, and thus will turn his strength into weakness.&quot; Albats argued that the KGB was the major beneficiary of political changes in Russia, and perhaps indeed directed Gorbachev. According to her, &quot;one thing is certain: perestroika opened the way for the KGB to advance toward the very heart of power&quot; in Russia. It has been said that Mikhail Gorbachev justified his new policies as a necessary step to &quot;hug Europe to death&quot;, and to &quot;evict the United States from Europe&quot;.

According to Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky, &quot;In 1992 I had unprecedented access to Politburo and Central Committee secret documents which have been classified, and still are even now, for 30 years. These documents show very clearly that the whole idea of turning the European common market into a federal state was agreed between the left-wing parties of Europe and Moscow as a joint project which Gorbachev in 1988–89 called our &#x27;common European home&#x27;.&quot; (interview by &quot;The Brussels Journal&quot;, February 23, 2006).

On 8 June 1995 the British Conservative Member of Parliament Christopher Gill quoted &quot;The Perestroika Deception&quot; during a House of Commons debate, saying: &quot;It stretches credulity to its absolute bounds to think that suddenly, overnight, all those who were Communists will suddenly adopt a new philosophy and belief, with the result that everything will be different. I use this opportunity to warn the House and the country that that is not the truth&quot;; and: &quot;Every time the House approves one of these collective agreements, not least treaties agreed by the collective of the European Union, it contributes to the furtherance of the Russian strategy.&quot;

According to Daniel Pipes, Golitsyn&#x27;s publications &quot;had some impact on rightist thinking in the United States&quot;.

Golitsyn&#x27;s views are echoed by Czech dissident and politician Petr Cibulka, who has alleged that the 1989 Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia was staged by the communist StB secret police.

==In popular culture==

The 1996 American film &quot;&quot; featured a fictionalized character based on Anatoliy Golitsyn named Alexander Golitsyn, played by actor Marcel Iureș.

<doc id="1238559" wikidata="Q724694" url="?curid=1238559" title="Live Killers">
<text>Live Killers is a double live album by the British rock band Queen, released on 22 June 1979. The album was recorded live during the European leg of Queen&#x27;s Jazz Tour, between 26 January and 1 March 1979.

==Recording==
The album was self-produced by the band and was their first to be mixed at their own studios, Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland. Guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor later revealed on the US radio show &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; (which spotlighted the making of 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Game&quot;) that the band had mixed &quot;Live Killers&quot; themselves and were unhappy with the final mix.

==Release==
&quot;Live Killers&quot; was released as a double vinyl album in the UK by EMI on 22 June 1979, in Europe by Parlophone, and in the US by Elektra and Hollywood Records.

In the territories outside of the United States, Europe and Canada, Elektra Records
re-released a shorter and edited version of the album in 1985 titled &quot;Queen Live&quot;.

The 1994 issue released as part of the Digital Master Series by EMI Records did not improve upon the quality of the previous release. It was later remastered and restored in better quality by Peter Mew in 2001.

==Reception==
The album reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart and number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, and is certified double platinum in the US.

The album received negative reviews from critics on release. In a retrospective appraisal, Greg Prato of AllMusic found the initial reaction inexplicable, calling the album &quot;an excellent document of Queen at the height of their &#x27;70s arena rock powers&quot;.

==Omitted tracks==

<doc id="1238561" wikidata="Q7346349" url="?curid=1238561" title="Robert Killigrew">
<text>Sir Robert Killigrew (1580–1633) was an English courtier and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1601 and 1629. He served as Ambassador to the United Provinces.

==Life==
Killgrew was born at Lothbury, London, the son of William Killigrew and his wife Margery (Mary) Saunders, daughter of Thomas Saunders of Uxbridge, Middlesex. In January 1591, he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford at the age of 11. He travelled abroad in 1596 and may have become an official of the Privy Chamber in 1601. He was elected MP for St Mawes in 1601.

Killigrew was knighted by King James I in 1603. In 1604 he was elected MP for Newport. It is possible that he travelled to Jamestown in 1604. His name appears in the as a backer. In 1606 he was appointed ambassador to the United Provinces.

In June 1612, Killigrew was noted as &quot;one of Carr&#x27;s favourites&quot; according to John Chamberlain. The following May, he was committed to the Fleet Prison for an unknown offence. Having become famous for his concoctions of drugs and cordials, he was at first suspected of complicity in the death of Sir Thomas Overbury in September 1613, but was subsequently officially exonerated.

In 1614, Killigrew was elected MP for Helston. On 12 May that year, he was involved in an altercation in the House of Commons. In July, he was appointed Keeper of Pendennis Castle, Falmouth, Cornwall, and a JP that same year. He is recorded as fighting a duel with Captain Burton in 1618. In October that year he was appointed an Officer of Protonotary of Chancery, and in December the following year was mentioned favourably by Buckingham.

In 1621, Killigrew was elected again MP for Newport. In 1622 he succeeded his father to become farmer of the profits from seals in King&#x27;s bench and common pleas which was worth at least £560 a year. He was elected MP for Penryn and was appointed Deputy Lieutenant for Cornwall in 1624. In 1625 he was elected MP for Cornwall. He was also appointed Ambassador to the United Provinces in September 1625, but this was not taken up by December that year. In 1626, he was elected MP for Tregony in 1626. In 1628 he was elected MP for Bodmin and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. He was appointed Vice-Chamberlain to Queen Henrietta Maria in 1630.

Killigrew was a knight of Arwenack in Falmouth, Cornwall. He died a wealthy man in 1633 in Bath, Somerset, with the probate of his will on 12 May.

<text>The Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis Party (G–LC) is a political third party in the U.S. state of Minnesota created by Oliver Steinberg in 2014 to oppose cannabis prohibition. G–LC is a democratic socialist party with a background branching from the Grassroots Party established in 1986.

Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis Party attained major party status in Minnesota in 2018 when their Attorney General candidate, who dropped out of the race to support the Democratic candidate, but whose name nevertheless remained on ballots, received 5.7 percent of the vote.

In 2022, Minnesota G–LC resumed minor party status, when none of their candidates got 5% of votes, which is required for major party ballot access in the state. However their candidate for Minnesota State Auditor received more than 1% of votes, in 2022, maintaining minor party status for G–LC until 2026.

==History==
In 2014, the Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis Party was established by Oliver Steinberg because Steinberg and Chris Wright were unwilling to join the rest of the Grassroots Party when they merged with the Minnesota Legal Marijuana Now Party. In the 2014 race for governor, Wright received 31,259 votes. The party also ran a candidate for State Auditor, in 2014, who received 55,132 votes.

The Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis Party nominated their candidates by petition in 2018 to run for Governor of Minnesota, as well as in the race for Minnesota Attorney General, the results of which earned the group major-party status in Minnesota. A few weeks before the election, the Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis candidate for Attorney General, Noah Johnson, dropped out of the race to support Democratic/Farmer-Labor candidate Keith Ellison who was embroiled in scandal, though Johnson&#x27;s name remained on the ballot.

Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis Party founder Oliver Steinberg, who previously ran as a Republican candidate and a Grassroots candidate, had a background of violence discrediting the peace movement in the 1970s. Steinberg was the Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis candidate for United States Senator in 2020.

Perennial Republican candidate Rae Hart Anderson was nominated by Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis Party voters in the August 11 primary to run for United States Representative in Minnesota&#x27;s 7th congressional district on November 3, 2020.

===Gubernatorial candidates===
The Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis Party nominated their candidates by petition in 2014 to run for Governor of Minnesota. In the race for governor, Chris Wright received 31,259 votes.

In 2018, Wright again was nominated by petition to run for Minnesota Governor, and received 68,664 votes in the November general election. Wright resigned as G–LC chairperson to seek Minnesota Legal Marijuana Now Party’s nomination for Governor in 2022.

Steve Patterson, a Brownsdale businessman and opponent of Governor Tim Walz&#x27;s COVID-19 lockdown, who blamed these forced closings for hurting small businesses, including his own Rochester beer taproom startup, was nominated in the August, 2022, G–LC gubernatorial primary, and advanced to the general election, getting 22,598 votes, less than one percent, on November 8. In addition to legalizing cannabis for personal use, Patterson supported reducing income taxes for working class people.

===Conflict with Democratic Party===
Even though Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis candidates have dropped out of running to support Democratic candidates in some tight races and party leaders have withheld the state party&#x27;s endorsement of some Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis candidates when they thought doing so might hurt the chances of winning for struggling DFLers, several times Democratic Party leaders have accused the Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis Party of making it hard for Democratic candidates in Minnesota. However, a &quot;St. Cloud Times&quot; analysis of votes cast in the November 2020 election found that Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis candidates took at least as many, if not more, votes from Republicans than they took from DFL candidates.

===2021–2023===
In 2021, Kevin Shores told a FOX 9 television reporter that he was recruited to run for Congress from Minnesota&#x27;s 7th district, where Democratic incumbent Collin Peterson lost the race to Republican challenger Michelle Fischbach, in 2020, by a Republican strategist who Shores mistakenly thought was a G–LC representative. Shores, who is blind and suffers from Gulf War syndrome, lost to Hart Anderson in the Grassroots–Legalize Cannabis Party primary.

When a Luverne man who had been endorsed by G–LC was unable to file before the deadline, attorney Haroun McClellan filed to run in the August 9, 2022, 1st congressional district special election as a last-minute replacement. McClellan, a graduate of Georgia State University College of Law and former Hennepin County public defender, is contracts manager of a Rochester construction firm.

====Conflict with Democratic Party renewed====
Before Minnesota’s May, 2022, deadline to file such a change, a DFL activist, Marcus Harcus, who was 2020 G–LC nominee for District 59A state representative, attempted to hold a G–LC party meeting for the purpose of changing the state party’s name to a name the activist thought might help the Democratic Party by attracting Republicans.

In May 2022, G–LC chair Steinberg told a &quot;Star Tribune&quot; reporter about being worried that voters “perhaps aren’t quite as well-informed as it would be good for them to be.” Later in June, 2022, Steinberg said in an interview that he was frustrated about having former Libertarian candidates running under the G–LC party banner.

====2022 gubernatorial primary====
Minnesota G–LC Party held a gubernatorial primary on August 9, 2022, between Steve Patterson &amp; Matt Huff and Darrell Paulsen &amp; Ed Engelmann. Patterson was nominated by G–LC voters and defeated Paulsen, receiving 59% of the party&#x27;s vote, to advance onto the November 8, 2022, state general election.

====Resuming minor party status====
The G–LC Party ran statewide candidates in 2020 and 2022 but none received 5% of votes required for major party ballot access in Minnesota. The party got enough votes, more than 1%, in the Minnesota State Auditor race, in 2022, to retain official minor party privileges, including state public funding.

====2023 Minnesota Senate Public Safety Committee hearings====
Testifying in favor of Minnesota Senate File 73 to create a regulated commercial cannabis market, in front of the Public Safety Committee in January 2023, that marijuana prohibition has not kept people from using the drug, but has &quot;succeeded perhaps in terrorizing or intimidating citizens, in canceling civil liberties, blighting both urban and rural communities, all without eradicating the outlawed substance,&quot; said G–LC Party chair Steinberg. in May 2023, Steinberg wrote &quot;I salute DFL lawmakers who finally understood that cannabis prohibition never was necessary; always was unjust and unjustifiable; and always lacked moral authority because it was actually designed to serve as a legal mechanism for racial repression.&quot;

According to political scholar William Labovitch, Minnesota&#x27;s marijuana political parties, G–LC and LMN, are the ones responsible for the DFL party championing SF 73.

<doc id="1238586" wikidata="Q547454" url="?curid=1238586" title="Liam Lawrence">
<text>Liam Lawrence (born 14 December 1981) is a former professional footballer who played as a right winger.

Lawrence started his career at his local club Mansfield Town, after impressing at the Field Mill he signed for Sunderland in June 2005. He joined Stoke City, on loan in 2006, and made his move permanent in January 2007. He became a key player for Stoke, and helped the club to promotion to the Premier League in 2008, earning himself Player of the Year award. In September 2010, he signed for Portsmouth on loan, and signed permanently in the January transfer window. With Portsmouth in financial difficulties he spent time out on loan at Cardiff City and joined Greek side PAOK in the summer of 2012. He then returned to England for a brief spell at Barnsley in 2014 before joining Shrewsbury Town, captaining the side to promotion to League One in his only full season before a free transfer to Bristol Rovers.

Born in England, Lawrence made his international debut for the Republic of Ireland in 2009, and earned 15 caps in a two-year spell.

==Club career==
===Mansfield Town===
Lawrence was born in Retford, Nottinghamshire, and joined Mansfield Town&#x27;s youth team in 1996. He progressed the through to the first team making his professional debut against Blackpool in the Football League Trophy in the 1999–2000 season. He played 18 matches in 2000–01 scoring four goals as Mansfield finished in 13th position. In 2001–02 he made 37 appearances as the Stags gained promotion to the third tier however relegation was suffered in the following 2002–03 season with Lawrence playing in 46 matches scoring 12 goals. In 2003–04 Lawrence played in 52 games and scored 21 goals for the club helping then to reach the play-offs. After over coming Northampton Town on penalties Mansfield faced Huddersfield Town in the final. After a 0–0 draw they faced another penalty shootout but Mansfield lost 4–1 with Lawrence missing his penalty.

===Sunderland===
Lawrence joined Sunderland in June 2004 for a fee of £175,000. Lawrence had a promising first season at Sunderland, scoring 6 goals in 32 appearances, including two superb strikes against Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Stadium of Light on 2 November 2004. He also helped create one of the most important goals in Sunderland&#x27;s season, scored by Marcus Stewart, against Wigan Athletic at the JJB Stadium. Sunderland won the Championship in 2004–05 and gained promotion to the Premier League.

Following Sunderland&#x27;s promotion to the top flight Lawrence found himself in and out of the first team squad for the first few months of the 2005–06 season. Despite this, Lawrence still made 23 starts and 10 substitute appearances for the club, scoring against Fulham, Chelsea, and Sunderland&#x27;s bitter rivals Newcastle United at St James&#x27; Park. Although the season ended in disaster for Sunderland, who were relegated with a then record low of 15 points, Lawrence ended the season as runner up to teammate Dean Whitehead for the annual Player of the Year award, and was seen as one of Sunderland&#x27;s better performers. Lawrence and Whitehead both signed new contracts in August 2006.

===Stoke City===
Lawrence joined Stoke City initially on loan in November 2006 after falling out of favour with Roy Keane with the deal becoming permanent in January 2007. He made a fine start to his Stoke career scoring against Cardiff City and Ipswich Town. In 2006–07 Stoke narrowly missed out on the play-offs finishing in 8th position. In 2007–08 Lawrence played in 44 matches scoring 15 goals as Stoke gained promotion to the Premier League in 2nd position. Lawrence struck a great partnership with Ricardo Fuller and the pair scored a combined total of 30 goals with Lawrence winning the player of the year award.

Lawrence scored Stoke&#x27;s first home goal in the Premier League in 2008 when he scored a penalty against Aston Villa. However Lawrence injured himself when he tripped over his pet Labrador damaging his ankle. He had to undergo ankle surgery to repair a tear in the ligament. He returned from injury towards the end of the season and scored winning goals in games against Blackburn Rovers and Hull City, with the latter securing Stoke&#x27;s survival. Lawrence signed a new contract at Stoke in July 2009 keeping him at the Britannia Stadium until 2013. Lawrence found himself in and out of the side in 2009–10 making 25 league appearances of which 11 were as a substitute and he scored once against Hull City in April. After the season ended Lawrence stated that he expected to leave Stoke during the summer of 2010.

===Portsmouth===
On 31 August, the summer transfer window deadline day, Lawrence and Stoke teammate Dave Kitson were a part of an exchange deal, which sent Portsmouth defender Marc Wilson to &quot;the Potters&quot;, with the pair moved in the opposite direction. The deal was supposedly completed and the two Stoke players arrived at Fratton Park, but paperwork was not submitted in time for the transfer to go through. He eventually made an emergency-loan move to &quot;Pompey&quot; on 9 September Lawrence made his Portsmouth debut on 11 September in a 0–0 draw with Ipswich at Fratton Park. He scored his first goal for the club against Leicester City in the Football League Cup on 21 September. On 24 September, he scored his first league goals, a penalty and a deflected free kick in their 6–1 league win over Leicester City. On 2 October, Lawrence scored a late equaliser as Portsmouth drew 2–2 with Middlesbrough at the Riverside to notch up his fourth Portsmouth goal in just seven matches. On 30 October, he netted the winner from inside the box as Pompey beat Nottingham Forest 2–1 at Fratton Park.

On 1 January 2011, Lawrence completed his permanent move to Portsmouth, signing until the summer of 2014. Following Portsmouth&#x27;s plunge into administration, Lawrence insisted that he would not walk out on the club, but manager Michael Appleton said that Portsmouth could not afford to scan the injured calf of Lawrence as the Rudimentary payments for injury assessments could also not be completed. He left Portsmouth on 10 August 2012 after agreeing to a compromise deal to terminate his contract.

===Cardiff City===
Lawrence joined Championship rivals Cardiff City on loan till the end of the season as Portsmouth&#x27;s dire financial situation meant they needed to take cost-cutting measures. He went on to make his debut on 7 March against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, where he set up the second goal for Cardiff. He scored his first goal for the club on 14 April in a 1–0 win over Barnsley.

Lawrence was interested in making the move permanent but manager Malky Mackay stated that he was interested but signing him wasn&#x27;t priority. On 8 August 2012, Cardiff had opened talks with Lawrence over a possible permanent transfer as Portsmouth needed to clear the wage bill by 10 August or be liquidated. After leaving Portsmouth, Lawrence revealed he was offered a new contract with his wages reduced (60 or 70 per cent cut) but he was told by administrator Trevor Birch the negotiations was withdrawn as the club couldn&#x27;t afford an offer from Balram Chainrai as he attempted to purchase the club Previously, Lawrence was keen to stay at the club, insisting he doesn&#x27;t want to be responsible for liquidating the club

===PAOK===
After leaving Portsmouth on 13 August Lawrence agreed to join Greek side PAOK on a two-year contract. Lawrence would wear number 20 on his jersey. He made his official debut for the club on 23 August 2012 in a 2–1 home win against Rapid Wien. On 16 September 2012 he scored his first goal for the club against Asteras Tripoli. He scored a magnificent volley against fierce rivals Aris in a 4–1 home win. In his first season in the club he got sent-off twice, in matches against Aris and AEK.

===Barnsley===
Lawrence joined Championship side Barnsley on 16 January 2014, signing a contract until the end of the 2013–14 season. He played 14 times for the Tykes scoring once as the side suffered relegation and at the end of the campaign he was not offered a new contract at Oakwell.

===Shrewsbury Town===
On 4 July 2014, Lawrence signed a two-year contract with League Two side Shrewsbury Town. He made his competitive debut on the first day of the league season on 9 August, as the captain, and set up James Collins in the 9th minute to open a 2–2 draw away to AFC Wimbledon.

Having been sent off in a match against Northampton Town two weeks later, and subsequently serving a three-match suspension, Lawrence did not immediately regain his place in the side, having to wait until he was recalled for a League Cup third round tie at home against Norwich City on 23 September 2014. Lawrence had a hand in the winning goal, as his second-half free kick was headed on by Jermaine Grandison, for James Collins to loop over Norwich goalkeeper Declan Rudd.

He scored his first goal for Shrewsbury on 1 November 2014, converting an injury time penalty away from home against Dagenham and Redbridge to seal a 2–1 win, extending the club&#x27;s winning sequence in League Two to five matches, following this with the only goal of the game as Shrewsbury defeated Walsall in an FA Cup first round replay at the New Meadow.

Lawrence scored both goals as Shrewsbury defeated Oxford United 2–0 on 21 March 2015, a 2nd-minute penalty and a 20-yard late free kick, taking his season tally to six in all competitions. A regular in the side during the season run-in, promotion to League One was secured in April 2015 after a 1–0 away win at Cheltenham Town, with the club ending the season as runners-up to Burton Albion.

===Bristol Rovers===
Lawrence did not regularly start for Shrewsbury following their promotion and, as one of the club&#x27;s higher earners, was allowed to join League Two side Bristol Rovers on a free transfer on 7 January 2016. Lawrence was picked in the Starting XI a number of times and he scored his first goal for the club as his perfectly placed Free-kick saw his side win 3–0 against Crawley Town. Lawrence helped Rovers achieve automatic promotion seeing his side reach 85 points and overtaking Accrington Stanley on the last day of the season.

He made four appearances in the 2016–17 season before being told along with five others to find a new club on 19 January 2017 and on 31 January 2017 he left the club by mutual consent.

==International career==
Lawrence is an Irish citizen through his County Kerry-born grandfather. On 16 February 2006, Lawrence received his first international call-up, for the Republic of Ireland in their friendly game against Sweden on 3 March, but spent the entire match as an unused substitute. On 18 May 2009, Lawrence was named in the Irish squad for a friendly with Nigeria and subsequently made his debut in that match ten days later. Following this, Lawrence was named in the starting eleven for Ireland&#x27;s friendly against South Africa on 8 September and scored the only goal of the game, a free kick in the 37th minute for his first international goal. Lawrence made his competitive international debut in Ireland&#x27;s penultimate 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Italy in Croke Park on 10 October, and provided an assist for his Stoke City teammate Glenn Whelan to open the scoring in the match, which ended 2–2. He also made a start against France in the first-leg of Ireland&#x27;s crucial 2010 FIFA World Cup play-off on 14 November, which France won 1–0, with Nicolas Anelka netting the only goal. He has not played for Ireland since 29 May 2011.

<text>Shiplake Lock is a lock and weir situated on the River Thames in England between the villages of Shiplake and Lower Shiplake, Oxfordshire. It is just above the points where the River Loddon joins the Thames and Shiplake Railway Bridge crosses the river. The first pound lock was built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773.

The weir is some distance upstream of the lock between the lock island and Berkshire bank.

==History==
There is reference to the weir and flash lock at this location in the 16th century when it was known as &quot;Cotterell&#x27;s&quot;, a name which persisted after the pound lock was built. It was the second downstream of the eight locks built after the Thames and Isis Navigation Act 1750 (24 Geo. 2. c. 8), and was completed in fir wood in 1773. At this time the towpath upstream was transferred from the Berkshire to the Oxfordshire bank. The lock had to be rebuilt of oak in 1787 as the fir had decayed. There were two mills on the island at this time. The lock was rebuilt again in 1874 and the weir in 1885. The lock island was purchased by the City of London Corporation for camping in 1891, and in 1907 the ruined mills were demolished. Shiplake Lock was the first lock on the Thames to have hydraulic operation installed in 1961. During the winter of 2009/2010 the wooden lock gates were replaced with steel gates at a cost of £600,000.

==The camping island==

The reason for the purchase of Shiplake Lock Island by the Corporation of London was to preserve the amenities for bathing and camping. It was managed by the corporation&#x27;s City Lands Committee. However, managing at a distance proved a problem and the island was let in perpetuity in 1914 to the Thames Conservancy. The camp was then divided into 18 plots and run by the lock keepers.

Soon after taking over, the conservancy allowed huts to be built near the tents. The use of these was restricted to cooking and they were not to be used for sleeping. (At that time, ladies were not allowed to sleep on the island at all, but had to retire to wooden huts on the Shiplake bank).

The Thames Conservancy and its successor organisations the National Rivers Authority and Environment Agency had not been prepared to give more than a one-year lease to the plotholders. However, the community remained remarkably static with plots passing down the family line. This changed in 2022 when the Environment Agency refused to renew the leases, initially claiming it was for Health &amp; Safety reasons but subsequently saying that the &#x27;site had only been enjoyed by a &quot;limited&quot; number of people and wanted to encourage a more &quot;inclusive approach&quot; to allow everyone to stay&#x27;. 

==Access to the lock==

The lock can be reached from Lower Shiplake down Mill Road, and into Mill Lane, where there is a tarmac path to the lock along the edge of a field. And from the village of Shiplake, at Shiplake Church take the chalky path down to the riverbank, past Shiplake College&#x27;s boathouse. The footpath at Shiplake then passes under the College (formerly Shiplake Court) and then the white Shiplake House.The lock is a few hundred metres along this part of the Thames Path. 

==Reach above the lock==

The river skirts Shiplake on the Oxfordshire bank and eventually passes into Sonning. Phillimore Island is just above the lock, and on the hill on the Shiplake bank is Shiplake House and also Shiplake Court (now the premises of Shiplake College). The college boat house is on the river bank at this point. Further on there is a double bend with two large islands The Lynch, and Hallsmead Ait followed by Buck Ait. On the bank opposite the Ait is St Patrick&#x27;s Stream. This stream is believed to have been a tributary stream of the River Loddon which became an outfall when the water level was raised by the building of Shiplake Lock. Apart from a small development here, the river banks are open fields to Sonning Bridge. Sonning lock is a short was upstream of the bridge, but there is a large backwater branching before the bridge on the Sonning Eye side which is crossed by Sonning Backwater Bridges.

===Thames Path===
The Thames Path stays on the Oxfordshire bank to Sonning, where it crosses the bridge to the other side and continues to Sonning Lock.

==Literature and the media==
Shiplake Lock was a favourite place for fishing for the young George Orwell and his Buddicom friends.

<text>Giuseppe Campari (8 June 1892 – 10 September 1933) was an Italian opera singer and Grand Prix motor racing driver.

==Racing career==
Born near the city of Lodi southwest of Milan, as a teenager he went to work for the Alfa Romeo automobile company. Campari&#x27;s job eventually involved test driving factory cars and his skills and interest led to his participation in competitive hillclimbing events. In 1914 the 21-year-old rookie showed his abilities with a fourth-place finish at the Targa Florio. His career was just getting going when World War I broke out and European racing came to a halt.

Following the Armistice that ended the war, racing resumed and in 1920 Campari earned his first major race win and the first for the Alfa Romeo company when he drove to victory at Mugello in Tuscany. He repeated as champion at Mugello the next year and took third place at the Targa Florio but did not earn another major championship until he captured the French Grand Prix in 1924 when he was part of a powerful three-man Alfa Romeo team with Count Gastone Brilli-Peri and Antonio Ascari in the P2 cars designed by Vittorio Jano.

The 1925 racing season was less than successful for Campari as he and the Alfa Romeo team withdrew from the French Grand Prix in July after Ascari crashed and died. In 1926, Maserati came out with the Tipo 26, its first highly competitive race car that led to Maserati winning the Constructors&#x27; title and Ernesto Maserati taking the Italian driving championship in 1927. Despite Maserati&#x27;s strong performances, Campari claimed victory for Alfa Romeo in the 1927 Coppa Acerbo.

The 1928 season saw Giuseppe Campari win his second consecutive Coppa Acerbo and his first at the Mille Miglia. He earned a second-place finish in the Targa Florio, a race he entered several times and although he frequently finished near the top, he never managed a win. The following year he repeated as champion at the Mille Miglia and along with top drivers such as Malcolm Campbell and Rudolf Caracciola, he traveled to Ireland to compete in the inaugural Irish International Grand Prix at Phoenix Park in Dublin. Run in front of more than 100,000 spectators, Campari was hit in the eye by a flying small rock but was successfully treated in hospital and the race was won by the Russian émigré, Boris Ivanowski. Campari also raced in the Tourist Trophy Races at the Ards course in Belfast where he finished second to Caracciola&#x27;s Mercedes.

In 1930, Tazio Nuvolari joined Campari on the Alfa Romeo team. After a sensational debut season, Nuvolari and Campari combined to win their first Italian Grand Prix, a victory that made them national heroes for taking the championship from the French who had won it for the past three years. That same year, Campari won his third Coppa Acerbo but for 1933 he became part of the Maserati team with Baconin Borzacchini and Luigi Fagioli. Campari won his second French Grand Prix driving for Maserati, but at age 41 was ready to retire at the end of the season.

The Italian Grand Prix on 10 September 1933 at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza in Monza, Italy was to be his last race. While leading the race, Campari was instantly killed when his car crashed after skidding in a sharp turn on a patch of leaked engine oil.

==Personal life==
In addition to his love of automobile racing, Giuseppe Campari had two other passions: food, in great quantities that he liked to prepare himself, and the opera. Blessed with a great baritone voice from the depths of an expansive paunch, he took singing lessons and while still racing began to sing professionally.

==Major victories==
* Circuit of Mugello 1920, 1921
* Coppa Acerbo 1927, 1928, 1931
* French Grand Prix 1924, 1933
* Italian Grand Prix 1931

<doc id="1238605" wikidata="Q5052162" url="?curid=1238605" title="Cathays Park">
<text>Cathays Park () or Cardiff Civic Centre is a civic centre area in the city centre of Cardiff, the capital city of Wales, consisting of a number of early 20th century buildings and a central park area, Alexandra Gardens. It includes Edwardian buildings such as the Temple of Peace, City Hall, the National Museum and Gallery of Wales and several buildings belonging to the Cardiff University campus. It also includes Cardiff Crown Court, the administrative headquarters of the Welsh Government, and the more modern Cardiff Central police station. The Pevsner architectural guide to the historic county of Glamorgan judges Cathays Park to be &quot;the finest civic centre in the British Isles&quot;. The area falls within the Cathays electoral ward and forms part of the Cathays Park Conservation Area, which was designated in 1975. 

==History==

Cathays Park was formerly part of Cardiff Castle grounds. The present day character of the area owes much to successive holders of the title the Marquess of Bute, and especially the 3rd Marquess of Bute, an extremely wealthy landowner, and to his gardener, Andrew Pettigrew. The Butes acquired much of the lands in Cathays through investment and by inheritance through a marriage to Charlotte Windsor in 1766.

The idea of acquiring the Cathays House park as an open public space was raised in 1858 and again in 1875. In 1887 it was suggested the park could commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. Negotiations did not begin until 1892, when Lord Bute agreed to sell 38 acres for £120,000 (equivalent to £ in ). The idea of relocating the Town Hall to the park was controversial, but it was also proposed to locate a new University College building there.

On 14 December 1898, the local council bought the entire of land for £161,000 from the Marquess of Bute (equivalent to £ in ). As part of the sale, the 3rd Marquis of Bute placed strict conditions on how the land was to be developed. The area was to be used for civic, cultural and educational purposes, and the avenues were to be preserved.

A six-month Cardiff Fine Arts, Industrial and Maritime Exhibition which included specially constructed boating lake, a wooden cycling track and an electric railway was held in 1896.

===The Development of the Civic Centre===

Cathays Park has had three very distinct phases of development, the first phase was built in the Edwardian Baroque style, which consisted of the University of Wales Registry, Cardiff University main building, Cardiff Crown Court, Glamorgan County Hall, Cardiff City Hall, National Museum Cardiff which was constructed from 1912, but only opened in 1927 due to World War I. The second phase was built in a more simplified classical design of the Temple of Peace, Cathays Park 1, Cardiff Technical College, now Bute Building. 

The four-storey maximum rule which was imposed by the local authority to ensure that no building in Cathays Park overshadowed the City Hall was removed. This led to the third phase of building from the 1960s, which although built in Portland stone as with the rest of the buildings in Cathays Park, was in a modernist architectural style. These included the seven-storey Biosciences building, in 1967, the twelve storey Tower building. Other buildings constructed included the Redwood Building for the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology, Cardiff Central police station, Law Building and Cathays Park 2. 

At the start of the first phase in 1897 a competition was held for a complex comprising Law Courts and a Town Hall, with Alfred Waterhouse, architect of the Natural History Museum in London, as judge. The winners were the firm of Lanchester, Stewart and Rickards, who would later go on to design the Methodist Central Hall in Westminster. These were the first two buildings of the ensemble, and have an almost uniform façade treatment. The east and west pavilions of both façades are identical in design, except for the attic storeys, which are decorated with allegorical sculptural groups. On the Crown Court these are &quot;Science and Industry&quot;, sculpted by Donald McGill, and &quot;Commerce and Industry&quot;, by Paul Raphael Montford, while on the City Hall are &quot;Music and Poetry&quot; by Paul Montford and &quot;Unity and Patriotism&quot; by Henry Poole. The courts and the town hall were followed by the main building of the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire (now Cardiff University), designed by W. D. Caröe and completed in 1905.

The third plot on the site facing City Hall lawn went empty until 1910, when the competition for a National Museum of Wales was won by the architects Arnold Dunbar Smith and Cecil Brewer. The design parts from the Edwardian Baroque of the Law Courts and City Hall and is more akin to American Beaux-Arts architecture, particularly in the entrance hall where a similarity to McKim, Mead and White&#x27;s later Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has been noted. The Museum site was not bounded to the north by an avenue so there were scarcely any limits on the depth of the building; the 1910 plan was almost twice as deep as it was broad. The First World War, however, ensured that progress on the building was very slow. By 1927 part of the East range, with the lecture theatre funded by William Reardon Smith, was complete. Further extensions came only in the 1960s and 1990s; these remained faithful to the original design on the exterior (and included sculpture by Dhruva Mistry) but are of a neutral character on the inside.

The final plots in the north of the park were occupied by government offices and university departments. The foundations for a governmental office block were laid in 1914, but work ceased almost immediately due to World War I. Construction of the Crown Buildings (now Cathays Park 1) was undertaken between 1932-38, initially as a headquarters for the Welsh Board of Health. This was followed in the 1970s by Cathays Park 2, a vast administrative block for the Welsh Office. Although the architect and town planner, John B. Hilling, in his study &quot;Black Gold, White City: The History and Architecture of Cardiff Civic Centre&quot; published in 2016, acknowledged the architects&#x27; efforts to respect Cathays Park 2&#x27;s surroundings, by use of a symmetrical plan laid out on a clear axis, the building&#x27;s Brutalist style has been much criticised. Both Hilling and the architectural historian John Newman quote the judgement of the &quot;Architects&#x27; Journal&quot;; &quot;a perversely appropriate symbol of closed inaccessible government&quot; [suggesting] a bureaucracy under siege&quot;. Cathays Park 1 and 2 have seen &#x27;Cathays Park&#x27; become used as a metonym, firstly for the Welsh Office, and after devolution in 1999, for the Welsh Government&#x27;s civil servants and ministerial offices.

The last plot on the site was occupied by the University of Wales, which constructed a series of university departments, laboratories and schools on the site from the 1950s to the very early 21st century. The development has been criticised as being too dense, the university&#x27;s appetite for accommodation outdoing the limitations of the site. Dewi-Prys Thomas, the first professor of architecture at the University of Wales, expressed dismay at, &quot;the injury done to the Civic Centre, with the colossal pile of buildings thrusting up against the main University College.&quot;

===Appreciation===
In his &quot;Glamorgan&quot; volume of the Pevsner Buildings of Wales series, Newman described Cathays Park as &quot;the finest civic centre in the British Isles&quot;. Later studies generally concur. Hilling considered the park &quot;an outstanding example of an architectural ensemble which illustrates a significant stage in Welsh history&quot;. Professor Ian Morley, historian of the built environment, considered that Cathays was &quot;matchless in terms of quality and meaning, [and helped] Cardiff punch well above its weight in terms of demographic stature&quot;. Revisiting the subject in his 2018 revised &quot;The Architecture of Wales: from the first to the twenty-first century&quot;, Hilling agreed, contending that Cathays validated, &quot;as much as anything, [Cardiff]&#x27;s claim to city status and national capital&quot;.

==Buildings==

==Gardens==

In addition to the large lawn in front of the City Hall, Cathays Park includes three formal gardens and a tree lined park. Main phases of construction of the gardens were from 1903 to 1906 and from 1924 to 1928. The gardens are grade II on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. All of the spaces are within conservation areas and many of the surrounding buildings are listed. The open spaces are very important to the image of the city. Several important buildings overlook these well kept spaces. Each of the three gardens has its own very different character and each retains its original layout. The later 20th and 21st centuries have seen the erection of a large number of memorials in the park which have generated some criticism; John Hilling attacked the &quot;ill-considered and uncoordinated way [the monuments are] scattered across the gardens&quot;.

===Alexandra Gardens===

Named after Alexandra of Denmark, the queen consort of Edward VII. The gardens were first called University Gardens, and were laid out and planted in 1903. Alexandra Gardens is garden located at the heart of the civic centre. It consists of maintained flower beds and grass, with the Welsh National War Memorial standing at its centre. Alexandra Gardens has been protected since September 2019 as a Centenary Fields, which is a Fields in Trust scheme together with the Royal British Legion, which protects green spaces containing a war memorial that honours the memory of those that lost their lives in World War I.

===Gorsedd Gardens===
The garden was originally known as Druidical Gardens, but the name Gorsedd Gardens was later adopted. The garden has as its centrepiece a stone circle constructed in 1899, when the National Eisteddfod of Wales was held in Cardiff. The stones were originally erected elsewhere in Cathays Park for the National Eisteddfod of 1899. They were re-erected in the garden in 1905. The garden&#x27;s name refers to the Gorsedd of Welsh Bards, the ceremonial order that governs the Eisteddfod. Work on the landscaped gardens began in 1904 and officially opened in July 1910 by the Lord Mayor. It is laid out with lawns, and tree and shrub borders and hedges. The gardens has statues of subjects including David Lloyd George and Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart.

The Gorsedd Gardens also contain a &quot;tree of life&quot; planted on World AIDS Day, 1 December 1994, to commemorate &quot;all those who have lost their lives to AIDS in Wales&quot;. The original plaque was replaced at the 2021 World AIDS Day commemoration event. The tree is the focus for yearly World AIDS Day commemorations, with people attaching red ribbons to the tree. The tree was also the location of Cardiff&#x27;s vigil after the murder of Brianna Ghey in February 2022.

===Friary Gardens===
Friary Gardens is a triangular formal garden, which was established as a Dutch garden. One of the strict conditions of the sale of Cathays Park by the 3rd Marquess of Bute was that the trees must be preserved and that no buildings should ever be built on the site of the gardens. Work began in the autumn of 1904 and was completed by 27 September 1905, when it was handed over to the Parks Committee, although not opened to the public until 1910. For many years the gardens were known as the Dutch Garden. In 1923 the Parks Committee decided to rename it Priory Gardens. However, this name was historically incorrect and in 1928 the Parks Committee renamed it as the Friary Gardens.

It contains a statue constructed in honour of the 3rd Marquess of Bute by James Pittendrigh Macgillivray and erected in 1928. A gardeners&#x27; hut in the gardens has been converted to a coffee outlet. The gardens were originally part of Greyfriars and was sometimes known as a Priory or a Friary as it was a Franciscan friary. The friary is believed to have been founded by the Grey Friars around 1280. The Greyfriars were also known as the Friars Minor and the Franciscans. Greyfriars was demolished by order of Henry VIII in approximately 1540 as part of the dissolution of the monasteries.

===Queen Anne Square, Parc Mackenzie and City Hall Lawns===

Queen Anne Square at the very north end of the park, is a tree-lined grass square with domestic houses which was built in the 1930s and 1950s. It was designed to be aligned with the main thoroughfare of King Edward VII Avenue, on a site that was originally planned for a Welsh Parliament House. The square is enclosed by a tree-lined no through road, by Corbett Road to the south and by Aberdare Hall to the south east. 

Parc Mackenzie, which lies between the University of Wales main block and the National Museum, is the newest area of green space to be created within the park. Opened in 2023, it commemorates Millicent Mackenzie (1863–1942), the first woman professor in Wales. At the Alexandra Gardens end of the Parc Mackenzie plot stands a Grade II listed public convenience. Long disused and derelict, in 2024 planning permission was granted for its conversion into a cafe.

The City Hall Lawns have a low pool with a triple spout fountain which faces the City Hall. The fountains were created to mark the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales in July 1969. The lawns are used for temporary events, such as Cardiff&#x27;s annual Winter Wonderland and previously as part of the Cardiff Big Weekend.

<text>Philippe Charbonneaux (18 February 1917 – 4 June 1998) was a French industrial designer, best known for automobile and truck design, but also known for other products such as television sets. Many of his works are now exhibited in places such as Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, or Museum of Modern Art in New York. He specialised in car design studies, so he has left many inventive prototypes. The Ellipsis concept car, released just two years prior to his death, is still very fresh and modern. He designed for Renault, Ford, Delahaye, Berliet, Bugatti, and others.

Famous designs include the Téléavia Panoramic III TV set; the Renault 8 in 1962; the Renault 16 in 1965 (which he designed together with Gaston Juchet), an innovative family car and Europe&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1965; as well as the 1986 Renault 21.

His private collection of approximately 160 vintage cars, including racing cars, and 40 motorcycles, donated to S.C.A.R. (Salon of Vintage Car Club Collectors in Reims) is the basis for the Automobile Museum Reims-Champagne, established in 1985.

<text>Ballot Access News is a United States–based website and monthly online and print newsletter edited and published by Bill Redpath and Richard Winger.

==History==
Richard Winger, an expert on ballot access law in the United States, started the newsletter to advocate &quot;fair and equitable ballot access laws&quot; in 1985. 

On June 1, 2023, Richard Winger announced that Bill Redpath, former chair of the Libertarian National Committee, would replace him as editor of the newsletter. However, Winger continues to write as an editor.

==Content==
&quot;Ballot Access News&quot; reports on state and federal court decisions, compares American ballot access laws to those of other democratic nations, covers developments on electoral systems such as instant-runoff voting, and documents the number of votes independent and minor party candidates receive. The newsletter also records the activities of the Coalition for Free and Open Elections, an interest group of minor party members and others working together on ballot access law reform issues.

==Notable citations==
Reporting by &quot;Ballot Access News&quot; has been cited by ABC News, &quot;Politico&quot;, Reuters, and the &quot;Washington Post.&quot;

<text>Roy Anthony Hargrove (October 16, 1969 – November 2, 2018) was an American jazz musician and composer whose principal instruments were the trumpet and flugelhorn. He achieved worldwide acclaim after winning two Grammy Awards for differing styles of jazz in 1998 and 2002. Hargrove primarily played in the hard bop style for the majority of his albums, but also had a penchant for genre-crossing exploration and collaboration with a variety of hip hop, neo soul, R&amp;B and alternative rock artists. As Hargrove told one reporter, &quot;I&#x27;ve been around all kinds of musicians, and if a cat can play, a cat can play. If it&#x27;s gospel, funk, R&amp;B, jazz or hip-hop, if it&#x27;s something that gets in your ear and it&#x27;s good, that&#x27;s what matters.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life and career===

Hargrove was born in Waco, Texas, to Roy Allan Hargrove and Jacklyn Hargrove. When he was 9, his family moved to Dallas, Texas. He took lessons at school initially on cornet before turning to trumpet. One of Hargrove&#x27;s most profound early influences was a visit to his junior high school by saxophonist David &quot;Fathead&quot; Newman, who performed as a sideman in Ray Charles&#x27;s Band. Hargrove&#x27;s junior high music teacher, Dean Hill, whom Hargrove called his &quot;musical father&quot;, taught him to improvise and solo. He was discovered by Wynton Marsalis when Marsalis visited the Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas. Hargrove credited trumpeter Freddie Hubbard as having the greatest influence on his sound.

Hargrove continued his musical studies at Boston&#x27;s Berklee College of Music, but soon transferred to The New School in New York, enabling Hargrove to frequent the Greenwich Village jazz clubs and participate in jam-sessions, most notably at Bradley&#x27;s, where he played alongside many of his mentors and heroes. Hargrove&#x27;s first studio recording after relocating to New York was with saxophonist Bobby Watson, for Watson&#x27;s album &quot;No Question About It&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Hargrove recorded with the band Superblue featuring Watson, Mulgrew Miller, Frank Lacy, Don Sickler and Kenny Washington.

Hargrove&#x27;s debut album as leader, &quot;Diamond in the Rough&quot;, was released on the Novus/RCA label in 1990. This album, and the three succeeding recordings Hargrove produced for Novus with his quintet, were among the most commercially successful jazz recordings of the early 1990s and made him one of jazz&#x27;s in-demand players. It was during this time that Hargrove topped the category &quot;Rising Star–Trumpet&quot; in the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Critics Poll in 1991, 1992 and 1993 and became associated with the &quot;Young Lions&quot;, a group of rising jazz musicians — including, among others, Marcus Roberts, Mark Whitfield and Christian McBride — who, embracing the foundations of jazz, played principally bebop, hard bop and the Great American Songbook standards. Those associated with the &quot;Young Lions&quot;, including Hargrove, formed Jazz Futures, which released one critically acclaimed album, &quot;Live in Concert&quot;.

As a side project to his solo and quintet recordings, Hargrove was the leader of The Jazz Networks, an ensemble of American and Japanese musicians which released 5 albums between 1992 and 1996 and featured other notable jazz artists, including Antonio Hart, Rodney Whitaker and Joshua Redman. These albums were originally released in Japan and Europe only but, following Hargrove&#x27;s death, arrangements were made by his estate for their release on US music streaming platforms. During this period, Hargrove participated in several one-off ensemble recordings, including the albums &quot;New York Stories&quot; featuring Danny Gatton and Bobby 
Watson and &quot;Pride of Lions&quot; featuring Philip Bailey, Billy Childs and Tony Williams.

===Verve and EmArcy era===
In 1994, Hargrove signed with Verve and recorded &quot;With the Tenors of Our Time&quot; featuring Joe Henderson, Stanley Turrentine, Johnny Griffin, Joshua Redman, and Branford Marsalis. Soon afterwards, Hargrove released his second album for Verve, &quot;Family,&quot; which included his original song &quot;Roy Allan&quot;, named after his father, which thereafter became a popular jazz composition for others. That same year, in 1995, he experimented with a trio format on &quot;Parker&#x27;s Mood,&quot; an album recorded with bassist Christian McBride and pianist Stephen Scott. The Penguin Jazz Guide identifies &quot;Parker&#x27;s Mood&quot; as one of the &quot;1001 Best Albums&quot; in the history of the genre.

Also in 1995, Hargrove formed the Roy Hargrove Big Band to perform at the Panasonic Village Jazz Festival in New York. The band would go on to record and perform worldwide and feature big band arrangements of Hargrove&#x27;s own compositions as well as his favorite songs by respected contemporaries.

In 1998, Hargrove won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album for &quot;Habana&quot; with Roy Hargrove&#x27;s Crisol, an ensemble of Cuban and American musicians which included Chucho Valdés, Russell Malone, Frank Lacy, Jose Luis &quot;Changuito&quot; Quintana and Miguel &quot;Angá&quot; Díaz, among others. 

Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Hargrove collaborated with the Soulquarians, a collective of experimental jazz, hip hop and soul artists that included Questlove, D&#x27;Angelo, Common, and others. Hargrove added jazz and funk-influenced horns to D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s Grammy-winning album &quot;Voodoo&quot; and supported D&#x27;Angelo on tour as a member of the Soultronics, a backing &quot;supergroup&quot; featuring Questlove and Pino Palladino, among others. That same year, as part of the Soulquarians collective, Hargrove contributed horn performances for recordings by Common and Erykah Badu.

Also in 2000, as part of the Verizon Jazz Festival, Hargrove performed in Roz Nixon&#x27;s musical production &quot;Dedicated To Louis Armstrong.&quot; 

In 2001, Hargrove was selected as a resident artist by the Festival International de Jazz de Montreal and performed in five different ensembles during the festival: As leader of his own quintet; as leader of a &quot;special trio&quot; with Christian McBride and Russell Malone; as a sideman with Monty Alexander and his band; with McBride in a duet; and with the I Musici de Montreal Chamber Orchestra, with which he performed his album, &quot;Moment to Moment.&quot;
In 2002, Hargrove won his second Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Album for &quot;Directions in Music: Live at Massey Hall&quot; with co-leaders Herbie Hancock and Michael Brecker. Hargrove was nominated for four other Grammy Awards during his career.

Also in 2002, Hargrove collaborated with D&#x27;Angelo, Macy Gray, the Soultronics, and Nile Rodgers on two tracks for &quot;Red Hot &amp; Riot&quot;, a compilation album in tribute to the music of afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti. He also acted as a sideman for jazz vocalist/pianist Shirley Horn and supported singer Erykah Badu on her album &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot;.

From 2003 to 2006, he released three albums as the leader of Roy Hargrove&#x27;s The RH Factor, a group that blended jazz, soul, hip hop and funk idioms. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Hard Groove&quot;, was hailed as &quot;genre-busting&quot; by critics and ushered in a new era of hip hop-accented jazz. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Strength&quot;, was nominated for a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Contemporary Jazz Album.&quot;

After signing with Universal/EmArcy in 2008, Hargrove released &quot;Earfood&quot;, a quintet recording &quot;steeped in tradition and sophistication,&quot; which Jazziz selected as one of the 5 &quot;essential albums&quot; of that year. He followed in 2009 with &quot;Emergence,&quot; an album recorded with the Roy Hargrove Big Band; he received a Grammy nomination for &quot;Best Improvised Jazz Solo&quot; for his performance on the track &quot;Ms. Garvey, Ms. Garvey&quot; on that record. In 2010, Hargrove released &quot;Live at the New Morning,&quot; a DVD of an intimate club performance with his quintet in Paris. Thereafter, until his death in 2018, Hargrove did not release additional albums but toured extensively and appeared as a sideman on recordings by Jimmy Cobb, Roy Haynes, Cyrille Aimée, The 1975, D’Angelo, Johnny O&#x27;Neal, Kandace Springs and others. Hargrove told KNKX radio in 2017 that recording albums no longer made &quot;financial sense.&quot;

===Posthumous career===
In July 2021, Hargrove&#x27;s estate released posthumously via Resonance Records the double-album &quot;In Harmony&quot;, a live duet recording made in 2006 and 2007 with pianist Mulgrew Miller that returned Hargrove to the Top 5 of the Billboard jazz chart. Slate selected &quot;In Harmony&quot; as one of the best jazz albums of 2021. The Académie du Jazz awarded &quot;In Harmony&quot; its prize for &quot;Best Reissue or Best Unpublished&quot; album of 2021.

Hargrove was posthumously elected to the &quot;DownBeat Magazine&quot; &quot;Jazz Hall of Fame&quot; in November 2021.

In June 2022, the documentary &quot;Hargrove&quot;, filmed during the final year of his life, debuted at the Tribeca Festival. Hargrove&#x27;s estate issued a statement objecting to the film as not what he had envisioned when agreeing to participate.

Celebrating the 30th anniversary of its performance, in October 2023, Jazz at Lincoln Center released a live recording of Hargrove&#x27;s original composition &quot;The Love Suite: In Mahogany&quot;, a five-movement piece which he did not play again live after its debut performance in 1993. &quot;Jazziz Magazine&quot; called the album an &quot;unearthed gem&quot; that &quot;showcases the much-missed trumpeter’s virtuosity and soulful songwriting ...&quot;
Jazz critic Nate Chinen of NPR applauded the album as &quot;a flat-out marvel — maybe the most vivid example we have of Roy&#x27;s ability to marshal hard-bop fire in a new form, steeped in swinging tradition but sparking and crackling right now.&quot;

A year later, in September 2024, Verve Records announced the release of a previously-unheard archival album titled &quot;Grande-Terre&quot; by Roy Hargrove&#x27;s Crisol that had originally been recorded back in 1998. Music critic Sharonne Cohen of &quot;Everything Jazz&quot; praised the recording, noting that &quot;Grande-Terre brims with Crisol&#x27;s intricate and sophisticated arrangements, Hargrove&#x27;s explosive, imaginative and soul-stirring playing, and the band&#x27;s powerful, singular sound.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; was equally effusive about the album, noting that it &quot;shows off the high-wire, from-the-gut jazz Hargrove played most nights of his life.&quot; &quot;NPR Music&quot; included &quot;Grande-Terre&quot; among its &quot;50 Best Albums of 2024,&quot; comparing it favorably to its predecessor Habana as &quot;an even more fluent and focused celebration of Afro-Cuban musical lineage, with Hargrove and his Crisol band both in exceptionally strong form.&quot;

==Influence==
Hargrove topped the trumpet category in the 2019 &quot;DownBeat&quot; Readers’ Poll.

In addition to the accolades he garnered on trumpet, music critics praised Hargrove&#x27;s tone on flugelhorn and his gifted ways with a ballad. As the Chicago Tribune observed in 2010, &quot;it&#x27;s Hargrove&#x27;s ballad playing that tends to win hearts, which is what happened every time he picked up his flugelhorn. We&#x27;ve been hearing Hargrove spin silk on this instrument for a couple of decades now, yet one still marvels at the poetry of his tone, the incredible slowness of his vibrato and the arching lyricism of his phrases.&quot;

Over his 30-year career, Hargrove composed and recorded several original compositions, one of which, &quot;Strasbourg-St. Denis&quot;, has been characterized as reaching the status of a jazz standard.

==Personal life and death==
A quiet and retiring person in life, Hargrove struggled with kidney failure and substance abuse. He died at the age of 49 of cardiac arrest brought on by a kidney disease on November 2, 2018, while hospitalized in New Jersey. According to his long-time manager, Larry Clothier, Hargrove had been on dialysis for the last 14 years of his life. He is survived by his wife, Aida Brandes-Hargrove, and daughter, Kamala Hargrove, who in 2020 launched the company Roy Hargrove Legacy LLC to preserve and extend his legacy. In 2022, Roy Hargrove Legacy re-launched the Roy Hargrove Big Band, which gives live performances featuring original band members and other musicians who supported Hargrove in his various ensembles.

<text>Victor Oliver von Samek (8 July 1898 – 15 August 1964) was an Austrian-born British musician, entertainer, comedian and actor, most popular between the 1920s and 1950s.

==Early life and musical career==

He was born in Vienna into a Jewish family, the son of Baron Viktor von Samek. He played tennis, football and hockey as a youth and became junior tennis champion of Austria in 1914. He studied medicine at Vienna University but abandoned it for his first love, music. He had been acclaimed as a child prodigy on the violin, and for a time studied under Mahler. During the First World War he served in the Austrian cavalry as adjutant to Prince René of Bourbon-Parma, and at the end of the war escaped to France on a forged passport. 

After the war he briefly worked as a banker and for a textile manufacturer, and performed as a drummer in a jazz band in Rouen and Le Havre. He travelled to the United States at the end of 1922, and played in vaudeville shows as a pianist and occasional vocalist. He joined a jazz group, The Nine Nights of Jazz, in 1923, and the following year formed a double act with violinist Margaret Crangle. After their act broke up, in 1927 he was appointed as conductor and compere of a travelling radio show in the U.S., with a portable transmitter.

==As a comedian and musician==

In 1928, he reunited with Crangle. He discovered his gift for comedy by chance when he apologised to his audience after falling from a piano stool and found that his apologies &quot;drew more laughs than did his accident&quot;. A new career as a comedian took him all over the United States. He reached the Palace Theatre, New York, then regarded as the pinnacle of the American vaudeville circuit, in 1929. Returning to England to perform with Crangle, he played the London Palladium two years later, and started to establish his reputation in Britain. With his deferential, modest humour, he became very popular, both in Britain and America, as a solo act, and gained a reputation as &quot;a sophisticated if rather risqué cabaret artiste&quot;. He played the violin deliberately badly in his shows. By 1935, he was topping the bill at the London Palladium, and shared the record (with Max Miller) for appearances at the Holborn Empire.

He was principal comedian in C. B. Cochran&#x27;s revue &quot;Follow the Sun&quot; at the Adelphi Theatre, where he met Winston Churchill&#x27;s daughter Sarah. After Oliver returned to New York to play in the revue &quot;It&#x27;s the Tops&quot;, Churchill joined him there and they were married amid much publicity on Christmas Day 1936. Winston Churchill did not approve of Oliver, who had been divorced at least once, possibly twice. Some thought there was negativity also towards those involved with music halls.

Oliver featured in a string of popular revues, just before and after the start of the Second World War, including &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, &quot;Black Velvet&quot;, and &quot;The Night and the Music&quot;. During the war he starred in the BBC radio show &quot;Hi, Gang!&quot; and appeared in many others, including &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;Yankee Doodle Do&quot;, and &quot;Vic Oliver Introduces&quot;. He was Roy Plomley&#x27;s first &quot;castaway&quot; guest on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, on 29 January 1942. This lost broadcast was recalled in 2012 in a BBC radio documentary about Oliver&#x27;s life in Britain.

He had aspirations as a conductor and in 1944 founded the Vic Oliver Concert Orchestra, which gave light classical concerts as well as complete opera performances. He toured with the orchestra, and in 1945, and again in 1952, appeared in the Royal Variety Performance. He featured in further London revues after the end of the war, and remained a popular comedian in pantomimes and on radio shows. He was a regular on &quot;Henry Hall&#x27;s Guest Night&quot; and &quot;Workers&#x27; Playtime&quot; and, as a music-based comedian, has been considered a precursor of Victor Borge. In 1953 he established &quot;Variety Playhouse&quot; as a primetime radio show featuring music, comedy and light drama; the show did not survive him. In 1962 he appeared in &quot;Discord in Three Flats&quot; (1962) with Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert. 

==Personal life and death==
As a Jew, his name was reportedly listed on a Nazi blacklist (known as &quot;The Black Book&quot;) of people to be arrested and killed immediately in the event of a successful German invasion of Britain. He became a naturalised British subject in 1948. 

Oliver became a supporter of First Division club Brentford and was vice-president of the club in the early 1950s. He later became president of the Brentford Supporters&#x27; Club.

Oliver and Sarah Churchill divorced in 1945. It was noted that Oliver never capitalised on his relationship with Sarah Churchill, despite attractive offers. Oliver married Natalie Frances Conder in 1946 in Westminster, London, and they had one daughter.

He collapsed and died during a performance in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1964, aged 66. Relatives still live in Vienna.

==Portrayal==
Oliver was briefly portrayed in the 2002 film &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;. He was played by Gerrard McArthur.

<text>Quin Price Snyder (born October 30, 1966) is an American professional basketball coach who is the head coach for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After being named a McDonald&#x27;s All American as a high school player in Washington, he played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils. He was the head coach of the Utah Jazz for eight seasons, and is known for being both an offensive and defensive minded tactician with a passion for player development.

==Early life==
Snyder was born in Mercer Island, Washington, and graduated from Mercer Island High School in 1985. A two-time state basketball player of the year, Snyder led the team to the 1985 state championship. During this time Mercer Island achieved a No. 1 ranking in &quot;USA Today&quot;″s high school polls. Snyder was named a McDonald&#x27;s All American, the first player chosen from Washington.

==College career==
At Duke University, Snyder was a point guard for the Blue Devils from 1985 to 1989, and his team played in the Final Four in 1986, 1988, and 1989. He became a starter in his second season (1987) and started almost all games the remainder of his career. He was elected a team captain and honored as an Academic All-American during his senior season.

He graduated from Duke in 1989 with a double major in philosophy and political science, and, later received a J.D. degree from Duke Law School in 1995 and an M.B.A. degree from the Duke Fuqua School of Business in 1995.

==Coaching career==

===Los Angeles Clippers (1992–1993)===
In the middle of his graduate work, Snyder spent the NBA season as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers.

===Duke (1993–1999)===
From 1993 to 1995, Snyder served as an administrative assistant to men&#x27;s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski while Snyder completed his MBA and JD at Duke. After completing both degrees in 1995, Snyder became a full-time assistant coach under Krzyzewski. In 1997, Duke promoted Snyder to associate head coach. During Snyder&#x27;s time as a Duke assistant coach, Duke made the 1994 and 1999 NCAA tournament championship rounds and the Elite Eight round in 1998. Duke also won the ACC tournament in 1999.

===Missouri (1999–2006)===
In 1999, Snyder accepted the head coaching position for the University of Missouri Tigers men&#x27;s basketball team, succeeding longtime coach Norm Stewart. He eventually led the Tigers to four consecutive NCAA tournament berths, including the Elite Eight in 2002, matching the deepest run ever made by a Missouri team in the NCAA Tournament.

Snyder was hailed as a sensation upon his arrival at Missouri. His first team knocked off a ranked Illinois team and then defeated Kansas in Snyder&#x27;s first game against Mizzou&#x27;s archrival. Snyder&#x27;s second season was punctuated by similar success. He once again toppled a ranked Kansas team and led the Tigers to their first NCAA victory since 1995. The eventual 2001 NCAA National Champion Duke ended the Tigers&#x27; season in the NCAA Tournament. He was named Rookie Coach of the Year by the &quot;Basketball Times&quot; after the season.

In the summer of 2003, Snyder was an assistant coach for United States at the Pan American Games. In May 2004, Snyder was named in 17 allegations as a part of an NCAA investigation over recruiting violations, centering on improper gifts to guard Ricky Clemons. The program was placed on a three-year probation that November after the NCAA infractions committee ruled that an assistant bought meals, provided transportation and illegally contacted recruits. The committee rejected claims by the school that the rule violations were inadvertent, although it also dismissed charges of major violations, including the Clemons&#x27; claim that assistant coaches paid players cash. Snyder later admitted to having players at his house for &quot;an occasional meal&quot; and giving Clemons clothing.

Snyder resigned as coach on February 10, 2006, following a 26-point loss to Baylor that extended a losing streak to six and dropped the Tigers to a 10–11 record overall, 3–7 in the Big 12. He finished with a 126–91 record over seven years, reaching the NCAA tournament in each of his first four seasons but posting only a 42–42 record since. After his resignation, Snyder accused Missouri athletic director Mike Alden of sending Gary Link, a basketball analyst and assistant to Alden, to inform him that he would be fired after the season.

===Austin Toros (2007–2010)===
Following his departure from Missouri in 2006, Snyder initially gave up on coaching for good. But in May 2007, he accepted the head coaching position of the Austin Toros in the NBADL

In the first season, Snyder&#x27;s team won the Southwest Division championship and reached the D-League Finals. In his second season, Snyder led the Toros to a 32-win season; coached in the 2009 NBA D-League All-Star Game in Phoenix; received the Dennis Johnson Coach of the Year award; and reached the D-League Semi-Finals. In his final season with the team, the Toros compiled another 32-win season – this time with more rookies than any other team in the D-League – and again reached the Semi-Finals. During his three-year tenure in Austin, Snyder compiled more wins and guided more players to the NBA than any other coach in the D-League.

===Philadelphia 76ers (2010–2011)===
Snyder became a player development coach for the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA on June 11, 2010, working under Doug Collins. Soon afterward, Snyder began training draft prospects in workouts preceding the 2010 NBA draft, including future 76ers player Evan Turner. The 76ers finished 41–41 in the 2010–11 season.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2011–2012)===
On July 1, 2011, NBA team Los Angeles Lakers hired Snyder as an assistant under coach Mike Brown. In a season shortened by a lockout, the Lakers finished the 2011–12 season in first place in the Pacific Division with a 41–25 record. The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference semi-finals.

===CSKA Moscow (2012–2013)===
On July 8, 2012, the European powerhouse team CSKA Moscow of the Russian Professional Basketball League hired Snyder as the head assistant coach under Ettore Messina. CSKA reached the Euroleague Final Four this season, but lost to eventual champion Olympiacos Piraeus in the semi-final round.

===Atlanta Hawks (2013–2014)===
On June 10, 2013, the Atlanta Hawks hired Snyder as the head assistant coach.

===Utah Jazz (2014–2022)===

On June 6, 2014, Snyder was hired by the Utah Jazz to be the team&#x27;s head coach. He reportedly signed a three-year deal with a team option for a fourth season. Snyder previously worked with Jazz general manager Dennis Lindsey from 2007 to 2010 when Lindsey was an assistant general manager with the San Antonio Spurs and Snyder coached the Toros, the Spurs&#x27; D-League affiliate. On May 6, 2016, the Jazz announced a long-term contract extension for Snyder. In June 2018, Snyder was named a finalist for NBA Coach of the Year. On October 19, 2019, the Jazz signed Snyder to a new contract extension.

On February 18, 2021, Snyder was named as the Western Conference head coach for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game as a result of his team&#x27;s NBA-best 23–5 record.

On June 5, 2022, Snyder resigned as head coach of the Jazz after eight seasons with a 372–264 (.585) regular season record.

===Return to Atlanta (2023–present)===
On February 26, 2023, the Atlanta Hawks hired Snyder as head coach.

==Head coaching record==

*Resigned before the season ended; Melvin Watkins became interim coach afterward, and Missouri finished the 2005–06 season 12–16 (5–11 Big 12) and 11th in the Big 12.

<doc id="1238631" wikidata="Q1127045" url="?curid=1238631" title="Trans-Texas Corridor">
<text>The Trans-Texas Corridor (TTC) was a proposal for a transportation network in the U.S. State of Texas that was conceived to be composed of a new kind of transportation modality known as supercorridors. The TTC was initially proposed in 2001 and after considerable controversy was discontinued by 2010 in the planning and early construction stages.

The network, as originally envisioned, would have been composed of a network of supercorridors up to wide to carry parallel links of tollways, rails, and utility lines. It was intended to route long-distance traffic around population centers, and to provide stable corridors for future infrastructure improvements–such as new power lines from wind farms in West Texas to the cities in the east–without the otherwise often lengthy administrative and legal procedures required to build on privately owned land. The tollway portion would have been divided into two separate elements: truck lanes and lanes for passenger vehicles. Similarly, the rail lines in the corridor would have been divided among freight, commuter, and high-speed rail. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) intended to &quot;charge public and private concerns for utility, commodity or data transmission&quot; within the corridor,
in essence making a toll road for services such as water, electricity, natural gas, petroleum, fiber optic lines, and other telecommunications services. The network would have been funded by private investors and built and expanded as demand warrants.

In 2009, TxDOT decided to phase out the all-in-one corridor concept in favor of developing separate rights-of-way for road, rail, and other infrastructure using more traditional corridor widths for those modes. In 2010, official decision of &quot;no action&quot; was issued by the Federal Highway Administration, formally ending the project. The action eliminated the study area and canceled the agreement between TxDOT and ACS-Zachry.

In 2011, the Texas Legislature formally canceled the Trans-Texas Corridor with the passage of HB 1201.

==Network==
The TTC was hoped to be a multi-use, statewide system that would have included new and existing highways, railways, and utility rights-of-way. According to the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, on January 6, 2009, &quot;In response to public outcry, the ambitious proposal to create the Trans-Texas Corridor network has been dropped and will be replaced with a plan to carry out road projects at an incremental, modest pace&quot;.

The network was proposed to include separate lanes for passenger and truck traffic, freight and high-speed commuter railways, and infrastructure for utilities, including water, oil, and gas pipelines; electricity; along with broadband and other telecommunications services. Although the model corridor design incorporates all of these elements running in parallel within a shared right-of-way, more recent plans suggested that existing rail and road corridors could be used for some components of the TTC. The model corridor design also represented the ultimate build-out of a corridor section, which would not have been realized for decades, if at all, as corridor segments and components were planned to be built based on traffic demand.

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) attempted to provide oversight for planning, construction, and maintenance while day-to-day operations would have been performed by private companies. In March 2005, TxDOT and ACS-Zachry signed a comprehensive development agreement which authorized $3.5 million of planning for TTC-35. This agreement did not designate the alignment, authorize construction, set toll rates or who collects them, and did not eliminate competition for future services. There were no contracts awarded to develop or finance any other corridor.

==Corridors==

There were two initial trans-Texas corridors under consideration: One would have paralleled Interstate 35 (I-35), from Gainesville to Laredo and passing the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Austin and San Antonio. The other would have been an extension of the proposed I-69 corridor, generally following US 59, from Texarkana past Houston to either Laredo or the Rio Grande Valley. Both of these corridors have seen large increases in freight traffic demand over the past two decades due to increased trade with Mexico.

Two additional high priority potential corridors would have paralleled Interstate 45 from Dallas to Houston and Interstate 10 from El Paso to Orange.

===TTC-35===
ACS-Zachry, a partnership between Spanish-based toll-road developer/operator ACS and Texas-based Zachry Construction, was awarded a $3.5 million contract to help plan the entire TTC-35 route in March 2005. The study area for Trans-Texas Corridor-35 (TTC-35) generally followed Interstate 35 from Laredo to the Oklahoma border. The environmental study for the project proceeded in two tiers: a first tier that refined the study area to a wide study corridor and a second tier that selected particular alignments for the various corridor components; where all corridor components (rail, highway, and utilities) were planned to be built adjacent to one another, this corridor would have been approximately wide.

The TTC-35 Tier 1 draft environmental impact statement (EIS) was published in April 2006. The final EIS was expected originally to be submitted to the Federal Highway Administration in 2007; , preparation of the final EIS was listed as &quot;ongoing.&quot;

The draft EIS included 12 different study corridor alternatives by choosing among four variations along the route. The first variation, from Laredo to southeast of San Antonio, would have included either the current I-35 alignment until curving off to the east at a point south of San Antonio or would have followed a more direct route to the east. The study area for all alternatives continued northeast, paralleling I-35. The second variation would have either passed just to the east of the municipal boundaries along I-35 from Austin to Temple or further east. The third variation would have passed either to the west of Fort Worth or east of Dallas. The fourth variation was dependent on the eastern third variation and would have either rejoined the western third variation near the Oklahoma border or would have ended at the Oklahoma border near U.S. Route 75. The draft EIS designated a recommended preferred alternative corridor running to the east of I-35 and I-35E from near Gainesville to south of San Antonio, where the corridor would join I-35 to run south to Laredo.

On October 7, 2009, TxDOT officials announced that the department would recommend the &quot;No Action Alternative&quot;, which effectively ended the efforts to develop the Interstate 35 corridor through the TTC concept.

====SH 130====
State Highway 130 is a component of the Central Texas Turnpike System, much of which was thought likely to be incorporated into TTC-35. Segments 1-4 of SH 130 were built by Lone Star Infrastructure in the Austin metropolitan area as an eastern relief route for Interstate 35.

On June 28, 2006, ACS-Zachry reached a $1.3 billion agreement with the state to build segments 5 and 6 of SH 130, which could have represented the alignment of TTC-35&#x27;s highway component between Interstate 10 at Seguin east of San Antonio and U.S. Route 79 near Taylor, Texas. According to the &quot;Facility Plan of Finance,&quot; $412 million of financing for the project would be a federally-guaranteed loan under the Transportation Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act, while the remaining financing would be from equity put forward by ACS-Zachry and bank loans from private lenders. Per the agreement, TxDOT would receive between 4.65% and 50% of toll revenues depending on the performance of the facility, with a smaller share due to TxDOT if TxDOT does not authorize posting of daytime speed limits of or higher along the route.

The ACS-Zachry Preliminary Financial Plan showed the expected toll revenue to be collected for Segment 5 and 6 at $14.9 billion over 50 years. The Preliminary Financial Plan for Segment 5 and 6 also showed $12.4 billion in earnings before taxes for the developer.

===I-69/TTC===
The second priority corridor for development was the Interstate 69 extension through Texas, which would have roughly followed the route of US 59 from Laredo via Houston to Carthage; there, the national I-69 corridor would have continued northeast into Louisiana and a spur route north to Texarkana would have continued along US 59 to Interstate 30. The original national plan for I-69 also included two spur routes to the Rio Grande Valley following US 281 and US 77; Texas was also studying a connection between the I-69 corridor near Laredo and Corpus Christi known as the &quot;Port to Port Corridor&quot;.

Texas&#x27; portion of I-69 was originally planned to be developed as a traditional Interstate highway (with a mixed-use freeway component only), as it is being developed in other states, but was rolled into the Trans Texas Corridor concept soon after the latter&#x27;s announcement due to their substantial overlap in purpose and scope. However, on June 11, 2008, TxDOT announced they planned to limit further study of I-69 to existing highway corridors–U.S. 59, U.S. 77, U.S. 281, U.S. 84, and SH 44–outside transition zones in the lower Rio Grande Valley, Laredo, Houston, and Texarkana. TxDOT also announced it was reverting to building I-69 as a standard 4-lane freeway instead of a multi-modal corridor as previously envisioned under the Trans-Texas Corridor concept. The latest plan called for adding a second carriageway and eliminating at-grade intersections along US-59 and US-77 in rural areas, with tolled bypasses around major cities and towns along the I-69 route.

According to the Deep East Texas Council of Governments, I-69 is a &quot;future NAFTA Superhighway&quot;. It will enter the U.S. from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.

===Other potential corridors===
Texas officials identified several other possible TTC corridors in the long-range plan. Interstate 10 through the southern part of the state, Interstate 20 from east of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex to I-10 near Midland, along an extended Interstate 27 through western Texas, and a new terrain corridor along the northern Texas border paralleling sections of Interstate 30 from the Arkansas line at Texarkana to Fort Worth, US-287 from Fort Worth to Amarillo, and Interstate 40 from Amarillo to New Mexico.

==As alternatives to California seaports==

One component of TTC-69 could have been part of a freight corridor that stretched from ports on the Pacific coast of Mexico to the Great Lakes. Depending on the level of traffic on that route, opponents argued that it would draw shipping traffic away from U.S. ports in California (San Diego, Long Beach and Los Angeles) in favor of Mexican seaports.

==Criticism==
A citizens uprising was started in 2003 by Linda and David Stall of Fayette County, after reading a small notice in a trade paper about a hearing to be held by TxDOT in their rural town of Fayetteville, Texas. The Stalls notified their friends and neighbors. Eight hundred people showed up to a town hall with a seating capacity of 100. David Stall, a city manager, and Linda Stall, an escrow officer of a Texas title company, founded CorridorWatch.org to lead the building of a network of people who worked together to defeat the construction project. The Motorcycle Riders Caucus, active within both the Democratic and Republican parties, was categorically opposed to toll roads, and they were the most powerful caucus in Texas. Its chair Sputnik helped to develop Stall&#x27;s network into an immense, diverse coalition of voters opposed to the corridor. As lobbyist for the Texas Motorcycle Rights Association, Sputnik convinced many state legislators to vote against it. 

American author and conservative activist Jerome Corsi vehemently opposed the corridor and wrote a book titled &quot;The Late Great USA: NAFTA, the North American Union, and the Threat of a Coming Merger with Mexico and Canada&quot;.
In 2002, the TTC was estimated to cost between US$145.2 billion to $183.5 billion to complete the entire network. Some criticisms have focused on the enormous width of the corridors. The planned system, if built out to its fullest extent, could have required about of land to be purchased or acquired through the state&#x27;s assertion of eminent domain. Environmentalists were concerned about the effects of such wide corridors and private land owners have expressed concerns about property rights.
Opponents also alleged that noise from the TTC would be of such a high volume that it would render the area within one mile (1.6 km) of the corridor uninhabitable by humans, at least during periods of peak traffic on all components of the corridor (freight and passenger rail, truck lanes, and passenger lanes) if they are colocated and built to full capacity.

According to TxDOT documents released in June 2002, &quot;Governor Rick Perry wrote Transportation Commission Chairman John W. Johnson on January 30, 2002 to outline his vision for the Trans Texas Corridor. The governor asked the three-member commission to assemble the Texas Department of Transportation’s top talent to create and deliver a Trans Texas Corridor implementation plan in 90 days.&quot;

In spite of public complaints–and both the 2006 platforms of the Texas Republican and Democratic parties opposing the plan–Governor Rick Perry continued to support the TTC.

Among the opponents to the corridor was the Republican State Representative Lois Kolkhorst of Washington County, who opposed on the basis that the project would undermine private property rights.

In the 2010 gubernatorial elections, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison ran several attack advertisements regarding the TTC as Perry&#x27;s attempts to expand government and take land from the average Texan. Ultimately, the advertisements did not have a great effect as Hutchison bowed out following her loss in the Republican primary.

==Financing==

To help pay for building the roads and rails, the highways would have been partially financed through private investment. The investors would have then operated the highways as toll roads.

Based on The ACS-Zachry Preliminary Financial Plan (TTC-35 Development Agreement, Exhibit C) funding the TTC-35 Corridor awarded to ACS-Zachry showed that 22%(1) of the initial infrastructure costs were shown to be funded with equity provided by ACS-Zachry. The other 78% was to be provided by bank loans or bonds arranged by ACS-Zachry. Based on then-current federal regulations these bonds could have been tax-exempt. It was also noted in the financial plan that ACS-Zachry expected to have 12% return on investment for their equity partners. The 12% return was after taxes, which would have been approximately equivalent to 16% before taxes. The plan called for paying off the bank loans and the bonds prior to retiring the equity as shown in cash flow diagrams of the Preliminary Financial Plan (TTC-35 Development Agreement, Exhibit C). With usual bond financing there is a 3:1 ratio between total fees collected and value of capital infrastructure built. With TTC-35 the ratio was in the order of magnitude of 13:1. So while TTC-35 committed to construct $8 billion in infrastructure ACS-Zachry expected to collect $114 billion in toll revenues as shown in the preliminary plan. A report by the Texas State Auditor estimated the toll to be collected for TTC-35 to be $104 billion or more, confirming the order of magnitude of tolls collected.

<text>Zwelinzima Vavi (born 20 December 1962) is the General Secretary of the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU). He is the former general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), and vice-chairperson of the Millennium Labour Council.

==Early life==
Vavi was born on a farm in Hanover, Northern Cape, with a mineworker father, four brothers and seven sisters. Until he was baptised, he did not know the date of his birthday. He was a child labourer, looking for work among neighbouring farms.

In 1987 Vavi worked in a gold-mining territory of Klerksdorp and Orkney. He was a uranium plant clerk at Vaal Reefs mine, and joined the National Union of Mineworkers as an organizer. He was fired from AngloGold in 1987 following a massive miners&#x27; strike which crippled the Chamber of Mines. He then joined COSATU as a volunteer.

==COSATU==
In 1988, he became COSATU&#x27;s regional secretary for the Western Transvaal. In 1992 he took up the position of national organizing secretary. He served as COSATU&#x27;s deputy general secretary from 1993 to 1999.

Vavi took centre stage in the four-month negotiation that preceded the 1997 Jobs Summit. He served on the International Labour Organization&#x27;s commission on globalisation.

In 1999 he succeeded Mbhazima Shilowa (formerly the Gauteng premier, and later one of the leaders of COPE) as general secretary of COSATU.

He addressed the 27 June 2002 XIV International AIDS Conference, where he pushed mass education and prevention campaigns.

Vavi has spoken out against the expulsion of NUMSA, the metalworkers union, which used to be the largest union in the COSATU federation. This is one of the major factors contributing to Vavi&#x27;s expulsion from COSATU. On 30 March 2015 the Central Executive Committee (CEC) voted to expel Vavi. The vote was 31–1 in favour of expelling Vavi.

Vavi was suspended from the Cosatu secretary-general position in 2013 after a rape accusation.

==Zimbabwe==
As general secretary he has expressed disappointment with political progress in Zimbabwe, blaming mismanagement by government, an ill-conceived structural adjustment programme, and factors beyond its control like sanctions against neighbouring South Africa during apartheid years. He led two fact-finding missions, in October 2004 and February 2005, to assess conditions for a fair poll during the planned Zimbabwe parliamentary elections of 2005. The members of the mission were deported during the first mission, and were turned back at Harare airport at the start of the second.

Talking of the alliance which governs South Africa between the ANC, COSATU and the SACP after a failed trip to see the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) in 2004, he is critical of the ANC&#x27;s approach to Zimbabwe, privatisation, and corruption in government.

==ANC==
He took particular issue with the Public Investment Corporation&#x27;s Telkom share purchase, involving former communications director-general Andile Ngcaba and the former head of the presidency Smuts Ngonyama.

COSATU accuses both men of taking advantage of their government posts to access privileged information.

In May 2010 the ANC threatened to charge Vavi with &quot;ill-discipline&quot;.

Vavi argued that under Jacob Zuma&#x27;s government &quot;We are heading rapidly in the direction of a full-blown predator state in which a powerful corrupt and demagogic elite of political hyenas increasingly controls the state as a vehicle of accumulation and warned of a possible Tunisia style revolution.

<text>David Rokeby (born 1960) is a Canadian artist who has been making works of electronic, video and installation art since 1982. He lives with his wife, acclaimed pianist Eve Egoyan, in Toronto, Canada.

His early work &quot;Very Nervous System&quot; (1982–1991) is acknowledged as a pioneering work of interactive art, translating physical gestures into real-time interactive sound environments. &quot;Very Nervous System&quot; was presented at the Venice Biennale in 1986.

==Work==
Rokeby&#x27;s pioneering interactive work &quot;Very Nervous System&quot; has been evolving since 1982. In &quot;Wired Magazine&quot; the work is described as 
&quot;A combination of technologies, some off-the-shelf, some rare and esoteric, and some cooked up by Rokeby himself. Initially, in 1982, much more of the system was homemade. His circuitry, designed to speed up the response of the sluggish Apple II, was still not fast enough to analyze an image from an ordinary video camera, so he built his own low-res device: a little box with 64 light sensors behind a plastic Fresnel lens. But Very Nervous System has been evolving for 13 years, during which time the world has seen any number of technological revolutions. So Rokeby now has a lot more store-bought components incorporated into the system: it can handle a Mac Quadra and real video cameras, via sophisticated &quot;Max&quot; software from Paris.&quot;

A number of Rokeby&#x27;s works address issues of digital surveillance, including &quot;Watch&quot; (1995), &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; (2002) and &quot;Sorting Daemon&quot; (2003). In addition to his surveillance art, other works engage in a critical examination of the differences between human and artificial intelligence. &quot;The Giver of Names&quot; (1991) and &quot;n-cha(n)t&quot; (2001) are artificial subjective entities, provoked by objects or spoken words in their immediate environment to formulate sentences and speak them aloud.

He has exhibited and lectured extensively in the Americas, Europe and Asia. He is the Director of the BMO Lab for Creative Research in the Arts, Performance, Emerging Technologies and AI at the Centre for Drama, Theatre and Performance Studies at the University of Toronto. http://www.bmolab.ca
