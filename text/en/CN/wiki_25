<text>Oliver &quot;Tuku&quot; Mtukudzi (22 September 1952 – 23 January 2019) was a Zimbabwean musician, businessman, philanthropist, human rights activist and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Southern Africa Region.

==Career ==

Mtukudzi grew up in Highfield, in Salisbury (modern-day Harare) in Southern Rhodesia. He began performing in 1977 when he joined the Wagon Wheels, a band that also featured Thomas Mapfumo and fellow guitarist James Chimombe. They were given the rare opportunity by Paul Tangi Mhova Mkondo, an African nationalist and music promotor, who provided money and resources to the group. He allowed them to perform at Club Mutanga (Pungwe) which, at the time, was the only night club available for blacks under Rhodesia&#x27;s policy of segregation. Their single &quot;Dzandimomotera&quot; went gold and Tuku&#x27;s first album followed, which was also a major success. Mtukudzi was also a contributor to Mahube, Southern Africa&#x27;s &quot;supergroup&quot;.

With his husky voice, Mtukudzi became the most recognised voice to emerge from Zimbabwe and onto the international scene and he earned a devoted following across Africa and beyond. A member of Zimbabwe&#x27;s KoreKore group, with Nzou Samanyanga as his totem, he sang in the nation&#x27;s dominant Shona language along with Ndebele and English. He also incorporated elements of different musical traditions, giving his music a distinctive style, known to fans as &quot;Tuku Music&quot;. 

Mtukudzi had a number of tours around the world. He was on several tours in the UK, US and Canada to perform for large audiences. In 2017 Mtukudzi entertained guests at the wedding of Zimbabwean businessman Wicknell Chivayo.

== Social commentary ==
Prior to the independence of Zimbabwe, Mtukudzi&#x27;s music depicted the struggles under Rhodesian white minority rule. In subsequent years following Zimbabwean independence, his music has advocated for tolerance and peace and has frequently portrayed the struggles of women and children.

== Personal life and death ==
Mtukudzi was the father of six children(with four different women) and had three grandchildren. His son Sam Mtukudzi, a successful musician in his own right, died in a car accident in March 2010. In 2013, Mtukudzi released an album titled &quot;Sarawoga&quot;, in tribute to his son. His daughter Selmor is also a musician and works with UNICEF.

On 23 January 2019, Mtukudzi died at the age of 66 at Avenues Clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe after a long battle with diabetes mellitus.

<text>Newell Sanders (July 12, 1850January 26, 1939) was a Chattanooga businessman who served for a relatively brief time as a United States Senator from Tennessee.

==Life and career==
Sanders was born in Owen County, Indiana, the son of Miriam (Coffey) and John Sanders. He attended Indiana University Bloomington, where he was graduated in 1873 and operated a bookstore until 1877. During that year, he moved to Chattanooga and became involved in the manufacturing of farm implements. He served on the board of education 1881 1882 and as an alderman 1882 1886. He also served on the board of directors of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway.

When Democratic U.S. Senator Robert Love Taylor died in office, Tennessee Governor Ben W. Hooper, a Republican, appointed Sanders to the vacancy. Sanders was sworn in in April 1911 and served until February 1913 when the Tennessee General Assembly elected educator William R. Webb, a Democrat, to succeed him, the process called for in the United States Constitution until the Seventeenth Amendment was ratified later in the decade. During his somewhat abbreviated service, Sanders nonetheless served as chair of the Senate Committee on National Banks. Sanders was the last Republican to serve as U.S. Senator from Tennessee until the election of Howard H. Baker, Jr. over five decades later. He was, furthermore, the last Republican U.S. Senator from a former Confederate state prior to the election of John Tower of Texas in 1961 (a gap of 48 years).

After his service in the Senate, Sanders returned to his manufacturing interests until his retirement in 1927. In 1922 he ran for popular election to the United States Senate, and received 32 percent of the vote against Democratic incumbent Kenneth McKellar. Sanders died at his home in Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, and was buried in Chattanooga&#x27;s Forest Hills Cemetery.

<doc id="1236935" wikidata="Q2000557" url="?curid=1236935" title="North Cape (New Zealand)">
<text>North Cape / Otou () is the northernmost point of New Zealand&#x27;s main islands. At the northeastern tip of the Aupōuri Peninsula, the cape lies east and north of Cape Reinga. The name &quot;North Cape&quot; is sometimes used to refer just to the cape that is known in Māori as and which overlooks Murimotu Island, and sometimes just to the eastern point of Murimotu Island. It is also used to refer to the whole larger headland stretching about five kilometres from Murimotu Island westwards to Kerr Point and including the Surville Cliffs. Statistics New Zealand uses a statistical area called North Cape for population data, extending south down the Aupōuri Peninsula to the Houhora Heads.

North Cape, one of the four New Zealand Cardinal Capes, was named by James Cook, Commander of &quot;Endeavour&quot; in its 1769–1770 voyage. At the time the other Cardinal Capes were named Cape East, West Cape and Cape South.

North Cape was once an island formed by a marine volcano. Sand deposited by ocean currents eventually formed a tombolo known as Waikuku Flat, which joined the island to the rest of the Aupōuri Peninsula. The headland and flat combined now form the North Cape Peninsula.

A large part of North Cape is enclosed in the North Cape Scientific Reserve. The reserve’s purpose is to protect the unique flora and fauna of the area, some of it endemic to a small area on Surville Cliffs. An electrified fence was erected in 2000 to create a mainland island by excluding the possums, feral pigs and semi-wild horses of the area. The reserve is closed to the public and managed by the Department of Conservation (DoC).

Much of Waikuku Flat is in another DoC reserve, the Mokaikai Scenic Reserve, which stretches south to Parengarenga Harbour. This reserve is open to the public but land access is via an area in Māori tribal ownership and a permit is required from the controlling Māori body to cross the land. Another strip of Māori land lies between the Mokaikai reserve and the North Cape reserve. This strip includes the southern part of North Cape and the northern edge of Waikuku Flat. It stretches from Kerr Point and the north end of Tom Bowling Bay on the north coast across to Tokatoka Point on the west coast.

==Surville Cliffs==

Hikurua / de Surville Cliffs is the northernmost point of the mainland of New Zealand, located at the tip of North Cape. In the past the cliffs have sometimes been referred to as Kerr Point but true Kerr Point lies a short distance away at the western end of North Cape. The first European discovery of the cliffs was made by Jean-François-Marie de Surville in December 1769, when he sailed his ship &quot;St Jean Baptiste&quot; to New Zealand to find a safe anchorage to care for sick crew. He found them only a few days before they were seen by James Cook.

The cliffs expose 1.2 square kilometres of serpentinised peridotite mafic rocks. They form a unique environment that supports a number of threatened and endangered plants endemic to the area, including:
* &quot;Pittosporum ellipticum subsp. serpentinum&quot;
* &quot;Hebe brevifolia&quot;
* &quot;Hebe ligustrifolia&quot;
* &quot;Helichrysum aggregatum&quot;
* &quot;Leucopogon xerampelinus&quot;
* &quot;Pimelea tomentosa&quot; (sand daphne)
* &quot;Phyllocladus trichomanoides&quot; (tanekaha)
* &quot;Pseudopanax lessonii&quot; (coastal fivefinger)
* &quot;Uncinia perplexa&quot; (Surville Cliffs bastard grass)

<text>Chris Cutler (born 4 January 1947) is an English percussionist, composer, lyricist and music theorist. Best known for his work with English avant-rock group Henry Cow, Cutler was also a member and drummer of other bands, including Art Bears, News from Babel, Pere Ubu and (briefly) Gong/Mothergong. He has collaborated with many musicians and groups, including Fred Frith, Lindsay Cooper, Zeena Parkins, Peter Blegvad, Telectu and The Residents, and has appeared on over 100 recordings. Cutler&#x27;s career spans over four decades and he still performs actively throughout the world.

Cutler created and runs the British independent record label Recommended Records and is the editor of its sound-magazine, &quot;RēR Quarterly&quot;. He has given a number of public lectures on music, published numerous articles and papers, and written a book on the political theory of contemporary music, &quot;File Under Popular&quot; (1984). Cutler also assembled and released &quot;The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set&quot; (2009), a collection of over 10 hours of previously unreleased recordings by the band.

==Biography==
Chris Cutler was born in January 1947 in Washington, D.C. to a British intelligence officer and his Austrian wife. In 1948 the family moved to England, where Cutler was brought up. He never studied music but tried his hand at banjo, guitar, trumpet and flute while at school. He finally settled for drums &quot;because I wanted to be in a band and drummers were scarcest.&quot; Cutler formed his first band in 1963, playing Shadows and Ventures instrumental covers, then played in several R&amp;B and soul bands. In 1966 he joined a band called Louise, with Tony Durant (later of Fuchsia), which performed on the London psychedelic club circuit for three years before breaking up. Looking for work, Cutler placed a series of advertisements in Melody Maker over a period of nine months in 1970. This put him in touch with a number of musicians which led to Cutler and keyboardist Dave Stewart of Egg forming The Ottawa Music Company, a 26 piece rock composer&#x27;s orchestra, in 1971. Soon afterwards, Henry Cow, looking to replace the drummer who had just left them, responded to one of Cutler&#x27;s adverts and invited him to a rehearsal.

===Henry Cow===

Henry Cow had been formed in 1968 by Cambridge University students Fred Frith (guitar) and Tim Hodgkinson (woodwind and keyboards). By 1971 the band had gone through a number of personnel changes and it was only when Cutler joined them in September 1971 that the group stabilised. Frith, Hodgkinson and Cutler became Henry Cow&#x27;s permanent core until the band split up in 1978.

Henry Cow&#x27;s prominence in progressive rock circles launched the careers of many of its members, including Cutler&#x27;s. Their music was uncompromising and this eventually put them at odds with the mainstream music business, forcing the band to do everything themselves: from recording, manufacturing and releasing their own albums, to organising their own tours and being their own management and agency. All this proved invaluable experience for Cutler that would assist him greatly in his future endeavours. The group spent most of its last three years touring Europe and many of Cutler&#x27;s future collaborations resulted from contact made with musicians on these tours. In Henry Cow&#x27;s last few months they initiated Rock in Opposition (RIO), a collective of like-minded bands they had encountered through Europe that were united in their opposition to the music industry.

===Recommended Records===

After Henry Cow disbanded in 1978, Cutler created Recommended Records in London, an independent label and distribution network for RIO artists. The record label quickly filled the gap left by commercial labels and soon began to also release non-RIO bands and musicians. Recommended Records&#x27;s aim was to produce records of high technical and musical quality, placing the musicians&#x27; interests first and profits second. This strategy, however, led to the label experiencing financial difficulties from time to time, but it stuck to its principles and has survived for over 25 years. There are a number of musicians whose work would never have seen the light of day had it not been for Cutler&#x27;s label.

Cutler also founded November Books in 1982, the publishing wing of Recommended Records.

===Other bands and projects===
Cutler&#x27;s first post-Henry Cow project was Art Bears (1978–1981), a group formed by Cutler, and fellow Henry Cow members, Fred Frith (guitar and keyboards) and Dagmar Krause (vocals), six months before Henry Cow split up. Art Bears were a song-oriented group that recorded three studio albums. Cutler&#x27;s main contributions were the songs&#x27; texts and (with Frith) the album productions. Art Bears (in the wake of Henry Cow) were well received by critics which further boosted Cutler&#x27;s reputation in &quot;progressive&quot; circles.

In 1982, Cutler co-founded the Anglo-German group Cassiber (1982–1992) with German musicians Heiner Goebbels, Alfred Harth and Christoph Anders. Over the next ten years Cassiber produced five albums and toured Europe, Asia, South and North America. Their music was very experimental and often involved spontaneously improvising pre-existing structured and arranged material.

In 1983, Cutler formed News from Babel (1983–1986), another song-orientated group with core members Cutler, Lindsay Cooper (from Henry Cow), Zeena Parkins (a United States harpist) and Dagmar Krause. With guest musicians (including Robert Wyatt and Sally Potter) they made two critically acclaimed studio albums, but did not perform live.

Cutler was a member of the United States experimental rock band Pere Ubu between 1987 and 1989. He had first encountered them in Washington DC in 1978 while exploring the possibility of Henry Cow touring America (which never materialised as Henry Cow disbanded soon after). Cutler kept in touch with Pere Ubu until they split in the early 1980s and their singer, David Thomas began a solo career. Cutler and Lindsay Cooper joined Thomas in 1982 to form David Thomas and the Pedestrians, and for the next three years they toured Europe and North America and made two albums. Over the next few years, some of the ex-Pere Ubu members began joining Thomas&#x27;s Pedestrians. Cooper left in 1985 and by 1987 the group (now called David Thomas and the Wooden Birds) was effectively Pere Ubu again. As Pere Ubu, the band (with Cutler) made two albums. Cutler left in 1989, but was credited as a co-writer on the band&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;World in Collision&quot; for several songs written during his tenure.

In 1991, Cutler and German composer Lutz Glandien recorded the critically acclaimed song project &quot;Domestic Stories&quot;. Cutler wrote the song texts and played drums, while Glandien composed and performed the music with samplers and computers. The supporting musicians were Dagmar Krause (vocals), Fred Frith (bass and guitar) and Alfred Harth (saxophone and clarinet). Cutler collaborated with Glandien again in 1994 to record &quot;Scenes from no Marriage&quot; and to participate in p53, a commission for the 25th Frankfurt Jazz Festival with Zygmunt Krauze, Marie Goyette, Otomo Yoshihide.

The (ec) Nudes were a band Cutler, Wädi Gysi (guitar) and Amy Denio (vocals, bass, saxophone, accordion) formed in 1993. The trio recorded &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;, a CD of songs with texts by Cutler and music by Gysi and Denio, and toured all over Europe and visited Brasil. Bob Drake later joined the group on bass and as a quartet they toured all over Europe, Canada and Brazil, but did not record. Cutler left the group in 1994.

Cutler and Yugoslav keyboardist and composer Stevan Tickmayer formed The Science Group in 1997 to record &quot;A Mere Coincidence&quot; (1999), an album of songs on science topics, including quantum mechanics. Cutler wrote the texts, Tickmayer composed the music, and the rest of the group comprised Bob Drake (bass guitar, vocals) and Claudio Puntin (bass clarinet), with guests Amy Denio (vocals) and Fred Frith (guitar). In 2003 Cutler and Tickmayer reconstituted The Science Group as a quartet with Bob Drake (bass guitar) and Mike Johnson (guitars), and released an instrumental album, &quot;Spoors&quot;. In 1998, he joined John Wolf Brennan&#x27;s sextet &quot;HeXtet&quot; to record a series of poetry settings, from Edgar Allan Poe to contemporary Irish poets like Theo Dorgan and Paula Meehan, together with legendary singer Julie Tippetts, saxophonist Evan Parker, trombonist Paul Rutherford and clarinetist Peter Whyman.

===Other collaborations===
The ex-Henry Cow members have always maintained close contact with each other and Cutler still collaborates with many of them. Cutler and Fred Frith have been touring Europe, Asia and the Americas since 1978 and have given over 100 duo performances. Four albums from some of these concerts have been released. In December 2006, Cutler, Frith and Tim Hodgkinson performed together at The Stone in New York City, only their second concert performance since Henry Cow&#x27;s demise in 1978. Cutler, John Greaves and Geoff Leigh formed The Artaud Beats with Yumi Hara. Cutler and Hara also work together in Half the Sky, a band formed in 2015 to play the music of former Henry Cow member Lindsay Cooper, principally pieces she wrote for News from Babel and Henry Cow. The band have performed in Japan, France, the UK and Germany.

On 4 November 2006 Cutler, Jon Rose (violin) and Zeena Parkins (harp) performed with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra conducted by Ilan Volkov, at the Glasgow City Halls in Glasgow, Scotland. The concert was recorded and later broadcast by BBC Radio 3 on 24 March 2007.

Other musicians and bands Cutler has performed and recorded with over the years include Tim Hodgkinson, Lindsay Cooper, Peter Blegvad, John Greaves, René Lussier, Jean Derome, Tom Cora, Aksak Maboul, The Residents, The Work, Duck and Cover, Les 4 Guitaristes de l&#x27;Apocalypso-Bar, Kalahari Surfers, Hail, Biota and Brainville 3.

In 2009, Cutler toured North America with avant-garde Czech violinist Iva Bittová.
In 2015 he collaborated with Alfred Harth founding a group Hope, a commission for the 46th Frankfurt Jazz Festival with Kazuhisa Uchihashi, Mitsuru Nasuno.

===Solo performances===
Since the late 1990s, Cutler began giving solo electrified percussion performances to audiences across the world. His first was in Tokyo in June 1998, which was recorded in a documentary film, &quot;At the Edge of Chaos&quot; (also known as &quot;12 June 1998&quot;), by award-winning film director Shinji Aoyama. The first part of the film is equipment set-up and sound-checks, plus interviews with Cutler, while the second part is the improvised concert itself.

In 2001 Cutler released &quot;Solo: A Descent Into the Maelstrom&quot;, an album of solos on his electrified drum kit taken from live performances in Europe and the United States between August 2000 and May 2001. In 2005 he released &quot;Twice Around the World&quot;, an album of real-time recordings made from all over the world between 23.30 and midnight GMT. The material was taken from a daily half-hour radio programme Cutler ran for Resonance FM: Out of the Blue Radio between July 2001 and July 2002. A companion album, &quot;There and Back Again&quot;, comprising 44 environmental recordings, was released by Cutler in 2006.

==Electrified drum kit==
Cutler never studied music and taught himself drumming on makeshift drum kits assembled with whatever was on hand. He slowly developed a technique using a &quot;top-down&quot; approach as opposed to the traditional &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach used by schooled drummers. Drummers are first taught basic patterns which are later combined into more complex patterns. Cutler learned the opposite way, hearing or imagining a sound and then disciplining his hands and feet to reproduce it. This &quot;top-down&quot; approach resulted in a unique style of drumming that pervades all of Cutler&#x27;s performances and recordings.

By the time Cutler was drumming for Henry Cow in 1971, he had become a perfectly competent, albeit unconventional, drummer. The nature of Henry Cow was to experiment and explore and it was here that Cutler developed and refined his drumming techniques. It was also here that he started to electrify his drum kit. He began by attaching old telephone mouthpieces to drums and cymbals, and connecting them to an amplifier and a reverb unit. He later added a small mixer for four independent inputs. The effect was very basic: a few low-grade inputs with only equalisation and reverberation to manipulate.

By 1982, Cutler had added another small mixer, a pitch shifter and a delay unit. He had also begun using cheap guitar transducers and a table full of additional wired objects (pans, metal trays, small tambours and egg-slicers).

Cutler experimented briefly with drum pads triggered to play sampled or synthesized sounds, but quickly dismissed this option because he found them unresponsive and inflexible. They reduced a drum to nothing more than a switch: hit it and a pre-programmed sound is emitted, irrespective of how hard or in what manner the drum is struck. Cutler preferred processing: amplifying and modifying actual sounds produced by the drum, making it a kind of an electroacoustic instrument, immediate and responsive, and retaining all the qualities of an acoustic drum kit.

Cutler went on to wire his entire drum kit, using a 16 channel mixer with multi-effect processors, a &quot;Space pedal&quot;, a &quot;Whammy pedal&quot;, a PDS 8000 and an old Boss pitch shifter/delay unit. In addition to transducers, he also attached miniature microphones to some of the drums and sticks. Cutler introduced feedback into the mix by placing a monitor speaker near the kit.

The electrified drum kit continues to evolve and to Cutler it is &quot;satisfyingly unpredictable&quot;, responsive to all his old techniques while continuing to generate new ones. It has a unique &quot;voice&quot; that Cutler still has not plumbed the depths of. This is what prompted him to start giving solo performances because it tested his skill at playing an instrument he had to treat as an equal and evolve with.

<text>Torque Game Engine, or TGE, is an open-source cross-platform 3D computer game engine, developed by GarageGames and actively maintained under the current versions Torque 3D as well as Torque 2D. It was originally developed by Dynamix for the 2001 first-person shooter &quot;Tribes 2&quot;. In September 2012, GarageGames released Torque 3D as open-source software under the MIT License.

Torque 3D features a world editor suite including tools for sculpting terrain and painting forests, drawing rivers and roads, as well as material, particle and decal editing. It supports the open COLLADA file format as interface to 3D digital content creation software. PhysX provides support for cloth dynamics, rigid body dynamics, destructible objects and joints, as well as fluid buoyancy simulation. Other features include a deferred lighting model and modern shader features such as dynamic lighting, normal and parallax occlusion mapping, screen space ambient occlusion, depth of field, volumetric light beam effects, lens flare/corona effects, refraction, bloom, blurring and color correction, among others. Networking functionality for multiplayer support is included as well. Build support is provided for desktop Windows, Linux, macOS and Web platforms.

== Inception ==
The Torque engine and its many derivative products were available for license from GarageGames, a company formed by many members of the &quot;Tribes 2&quot; team at Dynamix. GarageGames was later acquired by InstantAction, but by November 2010, InstantAction began winding down its operations and looking for potential buyers for Torque. In January 2011, GarageGames was re-acquired by Graham Software Development, and their name was reverted back to the original.

GarageGames released Torque 3D as open-source software under the MIT License on September 20, 2012. Torque 2D followed on February 5, 2013. Torque 3D and most of their other products were to continue being developed and supported. The latest stable release of Torque 2D was marked May 2023 on GitHub, and the latest stable release of Torque 3D was marked February 2023, on GitHub.

== History ==
=== Original Torque Game Engine ===
The original Torque Game Engine, which has been superseded by Torque 3D, provided networking code, scripting, in-engine world editing, and GUI creation. The source code could be compiled for Windows, macOS, Linux, Wii, Xbox 360, and iOS platforms. TGE shipped with starter kits for a first-person shooter and an off-road racing game. A real-time strategy starter kit was also available as a separate purchase. These starter packs could be modified to suit the needs of the developer, or the developer could start from scratch.

The engine supported loading of 3D models in the DTS and DIF file formats. DTS models were typically used for characters and vehicles though occasionally for buildings and interiors. They could be animated using either skeletal or morph target animation. It was also possible to blend multiple skeletal animations together by playing them simultaneously or automatically tweening the different positions of bones in the skeleton. DIF models have pre-calculated lighting and as such are ill-suited for animation. Instead, they were used for buildings and interiors. They automatically had bounding boxes that perfectly match the visible geometry. This was so that it was not made overly difficult for a player in a Torque Game Engine game to move or fire weapons around them.

The game featured a terrain engine that automatically created LODs of the ground so that it rendered the fewest polygons necessary at any given time. The terrain was automatically lit, and textures applied to the terrain could be blended together seamlessly. The game&#x27;s rendering engine featured environment mapping, Gouraud shading, volumetric fog, and other effects such as decals that allowed for textures to be projected onto interiors in real time (for example, a player in a Torque Game Engine game might fire a weapon that left a bullet hole in the wall, and the bullet hole would be a decal). Torque supported networked games over LAN and the internet with a traditional client-server architecture. Server objects were &quot;ghosted&quot; on clients and updated periodically or upon events.

TorqueScript (also known as TS) is a coding language designed specifically for the Torque Game Engine, with a syntax similar to C++.

===Torque 3D===
Torque 3D, version 1.2, was released as open-source software under the MIT License on September 20, 2012, and is being actively maintained, the current version being 4.0.3. Originating as a successor to Torque Game Engine Advanced (TGEA), Torque 3D features PhysX support, modern shader features, an advanced deferred lighting model, as well as build support for Windows, macOS and Linux. DTS and DIF have been superseded by COLLADA, a more commonly supported interactive 3D model file format. The DIF format has been completely deprecated, while DTS is still used as an internal format.

====Release history====
===Torque 2D===

Torque 2D, originally Torque Game Builder, is a game engine designed for 2D games and based on the &quot;Torque Game Engine&quot;. It was first released in 2006, in a &quot;standard&quot; and a &quot;pro&quot; version, with the professional version including the source code. Torque 2D started as &quot;Torque Game Builder&quot; because the ultimate goal was to make it a game-making suite. It was used for instance to create the puzzle game &quot;And Yet It Moves&quot; (2009, Broken Rules, WiiWare) and dozens of other games. The latest &quot;Torque game builder&quot; release was 1.7.6 from December 2011. In 2012 a &quot;Torque 2D MIT&quot; edition was created as combination of the previous &quot;Torque Game Builder&quot; and iTorque 2d, an iOS fork. On February 5, 2013, &quot;Torque 2D MIT&quot; was released in version 2.0 as open source software. Torque 2D&#x27;s development continues on GitHub with latest version being v.3.4 from May 2018.

====Release history====
===Torque Game Engine Advanced===
&quot;Torque Game Engine Advanced&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Torque Shader Engine&quot;) was an expanded version of &quot;Torque Game Engine&quot; made to support advanced technologies including shaders, per-pixel lighting, and massive terrains. This version of the engine has been ported to Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox and Xbox 360 console systems. Several Xbox Live Arcade games have been released using the Torque engine, most notably &quot;Marble Blast Ultra&quot;. First release was January 23, 2007 with the 4.2 Beta, production release of TGEA 1.0 and end of &quot;Early Adopter Program&quot; was on February 15 of the same year.

Although TGEA supported the existing Torque Legacy Terrain, TGEA incorporated entirely new terrain rendering engine, the Atlas Terrain Engine, which is an improvement over the blended terrains of TGE. Atlas used GPU hardware to render a massive terrain block and its textures. This allowed Atlas to scale with faster systems of the future. A shaded water rendering system was implemented with full reflection, refraction, and Fresnel reflection. TGEA incorporated a lighting system based on Torque Lighting Kit, including a light manager tool, scene lighting, and dynamic shadows among others.

Torque Game Engine Advanced 1.0 supported Direct3D rendering via an API-independent graphics layer. Future versions were expected to support both Direct3D and OpenGL pipelines to allow TGEA to support macOS and Linux platforms as well as Windows. There had also been planned TGEA compatibility with Microsoft&#x27;s game development suite for the Xbox 360, XNA Game Studio Express. TGEA contained several ready-to-apply shaders and common shader settings. Custom shaders based on High Level Shader Language could be compiled by the engine and applied as custom materials. This could be applied to both interior and exterior type 3D art assets. Fallback materials could be configured to allow support of pixel and vertex 1.x first-generation video cards.

The latest release of TGEA, 1.8.2, became available in November 2009. 

===Torque Lighting Kit===
Torque Lighting Kit was an expansion pack to the Torque Game Engine developed by John Kabus and Synapse Gaming. It added a variety of enhanced lighting features to the Torque Game Engine. In the latest release, features such as dynamic lighting and shadowing were added. Torque Lighting Kit was later included as part of Torque Game Engine 1.5 and Torque Game Engine Advanced. In 2008, Kabus and Synapse Gaming stopped supporting Torque, began a partnership with Microsoft, and packaged their lighting technology and other new tech into the Sunburn XNA Game Engine.

===Torque X===
After the release of Torque Game Builder, GarageGames began to develop Torque X, a game engine based on Torque Game Builder using a component system that allows multiple game objects to have the same abilities, running on Microsoft&#x27;s XNA Framework. Many of the 3D features were left incomplete and never finished. Specifically, 3D terrain using RAW height maps suffered from a lack of working examples, shadows were substandard (consisting only of a spherical shadow texture projected on the terrain), the ability to use skinned meshes for animated models was not working (non-skinned meshes worked), and the 3D rigid-body physics suffered from several issues.

== Reception and usage ==
The Torque engine and its derivatives have been used in the development of a variety of games, especially among independent video game developers.
Commercial titles developed using the Torque engine include &quot;BoneTown&quot;, &quot;Blockland&quot;, &quot;Marble Blast Gold&quot;, &quot;Minions of Mirth&quot;, &quot;TubeTwist&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Duck Hunting&quot;, &quot;Wildlife Tycoon: Venture Africa&quot;, &quot;ThinkTanks&quot;, &quot;The Destiny of Zorro&quot;, &quot;Penny Arcade Adventures&quot; and indie video games &quot;The Age of Decadence&quot;, &quot;BeamNG.drive&quot;, &quot;The Cat and the Coup&quot;, &quot;Dead State&quot;, &quot;Frozen Synapse&quot;, &quot;S.P.A.Z. and Villagers and Heroes&quot;. The open-source video game &quot;Uebergame&quot; also uses the engine.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Sheila Irene Pant was born in Almora, Kumaon in 1905 in a Kumaoni family that had converted to Christianity in 1869. She attended the University of Lucknow, where in 1927 she was awarded a BA degree in Economics and a Bachelor of Theology in Religious Studies. In 1929, she obtained a double MSc in Economics and Sociology. She began her career as a teacher in the Gokhale Memorial School after completing the Teachers Diploma Course from the Diocesan College, Calcutta. She was appointed as Professor of Economics at Indraprastha College, Delhi, in 1931 and met Liaqat Ali Khan in the same year when he visited to deliver a lecture on law. The couple married in 1932. At this time, she converted to Islam and took the name Begum Ra&#x27;ana (Gul-i-Rana) Liaqat Ali Khan. After the reorganisation of the Muslim League, Begum Ra&#x27;ana devoted herself to the task of creating political consciousness amongst the Muslim women society of the British Indian Empire. During this time, Ra&#x27;ana became an executive member of Jinnah&#x27;s Working Committee and served there as economical adviser. Her struggle for emancipation and support for Pakistan continued till the creation of Pakistan for Muslims of India in 1947.

==Pakistan Movement==

With her husband, Ra&#x27;ana strongly opposed the &quot;Simon Commission&quot;. While a Professor of Economics, Ra&#x27;ana intensely mobilised students from her college and went to the Legislative Assembly to hear her husband&#x27;s debate carrying placards of &quot;Simon Go Home&quot;. With Liaquat Ali Khan winning the debate, she became an instant hero with her friends. She later sold him a ticket to a stage show to raise funds for flood relief in Bihar. Ra&#x27;ana proved to be Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s constant partner and companion. She became politically involved with her husband and played a major role in the Pakistan Movement. She became a defining moment in Pakistan&#x27;s history when she accompanied her husband to London, United Kingdom in May 1933. There, she and Khan met with Jinnah at Hamstead Heath residence, and successfully convinced Jinnah to return to the British Indian Empire to resume the leadership of the All India Muslim League. Jinnah returned to India, and Ra&#x27;ana was appointed as an executive member of the Muslim League and the Chairperson of the Economic Division of the Party.

In 1942, when it became apparent that Imperial Japan was near attacking India, Jinnah summoned Ra&#x27;ana and said to her &quot;Be prepared to train the women. Islam doesn&#x27;t want women to be shut up and never see fresh air&quot;. To undertake this task, Ra&#x27;ana organised Muslim women in the same year, when she formed a small volunteer medical corps for nursing and first aid in Delhi. Begum Ra&#x27;ana played an important role in creating political awareness among women. Ra&#x27;ana was among the aspiring women in South Asia and encouraged hundreds of women to fight for Pakistan shoulder-to-shoulder with men.

==First Lady==

Ra&#x27;ana was the first First Lady of Pakistan. As First Lady, she initiated reforms for woman and child development and social progress of women, and played a major role for women&#x27;s part in Pakistan&#x27;s politics. After the assassination of her husband Liaquat Ali Khan in 1951, Begum Ra&#x27;ana continued her services for the social and economic benefit of women of Pakistan till her death in 1990. One of the daunting challenges for her was to organise health services for women and children migrating from India to Pakistan.

In 1947, as the refugees poured in from across the border, amidst the most pitiable of conditions with cholera, diarrhoea and smallpox being common sights everywhere, she called upon women to come forward and collect food and medical supplies from government offices. The women came forward despite the resistance they faced from certain sections of society, including certain newspapers where they were attacked in the most vicious manner by elements that did not want women to come out from their &quot;four walls&quot;. She firmly believed that for a society to do justice to itself, it was pertinent that women played their due role in reforming society alongside the men.

During this point in Pakistan&#x27;s history there weren&#x27;t many nurses in Karachi, so Begum Liaquat asked the army to train women to give injections and first aid. Women were thus trained in three to six-month courses and as such the para-military forces for women were formed. The Pakistan Army quickly established Army Medical Corps and recruited a large number of women nurses as army nurses. During this period, girls were also personally encouraged by Begum Liaquat to take up nursing as a profession. They were also taught the rifle drill, to decode ciphers, typing and a host of other duties so they could be useful in times of national crisis like the refugee crisis of 1947.

===Initiatives for women===
Ra&#x27;ana founded the Women&#x27;s National Guard (PWNG), and helped established the Women&#x27;s Naval Reserves in the Navy, and was appointed as the Chief Controller. For her immense services to the military as a civilian, the Pakistan Army notably appointed her as the first woman Brigadier, and an honorary uniform was issued especially for her. The Pakistan Woman National Guard was intended to fight for women&#x27;s rights and aimed to prevent brutal treatment of women, either received from their spouses or caused by domestic violence. At first, the organisation was successful and took strong initiatives in West-Pakistan to lower the rate of violence against women, as she was the organisation&#x27;s president. But after her husband&#x27;s death, Ra&#x27;ana left Pakistan as she was appointed Pakistan&#x27;s Ambassador to the Netherlands. Following her departure, the Pakistan Women National Guard was soon disbanded due to financial distress and the government&#x27;s apathy. However, the Pakistan Woman Naval Reserves still continues as of today where many women joined the Navy through this program. The program has lasting effects in Pakistan&#x27;s Armed Forces, and the Army and Air Force later established a Woman Reserves program as part of her vision.

===Establishment of APWA===
In 1949, Begum Ra&#x27;ana arranged a conference of over 100 active women from all over Pakistan. The conference announced the formation of a and non-political organisation for the social, educational and cultural uplift of the women, named All Pakistan Women&#x27;s Association (APWA). She was nominated as its first president and unlike Pakistan Women National Guard, the APWA continued to grow as it continuously fought for women&#x27;s rights in Pakistan. For its services, the Government of Pakistan established APWA College in Lahore as part of its struggle.

== Career as stateswoman ==
After her husband&#x27;s death, Ra&#x27;ana went on to start her career as a stateswoman that lasted more than 2 decades. In 1952, Ra&#x27;ana was the first Muslim woman delegate to the United Nations. In 1954, the Government of Pakistan had appointed her as Pakistan&#x27;s Ambassador to the Netherlands, and also was the first woman ambassador of Pakistan. She represented Pakistan in the Netherlands until 1961 and was also the doyen of the Diplomatic Corps. In June 1966, she was appointed as Pakistan&#x27;s Ambassador to Italy and stayed there until 1965. Later, she was directed to Tunisia as Pakistan&#x27;s Ambassador to Tunisia and held this position until March 1966. Following her return to Pakistan, Ra&#x27;ana joined Rana Liaquat Ali Khan Government College of Home Economics as Professor of Economics and stayed there until 1973. The Government College University awarded her an honorary doctorate in economics and conferred her with a Doctor of Philosophy in Economics in 1967.

===Bhutto&#x27;s companion===
In 1972, as Pakistan was dismembered and going through an intense crisis, Ra&#x27;ana joined hands with then-President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his political movement, and joined the socialist government of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Ra&#x27;ana was part of Bhutto&#x27;s Ministry of Finance and Economics and played a major and influential role in decisions being made concerning economics. Bhutto encouraged her to participate in upcoming elections, and won elections of 1973. Bhutto did not waste time to appoint Ra&#x27;ana as Governor of Sindh Province. Ra&#x27;ana then became the first woman governor in Pakistan. She was also the first Chancellor of Sindh University and Karachi University. She continued her term until 1976 when new elections were held. Ra&#x27;ana again contested in the 1977 parliamentary elections but did not take the gubernatorial office due to martial law imposed by General Zia-ul-Haq, Chief of Army Staff of the Pakistan Army. She was one of the personalities that argued against the martial law and against the execution of Bhutto. On the day when Bhutto was executed, Ra&#x27;ana was reported to be disheartened and emotionally distressed and cried over Bhutto&#x27;s death for more than three days constantly. Ra&#x27;ana launched an anti-Zia campaign and fought against the military government of General Zia-ul-Haq. She single-handedly took on Pakistan&#x27;s most powerful man, General Zia-ul-Haq, at that time. It was during the 1980s, when she, despite her illness and old age, publicly attacked the general for passing Islamic laws that were contradictory to Islamic teachings and clearly against women. The general, out of respect for her position in society and achievements, decided to leave her alone.

==Death==

Begum Liaquat died on 13 June 1990 and was buried next to her husband in the precincts of the Quaid-e-Azam&#x27;s Mausoleum. With her has ended a historic period for the women and youth of Pakistan who, in future generations, will no doubt seek inspiration from Begum Liaquat&#x27;s life and contributions to the emancipation of women.

==Honors and legacy==

Ra&#x27;ana is considered one of the greatest female leaders Pakistan has produced. In Pakistan, she is given the title of &quot;Mother of Pakistan&quot;, received in 1950. Ra&#x27;ana continues to be seen as a symbol of selfless service to the cause of humanity and uplift of women. In recognition of her lifelong struggle for women&#x27;s rights, she was awarded the United Nations Human Rights Award in 1978. Her many other awards and medals include the Jane Adam&#x27;s Medal in 1950, Woman of Achievement Medal 1950, Mother of Pakistan in 1950, Nishan-i-Imtiaz in 1959, Grand Cross of Orange Nassau in 1961 (the Netherlands), International Gimbel Award 1962, Woman of the World in 1965 chosen by the Turkish Women&#x27;s Association, Ankara, and Vavaliera di Gran Croce in 1966 (Italy).

<doc id="1236969" wikidata="Q7016141" url="?curid=1236969" title="1960 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1960 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 33rd term. It saw the governing Labour Party defeated by the National Party, putting an end to the short second Labour government.

==Background==
The Labour Party had won the 1957 election by a narrow margin, beginning New Zealand&#x27;s second period of Labour government. However, the new administration soon lost its narrow lead in public opinion, with its financial policies being the principal cause of dissatisfaction. The so-called &quot;Black Budget&quot;, introduced by finance minister Arnold Nordmeyer, increased taxes substantially, with particularly large increases for alcohol and tobacco taxes; Labour became widely seen as both miserly and puritanical. The government defended its tax increases as a necessary measure to avert a balance of payments crisis, but the opposition, led by Keith Holyoake, made substantial gains out of the issue throughout the parliamentary term.

Both parties crafted narratives on the history of the balance of payments crisis in the lead up to the election. Holyoake tried to argue that overseas funds had not fallen as much as Nash said in 1957, and that Labour had produced a panic budget. Moreover, the over-importing was due to a fear of import controls if Labour should win. Nash continued to stress that National had produced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and that Labour had averted further disaster by its action. Coincidentally, at the beginning of the election another drop in overseas funds occurred, but neither party commented much about it.

Labour&#x27;s main policy platform was on industrialization particularly with new cotton mills in Nelson. Nash constantly repeated the theme people in New Zealand had &#x27;never been so well off&#x27; and pamphlets stated &#x27;everyone, everywhere, will again be better off&#x27;, closely mirroring British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan&#x27;s winning slogan in 1959, &#x27;You&#x27;ve never had it so good&#x27;. National&#x27;s campaign promised to lower taxes, reduce import controls and abolish compulsory unionism.

A very thorough study of the election by three political scientists concluded that National&#x27;s preparations for the election, organization, and publicity were much better than Labour&#x27;s which was the main reason for the result with little substantial differences between the parties in policy. National&#x27;s party organisation recognised their win was mostly due to public mood against Labour and many traditional Labour voters not bothering to vote. As a result Labour&#x27;s vote share had fallen more than National&#x27;s had risen.

===MPs retiring in 1960===
Five National MPs and four Labour MPs intended to retire at the end of the 32nd Parliament.

==The election==
The date for the main 1960 election was 26 November. 1,310,742 people were registered to vote, and turnout was 89.8%. This turnout was slightly lower than what had been recorded in the previous elections. The number of seats being contested was 80, a number which had been fixed since 1902.

==Opinion polling==
Polling ahead of the 1960 New Zealand general election was limited, but three polls conducted by Gallup provided insight into voter preferences leading up to the election. These polls give a snapshot of party support in the months before the vote. The results are outlined in the table below:

==Results==
The 1960 election saw the governing Labour Party defeated by a twelve-seat margin, having previously held a two-seat majority. National won a total of 46 seats to Labour&#x27;s 34 seats, and formed the second National government. In the popular vote, National won 47.59% to Labour&#x27;s 43.42%.

The Social Credit Party won 8.62% of the vote, but no seats. Three of their candidates missed the nomination deadline, and the opening address of the party leader P. H. Matthews was not noteworthy.

Three new National members of parliament were called the &quot;Young Turks&quot;: Peter Gordon, Duncan MacIntyre and Robert Muldoon. The other new National MPs were Esme Tombleson, Bill Brown, Harry Lapwood, Logan Sloane, Bert Walker, and Dan Riddiford.

Paddy Blanchfield, Ron Bailey, Norman Douglas and George Spooner entered parliament for Labour.

<doc id="1236976" wikidata="Q377106" url="?curid=1236976" title="Salt Lake Valley">
<text>Salt Lake Valley is a valley in Salt Lake County in the north-central portion of the U.S. state of Utah. It contains Salt Lake City and many of its suburbs, notably Murray, Sandy, South Jordan, West Jordan, and West Valley City; its total population is 1,029,655 as of 2010. 

Brigham Young said, &quot;this is the right place,&quot; when he and his fellow Mormon settlers moved into Utah after being driven out of several states.

==Geography==
The Valley is surrounded in every direction except the northwest by steep mountains that at some points rise from the valley floor&#x27;s base elevation. It lies nearly encircled by the Wasatch Mountains on the east, the Oquirrh Mountains on the west, Traverse Ridge to the south and the Great Salt Lake on the northwest, with the peaks of Antelope Island visible.

Every entrance into the valley is extremely narrow and often congested. They include the Point of the Mountain to the south via the Jordan Narrows, a gap in the Traverse Mountains, narrow entrances between the Great Salt Lake and Oquirrh Mountains to the northwest and the Great Salt Lake and the Wasatch Mountains to the north, and several canyons to the east including Parley&#x27;s Canyon and Emigration Canyon.

Flowing from Utah Lake in Utah Valley in the south, the Jordan River runs north through a gap in the Traverse Mountains, bisecting the Valley before emptying into the Great Salt Lake. The Jordan River, along with numerous mountain streams and reservoirs, provides irrigation water to the rapidly growing Valley.

The geography of the Salt Lake Valley combined with the prevalence of fossil fuel burning vehicles leads to poor air quality in Utah.

==Development==

A company known as Kennecott Land, which owns the eastern foothills of the Oquirrhs in the western part of the valley, recently drafted a plan that would develop the rest of the entire valley within 75 years, adding at least 500,000 residents. The first development, known as the Daybreak Community, has substantial portions already completed but continues construction. It will focus on transit-oriented development (it already has service by TRAX light rail and will also feature a ski resort in the Oquirrh Mountains and a university campus).

Interstate 15 runs north to south through the middle-eastern portion of the Valley and Interstate 80 runs east to west in the northern quarter of the Valley from Parley&#x27;s Canyon into Tooele County to the west (where it cuts across a small portion of the Great Salt Lake). The Interstate 215 belt route, State Route 154 (Bangerter Highway), State Route 201 (21st South Freeway), and State Route 85 (Mountain View Corridor) are also major transportation routes. The Utah Transit Authority operates an extensive bus system across the Wasatch Front, including the Salt Lake Valley, in addition to three light rail lines (known as TRAX) in the Valley. A commuter rail line known as &quot;FrontRunner&quot; runs north to Pleasant View in Weber County and south to Provo in Utah County.

<text>The Amur Cart Road or Amur Wheel Road ( or , ) was a cartage road in Amur Oblast of Imperial Russia that connected Khabarovsk with Blagoveshchensk through mostly uninhabited areas of taiga and swamps. 

The road was built during 1898–1909 with nearly exclusive usage of katorga prison labor. It was praised as a success in its use of penal labor, claiming that no other country had any prison labor project comparable in scale. In 1905 over 700 convicts were simultaneously at work on the road. In this respect it was unsurpassed in the Gulag system of the Soviet Union.

<doc id="1237002" wikidata="Q1908610" url="?curid=1237002" title="Milk River, Alberta">
<text>Milk River is a town in Alberta, Canada that is named after the Milk River which flows immediately to its south. This location results in Milk River being one of the few Canadian communities within the Mississippi River drainage system. It is south of Lethbridge, and from the Canada–United States border.

There are over 50 rock art sites, with thousands of figures, as well as numerous archeological sites. The park is located approximately 40 km east of Milk River.

== Government ==

The town is governed by a town council composed of a mayor and four councillors. Municipal elections are held every four years.

== Infrastructure ==
The town is connected to two highways: Highway 4, which heads south to Interstate 15 and north to Lethbridge, and Highway 501, which heads west to Cardston and east to Saskatchewan. Air service is provided by Milk River Airport and rail service is offered through Canadian Pacific Kansas City.

<text>The quarter, short for quarter dollar, is a Canadian coin worth 25 cents or one-fourth of a Canadian dollar. It is a small, circular coin of silver colour. According to the Royal Canadian Mint, the official name for the coin is the 25-cent piece, but in practice, it is usually called a &quot;quarter&quot;, much like its American counterpart. In Canadian French, it is called a caribou. The coin is produced at the mint&#x27;s facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

==History==
===Early coinage (1870–1910)===
The first coinage minted for what would later become the Canadian Confederation originated in legislation enacted in 1853. Per the Act 16 Vict. c. 158, the Province of Canada was to issue &quot;dollars, cents, and mills&quot; that would co-circulate with English shillings and pence. While bronze and silver coins were initially struck at the Royal Mint in 1858, these only included currency up to twenty-cents. When the first coinage for the Dominion of Canada was struck in 1870, only silver coins were issued, which included a twenty-five cent piece in substitution for the twenty-cent coin. This denomination change brought the new monetary system, which was based on the United States gold dollar concurrently with the British sovereign, into conformity with the United States quarter. In a related event, the Canadian government also issued twenty-five cent notes to provide the country with fractional currency. By doing so, this relieved the &quot;strain consequent&quot; upon the removal from circulation of United States silver.

Canadian quarters initially weighed 89.66 grains and were roughly 24 mm in diameter with a plain edge. The obverse featured a portrait of Queen Victoria (designed by Leonard C. Wyon) wearing a tiara, while the reverse had the denomination and date under a crown within a wreath. Public opinion of this new coin was positive as the &quot;American Journal of Numismatics&quot; and &quot;Bulletin of American Numismatic and Archæological Societies&quot; noted that the quarter was considered &quot;more convenient than the old twenty cent piece&quot;. In 1871, two varieties of quarters co-circulated: those without a mintmark were made by the Royal Mint, while &quot;H&quot; marked coins were made in Birmingham, England, by Ralph Heaton &amp; Sons. Heaton &amp; Sons continued to mint only &quot;H&quot; marked quarters for 1872. No quarters were struck by the Royal Mint or Heaton for Canada in 1873 as there was an increased demand for &quot;Imperial coinage&quot;. Heaton continued to mint quarters for Canada afterward from 1874 to 1883. There was a four-year hiatus during this period as the coins were transitioned from a plan to a milled edge.

Enlargements to the facilities at the Royal Mint were completed in 1883, which meant they could handle Canadian coin production. Quarters that date from 1884 to 1889 were all struck at the Royal Mint in London before Heaton was called for again. The Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Montreal commented in their entry for 1890 that this choice indicated that there was a rush of business at the Royal Mint that year. Coinage returned to the Royal Mint in 1891 and Canadian quarters were struck there through the remainder of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign. When Edward VII ascended to the throne in 1901, a new obverse portrait for the quarter was used. British medalist George William de Saulles designed a right-facing bust of the king surrounded by the words &quot;&quot;. Canadian quarters continued to be struck in England until 1907 with the opening of the Ottawa Mint. When Edward VII died in 1910, a controversy arose in the following year with a new portrait design for George V.

===Georgian coinage (1911–1952)===
King George V&#x27;s portrait was designed by Australian sculptor and medalist Bertram Mackennal with the words &quot;; however, this was criticized by the public as the decision to omit &quot; (by the grace of God) was called &quot;godless&quot; and &quot;graceless&quot;. As a result, the words were added into the design the following year. On May 11, 1920, a new coinage act was put into place that affected the amount of silver in the quarter. While the previous &quot;British standard&quot; fineness of .925 silver (sterling) was reduced to .800, the weight and diameter of the quarter remained the same. This act was put into place as the price of silver had risen due to the aftermath of World War I. No quarters were minted between 1921 and 1927 as the rising price of silver made them unprofitable. When quarter production resumed in 1927, the Royal Canadian Mint initially planned to strike commemorative coins to celebrate Canada&#x27;s 60th anniversary. Although a winning design was chosen for the quarter, it was never used as the plan was scrapped.

No more proposed changes to the quarter were made during the remaining years of King George V&#x27;s reign. When he died in January 1936, his son Edward VIII assumed the throne but soon abdicated in December 1936. After his brother George VI assumed the throne on December 11, 1936, a new effigy was needed for Canadian coinage. As it was late in the year, the Royal Mint could not immediately make coins with a die depicting the new king with a 1937 date. It was instead decided by the mint to continue minting 1936 dated quarters with a dot added below the date on the reverse which signified that they were made in 1937. The new effigy of George VI was designed by Humphrey Paget and was ready for use later in the year. The king is shown on the obverse side facing left, with the inscription &quot;&quot;. During this time, new reverse designs were also planned for circulating denominations below fifty cents. Initial proposals included a caribou design for the five-cent coin, a beaver design for the ten-cent coin, and the &quot;Bluenose&quot; for the twenty-five-cent coin. After some debate, the head of a caribou was designed by Canadian sculptor Emanuel Hahn for the quarter.

India&#x27;s declaration of independence in 1947 affected the quarter, as the words (Emperor of India) had to be removed from the obverse of the coin. This change was made under article 7.2 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Indian Independence Act 1947. As the dies omitting the title were not immediately ready for use, a small maple leaf was added next to the 1947 dated coins on the reverse for quarters minted into 1948. King George VI died in 1952 and a new obverse effigy featuring Queen Elizabeth II appeared in the following year.

===Elizabeth II (1953–1989)===
The first effigy of Queen Elizabeth II was designed by sculptor and medalist Mary Gillick, who chose to depict the queen at 27 years old facing right. As with the previous monarchs, her effigy is surrounded with Latin text which reads &quot;&quot; (Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen). For Canadian coinage, this marked the first time that master dies were made at the Royal Canadian Mint. During production, the diameter of the quarter was increased from 23.6 to 23.9 mm. For reasons unknown, these were also struck in two major varieties, &quot;with a shoulder fold&quot; and &quot;without a shoulder fold&quot; (or strap) on the new effigy. While quarters dated 1954 have a low mintage, an increased demand for small change (felt most with dimes and quarters) boosted production by 50% in the following year. In 1964, Queen Elizabeth approved a second effigy of herself on Canadian coinage which was made by British artist and sculptor Arnold Machin. This second bust features the Queen facing right while wearing a tiara surrounded by Latin text where &quot;&quot; is abbreviated again to read &quot;D.G.&quot;

When silver prices rose sharply in the mid-1960s, the Canadian government initially set 1966 as a proposed transition year for an alternative alloy for coinage. This proposed year in actuality is when a government committee was formed on the matter and nickel was chosen to replace silver. Two major events regarding the Canadian quarter occurred in 1967. During this year Canada celebrated its centennial with special circulating commemoratives. According to James A. Haxby of the Royal Canadian Mint, a prowling bobcat was chosen for the centennial quarter to express &quot;intelligent independence and decisive action&quot;. At the same time, the silver content was lowered from 80% to 50% by a proclamation which was authorized on August 17, 1967. This mid-year change meant that two varieties were produced that differ in their silver content. A similar event occurred in 1968 as the quarter was transitioned from 50% silver to pure nickel.

The caribou design continued to be used until 1973 when the quarter got a special commemorative design which honored the centennial of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. During this time, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s obverse bust was modified to be slightly smaller. These changes took full effect when the caribou design was restored to the reverse in the following year. Halfway through the decade, in April 1975, Canadian quarters were produced at the newly constructed mint facility in Winnipeg. Although nickel was by then dominant, silver quarters of both amounts (50% and 80%) continued to circulate until at least 1979. It was estimated by the mid-1980s that it cost the mint five cents to produce a nickel-alloyed quarter.

===Elizabeth II (1990–2022)===
In 1990, a third effigy of the Queen was used for Canadian quarters, designed by Hungarian-Canadian sculptor Dora de Pedery-Hunt. This third design depicts Elizabeth II when she was 64 years old surrounded by the previously used Latin script. The lowest mintage of any circulated quarter post–World War II occurred in 1991 as the Royal Canadian Mint prepared resources for the following year. For this event, Canada celebrated its 125th anniversary in 1992 by minting twelve circulating commemorative quarters.

<text>The Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) is a motoring club and mutual organisation. It offers various services to members, including insurance and roadside assistance.

It has about 30,000 ordinary club members and 2.1 million service members who hold any product offered by RACV.

It operates two clubs for members, in the Melbourne central business district and in Healesville. The City Club was redeveloped in 2005, the Healesville Country Club in 2009.

==History==
Automobile Club of Victoria was founded at a meeting held at the Port Phillip Club Hotel on 9 December 1903 called by Syd Day, Henry James and James G. Coleman. Henry James Joseph &quot;Harry&quot; Maddox (1862-1937) was elected as its first President, and H.B. &quot;Harry&quot; James, its first secretary. At that first meeting, a proposal from Henry Sutton, the Australian motoring pioneer, was unanimously adopted:
::&quot;that the objects of the club should be the promotion of a social organisation and club, composed mainly of persons owning self-propelled vehicles or motor cycles; to afford a means of recording the experiences of members and others using motor cars and motor cycles; to promote investigation in their development; to co-operate in securing rational legislation and the formation of proper rules and regulations governing the use of motor cars and motor cycles in cities, towns and country districts; to maintain the lawful rights and privileges and protect the interests of owners and users of all forms of self-propelled vehicles whenever and wherever such interests, rights and privileges are menaced; to promote and encourage the improvement, construction and maintenance of roads and highways and the development generally in this State of motoring, and to maintain a club to be devoted to the interests and advancement of automobilism.&quot;

It held its first car rally at Aspendale Racecourse in 1904. In 1916, the club received the approval of King George V to prefix the title &quot;Royal&quot; to its name.
It is an unlisted public company, limited by guarantee, and headed by a board of directors consisting of eleven independent non-executive directors and a managing director and CEO. The registered office is located in the Melbourne central business district. It was a founder of the insurance brand AAMI, previously known as Club Motor Insurance and now owned by Suncorp-Metway.

==&quot;RoyalAuto&quot; magazine==
RACV produces a magazine for its members, called &quot;RoyalAuto&quot;. It is published and distributed 11 times a year – monthly from February to November, and a combined December/January edition. The content is based on the three major topics: travel/touring and associated leisure content, motoring/mobility – mainly new and used car reviews and news, and news and programs which touch on broader mobility issues including road safety, public transport and the environment – and member benefits/news. As at March 2013, &quot;RoyalAuto&quot; had an audited circulation of 1.5 million, making it the largest-circulating publication in Victoria. It is the state&#x27;s most-read monthly magazine.

An RACV member magazine has been produced for more than 90 years, beginning in 1922 as a monthly supplement in &quot;The Australian Motorist&quot;. By the mid-1920s, it was launched as a stand-alone publication called &quot;The Royal Auto Journal&quot;. In 1936, this changed to &quot;The Radiator&quot;, a newspaper-style journal. In 1953, the magazine became a colour publication called &quot;Royalauto&quot;, and now it is formally presented as &quot;RoyalAuto&quot;. In September 2012 a digital version, for iPad, was produced for the first time, and each digital edition is produced concurrently with the print magazine. In August 2013, it was rated among the top 1% of magazine apps worldwide by app rating agency iMonitor. In November 2013, &quot;RoyalAuto&quot; was named Association or Member Organisation Magazine of the Year by Publishers Australia in its Excellence Awards 2013.

<text>Doug Church (born November 16, 1968, in Evanston, Illinois), is an American video game designer and producer. He attended MIT in the late 1980s, but left and went to work with Looking Glass Studios, when they were making primarily MS-DOS-based immersive sim games, including &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot;, &quot;Ultima Underworld II&quot;, &quot;System Shock&quot; and &quot;Thief&quot;. His colleague Warren Spector claims, in fact, that Church was the one who originally coined the term &quot;immersive simulation&quot;.

Later, Church joined Eidos Interactive as technical director, lending programming and design expertise on a number of games from Ion Storm and Crystal Dynamics, including extensive design work on &quot;Tomb Raider: Legend&quot;. In 2005, he left Eidos to join Electronic Arts.

In 2003, Church was given the International Game Developers Association&#x27;s Community Contribution award, in part for his work as co-chair of the IGDA&#x27;s educational committee developing relationships between the game industry and academia. He has also participated in many of the Indie Game Jams, including developing &quot;Angry God Bowling,&quot; the prototypical game for the first IGJ.

In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.

From July 2005 to 2009, Church worked at Electronic Arts&#x27; Los Angeles office, as team leader on a project supervised by filmmaker Steven Spielberg.

On March 16, 2011, Valve announced that Church had been hired for an undisclosed position and project.

In August 2016, OtherSide Entertainment announced that Church had been hired as a creative consultant for the development of &quot;System Shock 3&quot;.

<text>Nikolaus Joseph Freiherr von Jacquin (16 February 172726 October 1817) was a scientist who studied medicine, chemistry and botany.

==Biography==
Born in Leiden in the Netherlands, he studied medicine at Leiden University, then moved first to Paris and afterward to Vienna. In 1752, he studied under Gerard van Swieten in Vienna.

Between 1755 and 1759, Jacquin was sent to the West Indies, Central America, Venezuela and New Granada by Francis I to collect plants for the Schönbrunn Palace, and amassed a large collection of animal, plant and mineral samples. In 1797, Alexander von Humboldt profited from studying these collections and conversing with Jacquin in preparation of his own journey to the Americas.

In 1763, Jacquin became professor of chemistry and mineralogy at the Bergakademie Schemnitz (now Banská Štiavnica in Slovakia). In 1768, he was appointed Professor of Botany and Chemistry and became director of the botanical gardens of the University of Vienna. For his work, he received the title &quot;Edler&quot; in 1774. In 1783, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1806, he was created a baron. In 1809, he became a correspondent of the Royal Institute, which later became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

His younger son, Emil Gottfried (1767–1792), and his daughter, Franziska (1769–1850), were friends of Mozart; Mozart wrote two songs for Gottfried to publish under Gottfried&#x27;s name (&quot;Als Luise ...&quot;, K. 520, and &quot;Das Traumbild&quot;, K. 530) and gave piano lessons to Franziska. Mozart dedicated a considerable number of his works to the Jacquin family, notably the Kegelstatt Trio. This was first played at the Jacquins&#x27; house in August 1786 with Franziska playing the piano.

His son Joseph Franz (1766–1839) succeeded him as professor of botany and chemistry at the University of Vienna and wrote several notable botanical books.

Von Jacquin died in Vienna.

He is commemorated by the genera &quot;Jacquinia&quot; (Theophrastaceae) and &quot;Jacquiniella&quot; (Orchidaceae). In 2011, the Austrian Mint issued silver coins to mark his science expeditions to the Caribbean.

<doc id="1237034" wikidata="Q174483" url="?curid=1237034" title="Essingen (Württemberg)">
<text>Essingen is a municipality in the Ostalbkreis in the State of Baden-Württemberg in Germany. It lies about 73 km east of Stuttgart, just outside the city of Aalen. The Rems river begins just outside Essingen, on its way down the Remstal (Rems Valley) to merge with the Neckar near Stuttgart.

Essingen currently has about 6500 residents, and is located on the northern end of the Swabian Alb. It is mainly a dormitory community, but does have industry along the B29 federal road and Stuttgart-Aalen railway.

Recreational activities include biking, hiking, and rambling. In the winter, there are opportunities for skiing.

In the middle of the village lies the Schloss (castle) and Schloss Park. The castle was built circa 1550 by the Woellwarth Family. It has remained in the family until recently when it was sold at auction causing much controversy in the village. Some villagers wanted to save the castle to be used for various activities and events but the consensus was that the castle would be too expensive to maintain and run.

Essingen is a larger municipality, and the nearby villages of Lauterburg, Forst, Dauerwang, Hermannsfeld, Birkenteich and Hohenroden belong to Essingen.

==Mayor==
Wolfgang Hofer (* 1963) was elected mayor in 1997, he was reelected in 2005, 2013 and 2021.

==Local council==

Elections in June 2024:
*Free voters: 9 seats
*CDU/Free citizens Essingen: 8 seats
*SPD: 3 seats
*The Greens: 4 seats

<doc id="1237046" wikidata="Q13424765" url="?curid=1237046" title="Charity label">
<text>A charity label is a label resembling a postage stamp, sold by charities to raise funds. They are generally intended to be used on mail, as a way of advertising the sender&#x27;s support of the charity&#x27;s cause.

Christmas Seals and Easter Seals are perhaps the two best-known types, although many kinds have been made.

While designed to look like postage stamps, they only rarely include a denomination, and never the name of a country. They are distinct from charity stamps which also include a charge for postage.

Charity labels are one of several kinds of cinderella stamp.

<doc id="1237050" wikidata="Q17019925" url="?curid=1237050" title="Music of Guam">
<text>The music of [[Guam]] encompasses a broad range of traditional and contemporary music. Modern music from Guam includes elements of American, Spanish, Filipino and Polynesian music. The Spanish and Mexicans contributed a type of song called &quot;serenatas&quot; to the culture of Guam. Some traditional Catholic songs in the Spanish language, including &quot;Mil Albricias&quot;, &quot;Pastores a Belen&quot;, &quot;Santa Maria de la Merced&quot; or &quot;En Lecho de Pajas&quot; and some traditional love songs including &quot;A mi morena&quot;, &quot;Ay que triste desventura&quot;, &quot;Cancion de Antonio Acosta&quot; or &quot;Te quiero amar&quot; are preserved. Flora Baza Quan is known as the &quot;Queen of Chamorro Music&quot;. The state song of Guam is &quot;Stand Ye Guamanians&quot; by Ramon Sablan, adopted in 1919, but better known as the 1974 Chamoru translation by Lagrimas Untalan, &quot;Fanohge Chamoru.&quot; 

== Music venues and institutions ==
Music institutions in Guam include the University of Guam&#x27;s Fine Arts Department, Guam Symphony Society, Guam Choristers, Cantate Guam, and the Gregorian Institute of Guam. The Guam Symphony Society was founded in 1967, and hosts concerts such as the Symphony Seaside Concert and the Musikan Famagu&#x27;on for children. The two major local record labels are Napu Records and StelStar Records. In addition to the previously stated, there is the government sponsored Guam Territorial Band. The Guam territorial band hosts concerts yearly often free to the public, as well as representing Guam music on an international stage.

== Chamorro music ==
Traditional Chamorro instruments include the belembaotuyan, a hollow gourd stringed instrument, and the nose flute. Kantan singing is also popular. It is a kind of work song, begun by one person teasing another in verse form, and then continuing through a group one individual in turn.

Chamorro chants and Kantan Chamorrita (&quot;Chamorrita singing&quot;), a kind of Chamorro poetry, are also important elements of Guamanian music. Kantan Chamorrita is a kind of improvised poetry with a call and response format that is documented back to 1602 and remains a vital part of Chamorro culture. In Kantan Chamorrita, individuals and groups trade witty remarks at each other as part of a debate. These songs are &quot;ancient folk songs, arranged in quatrains of two octosyllabic couplets, which, according to some writers, are composed on a single melody, the variations depending on the individual style of performance. The distinctive features are spontaneous improvisation and a dialogue performance between two or more people, depending on the occasion and function.&quot;
=== Performers ===
Chamorro popular musicians include KACY, Flora Baza Quan, Daniel De Leon Guerrero, and singer-songwriter J. D. Crutch.

The musical duo Gus and Doll (Agusto Quichocho and his wife Josephine Sablan Quichocho) were prominent performers of Chamorro music, active until the late 1980s.

Modern singer Pia Mia is the only artist from Guam to have a song on the Billboard Top 100, 2015&#x27;s &quot;Do It Again.&quot;

<doc id="1237052" wikidata="Q758847" url="?curid=1237052" title="Audio Engineering Society">
<text>The Audio Engineering Society (AES) is a professional body for engineers, scientists, other individuals with an interest or involvement in the professional audio industry. The membership largely comprises engineers developing devices or products for audio, and persons working in audio content production. It also includes acousticians, audiologists, academics, and those in other disciplines related to audio. The AES is the only worldwide professional society devoted exclusively to audio technology.

Established in 1948, the Society develops, reviews and publishes engineering standards for the audio and related media industries, and produces the AES Conventions, which are held twice a year alternating between Europe and the US. The AES and individual regional or national &quot;sections&quot; also hold &quot;AES Conferences&quot; on different topics during the year.

==History==
The idea of a society dedicated solely to audio engineering had been discussed for some time before the first meeting, but was first proposed in print in a letter by Frank E. Sherry, of Victoria, Texas, in the December 1947 issue of the magazine &quot;Audio Engineering&quot;. A New York engineer and audio consultant, C.J. LeBel, then published a letter agreeing, and saying that a group of audio professionals had already been discussing such a thing, and that they were interested in holding an organizational meeting. He asked interested persons to contact him for details. The response was enthusiastic and encouraging. Fellow engineer Norman C. Pickering published the date for an organizational meeting, and announced the appointment of LeBel as acting chairman, and himself as acting secretary.

The organizational meeting was held at the RCA Victor Studios in New York City on February 17, 1948. Acting chairman LeBel spoke first, emphasizing the professional, non-commercial, independent nature of the proposed organization. Acting Secretary Norman Pickering then discussed the need for a professional organization that could foster an exchange of knowledge in this quickly-growing field. The group agreed to form the Audio Engineering Society, and confirmed the acting executive committee, which consisted of John D. Colvin, C. J. LeBel, C. G. McProud, Norman C. Pickering and Chester O. Rackey.

The first AES technical membership meeting followed on March 11, with about 3500 attendees. The guest speaker at the first meeting was Harry F. Olson, a prominent engineer and scientist at RCA and author of &quot;Acoustical Engineering&quot;, who spoke on &quot;Problems of High-Fidelity Reproduction&quot;.

==Membership==
 has over 12,000 members. Members elect a Board of Governors and officers, who jointly set policies and procedures for the Society. The AES is a tax-exempt, 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation headquartered in New York.

==Journal==
The AES publishes a peer-reviewed journal, the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society (JAES).

==Conventions and conferences==
The AES produces two conventions each year as well as a number of topic-specific conferences. The fall convention is in North America and the spring convention is in Europe. The first convention was in 1949.

==Technical Council==
23 Technical Committees advise the AES Technical Council on emerging trends and areas of interest in the audio engineering community. The Committee meetings, held at Conventions, are open to participation by members and non-members alike, and are the venue for planning workshops, seminars and conferences in specific technical areas.

==Standards==
The AES has been involved in setting technical standards for audio since 1977. The (AESSC), through a consensus system open to anyone materially affected by such standards, develops and publishes a number of standards on the subject of analog and digital audio recording, transmission, and/or reproduction. Notable standards include:

* AES3 (also commonly known as AES/EBU) for digital audio interconnection
* AES10 (also commonly known as MADI) for multichannel digital audio interconnection
* AES11 for digital audio synchronization
* AES31 file exchange format
* AES42 for digitally interfaced microphones
* AES47, AES51 and AES53 for sending AES3 digital audio data over Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks
* AES48 on interconnections; grounding and EMC practices; and shields of connectors in audio equipment containing active circuitry

==British section==

The AES British Section, which was the first and is also the largest outside the US, issues a monthly newsletter and holds regular lectures, usually in London, with occasional visits to studios and other places of interest. Lectures, which are often on topics of topical interest to audio enthusiasts are usually recorded, with past lectures available to all as free MP3 downloads, sometimes with accompanying slides in PDF format.

==Connection with the VDT==

Although there are several German sections of the AES and there is no formal connection to the Verband Deutscher Tonmeister, the goals and activities of both organizations are closely related and there are several instances of double memberships, e.g. in the persons of Benjamin Bernfeld, Gerhard Steinke and Günther Theile.

<doc id="1237054" wikidata="Q952294" url="?curid=1237054" title="Spirits Bay">
<text>Spirits Bay, officially named Piwhane / Spirits Bay, is a remote bay at the northern end of the Aupōuri Peninsula, which forms the northern tip of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It lies between Cape Reinga / Te Rerenga Wairua in the west and Ngataea / Hooper Point in the east. It is one of two bays in the short length of coast at the top of the North Island (the other being Takapaukura / Tom Bowling Bay, further to the east).

Kapowairua, a locality at the eastern end of Spirits Bay, has a campsite managed by the Department of Conservation. A walking path of about 8.5 kilometres (5.3 miles) runs along the bay.

== History and culture ==
The Māori tribe of the area is Ngāti Kurī.

The bay was given the official name of &quot;Piwhane / Spirits Bay&quot; in 2015.

The bay is considered a sacred place in Māori culture as according to local legend, it is the location where spirits of the dead gather to depart from this world to travel to their ancestral home (or afterlife) from a large old pōhutukawa tree above the bay.

The bay has two Māori names, &quot;Piwhane&quot; and &quot;Kapowairua&quot;, the latter meaning to &quot;catch the spirit&quot;, derived from a Māori language saying that translates into English as: &quot;I can shelter from the wind. But I cannot shelter from the longing for my daughter. I shall venture as far as Hokianga, and beyond. Your task (should I die) shall be to grasp my spirit.&quot; The words were spoken by Tōhē, a chief of the Ngāti Kahu people, who is considered one of Muriwhenua’s most important ancestors. Tōhē made his way south, naming more than one hundred places along the western coast, until dying at Whāngaiariki near Maunganui Bluff.

== Nature and wildlife ==
A variety of birds inhabit the bay area such as paradise ducks, New Zealand dotterel, oystercatchers, and Caspian terns. Mosquitos are very numerous. Plant life at the beach includes paraha vine.

In September 2010, it was reported that more than eighty pilot whales were beached over five kilometers at Spirits Bay. About forty of these were believed to have died, including some that drowned and others that were euthanized because of injuries from rocks. The rest of the whales were relocated to Rarawa Beach because the weather and sea conditions at Spirits Bay meant refloating the whales there was not possible. Most of the pilot whales that were refloated at Rarawa Beach survived. It was considered to be the largest whale transport ever attempted. This mass whale stranding occurred a month after a pod of fifty-eight pilot whales became stranded at Karikari Beach.

<doc id="1237078" wikidata="Q2511068" url="?curid=1237078" title="Adhesive label">
<text>An adhesive label or sticky label is a small piece of paper designed to be affixed to any surface, typically by the action of removing a layer of adhesive on the front or back of the label. The term adhesive refers to a sticky substance, while something that is self-adhesive implies that it will stick without wetting or the application of glue to the product.

One of the most familiar types of adhesive labels is the postage stamp, which was developed in Britain in the 1840s and became popular in the United States within the same decade. However, it was not until 1935, when R. Stanton Avery invented the machine to manufacture self-adhesive labels. Over time Avery&#x27;s invention stimulated the development of eighteen original patents and revolutionized the way that manufacturers and brands advertised information on their products.

The machines Avery pioneered used a die-cutting process, allowing the paper to be cut into a repeated, specific shape, usually a rectangle or a square. In the 1960s, further innovations, increasing demand, and new kinds of adhesives were produced, and self-adhesive labels began to be manufactured on a large scale to a worldwide market. In the 1970s self-adhesive labels and stickers became mainstream products and were popularized in the form of car decals, bumper stickers, and collectable items.
There are three main classifications for label adhesives including: permanent, removable, and repositionable. Each variation has its own unique qualities and uses. The bond strength of each type of adhesive ranges from a strong bond which is permanent, to a flexible bond, which can be repositioned or removed entirely.

The growth, diversity, and popularity of self-adhesive labels have continued into the present day. Advancements in technology and demand for versatile products has led to more innovative materials being used to create more dynamic bonds which are specific to the environment they will be used in. Similarly, there are now a wide variety of materials that are used to create the face material, or front, of the labels. These products include polypropylene, polyester, vinyl, and mrPVC. Adhesive labels may now be produced individually, or in sheets, which case they are usually separated by perforations or rouletting, see postage stamp separation. Digital printing technology is also being used to improve this process. This innovative printing allows for customizable, print-on-demand products and has the capacity to lower costs for manufacturers worldwide. A recent article suggests that an increased consumer awareness paired with developments in technology will result in a strong future for adhesive labels.

The concept has since been extended into a variety of areas:

* On mail:airmail etiquettes, charity labels, address labels, return address labels, postage meter labels, certain types of postal labels
* On other kinds of paper objects:revenue stamps, savings stamps, general markers, notices, or warnings
* Retail products: decorations, stickers, barcodes, price labels, car decals, bumper stickers, and collectible items
* Industrial appliances: direction labels, warning labels
* On food: Nutritional information, allergy warnings, expiration dates
* On medical devices: prescription drug bottles, warning labels, brand information

Almost every imaginable combination of paper products and adhesives have been used at some point to create adhesive labels; see postage stamp paper and postage stamp gum for a more detailed discussion. See postage stamp separation.

<doc id="1237088" wikidata="Q17055230" url="?curid=1237088" title="1963 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1963 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 34th term. The results were almost identical to those of the previous election, and the governing National Party remained in office.

==Background==
The 1960 election had been won by the National Party, beginning New Zealand&#x27;s second period of National government. Keith Holyoake, who had briefly been prime minister at the end of the first period, returned to office. The elderly leader of the Labour Party, Walter Nash, had agreed to step down following his government&#x27;s defeat, but disliked the prospect of being succeeded by his Minister of Finance, Arnold Nordmeyer. Nash instead backed first Jerry Skinner and then, after Skinner&#x27;s death, Fred Hackett. In the end, however, Nordmeyer was victorious. Nordmeyer, however, was unpopular with the general public, being remembered with hostility for the tax hikes in his so-called &#x27;Black Budget&#x27;. Labour struggled to overcome this negative perception of its leader, and was only partially successful.

There had been an unusually large number of by-elections during the term of the 33rd Parliament. None of these had resulted in any upsets, and there was no major indications from the population wanting a change. National held two seats Hurunui and Waitaki, but by reduced margins. The party organisation was also acutely aware that National&#x27;s win in 1960 was mostly due to public mood against Labour, rather than endorsement of National, and put work in to improving their campaigning. Benefits were seen sooner than expected picking up swings (but not winning) against Labour in two by-elections in the two Labour held seats of Buller and Northern Maori.

Holyoake started his election campaign on 4 November, not even a month out from the election. Whilst television had just been introduced in New Zealand, the election campaign was a dull affair and, from 23 November, the Assassination of John F. Kennedy was the dominant topic in the media.

===MPs retiring in 1963===
Five National MPs and two Labour MPs intended to retire at the end of the 33rd Parliament.

==The election==
The date for the main 1963 elections was 30 November. 1,345,836 people were registered to vote, and turnout was 89.6%. This turnout was around average for the time. The number of seats being contested was 80, a number which had been fixed since 1902.

The following new (or reconstituted) electorates were introduced in 1963: Manurewa, New Lynn, Pakuranga, Porirua, Rangiora, Taupo and Waimarino.

==Results==
The 1963 election saw the governing National Party retain office by a ten-seat margin. It had previously held office by a twelve-seat margin. National won a total of forty-five seats, while the Labour Party won thirty-five. In the popular vote, National won 47.1% to Labour&#x27;s 43.7%. The Social Credit Party won 7.9% of the vote, but no seats, although their leader Vernon Cracknell came close to winning Hobson, but ultimately lost due to special votes. Four of their candidates also missed the nomination deadline. One political analyst, Professor Robert Chapman, called it &quot;the no change election&quot;.

Puti Tipene Watene was elected for Eastern Maori; he was a Mormon and was the first non-Ratana to win a Maori seat since 1938.

<doc id="1237090" wikidata="Q773950" url="?curid=1237090" title="Aupōuri Peninsula">
<text>The Aupōuri Peninsula is a tombolo at the northern tip of the North Island of New Zealand. It projects between the Tasman Sea to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east. It constitutes the northern part of the Far North District, incorporating North Cape, Houhora and the northern half of Awanui.

== History ==

The peninsula was an important location for the kauri gum digging trade, which peaked between 1890 and 1935. High quality kauri gum was found around the Parengarenga Harbour in the north, which led to the development of the Parenga Gumfield Company. After 1910, gum digging intensified in the southern half of the peninsula, as the poorer grade gum found in this region greatly increased in value.

== Overview ==

It is a peninsula on a peninsula, being part of the massive Northland Peninsula (also called the North Auckland Peninsula) which makes up nearly one twelfth of New Zealand&#x27;s land area. Close to the northern town of Kaitaia, the Northland Peninsula suddenly narrows from a width of 60 kilometres to a mere 10 kilometres, a width which it maintains approximately for the last 100 kilometres of its thrust to the north.

At the base of the peninsula to the east is the natural inlet of the Rangaunu Harbour. Beyond this lies the Karikari Peninsula and the broad sweep of Doubtless Bay. The east coast of the peninsula is dominated by Rangaunu Bay in the south and Great Exhibition Bay in the north. Towards its northern tip is the natural inlet of Parengarenga Harbour, beyond which lies North Cape. Spirits Bay and Tom Bowling Bay are located on northernmost of the land.

The peninsula&#x27;s best-known feature is on the other coast: almost the entire west coast is the 88-kilometre long Ninety Mile Beach.

At its northern end, the peninsula widens to 30 kilometres. Here there are several capes that appear to be the northernmost point of New Zealand&#x27;s main islands: Cape Maria van Diemen, North Cape, Cape Reinga, and the Surville Cliffs, which is the actual northernmost point by a few hundred metres, at latitude 34° 23&#x27; 47&quot; South. Only a handful of islands in the Three Kings and Kermadec chains lie further north in New Zealand.

Although there are a number of settlements with over 100 people, including Te Hapua, Te Kao, Pukenui and Kaimaumau, the peninsula is sparsely inhabited, with a population of approximately 3,900. For this reason, the area&#x27;s roads are largely only metalled rather than being sealed. The main road (State Highway 1) is sealed, the final section completed in April 2010. Ninety Mile Beach is a designated highway, but most rental contracts include it in &quot;prohibited roads&quot;. The nearest town to the capes at the tip of the peninsula is Kaitaia, 100 kilometres to the south.

It is named after Te Aupōuri, one of the Māori tribes that inhabits it.

==Demographics==
The two statistical areas making up the Aupōuri Peninsula cover and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. The statistical areas include Awanui to the south of the peninsula.
Aupōuri Peninsula had a population of 4,395 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 483 people (12.3%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 996 people (29.3%) since the 2013 census. There were 2,235 males, 2,151 females and 12 people of other genders in 1,587 dwellings. 2.0% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. There were 915 people (20.8%) aged under 15 years, 705 (16.0%) aged 15 to 29, 1,896 (43.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 879 (20.0%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 61.5% European (Pākehā); 60.8% Māori; 5.8% Pasifika; 1.8% Asian; 0.2% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.7% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 96.8%, Māori language by 17.7%, Samoan by 0.3% and other languages by 3.8%. No language could be spoken by 1.8% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.5%. The percentage of people born overseas was 7.4, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 33.0% Christian, 0.1% Hindu, 0.1% Islam, 12.7% Māori religious beliefs, 0.1% Buddhist, 0.3% New Age, 0.1% Jewish, and 0.5% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 45.1%, and 8.3% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 324 (9.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 2,034 (58.4%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 1,038 (29.8%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. 147 people (4.2%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,467 (42.2%) people were employed full-time, 495 (14.2%) were part-time, and 147 (4.2%) were unemployed.

== Aupōuri Aquifer ==
The Aupōuri Aquifer extends along the whole length of Te Oneroa-a-Tōhē / Ninety Mile Beach, and includes lowlying land between Waimanoni and Ahipara, covering a total land area of 75,322 hectares. Groundwater levels are monitored and water allocation limits are set by Northland Regional Council. Resource consents for water takes include conditions for monitoring bores to observe water levels and any saltwater intrusion. 

There are a number of small lakes in the Aupōuri Peninsula, such as Lake Waiparera, Lake Heather, Lake Ngatu, and Lake Rotoroa. There is a possibility to use these as &quot;window lakes&quot; presenting an extension of the groundwater table (&quot;window lakes&quot; would be affected by groundwater pumping due to the direct hydraulically connection with the aquifer), there is however, little data available on which to base a conclusion.

Use of the aquifer for the avocado industry has caused concerns for the public regarding water security for local communities, and the potential environmental impact on the nearby Kaimaumau wetland.

<text>Closer (1997) is a dramatic play by British playwright Patrick Marber. It premiered at the Royal National Theatre&#x27;s Cottesloe Theatre in London in 1997 and made its North American debut at the Music Box Theatre on Broadway on 25 January 1999.

It was adapted by Marber for the 2004 film of the same name, produced and directed by Mike Nichols.

==Background==
&quot;Closer&quot; was first performed at the Royal National Theatre in London on 22 May 1997; it was the second original play written by Patrick Marber.

==Plot==
A young man, Dan, takes a young woman to hospital after she has been hit by a taxi; they flirt while waiting for the doctor to attend to her bloodied knee. Dermatologist Larry inspects her leg briefly and leaves. Dan and the young woman introduce themselves—he is Daniel Woolf, an obituary writer and failed novelist who mentions how he and his colleagues use euphemisms humorously in their work in obituaries. At the young woman&#x27;s prompting, he says that his euphemism would be &quot;reserved&quot; and hers would be &quot;disarming&quot;. She is Alice Ayres, a self-described waif who has a scar along her leg shaped like a question mark. Wanting him to spend the rest of the day with her, she calls in sick to his office for him.

More than a year later, Dan is on the verge of publishing a book based on Alice&#x27;s past as a stripper, and Anna is taking his photograph for publicity. Dan is infatuated with Anna, despite being in a relationship with Alice, for whom he left his former girlfriend. He begs Anna to see him again, and she rejects him. Alice overhears this conversation. She asks Anna to take her photo, and after Dan leaves, confronts her. Anna insists that she is &quot;not a thief&quot; and snaps a photo of a tear-stricken Alice.

Six months later, Dan and Larry meet in an adult chat room. Dan impersonates Anna and has Internet sex with Larry. He tries to play a practical joke on Larry by arranging for Larry to meet him (Dan pretending to be Anna in the chat room) in the London Aquarium the next day. When Larry arrives, stunned to see Anna (who Dan did not know would be there), he acts believing that she is the same person from the chat and makes a fool of himself. Anna catches on and says that Dan was probably playing a practical joke on him. She reveals that it is her birthday and snaps a photo of Larry.

At Anna&#x27;s exhibition of photos, Alice stands in front of the photo of her, looking at it; Dan is watching her. They have an argument over Alice&#x27;s feeling that Dan will leave her. Larry meets Alice, whom he recognises as the woman in the photo, and knows that she is Dan&#x27;s girlfriend. Meanwhile, Dan convinces Anna to carry on an affair with him. They cheat on their partners with each other, even through Anna and Larry&#x27;s marriage. A year later, they tell their partners the truth and leave to be with each other.

Alice, devastated, disappears from Dan&#x27;s life. She returns to stripping, using the name Jane. Larry finds her at a seedy strip club in London, where he pushes her to tell the truth about her name. He asks, &quot;Tell me something true, Alice.&quot; She says, &quot;Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off— but it&#x27;s better if you do.&quot; They share a connection based on mutual betrayal and heartbreak. He asks her to meet him later for sex. She declines.

A month after this, Anna is late meeting Dan for dinner. She is coming from asking Larry to sign the divorce papers. Dan finds out that Larry had demanded Anna have sex with him before he would sign the papers. Dan becomes upset and jealous, asking Anna why she did not lie to him. They have a candid, truthful conversation. Anna reveals that she did have sex with Larry and he did sign the papers.

Alice meanwhile has been having sex with Larry. On his birthday, she summons him to the museum and sets up Anna to meet him there. Larry and Anna exchange words, as Anna discovers Alice and Larry have been having a casual relationship. Larry asks Anna if their divorce will ever become finalised; he leaves when Alice emerges. The two women share an exchange in which their mutual animosity is revealed. Anna calls Alice &quot;primitive&quot;, a description Alice accepts. The younger Alice describes Larry&#x27;s emotional state as troubled and learns from Anna that Dan still calls out for &quot;Buster&quot; (Alice&#x27;s nickname) in his sleep.

Anna goes back to Larry. Distraught, Dan confronts Larry at his office and has to reconcile himself to the loss of Anna. Larry recommends that Dan return to Alice and reveals that he had seen her in the strip club. He lies for Alice at first and tells Dan that they did not have sex, since Alice feared that, if Dan found out, he would not want her any more. At the end, Larry decides to hurt Dan and reveals the truth—that they had sex.

Dan and Alice, back together, prepare to go to the United States. They relive the memories of their first meeting, but Dan is haunted by their encounters with Larry and Anna and pushes Alice to tell him the truth. In the moment when Alice becomes caught between refusing to tell the truth and being unable to lie to him, she says, &quot;I don&#x27;t love you anymore. Goodbye.&quot; (She had told Dan in the beginning that these are the words she tells her significant others when their relationship is over and she is going to leave.) She tells Dan to leave. He struggles with her; she spits in his face, and he throws her back on the bed, grabbing her neck. She dares him to hit her, and he does; she leaves.

Later, Anna and Larry meet again, only to reveal that they have broken up once again and Larry is dating Polly, a young nurse. They are meeting because Alice has died the night before in New York, having been hit by a car while crossing the street. Their conversation also reveals that &quot;Alice&quot; was always a pseudonym—her real name was actually Jane. Larry leaves as Dan arrives because he has patients to see. Dan talks with Anna and says that no one could identify Alice&#x27;s body and he is flying over to the United States to do so. Before Dan leaves, he tells Anna that Ruth, his ex-girlfriend whom he left for Alice/Jane, is now married, has a child, and is pregnant with a second. She married a poet, having fallen in love with him (without ever having met him) after reading his book of poems, &quot;Solitude&quot;. Dan and Anna bid each other goodbye. Dan leaves to catch his flight, leaving Anna alone.

==Genre==
&quot;Closer&quot; is written in the style of a drama, characteristically blending elements of classical tragedy, classical comedy, and melodrama. Conflicts occur between people, in the style of a melodrama. But the way the plot progresses is comedic, in that several romances are pursued. Dan plays a massive comedic trick on Larry, which results in another romance emerging. There are moments of &quot;cognito&quot;, where Alice realises that she does not love Dan any more and Dan realises he loves Alice—and the final moment of revelation occurs when Alice&#x27;s true identity is unveiled. But these elements blend with melodramatic plot twists—the four characters switch partners frequently, and their emotional statuses constantly fluctuate between high and low, in a series of reversals that build toward increasing tension.

==Staging==
The play is set in a few small places—a hospital room, a studio, a pair of living rooms, a café, a room in the museum, in front of a photo at a showing, a doctor&#x27;s office, a bench in front of a suggested aquarium. The text of the play insists on all settings being &quot;minimal&quot;. The lack of physical detail is meant to balance the verbal excess. Places are evoked, not shown—benches instead of the front of a museum; a large photo instead of the entire exhibit.

According to Robert Brustein, in the original production, &quot;Memorial blocks constitute the backdrop of the set—a design that gradually accumulates all the scenic pieces used in the play, as if these four lives were a detritus of props and furniture.&quot; The setting is formed to be deliberately symbolic.

==Themes==
The central theme of &quot;Closer&quot; revolves around truth. All the characters have a tense relationship with truth—only Alice is &quot;not passionate about veracity&quot;. Truth, for Dan, is what distinguishes humans from animals—and yet Alice accepts her identity as not quite human for any of the other characters, and loves her primitivism. Arguably, her inability to deal with the truth causes her to leave Dan at the end. Those who are passionate about veracity press each other to tell the complete truth, no matter the emotional pain caused by it—and the controlling irony of the situation is that though the truth clarifies, it does not bring together. No one is made &quot;closer&quot; by the truth.

Also being challenged and taken apart is the illusion of love and romance. Dan, the failed writer, speaks in romantic language but feels the least qualms about his infidelities. The characters are driven both by a need for love and a need for sex—these needs clash at times, as when Larry tells Dan that Alice needed love, and Dan had left her for a relationship with Anna. The mythic constructions surrounding personal relationships—the myth of love and truth bringing us together—is deliberately and willfully turned on its head by Marber.

&quot;Closer&quot; has been described as a work that &quot;gets under its audience&#x27;s skin, and ... not for the emotionally squeamish&quot;, a work in which &quot;Marber is alert to the cruel inequalities of love, as the characters change partners in what sometimes comes over like a modern reworking of Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot;.&quot;

==Language==
Marber uses direct, emotionally brutal and sexually explicit language. In scene three, when Dan and Larry are instant messaging on an adult website, Marber uses crude and up-to-date terminology and dialogue typical of such a communication.

In a review of the Broadway run in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, John Simon writes,
&quot;Marber tells his story in short, staccato scenes in which the unsaid talks as loudly as the said. The dialogue is almost entirely stichomythic, the occasional speech still not much longer than a few lines. There are frequent pauses, but not of the Pinteresque variety—more like skipped heartbeats... &quot;Closer&quot; does not merely hold your attention; it burrows into you.&quot;According to Matt Wolf, &quot;the animalistic pulse of the play [is] reflected in its often scabrous language&quot;.

==Music==
Although no music is indicated in Marber&#x27;s script, different productions have often most commonly used classical music. This was also the case in the 2004 film version of &quot;Closer&quot;. In one production, the music in &quot;Closer&quot; was composed by Paddy Cunneen, a score described as sounding like &quot;modern Bach&quot;.

==References in popular culture==
The band Panic! at the Disco split a line from the play into two song titles on their 2005 album &quot;A Fever You Can&#x27;t Sweat Out&quot;: &quot;Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off&quot; and &quot;But It&#x27;s Better If You Do&quot;.

Larry&#x27;s line to Dan, &quot;Have you ever seen a human heart? It looks like a fist wrapped in blood&quot;, is used by Canadian post-hardcore band Silverstein as a title to the song &quot;Fist Wrapped in Blood&quot; on their 2005 album &quot;Discovering the Waterfront&quot;. The line was also sampled in the Killwhitneydead song &quot;Let Me Give You A Hand Throwing Yourself Out&quot;

The line Anna speaks to Larry, &quot;He tastes like you, only sweeter&quot;, is used in the 2007 Fall Out Boy song &quot;Thnks fr th Mmrs&quot;. Also, the line spoken by Larry to Alice/Jane in the strip club, &quot;I love everything about you that hurts&quot;, is used in the Fall Out Boy song &quot;G.I.N.A.S.F.S.&quot;.

Dan and Alice&#x27;s conversation where Alice tells Dan that she doesn&#x27;t love him anymore is used by the American depressive black metal band Happy Days in the song &quot;Abigail&quot;.

<doc id="1237100" wikidata="Q1090811" url="?curid=1237100" title="Hearts of Fire">
<text>Hearts of Fire is a 1987 American musical drama film starring Bob Dylan, Fiona and Rupert Everett. The film was essentially a vehicle for Dylan based on his success as a rock musician. It received poor reviews, a limited theatrical release, and was later written off by Dylan himself.

==Cast==
* Fiona as Molly McGuire
* Bob Dylan as Billy Parker
* Rupert Everett as James Colt
* Richie Havens as Pepper Ward
* Julian Glover as Alfred
* Suzanne Bertish as Anne Ashton
* Larry Lamb as Jack Rosner
* Maury Chaykin as Charlie Kelso
* Lesleh Donaldson as Penny
* Jeremy Ratchford as Jim &quot;Jimbo&quot;
* Mark Rylance as &quot;Fizz&quot;
* Ian Dury as &quot;Bones&quot;
* Tony Rosato as Woody

==Origin and filming==
Originally written by Scott Richardson, the screenplay was rewritten by future &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; writer Joe Eszterhas because Lorimar Productions felt that Richardson was a &quot;baby writer&quot; and not experienced enough to take on the responsibility of a starring vehicle for a rock icon of Dylan&#x27;s stature. &quot;Hearts of Fire&quot; is also regarded as the film that &quot;killed Richard Marquand&quot;, director of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, who would die of a stroke later the same year.

The film was shot in Canada (Hamilton and Toronto) at the defunct Davenport Works of the Canadian General Electric Company and the United Kingdom (Southerndown and Coney Beach at Porthcawl). Cardiff Airport also substituted for Heathrow. The film&#x27;s concert scenes were shot at the Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario, Colston Hall in Bristol, and Camden, North London.

==Release==
&quot;Hearts of Fire&quot; did poorly in theaters. It was first released in the UK on October 9, 1987 at the Odeon Marble Arch and Odeon cinemas in Brighton, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Manchester during a Dylan tour of the UK. It was pulled from the cinemas after approximately two weeks. As a result, the film was released to a very few theaters in the United States for one week only. All plans to set to release the film nationwide, which was planned for release by Lorimar Motion Pictures, but the film was set to limbo, citing the negative reviews of the feature film.

===Home media===
In the United States, the film was released directly to video by Warner Home Video in 1990 after a very short theatrical run. The film was re-released on VHS by Warner Brothers on December 6, 1993.

The film was released digitally for purchase through iTunes and Vudu.

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; lamented that it was &quot;unfortunate that the last film of helmer Richard Marquand, who died shortly after completing it, should be &quot;Hearts of Fire&quot;&quot; and that the film failed &quot;to fire on all cylinders despite a nimble performance by the enigmatic Bob Dylan typecast as a reclusive rock star.&quot; Channel 4 deemed the film a &quot;blunt instrument of 80s vacuity.&quot; DVDLaser stated that it is &quot;a really bad movie,&quot; but also that the viewer&#x27;s opinion of Bob Dylan is &quot;the key to liking or disliking the film.&quot;

&quot;Time Out London&quot; said that Dylan &quot;hovers enigmatically on the sidelines, offering jaundiced comments.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
In 1987, Columbia Records released the soundtrack to the film. Dylan was apparently originally contracted to write and contribute four new original recordings to the album but only turned in two original songs and one cover song. The tracks included a cover of John Hiatt&#x27;s &quot;The Usual&quot;, along with the Dylan originals &quot;Night After Night&quot; and &quot;Had a Dream About You Baby&quot;. Dylan later released an alternate version of &quot;Had a Dream About You Baby&quot; on the 1988 album &quot;Down in the Groove&quot;.

<text>Peter Hamilton Raven (born June 13, 1936) is an American botanist and environmentalist, notable as the longtime director, now President Emeritus, of the Missouri Botanical Garden.

== Early life ==
On June 13, 1936, Raven was born in Shanghai, China, to American parents, Walter Francis Raven and Isabelle Marion Breen. His father&#x27;s uncle Frank Jay Raven was, for a time, one of the wealthiest Americans in China but was later jailed in a banking scandal. That incident and Japanese aggression in China led the Raven family to return to San Francisco, California, in the late 1930s.

After becoming a member of the California Academy of Sciences while still a youth, Raven went on to graduate with a BSc in biology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1957 and a Ph.D. in botany from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1960.

== Career ==
After teaching at Stanford University, Raven went on to become Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden in 1971. In 2006, his position was renamed President and Director. Raven announced his plans to retire in 2011, to coincide with his 75th birthday and his 40th year at the garden. Peter Wyse Jackson was appointed as Raven&#x27;s successor at the Missouri Botanical Garden in September 2010.

Raven is possibly best known for his work &quot;Butterflies and Plants: A Study in Coevolution&quot;, published in the journal &quot;Evolution&quot; in 1964, which he coauthored with Paul R. Ehrlich. Since then he has authored numerous scientific and popular papers, many on the evening primrose family, Onagraceae. Raven is also an author of the widely used textbook &quot;Biology of Plants&quot;, now in its eighth edition, coauthored with Ray F. Evert and Susan E. Eichhorn (both of University of Wisconsin, Madison).

He is a frequent speaker on the need for biodiversity and species conservation.

In 2000, the American Society of Plant Taxonomists established the Peter Raven Award in his honor to be conferred to authors with outstanding contributions to plant taxonomy and &quot;for exceptional efforts at outreach to non-scientists&quot;.

He serves on the advisory council of CRDF Global. He served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1993 to 1996.

== Research ==

Raven has published more than 700 articles, books, and monographs covering topics in Evolution, Taxonomy and Systematics, Biogeography, Coevolution, Plant Conservation, Ethnobotany, and Public Policy, including several text books.

During his early years he was associated with and led Sierra Club outings for several weeks at a time, after which he published &quot;Base Camp Reports.&quot; Published from 1950 to 1956, these reports covered a wide range of subjects, including plant lists, insects, and ecology. His first such report, at the age of 14, summarized 506 plant collections representing 337 species collected in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Inyo and Fresno Counties. G. Ledyard Stebbins was a counselor on this particular trip, identified by Raven as Prof. G. L. &quot;Led&quot; Stebbins.

During this time he also published on new weed species and other plants found in and around San Francisco as well as the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

In 1950 Raven, at the age of 14, had collected a plant called &quot;C. rubicunda&quot;. In the early 1950s, in the course of revising the genus &quot;Clarkia&quot; Harlan Lewis and his wife Margaret Lewis discovered the herbarium specimen collected by Raven. They visited him in 1952 when he was 16, and wanted to know where the collection was made. Lewis eventually located the new species, and in 1958 Lewis and Raven published a botanical description of this plant, called &quot;C. franciscana&quot;, which was morphologically very closely related to &quot;C. rubicunda&quot; and &quot;C. amoena&quot;.

=== Evolution ===

While a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles, Raven and Harlan Lewis published a major paper in 1958 on the evolution of &quot;C. franciscana&quot;, and generalized to what was by then a general a pattern of speciation in &quot;Clarkia&quot;. They concluded that &quot;C. franciscana&quot; had evolved from &quot;Clarkia rubicunda&quot;; and they asserted that &quot;C. franciscana&#x27;s&quot; origin mirrored a recurring theme in &quot;Clarkia&quot; of a derived species showing a close morphological similarity to a parental species, the derived species being geographically proximal, but differing from the parent by chromosomal differences and showing interspecific sterility. Further, they hypothesized that such speciation in &quot;Clarkia&quot; was rapid, and perhaps occurred within the last 12,000 years.

Additionally, they hypothesized that this rapid mode of speciation seen in &quot;Clarkia&quot; was analogous to a mode of speciation known as quantum evolution.

Following his early publication in 1958 on evolution of &quot;C. franciscana&quot;, Raven went on to publish many papers on evolutionary topics. While at Stanford University, with Paul R. Ehrlich, he coined the term coevolution after a 1964 review of butterflies and their food plants.

In a 1969 paper Ehrlich and Raven were also critical of the idea that the definition of species as advocated by Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and G. Ledyard Stebbins had very little meaning for plants.

In 1978 Sussman and Raven advanced the idea that nonflying mammals, such as primates and marsupials, could have been significant pollinators but were outcompeted by nectar-feeding birds and bats. Any coevolved relationships between flowering plant species and non-flying mammal pollinators that persist at the present would appear to be &quot;living fossils, which have a great deal to tell us about the evolution of both the mammals, including some of our antecedents, and of the flowering plants.&quot;

Raven wrote a review of the plant population data as of 1979, and identified several themes that he felt had potential for future research, including the above theme of the species problem. He went on to assert that developmental biology would be more important in the future He advocated another theme, that being that funding should be provided for study on a few species rather than spread amongst many in order to solve population biology problems:

In 1980 Raven continued discussing problems associated with defining species in plants. He discussed the widespread ability of plant species to hybridize, especially in perennial plants, and the historical observations of such back to 1717. He used as examples of perennial plants in the genera Epilobium, Scaevola, Bidens, and Ceanothus as examples of plants that appeared to use hybridization as a means to adapting to new environments. He stated &quot;If the hybrids are particularly favored in specific ecological situations, asexual reproduction, polyploidy, or simply autogamy may favor the perpetuation of specific genotypes through a narrowing of the spectrum of genetic recombination characteristic of the population. No general conclusions about the most appropriate way to treat these populations taxonomically appear to be possible.&quot; In annual plants, using examples from Clarkia, he asserted that several species of &quot;Clarkia&quot; often occur sympatrically, yet hybrids are very rare in the wild,&quot; and that much of the sterility is due to chromosomal repatterning between species.&quot;

In 1980 Raven and coauthors reviewed the literature concerning fungal symbiosis in vascular plants. They reviewed two kinds of fungal-plant associations: ectomycorrhizal and endomycorrhizal. They reported that endomycorrhizal fungi, which penetrate plant cells, are found in 80% of all vascular plants, including ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, and are found in forests of high species richness. On the other hand, ectomycorrhizal fungi, which do not penetrate plant cells, occur in forests of low species richness, are usually in temperate forests, or infertile soils of the tropics. Further, they hypothesized that ectomycorrhizal forests have expanded through the Middle Cretaceous at the expense of endomycorrhizal forests.

Raven&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis was on a genus within the Onagraceae, and his interest on the evolution of plants within this family as well as the Myrtales runs through his entire career. In 1988 he published a review of the Onagraceae, covering its taxonomy, evolution, cytogenetics, anatomy, breeding systems, and geographic distribution. He asserted that the family was the best known plant family of its size, and proposed that further studies of the family would be useful in understanding of &quot;variation and evolution of plants in the future.&quot;

=== Biogeography ===

Raven showed an early interest in plant disjunctions prior to the wide acceptance of plate tectonic theory of the late 1960s, and was an early adopter of plate tectonics in explaining plant disjunctions by the early 1970s.

In 1963 Raven published a review of amphitropical distributions of plant species in North and South America. He divided species into three groups: biopolar or high-latitude species, temperate species, and desert species.

In 1974, with Daniel I. Axelrod, Raven published an extensive article on plant and animal biogeography in the context of plate tectonics. They stated that the new plate tectonic theory &quot;did not require any new modifications of previously established major principles of evolution...however there were new principles of biogeography...&quot;

In 1978, again with Axelrod, they published on the origin and complexity of Californian flora. They reviewed that the flora of California consisted of &quot;northern, temperate elements and xeric, southern elements, and is characterized by a high degree of endemism.&quot; They proposed that the reasons for the large number of species in the state as well as the endemics is due to the favorable climate that has prevailed in California for most of the Tertiary, as well as the recent elevation of the Sierra Nevada and other ranges, together with: &quot;The concomitant development of a cold off-shore current which ultimately resulted in the development of a mediterranean, summer-dry climate during the past million years...The endemics of California are a mixture of relicts and newly produced species...and it is the latter that have contributed most to the size of the flora and to the high proportion of endemism in it.&quot;

Raven and Axelrod wrote a paper in 1985 on the origin of the Cordilleran flora, a region bounded by the east slope of the Sierra Nevada and Transverse Ranges and Peninsular Ranges of California to the eastern front of the Rocky Mountains, north to the Snake River Plain-western Wyoming, and south to central Arizona-New Mexico.

In 1996 Raven, Axelrod, and Al-Shehbaz wrote a paper on the history of the modern flora of China, Europe, and the continental United States. They said that the three regions have approximately the same geographic area, yet China has two times the number of species as the United States, and three times as many as Europe. They asserted that all three regions had essentially the same flora as of 15 million years ago, but China came to possess the most species because of three reasons. First, China has a tropical rain forest. Second, there is an unbroken gradient of vegetation from the tropical rain forest to &quot;boreal coniferous forests that has persisted and afforded habitats characterized by equable climates during the last 15 million years, when massive extinctions were taking place elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere...such continuity is interrupted in North America by the Gulf of Mexico and in Europe by the Alps, the Mediterranean, and the Sahara Desert.&quot; The third reason was due to the impact of the Indian subcontinent with Asia starting 50 million years ago, making a &quot;highly dissected, elevated geography.&quot;

=== Taxonomy/Systematics/Floras ===

Raven has produced a wide variety of works in the area of plant systematics. Most of them are related to the plant family Onagraceae. In 1969 he published a 235-page report on Camissonia; In 1976 he, along with his wife at the time Tamara Engelhorn, published a 321-page monograph on Epilobium in Australasia; an embryological analysis of species in the Myrtales; In 1992 a 209-page monograph on the systematics of Epilobium in China; in 1997 a 234-page monograph on the systematics of Oenothera; and in 2007 a 240-page monograph on a reclassification of the Onagraceae. And in 1981 he published a 1,049 page monograph on the systematics of Legumes.

He has also published a number of books (Floras) devoted to the systematics of plants found in particular regions. These include a 1966 book on the native shrubs of Southern California; a 1966 flora on the Santa Monica Mountains in California; and, with various editors and authors, an ongoing 33 volume set (to date) on the flora of China, organized by plant family.

=== Ethnobotany ===

Raven (along with Dennis E. Breedlove) was a collaborator on a team led by Brent Berlin that published a seminal work on the classification of plants by the Tzeltal Mayan-speaking people of Highland Chiapas. They concluded that plant, as well as animal, descriptions could be grouped into five different hierarchical &quot;taxonomic ethnobiological categories&quot;; these included 1.) &quot;unique beginner,&quot; such as plants and animals, 2.) &quot;life form&quot;, such as tree, vine, bird, grass, mammal, etc.; 3.) the largest category, consisting usually of ~500 taxa, is &quot;generic&quot;, and consists of names such as oak, pine, catfish, perch, and robin. Further, some &quot;generics&quot; were not included with in the classification of &quot;life forms&quot;, and were called &quot;aberrant&quot;. These included names such as cactus, bamboo, pineapple, platypus, etc., and were often of economic value—Agave, bean, and corn as examples. Two other taxa were called &quot;specific&quot; and &quot;varietal,&quot; and were generally less numerous. Examples of &quot;specific&quot; include blue spruce, white fir, and post oak, and examples of &quot;varietal&quot; included baby beans, button beans, etc.

Berlin, Breedlove and Raven later extended their analysis of plants and animals to other indigenous peoples including the Hanunoo speaking people of the island of Mindoro, Philippines; the Karam of Papua New Guinea; the Cantonese speaking boat people of Castle Peak Bay, Hong Kong; the Navajo of the Southwestern United States; the Fore people of Papua New Guinea; the Guaraní people of South America; and the Nahuatl speaking people of Mexico, and concluded that their five to six taxonomic ethnobiological categories were generalizable.

== Personal life ==

From 1996 to 2000, Raven was married to Kathryn Fish, who served as the director of public policy for Monsanto. The couple met while both were serving on an environmental advisory committee for Monsanto.

<text>Edmund Sears Morgan (January 17, 1916 – July 8, 2013) was an American historian and an authority on early American history. He was the Sterling Professor of History at Yale University, where he taught from 1955 to 1986. He specialized in American colonial history, with some attention to English history. Thomas S. Kidd says he was noted for his incisive writing style, &quot;simply one of the best academic prose stylists America has ever produced.&quot; He covered many topics, including Puritanism, political ideas, the American Revolution, slavery, historiography, family life, and numerous notables such as Benjamin Franklin.

==Early life and education==
Morgan was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the second child of Edmund Morris Morgan and Elsie Smith Morgan. His mother was from a Yankee family that practiced Christian Science, though she distanced herself from that faith. His father, descended from Welsh coal miners, taught law at the University of Minnesota. His sister was Roberta Mary Morgan (later Wohlstetter), also a historian and, like Edmund, a winner of the Bancroft Prize. 

In 1925, the family moved from Washington, D.C., to Arlington, Massachusetts, when their father was appointed a professor at Harvard Law School.

Morgan attended Belmont Hill School in Belmont, Massachusetts, and then enrolled at Harvard College, where he initially intended to study English history and literature. But after taking a course in American literature with F. O. Matthiessen, he switched to the new major of American civilization (history and literature), with Perry Miller as his tutor. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Harvard in 1937. Then, at the urging of the jurist and family friend Felix Frankfurter, Morgan began attending lectures at the London School of Economics.

In 1942, Morgan earned his Ph.D. in the History of American Civilization from Harvard University with Miller as his adviser.

==Military service==
Although a pacifist, Morgan became convinced after the fall of France in June 1940 that only military force could stop Hitler, and he withdrew his application for conscientious objector status. During World War II, he trained as a machinist at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, where he turned out parts for radar installations.

==Personal life and death==
In 1939, he married Helen Theresa Mayer, who died in 1982.

Morgan died in New Haven, Connecticut on July 8, 2013, at the age of 97. His cause of death was pneumonia. He was survived by two daughters—Penelope Aubin and Pamela Packard—from his first marriage; his second wife, Marie (née Carpenter) Caskey Morgan, a historian; six grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.

==Career==
In 1946–55, Morgan taught history at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island before becoming a professor at Yale University, where he directed some 60 PhD dissertations in colonial history before retiring in 1986.

As an undergraduate at Harvard, Morgan was profoundly influenced by historian Perry Miller, who became a lifelong friend. Although both were atheists, they had a deep understanding and respect for Puritan religion. From Miller, Morgan learned to appreciate:

The intellectual rigor and elegance of a system of ideas that made sense of human life in a way no longer palatable to most of us. Certainly not palatable to me... He left me with a habit of taking what people have said at face value unless I find compelling reasons to discount it... What Americans said from the beginning about taxation and just government deserved to be taken as seriously as the Puritans&#x27; ideas about God and man.

Morgan&#x27;s many books and articles covered a range of topics in the history of the colonial and Revolutionary periods, using intellectual, social history, biographical, and political history approaches. Two of his early books, &quot;The Birth of the Republic&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Puritan Dilemma&quot; (1958), have for decades been required reading in many undergraduate history courses. His works include &quot;American Slavery, American Freedom&quot; (1975), which won the Society of American Historians&#x27; Francis Parkman Prize, the Southern Historical Association&#x27;s Charles S. Sydnor Prize and the American Historical Association&#x27;s Albert J. Beveridge Award, and &quot;Inventing the People: The Rise of Popular Sovereignty in England and America&quot; (1988), which won Columbia University&#x27;s Bancroft Prize in American History in 1989. Morgan has written a biography of Benjamin Franklin of which he made extensive use of &quot;The Papers of Benjamin Franklin&quot; and has written about at length. He has also written biographies on Ezra Stiles and Roger Williams.

===Puritans===
Morgan&#x27;s trio &quot;The Puritan Family: Religion and Domestic Relations in 17th-Century New England&quot; (1944), &quot;The Puritan Dilemma&quot; (1958), and &quot;Visible Saints: The History of a Puritan Idea&quot; (1963) restored the intellectual respectability of the Puritans, and exposed their appetite for healthy sex, causing a renaissance in Puritan studies, partly because both Morgan and his mentor Miller were Ivy League atheist professors, which added to their credibility. &quot;Visible Saints,&quot; dedicated to Miller, was a reinterpretation of the Puritan ideal of the &quot;Church of the Elect.&quot; 
Morgan argued that the criterion for church membership was not fixed in England. Soon after their arrival, the Puritans changed membership to a gathered church composed exclusively of tested Saints.

Morgan&#x27;s 1958 book &quot;The Puritan Dilemma&quot; raised his notability, and the book became the most assigned textbook in U.S. history survey courses, documenting the change in understanding among Puritans of what it means to be a member of a church. Morgan described the Puritan as &quot;doing right in a world that does wrong...Caught between the ideals of God&#x27;s Law and the practical needs of the people, John Winthrop walked a line few could tread.&quot;

===American Revolution===
In &quot;The Stamp Act Crisis&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Birth of the Republic&quot; (1956) Morgan rejected the Progressive interpretation of the American Revolution and its assumption that the rhetoric of the Patriots was mere claptrap. Instead Morgan returned to the interpretation first set out by George Bancroft a century before that the patriots were deeply motivated by a commitment to liberty. Historian Mark Egnal argues that:

The leading neo-Whig historians, Edmund Morgan and Bernard Bailyn, underscore this dedication to whiggish principles, although with variant readings. For Morgan, the development of the patriots&#x27; beliefs was a rational, clearly defined process.

===Slavery===
In his 1975 book &quot;American Slavery, American Freedom&quot;, Morgan explored &quot;the American paradox, the marriage of slavery and freedom&quot;:

Human relations among us still suffer from the former enslavement of a large portion of our predecessors. The freedom of the free, the growth of freedom experienced in the American Revolution depended more than we like to admit on the enslavement of more than 20 percent of us at that time. How republican freedom came to be supported, at least in large part, by its opposite, slavery, is the subject of this book.
Morgan claimed that large Virginia plantation owners exerted an outsized influence on poorer white Virginians and their attitude toward the racial divide (color line) which made it possible for Virginian white men as a group to become more politically equal: (&quot;Aristocrats could more safely preach equality in a slave society than in a free one&quot;).

In a controversial passage, Morgan suggests Virginia&#x27;s poor whites felt no racial superiority to poor blacks. He does this by providing evidence that, in 17th-century Virginia, poor white indentured servants and black slaves frequently cooperated with each other and worked together. Morgan cites the 1676 Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion as evidence of a surprising racial egalitarianism among the poor, since Bacon incorporated runaway black slaves into his army.

Despite the assertions of such writers as Michelle Alexander, however, Morgan does not state that Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion was the reason that rich landowners stopped purchasing white indentured servants and started increasing their purchase of black slaves; rather, regional changes in labor economics was the reason black slaves began to replace white servants: during the early 1600s, white servants cost less per unit labor than black slaves did; but by the latter 1600s, the situation reversed itself, and black slaves became the more economical investment. And, as Morgan states, &quot;The planters who bought slaves instead of servants did not do so with any apparent consciousness of the social stability to be gained thereby. Indeed, insofar as Virginians expressed themselves on the subject of slavery, they feared that it would magnify the danger of insurrection in the colony.&quot; As events evolved, however, the rising number of black slaves and the virtual end to the importation of indentured servants did stabilize Virginia society. And as time went on, according to Morgan, Virginia politicians learned to further pacify poor whites by fostering a sense of white superiority. &quot;Racism made it possible for white Virginians to develop a devotion to the equality that English republicans had declared to be the soul of liberty.&quot; That is, according to Morgan, white men in Virginia were able to become much more politically equal and cohesive than would have been possible without a population of low-status black slaves.

Anthony S. Parent commented: &quot;American historians of our generation admire Edmund Morgan&#x27;s &quot;American Slavery, American Freedom&quot; more than any other monograph. Morgan resuscitated American history by placing black slavery and white freedom as its central paradox.&quot;

In 2002 Morgan published a surprise &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller, &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;, which dispels the myth of &quot;a comfortable old gentleman staring out at the world over his half-glasses with benevolent comprehension of everything in it&quot;, revealing his true mental makeup.

With a wisdom about himself that comes only to the great of heart, Franklin knew how to value himself and what he did without mistaking himself for something more than one man among many. His special brand of self-respect required him to honor his fellow men and women no less than himself.

==Legacy and impact==
After examining his writings, University of North Florida historian wrote David T. Courtwright wrote that:

They are based on exhaustive research in primary sources; emphasize human agency as against historicist forces; and are written in precise and graceful prose. This combination of rigor, empathy, and lucidity is intended for, and has succeeded in capturing, a broad audience. Morgan is read by secondary school students, undergraduates, and graduate students, as well as by his specialist peers – some sixty of whom were trained in his seminars.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology American history professor Pauline Maier wrote:

As a historian of colonial and revolutionary America, he was one of the giants of his generation, and a writer who could well have commanded a larger nonacademic audience than I suspect he received. He characteristically took on big issues and had a knack for conveying complex, sophisticated truths in a way that made them seem, if not simple, at least easily understandable.

Brooklyn College history professor Benjamin L. Carp describes Morgan as &quot;one of the great historians of early America, with a formidable influence on academic and popular audiences.&quot; Jill Lepore called Morgan &quot;one of the most influential American historians of the 20th century.&quot; According to Joseph Ellis, Morgan was &quot;revered&quot; by other members of the profession.

Historian and author William Hogeland affirms Morgan&#x27;s success in enshrining a &quot;consensus approach&quot; to U.S. history, where colonists&#x27; ideas, rather than their possible economic interests, were worthy of inspection by 20th century historians. &quot;He was out to define something essential in the American character and thereby create a new master narrative, and to achieve that end, he concocted a false portrayal of the colonists’ petitions,&quot; Hogeland wrote. 

The essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates credits Morgan with greatly influencing his own views about race in American history.

==Awards and honors==
Morgan was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1964 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. In 1971 Morgan was awarded the Yale chapter of Phi Beta Kappa&#x27;s William Clyde DeVane Medal for outstanding teaching and scholarship, considered one of the most prestigious teaching prizes for Yale faculty. In 1971–1972 Morgan served as president of the Organization of American Historians. In 1972, he became the first recipient of the Douglass Adair Memorial Award for scholarship in early American history, and in 1986 he received the Distinguished Scholar Award of the American Historical Association. He has also won numerous fellowships and garnered a number of honorary degrees and named lectureships. In 1965 he became a Sterling Professor, one of Yale&#x27;s highest distinctions. Morgan was awarded the 2000 National Humanities Medal by U.S. President Bill Clinton at a ceremony for &quot;extraordinary contributions to American cultural life and thought.&quot; In 2006 he received a special Pulitzer Prize &quot;for a creative and deeply influential body of work as an American historian that spans the last half century.&quot; In 2008 the American Academy of Arts and Letters honored him with a gold medal for lifetime achievement.

<text>Allington is an almost entirely modern village situated alongside the sides of the A20 road north-west of Maidstone in Kent, England. It is part of the built-up area of Maidstone. 

==History==
The name Allington, which is shared by a hamlet near Lenham, is derived from the Old English &quot;tun&quot; farmstead; it comes via eleventh-century &quot;Elentun&quot; and was connected with a man called Ælla.

Allington Castle was originally built in the 11th century. In 1281 the present stone castle was built, which was converted to a mansion in the 15th century. In 1492 the castle came into the possession of the Wyatt family. By the mid-19th century it was derelict, but was restored in 1905; in 1951 it was taken over by the Carmelite order. Today it is owned by Sir Robert Worcester as a private residence and is not open to the public.

The few dwellings around the castle had a population of 49 in 1841. There was a church dedicated to St Laurence which closed in 1969. In the modern village is a modern parish church dedicated to St Nicholas, the second to be built on the site. Furnishings from St Laurence&#x27;s are used here.

In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 114. On 1 April 1932 the parish was abolished and merged with Maidstone and Boxley. It is now in the unparished area of Maidstone.

==Amenities==
It has two primary schools, Allington Primary and Palace Wood. The Mid Kent Shopping Centre opened in 1969 and includes a Waitrose supermarket and smaller shops. 

Down the hill from St Laurence&#x27;s Church is the River Medway, Allington Lock and Allington Sluice. There is a footpath over the lock. Below the lock, the Medway becomes tidal. On the other bank is the Malta Inn and Kent Life museum. A footpath runs from here to Teston. A &quot;Park and Sail&quot; service (claimed to be the only one in England) operates on the weekends leading up to Christmas. Using the car park and boarding by the Malta Inn, the MV Kentish Lady carries shoppers to Maidstone and back.

The nearby 20/20 industrial park, named after the adjacent M20/A20 junction, includes Allington Quarry Waste Management Facility.

At Poplar Park residents have use of football pitches, tennis courts and a children&#x27;s play area.

==Sports==
Castle Colts along with the affiliate club Castle Wanderers are the local football teams. Both play their home games at the ACA. Jon Harley played for Castle Colts in his youth before being scouted by Chelsea.

<doc id="1237148" wikidata="Q1007760" url="?curid=1237148" title="Billy Wagner">
<text>William Edward Wagner (born July 25, 1971), nicknamed &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;, is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets, Boston Red Sox, and Atlanta Braves from 1995 to 2010. A seven-time All-Star and the 1999 National League (NL) Rolaids Relief Man Award winner, Wagner is one of only eight major league relief pitchers to reach 400 career saves. A left-handed batter and thrower, Wagner stands tall and weighs .

A natural-born right-hander, Wagner learned to throw left-handed after fracturing his arm twice in his youth. Wagner&#x27;s career 11.9 strikeouts per nine innings pitched (K/9) is the highest of any major league pitcher with at least 900 innings pitched. His career 2.31 earned run average, .187 batting average against, and 0.998 WHIP are the lowest of any left-handed pitcher in the live-ball era. He finished in the top ten in saves in the NL ten times, and in the top ten in games finished nine times. In , Wagner was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Wagner was born to 16-year-old Yvonne and 18-year-old William “Hotrod” Wagner in Marion, Virginia, on July 25, 1971. Wagner&#x27;s parents divorced in 1976 when he was five years old. Wagner and his younger sister, Chasity, spent the following 10 years living with various combinations of their parents, their stepparents, and their grandparents in the general Marion area. During this time, Wagner and his family often relied on food stamps. Wagner described a typical breakfast as a &quot;few crackers with peanut butter and a glass of water.&quot;

At seven years old, Wagner&#x27;s right arm was broken when, while playing football with some neighborhood kids, one of them accidentally fell on it. Shortly after having the cast removed, he broke the arm again. To avoid long-term damage to the arm, Wagner, a natural right-hander, began throwing a baseball left-handed.

At 14 years old, Wagner moved in with his aunt, uncle, and cousins, who lived in the Tannersville/Tazewell area about away from Marion. Despite having fallen behind a year in school due to the instability in his home life, Wagner was socially promoted to Tazewell High School because administrators feared he threw hard enough to injure his middle-school classmates.

==Career==
===Amateur career===
Wagner graduated from Tazewell High School in Tazewell, Virginia, compiling a .451 batting average, 23 stolen bases, 29 runs batted in, 116 strikeouts in 46 innings, a 7-1 pitching record, and a 1.52 ERA in his senior season of baseball. As a senior in high school, Wagner grew to only tall and and, as a result, could not get attention from Major League Baseball scouts or Division I schools.

Wagner chose to follow his cousin to Ferrum College, a small liberal-arts college in Ferrum, Virginia, where they both played baseball and football. Coaches at Ferrum encouraged Wagner to focus on baseball and he would eventually take their advice and stop playing football.

Wagner set single-season NCAA records for strikeouts per nine innings, with in 1992, and the fewest hits allowed per nine innings, with 1.88. After the 1992 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), was named the league&#x27;s outstanding pro prospect, and is a member of the CCBL Hall of Fame class of 2022.

In 2012, Wagner was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.

===Houston Astros===
====Minor leagues and early major league career: 1993−97====
Wagner was selected in the first round of the Major League Baseball draft in June 1993 by the Houston Astros. He pitched exclusively as a starting pitcher in Minor League Baseball for the Quad Cities River Bandits, until his major league debut. In 1994, Wagner led all North American minor league pitchers in strikeouts, with 204. Wagner made his first Major League appearance with the Astros, as a late-season promotion from AAA baseball, on September 12, 1995, pitching against one batter late in a 10–5 defeat by the New York Mets. This was his only opportunity to pitch for the Astros that season.

Wagner began in 1996, once again in the minor leagues as a starting pitcher, but he finished the season by becoming a relief pitcher for the Astros. He accumulated a 6–2 record with a 3.28 ERA, in twelve starts for the AAA Tucson Toros. His baseball contract was purchased by the Astros on June 2, 1996, and Wagner was then assigned exclusively as a short-relief pitcher by the Astros manager. He finished the Major League season with nine saves in 13 opportunities, allowed 28 hits, and he struck out 67 hitters in innings – giving him a rate of 11.7 strikeouts per nine innings pitched. His opponents had a batting average of .165 against him.

In 1997, Wagner played his first full season in the Major Leagues. He accumulated 23 saves from 29 save opportunities, and he struck out 106 batters in innings. This set a Major League record of 14.4 strikeouts per nine innings, which broke the old record of 14.1 set by the former Cincinnati Reds relief pitcher Rob Dibble in 1992 (with 110 strikeouts in innings).

Wagner struck out the side 13 times in his 66 innings pitched, and his season total of 106 strikeouts set a Houston Astros record for relief pitchers.

====1998−99====
In 1998, Wagner posted a 4–3 record with a 2.70 ERA and 97 strikeouts in 60 innings pitched. He saved 30 games, which was the third-best single season in team history. He converted 19 consecutive save chances between his first blown save against the Los Angeles Dodgers, on April 12, and then his second one facing the St. Louis Cardinals on July 11.

On July 15, 1998, while protecting an 8–7 lead over the Arizona Diamondbacks, Wagner was struck by a batted ball on the left side of his head behind his ear. Wagner was alert and conscious on the ground, and his vital signs remained good. He was carried off the baseball diamond on a stretcher, and it was found that he had suffered a concussion. He spent the night in the hospital. On the next day, he flew home to Houston, and he was also immediately placed on baseball&#x27;s 15-day disabled list. Wagner worked on his balance and coordination for weeks before he was cleared by the team physicians to embark on a rehabilitation assignment with a minor-league team. After pitching there in three games, Wagner was recalled to the Astros on August 6, and he completed the rest of the baseball season there without incident. The Astros won a franchise-best 102 games while winning the National League Central division title and leading the league in runs scored. Their season ended with a defeat at the hands of the San Diego Padres in the National League Division Series.

Wagner captured the 1999 Relief Man of the Year Award in the National League. He saved 39 games and struck out 124 in 74 innings (15 strikeouts per 9 innings). Wagner posted a 4–1 record with an ERA of 1.57 and had more saves than hits allowed (in innings, he allowed 35 hits).

====2000−03====
The 2000 season started off in typical fashion for Wagner, who saved three of the Astros&#x27; first four wins while retiring 16 of the first 20 batters he faced. However, after recording a save on May 4 against the Chicago Cubs, he suffered back-to-back blown saves on May 12–13 against the Reds. While he was still occasionally throwing 100 m.p.h. as measured by radar, he was not throwing his slider at 85–90 m.p.h. as often as he had been previously. Wagner continued to struggle before going on the disabled list with a torn flexor tendon in his pitching arm and would miss the final three and a half months of the season. He finished with a 2–4 record, a 6.18 ERA, and six saves in 15 opportunities, striking out 28 and walking 18 in innings. He would rebound in 2001. Coming off elbow surgery, he posted a record of 2–5 with 39 saves in 41 chances and an ERA of 2.73. He was one of the leading candidates for The Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award in the National League. In innings, he struck out 79 hitters.

In 2002, Wagner went 4–2 with a 2.52 ERA, 88 strikeouts, and 35 saves in 75 innings. Then, he enjoyed his best season in 2003, when he reached career-highs in saves (44), innings pitched (86) and games (78), and got 105 strikeouts while leading the league in games finished. In that year, he also cemented his status as the hardest-throwing man in baseball by leading the major leagues with 159 pitches at 100 mph or above. Second on the list was starter Bartolo Colón with 12.

On June 11, 2003, Wagner closed out a no-hitter thrown by a record six pitchers against the New York Yankees.

Following the World Series, Wagner criticized the Astros front office for not building a playoff worthy team. On November 3, Billy Wagner was informed that he had been traded to the Philadelphia Phillies.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
Wagner was traded to Philadelphia before the 2004 season, only to have his season shortened by a strain in his hand. He had the best ERA of his career in 2005 and again led the league in games finished. Wagner became a free agent after the 2005 season and signed a four-year, $43-million contract and a one-year club option with the New York Mets.

In a May 7, 2006 interview, Wagner stated that he was confronted by all of his former Phillies teammates in September 2005 after he had criticized their performance in the media by repeatedly saying that the Phillies had &quot;no chance&quot; of making the playoffs (which proved accurate, as the Phillies lost out on the playoffs by one game); Phillies left fielder Pat Burrell reported called Wagner a &quot;rat.&quot; The confrontation reportedly was one of several factors that drove Wagner from Philadelphia in the 2005–2006 offseason.

===New York Mets===
Wagner finished 2006 with 40 saves and a 2.24 ERA and recorded his milestone 300th career save. His performance contributed to the Mets&#x27; first division championship in 18 years. However, he did not have a good post-season: he recorded three saves, but he lost one game and allowed six runs in the innings that he pitched – an ERA of 10.40.

Wagner had a good first half of the season in 2007. He was successful in 17 out of 18 save chances, and his ERA was 1.94. July was his best month, when he recorded eight saves in eight chances; did not allow a run scored; and he won the D.H.L. &quot;Delivery Man of the Month&quot; Award. During that month, Wagner&#x27;s ERA was 0.00, he gave up two hits, and he pitched enough innings to be equivalent to a complete game pitched. His performance earned him a slot on the National League All-Star Team.

The second half of Wagner&#x27;s baseball season was not nearly as successful. He converted 13 out of 17 save chances, and his ERA was 3.90. Wagner&#x27;s pitching performance declined during the final two months of the season. On August 30, Wagner failed to save the crucial fourth game of a four-game series between the Phillies and Mets. The final result was four-game sweep by the Phillies. This sweep turned out to be the difference in the season: the Mets finished one game behind the Phillies at the end of the regular season, completing a seven-game collapse. One more win against the Phillies would have allowed the Mets to win the division that year.

Wagner had an ERA of 6.23 in August of that season, and he suffered from back spasms during September.

On May 15, 2008, Wagner issued a tirade full of profanity against his teammates and coaches following the Mets&#x27; 1–0 loss in a game against the Washington Nationals. Some people have speculated that this was directed in particular toward his teammates Carlos Beltrán and Carlos Delgado about their not being available for interviews with the press following games. However, Wagner&#x27;s pitching performance in April, May, and June was good enough to find him chosen by the All-Star Game&#x27;s National League manager for his pitching staff.

During this All-Star Game, Wagner, pitching late in the game, surrendered a game-tying double to the American league&#x27;s third baseman, Evan Longoria, and then the National League lost the ballgame in 15 innings.

In September 2008, the Mets announced that Wagner had torn the ulnar collateral ligament of his left elbow and also his flexor pronator tendon. These injuries required Tommy John surgery. This surgery, and its recovery, put Wagner out of play for a calendar year.

Wagner had a guaranteed-payment baseball contract, and he was paid a total of $10.5 million by the Mets in 2009. For the baseball year 2010, his contract gave the Mets an option to pay him $8 million for the season, or else to pay him $1 million to terminate the contract.

In the news conference following the announcement of his major elbow injury, Wagner vowed that he would return to playing Major League Baseball. Although he had previously stated that he would not pitch anymore following 2009, Wagner amended this by saying that he did not wish to end his baseball career in this fashion – ending it on a major injury. He also said that he had dreams of winning a World Series, and also of reaching a total of about 420 saves in his career.

However, Wagner stated furthermore that he had &quot;played his last [baseball] game as a Met&quot;. Wagner explained that it would not make good business sense for the Mets to guarantee him $8 million for 2009, pitching or not pitching.

Despite these statements, Wagner remained on the Mets&#x27; 40-man roster on the disabled list at the beginning of the season in 2009, and still drawing his salary. He pitched for the first time in 2009 for the Mets late in the season on August 20, in a game against the Atlanta Braves. He pitched one inning with two strikeouts and giving up no hits or walks.

===Boston Red Sox===
On August 21, 2009, it was reported that the Boston Red Sox claimed Wagner off waivers from the Mets. After initial reports suggested Wagner would invoke his no-trade clause to veto a trade, he agreed to be traded on August 25 for Chris Carter and Eddie Lora, with the added stipulation that the Red Sox could not exercise his $8 million option for 2010, but could offer him salary arbitration. The Red Sox did offer Wagner arbitration, but he declined so the Red Sox received the first-round draft pick from the team that signed Wagner (Atlanta Braves) and a sandwich pick in the 2010 rookie draft. His only victory in a Red Sox uniform came on September 9, against the Orioles.

===Atlanta Braves===
On December 2, 2009, Wagner and the Atlanta Braves agreed on a one-year contract worth $7 million that included a $6.5-million vesting option for the 2011 season. On April 30, 2010, Wagner revealed that he would retire at the end of the 2010 season to spend more time with his family. In a game against the Detroit Tigers on June 25, Wagner achieved his 400th career save. After the game, he told reporters that he still planned to retire after the 2010 season. On July 11, Wagner was selected as an injury replacement to the 2010 National League All-Star roster, which he declined due to an ankle injury.

He played his final regular season game on October 3, 2010, and struck out the final four batters he faced – the last three of whom struck out looking. He concluded his final major-league regular season with a career-best 1.43 ERA. Wagner made his final major-league appearance on October 8 in Game 2 of the 2010 National League Division Series against the San Francisco Giants. Wagner suffered an injury to his left oblique and left the game after facing just two batters. The Braves eventually lost the series before Wagner could recover.

==Post-playing career==
Wagner retired to Crozet, Virginia, following the 2010 season.

On February 12, 2011, Wagner reiterated his intention to retire, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m totally content with not playing baseball,&quot; Wagner said. &quot;I love watching it, I love talking about it. If I miss anything, it would be some of the guys I played with and actually competing on the field, but other than that, you can keep it.&quot;

On March 30, 2011, the Braves officially released Wagner.
Billy Wagner became the Baseball Coach for The Miller School of Albemarle in Virginia. He coached against his high school alma mater and his own high school coach on April 6, 2013. The Mavericks won the 2017 and 2018 Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association Division II championship.

In 2024, his son, Will Wagner, debuted for the Toronto Blue Jays.

==Accomplishments and honors==
===Career perspective===
Of all pitchers with at least 800 innings pitched, Wagner&#x27;s 11.9 K/9 and 33.2% strikeout rate total batters faced are both the highest in major league history. Opposing batters hit for only a .187 average against him, lowest in MLB history with 800+ innings pitched. Wagner also has the lowest hits-per-nine-innings ratio (H/9) in history, for pitchers with 800+ innings, allowing 5.99 hits per nine innings. In 2019, Wagner was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame.

===National Baseball Hall of Fame consideration===
Wagner first appeared on balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2016 when he received 10.5% of the vote, well short of the 75% required for election, but above the 5% minimum required to remain on the ballot. His support continued to increase: 46.4% on the 2021 ballot, 51.0% on the 2022 ballot, 68.1% of the 2023 ballot, and 73.8% on the 2024 ballot. The 2024 ballot put him just five votes shy of the threshold. In 2025, his final year on the ballot, he was elected to the hall after receiving 82.5% of the vote. He became the eighth player in the modern voting era (since 1966) to be elected on his final ballot, after Red Ruffing, Joe Medwick, Ralph Kiner, Jim Rice, Tim Raines, Edgar Martínez, and Larry Walker.

<doc id="1237153" wikidata="Q723410" url="?curid=1237153" title="John Wark">
<text>John Wark (born 4 August 1957) is a Scottish former footballer who spent most of his playing time with Ipswich Town. He won a record four Player of the Year awards before becoming one of the four inaugural members of the club&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Wark had long spells at the club, which bookended his career, and a third, brief interlude dividing his briefer periods at Liverpool and Middlesbrough. A versatile player, Wark played most of his professional games as a midfielder, although he sometimes played as a central defender and on occasion as a striker.

Born in Glasgow, Wark represented Scotland in international football, winning 29 caps and scoring seven goals. This included selection for Scotland in the 1982 FIFA World Cup in which he made three appearances and scored twice.

During his playing career, Wark appeared in the film &quot;Escape to Victory&quot;. Since retiring as a professional player in 1996, he has continued to work for Ipswich Town—since September 2008 in the corporate hospitality department. His autobiography, &quot;Wark On&quot;, was published in 2009.

== Early life ==
Wark was born on 4 August 1957, in Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital to parents Alex and Helen. The third of four children, he has an older sister Wilma, older brother Alex and younger brother Andrew. The family lived in a four-storey tenement block in Partick. The family was impoverished: Wark&#x27;s parents could not afford a cot and as a small child, he slept in a drawer from a sideboard. Although christened John, Wark was soon referred to by his family as Johnny, a diminutive that stuck throughout his footballing career.

In the early 1960s, the family moved to another tenement block, this time in Scotstoun, and Wark&#x27;s father secured employment at nearby Albion Motors. The new home accommodated a back yard in which Wark played football from the age of six. He said &quot;[f]ootball seemed to occupy 99 per cent of my time as a youngster&quot; as he tried to emulate his brother Alex, who had become a professional at St Mirren. Wark attended Scotstoun Primary School, where he became captain of the football team. On moving to secondary school, he was selected for the Glasgow Schools representative team. He also played for Drumchapel Amateurs at the under-14 level, where he was, for a period, managed by David Moyes&#x27; father, also named David.

During Wark&#x27;s time at Drumchapel, he attracted the attention of Celtic. He trained with the club at their Parkhead ground, before receiving an invitation to sign schoolboy forms for the club. As a lifelong Rangers fan with whom Celtic have a notable rivalry and with interest from &quot;several English clubs&quot;, including Bristol City, Manchester City and Ipswich Town, Wark stalled on the offer. He trialled with both Ipswich Town and Manchester City, and selected Ipswich when the latter remained non-committal. On arrival at Portman Road, Town manager Bobby Robson, later described by Wark as the person in football &quot;who had the single biggest influence on [him]&quot;, personally welcomed him and Wark signed with the club as an apprentice.

== Domestic playing career ==

=== First spell at Ipswich ===
Wark started his career at Ipswich in the youth team, initially playing at left back before moving to the centre of defence and occasionally occupying the right back position. He signed up as a professional for the club on his 17th birthday. Selected for the senior squad as a replacement for the injured Kevin Beattie, Wark made his first-team debut on 27 March 1975 in the 3–2 FA Cup 6th round (3rd replay) victory over Leeds United; the game was played at Leicester City&#x27;s Filbert Street. A nervous and homesick Wark was reassured by manager Robson:
&quot;My debut was in the quarter-final of the FA Cup against the Leeds team of Giles and Bremner. He [Robson] said, &#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t put you in the team if I didn&#x27;t think you were good enough&#x27;. He was a father figure as well because I was homesick. If it hadn&#x27;t been for the boss I would have been straight back to Glasgow.&quot;
Making four more first-team appearances in place of injured regulars, Wark ended the season still on the youth team, and experienced success in the final of the FA Youth Cup, defeating West Ham United 5–1. He spent much of the 1975–76 season playing for the reserves, and was presented with the club&#x27;s Young Player of the Year award, despite making just four appearances for the senior team. Moving into midfield, Wark made over 30 appearances in the 1976–77 season, scoring his first goals for the club, (10, in all) taking over penalty kicking duty; he also received his first red card.

In June 1977, Wark was selected for the Scotland squad for the first time, for a friendly match against East Germany; however, a torn hamstring sustained in pre-season training ended any chance of an international debut. The injury also kept him out of first-team football until January 1978, when he returned for a match against Cardiff City in the third round of the 1977–78 FA Cup.
Indifferent league performances that season meant that Ipswich finished just three points above the relegation zone, but the season ended in success in the FA Cup. Wark scored in a 3–1 victory over West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final, and appeared in the final at Wembley as part of a side that surprised favourites Arsenal, winning the game 1–0. Wark remarked, &quot;We were underdogs but on the day we hammered them.&quot; Wark did not touch the ball for the first 18 minutes of the match, and as the players left the pitch at half-time, David Geddis said to Wark, &quot;Make sure you hit it between the posts in the second-half. Avoid the white bits.&quot; In the second half of the game, Wark &quot;ignored Geddis&#x27; advice and hit Pat Jennings&#x27; right post twice with almost identical swerving right-foot shots from outside the penalty area&quot;.

Twice in the three seasons that followed, Ipswich came close to winning the League championship, but finished as runners-up to Liverpool and Aston Villa, respectively. However, Ipswich did win the club&#x27;s only European trophy when they lifted the 1980–81 UEFA Cup. Wark set a competition record by scoring 14 goals—including two, one in each leg—in the final as Ipswich overcame Dutch side AZ 67 Alkmaar 5–4 on aggregate. Wark&#x27;s record equalled the long-standing scoring record in a European competition, set by José Altafini of A.C. Milan in the 1962–63 European Cup. Wark&#x27;s personal triumph that year was to win a European accolade, Young Player of the Year, and gain the acclaim of his fellow professionals in England to earn the PFA Player of the Year award. He ended the 1980–81 season with 36 goals.

Wark continued to play for Ipswich, but after Robson left to become England manager in 1982, the side was gradually broken up by new manager Bobby Ferguson. Following a rejected demand for a wage increase, Wark submitted a transfer request, which was accepted. He signed for Liverpool for £450,000 on 10 March 1984. At the time, Liverpool had won the league title six times, the European Cup three times and the League Cup three times in the preceding eight seasons.

Wark&#x27;s final full season at Portman Road, 1982–83, had seen him record the highest league goals tally of his career. He scored 20 goals in 42 league games, though it was not enough to prevent Ipswich from slipping to ninth place in the final table – their lowest position since finishing 18th in 1978.

=== Liverpool ===
The medical examination for Wark&#x27;s transfer somewhat surprised him:

&quot;I was rather taken aback when the doctor entered the Anfield boot room&quot;, Wark said. &quot;He was small in stature and I could not help but detect the smell of alcohol on his breath as he introduced himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. &quot;He took my blood pressure, looked at the reading and muttered &#x27;that&#x27;s fine&#x27;. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes. &quot;Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce &#x27;you&#x27;ve passed&#x27;. That was it, my Liverpool medical.&quot;

Wark made his debut for the club on 31 March 1984 in a 2–0 league win against Watford at Vicarage Road, and scored Liverpool&#x27;s opening goal in the 58th minute. Liverpool won the English league title that season, and Wark made sufficient appearances to earn himself a medal. His unusual ability as a goalscoring midfielder was on display when he finished the 1984–85 season as the club&#x27;s top goalscorer, ahead of prolific striker Ian Rush, with a tally of 27 goals in 62 appearances—a goal every 2.3 games. Wark&#x27;s season included three hat-tricks, one each in the League, the FA Cup and the European Cup. Liverpool qualified for the 1985 European Cup Final but the match was overshadowed by the Heysel Stadium Disaster, a tragedy Wark remembers as &quot;a nightmare memory&quot;.

In the 1985–86 season, Wark made 18 appearances, scoring six times, but missed out on the club&#x27;s run-in to their League and FA Cup &quot;double&quot;, due to a broken ankle suffered just after the turn of 1986, followed by an Achilles tendon injury. He eventually regained his fitness but struggled to regain his place in the Liverpool team until injury to Steve McMahon allowed him back in. Wark came on as a late substitute (but according to him, never touched the ball) when Liverpool lost the 1987 League Cup Final to Arsenal. No longer a part of manager Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s plans following the arrival of new midfielders including John Barnes, Wark was sold back to Ipswich on 4 January 1988 for £100,000. In spite of more financially lucrative offers from both Watford and Coventry City, he followed Bobby Robson&#x27;s advice: &quot;Money isn&#x27;t everything—go where you will be happiest.&quot; Wark left the Merseyside club with a record of 42 goals in 108 appearances, a goal every 2.6 games.

=== Second spell at Ipswich ===
Ipswich had been relegated 18 months before Wark&#x27;s return to the club and were still playing in the second tier of English football. During this second spell at Ipswich, Wark was close to being an ever-present in the side: he missed just two games in two seasons. He was the club&#x27;s equal top-scorer in the 1988–89 season, sharing the achievement with forwards Dalian Atkinson and Jason Dozzell.

Following three seasons of mid-table finishes, manager John Duncan was sacked and replaced by John Lyall. With his contract expiring, Wark received what he considered to be a &quot;derisory&quot; offer from Lyall, which he declined. Once he became a free agent, Wark signed on a free transfer for Second Division rivals Middlesbrough in August 1990. In his two additional seasons with Ipswich, Wark had scored 20 goals, and won the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award in both seasons.

=== Middlesbrough ===
Wark signed for Middlesbrough, the first club to show &quot;a definite interest&quot; in him, on a two-year contract, moving back to play in the centre of defence. He made regular appearances and helped the team to seventh place by the end of the season and qualification for the Second Division play-offs. Following a 1–1 draw with Notts County at Ayresome Park, Wark was informed by manager Colin Todd that he would not be selected for the second leg. Wark was outraged; Middlesbrough lost the second leg 1–0. Todd departed from the club and was replaced by Lennie Lawrence, who insisted that all players live &quot;within an hour of Ayresome Park&quot;. Wark was still living in Ipswich at the time and following a &quot;sensible agreement&quot; with Lawrence, Wark&#x27;s contract was terminated and he became a free agent again.

=== Third spell at Ipswich ===
Remaining without a club before the start of the 1991–92 season, Wark trained with Ipswich to keep fit, and rejected interest in his services from Leyton Orient, Colchester United and Falkirk. When Ipswich suffered a succession of injuries among their defenders, they offered him a contract, initially on a week-by-week basis, before securing a year-long deal. Wark made 43 appearances in the first season of his third spell with the club. Early results in the season were excellent; the club won seven of their first 11 matches in the league. In the FA Cup, Ipswich progressed to a fifth round encounter against Liverpool; when the tie went to a replay at Anfield, Wark received a standing ovation from both sets of fans. Ipswich lost the match 3–2 after extra time, having led 2–1 in the first period. Ipswich went on to finish strongly in their league campaign and were crowned Second Division champions and promoted into the newly formed Premier League. Wark ended the season as the club&#x27;s Player of the Year for the third time.

Wark agreed to a new one-year contract for the 1992–93 season and was asked to feature in a Sky Sports advertisement to promote the inaugural Premier League competition. Ipswich were the only Premier League club to remain unbeaten after eight games (a sequence that included Wark&#x27;s first Premier League goal in a 1–1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur). Ipswich went fourth in February and there was talk of finally winning that title that had eluded them more than once during Wark&#x27;s first spell there, but 13 consecutive games without a win resulted a 16th-place finish in the table, just three points above the relegation zone, and only a win on the final day of the season made sure of their survival. Wark, now aged 37, secured yet another one-year contract shortly before the end of the 1993–94 season. Ipswich were saved from relegation in the last round of matches (for the second season running, another good start had given way to a late season slump), courtesy of an injury time winning goal scored by Mark Stein of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, which ensured that Ipswich&#x27;s fellow strugglers Sheffield United went down. Wark went on to be voted the club&#x27;s Player of the Year for a record fourth time.

Ipswich and Wark fared worse in the 1994–95 season. The club lost 9–0 to Manchester United during a season in which Ipswich &quot;recorded fewer victories and suffered more defeats than in any campaign in the club&#x27;s history&quot;. He was sent off in the away game at Norwich, where the team lost 3–0. Wark made fewer than 20 appearances in the following season, primarily because of a persistent foot injury. Despite his appearance in three more matches in the 1996–97 season, and a testimonial against Arsenal at Portman Road, Wark played his last professional match against Tranmere Rovers on 30 November 1996 at the age of 39. By this stage, he was the club&#x27;s oldest player. Of a total 826 league matches played by Wark as a professional, he made 679 appearances for Ipswich. , he is Ipswich Town&#x27;s third-highest all-time scorer, with 179 goals scored for the club, despite rarely appearing as a striker.

== International playing career ==
From 1979, Wark was selected to play for his country, usually as a defender, eventually winning 29 caps for Scotland and scoring seven goals. Jock Stein was the Scotland manager who gave him his debut, in a game held on 19 May 1979, a British Home Championship match against Wales at Ninian Park; Scotland lost 3–0. Wark scored his first international goal a week later on 26 May, again in a British Home Championship game, this time against England at Wembley. Wark&#x27;s opening effort was not enough, as Scotland were defeated 3–1. A week later Wark played for Scotland in a friendly against Argentina at Hampden Park. However, the game is best remembered for Diego Maradona scoring his first international goal in helping Argentina to a comfortable 3–1 win.

After a 3–1 home defeat by Belgium in December 1979, Wark was not selected again for his country until February 1981 for the 1982 World Cup qualifying match away against Israel. Following a successful qualification campaign, Wark was included in the Scotland squad that went to the World Cup in Spain under Stein&#x27;s leadership. Wark played three games and scored two goals, both of which were in Scotland&#x27;s 5-2 opening match victory over New Zealand. Scotland were knocked out in the group stage.

Wark&#x27;s final appearance for Scotland came in September 1984, under Stein; he was replaced in favour of Paul McStay at halftime in a 6–1 victory over Yugoslavia.

== Life outside football ==
=== Personal life ===
Wark has married twice—first to Toula, on 1 July 1981, with whom he has a son, Andrew, born in June 1983. He married Karen at Gretna Green in April 2009.

=== Film appearance ===

In 1981, Wark was one of several Ipswich players who appeared alongside stars including Bobby Moore and Pelé in the Second World War football film &quot;Escape to Victory&quot;, which starred Sylvester Stallone, Michael Caine and Max von Sydow. Wark played a character called Arthur Hayes, but his only line of dialogue was dubbed due to his broad Glaswegian accent.

=== Since retirement as a player ===
Following his retirement from playing football professionally, Wark continued to live in Suffolk, like many other ex-Ipswich players, including Allan Hunter, Mick Mills, Roger Osborne and Mick Lambert. Despite his retirement from the professional ranks, Wark continued playing football as an amateur, and signed for Woodbridge Town in 1999 alongside former Ipswich team-mate Paul Mason. He also played veterans football for Windsor and Eton, played with Soccer AM&#x27;s &quot;Badgers&quot; team at the Millennium Stadium, and has represented the Liverpool veterans in the Sky Sports Masters series.

In 2005, Wark was voted as the BBC television programme Football Focus &quot;all-time cult hero&quot; by Ipswich Town fans. In 2008 Radio Suffolk announced that he would join their commentary team as a summariser, alongside former team-mates Kevin Beattie and Bryan Hamilton. Wark was working in the corporate hospitality department at Ipswich Town in September 2008. As of March 2014, he remains in that job.

=== Autobiography ===
Wark&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Wark On&quot; was published on 9 April 2009. The book contained material that gained media interest. Wark sold his [FA Cup Final] tickets for cash to a ticket tout.

== Playing style and personality ==
Wark played as a central defender, midfielder and, occasionally, as a striker.

Wark was not a &quot;supremely talented&quot; player, but, according to football journalist Jim White, one who espoused team-work and team spirit: &quot;There is no question that the &#x27;one-for-all, all-for-one&#x27; mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. With players such as Alan Kennedy, John Wark, Sammy Lee and Craig Johnston, nobody could claim this was a collection of top-notch operators in the manner, say, of the current Real Madrid. Every week, they played as an entity greater than the sum of its parts.&quot; He has been described as &quot;a defensive midfielder with an astonishing goalscoring record&quot;.

Over the years, Wark has become closely associated with his moustache. Owen Slot described the player as &quot;Ipswich&#x27;s immortal moustache&quot;, while Wark himself notes &quot;... it is something of a trademark, even if people are always calling me Bruce ...&quot;

== Honours ==
In 2006 Wark gained the final place in the poll 100 Players Who Shook the Kop, conducted by the liverpoolfc.tv website. The list was compiled as a result of a fan survey: &quot;Over 110,000 supporters all nominated their own personal Top 10 players in order of impact made&quot;.
In 2007, the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association polled fans of all Football League clubs, as to &quot;their No 1 player&quot; as part of the &quot;centenary celebrations of the players&#x27; union&quot;; Wark was the choice of Ipswich fans. In the same year, Wark was one of four Ipswich Town players to be inducted into the club&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<text>Cliff Robert Martinez (born February 5, 1954) is an American musician and composer. Early in his career, Martinez was known as a drummer notably with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Captain Beefheart. Since the 1990s, he has worked primarily as a film score composer, writing music for &quot;Spring Breakers&quot; (2012), &quot;The Foreigner&quot; (2017), and multiple films by Steven Soderbergh (&quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot; (1989), &quot;Solaris&quot; (2002), &quot;Contagion&quot; (2011), and &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000)) and Nicolas Winding Refn (&quot;Drive&quot; (2011), &quot;Only God Forgives&quot; (2013), &quot;The Neon Demon&quot; (2016) and the miniseries &quot;Too Old to Die Young&quot; (2019)).

On April 14, 2012, Martinez was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

==Early life==
Martinez was born in the Bronx, New York City. His grandfather migrated from a small village in Spain to the United States. Raised in Columbus, Ohio, his first job composing was for the popular television show &quot;Pee Wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. At the time, however, he was more interested in rock bands, and played drums in a variety of them, mostly in a temporary capacity.

==Red Hot Chili Peppers (1983–1986)==
After several years drumming for such acts as Captain Beefheart, The Dickies, Lydia Lunch and The Weirdos, in late 1983, he and Jack Sherman were drafted in to join the Red Hot Chili Peppers for the recording of their eponymous first album after Jack Irons and Hillel Slovak left the band to concentrate on their other project at the time, What Is This?. Martinez again played on the recording of the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Freaky Styley&quot; (1985) and its subsequent tour.

In 2012 Martinez was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Martinez performed with the band for the first time in 26 years when he joined them along with former drummer Jack Irons on their song, &quot;Give It Away&quot; during the ceremony.

==Film composing==

Eventually, Martinez&#x27; interests shifted and he focused his attention toward film scoring. A tape Martinez had put together using new technologies made its rounds, leading him to score an episode of &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. The same recording also ended up in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s hands and Martinez was hired to score the famed director&#x27;s first theatrical release, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot;. Martinez&#x27;s longstanding relationship with Soderbergh has continued through the years and they have worked together on ten theatrical releases including &quot;Kafka&quot; (1991), &quot;The Limey&quot; (1999), &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000), &quot;Solaris&quot; (2002) and 2011&#x27;s &quot;Contagion&quot;, as well the Cinemax series &quot;The Knick&quot; (2014–2015).

His nontraditional scores tend towards being stark and sparse, utilizing a modern tonal palette to paint the backdrop for films that are often dark, psychological stories like &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; (1990), &quot;The Limey&quot;, &quot;Wonderland&quot; (2003), &quot;Wicker Park&quot; (2004) and &quot;Drive&quot; (2011). Martinez has been nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media (Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Traffic&quot;), a César Award for Best Original Music (Xavier Giannoli&#x27;s &quot;In the Beginning&quot; (2009)), and a Broadcast Film Critics Award (&quot;Drive&quot;). He earned a Robert Award for Best Score for his work on &quot;Only God Forgives&quot; (2013).

Martinez&#x27;s use of audio manipulations, particularly for percussive sounds, has been evolving through the years and is evident by the hammered dulcimer of &quot;Kafka&quot;, the gray-areas between sound design and score for &quot;Traffic&quot;, the steel drums and textures of &quot;Solaris&quot;, what Martinez called &quot;rhythmi-tizing pitched, ambient textures&quot; of &quot;Narc&quot; (2002), and &quot;using percussion performances to trigger and shape the rhythmic and tonal characteristics of those ambient textures,&quot; as he described his score for 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot;.

Martinez served as a juror for the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and served on the International Feature nominating committee for the 27th Independent Spirit Awards in February that same year. Martinez&#x27;s recent films include Robert Redford&#x27;s &quot;The Company You Keep&quot; (2012), Nicholas Jarecki&#x27;s &quot;Arbitrage&quot; (2012), Harmony Korine&#x27;s &quot;Spring Breakers&quot; (2012) (co-composed with Skrillex), and Nicolas Winding Refn&#x27;s &quot;Only God Forgives&quot; and &quot;The Neon Demon&quot; (2016).

==Video game composing==
Martinez composed the main menu music titled &quot;Galaxy Theme&quot; for &quot;Spore&quot; in 2008. In 2014, Martinez also composed the title score for &quot;Far Cry 4&quot;.

==Advertising==
In 2013, Martinez scored the &quot;Fly Beyond&quot; Grey Goose vodka commercial. Martinez also composed two songs, &quot;Vibe&quot; and &quot;Kotopulse&quot;, for the 2014 Lincoln Motor Company advertising campaign featuring Matthew McConaughey.

<text>Peter J. Tobin (born 1944 in Bronx, New York) is an American businessman and philanthropist. He has a wife Mary, a son Peter, and a daughter Kristin. He graduated with his Bachelor of Business Administration at St. John&#x27;s University in 1965. Tobin was most recognized as the chief financial officer of Chase Manhattan Bank and CFO of Chemical Bank. He donated a generous amount to St. John&#x27;s University, where the business school was renamed in his honor. He has led several companies through successful mergers and acquisitions and has had a very successful career.

== Biography ==

=== Early life===

Peter J. Tobin was born and raised in the Bronx borough of New York City by his two Irish immigrant parents. After graduating from St. Nicholas of Tolentine in the Bronx, he planned to work during the day and attend school at night at Manhattan College. He was offered a full tuition scholarship from St. John&#x27;s University through his local parish and decided to attend school there. He was unsure at the time about a field of study, but a quick influence from one of his professors made him enroll as an accounting major at the College of Business Administration. Tobin graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from St. John&#x27;s University in 1965. In 1966, Tobin married Mary Gamble of the Bronx, who he met at a dance in Yonkers and felt instantly in love.

=== Corporate life ===

After graduating from St. John&#x27;s University in 1965, Tobin brought the school&#x27;s Vincentian values to the corporate world. He began his career at Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Company, where he stayed until 1972 when he moved to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Branch Bank. There, he quickly moved up the corporate ladder, making it to senior Vice President by 1981, and named the CFO in 1985.

In 1991, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Branch Bank merged with Chemical Bank, and he remained the CFO. Five years later, Tobin played a pivotal role in the purchase of Chase Manhattan Bank. It was decided to drop the name Chemical Bank because Chase was better known around the world. At Chase, he remained the CFO for one year and then retired.

After his retirement in 1997, he became one of the most sought after banking professionals in the world. He became a dean at St. John&#x27;s University, and continued his business role by serving on multiple corporate boards.

=== St. John’s University ===

In 1998 Tobin assumed the deanship at the College of Business at St. John&#x27;s. During his time there he added 13 new programs, hired new faculty and renewed AACSB accreditation by the Internal Association for Management Education.

In 1999, Tobin and his wife Mary made a substantial donation of $10.25 million to St. John&#x27;s University. The business school was then renamed to Peter J. Tobin College of Business for his generosity. This was the largest donation in the school&#x27;s 129-year history. He was honored with the Spirit of Service Award and the honorary degree of Doctor of Commercial Science. He was also awarded the highest award that can be given to alumni, the Medal of Honor in 2000 by Donald J. Harrington, President of St. John&#x27;s University.

=== Current ===

Tobin continues to be active in the business community, philanthropy. He has been a director at AllianceBernstein since 2000, AXA Financial since 1999, and CIT Group since 2002. In addition to being on these boards Tobin is a member of the New York City Independent Budget Office Advisory Board and on the board of the H.W. Wilson Company.

<doc id="1237188" wikidata="Q939473" url="?curid=1237188" title="Topical stamp collecting">
<text>Topical or thematic stamp collecting is the collecting of postage stamps relating to a particular subject or concept. Topics can be almost anything, from stamps on stamps, birds, trains and poets on stamps, to famous physicians and scientists, along with historical people and events on stamps, which is often a standard theme for many stamp issuing countries.

== Background ==
The earliest stamps simply depicted busts of reigning monarchs, important figures, or coats of arms, but as time went on stamps started to have a wider range of designs. Bears appeared on provisional stamps of St. Louis in 1845, while the beaver was featured on the earliest stamps of Canada. More than 150 years later, the variety of designs on stamps is enormous, giving topical collectors plenty of scope to find stamps for their chosen theme. In fact, so many stamps have been issued that some popular themes, such as ships or birds, have become nearly impossible to complete, and topical collectors may specialize further, such as by looking for only square-rigged sailing ships, or only flightless birds.

== Collecting ==
Since most types of stamp designs are commonly available and inexpensive, acquiring them is mostly a matter of poring over the stamp catalog looking for relevant types, and learning enough about the topic to recognize subtle connections. The American Topical Association and others have published handbooks and lists of larger topics.

Online marketplaces and trade platforms are the most common way of collecting new stamps.

== Competitions ==
Topical collecting is a recognized category for competitive exhibitions and has its own Commission with the FIP (Fédération Internationale de Philatélie).

==Topics ==
Some topics include:
*Art Deco stamps
*Bicycles on stamps
*Birds on stamps
*Chemistry on stamps
*Dinosaurs on stamps
*Fish on stamps
*Insects on stamps
*Leniniana
*Mathematics on stamps
*People on stamps
*Presidents on stamps
*Ships on stamps
*U.S. space exploration history on U.S. stamps
*Soviet space exploration history on Soviet stamps
*Stamps on stamps

Stamps with an anarchist theme were issued during the Spanish Civil War by the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo.

<doc id="1237195" wikidata="Q2350255" url="?curid=1237195" title="Stinson Aircraft Company">
<text>The Stinson Aircraft Company was an aircraft manufacturing company in the United States between the 1920s and the 1950s.

==History==
The Stinson Aircraft Company was founded in Dayton, Ohio, in 1920 by aviator Edward “Eddie” Stinson, the brother of aviator Katherine Stinson. After five years of business ventures, Eddie made Detroit, Michigan the focus of his future flying endeavors while still flying as a stunt pilot, earning $100,000 a year for his efforts — a huge sum in those days.

Stinson found Detroit&#x27;s business community receptive to his plans to develop his own airplane. Alfred V. Verville and a group of local businessmen — the Detroit Board of Commerce&#x27;s Aviation Committee — supported Stinson&#x27;s plans to establish the Stinson Aircraft Syndicate in 1925, and provided $25,000 to design and build a prototype, an enclosed cockpit, 4-place biplane, powered by a Wright Whirlwind J-4 air-cooled radial engine test flighted at Packard Field in Roseville, Michigan, a northeast suburb of Detroit. Packard Field was the first commercial air field in Michigan, opened in 1919, site of Packard Aviation and the Michigan State School of Aviation, making it a natural location for Stinson to launch his business in the Detroit area.

The Stinson Detroiter SB-1 (for &quot;Stinson Biplane model 1&quot;) made its maiden flight from Packard Field on January 25, 1926. The plane not only had a rare (for the period) enclosed cabin, it also had heat (which was a big plus given the cold Michigan winter), upholstered seats and side panels, and even an electric cigar lighter. It became an overnight success, and flights were offered in February to 70 riders thus enabling Stinson to raise $150,000 in public stock capital to go into production. Stinson incorporated in Michigan as the Stinson Aircraft Corporation. On May 4, 1926, Eddie acquired the Stimson (no connection to Stinson and no typo error) Scale Mfg. building in Northville, Michigan, just across the pond from the locally famous Ford Valve Plant, and the first production model SB-1 rolled out just three months later in August 1926. Stinson employed over 250 workers at the Northville factory in 1926.)

The aircraft were too large to be completely assembled in the Northville plant, so the wings were attached to the fuselage just west of town at the new, local Northville Airfield, a land project owned by a group of village entrepreneurs established to support the Stinson factory. Aircraft were then flown and delivered from here to buyers. Stinson Aircraft Corp. sold a remarkable 18 SB-1 Detroiters by the end of 1926, completing manufacture of 10 aircraft, while the prototype SB-1 was sold to Horace Dodge, son of one of the Dodge Motor Cars founders.

Northwest (today Delta Airlines) sold its first passenger ticket in July 1927, on their first of several SB-1s (and later SM-1s). By this time, the Stinson Corp. had erected their own concrete-floored steel hangar at the airfield, where they could complete the aircraft assembly process of attaching the wings. The finished superstructure fuselages were simply pulled through the center of town to the airfield behind Ford Model TT trucks, while the wings were put on trailers.

Toward the end of 1926, Stinson Aircraft Corp. began developing their next generation SM-1 (Stinson Monoplane type 1), a six-place monoplane initially powered by the more powerful Wright J-5. The maiden flight took place in the spring of 1927. Coincidentally, the new monoplane had nearly the same wing dimensions and many similar design elements of the Ryan monoplane flown in Lindbergh&#x27;s famous transatlantic flight of May 1927. This model eventually replaced the biplane completely, and by 1928 the SB-1 was out of production by the time the FAA finally got around to officially certificating it. The early SM-1s were built and flown out of Northville, but the company outgrew its facilities and left Northville by 1929, moving to Wayne, Michigan, which was next to the site of the Detroit Industrial Airport.

Business was steadily increasing, and Stinson delivered 121 aircraft in 1929.

Automobile mogul Errett Lobban (E.L.) Cord acquired 60 percent of Stinson&#x27;s stock in September 1929, and his Cord Corporation provided additional investment capital to permit Stinson to sell its aircraft at a competitive price while still pursuing new designs. At the height of the Depression in 1930, Stinson offered six aircraft models, ranging from the four-seat Junior to the Stinson 6000 trimotor airliner.

Eddie Stinson did not live to enjoy the success of his company. He died in an air crash in Chicago, Illinois on January 26, 1932, while on a sales trip. At the time of his death at age 38, Stinson had acquired more than 16,000 hours of flight time — more than any other pilot at the time.

The Stinson name did not last for long past the end of World War II. Eddie Stinson&#x27;s death accelerated the assimilation of Stinson Aircraft Corporation into larger corporate entities: first by Cord Corporation, then by Aviation Corporation (AVCO), and later by Consolidated Vultee. In 1948, the Stinson company was sold to the Piper Aircraft Corporation, which continued to produce 108s for a limited time. Piper transformed an original Stinson design (the &quot;Twin Stinson&quot;) into the successful Piper Apache, the world&#x27;s first general aviation all-metal twin-engined modern aircraft.

<text>Cangjie () is a legendary ancient Chinese figure said to have been an official historian of the Yellow Emperor and the inventor of Chinese characters. Legend has it that he had four eyes, and that when he invented the characters, the deities and ghosts cried and the sky rained millet. He is considered a legendary rather than historical figure, or at least not considered to be the sole inventor of Chinese characters. Cangjie was the eponym for the (c. 220 BCE) &quot;Cangjiepian&quot; proto-dictionary, the Cangjie method of inputting characters into a computer, and a Martian rock visited by the Mars rover &quot;Spirit&quot;, and named by the rover team.

==Legend of character creation==
There are several versions of the legend.

One tells that shortly after unifying China, the Yellow Emperor, being dissatisfied with the &quot;rope knot tying&quot; method of recording information, charged Cangjie with the task of creating characters for writing. Cangjie then settled down on the bank of a river, and devoted himself to the completion of the task at hand. Even after devoting much time and effort, however, he was unable to create even one character. One day, Cangjie suddenly saw a phoenix flying in the sky above, carrying an object in its beak. The object fell to the ground directly in front of Cangjie, and he saw it to be an impression of a hoof-print. Not being able to recognize which animal the print belonged to, he asked for the help of a local hunter passing by on the road. The hunter told him that this was, without a doubt, the hoof print of a Pixiu, being different from the hoof-print of any other beast that was alive.

His conversation with the hunter greatly inspired Cangjie, leading him to believe that if he could capture in a drawing the special characteristics that set apart each and every thing on the earth, this would truly be the perfect kind of character for writing. From that day forward, Cangjie paid close attention to the characteristics of all things, including the sun, moon, stars, clouds, lakes, rivers, oceans, as well as all manner of bird and beast. He began to create characters according to the special characteristics he found, and before long, had compiled a long list of characters for writing.

To the delight of the Yellow Emperor, Cangjie presented him with the complete set of characters. The emperor then called the premiers of each of the nine provinces together in order for Cangjie to teach them this new writing system. Monuments and temples were erected in Cangjie&#x27;s honor on the bank of the river where he created these characters.

Another version of the legend tells that Cangjie was inspired by observing the network of veins on a turtle. This version is particularly interesting relative to archaeology because turtle shells are one of the most common media on which the earliest known Chinese inscriptions are found, including the Jiahu symbols.

== Remains and commemorations ==
There are tombs dedicated to Cangjie in the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Shaanxi. His descendants are said to bear the surname Shǐ (史), in recognition of his service as official historiographer.

In Taiwan, Cangjie is often enshrined as a deity in special pagodas dedicated to the burning of papers with written character, known as Xi Zi Pagoda (惜字塔).

<text>Pyotr Ananyevich Krasikov (; 17 October O.S. 5 October] 1870 – 20 August 1939) was a Russian revolutionary and Soviet statesman, as well as a jurist and writer on political and religious affairs. He was the first Procurator General of the Soviet Union, serving from 1924 to 1933.

== Career ==

Pyotr Krasikov was born in Krasnoyarsk, where he was brought up from the age of 12 by his grandfather, an Archpriest, after the early death of his father, a lawyer. He was expelled from the Krasnoyarsk gymnasium for bad behaviour, but reinstated after his grandfather intervened.

In the years 1892–1893, Krasikov visited Switzerland and met with Russian Marxists, met with the leaders of the &quot;Emancipation of Labor&quot; group of Georgy Plekhanov, Pavel Axelrod and Vera Zasulich and joined Emancipation of Labour group in 1892. After returning home in 1894, he was arrested and kept in a solitary confinement cell in the Peter and Paul Fortress until he was bailed out by his sister, and ordered to return to Krasnoyarsk under police supervision. In 1895 despite the police supervision, Krasikov managed to create the first Marxist circle in Krasnoyarsk among students of the paramedic and midwife school.

In 1897 Lenin passed through Krasnoyarsk on his way into exile in a Siberian village, and met Krasikov and became close to each other.

Together with Lenin, he took part in meetings with political exiles who lived in Krasnoyarsk or who stopped here in transit. He saw Lenin&#x27;s comrades in the Petersburg Union of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. And after their departure, he met many party exiles and helped them.

For correspondence and communication with political exiles Krasikov was extended the period of public supervision of the police for another year. He later choose Pskov as his residing place and joined the local Iskra-ist. He was involved in the illegal transportation of Iskra from Germany to Russia. He was on trial in Germany, where Karl Liebknecht defended him. He was convicted but again released on bail.

Later he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party In November 1902, he was a member of the committee set up to organise the II Congress of the RSDLP, and together with Lenin and Plekhanov, he was a member of the Bureau of the Congress. When the split occurred during the Congress between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Krasikov joined the Bolsheviks, and stayed in Switzerland to help Lenin create a separate the Bolshevik organisation.

Krasikov returned to Russia during the 1905 Revolution, and was in charge of the agitation department of the Petersburg Party Committee. At the III Congress of the RSDLP he was a delegate with an advisory voice. After the revolution had been suppressed, he drifted out of revolutionary politics to practise as a lawyer

After the 1917 Russian Revolution his positions were related to legal issues and he is considered to be among the principal creators of the Soviet legal system, along with Andrey Vyshinsky. He was Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar of Justice from 1918. He was the initiator of the first Soviet anti-religious publication, &quot;Revolution and Church&quot;. Krasikov was Prosecutor General of the Supreme Court from 1924, and Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Court from 1933 to 1938. He was removed from his seat on the Supreme Court during the Great Purge &quot;without explanation.&quot;

Krasikov died in 1939 in the city of Zheleznovodsk, where he was being treated for his illness, and was buried there.

== Personality ==
Israel Getzler, in &quot;Martov: A Political Biography of a Russian Social Democrat&quot; (Cambridge U.P., 1967, p. 74), says he was &quot;intensely disliked by all and sundry [with the exception of Lenin]... [Boris Nikolaevsky] sums him up as a drunken brawler... J. Steinberg, &quot;Als ich Volkskommisar war&quot; (Munich, 1929), has devoted an entire chapter... to Krasikov&#x27;s misdeeds as co-chairman (together with the notorious M. Iu. Kozlovsky) of the Cheka of the Petrograd Soviet in the winter of 1917–18.&quot;

<text>In weaponry, a kill box is a three-dimensional target area, defined to facilitate the integration of coordinated joint weapons fire. The space is defined by an area reference system, but could follow terrain features, be located by grid coordinates or a radius from a center point.

== Definition ==
It is a joint forces coordination measure enabling air assets to engage surface targets without needing further coordination with commanders and without terminal attack control. Such a joint coordination measure can help commanders focus the effort of air and indirect fire assets, and also restrict the trajectories and effects of surface-to-surface fires. There may be no-fire areas (NFAs), restricted operations areas (ROAs), and airspace coordination areas (ACAs) included. No friendly ground forces should go into a kill box unless covered by a no-fire area.

A type of fire support coordinating measure (FSCM), a kill box is often defined by a grid reference system based on lines of latitude and longitude, upon a map of an area of operation. Each square of the grid may be sub-divided into smaller boxes, each of which may carry its own level of permission or restriction on the use of air-to-surface or surface-to-surface weapons.

First developed by the U.S. Air Force in the late 1980s, the technique gained notoriety through its use during the first Gulf War (1991). The U.S. Air Force further refined tactics, techniques, and procedures of kill box employment throughout the 1990s, leading to more efficient prosecution of targets. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, they were once again used in support of the initial invasion. 

Use of kill boxes is now part of Joint U.S. Doctrine and is used by many of the U.S.&#x27;s allies.

==Types==
* Blue: Permits air-to-surface fires in the Kill Box without further coordination or deconfliction with friendly forces.
* Purple: Reduces the coordination requirements for air-to-surface fires, while still allowing surface component commanders to employ surface-to-surface fire. It allows the maximum use of joint fires, creating a synergistic effect and maximum potential for neutralizing enemy forces.

==Misconceptions==
While engagement authority is automatically granted by the establishment of a kill box, it does not relieve weapons system operators of the responsibility for complying with requirements such as commander&#x27;s designated target priority, positive identification (PID), collateral damage assessments, rules of engagement (ROE), and special instructions (SPINS).

<text>General Sir Douglas David Gracey, (3 September 1894 – 5 June 1964) was a British Indian Army officer who fought in both the First and Second World Wars. He also fought in French Indochina and was the second Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army. Gracey held this latter office from 11 February 1948 until his retirement on 16 January 1951. Born to English parents living in India, he was educated in English schools before returning to India to serve in the military there.

==Early life and military career==
Born to English parents living in India, Gracey was educated in English schools before returning to India to serve in the military there. Gracey&#x27;s initial education was at Blundell&#x27;s School before moving on to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, from where he was commissioned into the Unattached List, Indian Army on 15 August 1914 as a second lieutenant. By early 1915 he had been attached to the 5th Extra Reserve Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers. He served in France from 11 January to 2 May 1915 when he was wounded.

In September 1915, Gracey was appointed from the unattached list of the Indian Army into the 1st King George&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment) with the rank of second lieutenant. With his Indian Army regiment he saw active service in Mesopotamia and Palestine and was awarded the Military Cross (MC) in 1917 and a Bar to the award in 1919.
The citation to his first MC read:

As is often the case in wartime he held postings at various times with more senior acting rank, but was formally promoted lieutenant in August 1917 and captain with effect from August 1918.

==Between the wars==
Between the wars Gracey became an instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1925, commanding one of the cadet companies. After this he attended the Staff College, Quetta, from 1928 to 1929, and his fellow students included Colin Gubbins, John Crocker, Eric Goddard, Lionel Cox, and Henry Davies, among many others, who were destined to achieve general officer rank. In peacetime, promotion came slowly and brevet ranks were used as an interim step to the next rank up for officers who performed well. In 1930, Gracey received a promotion to brevet major. In late 1931 he was appointed as GSO2 at GHQ India and by the time this appointment finished in late 1935 he had received his promotion to major. In early 1937 he was given another GSO2 posting at Western Command in India. Having waited so long to be raised from captain to major, his next advancements to brevet lieutenant-colonel and lieutenant-colonel came quite quickly, in January 1938 and February 1939.

==Second World War==
At the start of the Second World War in September 1939, Gracey was commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles on the North West Frontier of India. In March 1940, upon his promotion to full colonel, he became assistant commandant of the Staff College, Quetta, with the Commandant then being Philip Christison, a British Army officer. In May 1941 he was promoted brigadier and given command of the 17th Indian Infantry Brigade which, as part of the 8th Indian Infantry Division, was sent shortly thereafter to Basra in Iraq but took no significant part in the Anglo-Iraqi War. In June 1941 the brigade was ordered to northwest Iraq to the &quot;Bec du Canard&quot; region in northeast Syria, part of the Syria-Lebanon campaign. After this Gracey and his brigade remained in Iraq as part of Iraqforce (subsequently &quot;Paiforce&quot;), protecting the Middle East from a possible Axis thrust south of the Caucasus. For his service, Gracey was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)

In April 1942 Gracey was promoted to acting major-general and given the task of forming and then commanding the Indian 20th Infantry Division. The division concentrated in Ceylon for training and in August 1943 was sent to join Fourteenth Army&#x27;s Indian XV Corps in northeast India to take part in the Burma campaign.

Shortly thereafter the division was moved to IV Corps based at Imphal on the India-Burma border. From early April to late July 1944 the division was in almost constant combat during the Battle of Imphal, latterly as part of Indian XXXIII Corps. There was then a four-month period of rest and recuperation before the division was back in the front line with XXXIII Corps which launched an attack across the Chindwin river in December and thrust south. In February 1945 the division created a bridgehead across the Irrawaddy and broke out in mid-March to cut the Japanese communications and supplies to the battles being fought at Mandalay and Meiktila. The Fourteenth Army commander Lieutenant General &quot;Bill&quot; Slim was later to write about this action:
Driving rapidly south the division captured Prome on 2 May, by which time the campaign was effectively over.

In February 1945 Gracey had been appointed a Commander of the order of the British Empire (CBE) for &quot;gallant and distinguished services in Burma and on the Eastern Frontier of India&quot; and in May his rank of major-general was made permanent. In July 1945, Gracey was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB), and he was mentioned in despatches. There were further mentions in despatches for services in Burma in September 1945 and May 1946.

Because of Gracey&#x27;s close relationship with his men, afforded by his long service as commander, the 20th Division had a reputation as a happy and confident unit. Field Marshal Slim said of them:

==Indochina==

In September 1945, Gracey led 20,000 troops of the 20th Indian Division to occupy Saigon. During the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, the Allies had agreed on Britain taking control of Vietnam south of the 16th parallel (then part of French Indochina) from the Japanese occupiers. Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the communist Viet Minh, proclaimed Vietnamese independence from French rule and big pro-independence and anti-French demonstrations and strikes were held in Saigon. The French, anxious to retain their colony, persuaded Gracey&#x27;s Commander in Chief, Lord Mountbatten, to authorise Gracey to declare martial law. Fearing a communist takeover of Vietnam, Gracey decided to rearm French citizens who had remained in Saigon and allowed them to seize control of public buildings from the Viet Minh. In October 1945, as fighting spread throughout the city, Gracey issued guns to the Japanese troops who had surrendered and used them to occupy the city. According to some socialist and communist commentaries, this controversial decision furthered Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s cause of liberating Vietnam from foreign rule and precipitated the First Indochina War. Other authors such as Peter Dunn and Timothy Smith reach a different, more sympathetic conclusion – that his orders were essentially to maintain essential services and prevent the slaughter of the civilian population. Marston reviews the military position Gracey found himself in. French General Leclerc arrived in Saigon in October 1945 to assume authority but it was not until well into the first half of 1946 that enough French troops had arrived to allow Gracey to return with the bulk of his troops in March 1946 to India where the 20th Indian Division was disbanded.

==After Second World War==
Promoted acting lieutenant-general in May 1946, Gracey successively commanded Northern Command and Indian I Corps in India. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in January 1948 and served in the honorary capacity of Colonel Commandant of the Indian Signal Corps between March 1946 and October 1948.

==Pakistan==
When British India was partitioned in 1947 Gracey became Chief of Staff in the newly created GHQ, Pakistan before succeeding Frank Messervy as the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army in 1948.

When the Pakistani tribal invasion of Kashmir began on 22 October 1947, Messervy was away in London, and Gracey was acting as the Army Chief. He declined to send Pakistani troops to the Kashmir front as ordered by Mohammad Ali Jinnah (the Governor General) but referred the issue to Claude Auchinleck, the Supreme Commander of Indian and Pakistani forces. Both the armies were under joint British command at this stage, and Auchinleck had already issued Standdown instructions to the effect that all British officers would stand down in the event of a military conflict between the two countries. After hearing Auchinleck&#x27;s reasoning, Jinnah rescinded his order.

Gracey left the Pakistan Army in April 1951 to retire, having attained the rank of full general. However, his permanent rank in the British Army had never advanced beyond major general so on retirement he was granted the honorary rank of general, having also been advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in January 1951 at the request of the Pakistan government.

==Final years==
After his retirement Gracey settled in Surrey. He was a keen cricketer and a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and served as Chairman of the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables at Putney in the years before his death, which occurred on 5 June 1964, at the age of 69.

<doc id="1237214" wikidata="Q3194192" url="?curid=1237214" title="Jimmy Boyd">
<text>Jimmy Devon Boyd (Born James Devon Boyd, January 9, 1939 – March 7, 2009) was an American singer, musician, and actor known for his 1952 recording of the song &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus.&quot;

==Early years==
Jimmy Boyd was born in 1939 in Mississippi into a musical family, with father Leslie Boyd and mother Winnie Boyd. His father, in turn, was from a family of 21 children of musician Bill Boyd. The family relocated to the San Fernando Valley of Southern California when Jimmy was a pre-schooler. Jimmy briefly sang with &quot;Texas Jim Lewis and his Lonestar Cowboys&quot;. At an early age, he won a local talent show that led to television appearances, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, as well as &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot; on CBS-TV.

==&quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot;==
Boyd recorded the song &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; for Columbia Records in 1952, when he was 13 years old. It became a hit, selling over two and a half million records in its first week&#x27;s release and Boyd&#x27;s name became known internationally. Boyd was presented with two gold records. Boyd&#x27;s record went to number one on the charts again the following year at Christmas, and continues to sell as a Christmas song. Cumulative disc sales by 1966 amounted to over 11 million copies.

Boyd owned horses, so Columbia presented him with a silver mounted saddle. Inscribed in the silver plate on the back of the saddle were the words, &quot;Presented by Columbia Records to Jimmy Boyd commemorating his 3,000,000 record of &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot;&quot;. When first released, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston condemned the song for implying even a tenuous link between sex and the religious holiday, and radio stations in several markets banned it. 
Boyd made worldwide news when he went to Boston to explain that, of course, Santa Claus and Daddy were the same man. The following Christmas the ban was lifted.

==Other recordings==
Boyd&#x27;s next-biggest hit was &quot;Tell Me a Story,&quot; a duet with Frankie Laine, which peaked at number 4 on the charts during 1953.
The same year, he recorded &quot;Dennis the Menace,&quot; a duet with Rosemary Clooney, which peaked at number 23 on the charts.

One of his surviving performances available online is with Betty White on &quot;The Betty White Show&quot; in the mid-1950s.

==Acting career==
In 1956, Boyd played Huckleberry Finn in the United States Steel Hour production of Frank Luther&#x27;s musical adaptation of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;. Boyd reprised the role a year later when Luther adapted &quot;Huck Finn&quot; as a musical. 

Boyd was a regular cast member on the situation comedy &quot;Date with the Angels&quot;, starring Betty White, playing the role of Wheeler. After the show was cancelled midway through its only season (1957–58), he went on to become a regular on &quot;Bachelor Father&quot; for the remainder of its five-year run (1957–62). The popular situation comedy starred John Forsythe and featured Noreen Corcoran and Sammee Tong. Boyd played the role of Howard Meechum, awkward classmate and sometime boyfriend of Corcoran&#x27;s character Kelly.

During the same period, Boyd appeared in several films, often in dramatic roles. These included the role of schoolboy Howard in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1960), a drama starring Spencer Tracy, based on the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925.

Boyd&#x27;s acting career was interrupted by military service when he was drafted into the US Army in 1960. Later in the 1960s, he went to Vietnam, but as a celebrity rather than a soldier, appearing alongside other actors and singers in two USO tours.

==Personal life and death==
In 1960, Boyd married actress Yvonne Craig (later TV&#x27;s &quot;Batgirl&quot;). The marriage ended in divorce in 1962. Boyd married a second time in 1980 to Anne Forrey. They had a son together, but divorced in 1984. He remained single for the rest of his life. 

Jimmy Boyd died of cancer in 2009 at the age of 70.

==Awards==
For his contributions to the recording industry, Boyd was awarded a star (located at 7021 Hollywood Blvd.) on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1959. It made Boyd (at age 20) the youngest-ever recipient of the honor for 45 years, until actress twins Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen (then 18) jointly received a star in 2004.

<text>General Sir Frank Walter Messervy, (9 December 1893 – 2 February 1974) was a British Indian Army officer in the First and Second World Wars. Following its independence, he was the first commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Army from August 1947 to February 1948. Previously, he had served as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Northern Command, India in 1946 and 1947.

==Early life==
Messervy was born in Trinidad on 9 December 1893, the oldest child of Walter John Messervy (born in Jersey in the English Channel), a bank manager in the colony (and later England) and his wife Myra Naida de Boissiere from Trinidad.

==Early career==
Sent to England from Trinidad, Messervy was initially educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned into the Indian Army in January 1913 and in 1914 joined 9th Hodson&#x27;s Horse. which later became part of the 4th Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own Hodson&#x27;s Horse. He would see action in the First World War in France, Palestine and Syria from 1914 to 1918. He later served in Kurdistan in 1919.

After attending the Staff College, Camberley, from 1925 to 1926, Messervy was appointed as an instructor at the Staff College, Quetta from 1932 to 1936, where Bernard Montgomery was among his fellow instructors. He was made commanding officer of the 13th Duke of Connaught&#x27;s&#x27;s Own Lancers, then in British India, during 1938 and 1939.

==Second World War==
===East Africa===
In September 1939, Messervy was promoted to colonel and became a General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of the 5th Indian Infantry Division, which was about to be formed at Secunderabad. In mid-1940, the division was sent to the Sudan to counter the threat from the Italian forces based in Italian East Africa. Messervy was appointed commander of &quot;Gazelle Force&quot;. Created on 16 October 1940, it was a mobile reconnaissance and strike formation of expanded battalion size created from elements of 5th Indian Division. During the ensuing East African campaign, Messervy commanded &quot;Gazelle Force&quot; with notable success, latterly attached to the Indian 4th Infantry Division. By 13 February 1941, the campaign had become static and Messervy&#x27;s formation was disbanded.

In early March 1941, Messervy was promoted acting brigadier to command the Indian 5th Infantry Division&#x27;s 9th Indian Infantry Brigade and played a significant role in the third Battle of Keren during the second half of March 1941. His promotion was in part related to his actions during the advance from Kassala through Agordat to the early fighting at Keren during February.

When Major-General Noel Beresford-Peirse, then commander of the 4th Indian Infantry Division, was promoted to command XIII Corps in North Africa Messervy, a brigadier for only six weeks, was appointed to take his place. He was promoted to the acting rank of major general as a result of his new appointment.

===Western Desert – North Africa===
Messervy took his division to North Africa in April 1941, taking part in Operation Battleaxe in June. During Operation Crusader in November that year, 4th Indian Division, dug in on the Egypt–Libya border, played a key role in repelling Rommel&#x27;s tanks after they had defeated the British armour at Sidi Rezegh. The division&#x27;s battle groups took part in the Eighth Army&#x27;s pursuit when Rommel withdrew from his defensive positions at Gazala in December, ending the year at Benghazi.

In early January 1942 Messervy had received orders to depart for India where he would assume command of the 31st Indian Armoured Division. He was instead appointed to replace Major General Herbert Lumsden, the wounded commander of the 1st Armoured Division which had recently arrived in the desert. During Rommel&#x27;s attack from El Agheila in late January 1942, the division was outmatched by the Axis armour and heavily defeated. Upon Lumsden&#x27;s return in March, Messervy was moved to command the 7th Armoured Division (&quot;The Desert Rats&quot;) which had just lost its newly appointed commander, Major General Jock Campbell, who had been killed in a motor accident, shortly after being awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). This made Messervy the only Indian Army officer to command a British Army division during the Second World War.

When division HQ was overrun by the Germans at the start of the Battle of Gazala, Messervy was captured on 27 May 1942; but, removing all insignia, managed to bluff the Germans into believing he was a batman and escaped with other members of his staff to rejoin division HQ the following day.

Messervy knew little about tanks and was not considered a great success commanding armoured divisions by his superiors. He was dismissed from command of 7th Armoured Division by Eighth Army commander Neil Ritchie in late June 1942 following the severe defeat the division had sustained at the Battle of Gazala. He transferred to Cairo as Deputy Chief of General Staff, GHQ Middle East Command 1942 and was sent to India a few months later to raise 43rd Indian Armoured Division as its commander. Originally intended for service in Persia, the division was disbanded in April 1943 when the threat to Persia was removed by the Soviet victory at Stalingrad.

===India and Burma===

Much to his horror, Messervy was then made Director of Armoured Fighting Vehicles, General Headquarters, India, in 1943, where he argued successfully against the then prevailing view that anything other than light tanks could not be used in Burma. This was to have a significant impact in the next two years when medium tanks were used to telling effect against the Japanese.

In July 1943, Messervy was appointed GOC of the 7th Indian Infantry Division, in succession to Major-General Thomas Corbett, which, although an improvement above his old position, was not initially greeted with much enthusiasm by the division&#x27;s officers, who all admired Corbett.

The division had been created some three years before Messervy&#x27;s assumption of command and originally contained many professional soldiers in its ranks. However, many of these men had been, in the usage of the day, &quot;milked&quot; to help create other new units then being formed in the huge expansion of the Indian Army, with the situation being so severe that the division had at one point resembled a training formation rather than a combat division. This all changed in the summer of 1942 when serious training began to take place and which started to absorb the many lessons learned from fighting in the jungle and the Japanese. This would serve the division well when it did enter combat the following year.

The division was sent to the Arakan in Burma to join XV Corps in September. In the Japanese offensive in February 1944, despite having his headquarters overrun and scattered and his supply lines compromised, Messervy&#x27;s brigades conducted a successful defence whilst being supplied by air (Battle of the Admin Box). After going on the attack in late February, 7th Indian Division was relieved in mid-March.

In March 1944, Messervy lost two brigades sent to reinforce the hard-pressed defences at Imphal and Kohima in India. By May, the whole division was back in the front line in the Kohima sector, fighting a key five-day battle at the Naga Village. It then advanced towards the Chindwin river, combining with Indian 20th Infantry Division to inflict a heavy defeat on the Japanese at Ukhrul.

In December 1944, Messervy was appointed to command IV Corps, which he led in the 1945 offensive during which, he captured the key communications centre at Meiktila in Burma and advanced to Rangoon between February and April. When Messervy returned from home leave hostilities had ceased. He was made Commander-in-Chief Malaya Command in 1945 after the Japanese surrender.

==Pakistan and Kashmir==
Close to the Partition of India, Messervy was made General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Northern Command, India from 1946 to 1947. Finally when Pakistan came into being on 15 August 1947, he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army.

On 20 August, a letter signed by Messervy went out to all the brigade headquarters in northwest Pakistan, attaching plans for a certain Operation Gulmarg. According to the plan, 20 lashkars of Pashtun tribesmen were to be armed and trained in various brigade locations in northwest Pakistan for an armed invasion of Kashmir. The information leaked out, one of the letters having fallen into the hands of an Indian officer Major Onkar Singh Kalkat. Kalkat was put under house arrest, but he escaped and made his way to India. By the D-day of 22 October, when the attack was launched, Messervy was away in London, leaving General Douglas Gracey, the Chief of General Staff, as the Acting Commander-in-Chief
On his return, he stopped in Delhi, where Lord Mountbatten made him swear that he had not been asked for, nor had he provided, any help to the tribesmen. But within a week he was found providing arms and ammunition to the Pakistani invading forces. He complained to Governor George Cunningham of the NWFP that Mountbatten had gone over to the side of the &quot;Hindus&quot;.

Pakistani officers narrate that both Messervy and Gracey were involved in running the day-to-day operations of Pakistan&#x27;s Kashmir War. Officers were loaned out for commanding the rebel forces and shown on records as being absent. Nevertheless, Messervy issued a statement on 12 November 1947, denying that any &quot;serving Pakistan Army officers are directing operations in Kashmir&quot;, which was cited by Pakistan in the UN Security Council debates as proof of Pakistan&#x27;s innocence.

Messervy was relieved of his post on 15 February 1948, leading to his retirement on 22 August that year. He was granted the honorary rank of general.
Later, he wrote an influential article on Kashmir in the &quot;Asiatic Review&quot;, where he alleged that India had planned to militarily intervene in Kashmir several weeks before the event.
He opined that if the pro-India National Conference party was allowed to hold power in Kashmir, India would likely win a plebiscite, but if Pakistan was allowed to hold on to the areas that it had captured, a Pakistan win was &#x27;even more certain&#x27;. He had &#x27;few doubts&#x27; as to which dominion most people of Kashmir would choose. Historian Gowher Rizvi states that influences of this kind persuaded the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs Philip Noel-Baker to ensure that Pakistan&#x27;s viewpoint was &quot;not ignored&quot; in the UN Security Council.

Messervy died at home in the small village of Heyshott, in the south of England, on 2 February 1974.

==Family==
In 1927 Messervy married Patricia Waldegrave Courtney daughter of Lt Col Edward Arthur Waldegrave Courtney. They had a daughter and two sons.

<text>The 1966 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 35th term. It saw the governing National Party win a third consecutive term in office. 

It was also the first time since the 1943 election that a minor party (Social Credit Party) won a seat in Parliament.

==Background==
The National Party had established its second administration following the 1960 elections, and had been re-elected in the 1963 election. Keith Holyoake remained Prime Minister. The Labour Party experienced a leadership change shortly before the 1966 elections: Arnold Nordmeyer, who was closely associated with an unpopular previous Labour government, was replaced by the younger Norman Kirk. Labour remained disunited, however, with ongoing leadership problems undermining Kirk&#x27;s position. Disagreement between unionists and non-unionists regarding economic policy also weakened the party.

One significant issue that divided National and Labour in the 1966 elections was the question of New Zealand&#x27;s participation in the Vietnam War. Under National, New Zealand contributed a small number of troops, which Holyoake strongly defended during the election campaign. Labour, by contrast, made the recall of troops one of its key policies; former Labour leader Walter Nash was a particularly strong critic of the war. Nash believed that Labour&#x27;s failure to win the election was because of its principled anti-Vietnam war policy, despite voters preferring Labour&#x27;s economic policy to National&#x27;s.

===MPs retiring in 1966===
Eight National MPs and two Labour MPs intended to retire at the end of the 34th Parliament.

==The election==

The date for the main 1966 elections was 26 November. 1,409,600 people were registered to vote. Turnout was 86.0%, a number relatively low for the time. The number of seats being contested was 80, a number which had been fixed since 1902. It was, however, the last election in which the number of seats was set at this level.

==Election results==

===Party standings===
The 1966 election saw the governing National Party retain office by an eight-seat margin. It had previously held office by a ten-seat margin — the drop was a result of losing the Hobson seat to Social Credit&#x27;s Vernon Cracknell. National won a total of forty-four seats, while the Labour Party remained static on thirty-five. In the popular vote, the parties were closer — National won 43.6% to Labour&#x27;s 41.4%. The Social Credit Party won 14.5% of the vote and one seat.

<doc id="1237244" wikidata="Q1076115" url="?curid=1237244" title="Kolo (dance)">
<text>Kolo () is a South Slavic circle dance, found under this name in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. It is inscribed on the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage for Serbia. Hungarian communities were also influenced by the tradition, where a similar dance is known as &quot;Kalala.&quot;

== Description ==
The circle dance is usually performed amongst groups of at least three people and up to several dozen people. Dancers hold each other&#x27;s hands or each other&#x27;s waists. They form a circle, a single chain or multiple parallel lines.

Kolo requires almost no movement above the waist. The basic steps are easy to learn. Experienced dancers demonstrate virtuosity by adding different ornamental elements, such as syncopated steps. Each region has at least one unique kolo. It is difficult to master the dance and even most experienced dancers cannot master all of them.

Kolo is performed at weddings, social, cultural, and religious ceremonies. Some dances require both men and women to dance together, others require only the men or only the women. 

=== Music ===
The music is generally fast-paced. The dance was used by Antonín Dvořák in his &quot;Slavonic Dances&quot; – the Serbian kolo is the seventh dance from opus 72.

== Traditional dance costume ==
Traditional dance costumes vary from region to region. Bordering regions are mostly more similar to each other.

Various kolos are performed at social ceremonies. Often traditional clothing, which is unique to a region, is worn. The most common kolo is the &quot;narodno kolo&quot; or &quot;drmeš&quot;; a standard step followed by accordion music.

==Other South Slavic circle dances==

Elsewhere in South Slavic countries, there is horo () in Bulgaria and oro () in North Macedonia and Montenegro.

<doc id="1237259" wikidata="Q3647714" url="?curid=1237259" title="Seventh son of a seventh son">
<text>The seventh son of a seventh son is a concept from folklore regarding special powers given to, or held by, such a son. To qualify as &quot;the seventh son of a seventh son&quot; one must be the seventh male child born in an unbroken line with no female siblings born between, and to a father who himself is the seventh male child born in an unbroken line with no female siblings born between. The number has a long history of mystical and biblical significance, such as seven virtues, seven deadly sins, Seven Sleepers and Seven Heavens.

In some beliefs, the special powers are inborn, inherited simply by virtue of his birth order; in others, the powers are granted to him by God or the gods because of his birth order.

In many cases seventh sons (who are not born to a seventh son) are also said to have supernatural or healing abilities.

In Lancashire and particularly in Blackburn there was, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a tradition of calling seventh sons of seventh sons (and seventh sons) &#x27;Doctor&#x27; (forename) because of their supposed abilities as healers.

===Ireland===
The seventh son of a seventh son is gifted as a healer. The seventh son of a seventh son is part of a more general phenomenon known as the &quot;cure&quot; (sometimes also called the &quot;charm&quot;). Belief in the efficacy of seventh son healers and other folklore related to healing persisted to the 20th century in parts of Ireland.

===Italy===
In a legend of Montenero di Bisaccia, &quot;Ciarallo&quot; was a seventh son who had the power to enchant and recall snakes, and who was immune to snake venom. Ciarallo was not only a seventh son, but underwent a special initiation rite called &quot;inciaramazione&quot;. Customarily, one would ask Ciarallo&#x27;s intercession when a snake was discovered in the house. Ciarallo would answer these requests by attracting the snake with a whistle. He would also perform the &quot;inciaramazione&quot; rite on other people to ensure protection from snakes by spreading a special oil on their arm. Children were led to Ciarallo by their mothers to get protection.

===Latin America===
In some Latin American countries, the seventh son of a seventh son is believed to be cursed to be a werewolf, , (in Paraguay) or (the Portuguese word for &quot;werewolf&quot;). To prevent this, the newborn should be baptized in seven different churches. Alternately, he may be baptized under the name &quot;Benito&quot;, with his eldest brother (the eldest son of their father) as his godfather. The local myth of the is not connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina to &quot;legitimately married parents of good conduct and moral character&quot; is eligible to become godchild to the president.

=== Romania ===
Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu describe the Transylvanian folk belief that &quot;the seventh son of a seventh son is doomed to become a vampire.&quot;

===United States===
According to Edward Augustus Kendall in &quot;Travels through the Northern Parts of the United States, in the year 1807–1808&quot;, while he visited the Newgate copper mine and prison, he met an innkeeper who told him that &quot;there was to be found in the surrounding hills, a black stone, of a certain species, through which a seventh son of a seventh son, born in the month of February, with a caul on his head, can discern everything that lies in the depths and interior of the globe.&quot; The author speculated that the importance of mining to the community gave rise to the localized belief.

<text>Marathi literature is the body of literature of Marathi, an Indo-Aryan language spoken mainly in the Indian state of Maharashtra and written in the Devanagari and Modi script.

==History==
=== Early history ===

As a written language, Marathi is probably first attested in a 739 CE copper-plate inscription found in Satara. Several inscriptions dated to the second half of the 11th century feature Marathi, which is usually appended to Sanskrit or Kannada in these inscriptions.

The earliest Marathi-only inscriptions are the ones issued during the Shilahara rule, including a c. 1012 CE stone inscription from Akshi taluka of Raigad district, and a 1060 or 1086 CE copper-plate inscription from Dive that records a land grant (agrahara) to a Brahmin. A 2-line 1118 CE Marathi inscription at Shravanabelagola records a grant by the Hoysalas. These inscriptions suggest that Marathi was a standard written language by the 12th century. However, there is no record of any actual literature produced in Marathi until the late 13th century.

=== Yadava period ===

Epigraphic evidence suggests that Marathi was a standard written language by the 12th century. However, the earliest records of actual literature in Marathi appear only in the late 13th century. The early Marathi literature emerged during the Seuna (Yadava) rule, because of which some scholars have theorized that it was produced with support from the Yadava rulers. The Yadavas did regard Marathi as a significant language for connecting with the general public, and Marathi replaced Kannada and Sanskrit as the dominant language of the inscriptions during the last half century of the Yadava rule. However, there is no evidence that the Yadava royal court directly supported the production of Marathi literature with state funds.

The early Marathi literature was mostly religious and philosophical in nature, and was composed by the saint-poets belonging to Mahanubhava and Warkari sects. During the reign of the last three Yadava kings, a great deal of literature in verse and prose, on astrology, medicine, Puranas, Vedanta, kings and courtiers were created. &quot;Nalopakhyana&quot;, &quot;Rukminiswayamvara&quot; and Shripati&#x27;s &quot;Jyotisharatnamala&quot; (1039) are a few examples.

Bhaskarabhatta Borikar of the Mahanubhava sect is the first known poet to have composed hymns in Marathi.

Dnyaneshwar (1275–1296) was the first Marathi literary figure who had wide readership and profound influence. His major works are &quot;Amrutanubhav&quot; and &quot;Bhavarth Deepika&quot; (popularly known as &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot;). &quot;Bhavarth Deepika&quot; is a 9000-couplets long commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.

Namdev, the Bhakti saint and contemporary of Dnyaneshwar is the other significant literary figure from this era. Namdev composed religious songs in Marathi as well as Hindi; some of his Hindi compositions are included in the Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib.

Another early Marathi writer was Mukundaraja, who wrote &quot;Vivekasindhu&quot; and &quot;Paramamrita&quot;. Both the works deal with the Advaita philosophy. Some earlier scholars dated him to the 12th century, and considered &quot;Vivekasindhu&quot; as the first literary book in Marathi, dating it to 1188. However, most linguistic historians now date Mukundaraja to 14th century or later: the &quot;Vivekasindhu&quot; was likely written after &quot;Lilacharita&quot; and &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot;.

=== Deccan Sultanates period ===

There was relatively little activity in Marathi in the early days of the Bahmani Sultanate (1347–1527) and the Bijapur Sultanate (1527–1686). The Warkari saint-poet Eknath (1533–1599), the main successor of Dnyaneshwar, was a major Marathi literary figure during this period. He made available an authentic, edited version of Dnyaneshwari, which had been forgotten after the Islamic invasion of Deccan. He also wrote several abhangs (devotional poems), narratives and minor works that dealt with the Bhagavata Purana He wrote &quot;Eknathi Bhagwat&quot;, &quot;Bhavarth Ramayan&quot;, &quot;Rukmini Swayamwar Hastamalak&quot;, and &quot;Bharud&quot;. Dasopant was another minor but notable poet from this era. Mukteshwar (1574-1645), the grandson of Eknath, too, wrote several works in Marathi including a translation of the epic Mahabharata.

&quot;Krista Purana&quot;, written by the Goa-based Christian missionary Thomas Stephens, was first published in 1616. It is written in a mix of Marathi and Konkani languages, and the first copy was printed in the Roman script, and tells the story of Jesus Christ.

=== Maratha period ===
The Marathas, the Marathi-speaking natives, formed their own kingdom under the leadership of Shivaji Maharaj in the 17th century. The development of the Marathi literature accelerated during this period. Tukaram and Samarth Ramdas, who were contemporaries of Shivaji, were the well-known poets of the early Maratha period. Tukaram (1608–1650) was the most prominent Marathi Varkari spiritual poet identified with the Bhakti movement, and had a great influence on the later Maratha society. His contemporary, Samarth Ramdas composed &quot;Dasbodh&quot; and &quot;Manache Shlok&quot; in Marathi.

In the 18th century, several well-known works like Yatharthadeepika (by Vaman Pandit), &quot;Naladamayanti Swayamvara&quot; (by Raghunath Pandit), &quot;Pandava Pratap&quot;, &quot;Harivijay&quot;, &quot;Ramvijay&quot; (by Shridhar Pandit) and &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (translation by Moropant) were produced. The historical section of the old Marathi literature contained the Bakhars and the &quot;Katava&quot;s. Krishna Dayarnava and Sridhar were other leading poets during the Peshwa rule. Mahipati, the author who wrote the biographies of the Bhakti Saints also belonged to this era.
=== British Period ===

The British colonial period saw standardisation of Marathi grammar through the efforts of the Christian missionary William Carey. Carey&#x27;s dictionary had fewer entries and Marathi words were in Devanagari script instead of the Modi script prevalent at that time. Carey also translated the new and old testament of the bible into Marathi in 1811 and 1820 respectively. The most comprehensive Marathi-English dictionaries was compiled by Captain James Thomas Molesworth and Major Thomas Candy in 1831. The book is still in print nearly two centuries after its publication.
The colonial authorities also worked on standardizing Marathi under the leadership of Molesworth. They used Brahmins of Pune for this task and adopted the Sanskrit dominated dialect spoken by this caste in the city as the standard dialect for Marathi.
The Christian missionaries introduced the Western forms to the Marathi literature. 
Marathi at this time was efficiently aided by Marathi Drama. Here, there also was a different genre called &#x27;Sangit Natya&#x27; or Musicals. The first play was V.A. Bhave&#x27;s Sita Swayamvar in 1843. Later Kirloskar (1843–85) and G.B. Deval (1854-1916) brought a romantic aroma and social content. But Krishnaji Prabhakar Khadilkar (1872-1948) with his banned play Kichaka-Vadh (1910) set the trend of political playwriting. These were followed by stalwarts like Ram Ganesh Gadkari, Prahlad Keshav Atre. The plays based on historical events linked with Maratha Empire begin with Bashir Momin Kavathekar&#x27;s popular drama&#x27;s &#x27;Bhangale Swapna Maharashtra&#x27; &amp; &#x27;Vedat Marathe Veer Daudale Saat&#x27; which hit the theater in 1970s and then came epic &#x27;Janata Raja&#x27; from Babasaheb Purandare in 1980s.

The modern poets like Keshavsuta, Balakavi, Govindagraj, and the poets of Ravi Kiran Mandal (such as Madhav Julian) wrote poetry which was influenced by the Romantic and Victorian English poetry. It was largely sentimental and lyrical. Prahlad Keshav Atre, the renowned satirist and a politician wrote a parody of this sort of poetry in his collection &quot;Jhenduchi Phule&quot;.

Sane Guruji (1899–1950) contributed to the children&#x27;s literature in Marathi. His major works are &quot;Shyamchi Aai, &quot;AstikandGode Shevata&quot;.&quot; He translated and simplified many Western Classics and published them in a book of stories titled &quot;Gode Goshti (Sweet Stories).&quot;

=== Beginning of journalism ===

On January 6, 1832, Balshastri Jambhekar of the Elphinstone College began &quot;Darpan&quot;, the first Marathi-English fortnightly magazine.

On 24 October 1841, Govind Vithal Kunte began &quot;Prabhakar&quot;. Kunte was the first professional Marathi journalist. Prabhakar eulogised Indian art and culture. American missionaries started a Marathi magazine called Dnyanodaya in 1842 which denigrated Hindu religion but also had articles related to science and technology. The magazine is still in print today. &quot;Jnyan Prakash&quot; was started on 12 February 1849 in Pune. In its early years, It was edited by Krishnaraj Trimbak Ranade. It was published weekly till 1904, when it became a daily. It ceased publication in 1951.The journal advocated education and social reform. Hari Narayan Apte, a popular Marathi novelist also served as its editor. Some of its contributors included Mahadev Govind Ranade and Gopal Krishna Gokhale.In 1862, &quot;Induprakash&quot;, a bilingual journal, was founded in Bombay. It was edited by M.G. Ranade.It criticised orthodoxy in Hinduism and called for social reforms. In 1877, Jyotiba Phule and Krishnarao Bhaskar began &quot;Deenbandhu&quot;, as part of the Dalit upliftment movement. Deenabandhu was the organ of the Satyashodhak Samaj founded by Phule. Other notable early Marathi periodicals include &quot;Jaganmitra&quot; (from Ratnagiri), &quot;Shubh Suchak&quot; (from Satara), &quot;Vartaman Dipika&quot;, and &quot;Vartaman Sangrah&quot;.
On 4 January 1881, Bal Gangadhar Tilak began &quot;Kesari&quot;, along with Gopal Ganesh Agarkar. In 1887, Agarkar left to start &quot;sujeet Sudharak&quot; (bilingual) along with Gopal Krishna Gokhale. After Agarkar&#x27;s death in 1895, it ceased publication. In 1889, &quot;K. Navalkar&quot; started the weekly Vartahar to highlight atrocities committed by the ruling British and other Europeans. In 1890, Hari Narayan Apte began &quot;Karmanuk&quot;, a family entertainment paper. It contained articles on science. Also in 1890, Anandrao Ramachandra Dharandhar started &quot;Bhoot&quot; published every new and full moon day. It was the first Marathi paper to carry cartoons on political and social matters. It was very popular but ceased publication in 1904.

==Present times (1947- till now )==
Vishnu Sakharam Khandekar (1889–1976)&#x27;s &quot;Yayati&quot; won him the Jnanpith Award for 1975. He also wrote many other novels, short stories, essays etc. His major works are &quot;Don Dhruv&quot; (Two Poles), &quot;Ulka&quot; (Meteorite), &quot;Krounchavadh&quot;, &quot;Jalalela Mohar&quot;, &quot;Amrutvel&quot;.

Marathi drama flourished in the 1960s and 1970s, with literary figures like Vasant Kanetkar, Kusumagraj and Vijay Tendulkar.

The major paradigm shift in Marathi literature sensibilities began in the forties with the modernist poetry of B.S. Mardhekar. In the mid fifties, the little magazine movement gained momentum. It published writings which were non-conformist, radical and experimental. Dalit literary movement also gained strength due to the little magazine movement. This radical movement was influenced by the philosophy of Babasaheb Ambedkar and challenged the literary establishment which was largely middle class, urban, and upper caste people. The little magazine movement threw up many noted writers. Bhalchandra Nemade is a well-known novelist, critic and poet. Sharad Rane is a well-known child literary figure. The notable poets include Arun Kolatkar, Dilip Chitre, Namdeo Dhasal, Vasant Abaji Dahake and Manohar Oak. Bhau Padhye, Vilas Sarang, Shyam Manohar, Suhas Shirvalkar and Visharm Bedekar are well known fiction writers.

During this period, Maharshtra&#x27;s traditional form of theatre &#x27;Tamasha&#x27; saw rise of Bashir Momin Kavathekar, a prominent poet &amp; writer who wrote Lavani &amp; Vag-Natya for entertainment of rural masses. However, his folk songs on the prevailing social issues like dowry, female foeticide, alcohol addiction, superstition helped in increased social awareness whereas his short-plays, street-plays promoted government initiatives towards sanitation, literacy, water conservation missions.

Another major shift sensibility began in the nineties with the poems and criticism of Shridhar Tilve and the poetry of poets associated with Saushthav, Abhidhanantar and Shabadavedh. In the post nineties, this &#x27;new little magazine movement&#x27; gained momentum and poets like Shridhar Tilve who stood against postmodernism and nativism and poets like Manya Joshi, Hemant Divate, Sachin Ketkar, Mangesh Narayanrao Kale, Saleel Wagh, Mohan Borse, Nitin Kulkarni, Nitin Arun Kulkarni, Varjesh Solanki, Sandeep Deshpande, Vasant Gurjar who touched the new areas of post-modern life. The poetry collections brought out by Abhidhanantar Prakashan, Time and Space, Popular Prakashan, Navta Prakashan and the regular issues of the magazine Abhidhanantar and IRREGULAR issues of Saushthav, Shabdvedh are taking Marathi poetry to the global standards. Another leading wave in contemporary Marathi poetry is the poetry of new dalit wave poets like Arun Kale, Bhujang Meshram and new deshi wave poets like Pravin Bandekar, Shrikant Deshmukh and Veerdhaval Parab.

=== Science fiction ===
Marathi science fiction has a rich heritage and a wide enthusiastic readership. In the early 20th century, Marathi science fiction work was more aligned to fantasy. After 1950, several writers started translating classic English science fiction literature and also contributed independent work.

The modern Marathi science fiction took off after technology started playing a major role in providing a rich context for speculating about the future. From 1975, modern Marathi science fiction has been regularly published in mainstream magazines and also in publications devoted to science and technology.

Marathi Vidnyan Parishad has been consistently at the forefront for modern Marathi science fiction, contributing through multiple channels – publications, translations, critique, writing workshops, and its annual science fiction competition. Many modern writers have emerged from this prestigious competition running uninterrupted since 1970.The first wave of writers includes B R Bhagwat, D P Khambete, Narayan Dharap, D B Mokhashi, Gajanan Kshirsagar, and Yashawant Ranjankar. The modern writers are: Jayant Narlikar, Bal Phondke, Niranajan Ghate, Lakshman Londhe, Subodh Jawdekar, Arun Mande, Madhuri Shanbhag, Shubhada Gogate, Sanjay Dhole, D V Kulkarni, Arun Sadhu, Meghashri Dalvi, Sudha Risbud, Smita Potnis, Prasanna Karandikar, Ashish Mahabal, D V Jahagirdar, Yashawant Deshpande.

=== Encyclopedia ===
Over the last century or so, a number of producing encyclopedias have been produced in marathi. These include . Shreedhar Venkatesh Ketkar&#x27;s &#x27;Dnyaankosh&#x27;, Siddheshwarshastri Chitrao&#x27;s &#x27;Charitra Kosh&#x27;, Mahadevshastri Joshi&#x27;s &#x27;Bharatiy Sanskrutikosh&#x27;, and Laxmanshastri Joshi&#x27;s &#x27;Dharmakosh&#x27; and &#x27;Marathi Vishwakosh&#x27;.

=== Dalit Literature ===

It was in 1958, that the term &quot;Dalit literature&quot; was used for the first time, when the first conference of &quot;Maharashtra Dalit Sahitya Sangha&quot; (Maharashtra Dalit Literature Society) was held at Mumbai, a movement inspired by 19th century social reformer, Jyotiba Phule and eminent dalit leader, Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar.

Baburao Bagul (1930–2008) was a pioneer of Dalit writings in Marathi. His first collection of stories, &quot;Jevha Mi Jat Chorali&quot; (जेव्हा मी जात चोरली) (When I Concealed My Caste), published in 1963, created a stir in Marathi literature with its passionate depiction of a cruel society and thus brought in new momentum to Dalit literature in Marathi. Gradually with other writers like, Namdeo Dhasal (who founded Dalit Panther), these Dalit writings paved way for the strengthening of Dalit movement. Notable Dalit authors writing in Marathi include Arun Kamble, Shantabai Kamble, Raja Dhale, Namdev Dhasal, Daya Pawar, Annabhau Sathe, Laxman Mane, Laxman Gaikwad, Sharankumar Limbale, Bhau Panchbhai, Kishor Shantabai Kale, Narendra Jadhav, and Urmila Pawar.

<doc id="1237273" wikidata="Q718770" url="?curid=1237273" title="Battle of Khafji">
<text>The Battle of Khafji was the first major ground engagement of the Gulf War. It took place in and around the Saudi Arabian city of Khafji, from 29 January to 1 February 1991.

Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who had already tried and failed to draw Coalition forces into costly ground engagements by shelling Saudi Arabian positions and oil storage tanks and firing Scud surface-to-surface missiles at Israel, ordered the invasion of Saudi Arabia from southern Kuwait. The 1st and 5th Mechanized Divisions and 3rd Armored Division were ordered to conduct a multi-pronged invasion toward Khafji, engaging Saudi Arabian, Kuwaiti, and U.S. forces along the coastline, with a supporting Iraqi commando force ordered to infiltrate further south by sea and harass the Coalition&#x27;s rear.

These three divisions, which had suffered significant losses from attacks by Coalition aircraft in the preceding days, attacked on 29 January. Most of their attacks were repulsed by U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army forces but one of the Iraqi columns occupied Khafji on the night of 29–30 January. Between 30 January and 1 February, two Saudi Arabian National Guard battalions and two Qatari tank companies attempted to retake control of the city, aided by Coalition aircraft and U.S. artillery. By 1 February, the city had been recaptured at the cost of 43 Coalition servicemen dead and 52 wounded. Iraqi Army fatalities numbered between 60 and 300, while an estimated 400 were captured as prisoners of war.

Although the invasion of Khafji was initially a propaganda victory for the Ba&#x27;athist Iraqi regime, the battle that led to its swift recapture by Coalition forces demonstrated the importance of air support for ground forces.

==Background==
On 2 August 1990, the Iraqi Army invaded and occupied the neighboring state of Kuwait. The invasion, which followed the inconclusive Iran–Iraq War and three decades of political conflict with Kuwait, offered Saddam Hussein the opportunity to distract political dissent at home and add Kuwait&#x27;s oil resources to Iraq&#x27;s own, a boon in a time of declining petroleum prices.

In response, the United Nations began to pass a series of resolutions demanding the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Afraid that Saudi Arabia would be invaded next, the Saudi Arabian government requested immediate military aid. As a result, the United States began marshalling forces from a variety of nations, styled the Coalition, on the Arabian peninsula. Initially, Saddam Hussein attempted to deter Coalition military action by threatening Kuwait&#x27;s and Iraq&#x27;s petroleum production and export. In December 1990, Iraq experimented with the use of explosives to destroy wellheads in the area of the Ahmadi loading complex, developing their capability to destroy Kuwait&#x27;s petroleum infrastructure on a large scale. On 16 January, Iraqi artillery destroyed an oil storage tank in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and on 19 January the pumps at the Ahmadi loading complex were opened, pouring crude oil into the Persian Gulf. The oil flowed into the sea at a rate of a day, becoming one of the worst ecological disasters to that date.

Despite these Iraqi threats, the Coalition launched a 38-day aerial campaign on 17 January 1991. Flying an estimated 2,000 sorties a day, Coalition aircraft rapidly crippled the Iraqi air defense systems and effectively destroyed the Iraqi Air Force, whose daily sortie rate plummeted from a prewar level of an estimated 200 per day to almost none by 17 January. On the third day of the campaign, many Iraqi pilots fled across the Iranian border in their aircraft rather than be destroyed. The air campaign also targeted command-and-control sites, bridges, railroads, and petroleum storage facilities.

Saddam Hussein, who is believed to have said, &quot;The air force has never decided a war,&quot; nevertheless worried that the air campaign would erode Iraq&#x27;s national morale. The Iraqi leader also believed that the United States would not be willing to lose many troops in action, and therefore sought to draw Coalition ground troops into a decisive battle. In an attempt to provoke a ground battle, he directed Iraqi forces to launch Scud missiles against Israel, while continuing to threaten the destruction of oilfields in Kuwait. These efforts were unsuccessful in provoking a large ground battle, so Saddam Hussein decided to launch a limited offensive into Saudi Arabia with the aim of inflicting heavy losses on the Coalition armies.

As the air campaign continued, the Coalition&#x27;s expectations of an Iraqi offensive decreased. As a result, the United States redeployed the XVIII Airborne Corps and the VII Corps 480 kilometers (300 mi) to the west. The Coalition&#x27;s leadership believed that should an Iraqi force go on the offensive, it would be launched from the al-Wafra oil fields, in Southern Kuwait.

==Order of battle==
The Iraqi Army had between 350,000 and 500,000 soldiers in theater, organized into 51 divisions, including eight Republican Guard divisions. Republican Guard units normally received the newest equipment; for example, most of the estimated 1,000 T-72 tanks in the Iraqi Army on the eve of the war were in Republican Guard divisions. The Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (KTO) also included nine heavy divisions, composed mostly of professional soldiers, but with weapons of a generally lesser grade than those issued to the Republican Guard.

Most non-Republican Guard armored units had older tank designs, mainly the T-55 or its Chinese equivalents, the Type 59 and Type 69. The remaining 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts. These divisions were deployed to channel the Coalition&#x27;s forces through a number of break points along the front, allowing the Iraqi Army&#x27;s heavy divisions and the Republican Guard units to isolate them and counterattack. However, the Iraqis left their western flank open, failing to account for tactics made possible by the Global Positioning System and other new technologies.

In Saudi Arabia, the Coalition originally deployed over 200,000 soldiers, 750 aircraft and 1,200 tanks. This quickly grew to 3,600 tanks and over 600,000 personnel, of whom over 500,000 were from the United States.

===Iraqi forces===
Earmarked for the offensive into Saudi Arabia was the Iraqi Third Corps, the 1st Mechanized Division from Fourth Corps and a number of commando units. Third Corps, commanded by Major General Salah Aboud Mahmoud (who would also command the overall offensive), had the 3rd Armored Division and 5th Mechanized Division, as well as a number of infantry divisions. Fourth Corps&#x27; commander was Major General Ayad Khalil Zaki. The 3rd Armored Division had a number of T-72 tanks, the only non-Republican Guard force to have them, while the other armored battalions had T-62s and T-55s, a few of which had an Iraqi appliqué armor similar to the Soviet bulging armor also known as &quot;brow&quot; laminate armor or BDD.

During the battle of Khafji, these upgraded T-55s survived impacts from MILAN anti-tank missiles. These divisions also had armored personnel vehicles such as the BMP-1, scout vehicles such as the BRDM-2, and several types of artillery. Also deployed along this portion of the front, though not chosen to participate in the invasion, were five infantry divisions that were under orders to remain in their defensive positions along the border.
U.S. Marine Corps reconnaissance estimated that the Iraqi Army had amassed around 60,000 troops across the border, near the Kuwaiti town of Wafra, in as many as 5 or 6 divisions. Infantry divisions normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit, although some infantry divisions could have up to eight brigades–however most infantry divisions along the border were understrength, primarily due to desertion.

Armored and mechanized divisions normally made use of three brigades, with each brigade having up to four combat battalions; depending on the division type, these were generally a three to one mix, with either three mechanized battalions and one armored battalion, or vice versa. Given the size of the forces deployed across the border, it is thought that the Iraqi Army planned to continue the offensive, after the successful capture of Khafji, in order to seize the valuable oil fields at Dammam.

The attack would consist of a four-prong offensive. The 1st Mechanized Division would pass through the 7th and 14th Infantry Divisions to protect the flank of the 3rd Armored Division, which would provide a blocking force west of Khafji while the 5th Mechanized Division took the town. The 1st Mechanized and 3rd Armored divisions would then retire to Kuwait, while the 5th Mechanized Division would wait until the Coalition launched a counteroffensive. The principal objectives were to inflict heavy casualties on the attacking Coalition soldiers and take prisoners of war, who Saddam Hussein theorized would be an excellent bargaining tool with the Coalition.

As the units moved to the Saudi Arabian border, many were attacked by Coalition aircraft. Around the Al-Wafrah forest, about 1,000 Iraqi armored fighting vehicles were attacked by Harrier aircraft with Rockeye cluster bombs. Another Iraqi convoy of armored vehicles was hit by A-10s, which destroyed the first and last vehicles, before systematically attacking the stranded remainders. Such air raids prevented the majority of the Iraqi troops deployed for the offensive from taking part in it.
===Coalition forces===
During the buildup of forces, the U.S. had built observation posts along the Kuwaiti-Saudi Arabian border to gather intelligence on Iraqi forces. These were manned by U.S. Navy SEALs, U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance and Army Special Forces personnel. Observation post 8 was farthest to the east, on the coast, and another seven observation posts were positioned each until the end of the &quot;heel&quot;, the geographic panhandle of southernmost Kuwait. Observation posts 8 and 7 overlooked the coastal highway that ran to Khafji, considered the most likely invasion route of the city. 1st Marine Division had three companies positioned at observation posts 4, 5 and 6 (Task Force Shepard), while the 2nd Marine Division&#x27;s 2nd Light Armored Infantry Battalion set up a screen between observation post 1 and the Al-Wafrah oil fields. The U.S. Army&#x27;s 2nd Armored Division provided its 1st Brigade to give the Marines some much needed armored support.

The Saudi Arabians gave responsibility for the defense of Khafji to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade, attached to Task Force Abu Bakr. The 5th Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade set up a screen north and west of Khafji, under observation post 7. At the time, a Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade could have up to four motorized battalions, each with three line companies. The brigade had a nominal strength of an estimated 5,000 soldiers. The Saudi Arabians also deployed the Tariq Task Force, composed of Saudi Arabian marines, a Moroccan mechanized infantry battalion, and two Senegalese infantry companies. Two further task forces, Othman and Omar Task Forces, consisted of two Mechanized Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigades, providing screens about south of the border. The road south of Khafji was covered by one battalion of Saudi Arabian National Guard supported by one battalion of Qatari tanks. The country&#x27;s main defenses were placed south of the screen.

The majority of the Arab contingent was led by General Khaled bin Sultan. The forces around Khafji were organized into the Joint Forces Command-East, while Joint Forces Command-North defended the border between observation post 1 and the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border.


==Battle==
On 27 January 1991, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met in Basra with the two Iraqi army corps commanders who were to lead the operation, and Major General Salah Mahmoud told him that Khafji would be his by 30 January. During his return trip to Baghdad, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s convoy was attacked by Coalition aircraft; the Iraqi leader escaped unscathed.

Throughout 28 January, the Coalition received a number of warnings suggesting an impending Iraqi offensive. The Coalition was flying two brand-new E-8A Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) aircraft, which picked up the deployment and movement of Iraqi forces to the area opposite of Khafji. Observation posts 2, 7 and 8 also detected heavy Iraqi reconnoitering along the border, and their small teams of air-naval gunfire liaison Marines called in air and artillery strikes throughout the day. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Barry, commander of the forward headquarters of the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group, sent warnings about an impending attack to Central Command. CentCom leaders were too preoccupied with the air campaign to heed them however, and so the Iraqi operation came as a surprise.

===Beginning of Iraqi offensive: 29 January===

The Iraqi offensive began on the night of 29 January, when approximately 2,000 soldiers in several hundred armored fighting vehicles moved south. Post-war analysis by the US Air Force&#x27;s Air University suggests Iraq planned to utilize the 3rd Armored Division and 5th Mechanized Division to make the actual attack on Khafji, with the 1st Mechanized Division assigned to protect the attacking force&#x27;s western flank. The Iraqi incursion into Saudi Arabia consisted of three columns, mostly made up of T-62 tanks and armored personnel carriers (APCs). The Gulf War&#x27;s first ground engagement was near observation post 4 (OP-4), built on the Al-Zabr police building. Elements of the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade, ordered to take the heights above Al-Zabr, engaged Coalition units at Al-Zabr. At 20:00 hours, U.S. Marines at the observation post, who had noticed large groups of armored vehicles through their night vision devices, attempted to talk to battalion headquarters but received no response. Since contact earlier was no problem, there was a strong presumption that the reconnaissance platoon&#x27;s radios were being jammed. Using runners, Lieutenant Ross alerted his platoon and continued trying to get through and inform higher headquarters and Company D of the oncoming Iraqi force. Contact was not established until 20:30 hours, which prompted Task Force Shepard to respond to the threat. Coalition soldiers at observation post 4 were lightly armed, and could only respond with TOW anti-tank missiles before calling in air support. Air support arrived by 21:30 and took the form of several F-15E, F-16C, four A-10 Tank Killers and three AC-130 gunships, which intervened in a heavy firefight between Iraqi and Coalition ground forces at OP-4. The reconnaissance platoon stationed at OP-4 was the first to come under attack, their withdrawal from the engagement was facilitated by another company providing cover fire. The attempt by the soldiers stationed at OP-4 to fend off or delay the Iraqi advance cost them several casualties, and in the face of a heavy Iraqi response they were forced to retire south, by order of its commanding officer.
To cover the withdrawal, the company&#x27;s platoon of LAV-25s and LAV-ATs (anti-tank variants) moved to engage the Iraqi force. After receiving permission, one of the anti-tank vehicles opened fire at what it believed was an Iraqi tank. Instead, the missile destroyed a friendly LAV-AT a few hundred meters in front of it. Despite this loss, the platoon continued forward and soon opened fire on the Iraqi tanks with the LAV-25s&#x27; autocannons. The fire could not penetrate the tanks&#x27; armor, but did damage their optics and prevented the tanks from fighting back effectively.

Soon thereafter, a number of A-10 ground-attack aircraft arrived but found it difficult to pinpoint enemy targets and began dropping flares to illuminate the zone. One of these flares landed on a friendly vehicle, and although the vehicle radioed in its position, it was hit by an AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile that killed the entire crew except for the driver. Following the incident, the company was withdrawn and the remaining vehicles reorganized into another nearby company. With observation post 4 cleared, the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade withdrew over the border to Al-Wafrah under heavy fire from Coalition aircraft. Coalition forces had lost 11 troops to friendly fire and none to enemy action.

While the events at observation post 4 were unfolding, the Iraqi 5th Mechanized Division crossed the Saudi Arabian border near observation post 1. A Company of the 2nd Light Infantry Armored Battalion, which was screening the Iraqi unit, reported a column of 60–100 BMPs. The column was engaged by Coalition A-10s and Harrier jump jets. This was then followed by another column with an estimated 29 tanks. One of the column&#x27;s T-62 tanks was engaged by an anti-tank missile and destroyed. Coalition air support, provided by A-10s and F-16s, engaged the Iraqi drive through observation post 1 and ultimately repulsed the attack back over the Kuwaiti border. Aircraft continued to engage the columns throughout the night, until the next morning. Another column of Iraqi tanks, approaching observation post 2, were engaged by aircraft and also repulsed that night.
An additional Iraqi column crossed the Saudi Arabian border to the East, although still along the coast, towards the city of Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, as it had been ordered to not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi Arabian border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.

Nevertheless, the Iraqi advance towards Khafji continued on this sector, despite repeated attacks from an AC-130. Attempts by the Saudi Arabian commanders to call in additional air strikes on the advancing Iraqi column failed when the requested heavy air support never arrived. Khafji was occupied by approximately 00:30 on 30 January, trapping two six-man reconnaissance teams from the 1st Marine Division in the city. The teams occupied two apartment buildings in the southern sector of the city and called artillery fire on their position to persuade the Iraqis to call off a search of the area. Throughout the night, Coalition air support composed of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft continued to engage Iraqi tanks and artillery.

===Initial response: 30 January===
Distressed by the occupation of Khafji, Saudi Arabian commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to U.S. General Norman Schwarzkopf for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces in and around the city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that the city would be retaken by Arab ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade&#x27;s 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi Arabian infantry with V-150 armored cars and two Qatari tank companies attached to the task force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.

The force was put under the command of Saudi Arabian Lieutenant Colonel Matar, who moved out by 17:00 hours. The force met up with elements of the U.S. 3rd Marine Regiment, south of Khafji, and were ordered to directly attack the city. A platoon of Iraqi T-55s attacked south of the city, leading to the destruction of three T-55s by Qatari AMX-30s, and the capture of a fourth Iraqi tank. Lacking any coordinated artillery support, artillery fire was provided by the 10th Marine Regiment.
An initial attack on the city was called off after the Iraqi occupants opened up with heavy fire, prompting the Saudi Arabians to reinforce the 7th Battalion with two more companies from adjacent Saudi Arabian units. The attempt to retake the city had been preceded by a 15-minute preparatory fire from U.S. Marine artillery. However Iraqi fire did manage to destroy one Saudi Arabian V-150.

Meanwhile, 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade&#x27;s 5th Battalion moved north of Khafji to block Iraqi reinforcements attempting to reach the city. This unit was further bolstered by the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade, and heavily aided by Coalition air support. Although fear of friendly fire forced the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade to pull back the following morning, Coalition aircraft successfully hindered Iraqi attempts to move more soldiers down to Khafji and caused large numbers of Iraqi troops to surrender to Saudi Arabian forces.

That night, two U.S. Army heavy equipment transporters entered the city of Khafji, apparently lost, and were fired upon by Iraqi troops. Although one truck managed to turn around and escape, the two drivers of the second truck were wounded and captured. This led to a rescue mission organized by 3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment, which sent a force of 30 men to extract the two wounded drivers. Although encountering no major opposition, they did not find the two drivers who had, by this time, been taken prisoner. The Marines did find a burnt out Qatari AMX-30, with its dead crew. In the early morning hours, despite significant risk to their safety, an AC-130 providing overwatch stayed beyond sunrise. It was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile (SAM), killing the aircraft&#x27;s crew of 14.

The interdiction on the part of Coalition aircraft and Saudi Arabian and Qatari ground forces was having an effect on the occupying Iraqi troops. Referring to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s naming of the ground engagement as the &quot;mother of all battles&quot;, Iraqi General Salah radioed in a request to withdraw, stating, &quot;The mother was killing her children.&quot; Since the beginning of the battle, Coalition aircraft had flown at least 350 sorties against Iraqi units in the area and on the night of 30–31 January, Coalition air support also began to attack units of the Iraqi Third Corps assembled on the Saudi Arabian border.

===Recapture of Khafji: 31 January – 1 February===
On 31 January, the effort to retake the city began anew. The attack was launched at 08:30 hours, and was met by heavy but mostly inaccurate Iraqi fire; however, three Saudi Arabian V-150 armored cars were knocked out by RPG-7s at close range. The 8th battalion of the Saudi Arabian brigade was ordered to deploy to the city by 10:00 hours, while 5th Battalion to the north engaged another column of Iraqi tanks attempting to reach the city. The latter engagement led to the destruction of around 13 Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers, and the capture of 6 more vehicles and 116 Iraqi soldiers, costing the Saudi Arabian battalion two dead and two wounded. The 8th Battalion engaged the city from the northeast, linking up with 7th Battalion. These units cleared the southern portion of the city, until 7th Battalion withdrew south to rest and rearm at 18:30 hours, while the 8th remained in Khafji. The two Qatari tank companies, with U.S. Marine artillery and air support, moved north of the city to block Iraqi reinforcements.

The 8th continued clearing buildings and by the time the 7th had withdrawn to the south, the Saudi Arabians had lost approximately 18 dead and 50 wounded, as well as seven V-150 vehicles. Coalition aircraft continued to provide heavy support throughout the day and night. A veteran of the Iran-Iraq War later mentioned that Coalition airpower &quot;imposed more damage on his brigade in half an hour than it had sustained in eight years of fighting against the Iranians.&quot; During the battle, an Iraqi amphibious force was sent to land on the coast and moved into Khafji. As the boats made their way through the Persian Gulf towards Khafji, U.S. and British aircraft caught the Iraqi boats in the open and destroyed over 90% of the Iraqi amphibious force.

The Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti units renewed operations the following day. Two Iraqi companies, with about 20 armored vehicles, remained in the city and had not attempted to break out during the night. While the Saudi Arabian 8th Battalion continued operations in the southern portion of the city, the 7th Battalion began to clear the northern sector of the city. Iraqi resistance was sporadic and most Iraqi soldiers surrendered on sight; as a result, the city was recaptured on 1 February 1991.

==Aftermath==

During the battle, Coalition forces incurred 43 fatalities and 52 injured casualties. This included 25 Americans killed, 11 of them by friendly fire along with 14 airmen killed when their AC-130 was shot down by Iraqi SAMs. The U.S. also had two soldiers wounded and another two soldiers were captured in Khafji.

Saudi Arabian casualties totaled 18 killed and 50 wounded. Two Saudi main battle tanks and ten lightly armored V-150s were knocked out. Most of the V150s were knocked out by RPG-7 fire in close-range fighting inside the town of Khafji. One of the two main battle tanks was hit by a 100mm main gun round from a T-55.

Iraq listed its casualties as 71 dead, 148 wounded and 702 missing. U.S. sources present at the battle claim that 300 Iraqis lost their lives, and at least 90 vehicles were destroyed. Another source suggests that 60 Iraqi soldiers were killed and at least 400 taken prisoner, while no less than 80 armored vehicles were knocked out; however these casualties are attributed to the fighting both inside and directly north of Khafji.

Whatever the exact casualties, the majority of three Iraqi mechanized/armored divisions had been destroyed.

The Iraqi capture of Khafji was a major propaganda victory for Iraq: on 30 January Iraqi radio claimed that they had &quot;expelled Americans from the Arab territory&quot;. For many in the Arab world, the battle of Khafji was seen as an Iraqi victory, and Hussein made every possible effort to turn the battle into a political victory. On the other side, confidence within the United States Armed Forces in the abilities of the Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti armies increased as the battle progressed. After Khafji, the Coalition&#x27;s leadership began to sense that the Iraqi Army was a &quot;hollow force&quot; and it provided them with an impression of the degree of resistance they would face during the Coalition&#x27;s ground offensive that would begin later that month. The battle was felt by the Saudi Arabian government to be a major propaganda victory, which had successfully defended its territory.

Despite the success of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main offensive into Kuwait and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February. The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of the manner in which Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the U.S. dead.

<text>Kazuhiro &quot;Kazu&quot; Kibuishi (born April 8, 1978) is a Japanese-born American graphic novel author and illustrator. He is best known for being the creator and editor of the comic anthology &quot;Flight&quot; and for creating the webcomic &quot;Copper&quot;. He is also the author and illustrator of the &quot;Amulet&quot; series.

== Early life and education ==
Kibuishi was born April 8, 1978, in Tokyo, Japan. He moved to the United States with his mother and brother in 1982.

Kibuishi enrolled at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1996 to pursue a degree in film studies.[4] While attending UC Santa Barbara, he credits the university&#x27;s newspaper, the Daily Nexus, as where his illustration career started.[4] Though he had previously drawn for his high school&#x27;s newspaper, Kibuishi has stated that &quot;[his career] all began when I started writing comics for the Nexus. I actually went to UCSB for film. I was trying to quit drawing.&quot;[4] He would ultimately serve as the Art Director for the Daily Nexus for three and a half years, and developed his comic Clive and Cabbage during his tenure.[4] He graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2000 with a B.A. in film studies.[5]

== Career ==
Kibuishi started drawing at age five. He has stated that it was &quot;the sadness that came from no longer having cool robot TV shows like Ultraman around once we came to the States that triggered a lot of my early drawings and projects.&quot; He has also noted Garfield and the magazines &quot;Mad&quot; Magazine, and &quot;CARtoons&quot; as catalysts for his love of comic books in particular.

After he graduated from UC Santa Barbara, Kibuishi worked as an animator for Shadedbox Animations for two years. He decided to leave animation to focus on comics, where he could spend more time writing. He started producing the monthly comic &quot;Copper&quot; at his website which ran for seven years, ending in 2009.

=== &quot;Flight&quot; ===
&quot;Flight&quot; was conceived by Kibuishi as an anthology with contributions coming from friends. The project was promoted at the Alternative Press Expo, where it attracted the attention of Erik Larsen, then-new publisher of Image Comics. This caused the project to explode, attracting talent from all over the industry. Image published the first volume in 2004 and the anthology series concluded with the eighth volume in 2011.

=== &quot;Explorer&quot; ===
Following the conclusion of &quot;Flight&quot;, the &quot;Explorer&quot; series was Kibuishi&#x27;s anthology for children using many of the same contributors to &quot;Flight&quot;. Seen as a successor series, &quot;Explorer&quot; covered three books and concluded with &quot;Explorer: The Hidden Doors&quot;.

=== &quot;Amulet&quot; ===
Kibuishi is the creator of &quot;Amulet&quot;, a series of graphic novels which debuted in 2008 with &quot;The Stonekeeper&quot;. Scholastic won the rights to publish the series after they were victorious in a hotly contested auction. In addition to &quot;The Stonekeeper&quot;, other titles in the series include &quot;The Stonekeeper&#x27;s Curse&quot;, &quot;The Cloud Searchers&quot;, &quot;The Last Council&quot;, &quot;Prince of the Elves&quot;, &quot;Escape From Lucien&quot;, &quot;Firelight&quot;, &quot;Supernova&quot;, and &quot;Waverider&quot;. The series concluded with the ninth and final book titled &quot;Waverider&quot;, which released on February 6th, 2024. 

=== Other projects ===
While editing &quot;Flight&quot; Volume 1, Kibuishi created the 4-issue steampunk graphic novel &quot;Daisy Kutter: The Last Train&quot;, published by Viper Comics.

Through his relationship with Scholastic, Kibuishi was asked to illustrate the covers for the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels for inclusion in the 15th anniversary edition box set.

He also illustrated the story &quot;?&quot; for the short story collection &quot;Machine of Death&quot;.

He illustrated Brandon Sanderson&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;The Most Boring Book Ever&quot;.

== Honors and awards ==
Kibuishi&#x27;s &quot;Flight&quot; Volume 2 was nominated for the 2006 Eisner Award for Best Anthology. &quot;Daisy Kutter: The Last Train&quot; was named as one of the 2006 Best Books for Young Adults by the Young Adult Library Services Association.

His series &quot;Amulet&quot; has spent numerous weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Best Seller list.

== Personal life ==
Kibuishi is married to fellow illustrator and collaborator Amy Kim Ganter. He has two children, Juni and Sophie. He resides in Bellevue, Washington. Shortly after the publication of &quot;Escape From Lucien&quot; in 2012, he suffered a life-threatening case of bacterial meningitis which resulted in a hospital stay for weeks and being induced into a coma for treatment.

* Cenaloș (), to the southeast of Sâniob
* Ciuhoi ( ), to the south of Sâniob
* Sâniob
* Sfârnaș (), to the southwest of Sâniob
Known as Sâniob prior to 1968, the commune&#x27;s name was changed to Ciuhoi that year and its seat moved to the latter village. In 2012, the commune&#x27;s previous name was revived and the seat moved back to Sâniob village.

==History==
The village was named after Stephen I of Hungary&#x27;s Holy Dexter, whose preserved right hand was kept in an abbey here. The name was granted by Ladislaus I of Hungary in 1083. The locality was conquered by the Ottomans in 1661, becoming the seat of a &quot;sanjak&quot; in Varat Eyalet. Called by the new authorities, it was captured by the Habsburg monarchy in 1691.

==Demographics==
At the 2011 census, the commune had 2,333 inhabitants, of which 56.7% were Hungarians, 37.3% Romanians, and 5.6% Roma. In terms of religious affiliation, 46.1% were Roman Catholic, 29% Romanian Orthodox, 16.4% Reformed, 5.9% Pentecostal, and 0.9% Greek-Catholic. At the 2021 census, Sâniob had a population of 2,237; of those, 60.62% were Hungarians and 33.62% Romanians.

<text>Patrick McCabe (born 27 March 1955) is an Irish writer. Known for his mostly dark and violent novels set in contemporary—often small-town—Ireland, McCabe has been twice shortlisted for the Booker Prize, for &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot; (1992) and &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; (1998), both of which have been made into films.

==Biography==
McCabe was born in Clones, County Monaghan. He resides in Clones with his artist wife Margot Quinn and two daughters, Katie and Ellen. Aged 17 he migrated to London and worked as a teacher, returning to Ireland after finding success as a writer.

==Career==
McCabe&#x27;s books include &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot; (1992) and &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; (1998), both shortlisted for the Booker Prize. He has written a children&#x27;s book (&quot;The Adventures of Shay Mouse&quot;) and several of his radio plays have been broadcast by RTÉ and BBC Radio 4. He wrote a collection of linked short stories, &quot;Mondo Desperado&quot;, published in 1999. The play &quot;Frank Pig Says Hello&quot;, which he adapted from &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot;, was first performed at the Dublin Theatre Festival in 1992.

McCabe&#x27;s 2001 novel &quot;Emerald Germs of Ireland&quot; is a black comedy featuring matricide. &quot;Winterwood&quot;, published in 2006, was 2007 Hughes &amp; Hughes/&quot;Irish Independent&quot; Irish Novel of the Year. 2009 saw the publication of &quot;The Holy City&quot;. &quot;The Stray Sod Country&quot; was described as &quot;Strangely elegiac, gloriously operatic and driven by (...) wild and savage imagination, (...) an eerie folk tale that chronicles the passing of a generation.&quot;

Director and novelist Neil Jordan has adapted both &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot; and &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; into films.

Zelig Theatre premiered the play &quot;Appointment in Limbo&quot;, written by McCabe, in Galway&#x27;s Town Hall Theatre in 2008. Cathal Cleary directed.

<doc id="1237318" wikidata="Q889287" url="?curid=1237318" title="Winthrop Sargent">
<text>Winthrop Sargent (May 1, 1753 – June 3, 1820) was an American politician, military officer and writer, who served as Governor of Mississippi Territory from 1798 to 1801, and briefly as acting Adjutant General of the U. S. Army in 1791. He was a member of the Federalist party.

==Early life==
Sargent was born in Gloucester, Massachusetts, on May 1, 1753. He was one of eight children born to Winthrop Sargent (1727–1793) and Judith Saunders. His elder sister was Judith Sargent Murray (1751–1820), an essayist, playwright, and poet.

He was the grandson of Colonel Epes Sargent, one of the largest landholders in Gloucester. Sargent was also the nephew of Daniel Sargent Sr. (1730–1806), a prominent merchant, Paul Dudley Sargent (1745–1828), who also served in the Continental Army, and John Sargent (1750–1824), a Loyalist during the Revolution.

He graduated from Harvard College Class of 1771 before the Revolution. He spent some time at sea, as captain of a merchantman owned by his father.

==Career==

Shortly after the outbreak of the American Revolution, Sargent was commissioned in Gridley&#x27;s Regiment of Massachusetts Artillery on July 7, 1775, as a lieutenant, and later that year was promoted to captain lieutenant of Knox&#x27;s Regiment, Continental Artillery, on December 10. He was with his guns at the siege of Boston, and later served in the battles of Long Island, White Plains, Trenton, Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth. He was promoted to captain in the 3rd Continental Artillery on January 1, 1777, and brevetted major on August 25, 1783, and was discharged from the Continental Army later that year. In 1783 he became an Original Member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati.

In 1786, he helped to survey the Seven Ranges, the first lands laid out under the Land Ordinance of 1785. With inside knowledge of the area, he went on to form the Ohio Company of Associates, was an important shareholder in the Scioto Company, and as of 1787, secretary of the Ohio Company.

Sargent was appointed by the Congress of the Confederation as the first Secretary of the Northwest Territory, a post second in importance only to the governor, Arthur St. Clair. He took up his post in 1788. Like St. Clair, Sargent would function in both civil and military capacities; he served as acting Adjutant General of U.S. Army from September 1791 until he was wounded twice at the Battle of the Wabash, on November 4, 1791. On August 15, 1796, he would, as Acting Governor, proclaim the establishment of Wayne County, the first American government in what is now Michigan.

President John Adams then appointed Sargent the first Governor of the Mississippi Territory, effective from May 7, 1798, to May 25, 1801. His last entry as Northwest Territory&#x27;s secretary was on May 31, 1798; he arrived at Natchez on August 6, but due to illness was unable to assume his post until August 16.

The subject was a cotton planter, marketing his crop in New York by Gilbert and John Aspinwall, merchants.

===Later life===
In 1788, Sargent was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was also a member of the American Philosophical Society elected in 1789 and an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati as a delegate from Massachusetts, and published, with Benjamin B. Smith, &quot;Papers Relative to Certain American Antiquities&quot; (Philadelphia, 1796), and &quot;Boston,&quot; a poem (Boston, 1803).

Being a Federalist, Sargent was dismissed from his position as territorial governor of Mississippi in 1801 by incoming president Thomas Jefferson. Sargent took up life in the private sector, developing his plantation Gloucester, the earliest such establishment in Natchez. Sargent was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1813.

During the last decades of Winthrop&#x27;s life he became major plantation owner in [Natchez, Mississippi]. He acquired extensive plantations due to his marriage to wealthy widow Mary (McIntosh) Williams. In Natchez alone Winthrop owned over 300 slaves and 11,000 acres.

==Personal life==
In 1789, he married Roewena Tupper (1766–1790), a daughter of Gen. Benjamin Tupper, at the settlement of Marietta in the first marriage ceremony held under the laws of the Northwest Territory. After her death, he married Hannah Ober of Massachusetts on 13 Feb 1791. They had a daughter, Hannah born 25 August 1791 in Massachusetts, and Hannah Ober died the next day. Then he married Mary McIntosh Williams (1760–1823) shortly after moving to Natchez. They were the parents of:

* Caroline Augusta Sargent (1795–1844), who married Fielding Lewis Turner (1776–1843)
* William Fitz-Winthrop Sargent (b. 1799)
* George Washington Sargent (1802–1864), who married Margaret Isabella Jessie Percy (1802–1865).

He died on June 3, 1820, in New Orleans. His grandson was the writer Winthrop Sargent (1825–1870). A 1848 Louisiana Supreme Court case decided that the Louisiana portion of Winthrop&#x27;s estate which included real estate, timber, agricultural properties in Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Virginia and Massachusetts would be divided between his son George Washington Sargent as well as his stepchildren through his marriage to Mary Williams. These step children included Mary (Williams) Urquhart and Mary Sargents grandchildren through her deceased son James C Williams, namely David Percy Williams. Some of the properties of Winthrop Sargent were passed through the Natchez David Williams family who arrived in the 1700s according to Supreme Court case. The Winthrop Sargent estate was worth several million dollars in 1700s currency and valued at nearly 10 million dollars in the mid-1800s when his heirs divided his estate. One of the heirs of Winthrops estate was Archie P Williams a mixed race slave owner who became a millionaire in 1800s dollars due to his 1/4th share of Sargents estate through his grandfather James C Williams. The majority of the Winthrop Sargent estate today is owned by one of the Williams heirs, Anton R Williams. Anton R. Williams Holding Company of Grand Rapids, Michigan and its funding arm continues legacy business operations

==Legacy==
Although there are at least two Sargent Townships (in Illinois and Nebraska) and one Sargent County, it is not known if these are named after Winthrop Sargent. However, a former township of the Northwest Territory&#x27;s Wayne County was designated as Sargent Township or the District of Sargent; this apparently encompassed the settlements downriver from Detroit and at the River Raisin in what is now Monroe County, Michigan. This township apparently ceased to function after the organization of Michigan Territory, being replaced by the District of Erie.
A student dormitory at Ohio University (founded in 1804) in Athens, Ohio, is named Sargent Hall in his honor. This is the first university in the Northwest Territory and the first in Ohio.

<text>Adventures of Lolo 2 is a puzzle video game released in 1990 by HAL Laboratory for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the seventh installment of the Japanese &quot;Eggerland&quot; video game series. It was the fourth game released in European countries and the second one released in the United States and Canada, but was never released in Japan.

Like its American predecessor, it is a collection of puzzles from &quot;Eggerland: Meikyū no Fukkatsu&quot; and &quot;Eggerland: Sōzō he no Tabidachi&quot;, plus some puzzles from the Japanese &quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot;. The American game also re-used cut-scenes and graphics from the Japanese one.

The Japan-exclusive Adventures of Lolo, on the other hand, is a different game, consisting entirely of original puzzles. It was released for the Famicom and is the sixth installment in the &quot;Eggerland&quot; series.

The Japanese &quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot; was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in Japan on June 5, 2007. It was later released in Japan on the 3DS Virtual Console on April 9, 2014, on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console on September 3 the same year and via Nintendo Switch Online on December 12, 2018.

The American &quot;Adventures of Lolo 2&quot; was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2008 for North America on January 21, and in PAL regions on February 1.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay is virtually identical to the previous &quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot; (US), since both are compilations of puzzles from &quot;Eggerland: Meikyū no Fukkatsu&quot; and &quot;Eggerland: Sōzō he no Tabidachi&quot;. Some of the monster graphics were drawn differently, mainly Gol, Rocky, Skull, Medusa, and Don Medusa. Other differences include new puzzles and greater difficulty.

The game features a total of 50 different puzzle rooms; the player faces King Egger at the end. Also featured are four hidden Pro puzzle rooms, which are available for players who want to try very challenging rooms.

The Japan-only &quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot; has mostly different and more difficult levels compared to the North American and European collection.

<text>Nightly Business Report was an American business news magazine television program that aired on public television stations from January 22, 1979 to December 27, 2019, for most of that time syndicated by American Public Television. Internationally the show was seen on CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia.

From January 22, 1979 to March 1, 2013, the show was produced at WPBT in Miami, Florida. In February 2013, CNBC purchased the program and closed its Miami operations. Tyler Mathisen joined Susie Gharib as co-anchor when it relaunched on March 4, 2013 to coincide with Gharib&#x27;s return to CNBC after leaving it in 1998 to join &quot;NBR&quot;. Gharib left &quot;NBR&quot; on December 31, 2014; she was replaced on January 5, 2015 by Sue Herera, previously Mathisen&#x27;s co-anchor on CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Power Lunch&quot;, and the final female anchor of the program. On March 9, 2018, Mathisen left the program, and was replaced three days later by original &quot;Power Lunch&quot; anchor Bill Griffeth who reunited with his former &quot;PL&quot; co-anchor Herera. He is also known as a final male anchor of the program.

On November 11, 2019, CNBC announced that &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot; would be discontinued at the end of the year. The final broadcast aired on December 27, 2019, which ended &quot;NBR&quot;″s nearly 41–year run.

==Format==

The daily program consisted of reports on the changes in the stock market, indices, and stocks of note for the day, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ, the S&amp;P 500, and other major markets, as well as interviews with important business persons, generally CEOs of major companies as well as economists, market analysts and policy makers.

Special programs on market holidays departed from this format, and often dealt with a single subject or theme; New Year&#x27;s Day and Independence Day editions tended to focus on retrospectives and predictions for the past and coming fiscal periods. The program often concluded with a commentary. Segments within the program included &quot;Market Monitor&quot;, &quot;Street Critique&quot;, &quot;Women in Leadership&quot;, and &quot;Planet Forward&quot; to name a few. There was a 15-minute morning version of NBR called &quot;Morning Business Report&quot; hosted by Melissa Conti that ran from January 3, 1994 to December 31, 2002.

==Broadcast history==

The idea for a business news program had come from several businessmen on the WPBT Board. Linda O&#x27;Bryon, who was WPBT&#x27;s News Director at the time, headed the effort to get NBR on the air. In the fall of 1978, she was approached by senior management and asked to create a daily business news program. She developed the program concept and expanded the editorial staff to launch NBR (then called &quot;The Nightly Business Report&quot;). Paul Kangas was among the first to join, signing on as its stock market commentator. O&#x27;Bryon and Merwin Sigale were the first co-anchors. The editorial/production team that launched the program included WPBT veterans Rodney Ward, Bruce Eibe, and Jeff Huff, and Jack Kahn, who was the program&#x27;s first producer.

Starting on January 22, 1979, NBR was initially launched as a local show, then two years later, on October 19, 1981, it was launched nationwide on 125 public stations around the country. The show was originally 15 minutes long, but it was expanded to 30 minutes later in 1979. Merwin Sigale went on to resign in 1980, being replaced by former WTVJ anchor Del Frank. The first regular commentator on the program when it went national was Alan Greenspan, then a private economist, who remained as an NBR commentator until his appointment as Chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1987. A number of public television stations supplemented the program&#x27;s newsgathering efforts by serving as &quot;bureaus&quot; for the program.

In 1989, Jim Wicks was named co-anchor, and moved from the flagship station of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Toronto where he was main anchor. At the end of his contract, Wicks moved to ABC News in Cleveland. He has since left the television news business and returned to his motion picture career where he got his start. He works in post-production as a film colorist.

From 1989 to 1991, broadcast journalist Frank Mottek served as substitute anchor for Paul Kangas providing the &quot;Stock Market Report and Commentary.&quot; Mottek solo anchored the program on January 1, 1991 and periodically co-anchored NBR with Paul Kangas while filling in for the other two main anchors. Mottek is currently business news anchor in Los Angeles on all news station KNX and host of the business news program Mottek On Money.

In 1990, on the height of the series&#x27; popularity, WPBT launched its unit, NBR Enterprises to sell videotapes and newsletters that was centered around the series. Following it, the show came yet another overhaul in 1991, when one anchor came from New York, and the other anchor came from Miami, while adding its own bureaus in Los Angeles and Chicago, and hired Cassie Seifert to serve as anchor of the desk in the New York department.

In 1998, financial journalist Susie Gharib joined the anchor desk with Paul Kangas. Gharib anchored from the heart of New York&#x27;s financial district, while Kangas remained at the program&#x27;s production center in Miami.

From 1988 to 1997, NBR was co-produced by Reuters, and from 1997 to 2001, it was co-produced by its arch-rival before its bankruptcy, Bridge Information Systems.

NBR was also seen internationally through Worldnet, the U.S. Radio and Television Armed Services network and on SBS in Australia and Triangle Television in New Zealand. Audio of the program aired on Sirius XM satellite radio at 7:00pm ET. NBR operated three reporting bureaus with full-time staff members as well as bureaus in Denver, Silicon Valley, and Phoenix operated in partnership with the public television stations in those markets.

In 2005, the show switched distributors from American Public Television, to PBS, in order to avoid the risk of losing affiliates and make the show accessible to the PBS National Programming Service.

Over the years, NBR has received numerous awards. In 2005, for extended coverage of China&#x27;s emergence as an international economic power, and in 2006 the website was honored with a Best In Class award from the International Media Council. Rodney Ward took over from Linda O&#x27;Bryon in 2006 after she had left to join KQED, serving as executive editor and senior vice president through 2011. O&#x27;Bryon eventually became President and Chief Executive Officer of South Carolina ETV; she retired in 2017.

In 2009, NBR began broadcasting in high definition, with broadcasts presented in a letterboxed format for viewers with standard-definition television sets watching either through cable or satellite television. The program also introduced a new set and upconverted its existing graphics package to HD.

Paul Kangas&#x27;s last broadcast for &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot; was on December 31, 2009, ending a 30-year run. The following day, on January 1, 2010, Tom Hudson took over as NBR&#x27;s anchor, broadcasting from Miami, and reporting on topics such as Federal Reserve interest rate policy, corporate governance and shareholder activism as well as providing insights to daily market activity. Prior to co-anchoring &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot;, he was host and managing editor of the nationally syndicated financial television program &quot;First Business&quot;. In July 2011, Hudson was named Managing Editor and Co-anchor, a newly combined position with both editorial and managerial responsibility.

On August 23, 2010, it was announced that WPBT-TV had sold the show to NBR Worldwide Inc., a newly formed, privately held company headed by Mykalai Kontilai, who became the majority owner of the program. Kontilai, an entrepreneur in the Instructional Television Distribution (ITV) industry. Gary Ferrell, a former president and chief executive of North Texas Public Broadcasting (parent company of KERA-TV in Dallas, Texas), is the company&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer. The sale was first proposed in February. According to WPBT, the station would continue to be associated with the show as a presenting station, and the sale reflected their assessment that NBR Worldwide Inc. had &quot;the ideas and resources and potential to take it to the next level&quot; and &quot;can do more things with it than WPBT could.&quot; Rick Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer of WPBT, said the staff and editorial team won&#x27;t change and &quot;Nobody loses their job as a result of this.&quot;
Until the name changed, the program was carried under the &quot;Community Television Foundation of South Florida, Inc.&quot; banner and produced by NBR Enterprises, Inc./WPBT Miami.

Schneider&#x27;s promises proved short-lived. In November 2010, NBR Worldwide Inc. announced a restructuring of the &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot; staff. That restructuring resulted in job cuts for four on-air contributors and half the reporting staff, including Scott Gurvey (New York bureau chief), Stephanie Dhue (Washington), Jeff Yastine (Miami) and Jamila Trindle (Washington DC), in addition to founding producer Jack Kahn and three other behind-the-scenes personnel.

On November 16, 2010, NBR Worldwide Inc. announced the promotions of Rodney Ward from Executive Editor to Executive Vice President of Special Projects. Ward&#x27;s former executive editor duties were assumed by managing editor Wendie Feinberg, who was also promoted to Vice President/Managing Editor. Those changes also did not last long. On July 11, 2011, following the decision of PBS to drop the broadcast from its national schedule and cut all funding, NBR Worldwide Inc. announced the departures of Rodney Ward as Executive Vice President of Special Projects, and Wendie Feinberg, as Vice President/Managing Editor. In a press release, NBR Worldwide said the moves were &quot;...part of its ongoing efforts to streamline operations and maximize resources.&quot; Chief Executive Officer Mykalai Kontilai said Miami-based anchor Tom Hudson would assume the role and title of Managing Editor, in addition to his current on-air duties.

In November 2011, Rick Ray succeeded Kontilai as Chief Executive Officer of NBR Worldwide, Inc. after Kontilai sold the company to Atalaya Capital Management, a private equity firm based out of NYC. In addition, he also became the new executive producer of NBR. Gary Ferrell also departed the company at this time. Several additional members of the editorial staff were also fired. In addition, the show returned to American Public Television after six years on the PBS schedule.

In December 2012, Atalaya fired another seven NBR editorial employees, including Chicago Bureau Chief Diane Eastabrook. The program also announced the complete closing of its Chicago bureau, leaving it with staff reporters only in New York and Washington, D.C. Of the terminated employees, NBR Managing Editor Tom Hudson said, &quot;I consider it an honor to call them colleagues.&quot;

On March 1, 2013, NBR aired its final broadcast under the production of WPBT. Effective March 4, 2013, CNBC would produce NBR. As a result, anchor Tom Hudson and many other correspondents Darren Gersh (Washington DC Bureau Chief) Suzanne Pratt (New York) And Erika Miller (New York) were laid off, and the show&#x27;s Miami studios were shut down as well. CNBC&#x27;s Tyler Mathisen replaced Hudson, and anchored alongside Susie Gharib from CNBC Global Headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Gharib left NBR at the end of 2014 and was replaced with Sue Herera, who was previously Mathisen&#x27;s co-anchor on CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Power Lunch&quot;; Herera would remain with the program until a few weeks before it ended.

On March 12, 2018, Bill Griffeth, formerly co-anchor of CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Closing Bell&quot;, joined &quot;NBR&quot; to replace Tyler Mathisen. Griffeth was reunited with his former &quot;Power Lunch&quot; co-anchor, Sue Herera, on this program.

On November 11, 2019, CNBC announced that NBR would air its last broadcast on December 27, 2019. At the end of that night&#x27;s broadcast, Griffeth made an on-air announcement of the program&#x27;s end, thanking both the public television community and viewers for their support (and ending the program&#x27;s long run by paying homage to longtime anchor Paul Kangas [who had died two years earlier] by playing a clip of his &quot;Best of good buys(pun on goodbyes)&quot; sign-off; the text was an adaptation of a post at the NBR website made earlier that day. After the show was closed, many stations displace the series by simulcasts of &quot;BBC World News&quot;, specifically the &quot;Outside Source&quot; program.

==Title cards and theme music==

The themes and bumper music that were used from 1979 to 1991 were composed by Edd Kalehoff, also known for themes on other television series and game shows. The longest-running theme, also composed by Kalehoff, was used from January 7, 1991 to November 15, 2002. Along with an update to the graphics and presentation, the theme was updated on November 18, 2002 and was used until January 1, 2010. A new theme, logo, and set for the show&#x27;s Miami headquarters debuted on January 4, 2010. This theme lasted until April 27, 2012. On April 30, 2012, a new virtual theme was introduced to the show with new graphics and music. On March 4, 2013, another new set of graphics was introduced, yet the theme music remained the same. On January 4, 2016, the graphics were changed again; this time they were modeled after CNBC&#x27;s current graphics package (which itself had been used since October 2014).

<text>Alberto Rodríguez Larreta (14 January 1934 – 11 March 1977) was a racing driver from Buenos Aires, Argentina. He participated in one World Championship Formula One Grand Prix, the 1960 Argentine Grand Prix on 7 February 1960. Driving a Lotus 16 for Team Lotus, he qualified 15th and finished in ninth place. Larreta was reportedly offered a drive by Colin Chapman, but turned it down and continued competing in a wide variety of other motorsports until 1970. He died from a heart attack in 1977.

<text>The Ada Conformity Assessment Test Suite (ACATS) is the test suite used for Ada processor conformity testing. A prior test suite was known as the Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC).

== ACVC era ==

The Ada Compiler Validation Capability test suite, commonly referred to as the ACVC tests, was the original test suite developed for the Ada language. The ACVC system was organized under the aegis of the Ada Joint Program Office.

The tests were developed by the American company SofTech, beginning around 1980. 
The test suites were modeled on a VAX/VMS system, which was the dominant host platform for such defense-related applications at the time.
Some of the tests were composed using orthogonal Latin squares as an approach towards get the most effective coverage of language feature combinations without employing an exhaustive enumeration of them.

The individual test files were based on the section of the Ada reference manual they pointed to, for instance C45210A.ADA. The suite included both positive tests and negative tests. There was an organization set up to review queries vendors raised as to whether a certain aspect of one or more tests was an accurate reflection of the language standard.

The year 1985 saw the issuing of the first Ada validation certificates. At the height of the language&#x27;s use, which corresponded to the years 1985 through 1993, there were five Ada Validation Facilities around the world that could process vendor ACVC submissions: the Language Control Facility at Wright Patterson Air Force Base (United States), the National Bureau of Standards (United States, soon renamed to the National Institute of Standards), the National Computing Centre (United Kingdom), AFNOR (France), and IABG (Germany). However once Ada use for defense or similar applications began falling, the number of validation contracts fell as well, and several of these facilities became inoperative or transferred their responsibilities.

The Ada Compiler Validation Capability came to an end with the closure of the Ada Joint Program Office in 1998. Ada compiler vendors still wanted a validation mechanism, however, so a new validation system was devised to replace it, the Ada Conformity Assessment Test Suite.

== ACATS era ==

The preface to the test report includes the following:

:Conformity assessment does not ensure that a processor has no nonconformities to the Ada standard other than those, if any, documented in this report. The compiler vendor declares that the tested processor contains no deliberate deviation from the Ada standard; a copy of this Declaration of Conformity is presented immediately after the certificate.

The second paragraph of the background of the current ACAA procedures says:

:It is important to note the scope and intent of conformity assessment. The purpose of conformity assessment is to ensure that Ada processors achieve a high degree of conformity with the Ada standard (Ada95 as corrected by [TC1]). Characteristics such as performance and suitability for a particular application are not specified by the standard, and thus are outside the scope of Ada conformity assessment. Moreover, the ACATS is a set of test programs intended to check broadly for correct implementation; it is not possible to exhaustively test for conformity. Thus, conformity is checked only to the extent of these tests; processors that are certified as conforming may fail to conform to the standard in ways peculiar to each, under particular circumstances.

The ACATS consists of 1821 tests with 255,838 lines of code occupying 30 MB of storage. The test suite is publicly available, for example as a part of the source distribution of the GNU Compiler Collection, which also contains the Ada compiler GNAT.

<doc id="1237356" wikidata="Q555776" url="?curid=1237356" title="Archie Scott Brown">
<text>William Archibald Scott Brown, known as Archie, (13 May 1927 – 19 May 1958) was a British Formula One and sports car racing driver from Scotland who had a prodigious racing ability despite having the fingers of his right hand missing and having to use his palm to drive. He was educated at Clifton Hall School and Merchiston Castle School, in Edinburgh, Scotland. He became known as motorsport&#x27;s first disabled hero and battled considerable adversity (including having his licence revoked) to participate in, and win, some of the most prestigious races of his day, besides being the biggest idol of his compatriot Jim Clark. After being discovered and championed by Brian Lister, he enjoyed great success racing Lister Cars, winning the British Empire Trophy in 1957. In his short career, he scored a total of 71 race victories, 15 of which came from international competition. He participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix on 14 July 1956, scoring no championship points. He also attempted to qualify for the Italian Grand Prix in the same year, but was excluded due to his lack of the required International Licence, his disability precluding the granting of such a licence at the time. 

== Overcoming disability to compete ==

Archie Scott Brown (although often shown as Scott-Brown, the name should not be hyphenated) was born in Paisley on 13 May 1927. As a result of German Measles during his mother&#x27;s pregnancy, he was born with severe disablement to his legs (with his feet twisted almost backwards) and without the fingers of his right hand. Tremendous determination, 22 operations over a two-year period, and months spent in plaster meant that he was able to walk, although he never grew over 5&#x27;0&quot; tall.

After Scott Brown won two races at Snetterton on 3 April 1954, Sid Green of Gilby Engineering noticed that he had an unformed right hand and brought this to the attention of the race stewards. Scott Brown was forthwith banned from motor racing, a devastating blow to the up-and-coming racing driver. It brought his burgeoning career to a sudden halt and his future looked uncertain. However, Earl Howe, the president of the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club, had previously seen Scott Brown driving and had made a note to find out who he was. When he made contact with Scott Brown and discovered that he had subsequently been banned from racing, he supported Scott Brown&#x27;s appeal to the RAC. Dr Benjafield and Gregor Grant, the then-editor of Autosport, also supported Scott Brown&#x27;s appeal. By June 1954, Scott Brown had his licence back.

== Early life ==

Scott Brown took up motor sport early in life after his father built him a small car to aid his mobility. His first competitive race was in 1951, in his own MG roadster, bought using a small legacy. As his reputation grew, his name became closely linked with that of Brian Lister, initially driving Lister&#x27;s Tojeiro special, and later in sports racing cars built by Lister himself, and bearing his name. Scott Brown enjoyed much success driving Lister-Jaguars – the famous &quot;Knobblys&quot;. Known for his courageous driving style, he was often to be seen in corners getting his Lister very sideways indeed. Asked about the possibility of the Lister&#x27;s brakes failing completely, he responded that he would &quot;carry on without them, old boy&quot;. Over the few years he was in the sport, he developed a fierce but good-natured rivalry with rising American driving talent Masten Gregory.

== Death ==

Scott Brown was mortally injured on 18 May 1958 during an accident in a sports car race at Spa-Francorchamps, driving a Lister Knobbly and duelling for the lead with Masten Gregory driving the Ecurie Ecosse Lister Jaguar. Battling hard with Gregory, they swapped the lead between them inches apart. The competition was so fierce that Scott Brown dented his car&#x27;s nose on the rear of the Ecosse car on lap three. With Scott Brown leading on lap six, they arrived at Blanchimont, then in the Clubhouse bend (where Richard Seaman had died in 1939), to find the track slick with rain; the right-hand front wheel of the Lister hit a road sign, snapping the track rod and causing a disastrous accident. Scott Brown died in hospital (Heusy) the following day, less than a week after his 31st birthday.

<text>Brian Newton Shawe-Taylor (28 January 1915 – 1 May 1999) was a British racing driver. He participated in 3 World Championship Grands Prix and numerous non-Championship Formula One races. He scored no World Championship points.

== Early life and education ==
Shawe-Taylor was born in Dublin, Ireland, the younger of two sons of Francis Manley Shawe-Taylor (1869–1920), magistrate and high sheriff for the county of Galway, and his wife, Agnes Mary Eleanor &quot;née&quot; Ussher (1874–1939). His parents were members of the Anglo-Irish ruling classes; he was related to the playwright and co-founder of the Abbey Theatre, Lady Gregory and a cousin of Sir Hugh Lane who founded Dublin&#x27;s gallery of modern art.

Following the murder of the father in 1920 by Irish nationalists, the family moved to England, where Shawe-Taylor attended Shrewsbury School.

== Career ==
Shawe-Taylor started racing before the war, winning the Nuffield Trophy in 1939. After the war he raced an ERA, with which he tried to enter the 1950 British Grand Prix. The organisers deemed his car to be too old, but he managed to take part in the race anyway, by sharing the Maserati 4CL of Joe Fry. The following year, he practiced a Ferrari entered by Tony Vandervell at the 1951 French Grand Prix, but ultimately Reg Parnell drove the car during the race.

His entry was accepted for the 1951 British Grand Prix, despite the fact that he was still campaigning his old ERA, and he finished the race in 8th position as the top privateer, albeit six laps down on the winner. He also raced in the 24 Hours of Le Mans that year, sharing an Aston Martin DB2 with George Abecassis, finishing 5th. He was later seriously injured in an accident at Goodwood, when he spun the ERA and was hit by Toni Branca. Shawe-Taylor recovered but his career was ended.

== Family ==
Shawe-Taylor was the younger brother of the music critic Desmond Shawe-Taylor, and the father of the art historian and Surveyor of the Queen&#x27;s Pictures, the younger Desmond Shawe-Taylor, LVO.

<text>David Rowland John Morgan (7 August 1944 – 6 November 2018) was a British racing driver from England. He participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, the 1975 British Grand Prix in which, like several others, he crashed during a storm in the closing laps. He was classified 18th and thus scored no championship points.

==Driving career==

Prior to his single grand prix entry, Morgan raced a Mini in the mid-1960s, and soon moved on to Formula Three. He incurred a 12-month ban for dangerous driving at the end of 1970, after a last corner collision with James Hunt at Crystal Palace, but was subsequently allowed to progress to Formula Atlantic in 1971. This was followed by two seasons in Formula Two, then a return to Formula Atlantic. After his one Grand Prix, he retired from racing until returning in the British Saloon Car Championship in 1980–1981, driving a Mitsubishi Colt Lancer. Morgan also later worked as an engineer to Eric van de Poele, in both Formula One and Formula 3000.

He died on 6 November 2018, following a stroke.

<doc id="1237359" wikidata="Q171743" url="?curid=1237359" title="David Purley">
<text>David Charles Purley, GM (26 January 1945 – 2 July 1985) was a British racing driver born in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, who participated in 11 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting at Monaco in 1973.

Purley is best known for his actions at the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix, where he abandoned his own race and attempted to save the life of fellow driver Roger Williamson, whose car was upside down and on fire following a serious accident. Purley was awarded the George Medal for his courage in trying to save Williamson, who suffocated in the blaze.

During pre-qualifying for the 1977 British Grand Prix Purley sustained multiple bone fractures after his car&#x27;s throttle stuck open and he crashed into a wall. His deceleration from 108 mph (173 km/h) to 0 in a distance of 26 inches (66 cm) is one of the highest G-loads survived in a crash (180 G). He scored no championship points during his Formula One career. He died in a plane crash, having retired from motorsport and taken up aerobatics, in 1985.

==Early life==
Purley&#x27;s father was Charles Purley, the founder of LEC Refrigeration. Birth and death records show that his father&#x27;s name was originally Puxley but he preferred the name Purley. His mother was Welsh, having been born in the small village of Cwmfelinfach. David went to school at Seaford College and then Dartington Hall School in Devon.

==Career==
Purley joined the British Army and was an Officer Cadet at Sandhurst on Intake 38. Commissioned into the Parachute Regiment, he lost the first of his nine lives when his parachute failed to open on a training jump. Miraculously, he landed on his Platoon Sergeant&#x27;s &#x27;chute and both survived the heavy landing. Having seen action with his Battalion in Aden, he left the Army to pursue a career in motor racing.

He later raced in various series with an AC Cobra and a Chevron, before racing in Formula Three, winning three times at Chimay between 1970 and 1972.

In 1972 Purley was one of two drivers to attempt to race the Connew Grand Prix car in its original Formula One configuration. He was entered at the end of season World Championship Victory Race at Brands Hatch but did not start. Purley had asked for an electrical &quot;kill&quot; switch to be fitted to the steering wheel, but this malfunctioned on the warm up lap, the engine stopped, and the car was retired.

In 1973 Purley hired a March and with backing from his family&#x27;s refrigeration company he made an attempt at Formula One.
At the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix, upon witnessing a crash which left fellow British driver Roger Williamson trapped in his overturned and burning car, Purley abandoned his own race and attempted to save Williamson, who was participating in only his second Formula One race. Purley later recalled that upon arriving at the scene, he heard Williamson crying for help as the fire began to take hold. Purley&#x27;s efforts to right the car and extinguish the flames were in vain as he received no help from nearby track marshals or emergency workers, in spite of attempts to encourage them, and other passing drivers, to come to his aid; Williamson died from asphyxiation. The marshals were not wearing fire resistant clothing and the passing drivers assumed that Purley was attempting to extinguish his own car, having escaped a fiery crash unharmed.

A sequence of pictures taken by photographer Cor Mooij of the accident won the Photo Sequences category of that year&#x27;s World Press Photo. Later, Purley was awarded the George Medal for his rescue attempt. The story, and film footage of the rescue attempt, feature in a 2010 BBC documentary titled &quot;Grand Prix: The Killer Years&quot;.

Apart from a one-off participation with Token at his home Grand Prix in 1974, Purley stayed out of Formula One for a few years, preferring to compete in Formula Two driving Chevrons and Marches for Hong Kong-based millionaire Bob Harper, and Formula 5000 where he won the British Championship in 1976 in a Chevron powered by the Cosworth GA 3.4-litre V6 engine.
In 1974 Purley won the Brighton Speed Trials driving a Trojan-Chevrolet T101, winning again the following year in a Chevron-GA B30.

He returned to Formula One in 1977 with his own LEC chassis designed by Mike Pilbeam and run by Mike Earle. It was this car in which he suffered serious injuries in an accident during practice for that year&#x27;s British Grand Prix. He survived an estimated 179.8 g when he decelerated from 108 mph (173 km/h) to 0 in a distance of 26 inches (66 cm) after his throttle became stuck wide open and he hit a wall. 
Purley recovered to race again, although he confined his activities to the minor Aurora AFX series of Formula One races in Britain. As a result of his earlier accident, Purley&#x27;s left leg was shorter than his right and he underwent innovative corrective surgery in Belgium, from which he again took several months to recover.

Following his decision to quit motorsport, Purley moved into competition aerobatics.

==Death==
Purley died on 2 July 1985 when his Pitts Special aerobatic biplane crashed into the English Channel off Bognor Regis. He is buried in the churchyard of St. Nicholas Church, West Itchenor, near Chichester.

==Legacy==
The remains of Purley&#x27;s crashed LEC CRP1 and its replacement were displayed at the Donington Grand Prix Exhibition until 2011. The second car has since been restored and now competes in historic Formula One racing, alongside a replica car built more recently.

 A David Purley memorial, in the form of a sculpture by the British artist Gordon Young, was erected in 2017 close to the site of the former LEC factory in Bognor Regis. It is inscribed with the words that appear on the headstone of his grave at Itchenor: &quot;Gone now your eager smile, high held head and soldier&#x27;s stride, etched were skies by your elegant style, and this earth enriched by your pride&quot;.

<text>Kim Hyo-jin (; born February 10, 1984) is a South Korean actress and model. She began modeling in teen magazines, and made her acting debut in 1999. She made her theater debut in 2009 in the play &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and followed this up by appearing in the theatrical production &quot;Fool for Love&quot; a year later. She is best known for playing the youngest of the three sisters in sex comedy film &quot;Everybody Has Secrets&quot; (2004), a con artist in the television drama &quot;Private Lives&quot; (2020), and a top star in &quot;Castaway Diva&quot; (2023).

==Early life and education==
Kim Hyo-jin was born on February 10, 1984, in Seoul. She attended Ewha Girls&#x27; High School. In 2002, she enrolled in Undergraduate School of Hanyang University&#x27;s Department of Theatre and Film. On February 22, 2007, Kim, who had her Bachelor Degree, delivered a speech representing the other graduates during the graduation ceremony held at Hanyang University in Haengdang-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul. In September 2007, Kim entered Graduate School of Department of Theatre and Film at Hanyang University.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
Kim began her career as a teen model after being cast at the suggestion of a model agency that happened to see her while she was walking around Dongdaemun. She made her debut as a cover model for the teen magazine Cindy the Perky. After appearing in various commercials and sitcoms, she made her acting debut in the television drama &quot;Love Story&quot; in 1999. She also made her big-screen debut as Jaunbi in the 2003 movie &quot;The Millennium.&quot;

After a series of forgettable roles, she is best known for playing the youngest of the three sisters in sex comedy film &quot;Everybody Has Secrets&quot;, and the female lead in family drama &quot;I Am Happy&quot;.

Though she continues to act in mainstream films and TV dramas such as &quot;Mary Stayed Out All Night&quot;, in recent years Kim has become more adventurous in her choice of projects. She made her theater debut in the plays &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and &quot;Fool for Love&quot;, then made an acting leap into queer cinema. Kim said portraying a bisexual in &quot;Five Senses of Eros&quot; (later expanded to &quot;In My End Is My Beginning&quot;) and a lesbian in &quot;Life is Peachy&quot; was not a problem for her: &quot;I approached the film in this way: Two people meet and fall in love. And the person that I fall in love with happens to be a woman.&quot;

In 2011 Kim replaced Han Chae-young in the Korea-China-Japan joint production &quot;Strangers 6&quot;, which tells the story of six individuals assigned by the highest level authorities of their respective countries to protect the three countries&#x27; joint economic area from being infiltrated by a hostile organization. Filming in Japan was delayed by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the TV series aired on Japan&#x27;s WOWOW TV and Korea&#x27;s Channel A in 2012.

After appearing in Im Sang-soo&#x27;s erotic suspense drama &quot;The Taste of Money&quot;, Kim starred opposite Hidetoshi Nishijima in the Korea-Japan joint production &quot;Genome Hazard&quot;, a film adaptation of Tsukasaki Siro&#x27;s same-titled sci-fi mystery novel.

===Comeback after hiatus===
In 2020, after a long hiatus, she appeared in JTBC&#x27;s television drama &quot;Private Lives&quot;, alongside Seohyun and Go Kyung-pyo, as Jeong Bok-gi/Sophia Chung, a former announcer by the name of Jeong Yoon-kyung. She is a woman who uses other people&#x27;s private lives and become a con woman. It aired on JTBC from October 7 to November 26, 2020 and is available for streaming worldwide on Netflix.

In 2021, Kim acted as Kyung-eun, Jung-soo&#x27;s (Park Byung-eun) first love, in &quot;Lost,&quot; a 2021 television series starring Jeon Do-yeon and Ryu Jun-yeol. It was part of &quot;JTBC&#x27;s Tenth Anniversary Special Project&quot;, it was broadcast from September 4 to October 24, 2021 every Saturday and Sunday at 22:30 (KST).

In 2022, Kim acted as Cheon Na-na in Season 2 of &quot;The Good Detective&quot;. Cheon Na-na is Director of TJ Group born out of wedlock to the group president and treated like an orphan. It aired on JTBC from July 30, 2022 on Saturday and Sunday at 22:30 (KST).

In 2023, Kim act as Yoon Ran-joo, top star and diva in television series &quot;Castaway Diva&quot; directed by Oh Chung-hwan, written by Park Hye-ryun and Eun Yeol, and starring Park Eun-bin, Chae Jong-hyeop, Cha Hak-yeon and Kim Joo-hun. It premiered on tvN from October 28 to December 3, 2023, and aired every Saturday and Sunday at 21:20 (KST) for 12 episodes. It is also available for streaming on Netflix in selected regions.

==Personal life==
Kim first met actor-director Yoo Ji-tae in 2003 when they were models for a clothing brand, and their friendship turned into a romantic relationship in 2006. One of the few Korean star couples who openly admitted their dating status, they are very active in charitable organizations, and in 2011 were both appointed as honorary ambassadors for World Vision.

They announced their engagement in August 2011 (Kim reportedly turned down a movie role to prepare for her upcoming nuptials), and subsequently released pre-wedding photos. Their minimalist invitation was made from environmentally friendly paper and had the number 1,825 written on it, the exact amount of the days the two have spent together as a couple. They were married at the Shilla Hotel in Seoul on December 2, 2011. The date marked the couple&#x27;s fifth anniversary together and was booked by Yoo one year in advance despite landing on a Friday – an unusual day for a wedding. The ceremony was officiated by the president of World Vision Korea; Yoo and Kim then donated a portion of their monetary gifts to the organization to help build an elementary and middle school in Myanmar. The couple have two sons, born on July 5, 2014, and April 15, 2019.

Kim adheres to a vegetarian diet for ethical and health reasons.

<text>Gianfranco Comotti (24 July 1906 – 10 May 1963) was an Italian racing driver. He participated in two World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 3 September 1950. He scored no championship points. He also participated in numerous non-Championship Formula One races.

==Racing career==
A native of Bergamo, he first appeared at the 1928 Italian Grand Prix in one of Scuderia Materassi’s Talbots. After this race Comotti disappeared from the racing scene, later withdrawing his entry into the 1929 Indianapolis 500. He returned in 1931, winning the cyclecar race at the Circuito di Alessandria in a Salmson. He then brought an Alfa Romeo Monza sports car to Scuderia Ferrari in Modena for servicing and became an official driver for the team in 1932. In 1934 Comotti won the Grand Prix du Comminges for Ferrari. Later that year he finished third at the 1934 Italian Grand Prix together with Carlo Felice Trossi. Comotti continued to drive for Ferrari until the end of 1935.

In 1937 Comotti moved to France and joined the Talbot team as a test driver. He tested cars for clients and was a reserve driver for the racing team. That year he won the RAC Tourist Trophy at Donington Park. Comotti left the team at the end of the season and joined Laurie and Lucy Schell&#x27;s Ecurie Bleue racing for 1938, driving a Delahaye. That year he made his first Grand Prix start at Germany, and also made his only start at Le Mans. But he retired early in both races.

After the war Comotti became a test driver of the new Talbot-Lago T26C. He also made some Grand Prix start with that car in 1948. In 1950 Comotti became a test driver for Scuderia Milano and also made his first World Championship Formula One Grands Prix at the Italian Grand Prix. He made his second and last World Championship Grand Prix start at the 1952 French Grand Prix, driving a Ferrari for Scuderia Marzotto.

Comotti was one of nine founders of the &quot;Club international des anciens pilotes de Grand Prix F1&quot; (1962).

==Personal life==
Comotti was born in Brescia, but grew up in Bergamo. He worked in the oil business for his entire life. In 1932 he married Anna Maria Peduzzi (1912–79), who was one of the best female drivers of Italy. Her career lasted even longer than her husband’s.

After his retirement from racing he worked for BP in North Africa.

<doc id="1237381" wikidata="Q916078" url="?curid=1237381" title="Blackmail (1929 film)">
<text>Blackmail is a 1929 British crime thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Anny Ondra, John Longden, and Cyril Ritchard. Based on the 1928 play of the same name by Charles Bennett, the film is about a London woman who is blackmailed after killing a man who tries to rape her.

After starting production as a silent film, British International Pictures decided to adapt &quot;Blackmail&quot; into a separate sound film. It became the first successful European talkie; a silent version was released for cinemas not equipped for sound (at 6,740 feet), with the sound version (7,136 feet) released at the same time. Both versions are held in the British Film Institute collection.

&quot;Blackmail&quot; is frequently cited as the first British sound feature film. It was voted the best British film of 1929 in a UK poll the year it was released. In 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Blackmail&quot; as the 59th best British film ever.

==Plot==

On 26 April 1929, Scotland Yard Detective Frank Webber escorts his girlfriend Alice White to a tea house. They have an argument and Frank storms out. While reconsidering his action, he sees Alice leave with Mr. Crewe, an artist she had earlier agreed to meet.

Crewe persuades a reluctant Alice into coming up to see his studio. She admires a painting of a laughing clown, and uses his palette and brushes to paint a cartoonish drawing of a face; he adds a few strokes of a naked feminine figure, and guiding her hand, they sign the picture with her name. He gives her a dancer&#x27;s outfit and Crewe sings and plays &quot;Miss Up-to-Date&quot; on the piano.

Crewe steals a kiss, to Alice&#x27;s disgust, but as she is changing and preparing to leave, he takes her dress from the changing area. He attempts to rape her; her cries for help are not heard on the street below. In desperation, Alice grabs a nearby bread knife and kills him. She angrily tears a hole in the painting of the clown, then leaves after attempting to remove any evidence of her presence in the flat, but accidentally leaves her gloves behind. She walks the streets of London all night in a daze.

When the body is found, Frank is assigned to the case and finds one of Alice&#x27;s gloves. He also recognizes the dead man, but conceals this from his superior. Taking the glove, he goes to see Alice at her father&#x27;s tobacco shop, but she is too distraught to speak.

As they speak privately in the shop&#x27;s telephone booth, Tracy arrives. He had seen Alice go up to Crewe&#x27;s flat, and he has the other glove. When he sees Frank with the other one, he attempts to blackmail them. His first demands are petty ones, and they accede. Frank learns by phone that Tracy is wanted for questioning: he was seen near the scene and has a criminal record. Frank sends for policemen and tells Tracy he will pay for the murder.

Alice is apprehensive, but still does not speak up. The tension mounts. When the police arrive, Tracy&#x27;s nerve finally breaks and he flees. The chase leads to the British Museum, where he clambers onto the domed roof of the Reading Room and slips, crashing through a skylight and falling to his death inside. The police assume he was the murderer.

Unaware of this, Alice feels compelled to give herself up and goes to see the Chief Inspector at New Scotland Yard. Before she can confess to him, the inspector receives a telephone call and asks Frank to deal with Alice. She finally tells Frank the truth—that it was self-defense against an attack she cannot bear to speak of—and they leave together. As they do, a policeman walks past, carrying the damaged painting of the laughing clown and the cartoon canvas where Alice painted over her name.

==Production==
The film began production as a silent film. To cash in on the new popularity of talkies, the film&#x27;s producer, John Maxwell of British International Pictures, gave Hitchcock the go-ahead to film a portion of the movie in sound. Most sources state that Hitchcock thought the idea absurd and surreptitiously filmed almost the entire feature in sound, but in reality the silent version - which was largely completed - was cleverly used for several sequences with non-synchronous sound and dialogue where the actors faces were not visible. 

The opening 6 minutes of the sound version are silent, with musical accompaniment, as are numerous shorter scenes later, and the entire final chase sequence is from the silent version with occasional non-synchronized vocal interjections, including Donald Calthrop&#x27;s last words on the dome of the British Museum&#x27;s reading room. Thus it can be argued that the sound version of &quot;Blackmail&quot;, despite BIP&#x27;s publicity, is a &quot;part-talkie&quot;. Gaumont-British&#x27;s &quot;High Treason&quot;, directed by Maurice Elvey was also turned into a sound film mid-way during production. Much like &quot;Blackmail&quot;, much of the silent footage in &quot;High Treason&quot; was maintained and dubbed over for the sound version, with Elvey himself voicing some of the minor characters.

&quot;Blackmail&quot;, marketed as one of Britain&#x27;s earliest &quot;all-talkie&quot; feature films, was recorded in the RCA Photophone sound-on-film process. (The first U.S. all-talking film, &quot;Lights of New York&quot;, was released in July 1928 by Warner Brothers in their Vitaphone sound-on-disc process.) The film was shot at British and Dominions Imperial Studios soundstage in Borehamwood, the first purpose-built sound studio in Europe.

Lead actress Anny Ondra was raised in Prague and had a pronounced Czech accent that was felt unsuitable for the film. Sound was in its infancy at the time and it was not possible to post-dub her voice. Rather than replace her and reshoot her scenes, actress Joan Barry was hired to speak the dialogue off-camera while Ondra lip-synched her lines. This makes Ondra&#x27;s performance seem slightly awkward.

Hitchcock used several elements that would become Hitchcock &quot;trademarks&quot; including a beautiful blonde in peril and a famous landmark in the finale. Without informing the producers, Hitchcock used the Schüfftan process to film the scenes in the Reading Room of the British Museum since the light levels were too low for normal filming.

The film was a critical and commercial hit. The sound was praised as inventive. A completed silent version of &quot;Blackmail&quot; was released in 1929 shortly after the talkie version hit theaters. The silent version of &quot;Blackmail&quot; actually ran longer in theaters and proved more popular, largely because most theaters in Britain were not yet equipped for sound. Despite the popularity of the silent version, history best remembers the landmark talkie version of &quot;Blackmail&quot;. It is the version now generally available although some critics consider the silent version superior. Alfred Hitchcock filmed the silent version with Sam Livesey as the Chief Inspector and the sound version with Harvey Braban in the same role.

===Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo===

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo, a signature occurrence in many of Hitchcock&#x27;s films, shows him being bothered by a small boy as he reads a book on the London Underground. This is probably the lengthiest of Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo appearances and he appears around 10 minutes after the start. As the director became better known to audiences, especially when he appeared as the host of his own television series, he dramatically shortened his on-screen appearances.

==Release and reception==
First screened to press and cinema distributors on 21 June 1929 at the Regal at Marble Arch, the film premiered at the Capitol Cinema in London on 28 July 1929. &quot;Blackmail&quot; was one of the most successful releases of that year, and received critical praise.

In a public poll, &quot;Blackmail&quot; was voted the best British film of 1929, largely on the basis of the silent version, which, as mentioned above, was more widely seen. In the same national UK poll, the best films of their respective years were &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; (1928), &quot;Rookery Nook&quot; (1930), &quot;The Middle Watch&quot; (1931), and &quot;Sunshine Susie&quot; (1932).

==Legacy==
As an early sound film, &quot;Blackmail&quot; frequently is cited by film historians as a landmark film, and is often cited as the first truly British &quot;all-talkie&quot; feature film. Two future directors worked on this production: Ronald Neame operated the clapperboard and Michael Powell took on-set publicity photographs.

Earlier British part-sound films include:
* &quot;The Gentleman&quot;, a short film in the Phonofilm sound-on-film process, was an excerpt of &quot;The 9 to 11 Revue&quot;, directed by William J. Elliott, and released in the UK in June 1925.
* The part-sound &quot;The Clue of the New Pin&quot;, based on the novel by Edgar Wallace, and filmed in British Phototone, a sound-on-disc system using 12-inch discs.
* &quot;The Crimson Circle&quot;, a UK-German silent film, also based on a Wallace novel, dubbed after the fact with the Phonofilm sound-on-film process.
* &quot;Black Waters&quot;, a British-produced sound film shot in the US with an almost exclusively American cast and crew, and released on 6 April 1929.

In March 1929, &quot;New Pin&quot; and &quot;Crimson Circle&quot; were trade-shown at the same screening for film exhibitors in London.

The plot of &quot;Downton Abbey: A New Era&quot; (2022), produced by Ronald Neame&#x27;s grandson Gareth Neame, is partly inspired by &quot;Blackmail&quot;.

==Preservation status and home media==
A restoration of &quot;Blackmail&quot;&#x27;s silent version was completed in 2012, as part of the BFI&#x27;s £2 million &quot;Save the Hitchcock 9&quot; project to restore all of the director&#x27;s surviving silent films.

At the beginning of 2025, &quot;Blackmail&quot; entered the public domain in the United States.

<doc id="1237393" wikidata="Q898951" url="?curid=1237393" title="Ligand field theory">
<text>Ligand field theory (LFT) describes the bonding, orbital arrangement, and other characteristics of coordination complexes. It represents an application of molecular orbital theory to transition metal complexes. A transition metal ion has nine valence atomic orbitals - consisting of five &quot;n&quot;d, one (&quot;n&quot;+1)s, and three (&quot;n&quot;+1)p orbitals. These orbitals have the appropriate energy to form bonding interactions with ligands. The LFT analysis is highly dependent on the geometry of the complex, but most explanations begin by describing octahedral complexes, where six ligands coordinate with the metal. Other complexes can be described with reference to crystal field theory. Inverted ligand field theory (ILFT) elaborates on LFT by breaking assumptions made about relative metal and ligand orbital energies.

==History==
Ligand field theory resulted from combining the principles laid out in molecular orbital theory and crystal field theory, which describe the loss of degeneracy of metal d orbitals in transition metal complexes. John Stanley Griffith and Leslie Orgel championed ligand field theory as a more accurate description of such complexes, although the theory originated in the 1930s with the work on magnetism by John Hasbrouck Van Vleck. Griffith and Orgel used the electrostatic principles established in crystal field theory to describe transition metal ions in solution and used molecular orbital theory to explain the differences in metal-ligand interactions, thereby explaining such observations as crystal field stabilization and visible spectra of transition metal complexes. In their paper, they proposed that the chief cause of color differences in transition metal complexes in solution is the incomplete d orbital subshells. That is, the unoccupied d orbitals of transition metals participate in bonding, which influences the colors they absorb in solution. In ligand field theory, the various d orbitals are affected differently when surrounded by a field of neighboring ligands and are raised or lowered in energy based on the strength of their interaction with the ligands.

==Bonding==
===σ-bonding (sigma bonding)===

In an octahedral complex, the molecular orbitals created by coordination can be seen as resulting from the donation of two electrons by each of six σ-donor ligands to the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals on the metal. In octahedral complexes, ligands approach along the &quot;x&quot;-, &quot;y&quot;- and &quot;z&quot;-axes, so their σ-symmetry orbitals form bonding and anti-bonding combinations with the &quot;d&quot;&quot;z&quot;2 and &quot;d&quot;&quot;x&quot;2−&quot;y&quot;2 orbitals. The &quot;d&quot;&quot;xy&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;xz&quot; and &quot;d&quot;&quot;yz&quot; orbitals remain non-bonding orbitals. Some weak bonding (and anti-bonding) interactions with the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; orbitals of the metal also occur, to make a total of 6 bonding (and 6 anti-bonding) molecular orbitals

In molecular symmetry terms, the six lone-pair orbitals from the ligands (one from each ligand) form six symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of orbitals, also sometimes called ligand group orbitals (LGOs). The irreducible representations that these span are &quot;a1g&quot;, &quot;t1u&quot; and &quot;eg&quot;. The metal also has six valence orbitals that span these irreducible representations - the s orbital is labeled &quot;a1g&quot;, a set of three p-orbitals is labeled &quot;t1u&quot;, and the &quot;d&quot;&quot;z&quot;2 and &quot;d&quot;&quot;x&quot;2−&quot;y&quot;2 orbitals are labeled &quot;eg&quot;. The six σ-bonding molecular orbitals result from the combinations of ligand SALCs with metal orbitals of the same symmetry.

===π-bonding (pi bonding)===

π bonding in octahedral complexes occurs in two ways: via any ligand &quot;p&quot;-orbitals that are not being used in σ bonding, and via any π or π* molecular orbitals present on the ligand.

In the usual analysis, the &quot;p&quot;-orbitals of the metal are used for σ bonding (and have the wrong symmetry to overlap with the ligand p or π or π* orbitals anyway), so the π interactions take place with the appropriate metal &quot;d&quot;-orbitals, i.e. &quot;d&quot;&quot;xy&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;xz&quot; and &quot;d&quot;&quot;yz&quot;. These are the orbitals that are non-bonding when only σ bonding takes place.

One important π bonding in coordination complexes is metal-to-ligand π bonding, also called π backbonding. It occurs when the LUMOs (lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals) of the ligand are anti-bonding π* orbitals. These orbitals are close in energy to the &quot;d&quot;&quot;xy&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;xz&quot; and &quot;d&quot;&quot;yz&quot; orbitals, with which they combine to form bonding orbitals (i.e. orbitals of lower energy than the aforementioned set of &quot;d&quot;-orbitals). The corresponding anti-bonding orbitals are higher in energy than the anti-bonding orbitals from σ bonding so, after the new π bonding orbitals are filled with electrons from the metal &quot;d&quot;-orbitals, ΔO has increased and the bond between the ligand and the metal strengthens. The ligands end up with electrons in their π* molecular orbital, so the corresponding π bond within the ligand weakens.

The other form of coordination π bonding is ligand-to-metal bonding. This situation arises when the π-symmetry &quot;p&quot; or π orbitals on the ligands are filled. They combine with the &quot;d&quot;&quot;xy&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;xz&quot; and &quot;d&quot;&quot;yz&quot; orbitals on the metal and donate electrons to the resulting π-symmetry bonding orbital between them and the metal. The metal-ligand bond is somewhat strengthened by this interaction, but the complementary anti-bonding molecular orbital from ligand-to-metal bonding is not higher in energy than the anti-bonding molecular orbital from the σ bonding. It is filled with electrons from the metal &quot;d&quot;-orbitals, however, becoming the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) of the complex. For that reason, ΔO decreases when ligand-to-metal bonding occurs.

The greater stabilization that results from metal-to-ligand bonding is caused by the donation of negative charge away from the metal ion, towards the ligands. This allows the metal to accept the σ bonds more easily. The combination of ligand-to-metal σ-bonding and metal-to-ligand
π-bonding is a synergic effect, as each enhances the other.

As each of the six ligands has two orbitals of π-symmetry, there are twelve in total. The symmetry adapted linear combinations of these fall into four triply degenerate irreducible representations, one of which is of &quot;t2g&quot; symmetry. The &quot;d&quot;&quot;xy&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;xz&quot; and &quot;d&quot;&quot;yz&quot; orbitals on the metal also have this symmetry, and so the π-bonds formed between a central metal and six ligands also have it (as these π-bonds are just formed by the overlap of two sets of orbitals with &quot;t2g&quot; symmetry.)

==High and low spin and the spectrochemical series==

The six bonding molecular orbitals that are formed are &quot;filled&quot; with the electrons from the ligands, and electrons from the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals of the metal ion occupy the non-bonding and, in some cases, anti-bonding MOs. The energy difference between the latter two types of MOs is called ΔO (O stands for octahedral) and is determined by the nature of the π-interaction between the ligand orbitals with the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals on the central atom. As described above, π-donor ligands lead to a small ΔO and are called weak- or low-field ligands, whereas π-acceptor ligands lead to a large value of ΔO and are called strong- or high-field ligands. Ligands that are neither π-donor nor π-acceptor give a value of ΔO somewhere in-between.

The size of ΔO determines the electronic structure of the &quot;d&quot;4 - &quot;d&quot;7 ions. In complexes of metals with these &quot;d&quot;-electron configurations, the non-bonding and anti-bonding molecular orbitals can be filled in two ways: one in which as many electrons as possible are put in the non-bonding orbitals before filling the anti-bonding orbitals, and one in which as many unpaired electrons as possible are put in. The former case is called low-spin, while the latter is called high-spin. A small ΔO can be overcome by the energetic gain from not pairing the electrons, leading to high-spin. When ΔO is large, however, the spin-pairing energy becomes negligible by comparison and a low-spin state arises.

The spectrochemical series is an empirically-derived list of ligands ordered by the size of the splitting Δ that they produce. It can be seen that the low-field ligands are all π-donors (such as I−), the high field ligands are π-acceptors (such as CN− and CO), and ligands such as H2O and NH3, which are neither, are in the middle.

I− &lt; Br− &lt; S2− &lt; SCN− &lt; Cl− &lt; NO3− &lt; N3− &lt; F− &lt; OH− &lt; C2O42− &lt; H2O &lt; NCS− &lt; CH3CN &lt; py (pyridine) &lt; NH3 &lt; en (ethylenediamine) &lt; bipy (2,2&#x27;-bipyridine) &lt; phen (1,10-phenanthroline) &lt; NO2− &lt; PPh3 &lt; CN− &lt; CO

<doc id="1237394" wikidata="Q264901" url="?curid=1237394" title="Anne of Green Gables (1985 film)">
<text>Anne of Green Gables is a 1985 Canadian made-for-television drama film based on the 1908 novel of the same name by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery, and is the first in a series of four films. The film stars Megan Follows in the title role of Anne Shirley and was produced and directed by Kevin Sullivan for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It was released theatrically in Iran, Israel, Europe, and Japan.

The film aired on CBC Television as a two-part mini-series on 1 and 2 December 1985. Both parts of the film were among the highest-rated programs of any genre ever to air on a Canadian television network. On February 17, 1986, the film aired on PBS in the US on the series &quot;WonderWorks&quot;. The film achieved high ratings in the United Kingdom when it aired on New Year’s Day in 1987.

==Plot==
Female Orphan Anne Shirley lives with the Hammond family in Nova Scotia. After Mr. Hammond dies of a heart attack, she is sent back to the orphanage by Mrs. Hammond and is later adopted by a family in Prince Edward Island. Upon arriving in the small town of Avonlea, she is met at the train station by the elderly Matthew Cuthbert, who is surprised to find her there. Matthew and his sister Marilla had originally requested a boy to help them on their farm, Green Gables, but Anne was sent to them by mistake.

Marilla puts Anne &quot;on trial&quot; before deciding whether to keep her or send her back. Anne soon loses her temper with Marilla&#x27;s friend and town gossip Rachel Lynde, who criticizes her looks and red hair. Preferring to return to the orphanage, Anne refuses to apologize, but Matthew convinces her to do so in order to remain at Green Gables. Rachel accepts the apology and suggests to Marilla that Anne attend a Sunday School picnic so she can meet other children. At the picnic, Anne becomes &quot;bosom&quot; friends with Diana Barry from across the pond. There, another kid, Gilbert Blythe, shows an interest in her. At school, Gilbert tries to get her attention by making fun of her red hair and calling her &quot;Carrots&quot;. Angered, Anne smashes a slate over his head. She vows never to forgive him and tries to salvage her pride by dyeing her hair black. However, it instead turns green. After finding out what happened, Marilla decides that Anne will stay at Green Gables.

Anne invites Diana to a tea party, where she accidentally serves currant wine instead of raspberry cordial and gets Diana drunk. Diana&#x27;s mother, Mrs. Barry, thinks the mix-up was intentional and forbids the girls from seeing each other again. Meanwhile, Miss Muriel Stacey becomes the new Avonlea schoolteacher. She wants Anne to join a special class for students who want to take the entrance exam for Queen&#x27;s Academy in Charlottetown.

While Marilla is away at a political event, Diana arrives in a panic and tells Anne and Matthew that her little sister Minnie May is sick with croup. Anne treats the girl with ipecac and saves her life. Mrs. Barry is grateful and invites Anne to a Christmas ball in Carmody overnight as an apology for forbidding her to see Diana. Anne sees Gilbert at the dance but is not willing to befriend him. She also meets Josephine Barry, who is intrigued by Anne, and invites her and Diana to visit her mansion in Charlottetown, where Anne takes the Queen&#x27;s entrance exam.

In Avonlea, Anne and her friends recreate Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;, with Anne playing the role of Elaine the Lily Maid. While floating down the river, her boat springs a leak and sinks, leaving her helplessly clinging to a bridge. Gilbert comes rowing by and rescues her, then reveals that they have tied for first place on the Queen&#x27;s entrance exam. He asks her to forgive him for what he said before and insists he wants to be her friend, but Anne still refuses to forgive Gilbert.

Anne heads to Charlottetown to continue her education at Queen&#x27;s and obtain a teacher&#x27;s license. She finds out that the graduate who receives the highest mark in English literature wins the Avery scholarship, $250 for four years, which she plans to use to get an arts degree at Redmond College. When the results come in, she is the winner of the scholarship. At Avonlea, she finds out that Gilbert&#x27;s father cannot afford to send him to college, so he will be teaching at the Avonlea school to earn his way. One evening at dusk, Anne walks in the fields before Matthew, who is tugging on a stubborn cow. He suffers a heart attack and collapses while Anne rushes to his side. Matthew tells Anne how proud he is of her and how much he loves her before he peacefully dies. 

Later that night, Marilla overhears Anne sobbing in her room and goes to comfort her, saying that she did not know what she would have done if Anne had not come and that she loved her as Matthew did, but had trouble showing her true feelings. Marilla considers selling Green Gables since her eyesight is failing, and she may go blind. However, Anne reveals that she has declined the Avery scholarship. Instead of going to Redmond, she will study by correspondence while teaching in Carmody. Marilla reveals that Gilbert&#x27;s father was an old beau of hers with whom she quarreled, and she wishes she had forgiven him when she had the chance, hinting to Anne that she should do the same with Gilbert. Later, Gilbert explains that he asked the trustees to let Anne have the Avonlea school and give Carmody to him, so Anne can stay at Green Gables and help Marilla. He will also be taking courses by correspondence and asks for Anne&#x27;s help in studying. The two friends make up for good and Gilbert walks Anne home.

==Production==
Kevin Sullivan adapted the novel into his own screenplay, collaborating with industry veteran Joe Wiesenfeld. Sullivan developed a co-production between the CBC and PBS in order to film &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;. Sullivan amalgamated many of Montgomery&#x27;s episodes into the film&#x27;s plot. While the film diverged from Montgomery&#x27;s original, he relied on strong characterizations and visuals in order to render the story for a contemporary audience. The script also borrows ideas from the 1934 film version.

Primary locations for filming the movie included Prince Edward Island; Stouffville, Ontario; Jacksons Point, Ontario; and Westfield Heritage Village near the Flamborough village of Rockton. Filming was done over a consecutive ten-week shoot. Sullivan used several locations as Green Gables farm and combined them to appear as one property.

The original film and sequels (including &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; and the animated Anne films and series covering over 130 hours of production) have been seen in almost every country around the world. The films have now been translated and seen in more places than even the original novels.

During filming of the original movies an open casting call was held throughout Canada in order to find a young actress to play Anne Shirley. Katharine Hepburn recommended that her great niece, Schuyler Grant, play the role of Anne Shirley. Director Kevin Sullivan liked Grant&#x27;s performance and wanted to give her the role. However, broadcast executives were resistant to cast an American as a Canadian icon. Schuyler Grant ended up playing Anne&#x27;s best friend, Diana, and Anne Shirley was ultimately played by Megan Follows.

In her first audition, Megan Follows came highly recommended, but she was quickly dismissed by Kevin Sullivan. For her second audition, after a turbulent morning leading up to her audition, a frantic Megan made a much better impression and was given the role.

==Sequels and spin-off TV series==
===Film series===

In 1987, &quot;Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel&quot; (also called &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;) was released. The sequel is a conglomeration of Montgomery&#x27;s novels &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;, &quot;Anne of the Island&quot;, and &quot;Anne of Windy Poplars&quot;. Megan Follows, Colleen Dewhurst, Jonathan Crombie, Schuyler Grant, and Patricia Hamilton all reprised their roles.

The third film, &quot;Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story&quot;, aired in 2000 with the intent of bringing Anne into a time frame that had been developed over the years in the spin-off series &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;. As such, the plot disregarded &quot;Anne&#x27;s House of Dreams&quot; – the corresponding Anne novel – in favor of an original story not featured in Montgomery&#x27;s series. Follows, Crombie, and Grant returned for the final time as Anne, Gilbert, and Diana.

In 2008, the fourth entry in the series, a prequel film entitled &quot;Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning&quot; was completed, starring Barbara Hershey, Shirley MacLaine, and Rachel Blanchard, with Hannah Endicott-Douglas playing the young Anne.

====Spin-off series====
The first two &quot;Anne&quot; films generated the spin-off television series &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; (1990–1996), starring Sarah Polley. The show explored the lives of residents in the town of Avonlea, drawing inspiration from Montgomery&#x27;s work beyond the &quot;Anne&quot; books. The main characters and early episodes were inspired by &quot;The Story Girl&quot; and &quot;The Golden Road&quot;, with many other episodes based on short stories from &quot;Chronicles of Avonlea&quot; and &quot;Further Chronicles of Avonlea&quot;. Anne did not appear, but other characters, including Gilbert, Marilla, Rachel Lynde, and Miss Stacy, played supporting parts with the same actors reprising their roles. Jackie Burroughs, Cedric Smith, and Mag Ruffman returned as main cast members, but in different roles than the original films.

In 1998, the reunion television special &quot;An Avonlea Christmas&quot; aired, set in Avonlea during World War I.

===Other productions===
From 2000 until 2001, Sullivan Animation produced &quot;Anne of Green Gables: The Animated Series&quot; consisting of 26 half-hour episodes. The series was developed for PBS and each episode contained an educational and/or moral component. In 2005, Sullivan Animation also produced the feature-length animated film &quot;Anne: Journey to Green Gables&quot; which is an imaginative, whimsical prequel to Sullivan&#x27;s live action &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; film.

A year after the mini-series originally aired, Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster created and starred in a parody entitled &quot;Sam of Green Gables,&quot; in which a curmudgeonly old man named Sam is sent to Green Gables instead of Anne.

==Home media==
The &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; series was released on DVD in a collector&#x27;s edition set on February 5, 2008 in the US, April 29, 2008 in Canada and Japan and on September 22, 2010 in Hungary. The set is the most comprehensive edition of all three movies ever released. In addition to the series, it also includes several DVD extras such as feature length commentary from director Kevin Sullivan and Stefan Scaini, 2 New Documentaries: L.M. Montgomery&#x27;s Island and Kevin Sullivan&#x27;s Classic featuring new cast and crew interviews, missing scenes, lost footage and a condensed, 10-minute version of the missing &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; episode &quot;Marilla Cuthbert&#x27;s Death&quot;.

In 2016, Sullivan Entertainment announced it would launch their own streaming service called &quot;Gazebo TV&quot; that would feature the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; series among other titles produced by the company. The service launched in early 2017.

==Lawsuits==
In 1908, Lucy Maud Montgomery signed a contract with the L.C. Page &amp; Company publishing house in Boston that permitted them to publish all of her books for 5 years on the same terms: the main terms were a 10% royalty and world rights to all of the author&#x27;s books; plus it also included the right to publish all of her future works. The relationship with Pageant actually spanned nearly ten years and resulted in the publication of nine novels and collections of short stories. However, when Montgomery contracted with a Canadian publisher (McClelland, Goodchild and Stewart), L.C. Page claimed that they had the exclusive rights to her new books and threatened to sue her. Montgomery instead took L.C. Page to court to recover withheld royalties.

The lawsuit resulted in a settlement in 1919 whereby L.C. Page bought out all of Montgomery&#x27;s rights to all of her novels published by them. The settlement excluded any reversionary rights that might become due for the benefit of either her or her heirs if such rights were to become enacted. The settlement paid Montgomery a flat sum of $18,000; at the time an amount she would have expected to see earned from her works during her lifetime.

Sullivan purchased dramatic rights from Montgomery&#x27;s heirs in 1984, believing that they owned reversionary rights that had come into place as a result of changes to the copyright act subsequent to Montgomery&#x27;s death.

After Sullivan&#x27;s films were successful around the world and brought legions of tourists to Prince Edward Island, the Montgomery heirs established an Anne of Green Gables Licensing Authority with the Province of Prince Edward Island to control trademarks to preserve Montgomery&#x27;s works, through the mechanism of official trademarks. The heirs and the AGGLA became successful at asserting control over the booming Anne-themed tourist industry that the province enjoyed, because of the lack of clarity about the different protections afforded by copyright, trademark and official marks in Canada.

AGGLA and the heirs tried to assert control over trademarks Sullivan had established to their various Anne movies (&quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;, &quot;Anne of Green Gables—the Continuing Story&quot;) and &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; properties both in Canada, the US and Japan.

A Japanese court then determined that the heirs were not entitled to the reversionary rights that they claimed they had sold to Sullivan and that the AGGLA was set up for pursuing private interests and not for serving public interests such as maintaining or managing the value, fame or reputation of the literary work, the author or even the main character of Anne. The Court determined that the AGGLA was the heirs&#x27; private profit-seeking enterprise as far as its activities were concerned.

Sullivan and the heirs came into further conflict during the 1990s. Sullivan was sued by the heirs. Their contractual agreement with Sullivan said that he would pay them a flat $425,000 (CAD) fee for the right to adapt the first book (and another $100,000 to do the second movie, &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;), plus 10% of the profits of Anne 1 and 5% of the profits of Anne 2. The contract also gave them the right to examine Sullivan Entertainment&#x27;s financial records. However, when Sullivan claimed that neither of the movies had earned a net profit and (the heirs assert) refused to allow them to audit his books, they served a claim against him. Sullivan argued that the heirs and the AGGLA had enjoined the films by usurping the Sullivan trademarks and drastically reduced the profitability of the ventures. The heirs staged a press conference in 1998 at exactly the time when Sullivan was about to close a public offering to take his company public, to force Sullivan to pay them further receipts. The offering however was pulled by the underwriters and Sullivan counter-sued for libel, insisting that the heirs should pay damages of $55 million to all parties involved. A Superior Court of Ontario judge dismissed his suit on January 19, 2004. The Montgomery heirs subsequently dropped their claim for Sullivan to pay them any royalties. However, a settlement between Sullivan, the Montgomery heirs and the AGGLA was reached in 2006 to deal with all of their outstanding disagreements. Although Kevin Sullivan&#x27;s works were initially based upon the works of Montgomery, Sullivan developed most of his successful Anne-related film properties (&quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;, &quot;Anne -the Continuing Story&quot;, &quot;Anne – A New Beginning&quot; and &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;) based on original material, not directly adapted from Montgomery&#x27;s books. Many questions have been raised in court as to the author&#x27;s heirs&#x27; rights in her copyright. The heirs have tried to extend the copyright in Montgomery&#x27;s unpublished works until 2017 but lost that opportunity in 2004 when the Canadian Parliament rejected the provision they had pursued so ardently for the unpublished works of dead authors.
In a Japanese court decision which addressed the heirs&#x27; challenge to the validity of Sullivan&#x27;s ownership of Japanese trademark&#x27;s in the movie property, the Japanese High Court commented on the heirs&#x27; entitlement to reversionary copyright which formed the basis of the rights that the family claimed to have sold to Sullivan. The Court stated that the heirs&#x27; reversionary copyright was non-existent and that there was no need for Sullivan or any other entity to account to the heirs for the use of the trademark in Japan.

The Court stated: &quot;It is not clear from a legal point of view why permission from the heirs of the author or its related entity the Anne of Green Gables Licensing (AGGLA) authority was necessary.&quot;

The Japanese Court also extensively scrutinized whether the copyright in the book &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; had ever devolved to the heirs and called for extensive filing of evidence on this point. Sullivan filed an original 1919 agreement between Montgomery and L.C. Page &amp; Co. which specifically excluded the heirs&#x27; reversionary claims. Montgomery sold all of her publishing and copyright to her series of novels, in perpetuity, to her original American publisher in 1919, to the exclusion of her heirs.

The Court further questioned whether the heirs&#x27; licensing authority was engaged in activities of sufficient public interest as to qualify as a controlling body of Montgomery&#x27;s works. The Court stated: &quot;...the possibility cannot be denied that the Anne of Green Gables Licensing Authority is the heirs&#x27; private profit-seeking enterprise as far as the activities with which the heirs of the subject case are involved are concerned. It is not proved from the evidence submitted in the subject case that the Anne of Green Gables Licensing Authority is involved in activities of public interest that are sufficient for the Anne of Green Gables Licensing Authority to be qualified as the owner of the registration of the subject mark as a controlling body of the subject literary work.&quot;

==Trademark and copyright==
After recent speculation as to who owned the copyrights and trademarks concerning &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; today, there are principally two entities that control rights relating to &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;. The Anne of Green Gables Licensing Authority (AGGLA – which includes Lucy Maud Montgomery&#x27;s heirs and the Province of Prince Edward Island) and Sullivan Entertainment (the producers of the well-known films and TV series based on Montgomery&#x27;s novels).

The Anne of Green Gables Licensing Authority controls certain exclusive trademarks relating to &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; commercial merchandise and service related to Montgomery&#x27;s literary works and any copyright in the Montgomery books which have not reverted to the public domain.

Sullivan Entertainment Inc, under agreement with the Anne of Green Gables Licensing Authority, retains all of the dramatic copyright and motion picture copyright in over 125 hours of their original movies, mini-series and television series based on both the Anne and Avonlea series of novels and certain trade-marks relating to Sullivan sourced &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; merchandise and services. Sullivan&#x27;s use of the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; trademarks extends from motion picture products and books, DVDs, CDs etc. to all commercial merchandise related to Sullivan&#x27;s films and television series based on their visual images, costume and production designs, settings, themes and original characters. Sullivan Entertainment also solely controls the commercial trademarks to &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;, &quot;Anne of the Island&quot;, and &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;.

In addition to the GUI, cPanel also has command line and API-based access that allows third-party software vendors, web hosting organizations, and developers to automate standard system administration processes. cPanel &amp; WHM is designed to function either as a dedicated server or virtual private server. The latest cPanel &amp; WHM version supports installation on AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, CloudLinux OS, and Ubuntu.

== History ==

cPanel is currently developed by cPanel, L.L.C., a privately owned company headquartered in Houston, Texas, United States. WebPros is the parent company of cPanel, L.L.C. It was originally designed in 1996 as the control panel for Speed Hosting, a now-defunct web hosting company. The original author of cPanel, J. Nick Koston, had a stake in Speed Hosting. Webking quickly began using cPanel after their merger with Speed Hosting. The new company moved their servers to Virtual Development Inc. (VDI), a now-defunct hosting facility. Following an agreement between Koston and VDI, cPanel was only available to customers hosted directly at VDI. At the time there was little competition in the control panel market, with the main choices being VDI and Alabanza.

Eventually, due to Koston leaving for college, he and William Jensen signed an agreement in which cPanel was split into a separate program called WebPanel; this version was run by VDI. Without the lead programmer, VDI was not able to continue any work on cPanel and eventually stopped supporting it completely. Koston kept working on cPanel while also working at BurstNET. Eventually, he left BurstNET to focus fully on cPanel.

cPanel 3 was released in 1999: main additions over cPanel 2 were an automatic upgrade and the Web Host Manager (WHM). The interface was also improved when Carlos Rego of WizardsHosting made what became the default theme of cPanel.

With the release of cPanel 11, cPanel adopted a four-tier versioning system, &quot;Parent.Major.Minor.Patch&quot; (e.g., 11.32.0.3). As of version 11.52, the &quot;Parent&quot; representation is deprecated, with 11.54 stylized as &quot;Version 54.&quot; cPanel 11.30 is the last major version to support FreeBSD.

On August 20, 2018 cPanel L.L.C. announced that it had signed an agreement to be acquired by a group led by Oakley Capital (who also own Plesk and SolusVM). While Koston sold his interest in cPanel, he will continue to be an owner of the company that owns cPanel.

==Add-ons==
cPanel provides front-ends for a number of common operations, including the management of PGP keys, crontab tasks, mail and FTP accounts, and mailing lists. Several add-ons exist, some for an additional fee, including auto installers such as Installatron, Fantastico, Softaculous, and WHMSonic (SHOUTcast/radio Control Panel Add-on). The add-ons need to be enabled by the server administrator in WHM to be accessible to the cPanel user.

WHM manages some software packages separately from the underlying operating system, applying upgrades to Apache, PHP, MySQL and MariaDB, Exim, FTP, and related software packages automatically. This ensures that these packages are kept up-to-date and compatible with WHM, but makes it more difficult to install newer versions of these packages. It also makes it difficult to verify that the packages have not been tampered with, since the operating system&#x27;s package management verification system cannot be used to do so.

== WHM ==
WHM, short for WebHost Manager, is a web-based tool which is used for server administration. There are at least two tiers of WHM, often referred to as &quot;root WHM&quot;, and non-root WHM (or Reseller WHM). Root WHM is used by server administrators and non-root WHM (with fewer privileges) is used by others, like entity departments, and resellers to manage hosting accounts often referred to as cPanel accounts on a web server. WHM is also used to manage SSL certificates (both server self generated and CA provided SSL certificates), cPanel users, hosting packages, DNS zones, themes, and authentication methods. The default automatic SSL (AutoSSL) provided by cPanel is powered by Let&#x27;s Encrypt. Additionally, WHM can also be used to manage FTP, Mail (POP, IMAP, and SMTP) and SSH services on the server.

As well as being accessible by the root administrator, WHM is also accessible to users with reseller privileges. Reseller users of cPanel have a smaller set of features than the root user, generally limited by the server administrator, to features which they determine will affect their customers&#x27; accounts rather than the server as a whole.
From root WHM, the server administrator can perform maintenance operations such as upgrading and recompiling Apache and PHP, installing Perl modules, and upgrading RPMs installed on the system.

== Enkompass ==
A version of cPanel &amp; WHM for Microsoft Windows, called Enkompass, was declared end-of-life as of February 2014. Version 3 remained available for download, but without further development or support. In the preceding years, Enkompass had been available for free as product development slowed.

== Pricing ==
On June 27, 2019 cPanel announced a new account-based pricing structure. After backlash from their customers, cPanel issued a second announcement but did not change the new structure.

<text>Charles Lynch (August 8, 1783February 9, 1853) was a Democratic and Whig politician who served as Governor of Mississippi and was a former enslaver.

==Early life and career==
Charles Lynch was born in 1783 in either South Carolina or Virginia. He was born into a planter family, and settled as a farmer near Monticello, Mississippi, sometime before 1821, when he was appointed probate judge of Lawrence County, Mississippi. According to the 1820 US Federal Census, Lynch also enslaved seven people.

In 1827, he was elected to the Mississippi State Senate, and returned to the State Senate after the Constitutional Convention of 1832.

== Governorship and Later Life ==
Lynch returned to the Mississippi Senate in 1832. He was elected President of the Senate, and in June 1833, he succeeded Governor Abram L. Scott, who had died in office. He completed Scott&#x27;s term, serving until November 1833, when he was succeeded by Hiram Runnels. In his first six-month tenure as governor, Lynch advocated for a state system of public schools, but his plan was rejected by the State Legislature.

In the 1835 Mississippi gubernatorial election, Lynch, now a Whig, ran successfully for governor, narrowly defeating incumbent Governor Hiram Runnels. He took office in January 1836 and served a two-year term. One of his first acts as governor was approving a law to create 10 new counties from land received after the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek between the Choctaw tribe and the federal government.

As Governor, Lynch advocated for criminal justice reform, changing the state&#x27;s criminal code, which he referred to as the &quot;Bloody Code,&quot; and recommending the construction of a state penitentiary.

Mississippi became involved in central banking by chartering the Union Bank during his tenure. During the Panic of 1837, the state issued 5 million dollars in bonds through the Union Bank, but due to the continued decline of land prices, the Union Bank failed quickly. Lynch did not run for reelection.

After the end of Lynch&#x27;s term, he served as the President of the Alabama and Mississippi Railroad and Banking Company, and served as Commissioner of Public Buildings for Jackson, Mississippi&#x27;s capital, where he would oversee the construction of a new state capitol building, executive mansion, and state penitentiary, a facility known as &quot;The Walls,&quot; located at the site of the current Mississippi State Capitol.

He died on February 9, 1853, and was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

<doc id="1237404" wikidata="Q152017" url="?curid=1237404" title="Paihia">
<text>Paihia is a town in the Bay of Islands in the Northland Region of the North Island of New Zealand. It is 60 kilometres north of Whangārei, located close to the historic towns of Russell and Kerikeri. Missionary Henry Williams named the mission station &quot;Marsden&#x27;s Vale&quot;. Paihia eventually became the accepted name of the settlement.

Nearby to the north is the historic settlement of Waitangi, and the residential and commercial area of Haruru Falls is to the west. The port and township of Opua, and the small settlement of Te Haumi, lie to the south.

== History and culture ==

===Origin of the Name===
The origin of the name &quot;Paihia&quot; is unclear. A popular attribution, most likely apocryphal, is that when Reverend Henry Williams first arrived in the Bay of Islands searching for a location for his mission station, he told his Māori guide, &quot;Pai here,&quot; meaning &quot;Good here,&quot; as his Māori vocabulary was limited.

===European settlement===
Henry Williams and his wife Marianne settled in Paihia in 1823 and built the first church there the same year. William Williams and his wife Jane joined the Paihia mission in 1826. Bishop William Grant Broughton (the first and only Bishop of Australia) visited the Paihia mission in 1838 and performed several firsts in New Zealand including the first Confirmation and Ordination ceremonies.

 was a 55-ton schooner that the missionaries built and launched off the beach at Paihia on 24 January 1826.

In December 1832 the first mention of cricket being played in New Zealand was recorded by Henry Williams. In 1835 a game of cricket was witnessed here by Charles Darwin, in December 1835 while the &quot;Beagle&quot; spent 10 days in the Bay of Islands.

In 1835 William Colenso set up the first printing press in New Zealand at Paihia.

In 1850 the mission closed and Paihia declined to a very small settlement by 1890.

===20th century===
The Williams Memorial Church of St Paul is an Anglican church in Paihia. It was constructed from 1925 to 1926 and was consecrated by Archbishop Alfred Averill in 1926. It was built to commemorate the Anglican missionary Henry Williams who established a mission at Paihia and converted many local Maori. Jones and Palmer designed the bluestone church. The church is the fourth to be built on the site and the oldest grave dates back to 1826.

The triptych stained glass windows above the pulpit were commissioned by the Williams Family Trust in commemoration of Sir Nigel Reed for the 175 year family reunion and installed by the artist in 1998. The windows, titled &quot;Te Ara O Te Manawa&quot; (Pathway of the Heart), are in total size.

In 1925 a road was constructed to Puketona on the main road from Kawakawa to Kerikeri (now State Highway 10) leading to an increase in tourism in the 1930s.

<text>Anne Shirley (born Dawn Evelyn Paris; April 17, 1918 – July 4, 1993) was an American actress.

Beginning her career as a child actress under the stage name Dawn O&#x27;Day, she adopted the stage name of Anne Shirley after playing the titular character in the film adaptation of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; in 1934, after which she achieved a successful career in supporting roles. Among her films is &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; (1937), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Shirley left the acting profession in 1944 at the age of 26 and remained in Los Angeles, where she died at the age of 75.

==Early life==
Born in New York City as Dawn Evelyn Paris, Shirley began modeling as a baby and made her film debut with a featured role in &quot;Moonshine Valley&quot; (1922). She began acting at the age of five as the live-action Alice in Walt Disney&#x27;s silent animated series &quot;Alice in Cartoonland&quot;. Shirley had a highly successful career in pre-Code films such as &quot;Liliom&quot;, &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot;, &quot;So Big&quot;, &quot;Three on a Match&quot; and &quot;Rasputin and the Empress&quot;.

==Career==

In 1934, Shirley starred as the character of Anne Shirley in &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; and took that character&#x27;s name as her legal and stage name.

She starred in &quot;Steamboat Round the Bend&quot;, &quot;Make Way for a Lady&quot; and &quot;Stella Dallas&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her later roles came in films such as &quot;Vigil in the Night&quot;, &quot;Anne of Windy Poplars&quot;, &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; and &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot;, her final film.

Critic Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Shirley&#x27;s performance in &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Children&quot; (1940), writing that she played her role &quot;with heroic integrity and strength of character.&quot;

==Personal life==
Shirley married actor John Payne on August 22, 1937, in Montecito, California. They had a daughter, former actress Julie Payne, and divorced in 1943.

Her second husband was film producer and screenwriter Adrian Scott. When he was blacklisted and wanted to move the family to Europe, Shirley opted to remain in the U.S. The couple divorced in 1949.

Her third husband was Charles Lederer, nephew of Marion Davies. They had one son, Daniel Lederer.

Shirley had brief relationships with younger Western star Rory Calhoun and with French film star Jean-Pierre Aumont.

Shirley died from lung cancer in Los Angeles at the age of 75 on July 4, 1993, and was cremated. For her contributions to the motion-picture industry, she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7020 Hollywood Blvd.

<text>Guy Mairesse (10 August 1910 – 24 April 1954) was a French racing driver. He participated in three Formula One World Championship &quot;Grands Prix&quot;, debuting on 3 September 1950. He scored no championship points.

Mairesse built a haulage business during the interwar period, and became interested in motor sport in 1946 through his friendship with Le Mans driver, Paul Vallée. He won the Lyon-Charbonnières Rally in 1947 and then purchased a Delahaye from Vallée for 1948, with which he was victorious at Chimay.

In 1949 Mairesse joined Vallée&#x27;s team, Ecurie France, to race the Talbot-Lago and took fourth place at Pau and fifth at Albi. In 1950 he finished second at Le Mans with Pierre Meyrat using a single seat Talbot. Towards the end of that season the Vallée team closed and Mairesse purchased the Le Mans car and a Talbot-Lago T26C, which he used to enter the 1950 Italian Grand Prix, from which he retired, and the Swiss and French Grands Prix in 1951, finishing 11 laps down and &quot;not classified&quot; on both occasions. Thereafter his business commitments curtailed his involvement in racing and he sold his cars in 1952 appearing infrequently in other owners&#x27; machinery.

Mairesse was killed in practice for the Coupe de Paris at Montlhéry in 1954, when he swerved to avoid another car and crashed into a concrete wall.

<doc id="1237418" wikidata="Q964593" url="?curid=1237418" title="Maurice Cheeks">
<text>Maurice Edward Cheeks (born September 8, 1956) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who serves as assistant coach for the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has also served as head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, Philadelphia 76ers, and Detroit Pistons. Cheeks was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a player in 2018. He was the first player with 2,000 steals solely in the NBA.

==Early life==
Cheeks was born in Chicago on September 8, 1956, and grew up in the Robert Taylor Homes. He attended DuSable High School. He only had significant playing time on the basketball team in his senior year. His high school teammate William Dise was heavily recruited by college basketball programs, and Dise told the schools that if they wanted him, they also had to offer Cheeks a scholarship to join him. Ron Ekker, head coach at West Texas State University (now West Texas A&amp;M) only agreed to accept both Dise and Cheeks after their high school coach, Bob Bonner, said Cheeks would eventually be the better player; and then watching Cheeks play in a local gym pickup game.

Cheeks attended West Texas from 1974 to 1978, and was a four-year starter under Ekker. He wanted to leave after his first year, but his mother convinced Cheeks to stay. He was an all-Missouri Valley Conference player for three straight seasons (first team in 1975-1976 and 1977-1978, and second team in 1976-1977). He was selected team MVP three times. As a senior, he averaged 16.8 points per game, and shot nearly 57% for his collegiate career. He is the third leading scorer in WTSU/WTAM history.

Cheeks was inducted into the West Texas A &amp; M Hall of Champions in 1988. He was inducted into the Missouri Valley Conference Hall of Fame in 2021. 

==Playing career==
After college, Cheeks was selected as the 36th pick in the second round of the 1978 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. He played 15 years as a point guard in the NBA, including 11 with the Philadelphia 76ers. As a 76er, he earned four trips to the NBA All-Star Game, and he helped the 76ers to three trips to the NBA Finals in a four-year span in the early 1980s (1980, 1982, and 1983), including an NBA championship in 1983. While starting at point guard for a Sixers team that at times included stars Julius Erving, Moses Malone, Andrew Toney, and Charles Barkley, Cheeks was well regarded for his team play and defensive skills. He was named to four straight NBA All-Defensive squads from 1983 to 1986, and earned a spot on the second team in 1987. When he retired in 1993, he was fifth in NBA history in total assists, and as of 2024, he is sixteenth on the combined ABA/NBA assist list.

===Philadelphia 76ers (1978–1989)===
He had his best seasons with the 76ers. At the young age of 22 he gained a notable role on the 76ers, solidifying himself as the starting point guard and earning himself valuable minutes, starting all 82 games and playing nearly 30 minutes per game. The 76ers were also in playoff contention for every year that he was on the team except for the 1987–88 season. 

By his fifth year in the league, he was selected to his first All-Star appearance, starting the game, and had averaged 12.5 points, 6.9 assists, and 2.3 steals for the 1982–83 season. The 76ers also had the best season in this 76ers era, having a 65–17 record. This is the second-best season record in the 76ers franchise history, the 1966-1967 team being 68-13; and the second-best record league-wide in the 1980s behind only the 1986 Boston Celtics. 

They would go on to win the NBA championship that year, which was Cheeks&#x27; first and only championship. He would be an integral part of the 76ers for the rest of his time in Philadelphia, however the 76ers failed to repeat the level of success that they reached in the 1982–83 season. He would be selected to three more All-Star appearances from 1986 to 1988. In the 1986 playoffs he averaged a playoff career high 20.8 points throughout the whole postseason. In the 1986–87 season he would average a career high 15.6 points. However the 76ers were no longer elite title contenders and lost in the first round in the 1987 playoffs. The following year they missed the playoffs in what was Cheeks&#x27; last all-star appearance. Cheeks played one more season for the 76ers; they were back in the playoffs but got swept in the first round by the New York Knicks.

===San Antonio Spurs (1989–1990)===
In the 1989 off-season the Philadelphia 76ers traded Maurice Cheeks, Chris Welp, and David Wingate to the San Antonio Spurs for Johnny Dawkins and Jay Vincent. At 33 years old, Cheeks was aging and in the twilight of his career but he still played well for the Spurs and averaged 10.9 points for his time in San Antonio. He played 50 games for the club and was the starting point guard. However he was not able to finish the 1989–90 season for the Spurs as he was traded to the Knicks before the season ended.

===New York Knicks (1990–1991)===
On February 21, 1990, Cheeks was traded to the New York Knicks for Rod Strickland. Cheeks played the remainder of the season in New York, averaging 7.9 points in 31 games for the franchise. The Knicks went 45–37 that year and made the 1990 playoffs, however they lost in the second round 1–4 to the Detroit Pistons. The following season, Cheeks played in 76 games, averaging 7.8 points per game and 5.7 assists per game, and the Knicks made the playoffs, but were swept by the Bulls in the first round.

===Atlanta Hawks (1991–1992)===
In the 1991 off-season the New York Knicks traded Cheeks to the Atlanta Hawks for Tim McCormick and a 1994 first round draft pick (which later became Charlie Ward). Cheeks&#x27; points average dropped drastically to 4.6 and he was no longer a starting calibre player. He became an unrestricted free agent in the 1992 off-season and did not re-sign with the Hawks.

In the second-to-last game of the 1991–92 season (April 15, 1992), while playing for the Hawks against the Knicks, Cheeks picked off four steals to surpass longtime Philadelphia teammate Julius Erving&#x27;s steals record of 2,272 for combined ABA and NBA steals. 

===New Jersey Nets (1992–1993)===
On January 7, 1993, the New Jersey Nets signed Cheeks as a free agent. He averaged a career-low 3.6 points for the season and he only played 35 games for the franchise. The Nets reached the playoffs but lost in the first round 2–3 to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

===Retirement===
After the season ended Cheeks became a free agent but never played in the NBA again. At 36 years old he retired from the NBA.

In NBA history, as of 2024, Cheeks ranks sixth in steals and sixteenth in assists among ABA/NBA combined rankings. Upon his retirement from the NBA in 1993, he was the NBA all-time leader in steals, third all-time in playoff steals, and fifth in assists. He averaged 11.7 points and over 2 steals per game for his career. In his rookie year, Cheeks averaged 4.1 steals per game in the 1979 NBA Playoffs (37 steals in nine games), an NBA record for one playoff run (as of 2024). As of 2024, he is second all-time in playoff steals per game average, behind only Baron Davis.

==Coaching career==
After retirement, Cheeks spent one year coaching for the Continental Basketball Association’s Quad City Thunder, before becoming the 76ers assistant coach in 1994 through 2001. He coached under head coaches John Lucas (1994–96), Johnny Davis (1996–97), and Larry Brown, and he was an instrumental part of the Philadelphia team that reached the 2001 NBA Finals. In 2001, he was hired as Portland Trail Blazers head coach. He led the team to two playoff berths in four years as coach, but could not get past the first round. He was fired after a poor start to the 2004–05 campaign.

On April 25, 2003, during a game between the Trail Blazers and the Dallas Mavericks, Cheeks famously aided 13-year-old Natalie Gilbert in singing the American national anthem. After Gilbert forgot the words at &quot;At the twilight&#x27;s last gleaming&quot;, Cheeks rushed over to help her, and they finished it together as the entire Rose Garden Arena crowd sang with them. Cheeks and Gilbert received a standing ovation after the song was over. Cheeks actions were used by Harvard Business School Professor Thomas J. DeLong as an example of true leadership in times of crisis. Former 76ers general manager Pat Williams called it &quot;&#x27;just a beautiful moment of ... humanity.&#x27;&quot;

In 2005, Cheeks was named as head coach of the 76ers. Cheeks was popular among 76ers fans because of his eleven-year tenure with the 76ers, during which he helped guide the 76ers to the 1983 NBA championship. The move was also praised by 76ers star Allen Iverson, who worked with Cheeks during his run as 76ers&#x27; Assistant Head Coach.

However, he missed the playoffs in each of his first two seasons. Frustrations began to grow with 76ers veterans Allen Iverson and Chris Webber, who were not happy with the team&#x27;s direction. Toward the end of the 2006 season, the two were fined for tardiness coming to a game, but soon apologized profusely to Cheeks. During the 2006–07 season, Iverson would be traded to the Nuggets and Webber would be released, leaving Cheeks with one of the youngest teams in the NBA. On February 20, 2007, the 76ers extended Cheeks&#x27; contract one year despite his losing record as coach.

At the beginning of the 2007–08 season, expectations were low and the 76ers were picked to finish last in the Conference by many prognosticators. However, the Sixers clinched a playoff berth with a win over the Atlanta Hawks on April 4, 2008. It was their first postseason appearance since 2005, as well as the first in the post-Iverson era. However, they were eliminated by the Detroit Pistons, 4–2. Even with this elimination, many fans considered this to be a successful season, considering that the 76ers were 12 games under .500 in early February and went on to have a 21–7 run that led them to the playoffs.

The 76ers extended Cheeks&#x27; contract before the 2008-2009 season to 2010. They started out the 2008–09 NBA season 9–14 despite their signing of Elton Brand and re-signing of Andre Iguodala during the off-season. Due to their slow start, the 76ers fired Cheeks on December 13, 2008.

On August 14, 2009, he was hired as an assistant coach for the Oklahoma City Thunder.

On June 10, 2013, Cheeks agreed to become the head coach of the Detroit Pistons. On February 9, 2014, the Detroit Pistons relieved him of his head coaching duties and replaced him with John Loyer on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. The move came after owner Tom Gores suggested that the Pistons were &quot;better than our record&quot; and weren&#x27;t playing &quot;at their maximum&quot;—a veiled criticism of Cheeks.

On June 29, 2015, Cheeks returned to the Thunder as an assistant coach.

On November 14, 2020, Cheeks was hired by the Chicago Bulls as an assistant coach following the team&#x27;s hiring of Billy Donovan.

On June 13, 2024, it was reported that Tom Thibodeau was hiring Cheeks to be an assistant coach for the New York Knicks, and Cheeks joined the Knicks coaching staff for the 2024-2025 season.

==Honors and awards==
On September 7, 2018, Cheeks was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a player. In 2008, he was inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame. In 1995, the 76ers retired Cheeks No. 10 jersey. He was inducted into the West Texas A &amp; M Hall of Champions (1988), and the Missouri Valley Conference Hall of Fame (2021).

In 2022, a group of present and former Philadelphia Inquirer sports writers ranked Cheeks as the seventh greatest Sixer of all-time, only behind fellow hall of fame players Wilt Chamberlain, Julius Erving, Moses Malone, Allen Iverson, Charles Barkley and Hal Greer. In one NBA ranking of the greatest backcourt duos in league history, Cheeks and Andrew Toney were ranked eleventh out of seventy pairs. In 2017, the 76ers unveiled a statue of Cheeks outside their training facility in Camden, New Jersey, joining the statues of Hal Greer, Billy Cunningham (Cheeks&#x27; former coach) and Wilt Chamberlain. On the same day, Cheeks, then an assistant coach with the Thunder, was in Philadelphia for the Thunder-Sixers game and was honored with a video montage during the game. He received a standing ovation from the Philadelphia fans, while his team stood and cheered along.

<text>Taipa-Mangonui or Taipa Bay-Mangonui is a string of small resort settlements – Taipa, Cable Bay, Coopers Beach, and Mangōnui – that lie along the coast of Doubtless Bay in the Far North District of New Zealand. They are so close together that they have run together to form one larger settlement.

The miniature conurbation lies 150 kilometres by road northwest of Whangārei (and 100 kilometres as the crow flies), 20 kilometres northeast of Kaitaia, and nearly 100 kilometres southeast of the northernmost tip of the North Island.

==History==
===Before European arrival===
According to some Māori legends, the great Polynesian explorer and navigator Kupe sailed from Hawaiki in his canoe named Matahourua and landed at Taipa Bay. Others believe that he landed in the Hokianga Harbour around AD 900.

Centuries after Kupe&#x27;s landing, the chiefs Te Parata and Tu moana, descendants of Kupe, were said to have brought the ancestors of the Ngāti Kahu tribe to the Mangonui area around AD 1350, returning on the same canoe. Legend has it that they found insufficient fresh water at Otengi Bay and travelled up to the mouth of the Taipa River to land. There they settled and married into the local tribes.

Another canoe led by Moehuri is said to have been guided by a large shark into the Mangonui Harbour to a landing spot opposite the old post office. He made the shark tapu and called the harbour &quot;Mangonui&quot;, meaning &#x27;big shark&#x27; in the Māori language. In the 19th century, the spelling &quot;Mongonui&quot; was more common, and the Mongonui electorate filled one seat in Parliament between 1861 and 1881. Moehuri settled in Mangonui and married into the local people – remnants of the Ngāti Awa and branch tribes of the Ngāti Whātua. Pā were located all around the area, including one at Mill Bay, called Rangikapiti by Moehuri.

Taumarumaru pā was located on the headland between Mangonui and Coopers Beach while at the western end of Coopers Beach was Ohumuhumu pā, surrounded at one time by a large village.

===Since European arrival===
In 1769 James Cook sailed past and noted that it was &quot;doubtless a bay ...&quot;, hence the modern name of Doubtless Bay. Eight days later the first Europeans to land were Jean-François de Surville and his crew aboard &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot;. They landed at what he named Lauriston Bay to get fresh vegetables to combat scurvy. Around twenty years later, whalers and sealers from all over the western world arrived, and called the area Coopers Beach – thought to have come from the coopers on the whaleships.

The first European settler is considered to be James David Berghan from Ireland, who arrived in Mangonui in 1831. By the later half of the 19th century, flax and timber industries were flourishing in the area. Other settlers developed farms and businesses in the area while some married into the native population. The dynamic mix of settlers coming from various parts of Europe and the Maori population provided Mangonui with a rich heritage.

When Hōne Heke destroyed Kororareka (Russell), the evacuation saw 40 to 50 ships in the Mangonui Harbour. The town assumed new importance and was considered the country&#x27;s second capital. The last whaling ship visited Mangonui in 1885.

==Education==
There are two schools in the area, both coeducational. Taipa Area School is a composite (years 1–15) school. Mangonui School is a contributing primary (years 1–6) school that opened in 1858.

<text>Israil Bercovici (, ; 1921–1988) was a Jewish Romanian dramaturg, playwright, director, biographer, and memoirist, who served the State Jewish Theater of Romania between 1955 and 1982; he also wrote Yiddish-language poetry.

==Biography==
Bercovici was born into a poor working-class family in Botoşani, Romania, and received a traditional Jewish education. During World War II he served time at hard labor until the arrival of the Soviet Army in Romania.

After the war, he began his career in Yiddish-language newspapers and radio, notably the weekly &quot;IKUF-Bleter&quot; (1946–1953), and the &quot;Revista Cultului Mozaic din R.P.R.&quot; (&quot;Journal of the Jewish Communities in the People&#x27;s Republic of Romania&quot;, also known as &quot;Tsaytshrift&quot;). The &quot;Journal&quot; was launched in 1956 and had sections in Romanian, Yiddish and Hebrew. Bercovici edited the Yiddish section from 1970 to 1972.

As a literature student after the war at a secular secondary school in Bucharest, Bercovici published his first Yiddish-language poetry in &quot;IKUF-Bleter&quot;. Judging by theater reviews he wrote in the early 1950s, he appears to have been an ardent Communist, grateful for his liberation from the labor camp and for the opportunity to receive a secular education, advocating a socialist realist aesthetic for Yiddish-language theater.

His affiliation with the State Jewish Theater began in 1955, initially as &quot;literarischer Sekretär&quot;. He continued to be very aware of developments in theater beyond the Yiddish language: he drove the theater toward being a contemporary theater, rather than a mere museum of inherited plays. Elvira Groezinger compares his goals to those of New York City&#x27;s Arbeter Teater Farband (ARTEF, &quot;Workers&#x27; Theatre Society&quot;), goals well-aligned with those of the Communist regime.

Bercovici translated works from world literature: Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s &quot;Frank V&quot; (1964), Karl Gutzkow&#x27;s &quot;Uriel Acosta&quot; (1968), and Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Master Builder&quot; (1972), and wrote his own Yiddish-language plays, including &quot;Der goldener fodem&quot; (&quot;The Golden Thread&quot;, 1963), about Abraham Goldfaden (who in 1876 founded the world&#x27;s first Yiddish-language theater, in Iaşi, Romania), and the musical revue &quot;A shnirl perl&quot; (&quot;A Pearl Necklace&quot;, 1967). He also wrote books about Yiddish theater history.

In 1976 he directed a celebration of 100 years of Yiddish theatre in Romania, which included not only performances of his own work but also those of Goldfaden and Sholem Aleichem.

Toward the end of Bercovici&#x27;s career, in Romania, as elsewhere in Europe, Yiddish was a language in decline. The State Jewish Theater coped, in part, by installing headphones throughout the theater to allow simultaneous translation of the plays into Romanian; the system is still in use when the theater performs Yiddish-language plays today.

Bercovici&#x27;s 3000-volume Yiddish-language library is now part of the University Library in Potsdam.

==Works for theater==
The following list is drawn from Bercovici&#x27;s own history of Yiddish theater in Romania ([Bercovici 1998]). The list may be incomplete; many of Bercovici&#x27;s works were musical and folkloric revues and some were reworkings of Purim plays. The music for most of Bercovici&#x27;s plays was composed by Haim Schwartzmann; &quot;The Golden Thread&quot; also uses music by Avram Goldfaden, whom the play is about. Schwartzmann and Eugen Koffler contributed music for &quot;A Pearl Necklace&quot; and &quot;Baraşeum &#x27;72&quot;; &quot;Mangheriada&quot; used music by Schwartzmann, Koffler, Dubi Seltzer, Henech Kon, and Simha Schwartz; a 1976 production of &quot;The Golden Thread&quot; credits additional music by Adalbert Winkler.

The list contains Romanian-language titles and Yiddish-language titles with Romanian phonetic transcription. Some works had only a Romanian language title; when titles in both languages are given by Bercovici, the Romanian title precedes the Yiddish. Unless otherwise noted, the date given is that of first performance by the State Jewish Theater.

<doc id="1237431" wikidata="Q6799976" url="?curid=1237431" title="McArthur Court">
<text>McArthur Court is a basketball arena located on the campus of the University of Oregon in Eugene and the former home of the Oregon Ducks men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, replaced in 2011 by Matthew Knight Arena.

Also known as &quot;The Pit&quot; or &quot;Mac Court,&quot; it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation. The arena is named for Clifton N. (Pat) McArthur, U. S. Congressman and Oregon student-athlete and the school&#x27;s first student body president.

Its unique and antiquated structure has the fans on top of the court. The maple floor bounces under the weight of the student section that surrounds the court. In 2001 Sporting News named it &quot;best gym in America&quot;. For its history, character, and atmosphere, sports writer and arena researcher Bill Kintner named McArthur Court in his top five of college basketball arenas in America. He notes that McArthur Court &quot;is a building that will give you chills even if there is no game being played.&quot;

The arena was funded by a $15 fee imposed by the Associated Students of the University of Oregon and the mortgage papers were burned as part of a public ceremony after the building was completely paid for.

Until it was replaced in 2011, it was the second-oldest on-campus arena still in use, after Fordham University&#x27;s Rose Hill Gym. McArthur Court saw its first game on January 14, 1927, a 38–10 Oregon victory over Willamette University. Among its finest moments are two upsets over #1 UCLA in the mid-1970s and another upset of the top-ranked Bruins on January 6, 2007. An undefeated home season in 2001–02 propelled the Ducks to the &quot;Elite Eight&quot; in the NCAA Tournament. Players to call the court home over the years include Ron Lee, Greg Ballard, Blair Rasmussen, Terrell Brandon, Fred Jones, Luke Ridnour, Luke Jackson, Malik Hairston, and Aaron Brooks.

Women began playing in 1974 and played their first game at McArthur Court on January 23, 1974 against Southern Oregon University. Mac Court was also home to the OSAA high school Class A-1 state basketball tournament from 1947 to 1965, and the AA, 5A and 6A boys&#x27; basketball championships from 1971 to 1996 and 2004 to 2009.

Elvis Presley performed on 11-25-1976 and 11-27-1976. The Grateful Dead played on 01-22-1978 officially released as Dave&#x27;s Picks Volume 23. The Clash performed on 05-29-1984.

<text>Turramurra railway station is a suburban railway station located on the North Shore line, serving the Sydney suburb of Turramurra. It is served by Sydney Trains T1 North Shore line services.

== History ==
Turramurra station opened on 1 January 1890 as Eastern Road when the North Shore line opened from Hornsby to St Leonards. It was renamed Turramurra on 30 August 1890. The present island platform and station building were completed in 1900.

The district was originally known as Big Island, Vanceville and Claraville (after names of estates or grants), and further north as Tulip Scrub from the large number of tulips or waratahs there. Turramurra means &quot;high hill&quot; or &quot;big hill.&quot; More than 100 years ago remnants of a tribe of aboriginal people periodically travelled from the Lane Cove River to Cowan Creek and always broke their journey at what came to be called Wright&#x27;s Hill, near Pymble Reservoir, or just north of it.

The traditional owners called this place Turramurra or Turraburra (not to be confused with Turramburra, the native name for the Lane Cove River). As no railway station was made there, it was applied to the station in the vicinity.

In 1977, a precast concrete footbridge was installed. This was replaced in 2008 by a new footbridge and lift.

<text>&quot;Blazhen Muzh&quot; (Church Slavonic: Блажен муж, &quot;Blessed is the Man&quot;) is a setting of verses from Psalms 1, 2, and 3 taken from the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition of Vespers. 

As with many of the Psalms and hymns, &quot;Blazhen Muzh&quot; attracted the attention of composers. Alexander Kastalsky produced a musical setting of it to be performed at the Dormition Cathedral.

==Text of the hymn==

The version below is the one set by Sergei Rachmaninoff in his All-Night Vigil.
