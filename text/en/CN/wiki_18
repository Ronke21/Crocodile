<text>The modern Japanese writing system uses a combination of logographic kanji, which are adopted Chinese characters, and syllabic kana. Kana itself consists of a pair of syllabaries: hiragana, used primarily for native or naturalized Japanese words and grammatical elements; and katakana, used primarily for foreign words and names, loanwords, onomatopoeia, scientific names, and sometimes for emphasis. Almost all written Japanese sentences contain a mixture of kanji and kana. Because of this mixture of scripts, in addition to a large inventory of kanji characters, the Japanese writing system is considered to be one of the most complicated currently in use.

Several thousand kanji characters are in regular use, which mostly originate from traditional Chinese characters. Others made in Japan are referred to as &quot;Japanese kanji&quot; (), also known as &quot;[our] country&#x27;s kanji&quot; (). Each character has an intrinsic meaning (or range of meanings), and most have more than one pronunciation, the choice of which depends on context. Japanese primary and secondary school students are required to learn 2,136 jōyō kanji as of 2010. The total number of kanji is well over 50,000, though this includes tens of thousands of characters only present in historical writings and never used in modern Japanese.

In modern Japanese, the hiragana and katakana syllabaries each contain 46 basic characters, or 71 including diacritics. With one or two minor exceptions, each different sound in the Japanese language (that is, each different syllable, strictly each mora) corresponds to one character in each syllabary. Unlike kanji, these characters intrinsically represent sounds only; they convey meaning only as part of words. Hiragana and katakana characters also originally derive from Chinese characters, but they have been simplified and modified to such an extent that their origins are no longer visually obvious.

Texts without kanji are rare; most are either children&#x27;s books—since children tend to know few kanji at an early age—or early electronics such as computers, phones, and video games, which could not display complex graphemes like kanji due to both graphical and computational limitations.

To a lesser extent, modern written Japanese also uses initialisms from the Latin alphabet, for example in terms such as &quot;BC/AD&quot;, &quot;a.m./p.m.&quot;, &quot;FBI&quot;, and &quot;CD&quot;. Romanized Japanese is most frequently used by foreign students of Japanese who have not yet mastered kana, and by native speakers for computer input.

==Use of scripts==

===Kanji===
 are logographic characters (Japanese-simplified since 1946) taken from Chinese script and used in the writing of Japanese. 

It is known from archaeological evidence that the first contacts that the Japanese had with Chinese writing took place in the 1st century AD, during the late Yayoi period. However, the Japanese people of that era probably had little to no comprehension of the script, and they would remain relatively illiterate until the 5th century AD in the Kofun period, when writing in Japan became more widespread.

Kanji characters are used to write most content words of native Japanese or (historically) Chinese origin, which include the following:

*many nouns, such as (&quot;kawa&quot;, &quot;river&quot;) and (&quot;gakkō&quot;, &quot;school&quot;)
*the stems of most verbs and adjectives, such as in (&quot;miru&quot;, &quot;see&quot;) and in (&quot;shiroi&quot;, &quot;white&quot;)
*the stems of many adverbs, such as in (&quot;hayaku&quot;, &quot;quickly&quot;) and as in (&quot;jōzu ni&quot;, &quot;masterfully&quot;)
*most Japanese personal names and place names, such as (&quot;Tanaka&quot;) and (&quot;Tōkyō&quot;). (Certain names may be written in hiragana or katakana, or some combination of these, plus kanji.)

Some Japanese words are written with different kanji depending on the specific usage of the word—for instance, the word &quot;naosu&quot; (to fix, or to cure) is written when it refers to curing a person, and when it refers to fixing an object.

Most kanji have more than one possible pronunciation (or &quot;reading&quot;), and some common kanji have many. These are broadly divided into &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;, which are readings that approximate to a Chinese pronunciation of the character at the time it was adopted into Japanese, and &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;, which are pronunciations of native Japanese words that correspond to the meaning of the kanji character. However, some kanji terms have pronunciations that correspond to neither the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; nor the &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; readings of the individual kanji within the term, such as (&quot;ashita&quot;, &quot;tomorrow&quot;) and (&quot;otona&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;).

Unusual or nonstandard kanji readings may be glossed using furigana. Kanji compounds are sometimes given arbitrary readings for stylistic purposes. For example, in Natsume Sōseki&#x27;s short story &quot;The Fifth Night&quot;, the author uses for &quot;tsunagatte&quot;, the gerundive &quot;-te&quot; form of the verb &quot;tsunagaru&quot; (&quot;to connect&quot;), which would usually be written as or . The word , meaning &quot;connection&quot;, is normally pronounced &quot;setsuzoku&quot;.

===Kana===

==== Hiragana ====
 emerged as a manual simplification via cursive script of the most phonetically widespread kanji among those who could read and write during the Heian period (794–1185). The main creators of the current hiragana were ladies of the Japanese imperial court, who used the script in the writing of personal communications and literature. 

Hiragana is used to write the following:

*—inflectional endings for adjectives and verbs—such as in (&quot;miru&quot;, &quot;see&quot;) and in (&quot;shiroi&quot;, &quot;white&quot;), and respectively and in their past tense inflections (&quot;mita&quot;, &quot;saw&quot;) and (&quot;shirokatta&quot;, &quot;was white&quot;).
)—small, usually common words that, for example, mark sentence topics, subjects and objects or have a purpose similar to English prepositions such as &quot;in&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;from&quot;, &quot;by&quot; and &quot;for&quot;.
*miscellaneous other words of various grammatical types that lack a kanji rendition, or whose kanji is obscure, difficult to typeset, or considered too difficult to understand for the context (such as in children&#x27;s books).
*—phonetic renderings of hiragana placed above or beside the kanji character. Furigana may aid children or non-native speakers or clarify nonstandard, rare, or ambiguous readings, especially for words that use kanji not part of the jōyō kanji list.

There is also some flexibility for words with common kanji renditions to be instead written in hiragana, depending on the individual author&#x27;s preference (all Japanese words &quot;can&quot; be spelled out entirely in hiragana or katakana, even when they are normally written using kanji). Some words are colloquially written in hiragana and writing them in kanji might give them a more formal tone, while hiragana may impart a softer or more emotional feeling. For example, the Japanese word &quot;kawaii&quot;, the Japanese equivalent of &quot;cute&quot;, can be written entirely in hiragana as in , or with kanji as .

Some lexical items that are normally written using kanji have become grammaticalized in certain contexts, where they are instead written in hiragana. For example, the root of the verb (&quot;miru&quot;, &quot;see&quot;) is normally written with the kanji for the &quot;mi&quot; portion. However, when used as a supplementary verb as in 試してみる (&quot;tameshite miru&quot;) meaning &quot;to try out&quot;, the whole verb is typically written in hiragana as , as we see also in (&quot;tabete miru&quot;, &quot;try to eat [it] and see&quot;).

==== Katakana ====
 emerged around the 9th century, in the Heian period, when Buddhist monks created a syllabary derived from Chinese characters to simplify their reading, using portions of the characters as a kind of shorthand. The origin of the alphabet is attributed to the monk Kūkai.

Katakana is used to write the following:

*transliteration of foreign words and names, such as (&quot;konpyūta&quot;, &quot;computer&quot;) and (&quot;Rondon&quot;, &quot;London&quot;). However, some foreign borrowings that were naturalized may be rendered in hiragana, such as たばこ (&quot;tabako&quot;, &quot;tobacco&quot;), which comes from Portuguese. See also Transcription into Japanese.
*commonly used names of animals and plants, such as (&quot;tokage&quot;, &quot;lizard&quot;), (&quot;neko&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;) and (&quot;bara&quot;, &quot;rose&quot;), and certain other technical and scientific terms, including chemical and mineral names such as (&quot;kariumu&quot;, &quot;potassium&quot;), (&quot;porimā&quot;, &quot;polymer&quot;) and (&quot;beriru&quot;, &quot;beryl&quot;).
*occasionally, the names of miscellaneous other objects whose kanji are rare, such as (&quot;rōsoku&quot;, &quot;candle&quot;); the kanji form, , contains the hyōgaiji .
*onomatopoeia, such as (&quot;wan-wan&quot;, &quot;woof-woof&quot;), and other sound symbolism
*emphasis, much like italicisation in European languages.

Katakana can also be used to impart the idea that words are spoken in a foreign or otherwise unusual accent; for example, the speech of a robot.

===Rōmaji===
The first contact of the Japanese with the Latin alphabet occurred in the 16th century, during the Muromachi period, when they had contact with Portuguese navigators, the first European people to visit the Japanese islands. The earliest Japanese romanization system was based on Portuguese orthography. It was developed around 1548 by a Japanese Catholic named Anjirō.

The Latin alphabet is used to write the following:

*Latin-alphabet acronyms and initialisms, such as NATO or UFO
*Japanese personal names, corporate brands, and other words intended for international use (for example, on business cards, in passports, etc.)
*foreign names, words, and phrases, often in scholarly contexts
*foreign words deliberately rendered to impart a foreign flavour, for instance, in commercial contexts
*other Japanized words derived or originated from foreign languages, such as (&quot;jei rīgu&quot;, &quot;J. League&quot;), (&quot;tī shatsu&quot;, &quot;T-shirt&quot;) or (&quot;bī-kyū gurume&quot;, &quot;B-rank gourmet [cheap and local cuisines]&quot;)

===Arabic numerals===

Arabic numerals (as opposed to traditional kanji numerals) are often used to write numbers in horizontal text, especially when numbering things rather than indicating a quantity, such as telephone numbers, serial numbers and addresses. Arabic numerals were introduced in Japan probably at the same time as the Latin alphabet, in the 16th century during the Muromachi period, the first contact being via Portuguese navigators. These numerals did not originate in Europe, as the Portuguese inherited them during the Arab occupation of the Iberian peninsula.

In the modern period, Japanese keyboards, such as the IME (Input Method Editor), primarily default their usage to the fullwidth Unicode Arabic numerals &quot;１&quot; as opposed to &quot;1&quot;, though most actual usage uses the common halfwidth one &quot;1&quot;, especially when used to represent a quantity. The fullwidth character may be used for spacing purposes aesthetically.

===Hentaigana===
, a set of archaic kana made obsolete by the Meiji reformation, are sometimes used to impart an archaic flavor, like in items of food (esp. soba).

===Additional mechanisms===
&quot;Jukujikun&quot; refers to instances in which words are written using &quot;kanji&quot; that reflect the meaning of the word though the pronunciation of the word is entirely unrelated to the usual pronunciations of the constituent &quot;kanji&quot;. Conversely, &quot;ateji&quot; refers to the employment of &quot;kanji&quot; that appear solely to represent the sound of the compound word but are, conceptually, utterly unrelated to the signification of the word.

===Examples===
Sentences are commonly written using a combination of all three Japanese scripts: kanji (in red), hiragana (in purple), and katakana (in orange), and in limited instances also include Latin alphabet characters (in green) and Arabic numerals (in black):

The same text can be transliterated to the Latin alphabet (&quot;rōmaji&quot;), although this will generally only be done for the convenience of foreign language speakers:

Translated into English, this reads:

All words in modern Japanese can be written using hiragana, katakana, and rōmaji, while only some have kanji. Words that have no dedicated kanji may still be written with kanji by employing either ateji (as in man&#x27;yogana, から = 可良) or jukujikun, as in the title of とある科学の超電磁砲 (超電磁砲 being used to represent レールガン).

Although rare, there are some words that use all three scripts in the same word. An example of this is the term くノ一 (&quot;rōmaji&quot;: &quot;kunoichi&quot;), which uses a hiragana, a katakana, and a kanji character, in that order. It is said that if all three characters are put in the same kanji &quot;square&quot;, they all combine to create the kanji (woman/female). Another example is (rōmaji: &quot;keshigomu&quot;) which means &quot;eraser&quot;, and uses a kanji, a hiragana, and two katakana characters, in that order.

===Statistics===
A statistical analysis of a corpus of the Japanese newspaper &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; from the year 1993 (around 56.6 million tokens) revealed:
== Collation ==
Collation (word ordering) in Japanese is based on the kana, which express the pronunciation of the words, rather than the kanji. The kana may be ordered using two common orderings, the prevalent &quot;gojūon&quot; (fifty-sound) ordering, or the old-fashioned &quot;iroha&quot; ordering. Kanji dictionaries are usually collated using the radical system, though other systems, such as SKIP, also exist.

== Direction of writing ==

Traditionally, Japanese is written in a format called , which was inherited from traditional Chinese practice. In this format, the characters are written in columns going from top to bottom, with columns ordered from right to left. After reaching the bottom of each column, the reader continues at the top of the column to the left of the current one.

Modern Japanese also uses another writing format, called . This writing format is horizontal and reads from left to right, as in English.

A book printed in tategaki opens with the spine of the book to the right, while a book printed in yokogaki opens with the spine to the left.

== Spacing and punctuation ==

Japanese is normally written without spaces between words, and text is allowed to wrap from one line to the next without regard for word boundaries. This convention was originally modelled on Chinese writing, where spacing is superfluous because each character is essentially a word in itself (albeit compounds are common). However, in kana and mixed kana/kanji text, readers of Japanese must work out where word divisions lie based on an understanding of what makes sense. For example, must be mentally divided as . In rōmaji, it may sometimes be ambiguous whether an item should be transliterated as two words or one. For example, , composed of and , is variously transliterated as or . Particles, like the possessive particle の in (&quot;your dog&quot;), are sometimes joined with the preceding term (&quot;kimino inu&quot;), or written as separate words (&quot;kimi no inu&quot;).

Words in potentially unfamiliar foreign compounds, normally transliterated in katakana, may be separated by a punctuation mark called a to aid Japanese readers. For example, . This punctuation is also occasionally used to separate native Japanese words, especially in concatenations of kanji characters where there might otherwise be confusion or ambiguity about interpretation, and especially for the full names of people.

The Japanese full stop () and comma () are used for similar purposes to their English equivalents, though comma usage can be more fluid than is the case in English. There is no clear standard of where the positions of commas should be inserted in a Japanese sentence. The question mark () is not used in traditional or formal Japanese, but it may be used in informal writing, or in transcriptions of dialogue where it might not otherwise be clear that a statement was intoned as a question. The exclamation mark () is restricted to informal writing. Colons and semicolons are available but are not common in ordinary text. Quotation marks are written as , and nested quotation marks as . Several bracket styles and dashes are available.

== History of the Japanese script ==

=== Importation of kanji ===

Japan&#x27;s first encounters with Chinese characters may have come as early as the 1st century AD with the King of Na gold seal, said to have been given by Emperor Guangwu of Han in AD 57 to a Japanese emissary. However, it is unlikely that the Japanese became literate in Chinese writing any earlier than the 4th century AD.

Initially Chinese characters were not used for writing Japanese, as literacy meant fluency in Classical Chinese, not the vernacular. Eventually a system called developed, which, along with kanji and something very similar to Chinese grammar, employed diacritics to hint at the Japanese translation. The earliest written history of Japan, the , compiled sometime before 712, was written in kanbun. Even today Japanese high schools and some junior high schools teach kanbun as part of the curriculum.

=== The development of man&#x27;yōgana ===
No full-fledged script for written Japanese existed until the development of , which appropriated kanji for their phonetic value (derived from their Chinese readings) rather than their semantic value. Man&#x27;yōgana was initially used to record poetry, as in the , compiled sometime before 759, whence the writing system derives its name. Some scholars claim that man&#x27;yōgana originated from Baekje, but this hypothesis is denied by mainstream Japanese scholars. The modern kana, namely hiragana and katakana, are simplifications and systemizations of man&#x27;yōgana.

Due to the large number of words and concepts entering Japan from China which had no native equivalent, many words entered Japanese directly, with a similar pronunciation to the original Chinese. This Chinese-derived reading is known as , and this vocabulary as a whole is referred to as Sino-Japanese in English and in Japanese. At the same time, native Japanese already had words corresponding to many borrowed kanji. Authors increasingly used kanji to represent these words. This Japanese-derived reading is known as . A kanji may have none, one, or several on&#x27;yomi and kun&#x27;yomi. Okurigana are written after the initial kanji for verbs and adjectives to give inflection and to help disambiguate a particular kanji&#x27;s reading. The same character may be read several different ways depending on the word. For example, the character is read &quot;i&quot; as the first syllable of , &quot;okona&quot; as the first three syllables of , &quot;gyō&quot; in the compound word , &quot;kō&quot; in the word , and &quot;an&quot; in the word .

Some linguists have compared the Japanese borrowing of Chinese-derived vocabulary as akin to the influx of Romance vocabulary into English during the Norman conquest of England. Like English, Japanese has many synonyms of differing origin, with words from both Chinese and native Japanese. Sino-Japanese is often considered more formal or literary, just as latinate words in English often mark a higher register.

=== Script reforms ===
==== Meiji period ====
The significant reforms of the 19th century Meiji era did not initially impact the Japanese writing system. However, the language itself was changing due to the increase in literacy resulting from education reforms, the massive influx of words (both borrowed from other languages or newly coined), and the ultimate success of movements such as the influential which resulted in Japanese being written in the colloquial form of the language instead of the wide range of historical and classical styles used previously. The difficulty of written Japanese was a topic of debate, with several proposals in the late 19th century that the number of kanji in use be limited. In addition, exposure to non-Japanese texts led to unsuccessful proposals that Japanese be written entirely in kana or rōmaji. This period saw Western-style punctuation marks introduced into Japanese writing.

In 1900, the Education Ministry introduced three reforms aimed at improving the process of education in Japanese writing:

* standardization of hiragana, eliminating the range of hentaigana then in use;
* restriction of the number of kanji taught in elementary schools to about 1,200;
* reform of the irregular kana representation of the Sino-Japanese readings of kanji to make them conform with the pronunciation.

The first two of these were generally accepted, but the third was hotly contested, particularly by conservatives, to the extent that it was withdrawn in 1908.

==== Pre–World War II ====
The partial failure of the 1900 reforms combined with the rise of nationalism in Japan effectively prevented further significant reform of the writing system. The period before World War II saw numerous proposals to restrict the number of kanji in use, and several newspapers voluntarily restricted their kanji usage and increased usage of furigana; however, there was no official endorsement of these, and much opposition. However, one successful reform was the standardization of hiragana, which involved reducing the possibilities of writing down Japanese morae down to only one hiragana character per morae, which led to labeling all the other previously used hiragana as hentaigana and discarding them in daily use.

==== Post–World War II ====
The period immediately following World War II saw a rapid and significant reform of the writing system. This was in part due to influence of the Occupation authorities, but to a significant extent was due to the removal of traditionalists from control of the educational system, which meant that previously stalled revisions could proceed. The major reforms were:

* —alignment of kana usage with modern pronunciation, replacing the old historical kana usage (1946);
* promulgation of various restricted sets of kanji:
** (1946), a collection of 1850 characters for use in schools, textbooks, etc.;
** kanji to be used in schools (1949);
** an additional collection of , which, supplementing the &quot;tōyō kanji&quot;, could be used in personal names (1951);
* simplifications of various complex kanji letter-forms .

At one stage, an advisor in the Occupation administration proposed a wholesale conversion to rōmaji, but it was not endorsed by other specialists and did not proceed.

In addition, the practice of writing horizontally in a right-to-left direction was generally replaced by left-to-right writing. The right-to-left order was considered a special case of vertical writing, with columns one character high, rather than horizontal writing per se; it was used for single lines of text on signs, etc. (e.g., the station sign at Tokyo reads , which is from right-to-left). The post-war reforms have mostly survived, although some of the restrictions have been relaxed. The replacement of the &quot;tōyō kanji&quot; in 1981 with the 1,945 —a modification of the &quot;tōyō kanji&quot;—was accompanied by a change from &quot;restriction&quot; to &quot;recommendation&quot;, and in general the educational authorities have become less active in further script reform. In 2004, the , maintained by the Ministry of Justice for use in personal names, was significantly enlarged. The &quot;jōyō kanji&quot; list was later extended to 2,136 characters in 2010.

==Romanization==

There are a number of methods of rendering Japanese in Roman letters. The Hepburn method of romanization, designed for English speakers, is a de facto standard widely used inside and outside Japan. The &quot;Kunrei-shiki&quot; system has a better correspondence with Japanese phonology. There are differences in the romanization, such as Kunrei-shiki writing &quot;ち&quot; as &quot;ti&quot;, while the Hepburn writes it as &quot;chi&quot;. Other systems of romanization include &quot;Nihon-shiki&quot;, JSL, and .

<text>Madeleine de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne (1498 – 28 April 1519) was a younger daughter of Jean III de La Tour (1467– 28 March 1501), Count of Auvergne and Lauraguais, and Jeanne de Bourbon, Duchess of Bourbon (1465–1511). She was a penultimate representative of the senior branch of the House of La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne. Madeleine is best known for being the mother of Catherine de&#x27; Medici, the future Queen of France.

==Biography==
===Marriage negotiations===
As part of his efforts to gain power in Italy, Francis I of France turned to making certain strategic alliances. On 8 December 1515, he and Pope Leo X met and signed an agreement of friendship, in which Francis agreed to ensure the Vatican&#x27;s authority over the Catholic Church in France, and Leo promised to support Francis&#x27; claim to the throne of Naples. This agreement, like most others of the time, was cemented with a marriage alliance. Leo&#x27;s nephew Lorenzo II de&#x27; Medici had just become the leader of the Florentine Republic in 1516. Francis wrote to congratulate him by stating, &quot;I intend to help you with all my power. I also wish to marry you off to some beautiful and good lady of noble birth and of my kin, so that the love which I bear you may grow and be strengthened&quot;. The &quot;good lady&quot; Francis proposed: his wealthy and distant relative Madeleine. Lorenzo duly accepted, as it was a great honor to be tied to the French royal family, especially since he was of lesser nobility (the Medici being ennobled only recently), albeit an extremely wealthy one. For Madeleine and her family, they were delighted to be tied into the sphere of the Pope himself.

===Wedding celebrations===
She married Duke Lorenzo II de&#x27; Medici in Château d&#x27;Amboise on 5 May 1518. Their wedding was a sumptuous festival that marked not only their union, but also the birth of a dauphin for Francis I. As with the other festivities Francis put on throughout his life, dancing figured very prominently. Dancing was done mostly in the Italian style. Seventy-two ladies were disguised in Italian, German, and other fashionable costumes, making for quite a rich display of silk and color. Francis gave Madeleine 10,000 gold coins, while Lorenzo offered rich gifts to France&#x27;s nobility.

===Death===
She died in Italy shortly before her husband on 28 April of the following year, of what is believed to have been the plague (some speculate that she may have been infected by syphilis from her husband). She had just given birth to a daughter, Catherine de&#x27; Medici (1519–1589), the future Queen of France and consort of Henry II. Both she and her husband were said to have been delighted at the birth of Catherine as if she were a boy.

===Inheritance===
As both of their parents were deceased, Madeleine and her elder sister Anne shared extensive properties in Auvergne, Clermont, Berry, Castres, and Louraguais. Anne inherited Auvergne and married John Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany in 1505. She outlived Madeleine by five years but died childless, after which the Counties of Auvergne and Boulogne as well as the barony of La Tour passed to Madeleine&#x27;s daughter Catherine de&#x27; Medici and then absorbed into the French Crown.

<doc id="1234504" wikidata="Q2972705" url="?curid=1234504" title="Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway">
<text>The Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway (CL&amp;N) was a local passenger and freight-carrying railroad in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio, connecting Cincinnati to Dayton via Lebanon. It was built in the late 19th century to give the town of Lebanon and Warren County better transportation facilities. The railroad was locally known as the &quot;Highland Route&quot;, since it followed the ridge between the Little and Great Miami rivers, and was the only line not affected by floods such as the Great Dayton Flood of 1913.

The line was completed in 1881, and the CL&amp;N was formed in 1885. The company went through multiple bankruptcies until the Pennsylvania Railroad gained control in 1896. CL&amp;N continued its own operations until 1921, and existed until 1926, when the parent company merged CL&amp;N and other smaller companies. Except for several years in the mid-1880s, when the line was under control of the narrow gauge Toledo, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad, it was not a major line, in part due to its steep approach to downtown Cincinnati. For this reason, portions of the line have been abandoned, beginning in 1952 with a segment north of Lebanon.

Passenger services from Cincinnati terminated at Lebanon until the early 1900s. Passenger service was eliminated circa 1910 and restored as of 1915, extended to Dayton until 1928. Passenger trains were eliminated entirely in 1934. Conrail, the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s successor, sold the remaining trackage in the 1980s to the Indiana and Ohio Railway, a short line now owned by Genesee &amp; Wyoming. That company continues to provide local freight service on the ex-CL&amp;N, and the Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad operates tourist trains on a portion of the line near Lebanon.

==History==

===Planning and grading, 1850–1876===
The town of Lebanon, Ohio, laid out in 1802, was bypassed by the Miami and Erie Canal in 1830; the branch Warren County Canal to Lebanon was wrecked by flooding in 1848. The Little Miami Railroad (1846, later a Pennsylvania line) and Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad (1851, later a B&amp;O line) followed the valleys of the Little and Great Miami rivers (the M&amp;E Canal had used the latter), also bypassing the highlands on which Lebanon lay. Residents of the town obtained a legislative charter in March 1850 for the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Xenia Railroad (CL&amp;X), which would extend from Cincinnati northeast through Lebanon to Xenia. At the latter town, the incorporators decided the most likely connection would be the New York and Erie Railroad, which was planning on extending into Ohio. Thus the line was planned to use the Erie&#x27;s broad gauge.
To enter the city of Cincinnati, the CL&amp;X would join the Dayton and Cincinnati Railroad (D&amp;C), which was planning the double-track Deer Creek Tunnel through the Walnut Hills, at Sharonville (then known as Sharon). Tunnel construction began in late 1852, and the CL&amp;X was finally organized under the charter in November. The CL&amp;X located right-of-way, and began construction in about April 1853, but was forced to stop work by the end of 1855 due to lack of funds. Only grading between Sharon and Lebanon, mostly north of Mason, had been completed. (The tunnel project also failed, and was eventually acquired by the CL&amp;N.) In July 1861, the courts appointed a receiver for the CL&amp;X, who in March 1869 sold the unfinished railroad, which had cost $83,885, to 40 area residents for $4,000. Five trustees would ensure that the property was not sold without a majority of its owners consenting. Twenty years after its canal connection was destroyed, Lebanon was still without a modern connection to the outside world, and its economy continued to stagnate.

The 1870s fad of the narrow gauge railway, which was cheaper than broader gauges to build and operate (for low volumes of traffic), presented a new possibility. The Dayton and South Eastern Railroad (D&amp;SE, later a B&amp;O line) was planning a narrow gauge line from the Jackson County mines through Xenia to Dayton, and a branch from Xenia through Lebanon would connect to the markets at Cincinnati. The editors of the local newspaper, &quot;The Western Star&quot;, encouraged citizens to support the project, but by taking a more active role and organizing a locally owned railroad company to ensure its completion. Editorials likened the situation to Aesop&#x27;s fable of Hercules and the Carter, where Hercules tells a stuck that he will not assist unless the carter himself is willing to help. In November 1874, residents of Lebanon and the surrounding area organized the narrow gauge Miami Valley Narrow Gauge Railway (renamed Miami Valley Railway in October 1876), which would complete the unfinished CL&amp;X as a branch of the D&amp;SE.

Slow stock subscriptions delayed surveying until June 1875, when a line was located between Xenia and the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad (M&amp;C, later a B&amp;O line) west of Norwood. Property owners in the villages of Norwood and Pleasant Ridge, wishing to develop their land as suburbs, put forward a proposition to relocate the line to the east through their land in exchange for free right-of-way, and to build a steam dummy line between Norwood and the horse car lines in Walnut Hills, which would provide Miami Valley passengers with a more direct entrance to downtown Cincinnati than the circuitous M&amp;C. However, in August, an even more direct route south of Norwood, through the rugged Deer Creek Valley, was suggested, by which the Miami Valley could obtain its own access to Cincinnati. After imposing heavy restrictions, which would require the construction of several trestles and a tunnel, the Cincinnati City Council granted the right-of-way through the valley, including Eden Park, to the railroad company. The owners of the old CL&amp;X grade sold it in April 1876 for $8,000 in stock of the new company, and most of the land outside Cincinnati had been bought by that summer. The Miami Valley resolved in May 1876 to build only north to Waynesville, a village southwest of Xenia, where the projected Waynesville, Port William and Jeffersonville Railroad and Jeffersonville, Mt. Sterling and Columbus Railroad would extend to Columbus, crossing the D&amp;SE at Octa. (The former completed most of its line, but abandoned it in 1887; the latter was able to grade only a portion.)

===Construction and early operations, 1876–1885===
President Seth S. Haines of Waynesville broke ground in Eden Park on September 1, 1876, although most early work was done outside Cincinnati. The company continued to be plagued by lack of funds, and, despite completion of the grade between Norwood and Waynesville within a year, work soon slowed and eventually stopped in late 1878. Contractor John B. Benedict brought a suit in December for breach of contract, alleging that he was not properly paid. During the trial, two embarrassing facts came to light: Haines and Benedict had signed a &quot;secret contract&quot; giving Haines a portion of the bonds paid to Benedict, and the price of the line south of Norwood had been artificially inflated so that the connecting Cincinnati and Eastern Railway (C&amp;E, later a N&amp;W line) would have to pay more for trackage rights into Cincinnati. However, it was nonpayment of interest on bonds that forced the Miami Valley into receivership in January and foreclosure in March 1880. Another decade had passed and Lebanon still lacked a railroad.

The Toledo, Delphos and Burlington Railroad (TD&amp;B), a growing narrow gauge system with roots in the town of Delphos, would finally give Lebanon its rail line. Together with a group of suburban Cincinnati investors, the TD&amp;B bought the unfinished grade at the foreclosure sale for $61,000 and incorporated the narrow gauge Cincinnati Northern Railway as its successor on June 8, 1880. (The TD&amp;B would also acquire the Dayton and South Eastern in February 1881.) At first the TD&amp;B and Cincinnati-area residents shared stock and management equally, but soon this was changed so that the former party would control all the stock for ease in future consolidation, and the latter would locally manage the road. As the TD&amp;B was in the process of building into Dayton from the north, it was decided that the new company would not use the grade all the way to Waynesville. Instead, the TD&amp;B would construct a connection from the D&amp;SE at a point they called Lebanon Junction, now inside Dayton near the intersection of Woodman and Rainier Drives, to the small village of Dodds. There the Cincinnati Northern would begin, following the Miami Valley&#x27;s route through Lebanon to Cincinnati. Construction resumed in late 1880, and proceeded rapidly thanks to funding from Ohio and Northeastern capitalists. Mixed train operations between Lebanon and Norwood, where connections could be made with the M&amp;C, began on May 30, 1881, and on September 5 the line was opened south to a streetcar connection at Oak Street, just north of the tunnel. Service was extended through the tunnel to the Eden Park entrance on January 12, 1882, and on February 13 a temporary Cincinnati depot opened just north of Court Street. With the completion of the TD&amp;B&#x27;s branch from Lebanon Junction to Dodds in December 1881, the Cincinnati-Dayton line was finally complete; Jackson County coal was first shipped over it in February 1882. Two short branches to the suburbs of Montgomery and Avondale—the latter built separately as the Spring Grove, Avondale and Cincinnati Railway (SGA&amp;C)—opened on November 14, 1881 and July 1, 1882, respectively. C&amp;E operations to Court Street began by April 1882, using the Cincinnati Northern south of a junction at Idlewild, and in October the Cincinnati Northern laid tracks across that street into its permanent depot at the southeast corner of the Broadway Street intersection.
The TD&amp;B absorbed its subsidiary, the Toledo, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad (TC&amp;StL), in March 1882, and took its name as more descriptive of the growing system, which hoped to become part of a nationwide narrow gauge network stretching southwest to Mexico City. One year later, in May 1883, the Cincinnati Northern and the SGA&amp;C were consolidated into the TC&amp;StL. However, the TC&amp;StL was constructed cheaply, with poor drainage and little ballast. While the Cincinnati Northern had been built to better standards, the connecting line between Lebanon Junction and Dodds was just as bad. The inadequate facilities and equipment, as well as difficulties in interchanging equipment with lines, contributed to its entering receivership in August 1883. The TC&amp;StL had six divisions at this time. Four of the five TC&amp;StL divisions south of Delphos were sold to their bondholders at auction in June 1884, and separate companies were soon organized for three of those: the Dayton and Toledo Railroad, Dayton and Ironton Railroad, and Iron Railway (named &quot;Iron Railroad&quot; prior to TC&amp;StL receivership). The Toledo-St. Louis line was sold in December 1885 and reorganized as the Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad, commonly known as the Clover Leaf Route. In July, George Hafer of Avondale replaced William J. Craig of Toledo as receiver of the Cincinnati Northern Division, allowing it to recover from Craig&#x27;s deferred maintenance. Hafer obtained a short-term lease from the trustees of the Dodds-Lebanon Junction line (officially the Cincinnati Division), allowing continued access to Dayton. Finally, on June 27, 1885, the Cincinnati Northern Division was sold for $200,000 to its bondholders, who incorporated the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway, with Hafer as president, on July 14 and transferred operations on August 1, 1885. The narrow gauge movement of the 1870s had failed, and all the ex-TC&amp;StL lines were converted to standard gauge within the next ten years.

===CL&amp;N, 1885–1926===

The newly organized CL&amp;N initially operated a main line from Court Street in Cincinnati to Dayton, leasing the track from Dodds to Lebanon Junction from the Cincinnati Division trustees, and trackage rights over the Dayton and Ironton Railroad (the old narrow gauge D&amp;SE line) into Dayton. But the latter was converted to in April 1887, and CL&amp;N service was cut back to Dodds, since the operations north of there were unprofitable even when it was able to reach Dayton. (The line from Lebanon to Dodds was leased in 1892 to the company organized to operate north of Dodds.) Avondale Branch operations were discontinued in August 1889, due to competition from the cheaper Mt. Auburn Cable Railway. Under Hafer&#x27;s leadership, new passenger and freight depots opened on the north side of Court Street in December 1885. In preparation for conversion to standard gauge, the CL&amp;N relaid rail and replaced bridges, including a straight trestle in the Deer Creek Valley, completed in January 1889, in place of a curving old narrow gauge structure. The first standard gauge rails were laid by August 1889 as part of a dual gauge setup south of Idlewild, when the Ohio and North Western Railroad (O&amp;NW, successor to the C&amp;E), which had converted its line to standard gauge, moved its trains from the Little Miami Railroad (Pennsylvania Railroad system) back to the CL&amp;N. Several months later, a third rail was laid north to East Norwood, allowing the O&amp;NW to connect with the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad (successor to the M&amp;C). After undertaking more improvements to the alignment, the company completed the conversion of the main line to Lebanon to standard gauge on September 16, 1894, although, until it acquired a full set of standard gauge equipment, much of the commuter service to Blue Ash continued to use the narrow gauge tracks.
Throughout the CL&amp;N&#x27;s independence, various larger companies were looking to acquire it, mainly for the valuable Court Street terminal property. The most persistent rumor was that the Cincinnati, Jackson and Mackinaw Railroad (CJ&amp;M, later a NYC line) would buy the CL&amp;N as an entrance to Cincinnati. The CJ&amp;M had built south from Michigan to Carlisle, Ohio in 1887, and initially acquired trackage rights over the CH&amp;D to reach Cincinnati. Negotiations between the CL&amp;N and CJ&amp;M convinced the CH&amp;D that the latter was capable of becoming a strong competitor, despite its poor financial state, and the CH&amp;D attempted to acquire the CJ&amp;M in 1892. But the CL&amp;N stopped the consolidation based on Ohio&#x27;s laws prohibiting such anti-competitive practices, and the CJ&amp;M continued to look at the CL&amp;N as a possible part of its line. After the CL&amp;N&#x27;s conversion to standard gauge was completed in 1894, the CJ&amp;M secured trackage rights over the CL&amp;N into Court Street, beginning service on January 27, 1896 via an extension from Carlisle to Franklin, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Big Four, later a NYC line) to Middletown, and the recently opened Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad to the CL&amp;N at Hageman. The CJ&amp;M also acquired the long-dormant Deer Creek Tunnel project in an attempt to construct its own route into the city, tired of dealing with Hafer and the CL&amp;N. The Pennsylvania Railroad, owner of the Little Miami Railroad that had been constructed east of Lebanon in the 1840s, entered the negotiations in 1896 to protect its Cincinnati-area interests, and in March it (through the Pennsylvania Company) acquired a majority of the CL&amp;N&#x27;s stock. Pennsylvania officials took over management in May, and in 1902 the CL&amp;N acquired the tunnel property and some terminal property near Court Street from the Cincinnati Northern Railroad, successor to the CJ&amp;M, which had become part of the Big Four and terminated its use of the CL&amp;N in 1901.

As a part of the Pennsylvania system, the CL&amp;N continued to operate its own property (which included the line north of Dodds after 1914) until January 1, 1921, when it was leased to the Pennsylvania. Starting at the end of 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission classified the CL&amp;N as a Class I railroad, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year in operating revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL&amp;N was leased.) However, net operating income, revenue minus costs, which had steadily climbed from the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania merged the CL&amp;N with several other small companies—the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroad—to create the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary. That company was merged into the Connecting Railway, previously a short link in Philadelphia, PA, in 1956, and its lessee merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Transportation.

===Other lines, 1889–1915===
The line north of Dodds, built by the TD&amp;B to connect the Cincinnati Northern to the D&amp;SE at Lebanon Junction, was sold separately at the June 1884 foreclosure sale, to its first-mortgage bondholders for $20,000. Initially operated under lease by the CL&amp;N, service was discontinued in April 1887 when the ex-D&amp;SE was converted from narrow gauge to . With its northern connection gone, and no on-line sources of revenue, there was no profit in operating the line. However, one such source would soon be created, when local businessman Henry Lewis decided to purchase nearby &quot;Dayton limestone&quot; quarries at Centerville. He bought the abandoned rail line from the bondholders&#x27; trustees for $40,000 in December 1888, and in January 1889 organized the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad (DL&amp;C). Extensions on both ends were planned, north into downtown Dayton and south to a standard gauge connection. Lewis finished converting the narrow gauge line to standard gauge in January 1891, and initially leased it to the Dayton, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, successor to the D&amp;SE. He leased in 1890 and later bought land in Dayton for the proposed terminal, and in early 1892 he acquired the quarries at Centerville, giving the line its source of traffic. The DL&amp;C bought the line from Lewis in March 1892 for $189,000 in stock, and in June it acquired a lease on the CL&amp;N&#x27;s line between Dodds and Lebanon. After converting the track to standard gauge, the DL&amp;C began operations into Lebanon in late December 1892. However, it was unable to negotiate trackage rights with the Cincinnati, Dayton and Ironton Railroad (the latest name for the ex-D&amp;SE), and only operated north to Lebanon Junction, where passengers could transfer to that company&#x27;s trains into Dayton. Throughout its life, the DL&amp;C competed with the CL&amp;N wherever possible; for example, the CL&amp;N advertised (along with the Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad and Big Four) a faster route between Lebanon and Dayton via Hageman and Middletown.
Lewis died in 1893, and in the next decade the DL&amp;C built no new lines. However, a group of investors bought the company, including the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis&#x27;s heirs. The first segment of the line into downtown Dayton was completed in late 1902, branching off the main line at Hempstead and ending at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unable to obtain a franchise from Dayton, and still unprofitable, the DL&amp;C entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at foreclosure in April 1907 and reorganized in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had organized the new company succeeded in obtaining the franchise, and sold the stock to a new group of investors in January 1909. Construction was restarted in April, and in November the branch reached the intersection of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National Cash Register plant. Finally, after completing the cuts and fills required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, the DL&amp;C opened its new main line in 1912, to a passenger depot on the north side of Washington Street, several blocks south and west of the city&#x27;s main Union Station. A freight depot was located just to the north, at Eaker Street, and just beyond was an interchange track (not part of the original line) connecting to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (B&amp;O system) and, via that line, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, part of the Pennsylvania system).

The other line eventually acquired by the CL&amp;N was the Middletown and Cincinnati Railway (M&amp;C, not to be confused with the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad discussed earlier). Paul J. Sorg, owner of a tobacco plant east of Middletown, was unhappy with the service provided by the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad (then independent) and Cincinnati and Springfield Railway (Big Four system), both of which bypassed the center of town. Sorg and associates incorporated the M&amp;C in early 1890, and surveyed a line from Middletown, which lay in the Great Miami River valley, southeast to a point that would be known as Middletown Junction on the Little Miami Railroad (Pennsylvania system). Construction on the majority of the route, which crossed the CL&amp;N at Hageman, was complete by September 1891, and a truss bridge over the Little Miami River opened in early 1892, linking the line to the Pennsylvania. Access into central Middletown was delayed until December, when it was finally able to cross the CH&amp;D to its depot. As opposed to the CL&amp;N and DL&amp;C, the M&amp;C was straight and flat, giving a smooth ride, and turned a reasonable profit. The revenue was not enough, however, to pay off the bonds, and the M&amp;C entered receivership in July 1894. The holders of liens against the property bought the line at foreclosure in October for $335,000, incorporated the Middletown and Cincinnati &quot;Railroad&quot; in December, and elected Sorg president.

Sorg died on May 28, 1902, and six days later the CL&amp;N, owned by the Pennsylvania since 1896, bought its property for $400,000 and began operating it as a branch. The DL&amp;C would be acquired twelve years later, after the Great Dayton Flood of 1913. The CL&amp;N and DL&amp;C, built on the highlands between the river valleys, combined to provide the only access into Dayton during the disaster. The Pennsylvania realized that the DL&amp;C would make a good acquisition in the event of future flooding, and had the CL&amp;N buy and begin operating the DL&amp;C for about $700,000 in December 1914. (Through service between Cincinnati and Dayton had begun that summer.) The DL&amp;C built a short connection from Lebanon Junction to the Panhandle Route at Clement in early 1915, and on July 1 its property became that of the CL&amp;N.

===Abandonments, 1917–1975===
Competition from interurbans, specifically the Cincinnati-Lebanon Interurban Railway and Terminal Company, took away passengers from the CL&amp;N beginning in 1903. But the interurban began to decline, going out of business in 1922, and it was motor vehicles that would kill the CL&amp;N&#x27;s passenger service. The first line to go was the Middletown Branch, discontinued in 1917; the short branch to Montgomery became freight-only in 1926. All service north of Lebanon ended in 1928, and in 1931 only one mixed train between Court Street and Lebanon was left on the schedule.

The less-convenient Cincinnati Union Terminal replaced Court Street in 1933, as agreed upon by all railroads participating in its construction. CL&amp;N trains reached the station via trackage rights on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (ex-M&amp;C) south of East Norwood. This was never popular among CL&amp;N riders, and the last scheduled passenger train on the former CL&amp;N ran on January 31, 1934.

With passenger service gone, and several cross-connections to other Pennsylvania lines, the CL&amp;N was no longer needed as a through route. Several years after the Montgomery Branch was fully abandoned in 1933, the Pennsylvania discontinued freight service between Blue Ash and Mason and between Lebanon and Lytle; trains continued to reach Lebanon via the Little Miami Railroad and Middletown Branch. Service was resumed on the entire line during World War II, but the Lebanon-Lytle segment was torn up in 1952.

After the Pennsylvania merged into Penn Central in 1968, a piece north from Brecon was again abandoned, as was the short piece of the Middletown Branch east of the main line at Hageman, with Lebanon service now coming from the ex-New York Central at Middletown. The line through the Deer Creek Valley into Court Street was also abandoned, and the old freight depot was torn down in 1975.

=== Sales, 1975–present ===
When the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) acquired the assets of the bankrupt Penn Central in 1976, it was allowed to choose which lines to keep and which to abandon. The line between Avondale and Brecon still saw heavy freight traffic, and there would still be a reasonable amount of traffic to Mason and Hempstead. Thus Conrail bought about half of the ex-CL&amp;N, including the main line from Cincinnati to Brecon (Blue Ash Secondary Track), Mason to Hageman (Mason Secondary Track), Hempstead to Pasadena (Kettering Running Track), and Patterson Road to Dayton (DP&amp;L Industrial Track), as well as Middletown to Hageman (Middletown Secondary) and Hempstead to Clement (Clement Running Track).

Ownership of the remaining segments—Brecon to Mason, Hageman to Lebanon, Lytle to Hempstead, Pasadena to Patterson Road, and Hageman to Middletown Junction—remained with the Penn Central trustees, although, with local funding, Conrail operated the two segments from Hageman to Lebanon and Centerville to Hempstead as &quot;light density lines&quot;. Tracks between Lytle and Centerville were torn up in 1979. Since then, several more segments have been abandoned, including Avondale to McCullough and Centerville to Kettering.

Short line Indiana and Ohio Railway (IORY) acquired most of the remainder in the 1980s, beginning operations from Monroe (near Middletown) to Mason and Lebanon in March 1985, and McCullough to Brecon in December 1986. The city of Lebanon has bought the Hageman-Lebanon segment, initially owned by the Penn Central trustees, and the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority acquired the property between McCullough and Brecon in 1997 for a proposed public transit line. (IORY continues to operate freight on both these segments.)

The IORY began running tourist trains on the Lebanon segment in 1985. The passenger operations were split in 1996, going through several renamings to Turtle Creek Valley Railway, Turtle Creek and Lebanon Railway, and finally Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad. Three short segments of line at Middletown and Dayton remained with Conrail until its 1999 breakup, when the Norfolk Southern Railway acquired Conrail&#x27;s assets in southwestern Ohio.

As of 2022, two segments on the southern part of the former line are in use by IORY as the Blue Ash Subdivision and Mason Subdivision, with a gap between them, while a short section of its northernmost extent is used as a siding by Norfolk Southern. The rest of the track has been removed, although the right-of-way is discernible in places.

==Route description==
Lying on the highlands between the Little and Great Miami Rivers, the CL&amp;N was commonly known as the &quot;Highland Route&quot;. While it normally received only local traffic, its location was a distinct advantage during floods. This was first demonstrated during the Flood of 1884, when the rising Ohio River cut off all other railroads from downtown Cincinnati. But the load was too much for the narrow gauge TC&amp;StL, and several companies switched to Miami and Erie Canal boats to make the connections until the waters subsided. Similar Cincinnati floods happened in 1883, 1897, 1898, 1907, and 1937, but in 1913 the Great Dayton Flood inundated that city, then lying at the north end of the independent DL&amp;C. That company had just completed its line into downtown Dayton, when, less than a year later, the Loramie Reservoir broke through its levees and sent a swell of water through down the Great Miami River and into the city. As with the Cincinnati floods, only the CL&amp;N and DL&amp;C were unaffected, and relief supplies were sent north from Cincinnati via Lebanon to the National Cash Register plant.
The line began on the east side of downtown Cincinnati, at the corner of Eggleston Avenue and Court Street. The site of the brick freight depot, closed in 1969 and demolished in 1975, is now owned by Greyhound Lines, which uses it as an intercity bus terminal. A track built in 1887 crossed Court Street, connecting with the Little Miami Railroad&#x27;s Eggleston Avenue Connection for freight transfer. The line began by climbing the Deer Creek Valley, the only feasible rail entrance to downtown Cincinnati that did not follow a river valley. When the railroad was built in the late 1870s, the valley was used by the city as a dump. An 1852 city ordinance provided for raising the ground level, beginning with the raising of Court Street by as much as . To follow the eventual surface level and avoid the steep hillsides, the railroad was built on trestles for much of its ascent, with a maximum grade of 3.5%. After leaving the depot, the line traversed an S-shaped trestle to the east side of the valley, before crossing Elsinore Place and Eden Park Drive at grade, with a second trestle between these streets. (The former was replaced in January 1889 with a straighter single-track trestle.) A bridge took the line over Florence Avenue, and it then passed through the neighborhood of Mount Auburn before passing under the summit through the cut-and-cover Oak Street Tunnel north of McMillan Street. The line started its gradual descent as it left the tunnel, generally following the existing ground level and crossing streets at grade.
Double tracks initially stretched from Court Street to near Fredonia Avenue, where the Avondale Branch split for the Cincinnati Zoo. When the line was converted to in 1894, the tunnel and McMillan Street underpass were not wide enough for a double-track line, yet two standard gauge tracks were laid side-by-side. After an accident in 1916, the tracks were relaid as a gauntlet track. The trestles were rebuilt as single-track in 1888 and 1889, after which double track extended only from Eden Park Drive to Avondale. Due to increased passenger traffic, the line was re-widened not only south to Court Street but also north to Norwood from 1902 to 1904, once the valley had been filled in. Beyond Avondale, the CL&amp;N descended through Idlewild, where two Norfolk and Western Railway lines diverged—the Cincinnati and Eastern Railway east to Portsmouth and the Cincinnati Connecting Belt Railroad northwest to a junction near Elmwood Place. The railway began to climb again at East Norwood, where it crossed the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad (Baltimore and Ohio Railroad), reaching the flat highlands at Deer Park. In the late 1880s, the CL&amp;N, with its frequent commuter service, contributed to the development of suburbs along its line including Idlewild, East Norwood, Silverton, Deer Park, and Hazelwood. At Hopkins Avenue in Norwood, commuters unsatisfied with the bare platform built by the railroad company raised $1500 to build a station building, which opened on August 1, 1888, and was owned by the Hopkins Avenue Depot Company until service ended in the 1930s. It was later used as a gas station, and now houses a chiropractor. As part of its bicentennial celebration, the city of Silverton built a replica of its former CL&amp;N station with a museum inside.

Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built McCullough Yard in 1927, improving switching operations for the growing industrial base in Norwood. A connection was included to the Pennsylvania&#x27;s Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL&amp;N crossed over north of the yard. In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL&amp;N curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between Sharonville and Lebanon. Just beyond, it began to descend slowly through Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and then rose slightly, alongside Turtle Creek, to Lebanon. The Pennsylvania tore down the original Lebanon passenger station in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, tore down the freight depot, and erected a replica of the old passenger depot in its place, with a gift shop inside.

Leaving Lebanon, the line ascended a small gully and then headed north-northeasterly across the highlands to Dodds. The never-used grade from Dodds to Waynesville descended into the Little Miami River valley via Newman Run before turning north and ending at the latter village. Portions of the right-of-way and stone abutments for several never-built bridges remain on what is now farmland. The line as completed turned north at Dodds, and required several cuts and fills to traverse the rolling terrain. At Hempstead, just north of Hempstead Road, the line split. The original route continued north, parallel to Woodman Drive, to the old Dayton and South Eastern Railroad (now the Iron Horse Trail) at Lebanon Junction. A 1915 extension was built parallel to the ex-D&amp;SE, and ended at the Panhandle Route (now the Creekside Trail to the east) at Clement. Part of this line is still operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway, and to the south the right-of-way is being used for an extension of the Iron Horse Trail. The other branch headed northwesterly into downtown Dayton, steadily descending as it passed south of the University of Dayton and alongside the Great Miami River. The main passenger and freight depots were at Washington Street, which the CL&amp;N passed over on the first such grade separation in Dayton. The first freight depot opened with the line in 1912, and was replaced in 1930 by a larger structure, itself torn down in 1966.

==Equipment==
When the CL&amp;N converted to in 1894, it initially mounted its narrow gauge passenger cars on standard gauge trucks. These were replaced with standard gauge cars after the Pennsylvania acquisition in 1896.

The first locomotive on the line, a Baldwin 4-4-0 named &quot;Warren County No. 1&quot;, was bought in 1877 by the Miami Valley Railway. In all, the CL&amp;N and predecessors had nine narrow gauge locomotives, bought from four different manufacturers. Two were disposed of in the 1880s, and, of the seven remaining into the 1890s, six provided main line service and one was used as a switching and helper locomotive.
Standard gauge operations began in 1894 with five locomotives, and the narrow gauge equipment was kept temporarily for commuter runs to Blue Ash. Later acquisitions, as well as consolidations with other companies, raised the number to 23 in 1920, its final year of independent operation.

<doc id="1234508" wikidata="Q4572328" url="?curid=1234508" title="Portuguese vocabulary">
<text>Most of the Portuguese vocabulary comes from Latin because Portuguese is a Romance language. 

However, other languages that came into contact with it have also left their mark. In the thirteenth century, the lexicon of Portuguese had about 80% words of Latin origin and 20% of pre-Roman Gallaecian and Celtiberian, Germanic, Greek and Arabic origin.

==Pre-Roman languages of Portugal ==

Traces of the languages from native peoples of western Iberia (Gallaeci, Lusitanians, Celtici or Conii) persist in Portuguese, as shown below. Most of the pre-Roman placenames or rivers in Portugal originate from the Hispano-Celtic Gallaecian and Celtiberian languages. There are also a few Iberian, Basque and Tartessian components in Portuguese.

===List of Portuguese words of Iberian and Basque origin===

====Iberian-Basque====

* &quot;manteiga&quot; &quot;butter&quot; ***Uncertain origin, possibly Lat. &quot;mantica&quot;

Projections on Iberian vocabulary, toponyms and derivations in Portuguese, indicate just a few dozen words in total.

====Basque====

The Basque influence in Portuguese is believed to have entered mainly through Spanish, because many of those who took part in the Reconquista and later repopulation campaigns in Portugal, were of Basque lineage.

* &quot;carrasco&quot; &quot;executioner&quot; or &quot;Portuguese oak&quot;, from Basque &quot;karraska&quot; &quot;thunder, crash of falling tree&quot;
* &quot;sarna&quot; &quot;scabies&quot; from Medieval Latin (7th century, Isidore of Seville, &quot;Origines&quot;, 4.8.68), but as &quot;serna&quot; attested in Theodorus Priscianus (Constantinople, 4th century). however, after studying the variants of the word in the Latin medical treatises, proposes a Hispano-Celtic origin; cf. Middle Welsh &quot;sarn&quot; &quot;mess&quot; and &quot;sarnaf&quot; &quot;to wreck&quot;.

=====Names of Basque origin=====

======Forenames======
* Inácio variant of &quot;Ignatius&quot;. ***Of uncertain origin. Often claimed an Etruscan-Latinised derivation but probably Pre-Roman Iberian, Celtiberian or Basque see* Íñigo, ÍñakiVariants: Egnatius (Ancient Roman), Iñaki (Basque), Ignasi (Catalan), Ignác (Czech), Ignaas (Dutch), Iggy (English), Ignace (French), Ignatz (German), Ignác (Hungarian), Ignazio (Italian), Ignas (Lithuanian), Ignacy (Polish), Ignatiy (Russian), Ignac, Ignacij, Nace (Slovene), Ignacio, Nacho, Nacio (Spanish)
* Vasco derived from Basque &quot;belasko&quot;, &#x27;small raven&#x27;
* Xavier, from Basque Xabier, from &quot;etxe berri&quot;, meaning &#x27;new house&#x27; or &#x27;new home&#x27;
* Ximeno, a variant of the medieval Basque given name Semen, root &quot;seme &lt; senbe&quot; &#x27;son&#x27; as found in the ancient Aquitanian name &quot;Sembetten&quot;, attested form &quot;sehi&quot; as &#x27;child&#x27;, hypothetical ancient root *seni (cf. Koldo Mitxelena and modern form &quot;senide&quot; = &#x27;brother or sister&#x27;, &#x27;relative&#x27;)

======Surnames======

* Velasco derived from Basque &quot;belasko&quot;, &#x27;small raven&#x27;

====Celtic====

Although there is not a comprehensive study or wordcount on how much Celtic, (particularly Gallaecian and words from the Hispano-Celtic group) survived in Portuguese (and Galician); it is fair to say that after Latin, this is the second largest component in the Portuguese culture and language. Projections on Celtic vocabulary (some words may have come via French borrowings starting in the 12th century), toponyms and derivations in Portuguese, indicate over 3,000 words. The Celtic substratum is often overlooked, due to the strong Latinisation of Celtic-derived words in Portuguese and the ancient linguistic threads of pre-Roman origin.

===List of Portuguese words of Celtic origin===
====Placenames====

=== Names ===
==== Forenames ====
==== Surnames ====
A considerable number of the Portuguese surnames (spread in all Portuguese-speaking countries and ex-colonies today) is Celtic or of Latinised, Celtic-borrowings. This is not a comprehensive list of those.

==Germanic languages==
The main Germanic influence in Portuguese were the Suebi and Visigoths (also Buri and Vandals).

Their vocabulary in Portuguese is often related to warfare/military topics, animals texugo (badger), natural world orvalho (dew), Human qualities like franqueza (frankness, candour), orgulho (pride), some verbs like ganhar (to gain), town and placenames such as Aldão, Alderete, Albergaria-a-Velha, Albergaria-a-Nova (from Gothic &#x27;haribergo&#x27;), Ermesinde and Esposende, where &quot;sinde&quot; and &quot;sende&quot; for instance; are derived from the Germanic &quot;sinths&quot; (military expedition), numerous Suebi derivations like, Freamunde (from &#x27;Fredemundus&#x27;), Vermunde, Amonde (Onomondi), Samonde, Gimonde, Aldão, Guadramil, Gondomil, Samil, Gosende, Guilhofrei (from Geodefredis), Esmoriz, Esmeriz (toponymics of Hermeric, king of the Suebians), Alhariz (toponymic of Aliaricus), Oriz, Touriz, Roriz, Gavieira, Gondoriz, Gondizalves, Gondar, Gondomar (from Gundomarus), Gondarém, Gudim, Guimarães (from Vimara), Torres Vedras (from Turres Veteras, &#x27;old tower&#x27;), Sousa, Terras de Sousa and Terras de Bouro (land of the Buri), Serra do Bouro, Bouro, are found mainly in the Minho (Braga) and Douro (Porto) regions- these two provinces present the highest concentration of Germanic toponyms in the Iberian Peninsula, as they historically correspond to old the Suebic Kingdom in the middle-ages. 

Many of the Germanic words entered the language during the late antiquity, either as words introduced into Vulgar Latin elsewhere, or as words brought along by the Suebi who settled in Gallaecia (Northern Portugal and Galicia) in the 5th century, and also by the Visigoths who annexed the Suebic Kingdom in 585 and ruled until the 8th century AD.
It is very difficult to establish how the Suebi and Visigoth dialects differed from each other during that period, how much linguistic assimilation occurred, and therefore almost impossible to classify words with etymological certainty.

===List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin===

Because they have different Germanic origins, this list is divided into words that come from English, Frankish, Langobardic, Middle Dutch, Middle High German, Middle Low German, Old English, Old High German, Old Norse, Old Swedish, and Visigothic and finally, words which come from a Germanic root, where the specific source is unknown or uncertain. Projections indicate over 600 Germanic words in Portuguese, with a tendency to increase due to English, German and other modern influences. Some of these words existed in Latin as loanwords from other languages. Some of these words have alternate etymologies and may also appear on a list of Galician words from a different language. Some words contain non-Germanic elements. Any form with an asterisk (*) is unattested and therefore hypothetical.

===Germanic Names===
Ancient Roman-derived names are the most numerous in Portugal and Portuguese-speaking countries. Together with Germanic-derived names they constitute the majority of those (and similarly to most European/Western countries inherited also a number of ancient Greek and Hebrew names) today. With globalisation, a number of new Germanic names (and other origins) exist in Portuguese. Because they stem from the same root, Portuguese and Galician share common Germanic names, inherited from the Suevi (who settled in northern Portugal and Galicia in 409 AD), Visigoths, Vandals, Buri and other Germanic peoples, were often the most common Portuguese-Galician names during the early and high Middle Ages. This article deals with Germanic personal names recorded and used in northern Portugal, Galicia and its adjoining regions: territories of the kingdom of the Suebi during the early Middle Ages from its 409 settlement to the 12th century.
== Germanic names ==
Germanic names were the most common personal names in Portugal-Galicia (Gallaecia) during the early and high Middle Ages, surpassing Christian and Roman names in number and popularity. The names, primarily of East Germanic origin, were used by the Suebi, Goths, Vandals and Burgundians. With the names, the Galicians-Portuguese inherited the Germanic onomastic system; a person used one name (sometimes a nickname or alias), with no surname, occasionally adding a patronymic. More than 1,000 such names have been preserved in local records. and in local toponyms.

Many of the Germanic names were composite, with the second element usually a noun with the same gender of the bearer. Others were hypocorisms formed from a composite name or deriving from it. Less frequently, a name was a noun or an adjective.

These names were transmitted to the Suevi with the usual Germanic rules of inheritance, which were variations (passing one element of the name; Rechiar was the son of Rechila, who was the son of Hermeric) and alliteration (names beginning with the same sound; Maldras was the son of the nobleman Masila). Full names were later transmitted from grandfather to grandson (commemoration), following a trend common until the present in most of western Europe.

=== Adaptations ===
In addition to the conversion of many Germanic endings into Romance or Latin endings, the names had phonetic adaptations such as the change of word stress from the first to the penultimate syllable, the conversion of most [þ] into [t] or [d] and the conversion of [h] into [k] before a consonant. [W] was initially preserved, although noted as [u] or [oy] before becoming [gw] (or, less commonly, [b]). These early inherited names underwent Western Romance and Galician changes from Latin, such as consonant lenition and palatalization. This contributed to a large number of variants in recorded names; Ostrofredus was recorded in Portugal-Galicia as Ortofredus, Ostofredo, Ostouredus, Ostrofedone, Stobredo and Strofredo.

== Names used by the Suevi ==
The following names, used by the Suevi of Gallaecia during the fifth and sixth centuries, were recorded in chronicles, inscriptions and acts of local ecclesiastical councils:
&quot;Hermericus, Heremigarius, Rechila, Rechiarius, Agriulfum, Maldras, Massila, Framta, Frumarius, Rechimundus, Remismundus, Veremundus, Chararici, Ariamirus, Ildericus, Theudomirus, Miro, Nitigisius, Uittimer, Anila, Remisol, Adoric, Eboricus, Siseguntia f, Audeca, Malaricus, Pantardus, Neufila, Hildemirus, Commundus, Ermaricus, Sunila, Becilla, Gardingus, Argiovitus, Gomedei, Rodomiro, Ermengontia f, Remisiwera f, Thuresmuda f, Suinthiliuba f.&quot;

Many of the names, used by kings such as Miro, Reckila and Theudemirus, were used for local toponyms: Mirón, Requián, Requiás, Requiás and Receá, Tuimil and Toimil.

== Roots ==

The following is a list of the roots used to form Germanic personal names in Galicia-Portugal and northwestern Iberia. Many are related to war, victory, fame, boldness, strength and warlike qualities (&quot;bald-, funs-, hild-, gund-, nand-, rod-, seg-, send-&quot;), totemic animals (&quot;ar-, wulf-, ber-, ebur-&quot;) and weapons (&quot;brand-, bruni-, rand-, saru-&quot;); many others refer to knowledge, love and other peaceful qualities (&quot;fred-, leob-, mun-, ragi-, rad-, uin-&quot;). Some refer to the condition of ruler or master (&quot;fro-, ric-, vald-, Froya, Theodinus, Tructinus, Hendinus&quot;). Another group refers to the tribe, nation or country (&quot;conia-, fulc-, teod-, leod-, man-, truct-, gavi-, gogi-, kend-&quot;), and another appears to refer to Huns (&quot;Hun-&quot;), Suevi (&quot;Sav-&quot;), Goths (&quot;Gut-&quot;), Vandals (&quot;Vandal-&quot;), Celts (&quot;Vala-&quot;), Vendians/Slavs (&quot;Venet-&quot;), Galindians/Balths (&quot;Galind-&quot;), Franks (&quot;Frank-&quot;), Saxons (&quot;Sax-&quot;), Angles (&quot;Engl-&quot;), Danes (&quot;Dan-&quot;) and other peoples. Although some elements are identical to others found in Celtic anthroponymy (&quot;And-, Dag-, -mar, -riks&quot;), others appear to be adaptations of Latin words and names incorporated in the Danube region: &quot;Florens, Fortis, Crescens&quot;.

During that period, although the local populations continued to speak Western Romance, and further south Mozarabic dialects; Arabic being the elite language, lent new words to Portuguese, thanks to a rich cultural and scientific legacy left in the Iberian Peninsula and the Western world in the Middle Ages.

<text>The Córas Iompair Éireann 101 Class locomotives, numbered B101-B112, were built in 1956 by the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. They were fitted with Sulzer 6LDA28 engines of , with four Metropolitan-Vickers MV137 traction motors. They were of A1A-A1A wheel arrangement, weighed 75 tonnes and had a maximum speed of .

==History==
With their design, size and axle loading, they were intended for mixed traffic duties, hauling both freight and passenger trains. They found regular use primarily on the Waterford-Mallow-Tralee line and also on the Tralee-Newcastle West-Limerick line. Given that they were the first main group of diesel locos used in Ireland, they proved very successful and quickly gained a reputation for comfort and reliability by contrast to the poor cab conditions and suspension rocking of the 113 Class and the interminable breakdowns of the A Class and C Class locomotives. However, during the 1960s many of the secondary lines that they were used on were closed and following the arrival of the 181 Class, the 101s were relegated to goods, permanent way and pilot duties.

The first withdrawal took place in 1969 (B111), and the last in February 1978 (B106). A proposal to re-engine them in the light of similar refurbishments of the Class 001 and Class 201 came to nothing, and the decision was taken to order new locomotives in the form of the 071 Class instead.

After withdrawal, the entire class was lined up together with the two 113 Class locomotives to form a sound barrier around Inchicore Works. Official withdrawal of the class came in April 1984, and the majority were scrapped between December 1986 and March 1987.

==Preservation==
One locomotive, No. 103 survived and has been preserved by the Irish Traction Group, and is currently in storage at Carrick-on-Suir railway station. It was purchased by the group in 1993 directly from Iarnród Éireann and is awaiting eventual restoration.

==Model==
A resin OO gauge model kit is available from Studio Scale Models, with etched brass/whitemetal detailing and a selection of decals to cover various liveries.

<doc id="1234514" wikidata="Q1666370" url="?curid=1234514" title="Kildare County F.C.">
<text>Kildare County F.C. () was an Irish association football club based in Newbridge, County Kildare. Between 2002–03 and 2009 they played in the League of Ireland First Division. During this time they also entered a team in the League of Ireland U21 Division.

==History==
===Foundation===
Kildare County was formed in 2002 by members of Newbridge Town F.C. in order to enter a team in the League of Ireland First Division. After St Francis withdrew from the First Division just two weeks before the start of the 2001–02 season, the League of Ireland began to look for a replacement club for 2002–03. Twelve clubs, including Newbridge Town, were approached to see if they were interested in joining the First Division. Members of Newbridge Town subsequently decided to form Kildare County as a separate legal entity and applied to join the First Division. The name Kildare County was chosen in an attempt to attract potential sponsors, players and supporters from throughout County Kildare. In February 2002 it was announced that Kildare County would be offered the First Division place ahead of Mullingar Town.

===Early seasons===
In March 2002 Kildare County appointed Dermot Keely as their first manager and John Gill as his assistant. On 15 June 2002 the club made their official debut in a friendly against Bray Wanderers. The game finished 2–2 with Keith O&#x27;Connor and Alan Kelly becoming the first and second players to score for County. On 6 July 2002 Kildare County made their competitive debut against Limerick at Station Road in a First Division Cup game. Philip Gorman and Shey Zellor scored for County as they won 2–0. On 24 August County made their League of Ireland First Division debut at Station Road again against Limerick. This time they lost 3–1 with Philip Gorman scoring the club&#x27;s first league goal. Dermot Keely remained in charge of County for the 2002–03 season, guiding them to fifth place. In July 2003, midway through the 2003 season, Keely resigned as County manager in order to take charge of Derry City. During their first three seasons in the League of Ireland First Division, Kildare County challenged for promotion to the League of Ireland Premier Division and on each occasion finished just outside the qualifying places for the promotion play-offs. In the 2002–03 First Division Cup they won their regional group and finished as overall runners up, losing 4–0 on aggregate in the final to Finn Harps. They were also quarter-finalists in both the 2003 and 2004 FAI Cups.

===Decline===

Between 2005 and 2009, Kildare County finished in the bottom half of League of Ireland First Division table every season. In 2008 Kildare County finished bottom of the table and were initially relegated to the A Championship after losing the promotion/relegation play-off to Mervue United. However they subsequently gained a reprieve after Cobh Ramblers were refused a First Division license and were relegated directly from the 2008 Premier Division to the A Championship. In 2009 Kildare County again finished bottom of the table and they subsequently withdrew from the league. The last fixture the club played was against Shelbourne on Saturday, 7 November 2009. In the week before the game the entire club board and the team manager Joe Somerville resigned, leaving the club&#x27;s players unpaid. The players were owed a total of €21,650 and as a result were reluctant to take to the pitch. However Stephen McGuinness, the general secretary of the PFAI, persuaded the players to participate in the game. Meanwhile, fans had to run the ticket sales and canteen. County lost 5–1 and after fulfilling this last game, it was officially over. County were due to play Salthill Devon in a promotion/relegation play-off but as a result of their resignation this did not happen and Salthill Devon subsequently replaced Kildare County in the 2010 First Division.

===U21 Division===
In addition to playing in the League of Ireland First Division, Kildare County also entered a team in the
League of Ireland U21 Division. In 2006, with a team managed by Thomas Donnelly, they reached the Enda McGuill Cup final, losing 1–0 to Cork City in the final.

<text>A nanoparticle or ultrafine particle is a particle of matter 1 to 100 nanometres (nm) in diameter. The term is sometimes used for larger particles, up to 500 nm, or fibers and tubes that are less than 100 nm in only two directions. At the lowest range, metal particles smaller than 1 nm are usually called atom clusters instead.

Nanoparticles are distinguished from microparticles (1-1000 μm), &quot;fine particles&quot; (sized between 100 and 2500 nm), and &quot;coarse particles&quot; (ranging from 2500 to 10,000 nm), because their smaller size drives very different physical or chemical properties, like colloidal properties and ultrafast optical effects or electric properties.

Being more subject to the Brownian motion, they usually do not sediment, like colloidal particles that conversely are usually understood to range from 1 to 1000 nm.

Being much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light (400-700 nm), nanoparticles cannot be seen with ordinary optical microscopes, requiring the use of electron microscopes or microscopes with laser. For the same reason, dispersions of nanoparticles in transparent media can be transparent, whereas suspensions of larger particles usually scatter some or all visible light incident on them. Nanoparticles also easily pass through common filters, such as common ceramic candles, so that separation from liquids requires special nanofiltration techniques.

The properties of nanoparticles often differ markedly from those of larger particles of the same substance. Since the typical diameter of an atom is between 0.15 and 0.6 nm, a large fraction of the nanoparticle&#x27;s material lies within a few atomic diameters of its surface. Therefore, the properties of that surface layer may dominate over those of the bulk material. This effect is particularly strong for nanoparticles dispersed in a medium of different composition since the interactions between the two materials at their interface also becomes significant.
Nanoparticles occur widely in nature and are objects of study in many sciences such as chemistry, physics, geology, and biology. Being at the transition between bulk materials and atomic or molecular structures, they often exhibit phenomena that are not observed at either scale. They are an important component of atmospheric pollution, and key ingredients in many industrialized products such as paints, plastics, metals, ceramics, and magnetic products. The production of nanoparticles with specific properties is a branch of nanotechnology.

In general, the small size of nanoparticles leads to a lower concentration of point defects compared to their bulk counterparts, but they do support a variety of dislocations that can be visualized using high-resolution electron microscopes. However, nanoparticles exhibit different dislocation mechanics, which, together with their unique surface structures, results in mechanical properties that are different from the bulk material.

Non-spherical nanoparticles (e.g., prisms, cubes, rods etc.) exhibit shape-dependent and size-dependent (both chemical and physical) properties (anisotropy). Non-spherical nanoparticles of gold (Au), silver (Ag), and platinum (Pt) due to their fascinating optical properties are finding diverse applications. Non-spherical geometries of nanoprisms give rise to high effective cross-sections and deeper colors of the colloidal solutions. The possibility of shifting the resonance wavelengths by tuning the particle geometry allows using them in the fields of molecular labeling, biomolecular assays, trace metal detection, or nanotechnical applications. Anisotropic nanoparticles display a specific absorption behavior and stochastic particle orientation under unpolarized light, showing a distinct resonance mode for each excitable axis. 

==Definitions==

===International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)===
In its 2012 proposed terminology for biologically related polymers, the IUPAC defined a nanoparticle as &quot;a particle of any shape with dimensions in the 1 × 10−9 and 1 × 10−7 m range&quot;. This definition evolved from one given by IUPAC in 1997.

In the same 2012 publication, the IUPAC extends the term to include tubes and fibers with only two dimensions below 100 nm.

===International Standards Organization (ISO)===
According to the International Standards Organization (ISO) technical specification 80004, a nanoparticle is an object with all three external dimensions in the nanoscale, whose longest and shortest axes do not differ significantly, with a significant difference typically being a factor of at least 3.

===Common usage===
&quot;Nanoscale&quot; is usually understood to be the range from 1 to 100 nm because the novel properties that differentiate particles from the bulk material typically develop at that range of sizes.

For some properties, like transparency or turbidity, ultrafiltration, stable dispersion, etc., substantial changes characteristic of nanoparticles are observed for particles as large as 500 nm. Therefore, the term is sometimes extended to that size range.

===Related concepts===
Nanoclusters are agglomerates of nanoparticles with at least one dimension between 1 and 10 nanometers and a narrow size distribution. Nanopowders are agglomerates of ultrafine particles, nanoparticles, or nanoclusters. Nanometer-sized single crystals, or single-domain ultrafine particles, are often referred to as nanocrystals.

The terms colloid and nanoparticle are not interchangeable. A colloid is a mixture which has particles of one phase dispersed or suspended within an other phase. The term applies only if the particles are larger than atomic dimensions but small enough to exhibit Brownian motion, with the critical size range (or particle diameter) typically ranging from nanometers (10−9 m) to micrometers (10−6 m). Colloids can contain particles too large to be nanoparticles, and nanoparticles can exist in non-colloidal form, for examples as a powder or in a solid matrix.

==History==

===Natural occurrence===
Nanoparticles are naturally produced by many cosmological, geological, meteorological, and biological processes. A significant fraction (by number, if not by mass) of interplanetary dust, that is still falling on the Earth at the rate of thousands of tons per year, is in the nanoparticle range; and the same is true of atmospheric dust particles. Many viruses have diameters in the nanoparticle range.

===Pre-industrial technology===
Nanoparticles were used by artisans since prehistory, albeit without knowledge of their nature. They were used by glassmakers and potters in Classical Antiquity, as exemplified by the Roman Lycurgus cup of dichroic glass (4th century CE) and the lusterware pottery of Mesopotamia (9th century CE). The latter is characterized by silver and copper nanoparticles dispersed in the glassy glaze.

===19th century===
Michael Faraday provided the first description, in scientific terms, of the optical properties of nanometer-scale metals in his classic 1857 paper. In a subsequent paper, the author (Turner) points out that: &quot;It is well known that when thin leaves of gold or silver are mounted upon glass and heated to a temperature that is well below a red heat (~500 °C), a remarkable change of properties takes place, whereby the continuity of the metallic film is destroyed. The result is that white light is now freely transmitted, reflection is correspondingly diminished, while the electrical resistivity is enormously increased.&quot;

===20th century===
During the 1970s and 80s, when the first thorough fundamental studies with nanoparticles were underway in the United States by Granqvist and Buhrman and Japan within an ERATO Project, researchers used the term ultrafine particles. However, during the 1990s, when the National Nanotechnology Initiative was launched in the United States, the term nanoparticle became more common, for example, see the same senior author&#x27;s paper 20 years later addressing the same issue, lognormal distribution of sizes.

Nanoparticles occur in a great variety of shapes, which have been given many names such as nanospheres, nanorods, nanochains, decahedral nanoparticles, nanostars, nanoflowers, nanoreefs, nanowhiskers, nanofibers, and nanoboxes.

The shapes of nanoparticles may be determined by the intrinsic crystal habit of the material, or by the influence of the environment around their creation, such as the inhibition of crystal growth on certain faces by coating additives, the shape of emulsion droplets and micelles in the precursor preparation, or the shape of pores in a surrounding solid matrix. Some applications of nanoparticles require specific shapes, as well as specific sizes or size ranges.

Amorphous particles typically adopt a spherical shape (due to their microstructural isotropy).

===Variations===
Semi-solid and soft nanoparticles have been produced. A prototype nanoparticle of semi-solid nature is the liposome. Various types of liposome nanoparticles are currently used clinically as delivery systems for anticancer drugs and vaccines.

The breakdown of biopolymers into their nanoscale building blocks is considered a potential route to produce nanoparticles with enhanced biocompatibility and biodegradability. The most common example is the production of nanocellulose from wood pulp. Other examples are nanolignin, nanochitin, or nanostarches.

Nanoparticles with one half hydrophilic and the other half hydrophobic are termed Janus particles and are particularly effective for stabilizing emulsions. They can self-assemble at water/oil interfaces and act as pickering stabilizers.

Hydrogel nanoparticles made of N-isopropylacrylamide hydrogel core shell can be dyed with affinity baits, internally. These affinity baits allow the nanoparticles to isolate and remove undesirable proteins while enhancing the target analytes.

==Nucleation and growth==
===Impact of nucleation===
Nucleation lays the foundation for the nanoparticle synthesis. Initial nuclei play a vital role on the size and shape of the nanoparticles that will ultimately form by acting as templating nuclei for the nanoparticle itself. Long-term stability is also determined by the initial nucleation procedures. Homogeneous nucleation occurs when nuclei form uniformly throughout the parent phase and is less common. Heterogeneous nucleation, however, forms on areas such as container surfaces, impurities, and other defects. Crystals can form simultaneously when nucleation occurs rapidly, resulting in a more uniform (monodisperse) product. In contrast, slow nucleation rates often lead to a diverse (polydisperse) population of crystals with varying sizes.[citation needed] This phenomenon is exemplified in the formation of CaCO3 crystals. Controlling nucleation allows for the control of size, dispersity, and phase of nanoparticles.

The process of nucleation and growth within nanoparticles can be described by nucleation, Ostwald ripening or the two-step mechanism-autocatalysis model.

===Nucleation===
The original theory from 1927 of nucleation in nanoparticle formation was Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT). It was believed that the changes in particle size could be described by burst nucleation alone. In 1950, Viktor LaMer used CNT as the nucleation basis for his model of nanoparticle growth. There are three portions to the LaMer model: 1. Rapid increase in the concentration of free monomers in solution, 2. fast nucleation of the monomer characterized by explosive growth of particles, 3. Growth of particles controlled by diffusion of the monomer. This model describes that the growth on the nucleus is spontaneous but limited by diffusion of the precursor to the nuclei surface. The LaMer model has not been able to explain the kinetics of nucleation in any modern system.

===Ostwald ripening===
Ostwald ripening is a process in which large particles grow at the expense of the smaller particles as a result of dissolution of small particles and deposition of the dissolved molecules on the surfaces of the larger particles. It occurs because smaller particles have a higher surface energy than larger particles. This process is typically undesirable in nanoparticle synthesis as it negatively impacts the functionality of nanoparticles.

===Two-step mechanism – autocatalysis model===
In 1997, Finke and Watzky proposed a new kinetic model for the nucleation and growth of nanoparticles. This 2-step model suggested that constant slow nucleation (occurring far from supersaturation) is followed by autocatalytic growth where dispersity of nanoparticles is largely determined. This F-W (Finke-Watzky) 2-step model provides a firmer mechanistic basis for the design of nanoparticles with a focus on size, shape, and dispersity control. The model was later expanded to a 3-step and two 4-step models between 2004 and 2008. Here, an additional step was included to account for small particle aggregation, where two smaller particles could aggregate to form a larger particle. Next, a fourth step (another autocatalytic step) was added to account for a small particle agglomerating with a larger particle. Finally in 2014, an alternative fourth step was considered that accounted for a atomistic surface growth on a large particle.

===Measuring the rate of nucleation===
As of 2014, the classical nucleation theory explained that the nucleation rate will correspond to the driving force. One method for measuring the nucleation rate is through the induction time method. This process uses the stochastic nature of nucleation and determines the rate of nucleation by analysis of the time between constant supersaturation and when crystals are first detected. Another method includes the probability distribution model, analogous to the methods used to study supercooled liquids, where the probability of finding at least one nucleus at a given time is derived.

As of 2019, the early stages of nucleation and the rates associated with nucleation were modelled through multiscale computational modeling. This included exploration into an improved kinetic rate equation model and density function studies using the phase-field crystal model.

==Properties==
The properties of a material in nanoparticle form are unusually different from those of the bulk one even when divided into micrometer-size particles. Many of them arise from spatial confinement of sub-atomic particles (i.e. electrons, protons, photons) and electric fields around these particles. The large surface to volume ratio is also significant factor at this scale.

===Controlling properties===
 The initial nucleation stages of the synthesis process heavily influence the properties of a nanoparticle. Nucleation, for example, is vital to the size of the nanoparticle. A critical radius must be met in the initial stages of solid formation, or the particles will redissolve into the liquid phase. The final shape of a nanoparticle is also controlled by nucleation. Possible final morphologies created by nucleation can include spherical, cubic, needle-like, worm-like, and more particles. Nucleation can be controlled predominately by time and temperature as well as the supersaturation of the liquid phase and the environment of the synthesis overall.

===Large surface-area-to-volume ratio===
Bulk materials (&gt;100 nm in size) are expected to have constant physical properties (such as thermal and electrical conductivity, stiffness, density, and viscosity) regardless of their size, for nanoparticles, however, this is different: the volume of the surface layer (a few atomic diameters-wide) becomes a significant fraction of the particle&#x27;s volume; whereas that fraction is insignificant for particles with a diameter of one micrometer or more. In other words, the surface area/volume ratio impacts certain properties of the nanoparticles more prominently than in bulk particles.

===Interfacial layer===

For nanoparticles dispersed in a medium of different composition, the interfacial layer — formed by ions and molecules from the medium that are within a few atomic diameters of the surface of each particle — can mask or change its chemical and physical properties. Indeed, that layer can be considered an integral part of each nanoparticle.

===Solvent affinity===
Suspensions of nanoparticles are possible since the interaction of the particle surface with the solvent is strong enough to overcome density differences, which otherwise usually result in a material either sinking or floating in a liquid.

===Coatings===

Nanoparticles often develop or receive coatings of other substances, distinct from both the particle&#x27;s material and of the surrounding medium. Even when only a single molecule thick, these coatings can radically change the particles&#x27; properties, such as and chemical reactivity, catalytic activity, and stability in suspension.

===Diffusion across the surface===
The high surface area of a material in nanoparticle form allows heat, molecules, and ions to diffuse into or out of the particles at very large rates. The small particle diameter, on the other hand, allows the whole material to reach homogeneous equilibrium with respect to diffusion in a very short time. Thus many processes that depend on diffusion, such as sintering can take place at lower temperatures and over shorter time scales which can be important in catalysis.

===Ferromagnetic and ferroelectric effects===
The small size of nanoparticles affects their magnetic and electric properties. The ferromagnetic materials in the micrometer range is a good example: widely used in magnetic recording media, for the stability of their magnetization state, those particles smaller than 10 nm are unstable and can change their state (flip) as the result of thermal energy at ordinary temperatures, thus making them unsuitable for that application.

===Mechanical properties===
The reduced vacancy concentration in nanocrystals can negatively affect the motion of dislocations, since dislocation climb requires vacancy migration. In addition, there exists a very high internal pressure due to the surface stress present in small nanoparticles with high radii of curvature. This causes a lattice strain that is inversely proportional to the size of the particle, also well known to impede dislocation motion, in the same way as it does in the work hardening of materials. For example, gold nanoparticles are significantly harder than the bulk material. Furthermore, the high surface-to-volume ratio in nanoparticles makes dislocations more likely to interact with the particle surface. In particular, this affects the nature of the dislocation source and allows the dislocations to escape the particle before they can multiply, reducing the dislocation density and thus the extent of plastic deformation.

There are unique challenges associated with the measurement of mechanical properties on the nanoscale, as conventional means such as the universal testing machine cannot be employed. As a result, new techniques such as nanoindentation have been developed that complement existing electron microscope and scanning probe methods. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be used to perform nanoindentation to measure hardness, elastic modulus, and adhesion between nanoparticle and substrate. The particle deformation can be measured by the deflection of the cantilever tip over the sample. The resulting force-displacement curves can be used to calculate elastic modulus. However, it is unclear whether particle size and indentation depth affect the measured elastic modulus of nanoparticles by AFM.

Adhesion and friction forces are important considerations in nanofabrication, lubrication, device design, colloidal stabilization, and drug delivery. The capillary force is the main contributor to the adhesive force under ambient conditions. The adhesion and friction force can be obtained from the cantilever deflection if the AFM tip is regarded as a nanoparticle. However, this method is limited by tip material and geometric shape. The colloidal probe technique overcomes these issues by attaching a nanoparticle to the AFM tip, allowing control oversize, shape, and material. While the colloidal probe technique is an effective method for measuring adhesion force, it remains difficult to attach a single nanoparticle smaller than 1 micron onto the AFM force sensor.

Another technique is &quot;in situ&quot; TEM, which provides real-time, high resolution imaging of nanostructure response to a stimulus. For example, an &quot;in situ&quot; force probe holder in TEM was used to compress twinned nanoparticles and characterize yield strength. In general, the measurement of the mechanical properties of nanoparticles is influenced by many factors including uniform dispersion of nanoparticles, precise application of load, minimum particle deformation, calibration, and calculation model.

Like bulk materials, the properties of nanoparticles are materials dependent. For spherical polymer nanoparticles, glass transition temperature and crystallinity may affect deformation and change the elastic modulus when compared to the bulk material. However, size-dependent behavior of elastic moduli could not be generalized across polymers. As for crystalline metal nanoparticles, dislocations were found to influence the mechanical properties of nanoparticles, contradicting the conventional view that dislocations are absent in crystalline nanoparticles.

===Melting point depression===
A material may have lower melting point in nanoparticle form than in the bulk form. For example, 2.5 nm gold nanoparticles melt at about 300 °C, whereas bulk gold melts at 1064 °C.

===Quantum mechanics effects===
Quantum mechanics effects become noticeable for nanoscale objects. They include quantum confinement in semiconductor particles, localized surface plasmons in some metal particles, and superparamagnetism in magnetic materials. Quantum dots are nanoparticles of semiconducting material that are small enough (typically sub 10 nm or less) to have quantized electronic energy levels.

Quantum effects are responsible for the deep-red to black color of gold or silicon nanopowders and nanoparticle suspensions. Absorption of solar radiation is much higher in materials composed of nanoparticles than in thin films of continuous sheets of material. In both solar PV and solar thermal applications, by controlling the size, shape, and material of the particles, it is possible to control solar absorption.

Core-shell nanoparticles can support simultaneously both electric and magnetic resonances, demonstrating entirely new properties when compared with bare metallic nanoparticles if the resonances are properly engineered. The formation of the core-shell structure from two different metals enables an energy exchange between the core and the shell, typically found in upconverting nanoparticles and downconverting nanoparticles, and causes a shift in the emission wavelength spectrum.

By introducing a dielectric layer, plasmonic core (metal)-shell (dielectric) nanoparticles enhance light absorption by increasing scattering. Recently, the metal core-dielectric shell nanoparticle has demonstrated a zero backward scattering with enhanced forward scattering on a silicon substrate when surface plasmon is located in front of a solar cell.

===Regular packing===
Nanoparticles of sufficiently uniform size may spontaneously settle into regular arrangements, forming a colloidal crystal. These arrangements may exhibit original physical properties, such as observed in photonic crystals.

==Production==
Artificial nanoparticles can be created from any solid or liquid material, including metals, dielectrics, and semiconductors. They may be internally homogeneous or heterogenous, e.g. with a core–shell structure.

There are several methods for creating nanoparticles, including gas condensation, attrition, chemical precipitation, ion implantation, pyrolysis, hydrothermal synthesis, and biosynthesis.

===Mechanical===
Friable macro- or micro-scale solid particles can be ground in a ball mill, a planetary ball mill, or other size-reducing mechanism until enough of them are in the nanoscale size range. The resulting powder can be air classified to extract the nanoparticles.

===Breakdown of biopolymers===
Biopolymers like cellulose, lignin, chitin, or starch may be broken down into their individual nanoscale building blocks, obtaining anisotropic fiber- or needle-like nanoparticles. The biopolymers are disintegrated mechanically in combination with chemical oxidation or enzymatic treatment to promote breakup, or hydrolysed using acid.

===Pyrolysis===
Another method to create nanoparticles is to turn a suitable precursor substance, such as a gas (e.g. methane) or aerosol, into solid particles by combustion or pyrolysis. This is a generalization of the burning of hydrocarbons or other organic vapors to generate soot. Traditional pyrolysis often results in aggregates and agglomerates rather than single primary particles. This inconvenience can be avoided by ultrasonic nozzle spray pyrolysis, in which the precursor liquid is forced through an orifice at high pressure.

===Condensation from plasma===
Nanoparticles of pure metals, oxides, carbides, and nitrides, can be created by vaporizing a solid precursor with a thermal plasma and then condensing the vapor by expansion or quenching in a suitable gas or liquid. The plasma can be produced by dc jet, electric arc, or radio frequency (RF) induction. The thermal plasma can reach temperatures of 10.000 K and can thus also synthesize nanopowders with very high boiling points. Metal wires can be vaporized by the exploding wire method.

In RF induction plasma torches, energy coupling to the plasma is accomplished through the electromagnetic field generated by the induction coil. The plasma gas does not come in contact with electrodes, thus eliminating possible sources of contamination and allowing the operation of such plasma torches with a wide range of gases including inert, reducing, oxidizing, and other corrosive atmospheres. The working frequency is typically between 200 kHz and 40 MHz. Laboratory units run at power levels in the order of 30–50 kW, whereas the large-scale industrial units have been tested at power levels up to 1 MW. As the residence time of the injected feed droplets in the plasma is very short, it is important that the droplet sizes are small enough in order to obtain complete evaporation.

===Inert gas condensation===
Inert-gas condensation is frequently used to produce metallic nanoparticles. The metal is evaporated in a vacuum chamber containing a reduced atmosphere of an inert gas. Condensation of the supersaturated metal vapor results in creation of nanometer-size particles, which can be entrained in the inert gas stream and deposited on a substrate or studied in situ. Early studies were based on thermal evaporation. Using magnetron sputtering to create the metal vapor allows to achieve higher yields. The method can easily be generalized to alloy nanoparticles by choosing appropriate metallic targets. The use of sequential growth schemes, where the particles travel through a second metallic vapor, results in growth of core-shell (CS) structures.

===Radiolysis method===

Nanoparticles can also be formed using radiation chemistry. Radiolysis from gamma rays can create strongly active free radicals in solution. This relatively simple technique uses a minimum number of chemicals. These including water, a soluble metallic salt, a radical scavenger (often a secondary alcohol), and a surfactant (organic capping agent). High gamma doses on the order of 104 gray are required. In this process, reducing radicals will drop metallic ions down to the zero-valence state. A scavenger chemical will preferentially interact with oxidizing radicals to prevent the re-oxidation of the metal. Once in the zero-valence state, metal atoms begin to coalesce into particles. A chemical surfactant surrounds the particle during formation and regulates its growth. In sufficient concentrations, the surfactant molecules stay attached to the particle. This prevents it from dissociating or forming clusters with other particles. Formation of nanoparticles using the radiolysis method allows for tailoring of particle size and shape by adjusting precursor concentrations and gamma dose.

===Wet chemistry===
Nanoparticles of certain materials can be created by &quot;wet&quot; chemical processes, in which solutions of suitable compounds are mixed or otherwise treated to form an insoluble precipitate of the desired material. The size of the particles of the latter is adjusted by choosing the concentration of the reagents and the temperature of the solutions, and through the addition of suitable inert agents that affect the viscosity and diffusion rate of the liquid. With different parameters, the same general process may yield other nanoscale structures of the same material, such as aerogels and other porous networks. 

The nanoparticles formed by this method are then separated from the solvent and soluble byproducts of the reaction by a combination of evaporation, sedimentation, centrifugation, washing, and filtration. Alternatively, if the particles are meant to be deposited on the surface of some solid substrate, the starting solutions can be by coated on that surface by dipping or spin-coating, and the reaction can be carried out in place.

Electroless deposition provides a unique opportunity for growing nanoparticles onto surface without the need for costly spin coating, electrodeposition, or physical vapor deposition. Electroless deposition processes can form colloid suspensions catalytic metal or metal oxide deposition. The suspension of nanoparticles that result from this process is an example of colloid. Typical instances of this method are the production of metal oxide or hydroxide nanoparticles by hydrolysis of metal alkoxides and chlorides.

Besides being cheap and convenient, the wet chemical approach allows fine control of the particle&#x27;s chemical composition. Even small quantities of dopants, such as organic dyes and rare earth metals, can be introduced in the reagent solutions end up uniformly dispersed in the final product.

===Ion implantation===
Ion implantation may be used to treat the surfaces of dielectric materials such as sapphire and silica to make composites with near-surface dispersions of metal or oxide nanoparticles.

===Functionalization===
Many properties of nanoparticles, notably stability, solubility, and chemical or biological activity, can be radically altered by coating them with various substances — a process called functionalization. Functionalized nanomaterial-based catalysts can be used for catalysis of many known organic reactions.

For example, suspensions of graphene particles can be stabilized by functionalization with gallic acid groups.

For biological applications, the surface coating should be polar to give high aqueous solubility and prevent nanoparticle aggregation. In serum or on the cell surface, highly charged coatings promote non-specific binding, whereas polyethylene glycol linked to terminal hydroxyl or methoxy groups repel non-specific interactions. By the immobilization of thiol groups on the surface of nanoparticles or by coating them with thiomers high (muco)adhesive and cellular uptake enhancing properties can be introduced.

Nanoparticles can be linked to biological molecules that can act as address tags, directing them to specific sites within the body specific organelles within the cell, or causing them to follow specifically the movement of individual protein or RNA molecules in living cells. Common address tags are monoclonal antibodies, aptamers, streptavidin, or peptides. These targeting agents should ideally be covalently linked to the nanoparticle and should be present in a controlled number per nanoparticle. Multivalent nanoparticles, bearing multiple targeting groups, can cluster receptors, which can activate cellular signaling pathways, and give stronger anchoring. Monovalent nanoparticles, bearing a single binding site, avoid clustering and so are preferable for tracking the behavior of individual proteins.

It has been shown that catalytic activity and sintering rates of a functionalized nanoparticle catalyst is correlated to nanoparticles&#x27; number density

Coatings that mimic those of red blood cells can help nanoparticles evade the immune system.

===Uniformity requirements===
The chemical processing and synthesis of high-performance technological components for the private, industrial, and military sectors requires the use of high-purity ceramics (oxide ceramics, such as aluminium oxide or copper(II) oxide), polymers, glass-ceramics, and composite materials, as metal carbides (SiC), nitrides (Aluminum nitrides, Silicon nitride), metals (Al, Cu), non-metals (graphite, carbon nanotubes), and layered (Al + aluminium carbonate, Cu + C). In condensed bodies formed from fine powders, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing density variations in the powder compact.

Uncontrolled agglomeration of powders due to attractive van der Waals forces can also give rise to microstructural heterogeneity. Differential stresses that develop as a result of non-uniform drying shrinkage are directly related to the rate at which the solvent can be removed, and thus highly dependent upon the distribution of porosity. Such stresses have been associated with a plastic-to-brittle transition in consolidated bodies, and can yield to crack propagation in the unfired body if not relieved.

In addition, any fluctuations in packing density in the compact as it is prepared for the kiln are often amplified during the sintering process, yielding inhomogeneous densification. Some pores and other structural defects associated with density variations have been shown to play a detrimental role in the sintering process by growing and thus limiting end-point densities. Differential stresses arising from inhomogeneous densification have also been shown to result in the propagation of internal cracks, thus becoming the strength-controlling flaws.

Inert gas evaporation and inert gas deposition are free many of these defects due to the distillation (cf. purification) nature of the process and having enough time to form single crystal particles, however even their non-aggreated deposits have lognormal size distribution, which is typical with nanoparticles. The reason why modern gas evaporation techniques can produce a relatively narrow size distribution is that aggregation can be avoided. However, even in this case, random residence times in the growth zone, due to the combination of drift and diffusion, result in a size distribution appearing lognormal.

It would, therefore, appear desirable to process a material in such a way that it is physically uniform with regard to the distribution of components and porosity, rather than using particle size distributions that will maximize the green density. The containment of a uniformly dispersed assembly of strongly interacting particles in suspension requires total control over interparticle forces. Monodisperse nanoparticles and colloids provide this potential.

==Characterization==

Nanoparticles have different analytical requirements than conventional chemicals, for which chemical composition and concentration are sufficient metrics. Nanoparticles have other physical properties that must be measured for a complete description, such as size, shape, surface properties, crystallinity, and dispersion state. Additionally, sampling and laboratory procedures can perturb their dispersion state or bias the distribution of other properties. In environmental contexts, an additional challenge is that many methods cannot detect low concentrations of nanoparticles that may still have an adverse effect. For some applications, nanoparticles may be characterized in complex matrices such as water, soil, food, polymers, inks, complex mixtures of organic liquids such as in cosmetics, or blood.

There are several overall categories of methods used to characterize nanoparticles. Microscopy methods generate images of individual nanoparticles to characterize their shape, size, and location. Electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy are the dominant methods. Because nanoparticles have a size below the diffraction limit of visible light, conventional optical microscopy is not useful. Electron microscopes can be coupled to spectroscopic methods that can perform elemental analysis. Microscopy methods are destructive and can be prone to undesirable artifacts from sample preparation, or from probe tip geometry in the case of scanning probe microscopy. Additionally, microscopy is based on single-particle measurements, meaning that large numbers of individual particles must be characterized to estimate their bulk properties.

Spectroscopy, which measures the particles&#x27; interaction with electromagnetic radiation as a function of wavelength, is useful for some classes of nanoparticles to characterize concentration, size, and shape. X-ray, ultraviolet–visible, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used with nanoparticles. Light-scattering methods using laser light, X-rays, or neutron scattering are used to determine particle size, with each method suitable for different size ranges and particle compositions. Some miscellaneous methods are electrophoresis for surface charge, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method for surface area, and X-ray diffraction for crystal structure, as well as mass spectrometry for particle mass, and particle counters for particle number. Chromatography, centrifugation, and filtration techniques can be used to separate nanoparticles by size or other physical properties before or during characterization.

==Health and safety==
Nanoparticles present possible dangers, both medically and environmentally. Most of these are due to the high surface to volume ratio, which can make the particles very reactive or catalytic. They are also thought to aggregate on phospholipid bilayers and pass through cell membranes in organisms, and their interactions with biological systems are relatively unknown. However, it is unlikely the particles would enter the cell nucleus, Golgi complex, endoplasmic reticulum or other internal cellular components due to the particle size and intercellular agglomeration. A recent study looking at the effects of ZnO nanoparticles on human immune cells has found varying levels of susceptibility to cytotoxicity. There are concerns that pharmaceutical companies, seeking regulatory approval for nano-reformulations of existing medicines, are relying on safety data produced during clinical studies of the earlier, pre-reformulation version of the medicine. This could result in regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, missing new side effects that are specific to the nano-reformulation. However considerable research has demonstrated that zinc nanoparticles are not absorbed into the bloodstream in vivo.

Concern has also been raised over the health effects of respirable nanoparticles from certain combustion processes. Preclinical investigations have demonstrated that some inhaled or injected noble metal nano-architectures avoid persistence in organisms. As of 2013 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was investigating the safety of the following nanoparticles:
*Carbon nanotubes: Carbon materials have a wide range of uses, ranging from composites for use in vehicles and sports equipment to integrated circuits for electronic components. The interactions between nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and natural organic matter strongly influence both their aggregation and deposition, which strongly affects their transport, transformation, and exposure in aquatic environments. In past research, carbon nanotubes exhibited some toxicological impacts that will be evaluated in various environmental settings in current EPA chemical safety research. EPA research will provide data, models, test methods, and best practices to discover the acute health effects of carbon nanotubes and identify methods to predict them.
*Cerium oxide: Nanoscale cerium oxide is used in electronics, biomedical supplies, energy, and fuel additives. Many applications of engineered cerium oxide nanoparticles naturally disperse themselves into the environment, which increases the risk of exposure. There is ongoing exposure to new diesel emissions using fuel additives containing CeO2 nanoparticles, and the environmental and public health impacts of this new technology are unknown. EPA&#x27;s chemical safety research is assessing the environmental, ecological, and health implications of nanotechnology-enabled diesel fuel additives.
*Titanium dioxide: Nano titanium dioxide is currently used in many products. Depending on the type of particle, it may be found in sunscreens, cosmetics, and paints and coatings. It is also being investigated for use in removing contaminants from drinking water.
*Nano Silver: Nano Silver is being incorporated into textiles, clothing, food packaging, and other materials to eliminate bacteria. EPA and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission are studying certain products to see whether they transfer nano-size silver particles in real-world scenarios. EPA is researching this topic to better understand how much nano-silver children come in contact with in their environments.
*Iron: While nano-scale iron is being investigated for many uses, including &quot;smart fluids&quot; for uses such as optics polishing and as a better-absorbed iron nutrient supplement, one of its more prominent current uses is to remove contamination from groundwater. This use, supported by EPA research, is being piloted at a number of sites across the United States.

==Regulation==
As of 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had conditionally registered, for a period of four years, only two nanomaterial pesticides as ingredients. The EPA differentiates nanoscale ingredients from non-nanoscale forms of the ingredient, but there is little scientific data about potential variation in toxicity. Testing protocols still need to be developed.

==Applications==
As the most prevalent morphology of nanomaterials used in consumer products, nanoparticles have an enormous range of potential and actual applications. Table below summarizes the most common nanoparticles used in various product types available on the global markets.

Scientific research on nanoparticles is intense as they have many potential applications in pre-clinical and clinical medicine, physics, optics, and electronics. The U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative offers government funding focused on nanoparticle research. The use of nanoparticles in laser dye-doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) laser gain media was demonstrated in 2003 and it has been shown to improve conversion efficiencies and to decrease laser beam divergence. Researchers attribute the reduction in beam divergence to improved dn/dT characteristics of the organic-inorganic dye-doped nanocomposite. The optimum composition reported by these researchers is 30% w/w of SiO2 (~ 12 nm) in dye-doped PMMA. Nanoparticles are being investigated as self-cleaning paint and potential drug delivery system. Drugs, growth factors or other biomolecules can be conjugated to nano particles to aid targeted delivery. This nanoparticle-assisted delivery allows for spatial and temporal controls of the loaded drugs to achieve the most desirable biological outcome. Nanoparticles are also studied for possible applications as dietary supplements for delivery of biologically active substances, for example mineral elements.

===Polymer reinforcement===
Clay nanoparticles, when incorporated into polymer matrices, increase reinforcement, leading to stronger plastics, verifiable by a higher glass transition temperature and other mechanical property tests. These nanoparticles are hard, and impart their properties to the polymer (plastic). Nanoparticles have also been attached to textile fibers in order to create smart and functional clothing.

===Liquid properties tuner===
The inclusion of nanoparticles in a solid or liquid medium can substantially change its mechanical properties, such as elasticity, plasticity, viscosity, compressibility.

===Photocatalysis===
Being smaller than the wavelengths of visible light, nanoparticles can be dispersed in transparent media without affecting its transparency at those wavelengths. This property is exploited in many applications, such as photocatalysis.

===Road paving===
Asphalt modification through nanoparticles can be considered as an interesting low-cost technique in asphalt pavement engineering providing novel perspectives in making asphalt materials more durable.

===Biomedical===
Nanoscale particles are used in biomedical applications as drug carriers or imaging contrast agents in microscopy. Anisotropic nanoparticles are a good candidate in biomolecular detection. Moreover, nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery offer an unprecedented opportunity to overcome some drawbacks related to the delivery, owing to their tunability with diverse physico-chemical properties, they can readily be functionalized with any type of biomolecules/moieties for selective targeting.

===Sunscreens===
Titanium dioxide nanoparticles what is known as the self-cleaning effect, which lend useful water-repellant and antibacterial properties to paints and other products. Zinc oxide nanoparticles have been found to have superior UV blocking properties and are widely used in the preparation of sunscreen lotions, being completely photostable though toxic.

<text>The name candelabra primula or candelabra primrose refers to species and cultivars of &quot;Primula&quot; section &quot;Proliferae&quot; (formerly &quot;Candelabra&quot;), originating mainly in the far east. They are characterised by whorls of flowers formed in circles at intervals around strong vertical stems, in many brilliant colours, flowering over a long period from Spring to Summer. They are popular ornamental subjects for moist, heavy, neutral or acidic soil. They associate well with other plants, such as rhododendrons, which enjoy similar conditions.

<text>Giorgio Basta, Count of Huszt, Gjergj Basta or Gheorghe Basta (1550 – 1607) was an Italian general, diplomat, and writer of Arbëreshë Albanian origin, employed by the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to command Habsburg forces in the Long War of 1593–1606. He was later sent to administer Transylvania as an Imperial vassal and to restore Catholicism as the dominant religion in the region.

On his orders, his ally Michael the Brave, who ruled Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia, was assassinated on 9 August 1601, a few days after the common victory at the Battle of Guruslău, for trying to turn against Rudolf II. For this, he is often depicted as disloyal and violent by Romanian and Hungarian historians. Basta was also the author of books on the art of military leadership.

== Biography ==
Basta was born to an Arbëreshë Albanian family. He is claimed to be born in La Rocca, modern day Roccaforzata, a village in Salento, Italy, however historical sources claim he was born in Ulpiano nel Monferrato.
He was the son of Demetrius Basta, an Albanian Epirote who had fled the Ottoman conquest of the region to Italy, where he served the Spanish Empire. His father fought in the Piedmont countryside in the middle 1500s, and then in Flanders as commander of a cavalry regiment under the Duke of Alba. Very young, Basta became a soldier, and eventually got promoted to the rank of officer in a detachment commanded by Demetrio. Then after his father died, Basta served in a cavalry company run by his oldest brother Niccolò.
In 1589, he married Anne de Liedekerke de Gavre, with whom he had 5 children: Charles, Georges, Demetrius, Ferdinand and Madeleine.

He began his military career in Flanders, where the young officer impressed Don John of Austria, and gained the governorship of Nivelles. In 1577 he joined the forces of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma in Flanders. He led his army mainly on the French front during the War of the Three Henrys and the Catholic League. In 1584, Basta gained his first major victory when his troops were blocking communications between Malines and Antwerp. Similarly during the siege of Brussels which ended with a capitulation of the besiegers in March 1585, Basta led the blockade of the city. During the end of the year, the commander led the cavalry of the expeditionary body which at Charles de Mansfeld&#x27;s orders... When the Catholics, in 1589, marched to retake Paris, it was the cavalry led by Basta who rescued the back of the Spanish army from the sudden attack of Henry of Navarre.

He returned to France in 1591, and partook in the siege of Rouen with the rank of Commander General of the cavalry. He however was almost killed by Sir Roger Williams, who sliced his neck in personal combat. In February 1592 he separated Navarre from his greater army and the prince fled capture by his forces. He was tasked with ensuring communications between Rouen and the Netherlands, which was massively threatened by the French army, and then protecting the retreat of the Spaniards after the injury of Alexander Farnese in Caudebec. 

In 1596, after the death of the Duke of Parma, Basta followed the fate of many Italian princes, and had to abandon the Spanish. He then went to the service of Emperor Rudolf II, on the recommendation of Philip II. Rudolph II named Basta general of his light cavalry and made him knight of the Order of the Golden Spur on February 16, 1598. He served as general master in the army of Archbishop Mattia, later deputy governor of Upper Hungary, and finally the commander of the armies of Hungary and Transylvania. Ambrogio Merodio in his &quot;Istoria Tarantina&quot;, calls him the &quot;terror of Ottoman armies&quot;.

For more than a decade, Basta fought against Hungarians, Transylvanians, Vlachs, and Tatars, gaining much fame as one as the best generals of the Empire. In 1597 he was released, together with General Schwarzenberg, from Pápa, which was conquered three years earlier by the Turks. In 1597, while he was deputy governor of Hungary, he recaptured the city of Huszt, which had rebelled against the Empire.

At the Battle of Mirăslău, Michael the Brave was defeated by Basta, forcing Michael to appeal to the Emperor Rudolf II to mediate the dispute with Basta.

Under his command, his ally Michael the Brave, the former ruler of Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldavia, was assassinated at Keresztesmező camp, near Aranyosgyéres (now Câmpia Turzii, Câmpia Turzii), because Basta considered him a liability. The event happened on 9 August 1601, only days after a joint victory in Battle of Guruslău. 
Following the murder of Michael and his victory over Báthory, Basta became military commander of Transylvania, but his cruelty led to public discontent. Under his leadership, iniquities and murders multiplied throughout Transylvania. During this brief period, Basta tried to uproot Protestantism. Following Papal and Imperial policy, Calvinist Hungarians and Székelys, Orthodox Wallachians and Serbs, and Lutheran Saxons were subject to any kind of abuse. Following years of warfare and his ruthless regime, famine and plague appeared in Transylvania. 
At that time Rudolf II decided to recall him from command, leading to Basta&#x27;s departure from Transylvania and put him in charge to fight against the Ottomans of West Hungary(1604). He successfully defended Esztergom with his 10,000 mercenaries against 80,000 Ottomans.

After Bocskai&#x27;s uprisen army chased away Belgiojoso, Rudolph sent Basta from West-Hungary to the Partium to suppress the uprising. In November 1604 Basta twice defeated forces led by Stephen Bocskai (see also: Bocskai Uprising). Bocskai at the end cut his supplies and he had to withdraw in winter to Eperjes where he got trapped. After some months Rudolph called him back to defend at first the mine towns (e.g. Besztercebánya) in Upper-Hungary, Moravia and Austria against Bocskai&#x27;s looting armies.

In July 1605 he did not get enough money to keep up enough mercenaries to defend Visegrád, Esztergom and Érsekújvár against the Ottomans and was defeated by Lalla Mehmed. The Military Committee didn&#x27;t supply him enough money but Rudolph II made him a Czech baron to compensate. The court became tired of the war and they started pushing aside Basta after the Treaty of Vienna and Treaty of Zsitvatorok, and even didn&#x27;t want to pay him their debt. He claimed 380,000 Thaler debt from the court (80 000 wages of mercenaries came from his own pocket). His last 4 years he did not get his payment and was not even invited to the Military Committee.

After his experiences of warfare in Eastern Europe he went to Prague. On April 17, 1606, Pope Paul V pronounced an interdict against the Republic of Venice. On February 26, 1607, Basta was named lieutenant general of the Holy Church. The Venetian interdict having been canceled on April 21, 1607, Basta will never take command effectively.

Basta died in Prague on November 20, 1607.

Basta wrote several military manuals, the best known of which are his &quot;Il maestro di campo generale...&quot;(Venice 1606), and his posthumous work &quot;Il governo della cavalleria leggiera&quot; (Venice 1612). Both were translated into German and into French.

== Contributions and military Style ==
Basta was born into a period of transition from the tradition sword and shield to the gun. And cavalry switched from the Gendarme to lighter and armed cavalrymen, which valued quick cavalry charges. Due to influence from his father, he was a very strict observer of the rules, and the laws of a militia. When he worked for Alexander, Duke of Parma he was responsible for the renewal and restructuring of the cavalry weapon. However, during his early years, Basta experimented with his personal method of &quot;mobile sculptures&quot;, which were small and numerous groups of cavalrymen who pushed in the forefront of the army, so as to create a complete &quot;crown&quot; in continuous movement; The method assured the army of sudden destructive capability and gave fruit in the French countryside.

&quot;The government of light cavalry&quot; is doubtless the most important work of Basta, as it represents the first organic regulation of light cavalry in Europe. Basta&#x27;s theories led to the cavalry being released from its close ties with infantry, according to previous military tactics. To a degree, Basta&#x27;s work is also largely anticipatory of further developments, especially in the concept of light cavalry being &quot;the pupil of the armies&quot; and in the reiterated need for a constant coordination of cavalry movements with those of other weapons : Theories, which influenced Raimondo Montecuccoli. Interesting remarks are made by Basta regarding the choice of cavalry officers to be performed not according to the nobility titles, but on a more meritocratic internship through the various degrees of the militia. He wants the captain to have absolute authority over all officers, &quot;but always with the advice of the commissioner&quot;; For the lieutenant requires a mature age, which can guarantee &quot;credit and authority on the soldiers&quot;; Young people must be standard bearers, for the pursuit and adventurous spirit. Those carrying the banner must &quot;have in their heads the guidance of all the others.&quot; Particular care is given by Basta to the question of the armament of soldiers. The Blunderbuss should be equipped with an arbutus to carry with shoulder strap and a short sword, which allows to hit the tip, more timely and more effectively, according to the dictation of the Italian school, rather than cutting. Among the Blunderbuss, who must be young and robust in shape, Basta values particularly Flemish to be best, not Italians, who prefer military in infantry.

The main quality of the lancers&#x27; wards must be, according to Basta, &quot;velocity and collision velocity, i.e. velocity joint mass&quot;; The gun armor is, besides the spear, a short sword for tip and picks that &quot;can greatly benefit in retreat.&quot; On the &quot;rules of residence&quot;, Basta illustrates the rules already dictated by Alessandro Farnese: the commissioner. It has to carry out topographic surveys and deal with all the logistical problems with the help of a &quot;forier major&quot;, also providing the surveillance system for the equinox. Another important chapter is the one devoted to remote viewing, which Basta underlines as one of the main tasks of the cavalry. In this part, he sets out with great precision the various procedures to be followed to surprise a large army of enemies. Especially of personal experiences in the Netherlands and France, although he attributes the merit of introducing this use of cavalry to the Duke of Alba. Finally, Basta deals with the tactical organization of light cavalry in combat, recommending the crescent moon, rather than the manipulative ones, in lines, in chessboard, in columns.

<text>Kilkenny City Association Football Club was an Irish football club. The club played in the First Division of the League of Ireland until 18 January 2008 when they announced that they resigned their position in the league citing &quot;lack of finance, poor results and paltry attendances&quot;.

The club hails from Kilkenny and used Buckley Park as their home pitch. Buckley Park has hosted many International under age soccer games. Kilkenny City will be entering the under 20 division this season which run co-currently with the schoolboy season (August to May).

==History==
In 1966 a group of Leaving Certificate students made the most of having a free class at the local Christian Brothers school. They debated the pros and cons, devised a plan and, finally, resolved to start a football club. The club was originally known as EMFA, becoming Kilkenny City in 1989. Jim Rhatigan was appointed as the club&#x27;s secretary a position he still holds and since then he has become closely associated with football in Kilkenny. &quot;EM&quot; stood for Emmett Street and &quot;FA&quot; for Fatima Place where Jim Rhatigan grew up.

Initially EMFA competed in the U18 Kilkenny and District Youth League under the management of Donie Butler. Donie Butler served as Commercial Manager of the FAI during the Jack Charlton years. The club was unable to afford a new set of jerseys and so agreed to play in an all white strip. The logic being that all the players had at least one white T-shirt or shirt they could wear. The club&#x27;s colours changed to claret and blue before changing again to black and amber, coinciding with the renaming of the club.

EMFA graduated from junior football in 1971–72 season. Jim Rhatigan became their manager and the club remained in junior football until 1984. During this period the club purchased of land from a local farmer by the name of Mick Murphy, owner of the adjacent Tennypark House, for £16,000 punts. They had previously played their home games at the Freshford Road grounds, St. James Park. The ground was originally called Tennypark and was later named Buckley Park in honour of Marty Buckley. A bid of One million was made for the club&#x27;s grounds in the late eighties but was rejected in the favour of football.

In 1984 the club won the Junior league and cup remaining undefeated throughout the entire season. It was decided that he club should apply for admission to the then League of Ireland (now the Airtricity League). In their maiden season Kilkenny City then known as EMFA, (from 1985 to 1989) finished tenth in the First Division. Their first League of Ireland game was played on 8 October 1985 at home to Derry City and ended in a 1–1 draw.

EMFA won their first honour in 1987, winning the League of Ireland First Division Shield defeating Finn Harps 4–2 in Oriel Park. The club changed its name to Kilkenny City in 1989. Under Joe McGrath they reached the FAI Cup semi-final in 1991, before suffering defeat to Shamrock Rovers.

In the 1996–97 season Kilkenny City won the First Division title with 11 points to spare over their nearest rivals Drogheda United thus gaining promotion to the Premier Division. Their stay in the premier was short however as they finished in eleventh the following season and were relegated back to the First Division.

In the 1999–2000 season Kilkenny city finished third and beat Waterford United in a promotion-relegation playoff returning to the Premier. However, Kilkenny city were unable to extend their stay in the top flight beyond a single season managing only a single league victory throughout the whole season. General manager Jim Rhatigan wrote &quot;Mud, Sweat and Jeers&quot; a semi autobiographical account of the founding of the club.

The club celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2006. The anniversary was celebrated with a memorial mass at Father Fiachra&#x27;s Church presided over by Father Willie Purcell and complete with a gospel choir. Dave Bassett, former Wimbledon manager was guest of honour with former Northern Ireland international, Gerry Taggart also attending the club&#x27;s anniversary banquet at the Lyrath Estate Hotel.

2005 was notable for Kilkenny City by the arrival of Pat Scully. It was a season of two halves for the Black Cats. Their record before June read – played 15, won 1, drew 4 and lost 10. They sat on the bottom of the table with just 7 points out of a possible 45. The squad was bolstered in key areas with a handful of summer transfers including David Cassidy from Derby County. The new signings turned things around and immediately went on a run of six victories in a row culminating with the 5–0 destruction of Dundalk at Dundalk&#x27;s home patch. Their record post-June finally read – played 21, won 14, drew 4 and lost only 3. Scully and his signings had quite miraculously taken Kilkenny from bottom of the table about halfway through the season to fourth by the end of the season.

Scully&#x27;s success attracted the attention of Shamrock Rovers. The lure of the big club was too much to turn down and Kilkenny had lost their manager by the beginning of the next season. Scully took the cream of the talent with him including David Cassidy, Tadhg Purcell and Aidan Price to Rovers leaving Kilkenny&#x27;s squad looking very bare.

Scully&#x27;s successor Adrian Fitzpatrick was sacked in October 2006. Gary Coad took over as caretaker manager until the end of the 2006 season.

The club appointed Brendan Rea as their new manager in preparation for the 2007 season until July when he resigned. Tommy Gaynor then took over as manager. Subsequently, Tommy Gaynor parted company with the club leaving Under 21 Manager Noel Byrne as the last ever caretaker/ manager. On 10 November 2007 Kilkenny City played their last League of Ireland game losing 3–1 at home to Finn Harps.

In January 2008 Kilkenny City resigned from the League of Ireland .

In 2011 the &quot;Bring Back Kilkenny City AFC Foundation&quot; was formed. Launched by a group of die hard Kilkenny City fans, they faced immediate competition from Carlow&#x27;s proposed move to Buckley Park for the 2012 season. There is also a campaign to save Buckley Park as a sporting venue

<doc id="1234535" wikidata="Q674999" url="?curid=1234535" title="The Skin of Our Teeth">
<text>The Skin of Our Teeth is a play by Thornton Wilder that won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It opened on October 15, 1942, at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, before moving to the Plymouth Theatre on Broadway on November 18, 1942. It was produced by Michael Myerberg and directed by Elia Kazan with costumes by Mary Percy Schenck. The play is a three-part allegory about the life of mankind, centering on the Antrobus family of the fictional town of Excelsior, New Jersey. The epic comedy-drama is noted as among the most heterodox of classic American comedies, as it breaks nearly every established convention of theatrical performances that was in effect when Wilder wrote it.

The phrase used as the title comes from the King James Bible, Job 19:20: &quot;My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.&quot;

==Overview==
The main characters of the play are George and Maggie Antrobus (from (anthropos), &quot;human&quot; or &quot;person&quot;), their two children, Henry and Gladys, and Sabina, who appears as the family&#x27;s maid in the first and third acts, and as a beauty queen temptress in the second act. The play&#x27;s action takes place in a modern setting, but is full of anachronisms reaching back to prehistoric times. The characters&#x27; roles as archetypes are emphasized by their identification with Biblical and classical personalities:

The name Lilly Sabina is a reference to the myth of Lilith and to the historical rape of the Sabine women, identifications made relatively explicit in the play&#x27;s text. Henry Antrobus&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Cain&quot;, following his murder of his brother Abel, mirroring the biblical story in which Adam&#x27;s son murders his brother after God favors Abel over Cain by gifts. This implies that George Antrobus is Adam and Maggie Antrobus Eve, supported when George composes a song for his wife Maggie in honor of their anniversary: &quot;Happy w&#x27;dding ann&#x27;vers&#x27;ry dear Eva.&quot;

The murder of Abel is an underlying theme in the play. Mr. Antrobus pays far more attention to his &quot;perfect&quot; third child Gladys than he does Henry. As this treatment of Henry continues, Henry&#x27;s anger progresses throughout the play, reaching its climax in the third act.

While the Antrobus family remains constant throughout the play, the three acts do not form a continuous narrative. The first act takes place during an impending ice age; in the second act the family circumstances have changed as George becomes president of the Fraternal Order of Mammals (apparent references to Sodom and Gomorrah but also to the Roaring Twenties), while the end of the world approaches a second time; the third act opens with Maggie and Gladys emerging from a bunker at the end of a seven-year-long war.

An additional layer of stylistic complexity is added by the occasional interruption of the recitative narrative scene by actors directly addressing the audience: In the first scene, the actress playing Sabina reveals her misgivings to the audience about the play; in the second act she refuses to recite her lines and instead talks to the spectators, causing a woman in the audience to run from the theater sobbing; and in the third act, the actor playing Mr. Antrobus interrupts to announce that several actors have taken ill, asking the audience to indulge them while the &quot;stage manager&quot; of the play conducts a rehearsal with the replacements.

==Plot==

===Act I===
Act one is an amalgam of early 20th century New Jersey and the dawn of the Ice Age. The father is inventing things such as the lever, the wheel, the alphabet, and multiplication tables. The family and the entire northeastern U.S. face extinction by a wall of ice moving southward from Canada. The story is introduced by a narrator and further expanded by the family maid, Sabina. There are unsettling parallels between the members of the Antrobus family and various characters from the Bible. In addition, time is compressed and scrambled to such an extent that the refugees who arrive at the Antrobus house seeking food and fire include the Old Testament prophet Moses, the ancient Greek poet Homer, and women who are identified as Muses.

===Act II===
Act II takes place on the Boardwalk at Atlantic City, New Jersey, where the Antrobuses are present for George&#x27;s swearing-in as president of the Ancient and Honorable Order of Mammals, Subdivision Humans. Sabina is present, also, in the guise of a scheming beauty queen, who tries to steal George&#x27;s affection from his wife and family. The conventioneers are rowdy and party furiously, but there is an undercurrent of foreboding as a fortune teller warns of an impending storm. The weather soon transforms from summery sunshine to hurricane to deluge. Gladys and George each attempt their individual rebellions, and are brought back into line by the family. The act ends with the family members reconciled and, paralleling the Biblical story of Noah&#x27;s Ark, directing pairs of animals to safety on a large boat where they survive the storm and the end of the world.

===Act III===
The final act takes place in the ruins of the Antrobuses&#x27; former home. A devastating war has occurred; Maggie and Gladys have survived by hiding in a cellar. When they come out of the cellar we see that Gladys has a baby. Sabina joins them, &quot;dressed as a Napoleonic camp-follower&quot;. George has been away at the front lines leading an army. Henry also fought, on the opposite side, and returns as a general. The family members discuss the ability of the human race to rebuild and continue after continually destroying itself. The question is raised: &quot;Is there any accomplishment or attribute of the human race of enough value that its civilization should be rebuilt?&quot;

The stage manager interrupts the play-within-the-play to explain that several members of their company can&#x27;t perform their parts, possibly due to food poisoning (as the actress playing Sabina saw blue mold on the lemon meringue pie at dinner). The stage manager drafts a janitor, a dresser, and other non-actors to fill their parts, which involve quoting philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle to mark the passing of time within the play.

The alternate history action ends where it began, with Sabina dusting the living room and worrying about George&#x27;s arrival from the office. Her final act is to address the audience and turn over the responsibility of continuing the action, or life, to them.

==Influences and criticism==
Similarities between the play and James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939) have been noted — such as a family that represents the totality of humanity, cyclical storytelling, and copious Biblical allusions. One such comparison was published in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; during the play&#x27;s run on Broadway. Norman Cousins, editor of the &quot;Review,&quot; printed a short article by Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson titled &quot;The Skin of Whose Teeth? The Strange Case of Mr. Wilder&#x27;s New Play and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;&quot; in the issue for December 19, 1942, with a second part in the February 13, 1943, issue.

In Campbell&#x27;s book &quot;Pathways to Bliss&quot;, Campbell recalls his reaction to the similarities he noted between Wilder&#x27;s play and Joyce&#x27;s novel:
Campbell claimed to have compared &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; and the book form of &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; and found &quot;nearly two hundred and fifty analogues—characters, themes, and finally a four-line, word-for-word quote.&quot;

The fact is that Wilder was one of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;&#x27;s early champions — Wilder wrote to Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas in August 1939, a few months after the book&#x27;s publication, that &quot;One of my absorptions [...] has been James Joyce&#x27;s new novel, digging out its buried keys and resolving that unbroken chain of erudite puzzles.&quot;

Campbell and Robinson&#x27;s reviews-cum-denunciations created a huge uproar at the time.
&quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine&#x27;s Wolcott Gibbs satirized Campbell and Robinson&#x27;s accusations in a December 26, 1942, piece called &quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Teeth.&quot;

==Notable productions==

The original production starred Tallulah Bankhead, Fredric March, Florence Eldridge, and Montgomery Clift. Bankhead won a Variety Award for Best Actress and the New York Drama Critics Award for Best Actress of the Year for her role as Sabina. When she left the production in March 1943, she was replaced by Miriam Hopkins. Hopkins was in turn replaced by Gladys George. For two performances, while George was ill, Lizabeth Scott, who had been Bankhead&#x27;s understudy, was called in to play the role. Scott then played the role for the production&#x27;s run in Boston. Originally billed in New York as &quot;Elizabeth Scott&quot;, she dropped the &quot;E&quot; before taking the part in Boston, and it became her breakthrough role.

Following a pre-London tryout tour of the UK, the play had its London premiere at the Phoenix Theatre on 16 May 1945, where it ran for 77 performances, closing 21 July 1945. It re-opened in London at the Piccadilly Theatre on 11 September 1946, running there for a further 109 performances, until 14 December. Directed by Laurence Olivier, Sabina was played by Vivien Leigh, with Cecil Parker as George Antrobus (George Devine at the Piccadilly). The Oliviers also included the production on their Old Vic tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1948. Leigh revived the role in a 1959 television production filmed live by Granada Television, also starring George Devine as Mr. Antrobus and Ruth Dunning as Mrs. Antrobus.

The play was revived on Broadway in 1955, premiering at the ANTA Theatre. It was staged by the Edinburgh Gateway Company in 1961.

In 1983, &quot;American Playhouse&quot;, on PBS, aired a production that was produced at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. It starred Blair Brown, Harold Gould, Sada Thompson, Rue McClanahan and Jeffrey Combs, and was directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien.

New York City&#x27;s Public Theater presented a production as part of its 1998 summer Shakespeare in the Park festival at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. That production starred Kristen Johnston, John Goodman and Frances Conroy. It was directed by Irene Lewis.

In 2017, Theatre for a New Audience performed &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; directed by Arin Arbus. It won the 2017 Obie Award for Directing and Performance by Kecia Lewis.

A Broadway revival of the play directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz premiered at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in previews on April 1, 2022, and officially on April 25. It was subsequently nominated for six Tony Awards including Best Direction, Best Lead Actress, Best Costume Design, Best Lighting Design, Best Sound Design, and Best Set Design.

<text>Leo Sayer is the sixth album by English-Australian singer-songwriter Leo Sayer, released in 1978.

The song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You (Though I Try)&quot; became a hit when Phil Collins recorded it in 2002.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that Sayer &quot;has fully abandoned the style which pushed him on to the charts, a pop-disco hybrid... In its place, he has recently offered a plate full of mellow tunes, geared primarily to show off his vocal chords, which have in the past played second fiddle to large orchestras.&quot;

AllMusic noted that &quot;this album is one of the artist&#x27;s most respectable in a large body of good work&quot;.

<doc id="1234555" wikidata="Q388320" url="?curid=1234555" title="Avishai Cohen (bassist)">
<text>Avishai Cohen (; born April 20, 1970) is an Israeli jazz double bassist, composer, singer, and arranger.

==Early life==
Avishai was born in Kabri, a kibbutz in northern Israel. He has Sephardic, Greek-Jewish and Polish-Jewish ancestry. He grew up in a musical family at Motza and Beit Zayit near Jerusalem until the age of six, when his family moved to nearby Shoeva. He began playing the piano at 9 years old but changed to the bass guitar at the age of 14, inspired by bassist Jaco Pastorius, whose music was introduced to Cohen by a music teacher in St Louis, Missouri, where Cohen had moved with his family as a teenager. When his family moved back to Israel he joined the Music and Arts Academy in Jerusalem with a focus on acoustic bass.

== Musical career ==
At age 22, after having served for two years in an army band, Avishai moved to New York City, where he initially performed on the streets while working in construction. While studying at the New School in Greenwich Village he became part of the trio (piano, bass, and drums) of Panamanian pianist Danilo Pérez, which recorded &quot;PanaMonk&quot;, a tribute album to Thelonious Monk with Latin touches, and led Avishai to experiment with Latin sounds. In 1996, Avishai became a co-founder of Chick Corea&#x27;s Origin sextet. In 1997, Avishai became a member of Chick Corea’s New Trio. During the six years of musical collaboration with Corea, Avishai fine-tuned his skills as a performer and composer.

Avishai’s first four albums, &quot;Adama&quot; (1998), &quot;Devotion&quot; (1999), &quot;Colors&quot; (2000) and &quot;Unity&quot; (2001) were released under Corea’s Stretch Records label and featured Mediterranean and Latin influences as well as the use of horns and vocals. Unity was recorded with the &quot;International Vamp Band&quot;, a group of fellow musicians formed by Avishai, from different parts of the world (Mexico, Argentina, Cuba and Israel). The idea behind the project was to allow different cultures to interact and converse using the medium of music. Avishai helped Chilean singer Claudia Acuña create her first album &quot;Wind From The South&quot; (2000).
In 2002, Cohen founded his record label, Razdaz Recordz. &quot;I&#x27;ve always been interested in several genres of music, including jazz, rock, pop, Latin and funk,&quot; says Cohen. &quot;I&#x27;m always packed with ideas. I decided to start my own label because I&#x27;m involved in so many different projects.&quot; &quot;Lyla&quot; was the first album released by Razdaz. Cohen reflected on his work, &quot;Lyla reflects much of who I am as an artist. The &quot;International Vamp Band&quot; has been touring for two years and I wanted to document that. I also started a rock band &quot;Gadu&quot; with US drummer named Mark Guiliana [...] I&#x27;ve also been working on pop tunes with a female vocalist named Lola. And, of course, to show the whole picture on the CD, I wanted to acknowledge my relationship to Chick.&quot;

In 2005 he released the album &quot;At Home&quot;, described as one of his most striking records, featuring the composition &quot;Remembering&quot;, a highly evocative trio ballad which became his most beloved and demanded encore at live performances, as well as being highly demanded for use in film and TV.

The cosmopolitan &quot;Continuo&quot; (2006) followed with great success. In 2007, the live recording As Is, Live at the Blue Note marked his return to New York for a series of live concerts at the Blue Note Jazz Club. 

With &quot;Gently Disturbed&quot; (Razdaz Recordz, 2008), a trio album featuring Mark Guiliana on drums and Shai Maestro on piano, Avishai Cohen received major international acclaim by critics and audiences alike.

After residing for many years in New York City, Avishai moved back to Israel and released &quot;Sha&#x27;ot Regishot&quot; (2008), , which attained gold sales status in Israel. It was the first album to introduce vocals in all its compositions as well as songs in Hebrew. 

In &quot;Aurora&quot; (2009), Avishai blended jazz, classical music and Sephardic traditions, while further exploring his abilities as a singer.

In 2011, Avishai Cohen released the critically acclaimed album &quot;Seven Seas&quot; (Emi/Blue Note).

In 2012, he released the duo album &quot;Duende&quot; (Emi/Blue Note) with Israeli pianist Nitai Hershkovits. For his performance in &quot;Duende&quot;, he won the 2013 Echo Jazz Award for International Bass Instrumentalist of the Year.

The release of &quot;Almah&quot; (Warner/Parlophone, 2013), combined his trio with a string quartet, incorporating classical music elements for the first time in his career.

2015 saw the release of the new, highly anticipated trio album, &quot;From Darkness&quot; (Razdaz Recordz) featuring Nitai Hershkovits on piano Daniel Dor on drums, a trio configuration that was highly praised by critics.

In 2016, he presented “An Evening with Avishai Cohen”, a project featuring a dynamic core trio, with the integration of full orchestra, for which he collaborated with over 25 orchestras such as the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, the Malmö Symphony Orchestra, Luxembourg Philharmonic, Brussels Philharmonic, the BBC Concert Orchestra, Philharmonic Orchestra Essen, Brno Philharmonic, Lviv Philharmonic, and the Philharmonie de Paris.

In 2017, Avishai Cohen released the album &quot;1970&quot; (Sony), in which he explored a more accessible, pop/rock sound as well as his vocal expression.

In 2019, he returned to his distinctive trio configuration with his album &quot;Arvoles&quot; (Razdaz Recordz) featuring Noam David on drums and Elchin Shirinov on piano.

In 2020, he announced that he was joining French label Naïve Records (Believe Digital) as an exclusive recording artist.

In 2021, Avishai Cohen released the album &quot;Two Roses&quot; (Naïve Records - Believe Digital) with the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra conducted by Alexander Hanson and with his trio including Mark Guiliana on drums and Elchin Shirinov on piano.

== Style ==
Cohen&#x27;s signature sound is a blend of Middle Eastern, eastern European, and African-American musical idioms. His compositions reflect an expansive musical universe and embrace a blend of traditions, cultures, languages and styles, from Hebrew and Ladino folk songs, jazz standards, to pulsating contemporary jazz. &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes his 2006 album &quot;Continuo&quot; as conjoining &quot;heavy Middle Eastern groove with a delicate, almost New Age lyricism&quot;. Cohen often sings in Judaeo-Spanish (Ladino), to which he has a connection through his mother. For example, &quot;Morenika&quot;, from his album &quot;Aurora&quot;, is a very famous Ladino song he grew up hearing his mother singing around the house. Over the years Cohen has been creating and performing more music and arrangements associated with classical music, combining the richness of composed music and the freedom of jazz in his musical statement.

<doc id="1234557" wikidata="Q64201" url="?curid=1234557" title="Charlotte von Stein">
<text>Charlotte Albertine Ernestine von Stein (also mentioned as &quot;Charlotta Ernestina Bernadina von Stein&quot; ), born von Schardt; 25 December 1742, Eisenach – 6 January 1827, Weimar, was a lady-in-waiting at the court in Weimar and a close friend to both Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, whose work and life were strongly influenced by her.

==Childhood==

Charlotte&#x27;s parents were Hofmarschall Johann Wilhelm Christian von Schardt and Koncordia Elisabeth Irving of Drum. Her father was an eccentric, and her mother who had had Scottish ancestors was said to be very quiet and dutiful.

Her younger sister was married Baron and painter and was mother of writer Amalia von Helvig.

Her parents moved to Weimar when Charlotte was young and she was prepared for working as a lady-in-waiting. Her education included literature, art, singing and dancing. Charlotte was described as unobtrusive, witty, graceful and dutiful like her mother was. She had a weak constitution but was an avid writer.

==Profession and family==

In 1758 Charlotte became a lady-in-waiting to Anna Amalia, Duchess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, whom she served until the Duchess&#x27;s death in 1807. On 17 May 1764 Charlotte married Baron . It was not a marriage for love, but for social and political interests. Often Charlotte remained alone in Weimar, as her husband travelled a great deal in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Weimar in Jena. From 1764 to 1773 she gave birth to seven children. Four daughters died; three boys, Karl, Ernst and Fritz, survived. After her seventh child was born, Charlotte was physically exhausted, and took a succession of cures. She was also the aunt of Amalia von Helvig, who became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.

==Works==

Charlotte von Stein wrote four plays, only one was published during her lifetime, &quot;Die zwey Emilien&quot; (&quot;The Two Emilies&quot;). The play was published anonymously, but with Schiller&#x27;s name on the cover, which led many to believe that he was the author. Not until 1923 was &quot;Die zwey Emilien&quot; published under Charlotte von Stein&#x27;s name. A second play, &quot;Die Probe&quot; (&quot;The Trial&quot; or &quot;The Rehearsal&quot;), may have been written by Charlotte von Stein. It was published in 1809 and has since disappeared. Charlotte von Stein wrote two more texts, both of which were untitled and have also been lost. The first was a story and the second another comedy. 

&quot;Rino&quot; (1776)

&quot;Dido&quot; (1794)

&quot;Neues Freiheitssystem oder die Verschwörungen gegen die Liebe&quot; (&quot;New System of Freedom or the Conspiracy Against Love&quot;) (1798)

&quot;Die zwey Emilien&quot; (&quot;The Two Emilies&quot;) (1800)

==Charlotte and Goethe==

In 1774 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charlotte von Stein met in Weimar. It was the beginning of a deep friendship which lasted for twelve years. During this time she had a strong influence on Goethe&#x27;s work and life. Goethe took into his house her eleven-year-old son Fritz (her darling), in May 1783, and took over the boy&#x27;s education to her satisfaction.

This period of her life might have been the happiest since she was in the center of social life and attention and met many famous personalities, e.g., Friedrich Schiller, Karl Ludwig Knebel, and Johann Georg Zimmermann. She frequently corresponded with Schiller&#x27;s wife Charlotte.

==In the eyes of her contemporaries==

Knebel has given an outstanding depiction of von Stein&#x27;s nature:

==Loneliness and death==

In 1786 the deep friendship between Charlotte and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe ended with his sudden departure to Italy without telling her. Not until after 1800 did their relationship begin to normalize and even then it never became as close as before.

After her husband had died in 1793 Charlotte retired from society and became more and more lonely.
In 1794 she wrote the drama &quot;Dido&quot;— a literary self-portrait that also depicted her disappointment about Goethe&#x27;s behavior. It reflected the years from 1770 to 1790 and the situation in Weimar at that time. As depicted by Virgil, Dido (Queen of Carthage) was forsaken by her lover Aeneas who set off for Italy - an obvious parallel to von Stein herself and Goethe.

Charlotte von Stein died on 6 January 1827 at the age of 84.

==Legacy==

The German poet Peter Hacks presented his play &quot;Gespräch im Hause Stein über den abwesenden Herrn von Goethe&quot; (A Discussion in the Stein Home about the Absent Mr. Goethe) in 1974. This monodrama became a worldwide success and is seen as a subtle analysis of the fate of Charlotte von Stein.

<text>Stephen Paul Motian (March 25, 1931 – November 22, 2011) was an American jazz drummer, percussionist, and composer of Armenian descent. He played an important role in freeing jazz drummers from strict time-keeping duties.

Motian first came to prominence in the late 1950s in the piano trio of Bill Evans and later was a regular in pianist Keith Jarrett&#x27;s band for about a decade (c. 1967–1976). The drummer began his career as a bandleader in the early 1970s. Perhaps his two most notable groups were a longstanding trio with guitarist Bill Frisell and saxophonist Joe Lovano as well as the Electric Bebop Band, in which he worked mostly with younger musicians on interpretations of bebop standards.

==Biography==

Motian was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and raised in Providence, Rhode Island. He was of Armenian descent. After playing guitar in his childhood, Motian began playing the drums at age 12, eventually touring New England in a swing band. During the Korean War he joined the Navy.

Motian became a professional musician in 1954, and briefly played with pianist Thelonious Monk. He became well known as the drummer in pianist Bill Evans&#x27;s trio (1959–64), initially alongside bassist Scott LaFaro and later with Chuck Israels.

Subsequently, he played with pianists Paul Bley (1963–64) and Keith Jarrett (1967–76). Other musicians with whom Motian performed and/or recorded in the early period of his career included Lennie Tristano, Warne Marsh, Lee Konitz, Joe Castro, Arlo Guthrie (Motian performed briefly with Guthrie in 1968–69, including at Woodstock), Carla Bley, Charlie Haden, and Don Cherry. Motian subsequently worked with musicians such as Marilyn Crispell, Bill Frisell, Leni Stern, Joe Lovano, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Alan Pasqua, Bill McHenry, Stéphan Oliva, Frank Kimbrough, Eric Watson and many more.

Later in his career, Motian became an important composer and group leader, recording initially for ECM Records in the 1970s and early 1980s and then for Soul Note, JMT, and Winter &amp; Winter before returning to ECM in 2005. From the early 1980s he led a trio featuring guitarist Bill Frisell and saxophonist Joe Lovano, occasionally joined by bassists Ed Schuller, Charlie Haden, or Marc Johnson, and other musicians, including Jim Pepper, Lee Konitz, Dewey Redman and Geri Allen. In addition to playing Motian&#x27;s compositions, the group recorded tributes to Thelonious Monk and Bill Evans, and a series of &quot;Paul Motian on Broadway&quot; albums, featuring original interpretations of jazz standards.

Despite his important associations with pianists, Motian&#x27;s work as a leader since the 1970s rarely included a pianist in his ensembles and relied heavily on guitarists. Motian&#x27;s first instrument was the guitar, and he apparently retained an affinity for the instrument: in addition to his groups with Frisell, his first two solo albums on ECM featured Sam Brown, and his Electric Bebop Band featured two and occasionally three electric guitars. The group was founded in the early 1990s, and featured a variety of young guitar and saxophone players. 

In 2011 Motian featured on a number of new recordings, including &quot;Live at Birdland&quot; (with Lee Konitz, Brad Mehldau and Charlie Haden), Samuel Blaser&#x27;s &quot;Consort in Motion&quot;, &quot;No Comment&quot; by Augusto Pirodda, and &quot;Further Explorations&quot; with Chick Corea and Eddie Gómez. Bill McHenry&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts of the Sun&quot; was released - by coincidence - on the day of Motian&#x27;s death. Motian&#x27;s final album as bandleader was &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind&quot;, featuring Bill Frisell, Thomas Morgan and Petra Haden.

==Death==
Motian died on November 22, 2011 at the age of 80 at New York&#x27;s Mount Sinai Hospital of complications from myelodysplastic syndrome.

==Box set releases==
CAM Jazz released a box set titled &quot;Paul Motian&quot; in September 2010. This release compiles a number of albums which were originally issued by the Soul Note label: &quot;The Story of Maryam&quot;, &quot;Jack of Clubs&quot;, &quot;Misterioso&quot;, &quot;Notes&quot; (with Paul Bley), &quot;One Time Out&quot; (with Bill Frisell and Joe Lovano) and &quot;Flux and Change&quot; (duet with Enrico Pieranunzi).

In November 2012, Winter &amp; Winter released &quot;Paul Motian on Broadway Vol. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5&quot; which collects the five volumes of &quot;On Broadway&quot; into a single set.

ECM Records released a box set titled &quot;Paul Motian&quot; in April 2013, as part of the label&#x27;s continuing &quot;Old &amp; New Masters Edition&quot; series. This set compiles the six albums that Motian recorded for ECM between 1972 and 1984; &quot;Conception Vessel&quot;, &quot;Tribute&quot;, &quot;Dance&quot;, &quot;Le Voyage&quot;, &quot;Psalm&quot; and &quot;It Should&#x27;ve Happened a Long Time Ago&quot;.

==Posthumous releases==
The first posthumous release to feature Motian was &quot;Sunrise&quot; by the Masabumi Kikuchi Trio (with Thomas Morgan), released in March 2012 by ECM. This was followed in July 2012 by &quot;Owls Talk&quot; by Alexandra Grimal (also featuring Lee Konitz and Gary Peacock), released by Harmonia Mundi.

Two live recordings, led by pianist Enrico Pieranunzi, have been released by CAM Jazz; &quot;New York Reflections: Live at Birdland&quot; (with Steve Swallow) was released in October 2012 (exclusively in vinyl format), while &quot;Live at the Village Vanguard&quot; (with Marc Johnson) was issued in March 2013.

CAM Jazz reissued &quot;One Time Out&quot; in March 2013, in 180g vinyl format. A compact disc edition is supplied with it. &quot;One Time Out&quot; was also issued on CD as part of the CAM Jazz &quot;Paul Motian&quot; boxset.

In 2023, Frozen Reeds released &quot;Duo in Concert,&quot; recordings of Motian freely improvising with Derek Bailey, from their two known live performances.

==Motian compositions recorded by others and tributes==
&quot;Motian Sickness – The Music of Paul Motian (for the Love of Sarah)&quot; was released in September 2011, featuring Jeff Cosgrove, John Hebert, Mat Maneri and Jamie Masefield.

November 2011 saw the release of Joel Harrison&#x27;s &quot;String Choir: The Music of Paul Motian&quot;. Harrison arranged Motian&#x27;s music for a string quartet (featuring Christian Howes, Sam Bardfeld, Mat Maneri, and Dana Leong), plus two guitars (Liberty Ellman and Harrison).

Russ Lossing&#x27;s &quot;Drum Music: Music of Paul Motian (Solo Piano)&quot; was released in July 2012 by Sunnyside Records. Lossing originally recorded the album to celebrate Motian&#x27;s 80th birthday; he published a video on YouTube about the recording.

Ravi Coltrane included the Motian composition &quot;Fantasm&quot; on his 2012 album &quot;Spirit Fiction&quot;. The performance features Joe Lovano.

Noël Akchoté independently released &quot;Fiasco (Plays the Music of Paul Motian)&quot; in July 2015, exclusively in digital format. It features solo acoustic guitar arrangements of twenty Motian compositions.

In 2016, Jean-Marc Padovani released &quot;Motian in Motion&quot; via Naïve Jazz.

In 2018, the Carl Michel Group released &quot;Music in Motian&quot; via Play On Records.

In 2020, Haşmet Asilkan arranged the songs of Motian for solo guitar and released them under the title &quot;Paul Motian Songbook&quot;

<text>The Spring Grove, Avondale and Cincinnati Railway, now defunct, was a one and one-quarter mile long, narrow gauge railroad of Hamilton County, Ohio that provided access to the Cincinnati Zoo.

The company was chartered in February 1881 to build a line connecting Cincinnati, Avondale, St. Bernard, and Venice in Butler County. However, on May 3, 1881, less than three months later, the company was leased for ninety-nine years to the narrow gauge Cincinnati Northern Railway, which built the line as a spur from a point at its own line, called Avondale Junction, to the zoo. It was a popular route, easily enabling visits to the zoo.

On March 6, 1883, the company was merged with the Cincinnati Northern into the Toledo, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad. After that company&#x27;s bankruptcy and sale at auction, the Spring Grove was sold at auction in January 1886 and became part of the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway. In September 1888, holders of Spring Grove bonds sued over non-payment. A receiver was appointed in July 1889, all service on the road ceased the following month, and the line was torn up in September.

<text>Primula bulleyana is a species of flowering plant in the family Primulaceae, native to hillsides in China.

==Description==
&quot;Primula bulleyana&quot; is one of a group known as candelabra primulas, so called because of the tiered arrangement of their flowers. It is a semi-evergreen perennial. The sturdy, erect flowering stems appear in summer and are long, rising in groups from a rosette of leaves long and broad. The whorls of multiple orange-yellow flowers, opening from red buds, are arranged in tiers. It thrives in a bright, moist environment, such as beside a pond.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. 

==History==
It was first introduced by George Forrest from Yunnan province, China, in 1906, and named after Arthur K Bulley, his first sponsor, who was a cotton broker from Liverpool and a keen amateur gardener. He founded the Bees Ltd. nursery and was responsible for the introduction of many hardy plants and alpines to Britain in the early 20th century.

==Subspecies==

The plant formerly known as Primula beesiana (Bee&#x27;s primrose) is now regarded as a synonym of &quot;P. bulleyana&quot; subsp. &quot;beesiana&quot; () . It is similar in size and form to its parent, but has purple blooms. It is likewise a recipient of the RHS award.

<doc id="1234577" wikidata="Q477535" url="?curid=1234577" title="Sequitur algorithm">
<text>Sequitur (or Nevill-Manning–Witten algorithm) is a recursive algorithm developed by Craig Nevill-Manning and Ian H. Witten in 1997 that infers a hierarchical structure (context-free grammar) from a sequence of discrete symbols. The algorithm operates in linear space and time. It can be used in data compression software applications.

== Constraints ==
The sequitur algorithm constructs a grammar by substituting repeating phrases in the given sequence with new rules and therefore produces a concise representation of the sequence. For example, if the sequence is
: S→abcab,
the algorithm will produce
: S→AcA, A→ab.
While scanning the input sequence, the algorithm follows two constraints for generating its grammar efficiently: digram uniqueness and rule utility.

=== Digram uniqueness ===
Whenever a new symbol is scanned from the sequence, it is appended with the last scanned symbol to form a new digram. If this digram has been formed earlier then a new rule is made to replace both occurrences of the digrams.
Therefore, it ensures that no digram occurs more than once in the grammar. For example, in the sequence S→abaaba, when the first four symbols are already scanned, digrams formed are ab, ba, aa. When the fifth symbol is read, a new digram &#x27;ab&#x27; is formed which exists already. Therefore, both instances of &#x27;ab&#x27; are replaced by a new rule (say, A) in &quot;S&quot;. Now, the grammar becomes S→AaAa, A→ab, and the process continues until no repeated digram exists in the grammar.

=== Rule utility ===
This constraint ensures that all the rules are used more than once in the right sides of all the productions of the grammar, i.e., if a rule occurs just once, it should be removed from the grammar and its occurrence should be substituted with the symbols from which it is created. For example, in the above example, if one scans the last symbol and applies digram uniqueness for &#x27;Aa&#x27;, then the grammar will produce: S→BB, A→ab, B→Aa. Now, rule &#x27;A&#x27; occurs only once in the grammar in B→Aa. Therefore, A is deleted and finally the grammar becomes
: S→BB, B→aba.
This constraint helps reduce the number of rules in the grammar.

== Method summary ==
The algorithm works by scanning a sequence of terminal symbols and building a list of all the symbol pairs which it has read. Whenever a second occurrence of a pair is discovered, the two occurrences are replaced in the sequence by an invented nonterminal symbol, the list of symbol pairs is adjusted to match the new sequence, and scanning continues. If a pair&#x27;s nonterminal symbol is used only in the just created symbol&#x27;s definition, the used symbol is replaced by its definition and the symbol is removed from the defined nonterminal symbols. Once the scanning has been completed, the transformed sequence can be interpreted as the top-level rule in a grammar for the original sequence. The rule definitions for the nonterminal symbols which it contains can be found in the list of symbol pairs. Those rule definitions may themselves contain additional nonterminal symbols whose rule definitions can also be read from elsewhere in the list of symbol pairs.

<text>Limerick Football Club () was an association football club based in Limerick, Ireland who played in the League of Ireland and currently have teams competing in the underage National League of Ireland.

The first Limerick Football Club was founded in 1937 and has had a number of guises through its history, known at different times as Limerick, Limerick United, Limerick City and Limerick 37. Each manifestation of the club has been the sole representative of senior football in Limerick city since 1937.

Limerick won the League of Ireland title twice, in the 1959–60 and 1979–80 seasons, and the FAI Cup twice, in 1971 and 1982. They also won the League of Ireland Cup three times, 1975–76, 1992–93 and 2001–02. The club competed in European competitions on six occasions.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
Limerick got its first taste of senior soccer in the early 1930s when the Limerick District Management Committee (LDMC) arranged a number of friendly matches between senior clubs such as Waterford United and Bray and a local junior selection. The success of these fixtures prompted the LDMC to form a senior side and attempt to gain entry to the Free State League. Their application was accepted in June 1937 and a Limerick senior team replaced Dolphin who had withdrawn from the league. On 19 July 1937, a new, private company, Limerick Association Football and Sports Co. Ltd, was registered.

On 22 August 1937, Limerick played its first match. It was against Shamrock Rovers in the Dublin City Cup, a prominent competition that ran from the 1930s to the 1970s, and won 1–0. They ended the 1937–38 season in 10th place out of 12 teams, but managed to capture their first trophy when they beat Cork United 1–0 in the replayed final of the Munster Senior Cup at the Markets Field. During those early seasons, Limerick lined out in red-and-white striped jerseys and white shorts. When Waterford resigned from the league in 1941, the club purchased their blue jerseys and would wear blue and white for the next 40 years.

The 1940s saw Limerick make some big improvements on the playing field and they were twice runners-up in the League of Ireland (1943–44 and 1944–45), were beaten in two FAI Cup semi-finals (1942–43 and 1946–47) and were runners-up in the League of Ireland Shield in 1945–46. The latter was the forerunner of the League Cup, the third most important competition after the League and the FAI Cup. They won the Munster Senior Cup again in 1948–49. It was not until the 1950s that Limerick captured their first national title when they won the Shield in 1953. They added to this when they captured the Dublin City Cup in 1958–59, beating Drumcondra in the final.

===League of Ireland champions and FAI Cup winners===
Limerick captured their first League of Ireland championship in the 1959–60 season under the management of Limerick man Sonny Price, who had played for Limerick, Waterford and Glentoran. Although they lost their last match 3–2 to St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic on Sunday, 17 April 1960, they still managed to win the league by two points from Cork Celtic. Unlike other years, when the majority of the sides were local, this team had a nucleus of Dublin-based players who supplied six to the panel, with five from Limerick, two from Cork and the remainder from junior circles.

The Limerick board decided they wanted to develop an all-local team and so they brought in Ewan Fenton, then aged 29, from Wrexham to implement their plan, starting for the 1960–61 season. He was an immediate hit with staff, players and fans and his quiet and undemonstrative personality ensured he became very popular. He also helped build on the success that Sonny Price had gained with the team and introduced a great number of talented local players to League of Ireland football.

Limerick lost FAI Cup finals in 1965 and again in 1966 to Shamrock Rovers before they finally captured the title in 1971, beating Drogheda United 3–0 in a replay. That team included Andy McEvoy, Richie Hall, Kevin Fitzpatrick, Al Finucane, Dave Barrett, Sean Byrnes, Tony Meaney, Joe O’Mahony, Hughie Hamilton and Paddy Shortt. Fenton also advanced the careers of other notable Limerick players such as Dessie McNamara, Gerry McCarthy, Mick Doyle, Dick O’Connor, Johnny Walsh, Pat Nolan and Ger Duggan. Limerick had captured a further two Dublin City Cups under Fenton, in 1967 and 1970.

Ewan Fenton left Limerick in 1967 to talk up the managerial position with Linfield, and enjoyed considerable success with that club, winning seven titles in three years. The early 1970s saw some turbulent financial times for Limerick coupled with diminishing fortunes on the field. Fenton returned as manager for the 1975–76 season and introduced a number of young players, without much success in the league, but won the League Cup that season, beating Sligo Rovers 4–0 in the final. Frankie Johnson took over as manager for the 1976–77 season and Limerick were beaten 2–0 by Dundalk in the FAI Cup Final, but this was again coupled with a poor league performance.

Eoin Hand arrived as player-manager from Portsmouth for the 1979–80 season and guided the club to its second League of Ireland Championship. Tony Meaney scored a penalty in the ultimate game, a 1–1 draw against Athlone Town, to finish one point ahead of Dundalk. Hand was still in charge when Limerick won the FAI Cup again in 1982, defeating Bohemians in the final at Dalymount Park. This marked Kevin Fitzpatrick&#x27;s final game in goal after 22 seasons.

===Limerick City===
The club had changed its name to Limerick United in 1977 and won a League of Ireland championship and FAI Cup under this name. Affairs at the club began to deteriorate after the FAI Cup win in 1982 and the beginning of the 1983–84 season saw High Court action with a battle for ownership of the Limerick senior soccer club. Soccer in the city was suspended for eight weeks pending a decision, which went in favour of Pat Grace, who had the Irish franchise for Kentucky Fried Chicken. Grace changed the name of the club to Limerick City and also changed the colours from blue and white to yellow and green. Limerick City won the revived League of Ireland Shield and the Munster Senior Cup in its first season. The Shield was won in the last game played at the Markets Field on 22 April 1984. They moved out of the Market&#x27;s Field to a new home in Rathbane for the start of the 1984–85 season. This move proved ultimately to be unpopular with the fans and heralded a decline in the club&#x27;s fortunes. The 1985–86 season saw the League of Ireland being divided into two divisions for the first time – the Premier Division and First Division, with Limerick in the Premier Division.

Billy Hamilton was brought in as player manager in 1987. Hamilton had enjoyed considerable success as a player at Burnley and Oxford United and played in two World Cup finals with Northern Ireland. He stayed at Limerick for two seasons, guiding the club to a third-place finish in the League in his second season in charge. However, the only trophy won during that period was the Munster Senior Cup in 1988. He resigned in September 1989 and Pat Grace followed soon after. The club changed its name back to Limerick FC, the colours back to blue and white and Fr Joe Young became the new chairman.

===1990 to 2005===
Limerick were relegated for the first time in 1990–91, a year which also saw them lose a League Cup Final to Derry City. Sam Allardyce was appointed as player manager for the 1991–92 season and immediately brought the club back to the top flight. Allardyce only remained for one season, scoring three times in 23 appearances, before departing to take up a coaching role at Preston North End. Limerick finished a respectable sixth in the Premier Division the following season and also won the League Cup, beating St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic in the final. Relegation was to follow the next season and a long period of mediocrity and disappointment was to follow.

Financial problems plagued the club and they had to rely on the goodwill of a local junior side, Pike Rovers, for a home ground for the 2000–01 season. Fr Joe Young departed as chairman and the new chairman, Danny Drew, took the club back to Rathbane in an attempt to revive their fortunes. The 2001–02 season saw another League Cup victory, this time over Derry City in the final, but no improvement in the league followed over the coming seasons.

===Limerick 37===
The necessity for a new League of Ireland franchise in Limerick first became apparent in December 2006, when the FAI Club Licensing Appeal Board rejected Limerick FC&#x27;s appeal against its prior failure to attain the UEFA licence necessary for admission to the League of Ireland&#x27;s First Division for the 2007 season.

The FAI&#x27;s decision effectively disenfranchised the incumbent Limerick FC and its chairman Danny Drew, although the organisation remained receptive to the continued participation of Limerick within senior football. To this end, FAI chief executive John Delaney openly solicited approaches from other interested parties within the city of Limerick even as he announced the rejection of Limerick FC&#x27;s appeal: &quot;We want a healthy Limerick based club in the new Eircom League of Ireland and if interested entities seek a licence, we would assess them carefully for their suitability to meet the criteria required to play in the league.&quot;
On 3 January 2007, the FAI confirmed that its appeal for Limerick-based applicants to the league had garnered interest from a number of parties, one of which identified itself as Soccer Limerick, a consortium purporting to represent the entire spectrum of Limerick football, from schoolboy to Junior (amateur) level, and operating under the auspices of the Limerick Sports Partnership.

Eight days later, Soccer Limerick confirmed that its constituent committees had approved the submission of a formal application for a UEFA club licence, with a view to gaining entry to the First Division of the National League for the 2007 season, with a team called Limerick 37, named after the year that the original club was founded. Soccer Limerick spokesman Ger Finnan confirmed that Limerick 37 planned to stage home fixtures at Jackman Park, headquarters of the LDMC, and would announce the appointment of a first-team manager on Monday 15 January 2007. Paul McGee was subsequently appointed manager of Limerick 37, and signed 11 players before the start of the season.

With McGee&#x27;s results and style of play not going down well with the home fans, the club opted to replace him with former player and manager Mike Kerley, who brought about mid-table respectability, as well as an end of season run which saw Limerick end Waterford&#x27;s promotion hopes with a 5–1 win in Limerick, a 1–0 away defeat of eventual division winners Dundalk and a 1–1 draw away to Shelbourne, with Colin Scanlan&#x27;s late equaliser denying Shelbourne the title and promotion in the 2008 season.

However, just weeks before the start of the 2009 season, Kerley and the club unexpectedly parted ways, and following a brief and unsuccessful stop-gap solution of a three-man management team, Limerick moved to appoint Pat Scully.

===Limerick F.C.===
The name of the club was changed back to Limerick F.C. for the start of the 2009 season. By mid-2009, the club was in serious financial difficulty. A Limerick businessman, Pat O&#x27;Sullivan, made a significant donation to the club that July. He joined the board as chairman in August 2009 and became the owner in February 2010. Among his stated objectives were to stabilise the finances of the club and to build strong community links such as community based club programmes and youth development programmes.

Under manager Pat Scully, Limerick finally ended their long stay in the First Division, winning promotion to the Premier Division at the end of the 2012 season. Scully left the club at the end of the season and Stuart Taylor was brought in as manager. With a number of signings from both the UK and Europe, Limerick enjoyed a comfortable first season back in the Premier Division. The following season, however, Taylor was fired due to the club&#x27;s poor form, and Martin Russell was appointed as his replacement. Russell steadied the ship and the club avoided relegation in 2014. However, in 2015, the club were relegated. A terrible start to the season saw Limerick stranded at the bottom after failing to win any of the first 21 games, and despite an incredible run of form which saw Limerick avoid automatic relegation, they were demoted after losing 2–1 on aggregate to Finn Harps in a playoff.

The following season, with a squad of full-time professionals in a division of part-time teams, was little more than a procession for Limerick as they cruised to the 2016 First Division title. They won their first 12 games to open up a huge points lead and only lost one match all season, winning the division with 6 games to spare. They also beat two Premier Division teams along the way to a place in the final of the League Cup, but lost 4–1 to St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic.

After a poor start to the 2017 Premier Division, Martin Russell left his position and was temporarily replaced by Willie Boland, who had been manager of underage teams. Limerick secured a permanent replacement with the appointment of Neil McDonald, and the club finished the season in 7th place, as well as advancing to the FAI Cup semi-final for the first time in many years. In January, McDonald left the club in January 2018 to take up a position at Scunthorpe United and was replaced by Tommy Barrett, while Pat O&#x27;Sullivan announced his intention to sell his stake in the club.

===Treaty United===

In December 2019, Limerick FC were on the verge of extinction after the examinership process to try to keep their trading company afloat ended unsuccessfully. The club had debts of approximately €490,000 and did not receive a League of Ireland licence for the 2020 season. A new entity, named Limerick United, were granted a League of Ireland First Division license in January 2020. However, they were forced to change the name to Treaty United before the season started. In February 2020, Treaty United withdrew applications to join the League of Ireland underage structures for the 2020 season. Treaty entered the league for the first time ahead of the 2021 League of Ireland First Division season.

==Stadiums==
Limerick FC has used a number of venues around the city as their home ground over the years, including Markets Field in Garryowen, Jackman Park on Carey&#x27;s Road, Hogan Park in Rathbane, Thomond Park and Pike Rovers ground at Crossagalla. The Markets Field has always been considered to be the spiritual home of football in the city as the club enjoyed considerable success at the venue and moving from there to Hogan Park heralded a serious decline in the club&#x27;s fortunes. Up until 2012, and Limerick progress into the Premier Division the club was using Jackman Park, which belongs to the Limerick District League (LDMC), for home games. It has a training base at Knocklisheen, on the north side of the city. For the beginning of the new 2013 season, it was announced that Thomond Park would play host to Limerick FC&#x27;s home games for the coming seasons with some sources estimating it would be 2015 before Limerick would get to return to the Markets Field

In March 2011 it was announced that the Markets Field had been purchased by the Limerick Enterprise Development Partnership (LEDP) with a charitable donation from the JP McManus Charitable Foundation, with a view towards Limerick FC returning to the venue sometime during 2012. The club has plans to develop the site into an 8,000 capacity, all-seated stadium.
On promotion to the Airtricity League of Ireland Premier Division for the 2013 Season, Limerick moved to 26,500 capacity stadium Thomond Park for their home games. The club returned to the Markets Field on Friday 5 June 2015 for the first time in 31 years, losing 1–2 to Drogheda United in the League of Ireland Premier Division.

==European record==
Limerick appeared in European competitions on six occasions in its history. In 12 matches they scored seven goals and while the club never won a European game, it drew twice. One of those draws was achieved at The Dell against a Southampton team that included former European Footballer of the Year Kevin Keegan and Mick Channon. In the home fixture famous rugby international Tony Ward gave Yugoslav international defender Ivan Golac a roasting.

Limerick first competed in 1960 in the European Cup against Young Boys, but suffered their heaviest aggregate defeat. Limerick moved their 1965 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup home leg to Dalymount Park – one of only two &#x27;home&#x27; games played outside of Limerick. Pat Nolan is the only player ever to have scored for Limerick in Limerick in a European game.

The most famous European game was the &#x27;home&#x27; match against Real Madrid in the European Cup in 1980. Because of concerns over crowd control at both The Markets Field and Thomond Park, the match was played at Lansdowne Road in Dublin. Although a crowd of up to 30,000 was expected, Dublin football fans stayed away en masse and only 6,500 people saw a Limerick team, under Eoin Hand, almost beat the aristocrats of European football. A number of controversial refereeing decisions, including a disallowed Johnny Matthews goal and a dubious penalty award, went against Limerick and they were beaten by 2–1. Des Kennedy scored twice in the tie, one at home and one in the 5–1 away defeat, in front of a crowd of 60,000 in Madrid.

<doc id="1234590" wikidata="Q2352483" url="?curid=1234590" title="M-15 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-15 is a north–south state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan. The southern terminus is a junction with US Highway 24 (US 24) just south of Clarkston on the northwestern edge of the Detroit metropolitan area. The trunkline is a recreational route running north and northwest to the Tri-Cities area. The northern terminus is the junction with M-25 on the east side of Bay City. The total length is about between the two regions.

The original M-15 designation was used in the northern half of the state in 1919. This designation was wholly replaced by the US 41 on November 11, 1926. This previous designation contained the section of highway in Marquette County that is home to the first painted highway centerline in the nation. Another section in western Marquette County included the first bridge built by the state of Michigan. Within the next year after M-15 was replaced by US 41, the designation was reused for a new highway routing along the current highway. This current highway was extended northerly to eventually end at Interstate 75 (I-75) in Bay City, before it was scaled back slightly to end in southeast Bay City. A proposed, but unbuilt, extension around the west side of Metro Detroit later became part of the I-275 corridor.

This highway is now a part of the Pure Michigan Byway System, but none of it is located on the National Highway System. A section of the two-lane highway has the local moniker, &quot;Death Alley&quot;, where the local sheriff says the highway is poorly designed. The stretch of highway in Genesee County has been the location of 14 traffic fatalities between 2004 and 2009 as reported by &quot;The Flint Journal&quot;, including that of a 14-year-old local girl.

==Route description==

M-15 runs through mostly rural agricultural communities of The Thumb connecting the northern edge of Metro Detroit with the Tri-Cities area. It starts at a junction south of the village of Clarkston in northern Oakland County. The highway runs north along Ortonville Road from the intersection with US 24 (Dixie Highway) near Deer and Middle lakes through Clarkston. Continuing through town on Main Street near Parke Lake, it comes to an interchange with I-75 north of the village next to Little Walters Lake. South of Ortonville near Lake Louise and Bald Eagle Lake, M-15 turns northwest between the two lakes. The trunkline becomes State Road at the county line and turns north again near Shinanguag Lake near the Ortonville State Recreation Area outside Goodrich in southeastern Genesee County. South of Davison, M-15 intersects I-69 near the Davison Country Club before running through town. In Otisville, State Road curves around to the west of some small lakes and through town.

State Road turns northwesterly again in Millington in southwestern Tuscola County, heading up to Vassar. In Vassar, M-15 intersects and turns northwest along Huron Avenue, a historical routing of M-24, crossing the Cass River in town. Outside Vassar, Huron Avenue becomes Saginaw Road. In western Tuscola County, M-15 intersects M-46 in the community of Richville. The name of the road changes in Saginaw County to Vassar Road, and the trunkline continues northwesterly through the Blumfield Township communities of Blumfield Corners and Arthur. Arthur is located along the highway between the M-83 and M-81 junctions.

In Bay County, M-15 follows Tuscola Road where it meets the western terminus of M-138 which runs along Munger Road in Munger. As the highway enters Bay City on the southeast side of town, Tuscola Road leaves the farmlands for residential areas of Bay City. The roadway runs northerwesterly near the St. Stanislaus, St. Patrick and Elm Lawn cemeteries, before turning north on Trumbull Street at 10th Street. The highway follows Trumbull Street for five blocks, where the highway designation ends at a four-way intersection with M-25/Center Avenue. Trumbull Street continues north through this residential section of the city.

==History==

===Original designation===

On July 1, 1919, the original routing of M-15 was located in the Upper Peninsula (UP). It ran from the state line along the Menominee River in Menominee, connecting with STH-15 in Wisconsin, running north through the UP to Escanaba, Marquette and Houghton. Between Powers and Escanaba, M-15 ran concurrently with M-12. The northern terminus of the highway was at Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor. The first highway centerline in the nation was painted along a section of the highway in 1917, along the Marquette–Negaunee Road, now a part of Marquette County Road 492.

The Peshekee River Bridge, carried M-15 over the Peshekee River in western Marquette County&#x27;s Michigamme Township . The bridge was built in 1914 in response to the 1913 State Trunk Line Act passed by the Michigan Legislature. This act designated a state trunkline highway network of nearly . The act further said that the Michigan State Highway Department would design, build and maintain trunkline bridges spanning or more so long as the local governments improved an adjacent of roads. Marquette County built a mainline road from Marquette west to Michigamme near the county line, this road generally followed what is now known as County Road 492 (CR 492). About west of Marquette on CR 492 is a historical marker at the site of the first center line painted in 1917 along Dead Man&#x27;s Curve. M-15 continued through Morgan Meadows and crossing the Carp River into the town of Negaunee and connecting with Ishpeming. This road in now known as East Division or &quot;County Road&quot; also former Business M-28. West of Ishpeming in Ishpeming Township, M-15 followed Randal Drive and Westward to North Lake Junction. M-15 made its way along what is now CR 496 and several abandoned sections through Clarksburg and Humboldt Locations and the village of Champion. West of Champion M-15 continued to Michigamme crossing the Peshekee River, Marquette County improved a section in 1913 to encourage the state to build the bridge. The bridge was designed by C.V. Dewart for the department and built by the local firm of Powell and Mitchell in Marquette. The bridge was designated Trunk Line Bridge No. 1 as the first state-built bridge on the trunkline highway system.

The 1925 draft plan for the establishment of the US Highway System would have replaced M-15 with three different US Highways. Between Menominee and Powers, M-15 was to be replaced by US 41. East of Powers to Rapid River, the trunkline would have been US 2. The next segment between Rapid River and Humboldt was planned as US 102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was not numbered as a US Highway. When the system was announced on November 11, 1926, US 41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M-15. The original map showed US 41 following an unbuilt alignment between Powers and Marquette, but the US 41 designation was instead routed to follow the former M-15.

===Current designation===
The current routing of M-15 was designated after 1926. The southern end was located at US 10 in Clarkston running north to M-38 and M-24 in Vassar. By the end of 1936, M-15 was extended concurrently along M-24 from Vassar into Bay City. By June 1942, the M-24 concurrency was removed as M-24 was realigned to replace M-85 between Vassar and Caro. By July 1, 1960, the northern end was extended to run concurrently with M-25 and BUS US 23 to US 23 on the west side of Bay City. This M-15/M-25 routing was extended again in the next year to end at the new I-75/US 10/US 23 freeway. These two northerly extensions were both reversed and scaled back in 1970. M-15&#x27;s northern end is moved back to M-25/Center Avenue in Bay City, its current location. At some time after the 1993 beginning of the program, M-15 was named the &quot;Pathway to Family Fun&quot; Recreational Heritage Route in what is now the Pure Michigan Byway System.
Running roughly parallel to I-75, the route has not been added to the National Highway System, a system of roadways considered important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense and mobility.

The state highway map in 1933 showed a proposed southern extension from Clarkston through southern Oakland County, Wayne County into Monroe County. This proposed highway would have bypassed Metro Detroit to the west through Farmington, Northville, Plymouth and Belleville. The full highway was never built, and M-15 was never extended south of Clarkston, but part of this proposal was completed. Much of it later became Haggerty Highway, and part of the I-275 and M-5 corridors.

===&quot;Death Alley&quot;===
M-15 between the Oakland County line and I-69 has been nicknamed by locals as &quot;Death Alley&quot;. On April 17, 2009, &quot;The Flint Journal&quot; reported that between 2004 and April 2009, 14 people died on the stretch of road in car accidents. When Genesee County Sheriff Robert J. Pickell was asked about the stretch, he said the road suffers from a bad design, including a lack of turn lanes. He was quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a death trap&quot;. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) looks at roadways after every fatal crash to determine what improvements could be made. Other local government officials have called for solutions to safety issues on the roadway.

<text>William Gilpin (4 June 1724 – 5 April 1804) was an English artist, Church of England cleric, schoolmaster and author. He is best known as a travel writer and as one of those who originated the idea of the picturesque.

==Life==
Gilpin was born in Cumberland, the son of Captain John Bernard Gilpin, a soldier and amateur artist. From an early age he was an enthusiastic painter, sketcher and collector of prints. However, while his brother Sawrey Gilpin became a full-time professional painter, William opted for a career in the church, graduating from Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1748.

While still at Oxford, Gilpin anonymously published &quot;A Dialogue upon the Gardens... at Stow in Buckinghamshire&quot; (1748). Part guidebook to Stowe, part essay on aesthetics, it shows that Gilpin had already begun to develop his ideas on the picturesque. Unusually for the time, Gilpin showed an appreciation of wild and rugged mountain scenery, perhaps rooted in his Cumbrian upbringing. Even more unusually, he expressed ideas about the perception of beauty which were purely aesthetic and often divorced from other qualities of the object viewed, such as morality or utility. He is credited with helping to originate the idea of the “picturesque”, producing many pictures in this style. The British Museum holds 113 object of his including many of his drawings.
Interestingly, an album of his paintings in the picturesque style was sold at Christie&#x27;s in 2008 for nearly £10,000.

After working as curate, Gilpin became master, and from 1755 headmaster at Cheam School. Perhaps influenced by the premature death of his great-uncle, Richard Gilpin (born 1664)“from a blow of his schoolmaster”, he was an enlightened educationalist, instituting a system of fines rather than corporal punishment and encouraging the boys to keep gardens and in-school shops. His broad intention was to promote &quot;uprightness and utility&quot; and give his pupils &quot;a miniature of the world they were afterwards to enter.&quot;

As an educator, he has been compared to his contemporary, David Manson, who in his grammar school in Belfast sought to exclude &quot;drudgery and fear&quot; through the use of play, outdoor activity and peer tutoring. Like Manson, Gilpin appears to have foreshadowed some of the experiments usually ascribed to the school of educationalists inspired by Rousseau, but there is no evidence that he (or Manson) was influenced by Continental theorists.

Gilpin stayed at Cheam until 1777, when he moved with his wife Margaret to become Vicar of Boldre in the New Forest, Hampshire. While there he took as a child pupil the future poet Caroline Anne Bowles. Another pupil was his nephew, the painter William Sawrey Gilpin. He was succeeded at Cheam by his second son, another William Gilpin (1757-1848, headmaster 1777–1805)

William Gilpin died at Boldre, Hampshire, on 5 April 1804 and was buried there on 13 April. He was survived by his wife, Margaret (1725 – 14 July 1807), to whom he was married for over 50 years. His older son, John Bernard (1754-1851) became British Consul for Rhode Island. His two daughters, both Margaret, died in infancy (1756 &amp; 1759).

==Picturesque==

In 1768 Gilpin published a popular &quot;Essay on Prints&quot;, where he defined the picturesque as &quot;that kind of beauty which is agreeable in a picture&quot; and began to expound his &quot;principles of picturesque beauty&quot;, based largely on his knowledge of landscape painting. During the late 1760s and 1770s, Gilpin travelled extensively in the summer holidays and applied his principles to the landscapes he saw, committing his thoughts and spontaneous sketches to notebooks.
Gilpin&#x27;s tour journals circulated in manuscript to friends such as the poet William Mason and a wider circle including Thomas Gray, Horace Walpole and King George III. In 1782, at Mason&#x27;s instigation, Gilpin published &quot;Observations on the River Wye and several parts of South Wales, etc. relative chiefly to Picturesque Beauty; made in the summer of the year 1770&quot; (London 1782). This was illustrated with plates based on Gilpin&#x27;s sketches, etched by his nephew William Sawrey Gilpin using the newly invented aquatint process. There followed &quot;Observations&quot; on the Lake District and the West of England, and after his move to Boldre, &quot;Remarks on Forest Scenery, and other woodland Views...&quot; (London, 1791).

Gilpin&#x27;s watercolour technique has been compared with that of Alexander Cozens. Both texture and composition were important in a &quot;correctly picturesque&quot; scene. The texture should be &quot;rough&quot;, &quot;intricate&quot;, &quot;varied&quot; or &quot;broken&quot;, without obvious straight lines. The composition should work as a unified whole, incorporating several elements: a dark &quot;foreground&quot; with a &quot;front screen&quot; or &quot;side screens&quot;, a brighter middle &quot;distance&quot;, and at least one further, less distinctly depicted &quot;distance&quot;. A ruined abbey or castle would add &quot;consequence&quot;. A low viewpoint that tended to emphasise the &quot;sublime&quot; was always preferable to a prospect from on high. While Gilpin allowed that nature was good at producing textures and colours, he saw it as rarely capable of creating the perfect composition. Some extra help from the artist, perhaps a carefully placed tree, was usually required.

Unlike other travel writers of his time such as Thomas Pennant, Gilpin included little history and few facts or anecdotes. Even Gilpin&#x27;s descriptions can seem quite vague, concentrating on how scenery conformed to picturesque principles rather than its specifics. In a much-quoted passage, Gilpin took things to an extreme, suggesting that &quot;a mallet judiciously used&quot; might render the insufficiently ruinous gable of Tintern Abbey more picturesque. In the same work he criticised John Dyer&#x27;s description of the view from Grongar Hill for giving a distant object too much detail. Such passages were easy pickings for satirists such as Jane Austen, as she showed in &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; and other novels and works. (Elizabeth Bennet, in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, notably refuses to join Mr. Darcy and the Bingley sisters in a stroll with the teasing observation, &quot;You are charmingly group&#x27;d, and... the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.&quot;)

Although he came in for criticism, Gilpin had published at exactly the right time. Improved road communications and travel restrictions in continental Europe produced a burst of British domestic tourism in the 1780s and 1790s. Many such &quot;picturesque&quot; tourists were intent on sketching, or at least discussing what they saw in terms of landscape painting. Gilpin&#x27;s works were the ideal companions for the new generation of travellers; they were written specifically for them and not intended as comprehensive travel guides.

==Legacy==

Although Gilpin sometimes commented on designed landscapes, the picturesque remained for him an essential set of rules for depicting nature. It was left to others, notably Richard Payne Knight, Uvedale Price and Thomas Johnes, to develop Gilpin&#x27;s ideas into more comprehensive theories of the picturesque and apply these more generally to landscape design and architecture. Ultimately, these grand theories of wild natural beauty gave way to the tamer, more commercialised picturesque of the mid-19th century, though Gilpin&#x27;s works remained popular and several new editions appeared with additions by John Heaviside Clark.

Gilpin also lives on as the model for the satirist William Combe&#x27;s clever but cruel &quot;Tour of Dr Syntax in Search of the Picturesque&quot; (1809), brilliantly illustrated by Thomas Rowlandson. This poor curate sets off on his straggly mare Grizzle in a quest for picturesque scenery, often (and usually to his discomfort) oblivious to the realities of the world around him.

As well as his &quot;picturesque&quot; writing, Gilpin published several works on moral and religious subjects, including biographies of Hugh Latimer, Thomas Cranmer and John Wycliffe. Some of the profit from his writing went on good works in his parish, including the endowment of a school at Boldre that now bears his name. Many of the manuscripts of his tours, including unpublished or recently published material, are now housed in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

Gilpin is one of eight travellers included in Nicholas Crane&#x27;s &quot;Great British Journeys&quot;.

<text>&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam, who became known as &quot;Monty Python&quot;, for BBC1. The series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags and observational sketches without punchlines. Live action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. It premiered on 5 October 1969 and ended on 5 December 1974, with a total of 45 episodes over the course of 4 series.

<text>Lewis &quot;Scan&quot; Tester (7 September 1887 – May 1972) was an English folk and English country musician.

==Overview==
Lewis Tester was born in Chelwood Gate, near Horsted Keynes, Sussex, England. At about the age of five he acquired the nickname &quot;scantelope&quot;. There are several variants on the story, but his immediate family used the name &quot;Scan&quot; and he used it when advertising himself as a musician. He spent most of life in the area north of Brighton, playing Anglo concertina, bandoneon, melodeon and fiddle. He occasionally sang. Both his older brother, Trayton and a younger brother, Will played concertina. He lied about his age in order to be able to leave school early and earn money for his family. Parish records of the school suggest he was born in 1887, but he claimed it was 1886. At his father&#x27;s pub, the Green Man at Horsted Keynes he learned step-dancing. He danced and played at weddings, harvest suppers and pubs with his elder brother and other local musicians.

==Gypsies and jazz==
When visiting the hop fields of Kent he earned more money from playing concertina and dancing than he could have earned by pulling hops. There would be contests for dancing in the hop fields, including gypsy dancers, and he generally won the prize - a gallon of beer. After the First World War he formed a &quot;jazz band&quot; - that is a country dance band that included a full drum kit. It was called Tester&#x27;s Imperial Band. He hired rooms and taught the dances - quadrilles, schottisches, polkas, and the like - before the dance started. His brother Trayton, brought a bandoneon back from Germany after the First World War. It was an oversized concertina, with a full deep sound, excellent for un-amplified playing. By the 1950s the instrument was no longer manufactured. For over forty years, Tester played at the Stone Quarry pub at Chelwood Gate. He was one of the last to play the old-time tunes.

==An elderly celebrity==
Reg Hall was active in the 1950s, collecting tunes and encouraging traditional musicians. Hall met Tester in 1957, after Mervyn Plunkett discovered Tester and brought him to the attention of Hall. Soon he was brought to the headquarters of the English Folk Dance and Song Society at Cecil Sharp House in London. Tester went on to play at the Royal Festival Hall and big hotels. Hall collected his recordings which were issued as &quot;I Never Played to Many Posh Dances - Scan Tester 1887 - 1972&quot;. Hall&#x27;s association with Tester was already documented in his &quot;I never played to many posh dances&quot;. The album had forty eight tracks with fifty one tunes. They were not made in the recording studio. However they did capture a style that was nearly lost altogether. Hall ran a folk club at The Fox in Islington, London, and frequently invited Tester to play there. When Rod Stradling heard him play, he was inspired to form a series of bands to play the old style music. Of these, the Old Swan Band still thrives.

The accompanying book to the Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot; has a picture of Scan with Reg Hall on the cover and &quot;Jenny Lind&quot; played with Rabbidy Baxter from the album &quot;Boscastle Breakdown&quot; is track ten of the seventh CD in the set.

Tester&#x27;s death was reported in the &quot;Mid Sussex Times&quot; on 11 May 1972.

<text>Sligo Rovers Football Club is an Irish professional football club playing in the Premier Division of the League of Ireland. The club is based in Sligo in the west of Ireland.

The club was founded in 1928 and have been in the League of Ireland since 1934. The club is a co-operative venture, owned by the people of Sligo. Rovers have played at The Showgrounds since their inception. In 2013, they won a third FAI Cup in four years, and also became the 2012 Premier Division Champions, winning the league with two games to spare. In total, they have won three league titles, five FAI Cups and two League Cups.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Sligo Rovers Football Club was formed on 17 September 1928 as a result of an amalgamation of two junior sides, Sligo Town and Sligo Blues. Their first game was a 9–1 victory against Ballyshannon, a team from County Donegal in Ulster, on 23 September 1928 in the qualifying round of the Connacht Cup. The club, elected to the League of Ireland in 1934, hails from Sligo and play their home matches at the Showgrounds and have done so ever since their inception. The home colours are red with white sleeve uppers, with red shorts and socks while the away colours are white with black sides, white shorts and socks. The third alternative kit is navy with red sleeve uppers, navy shorts and navy socks with a red upper part.

===1928–1940: Early success===
The club started well by winning the FAI Junior Cup in their first season, beating Grangegorman in the final at the Showgrounds 3–0. The following season also brought silverware in the shape of the Connacht Junior Cup with Rovers beating Galway in the final 1–0 after a replay. At the beginning of the 1931–32 season the club successfully applied to join the Dublin-based Sunday Alliance League and won their first game at this level by beating Windy Arbour 4–2 at the Showgrounds and went on to win the league, finishing four points ahead of Westland Sligo. After this success the club moved up another level the following season by joining the Leinster Senior League and played their first game away to UCD in August 1932 and won 4–2. The club performed well in their first season at this level eventually finishing third as Brideville won the league. This season also saw The Bit O&#x27; Red make their first appearance in the FAI Cup, winning in the first round against Brideville 3–1 before going out to Shelbourne in the next round 5–2. The next year, the club won the Leinster Senior League in only their second year at this level by beating Distillery in a play-off at Tolka Park 3–2 after the teams had finished the league level on points. The team also won the Intermediate Cup, winning 5–1 against Waterford side Tramore Rookies in the final at Dalymount Park, as well as the Metropolitan Cup, beating Queens Park 3–0 in the final at Tolka Park to secure a remarkable treble for the young club.

Following this achievement the club was elected to the Free State League on 28 June 1934 along with Waterford as both Shelbourne and Cork Bohemians resigned from the league. Scotsman Bob Preston, ex-Heart of Midlothian, Plymouth Argyle and Torquay United player, managed the team in their first season at the highest level of Irish football with the first game being a 3–1 defeat in the Shield at the Iveagh Grounds in Dublin against St. James Gate. Tommy Callaghan scored Rovers&#x27; goal. The team finished third in that season with Gerry McDaid finishing as top scorer. During this season local Paddy Monaghan won two caps for the Irish national team and is still the only man to have achieved this while at the club.

The 1936–37 season began in spectacular fashion with Sligo winning their first 11 games and they clinched their first league title by beating Cork 4–3 with two games of the season remaining. Trainer and captain that year was Jimmy Surgeoner in his only season at the club. Top scorer was Englishman Harry Litherland whose record of 19 league goals that season was surpassed by Eoin Doyle in 2011 season scoring 20 league goals. The club also won the Dublin City Cup this year beating Dundalk in the final. Two years later, in 1939, the club reached their first FAI Cup final by beating Dundalk 2–1 in the semi-final. A crowd of 30,601 went to Dalymount Park to see Rovers take on Shelbourne in the final which ended in a 1–1 draw. The replay was held at Dalymount Park 10 days later on 3 May with 28,369 in attendance to see the Dublin side record a 1–0 victory thanks to an early goal. The club were also runners-up in the league that year finishing nine points behind winners Shamrock Rovers making it another good season for the club.

The following season once again saw the club come close to winning a trophy on two occasions. First was a 3–2 defeat to Bohs in a play-off for the shield after the two sides finished level on points. Also that year the club reached its second consecutive FAI Cup final with Shamrock Rovers providing the opposition in front of a crowd of 38,500 on 21 April. Unfortunately for Rovers, it was Shams who ran out 3–0 winners. Despite this success the club decided that because of The Emergency the club could no longer compete in the league and withdrew from football.

===Dixie Dean===
Before the cup campaign of 1939 the club&#x27;s committee decided they needed a big name to fill the vacant centre-forward position. They got in touch with some contacts in England, one of whom was the manager of Everton who suggested that Dixie Dean, who was at Notts County at the time, could be available. Although coming to the end of his career Dean was still one of the biggest names in football due to his goalscoring feats during his time at Everton where he is still the club&#x27;s all-time leading scorer and also holds the record for having scored the highest number of league goals in a single season – 60 in 1927–28. Despite rejecting Rovers&#x27; initial offer the club&#x27;s improved second offer was accepted by Dean and a massive coup was pulled off by the club. A huge crowd turned up at Sligo Railway Station to give Dean a hero&#x27;s welcome. Dean duly scored on his debut, a game against Shelbourne in the Showgrounds on 29 January and went on to score nine more in his seven league appearances for the club, including five in a single game against Waterford. He also scored in the FAI cup final of that year in the 1–1 draw with Shelbourne though the replay would be lost 1–0. Dean&#x27;s runners-up medal was stolen after the game but he did however have it returned to him seven years later when he was back in England. Dean returned to Ireland in 1978 to see Sligo Rovers play in the FAI Cup final of that year.

===1948–1976: Return to football and trophyless years===
Following the end of the war Rovers began attempts to return to the league. In 1945 the club couldn&#x27;t raise sufficient funds to facilitate this and the following year improvement works at the Showgrounds delayed the return by another year. In 1947 Rovers applied to rejoin the league but were unsuccessful as the league decided to maintain its structure of eight teams. A year later and the club were this time successful and were readmitted to the league along with Transport for the 1948–49 season. After two quiet seasons Rovers were once again challenging for honours, this time going close to winning the league title. Going into the final game of the season against Transport, Rovers needed a win to finish level on points with Cork Athletic and force a play-off but they could only draw 0–0 and finished second, a point behind Athletic. The Cork side also denied Rovers in the FAI Cup knocking them out 2–0 at the semi-final stage. At the beginning of the next season the club signed Scottish forward Johnny Armstrong who would go on to stay with the club for several years and become the all-time leading goalscorer.

The next few seasons saw Rovers finish around mid-table. On 6 March 1955 one of the most famous games the Showgrounds has seen took place when Rovers were drawn to face Shamrock Rovers in the FAI Cup. Before the match Rovers announced that they had signed Austrian International Albert Straka to play in the game and this attracted much attention resulting in a crowd of over 7,000. In the final minute with Rovers 2–1 down a penalty was awarded and up stepped Straka to equalise and create jubilant scenes. Rovers would go on to lose the replay. Rovers finished the 1956–57 season in third place however it would be another nine seasons before they would finish inside the top three again. The slump began in the 1957–58 season with the club finishing in the bottom two and therefore having to apply for re-election for the first time. During the next few years Rovers struggled on the pitch as well as off it with persistent financial difficulties blighting the club. This came to a head at the end of the 1961–62 season when the decision was made to cut the league from 12 clubs to 10. With Rovers having finished bottom for the last two seasons they, along with Transport, were dismissed from the league despite the club making an appeal to the FAI.

The absence would only last one year however, when the decision was made to bring the league&#x27;s numbers back up to 12, Rovers were re-admitted along with Drogheda. The club&#x27;s fortunes improved after their return and they had three consecutive top half finishes from 1965 to 1967, a feat not matched until 2008 and they also reached an FAI Cup semi-final in 1966 but lost to Limerick after a replay. A significant achievement was made in 1968 when Rovers were able to take full ownership of the Showgrounds, which enabled them to begin work on improving facilities at the venue. One of the worst moments of the club&#x27;s history occurred in 1969 when the club were beaten by non-league opposition in the FAI Cup for the first time as Longford Town won 2–0 in Longford. Rovers fared better in the cup the following year as they reached their first final in 30 years where they faced Bohs. After the first two games ended scoreless Bohs came out on top in the second replay winning 2–1 despite Johnny Cooke giving Rovers the lead. The following years saw Rovers struggle towards the bottom end of the table, and they had to apply for re-election on two occasions as financial constraints forced the club to adopt a part-time policy. Rovers reached their first League Cup final but lost 4–1 over two legs to Limerick.

===1977–1985: Second league title and first FAI Cup===
The 1976–77 season would be one of the most successful in the club&#x27;s history as the club won its first league title for 40 years and its second ever. Manager Billy Sinclair assembled a talented squad with a mix of local and British talent that pipped Bohs to the title by a point with the title being clinched with a famous 3–1 victory over Shamrock Rovers at the Showgrounds on Easter Sunday. In the squad that year was goalkeeper Alan Paterson; defenders McManus, Sinclair, Fox (captain), Rutherford, Stenson; midfielders Fagan, Fielding, McGee, Betts, Ferry, Walker and forwards Leonard and Hulmes. The club also reached their second successive League Cup final but lost 1–0 to Shamrock Rovers. Sligo native Paul &#x27;Ski&#x27; McGee played a big part in the title win and was transferred to English side QPR at the end of the season and would go on to have a successful time in England as well as earning 16 caps for the Ireland national side. The league win gave Rovers their first opportunity to play in Europe and they were drawn to play Red Star Belgrade of Yugoslavia in the first round of the European Cup. They would lose both legs 3–0.

The next season saw another cup run for Rovers as they reached the final of the FAI Cup again and this time Shamrock Rovers, managed by Irish football legend Johnny Giles, were their opponents. A controversial penalty scored by Ray Treacy gave the Dublin side a 1–0 win and prolonged Rovers search for their first FAI Cup. After one more season manager Billy Sinclair announced his departure and he would eventually be replaced by ex-Finn Harps manager Patsy McGowan who brought with him several players from the Donegal side. This included Brendan Bradley the league&#x27;s all-time top scorer. In his second season at the club McGowan led Rovers to their fifth FAI Cup final where they this time met Dundalk. A 2–0 defeat left many wondering would Rovers ever get their hands on the famous trophy. At the end of the following season when Rovers finished in 5th position McGowan left to return to Finn Harps. He would be replaced by long-serving player Paul Fielding.

With financial difficulties persisting the club finished towards the bottom of the table however the 1983 season will always be remembered at the club for the FAI Cup run of that year. Rovers made their way to the semi-finals by beating Shamrock Rovers and were drawn to face junior side Cobh Ramblers in what looked to be a straightforward tie. However it took a late equaliser for Rovers to force the first game to a replay and in that Cobh came from two down to force a second replay back at Flower Lodge which saw another draw. Rovers eventually came out on top in the third replay, despite going two down, to book their place in the final. The tie earned Cobh the respect of Rovers and the Irish footballing public. A week later, on 24 April, Rovers were facing Bohs in the cup final at a rain-soaked Dalymount Park. Bohs took the lead in the first half and it was looking like Rovers would lose their sixth cup final. However an equaliser from Tony Stenson brought Rovers back into it and a lob by local winger Harry McLoughlin won it for Rovers. The final result of 2–1 meant that club captain and long-serving local hero Tony Fagan could finally get his hands on the FAI Cup for the club 50 years after the club first entered it. Huge celebrations were had in Sligo following the victory. The following season Rovers were in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup but lost to Finnish side FC Haka 1–0 and 3–0.

===1986–1993: Moving between divisions===
For the 1985–86 season the league expanded to incorporate a First Division as well as the Premier. This meant the bottom four sides would be relegated. By this stage most of the Cup winning side had moved on and manager Paul Fielding had been replaced by Gerry Mitchell, with financial difficulties forcing the club into having a part-time squad. Despite Rovers coming from three down on the final day of the season to draw 3–3 with Drogheda it wasn&#x27;t enough and Rovers were relegated on goal difference. Rovers bounced back the following year with Gerry Mitchell still in charge and much of the previous season&#x27;s squad still there they finished runners-up behind Bray Wanderers which was enough to secure their way back to the Premier Division. At the end of this season, an Extraordinary General Meeting was held where the decision was made to structure the club as a co-op, and that structure is still in existence today. Back in the Premier, Rovers managed to stay up and also had a run to the semi-finals of the FAI Cup where they were defeated by Shamrock Rovers. The next season was a poor one with Rovers finishing bottom and never looking capable of survival which meant a return to First Division football for the 1988–89 season. Things were to get even worse the following year with David Pugh replacing Mitchell as manager and an all local policy the club finished bottom of the First Division in what is still their worst ever finish.

Things were to improve dramatically the following year under new manager Dermot Keely, who was able to bring in some experienced players from Dublin. A 1–1 draw with Kilkenny City on the final day was enough to secure promotion back to the top flight. Although beaten by Waterford United in a play-off for the title the club were back in the Premier Division for the 1990–91 season. After finishing in a respectable mid-table position upon their return Rovers were back fighting relegation the following year, although they did survive courtesy of loanee Colin Cameron&#x27;s hat-trick on the final day of the season in Drogheda. Keely resigned after the first three games of the following season which led to Rovers appointing Willie McStay as manager but he couldn&#x27;t keep them up and Rovers returned to the First Division for the 1993–94 season.

===1994–2000: Treble win and European exploits===
Despite this 1994 proved to be one of the most successful of the club&#x27;s history under the popular Scot. The first trophy was won early in the season in the First Division Shield with Waterford United being beaten 2–1 over two legs. Another addition that year was the installation of floodlights at the historic Showgrounds. Rovers began with a 4–0 over Home Farm. With three games to spare, promotion was guaranteed with a 2–0 away win over Athlone Town, with the First Division title secured with a 1–0 home win over Bray Wanderers. The club&#x27;s best day of the season was set up by Eddie Annand&#x27;s winning goal in the FAI Cup semi-final over Limerick at the Showgrounds. The final against Premier Division Derry City was fixed for 15 May at Lansdowne Road on what proved to be another wet day. The game was won by Gerry Carr&#x27;s header and captain Gavin Dykes lifted the trophy. McStay left at the end of the season to return to Celtic and he would be replaced by Wimbledon cup final hero Lawrie Sanchez but only after caretaker Chris Rutherford had guided Rovers to their first European win, beating Maltese side Floriana 3–2 on aggregate in the Cup Winners&#x27; cup. Padraig Moran, one of the club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorers, scored Rovers&#x27; first European goal. The next round pitted Rovers against big name opposition in the shape of Belgian side Club Brugge. Despite Johnny Kenny&#x27;s goal in the first leg Rovers lost 2–1 at the Showgrounds and then 3–1 in the return leg.

At one stage of the 1994–95 season, Rovers were contending for the title but a bad run at the end of the season, largely due to a backlog of fixtures, meant they eventually finished 8th. Rovers put up a good defence of the cup but Shelbourne&#x27;s 3–1 win at the Showgrounds ended their hopes. Sanchez would leave the club at the end of the season to return to England but his replacement and former Wimbledon team-mate Steve Cotterill continued the success of recent seasons. He guided them to their first League cup final since 1977. Despite a 1–0 home win in the first leg of the final and going one up in the second opponents Shelbourne fought back and a last minute equaliser forced a penalty shoot-out which Shelbourne were to win. Another run in the cup was also enjoyed but Shelbourne were to prove Rovers nemesis again, beating Rovers at the Showgrounds 1–0. A strong league campaign ended with Rovers finishing in third, their highest position since the league winning year of 1977, and that qualified Rovers for the Intertoto Cup. Rovers did well in Europe again recording draws at home to Nantes and Heerenveen but away defeats of Lillestrøm and Kaunas meant Rovers failed to progress beyond the group stages.

Shortly after, Cotterill departed the club and was replaced by former Burnley manager Jimmy Mullen who, despite guiding Rovers to a mid-table finish, left Rovers at the end of the year. His replacement was player-manager Nicky Reid, a former Man City defender. Rovers gained revenge for their defeat to Shelbourne in the League Cup two years earlier by beating them in the final for Rovers&#x27; first win in the competition. The next season was not as successful with Rovers needing a fantastic run at the end of the season to stay up by a single point. With Reid now replaced by Scot Jim McInally the trick could not be repeated the next year and the club lost their Premier division status finishing second from bottom but eight points from safety.

===2000–2005: Dark days in the First Division===
Rovers began life in the First Division under former Northern Ireland manager Tommy Cassidy who had come to the club before relegation but too late to save the club. The club maintained its full-time policy in the First Division in a bid to go straight back up but despite challenging up until the final day of the season they missed out on a play-off spot by two points. This resulted in the departure of Cassidy who was replaced by former Torquay United and Galway United manager Don O&#x27;Riordan who due to financial constraints was forced to blood several local youngsters. One of these was Keith Gilroy who was transferred to Middlesbrough. Results were poor however under O&#x27;Riordan with the side finishing in 6th place for three successive years without challenging for promotion. During this period the league made the switch to summer soccer, but for Rovers it proved to be one of the darkest periods in its history. With the club again not challenging for promotion in O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s fourth year he was eventually sacked and replaced towards the end of that year by untried Northern Irishman Sean Connor. He quickly set about building a much stronger squad from all parts of the world and the club found themselves towards the top of the league throughout the 2005 season with promotion being clinched with a scoreless home draw with Athlone Town on 12 November to end the years of misery in the division often referred to as the graveyard.

===2006–2011: Return to the Premier Division and cup successes===
Connor continued to inspire Rovers to success on their return to the Premier Division and they finished fifth that year. The club also enjoyed its first significant cup run in a decade and faced Derry City in a home semi-final which finished all square in front of one of the biggest crowds the Showgrounds had seen for a long time. The replay would prove to be a disaster, however, with Rovers losing 5–0 on 31 October 2006 in the Brandywell. Shortly after Connor stunned the club by announcing his departure to join Bohs before the season had even ended. His departure left a lot of resentment towards him in Sligo which remains to this day. His replacement, Rob McDonald, a former PSV Eindhoven player would only last one game in charge, that being the final game of the 2006 season. He was sacked only a couple of weeks before the new season was to begin which left Rovers in the temporary control of caretakers Leo Tierney and Dessie Cawley as the new season began until a new man could be appointed.

That man was former Coventry City and Wigan Athletic scouser Paul Cook. He immediately got the team playing an attractive brand of passing football and despite all the turmoil steered the side to a respectable 6th place in the 12 team league. The club would build on this the following year by finishing in fourth position and thereby qualifying Rovers for Europe for the first time in 12 years. At the end of that season Rovers sold right-back Seamus Coleman to English Premiership side Everton for £60,000. Coleman made his debut under Sean Connor and the Killybegs man quickly established himself as one of the most exciting players in the league thanks to his quality dribbling skills up the right wing. Coleman has since established himself as a regular in the first-team at Everton. He has gone on to win caps for the Ireland national team and was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the year in 2011. The European campaign proved to be a disappointment, however, with Rovers going out to Albanian side KS Vllaznia Shkodër 3–2 on aggregate in their first game. Despite the club failing to compete as high up the league as the previous year, eventually finishing 6th, the club performed much better in the cup and knocked out Derry City, Cork City and Bohs before then beating Waterford 1–0 in the semi-final at the Showgrounds to book their place in the first FAI Cup final for 15 years courtesy of Matthew Blinkhorn&#x27;s header. The final was played at Tallaght Stadium against big spending new First Division side Sporting Fingal and despite Eoin Doyle giving Rovers the lead early in the second half, Fingal came back with two late goals.

The following season would see Rovers go on to surpass its recent success. Rovers picked up their first piece of silverware by winning the EA Sports Cup with a 1–0 win over surprise finalists Monaghan United. Matthew Blinkhorn scored the winning goal. The goalscoring feats of Pádraig Amond resulted in his sale to Portuguese side Paços de Ferreira during the season. The club also performed well in the league with a run during the second half of the season enough to leave them in third place, their joint highest since winning it in 1977, only four points from being champions. This also guaranteed a return to European football for the next year. The highlight of the year however would be in the final game of the season, the 2010 FAI Cup Final.

On 14 November 2010, the FAI Cup Final took place in the new Aviva Stadium. Sligo Rovers and Shamrock Rovers drew 0–0 before Sligo won on penalties. The Sligo second choice keeper, Ciarán Kelly, saved four penalties in the shootout. Joseph Ndo won the Man of the Match.

The 2011 season was also a huge success for the club. Paul Cook guided Rovers to second place in the Airtricity League, with a record number of points and record number of goals scored. 15 of these came in two games against Galway United, 8–0 away and 7–1 at home. Despite the club going out of the Europa League to Ukrainians Vorskla Poltava, Rovers reached the semi-finals of the EA Sports Cup, and made it to the final of the FAI Ford Cup for a third successive season, this time against Shelbourne. Paul Cook&#x27;s efforts saw him linked to the vacant position at SPL side St Johnstone, but failed to agree terms with them. After John Coleman was appointed Rochdale manager, Accrington Stanley were granted permission to speak to Cook but talks broke down. However, 2 days later Rovers and Accrington agreed compensation for Cook and on 13 February 2012 Cook was appointed manager two weeks before the Airtricity League began.

===2012–2013: A third league title and more cup success===
On 27 February 2012, former Scunthorpe United boss Ian Baraclough was named Rovers new manager, describing the offer as a &quot;fantastic opportunity and I am very thankful for the offer&quot;. In his first game as manager, Rovers drew 1–1 with Shelbourne at Tolka Park. Jason McGuinness rescued a point for Baraclough&#x27;s side in the last minute. In the following game, he won his first game as manager against Glentoran 2–0 in the Setanta Cup thanks to goals from Romauld Boco and Mark Quigley.

Rovers beat reigning champions Shamrock Rovers 3–0 in the Showgrounds on 13 May 2012 to open up an 8-point gap between themselves and 3rd placed Shamrock Rovers and a 6-point gap over second-placed St. Pats. This meant Rovers were unbeaten in the first third of the season along with 2nd placed St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic — the first time two sides have achieved this in the same season since the 1980–81 season.

Rovers came unstuck in their Europa League adventure, against Slovaks FC Spartak Trnava losing 3–1 in Slovakia in the first leg, but recovered and obtained a creditable 1–1 draw in the second leg. However Rovers loosened their grip on the FAI Cup losing 3–1 at home to Monaghan United F.C. who later resigned from the league. Another setback occurred during the Spartak Trnava tie when top-scorer Danny North&#x27;s injury meant he would miss the remainder of the season. However other players particularly Mark Quigley took on the goalscoring responsibilities and Rovers also remained solid defensively. During this period Rovers thrashed rivals Drogheda United 4–1 at the Showgrounds and drew away to the other chasers St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic and Shamrock Rovers.

The unbeaten league run meant Rovers could win the title with two games to spare if they beat second placed St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic at the Showgrounds. The game became like a cup final with extra seating installed to meet demand and it looked good when Rovers went 2–0 ahead by the middle of the first half. St. Pats needed a win to keep their own aspirations alive and after a half time reshuffle they soon levelled the game at 2–2 with most of the second half remaining. Rovers were still determined to clinch the title that day and pressed on after this eventually winning a late penalty that Mark Quigley converted followed minutes later by the final whistle and celebrations as the ecstatic supporters rushed onto the pitch. Sligo Rovers had won their third league title.

Despite being champions Rovers lost two of their big names, Mark Quigley and Jason McGuinness to Shamrock Rovers before the start of the 2013 season, bringing in Bohemians defender Evan McMillan and re-signing Aaron Greene as replacements. Recruits from the UK were also brought in such as wide midfielder Kieran Djilali and much traveled center-forward Anthony Elding who made a prolific start to his Rovers career as the defending champions won their opening eight games. After that run was ended a spell of games shortly after saw Elding and Rovers struggle to score and slip away from the top of the table. With the Champions League tie looming Baraclough signed striker David McMillan from UCD to try and bolster the attack but he failed to make an impact and struggled to get a game after North&#x27;s return from injury.

The Bit O&#x27;Red&#x27;s Champions League tie was against strong Norwegian champions Molde FK. Sligo narrowly lost the home leg giving Molde the edge they never let slip. After this Rovers tried to resurrect their title bid but defeats against surprise contenders Dundalk and home draws meant that in almost a mirror image of the previous season St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic won the title after beating Sligo with 2 games to spare.

This season however saw Sligo resurrect their FAI cup form and they followed up an away win at Waterford United with 1–0 victories over Cork City and Derry City. The semi final against Shamrock Rovers saw the highlight of the season so far as Sligo Rovers comfortably won 3–0. Rovers would face Drogheda United who had knocked them out of the Setanta Cup and a sluggish first half saw the Louth men go a goal up. With fifteen minutes to go they still trailed but suddenly the whole game came to life as substitute Danny North equalized and a few minutes later gave Sligo the lead with a goal from a clever but controversial free kick routine. The protests over the goal led to a Drogheda player getting sent off but Sligo were also reduced to ten men as Gavin Peers was forced off with injury after all the substitutions had been made. Drogheda took advantage of this to equalize and another Sligo Rovers cup final looked on its way to extra time. However, with injury time running out Danny North turned provider setting up Anthony Elding for a great finish and a third FAI Cup for Sligo Rovers in four seasons.

===2014–2019: End of glory days and survival battles===
The 2014 season started badly when, after a narrow opening day win, Rovers lost four in a row. A pick up in form saw them beat Dundalk in the final Setanta Cup final but the same opposition soon thrashed Rovers 3–0 twice in two weeks including the FAI cup. Further poor league results led to the decision to sack Ian Baraclough. Sligo Rovers quickly found a replacement from North West England in John Coleman and he oversaw Sligo&#x27;s second European success when they defeated FK Banga of Lithuania 4–0. This was twenty years after their first success and Sligo followed this with a shock 2–1 away first-leg win at Rosenborg. They then took the lead in the second leg but Rosenborg, who had changed managers after the first leg, bounced back to win 3–1. After the European adventure ended, the downward spiral continued with players including Joseph N&#x27;Do being let go to reduce the wage bill. Come September, Coleman also left to manage Accrington Stanley leaving Gavin Dykes as caretaker where he only managed four points in their last eight games. However, before the season&#x27;s end, the club had arranged for Owen Heary of Bohemians to become manager for 2015.

Owen Heary bolstered the squad with promising former Bohs players but they struggled only getting 2 victories in 13 games. Heary was dismissed but only after a period in limbo where the club were hoping he&#x27;d just resign. He was replaced initially by Joseph N&#x27;Do but after he lost at bottom club Limerick F.C. they hired a former English Premier league manager Micky Adams who kept them safe with a victory in the penultimate game at St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic.

With Micky Adams not staying on, the 2016 season saw Rovers hire former Peterborough Utd manager Dave Robertson. His first season veered between surprise wins at Cork City and champions Dundalk to bad defeats against Bray and a FAI cup exit at struggling Wexford Youths, where Rovers had won 5–0 two weeks prior. Still this season was the more encouraging of this period and a top half finish saw them become one of the first League of Ireland clubs invited to take part in the Scottish League Challenge cup. A bad opening day defeat in the 2017 season and resultant poor form led to Robertson&#x27;s sacking. Three sides would be automatically relegated as the Premier Division was being reduced to ten teams and this hastened the dismissal. Irish League manager Gerard Lyttle was hired but struggled to move the club out of the relegation zone. The turning point came in a televised August success at runaway leaders Cork City with more victories following, though safety was only assured on the final day of the season.

Much of the 2018 season yet again saw Sligo Rovers flirting with relegation assisted by poor home form as any stand out victories came away from home. When safety was assured, with two weekends to spare, the club still decided to dismiss Gerard Lyttle and waited for the season&#x27;s end to confirm that Liam Buckley would take charge after his departure from St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic. Sligo finished the 2019 campaign in seventh place, comfortably above the relegation places. Liam Buckley&#x27;s appointment in 2019 proved to be somewhat of a turning point within the club, with Rovers reaching the semi-finals of the FAI Cup in 2019, losing to Dundalk at the Showgrounds.

===2020–present: European ventures and league stability===

Liam Buckley&#x27;s appointment at the club was a huge turning point at Sligo Rovers, avoiding relegation in 2019 and earning his way to a cup semi final V Dundalk (listed above).

The 2020 season proved to be Rovers&#x27; best since 2013, finishing in fourth place and ending the season in a European spot, which meant they were to partake in the inaugural UEFA Conference League qualifiers in mid-2021. Buckley&#x27;s men also put together somewhat of a cup run, beating Derry City 3–1 on penalties in the FAI Cup Quarter-finals at the Showgrounds, fighting their way to a semi-final bout away to Shams (Shamrock Rovers). Rovers lost 2–0 in a COVID-19 restricted Tallaght stadium, ending their cup run.

The good form continued in 2021, with the bit o&#x27; red flying high in the first few months of league competition, leading up to their UEFA Europa Conference League game against Icelandic opposition, Fimleikafélag Hafnarfjarðar. Sligo Rovers lost the away leg 1–0 on 8 July, and disappointingly lost the covid-restricted home leg 2-1 a week later, with the only Rovers goal being a Johnny Kenny penalty. The league form dropped massively after Sligo were knocked out of Europe, as they failed to win in 5 straight games, and were also beaten by first division side Cork City FC in the first round of the FAI Cup. They still however finished the domestic season in third place, solidifying a European return in 2022.

Rovers started off 2022 well, with an away win against St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic, followed by two consecutive 0-0 draws, and two back to back wins, the latter being a win at home to Finn Harps, when Aidan Keena bagged his first professional hattrick. After an 2-2 thriller away to south dublin rivals Shamrock Rovers, the bit o&#x27; red&#x27;s league form dipped, with two consecutive home losses against Shelbourne FC and Bohemians respectively. After a bad string of results, collecting just 8 points out of an available 27, manager Liam Buckley was sacked, and former Rovers midfielder John Russell took the reins. His first game as interim manager proved a success, with Rovers beating second placed side Derry City 2–1 in the Showgrounds, with Seamus Keogh scoring an injury time winner for Rovers. Subsequently, on 2 June 2022, Russell was named the manager of the club on a permanent basis. European football soon followed with Rovers being drawn against Welsh outfit, Bala Town F.C.. Come 7 July, Sligo Rovers won the away leg 2–1, with goals from Aidan Keena and Max Mata respectively. Rovers hosted the Welsh side 7 days later on 14 July 2022 in the Showgrounds, losing 1–0 in 120 minutes, with the game finishing 2–2 on aggregate. The result was to be decided on penalties, with Edward McGinty making the crucial save to give Rovers the win and help them advance to the second round of qualifying. Sligo Rovers were then drawn to take on SPFL side Motherwell FC in the second qualifying round, a fixture Sligo people looked upon with weariness and excitement. To add to Rovers&#x27; misfortune, star keeper Edward McGinty completed a transfer to Oxford United, just hours before the match was to commence. Rovers had to rely on young goalkeeper Luke McNicholas to make his European debut. The winner of the tie was to take on Norwegian team Viking FK. Much to the surprise of the Scottish media, Rovers stunned Motherwell FC in Fir Park, beating the Scottish side 1-0 thanks to an Aidan Keena lob, capitalizing on a Bevis Mugabi defensive error. Young goalkeeper Luke McNicholas shined in his debut, making numerous important saves to deny the Steelmen. Rovers took the fixture back to the Showgrounds, easing past the Scottish minnows in a 2–0 win, which included a Shane Blaney wonderstrike of a free kick from 35 yards out, and a Max Mata goal late into injury time, securing one of the bit o&#x27; red&#x27;s most famous wins ever. This was the furthest the club had ever gotten in European competition. The European run was all but over, when on 4 August Sligo Rovers lost 5–1 away to Viking FK in Stavanger, David Cawley&#x27;s late penalty a consolation goal. The team came back to a town proud of the team, eagerly awaiting the second leg in the Showgrounds. The game was not one to be missed, with regards to the game and the atmosphere, as 3,800 people filled a packed out Showgrounds. Rovers came out on top on the day, finishing their European adventure with a 1–0 win at home to Viking FK, a Will Fitzgerald header proving the winning goal. The bit o&#x27; red would go on to finish the domestic season in 5th place, hoping for better things to come in 2023 under John Russell.

==Supporters==
Since its foundation, the club has had a small but loyal following in Sligo town, where it has been an outpost for football since its inception into the League of Ireland. Sligo Rovers currently averages gates of around 2,000. The average attendance for 2012 season was 3,007. Sligo Rovers has many supporters clubs which work on raising funds for the club, particularly the Bit O&#x27;Red Supporters Trust which has recently tried to launch some innovative fundraisers to help the club in the long term .

The Dublin Supporters Club (DSC) is another prominent supporters club, as are the South Sligo Supporters Club and the North Sligo Supporters Club, both of which take part in fundraising work within their catchment areas and regularly organise buses to Rovers games both home and away.

The most noticeable supporters group at Sligo Rovers on match days due to their visual and vocal support for Sligo Rovers is the independently formed supporters group &quot;Forza Rovers&quot; (FR08), a group of fans inspired by the ultras movement which is prominent throughout Europe. However, they have received plaudits from players and supporters for the colourful and passionate displays its members have produced since the group was formed in 2008. The group has also been involved in small fundraisers for club but the group&#x27;s main goal is to support the club with vocal and visual support on match days. Some of the choreographed displays by the group have involved all stands in the Showgrounds and have been described as &quot;extraordinary&quot; and made the Showgrounds &quot;feel like a 50,000 capacity as the teams walked out to massive noise&quot;. Sligo Rovers is the subject of a popular memoir, &quot;There&#x27;s Only One Red Army&quot; by journalist and novelist Eamonn Sweeney, published in 1997.

John and Jimmy left for Accrington Stanley F.C. in September but are returning for a friendly against Sligo Rovers.

===2012===
* Ian Baraclough managerial post ran from 27 February 2012 – 19 June 2014.

Former Scunthorpe United boss Baraclough succeeded Cook after he left for Accrington Stanley. He became boss 5 days before the 2012 Airtricity League began. The job is the 41 year old&#x27;s first since being sacked by &quot;The Iron&quot; in March 2011. Guided Sligo to their first league title since 1977, in 2012.

===2007===

* Sean Connor resigned 2 November 2006. Belfast native succeeded in getting the team promoted to the Premier Division in 2005 but left in controversial circumstances with only a few games left in the 2006 season.

===2001=== 
* Don O&#x27;Riordan came to the club after a successful period with Galway United. However, with Rovers he failed to build a side capable of challenging for promotion although he did lay the groundwork for the club&#x27;s highly successful Youth policy and he gave a number of locals their Senior debuts in the eircom League. O&#x27;Riordan and Sligo Rovers parted ways in the summer of 2004.

===1999=== 
* Tommy Cassidy had previously managed in Cyprus and Northern Ireland, could do little to reverse the slide in Rovers&#x27; fortunes following the departure of previous manager Jim McInally and they were relegated from the Premier Division. Cassidy came close to getting Rovers back up as they were in contention right up until the final day of the 2000–01 season when they lost 4–1 to Home Farm Everton.
* Jim McInally came to the Showgrounds at the start of the 1999–00 season but early results didn&#x27;t go his way and he left the club for personal reasons.
* Nicky Reid was one of Jimmy Mullen&#x27;s last signings and the former Manchester City player was asked to take charge. In his first season as player-manager, he took the club on its longest ever unbeaten run – which saw them claim the League Cup in February 1998, beating Shelbourne over two legs in the final (Reid also captained the side). His second season didn&#x27;t go as well and the club just escaped relegation from the top flight on the final day thanks to a 2–0 win against Derry City. Reid was then released from his contract and he returned to England, where he went back to university to study for a degree in Sports Rehabilitation.

* Jimmy Mullen came to the club after a good spell with Burnley but his reign at the Showgrounds was short-lived and he left the club due to family reasons in July 1997.

===1995=== 
* Steve Cotterill. Before Lawrie Sanchez left in 1995, he recommended that Sligo appoint Cotterill and that proved to be a wise decision as he led the club to third place in the Premier Division of the National League and his side also reached the League Cup final (Rovers were beaten on penalties by Shelbourne). Cotterill was then offered the position of manager of Cheltenham Town, who he brought from non-League football into the Football League winning the FA Trophy along the way.

===1994=== 
* Lawrie Sanchez. Prior to his appointment with Rovers, Sanchez was best known for scoring the winning goal for Wimbledon in the 1988 FA Cup Final against Liverpool.

===1992=== 
* Willie McStay. In two years McStay lead Rovers to an historic treble, when they won the 1993–94 First Division, First Division Shield and the FAI Cup. In 1994, the Scot left Rovers just before the start of the new season after being approached by Celtic, his former club as a player.

==The Showgrounds==
Sligo Rovers have played their entire history at the Showgrounds, located in the Maugheraboy area of Sligo town. They are one of very few League of Ireland clubs never to have changed grounds. The Showgrounds takes its name from the annual show held at the grounds by the County Sligo Agricultural Society. It is owned by the people of Sligo and cannot be sold for use for any purpose other than sport and leisure. It is one of the oldest grounds in the country but it has seen a lot of development in recent years thanks to the hard work of several volunteers.

===Treacy Avenue Stand===
Also known as the main stand this is the largest stand in the ground with 1,800 seats and also contains the dressing rooms, dugouts and press box. It was built in 2001 replacing a much older stand.

===Jinks Avenue Stand===
This is located opposite the Treacy Avenue stand has about 800 seats which were installed in the late nineties. Half of the stand is reserved for away support, while the other half contains Sligo Rovers&#x27; most vocal support known as Forza Rovers. They are renowned for their colourful and humorous displays. This stand recently also contains a TV gantry.

===Railway end===
In July 2012 a new stand was completed at the Railway End consisting of 1,300 seats. This stand is now known as the Pet Stop Stand, but was formerly known as the Volkswagen Stand as the project was funded by Volkswagen Bank.

===Shed end===
This end gets its name from the shed it used to have where Sligo Rovers&#x27; most vocal supporters would congregate until it had to be demolished for health and safety reasons. There is currently no structure at this end of the ground.

<text>The second USS &quot;Truxtun&quot; (DD-14) was the lead ship of s in the United States Navy. She was named for Commodore Thomas Truxtun.

&quot;Truxtun&quot; was laid down on 13 November 1899 at Sparrows Point, Maryland, by the Maryland Steel Company; launched on 15 August 1901; sponsored by Miss Isabelle Truxtun; and commissioned on 11 September 1902.

==Pre-World War I==
Upon commissioning, &quot;Truxtun&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Torpedo Flotilla, and her commanding officer was appointed commander of the flotilla. She conducted trials out of Norfolk until 14 January 1903 and received her final acceptance on 24 April. In August, she participated in maneuvers off Frenchman Bay, Maine, in the Presidential review by Theodore Roosevelt at Oyster Bay, and in a joint Army-Navy exercise off Portland, Maine.

On 26 September, the 2nd Torpedo Flotilla became a unit of the Coast Squadron, North Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Truxtun&quot; joined that squadron in target practice off the Massachusetts coast before returning to Norfolk later that fall for repairs.

For the next four years, &quot;Truxtun&quot; operated along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean. On 31 October 1905 she ran into a barge in a very minor collision at Norfolk, Virginia. In December 1907, she and five other destroyers assembled in Hampton Roads with the battleships of the Atlantic Fleet. President Roosevelt reviewed the fleet once more and then, this &quot;Great White Fleet&quot; passed between Capes Charles and Henry to embark upon its famous round-the-world voyage. &quot;Truxtun&quot; escorted the fleet on the first leg of its voyage, going as far as the west coast. Along the way, she visited ports in Brazil, Chile, Peru, Panama, and Mexico. The fleet reached San Francisco in May 1908, and the destroyers were detached and reassigned to the Pacific Torpedo Fleet, an organization not administratively assigned to the Pacific Fleet. After repairs at Mare Island Navy Yard that summer, &quot;Truxtun&quot; joined her sister destroyers in a training voyage to Hawaii and Samoa. She returned to the west coast at San Diego, her new base of operations, early in December. She began her duty along the Pacific coast of North America with a voyage to Alaskan waters, visiting Seattle, Sitka, Seward, Skagway, and Juneau.

&quot;Truxtun&quot; remained in the Pacific until the summer of 1917. During the intervening period, she continued to be active with the Pacific Torpedo Fleet making cruises out of San Diego. On 25 March 1912, the Pacific Reserve Fleet was established under the command of Rear Admiral Alfred Reynolds. This organization was established in response to severe manpower shortages and was not similar in any respect to the contemporary reserve or &quot;mothball&quot; fleet. By 1 June, &quot;Truxtun&quot; joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet; however, she remained somewhat active, periodically putting to sea to check her machinery and to maintain herself &quot;...in constant readiness for sea.&quot;

Her reserve status was short-lived. She was placed back in full commission on 12 October and resumed normal activity along the coast. On two occasions, in the summer of 1914 and again in the summer of 1916, the torpedo boat destroyer steamed to Mexican waters to protect American interests during the series of political convulsions that plagued that nation during the second decade of the twentieth century. By July 1916, she had returned to semi-inactivity as a unit of the reserve division of the Coast Torpedo Force — later re-designated Division 2 (Reserve), Coast Torpedo Force. As before, however, she conducted sporadic cruises along the California coast to maintain herself in a state of readiness.

==World War I==
On 18 February 1917, &quot;Truxtun&quot; was returned to full commission for the third and final time. Initially, she was assigned to patrol duty in the area of the Panama Canal. On 6 April, the day the United States entered World War I, she departed Colon harbor and headed south to Puerto Colombia, Colombia, where she watched the German ship which was anchored in the harbor. She was relieved by on 14 April and returned to Colon the following day. For almost three months, she patrolled the Pacific coastal waters of Panama and Colombia, periodically doubling as a submarine tender. On Independence Day 1917, she transited the Panama Canal and, the following day, departed Balboa, Panama, in company with &quot;Stewart&quot;, , and . The four destroyers reached Hampton Roads on 13 July. Through the end of August, &quot;Truxtun&quot; patrolled Chesapeake Bay and conducted maneuvers off the coast. She made port calls at New York and Philadelphia, on one occasion acting in the escort for .

On 31 August, &quot;Truxtun&quot; departed Philadelphia for duty in the Azores. After a short stop-over in Bermuda, she arrived at Ponta Delgada on 16 September. The destroyer operated from Ponta Delgada until early December. She and &quot;Whipple&quot; met on 30 September and escorted her into Ponta Delgada on 3 October. In mid-October, she made a short voyage to Funchal, Madeira, and back. Later that month, she participated in a search for the survivors of a torpedoed ship. &quot;Truxtun&quot; cleared Ponta Delgada on 6 December and headed — via Gibraltar — for France. She reached Brest on 15 December. Operating from that port, the destroyer convoyed merchant ships and conducted patrols against German U-boats for the remainder of World War I.

During the ensuing year, she experienced two adventures. The first came on the night of 17 April 1918 when the explosives-laden steamship exploded into flame in Quiberon Bay. For steering his destroyer into the flaming seas surrounding the stricken munitions carrier and helping to rescue many of her crewmen, &quot;Truxtun&quot;″s commanding officer, Lieutenant Ware, was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Her second scrape involved the enemy. At about 0900 on 18 May, while escorting a convoy, she sighted an underwater disturbance and immediately charged to the attack. The warship dropped several patterns of depth charges and fired several rounds from her guns. However, many of the depth charges failed to function properly. The U-boat, believed to have been , made good her escape; and &quot;Truxtun&quot; returned to the convoy at about 0930.

Just over a month after the armistice ended World War I, &quot;Truxtun&quot; bade farewell to Europe. Departing Brest on 18 December in company with , &quot;Stewart&quot;, &quot;Whipple&quot;, and , she steamed, via Ponta Delgada and Bermuda, back to the United States. She entered the Delaware River on 3 January 1919 and was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 18 July. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September. She was sold to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company of Philadelphia on 3 January 1920 for conversion to mercantile service as a motor fruit carrier. She was scrapped in 1956.

==Noteworthy commanding officer==
* Lieutenant Daniel J. Callaghan (5 September 1915-11 Nov 1916) (Later Rear admiral)

<text>Jane Wiedlin is an American musician, singer and actress, best known as the co-founder, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist of the new wave band the Go-Go&#x27;s. She voices Dusk, the drummer and backup vocalist of the fictional rock band the Hex Girls. She also had a successful solo career.

The Go-Go&#x27;s went on to become one of the most successful American bands of the 1980s, helping popularize new wave music with songs such as &quot;We Got the Beat&quot;, &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;, and &quot;Vacation&quot;. As a solo artist, Wiedlin&#x27;s &quot;Rush Hour&quot; peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. As an actress, she had roles as the singing telegram girl in &quot;Clue&quot; (1985) and as Joan of Arc in &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; (1989).

As a member of the Go-Go&#x27;s, Wiedlin received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She and the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021.

==Early life==
Wiedlin was born in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. Her father, Robert Arthur Wiedlin Sr., an oral surgeon of German and Swiss ancestry, was born in Chicago, Illinois. Her mother, Betty Jane (née Herro), was of Lebanese heritage. Wiedlin&#x27;s parents met while students at Marquette University. She is one of five children, with a sister and three brothers, and was raised Catholic. During Wiedlin&#x27;s early childhood, her family lived in West Allis, a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. When she was six, her father took a job with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs at a VA hospital in Los Angeles, and the family followed.

Wiedlin has said, &quot;I remember my childhood as extremely idyllic.&quot; She has also mentioned her adolescence with angst and hope by saying, &quot;I was a depressed teenager. I thought life was completely pointless when I was in high school, but just a few short years later I was having the adventure of a lifetime in a successful rock band!&quot; She attended William Howard Taft High School in Los Angeles from 1972 to 1976.

==Career==
===The Go-Go&#x27;s===
According to Wiedlin, she was present &quot;pretty much from the beginning&quot; of the Los Angeles punk scene. While attending college in the Los Angeles area for fashion design, she worked at a fashion-design house where she created song lyrics by scribbling ideas on clothing patterns. Under the moniker Jane Drano, she designed and sold punk-style clothing at Granny Takes a Trip, a store on Sunset Boulevard. She became part of the scene that spawned bands such as X, the Germs and the Weirdos.

Wiedlin and Belinda Carlisle formed the Go-Go&#x27;s as a punk band in 1978, with Margot Olaverra on bass and Elissa Bello on drums.

In 1981, Wiedlin and Terry Hall of Fun Boy Three and the Specials co-wrote &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;. The song peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at No. 20, where it remained until 1982.

After a series of reunions during the 1990s, Wiedlin, Carlisle, Caffey, Schock and Valentine reunited in 2000 to record &quot;God Bless the Go-Go&#x27;s&quot;, their first studio album in 17 years. The album&#x27;s title and concept came from Wiedlin.

In 2010, the Go-Go&#x27;s announced their &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; farewell tour, which was intended to begin in July. However, it was canceled after Wiedlin fell down a cliff during a nighttime hike and suffered ACL tears in both knees.

The Go-Go&#x27;s announced an 11-date reunion tour scheduled to begin in June 2020. It was postponed in May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2021 it was announced that the Go-Go&#x27;s would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on October 30, 2021. The band continued touring into 2022, before announcing their break up. They did a one-off reunion in 2024 after being inducted into the California Hall of Fame.

===Solo career===

Wiedlin has released four solo albums: &quot;Jane Wiedlin&quot; in 1985, &quot;Fur&quot; in 1988, &quot;Tangled&quot; in 1990, and &quot;Kissproof World&quot; in 2000. From 1995 to 1998, she was also a member of the band FroSTed, which released one album, &quot;Cold&quot;, in 1996. In 2017, Wiedlin teamed up with the American-born Italian multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Pietro Straccia to form a new psychedelic/pop/harmony and guitar-driven duo called Elettrodomestico.

===Acting career===
Wiedlin&#x27;s early acting credits include an ill-fated singing telegram girl in &quot;Clue&quot; (1985), a brief appearance as an officer seen on a Starfleet Command video screen in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986), the White Fairy in Golan-Globus&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1987) and as Joan of Arc in &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; (1989). Of her 1980s acting career, she has stated, &quot;It turned out to be much harder than it looks, and as much as I enjoyed those experiences, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m very good at it.&quot;

In 2001, she had a regular role in MTV&#x27;s &quot;Spyder Games&quot;, portraying the &quot;ex-rock chick who runs the local coffee house&quot; where the characters hang out.

In 2005, she appeared as herself on the fourth season of VH1&#x27;s &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;, in which she talked about her interest in BDSM.

She portrayed the role of Ursula in Steve Balderson&#x27;s 2005 surrealist crime drama film &quot;Firecracker&quot;, which Roger Ebert listed among the year&#x27;s best films. She worked a further three times with director Balderson, in &quot;Stuck!&quot; (2009), an homage to film noir women in prison dramas. &quot;The Casserole Club&quot; (2011), about married swingers in 1960s Palm Springs, and &quot;Culture Shock&quot; (2013), a crime spoof set in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailybloid/interview/steve-balderson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She played Tess in the 2011 independent movie &quot;I Want to Get Married&quot;, and played a math teacher in the 2016 horror film &quot;HoneyBee&quot;.

She has also provided voices for characters in television and film animation, such as Miranda Kane and Shannon in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, Gwen in &quot;Mission Hill&quot;, and Dusk of the Hex Girls in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise.

==Other work==
In 2000, Wiedlin and fellow Go-Go&#x27;s member Charlotte Caffey co-wrote Keith Urban&#x27;s first number one song, &quot;But for the Grace of God&quot;. Wiedlin contributed quotations to &quot;Girls Against Girls&quot; by author Bonnie Burton. Wiedlin was a contributing writer to the Los Angeles punk rock books &quot;Under the Big Black Sun&quot; (2016) and &quot;More Fun in the New World&quot; (2019) by John Doe and Tom DeSavia.
In April 2009, Wiedlin was photographed as Bettie Page by Austin Young for the &quot;Heaven Bound&quot; art show. A number of her songs were featured in the 2018 debut of the Broadway musical &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, with a story suggested by Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; set to the songs of the Go-Go&#x27;s and Belinda Carlisle.

==Personal life==
A long-time animal rights activist, Wiedlin has worked with PETA since as far back as 1989 when she performed as part of a &quot;Rock Against Fur&quot; concert in New York City and is a friend of PETA executive Dan Mathews.

Wiedlin has discussed her struggles with depression and mental health, and how it affected her at several stages of her life, including a suicide attempt in high school, and the effects fame (and a lack of healthy coping mechanisms) had on her wellbeing.

During Wiedlin&#x27;s time in the Los Angeles punk scene, her first real boyfriend was Terry Bag (Terry Graham) of the punk band the Bags and later the Gun Club. She later had what she called a &quot;short but dramatic romance&quot; with Terry Hall of the Specials during a 1980 British tour. Hall later sent her some lyrics prompted by their relationship, inspiring Wiedlin to write &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;, a song on which Hall has co-writer credit and recorded with his own band, Fun Boy Three. In the 2020 documentary &quot;The Go-Go&#x27;s&quot;, bandmate Gina Schock stated that she and Wiedlin were &quot;girlfriends&quot; for a time until Wiedlin broke up with her. Wiedlin also had a brief relationship with Russell Mael of the band Sparks.

Wiedlin identifies as bisexual.

In addition to acting and singing, Wiedlin is an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church, a mail-order religious organization that offers anyone semi-immediate, no-cost ordination as a ULC minister. Wiedlin identifies herself as &quot;Reverend Sister Go-Go&quot;, primarily officiating at weddings.

Wiedlin was married to Ged Malone from 1987 to 1999.

She was married to David Trotter from 2004 to 2005.

Wiedlin became engaged to her boyfriend Terence Lundy in October 2022. They were married in February 2023. She announced their divorce in April 2024. 

Wiedlin has spent her adult life living in various places: Mendocino, Costa Rica, Panama, Wisconsin, San Francisco, and Hawaii.

In December 2023, in an exposé by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Wiedlin alleged that rock DJ Rodney Bingenheimer sexually assaulted her at his English Disco nightclub in Los Angeles when she was around 15 in about 1974.

<doc id="1234612" wikidata="Q7570608" url="?curid=1234612" title="Southern Victory">
<text>The Southern Victory series or Timeline-191 is a series of eleven alternate history novels by author Harry Turtledove, beginning with &quot;How Few Remain&quot; (1997) and published over a decade. The period addressed in the series begins during the Civil War and spans nine decades, up to the mid-1940s. In the series, the Confederate States defeats the United States of America in 1862, therefore making good its attempt at secession and becoming an independent nation. Subsequent books are built on imagining events based on this alternate timeline.

The secondary name is derived from General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Special Order 191, which detailed the C.S. Army of Northern Virginia&#x27;s invasion of the Union through the border state Maryland in September 1862. Turtledove creates a divergence at September 10, 1862, when three Union soldiers do not find a copy of Special Order 191, as they in fact did historically. Historians believe their find helped General George B. McClellan of the Army of the Potomac prepare for his confrontation with Lee, and contributed to the Union&#x27;s eventual victory at the Battle of Antietam.

== Fictional chronology ==

After recovering the lost copy of Special Order 191 before it falls into Union hands, Confederate forces catch George B. McClellan&#x27;s Union Army by surprise and destroy it on the banks of the Susquehanna River in 1862. Occupying Philadelphia, the Confederacy gains diplomatic recognition from the United Kingdom and France, who mediate a peace deal by which the Confederacy achieves independence. President Abraham Lincoln considers his failure to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, along with the possibility of the U.S. finding its own European allies in the future.

The United States cannot afford Alaska, but proceeds with its war against the natives of the Great Plains. Meanwhile, the Confederacy admits Kentucky, Sequoyah, and Cuba as new states, and negotiates the purchase of Sonora and Chihuahua from Mexico in 1881. Republican President James G. Blaine uses this as a casus belli to declare a renewed war, drawing Britain and France back into the conflict. The Union, despite its advantage in manpower and resources, lacks competent leadership, and struggles to take Confederate territory while also facing a revolt in Utah. The Louisville campaign devolves into trench warfare, while Britain and France shell U.S. ports and New Brunswick annexes northern Maine. The Union capitulates in early 1882, recognizing the Confederate acquisitions, while the Republicans are soon voted out of government.

In the wake of the war&#x27;s loss, Lincoln leads his loyal faction of the Republican Party into merging with the nascent Socialist Party of America, changing US politics as this becomes the second major party, supplanting the Republicans afterward. Over the rest of the decade, manumission of slaves is nominally implemented throughout the Confederacy—easing relations with Britain and France, which had both abolished slavery much earlier—although the black population continues to live in apartheid-like conditions. The U.S. secures an alliance with the new German Empire amid a national atmosphere of revanchism.

=== &quot;Great War&quot; ===
Upon the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Britain, France, and Russia go to war with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson order the U.S. and C.S. militaries to mobilize following their respective allies, and fighting soon breaks out. Industrialized warfare and the absence of European intervention favors the Union side, and much of the Confederate officer corps is made up of heirs of great 19th-century generals with no particular talent of their own. An invasion of Maryland and Pennsylvania overruns Washington, D.C., but is unable to take Baltimore, while the Union launches attacks on Sonora and Canada, along with the capture of the British Sandwich Islands. As winter falls, a stalemate settles in across trench lines in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Manitoba, Southern Ontario, and the St. Lawrence River. The U.S. faces another rebellion in Utah and the C.S. faces a black socialist revolt, which takes a year to subdue.

In 1916 a new technical advance is introduced: the &quot;barrel&quot;. George Armstrong Custer develops a doctrine for armored cavalry, but his tactics are not adopted and the first offensive is a failure. The U.S. successfully advances in Canada and defends Hawaii in a large naval engagement; the C.S. hopes that attrition and war weariness might knock the U.S. out, but pro-war President Roosevelt wins reelection, and the Confederacy is forced to begin recruiting black troops with a promise of civil rights after the war. The following year sees breakthroughs in Tennessee and Quebec using Custer&#x27;s massed barrel tactics, while a simultaneous advance in Virginia recaptures a devastated Washington. With Union troops approaching its capital, the C.S. sues for peace, with it suffering the same fate as Germany in our timeline. Territorial changes include Kentucky and the western half of Texas (henceforth known as Houston) being annexed into the U.S. as states. The C.S. States of Arkansas, Sonora, and Virginia lose territory to the U.S. states of Missouri, New Mexico, and West Virginia respectively, and Sequoyah is placed under occupation by U.S. forces. All of Canada (except Quebec, which is released as a U.S. ally) is annexed by the U.S. under occupation. In Europe, army mutinies lead to France&#x27;s exit from the war; Italy never enters it, while Russia is wracked by revolution. Brazil also joins the Central Powers along with Chile and Paraguay against Argentina, and increasingly isolated, Britain capitulates as well, ending the war.

=== &quot;American Empire&quot; ===

Jubilant at having finally beaten the Confederates, the U.S. soon encounters strikes and labor unrest, fueling political gains by the Socialist Party. The Confederacy experiences hyperinflation and a growth in reactionary extremism—ex-sergeant Jake Featherston achieves popularity via his tirades against the &quot;stab in the back&quot;. He comes to lead the C.S. Freedom Party, reorganizing it around his own ambitions with a loyal paramilitary wing and a radio propaganda program. However, Featherston loses several bids for office, and a Freedom Party assassination of the Confederate President drains much of his support until the crash of 1929. With the ranks of his party swelled by popular unrest, Featherston finally becomes President in 1934, and sets about establishing control over the government, the police force, and the expanding army. He demands the return of former Confederate territory in forms of Kentucky, Sequoyah and Houston; after negotiating for plebiscites to be held in those states, Kentucky and Houston vote for re-admittance whilst Sequoyah votes to remain part of the United States.

Elsewhere in the world, the Great War results in independence for Quebec and Ireland, as well as other concessions by Britain; Canada falls under harsh U.S. rule while Germany sets up puppet states in Belgium, Poland, and Ukraine. Tensions seem to be rising between the two powers until the depression hits. The Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires remain intact but fragile; Japan builds an empire in east Asia and carries on a brief war with the U.S. When France demands the return of Alsace-Lorraine and the new Kaiser refuses, Britain, France, Russia, and the Confederacy declare war on Germany. On June 22, 1941, Featherston launches his surprise invasion of the U.S.

=== &quot;Settling Accounts&quot; ===

Against Union expectations, Confederate forces under George Patton drive into Ohio under cover of massive bombing raids, cutting U.S. industry off from its raw materials, but the front soon stalls there and in Virginia. The U.S. Navy suffers reverses against the Royal Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy. However, despite U.S. President Al Smith getting killed during a Confederate bombing raid on Philadelphia, the U.S. does not surrender. In response, the Confederacy launches a major offensive aimed at Pittsburgh, where its army is surrounded and annihilated in urban fighting. Meanwhile, the Confederacy begins &quot;population reductions&quot; against its black population, using poison gas at camps in Louisiana and Texas, which are forced to evacuate as U.S. troops advance. Using blitzkrieg-like tactics, the U.S. Army is also able to push through Kentucky and Tennessee toward Atlanta.

In Europe, the Germans lose Ukraine and the Left Bank of the Rhine, but defend East Prussia and Poland. Britain occupies Ireland, but its Norwegian campaign fails spectacularly. Backed by Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, Germany begins counter-offensives in 1942. With both Russia and Austria-Hungary facing ethnic uprisings, the German Army is able to win at Kyiv and threaten Petrograd, as well as retake the Low Countries. Having won the race for a nuclear weapon, Germany destroys Petrograd with an atomic bomb; as more belligerents acquire the technology, the list of cities targeted grows to include Philadelphia, Newport News, Charleston, Paris, Hamburg, London, Norwich, and Brighton. Russia, France, and Britain sue for peace.

With Texas seceding, Patton surrendering in Alabama, and Featherston killed by a black guerrilla while trying to escape, the Confederacy surrenders unconditionally. U.S. forces hold trials for crimes against humanity and take extreme measures against the remaining bands of guerrillas, while generally aided by the scattered remaining black population. In 1945, new President Thomas E. Dewey pledges to reintegrate the southern states into the Union and to continue the alliance with Germany, while suppressing the development of nuclear weapons by their enemies France, Japan, and Russia.

==Reviews and reactions==
Reviewer Lionel Ward notes that although the series &quot;ends in an apparent happy ending&quot;, &quot;integrating the Confederate territories into the United States would be an impossible mission&quot;—&quot;an open-ended military occupation of a very large sullen population, which would inevitably burst into rebellion sooner or later(...) A far more reasonable policy, never even considered, would have been to revive the Confederate Whig Party under US auspices and make a pragmatic agreement with a rehabilitated Confederacy&quot;. Ward concludes:

The series ends with the US holding by the tail not one tiger but two [The Confederate territories and Canada, occupied since 1917], plus a big aggressive wildcat [The Mormons in Utah]. [...] In this history, the post-1945 United States has nothing like the dominant global position it had in the equivalent period of actual history. There are several rival powers with both the means and the motive to make trouble for the US and actively foment rebellion.

<doc id="1234613" wikidata="Q2005135" url="?curid=1234613" title="The Weapon Shops of Isher">
<text>The Weapon Shops of Isher is a science fiction novel by American writer A. E. van Vogt, first published in 1951. The novel is a fix-up created from three previously published short stories about the Weapon Shops and Isher civilization:

* &quot;The Seesaw&quot; (&quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;, July 1941)
* &quot;The Weapon Shop&quot; (&quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;, December 1942)
* &quot;The Weapon Shops of Isher&quot; (&quot;Wonder Stories&quot;, February 1949)

==Overview==
&quot;The Weapon Shops of Isher&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Weapon Makers&quot; detail the workings of Isher civilization and the adventures of Robert Hedrock, The One Immortal Man, as he keeps it in balance in the face of attempts by the Weapon Makers, who have forgotten their purpose as a permanent opposition, and the strong government of the Empress, Innelda Isher, with its intimate connections to a network of financial institutions, to undermine each other. The Weapon Shops provide the populace with defensive weapons and an alternative legal system.

The Isher/Weapon Shops novels are rare examples of Golden Age science fiction that explicitly discuss the right to keep and bear arms, specifically guns. Indeed, the motto of the Weapon Shops, repeated several times, is &quot;The right to buy weapons is the right to be free&quot;.

The political philosophy of the Weapon Shops is minimalist. They will not interfere with the corrupt imperial monarchy of the Isher government, because men always have a government of the type they deserve: no government, however bad, exists without at least the tacit consent of the governed. The mission of the Weapon Shops, therefore, is primarily to provide a mechanism to prevent an unjust government from oppressing the people too much. Van Vogt says, “[The idea of the founder of the Weapon Shops] was nothing less than that whatever government was in power should not be overthrown. But that an organization should be set up which would have one principal purpose—to ensure that no government ever again obtained complete power over its people. . . . What counts is that many millions of people have the knowledge that they can go to a weapon shop if they want to protect themselves and their families. And, even more important, the forces that would normally try to enslave them are restrained by the conviction that it is dangerous to press people too far. And so a great balance has been struck between those who govern and those who are governed.”

The novel was published by Greenberg in New York in 1951. It was also published as a paperback by Ace Books and in 1969 by New English Library in the U.K.

==Reception==
Boucher and McComas praised &quot;Weapon Shops&quot; as &quot;a fine excitingly involved melodrama.&quot;. P. Schuyler Miller reviewed the novel favorably, reporting that &quot;It will take agile wits to know just what is happening, or why, at any given time.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Basil Davenport found the opening segment &quot;begins well enough,&quot; but as the novel progresses, the reader&#x27;s attention becomes &quot;badly divided.&quot;

<text>The Clutha were a traditional Scottish band hailing from Glasgow, that released a small number of albums in the 1970s. The line-up on the Clutha&#x27;s first album, &quot;Scotia&quot; (1971), was John Eaglesham (vocal, concertina), Erlend Voy (fiddle, concertina, vocals), Calum Allan (fiddle), Ronnie Alexander (vocals, guitar) and Gordeanna McCulloch (vocals). The same band members are credited on their 1974 album, &quot;Scots Ballads Songs &amp; Dance Tunes&quot;. By the time of their 1977 release, &quot;The Bonnie Mill Dams&quot;, Jimmy Anderson had joined the group on chamber pipes and bagpipes, and Eaglesham had left the group.

==History==
In 1957, Norman Buchan was a teacher at Rutherglen Academy. He formed a Ballads Club. Among the pupils who joined up were Gordeanna McCulloch. She fell in love with singing, and travelled to London to attend one of Ewan MacColl&#x27;s weekend seminars at his home in Beckenham, Kent. She sang briefly with the Clydesiders a group formed at school, and in 1964 joined The Clutha. The name is the Latin word for the Clyde. The band played traditional Scottish tunes and sang songs in Scots.

===The Small Pipes===
When The Clutha added Jimmy Anderson on the lowland pipes on &quot;Bonnie Mill Dams&quot; (1977) they were pioneers, in that the instrument had rarely been heard for 100 years, and not previously recorded. They won the Peter Cooke Cup for Scots ceilidh bands in 1971, 1972 and 1973. Although they did not record again until 2001, they have continued to host ceilidh dances. In 2001, The Clutha released an album entitled &quot;On the Braes&quot;, with Ronnie Alexander (vocals, guitar), Erlend Voy (fiddle, concertina, vocals), Callum Allan (fiddle), Gordeanna McCulloch (vocals) and Tom Johnstone (pipes).

===McCulloch solo===
In 1965, McCulloch appeared on a compilation album on Topic Records. In 1978 she released her own solo album, &quot;Sheath and Knife&quot;, on which she unearthed obscure Scottish songs. Since then she has appeared on six compilation albums and recorded another solo album. To cover McCulloch&#x27;s absence during a Brittany tour by the band, they temporarily recruited Heather Heywood to stand in as a vocals singer.

McCulloch died in 2019.

===Norman Buchan MP===
Buchan became a Labour Member of Parliament and was the organiser of the Edinburgh Folk Festival for several years.

<doc id="1234615" wikidata="Q295452" url="?curid=1234615" title="Mart Poom">
<text>Mart Poom (born 3 February 1972) is an Estonian football coach and former professional player who is regarded as one of the greatest Estonian footballers of all time. He is the goalkeeping coach of the Estonia national team.

Poom played as a goalkeeper for Lõvid, Sport Tallinn, KuPS, Flora, Wil, Portsmouth, Derby County, Sunderland, Arsenal, and Watford. Poom made his international debut on 3 June 1992 in the Estonia national team&#x27;s first official match since restoration of independence, a 1–1 draw against Slovenia in a friendly. He made a total of 120 appearances for Estonia and was the team&#x27;s captain. Poom won the Estonian Footballer of the Year award six times, in 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2003, the second highest number of times won, behind only Ragnar Klavan. In November 2003, Poom was named Estonia&#x27;s Golden Player. He ended his career on 10 June 2009, after a 0–0 draw against Portugal.

==Early life==
Poom was born in Tallinn and grew up in Mustamäe. He graduated from the Tallinn Secondary School No. 49 with a gold medal and enrolled at the Tallinn University of Technology, but didn&#x27;t finish his studies, focusing on football.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Poom started playing football with Tallinna Lõvid (), before moving to Soviet Second League club Sport Tallinn in 1989.

===KuPS===
In 1992, Poom joined Finnish Veikkausliiga club KuPS. He played only 9 games in Finland, before returning to Estonia.

===Flora===
Back in Estonia, Poom and signed for Meistriliiga club Flora, the successor of the Lõvid team.

===Wil===
On 1 August 1993, Poom left Flora and joined Nationalliga B side Wil for a reported transfer fee of £128,000.

===Portsmouth===
On 4 August 1994, Poom moved to England and signed for First Division side Portsmouth for a reported transfer fee of £170,000. He made four league appearances for Portsmouth.

====Flora (loan)====
In 1995, Poom joined his former club Flora on loan, where he broke the club record by keeping a clean sheet for 756 minutes.

===Derby County===
On 26 March 1997, Poom joined Derby County for a reported transfer fee of £595,000, following a strong performance for Estonia (a 0–0 draw against Scotland, in a rearranged match played in Monaco). He made his Premier League debut on 5 April 1997, against Manchester United in Derby&#x27;s 3–2 away win at Old Trafford, becoming the first player from Estonia to play in the PL. Poom soon became a fan favourite, with supporters often confusing unfamiliar commentators with a low chant of &#x27;Pooooom&#x27; before games, which sounded like booing. Poom was named Derby County&#x27;s Player of the Year in the 1999–2000 season and in 2022, the best footballer of the 2000s decade by Derby County 

===Sunderland===
On 18 November 2002, following Derby County&#x27;s relegation to the First Division in the 2001–02 season, Poom joined Sunderland on loan. The move was made permanent on 10 January 2003, for a fee of £3.19 million. On 20 September 2003, he headed a 90th-minute equaliser for Sunderland against Derby County at Pride Park. This was described as &quot;the best goal ever scored by a goalkeeper in the 90th minute on his first match against his former club&quot; by the commentator. The goal was cheered by both sets of fans. Poom&#x27;s career in Sunderland was beset by several injuries, and he was forced to spend much of the 2004–05 season on the sidelines, making 11 league appearances as Sunderland won the 2004–05 Football League Championship.

===Arsenal===

On 31 August 2005, Poom was signed by Arsenal on loan as temporary cover for Jens Lehmann and Manuel Almunia. The move was made permanent on 23 January 2006. He was Arsenal&#x27;s third-choice keeper, and did not play a single match in the 2005–06 season. However, he became the first Estonian to receive a Champions League runners-up medal after Arsenal lost to Barcelona in the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. Poom did not play nor did he make the substitutes&#x27; bench for the final, but was in Arsenal&#x27;s 25-man European squad, each of whom won a silver medal.

He made his debut for Arsenal on 8 November 2006 in a League Cup match against Everton, replacing the injured Manuel Almunia at half-time. Arsenal won the match 1–0 from an Emmanuel Adebayor goal. His first and only appearance for Arsenal in the Premier League, came on the last day of the 2006–07 season, against his former club, Portsmouth, in a 0–0 draw.

===Watford===
On 26 May 2007, Poom signed for Watford, who had recently been relegated from the Premier League, for an undisclosed fee. He started the new season as Watford&#x27;s first choice, but went on to lose his place to Richard Lee.

Poom returned to the side for the start of the 2008–09 season, but sustained a dislocated shoulder in a game against Reading on 20 September 2008 that ruled him out for the majority of the season. Although he returned to training before the end of the season, he was not considered for the first-team squad and he was released from his contract, which was due to end in June, on 30 April 2009.

==International career==
Poom made his international debut for the Estonia national team on 3 June 1992, in a historic 1–1 friendly draw against Slovenia. The match was Estonia&#x27;s first official match since restoration of independence and Slovenia&#x27;s first match ever. In November 2003, the Estonian Football Association named Poom Estonia&#x27;s greatest player of the last 50 years. Poom ended his international career with a testimonial match on 10 June 2009, after a 0–0 friendly draw against Portugal in Tallinn. He made 120 appearances, keeping a clean sheet in 31 matches.

==Personal life==
Poom and his wife, Lissel, have three sons: Markus, Andreas and Patrick. Markus is also a footballer, while Andreas is a music artist.

<text>Joseph Smith Fowler (August 31, 1820April 1, 1902) was an American attorney and politician. As a resident of Tennessee, he was notable for his support of the Union during the American Civil War. Fowler served as state comptroller during the military governorship of Andrew Johnson. After the war, Fowler served as a United States Senator from Tennessee from 1866 to 1871.

==Early life==
Fowler was born in Steubenville, Ohio on August 31, 1820, a son of James and Sarah (Atkinson) Fowler, natives of Maryland and Virginia respectively. He graduated from Steubenville&#x27;s Grove Academy attended Franklin College in New Athens, Ohio, from which he graduated in 1843. He taught school in Shelby County, Kentucky in 1844 and was a professor of mathematics at Franklin College in Davidson County, Tennessee from 1845 to 1849. He studied law in Bowling Green, Kentucky, was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Tennessee until 1861. From 1856 to 1861 he served as president of Howard Female College in Gallatin, Tennessee.

==Civil War==
Fowler was an ardent Unionist and at the start of the American Civil War he moved his family to Springfield, Illinois. He returned to Tennessee when a pro-Union government was established. From 1862 to 1865, Fowler served as Tennessee&#x27;s state comptroller, holding office during the military governorship of Andrew Johnson.

==United States Senator==
In 1866, Tennessee became the first former Confederate state to be readmitted to the Union; the Tennessee General Assembly elected Fowler to the Senate, where his service began on July 24, 1866. Fowler became a part of the majority Republican caucus. In the 40th Congress he served as chairman of the Committee on Engrossed Bills.

===Impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson===
During President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s impeachment trial, Fowler broke party ranks, along with nine other Republican senators, and voted for acquittal. Including Fowler, seven Republican senators were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. The other Republican senators expressing these concerns were William Pitt Fessenden James W. Grimes, John B. Henderson, Lyman Trumbull, Peter G. Van Winkle, and Edmund G. Ross of Kansas, who provided the decisive vote. Together, with three other Republican Senators (James Dixon, James Rood Doolittle, Daniel Sheldon Norton) they all defied their party and public opinion and voted against convicting Johnson. After the trial, Congressman Benjamin Butler conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson&#x27;s acquittal. In Butler&#x27;s hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash.

==Later life==
Fowler was not a candidate for reelection, and left the Senate at the end of his term in 1871. He returned to Tennessee, and practiced law in Nashville. In 1872, he was active in the Liberal Republican Party, and was a delegate to its national convention. In 1875, Fowler was selected by the committee planning the public memorial in Nashville that commemorated Andrew Johnson&#x27;s death to deliver the funeral oration. In 1878, Fowler moved to Washington, D.C., where he practiced law until shortly before his death. Fowler also authored articles for &quot;The Magazine of American History&quot; and other publications.

==Death and burial==
Fowler died in Washington on April 1, 1902. He was buried at Lexington Cemetery in Lexington, Kentucky.

==Family==
On November 12, 1846, Fowler married Maria Louisa Embry (1827-1866). They were the parents of two children, Louisa Fowler (1849-1889) and James Bowling Fowler (1859-1887).

==Legacy==
A collection of Fowler&#x27;s papers is maintained by the Tennessee State Library and Archives.

<doc id="1234625" wikidata="Q1064058" url="?curid=1234625" title="Charles Daubeny">
<text>Charles Giles Bridle Daubeny (11 February 179512 December 1867) was an English chemist, botanist and geologist.

==Education==
Daubeny was born at Stratton near Cirencester in Gloucestershire, the son of the Rev. James Daubeny. He went to Winchester College in 1808, and in 1810 was elected to a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, under Dr. John Kidd. From 1815 to 1818 he studied medicine in London and Edinburgh, in the latter also studying geology under Prof Robert Jameson. He took his M.D. degree at Oxford, and was a fellow of the College of Physicians.

==Fieldwork==
In 1819, in the course of a tour through France, he made the volcanic district of Auvergne a special study, and his &quot;Letters on the Volcanos of Auvergne&quot; were published in &quot;The Edinburgh Journal&quot;. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1822.

By subsequent journeys in Hungary, Transylvania, Italy, Sicily, France and Germany he extended his knowledge of volcanic phenomena; and in 1826 the results of his observations were given in a work entitled &quot;A Description of Active and Extinct Volcanos&quot;. In common with Gay-Lussac and Davy, he held subterraneous thermal disturbances to be probably due to the contact of water with metals of the alkalis and alkaline earths.

==Oxford==

In November 1822, Daubeny succeeded Kidd as professor of chemistry at Oxford, and retained this post until 1855. In 1834, he was appointed to the chair of botany to which was subsequently attached that of rural economy. At the Oxford botanical garden he conducted numerous experiments upon the effect of changes in soil, light and the composition of the atmosphere upon vegetation. In 1830 he published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; a paper on the iodine and bromine of mineral waters. In 1831 Daubeny represented the universities of England at the first meeting of the British Association, which at his request held their next session at Oxford. In 1836 he communicated to the Association a report on the subject of mineral and thermal waters. The Reverend W. Tuckwell drew this pen portrait of Daubeny in 1900:

Daubeny was a diligent yet not very successful lecturer.  Between 1822 and 1854 a total of 618 people attended his chemistry lectures.  A third of these were clergymen, while academics numbered 69 and members of the medical profession, 31.  According to Tuckwell: &#x27;His chemistry lectures were a failure; he lacked physical force, sprightliness of manner, oral readiness ...&#x27;  The students sat passively, writing down what Daubeny read out and only watching the experiments.  Worse still, says Tuckwell, his scientific demonstrations &#x27;invariably went wrong&#x27;. Vernon Harcourt later recalled how, when one experiment failed to yield the result expected, he turned to his assistant, John Harris, and remarked: &#x27;John, when we tried this experiment before the lecture the results were so-and-so&#x27;. Harris assented, and Daubeny then turned to the audience: &#x27;You see, gentleman&#x27;.  H.M. Vernon recounts another incident:

Another story is told of an occasion when the Professor, holding up a vessel, thrilled his hearers by asserting that it contained a liquefied gas, and that, if he were to drop it, the gas would vaporize, and they would all be immediately suffocated.  The next instant the vessel slipped and crashed to the ground, but – nothing happened. &#x27;John, why aren&#x27;t we all suffocated?&#x27; demanded Daubeny, and John had to confess that before the lecture he had substituted distilled water for the dangerous gas.

The numbers attending Daubeny&#x27;s lectures gradually declined.  For the period 1822 to 1830 an average of 28 undergraduates were present for his chemistry lectures, with a peak of 44 in 1828.  But thereafter a decline set it: for the years 1830 to 1838 the average was 14, and in 1838 fell to just 10, prompting him to cancel his lectures for the next year – understandably, as he personally paid the costs of the experiments.

In 1837 he visited the United States and acquired there the materials for papers on the thermal springs and the geology of North America, read in 1838 before the Ashmolean Society and the British Association (and published in 1839). In 1856 he became president of the latter body at its meeting at Cheltenham. The herbarium at Oxford is named after him, as is the plant genus &quot;Daubenya&quot;.

In 1860, Daubeny read a paper entitled &quot;Remarks on the Final Causes of the Sexuality of Plants&quot; at the Natural History Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford. The paper references the work of Charles Darwin. Daubeny has been described as an earlier supporter of natural selection.

<doc id="1234630" wikidata="Q179221" url="?curid=1234630" title="Silly Wizard">
<text>Silly Wizard were a Scottish folk band that began forming in Edinburgh in 1970. The founder members were two like-minded university students—Gordon Jones (guitar, bodhran, vocals, bouzouki, mandola), and Bob Thomas (guitar, mandolin, mandola, banjo, concertina). In January 1972, Jones and Thomas formed a trio with their flatmate Bill Watkins (guitar, vocals, fiddle) and performed (occasionally unpaid) under various band names in Edinburgh folk clubs. In the spring of 1972, Watkins returned to Birmingham and, in June 1972, Chris Pritchard (vocals) came in as his replacement. In July 1972, this newly formed trio were offered their first paid booking at the Burns Monument Hotel, Brig O&#x27; Doon, Scotland, and needed a band name in a hurry. The name &quot;Silly Wizard&quot; was chosen and the continuing stream of bookings ensured that the name became permanent. In September 1972, the trio recruited Johnny Cunningham (1957–2003) (fiddle, viola, mandola, vocals) and Silly Wizard started to take off.

==History==
===Formation===
Thomas credited the name of the band to a flatmate who was writing a book of children&#x27;s stories, and the group first performed as &quot;Silly Wizard&quot; in summer 1972. Chris Pritchard (vocals) replaced Bill Watkins (vocals, guitar) in 1972. From September 1972 until March 1974, the band organized the Saturday night bookings, and regularly performed, at the Triangle Folk Club in Edinburgh. In February 1973, vocalist Pritchard left the band and was replaced by Madelaine Taylor (guitar, bodhran, vocals). In October 1973, the band was signed to the Transatlantic Records XTRA label. An album was recorded but before it could be released, Madelaine Taylor left the band in December 1973. The master tapes were subsequently lost and the album has never been released.

Jones, Thomas, and Cunningham began touring as a trio in January 1974, and went on the first of many French tours in April 1974.

The band added Neil Adam (bass, harmonium) in September 1974 and Andy M. Stewart (vocals, tin whistle, tenor banjo) in December 1974. In March 1975, Silly Wizard began work on their next album. The band was then joined by Freeland Barbour (accordion, bouzouki) and Alastair &quot;Ali&quot; Donaldson (1955-2013) (bass, flute), who replaced Neil Adam in July 1975 when the latter decided to return to university. Their eponymous LP &quot;Silly Wizard&quot; was released on the XTRA label and the band began touring throughout the UK and Europe.

===Departure of Barbour; addition of Phil Cunningham===
In late 1976, Freeland Barbour left the band and was replaced by Johnny Cunningham&#x27;s younger brother, Phil Cunningham (accordion, tin whistle, harmonium, synthesizer, octave mandolin, vocals), then sixteen years old. At the same time Alastair &quot;Ali&quot; Donaldson left and was replaced by Martin Hadden (bass, guitar, piano). This six-member lineup then recorded the band&#x27;s second LP, &quot;Caledonia&#x27;s Hardy Sons&quot; (Highway/Shanachie, 1978). Founding member Bob Thomas left just as the group began work on their third LP, &quot;So Many Partings&quot; (Highway/Shanachie, 1979).

===Departure of Johnny Cunningham===
Johnny Cunningham departed the band for the U.S. in 1980 and was replaced for six months by Dougie MacLean.

===Dissolution and aftermath===
They continued recording until the late 1980s, when the band decided to dissolve after performing for seventeen years and releasing nine albums. The band played its final performance in Voorheesville, New York in April 1988. Johnny Cunningham died on 15 December 2003 in New York.

Andy M. Stewart died in hospital in Melrose, Roxburghshire, Scotland on 27 December 2015 as a result of medical difficulties that arose after failed spinal surgery in 2012.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
Silly Wizard played a variety of Scottish folk music, both instrumental and vocal, from fast jigs and reels to slow airs. While the majority of the items they played were traditional songs or tunes, the band did write many compositions of their own. Phil Cunningham generally wrote instrumental music centered on the accordion, and Stewart wrote several songs in a style often distinctly traditional. Once Stewart&#x27;s singing and the driving, impassioned instrumentals of the Cunningham brothers had established themselves at its centre, the group&#x27;s overall sound changed little.

==Honours==
* In Scots Trad Music Awards, 2003 Silly Wizard were nominated for the best folk band award.
* Members of Silly Wizard played at Celtic Connections in February 2007.
* In December 2012, Silly Wizard was inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame.

<text>The Córas Iompair Éireann 201 Class was a class of 34 diesel electric locomotives manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers at their Dukinfield Works in Manchester. They were a smaller, lighter and less powerful version of the 001 Class and were originally intended for branch line passenger and freight (mixed traffic) duties. They were introduced in 1956 and, although their duties changed over the years, were in regular service on the Irish railway network until the mid-1980s. Six were sold to Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) in 1986.

==Service history==

Unfortunately, these locomotives suffered from two distinct problems: 
* During the late 1950s and early 1960s, following the publication of the Andrews Report (mimicking the widescale the Beeching Axe in Britain), CIÉ undertook large-scale closures of branch lines, leaving the engines without a purpose.
*The locomotives were of insufficient power for their duties and their Crossley engines suffered reliability problems. The existing Metro-Vick traction motors and generators were recognised as robust and retained in the rebuild. 

Replacement engines:
Because of the problems with the Crossley engines attempts were made to fit the locomotives with more suitable equipment. Between 1965 and 1980, Maybach MD650 engines of were fitted in Nos. 233 and 234. From 1969, however, a permanent solution was found by fitting the entire class with General Motors engines, a similar process that was previously undergone by the 001 Class). 
 New Duties:
From 1969 the class were given new duties, being partnered with former 2600 class diesel multiple units converted to four-car push-pull carriage rakes to operate the suburban services around Dublin. In 1984 the Dublin suburban lines over which they worked were electrified and new electric multiple units known as the 8100s operated the newly named Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) system.

The first member of the class to be withdrawn was No. B201, being bomb damaged in 1973. The remaining members of the class, except for the six sold to NIR, were withdrawn over the two years following the opening of the DART system having completed 30 years service for their operators.

==Numbering==
When built, these locomotives were numbered C201-C234, and as locomotives were re-engined, they were renumbered B201-B234 to reflect their increased power. However, the prefix letter was later dropped.

==Livery==
Over the years the class has carried six different liveries. When introduced they were painted an all-over silver livery which unfortunately dirtied quickly and was not a good advert for dieselisation. This was followed by all-over CIÉ green livery with a thin lighter green band on the lower panels, giving a uniform appearance to the train sets. In the next change black became the base colour with just a white relief around the top panel, which opened to a squared-off &#x27;V&#x27; between the cab windows. Some locomotives received large yellow panel to the cab fronts to aid visibility. With the adaptation by CIÉ of its &quot;Black and Tan&quot; scheme in the mid-1960s, the locomotives received this livery with a white line at roof level to match the coaches. The last CIÉ livery was of Golden Brown with a very broad black band covering the upper panels at the level of, and as wide as, the cab windows.
Those locomotives sold to NIR carried their blue livery.

==NIR use==

After withdrawal from CIÉ, six locomotives were sold to Northern Ireland Railways, which designated them 104 Class. They entered traffic for NIR in 1986–1987, except 105. Originally, CIÉ 224 was intended to become 105, but it was subsequently rejected by NIR and replaced by 218, which only entered traffic in 1991. 224 was left stored with NIR until it was scrapped in January 1996.

Of those that entered service, some had very short lives working for their new owners. They were stored as soon as any problems arose (e.g. a seized engine or traction motor), and the whole class was formally withdrawn in 1993 (107/109) or 1995 (the others). The locomotives involved, their new numbers and their withdrawal are set out below:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 21 October 1974, locomotive B202 was hauling an empty passenger train when it ran away driverless from Connolly station and collided with a passenger train at , County Meath, A third passenger train, hauled by locomotive B219 was struck by the wrecked trains. Two people were killed and 29 were injured.

==Preservation==

* Two 201 Class locomotives, numbers 226 and 231, have been preserved by the Irish Traction Group 226 was the first mainline diesel to be preserved in Ireland. C231 is currently based at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway, painted in CIÉ Green livery, whilst 226 is undergoing restoration at Carrick-on-Suir. Irish Traction Group
* A third example, NIR 106/CIÉ 227 was preserved privately and displayed at Cahirciveen, County Kerry The Irish Crossleys and carries the number C202, which was supposedly the number of the locomotive hauling the last train from Cahirciveen in 1960 but it was in fact both 227 and 201 which worked the last up and down trains. Irish Rail recovered the engine for reuse in its 141/181 class locomotives. This locomotive and its three remaining siblings were stored in an unprotected site on NIR. Metal theft at this stage rendered it and its sisters a write-off as far as ever running again was concerned. Whilst scrapping of its sisters was taking place this locomotive was further stripped of almost all internal equipment (compressor, exhauster, air tanks, cooler fan, etc) before being moved to Cahirsiveen in 1997. The locomotive was cosmetically restored and repainted in silver and renumbered C202. The almost empty engine room was floored with plywood. While in Cahirsiveen the body suffered extensive corrosion from 7 years of open air display near the sea and its windows were smashed again.An arson attack on the locomotive as well as its &quot;eye sore&quot; appearance on the landscape meant that scrapping was becoming very likely. In around 2004, the locomotive was saved from scrapping by a member of the now defunct &quot;A15r [sic] Group and moved from Caherciveen to a site used by a heritage railway at Bilberry, Waterford with the intention of being restored as part of a scheme to reopen the New Ross railway. However, during her time in Bilberry the locomotive was further vandalised. The plywood floor was ripped up and any remaining traction motor cable was cut out by metal thieves. The locomotive also suffered further deterioration due to being stored in the open with rainwater entering through broken windows and rotten roof panels. In 2010, the locomotive was relocated to a more secure site near Kilmacow village, and traveled the 10 km journey to this premises in Kilmacow by road on a low loader. In 2023, 227 was bought by the West Clare Railway and moved to Moyasta.

==Models==
* The C Class is available as a brass and white metal 00 gauge kit from No Nonsense Kits, now acquired by Phoenix Paints.
* A resin version is available from Silver Fox Models.
* A Rapid Prototyped N Scale body is available from Valve Design.

<text>Living in a Fantasy is the eighth album by the English singer-songwriter Leo Sayer. It was released on 22 August 1980.

Although the album was not a huge commercial success, the single that it spawned, a cover version of Bobby Vee&#x27;s &quot;More Than I Can Say&quot;, spent five weeks at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in December 1980 and January 1981. Sayer&#x27;s version of the song was certified a gold record by the RIAA. It also spent three weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; adult contemporary chart. In the UK, the song peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, while it spent two weeks atop the Kent Music Report in Australia. Sayer has stated that while looking for an &quot;oldie&quot; to record for &quot;Living in a Fantasy&quot;, he saw a TV commercial for a greatest hits compilation album by Vee, and chose the song on the spot: &quot;We went into a record store that afternoon, bought the record and had the song recorded that night.&quot;

<text>Gary Patrick Breen (born 12 December 1973) is a former footballer who made more than 500 appearances in the Football League and Premier League. A centre back, Breen played for numerous clubs over a 20-year career, including more than 100 appearances each for Coventry City and Sunderland. Born in England, he won 63 caps for the Republic of Ireland. He played in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, scoring in Ireland&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Saudi Arabia.

==Club career==
Breen was born in Hendon, London, and began his professional career as a youth player at Charlton Athletic, but never made a first-team appearance for the club. Instead, he moved to Maidstone United where he played his first league game at age 17. After one full season with the club he joined Gillingham where he eventually became a first-team regular, prompting a £70,000 bid from Peterborough United.

He only had one full season at Peterborough United, but did well enough to draw attention from First Division Birmingham City, who paid £250,000 for him in February 1996. Less than 12 months after arriving at Birmingham, he was on the move again, to Premier League Coventry City in a £2.5 million deal. He played for five full seasons at Highfield Road, four in the top flight.

Following the 2002 World Cup, Breen was signed on a free transfer by West Ham United by manager Glenn Roeder, but left the club after relegation from the top flight and only 18 appearances in all competitions. He was signed on a free transfer by his old Ireland manager Mick McCarthy for Sunderland.

Breen was subsequently signed by Wolverhampton Wanderers in a two-year deal, reuniting him again with McCarthy. He played almost all the club&#x27;s games as they reached the play-offs in his first season at Molineux, scoring once, against Luton Town.

He was made Wolves&#x27; club captain for the 2007–08 season, but ended up missing several months through injury. He was involved in an after-match confrontation with his manager in March 2008.

In December 2008, he joined Barnet as a player-coach. In July 2009 Breen signed a new contract to become player/assistant manager at the club.

On the &quot;Goals on Sunday&quot; programme on 6 September 2009, Breen revealed that he had agreed to move to Inter Milan after the 2002 World Cup, but failed a medical. Breen had also been linked with a move to Barcelona. Breen left Barnet in June 2010.

Breen was appointed first-team coach of Peterborough United in June 2013.

==International career==
Breen&#x27;s form at Birmingham won him a call-up to the Republic of Ireland national team. On 29 May 1996, he made his debut when he replaced Alan Kernaghan in the 88th minute of the 1–0 friendly defeat against Portugal at Lansdowne Road. Three days later, Breen made his first start in the 2–2 friendly draw with Croatia, he played 74 minutes before being replaced by Tony Cascarino. He scored his first goal for his country two days later, he opened the scoring in the 3–1 defeat to the Netherlands at De Kuip in Rotterdam.

Breen&#x27;s form at Coventry cemented his place in his national side and he played at the 2002 FIFA World Cup as Ireland made the second round under Mick McCarthy. He scored in Ireland&#x27;s 3–0 group win against Saudi Arabia.

<doc id="1234645" wikidata="Q7735793" url="?curid=1234645" title="The Gap Cycle">
<text>The Gap Cycle is a series of science fiction novels by Stephen R. Donaldson, more usually known for his works of epic fantasy. The series was originally published between 1991 and 1996 by Bantam Books and was reprinted by Gollancz in 2008 in the UK. Here, Donaldson gave a loose retelling of Wagner&#x27;s Ring cycle. 
==Premise==
It is an epic work set in a future where humans have pushed far out into space in the name of commerce. The series follows two concurrent story arcs. The first concerns an ensign in the United Mining Companies Police (UMCP), Morn Hyland, who is attempting to stay alive after being captured by a marauder named Angus Thermopylae. The second follows the fate of three people who are affected by the Byzantine political maneuvering of the head of the UMCP, Warden Dios, as he attempts to thwart the machinations of his boss, the CEO of United Mining Companies (UMC) itself, Holt Fasner.

==Books in series==

# &quot;The Gap into Conflict: The Real Story&quot;, Bantam/Spectra, 1990
# &quot;The Gap into Vision: Forbidden Knowledge&quot;, Bantam/Spectra, 1991
# &quot;The Gap into Power: A Dark and Hungry God Arises&quot;, Bantam/Spectra, 1992
# &quot;The Gap into Madness: Chaos and Order&quot;, Bantam/Spectra, 1994
# &quot;The Gap into Ruin: This Day All Gods Die&quot;, Bantam/Spectra, 1996

The Victor Gollancz Ltd (UK) reprints combine the first two books into a single volume. This was, according to Donaldson&#x27;s official website, at his request.
==Origins==
According to the author&#x27;s afterword in &quot;The Gap Into Conflict: The Real Story&quot; (1990), the series was originally envisioned as a novella in which characters representing villain, victim, and rescuer would switch places during the course of the narrative. When Donaldson found the result unsatisfying, the book was shelved until he thought of now retelling of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; in the same universe and casting the characters from the first novel in roles based on those from Wagner&#x27;s opera.

<doc id="1234650" wikidata="Q331450" url="?curid=1234650" title="Talvin Singh">
<text>Talvin Singh OBE (born 1970) is an English musician, producer, and composer. A tabla player, he is known for creating an innovative fusion of Indian classical music with drum and bass. Singh is generally considered involved with an electronica subgenre called Asian Underground, and more recently as Indian and/or Asian electronica.

On 21 August 2011 he married Calcutta-born, now Bangalore-based Jasmeen Patheja in Gurdwara Jagat Sudhar on Rashbehari Avenue.

After collaborating with Siouxsie and the Banshees and Björk in the early 1990s, Singh released his debut album &quot;Ok&quot; (1998), which received the Mercury Music Prize in 1999.

Singh has since collaborated with a variety of acts including Madonna and Massive Attack.

==Early life and career==
Singh grew up in Leytonstone and began playing the tablas as a child. At the age of 16, Singh went to India for two years where he studied tabla under Sangeet Acharya Ustad Lachman Singh Seen of Punjab Gharana. He then returned to the UK after just one year. In spite of this classical training, Singh&#x27;s tabla playing was not accepted by British promoters of classical Indian music, as he incorporated too strongly his western influences. By the late 1980s, Singh had decided to turn towards the fusion of sounds. In 1991, he came to prominence by both playing tabla and singing on the &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; single by Siouxsie and the Banshees : the single peaked in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 23. Singh then became the sixth member of the Banshees and took part with them as second headliners of the inaugural Lollapalooza tour. Two years later in 1993, he was recruited by Björk to be her percussionist and director on her 1993 album, &quot;Debut&quot;.

In late 1995, Singh founded the Anokha club night with promoter Sweety Kapoor at East London&#x27;s Blue Note, where drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass DJs and South Asian punk bands went head to head with the amped-up sounds of his tabla and percussion. Producer and DJ State of Bengal (Sam Zaman) soon became the core of Anokha alongside Singh &amp; Kapoor, and his sets alongside Singhs help to inspire a whole generation.

Singh and Zaman would make fresh tracks, cutting them on Vinyl press hours before the Monday Anokha sessions where they would be showcased.

Guest spots by LTJ Bukem and others made Anokha a Monday-night hotspot in London, and Singh signed to Island for an Anokha compilation including several of his own productions. He worked as a remixer, for Blondie on their &quot;Maria&quot; single&quot;.

In 1998, Singh released his solo debut album, &quot;Ok&quot;. The record was critically acclaimed and received the prestigious Mercury Music Prize in 1999. That same year, he also collaborated with David Sylvian. In 2000, he worked with Madonna for her album, &quot;Music&quot;.

==Style and influences==
Singh is an accomplished tabla player, electronic musician, music theorist, record producer and DJ. As a solo artist, he is perhaps best known as the father of modern Asian electronica music, though he is also a highly celebrated tabla player, record producer and visual practitioner.

Drawing inspiration from the classical Indian arts, Singh first came to prominence as a tabla percussionist in the 1980s London music scene. Whilst still in his mid-teens, Singh travelled to India to earn pupillage from Sangeet Acharya Ustad Lachman Singh Seen, master tabla maestro of the Punjab school. This period made an indelible mark on the young artist and he has since continued to practice and perform the art form internationally. Singh&#x27;s collaborations with Indian classical musicians include Ustad Sultan Khan, Rakesh Churasia, Ustad Imrat Khan and Ustad Amjad Ali Khan amongst scores of others.

Singh also became involved in experimental music collaborations beginning in the late 1980s, working with Sun Ra and Courtney, which helped to popularise the burgeoning Asian underground sub-culture movement.

Singh is notable for re-introducing the concepts of Indian classical music to western pop, dance and jazz genres in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Singh&#x27;s solo album credits include critical and commercial successes Ok (1998)—which won the UK&#x27;s two most prestigious music prizes, &#x27;The South Bank Prize&#x27; and the Mercury Prize in 1999. &quot;Ok&quot;, his groundbreaking 1998 debut release, was recorded in Mumbai, Madras, Okinawa, New York and London, featuring contributions from Bill Laswell, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Ustad Sultan Khan and the Madras Philharmonic Orchestra amongst others.

Singh has pursued several artistic ventures parallel to and in conjunction with his music career, including creating the seminal London club ANOKHA, performing at the Tate Gallery in London, creating a sound installation at the Frith Street Gallery in London and composing music for various experimental dance, theatre and film projects. In 1990 Singh conceived the Tablatronic, a hybrid electronic/analog tabla (drum) which uses a rare internal microphone system. However, in a 2017 interview, he said he &quot;did not do fusion music&quot; and disliked the way Indian musicians felt they had to do fusion music.

==Awards==
Singh&#x27;s debut album &quot;Ok&quot; (1998) received the Mercury Music Prize in 1999.

In 2010, Talvin Singh won an award at the UK Asian Music Awards (UK AMAs) for his &quot;Commitment to Scene&quot;. He was awarded an OBE in the 2014 Birthday Honours.

<text>General Problem Solver (GPS) is a computer program created in 1957 by Herbert A. Simon, J. C. Shaw, and Allen Newell (RAND Corporation) intended to work as a universal problem solver machine. In contrast to the former Logic Theorist project, the GPS works with means–ends analysis.

==Overview==
Any problem that can be expressed as a set of well-formed formulas (WFFs) or Horn clauses, and that constitutes a directed graph with one or more sources (that is, hypotheses) and sinks (that is, desired conclusions), can be solved, in principle, by GPS. Proofs in the predicate logic and Euclidean geometry problem spaces are prime examples of the domain of applicability of GPS. It was based on Simon and Newell&#x27;s theoretical work on logic machines. GPS was the first computer program that separated its knowledge of problems (rules represented as input data) from its strategy of how to solve problems (a generic solver engine). GPS was implemented in the third-order programming language, IPL.

While GPS solved simple problems such as the Towers of Hanoi that could be sufficiently formalized, it could not solve any real-world problems because the search was easily lost in the combinatorial explosion. Put another way, the number of &quot;walks&quot; through the inferential digraph became computationally untenable. (In practice, even a straightforward state space search such as the Towers of Hanoi can become computationally infeasible, albeit judicious prunings of the state space can be achieved by such elementary AI techniques as A* and IDA*).

The user defined objects and operations that could be done on the objects, and GPS generated heuristics by means–ends analysis in order to solve problems. It focused on the available operations, finding what inputs were acceptable and what outputs were generated. It then created subgoals to get closer and closer to the goal.

The GPS paradigm eventually evolved into the Soar architecture for artificial intelligence.

<text>Cedric Price FRIBA (11 September 1934 – 10 August 2003) was an English architect and influential teacher and writer on architecture.

== Early life and education ==
The son of an architect (A.G. Price, who worked with Harry Weedon), Price was born in Stone, Staffordshire, and studied architecture at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1955, and the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, where he encountered and was influenced by the modernist architect and urban planner Arthur Korn. From 1958 to 1964 he taught part-time at the Architectural Association School of Architecture and at the Council of Industrial Design. He later founded &quot;Polyark&quot;, an architectural schools network.

== Career ==
After graduating, Price worked briefly for Erno Goldfinger, Denys Lasdun, the partnership of Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, and applied unsuccessfully for a post at London County Council, working briefly as a professional illustrator before starting his own practice in 1960. He worked with The Earl of Snowdon and Frank Newby on the design of the Snowdon Aviary at London Zoo (1961). He later also worked with Buckminster Fuller on the &quot;Claverton Dome&quot;.

One of his more notable projects was the East London Fun Palace (1961), developed in association with theatrical director Joan Littlewood and cybernetician Gordon Pask. Although it was never built, its flexible space influenced other architects, notably Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano whose Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris extended many of Price&#x27;s ideas – some of which Price used on a more modest scale in the Inter-Action Centre at Kentish Town, London (1971).

Having conceived the idea of using architecture and education as a way to drive economic redevelopment – notably in the north Staffordshire Potteries area (the &#x27;Think-Belt&#x27; project) – he continued to contribute to planning debates. Think-Belt (1963–66) envisaged the reuse of an abandoned railway line as a roving &quot;higher education facility&quot;, re-establishing the Potteries as a centre of science and technology. Mobile classroom, laboratory and residential modules could be moved grouped and assembled as required.

In 1969, with planner Sir Peter Hall and the editor of &quot;New Society&quot; magazine Paul Barker, he published &quot;Non-plan&quot;, a work challenging planning orthodoxy.

In 1984 Price proposed the redevelopment of London&#x27;s South Bank, and foresaw the London Eye by suggesting that a giant Ferris wheel should be constructed by the River Thames.

== Personal life and death ==
Price was the partner of the actress Eleanor Bron. They had no children.

Price died in London, aged 68, in 2003.

== Recognition ==
In 2002, Price was awarded the Austrian Frederick Kiesler Prize for Architecture and the Arts.

<doc id="1234667" wikidata="Q2551621" url="?curid=1234667" title="Norma Waterson">
<text>Norma Christine Waterson (15 August 1939 – 30 January 2022) was an English singer and songwriter, best known as one of the original members of The Watersons, a celebrated English traditional folk group. Other members of the group included her brother Mike Waterson and sister Lal Waterson, a cousin John Harrison and, in later incarnations of the group, her husband Martin Carthy.

Waterson was known as the &quot;matriarch of the royal family of British folk music&quot;.

== Early life ==
Waterson was born in Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire Her parents died when she was young and she was raised, with her brother Mike and sister Lal, by their maternal grandmother, Eliza Ward, of Irish Gypsy descent. Waterson later recalled that her grandmother was &quot;a lovely singer and knew a lot of parlour ballads and musical songs she had learned from her childhood, and we all used to sing them.&quot; Other members of the family, including her father and two uncles, were musical, playing the cornet, the banjo, the guitar and the organ.

== The Watersons ==
The band began in the early 1960s with the members being Norma, brother Mike, and sister Elaine (known as Lal), with their cousin John Harrison. They started as a skiffle band but moved on to playing more traditional material. Their first recordings date from 1965; the Topic Records sampler &quot;New Voices&quot; and their first album, &quot;Frost and Fire&quot;. &quot;Frost and Fire&quot; was awarded the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; Album of the Year. The albums &quot;The Watersons&quot; and &quot;A Yorkshire Garland&quot; came out in 1966 but the group disbanded in 1968. Norma moved to the island of Montserrat, working as a DJ for Radio Antilles.

The group reformed in 1972, with John Harrison briefly replaced by Bernie Vickers, performing on the Alan Plater TV &quot;Play for Today&quot;, &quot;The Land of Green Ginger&quot;, set and filmed in Hull, and appearing in a scene filmed in the Bluebell Folk Club. Vickers was replaced the same year by Waterson&#x27;s husband, Martin Carthy. This line-up recorded &quot;For Pence and Spicy Ale&quot; (1975), &quot;Sound, Sound Your Instruments of Joy&quot; (1977), and &quot;Green Fields&quot; (1981).

In the mid-1980s, Mike Waterson&#x27;s daughter Rachel Waterson replaced Lal, due to the latter&#x27;s illness, remaining with the group on Lal&#x27;s return. Regular performing included a session for the BBC Andy Kershaw show in 1986. In 1987, the group collaborated with Swan Arcade to form Blue Murder, who performed and recorded sporadically with various line-ups. Subsequent line-ups fluctuated, featuring Waterson&#x27;s daughter Eliza Carthy, Anne Waterson, Jill Pidd and Maria Gilhooley at various times, but recording only occasionally.

Lal Waterson died in 1998 and, by the early 1990s, Carthy, Waterson and their daughter Eliza had formed the group . They stopped singing live on a regular basis, but occasionally reconvened, as &quot;The Waterson Family&quot;, for special events. These have included &quot;A Mighty River of Song&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall on 12 May 2007, the BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms concert, &quot;Once in a Blue Moon: A Tribute to Lal Waterson&quot;, at Cecil Sharp House in London on 25 October 2007 and &quot;A Tribute to Bert,&quot; a concert celebrating the life and work of Albert Lancaster Lloyd, at Cecil Sharp House on 15 November 2008. During the summer of 2009, &quot;The Waterson Family&quot; performed at a number of festivals and large concerts throughout England and Ireland.

== Later career ==
Norma&#x27;s solo debut album &quot;Norma Waterson&quot; was produced by John Chelew and released by Hannibal Records in 1996, and proved popular, receiving a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize. It included songs with her daughter Eliza, husband Martin Carthy and other members of The Watersons, as well as Danny Thompson (Pentangle), Richard Thompson (Fairport Convention) and Roger Swallow (the Albion Band). In 1999, the follow-up &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot; was released by Hannibal Records and once again featured Richard Thompson, Danny Thompson, Eliza Carthy and husband Martin Carthy.

In 2001 she released her first solo traditional folk album, &quot;Bright Shiny Morning&quot;, on Topic Records. She appeared on a variety of collective recordings, notably Peter Bellamy&#x27;s &quot;The Transports&quot;. In 2008 Waterson made a guest appearance alongside brother Mike on Scottish musician James Yorkston&#x27;s album &quot;When the Haar Rolls In&quot;, singing her sister Lal&#x27;s song, &quot;Midnight Feast&quot;.

In 2009 Topic Records released a 70-year anniversary boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot;. This included two Watersons albums and one Waterson:Carthy album; &quot;Frost and Fire&quot;, &quot;For Pence and Spicy Ale&quot; and &quot;Waterson:Carthy&quot;. The tracks that Norma performs on are &quot;Hal-An-Tow&quot; (track 11 on the second CD), &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot; (track 17), &quot;We Poor Labouring Men&quot; with Waterson:Carthy (track 21 on the sixth CD) and, with &quot;Blue Murder&quot;, &quot;No One Stands Alone&quot; (track 22 of the seventh CD).

In 2010 Waterson released an album of collaborations with her daughter Eliza entitled &quot;Gift&quot;. BBC reviewer Laura Barton wrote: &quot;The gift in question here, one gathers, is a handing of talent from generation to generation; Norma Waterson and Eliza Carthy are, after all, the sublimely gifted mother and daughter who make up part of British folk&#x27;s great dynasty.&quot; Commenting on the final song, &quot;Shallow Brown&quot;, the reviewer noted: &quot;Backed variously by other family members, including Eliza&#x27;s father Martin Carthy on guitar as well as her cousin Oliver Knight on electric guitar, vocals and cello, there is a real sense of congregation and rootedness about this song, and indeed this record as a whole. Long may the dynasty flourish.&quot;

In 2016 Waterson received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards alongside Joan Armatrading.

Waterson was known as the &quot;matriarch of the royal family of British folk music&quot;. She continued to sing well in her 70s, and was described as &quot;a hard-working, prolific artist who refused to stop recording or touring.&quot; Her final album, released in 2018, was &quot;Anchor&quot;, the second recorded with Eliza. It includes Waterson singing lead on a dramatic, jazz-edged treatment of the Tom Waits song &quot;Strange Weather&quot; and on a version of Nick Lowe&#x27;s &quot;The Beast in Me&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==

Waterson married Martin Carthy in 1972. Their daughter Eliza Carthy was born in 1975. They also have another daughter named Lucy Carthy. 

She was awarded the MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in the Queen&#x27;s 2003 New Year Honours, for her services to folk music.

Waterson died on 30 January 2022, at the age of 82. She had been suffering from pneumonia.

<text>Marie de Gournay (; 6 October 1565, Paris – 13 July 1645) was a French writer, who wrote a novel and a number of other literary compositions, including &quot;The Equality of Men and Women&quot; (&quot;Égalité des hommes et des femmes&quot;, 1622) and &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Grievance&quot; (&quot;Grief des dames&quot;, 1626). She insisted that women should be educated. Gournay was also an editor and commentator of Michel de Montaigne. After Montaigne&#x27;s death, Gournay edited and published his &quot;Essays&quot;.

== Life ==
She was born in Paris in 1565. Her father, Guillaume Le Jars, was treasurer to King Henry III of France. In 1568 he obtained feudal rights to the Gournay estate in Picardy, and in 1573, after he purchased the Neufvy estate, he became Seigneur de Neufvy et de Gournay. The family moved to Gournay-sur-Aronde after her father&#x27;s sudden death in 1577.

Gournay was an autodidact. She studied the humanities and taught herself Latin. Her studies led her to discover the works of Michel de Montaigne. She met him in 1588 in Paris after writing him a note and became his &quot;adopted daughter&quot;. She published her first book in 1594, &quot;Le Proumenoir de Monsieur de Montaigne&quot;.

After her mother&#x27;s death in 1591, Marie moved to Paris, leaving the family home to her brother Charles, who was forced to sell it in 1608. Montaigne died the following year, and his widow, Françoise de la Chassaigne, provided Gournay with a copy of the &quot;Essays&quot; and charged her with its publication. In 1595 Gournay published the first posthumous edition of his &quot;Essays&quot; and in 1598 she published a revised edition. She settled in Paris, determined to earn a living from writing. She published a timely discussion on the education of children in 1608, &quot;Bienvenue à Monseigneur le Duc d&#x27;Anjou&quot;. This work brought her to wider attention among Paris intellectuals. Her 1610 work &quot;Adieu de l&#x27;ame du Roy de France et de Navarre&quot; caused a scandal because it defended Jesuits, who were suspected of having conspired to assassinate King Henry IV. Gournay was attacked in the satirical pamphlet &quot;The Anti-Gournay&quot; and was pictured as an old shrew.

In Paris, Marie de Gournay met Henri Louis Habert de Montmor and the scholar Justus Lipsius presented her to Europe as a woman of letters. Gournay found herself protectors by writing for Queen Margo, Henry IV of France, Marie de Médicis, Louis XIII, the marquise de Guercheville, the ministers Villeroy and Jeannin. Queen Margo became her patron. Gournay was invited to the Queen&#x27;s royal salon and received financial support on a quarterly basis.

She translated works by Sallust, Ovid, Virgil, and Tacitus. Gournay also wrote verses about her cat Léonore (also the name of Montaigne&#x27;s daughter) and Joan of Arc, adapted Ronsard, wrote on the instruction of princes, and criticized the &quot;Précieuses&quot;. In 1619 she published the translation &quot;Versions de quelques pièces de Virgile, Tacite, Salluste&quot; with a preface in which she opposed François de Malherbe&#x27;s view that the French language had to be purged. Gournay was accused of being ridiculous, past-orientated, and of being an old maid. In turn, Gournay published a fierce defense of women&#x27;s rights in 1622, &quot;Égalité des Hommes et des Femmes&quot;, which she dedicated to Queen Anne d&#x27;Autriche. In 1624 she published a bold revision of Pierre de Ronsard&#x27;s poem &quot;Remerciement, au Roy&quot;.
In her 1626 novel &quot;Le Promenoir de M. de Montaigne qui traite de l’amour dans l’œuvre de Plutarque&quot; she explored the dangers women face when they become dependent on men. A collection of her works was published in 1626 entitled &quot;L&#x27;ombre de la damoiselle de Gournay&quot;. She moved to an apartment on the rue Saint Honoré and helped to establish the French Academy. The small pension granted to her by Cardinal Richelieu allowed her to publish a 1635 edition of Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;. In 1641 she published another collection of her own works &quot;Les Advis, ou les Presens de la Demoiselle de Gournay&quot;. She died in 1645, aged 79, and is buried at the Saint-Eustache Church in Paris. Marie de Gournay is now recognized as the first woman in France to contribute to literary criticism and one of the first to argue forcibly on the equality of men and women. Her final collected works ran to nearly 1,000 pages.

== Views on women&#x27;s education ==
Gournay&#x27;s arguments for women&#x27;s right to education had a religious underpinning. Gournay was Roman Catholic and known as an opponent of the Protestant movement in the French wars of religion. She advocated for women&#x27;s education in two treatises, &quot;Égalité des Hommes et des Femmes&quot; (&quot;The Equality of Men and Women&quot;), published 1622, and &quot;Grief des Dames&quot; (&quot;The Ladies&#x27; Grievance&quot;) published 1626. She argued that men and women were equal because &quot;the virtue of men and virtue of women are the same thing, since God bestowed on them the same creation and the same honor&quot;.

&quot;Happy are you, reader, if you do not belong to this sex to which all good is forbidden&quot;

In &quot;The Equality of Men and Women&quot; Gournay structured her argument similarly to Christine de Pizan, and started by profiling great women of the past to demonstrate the ability of women to learn. She avoided the discussion on superiority of one sex over the other by stressing the equality of men and women. But she attacked the notion that great women simply resembled great men. She argued that it was no surprise that women were perceived as incompetent, ignorant, and focused on their bodies, given that women received little education. Gournay argued that given the same opportunities, privileges, and education as men, women could equal men&#x27;s accomplishments. In &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Grievance&quot; Gournay complained that women did not own property, exercise freedom, or have access to public office. She argued that educated women had the right to be heard, just as educated men do. Like René Descartes she separated the mind from the body, and argued that women were as capable as men.

<doc id="1234679" wikidata="Q450214" url="?curid=1234679" title="Aly Bain">
<text>Aly Bain MBE (born 15 May 1946) is a Scottish fiddler who learned his instrument from the old-time master Tom Anderson. The former First Minister of Scotland Jack McConnell called Bain a &quot;Scottish icon.&quot;

==Career==
Bain was born in the town of Lerwick, in the Shetland Islands of Scotland. In the early years of his career, he was—briefly and unofficially—part of the band The Humblebums with Gerry Rafferty, Billy Connolly and Tam Harvey. He was one of the members of the band &quot;Gordon Hank and the Country Ramblers&quot;, which also included Gordon Smith, Ian Stewart and Jack Robertson in 1967 and was based in Shetland.

He became nationally prominent as a founding member of The Boys of the Lough, a Scots-Irish folk group, with whom he played for over 30 years.

Simultaneously, Bain pursued a solo career in collaborative and television projects with Pelicula Films director Mike Alexander and producer Douglas Eadie, working on several international television series: &quot;The Down home Recordings&quot; (which described how fiddling music spread from Scotland and Ireland to America), &quot;The Shetland Sessions&quot; (recorded at the Shetland folk festival in 1991), &quot;Aly Meets The Cajuns&quot;, and six series of the &quot;Transatlantic Sessions&quot;.

<text>The prime minister of Gabon () is the head of government of Gabon.

The position was first created in 1960, upon the country&#x27;s independence from France, but was soon abolished by a new constitution adopted on 21 February 1961. It was, however, restored by constitutional amendments enacted on 16 April 1975 and was also retained in the subsequent constitution adopted in 1991. The prime minister has been the head of government of Gabon from 1960 until 1961 (under a parliamentary system) and since 1981 (under a strong semi-presidential system). The President of Gabon was the country&#x27;s head of government from 1961 until 1981 (until 1975 under a presidential system without a prime minister and then under a presidential system with a prime minister).

A total of thirteen people have served as Prime Minister, twelve men and one woman.

==Description of the office==

Within forty-five (45) days, after the nomination and deliberation of the Council of Ministers, the prime minister will present before the National Assembly his or her general policy program that will lead to an open debate, followed by a vote of confidence. The vote is obtained by an absolute majority of the members of the National Assembly.

The prime minister directs the actions of the Government. The prime minister assures the execution of the laws. According to the conditions of Article 20 mentioned above, the Prime Minister exercises regulatory power and nominates civil and military posts of the State. The Prime Minister stands in for the President of the Republic in the aforementioned situations. The prime minister may delegate certain powers to other members of Government.

A replacement for the prime minister is assured by a member of the Government designated by a decree of the President of the Republic, according to the order of nomination of the decree that arranged the composition of the Government.

<doc id="1234688" wikidata="Q1191924" url="?curid=1234688" title="Ben Sheets">
<text>Ben Michael Sheets (born July 18, 1978) is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played for the Milwaukee Brewers, Oakland Athletics, and Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball. Sheets is a four-time MLB All-Star (2001, 2004, 2007, and 2008). He won a gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

==Amateur career==
Sheets graduated from St. Amant High School in Ascension Parish, Louisiana. He attended Northeast Louisiana University on a college baseball scholarship. He once struck out 20 batters in a game against Louisiana Tech. In the summer of 1998, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) with the Wareham Gatemen, and returned to the CCBL in 1999 to play with the Orleans Cardinals, where he was a teammate of fellow future Major Leaguer Mark Teixeira. Sheets was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the first round (10th overall) of the 1999 draft, he made his professional debut with the Ogden Raptors of the Pioneer League. In August, against the Idaho Falls Chukars, Sheets struck out eight batters while allowing just one hit through five innings. Later in the month, he was promoted to Class A Stockton of the California League. In his seven minor league starts that year, Sheets averaged a strikeout ratio of 10.09 batters per nine innings.

In 2000, Sheets was on the United States national team for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. He pitched 22 innings, struck out 11 batters, walked one, and gave up 11 hits during the tournament, and faced off against Cuban ace Pedro Luis Lazo in the gold medal game, giving up three singles and advancing just one runner to second base for the entire game. Sheets gave up no walks and struck out five in a 4–0 complete-game shutout.

===Milwaukee Brewers (2001–2008)===
By 2001, Sheets had been promoted to the Brewers&#x27; starting rotation. His first two starts resulted in losses, but he won his next four, while pitching to a 1.73 ERA.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA/BW&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On May 29, in his ninth career start, he pitched his first shutout, giving up five hits against the St. Louis Cardinals. He ended the season 11–10 with a 4.76 ERA. In 2003, Sheets was troubled by bulging discs in his lower back. &quot;My back has been hurt but you&#x27;ve got to go out there and perform,&quot; he said. Over the final two months of the season, Sheets pitched poorly and finished the year 11–13 with a 4.45 ERA.

In 2004, Sheets&#x27; trouble with a bulging disc subsided. On June 13, 2004, Sheets struck out all three batters on nine total pitches in the third inning of a 5–4 loss to the Houston Astros, becoming the 26th National League pitcher and the 35th pitcher in major-league history to accomplish an immaculate inning. During 2004, his fastball was being clocked regularly at , primarily a result of improved health. That season he also struck out 18 batters in a May 16, 2004, game against the Atlanta Braves, shattering the franchise record of 14, set by Moose Haas in 1978.

By the end of the season, Sheets established himself as a strikeout threat, throwing 264, to finish second in the National League and third in the majors behind Randy Johnson and Johan Santana. After posting an ERA above 4.00 in his previous three seasons, Sheets compiled a dominant 2.70 ERA and 0.98 WHIP, which ranked Sheets fourth and third, respectively, among all starting pitchers. Most impressively, Sheets amassed only 32 walks, giving Sheets a strikeout-to-walk ratio of over 8:1, far and away the best in the major leagues. A mediocre 12–14 win–loss record during this outstanding season was primarily the result of poor run support. Sheets finished 8th in the Cy Young Award voting.

In response to his success in 2004, the Brewers signed Sheets to a four-year, $38.5 million extension. At that time, it was the largest contract in Brewers history. However, after signing the contract, Sheets struggled with health issues. A series of inner ear infections that caused dizziness and a loss of balance forced Sheets onto the disabled list for a period of time in the beginning of the 2005 season.

Sheets started the 2006 season on the disabled list but quickly came off it only to pitch three starts before going on the DL again with shoulder tendinitis. He returned to the starting rotation two weeks after the All-Star break. Sheets pitched a seven-inning shutout against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In his second game back, he would pitch nearly a complete-game shutout, but in the 9th inning, Sheets gave up a two-run homer to Ken Griffey Jr. of the Reds.

In 2007, Sheets started both his and the Brewers&#x27; season on a high note by throwing an Opening Day complete game, two-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers. A strained hamstring in August forced him to miss the rest of the 2007 regular season.
Sheets started on Opening Day 2008 in a 4–3 win over the Cubs. He batted eighth in the lineup, the first Brewers starting pitcher to bat in a position other than ninth. In his second start, Sheets threw only the second complete-game shutout of his career, beating the San Francisco Giants 7–0 in a five-hit, eight-strikeout performance.

On May 10, Sheets struck out St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; first baseman Albert Pujols on a breaking ball in the first inning to reach 1,082 strikeouts, breaking Teddy Higuera&#x27;s club mark. On July 9, Sheets had a season-high 11 strikeouts, including the first seven outs as strikeouts. By mid-July, he was 10–3 with a 2.85 ERA and was chosen as a starting pitcher for the National League in the 2008 All-Star Game. Pitching in his fourth All-Star Game, Sheets became the first Milwaukee Brewer pitcher to start an All-Star Game. In his 2008 All-Star outing, he pitched two scoreless innings, giving up one hit, walking two, and striking out three.

Sheets finished the season with 13–9 with a 3.09 ERA in 31 starts and 198 innings pitched. He went to a 3–0 count on only 2% of all batters he faced in the season, the lowest percentage in the majors. He also threw curveballs 33% of the time, more than any other starter in the major leagues. At the end of the season, he incurred a tear in his right elbow, underwent Tommy John surgery and did not pitch in the postseason.

In October 2008, Sheets filed for free agency. Most teams were put off by Sheets due to his propensity for injuries. In addition, Sheets was a &quot;type-A&quot; free agent, meaning that if a team signed him before the Rule 4 draft, they would forfeit a draft pick to the Brewers. Sheets ultimately did not play during the 2009 season.

===Oakland Athletics (2010)===

On January 26, 2010, Sheets agreed to a one-year, $10 million with an additional $2 million in incentives, contract with the Oakland Athletics. Sheets got the Opening Day start, going five innings allowing three runs (two earned) on four hits while striking out three and walking four, receiving a no-decision. The Athletics lost the game in the bottom of the 9th.

On July 29, 2010, the Athletics announced Sheets would miss the remainder of the season due to a torn flexor in his right elbow. His season ended with Sheets going 4–9 in 20 starts.

===Atlanta Braves (2012)===
On July 1, 2012, the Atlanta Braves announced that Sheets had signed a minor league contract with the organization in order to attempt a comeback to the major leagues. He made his first minor league start with the Mississippi Braves on July 4, 2012. On July 12, the Braves announced that they had called Sheets up from the minors. Sheets made his first start in nearly two years, on July 15 against the New York Mets. He pitched six scoreless innings, giving up two hits and striking out five to earn the win. After his second start also resulted in no runs given up by Sheets, who pitched six innings of five-hit, six-strikeout ball, he stated, &quot;If you asked me if I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t given up a run, yeah I am. But I&#x27;m not surprised I&#x27;m getting people out. I wouldn&#x27;t have come back if I didn&#x27;t think I could get people out.&quot; Sheets made the final start of his career on October 3, 2012, against the Pirates.

==Personal life==
Sheets was born on July 18, 1978, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. During the 2004 season, Sheets resided in St. Amant, Louisiana. In 2008, he was living in Highland Park, Texas. He and his wife Julie have two sons, Seaver (named after Tom Seaver) and Miller Bennett. Sheets is also part owner of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Milwaukee Admirals. He enjoys Cajun food, including jambalaya and crawfish etouffee. Since 2013, Sheets has been a volunteer baseball coach at his alma mater the University of Louisiana at Monroe. Andy Sheets, a former major league infielder, is a distant cousin.

On June 13, 2014, Sheets was inducted into the Brewers Wall of Honor for pitching over 1,000 innings with the club.

<text>A bothy band is a musical group which comes from the farming culture of nineteenth century Scotland. At that time agriculture was relatively labour-intensive. As a result, large farms often had a small community associated with them, the farm toun. This was made up of married couples who lived in small cottages and single men who lived together in a &quot;bothy&quot;, or shelter. In order to entertain themselves and the other members of the toun, the young men of the bothy would hold musical evenings, the &quot;bothy nichts&quot;, with the music provided by their own impromptu band, the bothy band. A good band might well become known outside the toun, and be in demand for local events such as dances.

<text>University College Dublin Association Football Club, known commonly as UCD, is the football team of University College Dublin. They play in the League of Ireland First Division. Founded in 1895, the club was elected to the League of Ireland in 1979 under the management of Dr. Tony O&#x27;Neill. Since the 2008 season they have played at the UCD Bowl, also home to the college&#x27;s rugby team. &#x27;The Students&#x27; play in bright sky blue and navy. Their reserve and freshers teams play in the Leinster Senior League. The current manager is Donegal native William O&#x27;Connor.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
University College Dublin AFC was founded in 1895 as the Catholic University Medical School Football Club and began playing regular games the following year. A First XI played college games against other universities, and a Second XI entered outside competitions. The club was founder members of the Leinster Junior League in 1896 and reached the semi-finals of the Leinster Senior Cup in 1897. The club became University College Dublin AFC when the new university annexed the Medical School in 1908. UCD won the inaugural Intervarsities competition, the Collingwood Cup, in 1914 and added the Irish Intermediate Cup the following year, beating Portadown 2–1 in a replayed final. When the Irish Free State was formed in 1921 and the new Football Association of Ireland was formed, UCD participated in the FAI Cup preliminary round against fellow non-League team Shamrock Rovers, losing 6–2 in Windy Arbour. UCD were invited to join the League of Ireland in 1922, but had to turn it down on the basis of not being able to field a team in the League of Ireland Shield in September as the academic year didn&#x27;t commence until October. In 1945, they won the FAI Intermediate Cup by beating fellow future League of Ireland members Cobh Ramblers 4–2 in the final. UCD appeared in the FAI Cup in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s; their final appearance as a non-League outfit came in 1957, when Cork Athletic beat UCD 4–2 in the Mardyke.

===1970s===

In 1970, the club was elected to the League of Ireland B Division. From 1976, they embarked on a series of landmark tours, becoming the first western football team to play in China, and following that with tours in places like India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Jordan, the Philippines, Macao, the United States, Sudan, Kenya, and Australia. A second invitation to join the League of Ireland was accepted on 22 July 1979, when Cork Celtic were expelled for not having their financial affairs in order. Their first competitive game as a senior club was on 26 August, when they lost 2–1 to Drogheda United in the FAI League Cup. Theo Dunne was appointed first team coach, and apart from a brief spell at Home Farm in 1990–1994, he was in charge of first team affairs until he retired as coach in 2001. Dr. Tony O&#x27;Neill, who was General Manager when the club joined the League, remained in that role until his untimely death from cancer in October 1999.

===1980s===
The club struggled initially in the league after their election, never finishing higher than twelfth in the 16-team league, although they did win the Leinster Senior Cup in December 1980, beating St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic 2–1 in the final. However, important changes within the club in 1983 marked a dramatic upturn in fortunes. The previously amateur club turned semi-pro, and players outside of the college were allowed to represent the first team. This is still the situation today, although in practice most of the players are either students or ex-students. By the end of the 1983–84 season, UCD had won the FAI Cup, beating Shamrock Rovers 2–1 after a replay. Shamrock Rovers weren&#x27;t to lose another game in the competition for over three years – until they lost to UCD in 1988.

That win saw UCD qualify for European competition – the European Cup Winners Cup – for the first time. The draw pitted them against Everton, then one of the leading sides in England and boasting players of the calibre of Neville Southall, Kevin Sheedy, Graham Sharp, Peter Reid and Andy Gray. The home leg was played in Tolka Park and a crowd of 9,000 – many times UCD&#x27;s average league crowd – saw the Students come away with a scarcely believable 0–0 draw. Another remarkable performance was to follow two weeks later, as a solitary Graham Sharp goal gave Everton a 1–0 win. Joe Hanrahan skimmed the bar for the Students late on; had he scored, UCD would have progressed on away goals – as it was, Everton went on to win the entire competition and smashed several records in winning their nation&#x27;s league title. UCD&#x27;s performance was made all the more remarkable by the fact that, at the end of the year, Everton were voted the best club side in the world for 1985 by the managers of world national teams.

That season saw UCD finish fourth in the league, but they were then forced to release many of their best players due to financial difficulties. Joe Hanrahan signed for Manchester United for IR£30,000, Ken O&#x27;Doherty moved to Crystal Palace, and Alan O&#x27;Neill left for Dundalk. The team were relegated in 1985/86 with eight points, a record low in the Premier Division. Despite this, in 1987, UCD won the World Collegiate Championships in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

Promotion in 1988–89 was followed by an immediate relegation, and it was 1994–95 before UCD were to return to the Premier. They did so by recording a then-record points tally for the First Division, also breaking the record for most goals scored and fewest goals conceded.

===1990s===
In 1999–00, a late burst saw UCD finish fourth in the league and qualify for the Intertoto Cup. Their opponents were the Bulgarian side PFC Velbazhd Kyustendil, who boasted a couple of full Bulgaria internationals, including Ilian Stoyanov, who would go on to represent his country in the 2004 European Championships. UCD kept up their proud European record with a pulsating 3–3 draw in the first leg in Belfield Park before drawing 0–0 in Bulgaria to bow out on away goals. History unfortunately repeated itself as the Students once again nearly sneaked victory as they hit the post late on.

===2000–2009===

In 2001, Paul Doolin, one of the most successful players in the League of Ireland, took over as manager from former player Martin Moran. After enjoying a successful first season, the team only just avoided relegation in 2002–03 and were eleven points adrift when Doolin left to take over at Drogheda United in September 2003. Pete Mahon was immediately installed as the new manager, and UCD almost staged an incredible Houdini act, losing four games in 16, closing the gap at the bottom to two points and recording the highest points total for a relegated team.

2004 saw more of the same, as UCD, together with Finn Harps, smashed the First Division points record and were promoted with ease. UCD marked their return to the Premier Division with a highly creditable 1–1 draw away to two-time reigning champions Shelbourne. There was a bright point in College&#x27;s ultimately indifferent season when they got into the League Cup final after a last-gasp 2–1 victory over Shelbourne in the semi-final at Tolka Park. They went on to lose the final 2–1 to Derry City at Belfield Park.

2006 was one of UCD&#x27;s most successful seasons in a few years. Despite being knocked out of the League Cup in the first round, The Students recovered well, finishing the season in 6th place and reaching the quarterfinals of the FAI Cup. The performances of many in the squad did not go unnoticed, with Darren Quigley and Gary Dicker establishing themselves as under-21 internationals. Quigley then went one better and became on B international when he appeared as a substitute against Scotland B in November. UCD players also attracted interest from many British clubs. Quigley had trials at many clubs across the water; Stockport County paid €56,000 for Dicker in May 2007, and Patrick Kavanagh signed for Birmingham City after impressing on trial there. The club were relegated at the end of the 2008 season, and Manager Pete Mahon wasn&#x27;t offered a new contract.

===2009–present===

Mahon&#x27;s assistant since 2005, Martin Russell, took over as manager. With a largely new team, UCD bounced back to the top flight of Irish football at the first time of asking by securing their second First Division title, promoted after a 5–0 away win over Athlone Town in the penultimate match of the season on 30 October 2009, ahead of former Premier Division teams Shelbourne, Longford Town, Waterford United FC as well as a strong challenge from recently formed Sporting Fingal FC. In the 2009 FAI Cup, UCD&#x27;s second team qualified for the first round by virtue of reaching the final of the 2008/09 FAI Intermediate Cup. They lost 2–1 at home to Arklow Town, who were drawn to play UCD&#x27;s first team in the second round, also in the UCD Bowl. Despite taking the lead, Arklow, who had no eligible goalkeeper for the tie, ultimately lost 3–1.

Under Russell, UCD remained in the Airtricity League Premier Division. In 2011 the club qualified for the Setanta Sports Cup, an All-Ireland competition, where they lost to Lisburn Distillery FC 2–0 over two legs. At the beginning of the 2014 season Russell was replaced by former coach Aaron Callaghan, who had to serve out a five-game dug-out suspension awarded while at rivals Bohemian FC. UCD struggled all year, and the Students lost a two-legged relegation/promotion play-off with Galway FC in November 2014.

In July 2015, UCD became the first League of Ireland team from the second tier to progress through a European tie when they saw off Luxembourg champions F91 Dudelange in the Europa League. A lone Ryan Swan strike at the UCD Bowl gave the college their first win in a European game, and then a remarkable game at the Stade Jos Nosbaum saw Swan give UCD the lead early in the game, but after Seán Coyne was sent off, F91 scored twice before halftime through Joël Pedro and Kevin Nakache. UCD players put up the most incredible defensive display of the season, led by goalkeeper Niall Corbet and kept the second half scoreless to progress on away goals after a 2–2 aggregate draw, winning on the away goals rule. In the second round, UCD lost to a late deflected goal away to a Slovan Bratislava with three players who had played at the 2010 FIFA World Cup before losing the return leg 5–1, conceding three goals in the last ten minutes.

In 2017, the club competed in the UEFA Youth League, losing on penalties to a Molde FK which included Erling Haaland. Haaland was introduced as a sub in the return game at the Aker Stadion and didn&#x27;t score in his half-hour on the pitch, although he did score in the penalty shoot-out.

In September 2018, the club won promotion to the Premier Division after a 1–1 draw with Finn Harps F.C. which secured the Students the title. They also reached the semi-finals of the FAI Cup for the first time in 12 years only to lose 1–0 away to reigning double-champions Dundalk. However, a tumultuous 2019 season saw a number of players leave mid-season as they had finished college. A club record 12 consecutive defeats were followed by a record 10–1 defeat away to Bohemians, a match which brought about the end of Collie O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s five years in charge. The club was relegated back to the First Division for 2020.

After finishing third in the table in the 2021 League of Ireland First Division, UCD defeated Treaty United and Bray Wanderers in the First Division play-offs before defeating Waterford FC 2–1 in the promotion/relegation play-off to win promotion back to the 2022 League of Ireland Premier Division.

In the 2022 League of Ireland Premier Division, UCD spent most of the season battling with Finn Harps to avoid automatic relegation. It was 15 games into the season before UCD managed their first win of the season, a 1–0 win away to Finn Harps. However, a strong finish to the season and a 3–1 win away to Finn Harps in the penultimate game of the season ensured that UCD finished in 9th place and avoided automatic relegation to the First Division, instead qualifying for the promotion/relegation playoff, where they faced Waterford FC in a repeat of the 2021 playoff. A 15th-minute goal by Tommy Lonergan, his 12th of the season in all competitions, led UCD to a 1–0 win and ensured their survival in the Premier Division.

==Scholarship scheme==
UCD AFC is noted for its highly regarded scholarship scheme, which gives players the chance to combine senior football with the opportunity to earn a college degree. This was based on the North American model and created in 1979 on UCD&#x27;s entry into the League of Ireland Senior Division. The first recipient of the award was Keith Dignam, sponsored by Irish Potato Crisp manufacturer Tayto. Past scholars include Kevin Grogan, Joe Hanrahan and his brother Peter Hanrahan, Jason Colwell, Jason Sherlock, Clive Delaney, Gary Dicker, Paul Corry and Robbie Benson.

==Former players==

Many famous players have played for UCD down the years. Todd Andrews, future Chairman of CIÉ and RTÉ, and his son David Andrews, a future Minister for Foreign Affairs, both played in the Leinster Senior League for the club, as did Brian Lenihan, who scored in a 1953 FAI Cup tie against Sligo Rovers and later ran for President of Ireland. Willie Browne won numerous international university caps while at UCD, he subsequently went on to win 3 full Republic of Ireland caps, 16 amateur caps, one Republic of Ireland B cap and six Inter-League caps and captained Bohemian for 3 consecutive seasons. Former Irish international Kevin Moran, who would later play for Manchester United, Sporting de Gijón and Blackburn Rovers played in the League of Ireland B Division and was signed for Manchester United from UCD&#x27;s graduate team, Pegasus. Moran also won an All-Ireland Gaelic football winner&#x27;s medal with Dublin in 1976 while at UCD, as would Jason Sherlock nineteen years later. Conor Sammon, Enda Stevens and Andy Boyle also won senior international caps having started their careers with UCD.

Hugo MacNeill won the Collingwood with UCD, but went on to greater things with the Ireland national rugby union team, winning the Triple Crown in 1985 and playing in the 1987 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. In 1983, the Leeds United legend and record goalscorer Peter Lorimer played three games before returning to England for a final spell with Leeds. Dave Norman played senior international football for Canada while at UCD and went on to play in the 1986 World Cup. Former Sky Sports and current Setanta Sports pundit Paul Dempsey played for one season in 1982/83 before taking up a job with the BBC

Gavin Whelan (nephew of Ronnie Whelan) and Pat Jennings (son of Northern Irish international Pat Jennings) played for UCD in the mid-2000s. In August 2016, Dylan Watts signed for English Premiership champions Leicester City from UCD.

A popular rumour has it that Brazilian star Sócrates even played for the club; however, there is no evidence for this.

==Fan culture==
UCD has a small fanbase, which included until his untimely death the &quot;Father Ted&quot; actor Dermot Morgan, an occasional visitor to Belfield. When asked why he attended UCD matches, Dermot reportedly replied &quot;Because I hate crowds&quot;.
From 2001 to 2010, the unofficial club fanzine &quot;Student Till I Graduate&quot; published a record 91 issues. The book &quot;One Night in Dudelange – Adventures in the UEFA Europa League&quot; chronicles the club&#x27;s 2015 Europa League campaign and was listed for Sports Book of the Year in 2019.

The UCD Superleague is an inter-varsity league consisting of teams predominantly made up of UCD students and alumni. The league has produced a handful of UCD and other League of Ireland players.

<text>Prunus cerasifera is a species of plum known by the common names cherry plum and myrobalan plum. Native to Eurasia and naturalized elsewhere, &quot;P. cerasifera&quot; is believed to be one of the parents of the cultivated plum.

==Description==
Wild types are large shrubs or small trees reaching tall, sometimes spiny, with glabrous, ovate deciduous leaves long. It is one of the first European trees to flower in spring, often starting in mid-February before the leaves have opened. The flowers are white or pale pink and about across, with five petals and many stamens. The fruit is an edible drupe, 2–3 cm in diameter, ripening to yellow or red from early July to mid-September. They are self-fertile but can also be pollinated by other &quot;Prunus&quot; varieties such as the Victoria plum. The plant propagates by seed or by suckering, and is often used as the rootstock for other &quot;Prunus&quot; species and cultivars.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is native to Southeast Europe and Western Asia, and is naturalised in the British Isles and scattered locations in North America. It is also naturalized in parts of Southeast Australia where it is considered to be a mildly invasive weed of bushland near urban centers.

==Ecology==
&quot;P. cerasifera&quot; is believed to be one of the parents of the cultivated plum, &quot;Prunus domestica&quot;, perhaps crossing with the sloe, &quot;Prunus spinosa&quot;, or perhaps the sole parent. This would make it a parent of most of the commercial varieties of plum in the UK and mainland Europe: Victoria, greengages, bullace, etc.

==Cultivation==
The cherry plum is a popular ornamental tree for garden and landscaping use, grown for its very early flowering. Numerous cultivars have been developed, many of them selected for purple foliage, such as &quot;P. cerasifera&quot; var &quot;pissardii&quot; (&quot;P.&quot; &#x27;Atropurpurea&#x27;). The cultivar &#x27;Nigra&#x27; with black foliage and pink flowers, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. &quot;Prunus&quot; × &quot;cistena&quot; (purple leaf sand cherry), a hybrid of &quot;Prunus cerasifera&quot; and &quot;Prunus pumila&quot;, the sand cherry, also won the Award of Garden Merit. These purple-foliage forms (often called &#x27;purple-leaf plum&#x27;), also have dark purple fruit, which make an attractive, intensely coloured jam. They can have white or pink flowers. The cultivar &#x27;Thundercloud&#x27; has bright red foliage which darkens purple. Others, such as &#x27;Lindsayae&#x27;, have green foliage. Some kinds of purple-leaf plums are used for bonsai and other forms of living sculpture. Cultivated cherry plums can have fruits, foliage, and flowers in any of several colours.

== Uses ==
The fruits are edible. Some varieties have sweet fruits that can be eaten fresh, while others are sour and better for making jam. Cherry plums are a key ingredient in Georgian cuisine where they are used to produce tkemali sauce, as well as a number of popular dishes, such as kharcho soup and chakapuli stew. It is a popular tree in Romania where its fruits are used for souring soups when immature, for eating raw when ripened, and for making moonshine when overripe because of their high sugar content.

<doc id="1234711" wikidata="Q4945186" url="?curid=1234711" title="Boris Badenov">
<text>Boris Badenov is an antagonist character in the 1959–1964 animated series &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; and &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot;, so often appearing with his devious accomplice, Natasha Fatale, that the two are usually grouped together, as Boris and Natasha, a reference to Boris Drubetskoy and Natasha Rostova in Tolstoy’s &quot;War and Peace&quot;. He was originally voiced by Paul Frees. The character was created by Bill Scott, who based his appearance on that of Gomez Addams.

Badenov&#x27;s name is a pun on that of 16th-century Russian tsar Boris Godunov (i.e., &quot;good enough&quot; vs. &quot;bad enough&quot;). His accent and explosive temper are a homage to Hollywood actor Akim Tamiroff, especially his role in &quot;The Great McGinty&quot;.

Boris is a spy from the fictional nation of Pottsylvania, and takes orders from the strongman known as Fearless Leader (and occasionally the rarely seen Mr. Big). Boris&#x27;s missions range from trying to steal a secret rocket fuel formula to eliminating all television from the United States as part of Pottsylvania&#x27;s various attempts to seize power. Boris, who is thoroughly dedicated to (and takes delight in) all manners of nefarious deeds, also sometimes engages in his own schemes, such as starting his own organized crime gang and hiring himself out as a professional executioner, and frequently conspires schemes simply to get rich (such as by posing as a Hollywood director to bilk Bullwinkle out of his life savings in &quot;The Last Angry Moose&quot; or usurping Santa Claus by taking advantage of a freak polar drift in &quot;Topsy Turvy World&quot;). Separately from the television series, a commercial for the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot; featuring Boris established that he was an active member of Local 12 of the Villains, Thieves, and Scoundrels Union. During this commercial, Boris also claims to be &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest nogoodnik&quot;. Boris is also quite proud that the nicest thing Fearless Leader ever did for him was sending a picture of himself to Boris inscribed &quot;Drop Dead — Fearless Leader&quot;. He is a master of disguise and aliases.

According to the Rialto Theater&#x27;s &quot;Moosebill&quot; for &quot;Downhill: The Musical&quot; (a special table of contents insert created for the DVD box set &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle &amp; Friends, The Third Season&quot;), Boris was educated in the Pottsylvania public schools before taking a scoundrelship to U.S.C. (the University of Safe Cracking), from which he graduated magna cum louse. He has a strong stomach and because of it was one of only three survivors of the ruling clique of Pottsylvania, the other two being his superiors Fearless Leader and Mister Big. Boris enjoys light reading; his favorite book is an anthology of fiendish plans called the &quot;Fireside Crook Book&quot;. He is also a charter member of the Van Gogh Society, a Pottsylvanian club whose members collect human ears.

Early in the series, Boris was taller and had red eyes. After the first episodes, he changed to his normal short stature, but still retained the red eyes until a few episodes afterwards. Humorously, they changed from red to white after he had woken up from a long slumber, as if the redness was caused by sleep deprivation.

Boris is nearly always accompanied by his fellow spy, Natasha Fatale, an iconic femme fatale with an icy smile who wears a slit dress. The first time he appeared without her was in the story arc &quot;Buried Treasure&quot;. The first story arc in which neither appeared was &quot;The Three Moosketeers&quot;.

Usually, Boris&#x27; misdeeds are thwarted by Rocky the Flying Squirrel and Bullwinkle the Moose. Boris&#x27;s attempts at killing &quot;moose and squirrel&quot; (as he refers to them) also always end in failure, usually by his own scheme backfiring on him. &quot;Of course, I&#x27;ve got plan!&quot; he says. &quot;I&#x27;ve always got plan! They don&#x27;t ever work, but I&#x27;ve always got one!&quot; As Boris expresses his plight in one promo: &quot;I send in lady spy with package which is really bomb. Door gets locked, she can&#x27;t get out, who gets blown up? Me!&quot;

Boris appeared in all but three &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; storylines: &quot;The Three Moosketeers&quot;, &quot;The Ruby Yacht&quot;, and &quot;Mucho Loma&quot;. Boris often appeared in segments of &quot;Bullwinkle&#x27;s Corner&quot;, &quot;Mr. Know-It-All&quot;, and &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan Club&quot;.

==Catch phrases==

Boris&#x27;s main catch phrase (spoken when frustrated) is &quot;Raskolnikov!&quot; (a reference to the novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; by Dostoevsky), spoken in his Pottsylvanian accent (a mock-Russian accent).

Boris would also say, &quot;Sharrup you mouth!&quot; to Natasha when his schemes failed. However, in the final segment of &quot;Greenpernt Oogle&quot;, when he and Natasha were stuck in their own mine field, he says to her, &quot;Natasha, next time I get fiendish plan, do me big favor? Sharrup my mouth!&quot; She does indeed do this in one episode, saying those very words to Boris as the car they were in dropped over a cliff to the ground in the 8-segment story arc &quot;The Treasure of Monte Zoom&quot;. Also, whenever his superior gives him an order, he utters the line &quot;You sair it!&quot;

Boris would usually greet a new acquaintance by saying, &quot;Allow me to introducing myself. I am Boris Badenov, world&#x27;s greatest no-goodnik&quot;.

==In other media==

*In the 1992 Showtime Network film &quot;Boris and Natasha: The Movie&quot;, the live-action Boris was played by Dave Thomas.
*In the 2000 theatrical film &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, the live-action Boris was played by Jason Alexander.
*Boris reappears in the 2014 3D DreamWorks Animation short film &quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot;, voiced by Robert Cait.
*Boris appears in the 2018 Amazon Video series &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, where he is voiced by Benjamin Diskin. This incarnation, while still mean and selfish, is also ditzy, easily distracted and somewhat childlike, almost an evil version of Bullwinkle. Instead of usurping Santa, he shows great admiration for him. (&quot;I talk about Santa all I want. He&#x27;s very magical man.&quot;) He&#x27;s also a surprisingly gifted keytar player, although it appears his mother didn&#x27;t approve of the instrument. He was sent to spy school because his mother had hoped for him to be Pottsylvania&#x27;s next top model, but as time went on she realized that wasn&#x27;t possible.
*Boris has appeared in two &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; sketches.

<text>Rankala Lake is a freshwater lake located in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India.

==History==
Before the eighth century, Rankala was a stone quarry. In the 9th century, an earthquake caused immense structural damage to the quarry, causing water to accumulate from an underground source forming the Rankala Lake. This historic lake features a Hindu temple with a Nandi. According to local Hindu beliefs, Lord Shiva uses the Nandi, moves a single wheat grain towards the lake, and backs about a distance of single rice grain daily. Hindu beliefs state that if Lord Shiva reaches Rankala, the apocalypse will begin.

==Tourism==
This historical lake is a treasure trove for scenery admirers. Rankala features the Shalini Palace to the north, the &quot;Padmaraje Garden&quot; to the northeast, and a recently developed park towards the southeast bank. Rankala&#x27;s southeast park has a fresh food market. Activities like horseriding and boating can also be experienced. Shalini Palace, made up of intricately carved black stone and Italian marble, has now been converted into a hotel.

<text>SAP Business Warehouse (SAP BW) is SAP’s Enterprise Data Warehouse product. It can transform and consolidate business information from virtually any source system. It ran on industry standard RDBMS until version 7.3 at which point it began to transition onto SAP&#x27;s HANA in-memory DBMS, particularly with the release of version 7.4. 

Latterly, it evolved into a product called BW/4HANA so as to align with SAP&#x27;s sister ERP Product called S/4HANA. This strategy allowed SAP to engineer the database to use the HANA in-Memory database. Consequently, this facilitates the push down of complex OLAP based functions to the database as opposed to NetWeaver ABAP Application Server to improve performance. The product is also more open and can incorporate SAP and Non-SAP data more easily.

==History==
In 1998 SAP released the first version of SAP BW, providing a model-driven approach to EDW that made data warehousing easier and more efficient, particularly for SAP R/3 data. Since then, SAP BW has evolved to become a key component for thousands of companies. An article, provided the history of SAP BW from inception to the newer releases powered by SAP HANA.
